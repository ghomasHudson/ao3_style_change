That got Dean a nod but it was soon followed by a sigh. "Dean, I want to help you but..." The hesitant silence Cas left finished his sentence.
Dean laughed and nodded a little. "Yeah dude, I invented that trick. Ain't gonna get rid of me that easily."
The line turned quiet and Dean was a hundred percent sure he'd fucked it up. He had completely destroyed two pretty good friendships today.
Professor Holmes got up one last time while Professor Hudson put away the stool and Sorting Hat again.
Gabriel himself couldn't care less about the student exchange. He'd just seen it as an opportunity to discover another part of the world and get a little change of scene. He was a Thunderbird for a reason, after all. But he knew Michael planned for their trip to become a great educational success and his little brothers were nervous as hell about it.
Cas turned his eyes downward. "I'm sorry about that. I couldn't..." He sighed and looked around out of the corner of his eye. "Do you think we could talk in your car?"
Sam opened his mouth... and closed it. Part of him wanted to tell Lucifer, just so his boyfriend could tell him exactly why it was all bullshit. That Gabriel was on Michael's side and didn't give a shit about Sam's feelings or Lucifer's, and that the Trickster just wanted attention. But then there was the other part. The teeny, tiny part that was scared that at least something Gabriel had said was right.
It was almost 2am when he went for another refill. As he neared the bar - yes, there was a bar - a guy with dark hair and green eyes approached him. Dean recognized him immediately. It was the same boy Lisa had called the oldest brother, the leader of the Shurleys.
Dean was watching them out of the corner of his eye and again wondered how he could've been so ignorant. He smashed his locker shut and tried to put it out of his mind. It didn't matter anymore. It would be over and done with soon enough, if he had to believe Gabriel. But then again... did he still want that?
He hadn't been kidding but okay? He looked over at his brother, who just shrugged and took a pull from his beer as well. Sam actually didn't think it was that bad. Beer was the least of their problems right now anyway.
Dean gave a curt nod while Castiel walked back in, carrying two cups of coffee. He offered one to Sam, who took it with a half-smile. Then he looked at Dean, seemingly debating if the older Winchester could be trusted with a mug of hot liquid at the moment. Apparently he decided against it because he eventually sat down next to Sam and took a sip of the other cup himself.
Surely Castiel would've called if anything had happened, so he assumed his little brother was still on his way. Gabriel had spent the majority of his day working on his dissertation in the library, making him closer to the bus stop and with plenty of time to get there, but still Castiel should have been here by now.
Dean didn't know why he was even surprised he was going to have to spell it out. "I just mean, when I... When you... When we uhm, you know..."
Sam ran after him, carefully watching the distance between them. It was amazing actually. Wherever the Senior passed drinking fountains would spout in people's faces, books were dropped or students ran into each other. When Azazel, one of Dean's classmates they both absolutely hated, walked by, his jeans suddenly came down and Sam burst into laughter. Luckily he wasn't the only one but still he'd apparently caught the Trickster's eye, because the older boy turned around and looked straight at him.
He went back to the living room and put on the TV to clear his mind but it only took his thoughts two minutes to drift off again.
"I didn't say that," Castiel quickly objected. "It's not that I think he is a bad person, I wouldn't know because I don't really know him that well, but I do know Lucifer has a gift of making messes and neglecting to clean them up."
"Nope," Dean answered, popping the 'p'. Then something dawned on him. "Hey, you never told me the whole story. About what happened with Lucifer, I mean."
Gabriel sighed inwardly. As if it wasn't bad enough his dad was coming but nooo, of course his uncle had to join them too. Well, kinda uncle, Metatron and Chuck weren't really brothers, Gabriel thought they were cousins or something? It was complicated. Anyway, fact was that the guy was family and family seemed to be following him everywhere. At least Aunt Amara wasn't here. Probably because Ilvermorny wouldn't last a week without its Headmistress. Yup, even at home Gabriel had been surrounded by family members watching his every move. No wonder he acted out whenever they weren't around.
So when they got out and stepped into the pouring rain, he started grinning like an idiot for no reason at all. He felt like being impulsive and spread out his arms, allowing the water to soak his clothes.
Dean watched in confusion as someone walked out from behind the dumpsters, a feeling that quickly turned into shock when he recognized the short boy with his trademark red lollipop.
At that moment he heard someone laughing and spun around to give whoever the newcomer was a deadly glare. "What are you laughin' at?"
"Yes. Michael may have a stick up his arse, but he's right about Lucifer. I know my brother, the only reason he's interested in Sam is because Michael used to be in you. So..." The shorter guy spread his arms. "I'll help you."
Their lips smashed together and it was as if a giant ball of warmth and happiness exploded in his body. It was nothing like the kiss they'd shared yesterday. This one was long and feisty and full of desire. Sam stumbled back against the desk, placing his hands on the surface automatically so he wouldn't fall over while Lucifer pressed his body against his. The other boy's fingers let go of his shirt and moved to the back of his neck, where he could feel them entwine with his hair. A shiver ran down his spine as Lucifer used his lips to part Sam's. He felt Lucifer's tongue slip past his upper lip, caressing it on its way, and for a moment Sam considered if this was maybe going a little bit too fast. But honestly, his mind couldn't be bothered thinking about that right now. Hell, his mind couldn't be bothered thinking about anything at all besides the mouth moving against his own.
"What they're trying to say," Charlie interfered, "is that maybe the Shurleys like to be by themselves." She smiled at him. "But I think it's cute you're so nice to them."
Kevin frowned. "The Cage, if I remember correctly. Personally, I'd never heard of it. But on the other hand I'm not exactly an expert." He gave Dean a shy smile.
"Are you a psychic or something?" Kevin asked. He was having a hard time believing the stranger had figured that all out by himself.
"Listen," he tried again. "I get you can't just go back to how things were but maybe you could at least try to make amends a bit? How about your dad, he can't still be that angry, right?"
"Great! That's settled then. You know the deal, bring as many friends as you want but take them all with you when you leave 'cause I'm not going to babysit any of those drunk bastards. Oh, and tell your brother to leave Lucifer at home. Wouldn't want his drama ruining the fun."
Dean walked out of the door and headed back to his Impala, which was parked in front of the apartment complex. He got in and drove home, to a small house he and his brother had inherited from their parents. His mom had died when he was still a kid, his father only recently. Dean had been heartbroken about it but he got used to living with his brother rather quickly.
"Hey, if he wants to check it out, you can tell him he can always drop by sometime," Lucifer said casually while walking around his car and getting into the driver's seat. He looked at a still speechless Sam. "You comin'?"
Adam shook his head. "No, she didn't make it through the last round unfortunately. But she promised to write and keep us up to date on Ilvermorny."
Cas moved to the cabinet he had pointed out and Dean turned on the coffee machine while he waited for the top to heat. It only took a couple of minutes before the kitchen was filled with the roasted aroma. Dean took a deep breath before turning to another cupboard to take out his mug.
Michael shrugged in response. "Different years, different Houses. But I've heard of you of course." He grinned. "Dean has quite the reputation."
His three best friends were staring at him like he'd gone crazy. Charlie also seemed to be trying really hard to contain a smile but still.
Sam pulled up his eyebrows. That was yesterday? It felt like weeks ago. And he'd surely forgotten Bobby would step by.
Sam would be damned if he told him what had happened between Richard and him, so instead he decided to focus on the one thing that might actually be of use to them. "Richard. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but he is too... Gabriel."
He had survived all of that. He'd been humiliated, hurt, locked up, stolen from and possibly almost poisoned, but even though this was probably the worst day of his life, he'd live. But then school was over and he got to the parking lot.
Dean hung up the phone, got up and walked back down the stairs. Sam and Bobby were already seated at the kitchen table.
No way in hell he was gonna stop now. He had a feeling he'd only just gotten something. "No. Why not? Why don't you talk to him?"
It was 9pm by then and he'd immediately started calling and texting him like crazy, cursing himself for being so caught up in his own shit he hadn't even thought about his little brother anymore. He felt terrible and nearly panicked when he didn't get an instant reply. What if something had happened to Sam? Dean didn't know where he was, how was he ever supposed to find him? He hadn't even seen him since this morning!
He glared back at the Trickster, the rage clearly visible in his eyes. The guy was still watching him and now pulled out his sucker but that was all. The fire wouldn't go out.
Dean opened his mouth, closed it and opened it again. "Okay, one, we're not talking about that, and two, it's..." He made a face. "Gabriel."
They were silent for a couple of seconds, Cas with a pensive frown on his face, Dean trying to lean on the partition without crushing his crotch.
The Trickster looked up at him with a sadness in his golden eyes that Sam couldn't place. "The girl," he softly spoke. "Jessica, right? She seemed nice. You deserve to be with someone like that. Someone who makes you laugh, who wants to be friends with your friends, who wants to have Saturday dinners with your family. Someone who cherishes you and who is ready to fight for you. Someone... someone who puts your happiness in front of their own."
"You're underestimating yourself, that's what you are," Lucifer said while jumping off the wall. He took the pizza box and put it in a nearby dumpster before offering his hand to Sam.
"Hi, honey," a familiar voice sounded from behind him and he turned around to see his girlfriend, looking up at him with a smile. "You ready?"
Sam rolled his eyes. "I told you I didn't know, what else do you want me to say, Dean? Somebody just spiked my drink, that's it!"
Lucifer squinted his eyes at him, a curious smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "Oh, someone's feeling cocky, are we?"
Sam just remained silent. Charlie was almost like a sister to them but what Sam had to say he wanted to say in private.
Michael pulled up an eyebrow. "So you're saying that if your father, whose judgement you trust beyond anything, told your brother - for a very good reason by the way - to leave, you would pick Sam's side and go with him?"
"This guy had to split up his children to get them into high school?" Dean said. "That's just... wow."
Gabriel was getting really annoyed at his brother. He had been waiting at the bus stop for almost twenty minutes now and Castiel still hadn't showed.
Sam laughed and pushed him off. "I'm sure you do. I'll see you at school tomorrow. Behave while I'm gone."
"Oh," was all Samandriel got out. He hadn't expected anyone to have noticed him. Ever. He just wasn't that type of person, only doing what he was supposed to do.
Gabriel looked at him as if he was joking and when it became clear he wasn't, the guy let out a whistle and rolled his eyes dramatically. "You sorry sons of bitches. You two didn't even bother telling each other, did you?"
"No problem, kid. You boys take care of each other, and you let me know if you need anything, got it?" the man said.
"Shut your face," Dean mumbled and walked over to the counter to pour himself a cup of his own. He'd never needed it more.
A part of Sam wanted to answer and challenge his boyfriend even more but the thrill didn't make him worry any less about what Lucifer's response would be. And as exciting this was, he really didn't need for the whole school to see, especially not his brother. That could turn real embarrassing real quick.
Sam had still been asleep when he took off, so he'd left a note saying he had some stuff to do and Sam should ask someone else to pick him up. That shouldn't be a problem, Charlie and Benny both had a driver's license. And apparently his brother was good at getting rides anyway.
it to mean? Yes, he liked Cas but was he really ready for a relationship with another guy? Having strange thoughts about Michael was one thing. Getting himself a boyfriend was a whole different level.
Bobby had popped in a bit earlier. Dean and him were just finishing preparing dinner when Sam arrived. Well, Dean did the cooking while Bobby handed him stuff and drank a beer. It wasn't like Dean was that great at cooking, actually he had to admit even Sam was a lot better at it, but he'd learned from experience. Besides, he liked taking care of his little brother.
"Yeah, no kidding..." Dean grumbled. "That Chuck Shurley dude messed up big time if you ask me. No wonder Dad warned us about him."
After everything Lisa had told them about the Shurleys, Dean was ready for about anything. But he hadn't been prepared for this.
Sam was almost certain he knew who Lucifer was talking about, but he asked it anyway. "The Trickster?"
"Why, Michael? Doesn't he want to talk about Lucifer? Or just in general? He can't be completely ignoring you, there's gotta be something you can do. Why don't you just talk to him about it?"
That was all Dean needed to ask on and he grinned mischievously. "The cute Pukwudgie kid doesn't happen to be one of them, does he?"
He nodded. "I thought about that too. But honestly, I don't think they even hang out that often anymore. Maybe they've gotten into a fight or something?"
Saturday afternoon Sam was sitting on the side of his bed. He honestly didn't know what to do. Of course he wanted to make his brother happy and somewhere deep down he knew Dean was right. But meeting up with Michael Shurley? Sam had never even spoken to the guy. Sure, he was friends with Dean and his brother had told him they could bring some of their other friends too, but Sam still felt a little uncomfortable about the whole idea. And even without all of that he still was anything but excited. Somehow he felt like having fun would be some sort of betrayal towards Jess and even the thought of that made him feel guilty.
"Doesn't matter," Sam was quick to say. "Point is, what if..." He sighed. He knew this was gonna sound ridiculous. "What if Richard somehow
"No. I don't," Michael said. "I think it's Lucifer being Lucifer, always wanting the things I have."
About ten minutes later Sam came down again, dressed in his pj's and a towel in his hand with which he tried to dry his hair a little.
Next Monday he still hadn't found a solution for all of his problems. So when he saw Michael making his way towards him and Lisa, he practically froze.
He knew Kevin would be there for him but he also realized a lot of other people would be asking a lot of questions, and Sam didn't think he'd have the energy to answer them. And if he ran into Lucifer... God, he really didn't want to think about that, even though he knew it was inevitable that they'd see each other again eventually. A tiny part of him couldn't help but think... what if Lucifer had changed his mind? What if he regretted the things he'd said, what if he'd realized he did love Sam?
"Then why risk it? What's so important you had to go behind his back?" Dean asked. He didn't understand. He thought all of the Shurleys hated him, except for Cas, and he didn't even know Gabriel, not really. What could the guy possibly want from him?
By the time Sam came home, Dean was grateful to be relieved from his stressful philosophizing. Someone had to put order to the mess that was his mind, and he obviously wasn't fit for the job.
Still on ground level, the boy looked up at him and smiled. "Hello, Dean." Then he grabbed a garbage can, placed it on top of the toilet and started climbing the seemingly quite unreliable construction, so that he ended up slightly looking down on Dean, his head pressed against the ceiling.
Gabriel followed the three pairs of footsteps and also noticed Dean and Sam had started a signing conversation again. Too bad he couldn't understand what they were saying. He wondered if they were talking about him...
Instead he said, "I don't know, Cas, I'm a little bit busy having an existential crisis here!" He started pacing again.
Kevin went to sit next to Sam and offered his fellow Horned Serpent a shy smile. Of all the Ilvermorny students Kevin had probably been one of the most likely to get into the program. He was an incredibly smart kid and had no reason to be worried about the event whatsoever, so it was kinda adorable he was just as nervous as Sam and the rest of them.
Look, I'm alive! This took me way too long to write, I know, I'm sorry, I'll try to never do it again. In all fairness, life's been fifty shades of crazy the last month. I left for the US to go to college in Nebraska for a semester and it's been a total mess. On the bright side, at this exact moment I'm on my way back from the very last while-they're-filming-there SPN VanCon. It was without doubt one of the best weekends of my life. I've met a bunch of amazing people, the actors are just as sweet and funny as I always imagined them to be, and I love Rich even more right now, if that was possible. Screw cash, I'm going to JIB next year.
He guessed Gabriel was right about that much, and Sam honestly didn't know how he felt about it. For a moment he had to remind himself that this was the same guy that had played pranks on him for an entire week when he got here, that had bullied his brother, and that had sabotaged his relationship, even if it didn't need much sabotaging in the first place. No matter how nice he was acting now, Sam didn't really know Gabriel. Hell, maybe the guy was just as bad as the rest of his brothers. It didn't matter what Castiel had said about seeing the best in people, Sam wasn't about to let himself be fooled again. This time he would be more careful. He had to be.
Sam shrugged. He didn't want to hurt Lucifer's feelings by bringing up Michael. He knew it was a sore subject. "He doesn't want me to go."
But where the hell was he supposed to start? They'd already covered their usual investigations. Strange behavior, search different places for clues... There wasn't much left to do. Except for maybe... Was there something they'd forgotten about that had helped them the last time they were sorta here? Dean didn't remember, it had been so long ago. Balthazar, a spell with a bone of a saint and some other crap, that douchebag angel following them, the keys to Balthazar's weapons, Misha, Misha's death, annoying crew members... Was he missing anything?
It was strange though, the world subtly starting to turn a little bit. At first he didn't notice and when he did it was too late. He drank another glass of water in an attempt to keep him focused but it was almost like it had the exact opposite effect. The colors, the people, the music, everything was fading, numbing. He tried to find an explanation but he couldn't think of one and honestly, he didn't even care anymore. All he could remember was that he loved Jess and loved dancing with Jess and didn't want this night to end.
That really made the other boy break into a grin. Cas gave a slow nod and finally looked down for a second. "I'm not sure," he admitted. "I'm not very used to this..." He raised his fingers and made quotation marks. "... 'going out'."
Sam really started to freak out right now. "Crowley, what..." he started, just as Crowley opened the door and pushed him out in front of him.
Sam couldn't help but smile at the adorableness of Lucifer's pouting face. Never had he expected to become friends with someone like Lucifer. If it had been anyone else, he'd have probably already become irritated at someone disturbing the library's quietude and peaceful atmosphere. But now... there was something about Lucifer that made it impossible for him to get mad at the guy.
"Dean, are you sure everything's alright?" Michael sighed. "You've been acting weird... well, all day actually."
"I... No," he quickly said. "Of course not. He wouldn't do that. Right?" Why was the insecurity suddenly eating its way through his brain?
At once, Gabriel jumped back into that whole smart-ass shell of his. "Easy. I've still got some stuff up my sleeve to convince him. All you gotta do is help me lure him out so he'll actually talk to me."
Sam nodded and ran up the stairs. When he was about halfway, he called, "You haven't answered my question yet!"
Adam gave him a comforting smile. "I've seen you play in the Pukwudgie common room a couple of times."
After the song had ended and they now all had an idea what the Hogwarts Houses were about, the lady opened a roll of parchment. "I'm Professor Hudson," she smiled at them. "Please sit on the stool and put on the Sorting Hat when I call your name. Bradbury, Charlie!"
Happy holidays, everyone! I suddenly remembered that last year I felt like I should have done a holiday chapter and thought I could do one this year butttt yeah that ain't happening xD Maybe one day in a different fic...
The guard smiled at him coldly. "Nice try." Then his gaze moved to Dean's left. "Is this man with you, Mr. Crowley?"
"Trust me, I don't understand either," Dean agreed. "Trying to break up Sam and Lucifer, messing with me... What's in it for him? Not to mention what he did to Sammy when you guys just got here."
Sam just rolled his eyes and decided it would be better for both of them to change the subject. "So when did you get this place?"
"But..." He was about speechless really. He hadn't expected to be playing for the entire semester. "Are you sure? I mean, will that be okay with the team? Shouldn't I talk to them first?"
As he said it, Dean saw something flashing through his eyes. It was quick but he'd seen it and pulled up his eyebrows in surprise. "You're afraid of him."
When the school bell announced lunch time, Sam told Kevin to go ahead while he went to Dean's locker. His brother had texted him during second period to ask if they could talk in private for a minute. Even though he was definitely surprised by the request, Sam hadn't hesitated for a second. If Dean needed him for whatever it was, he'd be there.
"Yeah, I pretended till I heard him leave the house," Dean sighed, dropping down on a chair. There had been only so much not-Cas he could take this early. "Did he happen to mention where we're supposed to go?"
"Anything. You would be a very boring example though, book smart, straight A's, hard worker, not much more to say really. Your friend, however," he turned to towards Sam, "is quite an interesting case."
Alright, time to abort before his brother really shut down. Sam would just have to wring him back into that conversation later. After all those years, he knew the routine of getting Dean to talk very well. And at that moment, the routine told him to change the subject for a while.
Now Dean really couldn't keep himself from smiling anymore. "Yeah well, we kinda decided that we... really like each other, you know?"
His friend shook his head as if Dean's suggestion was the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard and Dean simply couldn't understand why. Why wouldn't Michael want his family back together?
Gabriel and Castiel Novak came from a very big family. A very, very big family. Their adoptive father was absent most of the time so the kids had had to look out for themselves as well as each other. The problem was that in such a big family, with so many different personalities and without any form of authority, chaos quickly took over. Their siblings were always arguing with each other over the smallest of things. You'd think that without their five senses it would be harder for them to fight but it wasn't. On the contrary, it was an ideal situation to form alliances behind the other's backs and take advantage of each other's disabilities. Every so often things would get out of hand and someone got hurt, never severely but still. It had gotten even worse over the years and Castiel had been absolutely sick of it. He loved his siblings and seeing them fighting each other constantly like that was the most painful thing he'd ever felt.
Then he heard a small tick, as if something had been dropped at his feet, and he looked up. It was a lollipop. Apple flavor. He recognized the wrapper immediately, and he was almost shocked to find himself feeling... slightly comforted because of it. It was familiar and in the emotional roller coaster of his life, familiar was a relief. One thing was different though; this time there was a small piece of paper folded around the stick.
"Yes." After today that wasn't exactly true anymore, but he had a feeling Bobby wouldn't be very excited at him dating Lucifer. Besides, maybe he should come out in general first anyway.
Carefully at first, he allowed himself to relax into the kiss. It took him a couple of seconds but then he pressed his lips against the other man's. It was different from any other kiss he'd ever had - especially the beard - and yet for some reason he didn't mind. Without thinking about it, he was suddenly sliding his hands around Richard's waist, and he was surprised to find that all of...
"No, it doesn't," Sam answered without turning his eyes away from Charlie. "It takes requests into account."
Dean grinned despite himself. He couldn't tell if Cas really wasn't a morning person or if it was just part of his usual neutralness. "Morning, Cas."
Somewhere during his words Sam had started to feel like he couldn't breathe. It was like the air was stuck in his lungs and he was choking on his own tears. He desperately tried to inhale but he just couldn't and suddenly he was sobbing uncontrollably.
"Yeah!" Oh god, and now he was blushing. "That. Uhm so, I just thought we should probably talk about what that... meant and stuff."
to know Misha either, because trying to get to know the guy would mean he was investing in a future in this place, and Dean didn't want a future in this place. Maybe that wasn't fair towards Misha, but it wasn't fair to him either. He just wanted to go home, back to Cas, and Baby, and the bunker, and angels, demons, ghosts, and vampires. It only made sense that he wasn't excited to be here, so why the hell was Misha making him feel so guilty?
"No way!" Dean replied excitedly. If he hadn't been sure about his choice of friends before, he sure was now. "I'm a Chaser. And you too, Michael, right?"
After some attempts Mrs. Drover managed to get everyone seated and started class. As usual Dean lost his focus after about five minutes, so he started examining his new classmates. Besides Balthazar and the silent guy next to him there were three others. A couple of chairs to his left two guys, one of them slim and tall, the other one a little bit broader, were seated next to each other. And at the front row sat a girl with brown put up hair, who was wearing, and he wasn't kidding, a woman's suit. Seriously. What was wrong with this family?
The road ended in a small parking lot on the western shore of Kansas River, and even though the river wasn't anything special, the unobstructed view and rustling sound of the water, far away from the main roads, made it more than worth it. Dean came to a stop right in front of the water edge and turned off the engine.
Sam made sure not to look too surprised at that. He knew all too well what that place meant to Dean. And how few people he took there. He managed to keep a straight face though. "Cool."
Dean frowned and shook his head, not understanding what his little brother was trying to say. "What do you mean?"
Gabriel just looked at him for a second, then dropped his head in despair and rolled his eyes. "I swear, it's like talking to a brick wall." He walked around Sam and went to sit on the corner of one of the desks. "Look, I know this is hard to hear and you don't like me and that's fine. Don't even have to trust me. But if there's even a tiny piece of you that has doubts or questions, you deserve the answers to them. And for the record, I do hope I'm wrong. I don't want to hurt you, Sam, I'm trying to help you here. Deep underneath his temper tantrums, Lucifer's a good person and I even really believe he cares about you. But something tells me you give him more than he's willing to offer. You wanna know how I know that?"
That did it. Sam didn't know where he found the strength but he dashed out of the room and grabbed his stuff. He couldn't think, he was too busy trying to keep breathing, but he did know that he had to get out, now.
he thought to himself while their teacher started talking. It had been way too long since he and Kevin had hung out and he was looking forward to it already. He had a boyfriend, an amazing best friend, now all he had to do was fix things with his brother and then everything would be back to normal. Sam needed normal after all the drama they had gone through lately, but luckily that would all be over soon. Dean just had to get his head out of Michael's ass, give Lucifer a chance and then everything would turn out alright. He smiled to himself as he started to pay attention to class.
The fact that Ellen, the owner, and her daughter Jo joined them after a while made it all the better. Sure, for a couple of months there had been some tension between Lisa and Jo, because Jo and Dean used to have something going on between them before he got back together with Lisa, but in the end the girls had resolved their differences and now they actually got along really well. And that sure as hell was a good thing, because Sam didn't think Ellen and Jo would ever disappear from their lives.
He looked at Gabriel and saw the other boy's fingers hovering over the keys for a couple of seconds. He started to type, stopped, started again. Then he glanced up and met Sam's eyes. Sam gave a little smile in response.
Since he was officially out of ideas and couldn't reach Sam, Dean didn't know what to do with himself the rest of the evening. Misha cooked again and it was lovely, which Dean told him in an effort to make up for his crappy behavior. His husband thanked him but barely talked to him otherwise during the meal, and Dean concluded his attempt had failed. He shouldn't care. He hardly knew Misha. He didn't even
"They better not be," Lucifer playfully grumbled. Then he put another step closer and his voice dropped to a whisper. "How about we go back to my place after school to celebrate?"
Gabriel just raised the glass at him before he took a sip. He wasn't in a mood for talking. Of course he could have just asked Mercury to help him. The bartender had seen him at it plenty of times, so he would know exactly what Gabriel was looking for. But where was the fun in that?
Dean had been thinking, a lot, and he thought he might actually want to see where this could go. Kissing Cas had been... well, pretty amazing to be honest. He was almost ready to admit to himself that he would like to do it again. But was he really up for something more? See, this was why he needed Cas, he would find a way to make sense of Dean's emotions, he always did.
Hi there! If you've already come across this story before, you're probably thinking to yourself right now, "Wait, a second chapter? I thought this was going to be a one-shot?" Well, I've got two words for you: Me. Too. But as usual, I couldn't help myself and this story ended up waaaay longer than I intended it to be. So, that's why I'm finally splitting it up in a few chapters instead!
"Yeah," Sam said, shaking his head. He still could hardly believe it. "Whoever made this must be incredibly handy."
Still it was enough to make John feel guilty and he started to uncomfortably stutter, "Oh. Right. Uhm... well, you could join too of course but... I mean, we only need one captain..."
Okay, so that may have hit a nerve. Glaring angrily, Dean told him, "Yes. My dad's out a lot, doing his job. Yes, we don't see him that often and yes, he probably doesn't take care of us the way he should, but he
Eventually, Dean said, "So what's today's plan? We can hang out some more if you want. Just let me know when you want to go home and-"
"We've been in the same class and House for over three years now," he attempted to dodge the question.
Dinner with Ellen and Jo was nice, even though Dean wouldn't stop giving him these examining looks. Sam knew Dean knew something had been going on in his life. His brother had stopped asking questions though, but for some reason that only worried Sam even more. It wasn't like he didn't want to tell Dean, he was just waiting for the right moment. That was all. He'd get there. Eventually.
Luckily for him, Cas still had a good grip on his shoulder and managed to kinda sorta hold him upright when he landed on the floor.
Sam definitely hadn't been expecting that. Did he want to take revenge on Lucifer? He was hurt for sure, but he also didn't want even more drama...
Sam had been dreading the next Monday ever since he'd gotten home, and by the time Dean actually pulled into the school's parking lot, his mind hadn't changed.
He smiled thankfully at his older brother. With Dean by his side Sam knew he'd always be okay, no matter what.
"Don't worry about it, man. We still got-" Still smiling, Dean looked at his watch. "- two whole minutes before first class."
Lucifer interrupted his thoughts by cupping his cheeks and smashing their lips together almost desperately. Sam kissed him back on instinct more than anything else, the thought of what had just happened almost slipping from his mind. He didn't know how long they remained that way. It could've been second or hours of tasting, nipping at each other's lips.
They arrived at their stop and got off, saying their goodbyes to one another as they headed into different directions.
He really hadn't meant to remind his brother of Jessica, let alone insinuate that Sam was over her already. Dammit, he'd loved that girl like a sister himself.
He only realized Dean was talking to him when his brother put a hand on his shoulder. "... okay? Sam? Sammy? Hey, you listen to me, Sam, it's gonna be okay, alright? I know it hurts but you're gonna be okay. I'm right here for you, Sammy."
Gabriel huffed and took the seat next to her. "Please. You know I will always find you." Without turning away from her, he motioned Mercury over again. Sight or no sight, Kali wasn't one you just took your attention off of.
"Then what?" Misha urged on, and he walked around the counter and came to sit next to Dean, his blue eyes full of concern now.
Eventually, Lucifer pulled back a tiny bit, leaving just enough room between their mouths for him to whisper against Sam's lips. "Don't you dare apologize."
It was a never-ending point of discussion. Sam had been offered both the Thunderbird and the Horned Serpent and he'd chosen the latter. And his family still wondered why. Well, the truth was Sam had chosen his own path instead of following the family tradition. It wasn't like their dad disapproved of him being a Horned Serpent, it just hadn't been what he expected or hoped for. Both their parents came from a family of proud Thunderbirds. They'd met at Ilvermorny and been together ever since, till the day their mother died at least. Their dad had wanted his boys to continue the family legacy, for them to stick together and be a family, to honor their mom and everything she represented. So even though, after a lot of fights, everyone had finally come to turns with the situation Sam had put them in, sometimes it still rose to the surface to cause trouble.
Gabriel - or Richard, whatever - was standing in the doorway. "Guys, what the hell?!" he exclaimed in shock. "We need to start recording in five and you're not even dressed yet!"
"Well, take it from someone who knows what they're talking about, you might want them around for as long as you can. Otherwise you're gonna regret it afterwards," Dean said, causing Castiel to give him a curious look. "My parents died," he explained.
Even if any of them noticed Sam staring, they didn't pay any attention to him in the slightest. They just walked past him, and, to be fair, all of the other students watching, towards the cafeteria. Sam's eyes were still following them when Lucifer approached him and he finally snapped out of it.
"Hello?" he called out, even though he was pretty sure he hadn't heard anyone come in while he was on the toilet. "Is somebody there?"
"Yes, of course I'm scared of him!" Crowley yelled. "Have you met the guy? Any person with a little bit of common sense would be! Lucifer Shurley is a living nightmare!"
"Sam, I-" Dean sighed and started over. "I'm just trying to look out for you, okay? If Lucifer hurt you-"
After yelling who knew how many 'cut!'s, Richard decided to call it a day. His cap was dangling from the back of his chair and his hair was tousled from the amount of times he'd desperately run his hands through it. "Okay, that was... alright enough." He got up and started gathering his things while looking at them with a smile Sam was pretty sure wasn't entirely genuine. "But hey, don't worry about it. We all have our bad days. You know what, how about next week after we're done, we come back to some of this stuff, alright?"
Dean kept an eye on his ex-boyfriend until he disappeared out of sight and Sam felt like he could breathe again. That was it then, he'd seen Lucifer again and he'd survived. It hadn't gone much worse than he'd expected. No one had gotten hurt. Nobody had fought. Lucifer hadn't tried to talk to him, just acted like he didn't care, which Sam had already known. Yet, none of that made him feel any better.
He'd offered to give her a ride to school a million times but she always used to say she liked the short walk, not wanting them to have to make a detour, as short as it may have been. At this hour she should already have left to make it in time. But who knew how long the house had been on fire before they arrived?
The curious squint reappeared. Then Cas seemed to decide and said, "I'd like to see your house and watch a movie."
After a couple of seconds Sam decided to give up. "Fine," he sighed. "I'll bite. Why are you in my personal space?"
Okay, what the hell was happening on Sunday? Sam let out a nervous laugh. "Yeah, that's true. Thanks, Clif."
Dean arrived at the park only ten minutes after school had ended. Sam would be at Kevin's, so he didn't have to drop him off first. He strolled around a bit, suddenly becoming nervous, before deciding he needed to calm his shit and sitting down on one of the benches.
His brother looked up and came to stand next to him. "M and J?" he frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?"
His friend returned the gesture. They enjoyed the quietude for a couple of seconds and when Cas spoke again, he sounded different, less certain in a way. Almost... more human, as weird as that seemed.
The other boy turned about fifty shades of red at what Lucifer was implying alone before he managed to say, "Fine. We can order pizza."
Gabriel laughed at him. "Whoa, don't remember reading that yet. Guess I have a bit more studying to do before next week. But hey, so good of you to take them through in advance."
"You were right," he managed in a soft voice. "You, Bobby, Michael, freaking Gabriel, you were all right all along."
"Our ignorance?" he huffed. He didn't know who this kid was but he certainly had guts. Which was a nice way of saying he was just being rude actually.
Sam had barely closed the front door when Lucifer turned him around and pinned him against it. He pressed their lips together in a hungry kiss, the kind that seemed to turn Sam's legs to jelly every time it happened. His breath hitched in his throat as Lucifer's tongue invaded his mouth almost aggressively, caressing Sam's before pulling back a bit. He groaned against his boyfriend's lips, from lust but also in annoyance at the sudden loss of warmth. He could feel the corners of Lucifer's mouth turn up into a cocky smirk before the other boy surprised the hell outta Sam by placing his mouth around Sam's bottom lip and sucking it in. A shiver of pleasure ran down his spine and when that same arrogant mouth was replaced by Lucifer's teeth biting his lip, he thought he'd lose it. He pushed forward and wanted to kiss the life out of this guy that made him feel things he'd never felt before, but Lucifer wasn't one to give up control that easily. He pushed right back at Sam, pressing his body against the younger boy's to keep him in place. It was only then that Sam felt exactly how excited Lucifer was. His heart started hammering in his chest at the very obvious bulge against his lower abdomen and Sam could've sworn he was able to hear the rushing of his own blood in his ears. As if all of that wasn't bad enough, Lucifer seemed to be quite aware of the effect he was having and even took it a little further. The kisses became fiercer, the pace was picked up and suddenly Lucifer's hands dropped from his shoulders to his waist, where they tormentingly slowly crept underneath Sam's flannel and eventually his shirt. Sam gasped for air as cold fingers touched his warm skin, and his muscles tensed against Lucifer's body. Every fiber of his being was set on fire, longing for more, and he didn't know how to handle it. He wanted this, he
"Listen," he decided to start over, "I don't wanna ask you to pick a side. Michael is your brother, I understand that you're loyal to him and I respect that. But you shouldn't just blindly do what he says, Cas, you deserve to make your own choices and I just..." He shrugged and bit down on his lip. "I just wanted you to know that our friendship? It means a lot to me and I... Of course I'm not gonna force you to choose or anything, but what I'm trying to say here is just... Don't make me lose you, too."
"Dean, why don't you ask your boyfriend here if you can borrow some money?" Crowley tormented him. "Everybody knows they have plenty."
That was the moment Sam's phone started ringing and he almost jumped at the vibrations in his pocket.
Dean slammed the door of the Impala, got his phone out and quickly sent Lisa, Benny, Charlie and Jo a text to meet up. He hoped at least some of them would be able to make it this last-minute.
Dean had had his fair amount of family trouble. His mom had died, his dad was gone most of the time, and he'd been responsible for a pretty big part of Sammy's upbringing, but none of that compared Chuck Shurley, the man who had left over twenty children with nothing more than a big house and a pile of cash. Not even a goodbye. He had been dead serious when he'd told Cas he'd go with him on his search for his father, just to teach him a lesson. Cas deserved better than Chuck, better than Michael too, and all of his other asshole siblings. Dean wished he could do something to help him but it seemed like every time he got involved with the Shurleys, it blew up in his face. Well, except for Cas himself maybe but even that had been pretty tricky so far.
After dinner it quickly started to get late, so Bobby left and Sam and Dean went upstairs to their shared bedroom after saying their dad goodnight.
But Dean held himself back. For all he knew there was a good reason for not going through with it yet. Although Dean could hardly think of anything that would be disturbing about talking to your boyfriend's brother. Probably to do with another one of those huge Shurley dramas. He was really getting tired of dealing with those.
He had to admit it gave him a strange sense of satisfaction to see Dean's eyes practically pop out of his head.
He knew he would have to be very careful in his approach if he wanted some answers. "Hey, you never told me. How were things with Cas?"
Sam tried to cover up his flustered face by rolling his eyes. "I've got homework. And I know for a matter of fact that you do too. So," he leaned forward and pecked him on the lips with a grin, "I'll see you tomorrow."
There were others too. But things hadn't worked out with Sarah either, Amy and him were just kids, Ruby had been a dreadful mistake and Madison... If Sam didn't known any better, he'd say he was cursed, desperately trying to find something he couldn't have.
He actually liked her and that was something that didn't happen very often. Still, he'd convinced her she could possibly be his soulmate and now that it was clear she wasn't, there really was no point in staying together.
"Because I needed to talk to you," Gabriel simply said. "And I couldn't exactly do it myself, always having my big bro around. Michael's already paranoid enough as it is."
Sam quickly looked away to hide the blush crossing his face. As soon as he'd caught his breath again he pretended to be offended. "What's that supposed to mean?"
Of course Lucifer didn't have that problem. The boy went to stand in front of him, shook his head playfully and closed the space between them. "Sam Winchester, I'm gonna do anything I want with you." And with that he grabbed Sam by the collar and pulled him in.
"Then why?" he shot back, angry tears finally escaping his eyes. "If you don't care about me, then what was the point?"
There weren't any plants on the porch, so of course he checked the doormat first. There was nothing underneath that though.
"Wow," Michael said, sounding almost... disappointed? "You know, Dean, of all people I honestly thought you'd understand. I thought you were like me."
Just when he started debating calling his brother, he got a text that made his eyes nearly pop out of his head.
Castiel supposed he might as well go first. "My name is Castiel. I was adopted by Chuck Shurley at a very young age. I have three adoptive brothers, Michael, Gabriel, and Samandriel of course." He paused for a moment and frowned. "What else should I say?"
He put his hand on Lucifer's shoulder and said, "Hey, look at me." He waited until the Shurley's eyes eventually met his. "I'm not like everybody else, okay? I want to hear your side. I'll believe you."
"Oh believe me, Crowley, I know fear when I see it," Dean said and something started to dawn on him. "That's why you wanted Michael to keep him at bay, isn't it? You're scared of him. He's not just threatening your business, he has the power to overrule it. You didn't want him near it, because you knew that if it came down to fight, he would win!"
His brother just pushed past him without answering. He pulled out a fifty and held it up between two fingers, right in front of Crowley's face.
Sam could barely believe his eyes, his jaw dropping. Anyone who was watching him probably thought he was crazy.
The older boy didn't seem bothered by it at all though. He just kept smiling like usual. "Did I scare you, Sammy?" he asked in a teasing voice.
Because let's get one thing straight, Sam hadn't had sex before. Ever. Not once in his sixteen years. And he wasn't sure if he was ready to start now.
The Shurley boy's smile grew bigger. "Of course. What kind of friend would I be if I ditched for something so stupid?"
Sam looked back at the other boy, who was still seated on the couch. He went to join him again and took his mug from the coffee table. "Thanks."
Dean looked at him in shock. "Wait, Michael? I only met the guy two minutes ago! And who is Zachariah?"
"See, the thing is," Dean started, clearing his throat, "you know how I've been hanging out with Cas a lot lately, right?"
Sam let out a laugh. "Are you sure you want to go with me? I mean, I probably end up burning down the house or something."
Had they had a fight? Dean didn't look angry though, or sad for that matter. Because his brother wasn't much of a talker, Sam had learned to read him well early on in life, and he was hardly ever wrong. And right now, Dean seemed... confused.
Sam replied, hoping that the emoji would make it sound a little less harsh. Admittedly, he was only half joking.
It seemed like Kevin wasn't going to give him that chance though, because a couple of minutes later he called Sam. There wasn't much of a choice left now. If he didn't pick up, Kevin would probably be even less likely to give up. So, he answered.
Sam licked his lips nervously. His mouth had suddenly become dry. "Hey. Can we talk?" he carefully asked.
Charlie looked at him as if she'd never been happier. "Color looks good on you," she commented and Jo had to muffle a snort with her hand.
"Not really," she shrugged. "How about the three of you just give me a proper introduction of yourselves?"
Lucifer got up and together they walked back to the car. They both had trouble keeping a straight face when they saw the couple inches of water standing in it. Lucifer walked to the driver's seat as seriously as possible and casually jumped in. When he sat down, water ran out of the seat. Sam got in as well and immediately felt the water invading his sneakers, up until that point the only thing on his body that had stayed dry a little bit.
After multiple attempts of opening his mouth and answering, he eventually blurted out the one reasonable excuse he could think of. "Maybe I just wanted to hear your voice."
"What are you talking about?" Dean asked, concern in his voice. Whatever it was, Michael was clearly upset about it.
Obviously he didn't get a reply but he didn't move anyway. There was nowhere else for him to go. He lay down in the grass, his head next to the shiny headstone, before taking out his phone and sending two texts.
He wasn't wrong. The place was pretty modern, with a couple peculiar touches to it. There was a series of hooks on the wall that looked handmade, all of them from different materials. The walls were white but the ceiling was painted with organic patterns. It was only details but they gave a whole different dimension to the space.
"Oh, yeah, fine, I uhm..." Why was it that Dean's brain seemed to stop working every time he was talking to his supposed husband? "I was just wondering about something. You don't happen to know if uh, Richard has been acting a bit off lately, right?"
For a moment, the other side of the door remained quiet and Dean almost started to think Cas had left.
By the time Friday arrived, Dean was mostly finally starting to feel like himself again. Sure, he still had a long way to go before life would be back to normal but now that him and Cas were back on good terms and talking, he felt a lot better about the whole situation. Talking to Cas always helped him put things in perspective.
Sam kicked his brother below the table and Dean quickly cleared his throat. "Yeah. GISH. Of course."
"I guess I did," Lucifer brutally grinned and Sam felt a blush spread around his cheeks immediately.
Dean frowned. "That sounds a little bit... superficial, don't you think? You really think that's the only reason he asked you?"
He scanned the room one last time but couldn't find anyone that stood out to him. Sure, plenty of back-up plans, but there was no reason to settle for those already. He quickly finished his drink and got up from his stool, supposedly to go to the bathroom. Staying close to the bar, he continued to listen and occasionally clicked his tongue when he thought a seat was empty. He found another person drinking on their own and two women talking a bit more quietly.
"No, you've got Lucifer for that, right?" Okay, he wasn't going to lie about it; Dean couldn't help but grin as his brother remained silent.
He checked his phone again and just as he did, he saw Dean crossing the street, along with a guy in a tan trench coat. Sam pulled up his eyebrows in surprise. He was pretty sure he hadn't seen Dean's friend before.
"Then Lucifer left, and so did my father. Most of the bad got worse, most of the good..." He didn't have to finish his sentence for Dean to understand.
He tried to spot his friend in the cafeteria but couldn't find him. Dean, Benny, Charlie and Jo were at their usual table, but Lisa and Kevin were nowhere to be found.
"Are we having a conversation now?" Lucifer huffed. When Sam just shrugged, not knowing what else to do or say, he sighed. "Fine," he answered and then an evil grin appeared on his face. "I signed the contract as soon as I heard my loving father bought the mansion on Cross Road."
"It's fine," Lucifer told him with a little smile. He leaned back, giving Sam enough space to sit up straight again.
Dean looked up at that, caution in his eyes. "Who?" he asked slowly, and Sam was certain he was ready to close up again the second Sam mentioned Castiel.
"What are you smiling about? I'm still pissed at you," he announced, taking another pull from his beer.
Praying he wouldn't fall off and make this day even more disastrous, Dean did as he was told and climbed the toilet. The partitions were pretty high but he was rather tall for his age, so if he carefully leaned forward a bit, he had no problem looking over the top and into the cubicle on the other side.
"If it's any consolation, I've never known him to be very caring to anyone. But then again, we were never exactly close."
Sam offered his younger brother an apologizing smile. They all knew Adam had quite the thing for one of his classmates, even though he refused to tell them who exactly this mysterious boy was. They only knew Adam liked him but didn't really know him very well because the guy apparently spent most of his time with his family. But that was enough for Dean to tease him about it.
Sam sighed and pushed every thought of Lucifer from his mind as he sat down with his friends. As he did so, he happened to see Balthazar walk by, to a table with a couple of other Shurleys. One of them was Gabriel, hanging in his chair while he munched on a candy bar and clearly not interested in whatever his siblings were saying.
"You can get yourself out now," he said seemingly pissed but in reality he could hardly suppress a smile.
Dean sighed. "Yeah well... He got to you, Sammy. It was too late, you were already... you know. I get it."
Cas being too busy to answer the phone and only occasionally texting back and even seeming to avoid him at school, he understood. He could handle that, he had for the past few weeks. But he was not having any of this blatantly-and-consciously-ignoring-him-for-multiple-days stuff.
"Right," he quickly tried to explain himself. "Yeah of course, I mean, I was just... I don't know..."
he typed and hit 'send' before pocketing his phone again. When he looked up, he could see Cas smiling at his screen and something inside of Dean sent a warm feeling through his body.
He let out a sigh at the mention of his brother. "Not really, no. He's still besties with your brother so..."
"Oh by the way, Jensen, Misha asked me when we'd be finished, so he's coming to pick you up," Richard added when he'd finished packing.
"No, it's okay," Misha stopped him but despite his words, he sounded hurt. Dean's heart sank into his stomach. The way Misha's voice had dropped and the look on his face... In that moment, the only thing that differentiated him from Cas was a forced little smile.
"You know what," he eventually said, "Let's go. Dean doesn't tell me what to do. And it's just a club."
Dean rolled his eyes and cursed himself for being so obvious. "Just gonna meet with a friend," was all he said.
Adam seemed to be doing his very best to glare his oldest brother to death while responding, "So what if he is?"
"Well, it's not. Trust me." He pulled a notebook out of his backpack and ripped out a sheet. "I'm leaving Sam a note on the counter telling him to give you a call in case he gets home before me. If not, I'll call you back, alright?"
Michael rolled his eyes at him and mumbled he should have known. Dean couldn't help but laugh at him.
Sam tried to follow him as subtly as possible, which was a lot harder than he'd thought. He managed to keep track of him long enough though to see him getting something from his pocket and then throwing it without stopping to someone near the lockers.
Sam bit his lip, thinking about Lucifer's words. He was right. When was the last time he'd done something simply because he enjoyed it? Since Jess... jesus, he couldn't even remember what enjoying something felt like.
And now the old Sammy seemed to be back, or at least a little bit of him, but Dean would gradually take it. Hell, he felt like he had never been so relieved in his whole life.
, he signed before going back to the Impala to drive to the University of Kansas. He dropped Sam off, waved goodbye and then headed to the garage he worked at. One day he wanted his own garage but right know he needed all the money to support his family and to pay for Sam's education.
That first day Dean had convinced their dad to allow him to stay home from school. His brother even tried to get him the day off on Friday too but John wouldn't have it. Yes, he understood what his youngest son was going through, probably better than anyone else since he'd lost their mother and the love of his life too, years ago. Still, Sam needed to stay strong. He couldn't just give up, he had to keep fighting, no matter how hard it was.
After they'd hung up, Dean had been walking around the room for more than half an hour apparently, because when he finally snapped out of it at the sound of his phone, it was about 8pm. Lisa was calling him.
"Alright." The director slung his bag over his shoulder. "See ya tomorrow at the concert, Jensen." His eyes shifted towards Sam. "And I'll see you tonight." And with that he started to walk away from them.
Dean ran his hands through his hair while pacing back and fro. He had to fix this. Take care of the giant mess he had made now and forever. "Cas, you have to help me," he begged in despair. "I've ruined everything, please help me put it right!"
When the guy desperately started yelling reversal spells, all in vain of course, Gabriel started to feel the tiniest bit bad for him. "Don't bother, buddy," he sighed. "That won't work. It's all homemade, so only I know how to reverse it."
Sam was smart enough to know this wasn't the time to talk and just did as he was told. When he was done, the both of them just stood there waiting for Bobby in silence.
"Seriously though, you actually want to meet him?" the younger one asked. He was having trouble believing it.
It wasn't really a big deal of course, like he was the only one in the entire school doing it. On the contrary, most of the time he would be one of the few students
Lucifer nodded, before changing the subject. "Hey, you wanna hang out after school?" He smiled. "I could finally show you my place. It's not much but I've wanted to for some time now."
"What if he isn't?" Sam urged. In only a few minutes, his mind had gone over this again and again and again. "What if he's somehow still alive? Or his grace ended up in this universe instead of the Empty? Maybe he doesn't even know who he is anymore and just ended up taking Richard as a vessel or something!"
Dean raised his hands. "I know, alright? I know but, Sam, we're not the people they're coming to see!"
He gnashed his teeth but stopped before his brothers could notice. He'd basically been living with Lucifer for six years now. He should be happy he got a break from it. And yet something kept nagging at him when he watched that arrogant smirk strode towards the table at the far left.
He knocked against the door but it merely trembled a bit in its hinges. He tried another time, putting all of his weight behind the blow. Nothing. Normally, he would try to kick the door open but with the actual toilet right behind him there wasn't enough room in the cubicle.
"Since I know you have just passed a long journey, I will keep it short. First of all, I would like to congratulate you for being chosen to join us in the first international exchange program between Hogwarts and Ilvermorny. My staff members and I are very excited to welcome you in our home and look forward to what we hope will be a successful undertaking. Just like we would normally do with our first-year students, you will be sorted into one of Hogwarts' four Houses. After that you can all enjoy the banquet with your new House members and after dinner our Prefects will lead you to your common rooms. They will provide you with all of the information you need to start your classes tomorrow. But before that I would like to hand the floor over to Mr. Charles Shurley, President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America!"
"So are you two from Kansas?" Dean asked and Castiel was grateful for his attempt to start conversation.
Sam let out a sarcastic laugh. "And the only way to do that was by terrorizing my brother? How about next time you just come over and start a conversation, like
, the one person who never backed off? He read back their conversation to see if anything he'd sent could have come across differently than he'd meant it to. Was it because he'd said he was a fool for talking to Gabriel? It didn't seem very likely since the guy had hardly seemed fazed by Sam saying he wasn't nice either. If he were crazy, Sam might have thought the other boy had somehow read his mind and was insulted by that.
Dean sighed and got out his wallet. "I want my brother back." He handed Crowley a twenty with a deadly look on his face.
"I'm ready," he said, coming to a stop in front of Castiel, completely out of breath. He held his satchel in one hand and fidgeted with his white stick with the other.
"It's not that big a deal, okay?" Dean was quick to say. Then he stopped for a moment. "I mean, it's... it's awesome, but... I mean, it's still..."
"And I'm not planning to," the oldest Shurley grumbled. "My family doesn't want anything to do with him anymore."
Dean rolled his eyes in annoyance but at least he dropped the subject. He put his elbow on the windowsill and looked outside, taking in the unfamiliar surroundings. Eventually, he said, "No matter what House we're getting in, we're sticking together, alright? We're family."
"Maybe I should put you back in your place," Lucifer said in a playful voice, but he did put a step closer to him.
He shrugged and shook his head. "It doesn't matter. I would've probably found out one way or another. The thing is from that moment on I started questioning everything. Me, him, our behavior, our feelings, other people's behavior and feelings. Hell, I dragged my brother out of a club at Friday, because Michael told me Lucifer was using him."
"Lucifer," Sam managed to get out. When the other boy didn't seem to react to it, he tried again, a little hastier this time, "Lucifer. Lucifer, hold- hold on for a second, alright?"
"I know," his brother answered. "We just gotta be patient until we get a chance to do some research. Then hopefully we can find out what exactly is going on and how to fix it."
"Of course not!" Lisa said and got in the passenger seat. "You are just being an amazing brother, Dean."
For the first time, Gabriel avoided his gaze and he bit his bottom lip. "Well, you're not gonna want to hear it but you gotta believe me when I say I'm just trying to help."
Crowley sighed dramatically. "Well, if you're asking, let's just say my business is a little bit... threatened."
Sam saw the smoke even before he heard the sirens. He quickly nudged his brother, a ball of fear tightening in his stomach. It couldn't be...
Dean seemed to be thinking the same thing because they exchanged another look and Dean nodded. They could do this. Maybe.
He honestly didn't know how to answer that without ruining the moment or moving too fast, but apparently he didn't have too because he got a second text.
The moment his eyes had met Lucifer's he'd known. This was all just a game for the bastard. He didn't care that he'd hurt Sammy and he didn't care if Dean would come after him. That little smile on Lucifer's face as he looked at Dean made him think that the guy would actually quite enjoy it. He'd had those two girls next to him and ready within a second. Dean didn't think he wanted to know what that meant...
Crowley turned to him in shock. "You did this to me?!" he roared and Gabriel had to admit that if he'd been any less of a wizard, he probably would've actually felt intimidated by it.
Dean sighed and turned to Michael, without letting go of his girlfriend. "Nope. I tried everything but he just wouldn't."
Sam decided it would probably be better to not ask what exactly Misha was talking about. He was afraid he'd find out sooner or later anyway.
He groaned inwardly and continued his story. "I did. I do, I guess. I became very... self-conscious. Tried to convince myself it was all in my head, which it clearly wasn't. From time to time there were these... situations when we would just look at each other and then..." Dean shrugged. He wasn't that great at talking about his feelings. "He just understood me, you know."
"Wait," he said, suddenly remembering something. "At the party you told me you'd heard him talk about me with one of your other brothers."
"No of course not!" Dean said without thinking even a second about it. He didn't want to think a second about it.
"Wow Sammy, never took you for the sneaky type," Lucifer said with a playful grin and pulled up eyebrows, making Sam swallow loudly. The Shurley laughed at that. "Don't worry, I'm just messing with you." And with that he started walking.
Yeah, maybe it was a good idea to lighten the mood a little. Sam got up as well and followed him. "How do you feel about Hawaiian?"
"Of course you are," Sammy answered and no matter how hard he was trying to hide it, Dean could still see the ridiculous grin on his face.
Even though he was relieved that it hadn't come to a fight, Sam was still glad to have Dean right by his side when Lucifer casually walked on. As he passed them, he shot Sam a smile that made his stomach turn, and for a moment he thought Dean was going to punch him in the face after all. For a second, Sam almost wished he did. Maybe he would hurt less if Lucifer did too.
Lucifer seemed to be satisfied with that. "Good. Now, why don't you come over after school so we can work on the enjoying part a bit more, huh?"
"This place seems nice," he commented and Castiel couldn't help but blush. 'Nice' was a very big complement for the building.
Oh, how much he would've liked to throw a punch at the guy right then and there. But Dean wasn't stupid. It was five to one, even if Cas didn't join his siblings' side. So instead he gritted his teeth and looked back at his friend one last time, hoping for something, anything. But Cas was still avoiding his eyes, literally looking everywhere but at Dean. His sister Hannah had put a hand on his shoulder and Dean knew he'd lost.
"Well, there's gotta be a reason you're sneaking up on me, so spit it," he said, leaning against his locker.
Just as he was about to open the door of his car, a familiar voice called out his name and he froze in place. He took a deep breath before turning around to see Cas hastily make his way towards him, trench coat flying around his legs.
"No, it's fine," Lucifer quickly said. "You go have fun." He smiled along with it but Sam noticed the gesture didn't really reach his eyes.
Dean quickly glanced over his shoulder and saw her jaw drop as she read his text. He snickered softly when he noticed her fingers automatically wanting to type something back and stopping when she realized she couldn't. Of course Charlie heard him and looked up in annoyance before mouthing,
settled, I would like to make one last announcement for our home students. As you may have already noticed, two of our teachers have joined the group that has been elected to attend Ilvermorny. They will be replaced by the American teachers Professor Robert Singer, who will teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Professor Metatron Shurley, who will not only take over the Astronomy classes but also the function of the Head of Ravenclaw. And then I will now leave you to enjoy your meals."
He heard the movement of fabric and then the sound of the stall next to his opening. "Stand on the toilet seat. I'm going to help you over the partition."
"Hey," his boyfriend said, drawing his eyes back to him. He bent forward and grabbed the back of Sam's neck, pulling him towards him until their lips met.
Immediately Richard's expression softened and he sighed, taking another step towards him. "Why didn't you call me? I mean, I know I've been busy but I could've quickly come by to pick you up..."
Misha laughed at that and for a moment Sam was scared he'd said something wrong again. "Right," the other guy said, shaking his head. "You forget I know exactly what the two of you are like on set. I mean, I've been through enough of your pranks myself." He turned around, found them still at the threshold and pulled up his eyebrows. "Are you really still standing there? Come on, Jared, you know you can make yourself at home. Oh and honey, I'd put those in a vase if I were you," he added, pointing at the flowers.
As he talked, Dean could imagine Jensen and Jared on a stage, talking to the fans, joking around with people like Misha, Richard and that Rob guy. He wished his life were that easy.
"No, and I'd like to keep it that way. At least until Cas is ready to tell his family," Dean explained, sounding a little tired.
He could see his little brother slowly giving in and after a couple of seconds, Sam let out a sigh. "Alright. You win, I'm coming. But if Dad finds out..."
When he'd texted Sam to say he wouldn't be home for a couple more hours earlier, he'd also asked if his brother had talked to Lucifer yet. Not that Dean was so eager to spend time with someone who took Sammy to nightclubs but he knew it was important to Sam.
Fifteen minutes later Dean was standing next to his Impala, wondering what took his brother so long. There still were some students coming out of the school, but he'd expected Sam would be here sooner. He usually was.
He felt a tiny spark of hope when Sam slowly nodded. It wasn't much but at this point he'd gladly take it.
With everything that had happened, there was hardly any way Sam could deny that but he wasn't going to talk about it to the Trickster of all people.
Rolling his eyes, Sam answered, "Look, he was just being friendly. It's not like we're suddenly friends or something. I didn't just forget the crap he pulled."
Michael handed him the cups and Dean was just about to take them when he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket.
The Winchester rolled his eyes, but he couldn't help but smile as he followed his... well, boyfriend. Huh. Who would've seen that one coming?
"Talking about friends, how's Kevin doing?" Bobby changed the subject. "Haven't seen him in a while."
"What?!" Dean gasped but the principle was already leaving. So he just turned to his little brother with a look that just about screamed,
"Sister, are we having a problem here?" a voice from behind him suddenly interfered and Dean was almost happy he didn't need to make the awkward silence even worse himself.
If it was an emergency, then what were they waiting for? And if Crowley cared enough to come get him, why did he now seem so indifferent? Anyway, if Dean really needed him, he was obliged to go with him.
Sam grinned widely and shoved him as he stepped into the car. "I was talking to Lisa," he defended himself.
"I liked that kiss too," he admitted, and Cas's lips curled up into a smile that made it all worth it.
He did know that he was really fricking angry though. To think that he'd been willing to give Lucifer a chance, all for Sam, while Michael was right all along. Well, "right" was maybe a bit of an overstatement. Dean hadn't forgotten the way Michael had treated him just because he thought his dad was some sort of saint.
"You play?" Dean grinned. He'd been hoping he would be able to join a team here but he hadn't even been sure if Hogwarts played Quidditch.
He looked Dean straight in the eye and for a moment the Winchester thought he was going to put his hand on his or something like that. Luckily, he didn't. So why did he feel a sting of disappointment?
Gabriel let out a sarcastic laugh and Dean frowned. "Yeah, right. Is that what you told him? That you 'unfriended' Michael?" the Shurley mocked.
"Adam Winchester," he smiled and felt surprisingly grateful she was reaching out to him. She reminded him a bit of Jo. "How did you... uhm..." He finished his sentence with a subtle nod towards the Shurleys.
Sam barely had time to process what had just happened before the Sorting Hat announced its decision.
Michael swallowed as he watched his fellow Wampus walk to the stool. Now that he knew what values the Houses represented, Michael had a feeling he knew which House he'd be sorted into. And he could also guess where Lucifer would end up.
His brother grumbled a bit more but then the both of them fell silent, wondering where they would end up this time. If Sam remembered correctly, this Jared Padalecki was married to Ruby's alter ego. Yeah, that was weird. If they were lucky, maybe they'd just go to his place again. Not that he was that excited about it but at least they knew how to handle that.
Dean just looked at him in shock, slowly processing what Michael had just said. When he was sure he'd heard that right, he carefully asked, "What do you mean he isn't here?"
"Thank you, Dean," Gabriel agreed while unfolding his white stick again. What, he could be polite if he wanted to.
It turned out there were quite a few. They discovered West and Maison Collins were Misha's children from his previous marriage with a woman named Vicki Vantoch. Apparently they'd split up pretty peacefully when Misha and Jensen finally admitted their feelings after years of working together. There was a lot of gossip about the situation but it seemed like Misha and Vicki were still close friends. Dean frowned at that. He didn't know why.
"Nothing," Dean answered in the same manner. "I'm going to my room. Call me when dinner's ready." And without another word he went up the stairs.
They were just trying to learn a bit more about Jared and Jensen when the door to the trailer slammed open. Sam and Dean jumped and out of instinct went for their guns, which they didn't have on them anymore of course.
In any other situation, those words would have probably been enough to make Dean's brain crash again. But he was still holding Cas and after that kiss, who the hell cared what it said about him. If "boyfriend" was the word that connected him to the boy in front of him, then he would gladly take it.
"Actually he did," Kevin answered. "I asked him to meet up, but he'd already made plans with Lucifer. They invited me to join them, but I didn't really feel like it."
Trying to put it out of his mind, he started the car and backed out, heading for the park. It was within walking distance but he'd prefer not to have to run across the entire town with Cas afterwards. For a second, the memory of Cas in the passenger seat of the Impala came back to him and the corner of his mouth turned up at the image.
Dean frowned at him. What was he talking about? He hadn't come down that fast, had he? "What do you mean?" he asked while sitting down.
But that didn't change the fact he got a very uncomfortable, tingly feeling every time he saw Michael. He wished Castiel had never told him how the other boy felt. He really shouldn't care this much but he did. Not about Michael being bisexual, hell he couldn't care less, but being the subject of it? It was just weird.
But he had agreed to it... Didn't that make him just as bad? Maybe he should go find Gabriel and tell him to cancel his weird schemes. But Gabriel had said he knew something that would make Sam change his mind. What if whatever it was wasn't true and they broke up because of it even though they did really love each other? Or worse, what if Dean made Gabriel stop and everything the Shurleys had said turned out to be true and Lucifer kept playing with Sam's feelings for months before he finally decided he'd had enough and his little brother was heartbroken about it? Dean didn't know if he could live with either.
Dean started pacing back and forth across the pavement while waiting for Crowley to return. Michael just remained silent, looking at him with a worried look on his face. It probably wasn't more than a couple of minutes, but it seemed like hours before the door finally opened and Crowley came out again. Alone.
"Yeah, me too," Dean sighed. He reluctantly let go of Cas, whose hand remained to linger on his shoulder for another second before he dropped it too. Dean missed the touch almost right away.
"I don't know what to do anymore. I used to be so sure about everything, my family, right and wrong, my purpose in life. I was going to go to college and join my father's company like everyone else. But being friends with you... It makes all of it so much more complicated."
When he walked into the house, he found Sam already sitting at the kitchen table, eating a bowl of cereal while reading the newspaper. He looked up when Dean entered and gave him a mocking smile before signing,
He found Balthazar, surprisingly, with Crowley and his friends, talking quietly to each other. They were too far off for him to able to hear what they were saying, so he tried to get a little closer. Just as he was almost within earshot, Crowley handed something to Balthazar and the Shurley walked away.
Lucifer tilted his head and looked at him, curiosity sparking in his eyes. "Why don't we go to your favorite place?"
"You gonna tell him?" Dean asked, worry filling his chest. Michael would not be happy with this and he didn't wanna get Cas into trouble...
"Of course, no problem," Michael said before getting back up. "I'll just wait for you at the parking lot."
He gave up and decided to go into one of the buildings to ask someone. He ran up the stairs and was just about to open the door when someone pushed it open, nearly hitting him in the face.
"You wanted to be placed in Ravenclaw," the boy answered. "You were right, the Hat does listen and you were prepared for that, you two actually seemed to have quite the talk. I'm pretty curious to what it told you but I'll guess that'll have to come later. Whatever it was, you were obviously excited about it. You were afraid of ending up in another House and wanted to avoid that at all costs. The question of course is why. Could be a strong preference for Ravenclaw or an aversion to its realistic competition, a House you would fit in but simply didn't want to join. So, what House? It wasn't Hufflepuff, you aren't even close to fitting in there because, good intentions aside, you are anything but innocent, you know it and you're not afraid to own that. The entire Great Hall could tell you aren't one to be messed with. Could've been Slytherin if you weren't so keen on helping others, even if it's in your own disadvantage. A funny contradiction really, presenting yourself as strong as you can, yet putting others before yourself. That leaves Gryffindor, which seems fair enough, you did just, directly or not, stand up to the Sorting Hat and you weren't afraid to approach me. So why the aversion? Can't be because of your friends, your brother is in Gryffindor and you two seem close enough. That means you were doing it for yourself, personally choosing Ravenclaw and putting Gryffindor aside, you've had to do something like that before. You're a Horned Serpent, know him better than her and he couldn't be anything else. Yet she's close to you, so probably a friend of your brother's, who is probably a Thunderbird too, not only because he is closer friends with her but also because of his challenging appearance and most importantly, your father is one. It would only make sense for the oldest son to want to step into his father's footsteps and I bet he loves being in the same House. He was also happy with his placement in Gryffindor, which would most likely be your father's House too. So, family of Thunderbirds, pretty sure you got the offer too, you fit the profile, and still you chose against it. Why? Easy. Horned Serpent fit you better, you didn't care about Thunderbird being the family tradition so you went for it. Still, you were awfully passionate about getting into Ravenclaw, while in fact Gryffindor would've suit you better than Thunderbird ever could. Stubbornness? Yes, probably too much for your own good if you ask me, but there's more to it. You were ready to fight for your decision, you were prepared because it wasn't the first time. Now, it couldn't have been the Ilvermorny sorting, that's pretty easy, the Houses volunteer, you pick. But you have had to defend your choice, not towards your older brother, he values the whole Thunderbird thing but you still get along more than most siblings, and neither your younger brother nor your friends, none of them having a reason to fight over it. That leaves only one option, your father. He wanted you to be a Thunderbird but you weren't and now you're choosing against Gryffindor out of mere stubborn refusal to walk in line and the desire to prove you are your own person. Did I get anything wrong?"
As he waited, guys came in and left again, but luckily none of them were Shurleys. Despite his best efforts to remain patient, Dean was about ready to jump out of his skin by the time Cas finally walked through the door though. Not that any of that mattered once he did. A little smile appeared around Cas's lips when he saw him, which in return immediately made Dean grin like an idiot.
"Only one I talk to," the guy said. "One year older. He's waiting for me at the bus stop, so I'm sorry if I'm going a little bit fast."
It wasn't like Dean didn't want to tell her. Cas and him were just friends, not exactly committing crimes together or something. But if Michael, or anyone of the Shurley siblings for that matter, ended up hearing, Cas would be in a shitload of trouble and Dean didn't want to put him through even more drama.
The two boys payed and left with their candy, giving Gabriel quite the view of Hot Guy's ass. It was only when they disappeared out of sight that he snapped out of it and went over to the cart.
The other guy looked away from him and for the first time Dean thought he could see something like doubt in his eyes. He watched in surprise as Gabriel, the overconfident boy that always had his answer ready, seemed to be looking for the right words.
It was only now that he noticed the bit of concern on Cas's face, even though he was still smiling a little. Right, he really was going to start making sense of his thoughts.
"Lucifer," Gabriel simply said and Sam knew he'd hit jackpot. Of course that was what this was about. He should've known. In the end, the Shurleys, they were all the same.
He immediately noticed the slightly hurt look on his brother's face. "Well yeah, but... I would've given you all the space you needed, Sammy, you know that."
Literally from the moment he stepped into the building, things started to go downhill. Somehow he didn't notice the floor of the main entrance was still wet. Already looking for Jess he didn't pay attention and before he knew it, he slipped and fell right onto his butt.
After a couple seconds he carefully looked back at Castiel. "How do you do it?" he asked, his voice almost a whisper.
He bit down on the piece of candy in his mouth and got up. Despite his weird behavior, Gabriel was right and he should be heading back in.
The longer he talked, the more excited Castiel seemed to get and Dean grinned at the usually so grave boy finally loosening up a bit. He actually found himself quite enjoying the change.
His eyes wandered a little further until they landed on the table the Trickster and his harem had apparently claimed. He frowned as one of the girls actually spoon-fed him some chocolate ice cream.
It was only when Bobby parked in front of their house that he spoke. "You want me to take her back with me?"
Sam would bet all of his college savings that that wasn't all. He knew better than to say it aloud though. "Well, he was nice. You should invite him more often."
As soon as Sam got out his phone, he checked the caller ID. Of course it was his brother. Still trying to catch his breath, he gave Lucifer a small smile before picking up. "Hi, Dean."
The corners of Sam's mouth turned up into a broad grin, his heart starting to hammer in his chest even faster. With one hand, he reached for the back of Lucifer's head, entangling his fingers those short, blond strands, and pulled him closer again in another loving kiss. Lucifer's tongue almost immediately found its way back into Sam's mouth and the Winchester loved the feeling of it. He spread his legs a bit further, allowing Lucifer to push down on him even more until it felt like every part of their body was touching the other. One of Lucifer's hands moved up to the back of his neck to play with his hair, while the other roamed down over Sam's chest, landing itself on the boy's hip.
Dean nodded, remembering what little Michael had told him about the black sheep of his family. Then something dawned on him. "Wait, so you're saying that Sammy's new bestie is the same guy your dad felt the need to kick out of the house?"
The Winchester bit his lip. He had never heard that name either. And honestly, he was kind of an expert... "Okay. Thanks, Kevin."
He'd had to look it up beforehand but now that he knew where to go, it wasn't that hard to find. It was a very small street in Old West Lawrence, so Dean had to park the Impala a couple of blocks further off. When he got out and made his way to the alley, it was already five and the mid-December sun had slowly started to set. He reached the alley that was situated in between two pretty large buildings, causing it to gloom even faster. Dean guessed there was maybe just enough room for one car. Or at least there would've been without the two dumpsters lining one of the walls. Taking a couple more steps, he frowned and his eyes wandered through the other than that empty lane.
During his search, he'd spotted someone else though. He pulled out his dad's old phone that was now serving as a back-up until he got a new one, and quickly sent a text.
Now Sam's face turned red so much and so quickly he didn't have the time nor a way to hide it. He had basically only heard one word.
Yeah, he wasn't believing a single word of that. "Why would he do that? I don't even know your name."
It started off normally, even better than normal actually. They had breakfast with their dad for the first time in months and the reunion of their family caused the both of them to be in a better mood than usual. Dean even stopped bitching all the time.
"Yeah, no kidding," he grumbled. He'd completely run out of ideas himself, so he prayed Cas would come up with something. And if the guy needed time to get there, Dean would be more than happy to give it to him.
The three of them looked at him, waiting in anticipation for a further explanation. When it didn't seem like they were gonna get any, Sam asked, "What is that?"
He sighed and walked in without giving it a second thought, heading towards his locker to pick up his books for first period. On his way he noticed his friends at Charlie's locker and he quickly gestured he'd join them soon. He caught himself keeping an eye out for Cas too, and his gaze quickly landed on the slightly smaller boy, just as surrounded by Naomi and his other siblings as usual. Maybe Dean would text him and ask if he wanted to go to the library again later. He thoughtlessly unlocked his locker, not hearing the soft click until it was too late.
"Fine," he sighed. "Well, the name is Adam Winchester clearly, I turn fourteen at the end of the month, I've got two older half-brothers, I wanna be a Healer and I like Quidditch."
"Sorry, did you wanna say something?" Sam asked, looking past his friend. He wasn't trying to pick a fight or anything. He was really just curious if the guy had something to add, or maybe even just was looking for someone to talk to.
He angrily threw the lollipop through the hallway, not even looking where it had landed. The last thing he needed right now was some stranger giving him candy like he was a four-year-old.
He had to admit it was fun hanging around with the older boy. He truly couldn't understand why Lucifer's dad would have kicked him out. Sam did want to know though. He was just too polite to ask and he didn't want to invade Lucifer's privacy. If he wanted to tell Sam, he would.
He turned around and left the building to look for his brother. After some more wandering around the place, he spotted two identical trailers.
He shouldn't be thinking about it that much. That's what Dean would say. Heck, that's probably what every clear-minded person would say. His parents had just been lucky. Why would he be so lucky? It was a big world and the odds weren't exactly in his favor.
Ten more minutes passed before the car pulled up into the driveway of a cozy house. A house that neither of them recognized as Jared Padalecki's.
Sam looked up and smiled before quickly pecking his lips. "Sure. I mean, I'd have to leave for Kevin's right after that but pizza's fine."
Dean took a deep breath. "Well..." he started. "When Michael and I were still friends, he uhm... kinda had a thing for me and... you know... turned out I may have had a little thing for him too."
"I'm Crowley," the guy introduced himself with a smug smile. "I'm Slytherin's Head Boy and I wanted to welcome you to our House."
"Good. I'm throwing a party tomorrow night. You're invited. There's only one rule: bring who you want, but take them all back home."
"Dean Winchester, just the guy I was looking for," Balthazar said with a suspiciously friendly smile.
"What, you think you're the only one with connections?" his brother said, clearly not happy with the situation at all.
He looked around just in time to see Charlie glare at her phone. When she noticed him watching, she turned her brown eyes to him expectantly.
Sam was speechless. All of his thoughts, his feelings, things he'd never said out loud, maybe not even realized himself, it was all thrown out into the open by this complete stranger. He'd barely even heard the boy's question, too busy with trying to comprehend what had just happened. In the end, he could only come up with one reasonable explanation. "What spell did you use?"
Lucifer smiled and put a step forward, and for a moment Sam thought he was going to kiss him. He wouldn't have minded, he never would, but still the idea of all the people surrounding them made him nervous.
Dean was just about to ask what the hell he meant by that when Crowley pointed right down the street. He frowned. "The Cage is on Cross Road?"
. Sam's jaw dropped as he walked up to it and passed the threshold. He was in the bunker. The only home they'd had in years and it was here, exactly the same except for the lamps and camera's placed all around and hung up on the ceiling. Still, it was... it was
A yawn escaped Dean as he half stepped, half rolled out of bed. He scratched the back of his head while watching Cas get up as well. Last night Dean had given him a T-shirt and a pair of shorts of his to sleep in, and he had to admit Metallica suited the boy.
Instead, he chose to focus on making the rest of his day as nice as possible. He'd planned on going just straight home, maybe step by the Roadhouse or some other place later to get food, but now he thought he had a better idea. The peace would be perfect to clear his head.
"Alright," Bobby sighed again, grabbed a beer and sat down at the kitchen table. "Now you boys better get to your room. It's late enough as it is."
He took Jensen's phone out of his pocket, glad that he'd taken it from the trailer too, and scrolled through the contacts until he'd found the one that was listed as Jared. He pressed the call button and prayed Sam had gotten a hold of his actor's phone somehow. For a couple of dreadful seconds, Dean listened to the ringing of the phone.
Sam leaned his head back against the door and closed his eyes, allowing himself to enjoy this moment for two more seconds. But he knew Dean would be mad if he took too long. "I got to go," he whispered and looked back up.
Dean didn't have a clue what it meant, but he knew one thing: if Sam wasn't typing correct sentences, he'd better find him.
He grinned as his friend immediately pulled his phone from his pocket, and it grew even wider when Cas smiled too, even though it only lasted for a second.
His little brother was looking at him way too amusedly, so Dean gave him a glare. "Shut up," he grumbled, pocketing his phone before he started to walk away. "Come on! We've got some acting to do."
And on Monday Sam realized he would have to act quickly if he wanted to survive the rest of the week. It wasn't an easy task though. Whoever was doing this, was hiding their traces very carefully. He tried everything, kept an eye on the places where something might occur (and where eventually something did occur indeed), asked his friends to watch out for anything suspicious, he even started checking his every move twice in case some trap was waiting for him. To no avail of course. If Sam didn't know better he would have thought it to be magic.
, soulmates! He had rolled his eyes very dramatically when he'd heard about it. It was very cute and all of that but honestly, who the hell cared? He didn't understand why everyone always had to make such a big deal out of it. Gabriel was perfectly capable of having sex, with or without sight, and just a decent hookup once in a while was all he ever needed. Luckily, he knew just the place to get one.
He was very satisfied with himself when Sam quickly opened his mouth to defend himself but nothing came out. "What did you see?" he carefully asked at last.
"Kevin!" he called, making his way to the younger boy. Maybe Sam had told him something about where he and Lucifer went.
As soon as Sam left the car, he shook off the awkwardness between him and Dean. He wouldn't let the argument with this brother ruin his day.
Dean smiled back. Then caught himself and stopped. Then did it again so it wouldn't seem suspicious.
There was no way he could deny that. And it thrilled him beyond anything he'd ever known. Lucifer had slowly invaded his life and taken it to the next level and Sam had no idea how to stop it. He didn't
He laughed at the shock clearly visible on... well, all of Gabriel. The guy looked as if his eyes could pop out every second. But he wouldn't be Gabriel if he didn't recover just as quickly. "Okay, what else?"
"I'm such a big fan of your father's," Mick continued. "I had no idea he had a son! He must be away a lot."
Lucifer tilted his head at him. "What's gotten you so distracted?" Before he got a chance to answer however, Lucifer turned around in the direction Sam just had been looking at. The Shurley frowned and let out an irritated sigh before telling Sam, "Just ignore him, he's just being a drama queen. Little attention whore loves it."
Within an instant Lucifer had put his hands on Sam's hips and pulled him in, crashing their lips together. By now most people were at the cafeteria already but a couple of students were still lingering around the hallways, and Sam felt a rush of adrenaline surge through his body. There simply was something exciting about the shameless way in which Lucifer clearly wasn't holding back for anyone. They weren't just kissing. Their bodies were pressed against each other, mouths wide open, eager to let the other in. If they'd continue like this, there was no doubt where they'd end up tonight.
Misha had turned around at the sudden noise. "You okay?" he asked with a confused frown and tilted his head a little, a gesture that reminded Dean way too much of Castiel.
"Hey," Sam stopped him. He closed his locker and looked Lucifer in the eye. "Don't worry about it, okay? I don't care what they say. You're my friend." He gave Lucifer's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.
"Jesus fucking Christ," Dean groaned as soon as he was gone and he dropped back his head. "This is a complete disaster."
"Oh, that son of a bitch," Dean sighed. He'd known this was a bad idea... Well, not that Gabriel would personally ruin his car but still. "Listen, I tried to get out of it, okay? I really did but that jerkface didn't give me a chance to. I knew I shouldn't have interfered but the guy actually seemed to mean well and he sounded like he had something important to say. If I'd known what he was gonna do, I never would've let that piece of shit near you!" As he went to drop down on the couch, he grumbled something to himself along the lines of, "Can't believe I fell for that stupid trick..."
Clif gave them a worried look through the rearview mirror. "Why? You've done it so many times, the fans adore you, everyone's coming over and you don't even have to do any traveling yourselves this time."
For a moment Castiel remained silent, and then he sighed. "How much did Michael tell you about our family?"
After a couple minutes of going on like that, like a miracle sent by God himself, he heard the bathroom door open.
Dean sighed and pointed at the stairs. "Just get your ass up there and go put some dry clothes on, you're gonna get yourself sick."
Michael looked at him. "Why do you think my dad kicked him out, Dean? He doesn't care about other people's feelings. He uses them, plays them to get what he wants." His eyes grew apologetically. "I'm sorry, I really wish I didn't have to say this, I saw how happy Sam looked in there. But being friends with Lucifer? It's just not a good idea, Dean, it will only end up getting him hurt even more. I doubt Lucifer would have given him a second look at all if he hadn't been your brother."
Lucifer opened his mouth to answer, then closed it again. Then he said with a soft smile, "Actually it fits you perfectly."
John and Mary Winchester were in their early twenties when they met. His father was living his life without much concern for love, although Sam knew he secretly was a romantic. He had been a lot like Dean actually, his mind always occupied with music or cars. Dean had even inherited his inability to taste. But then John met their mom, a young woman who had never allowed for anything to come in between her and her goals, including her being deaf. She was strong and determined and if Sam were to believe everything his parents had told them when they were kids, his dad fell for her the moment they laid eyes on each other. She had been a little harder to convince though, so sure, it took them a little while, but then eventually it happened. One day Mary had been in a fight with her parents and when John came to see her, she'd run towards him and jumped into his arms. And that's when they'd clicked.
Castiel only gave a hum in agreement while he opened the front door and started towards the elevator.
"You don't happen to know any Mary's?" Dean joked and when John looked at him questioningly, he added, "My mom's name."
"The Trickster," she said as if it was obvious. When no one responded, she looked at them incredulously. "Really? Am I the only one who knows all the gossip around here?"
"I had to shake off my siblings, so I thought hiding behind your car would be the best way to make sure I wasn't seen."
Cas bit his bottom lip. "We're trying. Michael's done everything he can. Raphael helps out as much as possible, Zachariah and Naomi keep an eye on the younger ones and Bartholomew-"
Sam shook his head. "You know nothing about me and Lucifer." He barely even noticed he'd started almost whispering.
Still feeling very uncomfortable but not knowing what else to do, Sam went to sit down at the kitchen table.
Dean let out an exasperated sigh and walked to go find his brother. But Sam wasn't at his locker, or at Lucifer's. He quickly sent him a text asking where he was but he doubted he'd get a reply.
The younger boy bit his lip, his blue eyes turned downwards. "I'm sorry. I do want to, it's just..." His gaze shifted to a point to Dean's right and Dean looked over his shoulder to see what he was looking at.
He was just about to send Lisa a message but then changed his mind. If Sam decided to join them, Dean'd let him pick who was coming and he wasn't sure it wouldn't be painful for his brother to see him with his girlfriend.
That seemed to finally do it for Dean. He took a deep breath as if to calm himself down and then asked, "Did he hurt you?"
Two other cars were already parked on the drive, which caused both brothers to smile. Dean shut off the engine and opened the door, Sam followed his lead quickly and they headed towards the front door together. As soon as Dean opened the door he heard two familiar voices chatting.
But the alternative was staying home, alone, with nothing else to do than think. And he certainly couldn't have that. At least at school he had classes to attend, although he was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to pay attention to them properly. He had a purpose and a purpose was the only thing that could keep him from thinking.
Crowley let out a laugh. "Believe me, squirrel, you don't want that bastard around here any more than I do."
Again he decided to not answer that. Luckily Lucifer wasn't the kind of person to keep quiet anyways.
"Okay c'mon, let's get to the car," Dean said, motioning for him to follow and already turning around to leave as well.
The grin that Cas gave him was enough as a response, and even if it weren't, the kiss that followed would have done the trick. The only reason they stopped was because the school bell eventually rang.
Castiel smiled and it was the most genuine smile Dean had ever seen on him. "I'm free Friday night."
"No, it's not that bad," John was quick to say. "It's not like there are rules to it or something... I mean, unfortunately there still might be people who will give you strange looks but that's about it. I personally don't know that many Slytherins but I don't think most are like Ketch."
Sam couldn't say he was sad to see him go. They drove home in an uncomfortable silence, Dean focusing on the road, Sam staring out of the window, avoiding Dean at all costs. When they finally entered their kitchen, Dean turned around at him.
"Well yeah, but I mean..." Dean sighed. "Parties, Cas. Booze, doing dumb shit, making mistakes. That's what being a teenager is for after all."
Hate to say it guys, but I'm afraid updates will be coming up a bit slower from now on... Love you all and thanks for your amazing support!
With that his little brother started to walk away, Kevin followed after him, and Dean watched them both go in surprise. Well, that was convenient. He hoped he hadn't just chased Sammy away but he doubted it. Sam almost seemed... happy to leave. Weird.
Jo was a Thunderbird as well but she was the same age as Adam and the two of them had been really close friends for a long time now. Oh, and she also used to have a crush on Dean.
His heart seemed to stop when Lucifer laughed a little. "Seriously, what's gotten into you, Sammy?" Then he squinted his blue eyes. "You didn't talk to one of my siblings, did you?"
The candy Sam thought he understood. That was just Gabriel's way of showing sympathy he guessed. But the Trickster had given Sam his phone number and he had no idea why. Or why he was already getting his phone out for that matter.
Still with a very serious look on his face, Cas stated, "I had never kissed someone before, but I liked it."
His brother shook his head and frustratedly ran a hand through his hair. Why couldn't Dean see all of this was too suspicious? "It's just... too much of a coincidence, Dean! Think about it, last time we were here, we didn't even know Rich existed and now I'm married to him?"
Adam inwardly thanked Merlin that he didn't start blushing like an idiot and managed what he hoped was a normal smile. "Hey, Samandriel."
"I was having fun, that's what I was doing!" Sam defended himself. Why was his brother making such a big deal out of this?
Another smile lit up his face. "Well..." Cas started. "It's not just bees. Mostly bees but I'm also interested in other parts of nature. Animals and plants. Forces of nature. Humans."
The both of them were washed over with relief when the door opened and Castiel walked in. Except for one little confusing detail that is...
"Hey handsome," Lisa grinned and Dean immediately turned to kiss her passionately. Maybe a little bit to passionately.
"It's okay," she said with a little smile and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. "You can borrow mine."
"Won't you look at that, 'Spouse: Jared Padalecki'. The height difference's gotta be hilarious. He's a lot older though, why would you do that?"
"I don't know," Mick said in a frustrated voice. "I feel like I know that name and yet I can't put my finger on it..."
Dean nearly choked on his beer. He actually coughed a couple of times before he could bring out in a rasping voice, "What?"
His bright blue eyes connected with Dean's and for a moment they just sat there, smiling at each other. Then Dean remembered one of the things he'd wanted to tell Cas in the first place.
The thought had barely crossed his mind when Cas suddenly turned towards him. He was smiling again, in that careful way of his, and his eyes reflected the sunlight like sapphires.
He strolled up and down the train until he finally found the cart. He started towards it, his eyes growing wide and his mouth starting to water at the sight of all the candy, but stopped when two other boys approached it from the other side. One of them was so tall he actually had Gabriel questioning if he'd accidentally stepped into a wormhole. After checking (twice), he noticed the kid had longish, brown hair and was hot as hell and Gabriel knew he'd never seen him before because dammit, that would've been something he'd remembered. The other boy was a lot shorter and Asian. He was also kinda cute but not like the other one, and the two of them seemed to be in a heated debate. Trying (and failing) not to eavesdrop, he leaned against the door of one of the compartments and waited for them to go first.
Dean gave him an incredulous look. "That son of a bitch messed with my Baby. We may be even again, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop hating his guts for what he did."
But apparently it didn't matter, because only a mere second later one of the other Shurleys leaned against this desk.
They spent the rest of the evening like that, without really talking to one another. They watched some TV together, and Sam read a little more from time to time.
The Impala wasn't there yet, so Dean must've still been with Lisa, but Bobby's car was. Sam smiled to himself and entered the house, walking into the living room where the man he considered his second dad was watching TV in his chair, a beer in his hand as usual.
"Well yeah, but during lunch?" He really wasn't getting where Cas was going with this. Sure, he'd spend a lot of time with Sam at school too (at least before he was abducted by Lucifer), but that had also to do with the fact that they'd both been friends with Jo and Charlie even before high school. Him and Sam, they'd just always... been there for each other. Sam was a shy kid and Dean would be damned if he'd acted like one of those arrogant pricks that ignored their younger siblings at school.
That did take all of them by surprise. They exchanged looks and when it became obvious the Shurleys weren't gonna start, Adam considered himself screwed.
"I can't say I'm really surprised about him being the Trickster," Cas continued. "He's pretty fond of the whole just desserts idea. What I don't understand is why he would go after you. You've done nothing to him, and I doubt it had something to do with Michael. My oldest brother would never approve of something like this."
, but they hadn't even been together for that long yet. Sam wasn't like his brother, this was kinda important to him and he wanted to take his time to get there.
"No!" Dean objected. "Of course not. Trust me, I still don't like the guy. I think he's a bad influence and a selfish son of a bitch and you might even be right about him using Sam. But you were his family and you turned on him."
"Yes, well, no one messes with me," Crowley sneered but it was obvious he was still embarrassed by what had happened.
?" Sam huffed. "Listen, I don't care about your stupid tricks but you need to keep the hell away from my brother. He's had enough bullshit lately without you adding to the pile. Why are you even doing this to him? Is this fun for you? Tricking Dean over and over again?"
To his sarcastic surprise all of his brothers shook their heads and he rolled his eyes before leaving.
Playfully, Lucifer's fingers walked up his stomach and Sam had to force himself to not react to it. The soft touches all over his chest made his heartbeat quicken.
"I guess Sammy is waiting for me," he whispered against her lips before letting go of her. "I see you tomorrow morning."
Lucifer met him by his locker after their final morning class, just when Sam was putting away his last textbooks.
Without giving Dean a chance to answer that, he pulled a new lollipop out of his pocket and walked past him while unwrapping it. Dean turned around confusedly and had just opened his mouth to say something about it, when Gabriel spoke again, not even bothering to turn back.
"Well you know, I live with Dean and my dad about ten minutes from school. My dad isn't at home a lot though, so it's mainly just..."
At his boyfriend's name Mick started pointing his fork at John accusingly. "You know, you are lucky that you're my best friend, otherwise I would kick your butt so hard you wouldn't be able to sit on your broom for the next three weeks."
For a couple of seconds, Dean just stood there on the threshold, without knowing what to say. He had so many things to say, or ask, or yell, but in the end it all came down to one thing.
"That's alright," Castiel said. "I don't expect to get in too much trouble. It's only biology after all."
"Shut up, Gabriel," Castiel growled at him before turning back to Dean. "Listen, I can't tell you how to feel or act but I need you to know two things. First of all, Michael is still your friend, nothing more. Secondly, don't hurt him. He's been through enough. We all have."
Sam was just about to get his books for his final class from his locker when a familiar voice called out his name.
Sam rolled his eyes but smiled all the same. They just sat next to each other in silence for a while until Dean suggested they'd order pizza.
"Yes. No, well..." He cursed under his breath and leaned against his locker. "We're fine. I just needed some time on my own."
In the meantime Lucifer was laughing so hard he actually doubled up and fell to the ground, right in one of the pools, which made him laugh even harder. By now Sam couldn't control himself either and it took everything for him not to collapse next to his new friend.
The three Americans looked to the Head Table in unison. The older witch was sitting on Chuck Shurley's other side and just tapped his hand because he was about to steal away another chicken leg. His sons watched the event fondly, knowing their dad had never really been one for table manners. He was a big fan of finger food.
Today was just another one of these days. The Trickster walked by and Sam watched him angrily. He was actually watching so attentively he didn't even notice someone coming up to him.
"Before Chuck Shurley adopted me," Lucifer explained. "I lived at a foster home. Never knew my parents. I grew up in that place... And so did Michael."
"How about I save us both the trouble of having a very uncomfortable conversation and just kick down the closet doors instead."
"And there are a lot of things beside straight and gay, yeah I know," he mocked, remembering his other conversations with Castiel.
Confused beyond measure, Dean looked at their hands, but he didn't pull away. Instead he decided to take the offer of silence and turned his eyes back to the river as well. After a deep breath, he slowly folded his fingers around Cas's.
"Yeah, go ahead," Sam answered. They exchanged a final look before Dean turned around and walked out of the room. Sam let out a sigh.
Michael gave him a small smile. "Yes, Balthazar surely knows his business." Then he nodded at the drinks. "What do you need?"
Gabriel took out his wallet, dropped a couple of notes onto the bar and downed his drink in a single go. Then he got off of his chair and held out a hand for Kali. "What do you say you and I get out of here and I flatter you all night instead?"
Dean looked around frowning and wondered what it was this time. "Oh crap," he muttered as he saw Sam and Lucifer walk towards the Shurley's locker. They were standing surprisingly close to each other, which made Dean frown even more. Lucifer seemed to be a little bit annoyed, but Sam had a smile on his face and a look in his eyes as if he were the happiest human being to ever walk the earth.
"You say that like you're not one of them," Dean grinned, and his smile only broadened when Cas's cheeks flushed and he looked down at his lap.
"No, thanks," Sam answered with a friendly smile. In the last couple of hours he'd come to like the guy. Sure, Misha wasn't Cas but he was nice and funny. He seemed like a good person.
"Yes," Castiel replied, hoping she wouldn't turn out to be one of those people who only seemed interested in them for that sole reason.
"Michael is attracted to you," Castiel simply repeated. Then he looked back at Dean. "You didn't know."
And didn't that turn out just to be the question that would finally make Dean snap. "What happened to me? What
Now it was just the Winchesters and a couple of other students they didn't know. One by one those were called forward too until the three of them were all that was left.
It wouldn't hurt to just get an idea of what Gabriel was planning if he could still choose not to go through with it.
She tried to find out why he wanted it for a while but after a lot of avoiding she dropped it and about half an hour later she sent him the number. He called it immediately.
His brother let out a shallow laugh. "That's one way to put it. First freaking Gabriel, then Lucifer, now Michael... What the hell is wrong with these people?"
His vision blurred at the words. He wanted to yes, that he was fine, or at least would be, but he was too choked up to speak. Instead he just let out a shaky breath.
"Look who's talking," Sam came back, motioning at the piece of pie Dean had bought on the way to school this morning.
By the time Sam headed back to class he was seriously irritated. Since when was Dean being so touchy?
The three other boys nodded in agreement before falling into silence, each of them preoccupied with their own thoughts. Knowing them, they'd all be worrying about what was going to happen and Gabriel wasn't in the mood to watch their pensive frowns for the next couple of hours.
The stranger smiled at him engagingly. "The Shurleys. At least I'm assuming that's why you were looking so annoyed at one."
Sam was just about to prove his point before his brother stopped him. "Nope, no intellectual debates. Not on this train to probably the coolest place we've ever been at. You two can keep that shit to yourselves until you're in the Ravenclaw dorms."
"Jared, since my husband is apparently not going to ask, would you like something to drink?" Misha went on.
"I'm sorry," Castiel repeated. "I'm sorry for telling you about Michael. I shouldn't have done that."
Since both his T-shirt and jacket seemed to have evaporated, Dean was forced to close the buttons of his flannel and walk around jacket-less. Cas had had no idea what he was talking about, claiming that when he entered the bathroom, there hadn't been any clothes on the floor to begin with. Dean believed him without questioning it. He couldn't even imagine what a terrible liar Cas would be, always so blunt and direct in his answers.
"Yeah, now that you mention it, since when is that a thing, by the way?" he asked curiously. He'd been wondering about that.
Sam was the first one to decide to just roll with it. They would have to if they didn't want to make a scene. "Right. Misha. Of course," he was quick to say.
Gabriel himself, however, was nowhere to be found, and if Dean didn't know any better, he'd say the golden-eyed senior could sense he was being looked for.
"That's not what I meant... Jesus Christ," he said annoyed, rushing his hands through his hair. "I'm not gay!"
"Well yeah, obviously," Dean retorted. "I'm talking about Hogwarts. You know, is it a castle just like Ilvermorny? Do they have Houses too?"
"Are you... sure?" Lucifer asked. "Isn't that maybe a bit early or something? In case you don't remember, your brother isn't exactly my biggest fan."
For a moment the entire class remained silent, Mrs Miller included, and stared at the door. When it became clear the boys wouldn't be returning any time soon, she finally closed it and his fellow students started whispering to each other as on cue. Sam couldn't blame them, he was just as curious to find out what had just happened. Out of the corner of his eye he caught a questioning look from Kevin, but he just shrugged in response.
Out of the corner of his eye he could see a small blush appearing on his guide's face. "Thank you. Where did you park?"
"Son of a bitch," he swore under his breath, slapped the laptop shut and ran his hands through his hair desperately. This was not good. This was not good at all.
"This place is nice," he said, and Dean grinned. That was the kind of reaction he'd been hoping for after all.
Rolling his eyes, Sam opened the door. Then he turned back one last time to give Lucifer a peck on the lips. "Bye."
"Sorry it took me so long," Cas said. "My siblings can be very persistent and they already are suspicious of me."
He had been planning on just saying he was at Lucifer's or something but now that he heard Kevin, clearly worried, he couldn't get out the words. Instead, the only sound that left him was a soft sob as a new flood of tears came down.
Dean could hardly believe he was thinking it, but he actually wasn't so sure about his opinion on Lucifer anymore. "Well yeah, but he was your brother, Michael."
She rolled her eyes. "Look, I know you wanna make Lucifer pay for whatever it is that he did to Sam. And I also know that right about now you're probably wishing you'd never gotten involved with the Shurleys in the first place, but that guy... Dean, he seemed way too eager to take you on, and you're no use to Sam if you get hurt, keep that in mind."
Then suddenly a second car stopped right in front of the house and two familiar people got out. Mrs Moore's cry when she ran towards the house pierced right through his heart. Her husband caught up with her quickly and stopped her, pulling her into his arms and holding her tightly with a pained look on his face. She burst out in tears and clung to him desperately, while a fireman approached them. When Mrs Moore started crying even harder Sam knew enough and it felt as if he had just been hit by a truck. He frantically gasped for breath, a throbbing pain spread through his chest and it took him all of his will power to not have his legs give way.
He'd just put his phone down again, ready to get up, when Cas moved in the bed next to his. Dean looked over again and watched as the boy slowly raised a hand and rubbed his eye before letting out a low grumbling sound. Then one eyelid slid open, quickly followed by the other. For a second, Cas seemed confused, probably disorientated by his unfamiliar surroundings, but then his gaze landed on Dean.
"Sorry I dragged you out of your class," he eventually said. He had only now realized he had quite literally forced Castiel to ditch class. And the guy didn't exactly look like someone who would ever do that on his own.
Sam rolled his eyes but the idea made his cheeks heat. Their conversation returned to a more casual one but what Lucifer had said kept lingering in the back of his mind. Would maybe tonight be...? Lucifer obviously wanted it to but then again he'd wanted to for weeks. Did Sam want it? The easy answer was a yes, of course he wanted to, but did he want to
The answer came in rather quickly, as if the other boy had been waiting to hear from him. Sam liked that thought.
So Sam took a deep breath and told him the truth, "But I like you, Lucifer. I like you a lot. More than I should probably."
Of course Sam didn't know where the guest room was. But he honestly didn't really care. He'd figure it out, but right now he was too busy being amused at the very awkward situation Dean would find himself in within minutes. He should probably feel sorry for his brother. Then again, karma apparently really was a son of a bitch.
The Winchester poured them both a cup and they remained in place together, standing next to each other and enjoying the hot beverage while Dean made them omelets and Cas watched. It felt right, Dean realized, as if his friend had been drinking coffee in their kitchen for years. They ended up spending most of their breakfast in silence, each enjoying the food and allowing the caffeine to slowly wake them up properly.
"Oh shit," Charlie muttered and Dean gave her a reassuring squeeze before she made her way to the front of the group. Professor Hudson lifted the hat so she could sit down and then placed it on her head. It was a little big for her but it didn't seem to care.
It had been one of the best days of Sam's life. They had visited some of their favorite spots in town and Lucifer had bought him dinner before they went back to his place. They'd spent the entire day laughing, holding hands, occasionally sneaking in little kisses. It was beautiful. And it looked like it was only going to keep getting better.
"Hey you," he replied and gave her a quick kiss before grabbing her hand and walking towards his locker. "How was biology?"
The younger boy smiled back. "Thanks for understanding." When Lucifer just gave him a brief nod, he added, "Maybe I should go home anyway. Now that Dean knows, he'll probably go into full protective brother mode." He didn't know why he said that. It was just that he was afraid he'd broken the mood and now he felt stupid for bringing it up. Maybe he should've just waited to see where Lucifer was head before drawing the line.
So he decided he would just drop what had happened tonight. Of course he wanted to know where his brother had been or who this mysterious new friend was, but in the end it didn't really matter. Whatever or whoever it was, it made Sam happy and that was all Dean cared about. Did it sting a little that he hadn't been able to achieve that? Yes, it did. But that was irrelevant now.
He was about to open his mouth, but as usual Gabriel beat him to it. "Nope. Actually we only moved here to go to college. We're from Sioux Falls, South Dakota. But KU seemed nice and we were kinda moving anyway so..."
The next morning Dean drove into the parking lot an hour and a half before school started. That should be plenty of time to talk to Castiel about... whatever was going on.
After a couple of seconds of uncomfortable silence Dean asked, "So Michael dragged you along with him?"
Ellen brought their food rather quickly and Dean dug in as if his life depended on it. Michael raised an eyebrow at him but apparently didn't bother mentioning it.
"Okay, so the first thing you need to know is that my siblings and I, we're obviously not related. We're all adopted," Michael started.
"Because in his entire life, there have only been two people who Lucifer needed and respected. Two people who he ever truly loved. And those two people turned their backs on him and left him to die. He's not over that, none of them are over that, hell, I'm not even over that. Why do you think he followed us to Lawrence? As long as Lucifer is not ready to move on, he can't give you what you want."
"Doesn't mean they aren't still gonna pay for what they did to Baby though," Dean continued. "Gonna make sure they'll never forget about that again."
The funny thing was Dean couldn't see any way this would end well. Everything about this situation seemed doomed to fail. But Cas was right. Before he could even make an attempt at fixing things, he would have to decide what he wanted.
The older boy removed his hand, leaned back in his chair and sighed with a sad look in his eyes. "You do what you gotta do, Sam."
Sam looked at him in shock, unable to come up with a reply. The only thing he felt was the sting of Azazel's words and the tears welling up in his eyes. He was just about to turn and run away when Azazel let out a panicked scream. For about a second he had no idea what was going on but then he looked down. And saw Azazel's shoe was on fire. Sam quickly gazed around, looking for what could have caused this. His eyes landed on the Trickster, who was staring straight at him.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," the guy in the suit called out, spreading his hands before clapping them back together. "As some of you may or may not already know, my name is Professor Mycroft Holmes and I'm the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
Michael shifted in his seat before looking him in the eyes. "Look, Dean, clearly there's something going on between the both of us. After Monday, I don't think even you can deny that. So I'm going to be honest with you. I like you, Dean. Really like you. And I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure you feel it too."
"So, I've been thinking," he eventually started. "And you know, with the whole Lucifer and you thing, I thought we could maybe, if you want to, finally do some... well, introducing, you know."
There were only a few people in the bathroom, two of the stalls occupied and a couple others who were just about to leave. Dean hoped that none of the guys still doing their business was Bartholomew or something.
She looked from Benny to Jo, who both seemed just as surprised. "An imaginary friend?" she asked with a playful smirk, and he knew he'd officially made her way too curious.
"But at a club?" Dean let out with big eyes, placing his hands on the kitchen table. "That's not you, Sam, you hate places like that! You didn't even wanna go to the park last week and now you're hanging around at clubs with a guy you barely even know?!"
For what seemed about the hundredth time, he swiped his sweaty palms on his jeans, his eyes scanning the rest of the park. Jesus, he felt like some teenager about to dump his first girlfriend. To be fair, he had in fact done that very recently. Well, Lisa wasn't exactly his first girlfriend but it was close enough.
The barking behind them got a little bit closer again and Sam could hear his brother curse under his breath. They rounded a corner and there she was, exactly where they'd left her. Baby. Dean made a sprint for it and Sam followed suit. They reached the car, threw open the doors and jumped in.
Dean thought he could feel a 'but' coming but Cas didn't continue and he didn't want to push. "Alright, so that's one... What else?" he asked instead.
After the school bell announced the end of the day, Dean stomped out of school, to his car. Sam would be with Lucifer, so he didn't have to worry about that. Actually he should worry about that but Dean had stopped caring. He simply couldn't afford to care anymore and it wasn't like his brother would listen to him anyway.
She got up and he put his arms around her, kissing her lovingly. Somehow she made everything so much easier.
The way Cas looked at him eased down a tiny bit of the nervousness in his chest but that didn't mean he stopped dreading the words that would come out of the other boy's mouth. He was already anxiously biting his tongue, convinced that there was nothing more he could do. It was only fair, he couldn't make Cas's decisions for him. And after all, why would the guy choose him over his own family? Dean wasn't anything special...
Sam's eyes grew wide immediately, a hurt look appearing on his face. Without another word he walked out of the kitchen. Dean instantly regretted what he'd said and went after his brother.
"Dean Winchester," a definitely not British voice answered and he jumped at the sudden sound. "Just the guy I was looking for."
Dean didn't feel like explaining it, so instead he let out an exasperated sigh. Maybe Cas was right, maybe he was asking too much. After all, if the roles were reversed, what would he do?
"I was starting to wonder how much longer it would take you," the woman's sensual voice commented dryly.
He'd only just opened his notebook when a shadow fell over the pages. When he looked up, Dean was both surprised and annoyed to see Balthazar Shurley standing in front of his desk. If the guy was there to give him some don't-mess-with-my-brother speech, asses were gonna get kicked.
He hadn't seen Michael either though, which was a good thing for the moment being. He knew he would have to talk to him later, but at the moment his priorities lay elsewhere.
didn't want a repeat of the Lucifer fiasco. Not that that was where his texts with Gabriel were going, not at all. God, it wasn't even going anywhere, they were just joking around over text.
They all gave her a shrug or a look of indifference. She let out a sigh and explained, "It's supposed to be one of the Shurleys who has this amazing gift for tricking people, as the nickname suggests."
"Oh. Let's say I recognize unrequited love when I see it," Molly answered with a sad smile, suddenly feeling a bit uncomfortable herself too.
Now there was nothing left for him to do but wait. Dean hated waiting. There was one person he hadn't called yet but he didn't want to. On the other hand he might actually be the one person who knew where Lucifer would go...
Sam tried to pick up some of the rumors that were being told, but he could only make out one word: Shurley.
His worry cast a shadow over the rest of his day and he couldn't wait to get out of school and allow Cas to distract him. When the school bell finally rang, he let out a relieved sigh before getting up from his seat. He said goodbye to Charlie and Jo - Benny was in another class - and strolled out of the school building. He got in Bobby's spare car and for a moment he thought about his little brother again. Sam had told him he was gonna go with Lucifer after school, he wouldn't need a ride. But Dean wouldn't be Dean if he didn't for the smallest of moments checked his rearview mirror to see if he could catch a glimpse of Sam anyway. Which of course he couldn't.
Gabriel was leaning against the wall a little bit behind Lucifer by himself. His usually mocking smile was replaced by a serious look, the candy bar in his hand forgotten. He seemed strangely on edge and was watching the situation in front of him attentively.
It was moments like these Castiel didn't remember why he'd decided to move out with Gabriel. Yes, he loved his brother. But the little brat could drive him crazy sometimes.
"So what?" Dean laughed. "I mean, I get you got angry and I know he'd hurt you but you could've fixed it instead of picking a side."
His brother rushed through the kitchen to get his own stuff. Castiel heard a stumble and a swear and he couldn't help but smile. The past couple of years Gabriel had gotten to know the place like the back of his hand but from time to time things like chairs still got in his way.
"You gotta eat lunch though," he called when Sam stepped out. "Might as well do so at our regular table."
He was relieved when school was over and he could go home with Dean. They had agreed to pick up the girls and their other friends later on.
The elevator arrived and they both got in, before Gabriel answered him, "Maybe I'm turning my life around."
"I'm not too bad a player myself," Adam mentioned and Molly gave him an amused look. Apparently he was able to make a move on his own.
Sam glanced at the TV to see what was on, but it wasn't really his thing so he took a book out of his bag and went to sit on the couch to read a little. He had some trouble focusing though, his mind wondering off to... well, everything. Lucifer, Kevin, Dean, Bobby, his dad... Mostly Lucifer. He smiled to himself at the thought of his boyfriend.
And he really didn't want to ruin his friendship with Cas. He smiled to himself. There was something about the guy... Dean just felt comfortable with him for some reason. Maybe it was the fact that Cas was always so brutally honest with him, or how helpful he was and kind and just... well, not like his siblings. It was as if Cas was the only tiny bit of humanity in that entire family, every other one of the Shurleys too caught up in their pride to even think about others.
Sam smiled to himself. God, did he miss them. But they'd left him one invaluable lesson: one person might be able to change your life. All you gotta do is let them into your heart.
She left and Dean turned back to Cas, who was looking at him as well. Damn, his eyes were blue. Dean had noticed before but he'd never gave it that much thought. They weren't light blue but more of a darker shade usually, sometimes bordering on grey. It was hard to describe. Sometimes they would turn brighter too though, and then they were like satellite images from the Pacific. They were truly amazing when they did that but Dean didn't think it happened very often. He wished it did.
He looked over to the signs Dean was making and tried to figure out what they were talking about. He'd never really been good at signing and it'd been a long time since he'd used it, so he only got half of what was being said. As far as he could tell, Dean was explaining how he'd run into Castiel.
Those four simple words hit him like a bomb. He didn't buy them, not for one second, but that didn't make it hurt any less. Just the very idea made his heart squeeze together.
The next day Sam determinedly stamped into the school building. He'd already texted Lucifer there was something he needed to do and they'd agreed to meet during first break. But right now, Sam had a Trickster to search for and beat the shit out of.
Instead of answering, Dean pressed 'call' and waited for the person he'd been looking for to pick up. He didn't have to wait very long.
Sam quickly sat up too. "Nothing happened, I swear, I only-" Then the most awful realization occurred to him and his breath hitched in his throat. "Wait, why aren't you answering the question?"
Dean angrily threw a fork into the water. "Well yeah, what if we can't? Balthazar's dead so obviously it isn't him. So who is? Also, we got dropped in the middle of the highway so there's no way we'll be able to find that exact same spot again. And I don't know about you but I don't remember the ingredients to the spell. If it's even a spell this time."
After a couple of minutes Lucifer finally sat up straight and stretched his arms. "You wanna order some pizza?" he asked in a back to casual voice.
It looked like Cas was allowing his words to sink in, eyes focused on infinity. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and soft.
Sam rolled his eyes and gritted his teeth in frustration. "Okay, you know what, this is ridiculous. Fine, I married a man who's thirteen years older than me. Can we now please move on?"
Surprising even himself, Dean found that he didn't want to, and after a couple of seconds said, "You ever had a day when the entire universe seems to be out to get to you?"
They finally pulled up in front of their home and the Winchesters got out of the car. After a quick thanks and goodbye, they went inside and dropped their stuff in the living room.
Sam signed as soon as they got home. Signing in the car was always a pain in the ass, since he would have to lip-read and Dean had to keep his eyes on the road.
"Oh, right," Sam huffed. Yes, he was being salty but he'd be damned if he didn't deserve to be. "You probably know him as Gabriel."
"Me?" Dean managed to get out in disbelief. As soon as realization kicked in, he turned towards his brother. "Dude, I married fake Cas," he said, pointing at the guy that was most certainly not Cas.
They just looked at each other for a couple of seconds before Dean continued, "But this ain't right and you know it. Michael, you are eighteen years old, a teenager, basically a kid yourself! You can't look after all of your siblings and you definitely shouldn't have to either. Your dad's the one who should be doing the fixing instead of leaving you to clean up his mess."
"Why wouldn't I be?" his brother answered, seemingly not understanding what was bothering Sam so much.
Sam was about to push but Dean gave him a look that made it crystal clear he didn't want to talk about it.
They only had to walk a couple of yards before Crowley turned to a right and walked in between two seemingly very regular buildings. Dean was just about to say something about it when he rounded the corner himself and froze in space. At the far back of the side of one of the buildings was a discreet black door with above it the name he'd been looking for:
Michael nodded, a painful look on his face. "I've known Lucifer all my life. We were best friends as a matter of fact."
Cas just looked at him with the same calm demeanor as always. "I highly doubt that's the case. Gabriel may be a bit of an... ass but he's not one for injustice. He wouldn't try to hurt Sam unless he'd in any way wronged him."
"Dean, would you stop it?" Castiel snapped. "For Heaven's sake, he likes you. It's not like he's madly in love with you, he isn't going to ask you to marry him or anything, he just
"Hey, Dean. Nice to you see again, it's been a while," Ellen greeted him before her eyes shifted towards Castiel. "And who did you bring this time?"
He shrugged. "He was never around much. My brother and I moved out five years ago and we haven't spoken to the rest of our family since."
"First of all, they're not the same thing, Dean," Sam explained. "Like I said, Hogwarts Houses have different values. Just because I think you're going to Gryffindor, doesn't mean all Thunderbirds are. And secondly, I won't get to pick. Hogwarts Houses don't pick you, you are assigned to them. By a hat, I've heard."
. Not that that was gonna stop Dean but the way the Shurley's eyes seemed to spit fire at him did take him aback a little.
"Hey!" he stopped Gabriel by stepping right in front of him. "I think you and I need to have a conversation."
Sam thought to himself. One day he would get to the full truth but for now, he could settle for that answer.
Sam felt his cheeks heat but barely payed any attention to it. "There's not much to say," he shrugged.
The one thing Lucifer had taught him in less than 24 hours was that breaking the rules came with a very addictive rush of adrenaline. Sam had always been a good kid. High grades, quiet and polite; he was every teacher's dream student. And now he was texting during class.
The Misha guy smiled softly and walked up to Dean. "You are lucky I'm glad you're home." And then he handed Dean the flowers and kissed him on the cheek.
His friend rolled his eyes and took the bait immediately, without hesitation or even trying to be subtle. "Because, Sam, you are a cute, smart, dorky nerd and the library is
The other boy shrugged. "One, yes. It is fun. And two? This is so not about tricking Dean." He pointed his finger at Sam and circled it around a few times. "This joke is on you, Sam."
He shook the idea out of his head. No, he was just going to have to find a way to talk to Cas - preferably without attracting the attention of any other Shurleys - and figure out what the hell had happened Friday and how they were going to go on further.
"What about you two?" Gabriel continued with a charming smile. Castiel wondered what he was up to this time. Whatever it was, it couldn't be good.
"I thought," Lucifer explained, "that maybe we could leave a little early today. Gives us some more time to hang out before tonight."
Dean was already starting to curse when Sam noticed something. Next to the door was a black marble tile with the doorbell and
"Please stop talking," Sam nearly begged him, trying his best to blink away the tears in his eyes. He wasn't going to start crying over this, not here, not in front of Gabriel.
"Glad you asked. As a matter of fact it has something to do with that new friend of yours. There are rumors his long lost brother is back in town."
He wasn't going to deny it, Dean was pissed, at his brother for shutting him out, but even more at himself for not knowing what else there was for him to do about it. He'd tried about everything and failed miserably, time after time.
Dean was going his usual way, hanging out with his lifelong friends. He talked to Cas every so often, over the phone or sometimes at school. He would've liked to meet up with him in his spare time too, but he had a feeling the guy didn't get out much. It also didn't help Cas wasn't one to socialize often. Or at all. And since Michael was avoiding him like the plague, that meant his life almost seemed normal again. Well, except for his younger brother maybe.
His husband gave him a suggestive smile that teleported Sam right back to 2007. "Oh, don't you worry, sweetheart, we'll have plenty of time to pick up where we left off." And with that he left.
Sam was texting. During class. Something he normally would never do. And a part of him did actually feel guilty about it. But he had to admit, the other part felt... well, excited, in a way.
Michael sighed and for a moment Dean thought he still wasn't going to bulge. But then he said, "Fine, what do you want to know?"
"How could I not?" Dean answered. "Nothing like..." He made a face. "... bee populations in Turkey."
He cleared his throat. "Uh, random question but do you remember that episode that we did a couple of years ago with, you know... us in it? As in
Neither of them noticed the boy in front of one of the windows on the second floor, watching them leave before he grabbed his own keys and rushed down the stairs.
For a couple of seconds they waited in silent anticipation. When nothing seemed to happen, they exchanged a look.
"What am I doing?" Dean exclaimed and Sam could tell he was a lot more pissed off then he'd let on before. "Well, apparently this is my home, so I'm gonna go in and figure out how to get out of this mess! Again!"
"This is absolutely insane," Gabriel mumbled, as basically all of the Ilvermorny students stared at the hat with wide eyes. Even Bobby looked a bit taken aback.
"So what did you want to talk about?" Lisa asked as they walked out of the school and into the street.
She waved his comment away immediately. "Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter, he would never notice me anyway. He isn't even in Hufflepuff."
The Shurley pretended to consider it, then said, "Sure," making Sam laugh and give him a playful shove.
"I met up with a friend," Dean told him. Okay, so maybe he wouldn't normally call Balthazar a friend per se, but it was close enough.
With a frustrated sigh, Dean hung up and thought for a quick moment. Then he went through the contacts again and this time chose Richard's. The director had said he was going to that Rob dude first but it was the only thing he could come up with. He waited again...
He made his way to the stool, took a deep breath and sat down. He was grateful the Hat didn't make its decision immediately.
A couple of hours later at Lawrence Free State High School, the school bell rang and Sam Winchester came running out of the building. He sprinted towards the parking lot, in search of the familiar red convertible. The car wasn't exactly hard to find and as soon as he reached it, he hopped in. He looked back just in time to see Lucifer rushing through the doors. In the meantime some other students were coming out as well and looked at the Shurley strangely as he passed them.
He let go of the breath he didn't he was holding. It was time to be honest. "I do," he admitted. But before Michael could say anything else, he added, "But I can't."
He sighed when he realized his thoughts were far, far away from focusing on his work. It didn't matter if Castiel and his brother were nice. It didn't even matter if he was slightly intrigued by Gabriel's eyes, because he was never gonna see either of them again.
When Sam finally got out of class, he practically ran towards the parking lot. Dean would probably be worried by now. To his surprise he noticed the car almost immediately - it was quite difficult to overlook - but his brother was nowhere to be found. He looked around in confusion but couldn't find anything to explain his brother's absence. He shrugged and leaned against the hood of the car. Whatever the reason was Dean had left, he'd probably be back soon enough.
Before he could figure it out, his brother slapped his upper arm and pointed at a sign on the side of the road. It said,
He decided it would probably be better not to mention him wandering around town in the dark, actually planning to spend the night at the cemetery. He could still hardly believe he'd actually considered that, it sounded absolutely ridiculous now.
"It had been a while since Dad had adopted another child. The last one, Samandriel, was at least five years before that. So yes, we were quite surprised you could say."
Richard lifted an eyebrow and even with the glasses and the cap and the beard it was so... Gabriel. "You sure? 'Cause you acted pretty weird before and now you guys are ridiculously late... By the way, where were you last night? I went home this morning to take a decent shower and change but the place looked like you hadn't even been there at all."
Eventually Dean found a free bench underneath a bunch of trees and turned off his music. He was barely seated when he looked around and spotted Cas.
"Hey," he mumbled, putting an arm around her shoulders by habit. He could tell she knew something was off about him but chose to ignore her worried look and turn to his friends. "What's up?"
"Are we missing something here? You two know each other?" Balthazar interrupted their conversation. Crowley was trying his very best to hide it but he had been following along too. Just out of curiosity.
"I mean tricking people is one thing but this could have really gotten out of hand. Someone could have get hurt."
