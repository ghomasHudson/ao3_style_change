“Yeah, not exactly child friendly, is it?” John joked. Then a question dawned on him, “What guestroom?” he asked.
“Oh!... It’s fine. It um… yeah it’s fine,” John stammered. He was taken off guard by the quick change in conversation topic. He would’ve liked to know a bit more about why Mycroft was offering Sherlock romantic advice, but he was a bit pleased to hear the detective was still concerned about the cut John had sustained on a recent case.
“Well,” Sherlock replied slyly, “I believe you have my number, Dr. Watson, and I have yours. So I think I give you a kiss goodnight and we make plans to meet again soon, does that sound alright?”
“Well, John is held up in traffic and he asked me to pick up his daughter for him. Rosie, clearly knows me and is comfortable with me watching her until father is able to come retrieve her, but if you’d like I can call John and he can explain the whole situation to you,” Sherlock told her, adopting a falsely chipper air.
“I’m er… feeling a bit peckish, do you want to um…” Sherlock gestured toward the cafe just behind him.
Sherlock finally glanced up from his mobile when the woman said this. “You were lead here by prayer?” he asked with thinly veiled incredulity.
“Did you know?” the question suddenly popped into John’s head and he immediately asked it without thinking.
John knew his feelings for Sherlock were there, and after the last few difficult, grief-filled years after losing Mary, he wanted bring love back into his life. He felt sick with nerves just thinking about it, but he made a promise to himself to tell Sherlock how he felt, when the time was right.
“Alright, well I ‘spose we’ll leave you two it then,” Mike smiled and began to lead Molly off toward another table.
“No,” Sherlock replied tersely . “I’m just taking a lunch break, I believe that’s what you call it, isn’t it, when you take a break to have lunch?”
“I’ll never forget the first time this happened. I sat in the waiting room alone for hours. That was decades ago but I’ll never forget how anxious I felt, worrying if he would be alright.”
The thief ducked into an alley and John followed. He gave one final burst of speed and closed the gap between them. John reached out and grabbed the thief’s upper arm. He would’ve liked to give some catchy, action-film-worthy line like “Where do you think you’re going?”, but things happened too quickly. The moment John had grabbed the criminal, he’d swung around and pulled out a knife. With speed but not much precision the man slashed at John’s arm that was grabbing him. The thief’s knife cut across John’s shoulder (his bad shoulder) and John released his hold on the man, crying out in pain, stumbling backward.
“It was just a joke. I like it, really,” Sherlock said with a smile as he set the box down on the bench and pulled John in  for a kiss. “Happy Valentine’s, John.”
Sorry this one took so long but I hope it was worth the wait! As always, thanks for reading, commenting, etc!
This would be his and Sherlock’s first really high-profile case in a long while, Interpol was even involved. A precious blue diamond had been stolen from international royalty. After some intense detective work (done mostly by Sherlock) they’d tracked the missing jewel to a taxidermy shop owned by the thief’s sister. The criminal had stashed the diamond in the mouth of a stuffed goose for safe keeping. The plan for the day had been to simply stroll into the shop, collect the diamond, and worry about arresting the guilty man later. Unfortunately, the crafty chap had been just a half a step ahead of them. When Sherlock, John and Lestrade arrived at the shop to get the stolen goods, they found the thief there, retrieving his spoils. The man had rushed out of the shop’s back entrance and John and the others had chased after him.
“She’s been overworking herself the past couple of days,” Mike explained. “I think we’d better go perhaps. You’ll let us know if you get any update?”
“It’s alright,” Molly assured him. “Everyone has rows sometimes. He’ll forgive you. He loves you, John, really.”
“I really am sorry, you know,” John said more seriously. “It just came out all wrong and I didn’t mean it the way it sounded. You, being with you like this, having a relationship with you, it’s one of the best things… I mean I haven’t been this happy in years. I mean really-,” John sputtered.
“We thought we’d lost you there,” Sherlock scolded her, ruffling her curls. “Don’t run off like that, alright?”
With that, Sherlock leaned in and pressed his lips lightly against John’s. The kiss was brief, but again John felt as though everything, even time, stopped. This time it wasn’t a feeling of freezing though. This was like melting. It was warm and comforting and there was a sense of releasing something he’d been holding in. There was a burning, an excitement and fire to the feeling too. Then just like that it was over.
“I don’t think that’s the best idea tonight,” Sherlock replied kindly, taking his friend into his room and helping him into his bed.
"And was there any sign of someone breaking into your son’s room?” Sherlock asked, without looking up from his phone which he had been looking at through most of their client’s explanation of her missing son, Lucas. The detective’s tone when he spoke was was cool and matter of fact. John felt a bit annoyed by his nonchalant attitude toward the case at hand, did he not care that a sixteen-year-old boy was missing?
“Well, you only have two shoulders John, even if I did have to guess, which of course I didn’t, I’d have a pretty good chance of getting it right,” Sherlock replied breezily.
“Oh, I know that sweetheart,” John said tenderly, hugging her. God, she was only six, when did she get so wise and sure of herself? “It’s just a little complicated sometimes,” John tried to explain.
John smiled. He knew Sherlock had managed to solve plenty of cases before they’d met and plenty more since when John was too busy to offer his assistance, but he was glad that Sherlock wanted his opinion all the same.
“Credit where credit is due, Mr Holmes,” John countered, wrapping his arms around the other man’s hips.
John chuckled at this, “Seriously though, I’m a bit at my wits end trying to plan a science party, whatever that means in time for Saturday, do you think you could help at all, if you don’t have a case?”
“I am not. I’m the doctor here, not you, me so I will make the diagnostics and I say I am not drunk at all, I’m just having a fun night. Enjoying me-self, myself, is that so wrong?” John stumbled through this declaration of his relative sobriety and Sherlock giggled. It could’ve been annoying but John was not in the habit of overdoing it with the alcohol, the last time Sherlock had seen him this drunk was probably his stag party, so he found the display tonight to be rather cute and endearing.
“Thank you for saving me from myself," John said. What had he ever done to deserve a man who could be so kind and caring?
“Alright, well I suppose we’d better head out then,” John said to her, and with that Rosie ran off to get in the car. John looked up at Sherlock to say goodbye but again found himself lost for words.
John looked at his friend and he knew Sherlock understood. “That’s why we’re here isn’t it?” he said quietly, “You knew seeing that woman reminded me… of Mary.”
“Thank you so much,” John said, grateful and relieved. “I’ll come by Baker Street and get her as soon as I can.”
“Yeah, thanks,” John replied, tiredly. He paid, stood up to leave and almost bumped into the person standing behind him, probably waiting for his seat at the bar. John muttered an apology, “Sorry, didn’t see you.”
“Why don’t you just tell her, then, why wait?” Sherlock shot back, half angry half offended that John felt they needed to keep this from his daughter. Sherlock had always thought Rosie was fond of him. Didn’t John himself said I was good with Rosie? Sherlock thought. But perhaps this was something John only acknowledged grudgingly. Perhaps he thinks I might be a bad influence if I'm around Rosie too much, Sherlock worried.
With that the conversation turned to quips and stories at the expense of London’s finest. They laughed and reminisced about old cases for long past when John had intended to stay. When he finally got up and took his leave from Baker Street, John felt quite sore from spending so long sitting on the hardwood floor, but, he as he headed home, he realized he was in better spirits than he had been in a long time. This was a level of happiness John had forgotten existed or at least had forgotten he could feel. Sarah was right that he needed to get out more; she just wasn’t right about who he needed to get out with.
Sherlock turned around and grabbed John, by the shoulders, “John, it is wonderfully sweet that you care so much about this party, but really why are you so worried? It’s going to be fine.”
“Hello dear, would you like to try a taffy?” A sales girl in a cheery pink uniform shirt approached Rosie and offered her a basket of samples.
“She’s my daughter Sherlock, I’ll tell her when it’s the right time and the right time is not in the middle of a damn candy shop!” John fumed, trying to keep his voice low, and his posture calm. They locked eyes for a moment, angry and hurt, neither wanting to speak and make the situation worse.
“Rosie, don’t run!” John called, but when she didn’t listen, he simply let her go. He was glad to see her so happy and carefree. He had felt lately that Rosie seemed more grown up than most children her age and it made him smile to see his daughter acting with the glee of any other six year old.
“For getting it, for getting that it’s still hard sometimes even though it happened years ago now… And for trying to help by distracting me or cheering me up or whatever,” John replied. They sat quietly for a moment, both sad, but glad to have someone to share their sadness with.  “Rosie’s good,” John broke the silence, trying to steer the conversation back to normal.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, finally sounding angry too now. “Because her father was kissing some crazy sociopath.”
“No,” John replied nervously. He was now regretting his moment of daring but there was no going back. If he was to confess his feelings to Sherlock tonight, which had been his plan, champagne seemed like the perfect, romantic accompaniment. Now that he’d ordered the bottle he was going to have to say the little speech he’d prepared.
“Yes, and I’ve really got to go. I’ll see you later Molly,” Sherlock said as he hurried out the door.
“Hang on,” John said, angry now. “You still haven’t told me why we’re here. Is it about that case we just left? Because I really just can’t… I can’t do that case right now, Sherlock,” John felt himself getting emotional again and, just thinking about the body of the blonde woman laying there, and he took a deep breathe, trying to control himself.
“Alright doctor, but this is the last one because I’m tired and I want to head home,” Sherlock argued. “Here, in fact, let me help you finish that.” He took a drink from John’s glass.
“With the average person, it might be, but with you? No, so fess up Sherlock,” John snapped at his friend. The bartender brought over their beers and John immediately took a swig of his, he was going to need it to deal with Sherlock tonight.
“I’ll talk to him tomorrow when we get home,” John assured her. “You know this doesn’t change the fact that you are the most important thing in my life, right? Even more, than Sherlock, even more than myself,” John his daughter very seriously.
As the kiss ended they turned to look at the view, as the setting sun lit up the London skyline, and to the detective and his blogger, the city had never looked more beautiful.
“Here we are gentlemen.” The waiter reappeared with the champagne. He popped the bottle’s cork, poured each of them a glass and then set vessel of ice on the table and placed the champagne bottle in it. “Are you gentlemen ready to order or do you need a moment longer with the menu?” He asked politely. John ordered a steak and Sherlock got the lobster, and the waiter left them, promising the wait wouldn’t be long.
“I don’t know Sherlock,” John was sounding tired and slightly exasperated, even though he didn’t really mean or want to; he wasn’t angry and he didn’t want Sherlock to think he was. “I think maybe we should go away, just for a couple nights. You, me and Rosie, to the ocean maybe, I don’t know, just have a little time to ourselves, to be ourselves. And then maybe we’ll tell everybody when we get back, eh?” John suggested hopefully.
“Well, to be fair, she might very well have had an awful day, but still you would think she would just say that if it were the case…” Sherlock trailed off thoughtfully, as though he were beginning to try to unravel ‘The Tale of the Deplorable Date’.
“It sounds like it’s alright for Rosie to go home with Mr. Holmes then? That’s ok with you?” Ms Jones asked John kindly.
Unlucky chapter number 13... this one's a doozy and not in a fun way... lots of angst... you've been warned... but please stick with it through the next couple chapters because I'm really all about the fluff and lovey stuff and there's more of that on it's way!
After John met Mary, sticking to women seemed like a fine choice. Oh, Mary. She had been such an amazing presence in his life. John felt complete when he was with her; he felt understood too. He’d never believed in the notion of soulmates or true love until he’d met her. Certainly their relationship hadn’t always been perfect, but John had never felt so strongly about another person, man or woman. Until now.
“Well I can’t disturb the experiment in the kitchen, I working on something… you probably don’t want to know the details of when you’re about to eat. And I’d just gotten my papers in here all sorted out when you called” He waved his hand toward the stacks that covered the front room’s furniture, which looked like the biggest mess John had ever seen.
“Well then I suppose I’d probably best be off too,” Lestrade said. “I’ll call Molly. We’ll all come by tomorrow, but you two can have a moment to yourselves today.”
“But sometimes it fits,” Rosie argued. “And if anybody isn’t ok with you and Sherlock being in love they’re a right arse,” she declared. “I think he’s wonderful and if he loves you and you love him, that’s good because being in love makes people happy, and I want to be happy, Daddy,” she said fiercely.
It turned out they were really not up for the challenge at all, but they enjoyed attempting sand artistry nonetheless. They had gotten early the next morning and had a light breakfast of pastries John had driven into town and picked up at a cafe. Then they’d headed straight to the beach. It was chilly out and the brisk wind only made it worse so the beach was fairly deserted, but they dressed warmly and enjoyed hours playing in the sand.
“Fine,” John sighed. “Maybe… It’s a birthday… Or an anniversary, this place is pretty romantic so maybe that’s it… And I think he’s wearing a wedding ring so that would make sense… But he’s alone so she, well I’m assuming she, but either way, the other person…maybe the other person got sicka and that’s where the savings went, to medical expenses… That might be a stretch but we know…” John trailed off. “We know the old man’s a widower,” he said quietly. What had started out as a silly game had suddenly turned very serious. John looked down at his hands and then took another good gulp of his drink. He was struck by the realization of what he and the glum, lonely looking older man had in common. It made him feel very empty and alone himself.
“We really can’t say, she wants to keep this under wraps and we’ve probably already said too much,” Sherlock replied.
“You,” John jabbed Sherlock in the chest, “Will do no such thing. I will have as many of these as I choose,” he proclaimed haughtily, taking a swig of his drink.
The cab pulled up to their destination and John and Sherlock got out. It was raining. John stood on the sidewalk, shaking from the cold and his mounting anxiety, as Sherlock paid the cabby.
“I love it, really. It’s very me, John. You’ll have to add this to the blog now, ‘The Case of The Unknown Filling.”
John also felt extremely pleased that Sherlock was calling him smart. He wanted to say so but he couldn’t find the words all of a sudden. He felt all flustered and he was still blushing like a schoolgirl when Rosie reappeared.
John sighed, when Rosie wanted to tell you something there was no putting it off. But he loved that about her, she was like her mother, headstrong and determined. “What’s alright, sweetheart?” he replied.
“Right so baking soda volcanoes, and making slime, you’re sure they’ll like this?” John said nervously, looking at the supplies laid out in his backyard.
John handed Sherlock back his phone, the detective was right, anybody could piece together what had happened after a quick look at some of Lucas’s posts.
“Thank you, John, I’ll see you in an hour or so,” Sherlock signed off and hung up. In his car, John gave a long, exhausted sigh.
“Thank you. So after she told me I was disappointingly short, I tried to sort of laugh it off. Figured maybe she was nervous and just trying to be funny and it came out wrong, but she didn’t seem to treat it as a joke at all. And she followed it up by asking how old I was because she was 44 and not interested in dating an older man. And then when I told her I the same age she responded with ‘Really? well that’s good’ like she’d been thinking I was older,” John paused to take a breath, he was really getting riled up. “You want to say something smart about that?” he snapped at Sherlock.
“Well, considering how the date turned out, I suppose I’m glad you showed up,” John admitted, still unable to look at his friend.
“I’m serious and I’ll prove it to you,” Sherlock insisted. “Pick someone in this room, anyone and tell me everything you can about who they are by observation. You’ll come up with more than you would expect, I guarantee.”
“John!” Sherlock yelled, and he appeared suddenly to catch John. Lestrade ran up next but Sherlock waved him ahead, “Go catch him; I’ll stay with John!”
“Excellent, John,” Sherlock smiled. “Angelo seems to feel he will forever be indebted to me and thus when I asked him to teach me a simple classic dish he agreed.”
***Warning that this one is somewhat intense so if that might bug you, just skip to the end notes, I'll summarize it***
Sherlock shrugged. “She asked me what I liked to. I said 'play the violin and solve crimes' and she thought the second of those things sounded much more interesting,” he explained mildly. “She was a bit of a natural.” Then he smiled slyly. “She’s quite bright for her age, but then of course we know where she gets her smarts from,” Sherlock said smoothly.
God she was sharp. “Something’s happened sweetie and Sherlock’s in the hospital. We’re going to go see him though, and he’ll be okay,” John assured his daughter. As they headed out the door, he silently prayed that was right.
“Yes, cheers.” John clinked his glass against his friend’s and took a good gulp of the bubbly liquid, hoping for some alcohol-induced courage to come to his aide before the meal was through.
“I just want this relationship to be ours, just ours for a little bit before we have to share it with everyone. I want us to figure out us, before we have to explain it to all our friends, you know?”
“Yes, yes, it’s me. I’m here and I’m so, so sorry, love, can you ever forgive me?” Tears were cascading down John’s face now. Just seeing Sherlock’s eyes looking into his, and the relief and the love John felt overwhelmed him.
“Well beggars can’t be choosers can they?” Sherlock snapped as he joined John on the floor and started tucking into the take away. “Eggroll?”
“Yes, that is what you call it,” Molly said with a smile, “I’ve just never known you to be someone who went in for those things.”
“What’s the point?” John responded with a happiness that was partially the buzz from finishing his last pint too quickly and partially the excitement at his own boldness. “Anyway he’s right, my night is going much better now.”
“That’s good. I was wondering since that is the shoulder where you were shot in Afghanistan, correct?”
“You boys need another round?” the bartender cut in suddenly. “Night’s going better now, uh?” he added with a wink to John.
They just sat there like that for a moment, smiling at each other, a tinge of sadness lurking just outside the glowing happiness of their world together. They were two men who had been through so much, who still carried so much pain, and yet they had found each other and together they had found love and joy.
Now he recognized the same warm, joyous feelings, when he was with Sherlock. He felt drawn to his friend in a way that he never had before, but it was the same pull he had felt toward Mary. Was it wrong to be falling in love again? He knew it wasn’t of course. Mary would want him to be happy, and she had always liked Sherlock. It made sense in a lot of ways too, John realized, Sherlock, like Mary, excited John, amazed him with his talents and intelligence. He understood and shared John’s need for adventure. Sherlock was understanding and caring, at least with John and his friends, perhaps not with everyone. Rosie liked him which was of course a must for anyone John would seriously consider a longterm relationship with. After all these years and everything they’d been through, John couldn’t deny he and Sherlock made a good match; they fit each other. There was no telling what would happen if they introduced romance into the situation, but now he had no good reason not to try.
Sherlock gave him an annoyed glance. What the bloody hell was he thinking coming up with a stupid lie like that? Now, of course they were going to ask-
Before they went back to the cottage, Sherlock stopped by a local market and picked up groceries to make dinner. John tried to convince him that cooking was not a part of vacation and they should be eating out but Sherlock insisted he didn’t cook often and this was something he wanted to do. John wondered if this was some attempt to make up for the fight earlier, in which case he felt he should be the one cooking the apology meal. In truth, Sherlock just wanted to put that behind them and return to the loving family mood that had surrounded them that morning at the beach.
“You’d better slow down there, John, or I’ll have to cut you off,” Sherlock teased. Their fifth date had started with dinner, which had been so lovely they’d decided to let the night continue at the pub, where John had downed one drink after another in fairly quick succession.
“Oh I don’t about that,” Sherlock said, pulling out his mobile. “Look at this, Rosie.” He turned around in the passenger seat and showed her a photo online on his phone of an intricate sand sculpture from some competition or other.
Once she’d left, John and Sherlock stood there for a long moment, letting the anger that had almost palpably filled the room dissipate. “Christ’s sake, what was that?” John exclaimed.
“I don’t have to think about it John,” Sherlock’s voice was flat and calm. John didn’t turn to look at his friend, he couldn’t, he had no idea if what was coming was good or bad. “I have feelings for you too,” he said simply.
“Yes,” John replied nervously, standing immediately and stiffly, almost as if he were standing at attention.
John turned away from the cab he’d been hailing and looked back, surprised to see Sherlock had left the case to come after him.
“It might be a bit cold for swimming,” John warned his daughter. He looked in the rearview mirror and saw her pouting face.
“I’m sorry… I’m not feeling so well all of a sudden,” John said, trying to sound calm and collected. “I think I’d better get a taxi and head home.”
“He’s stable now, but he’s resting. We’ve done what we can for him, and the next few days won’t be pleasant but he’ll pull through. You can go and see him if you’d like, first room on the left, 115.” She looked over the pages on the clipboard she was holding and then walked over to another group in the waiting area.
John’s whole body felt like ice, and it wasn’t just from being out in the cold rain. This was the moment of truth. Sherlock was going to respond to his admission. John felt as though everything, him, Sherlock, time had suddenly frozen. There was really no going back now.
“Mycroft recommended it,” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, not looking up from his menu. “He brings dignitaries and various important and stuck up people here for work. I used his name to get the reservation actually.”
“Somehow I don’t believe you’re capable of hurting me,” Sherlock said, his voice tender but serious.
John checked his mobile again, but there was only another missed call from Mycroft. Damn, that man was good at keeping an eye on people. But there was no word yet from Sherlock, John had texted and called and he was starting to get worried, but if he had to he would just show up at Baker St in person and beg forgiveness. Rosie was upstairs getting her things together so it wouldn’t be long before they left for London.
“Well yes but… Not like that… I mean Rosie’s here and she doesn’t know and I want to tell her before she figures it out. And you know her it wouldn’t take much to tip her off.” John was backpedaling and it wasn’t going well. How were they actually having this fight under their breath in the middle of a candy shop?
“But it isn’t, if you love each other, you should be together, so tell him to come back,” Rosie pleaded, breaking their embrace.
At the same time, Sherlock tightened the muscles of his neck instinctively and moved his head and twisted to his left as far as he could.  The sudden movement away from his knife as well as John’s puzzling code word made the Sheriff blink.
“Are you ready, Steven?” asked John Watson as he readied the web-cam attachment on his laptop.  Steven Rogers propped up the frosted cake with the gorgeous maraschino cherries, frosting and sugar-beaded rosettes with the red, white, and blue sparkler candle standing in the middle.
“And we’re with you both until the end of the line…” John murmured as he rested his cheek against Bucky’s chest.
Before Sherlock could even protest or writhe away, he then found himself firmly sandwiched between Steven Rogers and John, enveloped in Steven’s arms in a hearty embrace.
“…anyone want to take a picture?” whispered one civilian who was witnessing this, awestruck from the sidelines.  Next to the tourist, one teenage girl was frantically texting this status update on her cell phone before she blinked.
comforting about that sentence,” Mycroft intoned disapprovingly with a glare as Deadpool was thrown down rugby-style by Mrs. Holmes before he could reach the nearest window.
Robin got the strangest feeling that an apology from the consulting detective didn’t happen very often given the way John’s stoic veneer had a faint ripple of concerned emotion underneath.
“What in tarnation - ?!” gasped the Sheriff as screams, yells, and chaos of the immense bedlam rang throughout the castle of Prince John seconds after the lightning bolts rained down from the skies above.
?  Now I’ve heard everything.  Anyway, if you be so kind as to relinquish your key card and accompany us for the doors for the hand and retina scanners, there will be no need for dismemberment.  Unlike this cur, I am associated with MI-6, and I can promise you safety and witness protection by the British government.”
Uncovering the bruschetta and antipasto, Angelo smiled as he said, “Actually, having the Guardians travel all the way from space to taste my cooking is the highest form of a compliment I can think of.”
Sherlock hurried over to John, slicing through John’s ropes with a stolen knife before swiftly tearing the Semtex vest off John’s body.
The android titled his head before he stated, “Sherlock Holmes has sustained a broken ankle, multiple contusions across his chest, head, and face from physical altercations, a slight concussion, hemorrhaging of his fingers from four pulled fingernails, a stab wound from a dagger in his side, three infected scorch marks set into his skin around the collarbone, internal bruising of tissue around his kidneys, and two broken ribs.  Therefore, immediate attention shall be directed to Sherlock Holmes as of now.”
- living a boring-ass life in the middle of nowhere, making sure your little guy doesn’t get anywhere near a plane without a parachute or get into a fight he’s too stupid to run away from without backup?”
“Only if you don’t mind slowing down for a solider with a limp?” John huffed good-naturedly as grasped Bucky’s hands.
Hydra base in England to approach?” Sherlock drawled snidely as the military aircraft left the runway, with several soldiers jumping up and down from the sidelines, hopping mad at the theft.  Mycroft just glared disapprovingly while Anthea just typed away idly on her phone next to him.
Like a ray of light, John’s Keyblade shot forward, swift and sure and expeditious, tearing through the distance and air directly at Sherlock’s captors within a blink of an eye.
“Well, come on,” said Sherlock, with a smile, “On that gloomy note, let’s have our date, shall we Doctor Watson?”
“Ah,” John said with a nod. This made sense, of course, and John knew he had no right to be bothered by it. He had been the one to move out, after all. Somehow it still hurt him, though, thinking about Sherlock removing the idea of John Watson from 221b. He sighed. “Why don’t you go get your things from upstairs so we can head out,” he said to Rosie, and she obediently head back up the stairs.
John turned to look at his friend then. He couldn’t speak, but he gazed at Sherlock. He watched as the rain drops ran down his face, dripping off his eyelashes, his perfect, chiseled jawline. Looking at Sherlock’s expression, John knew he was sincere. In that warm, genuine smile, John saw that Sherlock’s affection for him was very real. This was really happening. Sherlock had feelings for John, just as John had for him.
“Chance with what?” Sherlock asked, already back on his train of thought about what to get John. Would he like roses? They’d certainly made Molly happy, but it felt too traditional.
“Well that might be a bit of a problem,” Ms Jones said, her sweet tone and smile, not matching her words. “You see only family members and those authorized by family members are allowed to take the children home from school, for safety reasons, you understand, and I’m afraid you are neither of those things,” she explained apologetically.
John wanted to be really mad about the blatant invasion of privacy, but he found he felt somewhat touched by the fact that Sherlock and remember his and Mary’s special day. His friend knew him well. And just thinking about Mary calmed him down too; she had always been willing to give Sherlock a chance, even when he was being particularly impossible.
Knew who? What on earth was she going on about now? “Hmm, what’s that?” Sherlock asked, trying to sound as though he were actually interested and not focusing his real attention on coming up with a gift for John.
“Alright, due tell then. I want to hear all of it,” Sherlock prompted him in a flat voice, making John feel more like a client giving particulars of a case than a friends spilling the details on a bad date.
I'm sorry this one took so long, sometimes life just gets in the way, but there's more to come and it should come more quickly I hope!
“Everything’s fine, John, I’m at the school now, actually,” Sherlock replied evenly. “Rosie’s teacher just needed some confirmation that it was ok for me to take her home so they asked me to give you a call.”
Then suddenly a black car with tinted windows pulled up beside him. The back seat window rolled down and Mycroft Holmes smiled up at him icily.
“You’re on speaker, John, so you are talking to them, right now,” Sherlock said, trying not to find the situation amusing and glancing up at see the teacher’s reaction.
John rolled his eyes, “Yes we do; Mary because it’s not from me,” he said, irritated and not in the mood for Sherlock’s jokes at his expense.
“Certainly no one at Scotland Yard liked it when I showed off my deductive skills upon first being introduced,” Sherlock said ruefully.
Sherlock looked up to see she was smiling broadly and carrying a vase full of red roses. “What on earth are those for?” he asked, gesturing to the roses.
Sherlock, who had been kneeling, inspecting the dead woman’s body for clues, stood up and watched John walk away. He had a thoughtful look on his face as though he was still thinking about the case, or perhaps he was solving another puzzle, but his deduction skills were clearly hard at work.
“Got stood up, uh mate?” the bartender asked, reading the situation in a flash when he came over to take John’s glass.
“Sherlock, I’m fine it’s not a bad cut,” John protested, embarrassed. He couldn’t believe he’d been beaten so easily but it had been a long while since he’d been a in a combat situation.
John looked at Sherlock lying in the hospital bed; he looked so pale and sick and small somehow. John’s heart just broke in that moment. He let out a little half sob, half gasp, and fell to his knees by the bed, taking Sherlock’s hand in both of his.
John turned a deep red. So it wasn’t a joke. Of course it wasn’t, Sherlock wasn’t that mean. Right now he was actually being quite complimentary and John felt bad for assuming Sherlock was trying to be cruel when his was just being nice.
“This is a pretty nice place,” John commented gazing around the black-tie-only-type restaurant and down at the rather pricey list of menu items.
“Yes, I’m really turning out to be much more dependable than this friend of Sarah’s aren’t I?” Sherlock joked.
“It’s a pity Lestrade will get all the credit for my work on the diamond case,” Sherlock commented, after a moment. “But I suppose saving you is something of a consultation,” he added coolly.
“The ambulance,” Sherlock said, looking worried again. “John, are you sure you’re alright? Are you feeling light-headed?”
“We were meeting a client, about a case,” Sherlock replied calmly. “The restaurant was a special request on her part.”
I didn't want to end it like this but that's where this story's going and fair warning sometimes things get darker before they get better...
without having told a word to anyone. He wouldn't have expected him to have many friends, and he didn't have to wonder why.
Who knows, maybe we'll read again! (I have some more stories and no sense of subtle self-promotion. *awkwardly flies into the sun*)
"Oh, he has killed already. This is not just about preventing murders. It is also about solving the crimes he has committed in the past. Finding the victims and the place where he keeps the dead bodies. About finding..." He stopped, suddenly worried to say too much.
He cleared his throat once while she prepared his drink. Distrust was his companion at all times. It felt a little strange, being here. Not quite like a vacation, but not quite like having arrived somewhere. He found himself between this laughing, drinking, celebrating folk, being so close to the citizens that he had sworn to keep from harm a long, long time ago, and yet it was the foreignness that filled him up the most. He didn't belong here. He was meant to be out there, in the dark. Fighting. Dying for each and everyone of them. For their sakes, just like the literal equivalent of the knight in shining armour ought to.
"Yes," Sherlock told him. He hadn't looked up nor made a move. "Enjoy the little pleasures of life while I cannot."
Sherlock's body was tense. Frustration was worn like a second skin. He had given up everything, all of him, and yet he was not able to quit all emotion.
“You stupid punk…” Bucky growled as he helped Steve stand up, using his body for Captain America to utilize as a lean-to.  Upon a closer look, Bucky noted to his budding anger that Steve had far more injuries than the photos indicated.
“Do you, John Hamish Watson, despite all the crap and crazy escapades you get into with him, take William Scott Sherlock Holmes as your husband and partner?  Through every close-call, near-death experience, crazy-assed scheme, and the fact that you’re probably going to be his babysitter and inform him when he’s not good until the end of your days?”
“Our stores of gunpowder!  The castle is collapsing!” hollered a Rat Guard (thankfully not one of the Heartless but rather a living and breathing animal serving Prince John) as a major portion of the citadel buckled from the resulting detonation.
The Sheriff screamed and screamed and screamed bone-chillingly in a high-pitched tone of terror as he feebly tried to push the heavy beast off him, his punches and knife doing inconsequential damage to Bronx’s tough hide.
Surprising everyone, Nick Fury had an actual license to stand as wedding officiant.  It was a wee bit odd seeing the ex-director of S.H.I.E.L.D standing in the altar, in leather trench coat and eyepatch, giving a deadpanned expression as he started the ceremonial script.
Robin then heard the distinct sound of propulsion engines and hover boots before he turned to the skies above to see a familiar, white inflatable robot in red armor and Hiro (riding on Baymax’s back).
“I have an idea…” Sherlock whispered as he and Bucky peeked around the corner from their vantage point of the roof.
Lestrade would have broken down and cried for every tourist, Londoner, and officer he lost from this sudden attack if it could have helped.
“I believe having someone attempt to ruin our son’s wedding may have something to do with that, Molly,” Mr. Holmes sighed as he rubbed his eyes.
“I’ve received enough kisses from you, Barnes.  Go kiss your husband,” John growled playfully, though he allowed Bucky to whimper with puppy dog eyes.
“John…” whispered Sherlock in his blogger’s ear as he instinctively hugged John close. As the Heartless was now less than a foot away…
Nick Fury then said with a flourish, throwing up a hand and actually smiling, “Then by the powers vested in me, I now declare you all husbands, partners, and friends.  Now put on the rings, kiss each other stupid, and let’s eat!”
The Cloak of Levitation brought Rosie in view who looked at the camera with her big, beautiful eyes as the Cloak waved on.
John, sighing at Sherlock’s obliviousness, answered, “We have absolutely no idea.  They just appeared.”
just shield me from your ideas and plans in a misguided effort to keep me safe like the idiot you are.  Because of it, the others took turns watching me to make sure I didn’t sneak off by myself.”
live with myself knowing that I came close to killing the most famous Consulting Detective in all of England?”
In that split second, John could only think how it wasn’t so bad, dying this way.  At least Sherlock wasn’t going to leave him behind a second time, wasn’t going to abandon him like Mary…
Sherlock?" John demanded suddenly, the words bursting out through his almost silent sobs, his face still half-buried in Sherlock's stomach. "Do you know why?...I need to tell you…Sherlock, I
On the left turn, as their knees pressed together once again with the movement of the cab, Greg found Mycroft’s fingers there instead of the bony prominences of his knee. And so Mycroft's plan worked perfectly. Greg reached down and took hold of the long, elegant fingers, first gently interlacing them with the back of his own, and then lifting them and bringing Mycroft’s hand over to his own knee where he then enfolded Mycroft’s hand in his own in a tight, warm clasp; in the dark secrecy of the cab holding it much more fully than he had at the table in the restaurant.
Agatha had put her hat on but was taking her time fishing out her own prize, which was stuck somehow inside the larger end of the cracker that she had held onto. Meanwhile, in Mycroft's cracker was a metal puzzle of joined silver rings which needed to be separated to provide a solution.
Dear patient Mystraders/Gregcrofters: This is the chapter you've been waiting for...well, the start of what you've been waiting for anyway! I promise there's so much more to come...
“That you wanted to…you know…meet me. For dinner,” said Greg. He looked like he still couldn't believe his luck.
Deep down he felt guilty because he knew he had asked Mary to marry him for completely the wrong reasons. Yes, he had loved her and was grateful to her for bringing him out of the hell he had been in without Sherlock, but was that a reason to ask someone to marry you?
"They're not all like this," said John, in its defence. "They're gradually phasing these older ones out, anyway." He didn't mind the older trains, they had character, like old houses.
Is that all I get?” asked Greg, lowering his glass, pretending to be quite dismayed. Mycroft smiled wryly. He thought he’d been extremely honest already. As much as he realised that Greg was teasing him here, he also realised he was going to have to
but—” now he turned his attention to Siger, who didn’t know whether to apologise for that remark or not, “—no, you’re quite right, Siger, they do. They are!” He grinned, making Siger look relieved. “I’ve never heard Old Year’s Night; my grandparents always called it Hogmanay, but I do remember many a fairly glum phrase from my Scottish grandfather, actually! I think one of his favourites was—” and here John suddenly adopted the melodic Highland accent of his forebears “—‘Aye, a green Christmas fills the churchyard!'” He sang it out in the way that his grandfather used to say it. Which was almost cheerfully. Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked at him.
Gabriella was shaking her head at all of this, not in disagreement, but in amazement. Sherlock acknowledged her with a simple hand gesture and carried on, “The gallery owner remarked that you had both used the phrase
like you.” The whole thing simply rocked Mycroft’s world. He felt all at once, dizzy with desire, and with a deep, delicious clench of his stomach, found he was suddenly - embarrassingly - rather hot under the collar. Greg’s hand, which had been resting on the tablecloth, slid over and his fingers just touched Mycroft’s where they rested on the base of his wine glass. Mycroft had a hard time keeping his composure at that, but he maintained it and merely smiled in an encouraging way. Greg took this as the ‘yes’ that it was and moved his fingers up to lightly cover Mycroft’s. Now they were holding the base of the glass together, but somehow it didn't feel foolish. To Mycroft it was just…
he had consciously admitted the truth to himself, and so now it really couldn't harp on about it subconsciously anymore. He had solved the problem of why he felt differently about John, and now that knowledge existed secretly in his mind.
He surreptitiously lowered the Sunday Times and looked over the top at John. To check things were still…
thought John, delirious with lust and happiness. John was so close and he could see Sherlock must be too. Sherlock had his eyes closed, his full lips parted, his sensuous mouth slightly open. He had never looked more strikingly beautiful to John as he did at that moment. He looked like an angel caught in the midst of having sex.
he moaned again, mostly to himself, as he squeezed it quite pleasingly hard. Mycroft’s auditory mind palace Greg-room was having to enlarge itself exponentially for all this vocal delight. Let alone all the visuals. The sensations and feelings he really didn't know quite what to do with yet… He lowered his head to kiss Greg, holding himself up on one forearm, with his fingers in Greg’s hair, and his other hand slipping under Greg’s shoulder; pressing his pelvis and rolling his hips slowly against Greg’s, the oil squelching filthily and silkily between them. Mycroft released Greg’s mouth to gasp at the slick sensation as their lower bodies began to slide against each other frictionlessly. “Gosh,” Mycroft whispered, “this is rather…”
you doing, then?’ said John, “Because there’s clearly something Secret Squirrel going on at this table…”
Well, it's taken me long enough to get this chapter out! Not a very seasonal setting right now, but do you know what? I no longer care. I'm writing it, I'm posting it, I
she said enthusiastically, like he’d just kindly offered her one. As he walked through into the kitchen to do it she added over her shoulder, “Oh yes please, a double would be fine, Sherlock!”  - as if he’d offered that too, John thought. He heard Siger laughing from the kitchen.
Mycroft could see what was going on here and he chose to rise above it. "As far as I am currently aware, all is well at home and Her Majesty is presently enjoying the delights of her Sandringham estate." Then he raised his eyebrows in an expression that clearly read,
John put down his knife and fork and took them both from her, holding the fish carefully between his fingertips in one hand and the paper in the other, and addressed the table. “Ok, you hold the fish loosely in your open palm and it tells your fortune by the movements it makes.” He waved the slip of paper, “These are the movements that the fish makes and what they mean…” and then he glanced down to read them.
to tell you—“ his voice was choked with tears and muffled from speaking the words almost directly into Sherlock's shirt, and he said something else then, something that Sherlock couldn’t quite catch - it had sounded a bit like, “I’m glad,” but it couldn’t have been that.
’ thought John, now understanding the mischievous glint. "You read my books?" he said, somewhat crossly.
There were different kinds of love, he knew that. And he'd known her for such a short time. He'd wanted to offer her something in return for saving him. Because she had. And he really had been very fond of her. She was beautiful, clever, charming, funny. He had loved her. He had been grateful to her. She had genuinely made him laugh again.
John was in the middle of drafting out a referral letter for a patient whom he needed to send to see a consultant. He sighed.
Mycroft breathed in again sharply. ‘Get a grip, man,’ he told himself, ‘for Heaven’s sake you’re gasping like a teenage—’ but then Gregory brought his mouth very close to Mycroft’s left ear, deliberately leaning himself across Mycroft’s body to do it. “What else?” he demanded gently, his wandering hand now sliding round towards the back of the prominent bony curve of Mycroft’s hipbone and down and round onto his arse.
Sherlock had stayed in the pantry. “Sherlock, darling, while you’re in there,” called Lucia, cutting out neat circles of pastry as she spoke, “Could you find me the new pot of—”
John was embarrassed by the use of the word 'massage' but yes, that was what it was and that was what he was offering.
Now he looked properly at them, and saw what he had missed; a large old black and white photo of a smiling couple in their early twenties, a handsome, clearly brown-skinned man in R.A.F uniform, and sporting a very full moustache, his arm draped around the shoulders of a pretty fair-haired woman, and the second photo of the same man kneeling down with his arm around the shoulders of a small child with plaits aged about eight or nine; clearly this was Clarissa and her father. But Sherlock had moved on. Pointing at a slim wooden case on the wall sited between two bookshelves and behind John’s head - John hadn’t even noticed it there - Sherlock said, “The medals in the case, the age of them - clearly your father’s, and your very unusual accent - I can hear rural Suffolk most keenly in the vowels, so - early childhood at Mildenhall.”
“It’s…both of our phones.  But I never programmed a ringtone,” the ex-Hydra soldier stated slowly, feeling sick.
“Semtex…” Sherlock reported on Lestrade’s walkie-talkie as a warning to the Met (and his brother), “
Another video clip then played with the impeccably-dressed Jim Moriarty, very much alive and healthy (for a criminal mastermind who put a gun to his mouth), cheerfully waving to the camera like a gleeful child.  With snake-like eyes and an elatedly manic expression, the psychopath sang, “To the Manchurian Failure and the Consulting Crapsack,
Various screams rang throughout the bastion as a good number of Prince John’s sentries were quickly blown away by a powerful and localized hurricane and besieged by pellets of hail, ice chunks larger than golf balls.
More and more explosions began to ring throughout the city of Westminster, invoking screams and cries of the civilians as the Yard did their best to stop the destruction from becoming graver.
Quite a few winced in surprise as Coulson and the others caught up with Wade Wilson as Natasha and Violet Holmes both began wailing the wedding crasher.
of whatever that asshole does, so we all know you’ll say ‘I do’ like the loyal, nostalgic dumbass you always were.”
The castle was now in flames and starting to resemble Swiss cheese with all the holes and damage it took…
John chuckled as he helped Steve with the heavy cake platter, “Yes, Groot, you are fine the way you are.”
Callously rinsing all his mold and bacteria samples from the past two months in his petri dishes through the dishwasher?
Sherlock and Bucky’s eyes widened; Hydra had impeccable timing and clearly anticipated Steve and John’s rescue….
“I thought that would get your attention,” the Sheriff bragged as he then dug the edge of the dagger closer to Sherlock’s neck, biting into the man’s skin, “So, do we have a deal?”
They both watched on for several more seconds before Steve groaned, “Please tell me Sherlock isn’t coming to Buck’s defense by deducting embarrassing stuff about the Chief Super.”
“I believe you’ve lost something, Doctor Watson,” the Sheriff said smugly before calling out, “Meet the Head Executioner.”
Both Steven and John had obviously just gone through a horrific beating before this next photo was taken.  Dazed and barely conscious, John and Steven were displaying bloody bruises and injuries across their faces.  Despite the likely concussions, both John and Steven were forced to raise their heads up in order to look at the camera by the mercenary Crossbones, yanking them both cruelly by the hair.  John was wincing in pain, one eyes swollen shut due to the blooming red all around his face and his nose was bleeding and dripping on his woolen jumper.  Steve was actually much, much worse (Brock Rumlow clearly took pleasure in satisfying his grudge).  One side of Steven’s face was smeared with blood, and Steve was biting down on the rag stuffed in his mouth in agony with gritted teeth, trying cope with the discomfort of his recent thrashing.  And to Bucky’s dread, Steven’s right arm was at an odd and horrific angle, with a bit of bone jabbing out the skin and flesh.
Meanwhile, watching from a hidden corner away from the Courtyard, Prince John finished vomiting the contents of his stomach at the sight of Bronx killing his second-in-command before apprehensively wiping the bile from his mouth, terrified and out of his mind with anxiety.
“Ready, John,” Steve replied before he turned to the magical cloak that was safely holding Rosie Watson in the crooks of one corner of its cape and a wrapped present in the other.
” screamed the same rhinoceros, now missing his horn (and a few teeth), his voice an octave higher in terror as his comrades withdrew away as fast as they could.
rather funny to see Kelley grab our two prats by the ears and force them both clean up the mess they left in her restaurant during their last fight,” John laughed.
Dimmock looked at Mycroft Holmes and Nick Fury as if he was asked to face down a pit of man-eating lions without any sort of weapon, wondering just what the hell he got himself into.
“You’re here to give the public appearance of Scotland Yard’s contribution with taking down the Hydra base and counteracting their terrorist activities in England with MI-6,” Fury intoned, “Since S.H.I.E.L.D and I need to work in the shadows, we can’t risk any light or exposure on our role in this.  In other words, you will bask in the glory of taking the credit for this Hydra scion in the press, and your only task is to stand in front of the camera, look pretty, and answer stupid questions and calm the dumbasses down while we take care of any lingering traces.”
Robin Hood winced at the deep gashes the Heartless left on his arm when it tried to stab him; it was deep, bleeding heavily, and was most likely going to require stitches.
” howled Bronx as the blue-skinned beast rigorously slammed himself into the Sheriff and set upon the corrupt officer in a furious rage, ripping with his claws and biting with his teeth, blood and bits of stained cloth and flesh flying everywhere.
Before Robin Hood could try to make a move, the Sheriff then brought his dagger to Sherlock’s neck, centimeters from slashing his throat.  Sherlock winced, but he managed to suppress the groan out of his mouth as he continued to blink.
Bound and gagged, John Watson and Steven Rogers were glaring angrily at the camera as their photo was being taken.  With their hands tied behind their backs and forced on their knees, they were unable to try anything, considering that both were wearing familiar vests with packets of Semtex explosives sewn into them.  And Steven had additional safeguards as Bucky spotted the power-damper collar around Steven’s neck, like a dog, inhibiting Steve and weakening him enough to be kidnapped without much hassle.
“With us is our current associate and guide for the Keyblades, the good chap whose shoulders we are currently riding on, the Captain of the Royal Guards of his Majesty, King Mickey of the Magical Kingdom: Captain Goofy.”
Bucky had one corner of his mouth twitch upwards in a rueful grin before he could force himself to admit it.
Robin Hood blinked and looked up at John Watson, the light of comprehension slowly dawning on his face.  Sherlock felt his face go slack with confused disbelief as John then opened his watering eyes and looked intently at Sherlock.
“Hey, leave some of Buck for me, John…” teased Steven as he ambled over, hopping on his good leg, and embracing
“Ah, so that’s why he’s here,” Steve realized out loud as he and John watched the Chief Superintendent, frothing and purple-faced with rage, hopping up and down on the pavement and having an absolute screaming fit.  Interesting that they could hear the Chief’s screaming over the wailing sirens.
“Not only did we want to give you our compliments, but we created this movie to say a few things that all four of us have been meaning to tell you for quite some time as a toast,” Steve disclosed.
“Your art blog has touched the lives of many people who need a bit of laughter and joy over our escapades, and it is a honor of the highest level to be able to witness you draw Sherlock and I.  Bloody hell, you have more subscribers to your blog than me!  If that does not show an upbeat purpose, I don’t know what will,” John praised.
Mycroft knew the game well as he returned emotionlessly, “There are plans in place should that ever occur as well as additional safeguards for John Watson and Steven Rogers.  Along with the Avengers and their…associates, of course.”
.  As my obligation as a law-abiding citizen of London, I simply adhered to my responsibility of civic duty to call the local tow truck for your obvious parking violation.”
Basil gently tugged on the end of John’s hair at the back of his neck, uttering urgently, “Hiro, Scrooge, and Jim are about to cause a distraction.  You and Robin must be ready when the ruckus starts, all right chap?  We
Both Steven and John had to physically restrain Sherlock from using his microscope to bash an unrepentant Bucky’s skull in.
John felt the memories of Saint Barts rush into his head, the agony, the haunting pain and loss, the infinite times John flashed back and wondered what he could have done differently…
Coulson did not look up from his holographic tablet interface nor did his blank expression falter, but one corner of his mouth twitched in displeasure at the subtle threat against Steven Rogers.  Anderson and Lestrade looked at Mycroft in slight alarm.  Sally Donovan however gave a disgusted side-eye at Mycroft.
All Bucky had to do was imagine Sherlock’s face and head on each Hydra foot-soldier right before he slaughtered them; it was actually
John then felt Sherlock’s fingers latch around his hand, ice-cold but when the doctor looked into the consulting detective’s blue pupils, there was depth and emotion in Sherlock’s pupils, not outright blubbering and loud declarations of regret, but the quiet speculation in which something mysterious and murky gave light to something deeper within, something rarely shown unless John learned to look beyond and truly see into Sherlock’s heart.
Sherlock frantically scanned John’s labored breathing in shuddering gasps, unwilling to crawl despite no apparent blood or injuries on his body, his forehead starting to bead with sweat, and the fact that John’s left hand was tremoring madly, fingers unconsciously twitching against the concrete as he hacked with gritted teeth…
Everyone, even Sherlock, went temporarily mute as the scream from John’s mouth, the words coarse and rough with grief and anger.  Not even Baymax felt it was logical to inform John of his rising body temperature and elevated blood pressure and cortisol levels.  John refused to let the pricking in his tightly shut eyes swim with tears as he then forced each word to methodically form through clenched teeth.
Steve couldn’t finish the sentence as he shuddered in delight of the memories of Sherlock brushing his lips and tongue against each and every part of his body, murmuring huskily the anatomical body part in between licks.  Steve was already feeling hard again.
“From all of us in 221B and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe who could make this special occasion…” John continued before all four of them and Rosie flourished their cake and smiles.
“Let me simplify my words down to a level even a moron such as yourself is capable of comprehending: I want to sit in MY chair.  You are in
“Kelley, excuse me for a minute…” Steve said apologetically before he looked over and gave a stern look at both Sherlock and Bucky in the background.
Unfortunately, he also showed his teeth.  With a few of them missing, black gaps amid a sea of red and white.
“…I think perhaps at this point, we should rather be more concerned if we should leave his remains in a
Bucky was a bit alarmed while Sherlock made a scandalized sputtering noise in the background.  Unsure what to do, Bucky just stood as still John continued to embrace him, with Bucky’s arms hanging gawkily in midair as if unsure he should return the gesture or if Steven was going to be offended and annoyed of the close contact.
No one spoke, although Anderson’s eyes were sparkling with delight as he thought of how much of a tizzy this was going to bring towards the Empty Hearse Club’s next meeting.
And all over the world, on various television networks as they showed the coverage of the massacre on every news broadcast from BBC to CNN to ANN7 to NHK World…
Sherlock put the newspaper down on the table. "You want me to tell you exactly what he said? Use the actual words he used?”
"Yeah, why?" John called back up, wiping his feet. "Expecting someone else who has a key?" He trudged up the stairs. He was tired and had had a long day. As soon as he reached the flat doorway though and looked through it, to see Sherlock slumped in his armchair looking a little pitiful with several drying blood stains on his shirt and a darkening bruise on his left cheekbone, all his fatigue vanished.
John looked at Sherlock, who had closed his eyes again soon after speaking, and now sat leant back against the seat, still tightly wrapped in his coat and with his scarf and gloves in a loose heap on his lap. John just looked at him, thinking all sorts of things. Maybe he did know after all, what it was Sherlock was referring to. He and Sherlock had known each other a while now and he was just starting to make some deductions of his own.
By the time they got back, Sherlock was really grumbling. "It really hurts now," he said, reaching round once again to rub the base of his neck under his coat collar. John put his key in the door and pushed the door open and stood to the side to allow Sherlock to go in first.
"Shut up, for one thing," snarled John, and grabbed one of the chairs angrily from the table at his side. He set it behind Sherlock but turned it sideways, so that when Sherlock sat down, the back of the chair would be positioned at his right side and therefore Sherlock's entire back would be exposed for John to reach.
John glanced over at him again as he straightened up. It was quite brisk outside and Sherlock’s cheeks were slightly pink with the cold. John really tried not to look too much, but sometimes he couldn’t help himself. Sometimes it was hard not to.
The truth was out at last. John had never experienced all these emotions at once. It was like being caught in an avalanche.
There was a gust of laughter from the kitchen and then Lucia and Siger both came through to the sitting room and enjoyed some canapés themselves and some drinks and chit chat with their guests before both - as if it had already been agreed - disappearing back into the kitchen to finalise the meal.
...” he said haltingly. “You always look so...laid back but I think you can really move when you want to.” He paused and swallowed, Greg’s hand stroking encouragingly up and then down his spine. Greg smiled against Mycroft’s neck. “Yeah?” he whispered.
“Come on, then,” said John, wondering what that was all about but knowing better than to ask. Sherlock would tell him when he wanted to.
Sally Donovan chose that moment to knock on his open door, making him jump. “Hey,” she said, matter of factly, “We need to—” then she noticed and pointed at the paper in his hand accusingly, “— what’s that?”
Sherlock turned to look at him fully and started to unwind his scarf. “Not really, if you shorten them to Gab and Gabe,” he replied. “Then they sound quite different.” He dropped his scarf on his lap and took his gloves off too.
have walked…but carrying all this stuff? The car park for the quay had been fairly busy, John remembered, but the empty cars they had passed hadn't seemed your typical artists' cars; if indeed there was such a thing. John remembered a particularly nice beaten-up old Jag. Surely not? She didn't seem the Jag type somehow. Sherlock would remember the cars, he'd have to ask in a minute. John was still looking around at the view and the shed when he spotted the handlebars of what looked like a pretty ancient blue bicycle propped against (and mostly behind) a large sturdy gorse bush nearby. She had tucked the bike away so as not to distract her view from the scene she was painting.
Sherlock, as much as he hated human contact and gross displays of sentiment, couldn’t help but feel a little left out.
In unison, despite their injuries, Bucky and Sherlock dashed off the floor to check their mobiles lying on the floor, argument and brawl immediately cast aside and forgotten.
“James…” Coulson asked slowly with the tone of voice that wanted an explanation, “Is there a reason you’re calling from
have my vengeance…” rasped Sherlock, head painfully pinned against the wood floor via Bucky’s metal arm as Bucky ground his buttocks on his spine.
“I’m surprised a woman of her age can gracefully perform such a tackle,” blinked Molly Hooper at Mrs. Holmes.
Sometimes, Sherlock regretted giving Steven and John the idea to renovate and move into the 221C basement flat down below just to see the look of horrified shock on Bucky’s face when Steven told him the news…
so much. After he has come back to find John about to get engaged, living somewhere down in the suburbs, he has stared at his chair very often. When John would sit here with him, sit in the chair by the fire, he could forget about it. That he has lost him. That he is coming over for the cases, or for Mary and Sherlock to plan the wedding, and nothing else.
"Lestrade, I want the whole building under surveillance. Get as many men and women in and around there as you can."
The voice out of the dark made John's whole body jump. The torch fell out of his hand and to the floor with one loud noise; the sound of wood hitting stone.
. At this point, it is no concern of mine who it is that floats behind that glass tank. That isn't the person I put my trust in. It isn't the person I fought for, the person I fell-" his mouth swallowed the last bit before his head could stop it from being uttered. "The person I'd die for."
Clinging to his slim waist was a dress shirt with a sharp collar, a white waistcoat with soft, barely visible flower patterns, contrasting with the black tail-coat and black trousers. A combination that should not have worked, but worked so beautifully for him.
"I'm so glad to see you," Molly mumbled into his shoulder and he thought he had seen a twitch of a smile around Sherlock's mouth.
John shook his head in a desperate laugh. "Now listen to you. The Sherlock Holmes that I know would never even consider agreeing with Anderson."
John gives him a warm smile and kisses the skin somewhere above his heart. "I didn't exactly want to overstimulate you by coming inside you, honey."
Lestrade gave an unhappy but defeated sigh, probably realising that, perhaps, for now, he had to swallow his own pride, along with his own emotional priorities, unanswered questions and the strange bitterness of it all. So they soon all found themselves walking down an empty hallway, he and Donovan taking the lead, Sherlock and John following a few steps behind.
"He looks much softer now than he always pretends to be, does he not?" she asked quietly, afraid of him not letting her. "Stripped of everything, what remains for all of us is only the core beneath the disguise. That's why it is frightening to be ourselves."
Just before he opens to door to disappear behind it, he turns around once more, a slightly wicked grin around his lips. "You could have a nice little shower 'til I'm back, don't you think, love?"
Thanks for reading and commenting and (hopefully) enjoying this story with me up to here. It means a lot!
It smelled like fresh rain and smoke, lit fireplaces and sweetened black tea. Intimate like a warm-lain pillow, exciting like the leather of a riding crop, and a bit of citrus. It smelled as much like the time he and Sherlock had spent in front of the chimney, engrossed in conversation and the words of each other, as it smelled like the cold air in John's face and their joined hands when they had run through the streets of London. He wondered if that was how Sherlock had smelled like when he had still been human, and the thought alone sent goosebumps to his skin.
"I know. I believe he spares it. And I believe I know why. John? I will tell you what happened to me."
"There is nothing else happening." The words slipped out of him before he could even think twice. He did not want to make it sound like he was only talking to her because he had nothing better to do. But her gaze drifted off into the distance as though she was thinking of the mysterious detective and continued her talk.
Pure electricity sparks up the length of his body, creeps underneath his skin and stops to leave a hunger that takes place right below his stomach, shoots upwards to meet the heart. John kisses him again, almost without touching him at all, and the soft sensation kills him. He spreads his legs even wider and his robe cannot hide anything anymore, especially not after the belt falls open.
"Really?" John asked dryly. "That is odd. I have heard absolutely nothing about you. In fact, I don't even know your name."
Sherlock let out a sigh filled with regret that he clearly didn't want to give voice to, so his body did it for him. "Matters of frustration. Sometimes I feel the strong need to let off some steam."
Irene straightened her back and stared right above everyone's heads into some invisible void. "I know him well. You must know that it was him who came to me, never the other way around. When I had my small business, I was the consultant and he was the client."
..." Charles Augustus Magnussen once again managed to make him want to punch his lights out. "I see. It seems you have won this round, Dr Watson."
"You are being expected, Captain," they told him as John and Sherlock were led through the gate and across the yard.
"And if you are not doing it for me," Sherlock said, "do you at least want to feel it again? The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins like it used to?"
Suddenly, Rosie starts to wiggle in Sherlock’s arms. She stretches both her arms out as far as she can, reaching for John in desperate attempts. "No!"
He is startled by the sensation of cum hitting the back of his throat and pulls back instinctively, the other half of it squirting across his cheek. He runs his finger through it, then realises John is watching him, sweat glistening on his forehead and neck, drying around blond chest hair, and all he can think is, "This man had me and I had him," and look at him in wonder. He doesn't avert his gaze as he takes his finger into his mouth to lick John's cum off it.
"Uhm..." John forgot what he had wanted to say, a bit taken aback by the place Sherlock would probably call a home. He owned so much. And what did John have that he could really call his and mean it?
