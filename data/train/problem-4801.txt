Dean turns, apparently satisfied, and hands Cas a couple of huge towels. “Here, you’re going to need these. Get in the shower and get warm. I really don’t need you getting a cold.”
"Do you have the ingredients to repair it?" Cas asks sharply, holding the lighter out for him to take back.
"No. It feels dead."
“We’re not “heroes” any more,” Dean says, making air quotes.
Cas blinks in surprise, how does he know his name? He nods and turns his frown into a tight smile, "Dean," he says, hoping fervently that he won't be asked to explain how he knows Dean's.
How do people live like this? Or do they? He’s still not sure he believes Garth’s theory on the loss of their ‘Hero Mojo’ or whatever. He’s no fucking hero, he’s a grunt. Just a guy doing a messy job for no reward because it’s all he knows how to do. He’s hardly Captain fucking America, he’s just good at breaking heads.
Cas looks wary, his eyes squint slightly. He doesn’t speak so Dean closes his eyes and ploughs on, focusing on a spot somewhere inside his own head. “Every time. Every time I think maybe....maybe I--you...Then I find myself back here, back at the fucking start putting on the same show, playing the same fucking part I’ve been playing my whole fucking life. Because...” Dean tails off, heart thumping, words drying up.
Sam hovers awkwardly behind his brother, watching over his shoulder with a frown. He looks utterly worn down and wrung out but there is an almost tangible empathy in his expression as he smiles at Cas.
"Yeah I tried that," Dean says, not unkindly.
"Do your parents live in Boston as well?"
Dean almost follows, then stops. “He’s right,” he says. “It’s a show man, it’s all just a fucking show.”
The voice from behind him makes him turn in surprise. A man in his thirties stands staring up at the screen, his face a picture of rage. Oh shit. Not him! What the hell is he doing here? His incredibly annoying upstairs neighbour Dean. The man moved in a month ago and Cas has already grown to loathe him. He plays awful music at ridiculous volume at all times of the day and night. He doesn't seem to sleep at all. He has people over every fucking night and has extremely noisy sex to the point where Cas occasionally worries that the bed will come through his ceiling. He had debated saying something on the rare occasions that they cross paths in the hall, but it's hard to look someone in the eye when you've heard their name being screamed, accompanied by 'oh fuck yes, harder'. This is the only reason that he even knows the guy's name at all.
‘I have such strong deja-vu,’ Cas laughs. ‘It’s so odd. When we shook hands—‘
Cas sits down. "Yes please."
‘Yeah well, anyone who shares a room with you can experience weird noises and phantom smells…’
"Not really no, a couple of short stories, nothing I can make a living out of."
Dean opens the passenger door and Cas climbs in, shivering in the chill interior as he looks around. The inside of the car is pristine, not a single piece of trash or scuffed upholstery. It's as if it just rolled off the production line despite its age. Dean gets in and blows on his hands to warm them. He smiles at Cas, turns on the engine and they drive carefully out of the lot.
"I love you."
“More or less. It is for me anyway.”
Dean clears his throat, smacks his palm against Cas’s shoulder heavily and turns away to unlock the bunker. “Come on buddy, let’s get you home,” he says, his voice full of cracked, false levity.
‘According to who?’ he asks over his shoulder. ‘Idiots on the internet?’ A passing police car wails, its lights casting flashing blue shadows across his face and the surrounding snow.
At first he had panicked; he understands illness in an abstract sense, he knows it is something that humans have to deal with but, like most aspects of humanity, it isn't something he has ever thought of in relation to himself. So when he had first felt the aches and pains creeping over him and the pain when he swallowed, he had ignored it. He is becoming used to weird and unexpected sensations, now this body is his alone he notices them a lot more but he still has no idea what is normal.
Dean, his own clothes no drier, looks at him and sighs. “Shoes off Cas,” he says firmly, looking down at the muddy footprints on the parquet floor.
Cas gives a small, rueful smile. “Yes, it was hard; there is a surprising amount to get used to about being human. There are so many needs and wants. This body is constantly making demands that I don’t understand. My mind is utter chaos and I have no idea how to make it stop.”
Sometime later they both lie full length on the couch, sweat cooling on bare skin, panting as they catch their breath. Cas buries his face in Dean's shoulder as he traces his fingers idly over his chest.
“Come here, show me,” Cas says, ignoring his words and moving closer. He reaches for Dean’s hand carefully. Dean looks down at where their hands meet as Cas turns it over in his own.
Dean opens the door to his apartment and flicks on the light. He props the cases up inside the door and gestures to the large comfortable looking couch. "Make yourself at home Cas," he says, heading for the kitchen, "You want a drink?"
Sam snaps, advancing on him angrily. He shoves him against the grimy white tiles, a hand on his chest. “Do
"That's one word for it. I'm supposed to be spending Christmas in Boston with my brother."
Dean frowns and turns back to the machine. “No glove, no love Sammy,” he says with a grin.
“Good?”
Dean lies still, listening intently to the darkness, unsure what woke him. Sam is fast asleep and snoring, his laptop open on his chest, the glow from the screen casting his face in eerie light. Dean strains to pick out any unusual sounds, but the room is quiet, apart from the ticking of the clock on the wall above the TV and his brother’s snoring, which sounds like someone gargling with gravel, as usual. He is about to turn over and try and get back to sleep when his vision flickers for a moment and suddenly a dark haired man is standing at the foot of his bed.
He smiles sadly and nods again. "Yes, me too."
Cas laughs and takes a sip of his whiskey, the warm rush of alcohol burns down his throat, the smell of smoke and the medicinal tang of peat fill his senses. Dean has good taste in whiskey.
Cas raises his eyebrows as he takes a seat next to Dean. “De-mojoed?”
“There’s nothing to apologise for.”
Dean turns to look at him. “Angel radio?” he asks.
Dean glances at the key in his hand, room 669. He starts off down one of the corridors, his brother following. There is no sound other than their footsteps, muffled by the old carpet, and the trundling wheels of Sam’s case as he drags it behind him. Christ knows why he needed a suitcase, they’re only staying one night. The room numbering seems to be somewhat random, as is often the case in old hotels, but he finds his way easily enough. There is something familiar about this place, but back in the days when he accompanied his brother on these trips more often they stayed in so many crumbling fleapit hotels that they all started to blur together. He shrugs, unlocks the door and flicks on the light.
“Is it always like that?”
Dean is sitting on one of the old couches in the room which was the library but has become, for all intents and purposes, the living room. The Zippo stands on the end table by his side, the flame guttering in some unnoticed breeze, causing huge shadows to crawl over the walls. His gaze is fixed on its small halo of warmth and light.
Cas frowns, considering the experience before nodding. “Yes, I think so.”
Sam laughs. "Really? Fuck, don't take our lead; we're pretty messed up Cas. Cautionary tale maybe but not much of a role model."
Dean sighs. ‘I still can’t believe you make a living blogging about haunted houses.’
“Yeah that sounds like a human brain alright,” Dean says with a wry smile.
“I want to stop the show Cas. I want to stop playing this part. I’m so tired of it, so fucking sick and tired.”
“But that’s the hard part isn’t it?”
"Cool! That sounds great, I love that stuff. Have you had anything published?"
Cas rolls his eyes, he's heard that before but he doesn't understand what it is supposed to mean. He says as much and Dean looks uncomfortable, glancing down at his feet and up again.
Cas looks confused for a moment but Sam doesn't elaborate and Dean chooses that moment to come back into the room, baring plates and bottles and aiming a glare at his brother who raises an eyebrow in a look that says, are you arguing?
Dean says nothing but envelops Cas in a hug, wrapping strong arms tightly around him. The sudden comfort of Dean’s embrace takes him aback, all the fight and fear suddenly drains out of him. He presses his face into Dean’s shoulder, breathes in the warm, human scent of him. He knows he is shaking, he can feel Dean’s heart thumping as he tightens his arms around him, his unsteady breath against his neck, the barest brush of lips against his skin. Cas realizes he is not breathing. His face is still wet. Tears are dripping onto Dean’s shoulder. Cas doesn’t know how to make them stop, just as he has no idea how they started.
‘Fuck you Dean. Anyway, as I was saying, the other rooms have a ton of vague stuff but this room seems to be the mother-load, supernaturally speaking. It’s the only one with reports of an actual, full-body, roaming apparition.’
Dean grins. "Damn right!"
Cas nods. “It’s ok Dean. I know you don’t…” he falters for a second and then smiles. “Come on, come back in. She’s waiting for you.”
‘Like you said; better than sitting at home alone.’
Cas groaned. “Am I dying? I think I feel like I’m dying.”
‘Oh yeah,’ he clears his throat. ‘Uh, so why don’t you show me what the problem is? Um…?’
‘I don’t think so? But…’ Dean begins.
Cas shrugs. "I guess you'll have to try and find the source of the power."
Cas nods, he had pretty much assumed the same thing. "Perhaps there is some spell or ritual that needs to be renewed?" he wonders aloud.
Cas takes the lighter from Dean and kneels down to examine the markings. He runs a finger lightly over one line and raises it, squinting, sniffing experimentally.
"Oww shit!" he exclaims loudly, mostly to hide his embarrassment.
Cas smiles and reaches out a hand to the side of Dean’s face, sliding his thumb carefully over his cheekbone. Dean’s breath freezes in his chest but he wills himself not to move away, instead raising his eyes to meet Cas’.
“Don’t be obtuse. You know what I mean. This...this…
It’s in the car on the way back from Garth’s that Dean feels the first flicker of something different. He gets a text from Cas to say he’s at the bunker and the thought of getting home and finding Cas waiting for them-- for him, feels...good. Warm? It’s an unusual feeling, somehow both familiar and unfamiliar and faintly worrying, as if there was something forbidden about it.
Cas looks over at the tray on the nightstand, it does smell good, as much as he can smell anything through his bunged-up nose. “What is it?”
Cas nods and pulls his trench-coat off, dropping it with a wet splat on the tiled floor. He starts to undo the buttons of his shirt, peeling it back from his shoulders. Goosebumps appear on his wet skin.
As the doors begin to close Dean suddenly darts out a hand and stops them. "Wait! Um...would you...you wanna come up for a drink?" he asks, sounding oddly unsure.
Cas frowns. “In what way?”
When they've both retrieved at least some of their clothes they lie in each other's arms under a blanket Dean dragged from the back of the couch. Dean looks at his watch in surprise. “Merry Christmas Cas,” he says, kissing the top of his head.
The Lincoln Continental sits forlornly in the parking lot, it has definitely seen better days. Dean pops the hood and they both lean over the engine; Castiel explaining the problem as Dean pokes around and points out what needs to be done. He’s fairly certain Cas doesn’t have clue what he is talking about, but is gamely trying to look like he understands. A couple of times Dean raises his eyes from the engine to see Cas looking at him with a soft smile and his head cocked to one side. He looks down again quickly but he can’t stop the smile that pulls at his own lips.
"Were you expecting fire and brimstone?"
“What are you doing?” a deep voice behind him says.
"Are you sure you're ok to drive in this?" Cas asks, his long coat flapping around him in the wind.
Dean shakes his head dismissively. ‘Nothing. Someone walking over my grave.’
‘Hi,’ Dean says, wiping his hands on the rag that hangs from his pocket. ‘I’m—’
When he hangs up the phone he leans back on the couch, putting his feet up on the coffee table again and sighs deeply. “Fuck man, this is exactly what I needed you know? Just to chill out and get a bit of peace. I'm actually kind of glad our flight got cancelled.” He looks over at Cas who smiles,
Dean lets out a breath. “Don’t worry about me Cas,” he says, “If I’m gonna get sick it’s too late now. Anyway, if I do it’ll be your chance to look after me.” He lifts the tray off the table and puts it down on Cas’s lap. “Here, eat ok? You’ll be better soon.”
Sam blinks in the darkness and stares at him. ‘What the hell?’ he says squinting, face creased from sleep.
"So what do you do?" he asks to cover up his confusion.
Dean shoots his brother a look and then shrugs awkwardly. “Yeah, well…” he turns away, “You hungry?” he asks.
Dean grins. "Well yeah, it's tough sometimes, this place is a fucking madhouse. Hope it's not too noisy downstairs? I was meaning to ask you." He takes another sip and Cas gives a dismissive 'it's fine' gesture, while yelling at himself internally.
“Hmm,” Sam replies with an absent nod.
That was three days ago and Cas hasn’t left his bed since. He’s pretty much used to the sneezing, coughing, running nose and streaming eyes by now; it’s the aches and pains that really get him down. Every movement makes him groan, his joints have all become rusty hinges. He has slept a lot over the last couple of days but he’s still tired, hot, cold and uncomfortable.
Dean looks relieved when he sees him, puts a hand on his shoulder and smiles. They haven't seen much of each other for a few days. Sam is away, "helping" Eileen, the hunter they met on the Banshee case. The air quotes are entirely Dean's. He had ragged on his brother for a week when he said he was going to meet her but Cas thinks he's secretly pleased.
‘Cas--’ the name comes to him as if he has always know it, he
“Sam had no right to say those things,” Cas says. “It’s none of his business.”
“You looked cold, sorry I hope it's not weird…” Dean says, moving his arm, suddenly looking self conscious.
Looking up into Dean's wide green eyes Cas swallows and thinks, what the hell. You only live once. He reaches a hand up slowly, giving Dean time to move away, but he doesn't, even when he places his hand gently on the side of his neck and pulls him slowly down to press his lips softly against him. Dean gives a small surprised huff of breath and then he is kissing back. His lips are soft and warm and he tastes of whiskey and coconut chilli and Cas buries his hands in his hair and licks into his mouth as Dean moans and grabs hold of his waist, dragging him into his lap, running his hands up and down his back as he kisses him deeper, turning from careful and questioning to hot and wet and passionate. Cas groans as he feels the hardness under Dean's jeans where he pushes against him.
Sam sleeps on, apparently peacefully. Dean knows he should wake him but he cannot look away. The dark haired man looks scared now, holding his hands up higher, fingers spread in front of him as if he is reasoning with someone, but there is no one else visible in the room. He walks forward slowly, one hand out, then his bright blue eyes widen and he stops, stumbling and falling back onto the floor. Grasping his shoulder, he scrambles clumsily backward toward the bathroom, shiny shoes slipping on the carpet.
This time, when Cas’s fingers brush against his skin, Dean feels it. The barest touch, the ghost of warmth. A deep, abiding comfort wraps around him, sinking into his bones. The weight of a hundred years of loneliness leaves him in a ragged rush of breath as Cas’s thumb slips over his cheek, pushing away tears. Dean moves his hands closer, hovering uncertainly before he grabs Cas and drags him into another kiss. This one is warm and soft and slow. It seems to fill up his whole soul. He closes his eyes and focuses on the familiar touch that he has never felt before. He can taste him, smell him, hear him breathing; his heart beating. A flare of brilliant light makes him open his eyes with a start to see luminous blue and white sparks like fireflies pouring from Cas. His edges are blurring, the sparks are filling the room and somehow Dean knows he is going. He can feel him fading but he also feels the overwhelming sense of relief and joy that radiates from him. The desire to hold on is almost unbearable but he makes himself smile, fighting the rising panic in his chest.
The taste of chilled metal and desperate longing consumes him. There is no physical press of skin against his, only a thrill that prickles across his lips and rushes down his spine. His fingers and toes tingle as if he’s coming in to the warm after walking hours in the snow. His mind has stalled, he doesn’t want to move; he doesn’t want anything but this. He closes his eyes and feels the gentle sensation of pins and needles roll over his skin. He knows this feeling, half way between a memory and a story overheard.
They look at each other for a moment and then Cas smiles. “That sounds great,” he says, “But I don’t want to out stay my welcome – if you have stuff to do?”
when you smile at him? The murderous look you gave that bartender when she smiled at him? I don’t know - name a fucking rom-com cliche.”
Dean takes a deep breath and pulls away slightly. His eyes are glassy as he raises his hands to Cas’s face and cups his jaw, searching his face. His hands are rough but warm and gentle as they smooth over the longer scruff on Cas’s cheeks; evidence of the passing of time that will affect them both now. It’s only when Dean pulls away and the chill air floods back in that he realizes that he never returned the hug; his arms are still lax by his sides. They watch each other, spell-bound in silence for a second until there is an awkward shuffle from behind them. Eyes widen and they blink, breathe, step back to reality.
“I’m not chewing them Dean, they’re dissolving!” Cas insists, annoyed. He screws up his face at the vile bitterness on his tongue then sips the water again and swallows hard, wincing at the pain in his throat, then gulps down the rest of the water to clear the taste.
“Nah, I’d just be eating take-out and watchin’ movies anyway. This way I get to do it with a cute guy.” Dean laughs and walks back out to the kitchen leaving Cas staring after him with a ticker-tape of questions running through his head.
"Why?"
‘You too Dean.’
******
Cas stops, fingers on his pants button, shirt open. “Sorry,” he says, frowning at the back of Dean’s head.
Dean looks angry. "No! I mean...yes...you are useful but that's not why we...I...want you here. You're our friend Cas. My friend. I...like having you around."
with you and you’re in love with me.”
Cas walks over to the couch, bathed in faint, yellowish light. He sits down next to Dean and looks at his face, half in darkness, half out. His expression is unreadable.
‘Have we met?’ Cas asks.
‘It’s called Paranormal Research Dean,’ Sam says. Dean can hear the capital letters. ‘And it’s not just a blog. There’s the podcast and the books and…’
"Shit."
Cas gets up and walks towards Dean with a look of purpose that he hasn’t seen in years. He reaches out, gripping the sides of Dean’s face with both hands. Dean closes his eyes, feeling the buzz of grace spilling from Cas’ fingertips, spreading electricity through his body. When he kisses him it’s hard, fierce and demanding, almost angry. Dean understands, he feels the fury too even as he kisses back. He’s been lied to, for his whole life, about his whole life, all for the sake of Chuck’s narrative. But as he lets himself sink against Cas’ lips, lets himself feel the fire of his hands on his skin, it’s as if every distorted version of himself, every false narrative, slides right back together and he knows
‘Cas!’
Cas’s eyes widen suddenly, he opens his mouth to speak and Dean jumps to his feet. “I gotta...” he turns on his heel and heads to his room as fast as he can without actually running away.
Dean pushes something towards him, he looks up to see a bottle at his arm. "Drink." Dean says, smiling crookedly at his stunned expression.
The journey home is fairly slow, Dean does not drive the way Cas had expected him to. He is conscientious and attentive and says little, too busy watching the snow blown road. He switches on the heater, turning the vent toward Cas and shoves a tape into the player. As the sounds of loud rock music fill the car he gives Cas an apologetic smile. "Sorry dude, it helps me concentrate."
Cas looks around the room. "Where did you turn on the power when you first came here? Or was it already on?"
He has found a handful of candles in holders in one of the old supply closets. After a moment he moves into the room and begins to arrange them on the tables and least flammable-looking shelves. He picks up the lighter from the end table, leaving Dean in darkness and begins methodically to light them.
"Oh dear." Cas doesn't know what else to say.
“How do you do anything?”
Dean hefts the worn duffle at his feet over his shoulder and smiles. "C'mon then," he says and walks off in the direction of baggage claim. Cas frowns and, after a moments debate, sighs and follows after him.
what! How many years has it been you asshole? He looks at you, you look at him. He saves you, you save him. You leave him, he leaves you! Then every now and again you finally get to a place where you seem...I don’t know, comfortable? Like you might even...But it always,
Cas is in the middle of a two day continuous Netflix binge when the power goes out. The TV goes dead, the lights go out and he's left sitting on his small bed in the sudden, silent darkness. The silence only lasts for a few seconds however; Dean's voice echoes down the corridor almost immediately, a familiar edge of worry, getting closer fast.
“I just want to chill out a bit, find someone who likes the things I like, someone who makes me laugh I guess?” He rolls his eyes at himself. “God that sounds like some chick-flick crap huh?”
“I--” Dean begins and then stops.
Cas shrugs, out of ideas.
“Everything. I’m afraid it’s too late, that I’ve wasted my fucking life on this bullshit so why give up now. I’m afraid I won’t be me anymore - whatever that even means - and I’m afraid of what other people will think, that they’ll treat me differently. I’m afraid of what my dad would have thought, what Mom would have thought, what Sam thinks. I’m afraid of you…”
Castiel turns on the spot, looking hopeful.
The first time he sneezed Dean had taken one look at his expression of stunned fear and burst out laughing; only stopping when he realized that Cas seemed to be in the throes of a sneezing fit that looked like it might never end. Cas had sneezed until his eyes were streaming and he could hardly breathe, his nose was bunged up and his head hurt.
The restroom door slams. Dean looks over from his attempts to feed coins into the ancient condom machine to see his brother glaring at him with his arms folded.
"You'll get there man, I worked a crap ton of terrible fucking jobs before I finally opened my place. Not that being an accountant is terrible!" he adds hastily.
"I want to be a writer."
He stands at the sink and runs a hand over the condensation streaked mirror until he can see his face. He looks tired. He touches his face, moving the skin curiously with the tips of his fingers; it feels very strange to think of this face as his, or this body. Once, his vessel was like a tiny cage trying to contain a universe, now he doesn’t even feel like he fills it to its edges.
"Which one were you going to see?" Dean asks.
Baggage claim seems to take hours. They stand side by side watching a seemingly endless parade of suitcases go around the carousel and making awkward small talk as they wait. Dean's bag arrives first but he stays and waits for Cas's to arrive.
They fall silent again.
Cas wakes with a start. The walls are pressing in. His head is wrapped in something, something that fills his ears and nose and mouth and covers his eyes. He tries to reach out, his mind flails for the comfort of the others but there is nothing there but darkness. He sits bolt upright and suddenly the room lights up. Bursts of color explode in front of his eyes, he screws them shut with a gasp, throwing up a hand to shield himself from the brightness.
“What's wrong? You were yelling.”
Dean is up and out of bed before he knows what is happening. He runs to the bathroom door and stares down at the man who now sits awkwardly with his back against the wall with blood running from his sleeve, leaving sticky, red handprints on the cracked linoleum floor. His eyes are filled with a mixture of fear and anger as he looks up, staring through Dean at his invisible assailant. The sight fills Dean with a mixture of horror and rage that, if he paused to consider it, he would be unable to rationally explain. But he doesn’t pause. He wheels around, trying to see what the man sees and freezes as he finds himself face to face with another man. This man wears similarly old-fashioned clothes but, where the dark haired man is tall and well dressed, this man is short and dishevelled, unshaven and wild-eyed. He also holds a gun, a small silver revolver which gleams in his shaking hand.
Dean comes back down the steps. "Yeah, oh dear," he agrees dryly.
"Nope, just the two of us."
"I love you too Cas." There is a small pause then Dean lets out a huff of stifled laughter. "Well that was easier than I thought. Feels kinda anti-climatic."
Dean moves away from the window, drawing the curtains against the raging snow storm. “Sorry, it’s pretty late,” he begins and Cas agrees, murmuring something about how he should be getting home at the same time Dean says, “You wanna get something to eat? Watch a movie?”
For Dean the next few days pass in a daze. He spends New Years’ Day with Sam and they eat too much and watch awful TV. He laughs and jokes but feels weirdly empty for reasons he can't name. Sometimes he feels an overwhelming sadness sweep over him and he wants to cry but he puts it down to residual grief over the end of his relationship, despite the fact that he hardly thinks about his absent partner anymore. He thinks he dreams about someone a lot but the face is always gone when he opens his eyes. After the holidays he goes back to work at his uncle Bobby’s garage, muddling through without really feeling present for a moment. His thoughts keep skipping back to the bathroom of the old hotel for some reason.
He blinks in shock, his eyes dart nervously to Sam but he is apparently oblivious, eyes glued to his phone as he sniffs occasionally. Dean’s neck feels hot. He wonders if he is getting sick as well. He puts an inquisitive hand to his forehead, testing for a temperature. It seems normal but he still feels off in a way he can’t put his finger on. He clears his throat, tries to think of something to say but can’t.
“Yes please.”
He lifts the sandwich to his mouth, examining it curiously. It smells...odd, difficult to describe, not exactly appetizing but not entirely unpleasant. He glances up to see Dean's eyes fixed on him. He smiles and looks down again at the sandwich and takes a large bite. His eyes widen as the taste floods his mouth; suddenly the center of his mind's focus. The food is thick and rich, soft, oily, sweet, salty. The peanut butter is cloying and sticks the strangely tasteless mass of the bread to the roof of his mouth. The sensation is unnerving. He finds it hard to swallow. The jelly is sweet, sticky and sharp, it makes his mouth water. The experience is bizarre and slightly terrifying, he feels a rising panic at the idea that every time he eats he will be assaulted by this level of sensory overload.
‘Oh god shut up!’
Cas wakes up with a start. He blinks rapidly, trying to figure out where he is. The TV is still on, credits are rolling and he remembers he is in Dean's apartment at the same moment he realises he has slumped to his side and is lying against Dean's side, his head on his shoulder. Dean turns to look down at him. “Hey, you're back,” he says with a fond smile, “you were dead to the world.”
Cas frowns. “Yes?”
Dean sits down at the opposite end of the couch and puts his feet up on the coffee table. "I'm a mechanic," he says, "I run a place downtown with an old friend of my dad’s. It's not a huge place but we do ok, we specialise in classic cars, restoration work."
‘No Sammy I was taking a piss. Is that ok with you?’ Dean snaps. Sam arches an eyebrow but says nothing. Dean leans back against the headboard again. It’s nothing, he tells himself, just a combination of over-active imagination, half a bottle of whiskey and… And nothing. He’s just tired and drunk.
Once the food has arrived, the movie is well underway and he's on his third drink, Cas is feeling warm and comfortable and finding it increasingly hard to focus on his food and the movie. He watches Dean out of the corner of his eye. He is shovelling noodles into his mouth and seems to be glued to the film, laughing at the jokes with his mouth full. Cas catches himself thinking he's adorable and almost laughs aloud. If he'd seen him just hours ago he would have thought him messy and uncouth. He picks at his food, finding his appetite has mostly deserted him. He turns back to the movie with a small sigh, its just his luck that the first man he's been attracted to in ages has just about sworn off sex.
“No…it's fine. It's…nice.”
This is real.
“It’s ok, just a scratch. Leave it.”
Dean turns. "Fuck! Cas, you ok?" He crouches down next to him, his hand on Cas's shoulder. There's no sign of the mockery or laughter Cas had expected, instead he looks genuinely worried. He looks at him with concern, a frown creasing his forehead. His eyes seem very bright green in the reflected light and snowflakes catch on his long eyelashes. Cas swallows and forces a smile, ignoring the pain as he takes Dean's proffered hand and pulls himself up. Well shit. Dean is actually kind of hot. Why hadn't he noticed that before? Too busy being annoyed at him he supposes.
“Watch it jerk,” Sam mumbles through stuffy sinuses. “I’m going to bed. I offically fucking hate colds.”
As Dean opens his mouth to explain the events of the day he finds himself wondering why he has never noticed Cas’s eyes before. Were they always this stunning? How would he have missed that? Cas is so beautiful. When he looks at him he feels utter peace, like nothing he has ever experienced. His hand twitches, he wants to reach out for him.
“S’ok, just…I’ll see you in a minute ok?” Dean turns back briefly, his cheeks are flushed pink, pupils dilated. He blinks, nods once and backs out of the door awkwardly.
"Thanks."
"Maybe. Maybe a small earthquake."
“Like I said, you did good though.” Sam slaps him on the back and steps away, dropping back into the chair. “Dean was about to come find you. If I hadn’t been messed up from the trials we would have been straight there. I’m sorry Cas.”
"What's wrong Cas?" he asks.
A week later they’re all standing in the lobby of the bunker, dripping rain water on the floor. They have all just got in after being caught in a downpour. Cas’s hair is soaking, plastered to his skull. Rivulets of water run down his face, into his eyes and off his nose. He blinks and tries to push it away, smearing the rain over his cheeks, re-distributing the moisture to his hands. He shakes his head gently, which just succeeds in making more water run down the back of his neck, down the collar of his white button-up. He shivers as the drops slide down his spine.
"Fuck knows, I was in the kitchen getting a beer and it all just went phutt--" Dean mimes a small explosion, "Looks like the whole place has just run out of juice."
‘—Dean,’ the man says, smiling.
Dean Winchester looks around, unimpressed, as his brother checks them in. The man at the front desk looks as old and worn out as the rest of the place. After some wrangling Sam turns and grins, a room key with a heavy brass fob hanging from his fingers. ‘Isn’t this place great?’ he enthuses. Dean raises a skeptical eyebrow and snatches the key before stomping off towards the ancient elevator, hoisting his duffle higher on his shoulder. Sam sighs and follows after him.
Two hours later they have read the entire history of all the reported sightings and phenomena, dissected the sad state of Dean’s love life and the ridiculousness of Sam’s job, finished most of the bottle of whiskey and a truly amazing apple pie which Sam had produced from the depths of his bag.
“C’mon Cas!” Dean’s voice rings out from bathroom, echoing against the tiles.
Cas frowns, he knows objectively that there are things the Winchesters do that make their, and others, lives harder; that they have made bad choices, but he can't imagine why Sam would think they're not the best examples of humanity Cas knows.
‘I have missed this,’ Dean says quietly. ‘It's been cool to hang out with you again. Even if we didn't see any ghosts.’
Cas nods. “I've always been able to hear them, all the time. I have never been alone. I can't explain. It's like being…unplugged. Disconnected. From everything. All I can hear is my own thoughts and they are…confused…untidy.”
"What happened?" Cas asks, scrubbing at his screen-tired eyes.
Dean takes him by the arm and steers him through the bunker, to his room. He opens the door and goes in to the bathroom.
When he’s finished his initial diagnosis they head back inside. Dean presses his lips together nervously as he watches Cas fill out the paperwork. He’s going to leave in a moment. What if he doesn’t see him again for some reason? What if someone else is here when he picks his car up? What if Dean gets hit by a truck tomorrow? He needs to say something now. He has never in his life felt like this about anyone. Like they know each other already, like he knows everything about this man, what he loves, what he hates, who he is inside. He knows all of that. Probably best not to start by telling him that though.
, that it was his only possible path, or that he wouldn’t be himself if he refused to toe the heavenly line. Breaking out of it might not have been a walk in the park but he and Sam had been created, manipulated and bred for those roles, it was in their literal DNA, but they’d still managed to drop them without a backward glance.
“What do you want?”
Cas doesn't smile. Dean looks at the floor.
He disappears off into the kitchen and Cas listens to him clanking glasses and opening cupboards as he looks around the room. It's fairly sparsely decorated, wooden floors covered with a lot of rugs, the couch, a worn looking arm chair, a big TV, a lot of games consoles and a huge shelf, stuffed with books and displays of geeky collectables and merchandise. It's comfortable and welcoming and he feels himself start to defrost a bit. He takes off his coat, folding it over the arm of the couch.
The sweeping staircase has an air of faded grandeur. In fact this whole place reeks of it, of ornate gilded elegance which, on closer inspection, is worn down to the wood. All the surfaces are polished to a dull gleam by the touch of decades and once rich fabrics are now faded and threadbare. Dust motes meander through shafts of light that paint the worn carpets with the colours of the stained glass doors. This place may have been the height of luxury fifty or sixty years ago, but it has long since fallen on hard times.
The man moves to wrap his arms around Dean’s neck but they pass straight through him. This time the sensation is like a full-body static shock, he flinches back sharply and they stare at each other, mouths open, eyes locked. The man looks confused, he reaches out again, brushing his fingers against Dean’s cheek, but again his pale fingertips slip through as if he’s not there and Dean feels nothing but the strange charge that seems to fill his body and mind with white noise. The man looks as if he might cry. ‘Dean,’ he says imploringly. The part of Dean’s mind that has no idea what is happening rebels for a moment, demanding an explanation, before it slips away and what looks out from behind his eyes now is more than just Dean Winchester.
He shoots out from under the car to find a vaguely familiar man in a dark suit and a tan coat looking down at him. He is ridiculously attractive, with dark, messy hair and brilliant blue eyes. Dean tries desperately to remember where he has seen him before and realises he is staring with his mouth open, just at the moment when the man clears his throat and points back towards the doors. ‘Hi…I…um…my car…’ he says, sounding unsure.
“Honey I’m home!” he calls out, then stops abruptly causing Sam to run into him.
"Frankincense," he pronounces, getting to his feet again, "and sandalwood, and blood."
He’s relieved to find Cas still sitting at the map table, staring blankly at the bottle in his hand.
Dean blushes. “S’ok, you can't sleep in that fucking trench coat,” he mutters awkwardly.
They carry on watching, Dean’s occasional funny and sarcastic comments make Cas laugh and he gradually relaxes into the easy companionship they seem to have developed without even trying. Dean's foot occasionally knocks against his on the table and every time Cas feels a rush of heat over his skin. He desperately wants to touch Dean's hand where it lies between them on the couch. He is hyper-aware of every glance Dean shoots his way, every movement he makes. He's fairly sure Dean has moved closer to him during the movie. He thinks Dean is attracted to him but he's still not sure he wants to doing anything about it. Gradually the warmth, whiskey and comfort seeps into him and he feels himself getting drowsy.
.” Dean growls. He shoves his brother out of the way and storms out of the bathroom and out of the bar, ignoring the blonde at the bar who turns to him as he passes.
“I’m sorry.”
“It's too quiet,” Cas says. As if he could explain in words what it feels like.
"Ok, c'mon, I'll give you a ride. Left my baby in the parking lot."
‘Um would you…d’ya wanna go…? I mean, if you…um. If you’re into…um. Oh for fucks’ sake.’ Dean frowns, aware that none of the words he just said made any sense. He shakes his head in disgust, takes a deep breath and starts again. ‘Would you like to go for a drink with me?’
Cas’s eyes close and he nods. When he opens his eyes again he looks almost relieved. ‘It’s ok Dean. I understand. I loved you too.’
Dean struggles to his feet, not taking his eyes off the man. The longer he looks at him the more his heart feels like it's expanding. Like it’s going to explode with a combination of grief and happiness that he can't understand. He knows he must look like a lunatic but he can't stop grinning at the man. The man looks wary but a smile twists the corners of his mouth.
‘Whatever, I make more money than you do jerk.’
Dean nods. “Yeah. He’s at home.” There’s that involuntary smile again.
‘It’s…on your coverall…’ the man says with a confused laugh. Dean’s gaze falls to the embroidered patch on his chest and he blushes.
“Dean? Cas?” Sam’s voice echoes down the dark alley.
"It's a beautiful car," Cas says, and he means it. It might be huge and impractical but the Impala is a gorgeous car, something he didn't appreciate until he saw it up close.
“Cool.”
"You got your car?" he asks, when Cas has finally dragged his old blue case off the carousel.
Cas opens his mouth to say, "Nothing," but instead he says, "Why do you keep me around?"
"Don't leave Cas," Dean's voice emerges from the quiet.
Cas is slumped against the door of the bunker the first time he sees Dean after the Fall. He has waited an age (or so it seems, it’s very difficult to judge the passing of time when it has previously meant nothing to you), for him and Sam to return.
"So what's different?"
He dumps his bag onto the map table and drops into a chair with a grunt and leans back, cursing Chuck and wishing he had the energy to go grab himself a beer.
Dean moves closer. “Nightmare?” He asks, but it's not really a question.
Cas nods. “Can’t swallow them,” he says, “they taste bitter.”
“Because I’m fucking scared man. I’m so scared. Because this is who I am, who I’ve always been. I don’t know how to be anyone else, any other way. These feelings, this voice in the back of my head that says ‘you’re wrong, there’s something wrong with you’ that’s been there so long I can’t imagine what it would be like without it. Who would I be if I just woke up one day and it was gone? If I admit that there’s nothing wrong with me and I can just have what the hell I want, be who the hell I want? It terrifies me Cas.”
They are both grinning at each other, almost laughing because neither of them quite understand what is going on.
"Can't you sense anything?"
"No, they're dead."
When he looks away from the mirror he notices a pile of clothes by the side of the sink. There is a new pair of dark blue jeans; an old, black, faded t-shirt, which he recognizes as Dean's - he can still smell him when he holds the soft fabric to his face - some new socks, underwear and a jumper made from warm brown-amber wool. He runs his fingers over the incredibly soft sweater, feeling the fibers warm his hand as he strokes it. It is new; there is a tag still sticking out of the collar and he imagines Dean standing in a store, choosing it for him. Why had he picked this one? Was it the style he liked? The color? When he holds it up in front of the mirror the autumnal colors make his blue eyes look brighter. Is that why he chose it?
Cas and Dean have been talking and drinking and laughing for what feels like hours when Cas looks over to the window and notices the darkness through the gap in the drapes.
“Fuck you. I can see it, he can see it. There are people on the international fucking space station who can see it!”
"No? What do you wanna do?"
Cas smiles and shakes his head. Even without his powers he can see Sam is still not well. His skin is drawn and sallow, his eyes are sunken and ringed with bruise-purple and he coughs too much.
“Yeah me too, this is really nice. Thank you Dean.”
Dean nods and points into the distance. "Yeah I'm good. She's over there," he says, his voice sounding strangely muffled in the snow bound surroundings.
"You got family there?"
‘I love you.’
“Why do you always do this?” Sam hisses, his voice low.
After a short scuffle Dean has possession of the whiskey and is sitting on the other bed, pouring the liquor into one of the plastic cups Sam had produced from his bag. ‘Ok then,’ he says, carefully balancing the cup between his knees as he over-fills it with whiskey. ‘What’s the deal with this place? Ghosts? Demons? Bigfoot?’
"Hear, hear," he agrees.
“Because?” Cas prompts him quietly.
Dean laughs. “Ok good, I guess.” He takes a bite of his own sandwich and leans back in the chair.
are real.
“I love you,” Dean says immediately. He realises it sounds faintly accusatory, as if it were a secret Cas had been keeping from him. “I’m
Dean rolls his eyes. “You’re not supposed to chew them, they taste like shit.”
“Dean?” His voice is even deeper than usual.
Cas blinks, he hadn't even realised Dean had a roommate. "Oh," he says, "it's fine, really. Don't worry about it." Brilliant. Well done for caving in at the first opportunity to mention the problem, he thinks to himself.
A sound from the doorway makes him look up and there’s Cas, smiling and holding two bottles of beer.
comes right back to this! Friday night in some shitty dive watching you play Dean Winchester: Over-compensator Extraordinaire. Chasing tail like a horny teenager while I try and make conversation and pretend not to notice how sad you both are. Every. Fucking. Time!” he yells, jabbing Dean’s chest for emphasis.
“Goodnight Dean.”
“Not a dick, definitely a bit of an annoying neighbour? But you've redeemed yourself.” Cas grins.
He moves his hand faster, breath stuttering, ragged panting under hot rain. He imagines Dean on his knees before him, smiling up at him as he takes him in his mouth and sinks down, swirling his tongue along the underside of his cock, sucking and licking until Cas can’t help the sounds that come from his mouth, the pleas and prayers and moans. Dean moving forward even further, pushing his nose into warm, soft hair, humming darkly, digging his fingers into Cas’s ass, opening his throat until Cas feels himself surrounded by tight, wet heat. He imagines looking down at Dean, at his plush lips wrapped around his cock, emerald eyes locked on his and he comes over his hand with a shout, pressing the back of his other hand against his mouth to muffle the sound of Dean’s name.
“No!” Dean snaps, pulling his hand back, wincing at the pain. “Get out of here Cas. I’m not...I can’t…”
Cas swallows and nods. Dean leans back against the headboard, stretching his legs in front of him. They are silent for a while until Cas says softly, “I can't hear them any more.”
Dean rattles the little vending drawer, trying to force it open. “What show? What the fuck are you talking about?”
Dean gives a sharp laugh. Is that what he really thinks Dean wants? “Yeah, not really in the mood now Cas,” he says, sounding harsher than he meant to.
Passing the bottle back to his brother, Dean pushes himself upright and walks, somewhat unsteadily, to the small bathroom. He takes a piss then stands in front of the age-spotted mirror as he turns on the faucet. The pipes make an ominous clanking noise and the water that trickles out into the antique sink has a distinctly rusty tinge. Dean grimaces and decides against washing his hands.  His reflection in the mirror, behind the worn silvering, looks thinner than he remembers and there are shadows under his eyes. The boredom and depression he’s been mired in since Benny left is etched in the new lines on his face. He scrubs his hands slowly over his eyes, trying to wipe away the gloom that pulls at the corners of his mind, threatening to drag him back down.
‘See you again soon. I promise.’
They stare at each other in silence for a moment, both equally surprised by the question. Then Dean lets out a rush of breath and says, "Because you're family Cas."
‘He came back. He saw us together and he followed me here and he…he had a gun. He shot me in the arm and I fell and he came after me. He wouldn’t listen, he just kept coming. He kept saying if he couldn’t have me no one would. He was fucking crazy. I said you were coming, that you would stop him but he just laughed. I begged him… I just wanted to see you again, I just wanted you to walk in that door but you didn’t come and he…’ A pause, Cas looks uncertain then continues in a quieter tone.  ‘…he shot me and I died. I died and then I kept on dying. I kept on begging and calling for you and he kept on shooting me and I kept on dying. Until today.’ His eyes are filled with tears, his hands twitch as he tries to reach out again.
His eyes light up when he talks, Cas can immediately see that he loves his work, he wishes he felt that way about his job. He smiles, "That sounds fascinating, and if your car is anything to go by you must be great at it."
Cas grins. ‘I’d love to Dean.’
They're quiet for a moment while Dean watches the snow fall and Cas mentally kicks himself.
"Does it usually feel dead?"
Cas looks up and nods.
the idiots on the internet.’
It is only as he is putting on the clothes that he is hit by the realization that Dean must have come in and left them in the bathroom while he was in the shower. His face heats up, flushing scarlet as he wonders how much he saw, or heard.
Cas struggles to sit up a bit, coughing wetly. “I still feel awful,” he says through the cough. His voice is a sticky whisper.
Dean gestures at the screen with a grimace. "Can you believe this shit?"
“You might get sick.”
Under his annoyance Dean sounds sad and Cas finds himself feeling a bit sorry for his irritating neighbour. Although also deeply relieved because the thought that they might have ended up sitting next to each other on the flight makes him quietly horrified.
Cas frowns. “Nothing I…a dream,” he says quietly. He hadn't even realised he had called out.
“You’re a fucking multi-dimensional wavelength of celestial intent - or whatever - and I want...I feel...well yeah. That’s fucking terrifying.”
When he gets out he wraps a large white towel around his waist and scrubs at his wet hair with another one.
"No worries, you weren't to know. Anyway it was a long time ago - back when my brother was just a baby. Bobby - the guy I run my shop with - he raised us."
The questions and queries wash over him. He answers as many as he can until thinking begins to feel like swimming in syrup. His eyes are sore and his movements sluggish and heavy. He blinks several times.
Dean laughs. "Yeah I can tell from the way you look like you're sucking a lemon."
"Is it the same outside?"
“Cool.”
"You said you were going to see your brother?" Cas asks.
“But we didn’t know. Or, we did know but we...forgot?”
“You’re not His heroes any more.”
"Oh god, I'm so sorry Dean."
Dean says nothing, afraid of what might come out if he opens his mouth now. He sets his jaw and glares, eyes glassy and fixed. His hands flex at his sides as visions of punching his brother flit over his mind.
Cas nods. "Yeah, he does pull out all the stops. There's always more food than anyone can reasonably eat - or any army really. His cooking almost makes up for his incredibly unrefined sense of humour and his horrible practical jokes." He sighs, thinking of Gabriel's less than subtle hints about his boyfriend's brother. "To be honest I'm almost glad I couldn't go this year though," he adds in a confiding tone, "Gabriel has a new boyfriend - who seems lovely, he's not the issue at all - but the boyfriend's brother was going to be there too and I have a horrible feeling they were trying to set us up."
When Dean stands in front of him and puts his hands on his shoulders, turning him to look into his face, he is speechless. Eyes the color of the trees search his, tiny lines crease the skin between them, Dean’s mouth is set in a line, his jaw is tight, he looks angry, but not at Cas. The last few rays of the dying sunlight fall on his face and hair and it’s as if Cas has never seen him before, which, in a way, he hasn’t. Before, he had seen only his soul, a brilliant, radiant, cracked thing; patched with threads of his own grace. This though; the brilliant eyes, the scatter of freckles that mark his skin like stars, the determined set of his jaw, is this what other people see when they look at Dean. How do they ever look away?
He rubs his hands over his eyes as if he could scrub away the fear.
"What?"
Dean nods and then looks up, staring straight at Cas over the tiny flame. Deep shadows dance over his face, his features are cast into sharp relief. He suddenly looks very tired.
“What if I can't - get used to it I mean - What will happen to me?”
“Dude he's asleep on his feet, can't you tell?” Sam chides his brother gently after a while. He looks on the verge of passing out himself. He glances at his watch then shows it to Dean.
Dean stretches his shoulders, muscles rolling, spine cracking. He lets out a deep, exhausted groan and Cas watches, transfixed. Dean opens his eyes and meets Cas’s stare. His face flushes crimson and he looks away. He swears under his breath. “So…” he starts, then clears his throat, “Glad you made it Cas, we were getting worried.”
"Gabriel. He's a chef."
Cas shakes his head. “Not at all, I completely agree.”
They reach a dark wooden door, seemingly identical to many others that line the halls. “Here we are – home sweet home.” Dean says and pushes open the door to reveal a small room with a freshly made bed, a t-shirt and a pair of sleep pants are folded on the covers. “Sorry these are a bit old and ratty,” Dean says, gesturing to the clothes, “they're all I've got for now but we’ll get you some new stuff soon ok?”
Sam raises his eyebrows. “Yeah Dean was about to come looking for you,” he says.
Dean sits on his bed, eyes wide, heart pounding. What the hell? He’s in
"Exactly!" he agrees, nodding, "I've read some of these so many times I could recite them to you but that's part of what's great about them I guess. Familiarity."
The End – Merry belated Christmas!
Cas goes over to the switch, it's still in the up position. He pulls and pushes it experimentally but nothing happens.
"Fuck! Fucking weather!" Dean groans as he turns away from the board, Cas can't avert his gaze quick enough and they are suddenly looking right at each other. Crap. Recognition dawns in the other man's eyes and his face lights up. "Cas!"
Cas flushes, then shrugs. "Not really, I feel like I've had enough flings in my time. Don't really want to waste time on one night - or one-Christmas - stands anymore," he replies thoughtfully. "But mainly I just hate blind dates," he adds.
‘You too Cas.’ They look at each other for a moment until Cas turns to leave with a faintly sad smile.
"Wow. You're not wrong - that's definitely too much family," Dean agrees with a grin.
‘What the hell are you talking about? This place is amazing,’ Sam says, running his hand over the furniture, then trying surreptitiously to wipe the resulting dust on his jeans. ‘This is meant to be the most haunted hotel in the state,’ he grins.
He opens the book and flips to the scene where Sam found him drinking Purple Nurples in the college bar with the coed, who he still maintains was definitely – probably – called something way classier than Starla. He remembers her, a hazy impression of a blonde who, he is now prepared to admit, may have been less hot than he thought at the time. But he also remembers...Jake? Joe? Definitely a J name anyway. Also potentially less hot than the beer goggles had suggested but cute, funny, flirty. He remembers his hand on his ass and something probably filthy, but sadly inaudible over the music, being whispered in his ear. It was him that he’d been talking to when Sam had appeared with his disapproving act, not Starla. He has always known that but he is also just realising it for the first time.
Dean places the tray on the side table and sits on the edge of the bed. He puts a hand to Cas’s forehead, grimacing at the clammy heat. “You’re still too hot,” he says. He hands Cas a large glass of water which he accepts gratefully. It still hurts to swallow but the cool liquid offers some relief from the dry, scratchy pain.
“It’s broken,” Cas says and takes his hand again, firm but gentle. Dean tries to pull it away but now there’s angelic force behind the strength that prevents him. He sighs in resignation and lets Cas run his thumb over his swollen knuckles. His hand tingles with the familiar warmth of Cas’ grace suffusing his skin and bone. He swallows hard, finds his mouth dry and almost chokes. Cas just looks down, intent on his healing as Dean’s split skin and bones knit and his skin smoothes, until the drops of blood are the only evidence. He swipes at them with his thumb and the whole thing is gone. No pain, no scars. “Better?” he asks.
“So let’s stop it. It won’t even be the first time we’ve done that,” Cas whispers as he leans forward. “The whole reason we’re even here today is that you refused to play the part you were literally born to play. You rejected that without a second thought. Remember that. Just because this role is one you’ve cast yourself in, doesn’t mean you can’t reject it in the same way.”
There is no answer; he knocks until the pain in his hand makes it impossible and then he stands still, listening, trying not to be terrified of the silence, of all the things he can no longer hear. He turns, defeated and lets all the air out of his lungs in a draining rush as he leans back against the cold door, closing his eyes against the low evening sun that flashes through the tree line.
"You got much family?" Dean asks, turning to Cas again.
Dean laughs, "Well, here's to you getting published then," he holds out his glass and Cas smiles and clinks his own against it.
Dean gives up on the machine, slamming a hand against it in frustration and turns on his brother. “Yeah Sam, I am. Because
Dean puts the plates down, three thick sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly on white bread. Sam takes one and Dean pushes one towards Cas. "Here, eat. It's not much, guess we need to buy more groceries."
Cas pauses, he can't place anything particular. Not that he necessarily could with his grace this battered. He shakes his head sadly.
‘True.’
He frowns and returns his concentration to the dark road ahead. Moments later however, when he catches himself again, he is thinking about Cas’s trench-coat and how much he wants to see it hanging up in the bunker again. How it feels to see Cas without his coat. That leads directly to more specific thoughts related to Cas without his coat...
say ‘what’ again! You
Dean is still for a moment then pulls back to look him in the eye.
Dean nods. Slowly he sits down on the edge of the bed. “Do you want me to…I could sit with you if you like?”
When he hears the familiar guttering roar of the Impala’s engine he looks up. When he sees the brothers walking towards him he finds his throat tightening and something prickling at the corners of his eyes, his chest feels tight, he bites his lip, his face is wet and he’s not sure why.
“What are you afraid of?”
He’s in love with Cas. He lets out a deep breath. He knows this, it’s nothing new or shocking. Dean is bisexual, always has been. He has been attracted to guys plenty of times, it’s just part of who he is. He’s Dean Winchester; he hunts monsters, he loves his brother and his car, and he is in love with Castiel, sometime angel of the lord.
"Yes. My brother."
‘Bite me.’
He thinks about the way Dean looks at him, the way he bites his pink tongue unconsciously between perfect teeth, the way his eyes almost glow, the flush on his neck and cheek. He wonders how Dean would look if he did take the plunge and kiss him. How would his lips feel against his? What it would be like to have Dean kiss his neck, the way he almost did that night outside the bunker? What would Dean’s skin taste like if he were to lick that place below his ear that he finds so oddly appealing?
Sam nods. “Yeah, it’s good having the gang back together.”
"Beer? Whiskey? Coke?"
They look at each other, at the flame reflected in each other's eyes until Dean turns and walks out of the room. Cas stands in the inky dark and looks after him.
"Awesome! What kind of thing do you write?"
"I dunno man! Because I do. Why do I have to have a reason?"
Cas laughs. "Oh it's pretty terrible. It's just what I did at college, my parents were keen on me getting a 'proper' job, it pays well enough but it's mind-numbingly tedious to be honest."
Dean grabs his suitcase and pulls it the rest of the way to the car, ignoring Cas's faint protests. To be honest Cas is glad to be rid of the unwieldy thing.
Sam shakes his head and smiles, "It's your funeral," he says, "I'm glad you're here now anyway. Not least because it might stop Dean climbing the fucking walls," he added, almost to himself.
A glass chinking sound from behind him makes him turn, Sam is holding up a bottle. Dean grins. ‘You’re the best Sammy, I don’t care what everyone else says.’
Sam grins and sits down on one of the two neatly made, single beds. Both have identical green artificial silk quilts and thin, yellow candlewick blankets that look as old as the building itself. ‘Anyway,’ he sighs, bouncing experimentally on the edge of the mattress, ‘stop pretending you hate this so much, you used to love this stuff as much as I do. You didn’t have to come but it sure as shit beats sitting at home or in some crappy dive bar drowning your sorrows in whiskey and/or shit TV.’
"Because I finally figured it out. I finally get it and I have no idea how to say it, but as long as you're here I still have time. I don't have to say it today, there's always tomorrow."
“Do you even know her fucking name? Tell me her name and I won’t say another word.”
Sam looks up as he returns, takes in his pallor and frowns. ‘You ok?’ he asks. Dean nods, sitting back on the bed. He says nothing, afraid his voice will betray him. ‘Did you see something?’ Sam asks excitedly.
He is moving before he realises it and Dean is following him. He walks through the rooms and corridors until they stop outside an unmarked door. He pushes it. It creaks open loudly, revealing a small room, almost a closet, with a hugely elaborate sigil painted on the floor. It is, or was, a spell for perpetual renewal. Very old and beautifully crafted. However there is now a break in it - one of the swirling lines on the floor is scuffed, it looks very much as if someone had dragged a knife across it.
Dean grins. "Knew there was a reason we kept you around."
They sit back on the couch and Dean calls the restaurant while Cas flips through the movies on offer on Netflix. Eventually he settles on some superhero movie, which seems a safe choice. Dean grins when he chooses it and gives him the thumbs up.
He gathered the tattered remains of his wits about him and hauled himself half way across the country to Lebanon, Kansas. He walked, hitched, took buses and walked again, to find himself outside what looks like an abandoned electrical substation. He bangs his fist against the rough metal, trying not to think about the pain that sparks up his arm when he does so; or about the ache in his legs and blisters on his feet, the gritty tiredness of his eyes, the thumping pain in his head, the hunger, the thirst. There will be time to consider all of that later.
“Soup, Tomato rice soup.” Dean says.
Dean takes a deep breath and passes Cas in the doorway, headed back to the living room. As Cas follows he sees him shake his head and murmur something under his breath.
"Well I'm back baby, sooner than expected," he mutters as he slams the trunk again and runs his hand lovingly over the cars smooth lines. Cas is oddly charmed by the gesture, despite knowing he should find it ridiculous.
He feels heat gathering in his groin and looks down to see his cock, hard and jutting between his legs. He reaches down and wraps his wet hand around solid flesh, gasping at the sensation. His breath catches as he moves his fist, dragging along the length and back, thrusting into the tight grip of his hand. He closes his eyes and tips his head back against the cool of the tiled wall. In his minds-eye it is Dean’s hand grasping him, Dean’s green eyes staring into his, face flushed, lips parted, breath ghosting against his neck as he moves his hand faster along Cas’s over-heated, achingly hard cock. He imagines the shiver of his skin as Dean moves down, sliding his hot tongue over his skin, licking the drops of water that run down his chest, flicking at his nipples, pebbling the skin and making him shiver as his breath cools shower-heated flesh.
There is that unfurling sensation inside him again.
“Oh God, where to start! The way you look at him when you think no one’s watching? The way he fucking
“Come inside,” Cas repeats, beckoning.
"What about you? What do you do?" Dean asks.
‘From what? What happened to you?’
"The car, my baby." Dean explains. Cas raises an eyebrow but says nothing, of course Dean is the kind of guy to name his car. He has seen Dean's 'baby' before, parked on the street outside their building. It's a huge, old Chevy, shiny and black and extremely inefficient looking. The noise of its stupidly huge engine has woken Cas on more than one occasion. He rolls his eyes and stomps through the snow towards the slick, black shape in the distance.
Cas reaches out silently and touches a finger to the wound, which vanishes in the warm glow of his grace. “Something’s different,” he says, taking the bottle from Dean and opening it easily.
‘No sign of ghosts?’ Sam looks disappointed under his half smile.
He looks down at his carry on case and sighs again as he wonders what to do about his checked luggage. All around him people are staring in disbelief at the screens, grumbling, cursing and, in some cases, crying. Cancelled flights on Christmas Eve are always awful. The sight of all the people who won't be able to get home to see their families’ pulls at his heart but there's nothing he, or they, can do now. He's just going to have to go home to his tiny apartment again. He had been looking forward to seeing his brother Gabriel and his new boyfriend but he knows they'll understand. He will try and get another flight in a couple of days. He feels a small pang of guilt when he realises that he is a little bit happy at the prospect of a quiet Christmas Day spent alone with Netflix and junk food. Although he loves his brother, he also likes his own company and meeting new people always fills him with mild panic. Gabriel had hinted that his boyfriend's brother would also be there and he had a nasty feeling that he was being set up on some kind of blind date. Another thing that throws him into a state of nervousness.
Cas watches him from the doorway as he stares unseeing, sight turned inward. Cas feels his chest tighten. His skin tingles as he watches Dean. He wants - more than he has ever wanted anything as long as he can remember - to touch him.
Dean takes it and this time the spark he feels doesn’t even surprise him. It’s not shocking; it’s comfortable and familiar.
“Really?” Sam’s voice is raised now. “You’re just gonna pretend you have no idea what I’m talking about?”
Sam looks up. “That Cas?” he asks, gesturing to Dean’s phone.
Cas takes a swig from the bottle without looking at the label. That is easier, it dilutes the taste, cuts through the sensations.
“You would be you. Because you do know it, deep down. I know you do. You just have to accept it.”
Dean laughs and wraps his arms around him tighter.
He turns away in disgust, looking out of the airport windows at the howling blizzard outside. Snowflakes swirl and splatter against the glass, rapidly covering the runways and the still, silent planes.
‘Wow this place is a dump Sammy, even by your standards,’ Dean sighs.
As the dreaded words appear next to every flight on the departures list Castiel Novak lets out a deep sigh. He stares at the screen for a few more moments, hoping for some kind of Christmas miracle to make the word next to his flight to Boston change into a gate number. No such luck.
Outside the snow is becoming somewhat apocalyptic and they can hardly see the parking lot, let alone the car.
Dean nods, peering up at the pitch black sky, "Yeah. He lives in Boston, he's just out of law school, real hotshot." The words are accompanied by an eye roll but the pride in Dean's voice and wry smile would be obvious to anyone. Cas smiles. "That’s great. Do you have a lot of siblings?"
Cas squints but he can't see anyone. "She?"
. Who is it even for these days? God knows I don’t care.”
Cas watches him too; his brilliant green eyes are soft but a tiny bit red at the edges from lack of sleep. They flicker over Cas’s face, looking for signs of something worse than a cold, a sign that he has not been taking enough care of him. Cas might not be able to read Dean’s mind any more but he doesn’t need to; his fear and concern are written in the lines of his face.
Cas toes off his shoes, the floor is cold and his socks are wet.
"It's ok, I like it," Cas says wondering what the hell is wrong with him. This is the music that drives him nuts every day when it blares down from Dean's apartment.
‘Touché,’ Dean sighs heavily. ‘What the fuck is the world coming to?’
Cas turns back to look at him. His head is cocked to the side like a curious bird. Dean wishes he knew why he had said those words aloud, and what exactly he planned to say next.
"Cas! You ok buddy?"
“Hello Dean.” He can hardly hear his own voice.
Cas blushes and tries to sit up, he feels something stopping him and realises that Dean's arm is draped around his shoulders. He smiles. “Sorry, guess I was more tired than I thought,” he says, still looking up at Dean.
Once they’ve eaten they stay sitting at the table, chatting. Dean wants to know everything that has happened to him since the Fall. How did he get here? Has he seen any other Angels? He doesn't mention Metatron or the spell or how he tricked him, and Cas is grateful. He doesn't know how to begin processing that yet.
Cas stares down at the plate. He has only the vaguest idea of what it is. He understands the concept and purpose of food, he's not an idiot; it’s just that the specifics are sometimes a bit more of a mystery. The only thing he ate and drank on his journey here were burgers and coffee. At least he knew he liked them, plus the coffee made it easier not to sleep.
"I don't want you too. Having you here, it's...it's everything I want man. You here, Sam here, all of us together. It's the closest I've been to home for fucking ever man. I know I don't deserve it but somehow I've got it and I'm so fucking scared. I'm so afraid that I'll wake up one morning and you'll be gone."
His skin is clammy, crawling with either prickling heat or shivery chills from one moment to the next. His chest aches like someone is sitting on it, his throat is dry and scratchy, his eyes hurt; they water when he tries too hard to focus on something and his voice has almost entirely disappeared.
It’s been four days since he crashed to the Earth in a spinning, agonizing shower of sparks and feathers; since Metatron dragged his grace out and cast him aside like a gutted fish; since he watched a million fiery shooting stars plummet around him and realized, with a sickening crawl of terror and guilt, exactly what had happened. Three days since he finally managed to call Dean. The intense sweep of relief he felt at the sound of his voice over the distorted line was the first hint that all might, possibly, be ok.
“Hey buddy,” he says, his voice hushed, “how’re you doing?”
A vortex of sparks lights up the room for an instant and then there is nothing but darkness.
The man puts out his hand. ‘Castiel,’ he says as Dean takes it.  At the sound of the name Dean freezes, his grip tightening as an uncontrollable flood of someone else’s memories cascade over him. Castiel looks alarmed for a moment then it’s as if he tunes in to the charged atmosphere. He looks down at their hands and back up into Dean’s eyes. ‘Dean…’ he breathes, eyes wide but unfocused. The spell only lasts for a second, then they let go of each other’s hands and blink as if they’ve just woken up. ‘Good to meet you Cas,’ Dean says. Castiel doesn’t correct him.
