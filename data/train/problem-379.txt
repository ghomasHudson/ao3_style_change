"is that really what you're concerned about?" John asked him "This is a Child, a four year old girl who is desperate and afraid and frankly i'd be more scared of morons like you reproducing I mean if you ever get Donovan pregnant it will most likely be because you tricked her." John said annoyed before he headed back to the cab he could just imagine the smug look on Sherlock's face if he saw the look on Anderson's face.
the tone in Sherlock's voice was one of frustration obviously it was against his will, which told John exactly what had happened to Katherine.
"To think that, he of all people has a child! Shouldn't there be a law about people like him reproducing? limit the number of sociopaths and nut cases there are-" Anderson stopped when he found John glaring daggers at him
"Do you mind? this isn't as easy as it looks and I want to figure out the retina. so please kindly shut up." Katherine told him frowning before she looked down again Anderson was forced into a stunned silence since a four year old had just used the term "Retina" and told him to shut up in the same phrase, Molly had to bite her lip to stop herself from laughing at the look on his face and John hid his by pretending to have a coughing fit in the corner as Anderson continued to gawk, for a moment he stood and stared at them before he headed for the door
Sherlock could see the flashing lights from the window of the apartment that he and Mycroft had been instructed to wait in. Mycroft sat at the table tapping the tip of a pen to a table, a nervous habit, sherlock observed though he couldn't decide if he was worried about Katherine or his job being on the line. Sherlock assumed more the later, if he really cared about Katherine he wouldn't have shipped her off to boarding school at four years old.
“If you don’t Rosie certainly will.” Sherlock said with absolutely no filter what so ever to try and hide his opinion earning a harsh glare from both Tiffany and John, but as usual Sherlock ignored it and his new “lady friend” attempted to engage him in another conversation to which he only responded when necessary
"No!" John said quickly "No no don't do that stay on the line with me alright?" John asked her urgently Katherine let out a small fearful whimper "It'll be alright I promise" John said calmer now trying to keep her from crying again, god he hated it when children cried it broke your heart or at least his not to mention he was also slightly afraid of what Sherlock would do if Sherlock found out he made her cry.
"John can I talk to you in the kitchen for a moment." Molly tried to say softly but John looked at the clock
"As you may know last night the international bank was broken into no money was stolen just a safe deposit box left behind was the card for Mycroft Holmes at six thirty tonight the apartment building three blocks from my home, 44 Clark Avenue will be burned to the ground with everyone inside, if you try to evacuate before hand We'll blow up the building ahead of time, however no one will be harmed if you can tell us what is in the box. you have until six tonight to tell us, Moriarty sends his love."
“Forgive him, he doesn’t think before he speaks and is rather insensitive to other people’s feelings.” John apologized to her Tiffany nodded a bit continuing to twist her hair around her finger and took a long moment to pause in silence between the two and listen to her friend, John couldn’t even remember her name now as he tried to think about how to dig himself out of the hole, he had stepped in.
“John Lestrade wants us to excuse ourselves to the rest rom and call him immediately.” Sherlock said practically springing to his feet obviously all to happy to get out of this John was relieved to have a little bit of a breather as he stood with an apology and followed sherlock to the rest room to make the phone call
"You'll have your challenge by tomorrow morning expect a video to arrive at the police station at precisely eight twenty-two am." Sherlock said the next part caught him slightly off guard
"I'll see you soon Katherine alright?" Sherlock told her Katherine nodded and hurried out wanting to get her things as quickly as possible Sherlock stood and shook hands with Mycroft before he went into the kitchen no doubt to start cleaning out the freezer.
"Molly!" The woman said surprised and Rosie realized instantly they knew each other, and from the look on Molly's face it wasn't a good thing.
Sherlock paused looking down at the box suspiciously as if he now doubted that it was actually there and that Irene herself was going through it
that was what he was forgetting. John smiled as he walked over and put down the bag of vegetables on the table in front of Rosie and Molly, John had decided himself that he was ready to start dating a while ago but whenever he tried it never worked out and he would decide that maybe he wasn't ready and every time he had the told Rosie that he would be going out with a woman and she never seemed to mind but this time the date was set before the conversation and John felt like maybe this time he should actually talk to his little girl this time.
"The police will be here soon I already told Lestrade to bring an ambulance so I hope they'll make it here too" he explained to John.
"How did you get her out of here with out anyone knowing?" Moriarty shouted over the line. Katherine was gone? How could that be possible? where could she have gone?
She was using a pay phone, why would she be using a pay phone if she was with a friend why wouldn't she just ask his mother to borrow her cell phone? had she been picked up by another kidnapper? no not possible a ransom would have been asked for by now. Then what?
"Inside the box, some of the contents should include your wife's wedding ring, a letter to Katherine from her, a letter from you as well just in case anything were to happen to you on a case, and some secret files that you two were going over for Mycroft at the time of her death."
Apparently this meeting was supposed to be secret, Katherine had time off from school and instead of spending it with her Aunt, she had been put on a plane back to England to see Sherlock in secret.
As John pulled up to his home that he had once shared with Mary and walked in he was trying to place the thought that he was forgetting
John hurried into Lestrade's office, he didn't look happy which was a cause for worry. John shut the door behind him and sat in the chair across from him Lestrade said nothing to him just took out his answering machine and pressed play, a moment later Sherlock's voice played.
Sherlock chose to ignore it, he had more important things to worry about. Katherine, Serina's case, John's view of him. In that order those were the three things he worried about at the moment from most to least, everything else was mostly irrelevant.
"Well it certainly took you boys long enough." Moriarty said stepping out from behind a tree dramatically, Sherlock handed Katherine over to John and walked towards Moriarty, death written in both their eyes as they stalked closer
Hi you guys I hope you're still continuing to read this because I love writing this i'm not usually good with this mystery ish stuff and I hope that someone at least likes how I ended the last chapter I tried to make it cute.
John looked surprised to see that there were no experiments, no rotting of corpses or human eyeballs just tea.
"I'm here Katherine." Sherlock said Mycroft then stopped fighting sherlock allowing him to drop down into a sitting position on the bed "are you alright?"
The door burst open then and sherlock only had time to say those three words before he was forced to hang up
there was a shuffling sound that John couldn't Identify but a moment later he did hear Katherine screaming
had saved him, under the ruse of a terror attack in London, but after nearly two years of undercover, Sherlock knew better. His brother had missed his own goal, he had allowed himself one weakness in his life, and tragically it was Sherlock.
There is a hot young man waiting in the queue for coffee, and Sherlock can not concentrate. He has worked at Mrs Hudson’s bakery shop for nearly a year. It is a popular meeting place for many students and also teenagers, due to the cosy tables and cushioned chairs, the bookshelves and of course the different hot and cold drinks. The absolute highlight are the cakes and muffins Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock’s employer, regularly pulls out of her oven.
A high voice mocks him, speaking like parents would talk to their newborn. It reminds Sherlock of Moriarty, and it sends immediately cold shivers down his back.
John questions him. It’s meant to be teasing, but Sherlock reacts hurt. His eyes glide away from John’s face, and he walks a bit faster.
"But… I left for two years and made you think I was dead. I killed myself in front of you. I made you think we were going to die in an explosion so you will forgive you. I turned back to the drugs, I failed to catch the whole Mary thing on time.“
"It would also better for Rosie, I think. Of course, the room upstairs is a bit too small for two, but it will work for a while. We could go back on cases too, and Mrs Hudson or Molly can look after Rosie when we are busy..."
, had adopted them, after a fire had killed their parents and burned down most of the village, and brought the siblings to the capital. He could have easily made them into slaves, but he and his wife Julia had treated them like their own. It was
“It is always nice to find fellow comrades. Us teachers are working alone in the classrooms every day, so it is even more important to have a fellow professor to talk to.
The gladiator finally answered Sherlock’s prayer when he pulled out his now three fingers, leaving Sherlock feeling empty for a terrible second. John situated himself in front of his arse, lined up his cock to his hole and then he plunges slowly inside him.
Sherlock’s screams were still running through his head while they flew through time again, and landed back into the orphanage. They were now in another room, just as dirty and cold as the ones before. A few children were playing with broken soldier figures on a brown carpet. Mycroft searched for Sherlock and found him huddled in a corner. He had not grown much and was now wearing an iron brace around his right leg. His face was hidden behind a blanket. His health must not have improved then, thought Mycroft. He would have been of no use to father.
20 minutes later, John has finished his shopping trip and has even found his tea, plus Sherlock’s favourite chocolate (he will never admit it, but the detective has a sweet tooth). Hopefully it will cheer him up.
’s candle. He liked the darkness, it was cheaper. The young Marley resolutely checked every surface, under the bed, in the closet, on the table. There was nobody in the house except him.
“Lestrade, if you would be so kind to stop pointing your gun at me? Do it, or I will stop our favourite detective. Believe me, I will be faster than you.
John exclaims. The Room of Requirement has delivered them a gigantic bed, a table with snacks and whiskey, a closed window and a small bathroom. Numerous mistletoes are hanging from the ceiling, and a decorated Christmas Tree awaits in the corner.
John sighs. At least Sherlock is safe in a cab and not kidnapped. He shoulders his bag and goes to the next bus station. On his way, too loud Christmas music is being played everywhere. At a book store it’s “Last Christmas
Now the tags were missing. John even forced himself to call Mrs. Hudson and ask her to look if it somehow slipped under the bed or behind the desk, but she didn’t find them either.
"Upstairs." he demanded John didn't budge at first folding his arms across his chest stubbornly hoping that perhaps he could slow him down. Moriarty pulled a gun pointing it at Katherine "Now!" he demanded his voice echoing in the blood stained room and Katherine let out a small cry of fear.
oh and i'd like to apologize if I don't get things right, i'm an american writing a fanfiction for a british show and i don't know all the terms they use so sorry
"Oh that Molly calling," Sharon told him finishing her third glass of red wine, John had been counting and noticed how her attitude had been changing quite drastically with the addition of the alcohol
It was a week before they heard from Moriarty again, John was out of the hospital and resting in the Flat but was told to take it easy. Like that was going to happen when a psychopath had his best friends daughter.
"I didn't have time, besides what was he going to do? say that he couldn't go out with her there and then?" Molly asked Rosie huffed and tried to think for a minute completely abandoning the project for a minute and Molly could see the gears in her head turning
the two of them they hated each other, though now john had a better understanding of Sherlock's hatred for his brother, and just why hadn't they run when they had the chance? Why hadn't Sherlock taken Katherine after that and just gone far far away, and now that lunatic had her! a small helpless four year old girl!
“I didn’t take her, I got a call from a peculiar number and how could I refuse a sweet little voice like that when she asked for help saving her daddy and Sherlock?” Irene said as if this were all to terribly obvious she looked at Rosie and smiled before she approached and ruffled the little girl’s hair, she didn’t usually like it but something about Irene’s gentle touch made her laugh a little bit
“You can’t text sherlock from this thing.” Lestrade said as he moved back to his desk and stuck the phone in a drawer locking it so she couldn’t reach it he knew she’d try something and her father had warned him ahead of time of Rosie’s last sabotage of his date despite her and Molly having the best intentions (he still couldn’t believe that she had roped Molly into it, this kid truly had everyone like putty in the palm of her hand) Rosie glared back at him and plopped herself down on the floor crossing her arms and pouting a little bit Lestrade thought he heard her mutter something under her breath in what sounded like Latin and that alone told him that she had been taking up more studies with Sherlock though he wasn’t sure why she would want to know Latin or why he would want her to, actually he wasn’t sure he wanted to know in all honesty.
"Sharon!" John came quickly over and smiled at her giving her an awkward hug since he didn't want to kiss her in front of Rosie "Sharon this is Molly Hooper she's a friend of mine from my side business." John introduced them Sharon made no indication that she knew Molly to John though acting surprised which told Rosie this was a bad sign to begin with
"Rosie she is a lovely woman and I think you'll really like her." John promised her Rosie sighed and leaned back in her seat clearly not happy as she pouted, she wouldn't even touch her cookies after that she left them on the counter to get cold and John knew she was going to sneak them to school tomorrow to spite him.
At first Irene thought the line had gone dead because it had gotten so silent for so long but just before she asked she heard him say
“I know, but I’ve got to save my dad he’s so terribly blind and these women he picks are no good and lord knows he has better taste than Lestrade does so whatever woman he’s set him up with is bound to be worse than anyone he could have found on his own.” Rosie told her dramatically slouching in her seat as she buckled her seatbelt and Irene couldn’t help but chuckle at the slight resemblance to Sherlock’s behavior it was obvious that they spent a lot of quality time together and knowing Sherlock’s eye for John it didn’t surprise her
“If you ever need some girl talk that doesn’t involve murder sweetie you know my number,” Irene told her before she looked at Sherlock
John couldn’t help tapping his fingers on the table nervously, he kept glancing at his phone waiting for the moment that Rosie figured out that they had set her up, the woman across from him was talking on about…. what
I'm sorry it took so long for the update! life gets hectic as usual but i finally got an updated chapter it does kind of suck because I was at my dad's so it's very dialogue heavy hopefully i'll be updating my other sherlock fic as well within the next couple days or my avengers atlantis AU whichever i am more in the mood for.
"Came back early, figured I'd have a couple of days to settle in before going back to work, Who is this little angel?" Molly asked curiously Finally there was someone else who didn't know that Sherlock had a daughter! John felt much less in the dark with this revelation. Katherine smiled a bit and waved
It was a long cab ride home, Rosie sitting in John’s lap and falling asleep about half way there, John passed her off to Sherlock to get the door open and he put his things away Sherlock took her to bed and sat on the edge after tucking her in
“John, I don’t know why she even started a relationship with you, although I have a guess. Please, just call Mycroft.” Sherlock asked him while holding on to John’s arm like a lifeline.
“Come on,” he said, when John gave no indication of wanting to move at all. “Show me these ferns you were talking about. I hear there’s a lot to see in these gardens.”
Sherlock looks around the flat as if searching for a suitable reply and settles on "Well, I have been humbled a lot recently."
"That's it? We don't know a thing about each other and now we're looking at a flat?" John demanded. He didn't like others making decisions for him, never had, and his cat was bristling at the thought of taking orders from a stranger, and a Psy nonetheless.
"What is it this time?" Sherlock muttered, not even bothering to open his eyes. "If there's another tap dripping somewhere, go lap it up or something."
John barked and scrambled up the stairs, returning a minute later with both items. He had to navigate the stairs more carefully on his way down to avoid stepping on the lead or the strap of the bag but he managed it almost effortlessly. Sherlock smiled at the sight.
The silence between them changed, became expectant, and Sherlock blinked and realised that John must have asked him something while he had been lost in thought.
She glances back at John and Sherlock, takes in the emotionally exhausted, hunted expression on John's face again, re-evaluates the glances Sherlock keeps shooting him, and can't help but wonder ...
They stood and Sherlock waved away all of Angelo's protests, sneaking his card past the man in order to pay. He had perfected the move months ago.
Sherlock stood and turned to wink at the soldier standing in front of him. "I'm going to have a coffee."
John made a soft noise in his throat at that, blinking rapidly. "Yes. Let's do that. Whatever it takes. I'll be right there with you. No matter what."
Meeting his own gaze in the mirror, John quietly admitted to himself that he had not believed he would ever see his own face again.
"Yeah, but that's what usually happens," John reminded him, thinking back to some of their previous cases. "I bet he will find a way to sneak you his number before the day is out. Anyway, he strikes me as the kind of person who knows a lot of things about what's going on."
He paused again and then whispered: "I spent the past three days going back over this entire case and wondering what might have happened if I had spoken up. There were dozens of moments where I thought if only I could press
To get a grip on himself, he reached for the bottle of oil John had placed on the nightstand and poured some into his hands. “I think you should just take my place. There’s no point in pulling the towel back and forth.”
"Try not to bite them until we know what they want," Sherlock murmured. "We're trying to make a favourable impression."
John swallowed. "Well, if she shows you off in that outfit here, you'll probably have people forming a disorderly queue," he managed. "That guy from the fundraiser yesterday would have a heart attack."
"Clients?" Sally asks, perking up. As far as they both know, this is the first time Holmes has taken on a case for a private client since his return.
Or John's, because that was of course who Rosie spent the majority of her time with. And Sherlock had known that he would not be able to stop himself from becoming obsessed if given the chance.
Still, they had held back and John thought it was mostly because they enjoyed the teasing and the anticipation. Now, with Sherlock warm and still lax from sleep in his arms, he couldn't help but think that tonight couldn't come soon enough. Even his skin seemed to ache with the need to touch and be touched.
Lestrade nodded. "Good. That's good. Not the lack of progress, of course, but ... you're being a good friend, Sherlock." He made a face, clearly aware of how awkward he sounded. "Just ... keep in mind that John has a mind of his own and that he can give you his opinion."
He carefully lifted Sherlock up and carried him down the hall to dump him in his ridiculously comfortable bed.
"I needed the quiet," Sherlock admitted. "Still do. I needed something that was as far removed from ... from our life back home as I could possibly get."
He honestly didn't know how they had made it through the month without jumping each other's bones - they had certainly had ample provocation and more than enough built-up desire between the two of them.
A glass slipped from John's hand and landed in the sink with a splash, startling them both. Sherlock blinked and turned his head away, refocusing on drying the dishes.
This speech is punctuated by a particularly vicious stab of Sherlock's thumb to the screen of his phone, presumably to send an equally vicious text to his brother.
Sally sighs and gives in, just as she knew she would. So she tells him the entire, unabridged version. The clues and her theories, the evidence and the months it took to put it all together. She is intensely proud of herself for doing it almost entirely by herself.
Sherlock follows this time instead of standing there passively. When their lips meet, his mouth is already half open and
Hours later, after John had returned home to the flat he shared with Mary and was lying in bed, unable to sleep, he found himself thinking that it seemed a shame this marriage had never had a chance to be.
"Oh, it was terrible," Mrs Walczak added, shaking her head. "I hardly felt safe anymore but they reassured us it must have been a crime of opportunity and they would catch the killer in no time. The police said it was probably some vagabond roaming the countryside and stealing food where he can."
He nodded vigorously, making her laugh. "That's my boy. Now then, I'll leave you to it. Sherlock, do remember that John needs some kind of exercise even if he is to stay off his paw until it heals. Time to put that big brain to use and find a way to play with him."
“You would have let me marry her ... a woman I only met a little over a year ago ... because I wanted to?”
John rolled his eyes at him. "You know that's not what I meant. I'm having a great time. Much less stressful than all this wedding planning we've been doing."
Once they were ensconced at their usual table by the window, Sherlock dared to glance into the small mirror on the wall and found himself startled by the sight that greeted him. He and John, sitting as close as the table would allow without them being right next to each other. The light in John's eyes and the smile on his face. Even Sherlock's own face appeared softer somehow, more lively than he could ever remember being.
John raised his head to see if his friend would wake, but when Sherlock merely sighed and slept on, he turned back to his examination.
A low whine rose in his throat and he fought to quench it before it could become audible to the two men sharing the back seat with him.
"I went to see him this evening," Sherlock says, voice toneless. "Interrupted his proposal, I think. He wasn't pleased."
The two Holmes brothers lingered by the door, watching hawk-eyed as the scientist who had overseen most of the tests carefully injected the cure into John's front leg, at precisely the same spot where he had cut himself in the accident that had transformed him.
John turned his head to roll his eyes at him and noticed Sherlock doing the same. He huffed a laugh.
"Well, that's why then," John sighed. "I was at work when you left, you idiot. When I came back, you were already gone."
Sherlock supposed that was correct. He stood, abandoning the rest of his dinner. He wasn't all that hungry, anyway.
John may be a head shorter than Sherlock, but he made up for it in muscle mass, which meant he was a bit heavier than people expected and Sherlock was consequently forced to step backwards to counterbalance the sudden addition of weight.
He bit his tongue to keep from saying so and instead said: "Okay. But my rule still holds. If any of that triggers your dissonance, you tell me and we stop. Touch is something to enjoy. If it causes you pain, we're doing it wrong. And it isn't in your best interests to damage your brain, either."
John twisted, angling his foot so he could slowly push the piece of paper across the carpet until it was within reach of his free hand.
He disappeared down the hall and into his bedroom. Shaking his head, John pocketed the cheque without even glancing at it and moved to sit on the sofa. Apparently he had accidentally stumbled into a fashion show. He couldn't recall Sherlock ever outright asking for his opinion on his appearance except for a case, in which case it had usually been more along the lines of
A train stood there, looking for all the world as if it was waiting for passengers, but the only people to get on and off were police officers.
A thousand tiny changes to his facial muscles, none of them ordered by his conscious mind. He can feel his face soften, sentiment writing itself into the corners of his eyes, the turn of his nose, the tilt of his lips. He doesn't need a mirror to know what his face looks like, has felt these same changes happen too often, struggled to hide them away too many times to count. (He has counted them anyway.)
"Isn't that the Psy Councillor whose daughter mated to the DarkRiver alpha?" Donovan chimed in. "When was that, 2079? So about two years ago?"
John wanted to tell him that he appreciated the gesture but didn't think the Sainsburys management would, but there was no way of doing so. He sighed and tried to stay as unobtrusive and close to Sherlock as possible.
He told her and watched as they both nodded in clear incomprehension. Obviously neither had heard of Tollers before.
John closed the door to his and Mary's flat behind him with a sigh and leaned against the wood for a moment. Two years and four months after his death, he and Sherlock had just had the most bizarre conversation in the history of their friendship, if you could still call it that.
Sherlock had sounded so bitter, had looked so tired. John had had to force himself not to say anything. Whatever friendship had been between them was clearly gone, that much was clear.
Sherlock turned his head to glare at him. "Keep this up and I'll show you some other things you never knew Psy could do."
He had exactly two seconds to enjoy the heat and taste of Sherlock's mouth before Sherlock apparently finally allowed himself to believe this was happening. As a result, John found himself suddenly shoved backwards half a step until his back hit the shelves behind him. Somehow, Sherlock's hand found the back of his head before it could smack against the shelf. Their mouths didn't get separated for even a second.
Shortly after John had returned from making his call and reclaimed his seat by Sherlock's bed, Mycroft rose.
Tyson shrugged. "Well you know what us cats get like when we have our mind set on a person. I hear the DarkRiver alpha pulled out all the stops to get Sasha Duncan and his packmate regularly broke into a secure Psy facility to watch over Faith Nightstar until she chose to abscond with him."
John shook his head. "I'm reading the Wikipedia article on this goat," he said, nodding towards the straw monstrosity. "It's even more ridiculous than I thought it was going to be."
"Not for long," Sherlock said. "He said he'd find me. I do not expect it to take longer than a day at most."
Banishing those thoughts from his mind, he focused on washing the shampoo out of his hair while he methodically rebuilt all his walls and defenses against sentiment. There would be no more slip-ups, no more close calls or sudden bursts of desperate lust. He would stay calm and controlled and he would not let John see just how out his depth he really was.
John shot to his feet and stumbled forward, a hand over his mouth. The officer didn’t try to stop him this time.
"I'm not brooding," Sherlock said. He hadn't turned around or given any other indication that he had noticed John's approach but he certainly didn't seem surprised at his presence.
"Here, let me," Sherlock said and a gloved hand gently pushed John aside as Sherlock stuck his arm down the back of the sofa and started probing around for the thing he wanted.
Nevertheless, that was exactly what happened and he suddenly found himself on his back on the floor, his wrists pinned on either side of his head and Sherlock's knees bracketing his hips.
"Yes, dear. Sherlock's been quite clear on that point. You didn't tell me he was such a perfectionist."
The changelings around him sucked in a collective breath at this direct challenge and out of the corner of his eye he saw John bury his face in his hands, shaking his head.
"There we are," he said, shoving the door open with his foot and turning to face Sherlock so he could help him take off his coat.
That got Sherlock to look up from his microscope with a puzzled expression. "Of course, John. Besides, Lestrade will be glad to see you."
Sherlock shrugged. "Sentiment. I shoved everything I felt for you against his shields until I managed to break through and overwhelm his mind. The dissonance bought enough time for me to catch my breath and patch up some holes in my shields where he almost got through. And I believe it gave you enough time to come find me. He was ... quite out of it for a long while. So I did it to him again but I didn't have enough power left to really use it to my advantage. By the time you arrived, I was too close to a flame-out to manage any sort of attack."
"The bomb squad is checking the device right now," an officer already on the scene explains to her and Lestrade. "But they radioed and said it had been disabled already."
"So what happened then?" he asked, setting the cup down. "You slipped me whatever it was as an experiment and then what? Did you just make ridiculous suggestions to see if it was having an effect?"
“What do you think?” John asked and for the first time in over an hour, he sounded like himself. Sherlock could’ve hugged the DI for that alone, if he wasn’t glued to the spot for as long as John needed him to be there.
"Don't have to," Sherlock said, shrugging. "I assure you, my memory is good enough to remember this without bothering with notes."
Sherlock hesitated. What to say? John was fastidious about getting all sorts of shots at the appropriate times and had bullied Sherlock into getting his as well. Arguments such as
Layer upon layer of shields, mental viruses it had taken him years to create, a labyrinth of ever-shifting individual shields that left no clear way forward.
"Hours," Emily echoed, gazing at Sherlock's hands. "Hmmm, I can see why. Go on. What else? His scent is all over you, it can't have been just that."
He was well aware of the desperation that had seeped into his voice towards the end of his little speech and could only hope that John wouldn't pick up on it or, if he did, that he would attribute it to the wrong reasons.
"I wonder what could have tired her out like that," Sherlock said, pleasantly surprised by how easily this banter with relative strangers came to him.
Sherlock managed not to forget how to breathe as John brushed past him and waited until John was several steps away before letting out a quiet sigh. That had been dangerously close. His muscles were still tense from his struggle to not sway forward and kiss John senseless right then and there.
Sherlock shook his head. "There are too many possibilities. Perhaps it was an accident. Perhaps we are dealing with a copycat. It is too early to tell. I shall have to wait for Dr Hooper's autopsy report before I can come to any conclusions. However, I would appreciate your medical opinion in the meantime."
"It's not your fault," Sherlock said while Lestrade, from the sounds of it, fished around in the machine, cursing and grumbling.
She ran the card and handed it back with a polite nod. "Welcome, Mr Holmes. Take the lift to the third floor and turn right. It's the fourth door down the hall and you will-"
“God, we’ve led a terrible life,” John noted at one point. “That’s over 30 people who want to see us dead, Sherlock.”
John wasn't a complete moron. Sherlock's cryptic comment about someone being there soon, followed by the rattle of the drinks trolley and Sherlock boxing John in against the wall were hardly difficult hints to figure out and so, when Sherlock kissed him, John was ready to let him for the sake of getting Harold off his back. Lord knew he was always happy to help people get rid of unwanted admirers.
"I'll have a pint," John said after clearing his throat to draw the waiter's attention. Blue eyes swept up and down his body in an appraising gaze before the waiter nodded once and returned his attention back to Sherlock. "One pint and a water coming right up. Do you have any preferences ... for your water?"
He shook his head, staring down at the floor. “I was so afraid they were going to discover my true identity, that the cover story Mycroft had created wasn’t good enough, that someone would realise who I was.”
"Is that why Mycroft isn't here?" he asks, grinning at Sherlock. "Did you threaten him if he dared to show his face here?"
Thank you all for coming along for the ride, for your comments and your support and for the love you have offered for "my" Sally. Nothing has made me happier than hearing you guys say you like her a bit (or a lot) more now than you did before reading this.
For a long moment, Sherlock merely stared at him blankly. Then, ever so slowly, his expression morphed into something else, the corners of his mouth turning down and his chin jutting forward, jaw working as he tried and failed to hold back tears. He looked absolutely wrecked by the suggestion.
A brown, fluffy head appeared in his line of vision and a soft cold snout snuffled at his hands before the dog - god, Sherlock had a dog now - put his head on John's knee and looked up at him with soulful eyes.
"Factors like what?" John asked. "And if you start with your personality, I am going to smack you over the head with something heavy."
suggested getting married and he went along with it. He swears up and down there was nothing mind-altering in there beyond what would erase our memories. Only his didn't work. But there was nothing in there that would have made me susceptible to suggestions or anything. He said he still has the formulas and samples if I want an independent scientist to test it. I believe him. I know it wasn't good but frankly it's hardly out of character for the sort of person he was at the time and I made my peace with that a long time ago. Also, I rather think he's learnt his lesson.”
"Not William," John said, startling Sherlock once again by using his real first name as if he always had. "His mind is a steel trap."
"We appreciate it," Sherlock told him, stepping forward and holing out his hand. "Sherlock Holmes. This is my mate, John Watson."
"I'm surprised you never heard about it," Sherlock said, already typing away at the computer. "It caused a lot of uproar in both Psy and changeling circles."
"Well, as the person inhabiting this body, I can tell you that my heart rate and blood pressure are just fine but are unlikely to stay so if you do any of these tests. And if you come anywhere near me with a needle, you will see just how good my reflexes really are."
Pleasant warmth rushed through him, spreading out from his stomach. Ohh, this was good. And now the good doctor became acutely aware of what it was Sherlock had done to the drink.
After several long moments Sherlock spoke. “I feel I should apologise,” he murmured. “But I can’t seem to remember what for.”
The hot shower helped relax his muscles further, removing the lingering traces of tension. A generous application of shower gel and shampoo were sufficient to overpower the scent of sex and wash away the semen on his skin. He could only hope that John's nose wasn't good enough to detect them anyway.
John frowned. "Is everything all right? You seem a bit..." He waved his hand helplessly, trying to encompass all of Sherlock.
John shook his head. "Mating ceremonies don't have to include rings, though some couples like to use them anyway."
It was difficult to remember that, however, with Sherlock's hands skating across his chest and a warm mouth pressed to his neck. John made a noise that sounded embarrassingly much like: "Gnnnuh."
A lab bench blocked his view and he jumped over it, using one hand to catapult himself across the cluttered surface and sending sheets of paper flying everywhere. He didn't give a damn about the mess, though, all his attention focused on John and the terrible things that could happen to him if he came into contact with any of the substances that had been in the glass dishes and vials. There may have been some unknown new virus or a very well known but dangerous virus in them, not to mention the very real danger posed by shards of glass and sharp metal instruments such as scalpels.
Swallowing back bile, John pressed his palm to Sherlock's back, slowly following the lines of the angry scars.
John shook his head again, turning to look at the clock on the wall and giving Sherlock a pointed look.
John nodded. "I give you that, but I do not appreciate being pounced on in empty corridors or anywhere else, for that matter. You better hope and pray this does not get back to Mary because I'd leave it to you to explain this to her."
Lestrade grimaced, no doubt imagining something gory. "I don't even want to know. Anyway, I don't have a case for you this time. Just thought you might want these."
He blinked rapidly and looked away, trying to stay collected. The last thing they needed was him falling apart.
Thank you all for your comments and kudos, they always make my day! Next week's chapter might be a bit delayed as I'll be traveling on Monday - I'll update as soon as I've got a working internet connection!
There are bits of goose sticking to his face and quite possibly the rest of the living room. He is almost glad he can't see anything.
The other man's eyes had widened slightly at his appearance and he hastily rearranged his features into something a lot less flirty. "Oh, I'm nobody. I was just asking your husband here if you did a lot for charity."
Sherlock groaned, grasped two handfuls of John's t-shirt and rolled onto his back, pulling John with him. That hadn't been what John had intended at all but now that he was here, he found it difficult to remember why.
It should have given him pause, perhaps, a moment's surprise or hesitation. Instead, all he felt was puzzle pieces clicking into place and the world finally making sense.
This exile had been his choice, the second time around even more so. There was no danger of drugs now. He was finally done with that and he wouldn't go back. Impossible to find anyone dealing here, anyway. They only had weed they were growing in their greenhouses next to the tomatoes and everyone pretended not to know.
"First of all, you would not be on this call if you hadn't taken an interest already," Sherlock pointed out. "And secondly, I was talking to your mate. What I want to know can not be answered by you."
It was a picture of John lying in a sunny spot on the sitting room rug, his fur glowing bronze in the sun. His eyes were closed and he looked utterly relaxed and peaceful.
"You said..." Sherlock swallowed. The memory of this hurt. "You said you wanted to be married to someone you loved."
"Well, I might want to go to the loo before forever starts, then," John suggested, wondering if Sherlock could feel how hard his heart was beating all of a sudden. The sheer joy might kill him. "Let me up for a minute?"
John whined and tugged at his lead until Sherlock let it go, allowing him to walk over to the armchair Mrs Forsythe sat on and put his head on her knee.
"Stop that, John," he said, leaning back a little and using both hands to fend John off. "What has gotten into you? I've only been gone for a couple of hours!"
"So what does that mean then?" Sally asked, jabbing her finger towards the messages. "Is the killer a changeling after all? As you said, Psy don't play games."
Sherlock sighed. "Yes. Spent too much psychic energy. I had to keep him out of my mind. He was good. Sneaky. Attacked me unexpectedly so I could not use my Telekinesis to fight him. He was very strong." He paused. "Physically, not so much."
The next day, Sally has only been at home for half an hour when there's a knock on her door. She's got a wriggling Dante in her arms, petting his belly.
Lestrade hurried towards them, looking harried, but stopped before they reached him. John had only seen the other man in his changeling form once but he still got the impression of bristling whiskers.
"I had some free time on my hands this past week," he said quietly. "There was nothing to do all evening."
John sat up to make room for him and then waited expectantly in case Sherlock might be willing to share. After a couple of minutes, he gave up and flopped back down on the sofa. Clearly tonight was one of those rare times where Sherlock was actually hungry enough to finish his meal.
There were few things more flattering than having Sherlock Holmes stare at you with unabashed desire and John couldn't recall any of them.
John grimaced. "Bloody true, that. I'll either have to accept my fate or hope against hope for a position in an A&E somewhere."
John huffed in amusement. It had taken him some time to adjust to his senses, but he had to agree that, looking back, it really was a bit ridiculous.
The very thought made him a bit ill and he fled to the bathroom to buy himself another handful of minutes so he could pull himself together before he had to face John again.
"It wasn't important enough in comparison to everything else," Sherlock explained patiently. "I gained some experience, then turned my attention to other fields of study."
Hell, he didn't even look at Sherlock like a man who was utterly besotted - at least not if he could help it.
He didn't know how long he walked, aimless and thoughtless, through London's dark streets. John's flat was far out in the suburbs and Sherlock was reasonably certain he hadn't gotten into any vehicles but he somehow found himself back at Baker Street just as the sky turned pale blue and pink on the horizon. Sunrise. His feet hurt and he concluded he had walked the entire way back. He had no recollection of most of it, his transport moving on autopilot. He still had his keys, phone and wallet, so it seemed the walk had been uneventful.
Sherlock sighed and glanced away. He really didn't want to have to look John in the eye when he tried to come up with some sort of an explanation.
Sherlock perked up. “Big caliber weapon if it went right through the victim. Interesting.” He did a quick mental calculation of the traffic at this time of day. “We’ll be there in half an hour.”
He bent forward and breathed in, letting the various scents wash over him. Trees and the smell of Lestrade's car, Lestrade himself and something feathery that he associated with Sergeant Donovan and the familiar scent of ... ocelot?
But not every child adapted to Silence as well as the Council wished. Failure to uphold Silence became punishable by forced rehabilitation and in particularly tough cases the 'patient' ends up as little more than an empty shell suited for basic manual labour afterwards.
Sherlock woke several hours later, disoriented but marginally more energetic than he had been. He sat up and reached for his watch, which had its designated spot on the night stand. His hand touched bare wood.
Sherlock shrugged, dropping the topic for the time being and trying to get back to the point he had been about to make. "Lots of colours. 's nice."
He turned to find Sherlock looking at him, a pleased smile on his face. John couldn't help but smile back.
“I was thinking there’s this Chinese place we haven’t been to in a while,” John said. “I feel like watching you fail horribly at predicting fortune cookies.”
As expected, Mrs Munkeld was already waiting for them. She turned out to be a short, smartly dressed woman of slight build and sharp eyes. John could smell the stress on her despite a layer of freshly applied perfume. Losing the head of the company as well as his heir and successor in a matter of hours had clearly not done her any good, but he had not expected anything less.
He forgot to eat again and he knew Mrs Hudson worried. She took to leaving soups and stews and sandwiches in the flat and tutted when she returned to find them untouched.
His question is enough to bring her thoughts back to her investigation and she takes a sip of coffee before replying.
Now that most other noises were gone, John found it much easier to focus on Sherlock's breathing and the steady thud of his heart. It was a bit surreal to know that he could hear it from several feet away, but mostly the sound was simply grounding.
"I'll try," she finds herself saying. "But you and I both know it isn't me he wants looking out for him."
Instead, she thanks him with her most serious Police Sergeant voice, pockets the DVDs and forces herself to obey all traffic laws on her way back to the Yard.
By the time he reached his front door, he had made up his mind to talk to her about it tonight. Yes, it was a bit of an abrupt one-eighty but John wasn't the sort of person to stall once he had made up his mind. That was how he had gotten into this mess in the first place, with his hasty proposal, fuelled by hurt feelings. That wasn't a proper basis for a marriage and he was going to fix that.
Mary smiled at his words and turned her hand to lace their fingers together. "Well, so long as we all know that..."
He found himself thinking so quite often. Usually, it was in an attempt to make himself believe it, but every now and then he caught himself truly thinking it and he wasn't sure how he felt about that. Perhaps it was a sign he was finally healing, finally closing that gaping wound on his soul that had been his constant companion for the past three years.
There was a longer pause, longer than Sherlock would have expected. John wasn't stupid and also a figment of his imagination, he shouldn't need this long to respond.
Sherlock breathed and then John's hand was there, slick with lube already warmed to his skin and Sherlock gasped at his touch, letting his head fall back into the pillow.
"It's the most stunning thing I've ever heard," John said. "Except perhaps you saying you love me. Nothing sounds better than that."
I hope you enjoyed this one - and I assume you did, if you read this far - and I also hope I will see you again for the next adventure I'm sending these two idiots on. I'm not even close to finished writing all the stories in my head.
" John repeated, half surprised and half furious. "We got married! And I don't recall a single second of that. No vows, no celebration, no rings. So you can imagine my surprise when the lady at the registrar's office showed me a marriage certificate with both our names on it! Do you have anything at all to say about that?"
"Hm? Fine, sorry, got distracted." She smiles at Mrs Hudson. "So, does Sherlock know you're preparing a feast?"
Sally arrives at home to find Mrs Hudson laughing like a madwoman, laughing so hard she's almost crying. When Sally manages to get her to explain why, she is hard-pressed to start laughing herself.
They turned into Baker Street and soon reached their front door. Sherlock unlocked it quietly and ushered John inside. Mrs Hudson's lights were already off and so was the TV. "Quiet now, we don't want to wake her."
She grinned. "I didn't know you had parents. Always half suspected you crash-landed your UFO here by accident."
"Yes," Sherlock said calmly. "I talked John into touching me. He's a doctor and I warned him of the likely repercussions. But I also explained to him that a controlled environment in which I could get used to being touched would be infinitely preferable to someone surprising me somewhere out in the open, with no warning or possible way to defend myself."
Sherlock lowered his gaze, unable to look John in the eye. "I don't know. All my arguments for stopping our experiment, for keeping our distance, are still valid. Even more so, actually. If the Council ever finds out, you will be killed and I will be rehabilitated. It will be done as a warning to others and they will make it as brutal as they possibly can."
"And I was so stupid," he continued. "After you died and I met Mary, I clung to her like a drowning person clings to a piece of driftwood. She was all that kept me going. So when you came back, it was a shock. And it was terrifying. What if you disappeared again? What if you left me behind again? I knew I couldn't do it again. I told you the other day and I meant it:
"I don't- oh. Clever." John groaned. "You shouldn't try and make jokes like that, Sherlock. Someone might actually get a wrong impression and think you're funny."
John listened with interest as they discussed people they had known and events that had happened long before he had become a part of their lives. Neither Mrs Hudson nor Sherlock had ever really talked about how they had met, but from what little he knew about it, they had never lost touch afterwards for whatever reason.
John sighed and yawned. "Gosh, it's gone 2am. Come on, you need to sleep, rest that big brain of yours. I really don't want you to get brain damage."
John laughed. "It's not quite so fun when you have to constantly re-buy your clothes. Or when you accidentally wear your favourite t-shirt and don't bother to take it off before."
Sherlock came to some undetermined time later. There was something soft underneath him and he seemed to be covered by a blanket.
He sighed and slumped against Sherlock, letting his head rest on his friend’s shoulder. “This is perfect, do you know? I can’t imagine a better place to be than right here with you.”
Sherlock watched as Mary's face crumbled with rage at his blatant insults and the very deliberate claim he had laid on John and Rosie. She had always been possessive - it hadn't been difficult to come up with a way to anger her. Anger made her stupid, made her act too soon without considering the consequences. He let his gaze slide from her face off to the side, as if glancing at something behind her shoulder, and let a hint of relief flicker across his face.
"At least he shaved," he says, apparently to no one in particular. "Perhaps that may be considered progress."
"No, he never played, not that I know of. Too much chance involved, or so he said. He thought luck was going to find him if he was meant to have any." She shook her head, clearly not one to believe in that kind of thing. "I always told him luck is something you make for yourself, but he wouldn't listen."
It was immensely satisfying to see the hair on Sherlock's neck stand on end. John found that even his cat hardly minded not being allowed to touch - this game was fun in different ways.
To her endless surprise, Sherlock treats Mary like a, well, like a friend. There is no other word for it. They tease each other, they make jokes at John's expense. Mary laughs at Sherlock about something involving a fake moustache and doesn't seem to notice the tight expression flittering across John's face.
Greg nodded. "Yeah, of course, whatever you like. We've spoken to everyone in these pictures. At this point, I'm afraid there isn't much more we can do, frankly. You know what it's like when a case drags on for too long. The trail grows cold."
Sherlock did catch a couple of hours of sleep after Mrs Hudson finally got up around midnight and all but ordered him to stop. “Time to go to bed, young man.”
By morning, the storm had passed and pale golden sunlight filtered into the room through the gap in the curtains. John woke slowly, surprised to find he had fallen asleep at all.
Sherlock didn't dare protest - the look on John's face and his tone of voice both suggested that he was entirely serious. And who knew - perhaps he was right. Sherlock didn't know what his smile looked like - he had barely learned how a real smile worked at all - so if John thought it was beautiful, who was he to argue? He would not deny John this enjoyment.
Sherlock shot him a surprised look, which was to be expected after their earlier conversation about John not wanting strangers in their flat. Yet he nodded without hesitation. "If you trust us enough to come with us, we would be safe in our flat," he told the Psy.
Carried by his own velocity, John rolled over him, accidentally slamming the man's head against the ground and knocking him out before his own body came to a stop in a muddy puddle.
Sherlock waited for a wince or any other reaction on John’s part to the casual mention of children so soon after the idea of having any had been ripped away from him twice over, but there was nothing. He breathed out. “It’s been a while since I’ve been to Edinburgh,” he volunteered. “I must have missed that one.”
"You do realise that we have a perfectly acceptable assortment of tennis balls back at the flat, do you?" Sherlock inquired.
When the scientists started shouting in excitement and rushing about the place, he was only distantly aware of it.
They made it to Kings Cross in plenty of time for a coffee and still-warm croissants before boarding their train. It was an early one during the week and not too many people seemed keen on going to Edinburgh at this particular time. John frankly couldn’t understand why. London was dreadful in this heat. At least the train had air conditioning.
John squeezed his eyes closed. He could barely hear Sherlock over the roaring in his ears but his friend continued speaking anyway, in a terrible matter-of-fact tone. “Of course whips are very narrow and cut into the skin, so it’s easier to leave visible marks that way. The same can’t be said about a-” his voice gave out for a moment, which was almost worse than the matter-of-fact tone he tried so hard to keep up “-a lead pipe. Too blunt, it would only leave deep-tissue bruising and broken bones if wielded with enough force.”
"Of course not. But we know many of them. The loud ones, the trouble-makers, the alphas and their top soldiers. If we don't know someone, it's because they stayed under the radar, led a quiet life."
Sherlock did get his massage, though he insisted on working on John’s shoulder first this time. It was as if the weight of the world had been lifted off his own shoulders. They were finally, finally, on the same page, knowing precisely where they stood with one another. Coupled with the remembered intimacy from this morning, it lent a new meaning to every touch he bestowed on John’s skin, every dig of his thumbs and roll of his palms against stubborn muscle, every soft moan from John’s mouth.
"Slow down," John murmured against his mouth and Sherlock could feel him smile. "We've got all the time in the world."
“Three more steps, then you reach the ticket checking machine. The exit is five more steps behind it. Are you meeting up with a friend?
The other man is scratching his head nervously and interrupts Sherlock’s thoughts. Sherlock stares at him in wonder. It is most unusual that someone wants to voluntarily communicate with a person on the street.

The potion is still there. Sherlock checks it, but everything appears to be untouched. The next full moon will only be in a month, but it is better to stay prepared. The potions masters have come a long way in discovering the best potion, and the new version is certainly improved. Sherlock does not turn into a werewolf — harmless or not — if he takes the potion, so he can continue working, but it still causes terrible cramps, headaches, sometimes nausea and leaves him completely battered. Sherlock still needs to add the last ingredients, but that has to wait till one day before the full moon, otherwise it will not work.
Sherlock had met many people in his thirty-six years, and most of them were a bit not good. There were his parents, his smart mother and his quiet dad, both very loving, but ultimately not understanding him. There was
The students clap happily when they hear the news, and Sherlock does not miss a few appreciating looks from the older students into Watson’s direction. He is not the only one who has noticed how good the new teacher looks.
They kept cuddling until the come has dried all over them. John got up and cleaned them both with a wet flannel.
He looked angrily up from his book, some ridiculously long Winston Churchill biography, and hissed at him: “For goddess sake, Sherlock! Behave some, would you?
John grunted and stood up. He swiftly lifted Sherlock’s thin body into his arms and carried him to their bedroom. To Sherlock’s surprise he didn’t throw him on it like the last time, but gently lay him down on top of it. His head was cushioned by a pillow, and they both looked at each other for a moment.
Sherlock thinks, defeated, and just gives up any form of politeness and shoves himself through, until his back meets the wall of the station. John will come back for him any minute, he just has to wait-
. Molly hangs the sign announcing the Trivia Game to the door, and the three are left waiting for any volunteers.
Sherlock has listened to Santa’s long speech, trying not to let his eyes drop. He is terribly thirsty and getting tired, although his shivers are growing violent.
The sky outside is already dark when the door joining the bathroom and the bedroom opens. John shuffled to the bed, holding Sherlock, who is wrapped in his favourite pyjama. John carefully puts him, then lies down next to his sleeping partner. He spreads the blanket over them both.
The stupidest of the cousin (Sherlock never bothered to learn his name) yells and the others laugh in agreement. Someone gives Sir Walter a rusty knife that still has blood spots on it, and the knight pulls and cuts brutally at Sherlock‘s dark curls.
Just as Sherlock is thinking this, a cousin (?) of his new husband is jumping up and throwing his huge glass against the wall, which only just misses the singer. The wedding guests celebrate in delight. Sherlock hides his shaking hands under the wooden table and holds his head down. He is glad for the small mercy that his facial expression is still hidden behind the veil they forced him to wear.
John begs. The doctor is tethered with ropes to one of the black, hard kitchen chairs. John is furiously fighting against the strain, kicking his legs. So far, without success.
Sherlock never comes back, and soon John has to get out of the water. His toes and fingers are frozen, but his heart is far heavier.
John opened his mouth and closed it three times, his wide eyes staring at the figure that was huddled on the ground, only wearing dirty, stained clothes and a half-shaved head.
John inquires and clasps Sherlock’s hand into his. Memory loss is another signal for a concussion and John wants to check thoroughly.
In the store, Sherlock has proven himself to be quite the worthy employee. Upon seeing a customer, he instantly knows what the person is searching for, thanks to his helpful deductions. He is taller than the women, with dark curls roaming wildly on his head. Outdoors, he likes to wear a long coat, a clothing item that once belonged to Mrs. Hudson, and Sherlock would never admit how much he loves the item. Indoors, he prefers black trousers, sneakers and sharp shirts, basically all the dark and purple stuff he finds at cheap stores and charity stores.
Molly was wiping a tear from her eyes now. She and Greg looked ready to attend a funeral, not a wedding. At least they were here, not like Mike and Harry who didn’t even bother to write him a card
Sherlock would love to explain it for him, but his shift has not ended yet, and he does not want to disappoint Mrs. Hudson (although, she would probably excuse it — she keeps telling him to start dating).
The two young men focus back on their game. John finally shows him the rest of his island and most importantly the museum.
“Yes, I am just… overwhelmed." Sherlock stops to gesticulate at the scene. " You are here, and I love you so much.
John exclaims happily on the last weekend in September, gesticulating to the clear sky. The two teachers have carried all the spare brooms to their tent (Sherlock did carry the most brooms, since John still has only one arm free), and are now waiting for the participants to arrive.
“Where are we going?” Sherlock mumbled into John’s shoulder as they made their way to that damned car of theirs. John hated driving in the city and finding a parking spot was a fucking nightmare, but Mary had insisted she needed one. John didn’t feel an ounce of regret when he packed them both into her vehicle. Mary deserved to have her car kidnapped.
Sherlock asks, confused. Surely John was always surrounded by a groupie of supporters and would not be interested in meeting Sherlock.
It is the mysterious Professor Watson, who then actually winks at him. Sherlock cannot remember when someone last did that towards him, so he carefully winks back. Watson chuckles, a lovely and low sound that makes Sherlock ache to hear his voice. It lights up Watson’s whole face.
Surely, the detective is going to break any day now. He spends most of his days laying face-down on the couch. John can hear his stomach grumbling from the bathroom.
A cheeky voice says behind Sherlock’s back, and the young detective jumps around. A beaming John Watson is standing finally directly in front of him, wearing a green uniform that makes him look unforgettably sexy.
Sherlock’s cock was still soft and for John absolutely perfect, though he was a bit more lean than John’s. The slave observed John as well, and the gladiator looked down at himself. He was tanned because of his outdoor work. He had well-built muscles on his arms, legs and stomach. John had lots of reason to be proud of his body. His cock was around a nest of golden hair and proudly erect.
He screams, and the healing image evaporates, and it is only his quivering body and Moriarty’s grimace, as the other student is blown away by a different curse from a different wizard. Moriarty is thrown deep into the black water. A furious John Watson is marching towards his fallen boyfriend, wand still raised, ready to blow the whole place away.
Old Marley was definitely dead. There was no doubt about that. He had been dead for nearly two years now.
Gregory slumped, defeated. “I see that my presence is not wanted here. Nevertheless, I will keep my cheery spirit, and wish you a merry Christmas!
Sherlock nods. Neither of them want to give up the work, at least not at this time in their lives, and John is right: there is no point to worry about something that did not happen.
Sherlock wonders if he is a bad teacher. The lesson material does not come easy to him, his ideas are often too difficult for the learners. He is never sure if he reacted right in a situation or not or if he has even made it worse.
were discovered in London, his and John’s university closed, and soon after, they left their dorms and travelled back to their childhood homes in the country.
John sighs, then shoves his now empty plate aside. Sherlock does the same, and the main courses are switched with desert. The rest of the feast is spent in silence until
John shouts and lifts Sherlock even higher. Sherlock feels double elevated, both by the height and John’s fantastic mood. He wraps his arms around John’s shoulders.
He doesn’t really hate it, he just wants to keep one part of his life somewhat independent. He didn’t inherit any money from his parents, and he donated all of Mary’s dubious funds (it felt wrong to keep it).
John gulps. This is difficult. “I want you to love this country as much as I do. You certainly had a bad start here, but I promise it will get better. I want you to be happy, when we rule side by side.
, Gregor, grinned at him when John went back to the chambers. He had met Gregor two years ago, when he returned from the war in Spain. The man had made John an offer he couldn't refuse, and so he ended up in the arena.
“Nah. On second thought, I prefer to see you naked. These shirt buttons are waiting to be ripped apart. Forget the werewolf thing, this purple shirt should be illegal.
Sherlock shouts, drops the poster and nearly the cactus, before John’s arms envelope (Jesus, his new muscles!) him and rip him right off his feet, like he has done since school. Christ, Sherlock loves this man so much.
Well, Sherlock can berate him for distracting him after he wins. Sherlock dashes off to the right. He quickly remembers the layout of the house he saw outside and decides to head off further to the right, except… There is no way. In his haste, Sherlock runs directly into a mirror and is very happy that no one is there to witness it. He rubs his nose for a moment, then stretches his arms out and slowly navigates himself through the labyrinth. Twice more, he nearly collides again with a mirror.
, shouted John angrily. She had every right to be upset with him. Manipulating Sherlock and emotionally abusing him was not something he would allow to continue.
John first realized his dog tags were missing when he unpacked his boxes in his new, mouldy small flat in a dingy corner in London. He always kept the tags in a former shoe box with some other military memorial stuff, including pictures. He didn’t notice it when he packed them in 221b. John had been so feverish to get away and finally move out that he just threw all of his things into boxes without any care.
John gesticulates to Sherlock’s ear, and Sherlock froze. He completely forgot about the flower experiment!
Actually, that is not the whole truth. While his dealer — Billy Wiggins — was choking to death, someone had snug up on Sherlock. Not someone, more like something. A werewolf. It had bitten Sherlock in his arm, while the young man was helplessly drugged. He had made himself vulnerable to be attacked. When Sherlock found the bleeding bite mark on his arm, he knew staying on the streets with an addiction was too dangerous for any innocent people around him. So, he called Mycroft in his never-ending shame, and they made an agreement. Sherlock stays sober, and Mycroft will help him start a new life. Their deal works.
Nearly one hour later (stupid London traffic), they reach John’s dorm room. Thankfully, his roommate has never arrived and so John has the room all for himself. He was never more thankful for the privacy.
They do not receive a response, but Sherlock knows that his husbands means serious business. The couple walk through the hallway to their wing, with John still hugging Sherlock.
god, John wanted him as well. The lust was pooling in his stomach. Inexplicably, he also felt a surge of protectiveness for the younger man. It can't be easy to be sold like a pig for slaughter, but as a rule John never wondered about the emotions of a slave. It was too depressing, and why should John, a free man, care? Nevertheless, he must own this slave!
Except he wasn’t. It took him 18 months, and every step further away from London, from Baker Street, from Scotland Yard, from home, from John Watson was pure agony.

with their eight legs and black eyes. A herd of white unicorns, hunted by wizards for their powerful blood. The centaurs with their long beards, arrows and their scary predictions for the future. Some say a vampire lives in the darkest area of the forest as well, waiting for their next victim. Another popular theory are the werewolves, who are rumoured to be the source of the howling in some nights. Sherlock is not so sure of that. If there were any other werewolves, he would have known.

Sherlock handed him the money he got from his mom. The boy’s eyes stayed for a second on his arse, his face was unreadable.
Sherlock and John walk around the field, watching the kids. Most of them throw the ball around with ease. Only a smaller Slytherin, Quentin, lets the ball drop.
There comes the next train, and now there are new people there, fighting to reach the door, and more people getting off the train.
Moriarty is standing above him, pointing his wand repeatedly at him. And Sherlock screams, every time. His voice is getting horse, his limbs lose their feelings, he has bitten through his tongue and everything hurts.
Sherlock waits with bated breath. Not his best deductions, certainly, but maybe Watson will not be angry.
The sun has already set and the moon has appeared over the majestic school building. It is surprisingly cold for the beginning of September. The harsh wind blows leaves through the fighting branches of the
See? We are not so different any more, you and I. We are both scary tales adults tell their children to stay away from.
Sherlock answers confidently, although his voice slurs far more than he would have liked. The cold water did not achieve much, he is still standing unsteadily.
Sherlock stomps his feet: “Fine! Now that you’re going to school, you will find much better friends than I am!
“Do you not remember this place? It’s the orphanage, where they delivered you after your parents died.
John bends and scoops Sherlock up into his arms. Sherlock hides his face in John’s neck: “This is a terrible tradition.
someone working at St. Mungo’s, David Something. Multiple times, in fact. I was furious and I moved out.
John couldn’t believe that he was really going to be the first — and possibly only! — to touch this man.
waist was surprisingly slim for a man, and John could count every one of his ribs. There was fat blue bruise on his stomach, and fingerprints were clearly visible on his hip where someone must have grabbed him. The mental image of a slave handler violating what John considered as his property made him clench his fist.
Really? John was surprised. He didn’t want to make friends. He didn’t want people to mourn him after his inevitable death, and he didn’t trust anyone, not after that arrow landed in his shoulder.
Sherlock stops himself on the moving staircases. Why exactly would he care about whether he looks good or not? John is a fellow professor, his colleague. Maybe he could be a… friend.
A man next to John walked up on the stage, and after a quick look for permission from the seller, he tugged the loose fabric away. The young slave was now standing completely naked, and the sight was breathtaking. John felt his cock waking up and arranged his clothing over it to hide his growing member. This hadn’t happen to him in public since he was a boy, and he felt a bit awkward.
John’s rooms is very comfortable, with two seats standing next to the burning fireplace. His broom is hanging over the fireplace, his desks is full of essays, and he has red curtains, no doubt as a reminder of the
“Sherlock is absolutely miserable and thinks you already asked someone else! Get your act together, Watson!
Mary had waited another three days before leaving the fake belly on her bed, send Sherlock a message from John’s phone (the soldier should have been more careful with that) and left the flat through the bathroom window. Her husband was asleep on the couch in their living room, again unable to be in her presence.
Sherlock was just beginning to ask himself if a walk through the mud and rain without an umbrella was preferable to this, when the bell finally ringed.
John says, struggling through every word, his feet swaying from one to the other. “I will not allow it.
Sherlock says and nuzzles his head deeper into John’s shoulder. John follows his plea and starts caressing his hair.
Santa chides him, but the words are like coming through a long tunnel for Sherlock. He can’t figure their meaning out.
sneered: “I have a lot of pressure on my back, soon I will join my father’s business and make more money than you all together.
observed every glimpse of his lost younger brother as time passed. John was always right next to him, growing into a strong boy despite the lack of nutritional food. Sherlock grew too, but he always stayed dangerously skinny.
Today is the twenty-third of December, and the crowd at Baker Street is busy with finishing their chores before the stressful holidays. Hundreds of people have walked by him, holding their bags in one hand and dragging their screaming children behind them with the other. Even fewer people than usual have acknowledged Sherlock and his music, and therefore he has ended up with fewer coins than normal in his violin bag.
He was dangling from the ceiling, swaying hence and forth. His hands fought against the cuffs, straining to rip the noose from his neck. His feet were dancing in the air. It must look horrible. It felt like someone had stuck a hot iron into multiple parts of his body. John would only find another body. There would be a free room at 221b Baker Street. Lestrade would (unsuccessfully) try to find his murderer, Mrs Hudson would cry and Molly would cut his body open. John would be alone, again. No child, no wife, no Sherlock. He would have failed him, again and again and again.
. The streets of Rome were full of people celebrating the Emperor, so John had to tread carefully, but together they managed.
“Maybe someday, but until then I’m gonna carry you through the snow masses. Like they do with the Hobbits!
It was clear that this Moriarty figure, an aristocrat, thought John below him, but the gladiator was undeterred.
“I did not earn any more money, and my parents had cut off their support for me. I could not pay rent and soon, I was living on the streets. One day, my most frequented dealer used too much, and he chocked on his own vomit while I was laying next to him.
“If you become my flatmate, you should know that I sometimes go days without speaking and that I play the violin. It helps me think. Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.
If it was noisy before, now, the classroom explodes with flying accusations, Oliver scrambling for his own wand and an exhausted teacher who watches the chaos with resignation.
“But father, think of your business! You built it all up yourself, and it’s still running successful!
It was like an explosion. Sherlock tasted so sweet, a bit of the wine, but also like adventure, a promise of a far away land John had never set foot into. John sucked Sherlock’s bottom lip into his mouth. The brunette gasped and arched, and the gladiator could feel the gained pleasure pooling directly to his groin. John pressed the younger man’s body deeper into the mattress and laid himself on top of him. Sherlock groaned, if in pain or pleasure, John wasn’t sure.
The face had a certain glow about it, like a street lamp. It didn’t look furious or hateful, but rather how he always used to look at
(John had held him the whole night. He had listened to his tears and his muffled cries. He had listened to his grief and to his anger. He had rocked him back and forth. For eight hours they had shared this small hospital bed and since then the bed in Baker Street.)
Molly sits down on their client chair in front of him, holding a glass of wine. She is wearing a huge red jumper, and Sherlock makes a mental note to ask her sometime where she bought it. John mentioned over Christmas that he wants to wear his jumpers again, and Sherlock wants to buy him a few new ones.
“And leaving me depressed in London wasn’t dangerous enough? Sherlock, I was fucking depressed. And some rogue criminal decided to date me too.”
The doctor ignored him and turned back to his wife, who had tears of joy in his eyes. She looked like she couldn’t believe her luck. Sherlock meanwhile was sobbing, curled into himself on the carpet like he was trying to shield himself from the brutal blow that were John Watson’s words.
John already started with the first and biggest snow globe. Sherlock jumps to assist him, and together they roll the globe around the snow, making it bigger and bigger.
“The age thing was a lucky guess, you looked a bit older than me. Of course, you were a soldier at that age and with that muscles. You were using your right hand predominantly during the auction, held your left arm stiffly, your hand was shaking, but when the other buyer talked to you it was perfectly calm and you used it for the leash. So you were wounded in action and are now retired. As a civilian you wouldn’t need so many weapons, so maybe you are a guard or something, but that would be too boring for you, you need the action, so you became a gladiator and joined the arena. You probably have a death wish. The
There is no escape, and John feels very sorry for all the employees who have to survive it for eight hours every day. This week they started playing some Christmas songs in the waiting room of the clinic as well. John doesn’t mind the songs, but this is just too much.
noticed that they were somehow invisible to everyone else. The ground was dirty and most of the furniture was broken. There were next to no toys, only some children were huddled together in the corner. They climbed uneven stairs to the first floor and approached a single door.
John answers, kicks the door open and carefully carries him over the threshold. He throws his new husband on the bed. Sherlock rolls himself on his back, spreads his impossible long legs and aches his neck. Their eyes meet, and John feels the heat in their gaze directly
Suddenly, there is the loudest cheer so far, and it does not stop. Sherlock can hear everyone standing up, but he decides to stay seated since it won’t make a difference anyway.
He tells him slowly, and presses a kiss on Sherlock’s curly head. Tomorrow, he can finally kiss his mouth.
Sherlock gulped, the humiliation burning a deep hole. Is Mary right about John? Suddenly Sherlock wasn’t so sure anymore. Tears were gathering in his eyes, and he wished they were there because of the heat from the flames.
John laughed. Sherlock loved to make him produce these adorable giggling sounds. It gave him a glowing feeling all over.
“Yes, I’m just… taking it all in.” Sherlock said, took a deep breath, and then they walked slowly up to Lestrade’s door.
was, as always, full of people. Slaves were lined up on platforms, most of them naked, bound to stakes. Groups of people stood around them, listening to the eager seller who praised the man’s or woman’s best attributes. The sun was burning down on them and the heat was stifling. John wondered if his parents left the north because of the bad weather. Rain was seldom seen in Rome.
"I want you to listen to me very closely now, because I am going to tell you what someone should have told you a long time ago."
practices for the students who do not make it into the official house teams. Students at Hogwarts really need more exercise, and I think it is unfair that only seven players in every house get to play it.
, which desperately needs new customers), but secretly hopes John will not bring a friend, and most definitely not a girlfriend or boyfriend.
Lestrade was standing up, his knees shaking. He was able to hear voices from the next room. One of them sounded like John’s. Was he confronting
Sherlock breathes out. It all sounds perfectly logical when John explains it, but it does not let Sherlock forget his anxiety over the events of this evening.
“Remember what you said to me, on our first shared evening at Hogwarts? I am not haunted by danger, I miss it. Together with you, every day is different from the last, because you brought the thrill back into my life. I will not let a stupid bite deter me from keeping you for the rest of our lives.
The handsome (and now also caring!) man explains. He takes Sherlock’s red hand into his and opens the tab.
She whispered, clutching a mug of cold tea. “We promised each other to stay together, to go through the hard times, through illness and death, but I never expected anything like this.
were numerous people he met on the streets, when he was homeless and constantly drugged. Sometimes kind, sometimes helpful, often pushy and annoying, leering at him, trying to touch him.

is working as Mycroft’s guard, as if Mycroft could not perfectly defend himself. As the de facto prime minister, he is entitled to any security measures he needs, but Sherlock suspects Mycroft keeps
The noise was probably coming from the pipes, and although Mary had reassured him that it was probably nothing, he still wanted to check, just to be sure. It wouldn’t be good to wake up someday with burst pipes and a flooded house.
John was intrigued. After Spartacus and seventy other slaves had run away, the sellers were much more careful with rebellious slaves.
John helps him up and throws his coat around Sherlock’s ruined body. Sherlock does not dare look at him through the Scotch Bridle. What must John think of him, completely falling apart without his husband by his side.
… Some of Santa’s words are indeed true. Sherlock has caused him great pain. He has thrown him into Moriarty’s plan, betrayed his trust by jumping from a roof in front of him and then being dead for two years, letting John marry Mary
and her red-haired boyfriend, having fun on their secret night date. Holding hands and kissing outside in the snow. A romantic, if reckless date.
“Don’t give up too fast on our Sherlock here! He is a sweet child, and will surely bring happiness into your house.
of his rival. The man crashed to his knees, gasping, and when John was finally over him, he just had to punch the trident out of his hand and put his
A voice exclaims, and a young man, maybe two or three years older than him, with blond hair and a green jacket, jumps up and catches the note before it disappears in the streets of London forever. The young man approaches him and hands over the blue note to a gaping Sherlock.
The two smiled at each other. They hold hand until the car stops at a large, unassuming building in the east of London.

There is of course also a small corner for notebooks, bookmarks, postcards and totes bags.
, but he always had an open ear for them. Julia preferred their huge garden, and on warm summer nights they had invited dozens of guests and ate until their stomachs were full.
Oh god, Sherlock. The brawny kid he had met when the detective was just 22, high on drugs, living on the streets. Always thin, always pale, the ridiculous curls much shorter than but with the same hungry look in his eyes. He brought him to hospital, then visited him in rehab, then gave him the first case files. They had become acquaintances, then colleagues, then friends. He was one of the three people that Sherlock had sacrificed two years of his life for. The moment John limped into their life was the start of Sherlock progressing into a better person, a good man.
Gregory’s wife asked. He shook his head. “Unfortunately not, he claimed the counting-office is too busy and Old Marley needs his assistance.

had lived in the house since both his parents died, and he preferred it that way. After a long day at work, where everyone was determined to annoy him, there was nothing better to finally spend the evening alone.
Molly suggests, and there is another wave of dread. Sherlock never expected that there would be so many events he and John were expected at.
John’s heart stopped for a second. Sherlock looked white as a sheet, his eyes rolling to left and right. He was biting his lip and seemed ready to throw up.
Smith does not stop. Sherlock’s shoulders shake, his knees try to kick out, his arms are flailing against the restraints. Smith does not stop, and Sherlock is falling unconscious.
What direction did he come from? The mirrors are too confusing. He decides to move to the left, but he can not go very far there either. Right, it is just a stupid game. Nobody ever gets seriously lost in this kind of labyrinths, at some point someone is going to help him. He will have lost their game and Mycroft will never let him forget this tragedy, but there is no way to panic.
John was humming silently to himself, it sounded like a nursery song. He probably sings it to his daughter while he makes her ready for bedtime.
"I have another thing in mind I could use him for!" , bawled a dark haired man, and the others hooted.
John reassures him and directs him further into the woods. Behind them is the big farm of the Holmes, where their guests are still celebrating the marriage between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. They are still young, Sherlock not even twenty, and they already showed their talents. John is a brilliant sharp shooter and feared in battle with his axe, and Sherlock is able to read the stars like no one else and can manoeuvre their long ship through every storm. The life of Vikings is hard, but they had a good harvest and a successful journey to the
“Sherlock here has stolen top secret government information and brought it to me, who own the British press. Big brother will not be happy about that, correct? And poor pregnant Mary
While staring at the burning coal, he could have sworn that he saw glimpses again of Old Marley’s face, so vivid as if he was staring directly at him.
Don’t be stupid. You are my best friend, of course I will shock spiders for you, doesn’t matter who pays me.
What they didn’t say: “Stonehenge is a few stones stapled on top of each other. It’s going to be cold, rainy and dark. You will share a room with your brother. We are sleeping just one door away.
John is standing before him, with the giggling Rosie in his arms. They greet each other and John puts Rosie down on the carpet. Then he sits down in his red chair, puts his hands together and looks at him.
shared the class, so naturally Sherlock and John had huddled together in the last row, silently discussing the three curses.
Next, John storms up the endless stairs, wrestling his gun out of his trousers while running. The first two doors are just a closet and a bathroom. The third door is closed, but after hearing another scream by Sherlock a
She chirps and plunges a needle in his forearm. Sherlock grits his teeth in pain, but doesn’t move so the needle won’t break. His vision soon begins to waiver while the car is moving along the main road. Where to?
Against the Dark Arts teacher, they prefer professors with experiences in fighting against the dark arts. You probably only just got the job, since I did not see you at any of the teacher conferences. The position was cursed for years, with no one staying longer than one year, until Mr. Potter came in. Since he is gone now, I imagine other possible applicants remain cautious. Maybe you know Potter from your shared experiences fighting against the Dark Arts, and he recommended you to the headmistress. The way you hold yourself is very calm, respectful and disciplined, it practically screams military training. Then of course your injury. Not many jobs involve being cursed that badly.
A bathtub is a wonderful place to be, whether it is on a quiet Sunday evening or after a long, hard day at work. It can be a place of relaxation, with soft music in the background, or a place of heavy kissing and petting.
, the seven-year older brother immediately lifted his head at his Grandmas question and now listens with a dark expression.
He gasps and only just manages to not drop the kettle. The medical student is suddenly behind the counter and quickly leads Sherlock to the basin.
The bus is crowded as well, and some 14 year old shout over the sound of their phones at each other. John just wants to go home.
John growls, and shots another arrow just for good measures up in the dark. The large thing crashes through the branches and lands in front of Sherlock’s feet, its legs dangling up.
The first train ride to Hogwarts, where John Watson quite involuntarily entered Sherlock Holmes cabin, and then decided to never leave.
Watson answers, and the two giggle together. Sherlock picks up a piece of duck and eats it to satisfy the doctor.
The toilet has only two stalls and the smell of cheap cleaner reminds Sherlock of a hospital. He starts throwing water into his face and rubs his eyes, hoping that it will make him feel more awake. If he wants to go through with his by seducing John into a kiss at home, he needs to be a bit more functioning. Functioning in this case means that he is able to climb the stairs on his own, an ability which Sherlock is not so sure of at the moment.
“What if something happened to you in the alley, what if the thief had a knife or a gun or you fell down
John muffles into Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock feels like his heart is going to explode any minute. To his terror, he feels tears leaking from his treacherous eyes. He quickly closes them, but John has already noticed. John notices everything.
As promised, the bell rang again and Sherlock was none the wiser. He had to do a little sprint to overtake his dad who was on the way to the door, and so he ended up a
Sherlock kicks the Clown in his stomach, and this seems to surprise him so much that Sherlock can force himself around him and run down the hallway. He hears more laughter, more steps, but a light is growing at the end of the hall, and Sherlock just runs faster and faster…
jumped up from the bed: “I don’t have friends! And I don’t need you or anyone else to berate me over my choices.
His fingers wandered to the small fabric, and he ripped it away. The slave was now completely naked, and John could enjoy the view. The gladiator settled in the space between Sherlock’s legs and opened his own tunica. It gathered around his midsection, and he had to get up to kick it away. He was now standing in front of the bed, and the two men studied each other.
Sherlock is hurrying down the stairs to his potion classroom. He can hear the first graders chatting happily, and Sherlock reminds himself to have a confident voice, stand straight and smile, but not too much so the students won’t get cocky. Being a teacher resembles being an actor, only you are on stage not for two or three hours, but all the time, every day. It is exhausting of course, but Sherlock accepts the challenge and tries to make something good out of it.
Sherlock spells it out, bitterly. The scene feels like a lifetime away. Both ruined young man sharing a few old blankets, drugged out of their minds in an abandoned warehouse with holes in the ceiling.
Sherlock lets out a groan when he sees the announcement on the monitor hanging above their heads that the plane will be delayed for another twenty minutes. How wonderful. His attention wanders back to his fellow impatient comrades, and he notices that all of them have either a poster with a heartfelt message, a bunch of flowers or a bear toy holding a heart with them. Or all of these things at once.
"Christ.“ He mumbled, then kissed Sherlock hungrily. „I really want to see you now when you are only wearing the ring.“
Her hand jumps forward and she grabs his forearm. Her large glasses are directly in front of his face: “I saw danger for you in my teacup today, Holmes. Grave danger is coming for you soon!
Sherlock feels like an ice bucket was dropped on him. John is waiting patiently, not making any move, waiting for Sherlock to act. All Sherlock can think of though is the ruined kiss weeks ago, where the drunken John stumbled on him. John never remembered.
“When you jumped from that roof, you destroyed me. You did worse to me than Afghanistan ever could. I was more depressed than after I came back from the army, I was suicidal, I was done with London, with my life, with the world, and all because of
Smith releases the bag from him, and Sherlock pushes precious oxygen into his mouth. Through his desperate gasps, he hears John shouting at Smith. Watching Sherlock being slowly asphyxiated must be a gruesome sight, with Sherlock’s open mouth pressed against the plastic and his whole body convulsing. Smith had chained him right to the kitchen chair opposite to John’s, so there is no space to hide.
You have to catch the ball with your closed arms, then pull the ball to your chest so you can’t lose it.
Shop is only one of them. The shop is situated at 222 Baker Street, with Mrs. Hudson living right next to it. Mrs. Hudson used to travel to Switzerland as a child, and wandered with her families through the gorgeous landscapes. The name
John positioned the detective, who suddenly looked so small, on the edge of the bed. He grabbed the hoodie and pulled it over Sherlock’s shaved head. Then he started undressing his pants, which prompted Lestrade to leave the room for a moment, not wanting to barge into their privacy. They didn’t notice him leaving, they were way too focused on each other and Sherlock was thankfully gaining some clarity back in his eyes.
He carefully and slowly lowered a shaking Sherlock into the bathtub. The detective let out a small gasp when his body met the water. John reached for shampoo and a spoon and slowly rinsed him down.
“It is. Without these three gods, you have no chance at all to change your cursed path. Expect the first tomorrow, at one, the second one the day after at two o’clock later, and the third one the day after at three o’clock.
John pauses and clutches the back of Sherlock’s head against him. “He did not get the chance to do anything to you, did he?
’s adoptive father, but he was definitely dead, there is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker and the chief mourner.
You idiot.” John whispered and finally pressed Sherlock to his chest. The detective whimpered, which only prompted John to hug him tighter. “How could I ever be happy without you?”
Lestrade knocked carefully on the door and peaked into the room: “Can I go back in? I think Mycroft’s men are here.”
Sherlock quickly checks his appearance in a nearby mirror. He has forgone the usual suit and black robe with dark trousers and a purple shirt. The shirt is from his drug addiction time and it sits a bit tight on him. Sherlock hopes nobody will go blind by a flying button.
