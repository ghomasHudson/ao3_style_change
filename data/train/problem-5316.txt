Every once in a while he glanced at Jurassic Park, but he couldn't bring himself to open it.
"Let's play Honest."
From above him came an involuntary snort.
“I think I’m gonna try to give Cas a call. Just to make sure he’s doing alright.”
"I got him right where I wanted him," Dean sneered.
“Thank you,” Dean added from between clenched teeth, but it melted the atmosphere, and they started to smile.
“I have butter fingers.”
“Uh… Yeah. That’s… That’s what it is.”
“Who is this?” She asked finally.
“Oh. Thanks,” Dean said, and it was genuine. How was it that they already knew each other’s pretenses and sincerities so well?
“I meant at school.”
Castiel took a seat beside him and took a look around. Not that it had been particularly clean before he left – but the place didn’t look too good now, either.
Cas’ eyes narrowed slowly into a squint. He’d seen every person Dean had asked before him walk away quickly as if he were asking for something completely absurd. Which he absolutely was.
“Hm?”
"I'm leaving, though," Dean breathed.
“Yeah, but that’s different,” Dean argued defensively.
The kitchen sure smelled like Christmas. Pans and pots were everywhere, from the counter to the table to the floor.
So casual, it made you wonder sometimes if it was just as easy for him to tell a lie.
“Next we have lunch, and then you’re going to build your own architectural models in this workshop… thing… whatever. Dismissed.”
He was speechless. She leaned forward, and put a hand on his shoulder. “You’re the top of your class, Castiel.”
This was already going horribly. Incredible. All he had to do now was get shot down.
“I’ll take it,” she said.
He didn’t know how he would set things right with Dean once this is over, what he could possibly say that would make sense in all this mess. But he could tell that, for now, he got what he wanted. A confused, hurt boyfriend, who didn’t want to be anywhere near him.
He kissed Castiel, kissed him like he meant it.
“I am, obviously.”
The knocking was incessant. Dean moved on top of him, opening his eyes.
"I'm kidding. They're both red. Let's go."
“I checked our maps, twice. The coordinates don’t lead anywhere, Cas, and they’re half across the globe to the east. It’s a spot in the middle of the sea.”
He went and stood beside Dean, resting a hand on his shoulder.
Sam was leaving to get coffee when he got out into the waiting hall with crutches, his leg in a cast.
“No.”
"We can talk. What do you want to talk about? We can talk about birds. Did you know birds are the descendants of dinosaurs?"
“Oh. Sure,” he said, watching Dean’s tense expression.  “Why are we thinking about this now?”
Still, he pulled.
He didn’t even think this was an option.
“I thought you didn't read poetry because you've got better things to do,” Cas retorted, his voice perfectly calm now.
The nightmares were nothing to worry about.
“Lame.” Dean held up a stack of documents. “College stuff.”
“Charlie,” he said into the phone when he answered.
Great. Another no-strings-attached makeout session. Or worse; studying.
“We’ll be there.”
He hated this mixture of self-loathing and sharp relief in his chest.
Meg’s eyes narrowed.
Dean snorted. “You’re cocky, you know that? Alright, how ‘bout that. Highest score keeps the dragon.”
“Nasty. They should put up a sign.”
Chuck’s eyelids opened, hanging low over his eyes.
And they both acknowledged that it didn’t. That wasn’t a problem; only Dean insisted they should take his car, and see, Castiel insisted they didn’t.
"Monsters?" Dean sighed. "I don't know. He was being vague. And I wasn't listening. He said something about me not being too old to change, and how monsters aren't all bad. He said I was wrong about something, and that monsters can change for the better."
He looked around them. “I don't really remember what this place is called.”
“Look,” Dean grinned. “My name’s in it. It must be from last summer.” He read the list. “
Dean exhaled and reopened his notebook, staring at the paint peeling from the table for a few moments before adding to his shitty poem.
“Because you said you hated them. You put on four different ties in that half hour.” He glanced at Dean over his Gameboy. “I told you, you should wear a bowtie.”
“Oh,” he blurted out dumbly. “Um. Hi.”
“Because it’s true. And you’re too busy with all your studying to even see it.” Dean slammed the kettle on the counter. “I feel like I have to fight to even have a moment with you because school stuff is always more important. You can’t exactly call someone a boyfriend who you only exchange a sentence with once in three days.” His voice carried across the apartment, and the louder it got, the more stinging the silence around them became. “So if I’m not your boyfriend, what am I to you? A house plant? A fancy soap kit your aunt brought you for the holidays that just sits on your shelf waiting for you to look its way?”
“You never seen snow or somethin’?” Dean had asked, and Cas had shook his head.
“Gotta go,” he said and stood up.
“It’s cute that you think an eight year old’s insult will hurt my feelings.” Pointedly, nonchalantly, Dean raised his hand and plucked a piece of lint off the shoulder of Gordon’s shirt. “To be honest, the most offensive thing here is how weak your punches are.”
“Any idea where we can find her?” He asked Benny.
“Oof,” he said.
“Sure. You wanna do the thing?”
“Sure.” He waved them goodbye and headed off to work.
He went back to his side of the table, beside Dean, and they kept working: Dean’s arms looked like noodles, Meg’s head vaguely resembled a human being if you disregarded the empty eyeholes, and Castiel’s torso remained the same flawless mac-and-cheese-ful creation it was. Overall: a masterpiece. When they connected it all together, it was starting to look human. It wasn’t seventeen feet tall, but it was pretty dignified for a blob.
Castiel’s squint deepened. “Winchester?” He asked slowly. And then it hit him: Dean’s picture. The one on the shelf in his house. Older, longer hair, no smile – but the same boy.
They took another step.
“You didn’t know?”
He stood up.
Or believe?
“Tell him no!” Charlie argued sharply, as if that were the obvious answer.
“Thanks for that,” said Dean.
“He's spoiling you,” said Charlie.
Inside his room, finally, was a space where he didn’t have to care about anyone else. He was alone.
accompanied the motion, and as his eyes finally adjusted to the brightness, he became aware that he was at the heart of the sea. Above him, only burning white light; around him, only deep turquoise for miles and miles away; below him, blue so deep it turned black.
He wasn’t used to this, to a family who tried to push in instead of pushing away.
She smiled.
“So this is what you’ve been busy doing.”
“I see it, you know.”
At the front of the room, their teacher was preparing cups of punch, with the help of the librarian and a couple others – Naomi, the vice president, and Metatron, a self-assured junior.
Cas shrugged. “There hasn’t been much of it.”
She said it,
Yeah.
“Yeah, well, it’s annoying.”
“What is it?” Cas asked, still looking forward. Dean swallowed. He stared straight ahead, trying to focus on anything that wasn’t Cas’ attention directed at him. “Dean? What is this about?”
“Mazel Tov,” said Chuck hesitantly.
Cas had nodded, and looked away, and it was left at that for a while. Dean hadn’t asked anything back. The last thing he’d wanted was to know about Cas’ love life. Cas never talked about it – to Dean’s relief, and maybe, a little bit, secret wishful thinking – but he was a good looking guy. He was smart and kind and no-nonsense, and really funny in a very Cas-like way. He probably got asked out all the time. That was fine. It was great. Dean just preferred not to know. Either way, Cas had pushed himself off the wall they’d been leaning on behind the counter and went to help a customer, and then Dean went to help another customer, and when they were both back behind the counter Cas had pressed his lips together and looked sideways at him and said,
“I never got that far.”
and it was two clocks. That was it. Two clocks, ticking till the batteries run out, because both his lover and him had AIDS and they didn’t know which one would die first. And they were running out of time.
“A favor?” Castiel asked. His brow arched again, and on his lips – Dean could swear – there was the shadow of a smile.
“What do you mean?”
"Sure," he said, rubbing his eyes. He hated mornings. He hated mornings so much, he wanted to sit on them. "You?"
“Don’t listen to her, Cas. You know you’re better than that.”
“Your turn,” said Castiel, and Dean stood up from his chair with a grunt. He showed the group around and got them into the room. Then he came back, crossed his legs on his chair, rested his chin in his hands and looked at Castiel expectantly.
There was a faint yell from the building behind them, and he straightened up to see Garth standing in the window of their dorm.
He stood there, on the other side of the drink table, smiling crookedly. “Hey, Cas.”
“It’s an address,” said Dean. He was already by the door with his coat in hand before Castiel got up from his chair. “Let’s go.”
Airports were bigger than Dean had imagined. Everything in them was bigger: huge halls, huge corridors, and don't get him started on the planes. How can those things possibly be safe to shoot through the sky like a cannonball? It was ridiculous. And reckless, and stupid. And-
“There’s no harm in it,” Castiel said quietly.
“Dean?” Charlie snapped her fingers in front of his face.
"That's illegal, bro."
Dean pressed his lips together awkwardly. “I'm like, hardcore in love with you. So...” He did a halfhearted finger-guns motion. “It's super painful, dude.”
"I guess we are," he said. "Give me the dragon."
“Oh, I’ve got a tight schedule,” Dean answered. A woman walked down the aisle toward them, and they parted to let her pass. “Seven o’clock till nine’s eat candy… Then eat some more candy… And then I’ll probably be in bed by ten p.m. like a big boy,” he grinned at Castiel. “Why? Got an invitation to a super cool party you wanna check out?”
“Yeah,” said Dean. “Okay.” He rolled the hem of his sleeve between his fingers. “So, anyway. How’s your family doing?”
Dr. Hanscum's eyes drifted away. “Rock bottom would be going back to your empty apartment, drinking two whole bottles of five-dollar wine and falling asleep face down on your rug with a
“To match your personality.”
“Do you think they’re buying it?” Cas asked. He was looking past Dean and through the window, his eyes on Dean’s family, inside in the heat. The two of them were outside, on their own. Earlier that morning, while they were in Dean’s room, Cas had said,
"D'you sleep alright?" Asked Dean as they set up two mugs and poured instant coffee into them.
With Dean’s help, though, things did go faster. Plus, he would grab anything questionable and point it out. It wasn’t very helpful; just somewhat endearing.
“Hm?” Dean looked at him.
“Exactly.” Crowley pointed a finger at him. “This guy gets it. You start tomorrow.”
It was one of those nights his phone kept ringing, and he kept hitting
“Come on.” Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and pulled this time. “Enough with rumors. As if it’s the first time you’re hearing them.”
It was the sound of Castiel choking on his candy.
“Hey.”
Castiel didn’t feel ridiculous. He felt trapped. If any time was a good time to pack his things and leave it was right now, and here he was, buried under a column of pirate tushies and hoping for some miracle.
“Someone call a med student. Cas got a stick up his ass,” he groaned loudly. The look in his eyes indicated that talking to Castiel – maybe even having to make eye contact with him - was probably just as painful as his injury. “Oh, wait, d’you think you could take it out yourself?”
No one else wanted to go outside in this freezing temperature. But Cas had never seen snow before. So now they were standing outside, Cas looking in, and Dean looking at him.
“Where does this lead?” He asked. Castiel shrugged.
“Yeah, I wonder where she gets that from. Say how old you are, Claire.”
He would end up doing something stupid – or worse – something selfless, and then Castiel would lose him. Mary, John and Sam would lose him.
He supposed he did know Dean very well.
He knew he should start treating Cas as his honey boo bear if he didn’t want his entire family to discover he was a pathetic liar.
“We still have eleven minutes, Dean. We’ll make it.”
"I think we're good," said Dean, looking at him. "Are we good?"
“Our one year anniversary,” said Dean. “You butt.”
“If shoving his tongue in my mouth counts any,” Castiel muttered, crossing his hands over his chest.
“I don’t know,” Castiel called back. “Up?” He thought he heard Dean mutter
“Think I’m gonna stay here and try to spot people litter the streets.”
“I never had a house.”
“Oh,” said Jo, and something in her expression shifted. It became guarded. “Good... good for you. I’m gonna go see if they need any help in the kitchen.” And she got up and left.
Dean smiles, a sweet, quiet smile that’s somewhere between sad and amused and completely smitten.
Splash. So strong it soaked Dean and everything around them.
So, they took a walk.
“Hold on.”
When they reached the school gymnasium they parted instinctively, naturally, like magnets turning and repelling one another once there were people around. The entire school was already there, every seat taken, the assembly about to start. Dean caught Charlie’s eye amidst the sea of heads and noise and she waved him over. She somehow managed to save him a seat. He saw Cas elbow his way into a vacant seat on the other side of the hall.
Not exactly the answer he’d hoped for.
“The monsters around here are nasty.”
He was happy Cas and him found it within themselves to carve their way through that ocean back into friendship. But sometimes he missed that. That feeling of being loved - not just with the eyes, the smile of a friend, but with the touch, with the words, with the
“That’s an ice cream scoop, Cas.”
He kept searching.
“Well, I don't know if in
“Drop it, Charlie,” Dean said. “We haven't seen each other in months.”
“So, like,” said Sam while Dean was filling gas outside, and leaned forward between the front seats. Castiel turned to look at him from the passenger seat. “He lectures me about getting into a relationship too soon, and then he goes and gets engaged on his twentieth birthday?”
“Seventeen years ago,” Dean said, slowly, deliberately, and Castiel was starting to get the full picture, the reason Dean was so rattled. This was a haunting-past situation. Seventeen years ago was all the way back to when he was in college and they were living in a no-bedroom apartment.
“Not like I asked for it.”
“Do you even like my brother?” Sam asked.
“And… Dean’s closer,” asserted Meg, her eyes on the page. “Van Gogh painted this in the year before his death, while he was in an asylum. One point for Mr. Squirrel.”
“I could get used to this,” said Dean, perched on Castiel’s bed, looking around them.
Castiel picked up his phone. “It’s Meg,” he said before he answered. “Hey.”
“Michelangelo sculpted it smaller than average, in line with the typical idealization of young men in the Renaissance era,” Dean spat out, clenching his teeth
He did. Dean shook his head, leftovers of laughter still rolling out from his chest. “That’s so ridiculously harsh. You’re going to a sports match with your wife, and the security guard’s just like, ‘sorry miss, you have to die now.’”
“That’s actually the thing,” said Meg. Her eyes were full of concern. It was unsettling. Meg didn't get concerned; she just got rude. “Dean hasn’t been around in a while.” She said it so carefully, as if the name were a landmine she knew very well she was stepping on. Garth signaled her something with his eyes, and she added, “And you always sit places and watch your ring, or this note you just shoved in your pocket...” She took a breath.
“Cas,” Dean said, touching the back of his hand. He was going to pretend the summer sun through the window was what sparked warmth through his arm at that moment. “Hey. You with us, buddy?”
Castiel looked at him. “You babysit?”
“Dean is busy,” Charlie stammered after eight seconds of silence. “…Counting croissants.”
A letter from Sam arrived with a ship earlier than Dean had expected. According to Sam, Dean’s story had taken him by somewhat of a surprise, but it didn’t shock him. He read the lore, and apparently things like that “happened sometimes”. With the letter, he sent two small jars of potions that should lift the curse and keep them alive. They looked absolutely disgusting – dark burgundy mixed with green floaty things – but Dean decided he’d take the chance.
When Dean stood up, Ruby’s friend – Gordon – made a beeline for the exit, shouldering him roughly on his way out.
He looked at Bobby.
Dean leaned against his shoulder. As exhausted as they were, with a whole house left to unpack, they spent a while sitting on the living room floor and watching that photo. It seemed to come alive through the glass.
“You did text me something about hamburger elevators this morning,” said Garth.
“Sure,” she said flatly. She looked at Dean. Then she looked at the phones. “...Which one’s yours?”
“I’ve thought about it, and it’s not very economical,” he answered. “I’m paying double rent now.” He nodded at a bus that was making its way down the street. “That’s me.”
“It’s like a part time job,” said Dean. “Only you don’t get paid. Or recognized. And you’ll probably die. Along with everyone you love, most likely…”
“You haven't been answering my texts.”
The moment Dean hung up the phone, he was already at the door. There were weapons in the car. It was a twelve-hour drive - ten at his current pace. He could manage with one stop. He was good to go.
"What's up?" He asked.
This time, he was the one to talk first.
At the front of the line, April sat at a stand and handed out tickets for a dollar.
“Hey, I know,” Dean said, smiling a little sadly, touching his knee to comfort him. “But usually getting your life together happens around day 150,” he said gently. “Trust me, I know.”
fish,” Castiel snapped. “He’s my fish.”
“I really did.”
“He’s a strange guy,” said Meg. “You get used to it.”
He threw his bag on the second bed and went into the bathroom to wash his face. Then he texted Dean:
“You kind of already are,” said Meg.
“How’d it go?”
“Bess didn’t want me to go,” he said at lunch. “She got into a university upstate, and she didn’t want to be far away from each other. But I told her long distance can work.”
“Christ on a cracker,” said Dean.
her best.”
Weirdo.
“That’s it?” No guidance? No help in how to bullshit his way through?
He opened the cabinet and went through it. The first item was expired. So was the second. And the third.
He opened his laptop and scrolled through a local news site, searching for something suspicious enough to distract him.
“And he’s
There was a shift on the bed behind him, and he knew the movement well enough to know Dean was propping himself up on his elbow. “I’m scared.”
Good idea?
“My socks are fine,” Castiel assured him.
He gave himself a moment. Words were always hard for him; not to talk about such intimate words, in front of six other people and a baby and Garth.
“It isn’t socially acceptable to only take one sweater, is it?”
“Suit yourself, then.”
“Blue? Really?”
“I never had a couch. How did
“So,” said the guy, the muddled smile working its way off of his face. “You never actually told me your name.”
“No.”
He threw the orange back to baby Claire. It hit the mailbox.
And so, Charlie left, and Castiel stayed.
They spoke simultaneously.
“Coulda just said no, Mr. Grumpy,” Dean muttered. He placed his sword at the base of the old lock. Castiel’s hand slid to touch the hilt of his blade. Dean heaved his sword upwards.
me, you should tell me right now."
In the living room – or was it technically the bedroom? Or the kitchen? – he spotted a pair of pants resting atop a pile of dirty clothes. He knelt down to search its pockets and found the card.
“That is exactly what a torso looks like,” Castiel informed her. And he looked up to see Dean looking at them, frozen mid-motion with his fingers sunken into clay. When Castiel made eye contact, he looked away.
"Who makes four movies about a dead mechanic trying to kill people on Halloween? This is not what a compelling concept looks like, Dean. Just another monster."
“No,” said Castiel. “Being adults sucks at... us.”
The way Dean’s face lit up made his stomach flip once and then once more.
“I won’t do it if it bothers you that much.”
Then, as an afterthought: "I mean, I don't think so."
“Now tell me your name so I can hunt you down if I don’t kill you in the next five minutes,” Dean growled.
Oh, no. No way.
He couldn’t tell Dean.
“...Cas cleans up.”
"I didn't really give it a second thought back then... Which was probably a mistake."
“Just so I know how nervous I should be of you guys disliking me.”
“I know.” His father became sober five days before Dean and him got together. It wasn’t hard to remember the date.
“He took the blame for you?”
"I don't like this," he said.
thing, like suddenly I have a
“Screw normal people. Let’s check her out.”
“Our source says his ultimate goal is to gain the trust of one of the princes,” said Crowley, eyeing Castiel and his brother. “And in order to do that, he will have to tell you a hell of a story. We believe what he’s going to tell you is the truth. We expect you to befriend him… While he thinks he’s picked you – you’ll be the one picking him out.”
He cleared his throat. “What about him?” He tried to make his voice deep and nonchalant.
“Kidding,” Dean said, watching his expression. Great. Now he made Dean feel weird, which made this even weirder. Quick: make a joke. Quick quick quick.
He looked out into the street, his face as impassive as ever. “Not enough to survive this, apparently.”
When he got to his room, Sam was sitting on the bed, waiting.
"I'm still working on the second floor," said Marcy. She looked between Claire and him. "So where's Pass?"
Naomi seemed to be waiting for a response. He shrugged.
"Thanks."
“And... Apparently Kay is Kaia. And apparently Kaia is also a girl’s name.”
“Well, then. Could you tell us more about how the lyrics connect to your personal life?”
“I am not a maiden in need of defending. I am grown,” Castiel argued, but the heat in his voice was weakened by the way the light danced on Dean’s face. He closed his eyes and tried to think clearly.
The call disconnected.
“What?” He said with a mouthful of sandwich.
“That’s the only ending hunters get,” he answered. “Dean used to say that. I guess I never saw it happening to us.” Or maybe he’d seen it all along, and figured hoping otherwise was enough to stop it from coming true.
“Text me from the bottom of the stairway!”
“Yeah.” He went around and took the driver’s seat. Dean got the receipt and took the passenger seat, and they were on the move again.
“I think going to the winter dance is a bad idea,” he said.
“Oh, God,” he said after a moment. “Poor radishes.”
"Come on." she pulled his arm. "He's fine. He probably just fell asleep in his car. Ever since you searched the address for him he's been completely obsessed with it. I think he just sits in front of it and waits for something to happen."
“So it seems like we’ve got a situation,” said Bobby. He didn’t sound fazed by the late hour. Castiel tried to shake the sleep off and match his level of awareness.
“The soup store?” Her eyes narrowed.
“Oh. Yeah. I’ll handle it. You handle the poop."
As much as he tried to sound melodramatic, his voice was still flat. When Dean saw him, though, his eyes widened with irritation.
“Me neither.”
How could he want such thoroughly opposite things? How could he be contented sitting here, huddled together, feeling Cas’ warmth, and at the same time drive himself crazy wanting more?
“No. He was saying, ‘French fries’. It was a long shot, but I thought it might be something that stood out to him about someone he was talking to.”
“Yes, I am aware.”
. Or maybe it was
It had seemed to sink in for Cas and him at about the same moment. Their expressions had both turned horrified, or maybe it was just Dean’s expression that had been horrified. Cas’ had somehow been flustered and gentle at the same time.
Castiel almost reached out.
“We make a great team,” said Dean. “Should we start a wedding planning business together?”
Mistletoe.
Claire checked her phone. "It's five minutes past seven."
Dean stepped closer, pointed his palms up as a sign of peace, spoke low and placid. “I’ll give you a share. Twenty five percent, say.”
He leaned back away from Dean. "What's that supposed to mean?"
“Behold, my crew!” He roared, looking round. “We have captured a…” His voice fell a few degrees in volume, and he glanced at Castiel again. “What are you?”
The doctor spent another moment looking through the files. "We removed the bullet from his shoulder," he said to Dean. "Lucky the bullet stayed in. The wound wasn't nearly deadly, but he lost a lot of blood. If the bullet had left his body, I'm afraid he would have lost much more blood through the exit wound. We patched him up, gave him more blood and fluids. He's being transferred to the inpatient ward where you can see him. I want him here for tonight to make sure nothing's going wrong, but I'll come by tomorrow morning. If everything looks fine, I'll sign his release papers and you can go back home. Questions?"
“You don’t tell the demon that!” Dean hissed at him.
He looked around. She wasn’t there. She wasn’t anywhere.
“Nice,” Dean smiled.
His eyes dropped to his phone, trying to avoid further questioning. He had one message from Cas; a time and a place, later this evening, after his shift at the flower shop.
Finally, Ms. Mills called his name, and he stood up stiffly.
“Why not stay here?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, turning around. “I don’t know what I should’ve done about your friend. It doesn’t matter. It wasn’t worth any of this.” He looked into Sam’s eyes and swallowed the lump in his throat. “It wasn’t worth losing my dad and my baby brother.”
Cas was… Someone. Someone he had managed to pretend he’s forgotten.
Gently, Garth said, “Did you and Dean break up?”
“I just want to know,” he’d said finally. It was less than convincing.
The girl leaning forward behind him was blond, and wore a red jacket. Dean had heard people call her Ruby in the halls. She tilted her head at another student. “Gordon wants to know if it’s true.”
“Get up.”
“How?” Bobby asked.
“I see light,” Castiel shouted. And then they were out in the open, at the top of the mountain. They halted to a stop, for a few more steps would have had them thrown off the cliff.
“Not until I get him,” Hannah sighed.
Chuck looked up at him with an even stare, as if he were thinking,
“That requires three weeks of planning?”
Cas nodded slowly. “Did you think it was… a movie?”
Castiel walked over to the kitchen cabinets and took some things out, then walked back. And all the while, Dean was eyeing him with this intensity, this look that was so alert and fierce, despite his slumping shoulders, despite seeming like he hadn’t slept in days, and Castiel couldn’t help but notice the two black strings that wrapped around his neck and disappeared under his shirt and that Castiel only needed to see the vague shape of beneath the fabric to know held an amulet, and a ring.
He didn’t bother uttering something more than a snort.
okay?”
“So you applied to the same job,” he said. For a few moments, they were both quiet. Then Dean said:
Cas followed him through the living room to the front door, calling his name over the voices of everyone else, and only caught up to him when Dean pulled the door handle.
He grabbed his coat and Dean’s keys and walked down the stairs. Put the key into the car door. Turned. Opened. Sat.
“Oh, it’s gonna be fine,” he said. “Just need to find the time to fix it up. Hit a deer pretty hard. Come on.” The train arrived, and they took a seat.
“I... don’t know what I wanted."
Dean looked at him.
He woke up in the middle of the night to light footsteps approaching the bed. Dean was breathing heavily next to him, unconscious.
“Oh. Right. Yeah. I’ll pick you up,” said Dean and gave him a quick kiss.
He waited till after Cas left to let himself smile.
“I can work on that,” said Dean.
Whatever her motive was, it was none of Dean’s business.
"Oh my God," said Meg. "Please don't tell me they're bringing out the TV. I can't stand another class on satanic rituals. Some people are Satanists. Get over it. It's not like the gates of hell are opening."
“It's alright. My mom and Sam are out. Though I think it's a little too late to patch things up with the neighbor.” He scratched his head awkwardly. “You could've called, you know.”
“Anything I can do to make up for it?” Cas grumbled, his tone as careless as possible. Which was not very.
“His name is Timothy.”
“I thought he’s the guy whose dad is in prison.”
“Cas?”
In his room, with the door closed, he answered the phone.
Ms. Mills called his name, and he got up and walked to the front of the class.
“What were you saying?” Cas asked.
“What?”
“Good,” he replied. Pulled his father off the kitchen floor. Somehow managed to get into an argument with every single person he knew by dinnertime.
“Are you spending the holidays with your family?” He asked Garth.
“You’d be surprised,” he muttered. “It’s hard, but I manage.”
Dean still had his leg in a cast when August thirty-first came along and it was time for Castiel to leave for college.
Footsteps, and then Dean at the door.
“Do you know how to play?”
Dean opened the book and skimmed through it. Meg pushed her chair closer to the bed and tapped on his shoulder.
He’d write the fuck out of that strongly-worded letter.
“I mean read,” said Charlie. “You’re sitting ten feet away from a bookstore. Get your ass off the chair and read some poetry. There’s no better way to learn how to do it yourself.”
He was sitting on his bed, his back to the wall, with a book in his one hand. His other hand was wrapped around Dean, who was unconscious and alarmingly close to snoring on his shoulder.
“We knew a demon named Ruby,” said Castiel. “She’s the one who kidnapped Sam and broke Dean’s leg last summer. Was this Ruby a demon?” He asked Benny.
On his way to his locker he ran into Gordon. He fought the urge to send a hand up and rub his nose, although it stopped hurting days ago.
“I thought someone might want to visit. It’s pretty serious.” He didn’t know why his tone sounded so defensive.
Under the last sun-rays of the dying afternoon, he heard a soft knock on his door.
“So?” Cas asked, and turned to him.
"So he's just a regular kid?"
"What?"
Neither Dean, nor Dr. Hanscum, paid him any attention.
“Studying,” said Cas. “You said you’d help me prepare for my exam.”
“Just ‘casue you’re upset, you can be the little spoon today.”
Dean forced his eyes to open, to look at him. He seemed even more on his way into sleep than Dean was.
The junior moved, and revealed a shorter brunette two feet away from Dean. He barely managed to dive for cover.
He didn’t.
“Why don’t you introduce yourselves?” Said Donna.
Dean’s eyes shot to his face. “Are you serious?”
“We do,” said Castiel.
Castiel felt his eyebrows rise. “I was under the impression that you recognized me.”
“Nope.”
Dean put a hand on her shoulder. "It's gonna be alright," he said securely, and didn't believe it one bit. "But we have to go."
“What is it?” He asked, stepping closer.
“Of course,” Charlie said. Her voice was dry. “How could I forget.” She saved his ass from two weeks of grounding that day. He didn’t really have a curfew this year.
“I’got s’mthing to tell you,” he said. Dean let out a slow, heavy breath.
"You're giving up a shit apartment," said Meg. “Not waking Satan from the dead, man."
Dean corrected, and turned to his couple’s therapy partner... person.
Dean sensed that, it seemed, in the curve of Castiel’s mouth and in the slope of his shoulders. So he stepped back and resumed making dinner.
“Come on,” Meg urged. She looked absolutely thrilled to play: eyebrows pulled down, hands crossed against her chest, every word an angry bark.
"You're thirty-seven!"
. He went to the back of the hall, to place it in the
An arm rose from the dark to block his blow, pushing his blade back to stop its body from getting impaled. And then a voice spoke that was familiar, even more than the arm, than the grip, than the scent.
“Me?” Dean blinked.
“Was that your... girlfriend?” Asked Garth reluctantly.
“I'll hold it while you add more bands,” said Dean.
“Clarence, tell him grades are everything to you.”
Dean slumped into his chair. “He said yes,” he muttered. Jo looked him up and down.
“Oh.” Dean’s anger deflated. She wasn’t trying to embarrass him. She was just trying to be nice. “Yeah. I guess I don’t mind.”
“It’s your thing.”
Dean thought it over – how often he went on dates, and how he always managed to find – no, always
“No,” said Castiel.
“Yeah. I don’t think we left anything alive. Except, we don’t wanna be here when people start finding the bodies.”
He found quiet in a small, empty cell that was called ‘showers’ but was really a square with tiles and a shower head close to the ceiling. It wasn’t silence: he could still hear the waves outside. But it was quiet.
, it almost felt like he had no choice.
“Hello?”
“Nothing,” she said, and her eyes jumped in the general direction of her phone and back to his face.
“Nothing,” he said.
He was safe.
He could feel Cas’ pulse against his fingers.
The taller one’s voice, again. “Dean. Concentrate.”
Come night, the temperature dropped. Having listened to the chatter of the crew all day, Castiel caught a few other names – Crowley, Balthazar, Ash, Jess. Everyone seemed to have a task which, to Castiel’s bewilderment, they carried out willingly, but more baffling was the way they blindly followed the man who called himself their captain. He barely had to say a word and they were there – some without hesitation, some grudgingly, but it was clear as day: the man was a leader.
“What?”
“When will the monsters attack?” Castiel suggested flatly. He didn’t like the forced nonchalance of Dean’s tone, and he didn’t feel like tiptoeing around questions he didn’t want to answer.
“Can’t sleep?” she asked.
“Does Mr. Zach know?” He asked. “The other day, what he said...”
“What? No.” He threw a pair of pants over his books guiltily. “At least your brother is visiting,” he said to Dean.
“You can’t be mean to me now,” he complained, like there was some kind of rule about dating people and making killer clown jokes about them.
“I took Krav Maga in fourth grade.”
“Alright. Yom Kippur,” said Ms. Mills. “Also known as the Day of Atonement. Open on page 152…”
Enough self pity. He got out of the car. He was going to bring Dean back somehow, in some way, any way he could. Because he didn’t get dragged into this world of hunters and hellhounds and demons just to get a dead fiancé out of it.
“Someone came in looking for Jurassic Park,” Cas started, “And when I said we don’t have it, she started yelling at me that the bookstore two blocks over has it, and how come we don’t have it, it’s unacceptable – if the other bookstore has it, just go buy it there and leave me alone, lady.”
“You’re welcome,” he said to Meg. He kept scrolling for sofas while Dean got up to check the drawer.
Castiel had imagined this moment many times before. He’d seen Dean’s face in his mind – furious, cold, hurt. But he’d never imagined them so torn, so distraught as it were now. Like he was trying to put together the pieces of a puzzle that burned his fingertips. Castiel found the sheer lack of hate in Dean’s eyes both relieving and fairly offensive.
Charlie emerged back from the bathroom holding her toothbrush in one hand and a shirt in the other. She threw the shirt at Dean’s face when she passed by them. “I’m a little concerned that you two are going to drown in your laundry when I’m gone.”
His throat dried in one moment.
He didn’t want to do it this way. To tear the space between them open. To let silences take over the comfortable back and forth of their friendship. To wish that Cas would stay away, to not want him around, to feel awkward and guilty around him. He never meant to be the cause of tension between them. But that really, really didn’t matter now. Because he was.
“Washing machine instructions,” he told Dean. “Can you check the instructions drawer?" He added into the phone, "We might have taken them with us.”
“It’s a children’s tale about a turtle king who wants to see beyond his kingdom so he climbs all his turtle subjects… this isn’t the matter right now. Point is, this is ridiculous, and except that, we’re way too short to get that high.”
“Doesn’t it?” Asked Chuck.
“Asshole,” Dean muttered beside him, pretending to look at the porch of the stadium, where the crowd was beginning to stand and line up for the exits.
Dean was smiling.
“Is your girlfriend a... guy?”
“Same one.”
“It’s kind of urgent,” Dean called.
“Okay.”
“I've been dead!”
Dean took his hand. “Cas, you’ve been staring at air like you’ve seen a ghost all day. Do I need to start worrying you had a stroke?”
Cas slowed down to walk by his side, lowering his voice and letting passion seep into it at the same time. “Then why don’t you teach them a lesson once, and they won’t ever touch you again?”
a sad lesbian."
“It doesn't matter if we're ready,” said Dean. “Life doesn't ask you whether you're ready. It throws shit at your face and you just have to deal with it. This girl isn't ready to be an orphan. I wasn't ready at four. You weren't ready at twenty.”
“Does... any other building around here have a graffiti of two comic book characters on top of each other?” Dean asked.
He wondered if Dean knew, when he made this blank face, that Castiel could tell he was lying. All the way back to the days when they would sit side by side in old, stuffy classrooms, before his sister in law had been killed, back when he knew nothing about monsters – he could tell, when he would ask Dean about his weekends, or his past, and Dean’s face would go blank like this, that he was lying.
“Answer the question,” she insisted.
Dean squinted at him. He squinted harder.
“Yeah, that’s the place,” said Benny, somewhat fazed.
During break, he called Sam. He answered instantly.
“She was weird.”
“Um...” Cas let out. “I really, really didn’t want to spend Valentine’s Day alone.”
“Weird.”
“I don’t know,” said Castiel. “Is there?”
“Thank you for coming tonight.”
“What do you think?” Dean asked him.
“Luci?” Castiel stopped him. “What about him?”
“You’re coming home, buddy,” said Dean. Then he looked at Castiel and raised the stuffed dragon. “I was talking to Timothy, not you.”
“Do I look scared?” Dean slurred. His fingers were itching to clench into fists. He had to force his limbs to stay limp. Useless. He waited for the next blow – almost anticipated it – but it didn’t come.
Castiel sat down next to him. “Yeah, I know.”
He shrugged.
Castiel stood at the threshold, tapping his foot on the old doormat on the floor. It was the kind of mat with a written message, like ‘Welcome’, but instead of ‘Welcome’ it said ‘Go Away, Demons’. There was a black spot at a corner of it, and Castiel knelt down to look at it. It didn’t look like dirt; it looked like paint. He wondered whether something was written on the bottom. He touched the edge to turn it over, but at that moment, Dean opened the door.
No one’s done something nice for him in a while. Except, it wouldn’t take him long to pay Cas back. Between school and work, they did spend about sixty percent of their lives less than a hundred feet away from one another.
Castiel rose up to his elbows. “When was it not a girl’s name?”
Was he really so determined to keep his secret from Dean, that he would rather lose a finger for it? Couldn’t he find some way to foil Dean’s plans later, or run away?
They stayed for the funeral. The day after, Michael said they should probably go. So Castiel found himself once again in the car with his father, listening to the soft whoosh of the A/C.
“A-minus?” Dean’s face lit up. “Good job!” He raised his hand for a high five, and Castiel stared at it.
Cas’ eyes, set on the crowd in front of them, narrowed. “Does the mouse dance with the snake?” He asked flatly.
Ellen was the one to answer him. “We’re not fifteen anymore, Bobby. This isn’t some teenage fling we’re supposed to hide from our parents.”
“You… Didn’t?” Castiel asked, and there it was again – that furrow between Dean’s eyebrows that made him look so miserable Castiel had to look away.
"No."
He shook his head. “I love you.”
He couldn't help think about how each of them came out of it; him, with relief and anger for his brother once they found him, safe and sound. And Cas, with his head high, and without a father. This void that was filled for him was never filled for Cas. And he couldn't be more grateful for their friendship, that grew and flourished out of this ugly thing that ended things between them. The best days of their relationship could never compare to an average summer day of them sitting in Dean's room and talking about nothing in the past two years. Their time as a couple – it was fire, and anger, and then regret. Every day since had been... happiness in its own way.
Castiel found himself sitting on a chair at his dining table. There was something unsettling in the air that he couldn’t quite put his finger on.
“It was you.”
He blinked at the ceiling.
The car stilled, inches from the car standing in a red light before them. The driver at the front car poked his hand out the window and made a rude gesture.
Castiel chose a spot by the punch bowl. He had to prevent as many people as he could from drinking it.
“What?” Dean had asked, taking a break from making the bed to look at him.
But it didn't, not really. Passion wasn't the same as feeling.
Somehow, Dean forgot to put water in the pot, and Castiel turned the stove on too high.
He pushed past her and hurried after the lady.
“Yeah.” He switched the car into Park. “So... She said, if I want, she’s decided to give me the opportunity to finish my diploma here.”
Charlie arrived late that afternoon, storming across the room at Dean and crashing into him with such force that he was almost knocked off his chair. Castiel’s heart twisted, and he had to look away. It felt too familiar, too fresh, this overflowing uncontrollable emotion. And then came Dean’s explanations all over again.
It started to go downhill about five minutes in.
“No, I mean...” Dean cleared his throat, his eyes on the sand. “With us.”
“’Kay,” Dean did the finger guns at him. “Gotcha.” But he couldn’t go another five minutes before speaking again. “You think it’s time for dinner?” He looked at his watch. “I think it’s time for dinner.”
“What’s wrong?” He asked.
When they got to the front of the line, Castiel asked, “Do you want to go first?”
“I’m... giving Cas a ride home,” said Dean.
Dean was extremely attached to that old thing. So attached that Castiel sometimes wondered if he should be jealous. But he was fine with it, when they needed to be at the movies. Arriving at a job interview in that thing was just a bit too much, no matter how willing Dean was to make out with its windshield. So they took Castiel’s car.
“Good,” Cas said, accepting his cup, at the same time Dean said, “Horrible.” Mary stared at them. Jo watched from the kitchen, face blank.
Could he do that?
Jody Mills dumped a thick history book on the teacher’s table and put her palms on the backrest of a chair. “How was everyone’s weekend?”
“Are you a book nerd?” She asked.
tone. “But this is all backwards, isn’t it? The high concentration of monsters in this town? And have you ever noticed the names of stores in this town? Azazel’s Party Pizza Pies, Abaddon’s, Crowley’s escape room. These are all demon names. And then, now, with the resurrection? Don’t you think that’s a little bit odd?”
“Sounds like the pots put up a rebellion,” said Charlie.
“Eleven times out of the twelve you were alone.”
“Yeah,” he said. “They can be pretty irrational about it.”
From a corner of the loose circle, Crowley spoke wryly. “And how would you know so much about what’s in these caves?”
He was about to say,
“How do you know it’s a him?” Charlie asked. “You’ve never even seen his face. All you did was shove your tongue into his mouth.” She wrinkled her nose again.
“Yeah,” he said, trying to remember her question. “I know the difference.”
Dean let out a single snore on his shoulder, and then his head slipped slowly until it was in Castiel’s lap.
“Fine.”
“Thanks for the heads up,” said Dean. “I’m gonna ignore that judgy tone, though.”
“Take a seat, Dean,” said Ms. Mills, and April left. The boy made his way to the far left of the classroom, by the windows, and touched the back of a chair on the third row. Ms. Mills continued talking about the Festival of Lights.
Certainly not feelings that that grown baby angel would never, ever reciprocate.
“There’s one problem, though. You don't look old enough to have a wife or a daughter.”
“I guess,” said Meg. “If your type is hot but dumb.”
“I just don't know how to make it feel... Natural.”
“Yeah.”
“Hey, Cas,” he said. “How’re you doing?”
“For cutting that ridiculous fight off back there before you embarrassed yourself.”
“Hey,” Dean protested.
“You have a better idea?” asked Dean.
“Name?”
"No I’m not. I'll just... I'll just text him."
“Isn’t it freezing out?” Dean asked.
“Yeah.”
“You’re sweet.”
It was actually pretty endearing.
“Maybe we should be talking about happier things,” he said. At that, Dean’s lips pursed, and he looked away again. The ocean waves swayed back and forth.
“Get better comebacks, Bunny Bear,” said Meg. “And if you don’t do whatever I want, I will go out there and tell Anna that we broke up and that you’re all hers.”
“Ha. That’s not as bleak as the phrasing I had in mind.”
“How is it so spotless?” He asked. “So many years and not one scratch…”
“You’ve tried to escape once already, Honey Bear.” Dean’s lips set into his usual smile. “And I defeated you with no problem at all. So you must understand there’s no point in trying to escape again. You’d be a fool to try.”
He spotted a fire escape outside a window to his right. A few guys Meg’s age were climbing in from outside.
“What?”
“That would be hard, considering you’re always ten steps away from him at most.”
“It’s okay,” he mumbled. Dean’s face twisted. “Really.”
“I’m... sure I would have recalled,” Dean said while getting into the car, rolling the window down.
“What do we do?”
“We are gathered here today to watch two people become from man and man – to man and man.”
“I thought you lived here,” said Dean dryly.
Castiel looked around the dark cell. A devil’s trap was pained on the floor, and there were shelves upon shelves made of metal standing against the walls, packed with cursed boxes. Behind one shelf was a table of grenades, shotguns hanging on the wall above it.
“Well,” the captain raised his hand in a semi-dramatic gesture and flashed one of his bright-eyed grins at Castiel. “I reckon our fancy soldier boy would rather have a good looking chick caress him gently than he would me. Eh, Pumpkin?” He smirked at Castiel.
“A friend-date,” Dean explained, grinning at him. And he couldn’t explain it, but that one sentence felt insurmountable. Like if he said yes then the word ‘friend’ would be erased from the sentence. And he wasn’t ready for that, for– for a hundred different reasons. Because he’s never seen Dean wear socks that weren’t white, for instance.
“Nice costume?” He tried. She laughed, lifting her ax.
“Aren’t you bored?”
“Then we’ll tell someone,” said Castiel.
“Try your birthday.”
. He grabbed his keys and skipped down the stairs. His phone buzzed:
“I know we’ve been planning it for a long time and all, but it’s just... not the right time.”
“If you don’t, they’re going to keep guessing,” said Meg.
“What?” Dean’s eyebrows furrowed. Cas pursed his lips and started again.
“Yes.”
The kitchens.
“So, uh…” He mumbled with great wit as their characters were walking around in a room. “What- what were you last year? I mean… Did you go as anything?” God, he was a mess. He couldn’t even utter a normal human being’s sentence. He took his cup in somewhat of a shaky hand and forced himself to take a sip, to at least try and seem casual. Cas leaned in slightly towards him.
“It would have looked like a Mr. Potato Head.”
“You mind if I take a shower for a sec?” He asked as Castiel clicked to maximize the Chrome window that was already open. He pressed
“How long is always?” Claire asked, and her voice was somehow calmer.
“Lion King?” Asked Dean. “You mean ESPN.”
“You coming?”
“Nope.”
He could see how it was Meg’s party.
Dean hesitated. “Sometimes it’s hard to get his full attention,” he said finally.
They both needed to buy new cards for the train – Dean hadn’t been downtown yet, and Castiel’s old one was from 2017.
“Still a lot to take in,” Dean said quietly then.
Meg snorted, and Vampire Guy snorted too.
Castiel nodded slowly. “Alright.”
Or maybe he was just an old nut.
Without thought, Castiel snorted.
“It's probably the punch in the face,” Cas offered.
“Could we do this on the porch? I have an eleven p.m. curfew and it’s…” He glanced at the dashboard clock. “One and a half. Never mind.”
"We went to middle school together."
“I don’t care about books,” Dean cut him off.
“Talk like normal people, or talk as in be weird and jumpy like you were before?”
Dean didn’t stop walking. “Come on. Even you can do better.”
“Yeah. So, um. Can I ask you something?”
“Yeah?”
“But she hates me,” Dean said.
“Okay...” Everywhere around them, students were sitting down. A big man who looked suspiciously like Santa walked into the front of the room and fiddled with a microphone.
Castiel sat at a picnic bench and stared at his phone.
And then the doorbell rang.
he thought to himself,
"I understand," he said, and it took him some effort to mean it, but he did.
“You just don’t have the...”Garth started, searching for the right word.
He wasn’t sure whether Dean was talking about their equal fighting skills or about something else. Dean stuffed the map into his pocket and left the room, clapping Castiel’s back and mumbling about dinner as he went.
This was what freedom felt like.
“Nope,” said Dean.
“You’re a butt,” he answered.
They stood there for a moment, drowning in awkward silence. It was horrible.
“Alright,” said Castiel harshly.
Castiel sat.
“It's not bad,” she said, and she clearly tried to hide it, but she looked a little relieved when he said he didn’t care. It felt like a punch in the gut. He wouldn’t be surprised if she expected judgment on her personal life from people in this town, same as Dean did, but the realization she was scared of it coming from her friend, someone she defended and who would defend her too with all he had – it hurt. Partly because he didn’t understand it, and partly because he did. Her and Meg and Cas were the only friends he had in here, and he would go for them the same distance they went for him. But, at the same time, the thought that they secretly judged him the same as everyone else did was something he often couldn’t shake off.
“And what village would that be,” Metatron continued, stepping towards Castiel cautiously, “the one you so kindly spread the treasure in?”
At 7:58, his phone buzzed.
“What a weirdo,” said Meg.
“What? Where?”
“Go on fake dates?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “I don’t actually think we’ve done this before.”
was what Dean would have responded with, hadn’t he turned around and found himself face to face with Castiel.
“Hey- is this seat taken?”
“Now it feels like Christmas,” said Charlie into the silence Dean left behind him.
"When did you move here?" Dean asked as they sat down.
He let out a surprised huff, then, and unclenched his fingers around the knife.
Dean hesitated.  “Have you wanted to kiss me just tonight?” He said, quietly. Cas answered after a moment or two.
“Branching out,” said Meg, peeling her orange, and smiled. The air filled with that orange smell that wasn’t bad but was just undeniably
Castiel frowned. “Lack of sleep isn’t an excuse for not doing your job right.”
He browsed some more and then closed Dean’s laptop and knocked on the bathroom door.
major.”
“It’s my birthday,” said Dean, raising his eyebrows, and tugged on his hand.
. He shook his head. “Now we're here, and it might be tempting fate, but I feel like there's nothing we can't take over because we've pretty much been through every worst case scenario possible.”
"Do you really expect me to remember the themes to all your shooting-bad-guys movies?"
“It’ll be a disaster.”
“This is awkward,” Andy said finally. “Show me the picture another time, man.”
“You guys have no concept of privacy,” he said.
“Alright,” said Dean, and put his hands up, palms down, as if he was saying
“Oh, and I think I left my library card in my pants yesterday. You can take it out if you still want that book you were talking about so that you can get it without returning the one you’ve already got.”
Mr. Man wasn’t exactly creepy. There was just something off about him; something out of place. Maybe it was that everything was so in place: on the bridge of his long nose sat a pair of big, square glasses, and underneath it he grew a thick moustache. He wore a buttoned shirt, a tie and brown trousers every day, and carried a briefcase Castiel had never seen him open. He was the over-smiling, over-sharing type of guy, and his name was Robert Man. The most ordinary person Castiel has ever seen.
“So fast?” He asked.
Dean walked in, closed the door after him and sat down on the bed. He looked mildly traumatized.
“How are you guys doing?” She asked.
“Again with the lettuce?” Dean complained.
Don’t get him wrong. He was awfully relieved that Chuck was trying to sober up. He was picking up writing again. He was existing outside of the two square feet around the living room armchair. But Castiel had never seen him this sober until five days ago, and, unexpectedly, it was… a different kind of trouble than before.
She looked him up and down, lips pursed. “Let me check where they took him.”
Dean managed a squint. “What?”
“Snow.” He was standing by the window, looking out.
He opened his eyes to a cool sun, blinding him with white, direct light. Squinting, he looked around and tried to make sense of the shapes around him.
“It doesn’t. It’s just gross,” said Dean. “Hey, let’s check out the food.”
Now it was Castiel who frowned. “I’d honestly rather you stab me in the neck than having to call you that.”
She grabbed his phone, and recorded a voice message.
"I'm good," Dean huffed bravely, although his voice was close to breaking.
Sam smiled in response. “He can be like that.”
"One week after we moved in," said Dean. His phone vibrated. "Hold on," he said and answered it. "Hey." he stood up and walked to the kitchen. "What's up?" he tried to sound casual rather than embarrassingly anxious.
Dean shook his head. “I keep waiting for something to happen. For something to attack out of the blue.” Then he shook his head again, more decisively now, as if trying to kick his fears out.
He waved back and sat on his own bed.
Dean shrugged beside him. “I dunno,” he said. His eyes fell from the players to the ground. “Kiss ‘n make up?”
“So you've decided I shouldn't, either?”
“You’ll be alright here?”
Dean examined his face for a long moment. Then his arms tightened across his chest.
Outside the turmoil of his mind, the two royal advisers turned to each other, arguing.
“He must have been trying to get to Lilith through Ruby,” said Bobby. “Pretend he's on their side.”
And they fell into silence again.
“Um. Sure.”
“Yeah,” Dean muttered. He felt Cas’ eyes on him. He looked straight ahead. “Thanks, Garth.”
Nothing seemed so bad anymore.
He saw Dean walk towards their teacher with a rosemary leaf crown, a pair of black jeans and a metal rod in each hand. It must have been the most impressive thing he’d seen in his fucking life. And then he saw Robert aim his gun, and pushed Dean aside forcefully. And then he saw nothing.
“You asked someone out last month in your gym clothes while you were covered in sweat,” Kevin added. “And she said yes.”
“You’re smart.” Dean gritted his teeth. “For a cheater.”
Garth stuck a wooden board into the fire, then slipped and landed on his ass in the skeleton’s lap.
Something bothered his ears. Thumping. Knocks on the door. He looked down.
He tried to tune back in. One thing at a time. The dining table. His hands on it, flipping his ring. The kitchen counters, loaded with dishes.
“I’m looking,” he yelled back. In his belt? No, that was the guns. He felt up his sleeve; that was the sharp stick.
“Maybe-” Dean started, just when a waitress approached their table.
“Actually, I’m just coming out,” said Castiel. “Don’t go in there. There’s a big mess.”
“Ironic?” Cas asked. Dean could feel his eyes on him, bright as the moonlight.
He tried for a different strategy.
“What are you saying?” Asked Castiel.
the people you are now! If you’re so positive it’s a good idea then just go for it.”
Dean glared at his notebook for a few more moments, and then picked up a pen.
“An experience neither of us will ever repeat.”
Another few moments passed in silence. Then, Dean said:
Dean raised his hands in the air so she could see inside his jacket. “You can pat me down if you want.”
“But it’s perfectly mature to steal other people’s sweaters?” He countered.
But he still couldn’t shake that bad feeling in his gut off. All through the weekend, he went over the events of that night in Dean’s house in his mind. And it didn’t help that he woke up Saturday morning with a cold; it just gave him more reasons to take a break from his schoolwork, and think about Dean instead. Because, if he was being honest with himself, he’d had a weird feeling about this for a while. Like how vague Dean got about certain topics. Or how sometimes Castiel got the impression he was lying. About meaningless things – like where he spent the weekend, or why he was handing out cold weapons as presents. But this was the first time Castiel actually saw something, and couldn’t deny: it wasn’t normal.
Giving up before he even tries is alright, if he knows he’s about to fail anyway. Right?
“What did I get myself into?”
Castiel saw the opportunity, and he took it. He lifted a box and said,
“I’ll hold your hand the entire time,” Dean smiled. “I won’t let go, I promise. Bathroom breaks not included.”
An annoyance, Dean made himself think.
“You never told me how you got this.” He shook the paper in his hand. His eyes held no accusation, only absent minded curiosity.
“I’m not sure what you want me to say,” he said. She smiled.
Their new house was big and beautiful, with two floors and a front lawn in a good neighborhood. Better than either of them had imagined they could ever have, and only affordable thanks to the inheritance Chuck left behind.
“Do you really sleep in Batman pajamas?”
“Why?” he’d asked. Cas’ expression had gone blank. There was a pause.
“And?”
This story wasn’t over.
He was a mastermind of pure evil.
“It’s a deal,” Dean said with a smile. “If you can tell me what ‘this class’ is.”
Castiel lifted his own ring for him to see.
“But it gives us a day off, so,” Dean shrugged.
Dean glanced at him from behind the wheel. “Who even are you?”
“I didn’t know you were a sore loser.” Cas patted his shoulder and walked past him. “It’s okay, Dean. You’re good at some other things. Like losing.”
“All the ladies,” he said in response.
“That’s right,” Gordon said. “Go cry to daddy. Oh, right. You can’t.”
That was odd. No one texted him anymore. No one except Charlie and Meg and...
“Are you with me?” He asked Dean anxiously. He would hit Dean first, softly, with the shaft of his sword, and then move on to the rest of them. He could hurt this angry mob that was after him, but he’s hurt Dean enough for a lifetime. He couldn’t hurt him anymore.
It was four months later when his phone rang, and the caller ID showed a name that had never called him before.
Dean nodded and looked at his compass, waiting until his dragon made a sharp turn left. Then he lay out the page on his dragon’s deep blue neck and scribbled on it. Castiel could see the tension in his jaw – he was gritting his teeth. The wind ruffling his hair violently in every direction, his eyes wide and the line of his shoulders strong, his figure seemed wild and impressive. Restless and still forceful, like the sea itself. Castiel’s chest filled with a foolish longing to stay in his moment and watch Dean for the rest of his lonely life.
Cas nodded in confusion. “Yeah,” he mumbled.
“Uh... They gave me four free jars of tomato sauce at the supermarket this week, so I guess we’re having spaghetti for the next... forever weekends.” He looked at Castiel.
“Ruby?” He asked.
“Then how come I didn't know anything about it?”
He noticed something while walking past the bulletin board in the entrance to his dorms. A job ad.
“You have the keys?”
Dean nodded his chin at Cas’ uncostumed outfit. “This guy thinks it’s lame to dress up when you’ve passed the tender age of five.”
“There's no such thing as good monsters,” Dean snapped. “Some creatures are just meant to kill, and good intentions won’t change that. It’s in their DNA.”
“…To describe the result rather than describing the action,” Naomi was saying. “For example, instead of saying, ‘I touched his face’, I’ll say, ‘his face was warm underneath my fingers’. Which brings me to our next assignment.”
“Truly,” said Shelley. “The killer hasn’t been found.”
Cas shifted in place. “Would you mind if I asked... Are any of them true?”
“Someone’s at the door,” Castiel muttered urgently. Dean lifted his head, and dropped it again on Castiel’s chest.
“That’s not it,” Dean said. He tripped over a root in the ground. Cas’ grip tightened. “If I wanted to beat them up, I know I could do it. I know I could seriously hurt them.”
Dean shook his head dismissively. “I had a fight with my parents.”
“I’m-” Dean started, but when he looked over at Dr. Hanscum, she was checking her watch.
Dean shook his head and nodded his head toward the nearest knife.
“Tell you mine if you tell me yours,” Dean said, squeezing humor into his words. He didn’t really care what Cas did. Didn’t think it was his business. But he just wished…
“How long?” He repeated, slow and seething. “You know what? I don’t even want to know.”
“Whatever it is, I’m sure he’ll understand,” Castiel said softly.
"Stop calling her 'it'. She's a kid, Cas, not a house plant."
In second thought, maybe Dean’s gift wasn’t weird at all, and it was all in Castiel’s head that there was something more to it. In third thought, it was a way better gift than what he’d gotten from anyone else, mostly because his family members were too busy or too far away or too drunk to give him anything at all. By the next morning, Castiel had all but put his suspicions aside.
“Good news?” Asked Castiel, and everything faded into the background.
Dean didn’t cry when they left the cinema. But he was damn close to it. His eyes shimmered as they stepped back into the cold outside. He took one look at Castiel’s blank expression, and turned to look the other way.
His eyes followed hers to a girl standing at the front and looking at the chrysanthemums.
“He isn’t,” said Sam. It was almost a question.
“We’ve found three coordinates so far.” Dean looked up. “How many are left?” Castiel shrugged.
"That's not a real threat."
“He wanted me to have a chance at a normal life.”
“Stupid traffic,” he said, crossing his arms over his chest with a full-on pout. “We’ll be late.”
“Frowning?” Cas asked.
Admittedly, there was something questionable about it. And maybe it was this new shift that was in the works this week – from the burden of lying and sneaking around to a kind of exposure he had no control over – that made him just a little bit more open to the idea of inviting disaster into his life.
“Yeah.”
Castiel eyed him.
“Mayonnaise.”
And then they were all quiet for a long while.
Castiel walked over and rested a hand on his shoulder. “It’s not exactly the kind of thing you just shake off,” he said gently.
“Mostly,” Sam laughed. “But in a loving kind of way. Like, he said you made him eat a salad once.”
“No,” said Meg. “Him being a douche. He tried to give me a hickey.”
“I’m not gonna lie to you, Meg. I’m this close to doing that.”
There was a foyer at the entrance with a stairwell leading upstairs to several bedrooms, most of which were empty and long forgotten now. There were a kitchen and dining room to the right, and a spacious living room to the left.
“Sure.”
Or maybe that.
“No. It’s a safety measure, so that you don’t end up on your bottom in the water.”
He shook his head again. “Actions over words, huh?” And then he grabbed Dean by the collar and kissed him.
He looked.
“I can tell there’s something you’re not telling me, alright?”
“You don’t have to explain,” said Castiel. “I agree.”
He’d never thought about Valentine’s Day.
“No,” Dean agreed. “It wasn’t all bad, though.” He smiled at his baby brother.
Dean ignored him. Cas took another look and started walking away.
Dean had been working at Dick’s Yummy Treats for two months, and he still hadn’t gotten his employee card.
Dean offered him half a shaky smile. “Yeah, I’m good.” He desperately hoped Cas wouldn't see through it.
Castiel mirrored his smile, just a little bit. “My family is going to love you. Next time, if you could not bring a gun.”
"Of course."
He yanked the knife out. Dean clenched his teeth, sucking in a forceful breath through his nostrils.
God, whoever invented socializing should have been burned at the stake.
“And about today..." Dean told him. "Seems like you were right.”
“I’m sure he left ten IPhones in there and they all rang at the same time,” he said, and Castiel shook his head.
“So you live on your own?” Asked Balthazar.
“Why me?”
“Yeah. I guess you pretty much know the rest. Though I don’t know how it would have looked on your end.”
"Have you considered taking a flight back?"
“Two weeks.”
"She could be sitting next to a non-natural monster," Dean shot back. He tapped his fingers anxiously on the armrest of his seat. An old, friendly-looking lady took the seat to his other side, by the aisle.
Cas eyed him. He returned a leveled stare.
“I, uhh.” The girls watched him attentively. “I get emotionally unavailable during the winter.”
"Just get the tickets and I'll stand behind you. Don't let her see me."
“What?”
Naturally.
“Your taste in crushes is less than ideal,” she replied.
“I hope the turkey’s alright,” Mary said. “I left it in a little too long. How did you guys sleep?” Sam and Jess nodded. She looked over at Dean.
“Do it,” he challenged. His tone wasn’t acidic; his eyes shimmered with genuine enjoyment. As if this were all just a game.
“It’s okay,” said Castiel. “You’re tired, and you just distract me more.”
“What is that supposed to mean?” He snapped back.
“School books?” He asked.
“I just-” he started, when he heard steps outside his room. “I have to go,” he said as his sister opened the door.
Rejected a second time in one evening.
Dean had said, “Nice.” But Cas hadn’t stopped looking out the window, his mouth half agape.
“Yes,” he said. It was too late to go back. “Bob.”
“By all means, leave,” Dean said dryly.
“Sure you can,” Dean said, insulted.
Phew. Easy.
He helped Dean up carefully and wrapped an arm around his waist for support.
“Prepared for what? The zombie apocalypse?”
“No.”
“Don’t drink from the punch!” He warned a group of girls that approached the drinks table. They looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
“Okay, no, this one’s the worst.”
“He works in the kitchens.”
“No one’s stopping you,” Dean muttered behind him.
“What are you doing, nerds?” Meg asked, and his fingers tore from Dean's.
“Sure," he said. "I’m taking your computer.” He sat down next to the dining table to open Dean’s laptop.
“So...” said Dean carefully. “Are we gonna talk about this?”
Castiel leaned back in his chair, coldness running through him. Bobby went on, putting into words his own thoughts.
When he got home, Dean placed his new book at the center of his desk; he wasn’t sure where else to put books that would be respectful to them. Wouldn’t offend some dead author’s ghost that would come back to haunt him. Jurassic was hardcover, and by far, the fanciest thing he owned that had a title. Though he supposed he could just assign a title to one of his pocketknives, or to the suit his dad had passed down to him a couple of years ago.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked.
That shut him up.
“We’re less than a year apart, though,” said Dean. “It’s not really... as bad as it sounds.”
“Seriously,” Dean said when Garth took his sock off and started wrapping the old cloth around his ankle.
Of course it stopped on him.
“Are you sure?”
“Does that mean you’ll eat the damn pie?”
“Everything here is gray,” he said. “Or white. Or black. So unless you don’t want bright peach, we’re going with gray.”
“It’s a good movie,” said Dean defensively.
But there it was, coming true. And in some ways it was exciting. In other ways, it wasn’t any easier than life as it was.
“Oof,” said Dean as they were walking back to the car. “Hard, isn’t it?”
"He'll come back," Meg said.
"So what's up?" She asked as they walked.
“Oh.”
The children’s books were not nearly as interesting without the guy he was trying to annoy being there for him to annoy.
She got the idea.
“Well,” said the doctor. “I’ve reviewed your father’s test results and his status after the surgery. Your father was an alcoholic,” she said, as though to confirm.
“Alright,” said Castiel, taking a step back. “See you later.”
Barely. Pressed against one another, breathless in the quiet room, backing off just as quickly.
“How’s Dean?”
“You only have one towel?”
He thought of Gordon pushing him in class, and couldn’t help wonder whether she might still stand by him if things got worse.
“What?” Dean smiled at him confusedly. “Is that why you don’t like taking your car to school?”
Castiel looked at them, and looked at the paper again, and his face turned a shade of red only slightly less embarrassingly deep than Dean’s. And then he turned around, glanced Dean up and down briefly, and vanished as abruptly as he’d appeared.
He hated that anyone should feel this way - that the public deserves an opinion about whomever they had a weakness for, whomever their stomach chose to twist at the sight of.
anywhere after a ten hour drive with one stop,” said Castiel and walked in after him.
He closed the bathroom door behind him and shut his eyes. He couldn’t get the picture out of his head: his sister in law lying in the middle of the hallway, her throat slit, and blood circling the floor around her head like a hellish halo… And then the same person again, laughing with Michael about something in the kitchen.
“Bats?” Asked Castiel. "The animals?"
“And you told me no,” Dean grumbled.
His head shot backwards.
“Movie or not, we’re going to die if we stay here.”
“Can I talk to you?” He asked. Dean followed him to a corner behind the stairs.
How and when did he get a
“Actually,” said Anna by her side. “I kind of wanted to talk to you about that.” She looked at Dean nervously.
get a cold.”
“But-“
“Butter fingers,” Dean coughed.
Then a figure appeared inside the room.
“I’ll go after him,” said Castiel.
“I don’t get to react?”
“Yep.” Dean threw his bag on the floor behind the register and hopped onto the only chair in the store. Cas didn’t seem to want it anyway. “Had a telephone interview yesterday with this engineering school upstate.” He ran a hand through his hair and leaned back, watching, satisfied, as Cas’ eyes followed the movement. He desperately wanted to be the Cool Work Guy in Cas’ eyes. “Of course I could still mess it up if I really fuck up my grades this year, but it’s looking good.”
“He's in a boarding school,” Dean continued. “He doesn't belong in this dump. But I have to provide for him. That's why I had to...” He stopped, looking away. Castiel hoped he would continue, reveal another part of the mystery his past seemed to be, but he didn’t. Castiel didn’t push.
It couldn’t be Cas. Could it? He’d left Meg’s house half an hour ago. It felt like half a week.
“Can we stop talking about this?” Castiel asked sharply.
Castiel looked at the child. “Sure,” he said unwillingly. He took her from Dean’s arms, grabbing her by the armpits, a foot away from his body. Dean grimaced at him.
He took Dean’s hand, and between heavy breaths, he said as urgently as he possibly could: “Come with me.”
“Oh, it’s not a trap,” said the demon sweetly, and Dean's mouth twisted. “I’m going to kill him, and there’s nothing you can do about that.”
“So, are you Spaghetti Guy?” His brother asked Dean.
“See?” Castiel looked at her. “He’s trying to focus on work.”
“What are you doing here?” Asked the girl.
“I dunno,” Dean said, but then his eyes narrowed. “Wait a minute. Isn’t that the lady we saw killing monsters at the fair?”
Cas stretched his neck to peek around the tree. “I don’t usually mind,” he said. His shoulder pressed harder against Dean’s in this position. Dean concentrated on the knees. “But I try to spend my weekends without accusatory stares, if I can.”
“Alright,” said Castiel, smiling now. It was a relief that Dean didn’t seem too eager to have eye contact, because his own gaze was coming off a little softer than he’d intended on showing.
Cas looked at the lint skeptically.
“Yeah.”
“You’d rather wear pajamas,” Castiel summarized. “Fine. But I need to study first.”
"How'd you do?" Claire asked while they were getting off the plane.
“Cas.” Dean put his palms together. “I would never, ever, tell you if I cried at a Celine Dion concert.” He laughed. “But, hey… Thanks.”
Castiel didn’t answer. He listened to Dean’s laugh and to the sound of his steps after a few moments, as the awkward silence settled in.
Dean shot him a nasty look, but it wasn’t as rude – or as effortlessly playful – as it should have been. His heart just wasn’t in it.
After dinner, Sam volunteered to wash the dishes. Dean started following him to the sink, but Castiel stopped him.
“Well,” said Dean. “That’s where hunters come in.”
It was almost six in the morning, and he was too tired to think clearly. He kneeled down before the bed and shook Cas.
“Do you really have self-respect?” Dean asked with a smile.
Together.
Dean faltered, unsure what to say. He coughed unconvincingly. “I’m sick.”
And maybe it was April snapping at him when he’d hoped she’d understand. Or maybe the sight of his father passed out by the kitchen table this morning. Or maybe he just wanted to enjoy the sun on his skin for one goddamned day. Either way – he felt it. The word vomit.
“I just…” And he had this whole speech in his head, but now it sounds so incredibly silly that he finds himself at a loss.
In the end, the Flood came before Cas did. They made for a hasty departure, just like John had promised, and as the water covered the earth and engulfed ordinary life, no one looked back. No one except Dean.
“I guess she’s more of a ‘throw knives at pictures of people for fun’ kind of person, while Dean is more ‘eat French fries in bed and yell at the Bachelorette when she makes bad decisions’. They have very different interests.”
“Ye-llo,” comes Dean’s voice from the speaker, and Castiel’s thoughts freeze for a moment from just the sound of his voice.
Castiel turned to him. "I don't get you. You need to study too, now."
“She said Christo, Cas. She was checking if we were demons!”
It took him breaking eye contact and a downwards glance to realize that Dean had stopped, holding his knife less than an inch from the base of Castiel’s thumb.
“She was trying to seduce me,” Castiel explained. “Thanks for the help.”
“I'd do that for free.”
Because Dean never forgot to pick him up. And because the last time he’s heard from him was that public bathroom text at noon, and it’s been almost eight hours since. He climbed the stairs to their apartment and opened the door, turning on the lights.
“Alright,” Castiel replied. He weighed his options for a moment. He didn’t want to embarrass Dean, or put him in an uncomfortable position, and surely, there were two dozen things he already knew about him which answering wouldn’t constitute a challenge…
“Way to act normal, guys,” said Kevin. “Don’t mind them,” he said to Dean.
“Oh,” said Dean, and his face fell, just a little. It was somewhat of a sore spot between them. The recent future was a topic they chronically avoided; in almost every scenario, Castiel would be spending the next three years at least an hour away from his hometown, and he wasn’t going to ask Dean to come with him. No, it was too much, too soon.
“So you don’t really know,” said Donna.
“I don’t want to see a doctor.”
Wait. That wasn’t his name. He’d meant to say his name. “I’m… Dean. I am Dean.”
“Are you alright?” Dean’s eyes roamed over his face.
At least he seemed to be sleeping soundly.
“Nothing,” he blurted out. “No... Nothing. What about you?”
“She was my friend, and she was good.”
The days passed. Charlie came and went. Sometimes she spent the night somewhere else. He didn’t ask.
“I'd rather that you breathed.”
“Don’t worry,” he said. “I’m not... like them.”
"Look at the girl," Castiel hissed at him. Dean took another look, and turned around, shook.
“It’s old,” said Castiel. Dean sat down in the couch and pulled him onto it.
, and he grunted.
and wrinkling his nose, because that was the only thing he could think of that didn’t make him want to cry.
“Well,” Dean announced when he got into work. “I am officially leaving.”
“Tell me what?” Dean said, his throat dry as hay straws. This was bad. This was really bad.
The campus was weirdly serene. There were paths of gravel and green grass and trees everywhere, carrying leaves in every color of autumn.
“So you’re not in college,” said Michael.
He shook himself out of his schoolwork-avoiding fantasy. “Yeah.”
Castiel shook his head lightly. “A what.” His voice was rough.
He was engaged.
“Yeah. And with this whole resurrection thing, I’ve been thinking... I’ve been thinking about God.”
Dean let out a deep sigh. Didn’t answer for a few seconds. Then, with some effort,
“Say no more,” Castiel interrupted. He reached for his shoes and clothes in a quick motion and disappeared into Dean’s washroom. Behind him, he could hear the front door to Dean’s room creak.
"Yeah."
Cas was devoted to his decision to leave his fate in Dean’s hands, and he did everything Dean told him to do. But he grew irritable and surly about it with each day passing, and in the past few days, it didn’t even seem like he wanted to talk to Dean at all.
“I… uh, I wrote it down,” Dean said, searching his pockets. He pulled out a crumpled piece of paper and straightened it. “I need to have my eyes closed, and, uh…” He looked at the paper. “Sense the air or something. Feel the wind on my face.” He grimaced. “I’m not sure. I just joined this class a week ago." He looked up at Cas and realized he wasn’t really listening. His lips pursed in one of his not-quite-a-smile expressions at something clutched in Dean’s hand. Dean almost expected him to burst out laughing, but he didn’t.
Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed. “Where’s his process?”
The crewmen threw a rope ladder down from the deck and waited for Dean to come up with their knives in their hands. Dean smiled charmingly, apologetically – and blinked.
5:02: "If you crash the car I'm gonna puke my cheeseburger all over it, so lay off the gas, man."
Someone dropped onto the bench beside him, and he shoved the note into his pocket.
Dean looked up at him. “What?”
He was in Dean’s living room. Someone had covered him with a blanket – the same person, presumably, who was snoring lightly on the other couch.
“I’m already going to jail, ain’t I?” The man shoved another breadstick into his mouth. “At least I’ll sit there with a full stomach.” His voice was muffled by the salty delights that filled his mouth.
Mary didn’t say anything. Dean heard the tap closing and imagined her putting a hand around Cas’ shoulders, giving him that comforting look that Dean’s bruises and heartbreaks grew up with.
It sort of was. In an adorable kind of way. Castiel wished he could focus on that, only Dean’s hand was still resting on his shoulder, and, well, it’s practically common knowledge that your best friend who you’ve known for four months and is honestly better looking than any best friend you’ve had before touching your shoulder is a very distracting thing, no matter who you are. So distracting, that Castiel’s fingers were stiff when he gave Dean his phone back.
“They all want us dead,” Cas said.
"What?"
Not a moment later, he was replaced with another rider. Azazel was approaching Dean on his horse, and when he got close enough, he pushed.
They drank quietly. Castiel watched the sunlit room. He'd never seen the light hit it so brightly. He'd never been here before, at nine thirty in the morning, leaning against the counter and drinking coffee next to Dean. And he was pretty sure he could get used to this.
Dean drove the first four hours. Then, he stopped for gas, and they switched.
He watched his fierce pirate company, looking ten years younger as he stared down at the sea.
“Did you have a close relationship with your brother before it happened?”
“I… wasn’t supposed to?”
Dean swallowed, cleared his throat. The chandelier above them swayed. The room seemed to get a touch colder.
"Yeah."
This was the address. Which was weird, because it was Cas’ house, but at the same time it wasn’t.
Castiel considered his answer, then leaned forward and spoke quietly. “If this goes wrong...” He’d never discussed this with Dean, not with words. But it had always been there as a silent agreement between them. They never went together on hunts that were more than the casual vampire-around-the-corner, ever since they took Claire in.
He patted Cas' hand and walked back to the vending machine.
“Did I ever tell you I’ve got a thing for brunettes?”
The video is forty seconds long, a bit from the song playing in the background, and on the screen six words fly one after another, each hovering dramatically before disappearing, like they do in movie trailers:
.” And his smile was back. “Aww. That’s sweet.”
“When am I not?” Said Meg. “But fine. See you, losers.”
Dean shrugged. “I don’t really feel like hurting anyone,” he said. “I don’t see how that helps anything.”
“My family… I- I might have let on to my mom that we were dating.”
“Shut up,” Dean laughed and nudged him with a foot.
“Yeah, that’s weird." The way Dean was looking at him made him believe, for the first time this week, that things might just work out.
“What am I searching for?” He yelled over to Castiel. “The skyline, again?”
Dean tried to coordinate staring at him helplessly and mentally kicking his brain into producing some kind of answer.
Maybe he wasn’t ready to leave Dean.
Behind them, a quiet gasp at Dean’s defeat reminded Castiel that they had an audience. He wondered why none of the crewmembers has come to Dean’s assist yet.
He hesitated. “We’re friends, right?”
“Like the vampire?” Balthazar raised an eyebrow.
He was back with a few bags full of daggers, pistols and smaller bags that made soft hissing sounds when they shifted. The crew paired up, each team arming itself with Sam’s supplies before he left to scour the surface of the island. Dean gave his people some final instructions, and they were on their way. He took with Castiel a crammy-looking tunnel – partly because no one else would choose to pair up with the dubious stranger, Castiel felt, but he didn’t mind. He rathered being stuck with Dean in a dark and narrow passage than with anyone else. He wished suddenly for the small, cheerful Charlie, and for her relentless chatter to fill in the quiet.
Everything was so quiet in the middle of the night, it almost felt like the rest of the world didn’t exist.
"Later," Dean muttered.
“You’ve been lovely,” Cas said. “I’m feeling just fine here.”
“Dude,” said Meg. “Do you honestly think this guy is a vampire?”
He watched Castiel for a long moment. Then he let go of his hand. Perhaps, if Castiel had cried out or let a shiver run through his body, perhaps if his face distorted with terror, he would have remained thumbless already. He hadn’t the faintest idea what was going through Dean’s mind, but when Dean looked at him, he knew it was something in his own eyes that made Dean’s movement falter.
seemed like logical reasoning at the time.
He fucked up.
“Coordinates,” he finally said, looking at Castiel for confirmation. His eyes were just as luminous in the dark as the inked circles on the page, and full of an almost tangible fascination. Castiel lost grip of his thoughts for a second.
“Give me your guy,” said the demon. “And I’ll give you mine.”
So, he supposed there were some things they knew about each other, after all. Cas’ last words were said without venom. In fact, he was looking away now, pressing his lips together like he was making an effort to stay angry.
“No,” he said. “I don’t know where my fiancé is.” And now he’d made it sound like this was his child, which it wasn’t. He supposed though, for the moment, they were in it together.
“Who is it?”
“Merry Christmas, everyone,” said Bobby. “I’m glad we all get a chance to sit around the same table every once in a while.”
“Why is Hannah looking for you?” he asked.
“You’ve been asleep for three days.”
“Too intimidating?” Ruby laughed. “Please.”
“Okay,” said Castiel slowly. “Go where?”
“We can be adults about this.”
Dean smiled at him a little. “You have.”
But a few minutes later, after Charlie left to adjust chairs around the shop, Meg’s expression softened.
Or maybe he was wrong. Maybe Dean would cut his fingers off. Maybe he was as crazy as Castiel first believed him to be – crazy, or driven by avarice.
“And don’t give yourself a hard time, Dean. You’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness. Just for your own.”
Ten more minutes, and they were set to go.
“Get a girlfriend and you’ll change your mind,” Charlie said.
Surrounding him and the sworded man were about two dozen people… if he could describe them as such. They were wearing tattered clothes and black tricorns, holding backswords and daggers, all looking at him with befuddlement that didn’t match their exterior appearance at all.
“Not all of it.” Garth brought up a hand for a bloody thumbs-up, and Castiel moved for him to enter. “So you guys are hunters?” Garth asked, sitting down a little too heavy on a dining chair. Castiel went to the bathroom and collected some bandages and an antiseptic.
They looked down at the street quietly, a few floors below them. It wasn’t the comfortable sort of silence.
“How’re you doing, kid?”
An hour later - and they were nearly done. He was collecting the trash into bags while Dean went over his closet.
Dean, but maybe… Past him? He turned around and scanned the horizon – and as promised, two small bumps rose from it in the distance. Dean turned back to the creature.
“Just do it.” But just as he said it, Naomi appeared stepping down the stairs, looking utterly shaken. She looked around, spotted Michael, and rushed over to him.
Dean looked at her and shook his head, but he was smiling.
Dean looked around like everything was magic. Castiel eyed him.
“So you never dressed up since,” said Dean when Castiel leaned back in his chair.
When they looked at the bed again, Cas' hand rested on Jack’s arm and he was talking to the boy with urgency. He seemed to be very much awake.
“The escape room at the shopping center,” Castiel answered. Dean huffed through his nose.
Dean shifted and leaned a shoulder against his, and hummed at the hot mug he was holding.
“It does seem like an adequate human…” She mused. “How is the King’s plan coming along?”
"Hey," he said. "Can you come over?"
“I might have replaced the word she used with ‘cute’ in your benefit.”
To Charlie’s credit, she picked up his phone and made sure it was alright before placing it back in his hand. To her discredit, the crashing wasn’t exactly accidental.
Dean’s chin lifted a touch. “Actually, I do.” Here was one thing no one could take from him: he knew his way around his yummy treats. “I can list you every kind of pie to ever exist. Alphabetically.”
She wouldn’t stop until she exposed them, and she wasn’t backing down.
And now, for the first time this morning, Cas looked at him – really looked. “What about us?” He asked, and his voice sounded just as carefully neutral as Dean’s. And it almost felt like they both knew they were thinking about the same thing.
“’Kay,” said Dean. “Text me.”
But he sat up with a grunt. His improvised ring necklace slid out of his shirt, and he tucked it back in, along with Sam’s amulet. “What’s going on?”
“So what’s the assignment?” Cas asked. He didn’t seem very impressed with their surroundings. Maybe he’d been here before. Maybe he went here every weekend. It would just be him and the birds. He’d probably like that; he seemed like a weirdo, even though he kept looking at Dean like
“Exactly,” he said.
The next Sunday Dean woke up at 7 a.m., pulled on a clean shirt and practically skipped his way to work. After a week of maneuvering between a constantly bitter and resentful household, tedious schoolwork and – God help him – flower arranging classes, he’d almost managed to forget all his grievances toward Dick’s.
“Now, Cas, why would you say that?” The Dr. leaned her chin on her hand again, except this time she looked a few shades more exhausted.
"It's nothing," said Castiel in an already-apologetic voice.
Michael lived in a classic picket-fence house in the suburbs. If Dean knew him, he would call him a ‘basic bitch’. His wife was growing apples and lemons in the front yard, and there were colorful wind vanes and children’s toys on the porch. They went up the stairs to the porch, and Chuck rang the doorbell.
Dean shook his head dismissively. “Sam and I are all we’ve got,” he said. “So it’s different. Kind of an… ‘Us against the world’ situation, you know?” He huffed out a laughter, but it was humorless.
“I’ll figure something out,” he said.
“I don’t see how I could be accused of anything, Rowena,” he grumbled. “My own blade is being held against my throat, and I am every possible type of naked.”
"Oh," April said when she looked up. "Hey, Dean." And she smiled the fakest smile Castiel had ever seen. "What's up? Came here alone?" She tilted sideways to look behind him, and Castiel ducked his chin into his coat collar and turned around.
“Yes, I do.”
to see you,” said the demon.
“Oh, it’s awkward,” said Gabriel. “Jesus on a candy bar, it’s awkward.”
“Thank you,” he said again.
“Cas, wait.”
Dean shook his head. “No, man. If anything, it's the other way around.” He smiled and pulled Castiel closer. “You're my anchor,” he said into Castiel’s shoulder.
“I’m not taking Barney the fifty year old dinosaur!”
Dean’s reply came in alarmingly fast.
He ripped a page off one of his notebooks and made a list: How to Spend the Summer. He wrote down in the list:
?” She put her card into the little machine, waited for the beep and pushed the doors open.
“Never calling my brother again...” he muttered, and looked up. “What’s this?” Dean wasn’t holding coffee. He was holding a baby. A human baby.
He exchanged looks with Dean.
“It’s midterms this week,” he said. “Everyone is losing sleep.”
Cas: don’t worry about it. I have a spare one in my locker.
“So... I dunno. Wouldn’t it bother you to be around her constantly? To take your shirt off in front of her?” He asked. “It would bother me.”
Or maybe it wasn’t, and Castiel was reading too much into it. He couldn’t really know when they weren’t talking about it.
"Yeah, he's just fine." He eyed Dean. "You alright, there?"
“You’re worth more than you think,” she said gently. “Most kids are. And no one’s going to say it to you again, so you better remember it. Don’t sell yourself short.” She patted his shoulder. “Dismissed.”
“Great,” Castiel managed from within his tight clutch. “Because I already bought tickets months ago.”
“What are you doing?” He asked. Why was he asking this? “What are you doing here?”
Dean leaned back in his chair, and Castiel turned to look out the window again. He rested his head against it, watching the trees fly by. When he was very small – four, or maybe five – his older brother used to take him to watch fish in the lake. He knew the names of all the trees and the plants and the little creatures hiding inside the ground. It was magic: sitting on a rock by the lake, swinging his feet above the ground, listening to nothing but the sky and the water. Watching the fish swim about underwater and feeling the sun on his skin. In those moments he made an effort to forget everything he possibly could except for the gentle whoosh of the water.
Castiel tuned them out, chewing on green beans distractedly. He wondered what Dean was doing now, and whether his three-person home vacation was too awkward. One of the girls banged her fork on the table and proclaimed, “Hael!” – presumably the babysitter's name.
“Trying to balance things out,” he grumbled. “I still owe him some good while of ‘being an assbutt’ for us to be even.”
“I’m a hunter,” said Dean, like his conclusion was obvious. “Our life span doesn’t usually reach the point of...”
“Rewind,” said Charlie. If she was taken aback by what she’d read, she didn’t show it. “Tell me what you did.”
Was this something he needed to start thinking about? Moving on?
“You can,” he said, “But you shouldn’t.”
"Sure you don't," she said, and shrugged. “How about an emotional support lesbian?”
What he was, was Dean’s type.
“I’m not,” Dean said defensively.
“What are you guys doing here?”
“At the fair?” If he was still so very drunk, it must mean he’s gone to bed fairly recently. He coughed, and his breath smelled of liquor. “Cas, it’s six in the damned morning. Could you move to your bed so I can get some sleep?” Dean pled.
“What exactly do you call ‘flirting’?” Dean asked. “I’m not sure our definitions match.”
“No,” he said, “I know it’s not a lot to go on, Bobby, but I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”
Gabriel eyed their older brother. “Oh, would you
“Yeah. Come on.” Hannah pulled him from the desk to sit on the floor beside her. “And stop checking your phone every five seconds.”
Dean glanced at him, and Castiel knew what he wanted to say:
Castiel just shook his head slowly with disapproval.
“That can’t be real,” said Castiel.
Only he didn’t seem glad at all. His eyes jumped nervously to Dean and back to his plate as everyone started eating.
"You know he misses you."
“Because, you know,” said Garth, “We’re here for you.”
“No, you were right,” he said knowingly. “Telling your crush you like them is never a bad idea.”
“Me too,” said Kevin.
“Yeah,” Dean said. He squinted at Castiel in the dark and – cautiously – rested a hand on his knee. “My mom insisted that you slept on the sofa instead of in my room, so I was protesting.” He yawned again.
“Oh,” said Dean. “Well... what are you gonna do about that?”
Dean’s eyes roamed the list, and his heart sank when he saw she was right. He didn’t ask for creative writing. He didn’t want it. In fact, the last thing he wanted was a class designed to fish his private thoughts out of his head.
Most of Dean’s crew accepted Castiel, trusting that their captain knew what he was doing; but some were suspicious, eyeing Castiel whenever he was near them, and eyeing Dean just as suspiciously.
“So I owe you an explanation,” he said. Castiel sat down next to him.
“You didn’t tell them, did you?”
“Something bad is about to happen.”
"Thank god," Dean muttered, but then there was rocking and pulling down in angles that didn't feel right.
“Shapeshifter,” said Dean. “It’s killing your family and then wearing its skin pretending to be them.”
Castiel couldn’t deny that the prom hall was beautiful. There were no extravagant decorations – just fairy lights everywhere. On the trees outside. On the walls. Even on the doors. It only contributed to the magical feeling of school finally being over.
“I’ll find him,” he said, pushing past Hannah. “Thanks.”
“What’s up, bitches?” She said and knelt down to give Dean a hug, looking at Castiel over his shoulder. “Is that him?”
“You’re right,” said Dean, shaking his head. “So,
“A spy settled into town not too long ago,” spoke Rowena. “From the kingdom of Far, Far Away.”
Dean turned away. He didn’t know how to respond to that, though his heart seemed to be reacting hard and fast enough for Cas to hear.
Castiel stared at him.
He couldn’t wait to move out.
“Yep. Get used to it.”
“How have you been?” He asked carefully when they started driving. Chuck nodded unconvincingly. Another moment passed.
Crowley nods his head. Dean starts speaking about double standards and society’s expectations, and Castiel watches his lips distractedly. The words float around in his mind like a fog, blurring every other thought.
“I think it was a bad idea.”
“What monster?” he asked and turned around.
“FBI,” said Chuck doubtfully.
"Dean."
. It’s really cute how you wanted to impress me. Wow.”
“I had letters,” he said reluctantly, working to keep his voice calm and untroubled. “From Edlund’s diary. The garrison found them, and tried to decipher the map. They… they gave up trying after they couldn’t figure out what the numbers meant.” He saw Cowley’s eyes narrow, his mouth opening again, and he spoke quickly.
“I’m gonna die,” he murmured when Castiel arrived at the bottom of the tunnel, where he was lying on the ground. “Oh, God.”
God, he missed this big buffoon.
“I’d like the truth, yeah.”
He was fine with that.
“Novak?” Dean stopped him. “Aren’t those...” They both turned to look at the kid.
Dean and him exchanged glances. It was definitely the woman from the fair. Much more smiley, and not covered in blood, but it was her.
"Dead?"
“How… How did you end up on a military ship, getting shot at by five men, before you jumped onto the Impala?” Dean asked, but it was weak and halfhearted. His stare was skipping around the room, eyeing his men’s drawn out weapons.
“I’d love that.”
“Oh,” he said.
“Haven’t gotten my card yet,” Dean answered, letting carelessness into his voice, coloring it with nonchalance, a perfect antithesis to Cas’ gravelly, grounded sound.
Dean felt a sting in his chest, partly for her crude accusation, and partly because of the hurt in her voice. He hadn’t realized just how fondly she felt about that little weird dude.
April stared at him blankly. “What?”
“You’re an odd one, y’know,” Dean said perkily as he sat down beside Castiel, resting a bandage and a bottle of iodine on the floor between them. “Gimme your arm.”
The doorbell rang while he was making tea in the kitchen, and he waddled to the door to open it. Dean stood on the porch, and took him in as he opened the door: the heavy blanket around his shoulders, the mug in his hands, his cat pajama pants.
“Yeah?” Dean asked, huffing out a laugh at his expression. He slumped onto the floor with a smooth motion and crossed his legs, tugging on Castiel’s hand. How graceful and careless was his fall all at the same time. Castiel sat down next to him carefully.
He closes his eyes, and the darkness deepens. He kicks his damp socks off his feet, pulls the blanket over his head, and falls asleep.
Chuck raised his eyebrows.
"I won't."
“I just had a really weird conversation with my boss,” he said. “And then I quit.”
“Uh...”
Dean shrugged. “Pretty much.”
At that, all of Dean’s defenses dropped. “You did?”
“He’s a vampire,” said Castiel quietly, though no one around them seemed to be listening.
Back in the kitchen, Dean was fussing around his injured brother like an anxious mama hen.
Dean checked his watch, and looked at him. “If we hurry, there’s time for both.”
“I doubt I’m invited,” Dean said without looking up from his phone.
>Forget it, Dean. I just… needed to get it off my chest, I guess. And I needed to do it in person. Never mind, now.
He wasn’t going to win this one. He sat down on the floor, right by her bed. “Do you want to hear a secret?”
Dean stared at him. “Ehhhh…”
“No,” Cas said simply. Not that Dean expected a different answer. But it was worth asking.
“I guess...” Castiel started, but Dean cleared his throat and pulled him aside.
“I can kick your ass with one arm tied to my back.”
“Female?” Meg offered.
“More or less. I mean, when do I ever really tell the truth...” He chuckled, and glanced at Castiel’s unamused expression. “Except with you. I always tell you the truth.”
“I’m going to have to end our session now,” said Donna. “But you seem pretty solid, you guys. You don’t seem to need my help to resolve your issues.”
“Still?” He said. “We haven't dated in two years.”
Castiel's eyebrows furrowed. “What kind of say do you want?”
“Read the entire book and see where we are at around four a.m.?”
Cas rushed over to Garth’s side, and Dean limped to join them. With some effort, Garth got to his feet.
“’Sup,” said Meg. Her eyes jumped from one of them to the other. “What? Don’t give me that look. I waited for you to be done fighting before I came over.”
“That's alright,” Cas said. “I yelled back. What are first fights worth if they don't have the most embarrassing timing?”
“Okay,” said Dean.
No, wait; it wasn’t just his face that was glowing. It was his expression. And like this, he looked more beautiful than any girl Castiel had ever seen.
Dean let out a snort. “Climb each other?” He said. “What, Yertle the Turtle style?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Either one of them was going crazy, or Dean was suspiciously good at masking his feelings.
“You know how to fight?” Cas’ voice rose a little with intrigue.
Castiel squinted at him. “You want to watch Legally Blonde, don’t you?”
The coach clapped her hands together, and everyone filed into the locker room. Dean peeled his shirt off and shoved it into his backpack, putting on a fresh one. A couple of guys murmured something behind him. He hauled his bag onto one shoulder, catching a glimpse of Cas tugging his shirt off and letting it fall onto the bench. He looked pretty good. Dean’s mind flashed back to the first week of school, when he’d looked at Cas through the window of Dick’s with his coworkers, and he felt another surge of insecurity. He couldn’t tell why, out of a room full of half-naked guys he didn’t spare a second thought, this person always made him feel so self-conscious.
“So, the communication thing ain’t working.”
“Oh. Thanks,” he said. How thoughtful.
“I don’t doubt that,” Dean let out, his voice colored a somewhat acidic tinge.
Well – he knew that inviting his evil arch enemy to his house for Christmas wasn’t going to be a walk in the park, but he never let himself think of the details too much. Now, he put his cup down on his dresser and closed the door behind them. And here was another thing that hadn’t occurred to him: before, every moment alone with Cas was torture. Now it was a gift from the heavens, because it meant he didn’t have to pretend they were smooching.
“I won’t laugh, you know.” They were at the door to his room now, and Dean walked in and started changing into a lighter shirt. Neither of them bothered with turning on the light. “Whatever it is.”
“Can I ask you something?”
Dean swam towards him, trying to kiss him, but Cas pushed him away. He dove, and came back with some seaweed, uprooted so roughly that seawater-soaked dirt still clung to its roots.
Dean knelt down to read a title on a box.
"Alright," said Dean. "Stay behind me." He started humming.
“You know, he won’t shut up about you.”
“Dean.”
“I was just thinking.” She clutched her notebooks very tightly. “Prom is in a week, and...”
He wondered how Dean was with his little brother. If he was bossy, or annoying, or arrogant, like Castiel’s siblings were.
Dean dropped a duffel bag on the floor. “This is Sammy... Is this your family?” He asked, peeking into the living room.
They sat on the couch, holding hands in silence for a long time, because neither of them was willing to let go.
“If I had to,” said Dean, “You have to.”
"Later," Dean asserted and knelt down again. He wrapped Cas' good arm around his own shoulders and helped him up.
Dean sighed. “I didn’t want to go to the party. But I didn’t want my friends to give me shit for it, so I told them I’d ask you. I planned on you saying no, of course, because why wouldn’t you? But then you said yes, and I had to go.”
"Never getting on a plane again as long as I'm alive," he answered, and walked toward the exit.
“Nothing.”
“That would be nice.” He was saying:
“How do you feel about it?” Asked Ms. Mills.
“Yes. Business school. Dean is a salad-loving businessman.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Crowley made a gesture for him to hurry up. “So was everyone. I’m more interested in any special skills.”
“This is real life. It doesn’t get more real life than a demonic hologram almost bashing my head into goo.”
“I dunno,” said Dean. “Moving to a house with an actual bedroom. Maybe getting a dog. Growing...” He paused. “Growing old together.” It was almost a question. Dean was saying:
He turned around – and there was Meg.
Dean laughed at his expression. “Gotta love ‘em.”
“Of course,” he frowned. “Wh- did you think I wouldn’t find my way back? Come on, you guys. I’ve spent years roaming big city streets while you were on a boat in the middle of the ocean. Give me some credit.”
“No, no, no. You don’t tell people ‘hello’ in response to a ‘hey’.”
“I like that one,” said Meg, reading the label of an almost eight-by-eight feet painting of five naked women. “’
“What?” He said from between his teeth.
Inside, perched on a couch, were Gabriel and Balthazar.
“No phones during dinner,” said his mother.
employee leaned forward. “Can you guys move over? There's other people waiting in line.”
Castiel nodded, his eyes following the light and shadow dance on Dean’s face as tree leaves moved around them. “Thank you, Dean.”
“Hold on,” said Dean towards the end of the play. The lead roles were standing very close to each other, caught in a heated duet. “Is this supposed to happen?” He asked when they kissed.
“How is it already eight?” It sounded just a little bit forced. “You probably have other stuff to do.” He sat up with a grunt, stretching.
“Yep. Ben and Jerry’s Cookie Dough.”
“You know, Dean’s a good guy,” he said. Dean kicked him under the table, but he continued. “He works as a teacher’s assistant at my old high school. That’s actually how we met.”
“Do you really not see it?”
“That’s not really a question,” said Dean.
"Well, you stole my blanket."
Dean nodded. “Read the entire book and see where we are at around four a.m.”
“Yeah,” said Sam, and there was uncertainty in his voice. Not unsure of his words – but rather afraid of Castiel’s reaction. Sam was saying:
“I can’t believe it worked,” he breathed.
“Thought so,” his brother muttered, and turned back to his desk.
“Oh.” Dean watched the table between them. “Yeah.” And they fell silent.
“Naomi,” the teacher provided. Dean huffed.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked, his forehead creasing.
Dean stared at him blankly. “Wake up?”
Dean dropped his head into his hands. “You’re terrible.”
And then someone leaned in from the row behind them, clapping a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Charlie raised her eyebrows at him.
Midterms were over weeks ago. It was warm in Dean’s apartment. The afternoon light was disappearing through the window, and Castiel had absolutely nothing better to do than stare at Dean’s ceiling and feel his own heart beat. Apparently, Dean didn’t have much else to do, either.
“No offense,” Cas went on. “But I really have nothing at all to get back to. So if you don’t mind…”
"Fine."
Claire nodded, wide eyed.
“Successfully?” Dean looked at him with half a smile. “Not quite.”
“I just came here to grab some... balls.”
she sounded taken aback. “Dean, I wanted you to make friends with him, not make out with him behind a bush.”
“Why are you not sleeping?”
Castiel moved his food around his plate. “It’s harder than it seems,” he said.
“I know. I think… I think maybe we could climb.”
That was, until he got to the shop, and was forcefully reminded.
“I’ll check later,” he answered without looking up from his workbook.
“First time for everything.” Garth raised his eyebrows.
“No, not at all.” He paused for a moment. “Why would I be upset? You only used me and lied to me, but it’s all good. We’re good. I’m good.” He cleared his throat. “Excuse me. I’m going to… go somewhere else now.”
Sam’s eyes jumped nervously to Castiel and back to his plate. “I’ve got nothing,” he said. “Dean?”
Dean cursed under his breath and turned the other direction, beginning to swim for his life. He found that he could swim in impressive speed, his tail allowing him to gracefully glide across the sea, and dive and ascend inside the water with the agility of a real fish. He rose to the surface and glided across it, parting the water as he swam through it, and looked back. The creature was a hundred times bigger than him, and most certainly faster, but it hung back. Dean stopped, and the feel of the wind in his hair subsided. He examined the animal, and it examined him back.
He shook his head. “Everyone likes to be the little spoon,” he said hollowly, and turned his back to the darkened room. “It makes you feel safe.”
He went into bed.
“Yes, I did,” said Meg.
"She's a baby," he said. He could hear the harsh edges of Dean's voice mirrored in his own. "We hijacked a baby."
Dean kept walking, and didn’t nod back.
“I’d like you to evaluate yourself,” she said when he sat down in front of her. Her voice was softer than usual. “How do you think you did this year?”
Dean tried to focus on spelling
“Yeah. Anyway, we could maybe spend this one with mine?”
“It was a matter of seconds,” Dean shrugged him off, his chin rising.
“Good.” And in the most casual tone he could muster: “I’ll bring Dean.”
"Just a quick trip to the principal's office," Dean answered. His smile had an edge.
“And there’s a blank space tomorrow morning.” Dean grinned. “Seems like the fake Couple’s Therapist business isn’t so profitable.”
He headed for the wheel, but a hand on his shoulder stopped him.
They hit a pothole, and Cas clenched his teeth.
Cas’ eyes were on him, examining him in a guarded kind of way. Waiting to see what he would do, Dean realized when someone groaned and said,
“Nowhere to run,” the colonel continued, gesturing with head at the open sea behind Castiel’s back. Castiel glanced backwards out of instinct.
Dean eyed him. “What is it?” He asked. He could see in Cas’ eyes there was more.
“Four months?” Castiel's voice rose. “Why did no one tell me?”
He looked around him, and sighed.
See, a couple of months ago, Dean fucked up. He’d been working with Cas for almost a year, and although they never saw each other outside of work, and most of their shifts at the store were shared with at least one or two more employees, being stuck in a room together for seven hours several times a week had its effects. Specifically, it had its effects on Dean and on the way his chest tightened whenever Cas was close by. They'd been alone and bored on an afternoon shift, and the conversation strayed, and before Dean knew it he was avoiding questions like “What do you mean by ‘embarrassing’?” and “So there is someone you like?”
10:12: "I'm sure he's fine. He said it himself, he just needed a ride."
He looked down at Dean, and shook his shoulder. “Hey. You should get back home.”
“Ghost,” Dean answered shortly, holding the torch a little further away from his body. He was stepping right before Castiel now, sweeping the tunnel with his eyes as it sloped downwards. Small gravel moved and squeaked under their boots as they followed the descending path. “You kill it by salting and burning the bones. Since we aren’t likely to run into any bones in this narrow butthole – you make it go away with salt, or with iron. Here.” He stopped walking to dig into his pocket and throw Castiel a bag of salt. Then he got a crowbar out of his burlap bag and handed it to Castiel as well.
“April.” Maybe if he played dead she would leave. But she already saw he was alive. Crap.
“Aw, man.”
"I found the Nephilim," said Cas. It didn't sound like he was in a rush. His voice sounded strained. "And the Devil."
“Ugh!” He checks the Wi-Fi connection. It’s gone. The laptop makes a little sound, and a notification reads:
“I don’t know what that means.”
letting me lead you blindfolded through the trees in a remote location.” His voice wasn’t taunting, or even vaguely thoughtful. He sounded almost nervous. Like he was the one trying to impress, wanting to be liked, and not the other way around, the way Dean had felt it was from the moment they met.
“Right.” Dean made an awkward finger-guns-like motion. “My bad.”
“Gotta let it sit,” Dean said.
Dean turned around and watched her go. “What just happened?”
“Hello,” Dean said back, looking him over with suspicion. He thought about scowling, or even simply walking away without another word. Something about this guy brought out in him the urge to be exasperating. But he didn’t want to be making enemies in town so soon. His mother would be furious.
“But it’s serious.” It was part assertion, part question. He nodded tightly.
“I don’t care about books,” came Dean’s automatic reply. He studied Cas’ face for a sign of scorn, but there was none. He really didn’t mind paying 14.99 for a practical stranger just because they’d looked excited. Meg and Hannah and everyone who seemed to try their damnest to stay away from him…
They ate in silence. Castiel tried to focus on his food and deter her from thinking to make conversation. He tried to ignore the fact that he couldn't recall ever having been alone in the same room with her.
