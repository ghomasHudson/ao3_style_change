“Sherlock,” John says with a flat almost-pleasantness, “what the hell are you doing?”
he typed, still grinning.
John hasn’t risen to the bait, but Sherlock has heard something just under the surface of John’s words nonetheless. Now he’s compelled to tick up the corners with his fingernails, to peel back the main layer and explore what’s underneath. Something’s the matter with John, and maybe,
John thought he could hear Sherlock’s voice from very far away.
At half-four, everything is stored out of sight, and Sherlock is rinsing the last of the ink stains from his fingers, while pointedly ignoring the dishes in the kitchen sink, when John bustles in. He’s animated, already talking while removing his coat and nudging the door closed with his foot.  Sherlock skims John’s words, identifying the upbeat tempo and quick phrasing as evidence that he’s had good day at the clinic. Even John’s grousing about working through lunch sounds jovial, conversational. A happy concurrence.
“Who’s that?” he asked, forced casualness making his voice unnaturally loud.
John frowned down at the phone.
Sherlock’s response was too quiet for John to pick out the emotion behind it – was he angry? Pleased? Resigned? – so he barreled onward.
John stared down at the phone, feeling his jaw slacken in shame.
John’s hand paused halfway way up his shaft, his thumb quivering in midair.
He’d deleted the solar system. Of

“But you
Now pealing loud again, and louder still,
John suspected that Sherlock might be testing him, giving him full-force bluntness to see if John would backtrack or voice second thoughts. He thought for a long
“John.” He said it a third time. This time, the single word was all emotions at once: warning, desire, curiosity, shame, love, humor. John used it as fuel, used it to propel himself forward even further, nosing apart Sherlock’s flies and licking the broadside of Sherlock’s exposed cock. Sherlock’s knees wobbled at once, and John pressed him harder against the wall, not caring if the rough brick was bruising Sherlock’s coccyx. He wanted Sherlock to feel this now and remember it tomorrow, and the next day and the next. There was only one chance for a first time and John wanted this to be etched into Sherlock’s memory forever.
Three dots
John laughed. Had his sense of humor always been this morbid or had it grown darker as his friendship with Sherlock progressed? He wasn’t sure he cared either way—
John took a deep breath and pressed the button again.
He opens one eye and turns his head to take in the open expanse of the room, where John is hunched in his chair, reading silently and with avid interest.

“Can I get you anything else, sir?” The barista’s tone was gentle, her eyes sympathetic, and it made John feel even worse.
“That’s what you’re calling me now.” A statement, not a question.
“You said you wanted something to ‘send us off to sleep’.”
Three dots. Stop
A lovely, curvy brunette brushes past him, sending his basket banging into his knees. John looks up and meets her eyes as she reaches a hand out in apology. He feels the light touch on his arm; the corners of his mouth turn up into a brilliant smile and her body relaxes. She opens toward the warmth of him, her body turning while he looks past her, while he thinks, wildly,

Sherlock knew; he was spiraling too hard to ask the proper questions at the moment—but there was no going back now that the Yard had signed off on Sherlock even being there after the last case with the fire and the missing keys and the botched kidnapping and the near-asphyxiation.
Making matters worse, John thought Mother Nature might be mocking him, too. A gentle wind whispered seductively through his open window, billowing the curtains

John murmurs low against Sherlock’s open lips, “So, you’re not more afraid—
As soon as John’s frown loosens around the edges, the fine, silvery bristle around his chin and top lip flattening against his skin, Sherlock allows his eyes to droop shut again. He searches his mind palace for a diamond of memory. Smooth, glittering, faceted. He’s blank for long, frustrated minutes before he forces himself to dive deep, to swim past the obvious blockades of logic and reasoning into the recesses of pure intuition. These are sacred depths, and he does not rely on them often. What he finds here is often troubling and unfathomable, but occasionally, he admits, rather accurate.
Noise filled his ears immediately—Sherlock crying out, his voice higher and more frantic than John was expecting.
Foremost is the consideration of how much music will fit onto a disc, as he has neither the time nor the stomach for a longer project. Sherlock had considered creating a digital mix, obviously, but as John leans toward the nostalgic—and here, Sherlock cannot suppress an eyeroll—he knows that John would prefer a disc to a series of files, the concrete winning out over the ephemeral. (And Sherlock absolutely draws the line at creating a cassette. Decisions about song order and which tracks should appear on which side would likely kill him—or at least send him diving for the emergency pack of cigarettes he’d secreted away in a hollowed-out copy of
John didn’t want to wait through another quarter hour of silence so he typed again.
“Hey,” John said, a clear smile in his voice.
Sherlock looked up again and sighed, tossing his phone onto the table.
“Between us, anyway. You don’t mind?”
“I can’t believe you know his first name but not Greg’s”
John washed down a spark of jealousy with another swallow of wine.
Sherlock’s chuckle was a low rumble in John’s ear.

another glance down the hallway, then picked up the bottle and turned over the card.
He’s not entirely surprised that John hasn’t followed him down the hall. For all that they live practically on top of one another, books and equipment and tea things overlapping and intermingling, they’ve each managed to respect the sanctity of the other’s bedroom. Odd.
John felt gutted. He’d done this, he’d put distance between them and now he wasn’t even privvy to the most fundamental of developments in Sherlock’s life.

He set the champagne on the floor and then slid headfirst onto the bed, cradling his phone in his hands. There were three unread message icons glowing on the lock
Sherlock’s phone was newer than John’s, the camera finer, so it captured the subtlest of details. Even in the dim glow of his bedroom—

John had gotten eyefuls aplenty of that coat in action, too, thanks much: swirling about Victor’s boot-clad ankles, the dove-coloured collar framing Victor’s caramel skin.

“You know, John,” he begins between kisses, amazed at how nearly normal he sounds. “These trousers are part of a bespoke suit.”
“That’s the one, then!” John interrupts, grinning.

John relaxes back into his chair, though his mouth stays tight with worry, his lips pulled down over his teeth. Sherlock feels a tiny blossom of unease unfold in his chest. John is already on edge, casually resistant. If Sherlock wants to uncover the source of John’s recent strange behaviour, he might try infusing the word with gentler tones and inflection.
he thinks again.
, John thought with an eye-roll—and they were both a little too skilled at method acting for John’s tastes. They even looked the part of a couple: two tall, thin, exquisite men, Victor as lovely and dark as Sherlock was incandescent and light, both clad in beautiful tailored clothing that had obviously come from one of those boutiques with a single name on the brass plate outside the otherwise innocuous door.
John makes another wordless noise, and Sherlock pauses, feeling resistance against his legs. He looks down, his dark curls tipping into John’s field of vision like a veil. He finds he’s kneeling on the chair, his thighs on either side of John’s, squeezing him tightly. He has no recollection of how he got there but he’s gripping John like a vise, legs nearly trembling with effort.
John used his acute Sherlock-sense to assess the situation. He may not be a genius detective but he knew a thing or two about how to read one, and his reading of the current situation was that Sherlock was uncomfortable but not miserable.

“I’m quite certain no one doubts that. Not anymore,” Sherlock said. John frowned. Would Sally be crude enough to out them to everyone? He’d thought not. Sherlock, his face damp and flushed, nodded to the staff door that John had exited earlier, now propped wide open with a stout wedge of wood, presumably by some enterprising employee, the hot pub air curling into puffs of smoke where it hit the February chill. How many people had exited through that door or had poked their head out while he and Sherlock were entangled?

As it was, he caught up with Victor just before the heavy wooden door—“Gents” scrawled in thick black script, just starting to chip away—closed behind him. John wedged his hand between the door and doorframe, then slid into the single-occupancy room, his short but broad form taking up most of the remaining space. Victor spun around, his cashmere coat settling around him like water, a frown etched into his flawless features, making him look both stern and bored. Perfect. John grinned at him.
“Hullo, Victor,” he said easily.
That’s the list in its entirety. He should know, he wrote it this morning in the flat, squinting to read his own handwriting in the dull January light edging around the curtains. But it’s difficult to be certain because he left the list at home, half-crumpled on the kitchen table from a clench of panic. It’s difficult to remember, now, because—

Sherlock’s eyes looked almost black in the dim light of the alley and John liked to imagine it was desire bleeding out the grey-blue-silver and replacing it with ink.

Sherlock varies his speed while John’s eyelids flutter, eyes rolling underneath the closed lids, and he chokes out a series of short, guttural cries, each one searing through Sherlock like a fiery arrow. When Sherlock leans forward, trapping John’s heat between their bodies, he can feel John jerk in his hand. He closes the distance between them, pressing his stomach against his own hand and grinding against John, and moans filthily into John’s ear, “Ohhh!”
But in the end, none of that mattered. All that mattered was this moment, and the next, and the one after that.

“Why people care. Why people have opinions in the first place.”
While Sherlock watches, a bead of sweat slides down from John’s hairline, traces its way down his cheek, and disappears beneath John’s collar. “Take this off at least,” he says unsteadily and tugs at John’s jumper. “Too warm.”
“Passion?”
“Bl—ue,”
, and ducks his head quickly to hide his answering smile, regret released so quickly he feels lightheaded and has to grip the doorknob tightly to keep vertical.
Whilst he waited for a response, John pulled off his socks, scrunching his feet into the duvet and feeling the cool air between his toes. Then, he unthreaded his
The stereo had been Mycroft’s once, but Sherlock tries not to hold that against it. He simply admires its sleek lines and minimalist functions, the way the sound system hums quietly when performing a task and stays silent when idle, a keeper of secrets. It is a marvel, tainted only by the fact that his brother’s spidery fingers once twisted its smooth knobs to manipulate sound, much the way he does now with the flow of information throughout Britain.
And now this case—that other bloke—was distracting them both and he couldn’t help thinking he’d love to fuck up Sherlock’s impressive solve rate by just shoving Victor Trevor into the Thames, bespoke coat and all.
When the call connected, John felt as though he’d been dropped into the centre of a battlezone.
“Why this article?” Sherlock prods.
—Sherlock was lit like a pre-Raphaelite, his bare shoulders and the angles of his face softened by shadow. John took in the tension of
- William Cowper, The Task.
John had never heard a note as deep as the groan that escaped Sherlock’s throat at the first hint of suction. He was more encouraged by that single, wordless noise than he had ever been in any previous lovemaking experience. He pressed his right palm flat against Sherlock’s bowing hip to steady him and used the hand wrapped around Sherlock’s cock to work a tight, steady rhythm.
Sherlock sucks deeply, running his tongue along the underside of John’s fingers, and then slides back, biting down softly on John’s fingertips until they push back in. The two men hold this rhythm for a while, Sherlock pulling John’s fingers deep into his mouth, and John pushing against his thigh. Their eye contact nearly unnerves Sherlock. John is staring at him like each pass of his lips is drawing out a measure of John’s soul. Then Sherlock curls his tongue under John’s fingers, squeezing with suction, and John breaks form, hissing and bucking his hips against Sherlock’s quadriceps. Sherlock nearly chokes on John’s fingers, and a long rope of saliva drips down the side of John’s hand. John watches it travel down his wrist. When the damp disappears into the cuff of his shirt, John lunges forward and takes Sherlock’s mouth with his own again, his spit-slicked fingers leaving trails of wetness along Sherlock’s face.
John held his breath.
John Watson had never wanted to lay claim to another human being as desperately and as publicly as he did at that moment. Not to show up Victor, not to out them both in front of their friends-slash-erstwhile employers, but to show Sherlock that he was loved, wanted, claimed. For all of John’s history of pining and insecurity when it came to loving Sherlock, now that he openly did, at least between the two of them, he was proud of it, and he wanted Sherlock to know he was confident in it, in
How many people had heard Sherlock’s shouts and John’s muffled moans commingling in the night? John felt a jolt of embarrassment. He buried his face in Sherlock’s wool-clad shoulder for a moment—just until the worst of the emotion passed—and then looked back at Sherlock, the cold air soothing his burning cheeks. Sherlock pursed his lips to keep his own smile at bay and then shook his head back and forth against the bricks.
“Look, I can hear what you’re trying to get across, I can.” John is smiling, placating, but his eyes are anxious. “But it’s just playacting. This isn’t context. It’s Charades.”

less attention focused on that fact, the better.
Forget the soundtrack of gunfire and stifled grunts and hissed admonishments to keep quiet. This was something transcendent.
Skimming his phone, Sherlock burst into boyish peals of laughter and the rest of John’s words died in his throat. He watched Sherlock’s face whilst he responded, his eyes creased with happiness and an easy smile playing on his lips.

John sighs again. Drums his fingers on the edge of his chair. Clears his throat:

. John licked his lips.
“Your bedroom then, fine.”
During the pause, John closed his eyes, imagined Sherlock tossing his phone aside, frowning down at himself whilst his nimble fingers slid buttons from buttonholes,
He nestled deeper into the soft, creaky bed, smoothing a hand over the sheets and feeling the warm cotton under his fingers.
John had felt the bodies on either side fold him inward, accordion-style, as they turned to smirk at each other. He’d flared with anger on Sherlock’s behalf briefly before settling back into numb passivity. He had been exposed to these moments more and more often as the weeks had progressed; that night’s had simply been the most public declaration of abject ownership Victor had made toward his boyfriend, to date.

The faceted base of the bedside lamp cast a warm pattern of concentric circles on the walls and John counted them, waiting for Sherlock’s response. He got to

He scans the stacks he’s made of John’s music, arranged into neat piles according to specific criteria—scratches on the vinyl, fingerprints on the plastic cases, whether the album was purchased new or secondhand, how many copies were sold in the first week of release, relative attractiveness of band members, electric versus acoustic instruments, whether or not the liner notes are intact, wear and tear around the center hole of the record, if there are multiple formats of the same album in the collection, and whether or not the album is a foreign edition.
“JUST like this,” John says.

Whilst he waited, John considered the last time he witnessed Sherlock deeply, properly, deliciously in his cups. John’s stag night. He thought about tumblers of

“That was—”
It was over far too soon. John applied even stronger pressure with his tongue the exact moment he snaked his other hand into Sherlock’s pants and began to stroke him with two hands and Sherlock exploded, his hands digging in to John’s scalp hard enough to sting, his shouts higher and louder in pitch than John would have imagined. John rode through the climax with him, pressing his body against Sherlock’s knees and knocking them both into the wall. Sherlock came so unexpectedly and so hard that John felt his sinuses burn and he broke off sputtering, eyes watering, and his heart light with joy and desire. He leaned his cheek against Sherlock’s shuddering thighs and panted into his skin. Sherlock slowly loosened his grip on John’s scalp and gently stroked the damp hair away from John’s forehead. They breathed into one another for a moment and then Sherlock reached down to fumble up his trousers, his knees knocking together comically. John winced as he got up from his knees; Victor’s coat was gorgeous—

Sherlock leaned forward, wool-clad elbows skimming the table whilst his thumbs tapped out a rapid-fire reply on his phone. John was being summarily dismissed. He swallowed noisily.
“Jesus, Sherlock. What are you doing to me?”
Not Lucy.
“No matter. I’ve a tongue. Quite a skilled one, in fact.”
John gritted his teeth.
John Watson fell asleep under the soft, heavy duvet with the cool night air against his golden cheeks and the sound of Sherlock Holmes reading apian poetry in his ear.

He stared down at his phone, frozen. Could a blow to the chest be wounding and exhilarating simultaneously?
Maybe...
“‘After compiling the results of a survey sent to nearly four thousand participants across London, the top twenty most and least hated words have been revealed.’”
“That’s right,” he said again. “So lovely.”
“I was canceling your lease,” Sherlock said. “You’ll need to be out by the 15th or you’ll lose your deposit.”
It took a liberal amount of time and John’s gentle, wordless murmuring for Sherlock to settle down. After, Sherlock cleared his throat and the timbre was low again,
“A poem, perhaps?  One of my favorites. Modern, but not dull.” John heard the dismissive hand-wave in his voice.
“I have, yeah. ‘Course I have.”
John stroked his dominant hand up Sherlock’s thigh and into the V of his trousers, freeing Sherlock’s cock gently from his pants and shirttails. Sherlock did not appear to be shocked by the cold air on his exposed skin—or at least he didn’t seem to mind. He pushed his hips away from the wall and John followed the motion of Sherlock’s bobbing cock with his lips, pressing the bud of his mouth against the head and taking in every nuance of Sherlock’s moan as he pressed down and took Sherlock against the back of his tongue.

.” Sherlock grips the arms of the chair and dips forward, his chest suspended mere centimeters above John’s. John chokes in air, his chest expanding once, hugely, then holds his breath.
He stole another look at the photo, seeing new details he’d somehow missed before—a damp curl plastered against Sherlock’s ear in the shape of a question mark—and
His hands faltered whilst tapping the last icon.
Three weeks ago, they’d taken on a case with Sherlock’s ex-boyfriend at the centre of it and since then, everything John had thought stable was pitching back and forth like a balsa wood raft on the high seas.
John coughed against the stab of shock. He’d anticipated this—or something like it—but Sherlock’s frankness still managed to steal his breath. He thumbed a response

“You’ll be on your own for dinner tonight,” Sherlock says crisply. “I’ve had a text from Molly at the morgue.”

John backspaced and tried again, his head beginning to swim from the wine.
He was a bit bruised. Was this all meant to keep him at a distance, even still?

John blew out a frustrated breath, rifling his own fringe with boozy breath.

John looks startled at his tone but complies, the furrows on his forehead and around his eyes softening into thin lines, dropping years from his face.
He’d smelled lovely. That’s the plain truth of it.

He should have gone to the other place, the one four Tube stops farther. The fine imports one with the soft lights and hushed staff and precise, handwritten signs. Their curated cheeses and exotic coffees and delicate, artisanal pastries. Surely he could find the right items there. Surely someone would take his arm and guide him to the correct aisles, murmur softly to him while they helped him fill his basket. Someone would help him select exactly the right tea, the perfect everything. Jesus, surely someone would
After a long moment, he reaches out a fingertip and topples the closest pile. Plastic cases and cardboard covers waterfall into chaos, and something gives way in Sherlock’s chest. He leans forward, pushing over stacks, undoing weeks of careful collecting. Then, kneeling in front of the avalanche of music, he shuffles the piles with his palms, CD cases shifting under album covers, an incongruous rainbow of genres, media, and eras fanned out before him.
Also, it has taken him nearly an hour just to determine the essentialness of track four, so Sherlock stays upright, fingertips grazing the underside of his nose, and breathes into the problem.
At that, John comes undone, Sherlock’s name a curse and a prayer on his tongue. Sherlock worships the heat with his fingers, murmuring in John’s ear and reveling in the wholly unselfconscious way John writhes beneath him. Sherlock unclasps his hand only when John falls back against the cushions, gathering Sherlock to him and burying his face in the damp skin of Sherlock’s neck.

The next message was no easier. Just one syllable, drawn out on a long, undulating moan:
The silence lasted long enough for John to realize that night had fallen completely. The cricket chorus was now a full orchestra. The wind had picked up enough to

Their breathing slows while the seconds tick by. Sherlock rests his head on top of John’s, and John layers kisses into the crook of his neck, under his ear, along the side of his jaw. He hums in pleasure, rubbing his curly head against the soft bristles of John’s hair, and John’s contented sigh is muffled against him.

John paused, his thumbs hovering over the keys.
John shook his head. It was impossible to stay mad at Sherlock when he was being himself. It was even more impossible when John wasn’t really mad to begin with.
The hint of accusation in John’s voice forces Sherlock to turn his head away further, to conceal his smile before whirling around, composed.
He was harder than ever now, leaking onto his hand whilst he circled the head of his cock. God, he should feel guilty about smearing the underside of the ancient
John frowned and tapped out his response.
He could hear the pettiness he’d typed into that one word so he tried again.
John looks at Sherlock over the top of the newspaper. “I’m not against murder on the whole—I mean, I am. Obviously, I am—I just don’t need to read about it when we aren’t on a case. We’re mired in it all the time, Sherlock. Some days, I just want to read something that isn’t so—”
waiting for him like a lover. Which of course he now was.
When Donovan and Corrigan had pulled away again, John had still felt like his lungs were compressed. Perhaps he wasn’t as inured to his and Sherlock’s situation as he’d thought; he had been fairly certain that the pressure in his chest was coming from the external stimuli of watching this tall, handsome bloke turn his boyfriend into a toy, a trophy, and a bit of a laughing stock all at once.
“Nothing in particular. Just something to send us off to sleep.”
John follows, stretching his arms up overhead and sighing happily while his joints creak and pop. Sherlock appreciatively eyes the exposed strip of stomach between John’s trousers and shirt, and John grins at him, yanking his jumper down.

“Yeah you are,” John said, smiling for real now.
Or perhaps...it was John who was missing it.
John could not remember the last time he had felt this lonely.
John chuckles, and Sherlock tears his eyes away from the imaginary clue, his chest growing tight at the small smile on John’s face. John’s body has relaxed a bit, his hands sliding down from under his arms to rest lightly in his lap, palms up. Vulnerable. Sherlock pauses to stare at John’s hands before looking up at the ceiling, willing his mind back on the matter at hand.

“Wh—w—my what?” Sherlock gasped.
John snorted.
Sherlock sat back up again at once, blinking owlishly, mouth snapped shut. John’s left hand twitched under the table and he began to smile dangerously.
Sherlock is used to speaking for hours without John responding (perhaps, John might argue, that’s because he’s not often present at the time). However, he finds the opposite, rarer scenario—being spoken to by an illusory John Watson—unnerving. Although, even absent, John may have a point.
John was floating above his body now.
Sherlock spoke first.
John Watson is buying beans at Tesco when he realizes he’s done for, when he knows, for certain, that his wanting to bury his nose in his best friend’s neck is not a one-off thing.

The Heinz, then. A class above the generic but not showy, he hopes. John Watson tucks the beans into his basket, then hoists the basket back up onto his trembling forearm. Someone’s shoes squeak loudly on the linoleum behind him and his shoulders bow up toward his ears. If everything could just stop for a moment, he could concentrate. He’d know what he ought to do.
Surely, given the choice, Sherlock would date someone much like himself. Wouldn’t he?

John felt like he’d eaten a bucket of tadpoles. His stomach churned and roiled.
– amidst the buzz and the music of the cafe and for all the world to see.
Sherlock frowned down at the floor. Then, his shoulders loosened and he turned back to look at John guardedly.
Sherlock isn’t fooled. He can sense John’s hands clenching and unclenching beneath him. He hovers there a moment, breath fanning against the side of John’s face and rifling the short hairs just above the shell of his ear. Then, barely a whisper.

He felt something reverberating against the roof of his mouth and realized with a start that it was his own involuntary moaning, vibrating around the width of Sherlock’s cock and humming in time to their rhythm. John had never been more turned on in his life. His knees were slipping against the satin of Trevor’s coat lining and more than once he had to steady himself against Sherlock—Sherlock, who was bucking so hard off the wall, he almost knocked the both of them down. It was messy and ridiculous and unflinchingly intimate and John would have happily died in that moment.

The bottom fell out of John Watson’s world while he was sitting outside the loo at Gerrard’s pub in North London. He was on the floor of all places, and the arse of his jeans was wet from beer and slush—piss, too, probably; the wood floor reeked of it—and he was only half-drunk but all-the-way upset and his boyfriend was five seconds away from snogging another man in the bright, crowded bar in front of Scotland Yard and John was just...

Where Memory slept.
John realized he was holding his breath. He forced himself to let it go. When he did, the three dots began again.
Why wouldn’t he be nervous? He’d been the one to cut Sherlock off, after all. He’d been the one to declare a moratorium on late night texts and on showing up unannounced to sweep John off to grisly crime scenes and then abandon him there with no cab fare home. He’d been the one – and here he can feel his face grow hot with months-late embarrassment – to tell Sherlock to “fuck completely off” after he’d sabotaged yet another of John’s dismal dates. But John hadn’t stopped there, had he? He’d finished off that rant well and good: “And you can stop playing the jealous boyfriend while you’re at it.”
—whisper-soft on his tongue, ready for flight—
Sherlock shifts to relieve the pressure of the floor against his backside and uncrosses his long legs, careful not to topple the stacks of CDs, records, and cassettes crowded around him. He rolls each ankle, loosening the joints and wincing when his bones crack and pop, before re-crossing his legs in the opposite formation.
“—And less Philip Anderson, yes, I understand.”
The pub smelt awful—the stench was nauseating—but John swallowed against the rising bile. He was not going to fucking puke on top of the rest of this humiliation. As soon as he could get up off the floor, he was going to slink out the side door and find a cab and ride it to the edge of the city and then just disappear. Into what, he didn’t know. The city itself, maybe, its anonymous grip strangling the personhood out of him. He just wanted to be

“What do you want, John?” Sherlock’s tone was sharp enough to make John squirm in his seat.
John Watson is at Tesco buying beans. Rather, he’s clutching tin after tin of beans, studying the ingredients lists and labels with growing frustration. The basket in his other hand is digging into his fingers, the weight of everyday objects burying him in their ordinariness and their incorrectness. The yoghurt is wrong, damn it, and the coffee and the sugar wafers, and even the dish soap. It’s all too plain or too green or the labels are too cheerful or too boastful.
his hand would slip in the slush and now he was literally elbow deep in it, a patch on the worn fabric of his jacket darkening like a bloodstain. John covered his face with trembling fingers, not caring that boozy, pissy, stinking grime was coating his lashes, sticking them together. Though drunk, he still had his wits about him. He was as close to laughing as he was to crying but it was a near thing. He needed to get up, get out, and soon.
mortification was there—he hadn’t imagined that—but it was tinged with something else. Something deeper, poking at a darker shame that ribboned through him.
There was a loud vibration against his ear and John yanked the phone away in surprise.
John began to type but then he paused, his thumb hovering over the “send” button.
Sherlock looked down at the phone and back up again at John, his eyes softer.

Sherlock continued to look ahead, as if the sheer force of his gaze would propel him through the cafe doors and disentangle him from John’s grip. John wound his fingers into Sherlock’s. He could feel the tension in Sherlock’s hand, each digit rigid with unspoken frustration.

“Ohhh!” Sherlock exclaims, then claps his hand over his mouth as if trying to shove the word to the back of his throat. The noise is harsh in the quiet of the room, and John jumps a little in his chair, furrows his brow even deeper, but keeps his eyes shut. He turns his palms inward, and Sherlock watches while he tucks them between his knees (

“Sorry?”
The next set of messages arrived simultaneously.
“It’s tomorrow now, John. 1:30. Besides, I’ve found something to read to you.”
He blinked down at his phone; that message was a bit cheekier than he’d intended.
John laughs. It’s genuine, and Sherlock can’t help the corners of his mouth lifting in a faint mirror of John’s amusement.
Sherlock Holmes has never written a love note before. He’s never tucked a folded bit of paper, worn at the edges and grimy with nervous perspiration, into an outstretched hand. He has no experience with courtship of any kind, let alone an overt declaration of sentiment, and yet he knows, somehow, that’s exactly what this is—avowal.
(If he was wrong…)

“Close your eyes, John,” Sherlock says, as gently as possible.
John hid the call screen and brought up his message queue with a few taps.

John shifts underneath him, shrinking away from the claustrophobic press of Sherlock’s body, but Sherlock hunts him with the tilt of his head. He puts his mouth right at John’s ear, stutters the first syllable of John’s name—not vocalizing it, just hinting at a long consonant and short vowel, allowing John to imagine the grit of his teeth, the rounding of his lips.

He turns around, bouncing the weight of the basket off of his thigh, scanning the tops of the aisles for the way out. He’s done the tea, the dairy, the starches— the morning and evening staples. There’s nothing left to do but escape this sensible, sterile bubble and return to the upside-down world inside his flat. He’d left in such a state, he’d not be surprised if the wallpaper had fallen to the floor in clawed-off strips, the braided racetrack rug and overhead fixtures somehow swapped. A multidimensional mindfuck. It’s just—

The air in the grocer’s is very thin, the piped-in music merry and overwhelming. He’s nearly alone at this hour of the morning but he can feel the oppressive weight of people in other aisles crowding him against the shelves. One more push and the edge of the metal will be pressing into his hips; he’ll rest his head on the shelf between the potted meats and bean tins and stay there. Preferably forever. A bewildered stockperson will wander by at some point, take his basket, reshelf his carefully curated collection of foodstuffs while he crumbles to dust in mortification.

“On your feet, soldier,” she said and John was upright with a grunt and a heave and only one embarrassing foot-slide.
“Yeah, ‘course I have. Harry and I once said the word ‘milk’ over a hundred times one afternoon. It started off sounding normal, and then it just sort of disintegrated.”
“Git. What else do you have for us, then?"
His fingers fumbled as he tried for nonchalance. He was aware that Sherlock was now seeing his own dancing dots so he struggled to type something quickly lest
John hoped like hell that Sherlock didn’t mind the taste of 2% milk because he was pulling him down, fingers dipping into the hollows behind Sherlock’s ears, and kissing him – kissing him bloody
John thought about reminding Sherlock that he was talking to someone who had just struck out quite spectacularly—
John bit his lip to keep from asking if he was okay. He might not have heard Sherlock like this before but he was pretty fucking sure he was
Which is how, one hour ago, John had found himself crammed in between Sergeant Sally Donovan and a burly Yarder with curry sauce smeared in his beard named Corrigan, watching an indelicate interplay between Victor and Sherlock as if he were merely a bystander.
“You'll let me kiss you, won't you, Sherlock?”
John could count on both hands the number of times he’d heard Sherlock use that word. And never before in this context.
Sherlock is silent, solemn. He lifts his head, and John looks up at him, brushing Sherlock’s fringe away from his eyes.

John took a steadying breath.
He starts off simply, filling his mind with the most disappointing scenario he can imagine.
The earnest young man at the off-license had insisted that screw-top wines were currently the height of hipness and John had been grateful. The wine itself wasn’t
“Sherlock.”
After a moment: “‘Archaeologist Uncovers Centuries’-Old ‘Freeze-Ray’?”

Sherlock had looked down at Victor’s hand as if uncertain how, precisely, the knuckle bone connected to the wrist bone, and John clenched his left hand hard enough to sting. “And managed to knock the phone into the river
He sits back on his heels and closes his eyes, willing himself to think, to look for the less obvious, to find the negative space. The crackle of vinyl between songs before the needle is lifted. The singer’s intake of breath before the first word is sung. That which signifies rather than manifests.
And then, before John could fumble through a reply:
Sherlock dips back in immediately. “Ohh,” he breathes against John’s mouth, lips not quite touching, and John shudders. He hovers there a moment, ghosting his breath across John’s lips, letting the weight of each second decide for them both. Then, Sherlock lifts one knee and rests it in the seam between John’s legs, pressing gently.
“So you no longer want to read anything important.”
Sherlock’s voice was low and soft and clear.
, his fist—whilst reading John’s words? John’s grip tightened on his cock.
Sherlock does not need to rely on a conjuring of images. This has always been with him.

Sherlock leans the side of his face against John’s head, breathing in the scent of him—tea and soap and wool and faint cologne. He turns and buries his nose in John’s silvering hair, feels the top of John’s ear fold down when he presses his mouth to it, and pushes his leg into John, who responds immediately, rutting against him without mercy.
John stares at Sherlock for a long moment. Sherlock stares back, trying to keep his face blank and innocent, but then his treacherous upper lip hitches, just enough to send John into a fit of laughter.
Sherlock’s bottom lip was shiny. Had he been licking his lips—or,
“Please,” John said, running his tongue nervously over his lips. “Pick me.”

funny about this moment.
John squeezes just underneath Sherlock’s arse. “Because if we continue like this, it’s going to get—rather sticky.”
“I’m not done with you.”
Through his open bedroom door, he can see John at the opposite end of the flat, sitting at their shared work table. His shoulders are hunched up around ears that are fitted with cushy, oversized headphones, the blue light from his laptop illuminating his work-worn, lovely face. John’s fingers are pressed firmly against his mouth, obscuring it completely, and his eyes are shut, his brows drawn together in concentration.

John stared down at the card, dumbfounded, his racing heart beginning to slow after his fright. He read the note twice—did she really pen an “@” symbol?—before

Sherlock’s heart is pounding in his ears, but even that does little to drown out the sound of John’s chair scraping on the floor when they rock together.
He disagrees to some extent—John Watson is not entirely uncomplicated—but perhaps Sherlock is obfuscating the process overmuch. He’s been focused on connecting melody to metaphor, on finding songs that fit a strict schema. Songs with “stars” in the title, songs about Earth and about Saturn, about gravity and orbits and constellations. But maybe even
Science fails Sherlock for the first time. Nothing in his atomic structure should allow him to feel so full and yet so weightless.
Right. Well, everything is different now, isn’t it? He’d shown his hand, made a fool of himself in his own kitchen, and now here he is, head buzzing like the fluorescent lights above him.
John felt himself flush. Right, then.

“Here—” John cleared his throat, jumpstarting his ruined voice. “I’m here, Sherlock. So sorry, love. I got—ah, carried away.”
“Lovely.” John yawned. “Fair warning, if I fall asleep, Sherlock—”

He grabs the front of John’s jumper in his fists, pulling him forward, and John follows, trailing his hands down to curl around Sherlock’s thigh, pressing it harder between his legs. Sherlock’s mind stutters—John is moving underneath him, his hips rolling up against him, and it’s all happening so fast, he can’t catalogue each breath, each noise, like he needs to. Their mouths slide apart with a filthy smack, and Sherlock’s head fills with words he’d deleted years ago:
gorgeous, anyway—but was not as thick as Sherlock’s Belstaff (John was sure there was another smug comparison in there somewhere) and he knew he’d be feeling the ache in his meniscus for weeks to come.
“The ‘usual’?”
Sherlock rolls his shoulders and shakes out his hands. He thinks about the word, breathes into it, takes it into himself. He studies John’s face in repose, his tense hands secured tightly under his crossed arms and his feet working against one another in a constant, circular motion. Sherlock needs to make John understand. Somehow it’s the key to all of this. Sherlock clears his throat.
“Charming.”
“Why?”
“You chose that word because it had value in the moment. You gave it context. And when you repeated it over and over again, you stripped it of both, and that’s when the surrealism kicked in.”
“No.”
John barked out a laugh.
Sherlock stops him—somehow, he’d not thought to hope for a
John bucked up into his hand at the unexpected return to their lustier conversation.
Sherlock makes his way to their bathroom to splash water on his face, pressing his fingers into the aching muscles of his hips and arse along the way. At the mirror, he stares at himself, at the pink spots high on his cheeks and at his matted hair and too-bright eyes. He’s nearly unrecognizable with joy.
Sherlock tucks his legs closer to his body, fingers gliding down to rub his aching knee joints, and considers John’s (

John grinned.

The thud of Sherlock’s phone on the table was enough to pull John’s fingers away from his face. There were only three messages in his queue:
Not “this is” but “what if?”
“Ready to go?” Sherlock asked softly.

He had to pause again, panting. Too much. Too
, he typed again.
This was not how the night was supposed to go.
Sherlock cannot count the number of times he’s barged in on John in the bathroom, sticking his head into a cloud of steam and shouting at John to hurry, to turn off the shower and follow him down the rabbit hole again, but—and this aches in a manner he won’t acknowledge—he has to rely on his mind palace to envision John’s pillow.  Sherlock allows himself a moment to picture the indentation from John’s skull, a shadowy dip in the striped cotton, before glancing over his shoulder.
It seemed his acquiescence was something he could only see through wine-colored glasses. Somehow, deep down—and he truly understood that this wasn’t self-

Sherlock grins and dives in to kiss him again, running his tongue over John’s teeth while he’s laughing. He cups John’s face in his hands and sucks the rest of the words out of John’s mouth. John retaliates by focusing the friction of his leg, pulling Sherlock closer, and Sherlock’s eyelids begin to flutter shut, his mouth loose with need.
Silently, slowly, Sherlock lifts himself from his chair with his arms. He stands a moment, watching John relax. John’s breathing slows and his posture dips with trust, and Sherlock has to swallow against the lump in his throat. After all this time and everything they’ve been through, John is still game for whatever Sherlock offers.
He sits without speaking for a moment more and then, quietly,
“Just pick a word.”
It took several attempts to make his fingers work. They were shaking worse than ever they had with an intermittent tremor.
In a rapid, soundless move, Sherlock leans forward, sliding his hands up the arms of John’s chair, effectively trapping John into the cushions. John tenses at once, hands balling into fists at his thighs when Sherlock leans closer, careful not to touch John with any part of his body.
He could not remember the last time he had felt this calm.
John Watson lets the basket sink to the floor at last, stretching back his aching palm with the opposite hand. He stares into nothing for a moment. Replays that thought.
Sherlock is rewarded by another snort from John. Sherlock smiles. John’s understood the context immediately. He lets the vision dissolve with gratitude.
“Noo—oo,” Sherlock replied with quiet caution and John smiled.
John releases outward, and Sherlock slips his long limb into the hollow. After a moment, John closes his legs around Sherlock’s and pulls him in. Sherlock’s scalp tingles with understanding. This—
Sherlock tries to remember how to lead, tries to recall that he’s been word-seducing John for upwards of half an hour, but he can’t quite remember what to do with his hands. He can barely remember what he did to turn John into this grasping, rutting, growling thing. Suddenly, it’s so hot in the flat he can’t

Victor Trevor, tall and lithe, striding off to the loo, his perfect head with its perfect hair and its perfectly smug expression bobbing above the commoners’ heads like a king amongst his subjects. If Victor elbow-waved, John was going to mount the bar and catapult himself into Victor’s perfect face and knock his perfect teeth down his throat.
“What’s wrong?”
“This is hardly news, you know.”
This was enough. John stood up at once and pulled his shirt and vest off over his head, dropping them to the floor next to the champagne. He shimmied out of his

John smiled.
Clear and sonorous, as the gale comes on!
John risked opening his eyes only twice. The sight of Sherlock with his shoulders pressed against the brick but his hips pressed forward, his cheeks flushed and his mouth open, panting was almost more than he could bear. John’s mouth was so flooded with saliva that moisture drooled out the side of his lips and trickled down his chin. He used the excess to keep the arc of his hand slick, making sure that the last piece of skin Sherlock felt before pressing into John’s mouth was saturated with wetness, gliding him into the suction of John’s lips and the strong softness of his tongue.

closer to the octave John was most used to hearing.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was guarded. “Where did y—”
He scrolled through his short contact list and then, heart in his throat and limbs vibrating with excitement, he rang Sherlock.
At that, he came back to himself.
John shut his eyes against the waves of desire and embarrassment that rolled over him. It was becoming a familiar combination.
He could still leave. Nobody was forcing him to be here.

When he looks back up at John again a moment later—calmer, collected—he nods once, and before he can say anything at all, before he can ruin it, he closes the door behind him and clatters his way downstairs.

“What am I doing? Tell me
He fought his way back to the conversation, trying to follow whatever Holmesian logic was at play, admonishing and congratulating himself on the skill.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I don’t need—”
John threw Victor’s coat to the ground, satin lining skyward, grinding the soft, light wool into the slush and grime of the back alley with angry feet. He smiled at Sherlock while he screwed the toe of his boot into the fabric, rendering it unsalvageable. Sherlock stared at him with owl eyes. John rolled his head on his neck once, twice, and then sank to his knees in front of Sherlock, running his hands up the front of Sherlock’s thighs while he buried his knees in slippery, satiny lining.
There was a long moment where the world stood still. Even the music stopped. The chatter, too.

And then: “I miss you.”
But, no, impossible. Impossible.

But then, he couldn’t have imagined this, either. Standing in Tesco, bloody

John grinned down at the phone and switched back to his conversation with Sherlock.
John wondered mildly how he could still be conscious with his heart pounding like this. Was he about to pass out? He was a doctor. He should really know these
