He shakes his head adamantly. “No, I think that even if you were an average joe like me, you’d find some way to help out.”
“So where is he?” Steve feels frantic. He already lost Toni to this damned future, if he loses Bucky too… “Where is he Natasha?”
It’s only then that he realizes that despite the empty clip, he has nothing to worry about. Because her Humvee is in flames and their ambushers are gone.
It’s ironic that the tabloids try to paint her as some sort of harlot shrew. Because she never bows to society’s expectation that she must try to tear down other women, or anyone in her way, to be number one. She’s always the underdog’s biggest supporter. As for the label of harlot…
Steve scoots over next to me so that Pepper can see the both of us. “Hi Ms. Potts, it’s actually my fault.” Then he launches into an explanation. Pepper looks surprised but she looks at me with understanding in her eyes. “I hope I’m not causing trouble for any of you, the last thing I would want—”
“Men rarely know how to respond to me.” She says with a saucy grin that absolutely does not make him want to kiss her. “Other than the obvious.”
He closes the Twitter app, feeling increasingly overwhelmed by the thousands of tweets that mention Toni’s name. Instead he goes and searches Google in hopes to see something more substantial regarding the Iron Man armor.
I claw at the knobs of the shower, struggling to turn off the water and when I do, I collapse on the bench in the stall. At least my money gave me that much. I stare at my shaking hands as I feel the tightness in my throat constrict my breathing even more. My fingers are numb, and I can’t feel my legs, but I can’t seem to corral my spiraling mind.
“Uh, no, I’m not.” He laughs uncomfortably. “I’m fine just going to Domino’s if you aren’t up for alcohol.”
“I just got back from debrief.” Nat raises a hand to her shoulder. “I told him we would be the ones to tell Sam. But Steve, there’s more.” She holds out a small piece of black plastic in her hand, a small green dot flickering in the middle. He looks at her confused, so she leans up to whisper in his ear. “This is a sweeper. It’s Stark Tech, the very best. It searches for hidden bugs and wires. If it ever turns red, then someone is listening in.”
Then I’m awake, heart thudding, gasping for breath as I vividly remember the water burning in my nostrils.
I flick my eyes behind Steve at the unfamiliar car pulling up and avoid Steve’s outstretched hand with the same movement. I open the door and see Agent Coulson’s disgruntled face peering at me from the other side of the car.
Not that he hadn’t become a hot commodity in his own right. After he published his interview and her publicist confirmed it as the real deal, Steve suddenly had several doors open to him. And that’s without considering that his blog took off so high that he finally managed to quit his job. That job filled with idiots who wanted to find a vulnerability in her so they could tear her down.
“Please tell me you know where he is.” She turns back to Steve and he sees the answer to his question in the way her nostrils are flaring and the corner of her mouth trembles. He stumbles back to his bunk. “Does Fury know? And God, what about Sam?”
I laugh. “Fire the chest piece at 50 percent power.” The blinding surge of energy hits the man square in the chest, overloading the suit, and he slumps to the ground, whips flickering off as the suit shuts off. “Damn, J remind me to always question your plans.”
I have no desire to return to my previous humanitarian work. Ballrooms and fundraising will no longer cut it. The work in poverty-stricken areas will always be a priority but I can’t waste away my time like I used to do. I have to do more.
He yanks his arms from his captors and throws himself to the side behind a pillar. The ticking stops and for a small second, Steve thinks he threw his cover off for nothing. And then, the blast hit. The pillar holds, barely, but the men who were interrogating him are strewn in pieces around the room.
“We aren’t looking for a consultant this time Stark.” Coulson says before knocking back the liquor in one gulp. Well, this looks interesting. “We need you on the Avengers, as Iron Man.”
Rhodey however, gives me a short nod. “Of course, Toni. In fact, the air force has been muttering about finding the owner of the suit so that they can take it for military use. Maybe it would be for the best if you give it up.”
She pouts. “Ugh Steve, you can’t throw my workaholic tendencies in my face like that.” She wags her finger at him. “Bad Steve.”
But Steve, impossibly, makes it faster than him and stretches a hand at me. “Let me help, Toni.” I look at him, unwilling to back down. Not now that I feel like a wounded animal, cornered against her will. “Just this once.”
to make things right with him. “I know that haven’t talked after the… after Afghanistan. I never meant to…” Why is this so hard? “I just want you to know that you were a great friend.” I laugh humorlessly. “Not that I was back to you.”
I fire off another two shots at his heavy weapons on his shoulders, knocking them clean off while he is still hacking his lungs out.
“Look at me when I speak, asshole!” The words were spit out in Russian, but Steve had long learned the language for Bucky.
Several seconds of silence tick by as Steve’s sluggish braincells struggle to make a connection. Then it hit him. Alarmed, he suddenly sat up.
“Tell him that even I can’t manage miracles in this cave.” I stare at Khalil in the eyes. When I get out, I’m going to make sure he never terrorizes another person.
She sighs but pulls up projections of figures and lists over the table. “Well, take a seat boys. We’ll be here a while.”
“How about you ladies meet him first and then you can decide. If you’re against it, at least let Sam recommend someone.” Bucky is serious. “I know how it looks but, in all seriousness, Sam is a qualified councilor who has been working with hundreds of vets since he retired. He will have someone who is trustworthy and who has worked with vets before.”
“I know several of you have been speculating about the ownership of the armor.” She says behind a podium, gesturing to Iron Man standing to attention behind her. “The truth is it belongs to me.”
Also thank you so much everyone for your comments! They make me happy and motivate me to write more. :3
“J, get Fury on the phone.” Maybe the known elements can’t help me but I know Shield is hiding more than just aliens from public knowledge.
At first it had been small things: she’d started working longer hours at her office, stopped sending him random texts during the day. Things that at the time had seemed inconsequential until it was obvious that what they had was dying an agonizing death. Unfortunately for Steve, he didn’t get with the program until the day that she never came home.
“I saved your life.” The man takes a seat next to me on a small wooden stool I hadn’t noticed. “My name is Yinsen. I was … chosen to perform surgery on you after shrapnel pierced your chest. I created an electro—”
I look at Steve and Bucky. Neither would be ideal for the position and to nominate anybody else would mean giving them a lot of responsibility since basically they would be the face of our charity. Anything goes wrong and they would be the first person that the public would go against.
“Hey Sam,” Natasha greets the other man with a brief hug, her lips barely brushing his ears, but by the time they separate Sam looks exactly like Steve feels. Natasha lets him stew for several moments as she starts scanning the small kitchen with the sweeper. After checking every corner and receiving only green lights, she finally sits down in one of the chairs.
I splash water on my face for several moments, trying to recover my composure before I speak to both.
Steve grits his teeth, the unspoken judgement grating on his nerves. He’d been the one to direct this team to this base in hopes of finding Bucky. He’d been so
with Peggy. Loved sharing moments after work and whenever they had time. She was always so animated, waxing poetry over every little thing that caught her fancy. She went on long winded rants over anything. And fuck, he
My day starts off pretty good. I attend only five meetings during the day, turn on the reactor for my tower and by the time night comes around, I’m feeling pretty blissed out next to Pepper while looking over the schematics for the tower.
Steve types away on his keyboard, the constant clacking of the keys a soothing rhythm to his ears. He’d started to work on his latest piece for his newspaper. Even though he focused more on Toni’s latest work in Honduras, he’d made the time to interview a mutant with the power to shape-shift.
“We were just talking about how many prosthetics we would be able to commit per year.” I make a face. “Yeah I know that ‘genius isn’t mass-produced’ or something like that but you’re the one who knows the R&D team best. Give me a number.”
Whatever Jarvis says is muffled as I put my faceplate on. Then as the HUD comes to life, his voice is suddenly chiding me at my ear. “I may need to remind you to be careful Sir.” My repulsors whine as they come to life and I whizz my way out of my garage. The night is clear, only a couple of cars still roaming the streets.
“All right.” Iron Man sighs, the sound coming out weird due to the voice modulator. Then the visor lifts up. “Hey Capsicle, time to play ball.”
“What do you mean I have to tell Toni?” Steve feels a twisting sensation in his gut at the thought of seeing Toni. “What about Sam?”
“Get up!” A grunt escapes Steve’s lips as a steel-toed boot slams into his midsection. “Get up you piece of shit!”
“He wants to know if the amenities are agreeable to your tastes.” Yinsen murmurs to me without taking his eyes off the man. “If the great Toni Stark approves of the Ten Rings’ hospitality.”
Hi everyone! I know I dropped off the face of the earth for... two months? dang, time flies when the world is ending and all that lmao.
Of course, the ring should have been a dead giveaway. Except they still live in a gendered world where women can’t propose to their male partners and give them a ring.
“Yeah, yeah I know the VA’s sending one of their veterans over at 10.” I poke my tongue out at one of the blinking cameras in the corner of my lab. “I’m not completely hopeless J.”
“Go for it J.” I grunt out, scratching at the whip at my throat. The man laughs at me, sneering before whipping the other at my torso.
The flap opens again, this time for Rhodey. He stumbles into Steve, since the other still stood in the entry.
The day that things get even worse starts out as any other. I’d slept a total of three hours, making my already shaky hands even worse, so Nadira was holding the soldering iron as Yinsen sleepily translated my commands. When the door suddenly slams open it’s pure luck that prevents the girl from dropping the tool on her foot.
Fuck no. “Yeah.” I grit my teeth and swing my legs over the side of my cot. The tremors in my arms increase but I’ll be damned if Steve carries me again. That ship has obviously sailed.
During Christmas break, Toni’s world shatters. But Steve has no idea until she calls him, sobbing so hard that her words are intelligible.
I grimace. “Hey Pep, I’m kinda jumpy these days.” I click my fingers together and the gauntlets dissemble into the bracers again. “Heard some idiot billionaire got kidnapped in Afghanistan.”
He’s out of his apartment in a flash, revving his bike down the street in a worried haze. The buildings and street before him blur as he thinks about Toni. The thirty-minute commute seems to pass in the blink of an eye, and he arrives at the gleaming Stark Tower in no time at all.
I look up at her from my position on the desk. From here, her face is haloed by the lights of my lab, her fiery hair a perfect corona around the sharp beauty of her features. God, had I been so wrapped up in everything (nee Steve) that I never noticed her beauty?
Of course, the military had no compunctions keeping mum on the fact that they’d found Bucky and rehabilitated him two years before they’d found Steve in the ice. And just when he’d finally reunited with his brother in all but name, they treat Bucky like trash as soon as he outlives his usefulness. After Bucky’s arm had gotten blown off in Afghanistan, Steve had sworn Captain America was dead. Steve had lost Bucky once years ago and then through the stupidity of the bureaucracy of the country he’d protected, he was losing Bucky to the depression caused by the loss of his arm.
Steve had already offered himself as bodyguard detail for Hill, although even he knew that it would be a waste of his talents to do so. Sue him if he prefers the organization that Peggy Carter founded to not implode thanks to Hydra.
I have to find a solution. I can’t die like this. As I stalk through my lab, error messages appear on my holoscreens. By the time Jarvis reaches the last element, I’ve slumped on my seat again, eyes closed as I wait the inevitable.
Steve isn’t convinced and Natasha continues to wheedle at him until Sam suddenly slams his hands on the table and gets up. “Listen Steve, I’m aware that you lack a pair when it comes to Stark but for the love of all that’s holy, just man up and talk to her. It’s not like you’re going to tell her that you’re hopelessly in love with her. You’re going to tell her that
I had everything more or less planned out. I would hit the alleys of Brooklyn, then wander around Manhattan and sometime during the day I would come to terms with the fact that I had less than a month to live.
“Oh Toni.” She toes off her heels and sits next to me, uncaring that my wet skin is wetting her sharp suit. She takes me into her arms, rubbing my fingers softly, unfolding them. “Breathe with me. In, out.”
“I’m injured, Captain.” The modulated voice makes him grit his teeth. “Besides, I thought you wanted your friend to be found.”
He almost opens his mouth to tell her that we could keep this to a fluff piece if she preferred when she looks at him with a glance that quells his doubts.
The chain holding the bag suddenly snaps and it goes flying into the wall with a resounding thud. Everyone turns to look at Steve and he flushes in embarrassment.
So what if that meant that he had to give up his Fridays with her? So what if he had to stop seeing her every morning for coffee? So what if he could no longer work at her side to help build houses for the poor?
“Hey,” In a move that surprised even himself, he grabs her hand and forces it into stillness. “I know that you always get a lot of flack from media over your actions but from what I can see, you’ve always made the right choices.”
The funny thing about torture is that even though they use the same methods frequently, you never get used to it. I’d been waterboarded so many times I’d lost count and every single fucking time I scream like a child, the sounds gurgling in the water, my nose burning with every drop of water inhaled. They’d broken my toes one by one, and each one made me scream and sob like nobody’s business. Whips and flogs beat me daily, with methodic precision to avoid breaking skin, and the pain never gets any easier.
“Come in Steve, don’t mind the mess.” He stares at Dum-E as he walks towards my desk, the robot trailing after him like a puppy. “That’s Dum-E. My firstborn child.”
“Yeah,” I laugh, the sound bitter even to my own ears. “I was always too chicken to actually do anything about it with him and now he’s lost to the military.”
“While I was calling for reinforcements, he got me from behind.” She lets go of Steve’s face and turns away. “I got distracted by my worry and didn’t foresee that he would recover that quickly. By the time I come to, I’m trussed up like a fucking turkey and he’s talking to me like he’s never known me before. Then he left.”
, the board won’t die if I miss a meeting.” She gives Steve a wink before slowly walking the other woman toward the elevator. “You know what, I’ll even email the old coots myself the new specs on my planned tablet.”
Surprisingly, Rhodey doesn’t try to muscle his way past Steve. Instead he chose to fall back and hold the tent flap as I stand up shakily.
“Steve,” she interrupts, her voice soft with clear fondness. “You’re rambling, babe. What’s going on?”
I nod at the boy and his mother before taking to the sky. I know I’m crying; I just can’t show that to them.
I put away my phone, then get out from the stiff chair. Despite the frequency of these visits, those stupid chairs always make me feel like I’m a naughty child getting pulled in front of the principal.
At first, I’d thought that the world needed to know who pilots the suit, who actually risks their neck when confronting the terrorists. But then I think about Pepper, who I’ve managed to halfway convince to set her up as CEO; Happy, my stubborn bodyguard who would rather die than allow me to be hurt; and Rhodey, my bestie who spends his time in dangerous places and has his own enemies. The impulse fades after that.
She snickers, only pulling a faux solemn face when she sees that Steve is serious. “Technically, Jarvis is installed in the whole tower. He just doesn’t reply to anybody else but me.”
He knows that he can never hope to reach the same financial level as her family’s. But that’s fine, Steve has always valued love and companionship more than money and status.
Steve had left the military and never looked back once. He’d received summons and letters cajoling his returns every month. He’d always sent back the same reply: no, thank you. After Bucky received his arm and signed up with SHIELD as a Special Ops agent, he’d gotten double teamed by him and Nat as they tried to persuade him to leave his ‘boring desk job’ as they called it.
Of course, having Bucky as his best friend is all good and well until said best friend is calling him at three in the fucking morning.
She sighs. “Toni, I did the background check before we hired him on. I knew from the moment you gave him that interview that he meant something to you.”
Everyone is convinced that the man behind the machine is a technical genius, some believe that he’s a vigilante while others are of the belief that he is a savior of sorts. Nobody ever connects me to the superhero persona. Of course, it helps that everyone is convinced that the person in the suit is male. Honestly, I’ve never been happier that I’m a sucker for androgyny. If I’d welded a pair of boobs to my suit, it would have been easier to pin the identity to me.
I laugh. “Yeah, but instead of helping me out you just tried to sell your super-secret boy band to me.” I lean forward in my chair and wag my finger at him “And just for the record, I’m still happy being a consultant.”
“What will you do when you become free?” Yinsen’s voice is rough, understandable considering we’d spent at least 18 hours in complete silence.
HI guys! I'm back! To be honest, i hit a major writer's block these past couple of weeks and i had to rewrite most of what i had written already. I saw that it was getting too Stony heavy and I wasn't ready to let go of Toni's arc quite yet.
The door slams open, the same goon as always standing in the doorway. He spews a barrage of words at Yinsen before reaching behind him to throw a terrified girl into the cave.
My goggles suddenly seem very interesting and I fiddle around with the strap around my head before answering. “Everything is fine Rhodey bear.”
Pepper’s face appears on my projected screen. She does not look amused. “Toni, what’s this about a new charity?”
It isn’t until the fifth article that he finds one with a video of the conference where Toni admits the armor belongs to her.
His eyes are warm and full of something that makes my stomach twist in anticipation. “Thank you, Toni.” He looks like he’s about to say something else, but Jarvis interrupts our conversation.
“Well then, that takes care of the product development, the mission and statement, the candidate selection, the budget, the charity’s agenda, and leaves us with…” Pepper trails off as she flicks through information on the projection. “Okay, spokesperson. We just need to decide who will be the designated representative for the charity. Now normally that would be Toni but trust me, her schedule is jam-packed.”
“So,” I begin to say. God this is harder than I thought. “I know you guys both know about the arc reactor and the whole Afghanistan story.” They both nod slowly. “And I know you’ve seen the news about Iron Man.”
“Sounds like a comedy duo.” I snicker. “I don’t know. Steve still has at least three more hours to kill before his shift is over. Now Barnes, who knows.”
Anyway, I’m there, drinking coffee from my favorite mug (which incidentally always manages to appear next to the coffee pots each morning) and trying to look like I’m not pathetically waiting on some guy after coming out of a 24-hour engineering binge.
Steve turns and promptly chokes on his spit. Standing in front of him in a sleek white pantsuit and muted lipstick is none other than Toni Stark.
“Toni?” Pepper’s sudden voice takes me by surprise and the bracers on my wrist activate into gauntlets. “Whoa, what the hell Toni?”
“Sir, if I may…” Jarvis pops a holographic screen in front of me suddenly. “The cameras can provide a better view than that spoon.”
So instead of giving into the impulse of seeing if her lips are truly as soft as they appear, he gives her a smile. “Come on Toni, I have to go pack.”
He picks me up, mumbling something to a familiar voice behind him. I’m still lost in the tumultuous emotion inside me, still grieving Yinsen and Nadira. Two souls that deserved so much more than the death they received while helping me.
Bucky arrived before the teachers and managed to pry them apart. But before he could drag Steve away, a teacher showed up. She’d taken one look at Steve and sent him straight to the nurse’s office. Unfortunately for Steve, Bucky had volunteered to take him there.
“Men see me, and they see a pretty face. They think that I should be on a runway modeling lingerie or in a kitchen making meat and potatoes. Men everywhere seem to think that women were made to do things related to them. If a woman is not doing something for a man, then she is worthless. Gender equality has been praised for so long but its nothing more than an empty accolade that men heap on companies that squeeze every potential from women.” She takes a sip of her whiskey without a grimace. “In this world, the fact that I don’t use my body the way men would like or serve men the way they would like makes me an easy target for media. But I don’t care that they use me as a scapegoat for everything wrong when a ‘woman gets uppity’, because that means that as long as they’re focused on me, they can’t harm the reputation of women who can’t fight back with the same zeal as I can. I can keep the media on their toes; everything they publish about me is publicity for my company and there is nothing that can make the board toss me out. Not when I own eighty percent of the shares.”
No, the nightmares have returned and he hates the cold again. He’s been backsliding into hypervigilance and the shakes come when the AC gets turned up. “Pretty good. How about you?”
“Oh, it’s pretty good.” Steve says earnestly. “I mean, hands down this place has way better stuff than what was offered at the Daily Bugle.”
“Toni,” Pepper interrupts softly. “We know. We were just joking. It’s just… you just came back to us and now you’re out there risking your life for god knows what reason.”
But as always, Iron man was gone, uncaring of proper protocols. Ignoring Sam’s look, Steve grits his teeth again and calls in the quinjet.
“Okay, so let me get this straight.” I pin them both with my best imitation of Pepper’s stare down. “There will be three of you on this committee and apparently, the third one will be the foundation’s namesakes honey bunny.”
It’s this last question that makes me angry, pissed beyond belief. “Nothing! Nothing except fucking exist, Rhodey!” I’d tried. I’d fucking shut down the weapons division. I’d helped rebuild time after fucking time and
He sighs. Fuck, now he has to pick the damn sand up. He’s on his hands and knees, dustpan in hand, when he gets the notice.
“She was my childhood sweetheart.” He gets a faraway look in his eyes. “We married in secret, despite her parents’ wishes. We lived happily for twelve years: our three girls the biggest blessing in our lives. Once this is over, I will finally be with them again. In peace.”
When she flies to Mexico to help rebuild a small town devastated by hurricane season, he’s right beside her with a shovel mixing cement for walls. Then when she goes to distribute food and water to famine-stricken villages in Somalia. And then again in the soup kitchens, the homeless shelters, the ocean cleaning project in Thailand, and soon enough, he spends more time out of the office than in it.
It only takes him and Sam fifteen minutes to be suited up and in the quinjet towards Bucharest along with the backup team. Sam fidgets and shuffles his feet the whole ride there, but Steve refrains from commenting. If it were Toni…
When the nightmares return, I wake up, a strangled scream stuck in my throat, tears prickling in my eyes. For a moment, I’m reminded of Steve, my faithful best friend who’d helped me through many a panic attack.
“Ms. Stark,” Coulson starts off before cutting himself off. “Toni, I believe you have found out about Fury’s passing.”
“I have mentioned this to Fury as well.” His face remains impassive. It’s starting to piss me off. “However, he insisted on me trying again.”
“I have to do this J.” I grit out. But the elevator doors remain closed. “Jarvis! Take me to the damn lab.”
“I’m off from consulting hours.” I say to Coulson before striding to my bar so that I can pour us a drink. He looks like he needs it. “What’s gone to hell so bad that Fury is looking towards little ole’ me?”
“He still left.” I mutter. Steve might care for me but that doesn’t change that he chose the military over
“Come on Yinsen, we have to finish the soldering.” I ignore the tremors in my hand and pick up the iron. This has to end.
To be honest, I think this fic is absolute trash and I have serious thoughts about orphaning this work so that at least I'll stop being so clingy to the kudos and comments (mostly the lack of). But my mamá didn't raise a quitter so I have the final two chapters. I added the open-ending tag today because I don't think I can go through the whole canon rewrite with this Tony. Also I removed the eventual smut because honestly, I can't limp to the finish line and throw in some sexy times. I'm sorry that i'm such a trash writer and I hope I can produce better works someday.
“He was engaged Pep.” I still remember the shame I felt when he had to put me in my place. “I came onto him and then in my embarrassment, decided to grant him the interview.”
“Patch him through.” I hold my phone in front of me as Jarvis connects the video. “Hi, you’ve reached the life-sized recording for Toni Stark, please leave a message after the bee—"
I smile at him, god I adore this dorky menace. “Just peachy Capsicle.” The nickname rolls off my tongue, but he seems to ignore it, opting to reach out to me with my name on his lips. “I’m fine Steve.” And if he touches me, I’m going to fucking lose it and bawl my eyes out.
Pepper sighs, the sound coming across staticky. “No Toni, your CFO doesn’t care about your image. Remember you hired her specifically because of this point?” Still leaves the… “And Director James is less than orthodox himself.”
Strange that nobody other than Steve ever saw the danger in her bright megawatt smiles that showed too much teeth.
Cold blue eyes stare at Sam, slowly taking in every inch of the dark-skinned man without a spark of recognition blooming. Then with a quick movement, he turns toward the boarded-up window and breaks through it.
“I’ve got time.” He looks at me, that same disarming look that he sent my way whenever he was about to confess something. Something tells me that this will be heavier than the time he stole my slice of cherry pie from my fridge though. “Go on.”
“Why do you care?” Steve had responded nasally, one hand pinching his nose to stem the bleeding. “Just because no one picks on you doesn’t mean we’re all so lucky.”
Not that that meant that Steve would do the same. He’d woken up, disoriented and confused since he’d just crashed a plane in the artic, and told that he was in 2002. Fifty years in the future. The only reason he fought for the military as Captain America again was because he’d had nobody else to turn to. He had no living family and he’d thought that Bucky had died fifty years before.
Flustered, he pulls out the cards and puts his phone on recording mode. “Do you mind if I record our questions?”
Rhodey turns back to the suit. It’s a close replica of mine but with enough changes that the War Machine armor would never be mistaken for the Iron Man suit. For starters, instead of the bad ass red and gold color scheme, I’d switched it out for a more patriotic dark blue with silver and red accents. Where my suit is all sleek weaponry hidden by hatches and caps, I’d placed a large automatic rifle on the back of Rhodey’s, along with most of the same missiles and weapons in mine.
“How can we get Bucky back?” Sam interrupts, his normally serene demeanor drawn and pinched. “I can’t stay here waiting for news. I have to do something!” Suddenly Steve is reminded that despite living quite complacently a civilian life, Sam had been for years the Falcon. The vein throbbing in Sam’s neck belies the somewhat calm façade. “I don’t give a fuck if Hydra is in Shield or not, I care about my damn husband being AWOL!”
“No!” Steve yells at the man he’d been chasing after for months, the one who’d just shot at his husband in the air without a second thought. “Bucky that’s your fucking husband!”
Although Peggy never saw it that way. And in the end, her point of view on the issue became the catalyst for their separation.
For several moments, I stay where I am, face pressed to the cool glass of my lab table, despairing in silence. Then an idea comes to me.
“You don’t know her like I do.” Steve misses the way Nat’s mouth tighten in the corners, her bored expression otherwise unchanged. “She
“I received an honorable discharge after almost getting killed in an ambush, but Bucky wasn’t so lucky.” He continues as if he hasn’t dropped the biggest fucking bomb ever. “A month after we got back, he got into a situation with Senator Stern after the news broke that he wanted to take away benefits to all able-bodied vets.”
My head felt like exploding the moment that I’d found out that Steve, the same Steve I’d hit on during a party, the one that became one of my best friends, is Captain America. I mean, fuck, I’d been making fuck me eyes to the guy every single Friday we went out for drinks, my AI called him C
She smiles, this one nothing more than a grim bearing of teeth. “Ah, there we go. Now you’re talking. Javier Perez graduated with honors from Stanford thanks to a scholarship for low income children. He knows better than any white cis male what type of adversity these kids have to go through for a minimum education. I can’t say that he is incapable of embezzling, but I can say that he has less of a motivation to do so.”
And Toni, he held a slight reverence to her. She’s brilliant, funny, thoughtful and beautiful beyond belief.
“Come on, Nat.” He gestures at the waitress for the check. “Let’s get back to HQ in case there’s another mission.”
Steve doesn’t waste a moment, running to the window and throwing his body right behind his best friend, knowing that Sam would go flying behind him. Their quarry runs flat out over the rooftops, easily clearing the distances between the buildings. Steve runs after him, his breath burning in his lungs, unaccustomed of actually pushing his limits so fast. Slowly, Steve gains inches on the shorter man, Sam right behind him, and it seems for a moment like they’ll actually catch him.
He flushes. “Sorry, it’s just that I’ve never been down here before. I wasn’t sure if J would give me access to the elevator in the first place.”
“I think you should go.” He gives me a sudden hug. “After your return, I went to therapy. I had to work through a lot of shit too. I just want you to get better too. So that you can focus on finding an answer for the palladium.” I narrow my eyes at him. “What? I have a working brain, Toni. I can figure out that your arc reactor has a palladium core and it’s obviously poisoning your bloodstream. You just need to find another viable core.”
Heart pumping, Steve jumps over a smoldering car, keeping his shield close to his body. He always feels hyperaware when the adrenaline starts pumping, but they’d been fighting for well over an hour and the effects were starting to leave him jittery.
She rolls her eyes before taking a seat next to me. “Not the moment Toni. Where’s Barnes and Rogers?”
My cries hurt my chest, but I can’t stop. I can’t erase the pain that seems to cleave my heart in two. I can’t erase the guilt I feel for not being able to do more. Maybe if I’d been faster…
Iron Man chuckles. “I don’t doubt it Captain. However, I strongly suggest you secure him. According to my calculations he will regain full consciousness in less than a minute.” A groan from Bucky’s lips confirms Iron Man’s words.
“Toni, I really am sorry.” I snort, his earnest gaze making it suddenly easy to remember that this is the same dork that once ate my pie and then apologized for it.
“Captain Rogers,” The AI is solemn, no witty comments as he greets Steve. “Sir’s parents left this morning to spend Christmas in the Bahamas but suffered a fatal accident on their way to the airport. Sir was notified an hour ago and went to identify their bodies. Apparent cause of the accident was Mr. Stark’s intoxicated state.”
My chest is heaving like I’d run a marathon and I lean over my knees, trying to breathe. Rhodey grabs my hand and starts counting, just like way back then when he used to help me through my panic attacks. He doesn’t say anything, just continues the count. I focus on the numbers, slowly regaining control over my breathing until I finally stop feeling like I’m going to die.
“Then we should go. What time does the flight leave?” Toni gives him her best puppy dog stare. Already anticipating the reason, he gives her a chastising look. “Toni we can’t go on a private jet. Think of the environment!”
My original plan was to fly over the desert until I found a village. One large enough and have communications to the outside world. Unfortunately, that plan met a fiery demise when my propulsors on my boots burn out. I barely have time to mutter out a swear word when I plummet down into the sand.
Fury rages through me. Worse, I can’t do anything but flee like the coward I’ve been my entire life.
So this chapter was completely unplanned. Originally i had their third and final encounter planned as the final chapter for this work but Peggy dumping Steve just wouldn't stop crossing my mind.
I splash water on my face. This morning’s toxicity level makes me feel like time is trickling through my fingers like sand. Last night had been filled with an engineering binge, my armor receiving all sorts of upgrades that I will probably never use.
Jesus Christ, it really is Steve. He’s just as gorgeous as always, still sporting that thick beard from Afghanistan but now in civilian clothes. The sweater vest and casual chinos should make him look familiar, as it’s the look he always wore while working as part of my PR team. But the wary air that he sports and set of his shoulders makes him look like a familiar stranger.
“I have no knowledge of who Ivan Vanko is.” Toni looks at the reporter and winks. “However, Ms. Everhart, I’m sure you’re just dying to tell us who he is.”
Rogers and somehow, I never noticed that he looked just like the pictures my dad kept in his shrine.
“Pep! I’m wounded, weren’t we having a moment?” She pauses, her hands on her heels before a slight smirk settles on her lips. Then she steps towards me, her lips next to my ears.
Steve shakes his head. That last one was a big stretch. Sure, America seems to be going towards a quite spectacular crash and burn but that had nothing to do with Toni. Everyone seems to be convinced that she built the Iron Man armor, even if she allows someone else to pilot it.
I’m not going to be in their stupid superhero group. All I want is to die in fucking peace, damn it.
By the time his phone starts chiming his alarm, he’s half-convinced that he should take the day off. It’s only the thought of Bucky’s troubles, and the immense help his prosthetic will be for him, that gets him out of bed. He puts on a pair of sweats, does his quick warm-up routine, and sets off for his morning jog. When he comes back to his apartment, fueled by endorphins and adrenaline, Steve is convinced that the day won’t go so bad.
He finally reaches the quinjet, joining the other agents that had already made it back. “I want a complete report on—”
Thankfully, our table gives us perfect visibility of the main entrance, just right for when one of us arrives earlier than the other, and I see the moment Steve walks in. And boy, judging by the throbbing vein on the side of his neck and a jaw clenched so tight it’s honestly a sight, is he in a mood.
“It still goes against the grain.” She sighs before slumping in the chair unhappily. “I’ve put off this visit for almost five years now. It’s just so hard to see my brilliant aunt be such a pale shadow of herself. She founded an important covert government agency you know.”
I narrow my eyes at the one-eyed curmudgeon before pulling out my phone from my pocket. After two seconds, three bugs in the room appear on my screen as red dots. I turn to Fury and he looks disgruntled but resigned.
Unsurprisingly, Steve doesn’t get on the jet with me and Rhodey. The two men share a long look before Steve gives me a soft smile and walks back to the Humvee without a word to me.
I bet if Steve saw me now, he’d realize that I’m nothing but worthless. Only my money and brain are salvageable about me.
She gives him another smile before gesturing at his coffee. “I hope you like the coffee. Pepper told me that IT lobbied hard to get more coffee makers in the cafeteria.”
Hours later, when I finally take the worst fucking shower of my life, which coincidentally ended with me in a panic attack, I finally realize the truth. I’ve lost a part of my life, lost a piece of myself, and even more hurtful, I’ve lost Steve to whatever the fuck happened with the military.
I’d been ambushed in Afghanistan, survived, and now had a massive hole in my chest that houses an electromagnetic field generator.  And to top it all off, the operation was made in a fucking
I dictate his movements, urgency in both my words and his actions. When Yinsen can do no more, I tell him to eat and sleep to recover some energy.
There’s a man in the room with a backpack slung over his shoulder, stringy dark hair to his shoulders, worn flannel and jeans, and a matte black prosthetic. He only shares the high-tech arm with the Bucky Barnes that disappeared a year and a half ago. His expression is shuttered and closed off, the fingers of his prosthetic arm clenching and unclenching as he stares at the interlopers.
“This is the first time I’ve heard about a family.” I halfheartedly tease Yinsen. “Who’s the lucky girl?”
It isn’t until their Humvees are pelted by gunfire that he realizes that he should have listened to his gut instinct.
Saturday morning finds Rhodey and I in my lab working on the suit I’d created for Rhodey. After our conversation, I’d been spurred to complete it. If I die…
“No, Steve,” Bucky is adamant, but he softens his tone before continuing, “The past may have made me who I am, but the future is much more important. And this charity will do so much good for the vets who have been overlooked by the system.”
But after they went to that damned gala, she was convinced of the opposite. In her mind, he was in love with someone that he could never have.
Hi! So this chapter was originally going to span the introduction of Toni and Bucky but god Toni just wouldn't shut up lol. I hit the 2000 word mark and i was nowhere close to getting those two in the same setting so i just gave up and separated it.
And then twin tendrils slither out from the suit’s arms and crackle to life with a familiar blue glow.
The third and fourth versions both failed to stay together, somehow coming apart every time I took a step. That mistake pissed me off because the first two did not have that problem. Thankfully the fifth version stayed together and did not spontaneously combust when I initiated the hover command. Of course, that one suddenly lost power to one boot and I flew around my garage wildly before I finally managed to land. On my recently purchased Aston Martin Vanquish. Needless to say, it crumpled like a tin can under the weight of my armor.
“Of course, Pepper dearest, when have I ever not listened to you?” I get an abrupt brainwave and I turn towards my table again.
My heart clenches at the sight of a round, tear-streaked face looking at me with stars in his eyes. He babbles something and then runs away to his shrieking mother before I can reply.
I sit up, wincing as I hear the loud protests of my bones from being slumped over my table. “Patch her through J.” My suit is standing to attention, glowing a soft blue from the reactor that I’d plugged it into.
“Oh Toni,” Steve touches my jaw gently, like I was made of glass. His thumb soothes the edge of my lips, and he stares deep into my eyes. “You’re one of a kind.”
So it’s a surprise that Steve manages to bump into the elusive woman right in front of the main elevators outside of the employee’s cafeteria.
As always, I have no beta and any errors are mine alone. Kudos and Comments are very appreciated! :3
For several weeks after he received the package that symbolized the end of the best relationship of his life, he’d done nothing.
Steve's POV on Toni being informed about Bucky *officially lmao*, the world finding out that Toni Stark built the iron man armor.
Thankfully, the dusty Humvee is close to my tent and I don’t have to spend more than five minutes feeling Steve’s warm hand burning through my flimsy tank top. But then he climbs into the vehicle after me, squishing me between him and Rhodey.
Every morning at 9 o’clock sharp Steve stops at that floor to get his daily caffeine fix. And since I found out that little tidbit, so do I.
And that night that she slept away from home, Steve finally came to abrupt realization that sometime during the last six months, he’d lost Peggy and he had no idea how to get her back.
Still doesn’t change the fact that Steve wishes he could dent that stupid deathtrap that they call armor.
“Funny, my father said the same thing to yours.” A whip cracks next to one of my ears, wrapping around my neck. “You will die in his place.”
“He says that if you do not build the missile, he will rape a different girl each night for a month and then they will all rape you.”
Steve settles for following the wonder twins into the house, neither of them stopping to knock on the door.
Of course, having the hangover from hell also means that his reactions aren’t what they should be. And it’s because of this that when he finds himself in the elevator with a very well-dressed Toni, he says the worst possible thing.
The suit has none of the sleek elegance of mine, instead going for bulk and heavy artillery. A high caliber automatic rifle perches on one of the bulky shoulders while the other has a bazooka launcher. The first thought that crosses my mind is that the person inside must have insane gains.
And without another word to Steve, they walk into the elevator, Toni talking a mile per minute while Pepper looks increasingly bemused. When the doors close on then, the sudden silence surrounding Steve felt oppressing.
Of course, when he wakes up that morning, everything seems the same. He’s in his shitty apartment, with his shitty life still in shambles around him, and don’t forget, he’s late to work, as par the course for a Wednesday morning.
When they talk about their orientation, they share a commiserating eyeroll. Every bi always experiences the bi equals cheater stigma. And so Toni Stark stops being the
Steve shuffles closer to my cot, still holding himself in that battle-ready position that belies his calm façade. “It’s classified.”
But she’d been sure that distance and time was what she needed to get her head on straight regarding their relationship and nothing he said made her change her mind.
“I’m fucking dying Fury. I have no other choice than to trust you with the knowledge of my alter ego because I’m going to be dead in less than a fucking year.” I cough away the knot in my throat. “I need to find a sustainable core for my arc reactor. The one I have is palladium and it’s poisoning me.”
“Toni,” she leans against me. “I know. You’re such a giver when you start to care. I knew from the moment Jarvis told me.”
“Sir, it appears we may have hit another snag in the armor.” Jarvis says softly as I let him lead the suit back home.
“Toni… I know that things have been difficult after your return,” she pauses, settling her body next to me at my desk. I sigh and slump on the cool surface, we’ll be here a while. “I’ve also noticed you haven’t been going to your therapy sessions I set up for you.”
The man steps closer to me, the wire rims of his glasses flashing. “If you move, you will disrupt the wires.”
I sigh, then I give her a small smile. Her blue eyes bear into mine, clear and guileless as always. If only I wasn’t such an idiot to love those who are outside my reach. “That’s fair Pep.”
As soon as they leave, I grab a sheaf of paper and pencil. Once my reactor is in place, if I can manage to stabilize the tech, I have to design the biggest WMD of my life. Back when my designs were of the warmongering type, I’d toyed with the idea of armor for the soldiers. The board had disagreed with me, of course, so I’d just created a bunch of new missiles instead.
Hi, as always i'm full of apologies and lacking in quality writing. Anyway, this is the penultimate chapter for this series but as far as i'm concerned this is the end. The next chapter is merely an ambiguous time jump to the future, where only a small surprise is finally revealed.
By the time I finish the fortieth armor, I want to scream. Fortunately, that seems to be the one that takes.
“What’s going on?” He asks Nat as she gets off. Her responding glare makes it clear she’s not ready to talk to him yet. He looks at Clint in hopes of getting some answers, but his face is just as blocked off.
At Steve’s silence, the man gestured at his henchmen. One grabbed each of his arms and then the butt of the rifle was slammed in his face. No finesse at all but that’s the Russians for you. Steve spits out blood to the ground.
Aware that this is the first time that he is willingly choosing to spend time with me, without having to go through the whole convoluted process of discreetly stalking him before he arrives, I only have one answer. “I’ll see what I can do.” Horrified at the look on his face, I blurt out an apology. “I’m kidding! What time?”
He hands me my precious babies and I get to work with the stupid suit. “Toni, I know you’ve thought about the coincidence of Captain America’s return in active duty and Steve’s presence when you were found in Afghanistan.”
Her eyes widen at the mention of torture, but she doesn’t mention it at all. “Toni, no, you’re going to a hospital.” She turns to Happy. “Tell her Happy.”
I offer him a smile as he trails off, adorably unsure. “Sure, no prob. Now would you like me to start the fittings for your arm now or after we talk shop?”
Next to me I feel Pepper straighten in her seat. Okay now that was impressive, that hadn’t happened in a long time. Steve seems to find all this as par the course, judging by the smirk on his face.
“You sure you can do as much as 30 prosthetics?” Bucky gave me the stink eye. “Including physical therapy?”
He stares at her for a long second, aware that this was heartfelt sincerity that she would never share with the big guns that have interviewed her in the past. “I don’t know how to respond to that.”
I create and release a new version of my now famous Stark Phone and the sales push us clear out of the red. Thankfully, that means less meetings and I can finally focus on finding out who the hell leaked my location to the Ten Rings in the first place.
“Ladies, this is James Buchanan Barnes aka Bucky. Bucky this is Toni Stark and her impressively efficient PA Pepper Potts.” Steve points at us like he could possibly mix up an infamous celebrity and a PA
He wants to show the world that just because the increasingly frequent mutants are something so brilliantly unknown, it doesn’t mean that they are bad. It helps that the girl is a teenager, with the extracurricular activities that would put to shame any kid. She works in soup kitchens on her weekends while maintaining straight A’s in Brearley School, not that he would divulge the latter fact. Given that she’s a minor, he must be careful not to be overly descriptive of her; otherwise she would be easily found. She wants to maintain her identity a secret so in any case, he’d have to respect her choice.
“I would not do that if I were you.” A man’s voice, low and accented. “I barely managed to stitch you together in the first place.”
“Yes, you idiot. I’m going to SI today because I’m going to be fitted with my prosthetic. Chances are I walk out with a brand-spanking new arm.” Bucky’s voice turns sly. “And I also get the added bonus of seeing my bestie around
I lift up a hatch that hid the tiny grenades, frowning as I see a couple of wires crossed in a way that would interfere with the mechanism. I grab the pliers on the table so that I can maneuver the little buggers. Had I not noticed—
Steve doesn’t reply. He just places his hand on my waist and lets me hold onto him as I make my way outside.
It isn’t until hours later, after I’ve ate my burger and appeased Pepper with a check-up, that I realize that despite returning home, nothing feels the same without Steve.
“It isn’t me Stark. This isn’t mine.” He gestures at the office. “This office is Shield issued. Everything inside belongs to Shield. Even myself.”
Unlike all the other times he’s seen her, she’s far from looking put together. Smudges of eyeliner ring her whiskey colored eyes and traces of red lipstick stain the edges of her lips. Instead of designer labels and dangerous heels, she wears ratty jeans smeared with grease, a faded black t-shirt with a peeling logo of an obscure rock band, and easily the most beat up pair of Chuck Taylor’s. It’s kind of disconcerting to see her looking so vulnerable, while at the same time completely expected. After working on exposition pieces about the multiple philanthropic activities Toni did, he knows that she is much more at ease out of the war paint. It’s just… he’s only ever seen her when she looks every inch the powerful woman.
This vulnerable Toni humanizes her in a way a thousand exposés on her philanthropic activities never could.
Steve had stared at that email on his phone for hours, unsure of what prompted a company as big as S.I to reach out to an aspiring journalist like
He cups my face in his hands. “Since when has the known been a restriction for the brilliant Toni Stark?” I close my eyes. He’s right. I’ve never let the limitations of science or technology stop me. It’s time to get to work. Something in my face must have clued him in to my change of heart because Rhodey smiles. “That’s my girl.”
“Tell him to leave a message.” I say, before shooting a grin to a suddenly solemn Pepper. “Come on Pep, I swear I’m not going to do anything. I’m off consulting hours.”
She comes to a halt by the door of my lab, seeming to debate something before turning back to me. “I’m not poly, Toni. I can’t start a relationship with someone knowing that they are still too in love with Steve Rogers.”
Before my kidnapping, we’d been friends for well over two years. Barring Pepper and Rhodey, he became the person I interacted most. And they, being busy adults themselves, never had the same amount of time to just shoot the shit quite like Steve. I love Pepper and Rhodey, but sometimes all I wanted was to get Steve and go gallivanting around New York.
“Well Steve Rogers from Brooklyn,” Toni’s eyes gleam and suddenly Steve is reminded of her crazier plans. “You are about to fly to England with me.”
This time Steve couldn’t hold back a grunt as the boot connected again with his mid-section. God that’s going to leave a bruise that might take more than a day to heal over.
“Why do you keep opening new non-profits instead of keeping one and lumping everything under that one? Is this for tax benefits?” Steve says, pushing down his desire.
“Yeah but those kids shouldn’t make anyone feel scared. Much less the small kids like the one that got picked on.” Steve had stared mutinously at Bucky, waiting for him to make fun of him.
It takes up a lot of my time, my moments spent in my lab reduced to mere hours each day. I jet around the world in my suit, allowing myself a grim smile each time the news covers ‘Iron Man’s’ newest heroic shenanigans.
“What?” Rhodey had graduated from MIT too, so he’s far from stupid. It’s just hard to remember that when I’m usually surrounded by idiots (Pepper notwithstanding). “What do you mean ‘the rest of your days’? Are you dying Toni? What did you do?”
The knot in my throat makes it suddenly difficult to talk and I cough discreetly hoping he doesn’t notice.
Yinsen translates. The goon laughs before throwing the girl down again. She whimpers but doesn’t move a muscle from the dirty floor.
“Hey, handsome.” The throaty purr behind Steve’s shoulder almost made him spill the whisky over his rented tuxedo. Which would be a shame, it’s been years since he’s had whiskey that good. “Can I interest you in something?”
I face the holoscreen. “Hey Eyepatch, miss me?” He scowls at me and I backtrack quickly before he hangs up on me. “Listen, I know you guys have heard about Iron Man.”
“Stark has just said that she built it!” An agent that had been hogging the only bench-press that Steve uses gossips to her spotter. “It’s all over twitter. She says that Iron Man is her bodyguard and that the suit is—”
I step toward Vanko, lowering myself to one knee so I can be at eyelevel with him. “All I see before me is the son of a disgrace.” He spits at my helmet, but I just chuckle. “I can hit all the right buttons too
Toni is still grappling with her impeding death. Oh, and Fury needs her help to find a MIA Winter Soldier.
A sudden slam grabs my attention. In front of the shoddy metal grate that I’d pegged for a makeshift door stood another man flanked by several others. Faces covered and armed to the teeth, they sent shivers down my spine.
“That’s a relief. The boss will be glad.” Toni’s eyes crinkle at the corners despite her poker face.
In the hallway, Steve pulls out his phone and opens the Twitter app. There are the usual memes that Clint posts. But there isn’t any mention of Toni, so he types her name into the search bar.
Her accusations made him feel guilty and rightfully so, he’d been staring at Toni for an inordinate amount of time that night. But as he’d told her: Toni is nothing more than a celebrity crush. Toni Stark is someone he admired. Someone that he, and anyone else really, could appreciate from afar. But she is not someone who he could ever have a relationship with. Not someone for whom he would jeopardize his relationship over.
“Maybe I should take care of it anyway.” I chew on my upper lip. I mean, I can always push back some of my visits to the charities…
HI GUYS! oh my gosh i'm really sorry that this chapter took me so long to complete but real life got kind of dicey for me and well... the important part is that i finally have chapter 4 and a rough outline for the rest of the story!
So now Shield has Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Falcon. When (when, not if) Bucky is found they’ll have the Winter Soldier again. Which is worrying since Hydra is still alive and kicking in Shield. The only thing that reassures Steve that they are going in the right direction is that Hill is the one in charge.
“Oh it’s no big deal.” Wincing as my voice cracks, I clear my throat. “I mean, no problem Steve. I mean I did way worse last year when I hit on you.”
Her slim fingers wrap around his lapels and she slinks forward with unmistakable intent. Before he can do something stupid like kiss her in a very public venue, he swiftly brings up his engagement ring. “I’m engaged.” He blurts out before her lips can touch his. She recoils swiftly and he internally thanks his lucky stars that she doesn’t press the issue. “Peggy and I are getting married in two months.”
Of course, the rest of the team thinks that he slept his way to the position, although no one ever dared to say it to his face. Not that Steve cares, at least he got the chance to do something for the world. And, the added plus of seeing Toni frequently helps ease the sting of the others’ opinions.
His optimism follows him through the rest of his morning routine, commute, and dies a fiery death the moment he steps foot in the Tower.
The look in her eyes is still entirely too vulnerable, but her society mask fixes itself on her face again. By the time the elevator doors open to his department’s floor, that small moment of weakness is gone. He tilts his head at her in goodbye before leaving the elevator, feeling a slight sting of reluctance to leave her.
Khalil says something in a derisive tone but walks out with most of his guard. Only two remain and they wrench the small girl’s body out of my arms. I let them take her, my hands falling limply beside me.
For a moment, all I do is blink at him. “Okay, talk about unexpected, but I’ll bite. No Steve, J confirmed this morning that it was still on.” Wait, but did he really? I mean, he did say something. Frowning, I pull out my phone from my pocket. “J, babe, what’s the deal with the vet’s prosthetic program?”
So, with a soft apology, Steve places the handcuffs on his best friend of nearly seventy years before standing straight to continue his argument with the anonymous man who’d helped him when he thought all hope was gone.
“Sir, you asked for the emergency sirens yesterday specifically.” If an AI snarkiness was an Olympic sport, my baby would take first place. And I would be the proudest momma ever too. “It’s coffee time.”
“Send word when you have another mission. Fury knows where to find me.” Iron Man suddenly interrupts. Steve shuts his eyes before breathing out slowly. Then he turns to face the armored man.
They grew up as neighbors, pushed to friendship by two mothers who wanted nothing more than them to get along, and so at first, they hated each other. Steve hated Bucky because he was everything that Steve wasn’t; even as a child, Bucky was good-looking, witty, and worst of all, healthy. For sickly asthmatic Steve, that last fact alone meant intense jealousy.
Steve had given his life to the country once before, and they’d repaid him with PTSD and nightmares for years. If Steve never steps foot on a battlefield, it’ll be too fucking soon. When Toni told him that she wanted to go to Afghanistan because her new foundation had managed to get permits to rebuild a local village devastated by her previous creations, he’d said as much to Toni. But she’d been so excited. Enthusiastic at the prospect of seeing her new foundation hard at work repairing the damages her creations had wrecked, she’d pleaded for him to accompany her. The reminder of her desire to fix her mistakes, begotten by her youthful naivety and the manipulations of Obadiah Stane, curb his excuses.
“Stark, have you heard of palladium poisoning? What a way to die.” Then he throws back his head in manic laughter. I stumble backwards a step. How did he know?
I close my eyes, stilling my hands for two seconds before I turn to Rhodey. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Bucky had stared at his Ma in shock. No, his father never got like that. His father got angry, loud and mean when shouting at his mother. His father was aggressive, quick to hit him and his sisters if they crossed paths with him when he got angry. His father was a nasty son of a bitch who despite being a drunk, had nothing in common with Joseph Rogers. And neither did Bucky with Steve.
And phew thank fucking God he’d said no. My brain is still stuck in the fog of hormones triggered by the crisp, masculine scent of him and that was just because he touched my jaw.
Of course, rumor has it that she hardly ever sets foot in her penthouse and instead opts to spend all her waking hours in the lab that everyone
Steve abruptly chokes on his spit. I turn to him with an arched eyebrow. “What? You know I like to move things along. No time for chit chat.”
A massive hole gapes on my chest, multicolored wires threaded through the hole and seemingly connected to a battered car battery sitting next to my stomach.
I let out a slow breath. “Okay, you win this time Pep.” I give her a wan smile. “Now I’m gonna finish my shower because we have a charity to organize.”
“What’s the holdup J?” I ask, gritting my teeth as the man finally begins to get his bearings again. This is about to turn ugly.
Yinsen proves himself invaluable, helping me melt down the palladium to form the core and functioning as my hands when the tremors in mine became a dangerous nuisance. Not that I don’t have nerves of steel but months of torture atop of starvation and major chest surgery can do a number on anyone. Of course, switching from the battery to my arc reactor doesn’t grant me any favors either.
I grin at her when she gives me a dry look. “You know I love to emulate your style Pep, but I just can’t seem to put it quite as together as you do.”
He and Toni were friends, or so he liked to think. But even he can’t deny that sometimes there was a … spark of something more when they shared eye contact. Add in Bucky’s sarcastic nature and something is bound to explode.
Steve frowns at her assumptions. “I don’t work for the big names. I work for myself and an exclusive interview with you would put my online newspaper on the radar. Your love life might work for tabloids, but I want to focus on journalism.”
“Not at all. I’m open to recordings about myself.” She shifts her balance against the bar and winks at him in clear innuendo.
“Ivan Vanko, son of exiled scientist Joseph Vanko. He worked with your father with preliminary arc reactor technology but was deported to Russia after he was convicted of spying for the KGB.”
Steve looks bewildered, so I take the liberty to respond. “Sure, set up the meeting with the Barnes guy and tell me when I have to show up.” I turn to Steve. “You want to form part of our Core Team?”
“Gonna introduce your buddy to us or are you just going to let us drool in abject admiration?” I quip. Queen of the sass, that’s me.
She’s a Senator’s only daughter: part of a family with a genealogy and bank account dating all the way to the Mayflower. It goes without saying that she’s used to finer things than he could offer. Her idea of date night consisted of a restaurant with at least 3 Michelin stars. Going to buy groceries had been such an eye-opener that first week as a married couple. She’d thrown things into their cart without even stopping to see prices, much less look for cheaper alternatives. And that’s without counting that time they went clothes shopping together for the first time.
sinful voice. His fiancé is such a lucky bastard. “My—Sam said that having the charity named after me is a huge honor. So- uh thanks…”
I cough. Fuck I’d forgotten that I’d been in a revealing tank top after talking to Pepper. And oh God, he’s right. Pepper is going to come to that sobering realization any time soon. “Okay, okay you got me. Look, what I need is help.”
“I know you guys think that I’m a slut for attention.” I say dejectedly. “But I actually thought about the risks. I thought about both—”
Not that I’m anticipating anything going wrong but…whenever there is money involved, things generally get messy.
“I just want you both to know that this is the reason why I have been even more distant than usual.” Pepper still looks at me with sadness in her eyes, probably remembering that I have very little time left in me. But she doesn’t say anything, respecting my wish to keep it between us and not let Rhodey in on that secret quite yet. He would be out of his mind with worry. “I also want to let you both know that I want to create something for you.” I feel a lump in my throat just by thinking about the two of them vulnerable without me to be around. “I’ve created metal jewelry that houses parts of the iron man suit, it would help ease my mind if you would accept some sort of protection. I mean, the world doesn’t know my secret identity yet, but a little bit of extra security never hurt.”
“If I wait until I’m healthy to stand up for myself, it’s going to be too late. Everyone will know I’m a big scaredy cat.”
It takes another fourteen hours to finish my armor. I start up the program I’d written, initiating the code and stepping inside.
In the meantime, I start to cobble together the code necessary to arm my armor. Even though it’s going to be rudimentary, I have to have a system integrated, at least to avoid missing any shots. I know that this is going to be the only shot I have at survival. Vengeance of course is another deciding factor.
Luckily, nobody is waiting for the elevator. Mostly because by now all my employees are in their offices. Or at least they should be.
“Bucky,” Sam stares at his husband in desperate hope, voice cracking with emotion. “Babe, please tell me you remember me.”
As he walks towards the doors, I sip at my coffee while putting away my phone. I feel the urge to hack into the army’s database to find out more about Steve but resist. I doubt he’ll appreciate the invasion of his privacy.
“Oh.” Her eyes bore into his, almost confused. To be honest, he had been giving mixed signals for a moment there.
I stare at him, half-convinced that he’s finally lost his marbles. “Fury, I can’t help you with the Bucky problem. But I’ll see what I can do about Iron Man.”
“Great.” Then I dive down. “J, get the modulator on.” I tap the side of my helmet. “Hey, asshole, copyright is a thing.”
At first, Bucky used to think that all Dad’s were like that, especially considering that Steve’s dad usually got drunk along with his dad. But then one day, when he and his Ma were over at the Rogers’, he happened to see the older Rogers stumble home in a drunken haze. He had quickly looked at Sara and Steve to see their reactions, but instead of the dread and fear that usually filled his own home when his Dad got home, they were unconcerned. Sara was still chatting happily away with his Ma and Steve was sketching in his notebook.
“How?” The organization was Peggy’s baby. Her work as founding member had helped it become the strong organization it is today. It can’t be Hydra. Can it?
Slowly, Steve rolls over to his side and clambers up. Unsurprisingly his captors are armed to the teeth. Not enough to warrant a threat, but then again, they thought they captured a spy not Steve Rogers, alias Captain America.
It’s been more than year since anyone has seen him. After two months of no news, Sam finally cracked and joined Shield just to be able to search for him along with Natasha and Clint. Hill is nowhere as lenient as Fury—surprising considering how much of fucking hard-ass Fury was—but she wasn’t stupid and if Falcon offered himself in exchange for a mission to find his hubby, then she was taking it.
“What? Why?” I trail after her as she leaves my lab, each step punctuated by the click of her heels. “So that’s a no on our dinner date?”
An indignant snort crackles through the speakers. “Steve you ass, I told you that the whole reason why I geared up for this was because Stark’s foundation finally approved my prosthetic request.”
“Ballsy.” She murmurs with a half-grin. Then she takes a step towards the bar, leaning towards him with open invitation. “Go ahead, give me your best shot.”
“ANYWAY,” I break off, aware I’d been too loud to be nonchalant. “Don’t worry about the charity. It’s the very least I can do after my weapons did the damage.”
Grumbling to himself, he pulls out his phone and calls Toni’s number. She probably won’t answer anyway. Or probably already blocked his number. After all, Steve totally ghosted her and—
The door opens the rest of the way and he walks inside with a sheepish smile. He rubs a hand over the nape of his neck before looking back at the guy who walks in behind him.
Steve gets a weird look on his face. “You know, I’ve never told you about how I managed to be accepted.” His phone rings and after he checks it, he gets all blotchy again. “I have to take this.”
So elated by the possibilities I don’t notice the ice until it cracks the glass of my faceplate and by then, it’s too late. The whine of my repulsors sputter before extinguishing completely.
She twines her arms around him in a tight embrace, sobbing inconsolably. They lay on the floor for hours, Toni’s cries slowly segueing into hiccups. Steve kisses her forehead when she finally succumbs to her exhaustion.
The elevator in the room dings, and I have a gauntlet on my hands faster than I can blink. “Cut the shit Stark.” Agent Coulson puts his phone away in his pocket and strides into the room, looking even grimmer than usual. I lower my gauntlet, already letting it dismantle into the bands around my wrist. “Ms. Potts, so sorry to intrude.”
Jarvis’s voice breaks through my reverie. “Sir, I detect a rudimentary arc reactor very similar to yours within the suit.”
“Thanks for comparing me to a god, my dude.” I say before handcuffing him to a lamppost. Titanium reinforced handcuffs that tighten automatically, there’s no way he’s getting out unless he chops off his arms. “Have a great day in jail.”
Steve straightens out of his crouch, wiping the blood off his lip, already feeling the wounds starting to close. That familiar itchiness never gets better no matter how many times he’s wounded.
“The news is false.” Coulson doesn’t look surprised at my lack of surprise so he must have come to the conclusion that I would have found out sooner or later. “He wants you to know that the Avengers Initiative needs you.”
But then Toni got abducted while he was supposed to protect her. And at first, with Rhodey’s clout as Coronel and the media clamoring for her rescue, the government had sent the military to look for her. But as weeks turned to months and nothing came up, they finally called off the search.
I have no idea how many days pass, but I grow resigned. No hope lives in my heart. I know I’m going to die in this godforsaken cave surrounded by demanding terrorists.
The flare flies through the crevices of his helmet, an oversight that I’d corrected with the Mark IV. The helmet immediately opens to let the smoke out. I don’t recognize the heavily tattooed and scarred face gasping for breath, but my father had made several enemies that I never knew about while working for Shield.
“Sam,” He starts to say into his com, chest heaving from exertion, when he hears the unmistakable whine of repulsors. “Who the fuck thought to bring you in?”
Whoa, talk about a curveball. “Wait, wait, what’s wrong Pep?” I frown, finally putting all my concentration on the call.
But Steve, among other things, is resilient. So, he gets his sorry ass up on Wednesdays, contemplates his sad existence as water swirls down the shower drain, gets dressed, and hauls himself to work before he gets dangerously maudlin. He goes in and does his job, like he hadn’t gotten absolutely hammered the night before. He might be late, with his tongue dry as cotton and his head pounding like hell, but he is there, damn it.
By the time Yinsen is awake, I have the code uploaded to the main hub I’d installed inside the back plate. In theory, once I have everything correct it will serve as the brain to my weapon. Instead of placing it in the face plate where it will overheat and obstruct my view, I can have it functioning as a spine instead.
Before, when he’d been the Bonnie to my Clyde, I’d been able to read most of his thoughts going by his facial expressions alone. But now, his expression closes off, shuttering in a way that has me shivering.
Resigned, Steve closes the word document and shuts down the computer before stretching in his admittedly comfortable chair. “All right Tones, where are we going today?”
Returning to my garage, I make sure to carefully enter through the car entrance. The last thing I need is to draw attention to myself. I throw myself into the suit, upgrading the repulsors, the alloys, everything. Hours pass by and when I least expect it, I pass out.
“It was canceled ten minutes ago by the director of the Veterans Association, no reasons given except an apology for the late cancellation.” Jarvis says promptly, startling Steve if his sudden jump means anything.
And so Steve went to Shield, willing to trade Captain America for Toni Stark. The director, Fury, had looked him in the eye and enlisted him on the spot. Shield had been surprisingly lenient on him, allowing him to spearhead the rescue group for Toni until he got her back. He’d thought that it had been worth it the moment he saw Toni’s frail figure in the sand.
“Steve, I have no desire to go back to the foundation until my husband is back with me.” Sam coughs, his eyes looking dangerously glassy. “It’s been nine months and I have nothing to show for it. I can’t go and pretend everything is fine while knowing that the love of my life is wandering around with fucking amnesia.”
Pepper looks like she’s about to argue but then she gets distracted by something in the background. “I don’t think you should reveal your identity Toni, but I have to go.” She disconnects before I can reply.
“Give me two cups of celery and orange juice, please.” I say to the girl behind the counter of the cute little green juice café. She couldn’t be any older than fifteen. Just looking at her made me feel positively ancient.
He sighs and looks away. “I’m still not really sure why you’re doing this Toni. Are you sure you’re ok?”
At first, my day started off normal. I greeted the day from the depths of my lab, elbow deep in the workings of a exoskeleton for paraplegics, and with the sunny disposition of a dungeon bat to match. Sometime during mid-morning JARVIS blared a siren from the speakers, almost making me drop my soldering iron on my foot in shock.
His scowl grows. “Listen Stark, as I told you before we have nothing that could help you.” Fury pinches the bridge of his nose before exhaling. “Now, I know that I can’t have civilian Toni Stark as part of the Avengers, but Iron Man is someone that I need right now.”
Steve finally perks up. “I think that we should hold a vote for each one, once a month. We get together, review cases, and vote. For this to work of course, we need to be uneven, so we need to choose someone to be an independent reviewer for the cases. I know a veteran councilor who would be perfect for the job.”
“I don’t have to help you.” Fury muses, one hand on his chin and I’m about to fucking lose it when he gives me a secretive smile. “But it just so happens that I have something called the Avengers Initiative.”
I don’t look back at Steve and get in the car, now concentrated on trying to figure out how they overrode J’s security protocols. I’d specifically asked him to keep Shield at bay.
I kill so many as I make my way out of the cave, the sounds and splattering of blood almost making me lose my resolve. But I always remember Nadira and I kill many more with grim satisfaction.
They’d had a plan in place, hoping that Bucky would at least hear them out if they don’t go guns blazing, to ease in the fact that Sam was his husband. Of course, like all plans, it didn’t work out. For a moment, the other man falters, his gait stuttering to an almost halt, but then he looks at the two men on his tail and turns to run, even faster this time.
Her hands flatten the lapels of her peach colored blazer in a nervous gesture Steve’s starting to find familiar.
The suit stands to attention in the middle of my lab and I quickly get inside. The lights of my HUD flickering on immediately when I’m ensconced. “J, set a course for the last sighting of the Ten Rings.”
“Nat.” the word is curt, no sign of the sarcastic humor she usually employs. He gets out of bed, warily opening the door.
If only he hadn’t been forced to accept his help. Steve is aware that Fury is being surprisingly lenient with him by letting him be part of these missions, just like when he’d been searching for Tony. Of course, Bucky’s disappearance is of upmost importance to Shield.
The second time Steve sees Toni, he is at a gala for one of her multiple charities. Of course, the room is filled with important people: celebrities, reporters, and the like. That said the guest list was very exclusive. Only reporters backed by a reputable publisher were allowed in. So, when Steve received his invitation in the mail, he was quite understandably shocked. Even now surrounded by the rich and powerful, he still can’t quite wrap his head around the fact that he and Peggy were invited in the first place.
“Toni, you have a meeting with the head of the finance department in five minutes.” I hum softly, as I open the visor of my helmet. What if I don’t have time to set up my suit? “Toni? Are you even listening to me?”
After Jarvis finished the scans, and I finally stopped freaking out, an eerie sort of calm settles inside me. This is it. This is the reason why I survived that damned kidnap attempt.
The moment she walks in a room, attention naturally gravitates to her. And when she speaks, everyone listens. Since her interview with Steve, she always makes sure to talk about those in less fortunate situations—racial minorities, LGBTQ+ issues, women’s troubles, etc. Brilliance and compassion rarely go hand in hand, but as with everything else, Toni is the exception.
I had set out this morning to see more of the city, feeling every second that ticks by as a moment that I’ve lost. I’d wanted to see the corners I’d never ventured out to see, always too scared to mingle, scared that I’d be hounded by paparazzies or mobbed by people who don’t understand that celebrities are humans too. So I’d put on my most nondescript clothes, made sure that every black tendril on my skin is covered with the softest sweatshirt I own, and set out.
It’s ridiculous how safe I feel once he’s there, tension melting away from my shoulders. But then I pay attention to what he’s wearing.
She doesn’t look convinced, opting instead to sip at her champagne and looking back at the blueprints in front of us.
Natasha places a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “He has amnesia Sam. When he spoke to me, he had no idea who I was.” Steve sees Sam’s face fill with resolve and knows that if there is no news beyond a month, the man won’t hesitate to take up the mantle of Falcon again. “I spoke to Fury about this and he agreed that for the moment the information will be kept between us only. Clint and I have been assigned to try to bring him back but …” She looks at both Sam and Steve. “Even if he comes back, we have no idea on how to get his memory back.”
Steve scowls at the unapologetic words and gets out the titanium handcuffs they’d created especially for Bucky. Shield had reached out with some experts in neurology and they were relatively confident that he would be able to regain his memories. But first, they have to make sure that Bucky even gets back to them.
“James is gone.” Can a super soldier have a heart attack? The tightness in his chest makes him believe that yes, a super soldier
Once I’m inside the elevator, I tell Jarvis to send me to the penthouse. Something tells me that today I have to look presentable and not like the gremlin from my lab. Once at my floor, I head straight to the shower, shedding my clothes as I go. I set my water as hot as I can stand it, finally giving my sore muscles some rest after being cooped up in the lab for so many hours.
As the cowards flee, the villagers slowly look at each other before dispersing. No one so much as looked at me. And then I felt a tug on one of my metallic fingers.
While gallivanting around the Middle East, I put my faithful J on the hunt for data in my own company. He helps me a lot, his reach inside my systems coming across various digital trails. Unfortunately, these are dead ends with shell companies but zero identity to who made the connections in the first place. These are obvious tie ins to who sold me out but without any concrete answers.
He shakes his head and sighs. “I had an idea after I saw the glowing circle on the chest of the Iron Man suit. It wouldn’t surprise me.” The corners of his mouth turn up in a small smile. “What does surprise me is that you would actually keep this information quiet. That you would keep your identity a secret.”
“I’ll finance the program myself then.” Somewhere one of my accountants is screaming my name but fuck it. Seeing Steve look at me like I solved world hunger is worth every single fucking penny this project siphons from my bank account. It’s not like I’m poor. “Hell, give me your friend’s name.”
And now, now he’s off in Afghanistan, if he’s still there at all, doing God knows what. A flash of Steve in his tactical gear pops in my mind and I start thinking of all the ways Kevlar can be pierced. Heart suddenly racing, I get out of bed and rush to the elevator.
“See you on the other side.” He gives me a smile. Something seems off though, so I repeat our plan to him. “Remember, at the end you will find me using our homing beacon.”
“He says that he is getting impatient. He wants the missile within the next week or there will be consequences.” Yinsen is pale next to me.
Today I arrive before him, already at our table that we’d come to designate for our morning talks. Sure he was technically late for work each morning since he always stayed to talk with me for at least half an hour, but since I’m the Big Boss Bitch (lmao) he never got any flack from his department head.
So yes, being the one to publish this piece launched his platform into the stratosphere of public knowledge. Fortunately, the rest of his works kept it there. Not that that was a guarantee for anything. So Steve accepted the invitation, rented another expensive looking suit, and finally gave Peggy a reason to dress up. His finances never really gave much opportunity for evening gowns and her heirloom jewelry before. Peggy, of course, never complained but Steve is far from oblivious.
But that meant it became a pain in the ass finding activities to pass the while during downtimes between missions. Running was out since he already did his ten miles in the morning. So that left sparring or hitting the bag. And only Bucky had ever been up for sparring.
In his defense, despite knowing that Peggy was disenchanted with their relationship, upset over his so-called crush on Toni, he’d never thought it was that serious. It never crossed his mind that she would kill their fledgling marriage because of it. So when she asked him to stop calling her during work hours, he’d brushed it off as her desire to be a strong empowered woman. Never mind that she’d never had a problem with it before.
“J, what are the odds that those whips will short out my suit?” I say as I hover closer to the other suit. A whip crackling with the high energy of the reactor flies perilously close to my face and I jerk out of the way at the last moment. “J? Kind of a time crunch.”
“How about an exclusive interview?” he says after his coughs subside. Which, in his humble opinion, was ballsy considering his voice squeaked and his eyes were still tearing.
Steve nearly strangles his phone, only loosening his grip when he hears the glass cracking. “Sorry, I know I’m probably bothering you at the wrong time and you’re probably very, very busy right now. It’s just that I have something really important and—”
Bucky and Steve knew each other far longer than they have been friends. Bucky had been lucky enough to be born first and so could quite confidently pull off the older brother card easily whenever Steve got full of shit. But at first, they had no friendship at all.
That warranted a very stern lecture on the importance of timing to both Dum-E and Butterfingers (just in case).
“Thank you.” Fury says before letting out a small laugh. “Oh, and Captain America is in charge of the missions for James.”
They pass several agents in the hallway, all of them giving them a respectful nod. Steve feels like he’s stumbling behind Natasha, her strides purposeful while he still feels like he’s swimming through the thick molasses of denial. They reach his bike outside and she wordlessly gestures at him to get on. He knows the way to Sam and Bucky’s townhome by heart, so it doesn’t surprise him that the trek between Shield HQ and their home passes by in a blur.
I know, that’s why I finally decided to come clean. Vanko had escaped almost as soon as he was placed in custody and with him went all the answers to my questions. Why was I attacked in Afghanistan? Was it really revenge for my father? Time is ticking for me, and I need to find answers to both the reason why I was abducted and how to survive the palladium. Having both of my best friends in the loop with my alter ego would ease some of the pressure on me.
I don’t say anything until he’s near the table, opting to forgo the chitchat and go straight to the nitty gritty. “So no coffee today?” Okay, almost straight to the nitty gritty.
The first armor I made in my lab didn’t take to my arc reactor, pulling so much energy that after five minutes I had to replace the core. The second version went up in flames after I tried to launch the boot propulsors. Dum-E, of course, came to my belated rescue with a cannister full of extinguisher foam only after I’d managed to put out all the fires.
“So that’s four of us. Steve, Barnes, you and me.” I tell Pepper. She gives me the stink eye but says goodbye. “So Steve, now that we’re proud parents of this initiative, you have any ideas for what else this foundation can be for?”
Right, that would fly over well. Probably, in her mind, his dismissal of her uncharacteristic detachment was his agreement to her actions. In fact, she probably thought that he was gearing himself up to take the first step to break things off. He had no idea how to tackle this unforeseen problem, so he opted to wait.
“No, Toni.” He looks angry before his expressions smooths out. “If anything, it’s my fault for not being here so that you could get that off your chest. Have you been going to therapy?”
