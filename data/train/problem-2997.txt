Cas doesn’t say anything.
And they
There was only one way Cas could make up for the wink from hell, and that was by getting Dean’s order just right. He turned his back to the couple, made sure he positioned himself between them and the griddle, and got to work.
is the one who’s seen this particular movie about a hundred times. Finally Dean pauses it and asks Cas what’s up.
By the time Dean strolls through the door at 7:10, Castiel has had to twice reassure the attentive blonde waitress that yes he
“Update? Wait, what did you think my last name was?”
“Did you know they executed a man for witchcraft like this, in Salem? They laid big flat stones on him, more and more weight added each day. It took weeks."
. He doesn’t make any effort to smooth out his expression or hide the irritation that has him grabbing his jacket off the bench next to him with too much force and slipping into it with jerky, fast movements. “Thanks for dinner,” Dean bites out, irritation souring into anger directed squarely at himself.
“This truck has been good to me, very reliable, but I… I must have forgotten to fill it up.”

“Buddy, you gotta start using doors.” Dean gives a sidelong glance to his friend and has to fight against the smile that plays at his lips when he sees how devastated Cas looks about the whole thing. Stretching one last time, warm inside and out and feeling truly awake now, Dean gestures over at the Impala with a tilt of his head. “We should head back, see if Sam’s up yet. And thanks for the coffee, Cas.”
Castiel’s moans deepen into something Dean finally recognizes as Enochian, quiet indecipherable murmurs between Cas’ endearingly small kisses. Dean pulls away to shift himself into a more comfortable position, still laying across Cas’ lap while Cas curls down over him. Looking up at the other man, Dean expects words to pass between them -- questions, reassurances, whatever -- but instead Cas just dives back in for more of what he’d been doing before.
Dean lets out the breath he’s been holding and gets back to scraping at the dirt. After another 15 minutes or so, he leans on his shovel and looks around at the junkyard. “God Sam, you think we’re going to end up like this guy?”
“Well Dean, they’re very small.”
of people have written about you and Cas being, ya know…”
thank you,” Dean whines shamelessly. “It’s heavy.”
“You still at it?” Conrad looks down at the beginning of the hole, hands on his hips.
. It’s shorthand and it’s short-lived, an easy thing that only exists when it’s needed and disappears when it’s not.
It hasn't been physically comfortable for Dean to sleep in the Impala since he was 12 or 13. How Sam can sleep through the night in the car, laying down in a space that's a whole foot too short for him, Dean will never know. But the gentle snores coming from the back tell him that Sam's got it all figured out.
were an angel. And Cas was human -- like, always had been -- and a hunter.”
“Yeah.” They sit for a bit until Charlie breaks the silence. “What’d you say this guy’s name was?”
“Jesus dude, how are you this stealthy
“Yeah yeah, just get back to work. I’m not running a dating service here.” Bobby is clearly trying to look grumpy, but there’s a sparkle in his eyes as he shoos Dean away and it undoes all his hard work.
Dean rolls his eyes and shoos Charlie away with a patient smile. Rocky’s is small and crowded, Singles Night an obvious success, and Dean quickly snags the empty stool at the bar that’s as close to the door and as far away from the night’s festivities as he can get. After a couple of minutes of half-hearted attempts to flag down the guy slinging drinks he finally gets his attention, orders a beer, and settles in for a long evening of being where he doesn’t really want to be. At least Pamela keeps a well-stocked juke box.
“Oh, yes.”
“Yes,” Castiel replied.
Andy and Ash arrive shortly after and make a beeline for the snacks, and by the time the last guy shows up everyone’s made themselves comfortable on the big wraparound couch in the living room. Except for Cas, who’s sitting cross-legged on the floor and is already on step two of getting Charlie’s notoriously shy cat to come sit with him. He’s just about got the cat up to step three (very cautiously sniffing the hand) when the footfalls of someone in heavy boots scare the cat all the way back to zero.
Bobby moves around the kitchen, tidying up to pass the time and wiping down counters that don’t really need wiping. The nervous levity that filled the kitchen just a minute ago is gone. Sam’s looking down at his coffee, unseeing; Dean’s leaned back in his chair, bouncing a leg and resting his eyes; and Cas is Cas so even with his eyes closed Dean is sure he’s being stared at.
Dean smiles at this. “Actually yeah, I get that. So you were tired, that’s okay man. But what I don’t get is why you paid. I asked you on a date and
to open a coffee shop, the apocalypse or God’s sister or God himself isn’t going to come along and stop him.”
Maybe this
“Of course, Dean.”
Dean nodded, a lump in his throat. He knew where this was going. Everyone in this fucking Waffle House knew where this was going. The old guy in the booth on the other side of the restaurant could fully sense that he was a fuck up and a shitty boyfriend and he was about to get dumped.

“And Cas, which…” Sam squints over at his brother, questions -- so many questions -- flashing through his mind, but he pushes them aside for now because actually maybe Cas

think about.”
The camper itself is like the whole yard, but in miniature. Junk is arranged all around it, but instead of big things like bathtubs and dishwashers, it’s smaller things: sun bleached milk crates filled with old cans of turpentine; a pile of bicycle frames held together by some spiny desert weed that’s grown up through them; and a huge, flat coil of metal cable that’s come unspooled under its own size and weight. Sam follows the curve of the cable with his eyes as it loops around the back of the Airstream, then crouches down to check something on the other side of the mass of coiled metal.
Sam snorts. “Everyone in Fleetwood has long hair, Dean.”
In the silence, Dean can hear Sam’s muffled voice outside as he talks shop with Bobby. Cas is already far away again, listening to angel radio or staring through the fabric of space-time or whatever it is he does to track things down for the Winchesters. Between Sam and Cas and now Bobby, it seems the universe has decided break time’s over. Back to the grind. As much as he likes to make a show of lazing around, especially if it’ll annoy Sam, Dean’s a restless guy at heart and if he’s being honest a milk run of a case sounds pretty okay right now. And it's not like this has been a super awesome vacation to begin with… Except now that he thinks about it, it kinda has. Except for one thing.
About to be annoyed with himself for still being the first to arrive despite his best efforts, Cas hears Charlie talking to someone else and is immediately relieved.
Once he’s in the bathroom Cas just stands there, hunched over, hands balled into fists that don’t hang right from the ends of his arms. He takes a long moment, then abruptly picks up his toothbrush. It’s a deliberate action, like he has to tell his body to make the motion; he stands again, just holding it. He’s been meaning to brush his teeth all day, been meaning to shower all week. He’s not a slob, he can smell himself just as well as Dean can, and he knows he’ll feel better once he’s clean. It’s just…
runny eggs.”
.” Dean thunks his head on the tabletop.
“It doesn’t have to, you know." This is Sam quiet but certain, Mr. Sensitive here to save the freakin' day with a marriage counseling session or some shit.
Sam is already sitting at the small table in Bobby’s kitchen, the coffee mug in front of him adding yet another faint brown circle to the complex pattern on the stained wooden surface. It’s not that Sam’s being careless, it’s just that there is exactly one proper coaster in the whole house and it’s currently holding up the short leg of Bobby’s enormous desk. Like everything else about Bobby’s place, the kitchen table is so worn from years and years of hot meals and cold beers and the occasional sprawled out hunter groaning his way through a hasty late-night stitch job that the wear and tear has become strangely welcome, like the exhaustion is part of the charm. Bobby does his best to keep things clean, but other than a couple of flip phones labeled with masking tape and three-letter acronyms, and the big floppy-haired guy sitting at the table, nothing in this house dates past 1982.
Sam thinks for a moment before hesitantly suggesting a trip out to the Hoover Dam, which Dean loudly laughs at before reminding Sam that they drove over top of it last night as they crossed out of Arizona.
-- asks for it. Cas is in the back, perched right in the middle of the bench seat for some reason, clearly basking in the small joy of being included on this journey, of having friends and getting to be a friend. Which, goddamn that’s sad as hell and if the clench in his chest is any indication, Dean probably shouldn’t think too much more about it or he’ll spoil the fragile good mood he’s cultivated for himself.
But now Dean’s interest is piqued. "I mean, if there

“Excuse me?”
“Aren’t those banker’s boxes?”
"I can't, unless we switch positions."
(See the end of the chapter for
Rocky’s Bar is all the way on the other side of Sioux Falls, a squat shoebox of a building in the middle of nowhere a few miles northeast of the city limits. It’s doing pretty well for itself considering it’s at the ass end of one of those roads that start out as a main thoroughfare in town but lose lanes and get noticeably rougher the further out they get into the countryside. Rocky's owner, a woman named Pamela who is somehow both intimidating and friendly, whose honesty is always spoken with a warm smile and a sparkle in her eyes, probably has something to do with it. The fact that the place welcomes everyone except for the types who like to make other people feel
Oops, that one worked too well.
“Are all the monsters and shit gonna disappear? Are we not gonna be hunters? I’ve been there man, with the djinn, and it wasn’t good. We weren’t good.”
"Uh well y-yeah,” Dean’s mouth works a little, “but I mean
,” he says, rolling his shoulders like he’s trying to dislodge something that’s stuck to his skin, but there’s nothing there. “Light touch is, um, I don’t like it. Heavy touch, pressure, I like that.”
Dean’s about tell the man to find someone else when he’s interrupted by the blast of cold air that comes in through the front door along with the guy who’d opened it. At first he assumes the guy must be a straggler to singles night, but then he sees the weird look on his face, kind of a cross between angry and terrified and maybe also a little bit nauseous. And he’s looking a bit rumpled for someone hoping to score, like he read somewhere to wear a dress shirt on a date but just threw it on on top of the faded green t-shirt and tan cargo pants he was already wearing. On anyone else the combo might look like they’re trying too hard to be casual and cool, but on this guy it just looks sad. And maybe kind of endearing. And damn do those pants fit in all the right places, and anyway it's not as if Dean himself hasn’t shown up to Rocky’s dressed like a lumberjack.
, Sam.” Dean only has to think about Sam’s adventures in civilian life for half a second to come up with about a million questions. “How did you even get a job? You don’t have a work history.”
Another fifty after that, and Dean’s hungry again. Shit, he knew this was going to happen. Thankfully, Baby’s less than stellar gas mileage means Dean has an excuse to stop at a minimart and grab some snacks without having to come out and admit that Sam was right. The look on Sam’s face as Dean pulls into the no-name, one-pump station tells him it doesn’t matter and Sam knows it’s bullshit, but whatever.
Dean runs a hand down his face and is immediately aware of everything he hadn’t been aware of just a moment ago: the patch of dried drool on his cheek, his slimy teeth and fuzzy tongue, the way his jeans twisted uncomfortably as he slept, the fact that he’s still wearing his shoes for god’s sake. He’d been so comfortable just a moment before, and now all that’s dropped away. Dean can’t quite look at Sam, but he can tell just from the way he takes his next breath that Sam’s about to say something “important” so Dean cuts him off at the pass.
“Yes. I told him I’d be right back.”
“Don’t worry about it, I’m gonna drink it for you.”
, Castiel does not stop to preread it (there’s no need), and instead just pulls it from the rack and puts in his hand basket next to two tubes of powdered donuts and a package of beef jerky.
“I’ll continue monitoring heaven while you’re away and will let you know of any new developments.” Cas offers.
This whole time they’ve been eating Cas hasn’t looked at Dean, hasn’t even looked toward him. Dean’s been conversing with his profile while Cas looks away, the muscles in his neck tense. As soon as he’d finished with the sandwich and the water, one of Cas’ hands had come up to the side of his head to tap open-palmed on the space above his ear, something Dean knows he only does when he’s particularly distressed. The other is busy with the clenches and brisk finger flicks that are Cas’ usual low-key stims, but as soon as he hears the tension in Dean’s voice he stops and reaches over to grab Dean’s hand. Bringing it into his lap, Cas pets across the back of Dean’s hand and over his forearm the way a small child pets a cat -- fast and hard and repetitive. Cas’ other hand gets involved too, and it’s not long after that that he tips Dean over into his lap, hugging him close and humming into his shoulder. Dean laughs, lets himself be moved around until he’s somewhere comfortable for Cas, does a little wiggling of his own so
don’t give me caviar.”
The cook turned to start cooking, and Dean forced his eyes away from the way Cas’ uniform hugged his thighs and tried to focus on Lisa, who was radiating discomfort.
those times that he popped into Dean’s dreams before he knew that wasn’t a socially acceptable thing to do. Dean only remembered the dream at the lake, but there were others. There were also the times Cas materialized in the bathroom with Dean, in the bedroom with Dean, a second time in the bedroom with Dean, right next to the bed while Dean was “reading magazines”,
“Mmm. And coffee.” Cas gestures toward the line of dirty coffee mugs balanced on the arm of the couch.
“Hey uh, what are you doing in there?” Dean looks at Cas from the doorway of their bedroom, arms loose, face smooth, as disarming a posture as he can create.
Dean takes in both the brown and tan late-80s Ford and the guy who owns it and tries to decide if they make sense together.
five bodies are trapped inside the structure."
“Do you not… Is touch bad?” Before Dean can get too far down the path of figuring out how he’s supposed to be with a guy he can’t even touch, Cas pulls him back.
Dean swallows, then continues on. “The other reason is that my dad… Everyone always wants to know about how. How we lived like this, how we got there, how he could do that to us. Or why. And god, it would be so much easier to answer that if the answer wasn’t so goddamn
“If the celebration begins at nine then people will want to get there before nine. To ensure they’re there and… ready.”
A month and a half after joking about it that first time they do actually go to the butterfly house; neither of them are particularly enamored by it but it’s nice to do something that seemed so performatively significant and realize that it’s okay to not be into it, that this doesn’t say anything foreboding about their relationship. Also it’s cold as hell outside and the carefully maintained tropical warmth in the greenhouse is nice... for about five minutes until it’s not. They leave after twenty minutes, go get drive thru, and spend the rest of the evening making out in the car despite being a couple of grown men in their 30s.

stupid.”
Dean choked on his waffles.
“Do you really not remember that?”
Dean huffs out a breath, but his eyes are full of warmth when he says “I don’t want to make you self-conscious but uh, you’re not as subtle about hiding this as you think.” He thinks back on that first night walking along the road from Rocky’s, the way Cas had fidgeted with his hands then too, at the end of a stressful day. “You do this when you’re stressed. It makes you feel better.” He says it more to himself, like it’s a realization. Mostly because it is.
When Cas zapped him into this home, Dean’s first thought was that he was probably ruining the carpet, just by standing on it. It feels weird,
“Okay I get that but just listen. See, mandroids…”
“I just ---,” Dean ran his hand through the spikes in his hair. “I just want to make you happy!”
When Dean moves in with Cas it happens with straightforward simplicity, a whim that’s somehow solid and true instead of flippant and unconsidered. They’re at Cas’ as usual -- Bobby’s house is fine and Castiel does spend time with Dean over there, but they’ve found that trying to get hot and heavy in the same twin bed Dean’s slept in on and off since puberty is sort of a mood killer -- watching TV when the image on the screen wobbles a little and then goes black.
What follows is a private conversation in theory only. The complimentary breakfast of private conversations. It’s not that Dean’s yelling -- he’s not, his voice is a tensely whispered hiss -- it’s just that Charlie’s apartment is not large and despite technically being in another room, the conversation is happening about four feet away from everyone. Castiel sits and listens to himself being talked about and wishes he could shrink down and fit under the TV stand alongside the cat that will not be coming back out for the rest of the evening.
“I’m proud of the kid, of course. It’s just,” Dean sighs. “It’s not
“That's us too."
He went back to his waffles, making sure the syrup was drizzled perfectly in each of the pockets, so when he cut into them he’d get that burst of sweetness on every bite.
Cas has a less than complete grasp on the fundamentals of financial transactions, but he’s seen Dean leave money on diner tables enough times to know that the process involves neither waiting to be told a number nor waiting to find out if you’ve guessed the correct number. This doesn’t make a lot of sense to Cas, but he trusts that Dean knows what he’s doing so he grabs all the individually wadded up bills in his coat pocket, dumps them in a tidy pile on the counter, picks up the handbasket and the pie, and walks out of the store.
Dean glares at the light, like it’s the light’s fault Cas is out here in the first place. “Why?”
Dean walked. It felt like a dream, the silence following him as he walked up the aisle and through the door, straight to Baby. Automatically he reached into his pocket for his keys and then just stood there, hand aching around the fistful of jagged metal. He couldn’t seem to catch his breath.
“Well
her, and not like that. Just a friend who’s looking out for me, keeping me busy,” Dean clarifies. “Now can we get back to work?”
“But he’s okay?”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas says to a bewildered Dean Winchester, who only has time to open his mouth before Cas blips back out of existence, the sound of flapping wings the only indicator that he was ever there. “What the fuck,” Dean probably says.
“So they’re doing something wrong by hoping?”
“Oh, Dean,” Lisa said, covering her face in her hands and sighing. Dean felt himself getting red and chewed as fast as possible so he could swallow his ridiculously huge bite. Mildred patted him on the back.
And then he meets the guy and realizes he actually
After a few minutes of silence that probably should feel awkward but doesn’t, Jo comes by with the check. Cas takes it before Dean can, keeping it out of Dean’s reach even as he opens his mouth to protest. “Hey buddy, I’m the one who asked
of Sioux Falls -- gained some appeal. As far as bars went, Rocky’s wasn’t so bad at the right time of day on the right day of the week. It could be a nice quiet place to sit and read and sip a beer after work without being bothered and, more importantly, without bothering anyone. And the lighting levels were good, not dim enough to be sleazy, but not bright enough to be, well,
“Do you know what neighborhood you want to be in?” Lisa asked, pushing right past the awkwardness.
She took a deep breath and said, “Dean, we need to talk.” Dean’s heart dropped all the way into his stomach. He knew it. He fucking
Castiel doesn’t say anything.
Cas’ gummy smile started to wilt.

“Man, I am the
“Stories, Cas,” Dean answers flatly. “I guess the stuff Chuck wrote just wasn’t enough.”
“Hmm?”
Cas seems genuinely horrified, which is good for the state of Dean’s hackles but doesn’t really do anything to help Cas seem less weird. Like with the ziploc bag honey thing, Dean is definitely intrigued but he still can’t tell if it’s because he’s interested in the guy or if the guy is just interest
“Except for the times I was explicitly told otherwise.” The edge in Cas’ voice is clear as a bell even over the crappy rural Kansas connection.
“I’ll see you then, Dean.”
fuckin’ low. All day out in that damn junkyard Dean was getting whiffs of Detroit, but now all he smells is the simple clean of whatever stolen motel soap he’s lathering up with.
“I don’t get it,” Dean says as he navigates Baby onto the highway. “So we weren’t hunters?”
“More than one show.”
The “no shit” continues to hang in the air.
“This isn’t exactly a big town and the number of people who’re willing to spend a couple Fridays a month pretending to slay dragons is pretty small. And it’s not like we’ve never had mutual friends before. C’mon we both knew Andy.”
“Of course I will not murder you,” Cas looks down at the clerk’s nametag, “
Dean looks out over the landscape. There are mountains in the distance, the Rockies, he figures, but they don’t carry the promise of snow or pine trees or anything else cool and refreshing. They’ve been looming on the western horizon for the last few hours, jagged and brown and ominous and just a little too large for how far away they must be, and suddenly Dean realizes he doesn’t want to look at them anymore. Sam’s right, this doesn’t have to be a long haul. “Alright fine. Just a couple more hours.”
“I don’t want a curved television, Dean.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
“You wanna…” Dean gestures between the dryer and the hole, desperate to change the subject and get his brother and the angel to stop looking at him like that. Instead, Cas remains still, staring at Dean with a critical squint. “You gonna move this thing or are we standing out here all night?”
At that, Dean smiles down at Cas, then
Huh, that was easy.
“No, not at all.”
“Vegas, baby! Sin City!” Dean says a little too loudly and with an almost painful grin, drumming his hands over Baby’s steering wheel and trying not to think about how foreign it feels to be happy. Given all the crap he’s been through over the past few lifetimes he shouldn’t really be surprised.
Lisa leaned back in the booth and folded her arms, taking a deep breath.
"Hey Cas."
“McVie.”
“It makes sense, doesn’t it?”
us -- our, growing up -- but it sort of is. I mean, nobody but Sammy and me would know that but,” the apprehension over being laid bare goes unsaid.
“Good. What have you been eating?”
. Well, actually, retiring now sounds kind of awesome, giving the finger to Zachariah and Michael and all those other assholes, but I mean, yeah maybe.”
“I wish you’d asked me to stay.” Cas sounds raw, the hurt as fresh as the day he’d left.
“Dean,” she said gently. “If you aren’t ready to move in, that’s okay. It’s okay to take some time and make sure this is what you really want.”
“Why are we driving all the way out here again instead of going to the Roadhouse?” Dean asks, not bothering to disguise the annoyance in his voice.
“Cas, honey, let’s not think about that yet. Let’s… You said this might be nice? Let’s focus on that part right now.”
That’s not exactly what Dean was expecting and he doesn’t have a response prepared, so he just stands there soaking up the golden sunlight that’s finally cutting through the early morning chill and warming his back.
Dean thinks about this for a few minutes. “Alright, wait a minute. This is all great, you know, not having to save the entire freakin’ world every five minutes, but I got a few questions.”
“Oh,” he hears — feels — Amara breathe against his neck, and there’s a second voice on top of hers, deep and awed, “beautiful.”
(10:58pm)
The machine in the corner creates sound that no one listens to but everyone seems to know. Background vibrations, hummed along to absently, heads bobbing up and down in a recognizable rhythm – a meter so internalized that it’s become part of them.
Castiel makes a noise, its vocal chords straining and vibrating in its throat. Castiel has come to enjoy the sensation of producing sound while limited to a body – there is so much more feeling involved.
"Of course, Dean," Castiel says. It slowly brings its hand to its chest – massaging a hurt spot is soothing to human skin – and rubs. Dean's eyes flicker to where its hand is on its chest, and for a moment his soul glows so bright that it drowns out the vibrations of worship. Castiel feels it's necessary to avert its eyes, though the curious ache in its chest returns when it does.
That seems to snap Amara out of it, her eyes flicking back up to his, a hypnotic bl— brown. She blinks, eyelashes long, and her cheekbones seem sharper as she steps closer, her breasts pressing against his chest.
A breath in: chest expanding, diaphragm down, oxygen rushing, hold, hold, hold. Then, a breath out, bones and muscles moving back, relaxed.
“No,” Dean says, breathy.
, Castiel breathes out unwittingly. Hips —
Castiel looks down at itself. When God reconstituted Castiel's vessel, He did not neglect to include a heart with it.
, and that though he’s got people to wipe his ass for him right now, he’s going to need some help with that when he’s released in a couple of days, oh and about that release, is there someone who can drive him home?
“These people, flawed though they may be, are simply seeking distraction from a world that is impartial to their suffering, and also to their happiness. They’re creating their own meaning, as is everyone.” Cas pauses for a moment before continuing. “As are the angels, even. We may have knowledge of a broader context, but with God absent for so long our existence is ultimately just as unguided. I believe, given enough lack of purpose, I could seek comfort in the material.”
Castiel sees himself pulling Dean out of Hell. A small, wounded soul, wine-dark and raging as Castiel pulled him out. Castiel remembers when Dean relented, when his soul turned a deep red and reached out. Pulsing softly, melting; feelings so deep that Castiel couldn’t help but reach back.
Dean walks out. Castiel gathers its grace tightly to its core, tucked away in the aching place, and follows.
.” The word tumbles out of Castiel, unthinking. Loaded with something, the vowel stretching and shaping in Castiel’s throat and cradled in its —
The impulse has occurred to Castiel before, but it is suddenly struck by the.
“I don’t understand. I’ve healed you before.”
Her hand clamps over his shoulder as she kisses him, and Dean’s brain shuts down. He cracks open at the seams, her mouth firm against his, moving slowly, and he can’t help but move with her as the soft warmth pools in his guts and his heart, curling around his soul and pressing hard. The force of it steals his breath until he’s just panting against her mouth, and he’s hard in his jeans now, leaking into his underwear.
"Why did you call me?" Castiel asks. Its hand lands on the bar; wood, Castiel knows, overlaid with varnish, but... worse than normal, like it hasn't dried fully. Castiel squints at its fingers, rubbing them together, then brings them up to its nose. Bitter and sweet.
"Oh, right." Dean throws some bills on the bar. "This should cover it. Now let's go."
Dean Winchester is there; Castiel knows this. It takes the time to study the soft yellow glow coming from within, resonating with its grace.
. A breath. Carefully sucked in, lungs expanding, diaphragm drawing down. Castiel holds for a few seconds, taps fingers against the coat to enable counting.
“Cas, really, I patched him up with some whiskey and dental floss. Or, well, a lot of whiskey,” Sam murmurs. “Plus, Dean doesn’t want you to come over so you probably shouldn’t.”
“Leave,” he says softly, managing to untangle himself from her — slowly,
By the n.
Dean walks past the kitchen. He stops. Walks back. Looks at the kitchen again. The mayonnaise is still sitting on the counter, taunting. Dean narrows his eyes. Son of a bitch; he hasn’t eaten anything since this morning, and he definitely didn’t use any mayonnaise for that.
(Castiel is dripping onto his own belly, cock straining up, white smeared onto his skin. In Castiel’s head, the drops turn a dark red — hot against him, warm, pulsing. He clamps a hand down onto himself and holds on as a wave crests over him, flowing out of him like grace.)
, feels tight, drawn up, his grace swirling warm inside him and pressing to the surface. Dean’s skin is fine against his fingertips, paper-thin, barely able to conceal Dean’s insides.
The hotel room is clean and empty. The walls are a dark blue, kitchenette set in a niche against the wall. The bedding is off-white and brown, devoid of any obvious stains but still grimy.
"Dude, that's just normal bar grime. You know, spilled beer, smeared grease, that sorta thing?"
Castiel doesn't w.
Castiel drifts out of time, wings gently moving back and forth to navigate the stream. He sees: Dean, laid out, panting. Head thrown back. His shirt is held up to show his wound, a dark red.
There is no one around: Castiel spills out a bit, to experience the night in its full breadth.
Castiel wants to consume him, wants to make Dean swallow down his grace and burn everything away, wants to sink his vessel’s teeth into Dean’s skin, his guts, sip on his blood and crack open his ribcage.
Dean Winchester motions towards Castiel when he sees it. Castiel should bristle at his presumption, as its siblings would, but it sits down on the stool next to Dean anyway.
"Dean!" Castiel calls after him, confused. "I don't have any money."
“Dean,” Castiel asks in his head. Dean’s eyes open a fraction, filled with tears and gleaming green. “Can I?”
“Stop,” he says, and Dean looks up at him, green eyes big. “Let me.”
hips pivot off the bed.
The bottle is lukewarm in his hand — definitely room temperature — but when he opens it and sniffs it, it smells alright. Back in the fridge it goes.
Dean sighs, sipping at his beer. His soul remains the same. Curious.
Streetlights, Castiel has observed, only exude enough light to allow humans to see the shapes of things. When confined to the limited perception of this form, everything is painted a muted yellow.
Her hand comes up to cup his cheek, and the sense of relief is so great that he melts against her. The sharp cutting in his gut softens, and he feels like he can breathe again, when —
Shivering, Castiel brings up a hand. A path of blood up Dean’s chest, smearing Dean in his own life, vibrant in a way he hasn’t been since Castiel raised him.
Castiel puts his fingers in Dean.
It snaps back into itself as the tug grows strongers, as part of its grace calls out for the rest. Dean Winchester’s soul is vibrant enough that Castiel feels Dean ask even if he is not aware.
Remembering that Dean was hurt, he grabs his phone. Sam has texted him an address.
People are sequestered in groups of families and friends, sat on unforgiving benches. Their heads are bowed, illuminated by the neon glow of the windows. Not all of the benches are occupied: there is ample space between them, yet they are clustered together in silence or furtive whispering.
Weird.
As Castiel had laid Dean in his coffin, soul shining through the gaps between his dried and cracked bones, Castiel had made a decision. Taking clay and grace, malleable and wet, Castiel had crafted Dean lovingly. Shaped grace to form, to curves of muscle and skin, free of all marks except the one on his shoulder.
“No!”
"Dude!" Dean squeaks. The bartender leaves a shot on the bar. Dean ignores her, so Castiel does too. "I know you're... an angel of the lord or whatever, but that's not something you say to another guy."
Castiel jolts at the touch to his dick, his fingers firm around the base. His toes curl. He’s — Dean, Dean has done this before, grabbed himself and offered his body up to pleasure. Castiel drags his fingers up slowly, warmth shivering through him as he touches himself, and thinks about Dean doing the same, Dean —
“Please, Cas,” Dean begs.
“Dean,” she sighs, and it shivers through him, spreading through his chest, one hand letting go of the counter without him knowing it. His eyes flick to her mouth, then to her eyes, then her hands, then her mouth again. He sees her lips form the words before he hears her say them: “You’re... angry?”
It’s Castiel’s understanding that paying for services is a regular human practice. Once, it observed a church service, tucked away in a corner. When people had asked it for donations at the end, it had been unable to provide them with any.
"You called me here for earthly pleasures?"
Dean sucks in a breath. “Don’t—”
Need to take and be taken, to have Dean open his mouth and let Castiel flow into him willingly.
“Dean—” she tries to say, all reasonable and calm, and Dean hates her so fiercely. He hates her. His heart is pounding again, but this time with an anger so big that he thinks he’s going to faint.
Feathers trill. Curious: Castiel doesn’t see anyone else —
He doesn’t think about what just happened.
Castiel frowns, and swallows. Weird reflexes. It opens its mouth to decline.
“Hey, Cas!” Sam says, panting slightly. “How are you?”
Amara’s smile widens, lips drawn up. Dean can’t stop looking at them — perfectly pink, not chapped at all, plump. He knows she’s walking closer to him, can see her do it, but he can’t move or walk away. His mouth is dry, and he’s never felt this way about a woman before, never. She’s going to try to kiss him. She’s going to try.
“See?” Amara says, her hand moving from his shoulder up into his hair. Her long nails scrape his scalp as she moves her fingers through his hair, and he leans into her, panting against her neck. “Doesn’t it feel good when you give into me?”
Dean opens for him, warm and inviting; his ribs snap with a crack. Dean groans, the electric impulses in his brain firing all at once, tickling the edges of Castiel’s skin.  Mouth slack, red. Breaths come out through his nose. Face softly frowning, but open, split down the center and beheld by Castiel.
A truck drives by and the air vibrates against skin, a hot blast that causes perspiration to bead. Castiel swallows back and looks down: shoes’ tips are balanced on the edge of the sidewalk. Shoulders drawn up tight and hunched below the trench coat, Castiel’s wings are tucked close.
Castiel is very good at watching – it is what God created Castiel for. Even when limited to two eyes, Castiel has found itself to be very good at watching Dean.
Castiel sinks his fingers inside.
Castiel sits down slowly, fingers balled on knees, nails catching against skin. He reaches out a hand, trailing it down the bedding. Dean has laid here. If Castiel tries hard enough, he can still feel the remnants of his own grace, resonating back.
He’s hard.
A deep breath out. The mayonnaise is in the fridge and the kitchen is clean. He needs some whiskey.
A scrape. Blood smeared on skin, edges of the injury bared and open. Dissonant.
"You poor repressed bastards. What do you even do on your day off if you don't have heavenly restaurants."
Want to keep this to itself. But Dean has asked it to, so it will.
Dean stops.
“And I appreciate that, man, I really do,” Dean says. He is talking fast, words tripping out of his mouth, “but it isn’t necessary. I’m sure you have important things to do. You know, search for God, spread yourself thin over New Mexico, that sort of thing.”
For the first time since he’s seen her, she touches him, and he feels nothing at all. The dampness of his boxers is cold and gross, and whatever he was feeling moments ago turns sour so quick he almost vomits. Her hands stop moving, like she can sense the turn he’s taking.
"I don't know," Castiel says honestly. "It's probably easier now that I'm not at full power."
A warehouse. Dean collapsed against the wall, sitting on concrete. Castiel kneels down next to him, close, close enough that the air Dean displaces washes over him. Dean’s breath comes out in fast little puffs, and he touches the wound.
(Castiel tightens his fingers around himself, the fabric of his underwear soaked and sticking to him.)
Amara’s nails dig into his shoulder and electricity shoots down to his core, cutting violently, and he wrenches his head back to gasp at the pain. The warmth returns even harder, swelling up so fast that he feels his own edges begin to blur. He arches his back, trapped between the kitchen counter and Amara, and comes in hot, aching pulses into his boxers.
Their mouths form unthinking patterns, like they are reading from a book Castiel doesn’t see. Preoccupied with food, their hands move slowly in mundane motions – up, then down. Low moans of appreciation rise every once in a while.
The corner of her mouth twitches upwards. He’s never felt this way about a woman before and he hates her for it. He wants to kiss her.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel says, sound fluttering out faster than expected.
“He'll have a shot,” Dean says with a wink. He turns to Castiel. "Can you even get drunk?"
“I said,” Dean growls, pulling his forgotten gun out of the back of his jeans. This won’t hurt her, and he isn’t even sure if he can pull the trigger, hands shaking, but he pulls it on her anyway, “
“I know. But it’s better this way.”
And then. He. And.
fingers press the button with the green (very light green, now that Castiel is confined to a vessel and the yellow casts shadows) horn on it. The depression makes the plastic catch against fingertips.
Castiel thinks about hanging up and calling Sam instead. Then, muted:
The ceiling is spackled white. Castiel conjures up shapes. Dean, here, eyes closed, mouth open. Face relaxed in sleep. Shirtless; the handprint on his shoulder there for Castiel to see, to touch, burning bright white-blue in the dark.
Dean calls out. Castiel listens to Sam’s nails scrabble against the receiver. There’s more yelling and huffing, ending in conspicuous silence.
Dean slaps its hands away. The contact burns.
Ah. Dean is uncomfortable. Castiel makes sure to turn away.
"You're kidding me. You've been working since what – the Third Day?"
“Uh,” Dean says. His breathing is soft over the phone. Castiel presses the phone closer to an ear to hear it better. “Hey Cas. Coming on a little strong there.”
"Come on, man, loosen up a little. You're drawing attention."
“Why are you calling, Dean? Do you need me for something?”
Some shifting in the background. Another voice: Sam. Castiel is glad that Dean isn’t alone.
The vessel’s — Castiel’s,
The fingers — its —
“I know I’ve caused you pain,” she says, and she sounds sad about it too. Dean touches the damp cloth behind him. “I know you care about him deeply. Your angel, Castiel.”
A spasm in his chest; another one; it aches. Castiel brings up a hand to rub the spot but it doesn’t stop hurting. He lies down. He doesn’t know — this body…
Cas makes enough coffee to fill Dean's thermos.
Dean nods.
[8.12., 10:51] Dean: I am an open book. Ask anything you want to know
"So that should stop, if he keeps going call him lovemuffin."
He crawls up to Cas' face. " I wanted to make you come but my jaw hurts." He says dejected. "Can I kiss you?"
[5.12., 19:24] Dean: And I don't know how to explain it better
[3.12., 10:19] Dean: What now
Cas sees Dean fall and runs to him faster. He drops to his knees beside him
Dean sits up against the headboard making an effort to stay awake. He pets Castiel’s head and runs his fingers through the soft hair.
[27.12., 20:47] Dean: It would be closer and more but not really all the way?
[15.12., 12:43] Castiel: 😊
[7.12., 10:16] Castiel: Did I lose you?
[15.12., 21:17] Dean: Well
"Well, I wouldn't let Dean wax you there. Maybe let him do ankles? Armpits?" Charlie says.
[3.3., 11:50] Castiel: ?
Dean moves from under Castiel, further onto the bed and spreads his legs.
Dean whimpers. "Yes, Sir. I would like that, a lot." He looks down to the floor ashamed.
Dean steps out and takes a deep breath. Cas is right behind him.
[2.12., 13:37] Castiel: Because that's what I do.
"Babe, Sir. Please." Dean begs. Cas pushes his finger slowly into Dean's hole.
"Oh God, yes." Cas keeps stroking Dean as his head falls back and he breathes harder. "Dean. Oh my Dean." He bucks and writhes.
"I'm so deeply sorry you have to deal with that. Are you insured for stuff like that?"
[26.1., 10:26] Dean: Swollen?
"That's why it's vegetables. "
" At myself Yeah. Gordon too."
"Yes!" Dean hisses. "So fucking sensitive. "
Cas drapes his arm over his eyes.
"Well, I think Cas is right. Talking to Benny won't change much if he already believes you."
[18.3., 11:38] Dean: Uhm
Back in the kitchen he hears Cas put on a documentary on Netflix. He grabs the food and carefully crawls back into their fort.
Dean comes back out a little while later, eyes red rimmed but smiling.
[8.12., 09:55] Dean: Ok. Sexting is not just for couples that don't live together.
"No. I just want to cuddle."
[6.12., 22:11] Dean: Just like rubbing on each other and get off?
[8.12., 13:49] Dean: Yeah
"Ok." Dean smiles. "Can we go get ice cream to celebrate me being almost done?"
Cas feels lighter. He's glad he could talk to Dean openly about his sexuality and he loves the date feeling of tonight. "Dean? Can we keep on doing Date a little longer and go for a walk?" He asks still by the front door and giving Santana scratches.
He's trying to calm his racing heart and pulls Cas closer. Soaking up his warmth and having his breath hit his cheek.
"Yes, I would love that."
"I'm... oh fuck." Dean whines and curls in on himself as much as he can with Cas in top of him. He rests his head on Castiel's shoulder. "Right there. Babe! Fuck!"
[26.3., 14:13] Gabe: What do you need a brain for?
Cas nods.
[7.12., 19:45] Dean: I have cereal
Sam shakes his head. "Hey Castiel. On that topic. When do you think I can move?"
[28.1., 13:09] Castiel: Yes
"But then we can't tan."
[5.1., 15:59] Dean: What time is it? If its in the morning we could go together after breakfast
Cas kisses Dean quickly then gets into the tub. Dean kneels next to the tub and soaps up Cas favorite loofah.
[13.1., 11:42] Castiel: Should I bring you some lunch?
[5.2., 07:49] Dean: If I am gonna keep his girlfriend away I'll have to bring bribes for the dark lord. Don't want to get cursed.
[5.7., 14:14] Dean: No. We worked on my 'daddy issues' some more and she helped me feel a bit better about the situation. But she wants to see you as well.
[26.12., 11:32] Dean: Im shaking a bit
" Oh fancy!"
[15.2., 11:07] Dean: Like a blown light bulb...
"Hey, awesome! Nerd." Dean laughs.
"Hi Sam. Glad to hear you say that."
"Do you not want me to? I... uhm." Dean runs his hands through his hair. "Remember the upsetting messages? The asshole that sent them must have seen us holding hands while out one night. Meaning he lives somewhere here in the neighborhood.  I emailed my boss screen shots of them and wanted him fired. Gordon agreed. Now I , I like holding your hand but I also like knowing he might see us."
Cas just kisses him in reply.
[15.12., 09:46] Castiel: Ooooh, that is amazing! I'm so happy for you
"What is?"
[20.1., 10:56] Dean: Ok
[26.12., 21:41] Dean: Your house
[11.5., 18:02] Gabe: Wow. You gonna have your own bees!!!!! You can choose a queen from me.
"It's 90 minutes cause I hadn't been there in a while. And of course I pick you up."
"Ask. What do you want to know? I'm an open book. "
[2.1., 22:57] Dean: And beans
"Was it too much? Did I go overboard again? And what the hell were you talking about today?"
Dean gets dressed slowly and walks downstairs to make coffee and get ready.
Dean visibly relaxes.  "Thank you, Sir. " He gets up and starts cooking while Cas lays back down.
[24.12., 23:38] Dean: I think I take those
"I get that. Like I said. Don't worry about it. I've gone so long without, I can wait. Plenty of things to learn still. I am sorry if that confession made you uncomfortable. "
"Come on, say it." Castiel prompts.
"See you later."
[26.12., 11:19] Dean: Savd the sheet
[15.2., 11:36] Dean: Man I am gonna have to get out of bed here soon
"Nice thought, you look so gorgeous."
"Gay Avengers? Oh, I'm just waiting for my baby boy to show up." Donna shales her head in worry.
"Oh?"
Dean runs his hands over Cas back and arms, into his hair and everywhere he can reach and is allowed to touch
They stumble to the bedroom. Lucifer and Santana are curled up on their bed having hid up here when the house got fuller. They are both asleep. Dean snorts and goes to change and wash up.
[24.2., 15:41] Dean: Done
"I meant the sappy stuff. Of course I kiss my wife. I keep the sappy stuff private."
"He does? Damn. It's that far into the year already? What about you and your finals?"
"Real food, Dean. We need real food."
Dean and Cas stay for a few more minutes until they hear Cas phone go off. Its Donna messaging him.
[26.12., 09:47] Dean: You left a piece of fabric here
"Let me take you upstairs and help you." Castiel gets up too and lays his arm around his waist to guide him.
"Handmaiden. Take my beloved to the other room please so me and your beloved can work."
[3.2., 09:28] Dean: I prefer one over the other.
"Hmmmm.... Now? Or would you like a fashion show first?"
"Right." Cas takes a deep breath and a big gulp of his juice.
[26.12., 11:03] Dean: 3 fingrs is
Dean nods and hands him his phone.
"I could jump you everytime I see you.  Sometimes I just want to bend for you and offer my ass up."
[8.12., 15:04] Dean: I FEEL like a teenager with a crush
"Ok." Dean gets up and heads to the bathroom  to take it off and clean up his crotch quickly. He walks back into the bedroom and climbs back into bed.
[29.1., 09:56] Castiel: Who?
I am not in a good head space at the moment and can't say when I will update here again. I am sorry. I know we all want to know what Missouri has to say.
Dean slips a hand into Cas pants and starts kneading his ass cheek, pulling him down whenever Dean thrusts up. "Oh shit! Angel! "
"It didn't seem fair."
"Oops." Dean drips sirup onto Cas finger and licks it up.
"Hmmm. Can we stay here all day?"
[15.12., 21:06] Castiel: Yes, he is
Gabriel sighs defeated.  "I can't do this again Cassie.  Not without hurting him."
[22.1., 09:26] Gabe: Is he respectful
Dean nods. He raises his arms to help.
[31.3., 21:11] Castiel: Yes, go ahead. But you better keep your eyes on the street, keep us safe
"Besides. I like kissing you. I just don't like how this situation makes me feel."
[6.12., 22:25] Dean: And the heat coming through it
"The bedroom is not boring. Some of the most interesting things happen there."
[6.12., 19:10] Castiel: He's mostly okay, really.
[13.12., 19:08] Dean : Yes
"Dean put a damn lot of work and research into that slide show, Gabriel."
[3.2., 09:32] Dean: How the fuck would you know how big my dick is?
"Yay me. I guess. I have no idea where that came from."
Cas sits down too. "It all looks so delicious."
"Good. Thank you. I love you. Good night Angel. "
"Oh fuck yes. Look at you. You're so gorgeous when you come." Dean whines. He takes his hand from Cas cock and licks the cum of his fingers.
[8.12., 12:23] Dean: Just turned 21 on the 2nd
"Hmmm, true." Cas nods.
"Who are you texting, Babe?"
"Holy shit."
Cas gets up and quickly kisses Dean's cheek before he joins her at the bar.
[7.12., 20:42] Castiel: He looks very handsome
[30.3., 23:36] Dean: Nothing on Sunday? Could we run away Sunday to Tuesday?
[6.12., 21:41] Dean: Where should I touch you
Dean gets up and hugs Castiel.  "God I am glad you are ok.
Cas cringes. "Oh crap, I'm so sorry!!! Please forgive me!"
"Sorry I had to ruin our day with repairs."
Dean sits down on the grass. "Slowly Ok. I'll stay here and watch you this time. We are close enough that they fly past me. Next time I will sit closer."
[21.1., 14:20] Dean: Yay
"No, I'm fine, really."
[13.12., 19:58] Dean : 2 fingers doesn't work
[23.12., 01:05] Castiel: Ewwww
[26.12., 12:18] Dean: I
Dean looks down chastised . "I am sorry."
"Anything for you."
Cas takes a quick shower and changes into sweatpants before joining Dean in bed.
[15.2., 10:13] Castiel: How was it at Cain's?
"Look at me. I am two fingers in... almost there.'
[13.12., 08:04] Dean : Huh
[13.12., 20:20] Castiel: Come for me, Babe
[16.2., 14:27] Dean: What?
"I'd love to accept that promise, but I won't. Because no one knows what the future holds."
[22.1., 17:43] Castiel: If you want... 🙂
Dr. Mills nods. "Keep going. Just read it out."
[3.3., 14:55] Dean: Like tonight?  Or Friday?
[13.12., 19:24] Castiel: Cup the head, make it wet with your precum
"You're amazing, Babe. I haven't felt such a tight hole in forever. I don't think I ever touched a virgin."
They find what they are looking for quickly. Dean gets more and more gropy the closer they get to the exit.
"That's wonderful. I loved the idea when I heard of it. But long car rides with the little one are torture." Zeke chuckles.
Dean buckles into Cas passenger side and is quiet the whole way to the diner Cas has chosen.
Dean checks the time. "It's getting late. Bedtime?'
[4.12., 13:41] Castiel: Yuck
"That cage and my butt plug..." Dean ends on a whimper and bites his lip.
"I like when I can just give Dean pleasure. Just give him everything without him feeling he has to give anything back."
"Dude, you have no idea what you lost. " Dean agrees.
Castiel just nods and they make out all the way through the movie and another one before Dean asks to go to bed.
"I'm nice too. Sorry. I made you broth."
[25.12., 16:31] Dean: The brother talk
"We can." Cas agrees.
Castiel nearly jumps out of his skin and runs to the door.
"Are you scared to tell us your deep dark secrets? Come on Dean. Don't be shy. We won't bite... unless...?" Garth teases and Dean blushes even darker.
Dean swallows and nods as he lays back into the pile of pillows behind him.
Cas grins. "I love you."
"Ooooh!!!" Gabe nods. "Nice punch, babe." He grins.
Cas nods slowly.
[3.12., 10:55] Dean: Yeah
"I'm the Princess." Cas says.
[18.3., 09:08] Castiel: Good
Dean rubs his face. "Babe, I can't look at lace without thinking of you. The feeling of my silky boxers reminds me of your robe. When your face is scratchy I remember how it feels on  the inside of my thighs.  You have been in every fantasy since we started sexting."
[18.3., 12:30] Castiel: Me too
"I made coffee and toasted bagels."
"Sweet. And the nest?" Dean grins.
Dean gently pulls out and throws the condom away. He brings a wet washcloth and cleans off Castiel.
[7.1., 13:57] Castiel: Dean!
Cas moves his head to nib his earlobe. "May I suck you today?" He husks barely audible.
[22.1., 12:06] Castiel: It's not going to be more than what i stated before
Castiel moans and moves closer.
[15.2., 15:34] Castiel: You agreed to head to Gabriel's with me and you're taking over your car, so I'd gamble high and say yes
Dean unwraps himself from Castiel's arms and goes to the bedroom to change.
"So what are we doing now?" Cas looks at Dean.
Dean looks at Cas.  "Can I ask you something?"
"It's been a while since I've been to a club like that."
[6.12., 14:55] Castiel: Oh
"Yes, let's go cuddle our babies."
"Funny you should say this." Dean answers. "Castiel has a proposition for you."
"Hi!" Cas beams and just smiles, happy to see Dean.
[6.12., 12:44] Castiel: Oh, nice!
"No, let me. You're sick, you go cuddle up on the couch and start watching your movies."
"No. No tears. Come on. Let's get you moved you softy." Charlie hugs him back before she pushes him towards the house.
[25.12., 21:29] Dean: But all were real
[4.2., 08:23] Castiel: Get out of my head
"No!  Never! I hope you know that."
Cas hums happily feeling Dean fuck his mouth.
"Me too. Just don't burst into my weekends unannounced..."
"Okay."
[4.3., 11:13] Castiel: They just introduced a new colleague to us to start work in our sales department on Monday.
"You are wearing one." Dean points out. "I don't want to stick out."
[12.1., 09:19] Dean: It's  a lot of work to fix the last 3 years but then it shouldn't be more then 5 to 10h a week
Our goal is to go back to daily postings. Fingers crossed.
He pulls off, " what do you want me to do?"
"You did?"
Dean looks over to the couch and sighs. "I want to help and comfort him but I am so angry. Angry that he got scared, fucking furious that someone broke into my house and.. " he breaks off and shudders.
“I could come over to heal it for you,” Castiel offers. Wings draw together tightly, tensing as Castiel prepares to fly to the address Dean will give.
, Castiel thinks, imagines, envisions, begs, prays.
Sam’s voice echoes through Castiel’s being, on repeat:
Castiel reaches out to catch his wrist.
"The First Day, but yes."
A ringtone echoes through the soft yellow dark. It’s shrill compared to the buzzing of insects and the distant hum of cars. Castiel moves a hand down the coat, into a pocket. The fabric envelops skin and sticks to sweat.
The claim on his soul was never enough for Castiel. It looks at the pout on Dean's lips, suspended over a tepid bottle of beer, and it
Holding Dean. He’s holding Dean in his palm, his heart beats fast like Castiel’s wings. So fast it’s almost still, drowning in pleasure and ecstasy, caught in the gravity of sensations. The muscle squelches against his fingers and Castiel soothes it, presses his lips to the warm, pulsing organ.
Amara raises an eyebrow, prim, hands still reaching out for him. “You forget, Dean, that I know you. You aren’t angry, but you feel ashamed for having enjoyed this. Free yourself from your own expectations, and accept me—”
That moment, just a split second, unnoticeable even to Zachariah. That moment, as Castiel started to seep into Dean, slowly, and Dean had sung out in agony and pleasure and had welcomed him in.
"But–"
A hitched breath. Then: “
A bell sounds as it opens the door.
“Yeah, well,” he bites out, pressing himself harder against the kitchen counter.
Castiel presses a palm to Dean’s side, just brushing the bloodied edges of the wound, feels Dean from the outside. Dean’s breath hitches, his chest drawn in under Castiel’s hand, then slowly relaxing again. Castiel rubs a little, to soothe, to placate, and when he looks up, Dean is staring at him again.
cock… it moves. In his pants.
"Thanks, Cas–" (Castiel drifts out of time. Vasodilation is a sign that it isn't experiencing a heart attack, but discomforting all the same. It always wants to atone for what it did to Anna, but it prays for her guidance again, even though she isn't there to give it.) "– but I think I'll do this the old-fashioned way."
There is no time attached to this, so it sits there, above the glass. Only when the air around them has started pulsing with the soft yellow of worship does Castiel draw back into itself, and resume its place in time.
of anticipatory reception, the corners dimpled with what Castiel has come to recognize is a combination of exasperation, disgust, and fondness.
He can feel her smile against his mouth, and then her tongue is in his mouth, and his hand moves up to cup at her collarbone. Joy leaks into him at the touch, intoxicating, his heart not even racing but his hands shaking as more of the warmth pours into him and washes everything away, pulsing softly, glowing inside him.
She comes to a stop right in front of him. He isn’t hard, but he’s panting so hard, and he knows he’d let her do anything she wanted.
, Dean breathes, his eyes sinking closed.
Sharp cheekbones. A pouting mouth. Eyes big and dark, hair flowing over her shoulders. A hook in his gut that pulls with almost aching tenderness and has his hands clenching around the counter. She’s almost heartbreakingly beautiful, too much to look at all at once. He only ever looks at her in pieces.
“O-oh,” Castiel breathes. The sound whistles weirdly through his teeth. There is… He needs… “I could—”
“No!” Dean yells, voice going higher. Castiel frowns.
Castiel nods. Dean sips at his beer, then licks his lips. He shifts when he realizes Castiel is watching him, clears his throat. The bottle is empty.
The lit-up pixels of the screen say
Amara gasps and steps back. When Dean opens his eyes, she’s staring at his shoulder, her hand stuck in the space between them. The warmth drains from him until the scratching sensation pulling him to Amara is back.
Dean doesn’t say anything. Between the residual warmth in his stomach and her hands still on his skin, he can’t find the air to breathe. He wants her to leave, but more than that he wants her to stay and do it again, he wants to give himself over to her, and feel that warmth again.
A flash. It lands in front of a restaurant. The road is abandoned: a lone street light flickers, then dies out.
