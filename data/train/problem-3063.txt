Sam gave him a curious look but before he could say anything else, Cas came striding back into the sphere of firelight and, for a split-second, Dean saw the flames reflected in his blue eyes and the wings folded loose by his sides, and he had to look away.  Sometimes it was so easy to forget that Cas wasn't human.  He'd learned to walk and talk like one so well that it often slipped Dean's mind.  But now it was impossible not to remember that he was a completely different species.  Not that it bothered him, it was just strange having known Cas so long and having never seen this part of him; this part that was more
When they got back to the cabins the second time, both brothers stumbled to a halt and then simultaneously doubled over laughing.
“What is the meaning of this interruption?”  she ground out between her teeth, apparently angry with their mere presence.  “Jarl Balgruuf is
“I don’t know what that is.  They are as tall as you and me and stand upright, wear armor, carry weapons, wield magic.  They have a reputation for being incredibly intelligent and infinitely devious.”
No longer serving the purpose of holding him down, since he wasn't struggling, the hands retreated and were replaced with strong arms wrapping all around him, holding him against something solid and soft and warm. There was a heartbeat against his ear and gentle fingers in his hair and Castiel told himself not to listen to any of it.
“Listen Cas, we gotta eat soon,” he told the angel as he and Sam climbed back up the shallow bank.  “Too much more hiking across this kind of terrain without any fuel and we're gonna start slowing you down big time.”
Garth was at the far end, by himself, his long skinny legs propped up, giving the illusion of ease even though his posture was stiff and anxious.
“I don’t know.  I have no name, race, or title.  I have nothing and my connection with the Greybeards was severed before they could tell me anything else.  I tried to contact them again but received no answer.”
The two of them scarfed down the carrots and apples that had been sitting on the shelves – thankful that the weather had been cool enough to keep them somewhat fresh – and then joined Cas out in front of the shack.
if they were feeling nosy.  He didn’t know what it meant that Liam was asking Cas to do that now, but it must be important, given the circumstances.
care.  So long as Cas kept his promise, that was all that mattered.  Besides, he likely wouldn't even understand Cas' explanation anyway.
Once the vice around his throat eased, Dean looked up at Doctor Owen, who looked grave and sympathetic – everything a doctor should be in this situation.  He took a step into her personal space and she leaned away, her eyes flicking over his face uncertainly, reading the level of threat in his expression.
He refilled his glass with Crowley’s froofy scotch, daring Sam to say something about it with a cutting look.  Surprisingly, though, Sam refilled his own as well.
Cas’ voice was small and meek, as if he already knew Dean was going to leave him behind and, as soon as Dean was out of the room, he was going to need to find a garbage can retch in to.  His stomach was already heaving, his breath shallow and fast as he backed away to the door.
.  Like someone had wrapped him up in red-hot barbed wire.  It was not unlike the squeeze of Lucifer’s grace.
and dragging his fingertips across his closed eyes as if to scrub the exhaustion from them.  “Yes, I have different kinds of feathers.”
.” Dean let his head fall back against the wall, letting the truth of that statement wash over both of them, hoping Castiel could hear the sincerity in his voice. “I just want you to be fucking happy for once because no one has deserved more and gotten less than you. It's not fair.” He shook his head, tried to think of the best way to make Cas understand what he meant. “And, for the record, it doesn't matter what your happy is, you just gotta find it. Doesn't matter if it's growing flowers or collecting stamps or fly fishing or eating bad food and drowning yourself in Netflix – whatever it is, man, it doesn't matter. I just want you to feel
told the truth then ‘cause next thing I know they’ve got him tied to a stretcher while they sedate him.”  He ran a hand down his face while Sam cursed in his ear some more.  “They tied him down, Sammy.
Cas couldn't go down hill again, not now that everything was done and over with. Not now that they finally had a chance to relax and sort through some of their shit.
Castiel’s tasted like rain water and clean air and Dean slid his arm around his waist, under his wings, and pressed closer, feeling Cas’ lips moving tentatively, softly, against his.  He was sure he could
After he’d relieved himself, Castiel headed for the shouting, which seemed to be rising in volume and surprise, surprise, when he got to the war room, Sam and Dean were standing on opposite sides of the large table, roaring at each other like a couple of angry lions over a watering hole.
Guilt tugged at his gut all the same, as fresh and sickening as the day after the mark had been erased from his arm. He knew what Cas was reliving, knew what was making him flinch every few seconds even though he was staring blankly. Dean saw it too, every time he closed his eyes..
Thorygg had fixed the third soldier with an icy stare.  "Oh?"  he asked, low and dangerous.  "And let the reach of Oblivion's
“I’m so lost,” Sam admitted.  “Cas is like…a billion years old.  How can he still have his baby feathers?”
Dean felt his gut swoop with every sharp movement, blown away by the agility Cas displayed.  It was quite easy then, to picture Cas decked out in heavenly armor, wielding a blazing angelic sword, leading his garrison into battle.
"You make terrible coffee, Cas, I'm not letting you near that machine without adult supervision." he pushed his fingers into Cas' hair, grinning when the angel made a soft noise.
And when Cas woke up he was always so grumpy and squinty and his cheeks were always a little flushed and he always sought out Dean right away because Dean always made sure there was fresh coffee in the pot for when Cas woke up. He'd watch the angel stumble into the kitchen, looking more like a disheveled kitten than a warrior of God, and his blue eyes would latch on to the coffee pot, there mere sight of which was enough to give him a boost.
“Come with me.  The three of you.  Irileth, Proventus,” Balgruuf gave Irileth and the man standing beside his throne a pointed look when they moved to follow the Jarl as he stepped down.  “Stay here.”
to put under Cas' head or over his legs.  Usually the angel's skin was a warm and dark, but in the moonlight his face looked pale and eerily still.  He looked unchracteristically vulnerable, laying there in clothing that wasn't his suit and trench coat, with those big, kind of delicate looking wings.  Like an injured bird.
.  They were vampires, werewolves, wendigos, various forgettable monsters…and angels.  So many angels.  Some of them had died angry, rage in their eyes even after Dean had speared them on the end of a borrowed angel blade.  But most of them…most of them all had the same flash of shock, sometimes confusion, right after he landed the fatal blow.  Like they didn’t
“Well…Cas said no two angels have the same color feathers and that the color of their feathers is shaped by their grace.  And remember that guy?  The one you said tried to read Cas’ mind but all he saw was colors?  Well, when we helped him to his room earlier and he saw the…the nest or whatever, I saw his eyes turn gold a little bit.  Like not his actual eye balls, but his grace.  I mean, it was a color, and color shouldn’t feel like anything, but…I dunno.  It felt warm or good or…something.  Do you think…does that make sense?”
.  Stop jumping to conclusions and keep your mind open.  You have asked me here for a reason and it is because you do not understand your friend
meet their eye.  Shame was curling in his chest like a slimy, writhing snake.  Some solider he was. Too afraid to even open his eyes.
of concern, Castiel realized he was only becoming more agitated.  His grace, damaged as it was, was still pumping through him in angry waves and the tingle of adrenaline in his limbs was distracting.
“Now just listen,” Crowley said soothingly.  “My angel guy has dedicated his considerably long life to studying angels.  He’s written books on them, spent time with them.  Even rehabilitated a few…which sounds like a skill you may be particularly interested in. He’s,” here he paused to roll his eyes, “
specifically. But he quickly discarded the idea, Cas looked more frightened now than he had in the last week and Dean had been around him almost constantly since then.
“Hell no, I hate those bastards!”  Dean declared automatically.  He’d picked up on enough by now to know that they were still in an area that wasn’t fond of the governing establishment.
His words did little to ease the fearful glint in Castiel’s eyes and the angel backed towards the wall when Mike took a careful step closer.
“This is strange,” Cas said him absently, his gaze still sweeping the room. “This all feels familiar but...I can't quite grab the memory.” He worried his lip, like there was something huge lurking in the back of his mind that stubbornly remained cloaked in shadow.
But, as he had learned over the last several weeks, sometimes he had to clear out his mind, push everything away, just to get through the moment.  Once he was safe, then he could deal with the backlash.
, Castiel had once heard Dean say when the Impala wouldn't start one morning.  He thought this rather fit the moment, given he seemed to spend half his time trying to make things better and instead made them worse.  Perhaps he should just stop talking all together.
Silence followed and the trio strained their ears for any kind of alarm being raised but heard nothing.
A hand on his back made him jump and he spit out an Enochian curse word, feeling as if the milk might not be far behind it.  Sam’s hand stayed on his back, rubbing soothing circles between his shoulders and, after a few seconds, Castiel let himself relax.
Castiel’s knees buckled under him but Dean hauled him right back up again, Sam hooking an arm under the angel’s as well, the gun still held steady in his other hand.
Cas and Hannah both perked up, seemingly immediately on board with the idea, but Sam was frowning at him.
Cas had almost reached for his throat.  He wondered what was going through the angel’s head and wondered what he could possibly say to help make him feel safer.
than that.  You’re my friend.  You’re Sam’s friend.  He loves you and he’d be devastated if you died.  Didn’t you even notice how upset he was back at the bunker?”  Cas looked stunned and shook his head a little.  “He was almost in tears, man.  He thinks of you as a little brother, you know?  He loves explaining shit to you, like how to use the microwave and he spends way too much money buying you expensive teas to try.” Dean smiled with relief when that got the corner of Cas’ mouth to twitch.  “And Garth never shuts up about how awesome he thinks you are.  I’m pretty sure you could tell him about the inner circle politics of heaven and he’d be hanging off every word.  And Jessy and Cesar really respect you and like hanging out with you cause you don’t try to hug them all the time like Garth does and you tell them cool stories about all the wars you fought in.  Their words, not mine.”
“Kay, g’night!”  Sam whispered jovially.  He stood with a shit eating grin and fled the room before Dean could so much as hiss at him to
The strength behind these bindings was what he had fearfully imagined being caught in the grip of the Serpent's coils might feel like.  He hadn’t been able to shake his imagination as he fled.  Something primal conjuring the images to urge him to flee faster, even though it had barely shown a passing interest in his presence.
He braced his bloody hands against the floor as the wave of pain ebbed.  He didn’t want to look at them; didn’t want to see the pain in their eyes – or the fear.
There was coldness against his skin now, seeping into his blood like it had never left and he started shaking – couldn't stop. His legs ached where he was half crouched against the wall, trying to control the panic spiking through him like a dirty lance.
By the time he got back to where Sam and Doctor Owen were sitting in the waiting room, he had actually managed to calm down some – even if it was only because he’d compromised with himself.  If he wasn’t allowed to at least
He pulled some air through his nose, picking out the unique notes of both Sam and Dean’s scents right away.  Less noticeable was Liam’s, with a strong smell of wool and black tea.
Through the sound of the waterfall, birdsong trickled through and the gurgle of the stream draining away from the pool was calming enough for Dean to latch on to.
Dean grunted to let Jessy know he was listening, carefully stepping over a fern that had bent over the trail.  He scowled when he heard it smack against three legs behind him.
Castiel rubbed his chest with a grimace, cursing, for the first time, his angelic ability to heal at a ridiculous pace even without access to his grace.
.  The crisp air woke him instantly and he rubbed his hands together to keep the cold at bay as he glanced around the small camp for his brother, wondering if he’d managed to coax any more rations out of Aldis with his lethal puppy dog eyes.
“Good…that’s good.” Liam was pale in the red light and when he pushed his glasses back up his nose, his hand was trembling.  He was more shaken than he was letting on.  “Everything’s alright.”  He barely looked away from Castiel’s face long enough to give Sam a short nod. “Alright, let them go now, Sam, and let’s give them some space. Take a moment to get your bearings, Castiel.  You’re safe, you don’t need to rush.”
,” he replied, feeling one of his pieces try to drift away again, tugging at the delicate threads tying it to him.
“I think we should go to Helgen, after all,” Cas announced, once again changing their plans.  “My knowledge of this area isn't as good as I would like to lead us through the woods without a path.  I only had a look at the map on the inn keeper's table, sticking to the road may be best.”
Dean’s back was to Castiel and Sam spotted him at once over his brother’s shoulder, brown eyes shifting from narrowed and annoyed to wide and concerned.  It had Dean spinning at once, the anger melting off his face so quickly it was dizzying.
Sam was staring at the table, the fingers of his left hand curled against his mouth, looking as overwhelmed as Dean felt.
Cas had seemed impossibly, profoundly, grateful for the gesture and Dean desperately hoped it eased at least some of the anxiety he’d confessed to having about how out of place he felt in their lives.
He nearly choked on the terror the thought caused him and, for a moment he despaired. Ice expanded in his throat and he tried to figure out
Why hadn’t Cas called?  What was taking him so long?  Of course, he refused to contemplate any of the logical answers to those questions.  Instead he and Sam had spent all their time trying to track him down.  But there was no trace on his old cell phone.  No one at the gas station he’d called from remembered seeing him.  There were no weird news stories that might be explained by a confused fallen angel stumbling in to something he ought not to have stumbled in to.
Dean had helped him to his bed; he had wordlessly watched as Castiel curled his right wing around his shoulder and laid down on top of it, then folded his left over himself to create a soft, warm, comforting cocoon.
“What did you say?” Sam asked, a book open in his hands and an odd look on his face.  He seemed amused hearing the angel muttering so vehemently in his mother tongue.  There was probably no mistaking the intent behind them, even if he didn’t understand the words themselves.
Liam shook his head.  “All I can do is guess, but I have worked with enough humans raised in war zones to know that constant trauma can have a devastating impact on how we develop physically as well as mentally.  I’ll need more information from Castiel about their past and I’ll need to get a look at their true form before I can be sure, but I can say with some confidence that our dosage problem may be both a weight issue and an age issue.”
Castiel drew a sharp breath, tensing as much as his sedated muscles could manage.  “Dean…Dean she’s one of them – she has needles –”
Walking in to the welcoming warmth of the inn was enough to push the ache in Dean’s bones back just enough to get through the process of renting a room and buying some food.
He brought both blades together over his head just as the beast started to regain it’s senses and drove them down, driving them deep into it’s mangled face.
This couldn't be it. It just couldn't be. After everything Cas had beaten he was going to die on a bed with some wretched, poisonous spell leeching away his life force? Unacceptable.
The…guy?  He looked like a normal guy, other than the green skin and protruding lower jaw.  And the extra pointy teeth.  And he was more jacked than Arnold Schwarzenegger in his glory days.
The rumbling had stopped dead but before he could worry about what that meant, it returned just as quickly, even more urgent then before. The vibrations – the
They passed a general goods store and a smith and then passed under another wooden arch at the other end of the road out of Riverwood, shouldering past confused guards that shouted at them to watch where they were going
Despite the arguments and the opening of old wounds and the fact that he felt like he had flayed himself bare in front of Sam…Dean felt better.  Lighter than he would have thought possible.  Though he supposed that after spilling your guts like they had been for the last few days, you were bound to feel a bit lighter.
Sam quickly moved to the stove and took the pot off the burner.  Dean slowly took a few steps towards Castiel, his face carefully arranged into something overly
She gave an interlude to sing a wordless verse, her haunting voice filling the room and weaving around the patrons like a spell.
"I doubt they would try to instigate anything, Dean," Cas told him.  He’d removed his leather armor, but left the dagger in his boot.  "Even if they did..."
And wasn’t that the truth.  Dean remembered how he felt after he got out of Purgatory.  Remembered how it had taken his brain a while to realize his body had stopped running.
The universe, it seemed, was trying to make up for all the bullshit it had put Dean through in the last two days because they got all the way back to Cas’ room without seeing a single patient, nurse or security guard.
He felt neither threatened by them or safe around them and it left Castiel shifting uneasily, his gaze moving from one to the other, wondering why they were here with him; wondering how he'd ended up in a room that likely belonged to them.
Now here he was in the same place anyway, just twenty-four hours and one angel on suicide watch later.
"His hand moved!" Dean gasped, sitting down on the edge of the bed and clutching the angel's hand to his chest. "Cas!" he called again, hope melting the icy panic in his gut.
Through the screams in his head and the looming promise of torment rising up behind him like a hungry demon, Castiel felt to smallest pinprick of pain in his shoulder.
Sam had said it all in a rush, like their intentions were a secret, like Castiel could not read those wards and know their exact purpose and intent. Still, he wondered if they'd offer something a bit more satisfactory for
bad to have to spend a few days in Seattle while Sam caught up to them?  Cas liked coffee and wasn't Seattle supposed to have like, really good coffee or something?
“Sometimes, yes,” Cas was staring into the fire now, his face gone slack.  It appeared that even angels were not immune to the hypnotic effect of flames.  “I was only here once before, during the Oblivion Crisis – it is a
body.  He knew his eyes glowed an eerie blue, and the other day he’d looked down at his bare torso and saw dusty light drifting over his skin like sow drifting over a road.  To
He wrapped his arms around the angel’s shoulders, cupped the back of his head and crushed Cas against him with every ounce of the tension that had built inside him over the last five weeks.
“Dean, I don’t know much about humans but I really don’t think they’d like a shot gun in their hospital.”
It was a little creepy with no sound besides that of the crackling fire and the soft trickle of water in the rocky creek a few dozen feet away.  He'd been camping before; had slept outdoors before; had slept in the Impala more times than he could count.  But this was different. They had no food and no tents and most importantly, no weapons.  The rocks at his back were a small comfort – at least nothing could sneak up on them from behind – and he supposed the creek offered some small amount of warning if someone – or some
He wasn't so arrogant to think that a roll in the hay – or sand – would undo a very long lifetime of brainwashing.  He wanted Cas to know this was ok, that he was ok with it and Cas could be too.
But Sam had stopped too, staring quietly at Cas with a small frown on his face.  Dean was about to ask what was wrong but then the feathers all down the back of Cas' wings rose sharply and the tips drifted away from his body as they fanned out.
was beautiful, Dean felt himself thinking as he curled his arm around one of the deck posts and leaned against it.
Dean swallowed.  He’d never gotten the full story on what Naomi had done, but if it involved tying him down and using a drill – suddenly Dean recalled the way Cas had stared at him like an empty drone, Samandriel’s body at his feet and blood dripping from the corner of his eye.
So he took a deep breath.  “Hannah makes you happy,” he said, trying to keep his voice as casual as possible.  He still didn't phrase it as a question.
“You get any sleep, Cas?”  Dean asked, voice rough.  He felt like shit, which meant he had slept like the dead.  At least his legs were no longer aching.
Dean threw the plate into the dish rack, the bit of cheese still stuck to it, and picked up a mug with petrified coffee stuck in the bottom.
Silence swelled between them like a whale carcase on the beach.  Castiel wondered which of them was going to poke it first.  Probably Dean, he reasoned.  Dean was always the one going around poking delicate things and then getting angry when things got messy.
Dean felt very much like the task before them was going to be like trying to teach a fish how to breathe air.
“Frost mirriam and lavender,” Cas rumbled.  “The mirriam can be used in potions to fend off the cold and is said to warm the blood.”  He suddenly blinked and then got to his feet.  “I will be right back.”
The sky was still cloudless, the wind likely so strong that it blasted any clouds away before they could even form, and the stars were as sharp as the pins and needles stabbing at Dean’s skin.
He finally let his grace crackle along his veins and breathed with the release of it.  There was nothing here that he could damage.
The vague need to vomit rolled through his stomach, but he hadn’t eaten in days.  There was nothing for him to throw up.
As Dean went about setting up the fire pit and getting the fire started with Sam, we wondered how many times and over how many eons Cas might have walked over the sand of other beaches, all over the world.  Maybe even on different planets.  Had he stood on the fresh shores of a young earth where only vegetation grew on land and everything else was in the ocean?  Had he stared out over the sea wondering what might some day come out of it?  Would he have been able to feel the sand under his feet in his true form?  There wouldn't have been anything for him to take as a vessel then.  Did he even have feet?
“No, Cas –“ Dean bit his tongue when his voice shook.  He needed to calm down.  He needed to explain to Cas that it wasn’t normal to not care if you lived or died.  It wasn’t ok that he would so readily give his own life for nothing.
He searched for the words he wanted to say but they only came in the wrong languages and he sighed sharply with frustration, knowing the English ones were there, just buried under a rubble heap again. The sound of his irritation caught Dean's attention and his gaze focused.
Nightfall was approaching when Dean was the one to finally call it a day.  The mountains were finally behind them…but only just.  They loomed tall and menacing at their backs like a pursuing monster, casting long, reaching shadows across the ground.
easy.  His blade would cut through him like butter.  All he had to do was pull it forward into his chest and the blade would do the rest.
Cas looked heart-stoppingly small with Sam’s long arms wrapping clear around him.  But his arms lifted and squeezed back around Sam’s waist and Dean could just make out a gruff and fond, “Hello, Sam,” muffled by his brother’s chest.
“We've not found any wood yet, wet or dry,” he informed them, as if reporting the progress of a mission.
They went crashing to the floor in a tangle of limbs, knocking over a rickety table full of bloody instruments Dean chose not to look at. He struggled to get the upper hand, dodging a fist as it barreled towards his face and driving his knee into the demon's stomach. In the background of his awareness, Dean could hear the sound of Castiel struggling in the silent moments between his screams.
Dean's eyes traveled down, down, down to where the shirt was plastered against the small of Castiel's back, hugging the dip in his spine and accentuating the two ridges of muscle that lead down under the hem of his jeans.
The coffee maker gurgled to a stop, just close enough to the memory of Lucifer's blood-wet last words to make Dean's stomach heave, but he pushed it all back down, told himself to focus. He poured his own black and sugarless coffee and handed the pot off to Sam, heading back to the library with the intention of re-reading those few precious chapters on angels for the hundredth time, just in case he'd missed something.
They cowered before him.  Like humans were supposed to when an angel was threatening to annihilate them.
“There's always another way,” Dean felt compelled to say it, because how many times had they thought their number was up and they'd found a way around it?
The fact that Sam at least wasn’t gagging this time was of little comfort as Dean tipped the other half of the concoction down his throat, trying to bypass his tongue entirely with little success.
But then the Jarl seemed to relax, his shoulders shifting easily, and Cas mirrored the posture, wings relaxing a little as well.  It seemed as if whatever the man had been looking for, he’d found.
Dean and Sam both had a list of things they needed to work on.  They had kept it short, as the kind of changes they were trying to make were difficult.  Dean repeated them like a mantra in his head whenever he thought of them, just to make sure they would stick.
Tentatively, Cas raised his gaze from the ground to Liam and stared for a moment without blinking.  The grace in his eyes pulsed softly and then his wings and shoulders relaxed once more.
Cas stood in the middle of Dean’s room, gaze on the floor again like his line of sight was too heavy to hold aloft, and he barely moved at all while Dean carefully took off his coat and suit jacket and guided him over to the bed to sit down.  He pulled off Cas’ boots and looked up from where he was kneeling on the floor, his breath catching in his throat when he found Cas looking back at him, his blue eyes a fraction sharper.
“Then why am I conscious?!”  Dean hissed, finally getting a foot free of the sheets.  As long as he was up he was going to take a piss.
Luckily, Gilfre took pity on him and simply said, “If you find the time before you set off again, feel free to chop up some fire wood.  There is an axe and some whole logs down by the river.”
Crowley stared up at them, nonplused.  “Basically, you slapped a collar on him.  A collar lined with rusty nails because neither you nor these idiot Vikings knew what they were doing.  And while I’ve never
The feel of a hand over his had ice shooting into his throat and he jerked away even as he told himself it was just Dean and
"Cas!" he wrestled with the - thankfully weak - angel, prying the blade form his hand with Sam's help and then shoving Cas onto his back and literally sitting on his chest.
The only reason he could even see Cas' wings now was because he didn't have a choice in the matter.  How exposed must the angel be feeling?  Dean was sure he couldn't understand what that must be like.  And they looked fragile.  Long and sleek, probably great for manoeuvring quickly in the air…but how easily could they be injured?  Was having them out as dangerous as, say, a human walking around with their heart on the outside of their body?  Or was it more like walking around naked?
They were back on the other side of the river because Castiel turned to them.  “His mind is shattered.  I fixed what I could but...”  He trailed off when they stepped back into the street and passed a guard.  “I don’t understand how an entire town could just
The soles of his feet tingled unpleasantly, the bones in his legs felt bruised, and he couldn’t tell if the sharp pains all through his torso were coming from his starving stomach or the spot where that Orc had rammed him in the chest.
Dean was jittery with nerves himself, knowing just how fragile this moment was, even though at the same time he was brimming with quiet joy that Cas had grown to trust him enough to do this. He was trusting Dean to lead him through hallways that he barely remembered – if he remembered them at all, it was hard to tell.
Out in the library, Dean heard Sam’s chair scrape across the floor and sighed, knowing his little brother was coming to check on him.  Sam did that a lot now, came to check on him.  When he’d first started recovering from the trials it had been easy for Dean to turn over his worry for Cas and heap it on top of the worry for his brother.  But, as each day passed and Sam got better and stronger again, it was more difficult to hide it.
Across the bench seat, Hannah's had much the same look in her grey eyes and her smile had disappeared.
He looked back around, meeting the angel's eye, ready to shove all those feelings back down around his toes where they belonged. He was confused when he realized Cas looked a little pissed.
him; the rabid, frenzied fog had finally been gone from his gaze.  There had finally been a light at the end of Dean’s dark, shitty, tunnel and he’d blindly latched on to it, wanting
hurting.  I want to help you so bad but I don’t know how.  I want you to feel better.  I want you to care about yourself.  I want to see you smiling all the time and I want to be the one that makes you do it.”
He blinked at Liam, who smiled gently back at him, likely trying to get a read on what Castiel was feeling and likely not getting much.
Instead, he was trying to fight his own instincts.  Instincts his Father placed in him and every one of his siblings.  Blind worship, even when He did not deserve it.  A compulsion to follow orders, even when they were unjust.  And not only an aversion to free will but a near inability to even comprehend it.  But these were urges he had long since smothered.  At least he thought he had.  Why were they suddenly so strong?
Dean couldn’t believe he even had to say it out loud.  Was Cas that dense?  Did he really not see how terribly, horrifically fucked up his idea was?  When he glanced over at Sam for some kind of backup – some kind of reassurance that he was, in fact, very much in the right here – Sam had his gaze fixed firmly on Cas, eyes wide and sad, his expression suggesting he’d only just realised how far Castiel might have fallen for them.
“It’s…it’s a long story, just,” Dean growled, reining in his temper once more when he saw Sam shake his head from the corner of his eye. “Can you tell us anything about it?” He ground out as politely as he could manage.
Castiel blinked into the dark, wondering what had woken him.  The fuzzy memory of being comfortable and warm and
He tired to regain some ground, let his hands drift from where they had been playing at the base of Cas' powerful wings to tighten around his narrow hips, the pads of his thumbs rubbing over sharp hipbones.
When the two dirt tracks disappeared into long grass, Dean rolled to a stop and cut the engine.  The rain pattered away on the roof and outside the windows the grass and trees were deep green with water and the sky was heavy and dark with bloated clouds.  When he cracked his window to keep fog from forming inside the glass, the smell of damp earth and rain water wafted through the crack.
While Liam spoke to the attendant, Dean made sure his door was locked.  Cas had given them his consent to do whatever needed to be done of course, but that didn’t mean Dean wanted him to stumble in while he was baring the angel’s history to some stranger on the phone.
“I...” his eyes flickered, discarding Enochian words and replacing them with English ones. “I was worried they'd been...left behind.”
soul-reading' is going on the list under ‘no mind-reading’, ok?  I’m workin’ on…being more…honest.”  Dean grimaced, as if he’d had to pull every one of those words out with plyers.  “And yeah, I guess I’m hurting.  I
"He created birds after he created angels."  He shot Sam an amused look over his shoulder, his wing now curled around in front of him so that he could blindly reach up and drag his fingers through the scapulars.  "
“Well yeah, but I mean like when you're in the bunker with us.  It must get uncomfortable, having them stuck in another plane of existence.”
Together they helped Cas down the hallway and were making pretty good time until they came up to the elevator and none other than Doctor Owen herself stepped out in front of them.
But he told himself not to get overly excited. Cas might be letting him sit on the same bed, but Dean knew if he moved too fast or too suddenly Castiel would still flinch away, fear would still crowd his eyes and his beautiful wings would curl protectively around his shoulders.
A not uncomfortable silence settled over them, but Dean couldn't let it rest.  In the softness of the misty atmosphere around them, now felt like a fragile enough moment of peace to maybe find some peace of his own.
Probably for the best, since he’d just ripped out half the wall in a fit of rage.  Which now felt ridiculous given that Dean was alive and perfectly fine.
Cas reached a hand behind his back and dug his fingers into the base of his wing, right where Dean imagined they were joined to his body, and then fanned the left one out as best he could given the fact that he was stuck indoors.  He began combing his fingers methodically through his feathers, starting from the ones closest to his body – he had to reach under his arm to get them – and then working outward.  Every once in a while, he'd reach back to the base of his wing again before continuing.
“I really don't think you are, Cas,” Sam gently countered.  It was obvious he wasn't simply trying to contradict him, the concern shining in his carefully calm eyes was much too genuine for that.  “How many times has this happened?  It was more than just that one other time wasn't it?”
“What would you like?”  she asked.  “We have some Eidar cheese and salmon steaks.  Baked potatoes and marinated Hoarker loaf,” she rattled off the menu choices to them, mirroring Cas and leaning on the bar.
“But, they always seemed to work alone.  Angels, I mean.  Cas was never...”  but he stopped there, Hannah's words coming back to him.
The palm of Dean’s hand was warm against his face but Castiel barely noticed it, all his awareness focused inward.  He tried to pry his hands out of Sam’s grip – he could get through his vessel, he
“Cas,” Sam’s voice warbled, “You don’t have to get fat to stay warm.  Muscle mass can help keep you warm just as good.  Better, actually.”
While it screamed and writhed and clawed at the blade protruding from it’s face, Castiel plucked his other blade from the floor and raced forward.
Sam strolled into the room like he had every right to be there, stopping the pacer in his tracks with a friendly, “Hi!” before splitting his throat wide and cutting off whatever spell he'd been drawing up.
His wings were lifted, then he himself, and then the floor was gone, taking his point of contact with the world with it.  Head spinning, Castiel was once again unable to tell up from down.  Blood was wet and icy-cold on his skin, covering every inch of him.  And that wasn’t good.  He was still fighting to understand just when and where in the universe he was at the moment, but he at least knew that many wounds was
Dean's hand snapped out to steady Cas' wing, which he was holding still for the squirrel as best he could, and Sam shifted closer, his large hand on Cas' shoulder.  Under Dean’s hand, the powerful muscle trembled.
Cas looked down at the floor. “I'm sorry. I know -” his tongue darted out to wet his lips and he glanced over at the bed. “I know you won't hurt me, I just...” he trailed off with a sigh.
“Yes, of course I am.”  Castiel tried smoothing down the feather that was out of place, but the shaft was bent and it would not go back.  He plucked it out and tossed it on the table, scratching again to sooth the sting.  That was odd, usually his feathers only came out so easily when he was close to a molt.  He dearly hoped that wasn’t the case.  His wings had only just been restored, how could they be molting already?
She slipped the glasses off her face and sat back in the chair with an absent smile. Apparently the paper work wasn’t all
Identical looks of disappointment flashed across both their faces and the brothers shared one of those looks that meant they were having an entire conversation that would likely have gone right over his head even
Dean sputtered, feeling as if he was suddenly under fire.  “Don’t sit there and pretend every word you say isn’t a fucking heat seeking missile locked on to my cerebral cortex!”
It spoke again, it's mouth forming around the words, and he let his eyes fall from it's, watched the lips move and the tongue curl just behind them and tried remember the pattern of vibrations this time.
The hands pinning him tightened at his outburst.  He was going to rip those hands apart one bone at a time when he-
.  He sucked a lungful of sweet, precious, oxygen into his lungs so hard a few blades of grass came with it and he coughed.
Cas had confessed that being trapped in the bunker with hunters was making him nervous and Dean had immediately been outraged.  Until Cas had looked up at him with the same expression so many of his brothers and sisters had before Dean mercilessly killed them.  Without a thought.  Without feeling anything at all.  Because they were angels.  It wasn’t like he was killing a
“Castiel?” he called softly. They'd decided to use his real name for now, seeing as it had jogged his memory last time, and Dean watched carefully for even the smallest flicker of awareness.
,” Dean nearly snarled, making himself stay put instead of getting up to grab Cas by the front of his sensible suit jacket and shake some
"Got the dead man's blood?"  Dean asked, reaching to the back seat and grabbing his machete and holy water.
“Ok, lets do this!”  he exclaimed, before he lost his nerve.  Despite the fact that he was clothed, he felt naked.  Cas had forbidden them from bringing anything.  Even knives.  Apparently, even basic weaponry had a very different look where they were going and even though he understood and agreed with the reasoning, he didn't have to be happy about it.
“It's just me,” he started gently, still feeling weird identifying himself to the angel he'd know for nearly a decade, “It's Dean. I'm sitting in front of you in my bedroom in the Men of Letters bunker and you're right here with me. You're safe. You're home, with me, in the bunker, Castiel.”
He tried not to think about Cas.  Tried not to think about how scared he looked when he realised he was being tied down.  Tried not to think about how he was probably sedated and confused and unable to figure out what the fuck was happening to him.  Tried not to think about why they’d sedated him in the first place or worry about what he’d told Mike and if they thought the angel was crazy.
Mike was talking in to the radio on his shoulder.  Castiel struggled weakly in Calwell’s hold, having next to no leverage with his injured shoulder and the fact that he was face down and in what was probably excruciating pain.  Dean recalled how he couldn’t even lift his arm to shoulder height and now both of them had now been forced behind his back.
“Dean and I have already spoken a great deal, but much of what I need to know, only you can tell me,” Liam continued, the only one out of the four of them that looked completely at ease.  “I understand you’re under the thumb of a rather nasty binding spell at the moment and I imagine you’re feeling quite powerless. We can talk about that later, but for now, I want you to understand that every question I ask, I ask only because it is important.  I want to help you, Castiel, and I get the sense that you’re not used to people wanting to help you.”
Dean reached the fire before Castiel did, glancing down at the two pots of washed clams before sitting heavily on the tree trunk beside Sam.
Cas blinked and then gave such a tiny nod Dean almost missed it.  He didn’t say anything in return, the ever-present grace in his eyes glowing eerily in the dim light.  His face turned in to another breeze, chin tipping up and eyes fluttering, wings flexing and then resettling.
Before he could demand Sam tell him what angels had been trying to tell him – lies, most likely – Sam spoke first.
When he stopped beside the bed and held out the mug, Castiel's eyes flicked from his face to the mug and back again before he reached out and deftly plucked it from Dean's hand.
We offered what help we could to the prisoner and to Martin, holding back the armies of Oblivion long enough for Martin to use his father's amulet to transform himself into the avatar of the Great Dragon God of Time, Akatosh.  He slaughtered Dagon and banished his soul back to Oblivion.  He saved Cyrodiil, and possibly all of Tamriel, but sacrificed his own life to do so – which was the cost of borrowing the power of Akatosh.  The province was saved, but was left without an emperor to rule them.  As a result, military factions and separatists began to butt heads and groups eventually bled out into the surrounding territories.  When we finally left, whispers of a rebellion gathering in Skyrim had only just begun to circulate.”
face while Liam produced a metal tin from within his case and popped the top off, tipping it down so Cas could see there was, in fact, loose leaf tea and dried fruit inside.
She had them folded tightly against her back advancing on Castiel, who was now backing away with his wings arched behind him and spread to half their length, a look on his face that suggested he was just waiting for her to leap at him.
.  “Just because you find something easy doesn't mean everyone does,” he said, trying to keep the anger from his voice, because he didn't want this to turn into an argument.  “You think I never wondered about all that?  You think I didn't want to ask those questions, or that I was just too self absorbed to even think about it?”
Castiel sobbed, writhing on the floor just as his grace writhed inside him.  The longer he was bound, the tighter it seemed to crush him down and Castiel felt panic stabbing at his insides.  Why wouldn’t they release him?  His grace had been subdued, he wouldn’t be able to reach it for hours now, if not longer.
landing.”  Her eyebrows climbed a little higher as Castiel folded his arms over his chest and stared at her.  “Such flourish,” she cajoled.  “Such flare.”  Her eyes slid sideways to Dean, “Commanders have a reputation for being a bit...dramatic.”
Castiel's pupils were blown wide and his gaze didn't look focused at all, staring right through Dean with drug addled detachment.
He knew the venomous thoughts were out of line but could not seem to stop thinking them anyway and, with a concerning
“Why…are you pointing a gun at me?” he asked, as if it were important.  As if the answer mattered or impacted him at all.  “Where are Sam and Dean?” Ah.  That was better.
All in all, the angel made a formidable sight – intimidating enough to make the troll pause for a second before roaring and charging forward, half running half shuffling like a gorilla across the rocky ground.
with Cas.  But he refused to follow that train of thought, feeling guilty already.  Cas was happy with Hannah and everyone was safe and happy and healthy.  Dean told himself that that was more than enough; more than he ever thought he would have, and the realization buoyed his mood.
now ok, because I can't –” a sudden, messy ball of emotion clogged Dean's throat and he hastily wiped at his eyes with his free hand. “Because I can't do this without you,” he finished, voice like sandpaper. He twisted his lips in a mockery of a smile, tears slipping down his face despite his effort to stop them, and let the tips of his fingers push through Cas' hair again. “I know I have
That was Dean's prefered reward for keeping fresh coffee on all the time, because Cas' hair was ridiculously soft and it would tickle the side of his neck and it smelled like fresh air and rain water -
.  I stayed here and kept the fort while they went to High Hrothgar.”  He winced when Cas pressed the arrow tip harder into his “P-please, don't kill me.”
Dean shook head, trying to resettle all the new questions that popped up after every answer Cas gave him.  “There's more than one God?”
mention of it anywhere.  And there’s probably some obscure one’s I don’t even know exist.  Not to mention not all of them have been translated and I don’t know about you, but I’m not exactly an expert in ancient Norse languages so it’ll take time to translate them as well.”  Sam sighed, becoming more agitated with every listed obstacle they faced.  “We need to do something else.  There has to be something we can do for him
“I'm going first because you were a dick,” Sam primly informed Dean as he tossed the soap and cloths onto his bed and dumped half the pot of hot water into the basin by the wardrobe.
“I’m so tired,”  Cas whispered again, his voice shuddering from his chest, like he was confessing a sin.
It was impossible to care that he’d been drugged against his will at the moment.  If that was the reason he was able to talk through the pain, Castiel was grateful.  He would do anything at all if it would blunt his senses.
“It is tempting,” Cas growled, and Dean swore he saw a spark of grace flash in those blue eyes in the gloom.  “But unwise.  I do not know how powerful they are.”
“Hey, it's ok,” Sam told him, his voice as soft and careful as the dim light in the room. “You're safe here, Cas.”
“It’s obvious to anyone who knows what they’re looking for that this goes beyond civic duty and into something personal to
Undoubtedly true, Castiel told himself.  It seemed the three of them did little else these days but worry about things. And who
By the time he had his breathing back under control, Dean could feel the stickiness of dried tears on his face and he sighed shakily, unable to summon the energy to feel ashamed of it.  Tears came with panic attacks; he had no control over that.  And besides, here in his room, alone, there was no one to judge him.  Not that he thought Sam or Cas would judge him for crying but…old stereotypes die hard.
“Cas?!” Dean cried, both of them were looking around the war room like they expected to see the enemies responsible for Castiel’s injured shoulder.
Cas looked between them with a frown.  “I don’t intent to return to Riverwood once we leave.  Or Whiterun, for that matter.  We’ve gained what little information the Jarl had for us and we will take whatever information is in this village and then we will move on to Ivarstead.”
Rage blossomed through him like a poisonous flower, and he was overcome with the desire to annihilate whoever had
Castiel stood there, as still and permanent-looking as ever; like he was a marble statue that hadn't moved from that spot in years.  He looked mildly annoyed and took steady steps towards Dean.
The vampire launched himself at Dean, but Cas moved suddenly - merely stepped forward and stretched out his arm, catching the vamp at the neck and sending him to the ground.  Then he stepped back and looked to Dean expectantly.
Well, Dean thought as he used a handful of the dead man’s robes to wipe the blood off his sword, the bastard shouldn't have tried to electrocute his angel.
“What else can I do but praise Him and His mercy?  Forever.  For the rest of eternity.  For however long it takes for my Father to either kill me or give me orders on how I can
Glancing at Sam – he’d never told his brother about that particular conversation with Cas – he decided not to heap another weight on to his already drooping shoulders.  Not yet.  Dean was sure he was just over-reacting anyway.  That conversation had taken place so long ago and Cas had never mentioned it again.
Cas had every right to not want them to even touch his blade, and now he was being magically forced to allow it.  Being magically forced to lay down and let himself be filleted.  Dean could see it in his glowing eyes, the rawness of Cas’ gaze, the desire to attack, to
Cas and Hannah were literally as far apart as they could be in the back seat, each of them pressed up against the doors, faces nearly touching the windows.  Though Dean knew the distance between them meant nothing, remembered how close the two of them could get.  More than once he'd walked in on them in the same bed, or in a huge, fluffy nest of blankets and pillows in front of the fire in the sitting room.  Tangled up in each other, sound asleep.
He grinned and quickly reassured his brother, “They’re fine.  Great, Cesar said.  They, uh, they were wondering if they could stop by and visit for a few days.”
Silence from the other bed and something in the air seemed to shift between the brothers.  Something that had been teasing and light suddenly turned serious.
“Our presence was requested by the Greybeards.”  Castiel's voice rumbled through the empty hall – apparently, he wasn't going to waste time with pleasantries.  He strode between Irileth and the massive fire pit and stopped a few yards in front of the Jarl.  “They've asked us to help find someone.  Someone important.  My contact with them was brief but they told me to seek out the Jarl of Whiterun as my first point of contact.  It was implied you may have some information that can help us find this person.”
Dean jumped at the volume of Castiel's voice and the anguish he could hear within it.  A damn had burst and he braced himself for the onslaught.
Castiel grit his teeth and pushed the tweezers further under his skin, using it as an excuse to not have to look either brother in the eye.
“Ok, Falion.  Tell us why the Greybeards were killed and Cas here might repay you by not shooting an arrow through your brain.  Right Cas?”
They couldn’t see much, but there was an oppressiveness feeling in the air that made Dean quite sure that the clouds over their heads were getting lower and lower as the minutes ticked by.
“You're still in the Men of Letters bunker, in Kansas. You're home, Cas, and safe.” He spoke softly but firmly, hoping to words stuck in Cas' muddled head. “You're
it trying to burst through his skin.  He'd been worried about how it was raging inside him all this time, how could he possibly be worried about both?  In his panic, his mind hadn't made the connection.
This new torment was vivid, but veiled, like the echo of a sharp sound. The blackness of Hell that had been burrowing into him now felt like phantoms retracing their steps. Tentatively, he allowed his mind to gather itself from all the safe places he'd scattered it, cautious,
“The Bannered Mare!”  the same guard cried jovially, he slapped his thigh and chuckled.  “That’s right!  You'll find the best mead in all of Skyrim there.  Fresh from Honningbrew Meadery just across the river!  If you meet her, tell Ysolda that Jervar says hello, you might even get a free pint out of it,” he chuckled.
He remembered, years and years ago when he'd suddenly realized one day – after his own gaze had lingered a little too long on big, blue, curious eyes – that Castiel had managed to slip past his defences, and what was worse, he seemed to be totally unaware of it.
As the daze from being tossed through the ether like a rag-doll subsided, flashes of memories returned to Castiel in a nauseating smear: saying goodbye to Dean, promising to look after Sam, and then promptly letting himself get banished by a woman pointing a gun at Sam’s face.
effective.  To the point where it instantly crushed the first angel violently enough that it drove the poor thing mad and it burst – quite literally – from its vessel in an attempt to escape.  Then it, understandably, burned the eyes out of every person within a fifty-mile radius.”  He paused for another drink, smacking his lips appreciatively.
He turned to fix the fourth mug for Cas and found the angel already looking at him and it had been such a
Owen blinked.  The poor woman looked in danger of checking out completely, but she soldiered through the strangeness, apparently willing to go down swinging if it meant honoring her Hippocratic oath.
, he reminded himself – were so close together and coming so fast that they almost dissolved into an indistinguishable mess, but he assumed that might just mean this
"Keep your gold, Castiel.  I will tell you this story because I enjoy telling it and because I enjoy talking to you."
This wasn’t the direction Castiel had assumed the conversation would take, but he tried to answer the question all the same.  Thought back farther and farther to the last time he remembered managing to scavenge something to eat.  Alarmingly, all he could recall was an orange a small child had given him in the park.
But now, Cas still looked uncertain, his wings folding in a few inches absently before he startled, seeming to remember there was a potential threat lingering in the hallway, and snapped them back out.
“A shrink?  Hm.  I haven’t heard that term since the 90’s.”  Her keen brown eyes snapped this way and that behind her glasses, and Dean got the impression he was being read like a book.
the only one getting through Castiel's muddled thoughts.  He wished he could at least calm his breathing.  He was dragging air into his lungs too deep and too fast and it was making his heart race and his head spin.  Though at least with his back to the wall he could see that it was just the three of them there and Metatron's gut twisting giggles died away.
The grapes looked a little weird – a deep navy blue – but they were sweet and tasted good against the sharpness of the cheese.
The diner was large, sitting right on the edge of the road, with a green tin roof and cheap beige stucco siding.  Inside, there was the customary long bar and a few tables shoved under two big windows.
As they drew closer, it was obvious no one had come to rebuild or reclaim the ruined city and nothing but silence rose from within the walls.  Over the edges of the mangled fortifications, the wind howled, like a wolf warning them to stay away from its den.
Despite the fact that the temperature was steadily dropping, they gained no altitude.  In fact, the road sloped steadily downward, heading towards sea level.  By the time the sun was sinking down behind the mountain range later that day, a hundred or so kilometres to the east, the air was dry and the wind was sharp.
Hannah shifted, re-positioning her wings and scooting back a foot or two from the hole she had dug and started digging a new one.
The second he finished the last cut in his chest, connecting the first and last lines and completing the sigil, Castiel took a moment to consider his handy-work.  The cuts were deeper this time, and his true-form was shining brightly through them.
Cas visibly hesitated here, his gaze flicking down and away from the brothers.  “It is the village at the base of the mountain on which the monks live.  It's in the province of Skyrim, in the northern region of Tamriel.”
"Good morning, gentlemen!"  the man called, waving and smiling disarmingly, uncaring of the angel and his magnificent wings or Dean and his intimidating sword.
“I’m sorry, Castiel,” she spoke before anyone else could.  Sam’s head snapped around to look at her, as if she had just broken some agreement they had come to before entering the room.
"If you're basing that on those two cars, your reasoning is a bit flimsy," Castiel said, because of course he would have already noticed the cars, the jerk noticed everything first.  "There could be ten more cars on the other side of the building.  We have no way of knowing if there is a single vampire or fifty in there."
As if angry about the reminder of his predicament and the shame protruding from his back, his grace hissed and bucked, pushing against the bonds that only squeezed tighter in response, and Castiel doubled over, breathless.  He braced his left wing against the wall and his right against the floor, bringing both hands up to press against his sternum, trying to breathe.
He could have kept going, had at least a hundred more words to describe how great Cas was, but the angel was starting to look overwhelmed, like he couldn’t even process such blatant praise being directed at him, and Dean had to tell himself to calm the hell down.
He felt a bit like he had after he’d been banished by that woman.  Like he was disconnected or trapped under a heavy glass dome or…something.  It was a very different feeling from when he was actively cutting himself off from his emotions.
By the time the two of them had gotten the bags from the trunk and stumbled into the room, they were drenched.  Dean peeled off his leather jacket, thankful it had at least kept most of his torso dry, and glanced over at Cas.
He grabbed the shot gun barrel just as she fired a round that clipped his shoulde, ripped it from her grasp and tossed it to the other side of the room.
“As I said before.  This will be different from the other times you've flown with me,” Cas warned again,  “It will be disorientating and there may be a few moments where you feel like you cannot breathe but I assure you that there will be ample oxygen in your blood so...don't worry.”
“It's to keep things out,” Sam admitted after a glance at his brother. He pursed his lips, looked like he was bracing for something, and Castiel watched him curiously. “And to keep you in. We didn't want you to get hurt and...and wanted to be sure you couldn't hurt anyone either.”
When his fingers first wrapped around the cool handle, his grace spiked furiously, trying to complete the connection to his blade like a starving dog trying to reach a bone through the bars of its cage.  When the spell constrincted around him violently in response, It very nearly ripped a scream from him, but he bit his tongue hard, tasting blood, to keep the noise inside.
He rushed to Cas’ side, putting a hand on his back and wincing when he could feel the faint knobs of his spine through the sweater.
“Mm,” Cas hummed, then seemed to realize that wasn’t an answer.  “I think so.  I can think more clearly and I no longer feel like I was cut open and filled with sand.  I’m very thirsty, though.”  His eyebrows drew together.
When Sam came back out with a key in hand Dean held out his hand for Castiel to take, steadying him in his still bare feet.
The memory still sent a chill through Dean when he thought about it.  He’d spent hours googling things like ‘voices soundtrack’ and ‘background chatter’ and similar things and wondering if any of the things he found would help Cas at all or if it would be too close to what he knew he’d lost that it would just hurt him more.  In the end, Dean had gotten him a noise machine – the kind that played wave sounds and white noise and thunderstorms – which Cas still used every time he slept.  And he did sleep, every few days.  It seemed healthier than trying to replace something he could never get back.  Dean wanted him to move forward, not hang on to something in the past.
one of Hell's parasites trying to burrow in to him. He wondered how long it would take him to unlearn the decades of visceral reactions even as he tried to smother them now. But the fear and the shaking persisted, muscles making him shiver as if cold.
“So, what is a thirty something year old FBI agent – who looks like he hasn’t slept in days and has the attitude of a starving badger – doing taking up a table in the cafeteria of the biggest hospital in Seattle?”
It wasn't unusual, this behavior.  Every once in a while when Cas got injured with something more than a sprained ankle or bump on the head, his hackles would rise and he'd snap at anyone that got too close.  Like an injured animal backed into a corner; much as Dean wanted to touch and reassure himself that he was ok, sometimes it was best just to let the angel come down on his own and realize there was no danger left to bite at.
Jessy and Cesar both blinked at him with wide eyes and then nodded.  Jessy glanced over his shoulder to give Cesar a pointed look but no one said anything else.  The tense moment lifted and the four of them traipsed on in silence, absorbing the peacefulness of the forest, listening to the sounds of wildlife and wind high up in the trees.  Eventually they came around a bend in the trail and came parallel with the creek Dean had told them about.
Dean's concern shifted from potentially ruining Cas and Hannah's relationship to Cas himself.  He hadn't known Cas was struggling with something.  He'd seemed to happy, recently, so carefree and himself.
A moment later and Cas closed his eyes, relaxing further, tilting his head up and inhaling deeply as if trying to smell from what corner of the earth the gust of wind had originated.  Then, miraculously, most of the tension seemed to leave him all at once.  His shoulders and wings relaxed, the mask-like expression on his face vanished completely and when he opened his eyes, it was obvious he was present in a way he hadn’t been since handing his blade over to Sam.
Dealing with his own suppressed instincts was already frightening for him; throw in a sudden burst of involuntary thoughts and movements from his vessel and Dean was pretty sure they were on the verge of a serious setback.
Sadly, hatefully, pathetically, it had taken the devil himself to finally put all the pieces together for him.
“For now.”  He winced around the sting of re-healing.  “I’m sorry, I felt…in danger of losing control if I did not expend some energy.  My grace, it seemed to react to my…agitation and the more I failed to control myself the more agitated I became.”
It was ugly.  Something vile and evil that looked like it had slithered out of the darkest pits of Hell and it tickled all the instincts ingrained in Castiel that told him to
Dean chuckled out loud to himself, wondering just what the hell he was going to make for dinner.  He decided on burgers, because literally everyone like burgers.  And he still had that aged cheddar that Cas loved…
He thought he might know what was going on.  Hannah had told them she had been trying to get Cas to realized that angels
That had Dean sitting up again with a frown.  “Wait, if God didn't create Nirn then who did?  I thought he'd just kind of made everything.”
Sam sighed, glancing at Dean contemplatively.  “We could call Crowley?  See if he can help us figure it out.”
Dean's joints creaked and his bones ached when he shifted to lean more of his weight into the counter and he took a moment to recount the timeline of events just to prove to himself that he hadn't aged another forty years like it felt.
Dean had no idea how much time had passed by the time Cas finally came back, but it couldn't have been long.  He strode from the trees, wings relaxed now, and beckoned for them to follow.  He led them past the two horses – who didn't spare them a glance – and up a small hill where three sturdy tents materialized into view among the trees.
Dean punched his brother in the arm.  “You know what I mean!  That was…that was incredible, Sammy.  I just…” he sighed.  “Thank you.”
“Shh, it’s ok, Cas, it’s ok.  I’m here now and I won’t let them tie you down again, angel, I promise.”  He turned his body in to Cas, gingerly wrapped his arms around his bare shoulders.  Instead of flinching away like he expected, Castiel curled in to him, grabbing at his suit to pull him closer, face still buried against Dean’s neck.
“I’m not there,” he said, because on some level he was sure that was important information for Dean to know.
They pressed on.  Dean kept watching Sam’s back as they marched, watching for any signs that his brother was pushing himself too hard, the memory of Cas’ voice echoing ‘brain haemorrhage’ still fresh in his mind.
The same one he'd been stretching out in the warehouse, Dean noticed.  He placed a hand on Cas' chest, pushing firmly, "Ok, take it easy, Cas, just lay back.
"Windhelm is quite close," Cas told them, pointing to an elaborately drawn tower and city walls on the map.  It was directly north of Kynesgrove, settled in an inlet near a river that lead into a vast ocean that disappeared off the edge of the map.  "Maybe a day, day and a half, from here."
When he stepped into the hallway, he was looking up at the red backup lights in confusion and wondering why they were on, and so didn’t realise the floor was covered in glass until it was cutting icy gashes into the bottoms of his feet.
“Sorry,” he muttered into the edge of the heavy blanket, knowing the brothers likely found his checkered focus upsetting.
do, that he would devote the next forty-eight hours of his life to annoying the fuck out of Mike and Calwell.
He felt…blindsided.  Shocked.  Of all the problems Dean had expected to have to fight through, of all the states he thought Cas might be in when they finally got him home,
He realized that he had the back of his chair in a death grip, the other hand pressed to the sigil.  Feeling the tremor in his body now, Castiel pressed his forehead to the inside of his wing and took a few calming breaths.
The feathers all down the sides of Cas' wings lifted then, as well as the little ones along the leading edge, and this time Dean did smile.  The fluffing feathers, coupled with the way Cas' lips parted and his eyes got a little wide suddenly brought it into focus and Dean realized what the rising feathers meant.
“While the right paperwork would give the legal right to discharge this patient in to your custody I must insist that in my
"Brothers!  I have a brother, myself.  A few summers younger.  I tried to get him to join the rebellion but he wants no part of it.  Off in Kynesgrove farming cows."  The man shook his head with some fondness.  "But I am boring you.  Come, what do you need, tell me!  Food?  Beds?  Weapons?  How about you, young man?  You look as if you have taken a blow to the head."
Dean knew his brother was right but it was hard when Cas was so obviously afraid not to immediately do everything he could to remove the thing that was scaring him.  He also knew if he kept doing that then, like Sam had said, Cas would never get the chance to see there was nothing to be afraid
Castiel’s thoughts began to clear a little.  He was more certain that this was, in fact, the bunker and that it really was Sam, Dean and Liam here with him.  It wasn’t a trick.  It wasn’t an illusion.  He wasn’t in Hell or Naomi’s chair or dying on the battlefield.
they’d be able to order the angels to do the heavy lifting in battle.  Smite their enemies, burn villages with a blink, etc, etc.  And they
Dean gave his brother a look, admiring his ability to push through his hunger to do the job they were actually here for.  Although, Sam was used to eating rabbit food by choice.  Maybe he wasn’t as ravenous as Dean was.  He made himself eat slower, savouring each bite while trying his best to pay attention to the conversation.
On the other end of the line, Sam took a steadying breath.  “He’ll be fine, Dean.  We’ll figure this out.  What precinct are you at?”
“Where…where are you going?”  He sounded as distressed as the drugs would allow, his hand still hovering in the air and fingers still curled in a suit jacket that was no longer in front of him.
Dean looked over at his brother at the same time Sam looked at him and they both snapped their jaws shut.
When it was evident Dean did not plan on saying anything more on the subject, Sam spoke up from the back.
He pulled a map out of his bag, sitting down at the small table.  He didn't need to look at it to know the exact route they would take tomorrow, but he needed a distraction, his thoughts about Cas were getting out of hand and the last thing the angel needed right now - after everything he'd been through - was to find out his best friend was lusting after him.  For a moment he allowed himself to wonder if angels - if
Dean sighed, knowing Cas had likely already thought of a hundred different strategies on how best to approach the situation.  "Get there, find out where they're squatting, scope it out and then go from there.  If there's a ton of them we might actually
Cas rose and fell into his bed after their plan had been decided, quite obviously unused to the feeling of having eaten way too much.  This time, the brothers got to watch as the angel rolled onto his own wing, pulled his knees to his chest and nuzzle down into his feathers.  Cas curled his other wing over his shoulders, bringing the two leading edges together and hiding him from view.  Within seconds, his feathers rose and puffed out, making him look like a huge fluffy ball on the bed.
But his wings were tensing again, the tips drifting away from where they usually met in a point behind his calves.  And, Dean realised upon looking closer, he was no longer breathing.
Which Cas noticed for the first time when he followed Dean to the table to wait for the coffee to brew. He made a purely delighted noise and grabbed a mango out of the bowl as he sat cross legged in the chair across from Dean, his wings spread a little to either side of his body, relaxed and happy. He bit into the side of the mango, his full lips shiny with sweet juice when he pulled away.
He savagely ripped the sword from it’s face, imagining the shower of blood that would have followed if it had been real, and let his surging grace explode outward in a controlled shock wave.  The beast was knocked off it’s feet and all the weapons showcased on the walls rattled and shook; a few even came off their mounts and clattered to the floor.
Dean spun him around right there in the middle of the hall, settling both hands on Castiel’s shoulders and holding him in place.  When he stared at Castiel, Castiel thought Dean’s eyes looked a bit more dull than normal, the green faded from its usual vibrancy.  But when he moved all of his eyes around, he rather thought that could be said for everything around him.  Had the old lead paint on the walls always been so…grey looking?
When he heard the sound of Dean wading through the water, Cas looked up in bemused amusement, his mouth twisting like it wanted to smile when Dean cursed the chill of the water under his breath.
“You’re right.  You don’t ‘deal’ with humans.”  Finally, now that he had numbed himself somewhat, Castiel looked up and met Dean’s eyes.  The hunter looked ill, and was leaning heavily against the table.  “Not long ago I was as close to human as an angel can get.”
Dean watched him, sitting back on his bed and chewing on a piece of meat jerky from some animal he’d probably never heard of.  And probably didn’t want to.  But it wasn't until Cas started on the back side of his wing that Dean was able to see the way his feathers shined after he'd combed through them.
“We thought we could make it to Kynesgrove by nightfall,” Castiel lied easily, softening his usual grumble, but she seemed unbothered by their presence. “But we did not consider the weather might stop us.”
Dean had nearly fallen out of his chair in his haste to reassure Cas that didn't need to do anything he didn't want to. Certainly he should not hide his beautiful wings.
To his disappointment, Cas seemed to have lost his appetite for red meat. Though, through trial and error, he and Sam had figured out that the angel liked fruit – the sweeter the better – and simple things like eggs and bread with lots of seeds in it and non-root vegetables like yellow beans and cauliflower and sweet peas.
Maybe he could fix it, he told himself.  Maybe he could take Hannah aside and tell her that he'd just had a moment of weakness.  He could come clean and tell her a little about how he felt about Cas, tell her he had it under control now.  Maybe she wouldn't hate him too much.  Maybe she wouldn't get angry at Cas if he told her it had all been Dean.  He certainly knew he should
Trying to explain how to use the washing machine had been a half day adventure.  Cas didn’t need to know, of course, he’d just been curious.
He took a deep breath, trying to settle the clashing feeling of worry over what Cas was likely enduring at that very moment and relief at finally being able to go get him.  His hands shook even as they sped closer to the angel, thinking of how alone he must feel; how confused he must be with sedatives coursing through him.  Cas had only been drunk once in his life and he'd been a fully powered angel then.  Cas had never been under the influence of anything heavier than Tylenol or a couple beers.  Now, he was not only trying to navigate the likely terrifying situation of having his mind and body forcibly altered, but at the same time was reliving everything that had happened to him under Metatron’s hand.
A wave of self-loathing threatened to topple him and he lifted his blade again, letting the anger drive him.  This was ridiculous.
“Um…not very long, I think, I don’t know.  Her daughter…umm,” Cas’ face scrunched up in a way that would have been adorable if the situation wasn’t so serious.  “Katie.  Her daughter Katie asked me to tell her..." he inhaled deeply and sighed out the rest of the sentence as if it had taken great energy to speak at all, "...to tell her that she was proud of her mother.”
Knowing that Cas appreciated directness, Dean decided to try his hand at being just as blunt as the angel.  His gut squirmed with the decision but he asked himself what was the worst thing that could happen?  In this, he
The world outside the bunker was overcast and a steady pattering of rain tapped along the roof of the car as they drove.
He staggered back, expecting to hit the wall and was surprised when Dean was suddenly all around him, holding him up, prying the blade from his hand and passing it off to Sam, guiding him out of the weapons room with gentle words and gentler hands.  Always so gentle these days, Castiel thought dazedly.  Dean was trying so hard to soften his edges.
but he couldn't see Cas himself.  It looked like he’d used one wing like a mattress and curled up on top of the soft feathers, and then was using the other like a blanket, cocooning himself in a feathery wing pod.  Most shocking of all, were his feathers, which were all fluffed up like Dean had seen birds do when they dozed or when it was especially cold out.  With every breath Cas took, his wings moved up and down slightly.
Silence for a split second and then more nonsensical gibberish.  For a few long seconds he listened, tried to remember if the sounds matched anything he could remember. He tried again.
But Sam threw his weight on to each of Castiel’s wrists and, with his power and his body bound as they were, he could not hope to overpower the man.
show him.  But any lead was worth following at this point, even if he did feel ridiculous.  Honestly, they could have at least picked some frames that were a little more low-key than these.  He looked like one of those hipsters he saw in coffee shops.
The only thing he could figure was that Dean was a hunter.  But that had never bothered Cas before.  At least, Dean thought it hadn't...until he'd seen how at ease Castiel could be when he had one of his kin close by.  Almost like he could allow his guard down now that there was another angel to have his back.  Like he thought Sam or Dean would ever hurt him.  Like he was wary of them.  Like he was scared of them and Dean just hadn't been aware of it until he saw Cas let his guard down for the first time.
Glancing sideways he caught Cas' eye, delighting in the way his grace flashed blue behind them for a second.
"CAS!" he yelled, still hovering over the prone figure, still gripping his shoulders so tight his nails broke through Cas' skin. "WAKE THE FUCK UP!
It would be like being born forty and expected to just know how the world worked, with no time to learn and no one to show you.
“Hey!”  the drunk hollered, staggering into the wall.  “Come back here, ya great pigeon, so I can teach ya a lesson in manners!”
Angels were different from humans in a lot of ways and Dean had just assumed that meant they were different in
Sam was suddenly next to him, hauling Dean’s chair away from the table – with him still in it – like he weighed nothing.  Ignoring his squawk of protest, Sam grabbed his shoulder and shoved, forcing Dean to fold over his knees while he gasped for air.
Sam continued, “How did the captive angels use their grace to take out opposing armies, though? Cas nearly tore through his own chest with his bare hands because he can’t touch it or reach it or…however it is that angels use their grace.  It
With a groan, Dean let his head fall back against the seat.  "So we'll just sit here then and hope one of those nasty blood suckers drops by.  Just how I wanted to spend my night."
There was a steep hill in front of them, giving nothing away about what the blank space in the map might contain, and there was very little foliage on the ground.  As a result, the landscape looked barren and dry.  Exposed earth and the occasional gnarled bush or clump of bright yellow flowers were about it.
want to tell them about whatever job he'd been given.  He wasn't sure what that meant but before he could say anything, Cas turned away from them.
"Her name was Ardaline,” Castiel answered softly, his hands stilling for just a moment before grabbing the wooden bowl he'd found on one of the book shelves and placing a handful of nightshade blossoms in it.  He grabbed the pestle and began crushing the flowers.  "She traveled with us for several months, though I was the only one that showed any interest in her craft.  I was fascinated by her knowledge.  She seemed to know every plant in Cyrodil and what it could do for her, so she taught me.  Initially my brothers and sisters scoffed at my interest but Ardaline's skills ended up saving a few of them.  By the time they had come to appreciate what she had done for us, she was dead."
“It's unlikely an old military fort will have more than one entrance that is accessible from the outside.”
“Cas!”  Dean let his sword fall to the ground in favor of using both hands to help steady the angel as he swayed, breathing hard with his eyes tightly closed and his bow abandoned on the floor at his feet.
Dean swallowed again, his mouth dry.  "I'm gonna..."  he gestured towards the bathroom, nearly tripping over his own feet when Cas looked over his shoulder, blue eyes piercing against the flush in his dark skin from the hot shower.  "...ok.."
After a moment of deliberation, Cas finally closed the distance between he and Liam just enough to be able to reach out and grab the tin; then hesitantly, he brought it just under his nose.
Time passed is a hazy, sluggish crawl, but he was at least aware of it passing now and as it ticked by in unmeasurable clumps of lucidity and misplaced memories, Castiel started to remember things. Usually they came in ragged chunks, rising up from nowhere and cramming themselves back inside his head without warning. Other times it seemed as if all he'd done is turn his head the wrong way and something would slide softly back into place – though not always the
Dean grinned and clapped him on the shoulder.  “Oh no, no, it's on me, buddy.  A whole pint...if you answer some questions,” he added.
He shook himself.  “He’s complaining about how loud the prayers are in a hospital, talking about flying away?!  Come on, you’re a doctor, diagnose the situation!”
“They call it the Throat of the World,” Cas continued, as if sensing Dean hesitance.  “Seven thousand steps to the top, they say.”  He smirked.  “Luckily, I won’t be needing them.”
He tossed his phone to Dean, who caught it reflexively.  He  stared down at a picture of what must be the Sombrero Galaxy; a flat disk-like formation of millions of stars with a big, bright, glowing centre.  It looked massive and formidable against the backdrop of black space behind it and Dean realized that soon he'd be standing on the surface of a planet that was currently floating somewhere in that cloud of stars.
“Anger is an appropriate response to having your autonomy stripped away while being held down and assaulted,” Liam stated bluntly.  “You are
Cas had dunked his head and wings under the water, coming back up and shaking his head, scattering water everywhere.  His wings were water logged and looked like they probably weighed a ton but he held them the same way he always did from what the brothers could see above the water level, as if they weighed nothing at all.
is this thing?”  he said, itching to swing it at something but resisting when he saw the guards by the city gates staring at him in disapproval.
many casualties.  They smashed their way through a few battles with their feathered hammer and after that there was only the rumor of one more attempt to tweak the spell.  As far as I know, they more or less left it at the version you have here.  So tell me, is your pet angel being even more obedient the usual?”
Drops of water trickled through Sam’s beard and hair and then scattered every time he turned his head to peer into another foggy shadow.
Rolling his eyes with a genuine surge of both affection and irritation, Castiel didn’t bother commenting on the pointlessness of Dean’s embarrassment, the man never took it well.  Castiel quickly changed his pants, feeling the fresh wound pull at his skin.  The smears of blood that he’d missed with the towel had dried, making his skin feel tacky.
Did Cas not trust him?  Though looking back on it Dean supposed he had plenty of reasons not to.  Most recent being the whole disaster with Metatron stealing Cas' grace and Dean kicking him out of the bunker.
Twenty minutes into it and Dean sat back on his heals, wondering if he should get them to help him and Sam go find more clams because then at least they'd stop their bickering.  Though it did not appear to be escalating the same way Sam and Dean's bickering usually escalated.  It kind of sounded like two lawyers yammering on in the background, throwing around big words to defend their cases against just who had won the wood gathering challenge.
Cas was wearing a tunic also, but the sleeves on his were longer and went all the way down to his wrists.  It was a dark blue that Dean refused to admit matched his eyes perfectly and was cinched around his hips with a dark leather belt just like Dean’s.  It had a wide, open neck that the angel had laced up much more loosely than Dean had his own, leaving a sliver of tanned skin visible to just below his sternum.  His pants were a darker brown, almost as dark as his boots, which had straps around them just like Sam and Dean's.
There was a single tea pot in the entire bunker and Dean pulled it from the back of one of the cupboards, dusting it off as surreptitiously as possible.  While they had been drinking a lot more tea lately, they usually just made it one cup at a time, something he thought Liam may quietly judge them for, and he felt like he had already disappointed the man enough.  With the strong grandfather professor vibes, Dean felt strangely compelled to not let him down by letting him see their dusty, unloved, tea pot.
– and the one task he’d asked of him, Castiel had already failed.  It hadn’t even been a full twenty-four hours.  Had it even been ten?  Five?  He had no way of knowing, could not recall when he had said goodbye to the man he had pulled from Hell so few years ago.
“I thought about all that and knew it was all my fault that you wouldn't get to do any of it, that you were down there suffering because of the shitstorm
days yet, just better ones – it's just Cas staring back at him. Other times there's a wild, feral looking sheen in his blue eyes that makes him look like a trapped and cornered animal. Other times, on the very, very
Sam stood, obviously relieved that they had a direction to start walking in. “Just tell us what we need to do.”
Dean reached over and tucked the blanket back in from where it had shifted, and leaned back in the chair to finish reading aloud.
He was no longer a warrior, he was a wounded soldier that had managed to escape a dictatorship – though not without leaving some important pieces of himself behind.
He still needed to sleep and sometimes his stomach growled at him – though Dean seemed to be on a mission to feed him whether he was hungry or not, so it wasn't often his stomach went empty anymore.
“Jesus, this is insane!” he had to raise his voice to be heard over the howl of the wind, working hard to move his frozen jaw around the words.  He wiggled his fingers where he’d jammed them into his armpits and felt nothing.  “I think now would be a good time for that potion you mentioned, Cas!”
Something cleared in the Jarl's expression, looking as if he suddenly understood everything.  He stood, his thick fur-lined robes bulky and heavy looking as he moved.  Dean wondered how he wasn’t baking under all the layers.  It wasn’t
Not the kind of fun he assumed Cas was talking about, though Dean should have seen that coming, since he knew Cas was still a virgin.  Though he supposed that didn't mean the two of them hadn't been romantically involved anyway.  You didn't need to have sex to love someone.
Gingerly, he lifted his arm and carefully felt around his head.  There was blood, a lot of it, mating his hair and coating his hand, but he didn’t feel anything protruding from his skull.
Every day Dean thought about telling Cas all the ways he made him happy and every day he convinced himself that now was not the time.  It never was.  But especially not now.  Cas was still in a delicate frame of mind and Dean worried – obsessively – if telling the angel how he
Cas beat his wings one last time and then folded them loosely, finally coming down the steps and breezing between the brothers as if he hadn’t just brough half a city to a standstill by having a good stretch.
“I called a friend of mine, he’s a nurse, and he told us how to help you recondition your body to handle food again,” Sam finished.  “He said you’re dehydrated right now and your body doesn’t have enough nutrients to keep you going, so it’s actually breaking down any stores of fat.  Once it runs out of that, it will start breaking down and consuming the muscle and other tissues.”
“I can see it,” Dean continued.  “It's definitely still there, buddy, 'cause your eyes are glowin' like 60 watt bulbs right now.”
worry about a rogue fallen angel possibly leading an entire host of powerful beings right to their doorstep?  Still, it was nice to know at least someone had been thinking none-murderous thoughts about him.
He watched the coffee drip into the pot, steam curling up the front of the cupboards, as he thought about how far they had come and how far they had yet to go.
The grid-lock in Dean’s brain finally released and he had to make a real effort not to charge forward like a bull.
Cas peered around the edge of the wall and into the library and Dean knew the exact moment he remembered.
Cas nodded, raising the cup and inhaling the steam rising off the top.  He closed his eyes, shoulders relaxing, and then took a sip.
“Thank you for telling me that; I know it was difficult, but I need you to answer one last question for me.” Liam worried his bottom lip it in the first sign of uncertainty he’d shown since arriving.  “Can you tell me about your grace?  Do you have any injuries there, besides the binding?”
“They are essentially large cats but I would advise against calling them that lest you find your eyes being clawed out.”
Beside him, a small lake was gathering in a dip in the time-ravaged parking lot.  The water continued to rush out of the wall as if there was an unlimited supply of it.
He pulled his face into a scowl – or tried to at least – but Castiel chose that moment to sleepily snuggle closer and Dean had to squeeze his eyes shut, lest they start jutting from his face in the shape of cartoon hearts.
Sam merely rolled his eyes and left the room in nothing but his cotton pants, muttering about finding some hot water.
It was hard to tell, just what was going on inside Cas' head and Dean could almost pretend Cas was all there when he looked at him. There was recognition is those blue eyes but there was something missing too. Some of the warmth, some of the comfortable familiarity that had been there before. Dean only knew it used to be there because now it wasn't. One of those pieces Cas said he couldn't get back, maybe.
Dean was talking to him again and he tried to focus, finally giving in to the urge to make sure the wound in his neck had left with the ghost of the scribe's memory.  He didn't care that Sam and Dean's eyes both tracked the movement when he trailed his fingertips over his neck.
Feeling so stupid, but less so when Sam’s expression said he felt the same, Dean suddenly realised that if he had a heart attack, he certainly wouldn’t be able to tell Sam what they needed to do to fix it.  They’d go to a friggin’ doctor.  Why would they think it would be any different with Cas?  Why would he think that every angel knew exactly how their bodies worked down to an atomic level?
The inability to take action was a caustic toxin under his skin; eroding his sanity.  He felt like he was trapped in a cage while he knew one of his family was on the outside, in danger, but he just couldn’t get to them.
“Uh...second question,” Sam continued, unnerved.  To be fair, it was Dean who was used to being on the end of that stare.  “You said they contacted you specifically...but you've never met them?”
Because it had been shattered; had, at one point, crumbled to dust, and both Dean and Sam had spent the last few months building that trust up again.  It was hard, knowing it might never be as sturdy as it once was.  But they would try.
Hannah was chewing thoughtfully on her second clam, her eyes scrunched in thought.  Cas was smushing a piece of potato between his thumb and index finger with a curious expression on his face.  Hannah still had one wing resting over Cas' shoulders like she'd forgotten it was there, and the two of them had a flimsy paper plate balanced on their knee.
.  And utterly, utterly, helpless, once again feeling as if this task was just too massive for them to take on.  He felt like an ant at the base of Mount Everest, staring up and trying to figure out how to reach the summit.
“Trolls are annoyingly strong,” Cas told him, one corner of his mouth turning down.  “It is likely that an arrow to it's face will only anger it.  But it will certainly be a distraction.  It will be safer and faster for us to sneak by him.  Come, follow me.”
“As soon as the sigil weakens, the bonds…they don’t just reappear, it’s like they’re trying harder each time to crush me.  It feels…angry.” Castiel swallowed, unable to come up with a suitable word to describe the terror and pain of this particular spell.  “I’ve been bound before but…not like this.  Nothing has
Number one?  Be kind.  So simple, in theory, when your whole life didn’t revolve around protecting yourself and those you love from evil.  Dean had laughed when Sam had made that the first thing on their list.  But he hadn’t been laughing when literally an hour later he was biting his tongue to keep from snapping something nasty at Cas as the angel struggled to stay standing, his wings quivering behind him with exhaustion.
It was only a few seconds later that Sam took his hands away, laughing so hard himself that he leaned back against the arm rest with his arms wrapped around his stomach and Castiel went limp in Dean’s arms, breathing hard and grinning up at the hunter.
“It was made centuries ago by the Dwemer.  Hard to find these days, especially one in good shape like this.  We cleaned it up and sharpened the edges a bit more and I had Aldis wrap the handle in new leather.  It’s good as new!”
So shocked was he by the stupidity of the question, Dean actually had to sit up to stare at his brother.
Dean opened his mouth, having some very immediate issues with that promise because Cas was beyond vulnerable right now.  He absolutely could
He was – he scowled – too emotional to logically evaluate the conversation and how he felt about it’s revelations.  He needed to rest before he did anything else.
Dean was so relieved to see something besides that creepy blank expression on his face he nearly fell down the stairs, the need to somehow encourage the angel to start being curious about stuff again was so intense it was almost painful.
me sufficiently deep for a sigil to work properly, if you are unable to watch, then turn your back.”
With his fingers still tilting Cas' chin up, it was easy for his thumb to swipe across his full lips before he realized what he was doing.  Castiel’s eyes fluttered.
Castiel had brought his wings back in a bit, and kept them half folded and arched, stepping back onto the road.
Sam was sitting cross-legged on the ground, talking and laughing along with all three soldiers and Thorygg by the fire.
Dean yelled and made a show of turning his head away from the spray, but the grin on his face likely betrayed him.  But how could he not smile?  Cas was smiling and his wings were all fluffy and he was making god damn rainbows.
When Castiel woke next, it was – thankfully – nowhere near as volatile an affair as last time. Dean had just yanked himself back from the edge of sleep for the third time with a crick in his neck and blinked down to see Castiel peering up at him from under the edge of his blanket.
told Cas not to do that.  He hadn’t thought it was anything important, he’d just thought it was something angels could do, like,
It was a great comfort.  One he never thought he’d have again and one he did not deserve now.  But it was now, more than ever, that he needed it.
Cas had come so fucking far.  He’d practically risen out of his own ashes – damaged, burned, bleeding – and had gotten to where he is now against all odds.  For weeks after they had finally,
“Cas, it's ok.”  Across the room now, Dean tried to reassure him even as he carefully wiped the look of shock off his face.  “It's ok, buddy, just – you gotta calm down, man.”
Sam backed off, muttering apologies that seemed less sincere with all the questions still shining in his eyes, which Cas uncharacteristically picked up on.
The fog was still thick, swallowing up Cas and Hannah as they walked over the sand and back towards the beach, fading from sight like a mirage.
With shaking legs, they pressed on and the rest of their trip was, thankfully, bear free.  As they came out of the foothills and into more even ground, the birch grove continued with them, seemingly endless.  If it weren’t for that impossibly massive mountain that was always to their left, rising high over the tops of the trees, it might have been easy to get lost.
Dean was staring and it was probably creepy and his eyes were starting to burn a little but Cas hadn't moved in days and Dean was starting to feel like he couldn't breathe.
It took him longer than it should have, to notice the trails in the dirty floor leading off to a side room, and Dean scrambled forward, grabbing his machete off the floor while rage bubbled in his veins.  Buffy would look like a fucking armature once Dean was done with whichever vampires thought they could take Cas away from him.
In the dark, he looked like a stranger.  When he glanced over his shoulder to make sure the brothers were still close, the angles in his already sharp features looked that much more dangerous in a sudden flash of lightning.
Cas gave him a curious look.  “How else would you get from one planet to another without moving through space?”
Both of which he nearly dropped when he spotted Cas, standing at the foot of the bed with inky black wings spilling out his shoulders.
It charged at him again with a roar before it looked even close to prepared and Castiel instinctively rolled out of the way; heard its long claws digging into the floor and carving out grooves in the cement as it caught itself and turned to lunge again.
It had been almost as alarming as when Famine had control over him, and the intensity of his desire to devour the food before him had been eerily reminiscent of it.  He didn’t like feeling that out of control.  He
“Cas, what’s going on in that big brain of yours?”  Dean chuckled, but it was a weak, nervous little thing.
Cas vaulted over to the other side of the river like he had at Narfi's house in Ivarstead, walking along the other bank until Sam and Dean found a spot to hop across.
The short conversation was doing nothing to help ease the disconnected and misaligned feeling Castiel was struggling to understand.  He felt like he was missing whole chunks of understanding; even though he frequently had a hard time reading between the lines that Dean spoke, this was something altogether different.
Dean had marveled at that luck as well.  What were the odds that the alien people on another planet, in another galaxy, spoke the same language they did?
angel.  He had let himself slip, had let himself get swept out into the sea of emotions that came with falling.  He had thought it was a good thing, feeling all these things, being more human.  But why did he want to be like these humans so badly anyway?  It wasn’t who he was.  It wasn’t
The guy couldn't be older than twenty or so and Dean could see him shaking there on the bed, the black robes they all wore visibly vibrating over the guy’s malnourished frame.
Up ahead, the road curved sharply out of sight with a sudden bend in the river.  On their right, the heavily abused road and the erosion from the flooding season had carved out an over-hanging dirt wall, leaving them staring at the roots of trees coming out of the dirt at eye level, and boxing them in against the river.
Dean swung his legs over the edge of his bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and then squinting at the blazing sliver of morning sunshine cutting between the curtains across the room.
Given how desperate he was to move on, Dean gave a short nod and turned on his heel, heading for the sitting room.  Talking was great, and Liam was shockingly good at his job – he’d already learned more about Cas and himself in the last few hours than he had in the last ten years - but it had been a very,
He was getting better, he was sure, at reading the angel's microscopic tells.  Unfortunately, where it concerned making Cas feel better, Dean was still at a loss of what to do.
Dean nodded, sure he understood. It sounded like if Cas was going to remember something, the thread was already there, in the back of his mind, for him to pull at. But some things were gone entirely. That was perfectly fine with him. He could re-teach Cas all the stuff he'd forgotten since meeting them and looked forward to doing so. He was just weak with relief that he and Sam happened to be two of the things Cas could remember.
He sat across from Sam at their designated research table and Dean shook away the memory of sitting across from Cas on a shitty motel bed.  He needed to focus.  They had a lot to discuss before they talked to Cas and they weren’t going to wake him just yet.  If he was unconscious, at least he wasn’t in pain.
“Yeah, right,” Sam snorted, stretching his arms over his head.  “I have a few more questions for him anyway.”
It was a sad thing to realize, just how far removed Castiel's experiences were compared to Dean's.  He suddenly felt incredibly ill equipped to help the angel, wondered if an entire fleet of psychologists would even be able to reverse three hundred fucking million years of brain washing like that.
Liam was hovering like a worried grandma, a frown etched into the deep lines in his face.  “I don’t understand, that shouldn’t have been enough to knock him out like this,” he told them.
He just needed to blow off some steam, that was all.  He just needed to exhaust his body and maybe his grace, just a bit, so that he was too tired to worry about phantoms and echoes looming in the corners of his mind.
“We were wondering about the rumors as well,” Sam told him.  “That's why we came to Skyrim.  We wanted to talk to her.  Find out if she could use some help fighting the dragons.  But when we passed through Whiterun we were told nobody had even seen her in months.”
The fire in the bowl and the gentle light in the windows of the inn were the only life they could see in the city.  At the very least, inside the protection of the high walls, the wind was not nearly as harsh, but it still made the fire whip and twist in the large bowl and had the wooden sign swinging back and forth on it’s rusty hooks.
,” Sam started with a hint of distaste, impatience and overall arrogance that was so spot on for the high priced lawyer he looked like that Dean nearly asked him to take a bow.  “We’re both busy people so let’s try and work towards efficiency here.  My client has been arrested without a warrant which means you’ll need to let him go in another twelve hours anyway unless you get Castiel to press charges.  Which you wont.  On top of that you had Castiel restrained, sedated and taken to hospital against his will on the grounds that he is mentally unstable, which means even if you
