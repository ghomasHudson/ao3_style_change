Dean laughed against his shoulder and Cas held onto him a little tighter.
So he began by getting closer to Dean, physically closer, more affectionate. He would lean to let their elbows touch while they read over Men of Letters entries and even hook his chin over Dean’s shoulder when Dean held up something for him to read. He started hugging him in the morning to say hello, which Dean seemed to catch onto fairly quickly.
So he built them a house. They had decided to move to Washington state, far away from the bad blood of the past the Winchesters left in the south, nothing that far north held any bad memories. Sam helped them swindle their way into purchasing a plot of land outside a small town and near the ocean. Cas got to work immediately, laboring for seven months, as God had labored seven days. He had built something with his own hands, made sure it had a solid foundation and walls that would never cave. He made it in Dean’s holy image, laid love down with every brick and felt the tension in his neck and in his tightly wound shoulders as evidence of his good work. He knew each floorboard and door frame, crafted each room with reverent hands. This place would be safe and it would be warm, and above anything else it would be his and it would be Dean’s.
So Dean had taken him home, as he always had. There were no more angels, no more demons, only shadows and echoes and the creeping creatures that Sam and Dean used to hunt when they were young.
It was a portable cassette player. He knew this because he had seen Dean using one himself. He had a modern phone with music on it, but Dean was a sentimental creature. He liked old things, and he had passed one of these things onto Cas. But it wasn’t Dean’s cassette player, it was shinier and even more vintage. It was black and creamy yellow with a cassette already inside, its brown tape glinting back the warm lamplight of Dean’s bedroom. Cas smiled. Dean had given him “mix tapes” before, but he hadn’t had anyplace besides the car to listen to them. The thought of hearing what Dean wanted to share with him in private gave him a thrill and some other feeling that settled comfortably in his stomach.
“Dean?” Cas asked quietly and then let out a wet chuckle as Nights in White Satin began playing over the cassette headphones.
Yes I love you
It was winter, which meant early mornings bathed in silver light, the sun shining distantly like the center of a pearly oister winking from behind a thin veil of white cloud.
-- I’ve looked around enough to know
The Moody Blues were crooning, ethereal, over the crackling little speakers.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, I love you.
Cas’ heart felt like it was swelling, filling up and spilling over. He still hadn’t opened his eyes. A part of him didn’t want to, he feared the precious moment could be punctured with a single glance. That Dean would be spooked by their eyes meeting as sometimes was, because he would see how much Cas loved him and suddenly he would be gone. But in that moment he was a solid weight beside Cas, close enough to touch. He was breathing shallowly and was so still, as if poised for something. But what better moment would Cas have? He had promised himself that all he needed was for them to be alone together. And they were alone together. He needed to make his confession, end their careful dance and then ask for forgiveness, if that was what was needed, or (a more hopeful part of himself thought) to be invited in.
Of how they were answered by you
Dean found him, as he always did, as he always would when Cas was lost. It was only once that Cas had pulled him from damnation, but countless times that Dean had returned the favor.
Dean was bobbing his leg nervously and looking back at Cas with an expression that might have been hope or tentative pleasure. “Yeah, you’re welcome, man. I uh, have some headphones for it to.” Dean scrambled to produce headphones from a small drawer in his night stand and handed them to Cas lightly before pulling back his hands and rubbing them harshly over his own thighs as he watched Cas carefully search for the headphone jack and then place them securely over his ears. He could feel Dean watching him intently as he closed his eyes and clicked the play button.
Again I would spend them with you
I’d save everyday like
Dean was quiet for some time, looking between Cas’ intense eyes before he spoke. “I know.” he said, then let out a heavy breath and rolled onto his back gingerly. “What are we going to do?” He asked, and in that moment Cas could picture him perfectly as a child, wide eyed and with still so much of himself left to discover.
He thought back to when this body was foreign to him, how strange and claustrophobic it felt to be tethered to tender flesh and sinew, the awkward clunking of it. How it had ached to be spit out from heaven and onto the Earth, cast out without grace and left as a breathing soul in a body, no longer a vessel, but a part of himself he could not escape until Death would take him.
Their first night in that bed together, their new home warm all around them and smelling of fresh wood and paint, Dean would thank him profusely. He whispered it into the side of his neck and kissed it down his chest.
Not long after that Dean was injured in a hunt. Cas had no grace, so could not heal him. He had been afraid of this, being faced with Dean’s mortality, the fragility of his flesh. He recovered in the hospital but Cas couldn’t stop seeing the angry red gash in his side, the pallor of his face and the sick sweat on his brow as he held him in the car, hot blood seeping between them from where Dean’s palm was pressed against the wound. He had felt nauseous with fear and later when dean was sent home to recover his hands shook whenever he had to redress the gash, but he insisted on being the one to do it.
Cas stepped in and shut the door quietly behind him. He couldn’t help but smile and revel in the buzzing warmth that overtook him. Dean was standing next to his bed in bare feet and pajama bottoms paired with a well loved band t-shirt that had a neck that was so worn it fell low over Dean’s skin, revealing one of his lovely, golden collarbones in its near entirety. He was turned slightly away and was holding something small in his hands. Cas decided to be brave and sit on the edge of the bed.
He had thought he knew pain, the pain of war that stretched out across the cosmos and burned cold with holy fire. There was nothing he could not weather, not the licking flames of the deepest pits of Hell or the divine wrath of his brothers. But he soon realized, alone with warm blood blooming soft purple under his skin, that he had yet to taste true suffering.
Later he would realize that the cure for his affliction was to confess. He should have known for how long he had watched humanity, seen them suffer for their silence. And for how long he had watched Dean, up close, seen how it burdened him to never speak on the heaviness of his heart. He thought of how humans had made unburdening a sacred ritual and understood why. He wished to sit at one side of a confessional, in the safety of darkness and comfort of the pungent scent of incense and paint the wicker window with whispered sins, have Dean on the other side in place of a holy man. He didn’t need his message to reach God, he had tried that too many times before and came back an empty chalice.
“I’ve been learning a lot about carpentry in my spare time.” Cas said seriously. Dean laughed. “Don’t laugh, Dean. The greatest among us was a carpenter.”
Castiel picked his axe up over his shoulder and collected the freshly cut firewood and held it tucked under his arm. He marched up to the house and was greeted by a wiry dog that Dean had brought home one rainy night after he’d almost hit it with the impala. They had every intention of finding its owner, but they never could. So Dean named him Bruce as in Bruce Springsteen and he made a good guard dog for their chickens. Cas nudged the half-latched front door open with his elbow and shut it behind Bruce with his foot. He retired his axe to the side of the door and stuffed his work gloves in his jacket pocket before hanging it on the hook. He scratched the top of Bruce’s head lightly while he unlaced his boots.
So he made a plan, spent many days and nights in restless slumber dreaming about how he would do it. He soon realized there would never be a perfect moment. People were too messy for that. He was too messy for that. The beauty may be in the fact it would never be perfect, just the way that they would never be perfect, a righteous man with a charred soul and a broken fallen angel. So he would gather his courage and breathe through the foreign erratic beating of his heart and only wait for a moment he and Dean could be alone.
A treasure and then
Cas smiled and laid back on the bed. He knew this song.
did this. Dean only got mad because
"No, that's
Dean being Dean, insisted that they stopped for lunch before heading to the station.
I'm talking to you. I want to work through things. You don't make me unhappy."
"Cas, he's abusing you."
"Just give me more time, Cas."
Sam was sitting at his desk again. "I still love him," he mumbled, "I can't stop loving him."
"Okay."
me, how can you love me?"
Cas sat next to him on his bed, and copied his position. They leaned against the headboard together. Dean saw Cas keep his hand palm up as an invitation, but he didn't take it.
made him mad. And now-"
Sam moved next to him and lightly put a hand on his back. "Cas, breathe. It's okay. It's not your fault. Breathe."
Cas knew Sam was worried about him, which was appreciated, but he just couldn't get out of bed.
"Sorry," he whispered, rocking himself back and forth.
Then Sam saw his throat. He stepped into his space, lightly touching the red skin. "Fuck, are these-he did this, didn't he."
He studied Dean for a moment, trying to decipher if he was being sarcastic. It was frustratingly hard to keep up with his mood swings. "I want a relationship with you. I want to be with you."
——————-
He finally returned it, and his heart warmed.
Cas nearly plowed Sam over when he slammed the door in Deans face. "Shit, Cas, you okay?"
Cas sucked in a sharp breath. He still didn't think it was abuse. Everything he got, he deserved.
"Don't."
Cas could hear the regret and bitterness regarding the town. "Did you? Want to get out?"
He would carve his words into Cas’ hip with his teeth and then go quiet as he knelt down and took him into his mouth as communion.
The first thing that I’d like to do
“Thank you, Dean.” He said softly, looking up at the other man with what he hoped was obvious adoration. This was a precious gift, music was something very meaningful, almost sacred to Dean and Cas loved so much that he wanted to show Cas the things he listened to and thought were moving or beautiful. He pictured Dean hearing a song and thinking of him and nearly went dizzy.
So he opened his eyes and he turned his head and he found Dean watching him as he knew he would. The song was ending and they were breathing so close together. There were flecks of hazel in Dean’s wide green eyes. His brow was pinched, as if it pained him to be so close.
“Good morning, sunshine.” He’d say, half smile on and looking at him appraisingly. “I guess human Cas is a morning person.” Cas just smiled and put water on to boil the way he had seen Sam do it.
Dean did not put up as much of a fight as he thought he would. Cas had turned to him one night in bed (their bed, in the room that used to belong to Dean alone).
Dean cleared his throat once, gruffly. “You want to come in? I uhm… I made you something.” His voice was still inviting, but hesitant, self continuous. He wasn’t meeting Cas’ eyes.
“My big strong man.” Dean teased. He smelled like woodsmoke and their lavender scented laundry detergent. Like home. Cas chuckled lightly and kissed at Dean’s hair.
“I think I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my life.” He said, smile creeping over his face until it was shining out from his eyes and bathing Cas in the glory of his love. With a swooping feeling of awe and dawning clarity, Castiel realized that the same was true for himself. Of course he knew that he was dizzyingly happy, that he knew a love unknowable to any heavenly body, but he had not until that moment compared his current state to the immeasurable length of his existence. The last two short years had been the most beautiful he had known in all of creation, and it was because of his Dean Winchester. The righteous man, the only man. He closed the distance between them and cupped Dean’s gorgeous face reverently. Because he was allowed to, because Dean should be worshiped, because love should be worshiped, and he kissed him soundly. Dean melted right into him and then rested his cheek against Cas’ shoulder like he belonged there. Cas could feel his grin against his neck and his chest shake with easy laughter.
And dreams that had never come true
He used to wear Dean’s before he got his own, one half size smaller. He hadn’t liked the stiffness of the laces, so he’d switched them out with the soft, worn ones stolen from Dean’s old boots. He looked down at them now and smiled.
Dean took his hand in his own and ran his thumb along Cas’ knuckles. “Alright then, big guy. But if you become a carpenter you have to build me a house. With a big kitchen and a fireplace.” His eyes were hooded and there was a smile on his face. Cas knew he was teasing, but he took the request to heart.
He didn’t expect Dean to feel so strong, so warm. He didn’t anticipate the shiver that ran over his skin or the warmth that pooled like sun soaked honey in the center of his chest. It took less than a moment for Cas to grip him back, to wrap his arms around him and squeeze with the strength he wanted to, a strength that wouldn’t ever hurt him, would only ever match him because Cas was now fragile but solid. The way that Dean was, always beautiful in his razor thin tightline-walk between complete vulnerability and steely strength. They were equals now, and the thought cut through Cas’ confusion and lit up a jolt in his stomach. He was now a man, and he was beginning to understand that a graceless soul felt love more ravenously than reverently.
Dean turned slowly and then paused. Cas was familiar with this game by then, the tension that would settle heavy in the air, conglomerate like a living entity that held its breath in time to them as they orbited each other carefully, carefully. His lips parted to speak and then closed again. His eyes flicked up and Cas caught his gaze and held it there. Dean licked his lips, pink tongue flashing out once, then sat down next to Cas. It was abrupt and Cas thought it might have been an excuse to break their staring contest. This way he could look down at Cas’ hands as he pressed something rectangular into his palm.
If words could make wishes come true
He gripped the handle of his axe through padded work gloves and swung it up and over, feeling the twinge of his shoulder, the pull of its weight as he swung it down to hit its mark. A dull thwack cracked through the still air as the short log split in two and fell on either side of the squat block Cas had sat it on. He placed a half back on the block and raised his axe again. Each hit was well aimed and practiced, his body falling into a steady rhythm with only a little protest from his lower back.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. His brows pulled together more severely. “Cas…” He exhaled as he said it. “Cas…” he said again, closing his eyes.
“I think I’m going to look for our cassette player after breakfast. I’ve been wanting to listen to my old mixtapes.”
Cas would tell Dean he loved him everyday, softly and teasingly and hotly into the line of his throat. After a while Dean started saying it back.
As a human it was different, less feasible to love Dean from a distance, less bearable to keep letting him bloodlet his nurturing and protection without receiving the same back in the intensity Cas knew he could provide it in.
“I have a promise to keep,” Dean told him, reaching for his hand. “I’m here to take you home Cas, to our pack.”
“You have no right to threaten us.” Chuck hissed.
Cas watched them before going back to his own packing, taking the very few bits of clothing and books he had.
“Cain?” he called tentatively after he entered the service room. “You here?”
“Sam, can you give us a moment?” he finally said. “I need to talk to Cas.”
“How?” Dean demanded, loudly. “Other me said that she was his and the other Cas’s kid. So how the hell is she part demon?”
“You built this?” Cas blurted now unable to keep his amazement under wraps.
“If we keep her here she’ll use her powers.” Dean shot back. “Leading Chuck right to us and to Jack.”
“A park,” Dean said starting the car. “Someplace he could watch bees.”
“Where are you?” he snarled. “What did you do with the blade?”
“Then we tear every last one of those bastards apart. I’m not letting them take my mate.”
This was something Cas wasn’t used to. Dinners and meals were a somber afair at his pack family home. You didn’t speak unless you were given premision by the alpha and it was always more of a report session than an actual time with family. Here, here it was chaos in the most fun way. Everyone was talking over each other yet somehow still getting the story across. Everyones laughing and smiling. It was nice. His pup loved it anyway. Everyone loved him. They cooed and awed over him, and Gertie. Pups in general, everyone saw them as a blessing. So having two was great for the pack.
“I understand.” Cas nodded. “But you are also my alpha now. Just… just ask me before you do something you think is overstepping, okay.”
“Dean,” she whined, turning her head away. “Stop.”
“Yeah.” Dean smirked.
“No, you don’t.” Dean growled, tossing the skillet into the trash.
“Dean?” Jody called, coming through the front door. “What do you want us to do?”
“Hells Bells,” Rowena chimed, looking around frantically, a broad smile plastered on her face. “Sae thes es th’ Men ay Letter’s stronghold, eh?”
“Yup, our little girl is gonna be a Doctor, Lawyer, and President all in one,” Dean smirked, setting up the stove for breakfast.
“What did the bad man do to mommy, why does she look like a boy?” El asked, tilting her head in a way that reminded Sam of Cas.
Gabriel nodded back before heading for the house letting Dean stride to his car.
As they struggled to lift the dead weight into the box, she started drawing a set of glyphs on the side of the box with sandalwood ash before stepping back as they shut and locked it and throwing her hand in the air.
“Is my son not acceptable?” Cas snarled getting deffensive.
Castiel tilted his head in thought at that.
“It took the whole pack like half a year to build it, plus the extra cabins.” Sam snorted as he was trying to help Jack out of his seat belt- which wasn’t easy since the boy wouldn’t stop squirming.
“Adam-”
“You can’t.” Cas urged. “Please don’t let him do this. She needs you.”
“You must be the dumbest prick ever to think you could get away with threatening my pup and his mother, on my land, right in front of me and most of my pack.”
“I can’t lose you.” Dean whimpered. “Either way, no matter what choice I make, I’ll lose you.”
So they ate, got to know each other better. Turns out, Dean and Adam were very similar. Both loved bacon cheeseburgers and anime. Though Cas and Adam hit it off really well. They talk the rest of the lunch about medicine and classes they were taking and how the teachers taught them differently. Adam even scouted in his seat so he was sitting across from Cas. Dean and Sam were kind of forgotten about after a while, which was fine with them. They were happy that the two omegas were getting along.
“No, it's fine.” she assured him. “I didn’t just come here because of that.”
“Guys.” Sam called, quiet and breathless with the shock of what he held in his arms
“Dean, I’m... I’m sorry.”
“Dean?” Sam called as his brother rushed forward, heading for the playground.
Oh, that just made him feel so very ill. Almost as sick as when he regained his humanity and remembered what he did to her.
But he kept going.
“‘En as high priestess aye th’ Winchester pack, Ah recognize Dean an’ Castiel as mates in th’ eyes aye th’ gods an’ thaur fellow packmates. Yu weel bae bonded now an’ fure’er more.”
“And she wasn’t raised by Knight of Hell you.” Cas insisted. “You were cured of the Mark before she was born. She was raised by us. A human and an Angel.”
"I know that." He assured, suddenly aware that he did. He always knew, in his soul, that Dean would come back. "That's why I came to Lawrence, so you could find me."
“Weeel, Ah can transfer it.” she told him. “An’ aye, Ah know ay a spell ‘at’ll keep th’ wee babe safe.”
“Jack,” Cas started. “Your daddy kept his promise. He came back for us, and is taking us home.”
Dean choked on that, Jack looked uncomfortable and Sam snorted out of humor at his brother's expense and horror from the image that penetrated his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That would be nice.” Cas nodded.
“Cas.” alternate Dean implored grasping Cas’s hand. “Take my memories, please. You need to know what she is. Why she is so important. I can’t tell you everything, not in time. Please.”
“I’ve already talked to Bobby about this. He’ll have it covered till I can come back. It’s not like we’re that big of a pack.”
“That is not happening.” Dean snarled, stepping next to Cas. “I formally offered him and our pup a place in our pack and they accepted. He won’t be going anywhere.”
“He left your pack six years ago.” Dean cut her off. “He is part of my pack and I’m courting him. Whatever claim you think you have is null and void.”
They all looked to the closest cabin, where Donna and Jody were standing on its porch, arms crossed and both in full uniform.
“Th’ kind hoo ne’er wanted tae bae a mother tae begin wit.” Rowena growled back. “His father made meh promises he ne’er intended tae keep. Burdened meh wit a squalling infant an’ nae future.”
With an urgent passion, he leaned down, pressing his lips to Cas’s connecting them in a way they always needed but never knew.
"That I left before he was born to find a better life for us, and that I'm back to take you home. As long as you want to come home."
It seemed, with the presence of actual law enforcement there to back up the pack, the Novak’s lost the wind in their sails to their boat names entitlement. They looked helplessly between the sheriff's and Dean completely at a loss.
“Huh, I wonder…”
“Bobby.” Dean addressed, his back straightening just a bit. “Good to see you finally made it.”
Thank you for giving this a read.
She locked eyes, making sure he felt the full brunt of her words.
Cas shook his head, gritting his teeth.
“You are still our pup.” Naomi hissed. “Our omega. You are ours to do with what we will. And now that you’ve delivered your bastard to his alpha you will come home with us and mate with the alpha we’ve picked out for you. You owe us that.”
“Micheal?” Chuck asked. “What are you doing here?”
Even if it was a pretty woman.
"Cas," Dean shook his head, rubbing a hand over his face. "Whatever you're going to say, you don't… I… Cas I'm so sorry."
“I think I’ll go for a drive.” Dean smiled, getting up and heading straight for Baby.
“Mmhmm.” she smirked, going back to watching the pups, but something else caught her eye. “That isn’t one of ours.”
“Dinner should be ready by now.” Sam called from outside the car, with a very hyper Jack on his arm. “Say we eat, introduce them to the pack, then show them around the lodge.”
“Who cares.” Adam chuckled. “She and Chuck are old nuts. At first, they freaked. You know, they didn’t want to pay for me, I wasn’t from an old and prestigious family. But Micheal… he just wanted this all to be behind us. At first, he didn’t care what I did. But… Mom just wanted me to be safe. Naomi and Chuck worked out something they thought would work. I would be his mate, but not the mate. Micheal could still mate with an omega from another family for an heir.”
“That’s what he said.” Dean nodded.
They hadn’t seen Cas in months.
Before Cas could say much more, the bunker door opened loudly alerting them to Sam’s entrance.
"Tell me where you are, angel. Right now." His tone made it clear that there was no arguing.
“Why not?”
“What about the pack?”
He blocked, pushing her back. She was pulling her punches and he knew it. She wasn’t willing to hurt him, but he was. If this went on too long and he didn’t get his way, he would force her into submission.
“He wanted to meet here?” Sam asked.
“Dean won't let anyone hurt me.” Adam told him, watching the windows.
The old demon looked confused but intrigued.
“I love you.” Cas murmured, pressing her brow to his.
“You wouldn’t happen to know a spell that could knock out a Knight of Hell and trap them in a dream world forever.?”
Jack looked torn, this was another version of Dean after all. Another version of one of his dads. And with his soul back he was hurting for the sight before him. Yet he understood. He had to keep his powers under wraps.
El finally got her powers when she was four. They found this out when she got mad at Dean for not letting her have a cookie and threw him against the wall with her mind. He came to with her crying in his lap promising to never do it again. Rowena ended up enchanting the amulet to keep El’s powers under control. They only let her take it off when they were training her to use them.
“Naomi must hate her.”
“You’ve come to end me.” Cain said solemnly. “To stop me.”
“With her parents being who they are it really shouldn’t surprise you.” Sam snorted.
They all looked to Jack after hearing that.
“I don’t know Sammy,” Dean shook his head, but kept the growl in his chest. “But I made a promise and I don’t go back on my word.”
It sent a surprised Chuck sailing through the open door and tore at the very air around her. Tearing so hard that it caused a rip. A long glowing rip. Dean watched awestruck as the rip flickered with the vibration of her scream before settling as she quieted. He had to hurry to his feet and forward as she started to crumple down having used more of her power than ever before.
“C’mon.” Dean ushered, placing a hand on his shoulder, before taking it away.
“Cas, you there?” he called quietly. “Bobby told me about how you and Jack got this place in such good shape. I’d like to thank you, in person. So what do I got to do to get you here.”
I'll see you in the next story, and never stop fighting.
“Do you understand?” Cas repeated, growling low and threateningly.
“And if I don’t want to be brought back?”
“Surprise?” Cas raised a brow.
Looking over his shoulder Cas smiled as Dean entered the library.
“It is.” Cas agreed, leaning into his alpha.
“Cas.” Dean gritted again, struggling to keep his cool. “With everything that’s going on, I don’t want us to mate just to fix it all.”
“You took him to the bar?” Cas asked, raising a brow.
No time like the presant, best to jump on the boat now and see whether it’ll sink or not.
“Dean,” A woman in the kitchen called, stirring a pot of something that smelled delisious. “Welcome back. I see you brought guests.”
“What were you doing?”
“Because I love you.” Dean snapped. “And I don’t want to do this just because it’ll fix everything. Our love means so much more than that.”
“And run a pack.” Adam nodded.
“Alright.” Sam afirmed looking at his phone. “I got to go get Eileen. See you in a minute.”
“Okay, then we’ll work out online classes or something.” Sam shrugged. “Look, before Dean met you, our lives weren’t looking so good. We would still be with our dad or following his path, hunting rouges and hopping from hotel to hotel living by the skin of our teeth. When Dean met you he wanted to be better, for you, for your future. He wanted to give you everything he didn’t think he would have. So he became better. He started to talk about starting a pack and imspiring me to do what I wanted. He encouraged me to go to school and did so himself. He owns this bar now, and volenteers as a firefighter. He worked hard to build a place we could call home. I have a home now, and a career in my future. I’m studying to be a lawyer and have a good shot of becoming part of this firm once I graduate. And all this is thanks to you, thanks to you making Dean realize he could be more than what our dad wanted.” he took a moment to catch his breath after that, letting it all set in for Castiel. “So… I want to help you; I want to pay back the blessings you gave us. I mean, you did all that, and now I find out I have a nephew.” he smiled looking back to Jack and Dean, who were just finishing up. “I couldn’t even begin to thank you enough, for doing all this for us and for making my brother so damn happy. But I want to try. So, just think about it, alright. Talk it over with Dean, then let me know what you want to do. I’ll help you in whatever way you want. Kay?”
They drank then shared a kiss, standing and facing their back now as an official mated pair in body and soul.
Please let me know what you think.
“I won’t get rid of her.” she suddenly cried, biting her trembling lip. “I know what she is. I know what she could become. But I will not throw her away. She is part of you. I can’t… I could never kill a part of you, even a small part. She is mine. Please don’t make me give her up.”
“Morning, love.” Cas greeted handing him a cup of coffee.
“You’re right, I just…” Dean sighed, scratching his neck. “I don’t want to over step. Not when we’re still so…”
“It’s public enough.” Cas commented.
But his omega was so close, he could feel it. The omega that had invaded his mind and had his heart throbbing for six years was so close. And he could barely control himself.
She reached into her shirt pulling out Dean’s god-seeking necklace, holding it up for them all to see.
“Hang on Cas.” Dean hissed, flooring the gas. “I’m coming.”
Cas didn’t answer, she just turned on her heels and marched out the room, then out the bunker all together Sam close behind calling out to her.
See you in the next story.
She couldn’t get out any words, just cried to the heavens.
“Yes, it is.” Cas nodded, turning his attention back to his family, thinking it was a bit rude of this alpha to purposefully put off his scent like that. But a lot of alphas do that without thinking when meeting someone new, almost like an instinct to show the others they were top dog.
Then came Crowley and his small pack. Crowley was an acclaimed accountant for many large businesses and his mate Billie was a mortician- actually worked with Amy. Both were alphas as were everyone else in their pack and boy did they all exude the prowess of alphas. They stopped by the bar often and shared their stories with Dean. Crowley’s mother and stepdad, Rowena and Catch stopped by too. Though Rowena often claimed the bar was too low class for her. This landed her in a snarling match with Ellen more often than not. She owned her own little occult shop and acted as a high priestess for plenty of old fashioned packs. Dean was a bit old fashioned himself. He believed in the old gods. Mostly that they were dicks, but he still believed. Catch on the other hand was a contracted bodyguard and sometimes bounty hunter. He was a smarmy bastard, according to Dean, but he was okay enough to eventually become part of his pack.
“NO!” Dean cried only to be flung into a glass case, worsening his condition.
They ate the pies and foods prepared for them by their pack and accepted gifts all while keeping tiered smiles on their face. While planning all this they were still working and going to school. So even though they were enjoying the party, they were worn out.
“So they drove nine hours to talk to us?” Sam hummed. “Is it just him?”
“Thank you, Donna.” Cas nods.
Dean was actively nosing his scent gland now, humming and growling lowly at the scent his omega was admitting.
“No, she was raised by them.” Dean pushed. “We don’t know what kind of people they were.”
“That’s the girl I know.” he smirked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Until when?” Sam asked.
“Hey, guys.” Chuck smiled. “Now this, this is gonna be awkward, but I need you to kill your daughter.”
“Bullshit.” Cas spat. “You were gonna let that alpha kill me because I was pregnant and pissed him off. I’d say that qualifies as you kicking me out of the pack. And you’re not even the alphas anymore, Micheal is. Does he even know you’re here?”
“Yes.” it was barely a whisper, but Dean still heard.
“Really.” Cas smiled.
“You bet.” Gabriel smirked, looking over Dean’s shoulder to the house. “Saw you talking to mommy dearest. I assume you’re here to make good on that promise you made six years ago.”
“But first we have to pack.” Cas told the boy, standing to his full height and heading for his dresser. “Why don’t you ask your daddy for help.”
“She senses you.” Cas mused. “She loves you.”
“Cas.” Dean choked. “What is that?”
“So I may have promised Jack that we are going to the park after you finish eating.” Dean told him, sipping at his coffee.
In the end, he just froze up.
A cold shadow fell on his heart that day.
It was run down and abandoned long ago. Barley a pile of splinters resting on stilts. But even from the car park in front of the building, Dean would feel the power inside.
“Sam, Dean, Castiel?” he asked just to be sure.
Sam even met a girl named Eileen and brought her into their fold. El loved her immediately and Eileen loved her. She fit in perfectly.
The pack was great for Cas and Jack, this he knew for sure now.
Dean chuckled at that, mostly to cover up the glee he felt at the fact that his possible mate was willing to have more kids with him.
“This doesn’t concern you.” Ramiel snorted.
The door slammed shut just as the car came to a screeching halt right in front of him.
“I don’t need your permission!” Cas exclaimed. “I’m not part of your pack anymore! Now leave before my alpha rips your throats out!”
“What happened to your body?” El asked, looking the angel up and down. “You look like a boy now.”
He had a half brother that his dad told him about in secret, an omega named Adam. Looking back at the house he wondered if it could be the same kid. Though he never met him so he wouldn’t know Dean if he did try to confirm it.
“You can do that after we’re sure he’s not in danger.” Ellen told him, forcing a tray of food and coffee in his arms. “Take this to your mate. He’s sure to be hungry after all that.”
"Whatever he believed, happened." Dean clarified. "And you're telling us that she is one-third angel, one-third human, and one-third demon?"
She jumped, pulling off her headphones and glaring at him.
“Your right.” Cas smiled. “But I’m tired of waiting. I love you, and I want to be with you.”
Chuck merely shook his head.
This was odd for Dean. The way Cas spoke and looked, it was almost…
“Then we’ll fight.”
“I sleep on the third floor.”
This is mostly for those who follow me as a writer and anyone else who it interests.
"Gabriel told me about Barthalumul."
So of course it had to go bad after a while.
Walking up to the front door Dean took a deep breath and tried to keep his scent as pleasant and calming as possible. From what he remembered the Novaks were not fond of random alphas. Which is why he had Sam stay in the car. He knocked once and waited.
A love that he felt so keenly and could only compare how he felt about Sam.
“MOMMY!”
“They want to sell Cas off to some asshole even though I’m currently courting him.” Dean snarled. “They have insulted and threatened my pack. What I need to know is where you stand with all this. Are you going to side with them and bring your whole pack after us? Or are you going to sit on the sidelines?”
Thanks for reading this story it means a lot to me.
He went all the way to Cas’s room, pushing the door open gently and spotting the now sleeping girl. The girl that his alternate self was willing to sacrifice everything for. The girl who his other self loved so very much even knowing what she was, where she came from, how she came to be. He selflessly loved and cherished her.
This was his child. Yes, it was a part-demon but he had met one of those. Jesse was a sweet kid despite his parents. But it was also part angel- which wasn’t any better now that he thought about it. But it was part him, the human him, and part Cas.
Cas smiled as she sang, looking to the others.
Castiel, his Castiel, the woman, the angel he had hoped to be with for the rest of his life, was pregnant with his child. His half Knight of Hell child. What in the hell does he do here. Pull out his gun and shoot it?
“I’ll tell you on the way.” Dean promised.
His brother waited, but Cas did nothing else. Rolling his eyes, Adam elbowed Micheal, reminding him of where was.
Cas had to look away, not ready for them to become so gentel with each other yet.
“If I know Cas, he’s already working on getting his medical license. So I don't’ think he’ll care. He’ll have his own job to work.”
“The hell did you just say to my mate.” Dean snarled, he had seen Cas shoot up from his bench and smelled the defensive scent he was putting off, so he scooped up Jack and marched up behind the omega. “Pal, I don’t know who the hell you are, but you better apologize and walk the hell away, now.”
“So you don’t think that, I don’t know, maybe you'd want to dial back the alpha just a bit?” Sam motioned to him like he could sum up the word with Dean himself- which wasn’t untrue.
“It’s a baby.” she told him, becoming a bit wistful.
“And how do you treat your omegas?” he asked.
Turning to her makeshift altar, she began mumbling Latin grabbing the herbs and throwing them into her brass bowl. Finished with that she turned to the devil’s trap and blew the contents of the bowl onto the howling demon.
Cas watched them go, still seething.
“Just hurry.” Dean hissed.
“I’m not letting you get away.” he snarled.
“You know in another world, there are people who would be weeping tears of absolute joy to see you two together.” he smiled. “Though the ones they know are both guys. Aw well, who am I to judge?”
With that in mind, he faced Chuck, squared his shoulder as best as he could in his bloodied state, and stared him down.
“That’s my girl.” Dean beamed.
Thankfully, he was cured.
But then he became a demon and he didn't see the point in waiting anymore.
“What the hell was that?” he demanded once he was back in the kitchen.
“What?” Dean quaked.
Dean, carefully pressed the boy closer, catching Cas’s downcast glance.
“You… You remember that?”
That got both men to pause.
Spinning on his heel he smiled at the sight of the trenchcoat-wearing angel.
Let me know what you think.
“What?” Dean asked turning with the others to see Sam holding out ever so carefully- the bundle which turned out to be a small girl wrapped in a blanket, fast asleep.
Now he may just be able to start living.
Ramiel didn’t answer, he just turned and walked back up the park path.
He hesitaited.
Thank you everyone for keeping with it and leaving you kudos/follows and comments.
“I swear.” they both echoed.
“Charles and Naomi Novak, you have both committed an egregious treason to our pack and alpha by outreaching your rank and going behind Micheal’s back to sell an unwilling omega, which already is against our laws, but also an omega that isn’t even apart of our pack and already mated. You have shown a distinct lack of respect to our alpha and our laws, and for this, you both will be banished from our pack. You will not have our protection any longer.”
“I am,” he told her, stepping just a bit closer, admiring her in just a blue bathrobe. “You know that.”
“Jack,” Cas sighed, going to his pup and kneeling so he was eye level. “I can’t just leave you.”
They had left Jack with Eileen- the pup had grown rather attached to her and liked learning sign language so it worked out well- still not trusting the omega and alpha just yet to have him around.
“If we didn’t do this, Rowena would kill us.” Dean warned, hushed.
“Our little girl.” he assured her, taking her hand. “Cas, I’m so sorry for what I did. I should have talked to you, I should have-”
“Don’t you dare speak to me like that.” she snarled back. “You call yourself an alpha, yet you bend to the whims of an omega. How pathetic are you.”
“Dean?” Sam asked, noticing the tense posture of his brother’s body.
Jumping apart they faced God as he entered the dungeon, hiding El behind them.
Dean was bleeding through so many puncture wounds. Cement and rubble were embedded into his skin and organs. But still, he used what little strength he had to drag himself to the dungeon to warn his angel.
“Shut it, Winchester.” Benny shot back.
“Cas no,” Dean growled. “I don’t want to mate just because we have to avoid a fight. Are you even ready to take that step?”
“Mom, who is this?” the boy asked, curious, not afraid.
Anyway, thank you for reading my fics and staying with me on this journey.
“Do you know where Cas is?” he demanded gently. “If you do, please tell me, Gabe.”
“Yes.” she snarled, using her new power to push him across the room so he was sprawling on the floor.
Sam looked to him again, a sudden thought striking him.
“I mean, he gave it to you, couldn’t he take it back?”
“Dean.” Sam chastised.
Dean smiled again, before leaning forward and sealing the deal with a kiss.
“Shut up.” Dean snapped again standing to his full height. “It was me. That whole thing was me. I’ve been in love with her for years now, and when I became a demon all the decent gentleman crap went out the window and I just took what I wanted.”
But now…
“You’re wrong.” Cas laughed, gesturing to the land and cabins around them. “He did all this for me and our future pups. He went off to make a strong pack for me. He loves me and our pup more than anything, and if you threaten me or Jack again he will end you. If I don’t do it first.”
The alpha chuckled again.
“Hello.” her voice sounded strained on the other end.
Everything was going to be okay.
They were now circling each other, squaring off.
“What?” he breathed.
“But-”
“I’m okay,” Sam assured, leaning down to hug her close. “I’m okay, we’re all okay.”
“Hmm.” Cas hummed, leaning further into Dean.
Cas watched them go, his pack close, his mate at his side, and his pup now on his hip.
“Dean, please, go home. I’ll meet you there. Whatever happened we can fix it.”
Everyday he was getting closer and closer to Dean. He could even see them taking the next step in their relationships soon. Things were so good. He was so happy, his new family and his bond with the alpha. Things were going great.
“Cas, what-”
Following her gaze he looked down the drive and saw a car coming toward them, and she was right it wasn’t one of theirs.
“You and he are welcomed at my bar, as long as he isn’t trying to take my mate.” Dean told him.
“My little angel.” he gasped, and seconds later, he was gone.
“She’s part demon.” Dean threw out.
“Don’t touch anything.” Sam told her with a grunt. “What do we need to get this done?”
Nodding, Dean headed back up to his office to do just that.
“Well, what about you guys?” he asked after a little while. “What are you guys like?”
They packed in silence, with Jack’s excited explanations about his toys to Dean being the only sound around them.
The Novaks where an old fashioned, traditional sick pack as Naomi had just demonstrated. Their oldest where a pair of alpha twins, Micheal was already mated to an omega and taking over the pack last Dean heard, while Lucifer was kicked out for challenging their father. After that, there was a whole slew of beta children that served Micheal and worked to keep the pack together. Then there were the two omegas. The youngest, Gabriel, and then Castiel. Both with a set bigger than any alpha could hope to have. Which didn’t sit well with the rest of the pack. So Dean assumed Gabriel was being forced to mate with an alpha or was being sent away. It actually surprised him he was here.
“Castiel-” Chuck started.
“Is that Supernatural?” he asked glancing at the game.
“And what do you remember?” Cas cocked her brow.
“What was it, Dean?”
All this only made Dean tear up more.
“Don’t you remember, daddy?” she asked, looking puzzled.
“I know. But what other choice do we have?”
“Then where is he?” Dean gritted, trying desperately to keep his alpha under control.
They headed up the last set of stairs up into the thrid floor where Cas could arleady tell Dean, and only Dean had really been. The scents downstairs were muddled and mixed, it was hard to distinquish between them since he was unfamilur. But here, here he could only smell Dean. Something in him calmed at this, had him deflating in a way that he didn’t even know he had to. He didn’t know he had been holding himself tightly together for six years. Being here, surrounded by the scent of the alpha who he had loved so wholely before all this. At that moment, he knew where he and his pup would be staying for now.
“I. Don’t. Know.” she ticked. “And even if I did, I wouldn’t tell you.”
At first, both alphas just stared at the omega while Jack giggled at his mother’s temper.
She nodded back, watching as the demon and hunter clasped each other’s forearms staring each other down.
“You?” Jack asked unable to say much else.
“Excuse me?” Cas gawked at them, absolutely dumbstruck by her words. “Are you fucking insane? First of all, don’t ever call my pup a bastard again. And second, what the hell makes you think I would ever come back and let you sell me off like a whore when I’m perfectly happy here with the father to my pup, and his pack?”
“Where is he?” he demanded.
Charlie became his best friend. She would come over and nerd out with the brothers, watching their latest bing worthy show addictions and reading them the books she was reading currently. That happened because Dean had said he doesn’t have enough time to read.
“Lawrence?” Dean affirmed.
“What, why?” Dean balked.
Dean laughed at that and got out, helping Cas with his bags.
"You have a policewoman in your pack?"
She looked to him, her eyes burning a hole in his soul.
“Jack,” Cas smiled, gesturing to Gabriel. “This is your uncle Gabriel, I’ve told you about him.”
Walking in Cas’s eyes got bigger again. The room must have taken up the whole back side to the top two stories in the lodge. The shelves were floor to cieling needing a ladder to reach the top. plush chairs and couches littered the floor, some crowded a fireplace. There were also tables  by the grand window outlooking the mountain side. Just glancing at the spines of the books he noticed they were a mix of fiction and nonfiction, though lore and mythology seemed to take up most of the shelf space.
“Of course it won’t be like before, we have a pup and we’re not even mated.” Cas said. “I just, I just want to find the right moment.”
“Gabriel?” he gasped, hardly believing this man before him was the snarky pain in the ass teen from his highschool days. “Is that really you?”
"So we tell him the truth."
“... I don’t know, maybe Rowena can help us. I mean she tried to kill you only to find that the curse won’t let you die. This thing probably scares her just as much as it scares the rest of us. It would be in her best interest to help us get rid of it.”
“Why do you smell so nice?” Jack hummed, his alpha’s scent lolling him into calming drowsiness.
“What are you going to do to stop them?” Cas finally asked.
“Go to school.” Sam clarified. “We are more than happy to watch Jack in the pack while you attened classes, and if it’s something you really want to do, I say go for it.”
The elder Winchester laughed at this.
Supernatural was this mobile game based on a book series about two brothers that hunted monsters. The game lets you choose between either being an angel, demon, reaper, monster, or hunter and go about the game trying to kill other players that were against your race. It was fun, Dean even played it.
“You’re not even mated.” Naomi scoffed.
What greeted them was puzzling.
Out of his periphery, he saw Sam put one hand on his hip and the other rubbing at his chin. He was working it out, letting the words play over and over again until it finally clicked. And when it did he finally let his eyes fall on his brother.
“Dean, Castiel.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” Gabriel waved him off. “You don’t have to worry about me. I was mated off right after you left. She’s actually an amazing alpha. Strict and didn’t really like my tricks at first, but I grew on her. I’m only here to talk to Micheal on her behalf. Kahli’s a bit too busy and loves to make Naomi seeth.”
He snapped his neck.
“Hmmm.” Cas hummed back, opening one eye. “Been awake since you left.”
“Don’t thank me.” Dean shook his head. “I’m condemning you to a hell of never solitude.”
They were in the study, Cas was rocking the toddler in his arms and humming what sounded like Rambling On. Dean eyed him. Looking between him and the girl.
“Yeah.” Dean sighed. “I’ll go see if I can’t find him. Cas, with me. I’ll need your power.”
“Chuck.” alternate Dean choked, coughing up blood.
He loved it when he saw it. He couldn’t say so or stay after Cas died, plus at the time he had the bunker. Now he doesn’t need the bunker, no monsters in Heaven. He doesn’t need anything. But he wants things. He wanted his car, wanted a life without monsters, and a white picket fence house. Now with this house, he had it all.
“Yes ma’am.” Dean nodded leading Cas and his pup to the stairs. “C’mon. Most of the pack lives on second floor, those who don’t live in the cabins with their families. Garth and Bess, Jody and Donna and the girls. Rowena and Catch have their own cabin but that’s because we forced them to. Their loud.”
“Yeppers.” Donna smiled. “Add that to the fact that both Jody-o and I are the sheriffs of the two towns on either side of the pack land and we just witnessed you try to take one of our packmates against their will to be mated off to what sounds like a real douche-cheese, and I don’t think you have a snowballs chance in heck at making it out of this alive.”
“What?” Dean asked. “What does that mean?”
Garth and Bess came along when Dean had to find a dentist. Garth, a beta ran a very affordable practice close to Dean’s college and say him without any hassle. They became friends through awkward small talk and an invite to the bar. Soon enough Garth and Bess were regulars and would be around almost every Friday to talk with everyone. Bess was Garth's secretary, but she wasn’t one to mess with. She was also a beta but had the fortitude of an alpha. When their first pup was born they would bring her with them every Friday and let Ellen and Jo gush over her. They found a permanent babysitter in Donna who fell in love with little Gertie the second she saw her.
“Yeah.” Adam nodded. “I’ll call if Micheal wants to talk.”
Pursing his lips Dean looked from his pup to his old flame.
“Like what?” Dean demanded, defensive.
“I’m not saying he’s not welcomed.” she assured. “Quite the opposite really. I’m just… pissed that this happened the way it did. But,” she sighed, throwing up her hands. “It’s in the past. We all have baggage, and all we can do is move on. So, let’s start over. Hey, I’m Ellen.”
Adam. Micheal’s mate. Dean’s possible half brother. Micheal’s mate Adam who might also be Dean’s half brother.
Alternate Dean smiled at her, a sad broken smile, tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Mommy? What’s wrong?”
Thank you to everyone who commented/reviewed and left kudos. I appreciate it.
Dean waited till he knew Sam was out of earshot before he approached the angel. Slowly and calmly so as not to scare her. Once he was right in front of her he pulled out a chair and sat before her, tilting his head to catch her eyes.
“Alright.” she said, suddenly standing up and going to her bag.
He saw Sam look between them again before nodding.
“So does that mean things are going good with you and Dean?” Bess smirked.
How he wanted Dean to kill her and if he did their world would be left alone.
“Well they are old fashioned, so I doubt they’d abandoned their ancestral home.”
“Enough!” Micheal snapped, holding up his hand. “Adam.”
“Do it mommy.”
“How do you know?” he breathed, tears pricking his eyes.
Castiel looked at him, brow furrowed.
He trusted Ellen more than most now, she was like the mother he always wanted, so he would let her explain before getting mad.
“Your right, this is a better me.” he smirked.
Cas smiled sadly at that.
So he shot and shot and shot. Still, she came forward. She was serene. Long dark hair that fell in such perfect curls that it was unnatural. Her eyes blazed a frozen blue fire, poorly hiding power that he could barely comprehend. She wore a long tan trench coat that reached her mid-thigh, covering a white dress shirt, blue tie, black blazer, and black pencil skirt held up by suspenders. To tie it all together she wore a pair of white victorian boots that looked more authentic than vintage.
“C’mon angel, we’ve both wanted this for a long time.” he breathed against her lips. “Just give in to it. Let me have you.”
"It's a half-human, half-demon child," Sam told him also eyeing the girl. "We met one once, a long time ago. Jesse. He could warp reality, kind of like you Jack."
Neither brothers said anything at first. Dean could feel Sam looking between them both seeing his brother was slowly unraveling and Cas was so on edge she was humming with power. Which also made him realize that a baby of an angel and Knight of Hell could give the mother a power boost while still pregnant. Right now Cas was most likely the most dangerous thing they have ever faced. But regardless, she was still Cas. She was their family. And she needed help. Dean knew that, but he still couldn’t form proper words. Thankfully Sam had his back.
Please enjoy.
“Cas-”
“You always tell me that you want me to be happy and that you’ll support me, I want that for you too.” the pup expressed in the best way a five year old could.  “Be happy.”
“Think about what?” Dean asked coming up behind them, holding Jack’s hand, the pup’s pack slung over his shoulder.
“You're saving this world from the mark.” Cain assured him before looking at the witch. “Do it.”
“That day he really pissed off Bart, the alpha would have killed him and my parents would have let him, and even though Micheal was our alpha he was still new.” he paused as Dean let loose a snarl, then continued when he calmed down. “He didn't have Adam yet, and still did whatever dad told him. Thank the Gods for that kid, my brother finally got a pair after him and started to think for himself. I think mostly because he was afraid about losing the kid, still, this happened before that. My aunt Amara stepped in. She put the alpha in his place and took Cas away, announcing that they were leaving the pack. My mother tried to stop her, but well, you know how auntie is.”
“You got me killed.” she growled.
With that confirmation, they pulled out their respective weapons and marched for the source of the shaking. They made it to the infirmary where in fact there was another rip shone with its golden brilliants. They prepared themselves for the worst raising their weapons high. They were ready for anything, after the Hunter Corp. Sam and Dean popped into their world there wasn’t much they didn’t expect.
“Micheal.” He called, giving a stiff nod.
“Dean.” Sam called, quickly grabbing Dean’s arm and pulling him to safety. “Rowena, hurry.”
He knew he had his brother there, Sam couldn’t say anything and just looked at his shoes.
But Dean knew, she was gone.
“I may have been keeping in touch with my baby brother since he dicked off.” Gabriel cocked his head. “But if I tell you, you got to do something for me.”
“Yeah, how about the one right next to mine.” Dean nodded. “C’mon, I’ll show you.”
“Yeah, and besides, Dean, I’ve seen you eat grosser.” Sam snorted digging into his eggwhite omelet.
He smiled as the grace flowed easily into her no matter how she struggled to keep it out.
The inside was open and roomy. Walking in Cas was greeting with a large sitting room with a fireplace in the wall and a large with a wrap around sofa. And a kitchen and dinning room big enough for twenty. Lastly, there was a grand staircase that led up to the second floor.
This was going to be tricky, Cas realized. Without Sam and Dean knowing what happened they couldn’t keep up this charade for much longer. That is when the idea struck him. They needed to know what happened. Then Dean will understand why Cas can’t send her away.
“... We could… there is a way that we could resolve this peacefully.”
“Dean?” Cas finally breathed.
“What?” Sam looked so confused, the words were not connecting and Dean didn’t want to say them again.
There was no way he could do what was being demanded, but he didn’t want the alternative either.
“Right.” Sam huffed, feeling like a total dick. “Sorry.”
“That your pup?” the alpha asked, nodding to Jack and Dean.
“Mother, your embarassing our fearless leader.” Crowly sighed.
“You’re not Dean.” she spat. “Get out of him!”
For a whole month, he had her in every way imaginable and ways that can’t be. On her bed, against the wall, in the shower, on the floor, and even on the ceiling. He took her however he wanted and she could barely fight him. Because she had wanted this too. And without her true grace fighting the human instincts she accumulated was near impossible. He took complete advantage of this. Fully embracing his demon influence.
“Hi.” Eileen said, while giving him the sign.
“This is none of your business.” Chuck sighed pinching the bridge of his nose. “We appreciate that you have been looking after our son, but now we will be taking him back home. The alpha we tried to set him up with before was not a good fit, but we found another one that will forgive his past sins and is willing to pay a hefty amount for him. After he offended that last alpha this is the least he could do for us to make up for all the trouble he’s caused us.”
Cas wasn’t in the room, meaning he was most likely in the closet in his nest.
“Wow.” Jack ooh and awed.
Cas spun around, a smile spreading across his face as he heard Dean’s snarl.
The room was bare, which made sense since Dean didn’t know he had a pup and he did kind of expect that Cas would want to sleep with him in his room. But still, it had a walk in closet and an ensuit with a tub and shower and it was definately bigger than the studio apartment he had back in Lawrence. About twice as big.
They both spun around, surprised to find their pup standing in the doorway of the shed with Sam.
“You all started dinner without me.”
“Sam’s dead, most likely Eileen too.”
See you in the next chapter.
Looking back and forth between God and his family, Dean felt powerless and cold.
“What is she talking about?” Dean asked.
“Of course.” Dean smiled gentely then. “I remember everything about you.”
“And if he’s not?” Jo asked. “I mean, I’ll fight for Cas and Jack. I’ll rip every last one of those bastards apart, but what if this Micheal guy is the one that sent them and he sends his whole pack after us? What then?”
And he did.
“And you?” Adam asked, glancing at Dean.
“Yeah.” Dean shook his hand too.
“Yes sir.” Cas told him, looking completely serious.
“Hello,” he answered.
“Boy,” she snarled. “You didn’t give him a number to call?”
Cas managed to nod.
“Hello.” Jack gave a wave.
“You got your grace back.” he said with a turs nod.
“What do you need from us Cas?” The youngest Winchester asked.
“Aye.” she chirped.
He may be an alpha himself, but he didn’t think he could ever stand up to this woman.
“Hey, I worked hard to get my liquor license. And yes, bars are great.”
“I’m still not sure about this.” Cas sighed as she and Dean sat waiting for Sam to come back with Rowena.
“Yup.” Adam nodded.
Thank you again.
“I do.” Cas reminded. “I saw everything from the moment they met for the first time, to their last stand together, to protect their daughter. They were just like we are now with only slight differences.”
“You think Cas will like that?”
“Is that how you clean a table boy?” Ellen demanded on his first day. “Put your elbows into it.”
One, go in and risk getting mauled by a distressed omega.
“I should stay with Jack.” He shook his head.
She didn’t give them a chance to rebuke as she marched out the church doors.
“We’ll find it.” Sam promised. “In the meantime, this is your home as much as it is ours. You can stay as long as you need.”
“Ah need yer help.” she told him.
“Okay.” she nodded, her eyes clouding over darkly, sadly as she looked up to Dean. “I promise, I won’t take it off yet. I don’t want to hurt Daddy ever again.”
He eyed Dean for a moment, then nodded.
“If you're asking me whether I treat my omegas like breeding machines that can be sold off as soon as their first heat, no.” Dean growled, low and warning. “Omegas are more than that. They are needed in a pack. They keep everyone calm when things get tense. They reminded alphas that being a muscle headed asshole is not the way, and they protect our pups. They are the balance that both alphas and betas need. That thing that keeps us peaceful and from ripping each other's heads off. Beta’s are the level headed planners, alphas the pack protectors, and omega the peacekeepers. You need all three to keep a balance and if you miss treat any of them, you’re not only upsetting the balance, you’re the worst kind of ignorant asshole.”
“What do you suggest we do with her?” Cas demanded, defensive.
“They won’t.” Dean snarled, not at her and she knew it. “If they come back, we’ll take care of it. Jody, Donna, would your officers be willing to help?”
“Sent th’ theng tae th’ bottom ay th’ ocean.” she brushed off her hands with a satisfied smirk.
“I own a bar, and volunteer for the firefighters.” Dean acquiesced.
“You’re going to force me into this?” Cas growled.
“Dean,” she shook her head again. “You are an abomination! This is the worst outcome.”
“Okay.” Dean nodded, shrugging to Cas and the others. “We can meet at the Butch ‘n’ Sundance around six if you’d like.”
“Dean?” her voice pitched in surprise and exhaustion letting him know just how bad his angel was suffering.
If this is something you'd like to check out then please look out for it wherever you find podcasts and YOUTUBE.
Dean pressed his lip into a line before nodding. He didn’t want to scare Cas after meeting for the first time in six years. And he doubted he could rein in his scent at this point.
They all looked up just as the sureliest, most good natured redneck alpha walked through the door.
“Right.” Cas nodded, still rubbing the girl's back. “So after ten months, El was born. Before that their Dean was cured after they put the mark back on Cain locked them in a Malec box so they didn’t free Amara or Lucifer. But still, El was born from an angel and a knight of hell. That’s why Chuck is afraid of her, she is extremely powerful.”
“We don’t know.” Sam told her. “We don’t even know if Micheal knows yet. This was all about us meeting Adam.”
“Castiel hasn’t been part of my pack since Amara announced that they were leaving.” Micheal affirmed. “I had no wish to keep them against their will. My parents don’t feel the same it seems.”
Adam nodded, doing as he was offered and staring openly at the brothers, more so Dean’s alpha stare.
“El,” he began. “Why don’t we go to my- mommy’s room so you can watch Scooby-doo.”
“Nothing?” Sam snorted. “Dean, you have been stalking all around the bunker ever since we cured you. You won’t even look at her. She won’t tell me what happened and neither will you, but that isn’t gonna cut it anymore. I need to know what happened.”
But it never came.
Dean’s eyes widened.
“Heres the deal, Dean.” Chuck began. “You kill your daughter, and I’ll bring back your brother, his girl, and let Cas live as a human for the rest of your natural lives. If you don’t, then I’ll kill Cas and your daughter and leave you here to wallow in your guilt and sorrow.”
“Cas, no.” Dean felt sick all over again. “I would never think that. You are still the pure angel I love. I just… I still remember what I did. How it felt, the look in your eyes. I can’t help but get a little excited at the memories. I’ve wanted you for so long. By my side. In my life as my partner and lover. But the way it happened, the fact that it was neither of our choices. That was taken from both of us, and I was the reason for that. That’s what gets to me. That’s why I can’t look at you. Because I just remember that I took so much from you. That I hurt you in such a way. And god forbid I go dark side again, it could happen again. It will happen again, I know. That scares me. That’s why I chased you away. Because I thought you were safer without me. And now with our daughter… Cas, I could hurt her.”
“Really?” he questioned, grinding harder, making her whimper. “Because I think I can get you to change your mind.”
“Hey easy pal.” this world’s Dean tells alternate Dean who was looking around wildly. “Don’t do anything crazy alright.”
Cas had to look away from the younger Winchester. It had been a long time since he was shown such concideration. All his life, he wanted to be more than what his parents and pack wanted. He wanted to be more than a breeding mare for some tool of an alpha. So he worked hard. Worked till he became valdicorian and graduated with high honnors earning a schoolarship to a good school where he could start pre-med. Then, right before the last week of school his parents pulled him out of school and started preparing him for Barthalmuel. He had never felt so sick in his life. Part of that may have been the morning sickness setting in though. It had been a month and a half since he had said ‘see you later’ to Dean by then, so he was well into his pregnancy. He wanted to rage and cry at his pack, at his spineless brother and his horrid mother and father. But instead he met the alpha, already knowing now that he was with pup, and knowing that Barty would do all the raging against his family he needed. In a way, Jack saved him from a life of missery. Which is just one of the thousands of reasons he didn’t mind not going to school and devoting his life to raising his son.
“I told him about how that’s where I used to live before mom died. He must have assumed that’s where I’d settle my pack once I made one.”
“And you can get rid of the mark?” he demanded. “And keep Heaven and Hell off my kid?”
Her long dark hair was a lot shinier than it had been and her eyes more vibrant, Dean noted leading him to one conclusion.
“Mommy!”
"Is that even possible?"
"Dean Winchester," He began. "I would like to formally ask to join your pack."
At first, they were just throwing each other across the room, but then their fight was getting more heated, and closer. They were now wrestling on the ground knocking over furniture and rubbing bits together. He delighted in the contact while she fought it. But then they paused. She was under him, he was pressing into her again, grinding really, making her lose focus.
“Cas, she isn’t mad at you.” Dean assured. “If anything, she’s a little disapointed in me. She is super protective of her packmates, espesially those she sees as her pups. Through all my stories and promises of bringing you home, she thinks of you as pack already. She’s just worried what this did to you, becoming a parent so soon.”
“I will not repeat myself,” Dean told him, putting an arm around Cas’s waist. “He is not going anywhere. You need to leave now before I gut the both of you.”
“Hold it.” Chuck warned, raising his own hand.
Still nothing.
“Dean called us.” Micheal gritted. “You two, what the hell are you thinking?”
“Really?” Cas snorted. “And where do you sleep.”
“What? What happened?” Sam demanded.
“What happened, happened. We can’t change it.” she told him. “We have to move on and focus on what is happening now. Right now, I’m pregnant with our child. Right now heaven and hell are hunting me down to either kill my baby or take it from me. Right now I need to know if you will please help me.”
They found the old house with minor difficulty. The town had changed a little in the last six years. It was this old ranch house on the outskirts of town. Just out of the way enough so they weren’t bothered too much by modern society but could still get to town.
Last chapter. I hope you all enjoy it.
PLEASE READ.
“Well, at least we don’t have to worry about our pack alpha’s heir.” Bobby snorted taking his seat next to his mate and getting a chuckle out of everyone. “Now, are we gonna sit here gawking or are we gonna eat?”
“Yes, you will.” Cas smiled. “But until then let’s keep it on.”
“C’mon.” Dean said, prompting Cas into the hall.
They did it with Jack, they could do it with El.
“Dean.” she called to him, cornering him in the kitchen.
“If you want to leave, all you have to do is get in my car and I’ll take you to my pack.” Dean promised.
“Dean?” she asked, looking scared, covering herself back up and backing up a bit. “Please say something.”
“What happened?” Dean demanded.
“I raped her!” Dean snapped, realizing a second too late what he said and slumping defeated against the island.
“Is it gone?” Sam asked, turning to his brother in a frenzy.
“Listen,” He told Cas now, just as hushed. “I won’t let them take you. You’re my omega, the mother to my pup and my pack. They will not have you.”
“Cas, you have to get out of here. Both of you.” Dean told her.
“Hi.” Dean said, stupidly.
“That is what Cas was implying.” Jack nodded. “I think anyway.” now he looked unsure, glancing to Cas for confirmation. “Is that what you were implying.”
“Do you trust me?” Dean asked.
“You think?”
So when the fourth year of Dean knowing all these people rolled around, he eventually came up with the idea to form a pack. He brought it up to Bobby first, who was skeptical but trusted Dean’s judgment.
Getting a hold of Micheal was a lot harder than he thought. So far he had called seven times and nothing. He was redirected to a couple of different numbers for emergencies but even then he didn’t answer. Finally, on his ninth call, he got a voicemail.
Dean shivered at the memory of first meeting her.
“I will go talk to Micheal,” Adam started after they paid the bill.  “And call you. He’ll most likely want to talk about all this.”
“I can’t just dump my pup on his alpha and pack like that.” Cas shook his head. “Once I became a mother, his dreams were all that mattered. Mine were put away.”
“Sherking your alpha duties already.” Sam snorted.
They all looked to each other worriedly as the little girl.
They were just approaching Kansas City when Sam’s phone finally rang.
“But we’ll be ready.”
“Really.” El’s eyes lit up at the idea of having a new friend, but the light dimmed suddenly as she looked down. “Does he have to wear one of these too?”
The dust solidified, wrapping around their joined arms binding them tightly. It began to glow red, then white making both cry out in pain. The solid dust around Dean’s arms turned black and then the color began to travel down toward Cain. It settled around his arm, then sank into it. The dust around Dean fell away, releasing him from the trap as Cain fell to his knees in an agonized howl.
“Hey Jack.” Dean started, kneeling with the omega to face his pup. “My pack, we got lots of cool people in there. You and your mom will be happy there. There is even a pup close to your age.”
It’s what he would have done.
“No, he wants to talk now,” Adam told him. “He wants to see Cas. He wants to talk to you, at your packhouse.”
Shaking her head, she looked away.
“Don’t you snap at me boy.” She chastised.
“Hi.” Cas smiled back.
“Bess.” he chocked. “We haven’t even been here for a month. It’s a bit soon.”
“Yeah, thanks for that.” Dean nodded.
"But things are different now." Dean told him, making him freeze in terror.
Still this didn’t prepare them for another Dean to come falling through, more gashes and cuts than skin and with a bundle cradled in his arms.
Dean could barely manage a smile.
“So how do we do this?” he finally asked, looking back to Cas. “What does Jack know about me?”
They walked around with Jack, getting congratulated by members of both the Winchester and Novak packs and part-taking in the dance of mates. They even danced under the maypole.
“And you did it?” the pup whimpered.
He followed the alpha out onto the pack grounds and to the back.
And that was it. They met at the Road House almost every night until Dean found the perfect plot of land for the pack. He then built a lodge in the woods with a few side cabins for whoever was ready to have pups, while the main building had enough room for seven, fourteen if they were mates. As soon as it was finished they all moved in. Donna and Jody stayed in one of the cabinets with their girls as did Garth and Bess with their pup and Kevin took up one of the others but everyone else stayed in the lodge. Two years after that, he opened the second pack bar, Buch and Sundance, and was ready to welcome his mate home.
“Yeah.” still dumbfounded.
He cradled to him gently as she had her fit, soothing her back.
“Cas-”
“I…” he couldn’t put it into words, everything was just crashing together. “Cas, I’m so sorry.”
“Anyway,” Ellen called getting their attention. “I’m gonna set the table, rest of the pack will be here in a minute. Jack, do you want to help me?”
"Sorry about the mess." Cas called over his shoulder as he bustled around his studio apartment. "I wasn't expecting company."
There was a long silence that had Dean sweating in his seat for the longest time. He watched his friends and family, starting to panic. This may have not been the best idea.
Cas watched with tenderness as Dean went in and gently lifted the girl into his arms and cradled her to his chest.
“Dean.”
“We better go home,” Cas told him, taking Jack who was reaching for him. “We have to gather the pack. This ends today.”
“Is the bad man still here?” she panicked. “I don’t want him to hurt anyone anymore!”
“I’ll tell you later.” Cas promised.
“You end that sentence with little omega and I will rip your throat out.” Cas snapped.
“I don’t know.” Sam shook his head. “The clerk wouldn’t tell me. Then again, a strange alpha comes in smelling intense and starts asking about a troubled omega. I wouldn’t tell me either.”
“Dean.” she answered on the first ring.
“I don’t like this.” Cas said again.
“Yes.” Cas nodded again.
It was another four hours before they finally breached the town limits of Lawrence. From there they let Google guide them to the corner where the store was located.
“Do you hear yourselves?” Cas cried, throwing his hands up in the air. “I’m not a part of your pack! You have no claim to me. How many times do I have to say this? I am part of the Winchester pack. I am the mate of the pack alpha. And this is done.”
But he knew that car.
“I got you,” he promised, trying to keep from coughing up more blood. “I got you, baby girl.”
They always did.
She seemed to expect that, or at least partially did. It still seemed to disappoint her. She crossed her arms over her belly.
“I’m gonna read to you.”
Three choices.
Heading back for his office, Dean saw the number was one of Micheal’s and fumbled as he tried to answer faster than was humanly or inhumanly possible.
“Are you sure?” Sam asked. “No you’re right, it’s worth a shot. Thanks, we will hopefully be home soon.”
“Does that mean you’ll be moving into his room then?” she raised a brow.
“There is nothing I’m willing to help you with.”
He had adopted his alpha, pack leader persona as soon as they entered the dinner. Basically, he just looked gruffer and meaner than normal. His eyes narrow, his shoulder squared, his whole upper body leaning and his scent wafting out in bold extra alpha pheromones. It made Cas roll his eyes and Sam snort. They knew what he was going for. No business, what he says goes, this is my turf, but it just looked so alpha it was ridiculous.
“Who are you?” Dean demanded finding his gun useless, he clutched at the demon knife behind his back.
“It keeps her calm.” Cas explained.
“He wanted you to kill a child?” Jack wondered, horrified.
“Don’t fight it, baby.” he soothed, pressing even harder.
He opened the door on his left, letting Cas in first before joining him.
“That isn’t the point!” Dean urged, glaring at his brother. “The point is we now know where she comes from and what she is. But what do we do with her now?”
“Where are you?”
“Ellen-”
“Nothing.” Dean shook his head.
"Yes." Cas nodded, still rubbing the girl's back.
“I won’t do it.” she snarled, breaking off into more coughs.
“Is that right?” the alpha drawled looking back to Dean, staring him down. “Well, that wasn’t what your parents told me Castiel.”
“Soon enough.” Dean smirked. “Cas will be here soon enough.”
All that was left was to find Cain himself.
And their child couldn’t be inherently evil.
“Yeah, Cas.” Sam huffed, leaning back in his chair. “We get it.”
“Hey, Cas.” he got out. “I’m back.”
“Bobby was the one who designed the house. He said that the alpha should have a cabin or a floor all to himself and his family. I wanted to stay in the house with the pack so I got the third floor. There is my room and my office, plus four other rooms for my pups.”
“Sure thing.” Sam nodded, looking up the stairs. “You better go check on him.”
"Dean, listen to - " she cut herself off as she began to cough uncontrollably.
“You could, you know, now I mean.” Sam finally said.
Cas stiffened at the name, his scent souring just slightly.
"What's a cambion?" Jack asked.
“Maybe.” she shrugged. “Or maybe you’re worried that things won’t be like before.”
“Alliance?” Chuck asked.
They told her everything, when and how they met, how their love story went and when they parted. They told her about Cas’s familiy and Barthalamuel and Amara. They ended with how Gabriel told Dean where to find Cas and how he met Jack.
“Hoo much Ah hated it.” the witch snarled.
“Not without our permission.” Chuck snarled.
“Alright, let’s start with introductions.” Dean said standing at the head of the really long table. “All you know this is Cas and Jack. Cas and Jack, starting on my left after Ellen is her daughter Jo and her Mate Ash, then Jody and Donna and their pups Alex, Clair, Paictents and Kaya.” they all waved to the pup and omega, letting off the most comforting scents they could. “Then we got Garth and his mate Bess and their pup Gertie. Sam and his girlfriend Eileen.”
As the wind picked up Dean caught a whiff of the boy. He smelt like thunderstorms and foggy forests. Like autumn. Like Cas and Dean. If the looks weren’t enough, then the smell definitely confirmed it. That boy, Jack as Cas called him, was Dean’s pup.
“Dean.” Cain urged, getting the eldest brother to look him in the eye. “I want to thank you.”
“Good tae meet ye dear. Dean talks non-stop aboot ye, doesn’t he?” Rowena smiled.
"And what would that be?"
“I know.” Dean smiled. “You’re stronger than most people give you credit for.”
“And for myself.” Dean sighed. “I mean, hunting rouges and ferals as bounty hunters, I don’t mind the job. Hell, I’m still willing to help other hunters, but it’s never the life I wanted Sam. I miss mom, I do, but she wouldn’t want that for us.”
“Who are you?” He demanded.
He hadn’t even made it four steps to the car when a sudden calming scent caught his attention.
“What if he’s in on it?”
“And that’s what I’m doing.” Dean told her. “I brought them home, my pup is part of the pack just like Cas.”
Charlie had been a fixed point in the Road House starting shortly after Dean started working there. The only one that outdid her loyalty to the bar was Jo’s mate Ash- but he had ulterior motives, booze, and his woman… yeah he was there every day. Charlie would come in and order her drink then sink into a chair in the corner and pull out her laptop. Dean left her alone at first, but as the nights went on, he started to get curious. It wasn’t until he saw her playing a game on her laptop did he start talking to her.
Thank you for reading.
“What are you doing here?” he asked. “You could have just called.”
“You won’t.” she insisted.
“Shut up Sammy.” he gritted.
“Hanc militiam marcum velle ligare.” she called, tossing some dust between them.
“Cas-”
“Don’t worry, we’ll get that alpha, alright.” Donna assured patting Cas’s shoulder.
“What did you do to Eileen?” Dean demanded ignoring his weird comment, buying time so Cas and El could escape.
They stared each other down, one alpha facing another. Though the odds were against Dean. This wasn’t his territory. He needed to end this.
Cas had just got home and was spending time outside with Bess watching the pups play on the swing set. Gertie was still a bit too small to do much, but Jack was gentle with her and pushed her slowly on the swing. Catching her if she started to wobble.
“I can’t tell you the whole story.” alternate Dean coughed. “We refused, and he started killing us. First Sam then Elean, Cas, and I ran and started the spell to get us here. But he got Cas before we could jump through. He destroyed most of my organs, then I used what was left of my strength to take El and jump.”
Dean grinned, still feeling the glow of it all.
“You son of a bitch!” Dean roared, raising his gun.
The location spell they used led them to an old church in New Jersey. Cas couldn’t go since Heaven and hell were still after her, and Rowena couldn’t be left alone in the bunker with Cas so Sam stayed home while Dean went after Cain.
“I see.” he looked around again, unable to stop himself from envisioning the way he wants the room set up.
“Oh,” Cas breathed, an uneasy smile crossing his lips. “No, it’s just a hobby. I like remedies and modern medicine, it fasinates me.”
“Well, the heat came on so fast, and I was at the library.” Adam started again.
Sam took the bundle trying to discern what it was and going stock still when he found out.
“I am not a Novack!” Castiel roared, squaring up his shoulders. “I am a Winchester. I have been since Dean placed his seed in my womb. You have no claim to me.”
“He respects that I’m not ready.” Cas hissed back. “But let me assure you, I have every intention of becoming his mate when the time is right.”
“How dare you talk to Ramiel so disrespectfully.” Naomi growled going to get directly in Cas’s face.
Adam hummed, looking between Dean and Cas.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean growled, lunging forward and latching his lips onto Cas’s, holding him close.
“Angel.” he addressed.
Dean was completely unsure of what to do at this moment.
“You never got our pre-”
“A few.” Adam nodded.
“So you agree that Cas is not one of your pack?” Sam asked, he and Dean flanking Cas as they stared Micheal down.
“He isn’t yours,” Naomi screamed, losing her cool now. “He is our son-”
“Castiel,” Naomi Novak snarled as she stomped out of the blue Auzmobile. “It’s time for you to come home, now.”
“I never stopped.” Dean admitted.
“Don’t worry, sweetheart, I’ll take care of you.” he assured, leaning her back against the wall and pulling a vile out of his coat pocket. “Take it.”
Slowly, he opened the door and peeked in. On the floor of the closet, Cas was curled up with a sleeping Jack while they were surrounded by scrapes of clothes and blankets. Some of the shirts, Dean noticed, were his. He wondered when Cas stole them, but he was so happy to see them in the nest he didn't bother asking.
“To make it up to you, why don’t we party up and I’ll help you get that item you're after.” He knew where she was in the game and what she wanted.
I own nothing, Supernatural belongs to Eric Kripke, the clever tic-tac.
“Don’t start.” she groaned. “It’s the only thing I can taste, everything else is just molecules, or makes me puke.”
“I have to.” Dean told the boy, his own voice weak with remorse.
Dean merely laughed at his brother plucking his phone out of his pocket as he felt it vibrate.
“One Elvis coming right up,” Dean promised, grabbing his keys. “Be back in a sec angel.”
“No.” Sam shook his head. “She already has four girls to look after. Even with Donna’s help that is a lot. We can’t dump a Nephilim-cambion on her too. That is too much.”
“Then trust that you’ll be okay. We’ll be okay.”
“I’ll be there in a minute, just got to pick up some medicine first.” with that he hung up eyeing the angel sitting in a cafe just across the street.
He… he wasn’t ready to see that, to be somewhere that was soely Dean’s. To be so completley surrounded by his force of pressence. Not yet, not until after they came to an understanding of how they felt for each other.
“I like it here,” Cas mumbled, clutching at the pillow harder. “‘M hungry though.”
“Dean, what-”
A look of shattering relief and awe spread across Dean's face as the words reached him letting Dean deflate on himself and breath naturally again.
“You said the same thing about me,” Jack interjected. “Because I was Lucifer’s son.”
“Not happening.” Cas shook his head enthatically. “I’ve got maybe two more in me but that’s it.”
“What?” Dean asked, panicking just for a moment.
“El.” alternate Dean breathed, relieved. “Bring her here, please. Let me see her.”
Cas helped him turn on his side so he could spit it into a pan which Dean rushed under him.
“Multiple time, over the course of many days-”
“Cas.” Dean called. “Cas.”
“Sure thing brotha.” Benny nodded. “And we’ll welcome him with open arms.”
“Think about it angel.” he insisted. “You and me, we’ve always had this ‘profound bond’ as you put it. Now, you think that I’m your charge or whatever and that's all there is to it. But you and I know that isn’t all. You were meant for me angel, and I for you.”
“Anyway, finish eating and get dressed, before Jack comes and breaks down the door.”
“Thanks, Gabe.”
Faintly he could hear him humming.
“I don’t need your say-so to do anything.” Dean shut them down again. “I don’t need anything from your pack. Even if I did, I would ask Micheal, not either of you.”
See you in the next chapter.
“He was worried about us. Did you ever go into heat in the six years we were apart?”
Dean studied him before stalking closer to the omega.
“Dean, your not-”
Of course, she did.
“Yes.” Cas nodded.
“He didn’t know.” Cas jumped in, worried this woman may actually kill Dean. “I found out a while after he left. He didn’t know.”
Dean thought about that, and the answer came quickly.
Jumping in her panic she rushed to close the door on him. But it was effortless for him to shove it open and enter. So instead she tried to run, but he caught her. Grabbing her by her upper arms he backed her into the nearest wall.
Eileen lost it, firing off rounds after rounds at the false prophet.
For the next couple of weeks, they put forth all their efforts into making the Malec box. It was complicated and they had to go through over a dozen different texts before finally getting some help from a reaper so they could make it with absolute certainty that it will not let Cain out.
“Perhaps we can come up with a compromise.” Micheal finally said.
“Then make it fast,” Cas ordered him. “I won’t wait forever.”
“Oh come on, it’s not like you can’t make another one.” Chuck tried to amend. “They just won’t be a half-angel half-demon monster.”
Cas nodded, looking to Dean offering for him to jump in then.
“Sound good, little man?” Cas asked.
“But…” Cas took a breath, bracing himself emotionally for what he was going to say next. “I think, it would be best for Jack and I to take a room close to you. Which one do you think is big enough for the both of us?”
"Well, you weren't far off. I live in Lebanon."
“Like hell it doesn’t!” Dean snapped.
“What’s the matter, Winchester?” Jo, a feisty blonde who liked to get under the skin, smirked. “You afraid of my mom?”
“You like Star Wars?” Dean smiled.
In the back of their minds they had a feeling of what was going on, but…
“Cas,” Dean sighed, rubbing his face. “We have way more important things on our plates right now. Like defeating God.”
“I’m glad.” Dean nodded back. “So, how about I show you the surprise I had planned for you.”
"A cambion?" Dean choked, looking between the girl and Cas.
“Cas he breathed.” taking a moment to admire the soldier before marched for him. “You came.”
“Nice day, isn’t it.”
“Boys, what’s going on?” Ellen demanded as soon as Sam and the the pup where gone. “You told us you were going to Illinoe to get Castiel, and then you call up Jody to get an adress for an omenga in Kansas and come home with your mate and a pup? What happened?”
“Mom!” Jack called running down the stairs. “The bathroom in Sam’s room is huge. It’s bigger than our house.”
“Yes?” she asked.
“Fine.” Dean sighed. “Let’s do this.”
“Cas,” Sam began. “Did he… transfer… his love to you?”
“Bobby, this is Castiel.” Dean said, gesturing to the omega. “And our pup, Jack.”
“Yeah, I’m pretty sure she can rip out my throat without trying.”
“What do you mean?” Sam asked.
“What are you talking about?”
“You do.” Dean nodded before wrapping one arm around Cas’s waist and his other hand cupped the back of his head, tangling his fingers in his dark hair. “You do.”
“Cas,” Dean whispered, closing the distance between them, pressing his brow to the smaller teens. “I promise when I’ve done it when I’ve made a pack and can keep you safe when I can support you properly, I will come back and make good on my promise. You will become my mate.”
“You have got to be kidding me.” she laughed. “Well no wonder that Barty putts was so pissed.”
It was their child.
Nodding, Dean rubbed his chin and catching sight of Jack just as he leapt from the swing only to rush back and pester Sam to push him again. He smiled as the boy giggled and beamed. Cas watched him, seeing the torrent of joy and fear swirl in his eyes.
“It’s ‘bout bloody time ye asked.” she snorted. “We been waitin’ fur four whole years ye ninny.”
“You know Cas, where would he go?” Sam asked.
Not long after Sam had started law school he came around the bar with his new girlfriend, Eileen. She was everything his little brother needed. She could put any and all alphas in their place, she herself was also an alpha but didn’t act like one- most thought she was a beta-, and dish out just as much as she could take. Dean thought she was perfect and loved her like a sister immediately. She was studying law just like him, and even though she was deaf she never let the world bother her. She was tough as nails and had great instincts to boot.
No longer able to hold back his menacing scent, Dean glared at her, snapping his jaw shutting her up.
“Either way, we shouldn’t hang around,” Sam told him. “Like I said she is suspicious of me. She might call the cops if we’re here too long. Might think we’re stalking him.”
So with that, he pulled out his phone and logged into the game.
“Och may, loook at yoo.” she purred. “All roond and glowin’. Ah remember it well.”
“You can’t just go through life without reading the books that these fandoms stemmed from.” she snorted.
“She’s kicking.” Cas hummed, catching his look of wonder. “Do you want to feel?”
“Such as?”
He had somewhere special he wanted to meet them.
Cas instantly recognized it from other Dean’s memories.
“I know. They know, but they won’t let you go like this.”
Sam nodded, handing him another book.
“Daddy!” he cried, gripping the alpha as tightly as his little arms could. “Where were you, why weren’t you here when mommy cried? Where were you?”
“Adam.” Sam nodded, gesturing to the bench across from them. “Please sit.”
“Dean-”
“You better give me an answer that doesn’t have the words ‘I left him pregnant in school’ in or so help me.” She snapped.
He ran through a thousand different things to say to the omega. A thousand emotions running across his heart. A thousand different scents. But that warmth stayed. And eventually, he settled with just standing behind the man and letting his scent carry to him. He saw when Cas caught it. He stiffened, not able to move for a short moment. Then slowly, like an animatronic with a wire lose, he turned to face the alpha.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“I’ll hold him off for as long as I can. Please, I can’t lose both of you.”
Cas gave Rowena one last glare before following Dean out into the study.
Wheeling around in hope, he was faced with a blond man wryly smiling at him from behind the barn.
“State?” Dean asked, getting worried. “What happened to him, Gabe? Is he okay?”
“Mommy, where are we going?” Jack asked, glancing between the two alphas and his omega.
As his pup, Jack would be drawn to Dean, for comfort and safety. Though this is the first time they met. So these new smells were probably confusing the pup. Best to let him come to Dean before they did anything else. Slowly, Jack came closer, and closer, till he was pressing himself to Dean’s chest. Letting out his own alpha purr, Dean picked up the pup and cradled him as he stood straight.
“Cas.” Dean’s voice was low and harsh, more a rumble than anything. “You’re going into heat.”
“I don’t know.” Adam shook his head. “I wasn’t even aware they left. I try to avoid them.”
“We kind of are.” Dean snorted.
“They’re interesting.” Dean shrugged. “Still have nothing on Sam’s obbession on the supernatural or sirial killers.”
“Jack.” Cas choked looking between Dean and his pup, panic starting to sour his scent.
“You will.” Dean assured. “I heard what you and Sam where talking about. Cas, I’ll respect whatever descision you make, but I want you to live not just for Jack and the pack, but also for yourself. All you’ve ever talked about was that clinic, back when we were in school. I want you to have that. I’ll support and help you in whatever way you need. I’ll take care of Jack while your in class and I’ll make sure you have study sessions with Sam so you can get all your work done. So please, we’ll do whatever we can, so please follow your calling. I never wanted you to be a stay at home omega. You’re not like that. I want you to thrive here. So please, talk to the university here and see what is availible.”
“Mine,” she told him, finally locking eyes with him, clear skies meeting rolling green hills. “And yours.”
Cas understood.
“Ellen, he’s not my-”
“He was.” Ellen informed, smiling.
“Now do you understand?” he begged. “We can’t abandon her. She is just a little girl. If we try to send her away Chuck will come and he will kill her. We have to protect her.”
Nodding Adam stepped forward.
“I know.” Dean affirmed. “I don’t either.”
“It’s gone.” he breathed, feeling for the first time like he could breathe cleanly again like every breath didn’t feel like it was being choked out of him. “Sammy, it’s really gone.”
“So, this is where you want to stay?”
“No, just trying to get my omega back. Which is just as much for the pack as it is for me.”
She had her arms crossed in front of her keeping her trench coat close to her body but not enough to reveal any shape of her.
“What do you want?”
“I’ll tell you later, kiddo,” Dean promised, looking up to Cas and giving a small sad smile as the omega looked about ready to burst into tears. “We should talk.”
“An obedient omega?” he laughed, more of a bark really. “Do you even hear yourself? Did you even really know your son? He was not a typical omega.”
“Never born.” Cas nodded. “She has no idea who you are.”
“He’s not my mate.” Dean shook his head.
Dean may be the alpha of the pack, and a stuborn ass of a man, but he could never challenge Ellen even on his best day or her worst. So rather than snap back and snarl at her, he backed up and bared his neck in surrender.
Jack stared up at his uncle unsure of what to make of him.
“Shut it, now, ‘In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.”
“Then what? What was it, Dean? What was so terrible that you both can’t talk about it?”
“Jack, do you remember how I told you your daddy would come back one day?” he asked the pup who nodded. “Do you know why he left in the first place?” he shook his head. Cas looked up to Dean, who nodded then continued. “He left so that he could find a better life for us. A home, a pack so we would be safe and loved.”
“Please, he… It’s just best if you talk, let him talk.”
“My name is Ramiel Prince.” He said, slowly, almost like he was attempting to be seductive. “I’m your future mate.”
“What if we gave the mark back to Cain?” Sam suddenly said one day.
The sound was quiet and strangled, but it caught him instantly.
“Can’t believe you talked me into this.” Cas mumbled.
“This isn’t over.” Chuck snarled before dragging his mate back to their car.
Meanwhile, Sam and he were working on finding a way to get rid of the mark.
“Yeah,” Cas nodded. “But I always knew it was coming and would arrange for him to be taken care of by my boss.”
“What did Chuck do?” Cas urged gently.
“Mom!”
Cas couldn’t help the small smile that spread across his face at the thought of the alpha. Looking up he could see him in his office, watching Jack when he should be doing paper work with Sam.
He threw the phone against the wall and ported just outside the bunker.
Cas nodded her thanks, glancing at Dean before looking away just as fast.
Cas already knew and was working mixing the ingredients needed to open a rip into another world when Dean entered.
Dean kept up his appraising glare for a moment, before getting jabbed in the side by Cas.
“Not happening.” He shook his head. “Not unless you want Chuck coming here and killing you.”
“Hi.” she waved back. “I’m El.”
“Ssh!” Cas hissed, looking down at the stirring girl, waiting till she settled before continuing. “In this other world, I didn’t possess Jimmy Novack. Instead, I was still in the body of the woman Jessa Danielson, the woman I joined within this universe in 1901. For the most part, their story played out the same as ours in this world, however, they apparently had a strong attraction to each other. When their Dean became a demon through the mark of Cain, he found his Castiel and they had sex.”
“I know.” Adam nodded, with a look of ‘no, really, I would never have guessed’. “When my first heat came, I was just out of high school. I was planning on going to college. My mom and I actually thought I was a beta, or we hopped. But then, one summer day…”
Adam nodded, looking down at the table.
“It’s me, angel,” he promised. “Look closer at my soul, you know it’s me.”
Her eyes narrowed.
“So, what happened?” Ellen asked. “Are they coming after us?”
“Okay, beef patty with a fried egg and icecream.” Dean called setting the plate down in front of the ever-growing Castiel. “Gross by the way.”
“He came to our world.” alternate Dean gasped. “He told us that he wanted to make us a deal. I kill El, and our world survives.”
“Dean…”
“What do you mean?” Cas asked, clueless. “He asked us to look after her. So we will look after her.”
But before he could do anything, El shot up to her full height, ripping the amulet off and giving a shrill, teeth vibrating scream.
He told them how he was God and how El was dangerous.
“Cas no.” Dean assured.
“Check him.” Sam urged putting his gun away.
“Castiel,”
“Um, no… sweetie, he’s got magic on him to keep his powers in check.” Cas assured.
“I’m Jack.” the boy answered leaning in closer to the smell.
It sounded like Hey Jude.
Cas and Sam stiffened, watching as Dean’s eyes narrowed.
“Oh god.” Sam groaned.
The boy chirped happily in response before running back to the sandbox.
The house became super lively after that. Most all the people that came through the front door welcomed Cas with a hug and ‘finally’, then gushed over Jack like he was the cutest thing they’ve seen since they were born.
“Jo, Ash, and Charlie will clean up.” Ellen told Dean, waving off her pup’s complaints. “You and Sam show Cas and Jack around.”
“Yeah, well it only lasted for a week.” Adam shrugged. “They wanted me to stay in the home and follow Naomi around and be her… secretary? Slave? I don’t really know. School was going to start so I told them that's not gonna happen. I was going to school. We fought, Naomi slapped me, Micheal threw her against a wall.” he smiled at that. “It was instinct, but still was great to watch. He told them right there that I would be going to school, I would have my own life, and that I was his one and only mate. He was the alpha of the pack so they couldn’t say anything against him. They still growl and glare at me, but now they are often put in their place when they try to treat our packmates like shit.”
“He is a grown man.” Micheal roared. “And not part of our pack. And more than that, it is not your decision who he mates with, it’s mine as pack alpha by our own traditions. What you have done is extremely disrespectful not only to Castiel and Dean, but to me as your pack alpha.”
“Jack!” he called, standing in a panic. “Get Gertie, come here.”
“I would never.” Dean hissed, now turning his full Winchester glare on the younger.
“Yeah!” she cheered, leaping into Cas’s waiting arms. “Scooby-doobie-doobie-doo, we’re gonna follow you~”
Her eyes lit up with power as the grace-filled her before fading into her natural blue.
“I’m at the bunker, with Sam. The blade is with Crowley.”
They swung open without him even touching them.
Gently he knocked his knuckles on the door and waited for an invitation.
“Of course.” Cas answered, no hesitation.
They were sitting in a diner, in a booth meant for ten at the most. Cas was sitting closest to the wall, then Dean with Sam being at the open end. They took the closest booth to the door so they could leave quickly should this meeting turn ugly.
Which brought us to this moment.
“It has everything to do with me. He is one of my packmates, the mother to my pup and my future mate. He doesn’t want to go with you, I don’t want him to go with you, he is not going with you. Now get the hell off my land before I tear you apart.”
“It’s fine.” Dean nodded. “I get it.”
A small boy came running from the sandbox, he had sandy blonde hair swept to the side and slate-blue eyes that shown with innocents that only a child could maintain. He couldn’t have been more than five years old and he ran up to the omega Dean had been watching holding out his hands as he offered the man a rock.
“You sure he’s even gonna remember you?” Sam, his little brother, asked from the passenger seat. “I mean, it’s been six years. You sure he hasn’t moved on.”
“She?” he breathed.
"Dean and I do share a more profound bond." She had claimed, if not but a bit exasperated that she had to even mention it.
“That sounds heavenly.” Cas moaned.
“Yeah, had to make sure it was perfect for when I brought you back.” Dean smirked. “There’s an area for a garden in the back, you know, so you can watch the bees.”
“Probably his parent’s old place.” Dean hummed watching as the buildings passed by.
“I need to send out a message.” Dean told his brother and friend. “Warn everyone about Jack so we don’t have another blow up.”
“C’mon kid, let’s get your stuff so we can go meet everyone.” Dean smiled as he ushered the boy to his toy chest.
“You're wrong.” to prove her point, another coughing fit wracked her body, bending forward.
“I love you too.” Dean gruffed, breathless and overwhelmed with the blood pumping in his ears- did he still have blood.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah.” Jack smiled following the alpha.
She stared at the glowing blue substance inside it and shook her head emphatically.
"Your fine, Cas." Dean told him.
“Uncle Sammy!” she cried, struggling out of Cas’s lap and rushing to the giant, climbing up his legs with practiced ease. “I thought the bad man hurt you.”
But the girl’s eyes suddenly got wide as she looked around frantically.
“We have rules.” Ellen clarified. “Rules that Dean put into place. You never force yourself on someone or use your pharamones to ensare them and if you make a mess you cleen it up. Take responisbilty.”
Chuck took exception to that, sending Dean flying into and through the wall just behind him. Eileen took this as the sign to start shooting. As did Sam.
Gabriel smirked again, glancing at the house.
“That hurts angel.” he hissed. “I thought I meant more to you than that.”
“Promise me.” Gabriel urged.
She was gone, it was gone, and he knew it.
“What did you do to her? Did you throw her around the room? Cut her up with the first blade?”
“Which one is your room?” he asked.
“I’m fine.” Cas assured.
Cas sighed looking back to his pup.
“Aunty Eilee!” El cried as Eileen and Sam joined them.
He laughed as she stalked closer, jumping back to his feet.
“Micheal was very fond of libraries and churches.” Cas offered. “Old fashioned places if you will. He would often sit in either for hours on end just reading whatever theology or religious text he found interesting.”
“Ellen,” Dean smiled, looking to his pup and friend realizing this was either gonna be really good or really awkward. “Castiel, this is Ellen, our pack mom and ass kicker. Ellen, this is Castiel, and our pup Jack.”
“Um, no… This is, I’m Adam, I’m his mate.”
I will forever be thankful to you all.
“See ya.” Dean waved him off.
“I knew you would come for me.”
“Deano, been a while.”
“And right now you are threatening said alliance.” Micheal said simply.
“Adam?” Dean’s interest peeked then.
It was his.
“Pish tosh.” Rowena waved him off.
“Cas, you awake?” he called gently.
“There, there, angel.” he cooed.
“Dean?” Cas questioned.
“Dean!”
She sized him up, then nodded.
“Aw, that’s adorable.”
“If you walk in there like this they’ll throw you out,” Sam told him. “Just let me scope the place out. I’ll bring him back here if he’s in there.”
The blush that bloomed across his face had him looking away and coughing on his tea.
“Still, she is a dangerous witch, Crowley’s mother at that.”
A Cajun alpha from the south that came up north to get away from his old pack. Traditionalist that didn’t sit well with him. When his desired mate was taken from him and mated to his alpha he retaliated and was banished. He made it to Kansas and was looking to start again, just as the Road House was looking for a new cook. Benny started right away and he and Dean hit it off like brothers. He and Dean eventually joined as volunteer firefighters and remained thick as thieves solidifying their bonds with fire and sweat. Not long after the boys started their volunteer work, Sam became friends with a beta woman named Amy. He would bring her and his other friends around the bar and that’s how she met Benny. They hit it off right away and became mates right before Dean made the pack. She now worked as a mortician and they were working on their first pup. It still made Dean snicker every time he caught them being cute with each other.
“Until Crowley es dead.” Rowena spat.
“All by yourself.”
“No, no.” Cas hushed. “The bad man is gone.”
He was able to find the little lake house where Cas was keeping Kelly.
“How dare you send an unknown alpha to a park where I was with my pup and mate.” Cas shot back. “Are you insane?”
“What did you do?” Sam asked.
“Jody?” Sam answered. “Yeah, we’re in Kansas now. Lawrence?”
“Cas?” Sam asked when they reached the war room.
“Hello Dean.” he sighed, leaning into the alpha as he stood behind him.
“We’ve been otherwise occupied.” Cas groaned. “Have we heard anything from my parents?”
“Oh,” she said. “I don’t get it, but it’s still mommy. I can see her other faces.”
“I wouldn’t come unless I had to.” she told them. “After what happened, Dean made it very clear he didn’t want me here. But the angels and Crowley are hunting me.”
Hello, welcome back to She is ours.
“Castiel-”
“I’m listening.”
They quickly gave the man his burial rights, which was mostly done by the brothers while Cas took El and cared for her, a curious Jack close on his heels. Dean saw it right away, this look Cas got after receiving the memories from other Dean. It was the same look he got whenever Jack was in danger. The look of a worried father. The brothers had so many questions about the girl. And as soon as the body was taken care of they were ready for answers.
“Good.” he sighed, it was a relieved sound. “Not most people think that way. Case in point, the Novaks.”
“Cas, what’s going on?” she asked.
They were dressed in white tunics and slacks, and flower crowns on their heads. Peonies for a long happy relationship, forget-me-nots for true love, and violets for loyalty made for them by Rowena.
Sam and Eileen kept Jack with them and told him that his mom and dad just needed some time together. They were relieved however when Dean emerged from the third floor, looking blissed out and glowing like a newly made man.
“Dean-” she suddenly gasped, a broader smile coming to her face.
“Yes.” she nodded back, averting his gaze.
“Then what do you want me to do, Dean? We can’t stay here and I refuse to abandon her.”
“Well, Castiel,” she said coming around the kitchen island cabinets to see the boys. “I’ve heard a lot about you. Dean has talked about little else. But your pup…”
“Look, it’s blue like your eyes.” he said cheerily.
“Guys.” Sam called again louder.
“Sure.” Sam smiled. “Hey wait, how am I going to get back if your still here.”
“Like hell.” Cas snarled. “I don’t know what lies my parents fed you, but the father of my pup is my mate and I am not going anywhere with you.”
It didn’t take long for him to find an angel that wanted his head, or for him to take his grace. He came back with haste, only to find the apartment sans Castiel and the first blade- which he had foolishly left with the angel thinking her too week to do much.
She stopped in front of them, looking only at Dean.
“I’ll be right back.” he told them.
It was weeks later and the packs were more than ready for the celebration of Dean and Cas’s vow ceremony.
“I don’t bend.” Dean snapped. “I cherish my omega and the place they have in our pack. They are the caretakers and the calming balms to the aggressive alphas. They keep us balanced. If you can’t understand that, then it’s no wonder Cas ran away.”
Cas shot him a look that clearly asked if he was nuts.
“Well, you have time now right?”
“That sounds like him.” Cas smiled.
“Who cares, Micheal’s is in charge and the one who sent me to her, and after he mated with Adam he’s less of a douche than he used to be. If mother had her way I’d been mated to some Colonel Sanders looking assclown named Asmodeus.”
“What the hell was that?” Sam demanded knowing no one had an answer.
Hearing the omega raspy baritone, Dean could only smile before letting out his own breath.
“Not even if Ah can get rid ay th’ mark an’ protect yer wee one?” she sounded smug, he could just imagine the Cheshire grin spreading across her face.
“Stand back.” she warned.
“Will I see my daddy?” Jack asked.
“Okay, let’s give Crowley a call.” he shrugged, reaching for his phone at the same moment the bunker door opened.
“I am not abandoning her.”
“Stay here.” Dean told him and he began his march toward the omega.
The rising sun painted the horizon pink and orange against the blue mountains. Dean watched them and he went ninety down the highway heading for Pontiac Illinois. It was finally time.
“Fur th’ transfer, Ah need a willin’ host. Fur th’ sleep spell Ah’ll need a lot ay herbs fur such as weel as some yarrow an’ red rose petals. Fur th’ protection spell, Ah’ll need a lot ay herbs meant fur protection, same fur crystals, an’ an angel feather, an’ demon DNA an’ th’ babin herself.”
. And he was tired. There was nothing left to do but fight.
He only huffed and let go. Cas struggled for words. "Dean-I...you know I'd do anything for you, right? That I," he paused, they'd never said this before, "that I love you."
"Is it that I'm in a male vessel?"
"You were suppose to
Sam ran in, hair messed up. "What's going on?"
"So you get it?"
"He'll come around," he reasoned. Cas was disgusted with himself to see that hands hands were shaking. Dean was right. He
"No he hasn't," he defended. Deans just trying to work through things, but he couldn't tell Sam that. Quickly changing the subject, Cas brought up the case. "Did the families mention a man named Harold?"
"Because you've barely said two words to me since last night. I need to know what you want."
"Hm?"
"Yup," Dean said as he shoveled cereal into his mouth. Cas calmly ate his muffin, trying to keep the beam off his face. It seemed their talk had been reassuring for the hunter, which was good because he didn't know how much more avoidance he could take.
That was a lie. He was the exact same. Sam was just trying to prove that they didn't need Dean.
"Just-just shut up. We got work to do."
Dean didn't come back after a couple days. He didn't come back after a week.
"Uh, okay?"
An pale, punk rock looking man opening the door. "What do you want," he sniffed.
"About what."
They didn't talk about it. Cas shouldn't be surprised, they never talk about anything. At least now, they can have all the good moments in front of Sam. It didn't have to be so secretive. It was less tense.
, he made sure I knew. And the only other serious relationship I had was with Lisa, and look how that turned out."
Dean looked her up and down, and threw on a charming smile. "Hi, Clem. What do you suggest?"
"Don't you miss him? He's your brother."
Dean was only standing a few feet away, and glared at the two of them. None of them noticed Sam walk in.
Today, it seemed, was going to be a bad day. A simple trip and a spill kicked it all off.
Cas knew a lost cause when he saw one, so he didn't say anything. Dean adjusted his grip on his hand. Then, he sucked in a breathe, and moved to grab his wrist. "The fuck, Cas? Why didn't you wash this off?"
"Yeah. That was messed up."
“Do what,” he managed.
He couldn't help the tears that poured down his face. Dean never hurt him this bad before. He crouched down next to Cas, ignoring how he flinched.
"Why not," Sam yelled, "why are you defending him?"
"Tom-the man I was talking to, said they all got played by a man named Harold."
"No, I mean, don't call yourself a fag, Cas. Yeah, you're gay, but not a fag. And thank you for trusting me enough to tell me, but God, I'm going to beat the shit outta Dean for that."
It didn't escape their notice how his eyes widened slightly, and he shuffled so they couldn't see inside. He quickly recovered, and said, "Dude, it's like 11 at night. Can it wait?"
It stung. He quickly dropped his gaze and picked up his fork. They
It'd been three weeks since that night. Sam said he was doing better, and he tried to believe him, but he just seemed to be a burden to the younger Winchester. Of course, Sam never said that, but Cas could tell.
"Okay, you tried your way. I'm sorry it didn't work, but you have
"You two good?"
to be caught.
"What do you think Dean? You emotionally and physically abused him for months. He's better though. Better than when he was with you."
"Nothing. It's just-are you going to stop at that diner afterwards?"
"That's not true."
Neither of them allowed Sam to say anything else when they walked away in separate directions.
“Cas, if you don’t get it off your chest, you’ll never be able to breathe.”
"No, but it makes it understandable."
Deflect, deflect, deflect. "Why do you?"
"I'm sorry."
Cas shrugged, and he let Sam maneuver the sheets around them. "It's gonna be okay, Cas. This is a good step."
"It's okay. Dean was manipulating you, abusing you. It's his fault, not yours."
being close to Dean. Sam needed to get home. For now, he was trapped.
They slept in Cas' room that night.
"I don't either."
was the one who had every right to run, not you. And he's still here."
Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Really? When you turn into such a fucking crybaby."
They were full of light finger shaped bruises from whenever Dean would grab him. "Those were accidents."
"Dean,
He waved Cas off. "It's fine, help me up. We gotta burn these bitches."
"Is he coming back?" He both desperately wanted him to come back, but needed him to stay away.
"Fuck, Sam, I know! What was I suppose to do, stay there?"
He stood up and Cas automatically took a step back. "Wait a minute, Cas, are you-are you fucking
"Why do you punish yourself," Cas asked quietly, with closed eyes.
"Can I talk to him," Dean asked from behind the door. His voice sounded wrecked.
The whole ride Dean would steal glances at Cas in the backseat. Whenever he managed to catch his eye, he'd give a little smirk. Sometimes it infuriated Cas how much he loved him.
Castiel didn't expect their relationship (if did ever happen) to be perfect, but he certainly didn't expect it to be like this. It was so
"You don't have to be sorry. You didn't do anything wrong."
"FBI, we would like to speak with you about the recent disappearances. May we come in?"
But now, the bad moments happened behind closed doors. More often than not, Cas got himself kicked out of Deans room. He tried to explain himself to Dean, but he just didn't want to hear it.
"No, those aren't normal fights, man. He beats you up, and you just
Apparently keeping it between them meant that Dean ignored Cas in front of Sam. He understood, but he couldn't help the insecurity that crept in.
"What?"
"Wow. You're fucking pathetic. Just-I can't even look at you. Get out."
That's all it took for his brain to start working again. He mumbled a quick, "call if you need anything," and raced towards his car. He couldn't cry in front Dean. Dean hated that. So did he.
He didn't even see it coming. Cas' back hit the door hard. His hand flew up to his split cheek.
However, they had their good moments. Dean unconsciously shuffling in closer to him while sleeping. Or when he snuck smiles to him. Kicking each other in the shins under the table. Watching terrible westerns. Just enjoying each other's company.
Sam looked at Cas, desperately wanting him to say no, but he simply nodded his head. He finished up with the butterfly tape and left them alone.
"Cas," Dean said, raising his voice, "they're accidents.
, dummy. Of course I don't mean to do them."
It was a pattern. Every time they were intimate, the next morning Dean withdrew himself. It'd been happening all week. At the realization, tears brimmed his eyes.
It wasn't even about big things. It was the little ones tearing them apart. Once, Cas thought it was Deans turn to make dinner, but it was actually his, and he freaked out. He supposed it was entitled. Cas wasn't doing anything right, it seemed. He was trying to change. For Dean.
The next morning, when Dean sat next to him, Cas shot a glance towards Sam. The younger brother smiled at them.
"Cas, honey, I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened-I just...I'm sorry. I wasn't myself."
"The motel."
Cas nodded mutely as he shoved food around his plate. "I just...I thought it would be different. I thought he wanted it."
Sam grew still. He stared at his arms. Finally he asked, "where else?"
"It's not something you can fix," Sam sighed, "it's never going to be the same. But we can talk, and communicate, and work something out. Because I know I don't want to shut you out of my life, and neither does Cas, but we are both hurt and angry."
"No. Just making an observation."
——————
Despite it being the middle of the night, Cas marched into Sams room and shoved the phone under his nose. He watched Sams face flash with confusion, then understanding, then anger.
Deans smile faltered a little. "No way in hell I'm letting you drive Baby."
"What's that guys problem," he huffed.
"Sam," he said, trying to keep the panic of his face.
He put his hand on his arm, trying to provide some comfort. "It's not too late."
——————
"How can you love me? You
Cas went in for the hug, hoping it was okay. Thankfully, Dean fully reciprocated.
Deans face had crumpled when he realized what he'd done. "Cas, baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me. It was an accident."
Cas nodded. Both him and Dean seemed to finish their conversations at the same time. He was caught off guard when Dean snatched his hand and dragged him outside, with Sam closely following.
"Yeah, I talked with them. That's it though."
Dean looked mad. Cas was just waiting for him to the explode. It was inevitable. "You done telling me how much I make you unhappy? Maybe we should just end things."
"Why don't you want to tell Sam?"
in dark bruises. "I don't know when things got so bad," he whispered.
"I'm sorry."
"Don't be such a baby. I told you, it was an accident. You know I love you."
"Are you
"I went a couple times. Worked out some stuff. I'm trying Sammy. I really am."
"You better. A relationship means two people Cas. Two. Me and you. Am I not good enough for you?"
"Aw c'mon, Sammy. You're just jealous."
The vamps were slowly leaning in. One eyed Dean up and down and licked her lips. Sam gave the signal, and in a second, three of them had their heads cut off.
Maybe they could still play this off. Sam, Dean, and Cas all sat semi-near a vamp in case anything went down.
The remaining sprung into action. They were embarrassingly easy to kill. "Everyone okay," Sam asked, panting. Dean responded with a groan.
"Shit, man," Sam paused, making the connection in his head, "did Dean do that?"
"Dean, you know I wouldn't do that. It was a stupid mistake, yes, but I wouldn't purposefully forget the hex bag."
“You always smile like you’re about to cry.”
He was angry. Not a
"No. Are you?"
Sam was asleep in the backseat. Dean unashamedly held his hand in the front.
"He's-"
He sat down next to him on the bed, and took his hands. "Yeah, it was. Doesn't make it okay. Look, man, I gotta say something."
He was shaking, trying to hide how much he
"Yes I did," his voice broke, "
"Dean, I-"
"A chance? A fucking chance? Cas, you're on chance fucking ten."
"What?"
"Alright, found a case, only about 3 hours away. Looking like vamps. Four victims, all have two puncture wounds."
"Bye."
There it was.
The car swerved a little, and Cas watched his hands get tighter around the wheel. "Wow. That what you think of me? Do you even listen to me? I told I wasn't ready. Sam can't know."
"Is it true you talked with all the victims? Did they say anything about meeting anyone?"
"No, Dean, I just didn't kno-"
He took off his shirt at the same, slow pace. Now that he was looking, Cas realized he was
. How can you stand it?"
you. When he was angry, he shouldn't of been. And when he wasn't, he was clingy, jealous, and over protective. Everyone needs space from that."
"Oh, I forgot. We went right from the bar to Harolds."
A part of him knew he didn't deserve to get hit, or kicked, or punched. He knew that was wrong. In any other case, he'd do exactly what Sam had done.
," Sam hissed, "relax, dude. It's just a mug."
"That jealous, trying to get some action? I didn't know you were such a fucking faggot."
"Dean?"
"Cas, I'm worried. I hear you two fighting all the time."
Sam sat up. "It's me. Where the hell have you been? Do you not know how to answer your phone?"
"What? Cas, no.
Dean was allowing him to come back. That was good. So why did he still hurt?
Dean stared at him with wide eyes. "I love you," he repeated, more confidently. Tears brimmed his eyes. It broke Cas' heart how little Dean got to hear that.
"I, just, you know that was wrong, right?"
Dean was-oh. Dean was flirting. A bitter feeling filled his chest. He knew he was just doing this to keep Sam out of the loop. Well, he hoped that's what he was doing.
Cas swallowed, "We need to talk."
A painstakingly slow 7 minutes went by when they finally heard the bunker door close. Cas had gotten his breathing under control. He got up as quietly as he could and slipped out Deans door.
"Good. That's what I want, but um," he paused, fiddling with his beer cap, "lets keep this between us for now."
Cas simply shook his head. "I have to try."
"The fuck was that, Cas?"
His eyes narrowed, but he stepped aside. There were five other people lounging on the couches, all staring at them with a unmistakable glint in their eyes.
Cas couldn't talk. He didn't mean...he was just angry. Dean stared him down. "Guys," Sam warned, feeling the tension radiating off of both of them.
"I dunno, part of it? My dad was a stubborn son of a bitch, and he had, uh,
Cas' head was throbbing when he woke. He was on his bed, but he didn't remember moving there from the door.
“Hold it in.”
Cas immediately tensed. He was going to end things.
Cas desperately tried to control his breathing as Sam yelled at his brother. Eventually, Dean stormed off to the Impala and raced away. He hadn't caught a single word they said.
"Yeah, well, nevertheless, they need to stop."
Cas tried not to flinch when Dean pulled his arm, signaling for Sam to go ahead.
His phone rang again. He went to hit decline, but paused when he saw Dean instead of Sam.
to let me take care of this."
"Are you fucking kidding me," he yelled at no one. Though Cas was getting better, his heart still raced whenever anyone raised their voice. "Shit, sorry Cas," he said when he saw his friend shrink away, "but two months, no contact, and this is all he says? Fuck, at least he got one thing right, you deserve an explanation. Shit, so do I. I'm gonna kill him. Try calling him, maybe he'll answer this time."
Instead, he sat next to a man on the corner barstool. He looked like he'd be a frequent, maybe he could get something out of him.
"I could drive. I'm not tired."
"It's okay, Dean. It was an accident."
He didn't feel like answering. "Deans staying in a motel for a little while."
"No, that's not your fault. It's hard to see it in the moment."
A knock came from the other side of the door. "Guys, it's late. Go to sleep."
"Cas, you okay," Sam asked, tugging on his suit sleeve.
He finally broke away. "Cas, I can't- I don't..."
They were both quiet for a long time. Cas pondered the question, trying to choose the right way to answer.
The previous night, they'd finally taken a step forward in their relationship. Intercourse. But when he'd awoken, Dean wasn't there. And now he hadn't even said a word to him. So, yes, Cas was hurt.
"Some of it is my fault," he argued, "I did make Dean angry. Sometimes I purposely made him mad to get space."
"Well, I told him that he'd been abusing you."
His breaths were coming in short little pants. "And now, I ruined it. Now he's mad at you too because of me. I'm sorry-I'm so sorry."
Cas. I know you don't want me to do this, but I have to. I can't watch this. It's already been going on for months."
He never knew what to respond with.
Cas quickly tightened his jaw, and forced the tears away. Sams eyes blew wide at the interaction. He smacked Dean in the arm. "What the hell has been going on between you two?
"I'm so so sorry. Let me get you ice."
"How many times to I have to apologize? I'm sorry. You deserve better, and I'm
"You gonna keep staring, or you gonna eat?"
He heard Sam audibly gasp. "Cas, no you aren't. Don't call yourself that."
"And," Sam continued, "well, he got pretty angry. I wouldn't let him see you. Told him to go cool off somewhere for the next couple days and really think about your guys' relationship."
Cas traced his freckles. "Hm. I suppose not."
"When we get back, I'm gonna need to sleep for three days," he joked.
"Where's Sam?"
"How am I suppose to trust you? All you've ever done is go behind my back!"
"Fuck. Is he-is he okay?"
When he twisted his wrist the wrong way, he knew it was an accident. When Dean pushed him off the bed, it was an accident. When Dean kicked him in the stomach, it was an accident. When he busted Cas' lip, it was an accident.
When he finally caught up, Dean was already asking for the manager of the bar. He waved him off when he started to walk over.
"Um, of course not," he lied. He knew Dean knew he was lying.
Unconsciously, he leaned into it, but pulled back. "No, Dean, we need to talk."
Dean raised his fist and he flinched back, hiding his face with his hands. But the hit never came.
He would've never done the things Dean to him. How could he thoughtlessly throw out a friendship of six years? After everything they went through, and a relationship was the thing that tore them apart?
He made him angry again. Dean shoved him a little too hard, forcing the air out of his lungs. Immediately, he showered him with
Cas' mouth dropped open along with Sams. He hadn't even realized that Tom was flirting with him. Surely Dean didn't think that, surely Dean didn't mean what he just...
He tried to keep his sour mood to himself, but couldn't help the frown when Dean pocketed the napkin Clem left her number on.
"So..."
"That doesn't make it okay!"
"Okay. I can do that."
Sam opened and closed his mouth a few times. He ran a hand through his hair. "Actually, yeah. Why?"
He turned, and took off his headphones. "Hey."
"Not really in the mood for you, Cas."
"The families said they all talked to him too."
. It seemed Cas didn't listen well enough to Dean.
He reread twelve times. Two months. Cas had been waiting for two months.
"So we find Harold. I'll go call Dean, since you uh, since...I'll just call Dean."
Was it abuse? He knew that relationships don't fall apart because of one person, so he must've been doing something too.
"Um. Yes. Where did he go?"
"Honey, you okay? I'll make it up to you," he said as he rubbed his back, "you gotta breathe. That's it, just breathe."
because it's
"That's not-he wasn't..."
Sam sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "We talked about this, you have nothing to be sorry about. I'll tell you as many times as I need to until it sticks."
He yanked Cas' arm away from the freezer door before he could reach. "I'll get it myself, thanks. You've done enough."
She returned the smile, and placed a hand on his shoulder while pointing out various things on the menu. Sam shook his head.
of me?"
"Trust me, he did want it. Some things just don't work out."
He had to draw the line somewhere. Dean watched him gasp for air across the room. Cas held his neck in his hands. His throat was on
They listened to Deans heavy breathing. "I thought," he continued, "that I would give you two some space."
They'd gone a full week without fighting. Cas had never felt happier. Occasionally, he could see Deans upper lip curl, and expect to get yelled at, be he always gained control. But good things never last forever.
Sam looked over at Cas. He had his eyes squeezed shut, and was slightly rocking himself. "I don't think that's a good idea," he said, still staring at Cas.
"Cas, they're accidents. You know I can't help it."
"Us. I'm not happy in our relationship right now, but I want to work through it."
"I'm not assuming anything."
His heart swelled at the pet name. Cas squeezed his hand and smiled. "Just talk to me next time, Dean. And I'm sorry, too."
"Oh. That's...that's great Dean. I'm proud of you."
Even though Dean didn't look happy, at least he closed his laptop. "If you regret what we did,  just tell me. We can figure out how to rework our relationship."
He was going to lose Dean. Dean was going to hate him.
He simply pulled Sam closer and, for once, rest came easy.
It was after hours, and the two laid close together on Deans bed. He'd apologized to Cas earlier. He sighed, "I'm just not ready. This is...scary."
"Funny way of showing it."
Dean swallowed thickly, and looked away. "I mean, you know everything I've ever done. You know my personality. You know
Cas was trying to breathe through his panic. The yelling was so familiar. He thought he was ready.
He sounded excited. A ghost of a smile played on Cas' lips. Deans deserved to be excited, but what about this morning? "What?"
He sighed and rubbed Cas' arm, where the bruises were healing. "I know. It'll get better."
"Just go away, Cas."
He held it all in. It wasn’t allowed, not to him, to let it be free. Cas had to be good, had to get it right, to make up for it. To make up for the fact that he exists.
They both rushed over, but only found a large bruise forming on his jaw. "Damn, Cas. Sometimes I wish you were still an angel."
"It was an accident," he repeated.
Dean sat next so Sam. The younger Winchester cast confused glances between the two. Dean never sat there.
"I dunno, Cas. What do you want?"
"Nothing, Sam," Cas said softly.
He slammed the door, and Cas slowly followed, trying to understand what had just happened.
"No, no, I know. I just-you were right. I fucked up. I hurt him so bad Sammy, I don't-"
pathetic. And stupid. A fag. Useless. Dean had always been right.
"Did you go to the therapist?"
"And I choose to love you anyway."
to talk about things. They both said it was what they wanted. So why was Dean pushing him away?
"Um, we shouldn't be fighting as much as we do. That's on both of us. We need to talk through things."
"What? I am."
"No," he huffed, "wanna stay here tonight?"
"What can I get started for you boys?"
"How do I fix this?"
"Dean, wait a minute, of course I care," Cas rushed, trying to keep up with him.
There was no more big bad to defeat. That life was over. They
Sam set down his fork and thought about it. "I think I'm too mad to miss him. Do you?"
A few minutes later, he heard yelling from down the hall. He couldn't bring himself to listen.
"So your father was homophobic. If it makes you feel any better, God is indifferent. Love is love. And Lisa...well, I'm not her. What happened with her wasn't fair to anyone involved."
"Dean, I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you?"
It stung knowing the only time Dean said I love you is when he accidentally hurt him.
"Why would I regret it," he said angrily.
"What do I say?" He hated how scared he sounded. Sam scanned his face, then shook his head. "I'll talk to him. But we gotta use your phone."
"Ah, good folks. Stupid, but good folks."
Cas couldn't syke himself up enough to answer Sams calls. He'd been sitting in the same parking lot for four hours. Dean needed space. Cas knew that. He just pushed him too far that morning.
"Yeah, real naive. Young, too. They all had big dreams of getting outta this town. They actually believed Harold when he said he was recruiting for Hollywood. Harolds the big fraud, if you didn't know ."
"You have very nice eyes," Cas blurted before he could stop himself. They were pools of green.
Sam glared at Dean as they knocked at the door. They all had a machete uncomfortably stowed in their suit jackets.
Sam tried to protest as he pushed away. "Cas, that's not going to work. I know you want it to work, but things don't happen that way."
was ruining their family.
That almost broke the wall. Almost made him release the ache pounding at his heart.
"O-okay?"
He silently winced when Dean didn't let up on his arm. "Dean, I'm going to wash it off as soon as we get home," he said, trying to keep him calm.
Cas didn't have to be told twice. Sam was waiting right outside. His face was plastered in unmistakable rage as they walked back to Cas' room.
It was hard holding his place. "Then try harder to make them stop."
Sam eyed him sadly. He took Cas' arms and turned them. "Then what are these?"
"I should go talk to him."
"I'm not tired of you Dean. I love you-"
Cas' brow furrowed. It was. He'd made Dean angry. Yes, sure, that was completely and utterly offensive, but he'd accidentally pushed Deans insecurities right in front of him by talking to Tom. And the outburst was because of John. "I should go apologize."
It felt to Castiel that the Earth was still at this hour, blanketed in a dusting of white frost that crunched under his leather work boots.
The box would be empty
“Did you know that I’m in love with you?” So it was out, slipping from his lips easily and washing over the both of them like anointed oil. There was no more heaviness in the air, now it was too light and made Cas’ heart beat quick, as if it were trying to escape his ribcage, run from the finality of what he had confessed.
Dean was receptive to the physical affection, they had always had a poor concept of personal space. Dean let him brush their shoulders together and linger in hugs and would even lean into him when Cas would sit too close during movie nights at the bunker in an old-time theater room they had discovered in the basement. He didn’t seem to mind Cas borrowing his flannels or sweatpants and didn’t protest when Cas started doing little things for him. Once he felt he had mastered brewing coffee using Sam as a semi unwilling taste tester, he would wake up early and make Dean a cup before he got up. He would wash his laundry with his own and insisted on dressing a wound on Dean’s back after a ghost hunt when Dean struggled to reach it. Everytime Dean seemed either amused or grateful or some endearing mixture of both, all positives in Cas’ mind and each time he made Dean happy it was like a cooling balm to the burning in his chest.
“Cas, do you have a minute?” Oh how his name sounded in Dean’s mouth. He wished to lap it up off his lips.
If I had a box just for wishes
‘Cause I love you
Except for the memory
It was a need now, now Cas was alive with a beating heart and animal desires. The trouble was that he didn’t know how to start.
If I could save time in a bottle
“It’s time to stop. The world isn’t ours to save anymore.” They both understood that he meant Sam as well, who had slowed on taking cases considerably and now mostly assisted other hunters with research and was learning more about magic (with much apprehension and some disapproval from Dean).
Cas wrapped his arms around the other man’s middle and kissed the bridge of his nose and then once lightly on the lips. “Yes.” He said, and Dean hummed and held Cas around his shoulders. His beard brushed over the side of Cas’ face as he leaned down to rest his cheek on his shoulder as he often did, nuzzling him like a happy cat.
He had already known that he loved Dean. He had felt it the moment he first glanced mangled soul still steadfastly holding to goodness. From when he touched its divine light that stung with deepest pain and bursting love with a core that somehow held the remains of an innocence most souls abandoned with childhood. Then he hadn’t known it was love, and it took some time after. The realization had trickled in and settled without much protest, into the most intrinsic part of his being. Dean had marked him also, the righteous man with his fierce efficiency and quick tongue and tender, tender heart that let so much out but so little in.
