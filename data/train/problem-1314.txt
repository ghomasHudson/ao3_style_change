The reminder of cool metal against his skin was like a balm, and he took any opportunity to forget his shame. He pulled his hands away and examined it, that little silver snake encircling his finger. How such things ever came to be, he didn't understand, how one could so desperately dread something, and yet find themselves content in the same proposition.
“I’d, I’d like it to be more, sir,” He said a little louder, blushing furiously. Good God in Heaven, he was so innocent. Sweet little kitten. “Can, we go home, sir?”
"Let the nice lady help you, darling," Sherlock looked up at John and begrudgingly handed her the cases. She gave him a plastic smile and took them, her shoes clacking fast and hard as she walked to the side of the plane and gave them to a boy who was loading things inside. A few other passengers were arriving, and Sherlock subconsciously stepped closer to John. The flight attendant returned and took their tickets.
"What is it, John?" Sherlock rubbed his eyes, standing and approaching to read it himself, his heart tight and his throat itchy. John shook his head and put the letter on his desk.
“Nah, I just brought chips.” Ross laughed audibly and caught both their gazes before blushing again and licking his lips. Strange smiled slyly. Ross had no idea how those two would have met before but the subject didn’t come up. Soon the two Americans were alone again as Nakia made the rounds. Suddenly, the red cape that this man wore moved, the corner of it coming and delicately wrapping around Ross’s wrist in a kind gesture of sorts. He stuttered and looked up at Strange. He gave an apologetic smile before batting the edge of his cape down and shushing it... um, that was weird.
"Sherlock! What the hell are you doing?!" Mycroft shouted as he stepped out onto the gravel, towards the garage to arrange a car for Greggory. His incorragable little brother was filthy, rosy cheeks smeared with some inky substance (petrol?), galoshes thickly stained with sodden dirt, curls caked in mud. A pair of icy sharp blue eyes looked up with that sweet smile of old days. Sherlock waved from across the drive, laughing with the chauffer. The wonders of the internal combustion engine were
does “call upon” mean? He can’t really mean it, daddy! I hate them! They hate me! I won’t do it!” Sherlock shouted, eyes welling with tears and hands balled into fists.
"You aright there, princess?" John rubbed his hand up and down along Sherlock's bare back, and Sherlock nodded mutely. The afternoon sun glimmered in the water and John grinned, pulling Sherlock along, who stopped at the edge, eyes transfixed by the water, which crawled up the sand, barely gracing each toe before retreating. There weren't many people out, just the family and a few stragglers in beach chairs.
"Hoo hoo," A head popped in through the door, "You two have a little domestic?" Sherlock shrugged his shoulder and Mrs. H sighed.
He stood there for a while, and when he finally turned and burried his face into the crook of the old woman's neck, she cooed and pet his hair.
He rubbed his hand along it, suddenly his heart racing. He wasn't sure. He wouldn't be sure for weeks, and only then, he'd need a doctor to examine his...he shuddered, crossing his legs and adjusting the lenses.
"Of course I do John, still have a few frames on this roll too, then I'll develop some of them, I'm not exactly sure how to go about it but the chemistry can hardly be too difficult,"
"We are poised to go to war, Sherlock, and we will. I say we have another six months at the most. And I'm never wrong."
For some reason it made him want to wrap himself inside of it and never come out again. But he couldn't do that. Not when he was in an Alpha's bedroom, with the same Alpha downstairs, about to come upstairs, about to mate with him. His omega screamed at him to strip, position himself submissively, wait patiently, beg for it. He only wanted to cry some more. He heard footsteps and scuffling below, so he hurriedly pulled the syringe from his pocket, pulling off his trousers. He quickly drew up the clear fluid into it, squirting a bit out the top to release any air bubbles. He knew how to do this. He swallowed, eyes damp, and jammed the needle into his thigh, biting on his lip to keep from crying. He quickly deposited the needle and vial into the bedside table drawer, crawling into the center of the bed and hugging his knees. He closed his eyes and waited.
"Amen, Mrs. H," John smiled, leaning on the top of the refrigerator. She cooed and planted a kiss on his cheek.
“Well, your order, vegetarian, but there are lots of reasons people don’t eat meat- you’re a doctor, maybe it’s your health, but no, every time the waiter comes by with meat, you look slightly angry, your good shoulder tenses up and your pupils contract. So, moral reasons. But rack of lamb puts you sad, not angry, as if you’re sentimentally attached. Not a farm boy, otherwise the killing may not bother you. No, most likely summer home, plus your car, heirloom, there’s an old insurance card under the passenger seat. Watson. But it’s too old to be you, maybe a brother, but what living man would give away that car?
"Sassy now, I like it," John mumbled with a delirious smile, and Sherlock realized he was losing blood, gasping and pressing fingers into his shoulder, his husband hissing at the pressure.
The sweet whispers of the morning fog had began to dissipate, a slight mist still resting on Sherlock's cheeks, his hair beginning to frizzle at the moisture. The curving green hills of the estate went on for miles in every direction, and from his spot on the iron swing, he could see the little brook where he used to play. The tall Lebanon Cedar trees that swayed in the early winds, memories of attempts to climb them, and the skinned knees and elbows as a result. Sherlock Holmes would not cry. It was only transport. He wouldn't be some blubbering omega, who snapped at the slightest wind.
. Perhaps he thought Sherlock was on the run from a vicious bondmate, it wasn't uncommon. Runaway omegas if discovered would be returned to their Alphas, but plenty of people disagreed with the practice. Fuck your sympathy, Sherlock wanted to growl. Turing spoke as if he had any right to try and understand him, when he certainly did
Pale moonlight shone across his skin, every mark and tiny scar glowing with a heavenly colour of gold. His chest rose and fell solidly, steadily, that's what John was. Steady. Strong. Constant. Home. Sherlock's eyes flickered over him, memorizing him. This was
"Seventeen," Alan shook his head with a incredulous smile, "And people call me a genius. I just can't understand the concealment,"
"Oh my, let's sit him down," Another woman's voice. Sherlock blinked a few times to clear the haze, a nurse. She guided him to the steps by the portside door and sat him down on them, a cup of tea put between his trembling fingers, watching as the liquid sloshed, the ship creaking this way and that, his breaths shallow and weak.
“S’okay daddy,” Sherlock’s cheeks flushed as John wiped his tears with the pad of his thumb. John pulled his boy into a hug and Sherlock melted at the touch, leaning his cheek on John’s shoulder, no doubt leaving a trail of tears and snot where he lay. John didn’t mind. He placed an arm under Sherlock’s bum and pulled him up onto his hip, bouncing ever so slightly. For being in his early forties, John was incredibly strong, and Sherlock was delicately light. Sherlock was limp in his arms, so exhausted from his ordeal. John shook his head. They hadn’t eaten dinner, but Sherlock was already asleep. Big breakfast tomorrow then.
"I am so so sorry, Esther," Sherlock whispered, throat constricting, heart heavy in his chest, "I should have- I should have done something, I should have fought for you, I am sorry," His eyes were blurry with heavy tears, and he reached down to grasp her hand, which was horribly cold. "I'm proud of you, Esther,
Sherlock was passed out and tucked into bed, hydrated and cleaned up when the phone rang. John glared to the sitting room as he sat on Sherlock's bed watching him to make sure he was okay. He grumbled before stomping over to the phone and picking it up in a huff, angry and protective of Sherlock's much needed rest.
"Tsk, military secrets, darling," John tutted and Sherlock blushed, wrapping his arms around his bony, pale knees. "Now, be a good lad and fetch that camera,"
"Got it," He gasped, fingers grazing a bullet, metal still hot against his fingertips. He gently pulled it between his fingers, John making inhuman noises in pain, and wiggled it free, pulling it out and gasping at it in his palm.
John's chest rumbled as he grasped his omega by the waist and flipped them over, muscular thighs trapping Sherlock like prey, palms on his wrists, eyes glimmering with lust and anger at Mycroft for saying such a thing. Sherlock's lips turned into a dizzy smile, eyelashes fluttering at his strong Alpha, such a good Alpha, so protective and good.
The instructor was an old alpha, with a thick gray beard and a dusty pink nose. He looked like the last thing he wanted to do was teach omegas. Going by the clear signs of alcoholism, and his distaste for his profession, he clearly used to be a real professor, but certain chemical reactions cannot be denied.
Sherlock turned around, the distance between them feeling like a million miles instead of a metre. His eyes were lined with fresh tears, and John's heart sank. Sherlock bit his lip before crawling across the floor on wobbly hands and knees and falling into John's shoulder, the Alpha instantly wrapping arms around his shivering form.
“Are you still cross with me Jawn?” Sherlock whispered, eyes welled with tears. John only shushed him with a stroke across his flank as he adjusted them so that Sherlock was in his lap again, head thrown back over his shoulder.
“Sherlock, I know you’re too smart to keep working here. You’re a genius, you should be at MIT or something, but you’re WAY too smart to just be some old guy’s sugar baby, arm candy. He’ll probably make you stop working, maybe even quit school. I really don’t think you should go down this road.”
"Oh, please, more, Jawn, please," The omega sobbed, his eyes full of tears, teeth pressing on his bottom lip. John growled and obliged, stretching and scissoring his fingers before adding a third, just to be on the safe side, working the already fluttering hole open.
"You knew, and you still did those fucking experiments?" Sherlock wept, his shoulders shuddering, his fingers still tight around John's rolled up sleeves.
"Well, I didn't think it'd be that hard!" Sherlock growled, sinking under the water like a hippo, eyes over the water. A single inky curled was plastered to his forehead.
"Still a bit dizzy," He mumbled, cheeks flaring in shame. His eyes flicked over to the bedside table. John tutted and turned his chin to face him, pulling the boy around and looking at him intently.
"I'm frightfully older than you, that's for sure. But really, Sherlock, I-" John paused, his chest tightening and his left hand trembling horribly. The hand he used to hit Sherlock. The memory sent shivers throughout his body. "Yeah, no, I don't think I'm ready."
An omega stood on the platform excitedly as the train pulled in, a cloud steam around her ankles, her tummy large under her dress. She stood on the toes of her kitten heels, and she clutched her handbag with one hand, cupping the top of her stomach with the other, watching as each  went by. When the train stopped, a tall blond man leapt out of the carriage and rushed over to her, hands resting on the sides of her stomach as he pulled her in for a kiss, fingers brushing through her caramel brown hair, pulling back and grinning before talking to her stomach.
He groaned, head thrown back as he picked up the pace, the omegas name feeling holy on his tongue. Sherlock whined, eyes clenched tight, drenched curls flapping against his forehead as he rut himself against the sheets with each punishing thrust.
“I’ve known you for eternity too, Evie, I’ve loved you forever.” Stephen bent down slowly, gently placing his hands on the nape of the shorter man's neck, pressing tenderly, his breath shallow. He pressed his mouth against his Chosen’s, sucking softly at Everett’s bottom lip. Everett responded immediately, pushing forward, pressing his tongue into Strange's mouth, tasting something spicy like cinnamon. He pulled back and leant his forehead against Stephens and whispered,
"He's uh- he's ill, I can tell him you called," John shifted on his hips and adjusted the mouthpiece under his chin, pulling the cord and moving to the kitchen to make Sherlock some tea.
"I promise," John smiled as Sherlock nodded, leaning back again, the army doctor's strong hands beneath him. "Let go, Sherlock.
"Oh that's trite. Grow up, Sherlock," John pulled his coat over his shoulders and Sherlock scowled, flopping into an armchair.
"Doctor Watson!" Came the shout from the other side of the room as a solider was carried in, losing blood by the minute. John ran his fingers through his hair and stepped over a dozen gurneys to reach his destination.
Sherlock let the familiar faces of his unit haze by him, nodding with a weak smile as the girls embraced him one by one. Their sweet friendly scents and kind eyes did nothing to ease him, this cruel twisting thing inside of him. Debased, inhuman, a monster.
Once free of John's vice like grip, the omega's life preserver tugged him upwards, and he punched the surface of the water, slapping at the film of ink and creating a pocket, lifting his head above only to scream, his skin shrieking at the heat, blaring, blistering heat, all around him, the air so thick with smoke he could barely get oxygen, and he dove back under, his body filled with otherworldly strength, both him and John pumping their legs to find a place to get above.
"Right. Well. Gregory's liable to be awake soon, he's taken his day off to be with you. Try to be nice." Mycroft stood, wiping the wrinkles from his trousers and retrieving his umbrella from the foot of the bed. He turned the doorknob and made to leave.
John crawled downwards to nuzzle at Sherlock's tiny little cock, which was purple and dripping with clear fluid. But the sweet smell of his creaming hole was mouthwatering. He slurped at a tiny little drizzle that crawled down Sherlock's inner thigh, the sweet and salty taste on his tongue was magnificent. So perfect. His perfect omega. John's thumbs brushed across Sherlock's thighs as he worked him open with his tongue, and he placed gentle kisses to the fading white scars there. Beautiful. Sherlock was beautiful.
Watson was ignoring the cigar-invested conversation of the group he was standing with, transfixed by the creature in the corner. It was his birthday, but he looked like he'd rather be dead then be here with a bunch of old toffs. John couldn't agree more. He swallowed a last sip of whiskey and excused himself, giving himself a bit of a pep talk before approaching him.
"fifteen," Sherlock mumbled, pressing further into John, squeezing the older man with his legs. John clenched his jaw, his teeth grinding.
"Go?" Sherlock's eyes were wide, saucers, as she seethed at him. He didn't understand. If she was hurt, wouldn't she want help? Greg pulled Emilia from Sherlock's arms and placed her in the highchair at the dining table, which upset her terribly, and she let out another screeching wail, tears streaming down her face, reaching back for Sherlock.
"What is there to do about it, Sherlock?" John said plainly, reaching out to tuck a single dark lock behind his husband's ear. Sherlock sat back even further, shaking his head and pushing John away.
"You really are something, Sherlock." Esther shook her head. "Alright, I think we've got him clean enough for you to handle," She pat a sudsy pale shoulder and stood, straightening her apron and collecting some things off the bathroom vanity. Sherlock began to wash his own hair. "Her ladyship said you've got a suitor, huh?" Esther smirked, leaning aginst the vanity and giving Sherlock the eye.
"I- I can help with your hair?" Clara said meekly, giving his wild mess of hair a sideways look, to which Sherlock snorted and fluffed it up even more. "Curls can be tricky," She smiled, and Sherlock returned it. His insides glowed with something he'd almost forgotten. A...friend?
“He’ll be fine. Actually Lestrade, if you’re not busy, you should come over to Baker Street tomorrow, I have a feeling Sherlock will want to apologize by then.” Lestrade cocked his head inquisitively.
," He grasped his fingers on John's ears and pressed himself forward, devouring his alpha's lips with lithe elegance, sucking on the chapped and broken skin like it was his lifeline. John hummed beneath him, fingers carding through Sherlock's curls, grasping as if he might lose him again.
"Je t'ai apporté le petit déjeuner," (I brought breakfast for you) She handed him a tray, and he politely nodded.
"Enigma!" Mycroft hissed, nibbling at his lip once it had been said. Sherlock furrowed his brows and drew the phone to his ear once more, his interest very much rekindled.
"I've decided not to be an omega anymore." He announced, stomping a little foot on the floor in a gesture of seriousness. Mycroft bit back a chuckle and cocked an eyebrow at this silly proclamation.
wanted me to be. Wanted to tame me, saddle me, force me into your broodmare. I have no control over my own body! And I hate it!
"Time to meet your uncle John, Emelia," Sherlock nodded at John who held his arms out, Emelia fussing at the new smell, letting out a little squeak.
After an hour or so, John excused them both, putting his arm around his shy mate, who'd barely spoken a word the whole time, leading him back up the creaking stairs.
"Sod this, I can't- I can't deal with any of this," John growled, teeth snarling as he put on his hat and gave the solicitor a withering glare. "Good day, sir,"
"Good luck," Mycroft whispered, and Greg smiled wide before standing up, straightening his tie and brushing down the front of his morning coat, giving his husband a wink.
“Everyone be quiet, she’s coming!” The hotel room key beeped and she stepped into the apartment and everyone shouted.
"Thank you for inviting us, Mrs. Hudson, you didn't have to," Gregory said, sipping his drink and taking a seat in Sherlock's armchair, a sweet smile on his face. Mrs. H grinned and pat his knee.
and Sherlock nodded, not minding the worried whispers of the stretcher carriers, following the Captain to the parked vehicle, which was acting partially as cover, and while the large red cross painted on it's canvas should have brought comfort, it did not. The stretcher carriers loaded themselves into the back Sherlock steadied his breath and pulled himself up into the drivers seat, the engine roaring to life as Moran joined him, riffle slung over his shoulder. Sherlock eyed the revolver on his belt, pushing in the clutch and driving through the empty street and past the sandbag walls, his heart racing with each roll of the tyres.
He hadn't told Mummy. She wouldn't have approved of them going to the doctor for this. A shameful, sacrilegious act- if anyone found out, if the rumors got out even before Sherlock's first courtiers caught whiff- he'd be ruined, the family would be ruined, and everyone could gloat about the young Alpha who'd let his entire family down because he couldn't control his disgraceful baby brother.
Sherlock let himself get lost in repetitive work. Often he could just let himself slip into his mind palace and come out again with the entire kitchen floor polished. He shook his head, knees burried in the damp dirt of the tiny garden, grass barely stirring in a soft breeze. Car horns and sirens and dogs barking all drifted away, but his mind palace was solidly locked.
"No, Sherlock, god, it's fine, I'll have to tell you anyway, fuck," John growled, and Sherlock's nostrils flared. John was upset, and it was upsetting Sherlock, his knees weak and his heart racing.
"Oh, yes, I forgot, tell me again about my hormonal, hysterical mind and weakened intellect, you disgusting paperweight." Sherlock leapt and shoved Mycroft to the floor, who growled and flipped them over, pining Sherlock by the wrists, his breath foul and hot on Sherlock's skin. Sherlock bared his teeth, relishing his freedom, now that Mycroft had no claim, he held nothing back, sharply kneeing him between the legs and freeing his hands as Mycroft cringed. He pushed the butt of his hand to Mycroft's nose, the Alpha yelping and crawling backwards off of him, blood dribbling down his lip. Sherlock grinned and scrambled to his feet, his entire body glowing with defensive power.
"Bye John!" John slung the phone back in it's cradle and set about taking care of the whistling kettle and a very ill omega. His left hand twitched like mad, and he bit his lip hard to keep out the growl inside of him. He was a doctor, he knew that Sherlock could only be about a month along...but still, his child was gone. He might not want children yet, but he sure as hell didn't want this.
"Come on, love, let's have tea, I'm thirsty," John panted, pulling his black coat on and straightening his shirt before fluffing his hair. Sherlock grinned mischievously and pulled his jacket over his shoulders, buttoning it like he hadn't just gobbled his flatmate off in a supply closet.
Sherlock was now facing a much larger problem than his flatmate, brother, and a stranger seeing his naked arse. No,
“Oh no, of course not.” Sherlock sighed in relief before squishing his face into the pillow. “Sleep well, Sherlock,” He kissed his baby’s forehead and brushed away his sweaty curls.
"Right, well, I'm coming in now," John paused, waiting for a reply, receiving none. He turned the knob and pushed the door forward, feeling a lumpy resistance in the way. He pushed it far enough to poke his head through the opening, eyes widening at what he found. Sherlock lay on the ground, groaning, covered in sweat. His skin was ghastly and his hair hung in sweaty patches around his face.
"Oh, right. My tutor was an imbecile, I learned it in weeks, but he continued to drill me with irregular verbs for months, it's not something I'm liable to forget." John only growled, nibbling on the edges of his ear.
"Happy birthday, sweetheart," He sneered, giving Greg a sideways territorial glare. Greg only rolled his eyes. Typical Alphas. "dance with me." Sherlock opened his mouth to say no, but Greg raised an eyebrow, as if to say
"Just here," John pointed to the turn, but Sherlock was so out of it, all he could think about was the itchy burn of his sweaty blanket sticking to his back and his neck. He whined and tried to tug it off, but John tutted and kept it around him. "We're almost there, Sherlock, just relax," John had to admit, he needed to relax as well. His Alpha was going insane.
"Oh come on, I can smell a bonded omega any day," Sherlock nodded and rubbed a spot on the ground with his toe before a warm hand found it's way on his shoulder. "Most people aren't familiar with a male omega scent, and I won't say anything if you don't want me to."
"He wouldn't be in any danger, I just want him to take a look, I'll have him back in one piece, I promise, John,"
"Thought we might pack up your stuff today, that way it's already at John's when you guys come home from holiday," Sherlock scrunched his eyebrows at that and flopped his head the other direction, knees tucked up under his armpits. Greg only smiled and rubbed a hand across his shoulders. "Don't get too excited," Sherlock smirked and sat up a bit.
The room filled with silence that felt like ice on Mycroft's skin. Silly man, an unprecedented anti cyclone, along with frigid temperatures. That's why it was so cold.
"Never change, Sherlock," She smiled and turned to leave, the solid oak door closing gently behind her. Sherlock stared at his own reflection.
"Letter for you, Sherlock," Mycroft said smoothly, almost guileful as he flicked through his paper. Gregory sat beside him, tucking in to a plateful of breakfast, giving Sherlock
"I saw you put something in his drink!" Greg cried, looking to Mycroft desperately. "he's lyin', I swear!"
She cried, jumping from her chair and rushing to meet them. Sherlock barely moved as she grabbed him by the face and pressed a kiss to each cheek. "Le garçon sur les photos! Sherlock!" (
Sherlock let out a whispery exhale, the cool plastic bulbs pressing marks into his arms and torso, as daddy circled the strand around him expertly, leaving him trussed and helpless. The glow of the lights shadowed his cheekbones and nose. Daddy tucked his hair behind his ears when he was finished. He wrapped a silky green ribbon around Sherlock’s neck with a flowery bow, just a little bit tighter than necessary, Sherlock's breathing hitched ever so slightly.
“You like animals, sir,” Sherlock mumbled, “Your family estate has sheep,” John chuckled and smiled. Sherlock looked almost, scared, nervous that he’d said his deductions out loud.
"Sherlock? Sherlock are you up yet?" Sherlock was silent, pen still hovering over the paper, hand shaking in the slightest. Greg knocked on the door, sighing, "Alright, well, I'm off to the grindstone, I'll be home early tonight," Sherlock swallowed as his footfalls echoed down the corridor. His eyes flickered to the window, standing in his dressing gown and watching as his brother in law walked down the pavement. The curtains squeaked along their rod as he pulled them closed, rustling the dark velvet fabric, ensuring nobody could see in, before dragging the chair of his desk along the floor and securing the back beneath the knob. He wasn't allowed to have locks on the doors anymore, but it would do.
He looked to his pile of suitcases and knelt to go through them as John turned on the water to start shaving. Sherlock waited until the door snapped shut to remove his pants and nightshirt, suddenly overcome with a need for modesty, even after last night. Once naked he quickly found his way into pants, tall socks and a vest, pulling a dark blue button down over his shoulders, and stepping into tan trousers, hopping a bit as he zipped them up. He clipped on his braces and flipped his cuffs over to clasp each pearl button closed before selecting his brown oxfords and lacing them. He spritzed himself with his perfume, if only because it hid his own scent somewhat, and tied his hair up in a scarf, far too tired to wrangle with it this morning. He looked over to a tall mirror in the corner, slowly stepping towards it and examining his reflection. Film star? No way. Not with that face. He turned and closed his cases again, now terribly unsure what to do. He sneaked across the floor and towards the washroom, pushing open the door slightly.
"Sherlock. Listen to me," Greg's voice took on an aggressive, dominating tone, he could use his alpha half when he needed to. "He wants to get to know you. He really doesn't have to, you know. My could sign the papers and you'd be in his bed tomorrow."
“Good to see you too,” He shook her hand, “Happy birthday,” From behind her he caught a glimpse of one of the Dora Malanje and he stuttered. Something about them always made him freeze. He was a bit confused to see them. The King’s guard wouldn’t be protecting her for no reason. “And perhaps, congratulations?”
"I can stay out here, Sherlock, but it isn't safe for me to come in, that's why the door is so secure," Mycroft sighed, slouching down against the wall, head tilted back, arms resting on his knees.
"Hey! You there!" Sherlock gasped, turning in the light, his oil soaked curls shimmering black to see a motorboat approaching, and he cried out.
"What was that darling? You were- what Sherlock?" John looked quizzically to his lover, who keened, a second wave of blood and tissue pouring out of him. John gasped, his heart racing in his chest in realisation, "Pregnant, you're pregnant,"
"Yes, love, then it's back to India, or wherever I'm sent, but I have a house, in Westminster, and a housekeeper who would look after you when I'm away."
“Is that the name of the game, baby? I can play lots of games with a lost little boy-” The man was cut off by someone grabbing his collar and pulling him off of Sherlock. John was livid, so angry he was smiling.
"Sherlock. I have to, when I'm called, I have to go." Sherlock let go and turned to look out the window, arms crossed, looking at his shoes. "It's bigger than just me."
"You did very good, little brother, very good indeed," Something deep and ingrained in Sherlock's tummy bubbled at the praise from his Alpha, an instinct he would soon learn to detest. But for now, the bashful omega smiled, feeling quite special as his family applauded him.
"Um, can I ask, urm, could you, I mean, may we," Sherlock twiddled his fingers, "snuggle, sir? please?" John chuckled and nodded.
“Good boy, using your manners,” John unbuttoned his trousers and pulled Sherlock's cock out, gripping it tightly in his hand, his pet left a muttering trembling mess. He slowly ran along his length, Sherlock’s legs trembling and fighting to stay open. His whimpers were perfection, gravely and low yet so sweet and small. John smiled as he quickened his pace, Sherlock was so hard, so desperate, his words coming to him slowly.
"Jawn!" He mewled, head thrown forward, fringe dripping in his eyes as John hit the spot again and again and again until a firm dry hand grasped his hair and pulled back like the reins of a horse and growled.
"Well, maybe is better than getting taken prisoner, hold this," Sherlock took off his helmet before quickly stripping of his jacket, now clad only in his button down and tie, removing his tie as well, and looking himself over before ripping his British insignia from the side of his arm. He tousled his hair and leaned in forward, "If I don't come back, leave the car and go on foot, we'll be leaving it behind anyways."
Sherlock could barely whisper, his voice threatening to break, "I will," looking up to John, eyes full and glassy and pure. The vicar smiled, turning to John.
"s'alright, darling, it's so good to hear your voice," Sherlock blushed, adjusting the phone, "you still have that camera I got you?" The alpha whispered conspiratorially and Sherlock furrowed his brows.
"Don't be all day about it, we've got a plane to catch," Sherlock bit his cheek but turned around anyways, feet seeming to move of their own volition as John sat on their bed, fastening his cuff links. Sherlock seemed to understand what he was implying, and knelt on the hard wooden floor, tugging socks onto John's feet, his heart thumping wildly in his chest, his mind screaming at him.
Sherlock lay awake, his eyes open and glowing as he watched the ceiling, his mind palace locked firmly locked. They left tomorrow for France, to billet with the Expeditionary Force. He looked over to Janine, who was likewise awake and lie on her side, eyes closed, before turning to their tiny window and looking at the stars- fogged over with thick clouds, but a few little lights straggled through. Somewhere, in the middle of the sea, John might look up and see the same shapes and sparkling dots as Sherlock. That is if he was still in the Northern Hemisphere, which Sherlock was fairly sure of. Sherlock sat up on his cot, rubbing at his hair and holding the back of his nape in his hands, resting his forehead in his bent knees, his own breath fogging on his skin. Sleep was a strange thing. To cut oneself off and go entirely below, deep into the dark abyss, where the subconscious could send anything at him and he couldn't control it.
) for nine-tenths of a second before the truth dawns on him: this message wasn’t meant for him. John is going home to Mary. Sherlock deflates as his heart now appears to stop beating entirely (
‘I wonder if -’ they both start at the same time, huffing out a laugh. Sherlock nods his head indicating for John to speak.
‘I think I need to go, I mean, I’ve just lost my wife and daughter, there’s a lot of shit I should probably talk about, and I’m feeling a lot of violent rage towards your brother right now-’
On the black four-poster bed lies a young woman, shackled, wearing a fishnet body stocking. Her breasts are bare; a riding crop resting between them. There’s a pair of black patent courts on the floor at the base of the bed, one beneath each post, clearly having fallen off her feet as she struggled. And she
‘I’m sorry about him. The press got a bit… much.’ John apologises as his friends congratulate him again on his engagement and leave the flat together.
‘I remember that, but… I thought it was a girl at school. Blond pigtails and a cream cable knit jumper. She was my friend.’
The ringing of Sherlock’s phone interrupts them, earning him another angry glare from Mycroft. The device had been vibrating with messages all morning, though he had ignored them as he prepared his case for this meeting. Fighting for his continued existence seemed more important, but now he’s won that round, he pulls it out to see who’s calling, hoping it’s John. Despite protocol dictating that no mobile phones be brought into these top secret meetings, searching Mycroft Holmes’ brother is not a job anybody wants to have. Thankfully for him. He answers when he sees who it is.
‘Nope. Even with an attempted murder, it wasn’t that exciting.’ He realises the implications in the comment when Sherlock turns pink with embarrassment. ‘Different kind of excitement,’ he coughs, awkwardly. There’s silence for a long moment, neither of them knowing what to say next. This isn’t the kind of thing they talk about.
‘It’s likely, I think. AGRA was a… professional name, but it’s possible that one of the letters was her true name. I agree, the R now seems the most likely.’
Greg snorts a laugh at Mrs. Hudson’s comment, imagining John’s response if he’d heard. Molly looks mortified but the elderly lady continues to smile and joke about his relationship with Sherlock, completely oblivious to the change in the atmosphere – or simply not caring.
As the evening wears on the summer breeze picks up and the hairs on John’s arms stand on end as a shiver runs through him. He pushes away from the table, stretching his hand out towards his husband.
Sherlock closes the last remaining distance between them and presses his plump lips against John’s dry mouth: a firm pressure giving the impression of a confidence he doesn’t feel. It’s not romantic, or sexual in any way, no more than a chaste touch of lips, but to Sherlock it’s everything and all he can think of is that John hasn’t pulled away. In fact, he’s
‘What the hell??’ John demands, all feelings of pity for Mycroft vanishing quicker in the blink of an eye.
are. Always have been. You can’t sell state secrets to a man like Magnussen just to protect Mary, or whatever the hell her name is. Actions like that have serious bloody consequences.’
‘The two things need to be separate: your break-up, and our – whatever this might be.’ Sherlock begins to understand what John is trying to say. He’s been unnaturally slow this evening. Emotions really do slow down his mind to the speed of the general population, though for once he realises he doesn’t mind.
‘Sherlock, I’m sorry that I…’ she takes a deep breath to compose herself, ‘I’m sorry that I kept an eye on your medical records when you were in hospital… it was an invasion of privacy, very unprofessional, and most certainly overstepping -’
‘Oi!’ John throws a piece of breadstick at Sherlock, which lands squarely in his fluffy curls. Sherlock pouts, rooting it out and throwing it back. He catches John’s eyes and smiles.
John mumbles something and in one quick movement Eurus rips the tape from his lips. ‘What was that, John?’
‘I made tea’, he says softly, stating the obvious rather than risk inadvertently saying the wrong thing. He waits for John to acknowledge his presence and when he doesn’t, he crouches down to put his face at John’s eye level. Said eyes are open and staring ahead but not really seeing. ‘John?’ Sherlock asks again, still receiving no response. He’s at a loss, ‘I’ll leave your tea there… If you want something to eat… No, of course you don’t’, he rambles, desperately trying to find the right thing to say, anything that might prompt a reaction from his friend.
Sherlock resolves to pay John for his time helping on cases and running the blog – it will reduce the financial burden on him and may lead him to reducing his hours at the surgery, therefore being available to Sherlock more. He’s surprised he hadn’t thought of it before.
‘Should I… come with you? To talk to Mary, I mean.’ The expression on Sherlock’s face says he would rather be anywhere but with Mary.
'Love what?’ Sherlock, two steps below, turns to face him. He's always liked it when John towers over him like this.
Lestrade walks over to Anderson, who is logging samples taken by his team, under the watchful eye of some secret squirrel from MI-whatever.
This evening, as usual, the telly is on in the background while they eat, tuned to one of the many news channels so Sherlock can keep an eye out for potential new cases. There is a lull in their conversation, making the television seem particularly loud, when there’s an urgent broadcast:
He follows the faint smell of smoke to find Sherlock and his family on the terrace, cigarettes burning in an ashtray. ‘Sherlock, your mum has –
The room descends into awkward silence, and for the remainder of the meal nothing is heard except the scraping of cutlery against plates. Sherlock’s mind can’t stop replaying the words John had said to him and obsessing over the easy affection he is showing now that he has called time on his troubled marriage. It’s really not the time for Sherlock to be coming to terms with his emotions with regards to John, and he feels like his head might implode from the pressure.
Sherlock smirks. Mycroft exhales loudly and raises his eyes to the ceiling, pinching the bridge of his nose as if to ward off the inevitable migraine. Lady Smallwood starts to say something but Sherlock cuts her off; he’s not going to put the British Government on Irene’s trail again.
memories – but I think we should actually be working on finding out who the hell she is now, and what she plans to do next.’
After Sherlock’s re-emergence at The Landmark, John quite frankly had other things to think about. For all he knew the ring that cost two week’s wages was still sitting on their abandoned table in the restaurant.
, it's atrocious, outrageous! And an American! Parliament won't stand for it- he'll move on and find someone proper...bloody outrageous! Although I do agree with him, we ought to be in better relations with the Germans, hell, war probably did 'em some good! They do things better on the continent, as you know, omegas brought up right. These days every shopkeeper and schoolteacher is leaking slick all over the place, it's dreadful, bloody outrageous!"
"You said you loved me," John chuckled, clearly in a delirious state of shock. Sherlock let out his breath in a laugh, blinking and smiling like an idiot, pressing a warm wet kiss to John's cheek, petrol be damned. Suddenly they were enveloped in the light of a torch, the crimson stained water glittering around them as John's head lolled back.
anyone. Your Alpha Patronus has offered me your hand, but I will not accept it if you do not want me, Sherlock. I can offer you my love, protection, from all of it- from the terribly backwards notion that omegas can only keep house and breed pups. If you'll have me, Sherlock, I will love you, respect you, cherish and spoil you the way omegas should be spoiled. Children would be something far down the line, love, for now it's only us that I am interested in. I have 6 months left of my dispensation leave, but if you need more time to decide, I can wait,"
"I guess we could spruce it up, make it a bit more, feminine for you, if you wanted," John scratched his neck and looked over at Sherlock, who stood by the mantle, tracing the wood with earnest.
"My told me you were reporting today, I thought I'd come see you off, is that okay?" Greg said quickly, remembering the laundry incident. Sherlock shook his head and turned properly.
"You," John seethed, his voice at least an octave lower, teeth glimering and nostrils flaring, "will
John put a hand over his husband's mouth and glared at him, his eyes swirling tempests of wild blue, a crashing sea of emotions as he fought back the grumbling Alpha in his chest, gritting his teeth and shaking his head.
“-yes, he made it, Oh, he’s right there, hello, Ross, I’ll call you back brother” Shuri closed the hologram and gave him a look, “You look...paler than normal. Seen a ghost?” Ross furrowed his brow and pointed to where the portal had closed.
Sherlock and Janine walked arm and arm into the brisk night, finding the crowd of dance-goers, only three other girls, near the black metal fence of the barracks, who waved them over. Sherlock felt silly, dressed in his blue button down and tight-fitting tan trousers, with no jacket and his lucky blue ribbon around his neck where a beta or alpha might wear a tie, donning his regulation shoes because he didn't have any others. Janine had brushed his hair out, silky and soft and she'd tugged a bit harder than necessary while ranting about how easy he had it and how male hair was unfairly softer and less greasy.
"Oh, yes, i'm alright." Sherlock bit his lip, swallowing nervously. "Sorry I ran off, I- I don't, do this sort of thing."
"Joyeux Noel," He whispered, taking one more look onto the frozen plain, brushing the snow from his uniform and turning to follow his friend, mumbling so quiet he could barely hear himself, "Joyeux Noel, John,"
"So poshboy, tell me," John said sweetly, voice low and dripping with honey, "will we be dancing again friday night?"
"I can't stay, Sherlock, please, just- sleep, sunshine, you'll be alright," Greg placed him softly on the bed, patting his shoulder and turning to leave. He paused.
The diagram that stared back at him was deceptively brightly coloured. Cheerful little notes pointing the various tubes and organs of the Male Omega, happy little facts about fertility rates, heat cycles, knots. It made him want to puke.
“I can do that, Sherlock, I would be honoured to keep you,” Sherlock let out the breath he was holding and matched John’s kind smile. John adjusted the collar in his hands. “You don’t have to wear this, Sherlock,”
"I think Greg and I ought to take our leave, we'll be back in a bit," Greg and Mycroft's hands clasped together as they stood, leaving arm and arm, Greg peeking over his shoulder shyly to catch one last look before tucking his head onto Mycroft's shoulder as they exited the drawing room.
Their lips found each other as Sherlock desperately kissed him, hands reaching out around his shoulders and pulling him close, sucking in his strong, gunpowdery scent. John kissed back, firm but delicate as he held Sherlock's face in his powerful hands, thumbs brushing his cheekbones. He moved to pull away but Sherlock pressed further before dropping his head to his shoulder and whispering in a cracked and broken voice.
"I'll see you out," She grabbed his hand. He drew his arm away and guarded his hand to his chest. He didn't want to be touched, he realized, never again.
"I'm n-not in heat, I'm not! I've got another two weeks! I'm not! I'm not...Lestrade, I like you, you're not like them, tell them! I'm not..." Sherlock leaned onto Greg's shoulder, "You smell like my brother. Are you his b-boyfirend? No of course you are, he's gonna propose tonight, too! lucky thing, lucky thing..." Sherlock shivered visibly and Greg pulled him up the stairs one at a time.
"Let's see what we have here...Mary...Poppins by P.L. Travers." Mycroft enjoyed the illustration of an umbrella on the front page and cleared his throat as Emmy sat on his knee, leaning up to his chest and staring down at the page. He cleared his throat and began to read, "If you want to find Cherry Tree Lane, all you have to do is ask the Policeman at the crossroads..."
"Sherlock, what is this?" John growled later that morning as Sherlock looked into his microscope. He flapped the letter about in the air and set it on the bench for Sherlock to read. The omega looked at him strangely before reading it and biting his lip. "Did you do this?"
“Are you sure this is safe, Sherlock? What’s actually is this?” Molly asked, nervously looking around the car.
For close to twenty minutes John rode in silence, until the car finally pulled up in front of what looked like a private club, and the man from before, once again opened the door and motioned for him to go inside. Once inside, John was then greeted by another man in a suit who lead him through various hallways, until they reached an ornate oak door. The man rapped three times before quickly scurrying away.
, but Sherlock knew better. No, this woman was still being paid by his brother, and was probably another one of his spies. He’d have to make sure she was never left alone anywhere in the flat, he couldn’t give her any opportunity to plant more of Mycroft’s bugs.
“So please – please, John – please have it – have me.” Sherlock panted, tightening his legs and capturing John’s mouth in desperate kiss after desperate kiss. “Please – oh god, please!” He knew he was begging; he was begging and he didn’t care. All he cared about was getting rid of the layers separating himself from John, and feeling every inch of John’s body against him.
“Yes and no.” John sighed. “Yes, you’ll probably be wearing normal clothes, but no you should wear something loose now because it’s easier to learn the moves when you have a larger range of motion. Plus, I’d hate for you to get sweaty in those.”
In a few short minutes, with a few stupid words, Sherlock ruined everything. John was going to leave, and it was entirely his fault. Sherlock had to act fast, he had to fix this.
John's never giving him up, Sherlock felt his heart soar. “John, you are absolutely ridiculous,” he laughed.
John runs into some familiar faces, some more welcoming than others. He also comes to some decisions.
“Have you started the Maths homework for Friday?” She said as she entered. “Oh… Oh wow. This is it, is it? This is everything you have on…”
“Ok.” Molly said quietly. “My uncle Matt’s probably on duty. We’ll talk to him. He’ll… he’ll let us in.” Of course, Matthew Sanderson, assistant medical examiner based at St. Bart’s Hospital, and Molly Hooper’s uncle. The number of times Sherlock took advantage of that connection, how could he forget? Stupid. He was being stupid, he was being careless.
“So, what’s the whole point of this little speech about how awful I am?” Harry continued. “It’s that John is the best man I know. He helped me when I found, lost, and fought for happiness,” at this she smiled down at a tall, olive skinned woman who smiled back at her. Harry and Clara had decided to give their marriage another chance. “and I don’t know anyone who deserves to find that same kind of happiness more than him.
“I told you, it was nothing” John turned back around to find Sherlock no longer sitting on the steps, but standing right behind him, looking down at him with that small crease he got between his brows when two pieces of a puzzle didn’t yet fit.
“Well I’m not going to tell you how to feel about it, but it’s obviously bugging you. Now, if you want me to shut up, I’ll shut up, but if you want my opinion, I’ll be happy to share it.” Sarah sighed, and suddenly John felt like a petulant child.
‘You bastard! You fucking-’ John starts, but finds he can’t articulate just how angry he is. Actions speak louder than words, and he would have liked to get a few more hits in. He’s done. He’s so done with this
The couple retired to the red and cream brick cottage three years ago when John turned sixty-five and left his part-time job at the surgery. They had been taking less and less dangerous jobs for the last few years as John’s knees began to complain about the rooftop chases, and Sherlock had a concussion for the umpteenth time.
‘Sherlock’s not like that. He doesn’t do that sort of thing.’ John looks down, trying not to let his face show the way this statement makes him feel. ‘The only person he ever seemed to love was decapitated in Pakistan, four years ago.’
John’s words seem to echo in the hallway, as well as Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath as the words register. John looks down, licking his lips nervously, clenching his left fist. Sherlock is blinking repeatedly, frozen to the spot and barely breathing. They stand there for an interminable length of time, eye contact never wavering, before the silence is broken by a call from the dining room.
‘You couldn’t go… home?’ He grimaces with distaste as he says the word. He will never accept that anywhere else is John’s home, despite where he might currently be living.
and cinch a similar belt to hold them up. The constriction would have held the flesh together and stopped them bleeding out, until they took off their belts.’ Sherlock pauses for a moment, the pain in his eyes breaking through his stoic mask.
The session dissolved into an argument, with Dr Farrell writing notes until she cut them off, asking them to discuss, before the next session, the issues they each wanted to raise, and the outcome they were hoping to reach. So when they arrived for their second session, John could be forgiven for assuming this was where they were going to begin.
‘That must have been very painful for you’, John says, and he means it. He can’t imagine how that must feel to a child, regardless of the reasons they were given up.
Sherlock’s nose crinkles in disgust as it does every time he hears his brother’s voice, real or imagined.
There’s a long moment when nobody speaks, until Mary finally relents. ‘I put Sherlock in hospital’, she states, matter-of-factly. Her tone of voice and demeanour say that she is proud of what she had done. ‘I didn’t have a choice, but John doesn’t see it that way.’
‘Mary, please don’t make me prove it.’ He tilts his head and gives her a determined stare, almost begging her to fight him, but she turns away. John relaxes his stance. ‘I’m going to ask Mycroft to send a car for you. You’re going back to the house, and when you receive the divorce papers you will sign them without question.’
‘No, really. I don’t want you suddenly taken away again because you violated the terms of your… stay of execution.’
‘Blood is coming from the back, around the lower ribcage, not from any of the orifices, so no, not Ebola, or similar.’
‘The family was in shock that they had unintentionally allowed Eurus to continue her abuse of Sherlock for so long. She needed psychological help, and she should have been sent to an institution, but our parents were ashamed of raising a psychopath, so after the initial evaluations following the arm incident – where they convinced authorities that she was too young to be aware of what she was doing – Eurus was put up for a regular adoption, with no mention of her past behaviour. I think, despite how clever she was, she didn’t understand at the time what adoption meant. Unsurprising considering her age, but she always seemed to understand everything. She ran rings around the home visitors, acting like a normal child, as if it were some kind of game… She screamed when she was told to say her goodbyes, and Sherlock cried… he cried for weeks. He had developed something akin to Stockholm Syndrome, and he was devastated when she was suddenly gone. My father bought him Redbeard so he still had someone to play with.’
It’s then that Sherlock realises his mistake. Eurus was never really after him; she wanted Mycroft. Telling Sherlock to come alone, knowing full well he would bring Mycroft. He’s been an
‘Take a look. No sign of a stab wound on their back, despite the blood clearly coming from there. We’ll need to wait until the bodies have been stripped and cleaned at the morgue before we’ll know for sure. There’s only so much we can do here without the risk of dislodging any trace evidence on their clothes.’
John gives her a look that she takes to mean “he’s going to answer the phone and it’s best if they don’t row about it in the middle of the street”, and for once she relents, taking a couple of steps away, raising her arm to hail a cab, not waiting to find out if John is joining her.
Through all of this Sherlock just listens, and when John starts talking about The Fall, it’s Sherlock that goes to the bar for another drink.
‘It was a wild ride. Plenty of material for the book. The cold cases aren’t really the same, are they?’
John slams the front door to 221, rushing out into the pouring rain whilst still fighting a war with his coat sleeves. He’s hot and dizzy, and the cold rain feels quite pleasant on his sweating skin. It’s like an out-of-body experience, he’s not sure if he can still feel his feet or even his legs, but somehow he doesn’t stop striding until he’s a safe distance away from the flat – from Sherlock. He’s crossed Clarence Bridge into Regent’s Park and slows his steps as he enters “Holme Green” and the irony of the name is not lost on him. Despite the rain, John sinks to the ground by the lake, disturbing a bevy of swans huddling together against the bank.
‘He’s in shock, he won’t speak or cry. Mrs Hudson, I don’t know what to do’, Sherlock is loath to admit.
‘Being but a child myself, there was a lot I did not know at the time, therefore the first thing I did when I reached a position of influence was to seek out all hospital and police records, and psychological evaluations of both of my siblings, so I could learn the full story. Eurus’s adoption records were sealed, and I did not attempt to unseal them. I wanted to believe she never existed, so I deleted all of the records linked to her, and all mentions of her name on the birth register so that nobody would ever know what had happened. In hindsight, I deeply regret this error of judgement.’
That night the conversations with Mary had centred on the return of the great detective: John vowing to never speak to his former best friend again, whereas Mary was being surprisingly supportive of the man she’d never known – even daring to say that she
The Watsons had found Dr Farrell after many hours of tedious internet searches for a local, female, therapist: Mary supposing that a female would be more likely to take her side, and John simply being fed up with having his life dissected by a man. He hadn’t wanted to return to Ella; it seemed unfair to Mary to use a therapist already privy to so much of his life before. With (and without) Sherlock. They needed someone neutral, and Dr Plain Suit Farrell certainly fit that description.
‘I know, Sherlock, and I appreciate that I could just come back here, but when I do, I don’t want to be moving back as just your flatmate...’ He pauses to let that sink in. ‘… and I can’t simply jump from one relationship to another.’
‘John, if Magnussen blows Mary’s cover, you’ll be at risk. Especially if they can’t find her. The people she’s hurt, the families of those she’s killed – they will come for you.’
had done to her little brother… well… it was poetic justice, wasn’t it? The fact that she was pregnant didn’t even give her pause: the child meant nothing to her, just as she had meant nothing to her parents. If she hadn’t gained Sherlock’s attention with the dominatrix murder, then she certainly had with this one. She’s looking forward to reconnecting with him; they had been such friends as children, being so close in age. From all she’s read about him, he does love to play a good game, and she hopes she’s been providing him with one.
‘Mr Holmes. Sherlock. You’re back in this country to bring down Moriarty, as you clearly failed to do so last time. Whether you
‘But all the previous victims had an item on them that linked to you, to your childhood. Mary didn’t.’
Besides, they aren’t exactly working the case right now. The folder stays closed on the table, with Molly’s autopsy report unread inside. Sherlock isn’t even tempted to pick it up, simply enjoying John’s company and reminiscing over their past cases. John can’t remember the last time he had an evening as relaxed as this, and with a baby on the way it will probably be a while before he gets another one.
‘How on Earth do you know that?’ Greg asks, in the incredulous tone of voice that is his default when dealing with Sherlock.
she turns to John, ‘Mary was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. Specifically to the inferior vena cava.’
‘Eurus… I was a complicated child, with a lot of complex needs, and our parents already had their hands full with me’, Sherlock says, repeating the information he had been given by Mycroft. ‘Then you came along, so intelligent and needing support that they couldn’t give. It wasn’t that they didn’t love you, I was just… a lot.’
only just found out about the tea pots’, he responds, now adding to the case wall the relevant entries from John’s blog, along with the comments. ‘I had a suspicion, but I needed to see if someone else would pick up on the connection… to be sure I wasn’t seeing patterns where there weren’t any. I’ve often been accused of wanting things to be too clever.’
Mary nods, eyes downcast, and when John moves closer to hug her, she leans forward and kisses his cheek, hiding her face against his neck. They stand there, in the middle of the busy street, the perfect picture of the happy expectant couple.
Seems everyone knew but him, he thinks as he puts the box on the desk in the simple room, rummaging in his rucksack until he finds his charger. Plugging his phone in he’s surprised to find there’s only one message from Sherlock, which came in around an hour ago.
knows exactly how Jeff Hope was shot’, John fires back. ‘Sherlock, is there a serial killer picking off innocent people because of my blog?’
, John mused when they entered for their first appointment ten days ago. Mary is heavily pregnant, with only three weeks to go until her due date. She wears her obnoxiously bright red coat, as if it were a suit of armour, her hands clutched tightly beneath her belly as she looks down at her flat, white, scuffed trainers, and the dirty marks on the coffee coloured carpet. John clenches the fingers of his left hand in his lap. His right, clad in a dark blue cashmere sweater (a gift from Sherlock, that Mary wasn’t impressed to see him wearing to their appointment), is spread out on the armrest in a display of nonchalance that isn’t fooling the therapist in the room.
Sherlock’s eyes are roaming over everything, though his body is unusually still, tense, his arms still held by the two men who would do anything to protect him from this pain. Without realising, he squeezes Mycroft’s arm as he takes in the scene, reading the events like an open book that will remain resolutely closed to the forensic team.
She rolls her eyes, ‘You’ve got a shift this afternoon, John! You’ll get fired if you miss many more, and then where will we be?’
Of course, nothing is ever that simple with them, and before he knows it they are in the centre of a case again. There’s the tube car, the trick, the forgiveness, and after the dust has settled and their statements given, there’s a take-away on the sofa at 221B, and a conversation that is stilted and emotional for both of them.
he wanted, and she really has been his saviour over the last six months, but in the last few minutes, since Sherlock Holmes bloody
‘Fuck, do you think she would come after you?! I meant I didn’t want to leave you to deal with all these bloody emotions on your own. I didn’t even
The last week had been exhilarating, replicating the kills with perfection and precision. Just the right puzzle to draw out the consulting detective. The thrill of the chase is one thing, but the thrill of the
When he spots it over breakfast the next morning, he’s unreasonably furious. Despite the fact that he’d obviously planned to propose to her, he finds himself annoyed to see the ring sitting plainly on her finger, as if the question had gone ahead uninterrupted. When he tries to bring it up with her she’s understandably hurt, thinking he no longer wants to marry her, and he doesn’t have the strength to talk it through with her. He needs to see Sherlock, to thank him for saving his life again, and to finally listen to what he has to say.
Sherlock waits for the information to sink it; John has only been awake for twenty minutes, he can be forgiven for being a little slow. He spots the moment it dawns on his blogger.
‘For the last time, they stay. Now speak before I let John finish what he started’, Sherlock threatens, reminding Mycroft of the throbbing in his broken nose. He really should get it looked at by a doctor (preferably not the same doctor that broke it) before it sets itself into an even more ridiculous shape than it was before.
‘I didn’t know who she was. Not until she shot Sherlock. And I wanted to leave right there and then, but Sherlock… he kept telling me we could trust her, that she was careful
Mary, however, has contacted him every thirty minutes since the last message he’d read, almost like she’d set a reminder to do so. Putting the phone down on the bench beside him he rests his head in his hands wearily, and takes a moment to feel sorry for himself. He laughs humourlessly: shouldn’t it be a good thing to have two people in love with you? Sighing like a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders, he picks up the phone again and fires off a quick text -
‘Lestrade has identified the victim: Steven Horningsea, forty-two, married, father of three, been a London cab driver for twenty years. No criminal record. I read over Molly’s report last night. Autopsy showed no signs of any drug use, past or present. I also asked her to pull out the paperwork for the autopsy of Jeff Hope. Turns out she conducted that one, too.’ He pauses before imparting the most interesting information, ‘John, this isn’t just a similar shot, it’s
John leaves the shower, in a far too small towel, after forty-six minutes, just as Sherlock is pouring the coffee into their own mugs. It’s a strange quirk that always amuses John. ‘Wow, a tidy table
Two hours have passed without a word from John, and Sherlock is smoking. He rescued an old cigarette from a long abandoned box behind a loose tile in the kitchen, and is currently pacing the floor of the living room, paying no mind to the ash falling on the floor.
John is now standing directly opposite him in the narrow space behind the front door. He’s so close he can feel Sherlock’s breath in his hair. ‘I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.’
‘I want to do all I can for you, but it’s very hard for me to help you when you won’t be entirely honest about the problems that bring you here. You speak of betrayal, yet there are many different types of betrayal, and each has a different severity that is entirely dependent on the people involved. How can I guide you through it if I don’t know what
The violin should help take his mind off the interminable waiting. If he hasn’t heard anything in an hour, he’ll go round there and drag John out himself.
He’s so caught up in the outpouring of his own emotions, he fails to hear the footsteps approaching the flat until a voice speaks behind him, just as the kettle finishes boiling.
‘They can’t possibly have gone far, John has only been here for twenty three minutes’, Mycroft says. ‘My people will scour all local CCTV, they’ll be on it somewhere.’
Emboldened by a sudden wave of relief and optimism, he turns to Sherlock, taking his face in his hands and gently planting a firm kiss on his plump lips. He pulls back, before Sherlock has a chance to react, and smiles at his deeply flushed cheeks. It’s so endearingly easy to embarrass him. He sees his friend’s (boyfriend’s) hands gripping his knees, fingers digging into the flesh, knuckles white, and he slides his own hands over the top. Sherlock’s hands relax and he turns them palm up, taking hold of John’s and lacing their fingers together.
‘Why don’t you have a lie down, Mummy? I’ll make you some tea.’ Sherlock stands taking his mother’s arm while John takes the other. Mycroft raises his eyebrow at Sherlock’s offer to make tea, but before he can comment his father meets his eyes and silently suggests they go outside to smoke on the back terrace.
‘As impressive as your mind palace? I’m surprised to hear you admit that’, John says, before going quiet as he ruminates upon the comment. ‘Hang on. What if that’s it? What if his “vaults” are in his own mind palace? It would explain how he can remember so much information. He’s not just memorising paper files; he’s got his own bloody mind palace!’ John grins, immensely pleased with himself; did he actually just beat Sherlock to a deduction?
‘I have not asked her to do the autopsy, Gregory, though I believe she will volunteer. She’s simply there to provide support to Dr Watson. Dr Hooper is stronger than you give her credit for.’
have, it was dead!’ He’s aware he isn’t making a lot of sense, but it wouldn’t be the first time that Sherlock’s brilliance has left him tongue-tied.
Sherlock hugs her and kisses her head, thanking her for her insight, though internally he doubts that his presence will do much for John at this moment.
Sherlock smiles, passing over the file in his hand – it’s the Black Lotus case. ‘Knew you’d get there eventually.’
Sherlock grits his teeth, fighting the urge to verbally decimate his brother over his pathetic crush on Lestrade, and his two pound weight gain. He’s helped in his endeavour by a beep coming from his inside pocket. He fishes out his phone, praying that it’s John, but it’s an unknown number.
‘Are you?’ Sherlock looks surprised at the both topic and the notion that this particular case matters to his elder brother.
They talk about therapy. Unbeknownst to John, Sherlock has been seeing Ella, and is surprised to admit she’s helped. He asks John why he chose not to see her for his counselling with Mary.
‘Shut up, both of you. This isn’t the time or place for your petty domestics. Who knew this was how she – how she
Ten days later and the boys are together on the sofa, digging into a curry. Sherlock is actually eating with gusto, and John can’t stop smiling at him. Their… relationship… has progressed slowly since their confessions at Christmas; there has been some touching, caressing, and some cringeworthy flirting, but nothing more. They are both just happy to be here, together, and they don’t need to rush.
‘Christ, that’s…’ he trails off, looking at the photographs Sherlock had printed out from both shootings, and the detailed diagrams of the shoulder he had included. The highlighted sections on the diagrams show that the shots really were as close to identical as you could possibly get with two different victims, two different shooters, and two different guns.
The text came through during Sherlock’s fourth game of bridge with Mrs. Hudson. He’d lost the first three (she cheated, obviously) so anything that interrupted her unsportsmanlike cackling would have been welcome, even if it was Mycroft. Yet, Sherlock is undeniably grateful that the name on the screen is
He is in equal parts excited for, and dreading, the arrival of the child. Okay, maybe not equal parts, more like a twenty-eighty split. The opportunities for scientific study are vast, yet he knows that her very existence will widen the distance (physical, emotional, geographical) between him and John. The saddest part is, on the rare occasions they are together, they seem to be as close as they ever were. With John juggling fatherhood, marriage, and a job at the surgery, those occasions will be even fewer and further between.
Sherlock abruptly stands up, shaking off John, who has been holding him through each revelation. The mask is back in place. ‘Well, this has been a lovely trip down memory lane – for those of us that actually
‘She’s not going to do the autopsy is she?’ Lestrade asks. ‘Mary was a friend, and the baby… you can’t make her do that.’
‘Sally can take charge of the forensic team. I’ve already spoken to Molly Hooper, she knows what’s happened and she’s going to do the PM’s this afternoon.’ He turns to Sherlock, putting a supportive hand on his shoulder, ‘She sends her condolences.’
He turns to John, ‘Do calm down. I calculated the doses carefully. It is something I’m pretty good at’, he quips.
Sherlock slips into his mind palace to play over the events of the evening, his fingers stimming nervously against the arms of his chair. No, he decides, he did the right thing. Without that kiss they would have ignored their feelings for each other forever, and Sherlock really couldn’t have handled a continuation of the tension that was between them in the weeks leading up to the fall; the constant limbo had only been bearable because he had not yet known what it would feel like to be entirely without John. If their feelings and attraction were ultimately to lead nowhere, he

brought this up in private! He’d managed with his hand for the last six months, why the hell couldn’t she?
‘Sherlock,’ Lestrade calls, ushering him over to where the victim is slumped against the side of a black cab. He nods at the forensic techs, silently asking for room to let Sherlock work. They are used to him by now, but that doesn’t stop the looks of disdain, especially from Anderson who opens his mouth to retort but wisely stops himself.
She lifts the pen away from the paper. ‘That’s fine, John. We really should be focussing more on you and Mary in these sessions, and less on Sherlock Holmes.’
Sherlock comes to his brother’s rescue. ‘It was my suggestion to bring Mary here, Mummy. I believed, falsely, that they were having a baby together.’
I get that you were upset that I lied to you, and about the… other thing… But you moved in with him for five months! What must that have looked like?’
Mycroft holds a handkerchief to his nose, but doesn’t make a sound. He’s been punched before. He’s been punched by
After an excruciatingly silent cab ride, John and Sherlock return to Baker Street. John hasn’t said another word since thanking Molly, and he’s yet to shed a tear. Sherlock knows he’s in shock, but doesn’t have the first clue what to do about it. Without even looking at his friend, John shuffles up the second set of stairs to his room and closes the door.
‘I don’t believe in coincidences. The universe is rarely so lazy’, Sherlock parrots one of Mycroft’s favourite lines back to him.
‘For not going. For choosing me instead of the case. I know it’s not the first time you’ve done that, and I don’t think I’ve ever thanked you for it.’ John takes a step closer to him; the hand on Sherlock’s back sliding down to take hold of his hand. ‘There’s a lot I should be thanking you for.’
John huffs in annoyance. Well, that’s clear as mud. He doesn’t know why he expected anything else from his enigmatic flatmate. Ex. Ex-flatmate!
‘We are not doing this’, John shouts, ‘We’re going back in the house and attempting to enjoy the rest of Christmas. Mary can look after herself. I’m not letting you put your life, your freedom, at risk for her.’
been slept in. Mycroft doesn’t have friends, certainly none close enough to invite to his home. Despite how much he enjoys annoying his brother, Sherlock is glad for the opportunity to leave, even if it is just to be sequestered in a subterranean office at Vauxhall Cross.
When the plates are filled, Mr. Holmes raises his wine glass and says, ‘To my wonderful wife. Thank you for the meal you have prepared for us. And… to family. Merry Christmas.’
‘Okay’, Sherlock mumbles like a petulant child. He closes his eyes, afraid to watch John walk away once more.
‘Oh, Mikey… what happened?’ She puts a hand over her eyes, squinting against the light. ‘Did I faint?’
‘Sherlock.’ John groans, but there’s affection lacing his words as he realises the reason Sherlock is so adamant. ‘I’m not going to change my mind, okay? It’s safe to let me out of your sight, I promise.’
‘So what, you think someone wanted to kill somebody and is trying to cover up their motive by making it look like the… vigilante that killed Jeff Hope five years ago?’
Mary looks at John out of the corner of her eye, knowing full well they hadn’t begun to discuss it. ‘We thought May.’
They catch a cab to John’s home, where John stands at the door but cannot bring himself to open it. Sherlock takes the key from his hand and opens up, walking straight into the bedroom to grab the suitcases he knows they keep there. John takes a moment before straightening up, nodding to himself once, and marching into the house as if he’s still a soldier on parade. He averts his eyes away from any of the photos and keepsakes in the living room as he grabs the essentials: his laptop, phone charger, and his duffel bag, before heading into the bathroom to pack his toiletries.
Lestrade manages to jump out of his chair without falling on his arse, pulling on his jacket, his breakfast discarded on the desk. ‘Address?’
Sherlock doesn’t see the point of a silent approach; his sister is expecting him, after all, so he opens the internal door to the garage as if he were throwing open the door to 221B. Eurus is standing behind John, facing the door Sherlock has just walked through; a gun pressed to the side of John’s temple. She smiles when she first sees Sherlock, but this quickly turns to a frown when Mycroft walks in behind him.
much of an idiot. I stopped in the middle of my perfect deduction of the shooter when my eyes landed on you. Then I told him everything I said was wrong.’
do that. He clearly didn’t follow it up, but he closed the investigation without looking anywhere else.’
Sherlock gulps, the air around them suddenly tense with possibility. ‘No need. There were many times when the opposite was true, and I… I’m trying to do better.’
When he’s not supporting John, Sherlock is still working the case, though he doesn’t discuss anything with his friend. He still calls his brother daily, but his team are getting nowhere, or at least they aren’t admitting to anything - a fact that Mycroft is unusually apologetic about.
Back up in his flat Sherlock grabs his laptop from the desk by the window, makes himself a fresh cup of tea, and goes back up to John’s room. He doesn’t appear to have moved and his cup still sits full on the side.
Sherlock sighs, clenching his jaw with the effort it takes not to lunge for Mycroft again. ‘I’ll ask you one more time.
Dr Farrell glances at her watch, somewhat relieved, ‘Our time is up for this week, John. I would encourage you to make another appointment, same time next week? We have quite a bit of work to do.’
‘I don’t expect you to solve it, Detective Inspector. I expect you to put up the pretence of working it until the story disappears from the newspapers. Sherlock can concoct a story for the
‘MI6 – they want to place you back into Eastern Europe. An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, I think, about six months.’ Mycroft’s cheeks are flushed, but whether it is from the bitter wind or the emotion conjured up at the thought of his brother’s demise, Sherlock can’t be sure.
Mycroft signals for them to take a seat on the immaculate white leather sofas in the living room. He surreptitiously glances at John, contemplating asking him to wait outside, but in the end he doesn’t refuse the doctor’s presence. He sits opposite them, a pained look on his face. Like his brother, Mycroft is not one to give voice to his theories without concrete evidence.
‘I fell in love with you. Damn it.’ He wipes a tear that has escaped from his left eye. ‘If I’d known how you felt before you… We could have…
Mrs Hudson ushers Mary downstairs, much to Mary’s annoyance – she clearly wanted to argue more and doesn’t want to leave without her fiancé. Mrs H looks back and winks at John, closing the door behind her.
John huffs out a laugh, the nerves leaving his body along with it. ‘No, you git, I’m not proposing! I… I’d like you to be my daughter’s godfather.’
‘It’s not me you should be apologising to, Brother Mine. If you’re hiding something, I won’t be responsible for any bones John breaks.’
‘Lestrade, get Molly to do the autopsy this afternoon. I’ll head over to Barts now.’ He desperately needed something to do, and if that meant seeing patterns where there weren’t any, then so be it. At the very least, it should be enough to spark John’s interest and give him an excuse to come to Baker Street.
‘What do you want, Eurus?’ Sherlock asks, eyes never leaving John’s. He sees his friend blink once, slowly; his only way of saying “I’m okay”.
It’s seven o’clock that evening before John steps off the tube at Baker Street station, having returned home after work to ask if Mary minded him staying the night, and to pack a bag. He knows there’s little chance of them finishing before midnight, and he doesn’t have to work Wednesday’s. There was a time when he would have left work at the first signs of a new case, but he has responsibilities now, he can’t just jump every time Sherlock texts, however much he might want to escape the oppressive silence that is his marriage these days. Despite the comments Mary made in counselling, she was surprisingly supportive of his decision to go, as long as he kept the volume up on his phone, for any baby related emergencies.
"I-" Sherlock breathed, suddenly devoid of oxygen. He couldn't breathe. Fuck. He moved to speak, but his tongue wouldn't budge, his mouth numb and his lungs empty, his body trembling. The commander gasped, holding his shoulders as he went down, his knees slicing into the gravel and his whole body falling forward as he desperately tried to breathe.
"You are a child, you most certainly act like one. And yeah, of course you bloody well matter to me. I married you! I bonded with you. I love you so, so very much. But I love my country too, Sherlock, and it has to come first. If you weren't so bloody immature you'd understand!"
closed!" Sherlock opened his mouth to protest some more when a heavy, square object was placed in his hands. He held it, approximately 1800g, metal with leather straps, hallow...He peeked open his eye and gasped. "Jawn how much did this cost?!"
“Sherlock, I don’t know about this,” John sat in his chair, but Sherlock did not move. “Look at me, Sherlock.” The younger man obeyed instantly, eyes deep and sorrowful. John cleared his throat, “look, Sherlock, I don’t take this lightly, you’re not like the others,”
"Oh, of course!" She nodded furiously, taking the box from Greg and opening the lid, her eyes flickering with- something, something Sherlock couldn't place as she pulled the belt from it's case. Sherlock looked away, it wasn't humanly possible to be blushing as hard he was right now.
Sherlock bit his lip. He nestled his nose in the fabric of his clothing, the cologne thick and manly and calming because it smelled like John. Mycroft, for once in his pathetic paperweight existence, was right. Nobody would take an uneducated omega seriously, this was what he always wanted, to be serious, to be someone else.
“I don’t know.” John breathed, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s. “I don’t know, but I want too. I just want… you. Only you… It’s only ever been you.” And then they were kissing again, lips parting, tongues sliding into each other’s mouths, tasting, exploring, learning everything about the other.
Sherlock was only half paying attention, his concentration primarily focused on the pig’s feet dissolving on the kitchen table. “A double what?” he hummed.
“I did, didn’t I?” John chuckled into Sherlock’s shoulder, his arms moving to wrap around Sherlock’s waist and return the hug. It felt amazing. “I make a pretty good teacher.”
“Yes, I thought along the hetero-normative lines of our society, and assumed Harry was your brother, and not your sister.”
“There is nothing… nothing ordinary about you, John. You could never be ordinary,” Sherlock breathed. How could John ever think he was ordinary? John was a marvel.
“Mummy always insists we spend Christmas at the house in Kent. She thinks the scenery is more ‘befitting the season’ than here in London. The second the calendar flips to December, it’s all Christmas carols, eggnog, and decorations. I’ve never met a grown woman who gets as excited for Christmas as my mother, and father only ever indulges her.” He would never admit it out loud, but he too was rather fond of Christmas, everything decked out in decorations, everything but the tree that is. The tree was to be trimmed on Christmas Eve and never a moment sooner.
Physical therapy improved as well. By the end of his sixth day in hospital, Sherlock was able to stand unaided for short periods of time; his longest time was one minute, but he was determined to improve. He could even take a few steps and move short distances down the hall as long as he had a crutch – either human or artificial – to lean on. Satisfied with the progress he had made during ‘Stage One’, Meredith Whatever-Her-Name gave Sherlock her stamp of approval, and he was to be released the following day. Of course, Sherlock’s imminent release also had one unfortunate side effect, a visit from Mycroft.
“Did you… Did you mean it? Are you really in this one hundred percent? You weren’t just saying that? We’re a couple now, we’re together? Really together?” Sherlock asked, nervously looking down at where he held one of John’s hands in both of his, their fingers loosely intertwined.
John started to laugh, and Sherlock soon found himself joining in. Laughing over a joke with a friend – and at Mycroft’s expense – he could get use to this.
As John hung back, waiting for a break to put in his order, his eyes scanned the club once more. Bill had successful met the ‘lovely little redhead’ and the two seemed to be getting quite cozy in one of the booths bordering the dance floor.
‘Stage Three’ was set to begin the next day. No longer was Heather going to come to the flat, but Sherlock was going to go to the physical therapy center – as an outpatient of course – for his sessions three times a week. He was finally getting the chance to get out of the flat, and stretch his legs so to speak. He was finally strong enough to re-enter society to a certain extent. He still had to ‘take it easy’ and Lestrade had nixed the idea of him going to crime scenes, but he was no longer so tied to the flat, he was nearly free.
This was also the last of Sherlock's POV we're going to see until the epilogue (that is if he even survived this fall to be alive during the epilogue). You're all just going to need to come back on Tuesday to find out about the landing. But until then, why not leave some comments telling me what you think will happen and how you think John will react. Who knows, it may sway me to change my plan.....
They made idle chit-chat for a while, until Sarah finally took a deep breath, looking seriously at John. That was never a good sign.
“Well there you go.” John said, beginning to play with Sherlock’s hair as he often did in their more intimate moments. “I’m not going to make a bee-line for the best-looking guy in the place, the moment I get there. I had to work up a little courage first.”
“So what do you want to do? We can be cops and robbers, or army men, or maybe treasure hunters!” John said, already running towards the playground.
Lifting the hand not wrapped around John’s waist, Sherlock cupped John’s cheek and pulled his head back down. “Thank you,” He whispered against John’s lips, and then finally closed the final bit of space between them. The kiss was deliberate, it was long and languid. Sherlock poured everything he felt, everything John meant to him, in to the slide of his lips against John’s. Everything Sherlock couldn’t find the correct words for, he told John through the kiss.
The moan Sherlock released when John gave an experimental tug, sent shock waves up John’s spine. It felt like he’d been struck by lightening, every nerve felt electrified, his chest felt like it was going to explode. John had been on the receiving end of a number of blow jobs in his life, but never had he experienced one this good. It was… ecstasy.
They kissed for several long minutes before Sherlock pulled away. “So does this mean we can start over again?” He asked, resting his forehead against John’s, his thumb rubbing lazy patterns against John’s cheek. It felt amazing
“Well I’m happy to hear that you’re ready and willing to work,” the therapist – Meredith something – said cheerily. Ugh, that’s just what he needed, another chipper person in his life. “But you have to understand that this isn’t going to happen overnight. A full recovery is going to take several months, and it’s going to be several months of hard work.”
“Easy, Sargent,” Lestrade said sternly, cutting Sherlock off before he could say anything. “I invited him and I want him to have a look around.”
“And you’re not just saying that because I asked this morning? You were still half asleep. You are not required to keep commitments made whilst partially asleep.” He hadn’t even planned on asking if John would accompany him on the trip back to campus, it just sort of slipped out. After the pub with all of John’s other friends, then John – his best friend – offering to share his room where they talked well into the night; after waking up that morning and looking across to the other bed to see John sleep rumpled and peaceful, Sherlock didn’t want it to end just yet. He couldn’t help himself; ‘let’s go back together’ was leaving his lips before he even realized he’d opened his mouth.
“John’s careful with his money, and he wouldn’t waste it when all his shoes are in fairly good condition. Things really would go smoother if you all just trust me, and trust I know what I’m saying.” Sherlock did not have the patience to deal with the constant questioning, and second guessing. There was a reason he wanted to work with Lestrade, but she was too busy speaking with Mr. Watson.
When John had met Sherlock outside the library for Sherlock’s birthday celebration, he had not imagined the evening would end with him crouched down next to the infuriating birthday boy, hiding behind a door in New Scotland Yard. He hadn’t been sure exactly what Sherlock has ‘always wanted to do’; minor vandalism to Mycroft’s flat? Sure.  Breaking into St. Bart’s to play with some of their more high-tech lab equipment? That was definitely something Sherlock would do. But this, breaking in to police headquarters to install a patch on the computers of all homicide DIs? They were so getting arrested.
“Only seventeen minutes, it could have been worse.” Lestrade said, looking at his watch. “Actually, for you I think that counts as on time.” He laughed.
“But I wasn’t getting carried away, it wasn’t because we’d chased down a thief or closed a case. I didn’t kiss you back back there, or ‘pin you to the wall’ as you say, because of adrenaline or because I feel some sort of physical attraction,” Sherlock whined.
The New Year rolls around, and John decides to appropriate the skull of an unused research skeleton for Sherlock. He had been eyeing it whenever he comes to see John. If it happens to coincide with Sherlock’s 21st birthday, well that’s just a crazy twist of fate.
"Good, take off your clothes," John whispered darkly. The omega blinked. Rapidly. Did he just say..."Go on, be a good lad and take off your clothes," John said with a bit more cheek and Sherlock's face was flaring crimson, his heart beat inside of them, his tongue heavy in his mouth as he sucked in weak breaths.
"She's pretty," He said dumbly, and Sherlock turned, swallowing and squaring his shoulders before making his way to his friend, looking up to make sure John wasn't paying attention and looking down at her face, eyes closed peacefully, skin still glowing and freckled.
," John warned, and Sherlock could see his face almost, haughty and strong and he bit down even harder, nodding softly even if he was alone in the dark sitting room.
There was a silence, Sherlock's itching skin rubbing against the sheets, his fingers grasping the bed clothes tight as a sharp throb ached in his neck. John lapped at it, cooling and gentle and Sherlock sighed contentedly, throwing himself prostrate across John's chest once more.
“Sherlock,” Daddy said with a warning tone, leaning on the door frame. “Come out of the car. Now.” Sherlock’s body wouldn’t listen to him! He screamed at his legs to move, get up, do something! But he remained still save the shuddering of his silent tears. John gripped his arm again, and Sherlock whimpered at the pain. He was sure to have hand-shaped bruises there for at least a week. Daddy let go immediately, but Sherlock didn’t look up. “Please, love,” daddy said softly, and Sherlock shakily stood up, daddy pressing a hand at the small of his back, leading him to the lift. Daddy gently rubbed a circle on the back of Sherlock’s suit jacket, and the touch was grounding and calming.
"I'm fine!" He cried, eyes laden with heavy tears. Even through the blurry, he could see that he'd upset her, shaking and trembling and he rubbed at his eyes, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry I shouted, Mrs. Hudson, I'm fine," He whispered, cheeks bleary and wet, curls sticking to his face in clumps. She nodded and came closer, kneeling down, even if her hip was angry about it. She tentatively wrapped her hands around his and smiled.
“Sherlock, why’re you doing this?” Sherlock sputtered, his eyes slowly rising to meet John’s- whole and shimmering cosmic green and blue. He bit down on his plush bottom lip, breathing hitched. He looked down quickly, his cheeks flushing red. He held up the collar, head down, lifting it to John.
"It's beautiful, your uncle is very generous," John mumbled as they pulled up to the vila, which was two stories of stone brick, with green shuttered windows and a tile roof. A large old woman sat in a chair on the patio, in a blue uniform with a white apron. The car turned off, and John opened the door, holding it open and offering his hand to Sherlock, who took it with a blush. Sherlock shyly approached the house as John sorted the cases from the boot.
"...dismissed. Holmes, stay back please," The girls shuffled away, the gravel crunching beneath their feet and Sherlock swallowed, still standing there, stupidly. Like a doll, his clothes fluttering against him in the wind, his hands numb and limp at his sides.
As the car drove through the muggy June of London, Sherlock let himself cry. He cried and cried, legs crossed, arms wrapped around himself. This was the last time, he decided. No more tears, best to get it over and done with. He would teach himself- train himself, he was quite smart, no matter what anybody said. No more pesky feelings about his body. He wasn't really his body was he?
‘Oh, John. Didn’t we just have a conversation about my sexuality? He continues to laugh. ‘An honest answer to your question… I would say The Speckled Band.’
What happened?’ He demands, as he notices both Mycroft and his father are unconscious, heads on the table, while Sherlock leans against the wall nonchalantly typing something on his phone.
Sherlock is completely absorbed by the photograph, and doesn’t notice they have left the room. He’s trying his best to look at anything other than his best friend, tied up and helpless, but there’s very little else for him to look at. There’s just enough light for him to see the bottom of the wall behind John, and where it meets the two walls running down the sides. He’s staring, barely blinking. He knows there’s a detail he’s missing, and it could be that very detail that saves John’s life.
, is dead. John is back home at 221B, with Sherlock, and with the prospect that they could be something more. He honestly can’t wait for a new case.
John’s fist collides with Mycroft’s nose, a sickening crack filling the empty air. Sherlock pulls John back before he can take a second swing, not wanting his friend to be arrested, or shot by secret service.
‘Check the body for anything that doesn’t belong to her – see if her family can account for all of the keys’, Sherlock orders as he strides out of the door and to the main road to hail a cab. He has everything he needs from the scene, so they follow the body to the morgue, Molly having agreed to come in early to conduct the autopsy and retrieve the bullet for analysis.
'Come on, you’ll have to go down. They want the story.' John reminds him that the press are waiting at the door downstairs.
When John arrives on Sunday, it’s already early evening and the smell of Mrs Hudson’s cooking is filling the hallway.
‘So if you were not pregnant, you think you would have reacted differently to John’s actions?’ Dr Farrell continues.
She’s regaling the group with stories about what a wonderful partner John is and how he’ll be the perfect husband. ‘Honestly, you have no idea how lucky I am, he’s perfect’, she tells them.
a mad scientist, isn’t he? His dress sense has only marginally relaxed since his retirement; the navy suit trousers are a finer cotton and the sleeves of the pale blue shirt are rolled to his elbows.
Before John, Sherlock would have been happy to be left alone, able to work on his experiments in peace. Alone did not equate to lonely. But
My mother puts the shopping on the table, opens her coat, then puts the kettle on. She also wouldn’t have realised she was starting to bleed. When she hangs up her coat she is already dizzy, missing the coat peg. Bending to pick it up she sees the blood which is now coming faster. Calling to my father she sees him in the chair, slowly sliding to the floor as he loses blood pressure. She goes for the kitchen phone, picks it up from the receiver, dials the numbers – there’s blood on the nine – but collapses before she can make a call.’
‘More or less. Yet both shots shattered the coracoid process, tearing through the coracoacromial ligament, and nicking the axillary artery.’
, it’s not important, you’re all idiots, this case is moronic even for you lot. None of this is important,” Sherlock grumbled and John raised his eyebrows dangerously.
"What's the meaning of this?" John said, hands on his hips. Mrs. Hudson opened her mouth with a smile, but Sherlock cut her off, his voice cold and emotionless and remote.
"I, John Watson," He repeated, looking down at his omega with an aching pride, his lips helplessly turned into a smile.
"Oh thank God, thank God. What the hell are you doing here, Sherlock?" John whispered, still holding them both tight, hands clenched around Sherlock's air jacket. He didn't expect an answer, and he didn't get one. He smiled and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's forehead, soaking wet and- disgusting? he licked his lips at a bitter, acrid, taste and gasped, the ships spotlight still flickering, illuminating them both- his ivory lover's skin blackened by a slick film of oil, which dripped from his curls, mixing with blood on his lips.
Moran giggled, hand stuffed in his pockets, looking over at the small, beautiful boy wrapped in his jacket. Sherlock blushed, looking over with a quizical look, looking down, a single cropped curl falling onto his forehead as they walked.
"J-Jawn," He keened before he collapsed into panting, crawling to the side of the bed and leaning his head back against the covers. "How did you-"
“Hello, I’m afraid I’m terribly lost, could you help me?” He said softly, and a dark haired girl gave him a quirked smile.
"Moved in?" Sherlock's cheeks flared pink as he brought his knees close to his chest, balancing the base of the phone between his legs.
He practically screamed as John continued, his knot begining to swell and his fingernails pressing cresent shapes into Sherlock's pale skin. He was ghastly oversensitive and each thrust felt like fireworks inside his body.
"Mycroft, he said once- I was-s a sociopath," Sherlock whimpered, his skin tingling and itching as John kissed his chin, his red hot ears receiving a few careful licks. "'cause I didn't love anybody, Jawn,"
Worried about what? Sherlock nestled back into John's warmth, tucking his nose into his neck and gulping down deep breaths of his strong and protective scent, and for maybe the first time in his life, he felt well and truly safe.
“The ‘Sorcerer Supreme’? Yes, Strange is a friend of Nakia’s.They say he’s magical but I am sure there is science behind it all. I’d love to figure it out but I’m busy with the new space program.” Everett filed away the
"His name is Sherlock," The solicitor's mouth hung open just the slightest bit and John tried to hide the gloat on his face. Male omegas were rare, and coveted among alphas- being exceptionally fertile and legendary bed mates. "I need to be sure he'll be my sole heir, and free to stay in my house." Mr. Carmichael looked at him quizzically, as if he had three eyes, before clearing his throat.
“S-so s-sorry da-addy, so sorry, please, daddy, I’ll be good, I won’t be rotten anymore, please, I’m so rotten, I’m s-so sorry, didn’t mean to, sir, didn’t mean to- to- to break the rules, sir, got scared daddy, couldn’t f-find you, please don’t kick me out, I’m so so sorry,” He blubbered and covered his face with his hands, shaking violently. He stilled instantly as daddy ran fingers through his hair, pulling Sherlock closer, petting him softly.
"I could tell," John smiled, fluffing his hair and Sherlock found his place on his shoulder, sighing satedly.
“Did you get all your stuff?” Ross nodded, blushing furiously from the kiss, setting Martin down. Marty sat and licked in between the toes of his paws. “You know, Everett, I uh, I want you to know that, that I do not take your care lightly, it’s in my bones to love and protect you, I don’t want this to be forced or awkward or unwanted,” Strange looked down at his boots, scuffing an imaginary spot on the floor. Everett reached and pulled his chin up to look at him, indigo eyes cavernous and blue.
"Hush," John snarled, biting at Sherlock's ear and pressing gently at the base of his throat as he finally got all the way in. "Put some work in, darling, it's my birthday after all," Sherlock swallowed and pushed himself up with trembling thighs before falling back down, impaled. He wasn't going fast enough, John's pheremones were weakening him, and he honestly felt quite dizzy.
"Well, you've left me burnt offerings," John growled, pulling Sherlock to his feet, and Sherlock gave him a glare.
Sherlock felt more tears down his face as John pulled away, eyes deep and glowing with a colbalt blue. He smiled, golden and warm like Mediterranean sunshine and pressed a final kiss to the crown of Sherlock's curls, lips brushing against the fabric of his silk scarf.
"What would Downing Street want with-" Sherlock's mouth hung open in realization, his eyes wide, chest tight with exasperation.
It wasn't Esther. This woman was battered, pale with frazzled hair, apron around her waist dotted with stains and patches. A bleary eyed toddler hid between her legs, poking his little head of curly blonde hair out of her skirt, looking up at Sherlock with shy blue eyes. On her hip was a baby, sobbing it's tiny lungs out, little knit cap slipping over it's ears.
