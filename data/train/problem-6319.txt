Getting to the town was a little difficult, since it was in the middle of the woods and he couldn’t just drive out there—no, they blocked themselves off from the rest of the world to try and keep some of their traditions alive.
"I understand. I'm not mad, Steve," Bucky said, keeping a tight grip on one of his hands. "They told me
And then the door closed, leaving Tony to ponder what was so wrong with the thought of someone marrying him. Were they pretending when they first congratulated him and Steve about the fact that they were dating, three years ago? Or did they just think that dating was one thing since it wasn’t technically permanent?
"You don't lie," Tony whispered, a dopey grin crossing his face as he closed his eyes. "...be scary if America's Golden Boy started lyin'..."
"I thought you... didn't want to come back. I thought you didn't want my help," Steve said slowly, not even sure of how to feel. Was Bucky here to stay, or was he just here to say something before he left again? He wasn't sure if he should feel joy or worry—was he finally able to relax and not have to go out hunting for his best friend, the man he thought to be dead for so long?
Steve watched as Iron Man shot off into the sky, back over to where there were several other people that he guessed were the Avengers. The multiverse? This place obviously wasn't his own world. He recognized Iron Man, Captain America and the Hulk among the heroes that were fighting off the 'DoomBots,' but he didn't recognize anyone else. There was a
Right then, Tony wished that Steve hadn’t gone on his morning run with Sam. If Steve was here, perhaps they wouldn’t be laughing?
in him, one that Steve had always admired so much. Those brilliant eyes of his reflected the stars, and Steve found himself getting lost in their profound amber depths.

There was a pressure on his hand that made Steve turn to the side. There, standing beside him, still holding his hand and looking at him with a worried, scared expression, was…
Steve barely had a chance to stand up before two people appeared from the rainbow colors of the portal. Tony ran over and attack-hugged him the moment that he laid eyes on the super-soldier. Clint, who'd had his bow strung and ready, lowered his weapon and hurried over.
"See? That's progress," Steve said, and Tony noticed a small smile cross the ex-assassin's face. "The good news right now is that Bruce gave you an all-clear—the serum you've got is slowly coming back, and the bullets are gone, and you're all stitched up. The only thing that's left is that arm of yours."
“I had a feeling that he wouldn’t have known,” Tony mumbled, looking back and forth between the two. “I can’t trust
"Sorry," he whispered, snuggling up against his super-soldier's warm chest. "Just thinking... Bucky needs the team just as much as I needed them... I want to be his friend, Steve."
“Actually, there’s something that I need to… that I should say,” Tony spoke up. “There’s been a bit of a situation here, a really tough, uh, family situation. And we may not actually be able to go through with any adoption at this point in time.” After a moment of silence, he added, “Can I call you back in three weeks, when the child is ready? Just in case?”
Wind rushed by him as he spun in circles down towards the ground. Everything was a blur of blue, green, blue, green as the sky and the land created a whirlwind of colors around him.
The fact that Tony was able to think that about himself made Steve's blood boil. The fact that Howard, a man who used to be a friend of his, was about to
that we're going to let them get all that technology out of this place," Tony said, trying to be as careful as he could as he bandaged up his teammate's leg. Clint winced in pain, gripping his bow tightly. "Sorry, Bruce is so much better at this..."
Thirteen days and no rescue. The real issue was that he wasn’t expecting a rescue, not for quite a while. If the Skrull was able to copy him so well, then no one would even know that he was gone. The worst part was that the
"Yeah," Bucky said, looking real smug as he flew over and landed on Clint's shoulder. "True love's kiss, that's how every fairytale ends. Bruce and Natasha went home yesterday."
Tony struggled violently, managing to kick his attackers in the legs, knocking them off of him. He could feel the effects of the drugs already working their way into his system, though he was able to face them with his hands up, ready to attempt to fight them off. It wouldn't

“Bring out the beast,” the man shouted, lifting the sword as the crowd cheered far louder than Steve had been expecting. It was a little shocking—these people were all so
“Sounds just like Tony,” Steve chuckled. He was always making such incredible inventions, ones that amazed him. Before they met, he didn’t realize that one man was able to be that smart, so… perfect.
Setting up his own search had been simple, but tracking down the super-soldier proved to be a lot harder. The whole team was helping out, but even with all of the help Tony was struggling with tracking down his and Steve's missing boyfriend.
"W-what if...?" Tony mumbled, biting his lip. What if Bucky realized after these two weeks away that he'd rather only have Steve, or he wanted himself and Tony to just be friends? What if Hydra brainwashed him again and made it so that he didn't even
like yourselves again," Clint commented, patting Tony's shoulder. "That's something, at least. Welcome back to the real world."
Bruce, on the other hand, had gotten the short straw, because he had been an ogre. That's why Tony had been prepared to attack him, because he'd already
When Steve woke up, all he could think about was Tony. He could hear Bruce and Bucky both trying to get him to calm down—the IV, don’t pull it out—this isn’t good for you—calm
The fire in his veins was out, leaving a familiar ache in his left arm. Familiar to the pain he’d just been in, but somewhat dulled by the fact that nothing was adding to that immense pain any longer. It was over, the pain was going to last, but he… he was alive?
Wait—the ‘mindless beasts’ were drawn to the forest? So there was a chance that Tony might be out in the forest? He knew what his teammate looked like, he wouldn’t mistake him for any other werewolves that might be running around in that forest. If he could get him back to the tower… then maybe they could help him.
The cursed man slowly stood up, untangling himself from the chains. Apparently Steve shouldn’t have taken his eyes off of the guy who had the sword, because he leapt forward and tried to rip the sword out of his grip. In the slight struggle, the only thing that the man managed to do was rip his clothes in an attempt to stab him, so the disguise fell to the ground to reveal his suit.
Tony wasn't exactly thrilled about Team Dinner that night, or any other night that he'd still be stuck in his aged body. He wanted his teammates to treat him like normal, not to treat him like he was in need of their help—because he
"Whenever Bruce finds the cure—we're not going to rush him, especially since... if it goes wrong..." Steve said, glancing over at Tony just for a second. Neither of them had mentioned a thing about what Tony had explained, about how if Steve hadn't been there that Tony wouldn't even exist anymore. "I just want to make sure everything's perfect first."
"I'll help him stress less," Steve murmured, taking ahold of his husband's hand. The statement confused Tony, but he liked holding Steve's hand, so he didn't complain.
"Bruce thought we should get you first... We're going for him next. I was far enough away that I didn't end up in another world..." Clint said, keeping an arm around Tony's shoulders as he turned to acknowledge the alternate versions of his friends. "Thanks for keeping him safe."
"Tony," the super-soldier whispered, eyes wide and sad. His husband quickly pulled him into a hug, pressing his face against Tony's shoulder and neck. "I-I didn't even
, sounded nice. As long as he didn't have to watch the sky for dragons that would take him back to its castle, like that one had been talking about when it grabbed Tony the first time.
"I hate sending them in alone as much as you do," Steve said, wandering over to sit beside him in the living room. "But you have to admit, they're all highly skilled and more than capable of handling this on their own."

to get you out before any more of them know I’m here. The rest of the team is guarding the way back over to the ship.”
His team was nice—despite him 'not being an Avenger' since none of them knew the truth, they still treated him like he was family. And Steve never tried to make him feel less for 'not being a superhero' like the rest of them. He was so used to being told what he was and what he wasn't—he wasn't good enough, he was never good enough, he was a playboy not a lover, a troublemaker and killer not a hero—but his team never treated him like that.
“They didn’t break you though—you’re strong, Tony. And we’ll always be there to help you,” Steve promised, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Just sit still while Bruce checks your wounds, okay?”
“I’ve missed you so much,” Tony whispered, pressing his face against his lover’s chest. “I thought that it would be months before I was going to go home. I thought that I was going to be beaten and locked away for
“Stark, come ‘ere,” probably-Bucky said, waving him over. Tony was a bit nervous, but Bruce and Steve led him over.
“No what?” Rhodey asked loudly as he shoved open the door, making sure to close it quickly. “Looks like they finally got you in a suit, huh?”
"I'm going to figure out how to show you eventually that I'm here, I love you, and I'm not going to be leaving you
"I would've preferred white hair any day," Steve said, and Tony couldn't help but smile and close his eyes as Steve's hands carded through his hair. It just felt so
"It's okay, you're okay, I've got you," Steve whispered, gently rubbing Tony's back until he ended up waking up.
When some of the other Avengers said that they ‘spoke a different language’ in the lab sometimes, Tony knew it was true. They just connected on another level, and working with Bruce was always incredible.
"You've already said that... many times," Tony replied as he continued down the path. All they needed to do was find Steve and Clint, and figure out a way out of this stupid fairytale. "It'll be over soon, Buck. All fairytales end the same way, right? True love's kiss? So you and Clint shouldn't have any trouble."
"Love you," Tony murmured as Steve settled him down in bed. He rolled over, and Steve gave him a quick kiss before he wrapped an arm around him.
, was it right for him to still be engaged to Steve? He’d always thought that the super-soldier could do better than him, but that wasn’t something he liked admitting to Steve, since his lover hated hearing stuff like that.
get home if I'm not here to make sure that you kiss my best friend, Tony. If I'm not positive that you're going to kiss Steve, then I'm not leaving. Got it?"
Bucky sighed, flipping the monitor off again. “I know they said there’s a chance that you’d never wake up again, but I know you. You’d never leave Tony behind, and one of these days you’re going to realize that what’s going on in your head isn’t real.”
"I can talk with Steve about it," Tony said, smiling when Rogers patted his shoulder and followed after them.
The worst part of the virtual world, though, was the fact that the man had built a monitor to make sure that the world was just as happy and wonderful as it was supposed to be.

"I was hoping that you were going to eventually tell us," Clint said. Steve began to wonder when everyone else was noticing and why

job, but you're falling asleep on your feet, Bruce," Tony said. "I don't even know how you're still awake right now."
"Bucky, get as close as you can to Hydra before showing yourself. And keep enough distance so that they can't use any of the technology against you," Steve said, holding onto the suit. He must've trusted Tony to take him exactly where he needed to be, since he wasn't paying any attention to where they were going.
Tony held his friend, offering as much comfort as he could. For the longest time Bucky had lost his best friend, and now that the two of them were back together they’d vowed never to let anything come between them again. Bucky had been part of the team for two full years now. They had

“I was so worried that I was going to lose you,” Steve whispered. He’d spent two days fearing what might’ve happened to his teammate, and then to find him captured by the townspeople and nearly killed? What if he’d come to town a little earlier, and had just
The blond was somehow able to get the bottle out of his hands and put it down on a table as he walked past, leaving Clint standing there trying to figure out exactly what had happened. Instead of pondering on that too long, he just turned and wandered back over towards the main room. The lights flickered as Tony apparently got the power plugged in.

But then things changed. Steve started going off for longer amounts of time, not coming back for days on end. When he did come back, he was injured, and there were some nights when he had to stay in one of the medical rooms. Tony usually slept in a chair beside his bed, or in the bed if Steve managed to drag him into it, but more and more often, he'd been heading back to
Apparently Hydra was trying to do some international weapons dealing with some mad scientist dude, and one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had managed to intercept a message. All available Avengers were sent out to put a stop to it. Of course, that just meant being in a foreign country where no one spoke English made everything a
“Tomorrow,” Tony agreed as Steve kissed his head and held him closer. “We’ll build our own family, Steve.”
"A few days doesn't seem so bad anymore," Tony said, crashing down onto the bed. The moment Steve had settled down, he rolled over so that he was face to face with his lover. Steve just smiled at him and snuggled closer. Why had he even been worried in the first place? Of course his husband would still love him. He never should've doubted that.
"I'm never going to think any less of you for being Iron Man, or for not wanting to tell anyone about it," Steve whispered, kissing Tony's cheek. "I know that it must've been hard, keeping that secret for so long, and... I really did mean to let you come to me, first, but you weren't moving, and I started panicking... I hope you realize how much I do love you, Tony, and respect you... I hope you realize that it'll be okay to tell the rest of the team, too."
Tony was a little surprised when Bucky put a hand on his shoulder. He had such a regretful look on his face. "I know I already apologized for the way I acted earlier," Bucky said sincerely, "but I really am sorry. I wasn't trying to make you feel like you weren't capable anymore, I just... I wanted to look out for you two—it wasn't going to be easy for either of you, and if I could make things a little easier... I'm sorry."
Those six words seemed to be enough to make everyone at the table feel uncomfortable. A silence fell over the team. Tony sighed,
"You usually tell us before you stay out late," Natasha pointed out as Tony tried to drag Steve back up to their bedroom.
reversible? When he'd said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Steve, he thought he'd have longer. His only response was, "I hate this."
“You don’t need to be worried anymore,” Clint said so genuinely that Tony couldn’t help but smile. “Never again, okay?”
"You were helping people," Steve pointed out. "You couldn't have guessed that they'd know you were there—and they chose an
the orange, red and yellow stones said, filling Steve’s vision with such brilliant colors, brighter than any star he’d ever seen. The warmth of the colors was like heat under his skin, starting at his fingertips and running up his left arm.
Tony barely even glanced over at Bruce when he walked into the room. After doing his routine check of the machines, he wandered over and knelt down beside Tony.
, and before Tony was able to close the door, Steve set his own briefcase down on the next table, startling the genius and making Tony nearly drop his briefcase as he turned around to face him, eyes wide and nervous.
"Nope," Iron Man replied. "The portal seemed unstable, so I'd guess if anyone else was caught in it, they'd be in another universe right now. Why, someone you wanted by your side?"
Instead of anything congratulatory, Clint broke out in laughter. The archer’s laugh cut through Tony like he’d been struck with an arrow, damaging but not completely breaking that good mood, that joyful excitement.
"I just... I just need to stay here with you two," Bucky murmured. He was still shivering, and Tony was pretty sure that it was because he was still terrified. "This is real, that's all I need to know."
"I should be the one thanking you," Tony said smoothly. "It's not every day that someone so handsome asks me out for dinner." He reached across the table, taking Steve's hand. "But really, Cap, thank you. It's been a pleasure, getting to know you and the Avengers."
"Once we find Clint, go home, okay?" Tony murmured, stopping on the edge of the forest. As dangerous as the forest could be sometimes, out in the open could be even more dangerous, as the group had already found out.
Clint chuckled as Tony scooped Steve up into his arms, flying him off towards the right to get him into place.
Tony noticed that Stark was sitting on Rogers' other side, holding onto his hand. He, on the other hand, had already let go. He wondered for a moment if the Tony Stark of this world was dating the Steve Rogers here. He guessed so, seeing the way that Stark was acting.
“Steve,” Peggy said calmly, standing up and walking over to him. Mary and Michael looked at him with wide eyes. “Steve, darling, back in the war… Bucky
"Clint and I were both assassins who worked for a secret government agency," Natasha added. "Bruce turns into the Hulk. Steve is the only goody-two-shoes on the team, and you're

—arm to grab the extra time machines that he’d snagged, already filled with Pym Particles. “I just need to know that you two got home safely.”
“I can’t—they’ll get you,” Steve said, gasping in pain when one of the bullets hit his leg. Cursing, he tried not to let Tony go, but Tony was struggling
“Give me some particles, give me some stones, we’re taking these back,” Tony argued, stealing the Pym Particles off of him before he could even move to defend himself.
There was a slight accusatory tone in his voice, like Steve wasn't thrilled that he hadn't stuck around. Tony could understand that—he left his husband at S.H.I.E.L.D. and went back to the tower alone. He
. "No problem—you guys know I'd do anything to help. But seriously—I need you to stay right there—those spots I marked out, don't move from them. At all. I, um, don't know what'll happen if you move. It probably won't be good, and I'm not sure how I'll fix it just yet, so... yeah. Stay still."
“It wasn’t a lie,” Steve said, the ‘voices’ still echoing with answers in his ears, only for him to hear. “It was a test, to make sure we would return, to make sure we would fix… The stones are back. They just wanted the stones to be back where they should’ve been, so a timeline wasn’t left without them. They’re too important to the fabric of the universe…”
“Stevie… I don’t know how you’re going to wake yourself up, but you need to do it sometime soon,” Bucky whispered, taking his friend’s hand. “Tony needs you now more than ever. You’ve got such an incredible life here, and you don’t even know that the one you think you’re living is fake.”
"Shellhead, stay close," Steve said when the armored Avenger struggled with close range fighting. He didn't argue, which meant that he knew that he needed some help. His teammate backed up, blasting one of the Hydra villains away from Steve, who offered him a quick thanks before more agents appeared.
"Thank you," Tony said, giving his husband a quick kiss before he could stop himself. Steve had kissed him several times thus far, but Tony was still worried about what he might've thought about the way he looked now. Steve still had that easygoing smile on his face, and he was still watching Tony with that same look of love that he'd always given him.
"They'll be fine," Clint said. When Tony stopped feeling uncomfortable about the whole situation, Clint seemed to stop feeling uncomfortable about it, too. "They're both too stubborn to let anything happen. Let them have some fun, Buck—Bruce is almost done with the cure, so this could be the last night they can go out together without anyone recognizing them."
“I’ve got time and mind,” Tony said, grabbing the two stones before Steve was able to fight with either of them.
." Bruce was practically vibrating with excitement as he grabbed both Steve and Tony's hands, trying to drag them over towards the lab.
Tony stared at the man who was sitting across the table from him. Steve Rogers, with a dark suit and gray dress pants, looking more like a nervous teenager than a strong leader of a superhero team. His hair was perfectly combed, shoulders squared, back straight. In a way, he almost looked like he'd been forced into the seat, even though
you'd want to fix my arm," Bucky said. He'd been at the tower for the past two weeks, and since there hadn't been a serious incident—and Steve still hadn't left him, that was a good sign—Tony decided that it would probably be a good time to fix up the man's arm. After all, he said he would, and the broken arm
did that hurt. Squeezing his eyes closed, Steve waited for the inevitable impact that came with crashing into the ground. By now Steve was barely able to breathe, chest aching too much, when something solid crashed into him.
"Right over there," Clint said, pointing to one of the larger trees that had a whole bunch of branches. It would provide good cover and a place for him to be able to balance a lot easier. "Why'd you mute the comms?"
“Of course I do,” Steve said, closing the door before he let his children lead him over to the kitchen. God, he loved them with all of his heart and was so thrilled to have them in his life. For a while he’d thought that they’d never settle down and have a family, but now? Now not only did he have a
Because of this, that kept the three superheroes confined to just being in the plane, seeing as Iron Man's flight was nearly completely knocked out. When the hole had been blasted in the side of the plane, that's when Steve knew they'd lost control of the situation.
"We need to do this more often," Steve said, smiling as he walked down the street hand in hand with his boyfriend. While Tony had seemed a bit anxious earlier in the morning, he was just glad to see that his genius had calmed down. Whatever was bothering Tony
Steve smiled, hugging Bucky tightly before he left. Jarvis alerted him that Buck would be under careful supervision, and that if there was to be an incident during the night, he would be detained accordingly. The AI promised Steve that every measure would be taken to make sure no harm was brought to Bucky if something
“Clint stopped by on his way to get some gym clothes,” Natasha said, nodding. “Everyone’s heard, I’m just surprised that you’re still sharing the same thing. I thought at least you’d try to come up with something new by now.”
"I thought it was pretty obvious," Bucky commented, and Steve glared at him when he noticed the smug look he had. "I mean, you take a lot of pride in that suit. I didn't think you'd let anyone else fly it. And I thought everyone knew... until no one said anything about it, and when I asked about Iron Man..." He shrugged. "Guess you guys
"Unless Clint wanted to tease Bucky some more," Tony chuckled, grinning when Steve leaned down to kiss him again.
how much they meant to him first!—it was all suddenly over. A flash, just as it had been last time. He was still standing, dazed, blinking rapidly to try and clear his eyesight as the bright light was suddenly gone.
Work seemed to go by in a blur. He couldn’t really concentrate all that much, and he didn’t remember most of what those generals and government agents were talking to him about. The only good thing about the day up until he left was the fact that there was a taste of blueberries on his lips, and… why did he like blueberries so much? It was familiar.
Tony, still looking shocked, raised his hands and put the helmet back on his head. Only a couple moments later, the rest of the team wandered out of the elevator. Bruce glanced over at them for a moment before dragging Steve over to the couch.
Sam Wilson, a friend that Steve had met and a man that Tony wanted to invite to the Avengers, was the one who was awake when Steve woke up. Tony had only heard about what he'd said, about how he'd chastised Steve for making Tony worry so much while still comforting his new friend after Bucky left again.
Captain America, he was just going to trap him in a fake world where he wouldn’t be able to escape from. If he died it was only because the Avengers had unplugged the machine.
"I'm sure," Iron Man assured him, putting an armored hand on his shoulder. "When I last spoke with him, all he could talk about was you." Iron Man chuckled, his robotic voice still sounding odd to Steve. He wished that he could meet the man inside the suit, because he knew that someone was piloting the suit, and that man he considered one of his closest friends. "You're still worried about the fire?"
Tony couldn't hide his smile as the two of them headed towards the lab. Steve understood him. He had nothing to worry about.
He nodded before blasting off into the sky again, not surprised that one startled person decided to shoot at him. Flying back over to where he'd left Clint, he hovered in front of the air as Jarvis disabled the shield.
young—it's a delicate process, but you didn't move at all, so... everything looks like it worked out," Bruce mused before turning his high-energy, caffeinated self onto Steve, narrowing his eyes as he observed the super-soldier. "Now you, Steve, are a lot harder to figure out, because everything
"You'll still be there? Great," Clint said. Steve could practically hear his grin. He'd been trying to get Iron Man to stay around the team more often, and Steve wondered if Clint knew Tony was Iron Man.
With his focus being near gone, Steve was surprised when suddenly Iron Man was in front of him, keeping him from getting shot by letting the armor taken the damage while Bucky took the men out.
"I don't really know if my world's Steve and Clint were affected or not... I was the closest to the portal, so..." Tony shrugged. He flinched again, grabbing his forehead. God, why'd he drink so much? He was a little surprised that this world's Steve—calling them by their last names might be easier—offered him a hand.
come to me—got it? I don't want this to be more difficult than it has to be," Bruce said, glancing back and forth between Steve and Tony, "for
He took a deep breath, reaching up to take his helmet off. He paused for a second, taking another deep breath. Steve glanced around, noticing the easygoing smile on Clint's face and the calm look on Natasha's face.
at his bedside, gripping his hand and gently cupping his face, murmuring, "It's okay, Tony, I'm here, you're safe, there's no reason to worry."
, Tony, I really am. But I'm going to make it up to you. No more searching. We're going to be spending more time together, as long as you want me."
It had taken two weeks for Tony, with some help some the team, to track the missing super-soldier down. Of course he was at one of the other supposedly abandoned Hydra facilities. They'd be getting him back soon, and everything would be okay.
night to try and hurt you." Steve leaned forward, pressing a light kiss to his forehead. "I should've been by your side, I shouldn't have let you out of my sight, then you wouldn't be here. Too much smoke to be good, plus whatever they drugged you with... Are you in pain? I can get Bruce back in here, he's been making sure you were going to be okay—"
Clint looked like he was ready for battle, bow aimed and raised from the moment he appeared. It only took a moment of looking around the room for him to put his bow down and run over to Tony, wrapping his arms tightly around the other man in a surprise hug.
Before Bucky could retract his words, Tony just crossed his arms and muttered, "Fine, I don't care anymore, I just wanted a damn pickle."
"Clint, I know you don't want to hear this, but I want you to stay back quite a bit," Steve said, stopping the archer before he was able to argue. "You're a master at long-range already, and you're wounded. The frontline is
Taking Hydra down side by side with the man he loved was something that Steve had dreamed about, before he even knew that Tony was Iron Man. There were times when he thought about 'what if Tony was Iron Man' because it would've been so much more convenient—he'd be able to keep his boyfriend safe, he'd be able to fight alongside someone he knew that he could trust and love... and while he'd always trusted Iron Man, it was different
“Alright, sap, up you go. I can take space back too, you’ve got enough to deal with, with that screwed up arm of yours,” Tony said, glaring at Steve’s arm like it was slowly killing him or something.
"It doesn't hurt anymore," Tony said quickly, taking the super-soldier's hand again. Steve was all teary-eyed, and he looked like he'd been crying earlier, like he thought that Tony really was going to die. He looked so
"I love you too," Tony whispered, that gentle, loving look turning devious as he looked Steve up and down. "Well, are you comin' over here or what?"
For a moment, Clint’s eyes widened, and his jaw dropped. For just a moment, Tony thought that his friend might actually say
“Yeah, I had to get up bright and early to show this off some,” Tony said, grinning as he held out his left hand, wiggling his ring finger. “Smooth, sleek and just my style, don’t you think?”
It felt like it was all his fault. There wasn’t a single thing that he could do that would make a difference, and being the genius that he was, he wasn’t ready to accept that. He
"Yeah, go on, laugh it up horse boy," Bucky muttered. "At least Clint and I have a way of getting out of here."
He'd been a bit worried that he'd only really connect with the Avengers, and their funder, Mr. Tony Stark, wouldn't want a thing to do with them, other than tote them around like trophies.

been so close. He'd been willing to have Steve let go of him when Bucky had turned up again, because he knew how in love Steve was with Barnes. But he and Steve had been dating for nearly two years at that point in time, and Tony was one hundred percent in love with the super-soldier. Apparently Steve was in love with him, too, because the blond didn't know what to do.
"Yeah," Tony murmured, though he didn't try to pull away from Steve. It felt so right, being able to hold the other man in his arms. They'd been dating for a while now, and now, with no huge secrets between one another, it felt like they really were
“I know you will,” Steve said, taking a step back. “Keep yourself safe, alright? No matter what happens, just know I
"There's a chance," Tony agreed. On the other side of the huge field... Tony looked up at the sky. Gryphons and dragons were both deadly things that had already tried attacking them, and they'd barely made it out of there
“No J, I’ve gotta tell them too. I can’t just tell half the team,” Tony grumbled, getting in the next elevator. “I mean, they’ve probably heard by now, but I’d rather be the one who tells them even if Barton or Banner has already said something about it. Might as well show off the ring, since
"You didn't mean that, Loki was messing with our minds... I know so, Steve, so don't even. I know that face," Tony mumbled, being the mind-reader that he was. "I got those words out of my head pretty quickly. It's just... no matter what I do, I can still hear Howard telling me how worthless I am, how I'll never be good for anything... Why would anyone want Tony Stark to be Iron Man when he's just such a big fucking mistake?"
The doctor glanced down before he quickly disposed of the needle. “You’re back, and you’re not… seizing… anymore. No—I do need to make sure you’re okay, but… I think we all need you to stay awake for a little while right now.”
"What happened?" was all that he was able to ask as he was surrounded, though it only took a few seconds to him to have space again as Bruce shooed everyone away, saying something about needing to check on him and Steve to make sure that everything's fine.
“I need… I need to make sure that you know something, okay? I need to make sure that you understand that Steve has never loved someone more than he loves you,” Bucky said, his voice strangely calm. That nervous look had turned pleading. “If he
He was hoping to get a room before the ritual so that he could change his clothes—yes, he looked like a civilian right now, but underneath those clothes he had his Captain America suit on. It was starting to get hot, but he could deal with that for a while.
This couldn't be happening. He'd been trying to figure out how to reverse the effects, but... but even if he
He'd always known that Tony was a good man, and he'd seen the hero inside of Tony many times, including during their first date when he was trying to save people from the fire.
"Tony, the Hulk and I aren't separate beings... He's known from the first time I met you as Iron Man," Bruce said calmly, offering a friendly smile. "I just figured that you didn't want anyone to know, so I didn't say anything... I'm glad you're ready to tell everyone." Bruce raised an eyebrow at him. "What's wrong? You look sick."
"Somehow you always manage to step in and save the day," Tony said, grinning when Steve just rolled his eyes and smiled at him.
Tony made sure that his back was to S.H.I.E.L.D. so that he could lift his faceplate. "A little fine dining? Is cheeseburgers fine dining enough?"
"I've got it," Bruce gasped, grinning wider than Tony had seen before—definitely not helping with that whole 'mad scientist' look.
"T-they... they keep putting fake memories in my head, Steve," Bucky cried. "I-I thought I'd seen you die, so many times, a-and... thank God you're here. B-but it wasn't... it
. He's strong," Steve said. He sounded like he really believed what he was saying, so Tony would believe him too. Bucky would be absolutely fine. They'd get him back to the tower, they'd patch him up if he needed medical attention, and then they'd drag him off to their bed and make sure that he didn't leave it for the next week.
The super-soldier rested his forehead against his lover's. Tony couldn't help but get lost in those eyes of his.
"Lucky for the team, then, 'cause it only made us old," Tony said, trying not to think of the alternative. "We're not dead, just old."
"Cap," Iron Man managed, and Steve turned his attention back to the battle, ricocheting his shield off the wall to knock an agent off of Iron Man. He knew that the armored Avenger was struggling when it came to close combat, since he was so used to being able to do aerial strikes and maneuvers. Inside the plane was causing him to struggle some.
It felt like it had been a lifetime since he’d seen Tony, since he’d been able to hold him and kiss him and protect him and
So he was used to looking around, making sure that people weren't watching them, taking pictures of them, glaring or sneering or just acting
Tony Stark was not a morning person. Everyone knew that. So when he strutted his way down into the kitchen that morning, it should’ve been a sign of something important, something special.
“You would’ve returned the stones and gone back to your daughter,” Steve said plainly, because that was all he wanted. He just wanted the people he cared for the most to be able to be
“You never hurt anyone,” Steve reminded him calmly, wishing that he could just drag Tony onto the bed and hug him. Tony glanced over at him like he knew what he was thinking. “I think everyone was a bit surprised at first, but you
“Stark,” one of the Skrulls said as it stopped next to his cell. “Not a word from you tonight. And cover your reactor.”
"I know you love me," Tony said, because it was the truth. He knew that Steve loved him. He wouldn't have married him and pledged
that you wanted to add. Ones that Clint might enjoy. Do I have to spell it out or do you think I’m lying?”
Steve sighed, an easy smile crossing his face. "Yeah... Would you, um, want to go out with me again? I can promise, the second one won't involve any drugs or attempted kidnappings."
"Please," Steve murmured, tightly embracing the shorter man. Tony just smiled, relaxing against his lover. He loved being able to touch Steve—he'd had some issues in the past with people touching him, or handing things to him, but with
‘funny’ about the fact that I am going to be marrying the man that I love as soon as we pick out which date works the best for us,” Steve snapped, glaring at each and every Avenger with a glare that stopped
," Tony chuckled, a little surprised by how angry Steve was. Maybe he could calm him down a little... "I'm guessing that your death-glare had something to do with it, right?"
"I'm still planning on taking you out once we get back to the tower," Steve said, giving Tony a devious smirk. That look did bad things to Tony. "I was thinking a little fine dining and then we could get some dessert at home. What do you say?"
He'd never really thought before about 'what if something happened that left me scarred or damaged or anything' before, until he'd suddenly became old. Then he couldn't help but think 'what if this can't be reversed,' or 'what if I'm in a horrible accident and I'm all messed up,' or 'what if I don't even look like myself anymore.' Those were all thoughts that had been spinning around in his mind during the past twenty-four hours.
the laser gunshot weapons that Hydra used, the ones that could cause burning and sometimes deadly wounds. No, those were just normal guns being fired. Glancing over at the commotion, he saw a group of the townspeople shooting at both Hydra and the two super-soldiers, who looked a bit shocked that they were being attacked, too.
"I'm not scared anymore," Tony said, throwing his shirt off into some corner. There was a confidence that had returned to his movements, a confidence that Steve had missed. He hated thinking that Tony would ever doubt the love that he had for him.
you leave, right?” Peggy asked, placing the cookies down onto the table before she wrapped her arms around him. Steve smiled and turned around, stealing another kiss from her as he placed a hand onto her enlarged belly. They were expecting their fourth child, and he was
Tony quickly nodded and let Bruce and Steve lead him down a couple more hallways. He had no idea how this ship worked, as every time he’d tried to escape, he just got beaten and tortured again. His teammates knew where they were going, they had to know, because Tony was putting all of his shaky trust in them.
Humming happily upon hearing those words from his lover, Steve tightened his grip a little before letting the sound of Tony's arc reactor lull him off to sleep.
Bruce rolled his eyes as he helped Tony over towards the spaceship, the moment that Clint saw Bucky, he raced over to the other super-solder and whispered something to him. Tony just leaned against Steve and relished in the fact that there
They barely even said hello to the team before they were off in their bedroom. Steve peppered soft kissed down Tony's neck and shoulders as they laid down onto the bed. Tony was fumbling with Steve's shirt, trying to get it over his head, but he didn't want to stop kissing his husband.
“You can either give the stone to me, or return it to Vormir,” Skull spoke up unhelpfully, making a throwing gesture.
"They're on their way," Steve said as he walked back over. "Bucky, I want you over by the weapons. Make sure that the scientist doesn't get out. I'm going to see if I can calm these people down. Tony, could you go get Clint?"
"So," the unknown guy said as they headed towards the kitchen. This place was so different than his own tower! "...Cap's in your world, and so is Hawkeye, but... I don't exist?"
It wasn't until the fuse blew and the portal shut down when Clint was able to stand up and hobble over into the main room to figure out what had just happened.
Tony rolled his eyes. "What, never seen a guy wear his lover's clothes before? I mean, his male lover's clothes? Might be a bit difficult to wear women's clothing... 'specially if you're larger than she is..."
just let me know what’s hurting,” not-Bruce said, putting a gentle hand on Tony’s face. “I’m going to get you patched up, okay Tony?”
"Maybe we can go somewhere far away, just the two of us, and enjoy some more time where people won't recognize us right away," he suggested, not wanting to hear that sadness in his husband's voice. Tony was finally starting to be comfortable in the body that he was in, and he didn't want him to be
“How long have I…?” Steve took a deep breath and looked his lover in the eye. “How long as this been going on?”
"We should go do a sneak attack," Clint said. Steve had already started drawing a map in the dirt of where everything was.
"I was waiting for you to tell me... There must've been some sort of reason as to why you didn't want to tell anyone," Steve said, shrugging. When the Iron Man suit opened, he offered the man a hand to pull him out. "I wasn't sure if you were just worried... that we wouldn't want you on the team, or what, but I know that
"And he doesn't want to be here. I... I can't force him to come back to the tower if he doesn't want to be here," Steve said calmly. He leaned down and kissed his boyfriend. "But that's okay, Tony. I'm not going to give up on being his friend, but I... I haven't been here for you. Last night you were alone in the lab, and I know why. If I was here, you would've been with me, not alone. And I'm
Steve didn’t move. He hadn’t moved in quite a while. Bucky had gone from angry—destroying everything in the gym—to sad—watching over Steve every moment that Tony wasn’t in the room, while he was still working himself sick and insisting that he could find a way to wake him up—to…
"I see," Bruce said, considering what Tony said for a moment before he added, "I'm going to trust you on the fact that it's nothing too bad. I'd tell you to avoid strenuous physical activity for a while, but I'm sure you already know that. Working in the lab—I know you're going to hate me for this—should only happen under supervision or not at all. A lot of what you work on is either very heavy or potentially dangerous, and you're not in the best... condition, to deal with that right now."
It looked more like a doorframe than anything, but Tony had designed it, so of course it was going to work. Clint just wanted to see it in action.
But it wasn't only Tony he was looking out for. It was Steve, too. He'd thought in the beginning that Tony wasn't the best guy to be around—he did do a bunch of research on the guy, after all. Again, he was a
He spent most the time he spent with Tony flirting back and forth with the other man, trying to figure out if Stark was teasing him or actually being serious. He flirted with most people, but he seemed to flirt…
"I'll be up soon," Steve promised. The words made him feel relieved in a way that he hadn't been expecting. He gave a slight nod before hurrying out of the room, not looking over at Bucky once as he exited.
"Well, since you didn't know most anyone else, this is Edwin Jarvis," Iron Man filled in, upon seeing his look of confusion. Iron Man reached up, and Steve was confused for a moment before he realized that Iron Man was taking his helmet off.
Leaving Clint to scold Bucky about going to medical, Tony headed back over to where Steve was trying to calm the people down.
There was a pressure that started growing in his head, but the instant he snapped his fingers, Steve found his world engulfed in a black nothingness.
Tony nodded, and he actually looked like he’d understood this time. In fact, he looked like the past several days hadn’t happened, like he was the same Tony from before the curse. “I love you too, Steve. And I do want to try this. It’ll be a bit difficult with me… turning into a werewolf every now and again, but…”
“It’s nothing,” he murmured, smiling at her. “They’ve just been a bit more frequent lately, that’s all. “Ever since I… I took the plane down.”
He made sure to keep an arm around Tony's waist. Eventually his boyfriend would be able to tell him about being Iron Man, and he wanted Tony to know that he still trusted him. He threw his other arm around Clint's shoulders.
"People might try to hurt you to get to me," Steve pointed out. "Or to get to the team... We all care about you, Tony. Plus, you're a billionaire. I know you used to train with other people in case anything bad happened. I won't go easy on you, if that's what you're worried about."
"We're landing in two minutes," Clint called from the pilot’s chair of the plane. Natasha, Bruce and Sam were all towards the front of the plane, too, letting Steve and Tony have what little privacy they were able to have.
“And I do believe that one day he’s going to wake up,” Tony said. “I’ve accepted it, Buck—one day he
really been able to just enjoy a day without the thought of getting recognized. If anything, the thing that got them attention was the fact that they were 'such an adorably cute old, gay couple who were able to show their love for one another despite it not being allowed back in the day,' which Tony personally thought was hilarious though Steve definitely understood it. Growing up in another century did have some differences, and Tony kinda liked how traditional his husband could be sometimes. Steve just loved that he didn't have to hide that part of himself anymore.
He looked so earnest, and there was a hint of that sorrow still in his features, like he'd thought about what would've happened had Tony taken the full blast.
need time together away from them. When Tony looked at his husband, he realized that Steve still had those beautiful blue eyes, just as always. He had the same smile, the same laugh.
you should put in the arm to make it more useful,” Bucky said as quietly as he could, and Tony grinned because he knew exactly where Bucky was going with this one. “…and you suggested that I might as well have a bit of fun with it, so there were some, uh,
"We should go out to dinner tonight," Steve suggested, looking around. "We haven't got out for a team dinner in a long time."
"Of course we will be," Bucky replied. "The issue is these two. You'd think that once they found out what they had to do, they'd listen. It's simple enough."
"Apparently not," Tony muttered, offering a hand. Clint looked exhausted by now—they'd been fighting Hydra for quite a while, seeing how many agents they'd brought along, and once the villagers started firing they were forced to retreat. For the time being, at least.
"I'm going to do so much better Tony, you'll see," Steve whispered as Tony fell asleep, safe in the arms of the man that he loved.
to think that they can laugh at the fact that I’m marrying my better half,” Steve said, pulling Tony into a tight hug. “If you won’t yell at them and tell them off for doing that, then I will. You mean
at his future husband in his perfectly-tailored white suit. His blue eyes popped against the white, and once again Tony was glad he’d insisted that Steve wear white.
"I know that Tony has a bit of a history with being a playboy, but... I don't see him as someone who would cheat on me, or anyone," Steve said, noticing that the rest of the team was leaving Fury's office. He and Iron Man had talked with him earlier, and they were just waiting for the 'all clear' to go home. "He's so loyal, and brave and caring, even if he tries to deny it. He's such a brilliant man, and I just... I really care about him, more than I'd been expecting. I'm really glad he gave me a chance."
“Tony… did they mess with your arc reactor? Were they… did they try to remove it, or break it?” Bruce asked quietly as he wrapped a blanket around Tony’s shoulders.
“I’m not falling for it again,” Tony said stubbornly, metaphorically putting his foot down. At least, he
And then the briefcase was opened, and Steve could feel their energy. This is why Vormir had been his first destination. The gauntlet seemed to attract the stones like they were made to be placed in it.
Bucky made Tony stop watching the virtual simulation. In that world, Steve didn’t know that anything was any different. He believed that the world he was in was the real world, because of the way that the simulation was set up. It was like he’d never been frozen, he’d never met the Avengers…
"Stand down," Tony said, trying his best to copy Steve's commanding 'Captain America' voice, "or else you might get hurt."
"How do I look, doc?" Tony asked, though he really didn't need to. His team had all had positive reactions, so he guessed that he looked just as he used to.
"Until we meet again," Tony said, grinning at the two, who just smiled back knowingly. Tony took Clint's hand, to make sure that they both ended up in the same place.
“Not everyone is happy with that,” Peggy muttered. “You know, Stark called me again, wanting to show you more of those crazy inventions that he was making.”
"I know," Tony groaned, which just made him feel worse. He knew that he needed to be nicer, but he just couldn't handle the situation and no one was letting him have any alone time. Normally he'd just go to the lab and work out his stress, but now? Now it was too
The way that Clint winked at him told Tony that he'd seen the look that he had shared with his husband, and he was just trying to give the two of them some space. Clint was
,” Tony replied. It was easy to see his self-hatred, and it hurt Steve a little. He hated that Tony could never see how wonderful of a person he was, and now that he had to deal with the fact that he was cursed, too. “If you hadn’t been hurt, I might’ve attacked you too! But you were just a hurt human, a-and then I had a chance to recognize you, and then the team was there so it was easier to recognize all of them…”
He was safe, his teammates were really themselves and not aliens, and he was on his way back to the tower. Life couldn’t have been better in that moment. If an invasion came next, they’d be prepared, as long as they were all together, as a family. He slowly drifted off to the sound of Steve’s beating,
"Sit," he commanded, and Steve knew not to argue. He let the doctor start cleaning off the blast wound as the rest of the team filed over, crashing down onto the couches and chairs.
"If I'd been quicker, then he wouldn't have almost been kidnapped, he wouldn't have inhaled too much smoke..." Steve sighed. "So you think he enjoyed the date, before the villains showed up?"
Things got very bad, very quickly when Steve’s whole body seized up, and he seemed to hold his breath—or he was choking. Tony was trying to keep him still, and there was this horrible feeling inside that this might be the last time he’d ever see Steve alive.
“It’ll be okay,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice from sounding as shaky and broken as he felt. This was the real world, that other world had been a simulation. “Tony… I need you to know how much I love you, how I would’ve been awake sooner if they wouldn’t have taken you out of my life. You’re
The super-soldier crashed down onto their bed, rolling over to make room for Tony. He then reached out like a child who wanted to be handed something, giving Tony his best puppy-dog eyes when Tony didn’t immediately jump into bed with him.
"Tony, you need to get out of here too," Steve insisted, trying to usher him towards the door. He shook his head, and went to try to help some people who were having trouble getting out without being trampled or hurt.
"I wasn't going to come back," Bucky said, hanging his head a little. "Not until I figured out for myself who I was... and while I'm not ready to be back, I..." Bucky's right arm had been across his body, and Steve had just thought he'd been holding his mechanical arm. When he moved his right arm, though, there were two large gunshot wounds in his side. "The arm broke, I was injured, and I... I didn't know where else to go."
Steve gripped Tony tighter. This had to be real, this had to be real. But after the last simulation… this
“Please, darling, it’s not a problem,” Peggy said, giving him a quick kiss. “I’ll do that, you just go relax. You’ve had a long, hard day at work. It’s the least I could do as your wife.”
For the longest time, Bucky had been told what he was and what he wasn't—he was an assassin, a weapon, not a human, he didn't have free will, he was a bad person, he wasn't Bucky Barnes—except he didn't have
Tony, on the other hand, learns something new about the family that he's not even sure he's ever going to have—something that makes him hold onto hope even more. The real issue is that the system might be failing, and if it does, Steve will be lost forever.
"That might work," Tony mused, and once more there was a sparkle in his eyes that told Steve he could relax. It was nice, being able to go out somewhere with just the two of them. He did miss Team Dinner, and he knew that Tony did too. At dinner, they'd been talking about their team like they were their
Rogers reached out, and Tony let the blond put a hand on his shoulder and then slowly pull him into a hug.
His head hurt again. He wasn’t entirely sure why he was getting such bad headaches, but it had been happening more and more frequently in the past couple… couple… days? Weeks? He wasn’t sure. He couldn’t be sure exactly how long he’d been having these horrid headaches, but they were starting to make him see things.
Tony looked just as he did before he had died, so full of energy and vengeance and strength. There was this desire to
him, they found out very quickly that ‘forcing him’ to do anything wasn’t going to happen. “I’m too busy with the family to go to war right now. You guys need me more than they do.”
Tony pressed his face to his husband’s chest, for the first time actually letting himself cry over the fact that Steve was awake and in his life, that Steve had remembered and chosen him over the family that he could’ve had in the simulation. He’d been so strong and optimistic the entire time, and now? Now he was able to just let it out.
There was a moment of surprise on Clint's face before the shield-generator that Tony made kicked in, stopping his punch long before it got close to Clint. He moved back, raising his hands before he shot a couple repulsor blasts, all deflected by the shield.
"Okay, come on. You need to sit down, and I need to get this armor off," Stark sighed, and Steve settled down on the couch as the man removed the suit. Jarvis had informed them that he'd made some food, and to get to the dining room when the rest of the Avengers showed up.
Tony flinched a little when Clint ran past Steve, though he relaxed as the archer pulled him into a tight hug.
"You're just jealous," Steve chuckled, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist, pulling the genius a little closer so he could rest his head against Steve's shoulder.
"Where do you want to be?" Tony asked, muting his and Clint's comms. as they looked around for the best tactical location.
The wires were ripped right out of the machine that was currently attached to Steve’s head, disconnecting him from the simulation in the only way that Tony
“I know,” Tony said, smiling at him. It wasn’t like he was going to lie to Bucky—he knew Steve loved him, and he knew that Steve would choose him over Peggy. Did Bucky think that he
Steve was right. They got home quickly, Bruce refused to let them leave until he'd had a chance to make sure that Bucky would be fine, and the rest of the team managed to get Steve and Tony over to the kitchen to get some food before they were allowed to smuggle Bucky off to their bedroom.
"I'll build you a new arm," Tony promised, kissing the injured shoulder. Bucky just smiled and leaned over to kiss him, though he was unable to put an arm around Tony because he was still missing one. With his right arm he was gripping Steve's hand like if he let go, he'd find out everything really was just a dream. While Tony wanted to be able to hold Bucky's hand, he could see how tight Bucky's grip on Steve's hand was and knew that if it was his hand, it would already be broken.
I mean, the way you talk about Iron Man sometimes would make anyone think that you're in love with him."
Tony gripped Steve’s arm tightly when the ship took off, flinching horribly when the ship started moving. He couldn’t help it. Last time he was on a spaceship it was because he was being kidnapped. He couldn’t help the shiver that shook his body so badly.
"If you hadn't tried to block that blast..." Tony took a deep breath. "Jarvis and I ran through the calculations and... I'm only here today because you stepped in, Steve. It affected the super-soldier serum differently, and because you tried protecting me from the blast... I would've been aged out of existence, Steve. Gone. Dust. Just..." He knew his hands were shaking, because the thought of just being
Tony just rolled his eyes. “Okay, big guy, you can let me walk myself out of here from now on. Don’t act like you don’t know what you did.”
But that was okay, because eventually his team would come to get him. Eventually they’d figure out where he was being kept. Eventually he would be home again.
"Yeah," Tony mumbled, glancing away. Maybe he shouldn't try to act like a pain in the ass—maybe Steve
“Steve? Steve, can you hear me? What did you do, what did the hell did you do?” It was more than just hands touching his skin. Icy cold drops were hitting his skin, and it took a moment to recognize those as tears.
Marriage? It wasn’t something Tony ever thought he’d do. Why get married? Before it was because he was a playboy, and then it was because he was a superhero living a dangerous life. He didn’t have time to date until Steve came around, and then… well, he never thought about marriage. There was always a chance of dying out on the field, but…
"Tony?" Rogers spoke up, fear evident in his voice. He took a step towards him, but Tony just shook his head and glared at his dimensional double.
As wonderful as they worked together, though, a dangerous situation was a dangerous situation, and he was on edge.
"They love you," Steve argued, crossing his arms. "There's no way that you can possibly say that they don't, because you know that's bullshit. The team loves you, nearly as much as I do."
It was only a couple more moments before Bucky and Clint appeared, though instead of kissing sweetly, Bucky had Clint in a headlock while Clint looked like he couldn't stop laughing.
“I’m not going to let them laugh, Tony. That’s not fair to you, because you’re one of the greatest things that has
"Could you imagine a world without him?" Tony said, chuckling. Fury didn't seem to realize that when he let Tony become the caregiver for the Avengers, that also ended up with them listening to him far more than they listened to Fury anymore.
"You're in one of our medical rooms," Steve said. Tony watched him, confused, because while this man looked like Steve... "We weren't expecting you to just fall out of the sky like that."
Now, he never really managed to put his trust in anyone other than Phil, who gave him that second chance, and Natasha, who he'd paid it forward to. But they were the only ones that he'd ever really managed to bond with. But now, with the Avengers and Tony, he felt like he finally had the family that he'd spent his whole life wanting, never able to achieve.
“I missed you guys,” Tony whispered, for the first time in two weeks feeling even remotely safe. His team
He shuffled a little closer, and Steve wrapped an arm around his waist. Days ago, he wrapped an arm around Tony and glared at other people who tried flirting with him to make sure that everyone knew that Tony was
He was so happy for the both of them. He'd wanted his friends to be happy, it was all he really wanted for any of them! That's why he was still trying to hook Bruce and Natasha up—he could
now, and you haven't said a thing about it to me?" Tony snapped, though he still didn't look angry, only scared.
be. Whenever he felt so helpless, it was hard to hide secrets inside. There wasn’t anywhere to hide them when people could see right through him, so why hide?
"Of course he is," Steve said. "I'd be surprised if there was a Tony Stark in some world who didn't share the same good looks."
"Maybe," Steve said. He didn't even have the decency to hide that smug look, either. "Is it working?"
As the Skrull lifted him up ever so gingerly and started carrying him out of the room, Tony let himself lean against the alien’s chest. After all, if he was going to be ‘rescued,’ then he was going to at least enjoy being carried around. At least he got to see Steve’s face again.
"Calm down," Bucky murmured, cutting off Steve's mad ramble. "I get it, you really like the guy. Me being here at the tower isn't going to hurt that, right?"

better with it than he is. If I wasn't sent off ta war, I would've become a mechanic so I could work on all those high-end, expensive-looking cars."
He knew that it devastated Tony, seeing Steve so happy with someone else. Getting him to turn the monitor off had been the best decision. It was hard for Bucky to not turn it back on, though, and see exactly what was going on. In that virtual world, Steve had the family that Bucky knew he always wanted. He had Peggy back—not
