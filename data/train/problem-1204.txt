Sherlock, inflamed by indignation which this malevolent allusion to his father excited, hesitated for some moments, in a confusion, which highly gratified his brother. At length he said, 'My father's pride, Sir, had a noble object—the happiness which he knew could be derived only from science, knowledge and charity. As it never consisted in his superiority, in point of fortune, to some persons, it was not humbled by his inferiority, in that respect, to others. My father despised persons, who, with the opportunities of wealth, rendered themselves miserable by vanity, ignorance, stupidness and cruelty. I shall think it my highest glory to emulate such pride.'
'But, when Signora Irene was afterwards seen in the castle, did nobody speak to her?'
“Nice cup of coffee,” Sherlock replied, somewhat mendaciously.
The air refreshed him, and he continued at the casement, looking on the shadowy scene, over which the planets burned with a clear light, amid the deep blue aether, as they silently moved in their destined course. He remembered how often he had gazed on them with his dear father, how often he had pointed out their way in the heavens, and explained their laws; and these reflections led to others, which, in an almost equal degree, awakened Sherlock’s grief and astonishment.
The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;
The Count, meanwhile, having slowly recovered, the first object he saw, on raising his eyes, was Sherlock, bending over him. Wilkes surveyed him with a look of anguish.
They now determined to pass the night with the Holmes family; and as the chateau was not large enough to accommodate their servants, the latter were dismissed to the neighbouring village. When the first compliments were over, and the arrangements for the night made, M. Anderson began the display of his intelligence and his connections; while Sherlock, who living in a small society found these topics recommended by their novelty, listened, with a degree of patience and attention, which his guest mistook for the humility of wonder. The latter, indeed, described the few festivities which the turbulence of that period permitted to the court of Henry the Third, with a minuteness of detail, that somewhat recompensed for his ostentation; but, when he came to speak of the character of the Duke de Joyeuse, of a secret treaty, which he knew to be negotiating with the Porte, and of the light in which Henry of Navarre was received, Sherlock soon perceived that Anderson could be only of an inferior class of politicians as well as of intellect; and that, from the importance of the subjects upon which he committed himself, he could not be of the rank to which he pretended to belong.
Sherlock was surprised and alarmed, at the secrecy which this man seemed to think so necessary, and hesitated whether to meet him, till, considering, that he might scarcely be in more danger from the meeting, resolved to go.
“I’ll head back too,” Sherlock announces to the group. “Come along, John.”
Beyond Milan, the country wore the aspect of a ruder devastation; and though every thing seemed now quiet, the repose was like that of death, spread over features, which retain the impression of the last convulsions.
'It is very odd!' said Bertolini. 'Here is really no stranger in the room. If it is a trick, Signor, you will do well to punish the author of it severely.'
.  Thankyou to those of you who left a comment or kudo already - this is actually my first fanfic *blushes* and the first time I have written for pleasure in more than 10 years, so you guys have really made it extra-special.
Twilight came on, before the abbess's kindness would suffer Sherlock to depart, to be reconducted by La Voisin through the woods, the pensive gloom of which was in unison with the temper of his mind.  He pursued the little wild path, in musing silence, till his guide suddenly stopped, looked round, and then struck out of the path into the high grass, saying he had mistaken the road. He now walked on quickly, and Sherlock, proceeding with difficulty over the obscured and uneven ground, was left at some distance, till his voice arrested La Voisin, who seemed unwilling to stop, and still hurried on. 'If you are in doubt about the way,' said Sherlock, 'had we not better enquire it at the chateau yonder, between the trees?'
“Hard to see everything from this elevated position, of course. Explains some of the uncertainty in the model,” said Sherlock loftily.
The sun, at length, set behind the western mountains; his fiery beams faded from the clouds, and then a dun melancholy purple drew over them, and gradually involved the features of the country below. Soon after, the sentinels passed on the rampart to commence the watch.
“John, what an
Have yourselves some more mountainous castle action, coming to you this time from San Marino:
Where every face was innocent and gay,
Sherlock looked impatient to be gone. 'I entreat you, Count, to consult your own safety,' said he in a bored tone, 'and linger here no longer.'
O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!
Short stature might be alright for being a gymnast, he thinks sourly, but it’s bloody rubbish for trying to find someone in a crowd. It’s started to rain a little and John looks around him but it’s just a sea of uniforms and camera flashes.
: To Thoulouse.
'I have your pardon to beg, sir,' said he, 'for a rudeness, which you will readily believe was quite unintentional. I did not know, that the Chevalier was your acquaintance, when I so freely criticised his dancing.' Sherlock blushed, and Monsieur Mycroft spared him the difficulty of replying. 'If you mean the person, who has just passed us,' said he, 'I can assure you he is no acquaintance of either mine, or my brother’s: I know nothing of him.'
John looks over at Sherlock a moment. He looks wrecked; leaning up against the wall with his eyes closed and curls starting to reassert themselves from the hair gel. Mrs. Hudson is still nattering away as the photo group breaks up (“Vin buv strachenyy, Kateryna! Take polehshennya!”).
“Oh, no, wait, I want another selfie!” complained Mary, following after him.
'This is very strange!' said Sherlock, still trying to recollect the past.—'Perhaps I have deleted it?’ he said questioningly, looking at Molly.
It’s peculiar to Sherlock how tense the atmosphere is; how much he feels it, how involved he actually is. How much he wonders about what John must be feeling, looking at him pacing and stretching down on the side of the floor as his horrible roommate, the one with the awful girls, sits hunched over with a towel over his head, staring at the floor.
“Oh my God, Bill, tell me. Was it that awful?” John looked imploringly at his long-time training partner and roomie from the London Olympic village.
The man laughs briefly. “You’re very loyal, very quickly.”
'Now he would compel me to sign away my settlement (it was well I had the chief of my property settled on myself!) that he may lose this also, or throw it away in wild schemes, which nobody can understand but himself? And so he has treated me with neglect, with cruelty, because I refused to relinquish my settlements, and, instead of being frightened by his menaces, resolutely defied him, and upbraided him with his shameful conduct? But I bore all meekly,—you know, brother, I never uttered a word of complaint, till now; no! That such a disposition as mine should be so imposed upon! That I, whose only faults are too much kindness, too much generosity, should be chained for life to such a vile, deceitful, cruel monster!'
'To be sure I should, ma'am,' replied Molly, 'and would not you be glad too, to see him? I don't know any chevalier I like better, I have a very great regard for Signor Watson, truly.'
Though no longer suffered to doubt that they were addressed to himself, he was as ignorant, as before, by whom they could be written. While he mused, he thought he heard the sound of a step without the building, and catching up the violin, hurried out; but nothing could be seen. Eventually he turned his steps in the direction of his parents, whom he found seated on the grass of a small hill, overlooking the vallies and plains of Gascony.  While their eyes wandered over the glorious scene, and they inhaled the sweet breath of flowers and herbs that enriched the grass, Sherlock played several of their favourite airs.
“‘Mycroft’ is the name you gave me, if you could
'And only for my recovery?' said Wilkes, with a sigh. 'For your……. general welfare,' added Sherlock.
“Oh! Well, it’s from Don Quixote, the ballet, you know John?”
Sherlock shrugged. “I was dancing in a ballet company in France until a few years ago, but I left. Was at a bit of a loose end and then my brother heard that FIG was going to incorporate male rhythmic gymnastics at the next Olympics, and my brother… strongly suggested I look into it. He knew of a British coach that had had to leave Russia rather suddenly after the London Olympics. Met up with Hudders, started training, and, well, here we are,” said Sherlock, indicating the arena with a flutter of his hand.
“Look at these boys of mine,” says Sieger fondly from behind John’s shoulder. “Geniuses, you know. But utter morons, the pair of them.”
Hold each strange tale devoutly true.
, John thought gloomily.
, it’s a 19.425 and that’s huge, it’s fucking astronomical, no-one will catch him; Sherlock will win the gold medal. The crowd is going nuts; Sherlock’s face on the camera looks stunned, shocked stock-still with Mrs. Hudson sobbing into his shoulder; and John’s face is wet too, but it doesn’t matter because Sieger and Violet and Mycroft all have their arms round him crying joyful tears into his hair and who minds anything when an Olympic gold medal happens to the love of your life?
Well,
John darts to and fro on the roof of the trailer, but the only way up looms sheer and smooth before him. There’s only the width of the trailer for a run-up, two and a half metres at the most.  Even John, with his short legs, covers it in two bounds before he’s hurling himself at the wall, pushing off the walls surface with one foot, then one foot and one hand, before his left hand comes up to scrabble desperately at the roof ledge. The muscle memory saves him, the hours and hours of bodyweight training kicking in and he is up and over the edge, shoulder muscles howling as he flops face first onto the roof, thinking,
'Why no, not a prisoner; but one must be glad to see him, you know. And it was only the other night I dreamt—I dreamt I saw him drive into the castle-yard all in a coach and six, and dressed out, with a laced coat and a sword, like a lord as he is.'
Here's a
“No sock, no room. Now piss off!” said Bill, slightly smothered in Nataliya’s eager embrace. “And what are you doing with all my rubbers?”
“We watched along live,” said Sarah, nodding at the huge TV in the room, “they just had the American coverage though, so we didn’t see all of yours and Mike’s routines.”
'You distract me, Signor; suffer me to plead my own cause; you have already proved insufficient to it.'
Pins!
'Ah, my Sherlock!' replied Holmes, 'for thy sake! Well—I hope it is so.' They travelled on, among vineyards, woods, and pastures, delighted with the romantic beauty of the landscape, which was bounded, on one side, by the grandeur of the Pyrenees, and, on the other, by the ocean; and, soon after noon, they reached the town of Colioure, situated on the Mediterranean. Here they dined, and rested till towards the cool of day, when they pursued their way along the shores—those enchanting shores!—which extend to Languedoc. Sherlock gazed with enthusiasm on the vastness of the sea, its surface varying, as the lights and shadows fell, and on its woody banks, mellowed with autumnal tints.
Mons. Anderson talked apart to Moriarty of his own affairs, in his usual strain of self-importance; boasted of his new acquisitions, and then affected to pity some disappointments, which Moriarty had lately sustained. Meanwhile, the latter, whose pride at least enabled him to despise such vanity as this, and whose discernment at once detected under this assumed pity, the frivolous malignity of Anderson's mind, listened to him in contemptuous silence, till he named Sherlock, and then they left the portico, and walked away into the gardens.
“Bien. I must go back to my seat. Perhaps I shall see you both about the Village? Good luck, anyway!” finished Victor in a rush as Mike jostled past him to resume his seat.
“Let’s see… oh! 17.283!” John looked back to Sherlock, who looked smug.
'You doubtless believe this music to have some connection with the chateau,' said Sherlock suddenly, 'and are, therefore, superstitious.' La Voisin greeted this remark with silence, and Sherlock occupied himself with the possibilities thus implied.
out of the 5 teams so far, briefly meeting John’s eyes. Fortunately, John was saved from having to respond by the entry of the Japanese team on to the floor.
Holmes had given no directions concerning this picture, nor had even named it; Sherlock, therefore, thought himself justified in preserving it. More than once remembering his father’s manner, when he had spoken of the Marchioness of Lestrade, Sherlock felt inclined to believe that this was her resemblance; yet he could deduce no reason why he should have preserved a picture of that lady, or, having preserved it, why he should lament over it in a manner so striking and affecting as had been witnessed on the night preceding his departure.
'But all this was told me for a great secret,' rejoined Molly 'and I am sure, ma'am, you would not hurt either me or Benedetto, so much as to go and tell it again.' Sherlock remained silent, and Molly repeated her last sentence.
For some time he was lost to every thing. When he, at length, roused himself, he perceived, before him, on the terrace below, the figure he had formerly observed, which stood fixed and silent, immediately opposite to his casement. On perceiving it, he started back, and terror for some time overcame curiosity;—at length, he returned to the casement, and still the figure was before it, which he now compelled himself to observe, but was utterly unable to speak, as he had formerly intended. The moon shone with a clear light, and it was, perhaps, the agitation of his mind, that prevented him distinguishing, with any degree of accuracy, the form before him. It was still stationary, and he began to doubt, whether it was really animated.
John had now obtained leave of absence from his regiment when he made the excursion into the Pyrenees, which was the means of introducing him to Holmes; and, as this permission was nearly expired, he was the more anxious to declare himself to Sherlock's family, from whom he reasonably apprehended opposition, since his fortune, though, with a moderate addition from Sherlock’s, would be sufficient to support them, would not satisfy the views, either of vanity, or ambition. John was not without the latter, but he saw golden visions of promotion in the army; and believed, that with Sherlock he could, in the mean time, be delighted to live within the limits of his humble income. His thoughts were now occupied in considering the means of securing an address with Sherlock’s family, as he was entirely ignorant of Sherlock's precipitate departure from Bakersfield.
John guffaws. “Him? Have you met him?”
“Shut up, Bill, what do you know about it,” John grumbled. “I need to eat. Protein shake or something.”.
'No, that I will be bound they did not; but I don't know: shall I go and ask, monsieur?' said Molly, moving hastily towards the corridor.
, and it was founded by a Count in atonement for murdering his own son, which is the the stuff of gothic fiction and no mistake. It's still occupied by a religious community today.
“DONOVAN!!” screeched Anderson from down the row. Really, thought John with a sidelong glance at Mike, something ought to be done.
'Why all this terror?' said he, in a tremulous voice. 'Hear me, Sherlock: I come not to alarm you; no, by Heaven! I love you too well—too well for my own peace.'
Sherlock's mind was refreshed by sleep. On waking in the morning, he looked with surprise on Molly, who sat sleeping in a chair beside the bed, and then endeavoured to recollect himself; but the circumstances of the preceding night were swept from his memory, which seemed to retain no trace of what had passed, and he was still gazing with surprise on Molly, when the latter awoke.
John pushes himself up onto his knees, watching them swim in front of his eyes. He is swaying, staggering to Sherlock; but the man in black is pushing up onto the aircon unit, head catching Sherlock in the stomach and they go over the side and out of John’s line of sight.
As the hour of appointment drew near, his impatience increased. At length, the sun set; Sherlock descended out on to the first terrace, where the sentinels demanded who passed; and having answered, walked on to the east rampart, at the entrance of which he was again stopped; and, having again replied, was permitted to proceed. He stepped hastily on in search of Barnardine. He was not yet come. Sherlock leaned pensively on the wall of the rampart, and waited for the porter. The gloom of twilight sat deep on the surrounding objects, blending in soft confusion the valley, the mountains, and the woods, whose tall heads, stirred by the evening breeze, gave the only sounds, that stole on silence, except a faint, faint carousing of distant voices, that arose from within the castle.
He’s with a group of other Brits yet apart from them, aloof and self-contained. Hands buried in his jacket pockets, the bright lights of the stadium reflect different casts on his skin; red, green, yellow. There’s just the hint of a smile on his face as he draws closer to John.
John looks incredulous. “Why?”
In the morning, Sherlock found Mycroft nearly in the same condition, as on the preceding night; he had slept little, and that little had not refreshed him; he spoke only a few words, and never named Moriarty, who, however, soon after, entered the room. His husband, when he understood that he was there, appeared much agitated, but was entirely silent.
Moriarty paused, and turned half round, but, seeming to recollect himself, he proceeded in a lower tone.
Shall no tear wet her grave?
'Till I receive Monsieur Sherlock Holmes's permission to accept your indulgence,' said he, falteringly, with a step towards Sherlock—'till he allows me to hope—'
Here's a bit of spooky Musgrovio action - courtesy of Gwrych Castle in Wales this time.
'We have now little time to waste in exclamation, or assertion,' said Sherlock, endeavouring to conceal his emotion: 'if you are yet to learn how – how I – how dear you - no assurances of mine can give you conviction.'
He withdrew willingly from his presence; but the thought of passing the remainder of the night in a chamber, which the door from the stair-case made liable to the intrusion of any person, now alarmed him more than ever, and he determined to call at Mycroft’s room, and request, that Molly might be permitted to be with him.
'Dear sir, you have eat nothing at all! Do try, and take a little bit more. And at Tholouse too I have heard my master talking of you and Mons. Watson to Madame Merveille and Madame Vaison, often and often, in a very ill-natured way, as I thought, telling them what a deal of trouble he had to keep you in order, and what a fatigue and distress it was, and that he believed you would run away with Mons. Watson, if he was not to watch you closely; and that you connived at his coming about the house at night, and—'
, he thought. So, he did a somersault instead, but it was messier than Sherlock’s because he couldn’t reach the ocean floor.
'I called you here,' resumed Mycroft, 'to tell you, that I will not be disturbed in my own house by any letters, or visits from young men, who may take a fancy to flatter you. This M. Hotson—I think you call him, has the impertinence to beg I will permit him to pay his respects to me! I shall send him a proper answer. And for you, Sherlock, I repeat it once for all—if you are not contented to conform to my directions, I shall give up the task of overlooking your conduct—I shall no longer trouble myself with your education, but shall send you to board in a monastery!'
'He is dead!' Sherlock muttered to himself,—'murdered!—his blood is on the stairs!'
Bill and Mike smirked at John as he tried to formulate an appropriately professional response. But Knight was still going – “and I heard they just have condoms lying around in bowls on the tables? And you just grab them? Is that true? And I heard people have sex in the ice baths? And in the…”
“Could go either way Kate. Showed strong scores on this apparatus during qualifying and again in the all-around, and he did take the bronze in this event in last year’s world championships in Glasgow. He’s never beaten Moran in competition though, but we’ve seen plenty of thrills in the competition so far, it certainly wouldn’t be the first upset.”
John raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, look,” said Sarah, poking at her phone. “Look at this,” and slides the device over, the screen lit up with the blue-haired American swimmer standing in front of a beach. Sherlock leans in close as the video plays and they strain to listen to the video’s crap sound quality in the noisy hall.
“I beg your pardon?”
As John’s name is called and he steps forward to be introduced to the crowd, Sherlock is quite sure John can’t see them, the bright lights staring down from the ceiling will surely prevent those below from seeing anything in the stands clearly. But he claps anyway. His mother is watching him and it wouldn’t do to displease her again.
“Is that your Instagram you’re looking at?” asked John, casting about for more conversational topics while Sherlock looked studiously at his toast.
The grey of morning had long dawned through his casements, before Sherlock closed his eyes in exhausted slumber; when wearied nature, at length, yielded him a respite from suffering.
'But, before you go,' rejoined Sherlock, 'let me ask you - Have you been in my brother's dressing-room, since you left me?'
(See the end of the chapter for
about the medals given out at Rio - they are hefty - 500g (about a pound) in real life.  You did indeed get a
Shortly John was summoned to join his brother officers, and he accompanied a battalion to Paris; where a scene of novelty and gaiety opened upon him, such as, till then, he had only a faint idea of. But gaiety disgusted, and company fatigued, his troubled mind; and he became an object of unceasing raillery to his companions, from whom, whenever he could steal an opportunity, he escaped, to think of Sherlock. The scenes around him, however, and the company with whom he was obliged to mingle, engaged his attention, though they failed to amuse his fancy, and thus gradually weakened the habit of yielding to lamentation. Among his brother-officers were many, who added to the ordinary character of a French soldier's gaiety some of those fascinating qualities, which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the features of vice into smiles. To these men the reserved and thoughtful manners of John were a kind of tacit censure on their own, for which they rallied him when present, and plotted against him when absent; they gloried in the thought of reducing him to their own level, and, considering it to be a spirited frolic, determined to accomplish it.
Twist!
though John, fists clenched on his knees.
“Oh, shit,” says John, who grabs him by the shoulder and rolls him into the recovery position, rubbing Sherlock’s back as he sucks down lungfuls of air and coughs.  “It’s OK,” John says, at least half to himself, “you’re just winded,” and then more businesslike: “did you lose consciousness?”
The tone and look of surprise, with which this was uttered, recalled Sherlock's prudence; who controlled his expression once more, and bade Molly lead him to the picture. It was in an obscure chamber, adjoining that part of the castle, allotted to the servants. Several other portraits hung on the walls, covered, like this, with dust and cobweb.
Sherlock frowns at the fingers. “Two.”
It was unnecessary to call Molly, whose lamentations were audible upon the first approach to the gallery, and who, bewailing her own and Hopkins's fate, told Sherlock, that she should certainly be starved to death, if she was not let out immediately. Sherlock replied, that he was going to beg her release of Carlo; but the terrors of hunger now yielded to those of Moriarty, and, when Sherlock left her, she was loudly entreating, that her place of refuge might be concealed from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock, whose heart trembled at every word, endeavoured to turn the conversation from John, by enquiring the name of the lady, with whom he danced; but, before the Count could reply, the dance concluded, and Sherlock, perceiving that John was coming towards him, rose and joined Monsieur Mycroft.
Sherlock stared. John began to giggle, back against the wall, hands clutched over his chest as he laughed. Sherlock slumped against the counter, unable to fight the answering snigger that turned into a chuckle, a laugh, a guffaw. It was as if something broke loose in his chest as looked at John, laughed with him.
His figure and address made him a welcome visitor, wherever he had been introduced, and he soon frequented the most gay and fashionable circles of Paris. Among these, was the assembly of the Countess Sawyer, a woman of eminent beauty and captivating manners. Her suppers were the most tasteful of any in Paris, and were frequented by many of the second class of literati. She was fond of music, was herself a scientific performer, and had frequently concerts at her house. John, who passionately loved music, and who sometimes assisted at these concerts, admired her execution, but remembered with a sigh the eloquent simplicity of Sherlock's songs and the natural expression of his manner, which found its way at once to the heart.
Sarah is being dressed into her costume for the next routine, her coach fussing with the fit while Sarah holds a heat pack on her injured knee. Mary is sat on the floor, puffy red jacket obscuring her costume, earbuds in as she looks at her phone.
Within a few days, Mycroft, as he had promised, gave a magnificent entertainment to a very numerous company, among whom was John; but at which Madame Petitbois excused herself from attending. There was a concert, ball and supper. John was, of course, Sherlock's partner, and though, when he gave a look to the decorations, he could not but feel anger at the rememberance that they were designed for other festivities.
The stadium absolutely explodes in sound, and John pulls back and looks around “What was that??!”
“No offence mate,” said Bill, raising his hands in the air, “just interested in how we’re all growing up, that’s all. Was a bit different back in London village, Sherlock, you see,” Bill continued, John feeling Sherlock stiffen next to him. “Little Three Continents here got around.”
Sherlock, who instantly alighted and went to his assistance, found John still sitting on his horse, but bleeding profusely, and appearing to be in great pain, though he endeavoured to soften his apprehension by assurances that he was not materially hurt, the wound being only in his shoulder. Sherlock, with the muleteer, assisted him to dismount, and he sat down on the bank of the road, where Sherlock tried to inspect the wound.  Anxious to bind up the arm, Sherlock called for his father to bring him bandages.   Receiving no answer, he went to the carriage, and found his father sunk on the seat in a fainting fit.
“Well, if you do happen to keep up this…association beyond the Olympiad, I’d be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
“Not to worry Johnny… plenty of talent here,” reassured Murray with a speculative look out over the crowd.
In the hall, confusion and tumult still reigned. Sherlock, as he listened anxiously to the murmur, that sounded along the gallery, sometimes fancied he heard the clashing of swords, and, when he considered the nature of the provocation, given by Moriarty, and his impetuosity, it appeared probable, that nothing less than arms would terminate the contention. Mycroft, having exhausted all expressions of indignation, remained silent, in that kind of breathless stillness, which, in nature, often succeeds to the uproar of conflicting elements; a stillness, like the morning, that dawns upon the ruins of an earthquake.
“It’s not me, John, it’s Sarah.”
'Nay, pr'ythee, good Molly, stay not talking,' said Sherlock in a voice of agony—‘we must go, and see who it is.'
exciting, especially like this in a group - five women in spangly outfits, bending themselves in half before gracefully expanding into some flying leap, long ribbons twirling madly. So why did John’s gaze keep sliding off the floor and out into the crowd?  Why ignore the obvious talent below in order to search for a head of dark curls?
, Sherlock thinks.
Oft seen in charnel-vaults and sepulchres,
“Well Irene, he looks cool and collected, a small smile on his lips as he assumes his starting position for his last routine in this historic final, the first gold medal competition in men’s rhythmic gymnastics. The music begins and – my God, Irene-”
“Piss off,” replied Sherlock succinctly.
“Scores for the rings, Zanetti, the local favourite through, certain to have two Chinese athletes qualify in the next subdivision; and now the parallel bars, Watson finishing just behind Moran at this point, although with strong competition from Russia and Ukraine in this event we may see that slip a little. So four, potentially five gymnasts in the individual apparatus finals, excellent result for the men.”
“Mmm... the Ballet National de Marseille,” replied Sherlock absently. “I’m older than I look, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
He continued to play, till Molly brought dinner into the chamber, at which Sherlock was surprised, and enquired whose order she obeyed. 'My master’s,' replied Molly: 'the Signor ordered his dinner to be carried to his own apartment, and so your brother has sent you yours. There have been sad doings between them, worse than ever, I think.'
Sherlock comes face to face with one of the more well-known aspects of Olympic Village life.
Thus passed the time, till twelve o'clock, soon after which the distant sounds, that murmured through the castle, ceased, and sleep seemed to reign over all. Sherlock then seated himself at the casement, where he was soon recalled from the reverie, into which he sunk, by very unusual sounds, not of music, but like the low mourning of some person in distress. As he listened, he became convinced, that the former sound was more than imaginary. There were several rooms underneath, adjoining the rampart, which had been long shut up, and, as the sound probably rose from one of these, he leaned from the casement to observe, whether any light was visible there. The chambers, as far as he could perceive, were quite dark, but, at a little distance, on the rampart below, he thought he saw something moving.
“Thank you, John. Miss Hawkins, the clubs.”
After a moment's hesitation, Holmes again stopped the carriage, and waited till he came up, that they might enquire concerning the hamlet they were in search of. The stranger informed him, that it was only half a league distant, that he was going thither himself, and would readily shew the way. Holmes thanked him for the offer, and, pleased with his chevalier-like air and open countenance, asked him to take a seat in the carriage; which the stranger declined, adding that he would keep pace with the mules. 'But I fear you will be wretchedly accommodated,' said he: 'the inhabitants of these mountains are a simple people, who are not only without the luxuries of life, but almost destitute of what in other places are held to be its necessaries.'
Holmes, when he was told that company were expected, felt a mixed emotion of disgust and indignation at the insensibility of Anderson, which prompted him to return home immediately. But when he looked at Sherlock, and considered that a time might come when the enmity of his uncle would be prejudicial to him, he determined not to incur it himself, by conduct which would be resented as indecorous, by the very persons who now showed so little sense of decorum.
'Well! but pray inform me what I am to contradict.'
These excited not only the envy, but the trifling ambition of Monsieur Mycroft, who, since he could not rival the splendour of her festivities, was desirous of being ranked in the number of her most intimate friends. For this purpose he paid her the most obsequious attention, and made a point of being disengaged, whenever he received an invitation from Madame Petitbois, of whom he talked, wherever he went, and derived much self-consequence from impressing a belief on his general acquaintance, that they were on the most familiar footing.
'I thank you for your pity, Molly,' said Sherlock, interrupting her; 'You may take away, Molly, I have done.'
'Well,' said Sherlock, 'proceed.'
Sherlock looked again from the window, and saw a young man spring from the bushes into the road, followed by a couple of dogs. The stranger was in a hunter's dress. His gun was slung across his shoulders, the hunter's horn hung from his belt, and in his hand was a small staff, which, as he held it, added to the manly grace of his figure, and assisted the agility of his steps.
“And the first competitor tonight Irene is Sebastian Moran – coming up to the apparatus now with his coach, and look at that laser focus. It’s as if he has no nerves at all.”
'The road from this hamlet,' said John, 'and that to Beaujeu, part at the distance of about a league and a half from hence; if you will give me leave, I will direct your muleteer so far. I must wander somewhere, and your company would make this a pleasanter ramble than any other I could take.'
“Well, what’s so important that you need to miss the game for?” John freezes. He’s made it this far into his plea, but he’s now at a roadblock. He needs an excuse.
Desperately trying not to laugh, John looks over at Sherlock again who is still gazing at the dessert. The trifle-intelligence experiment must not be going well, as there is a tiny smear of cream at the corner of his mouth. John’s tongue licks out unconsciously.
“Is that a crude fellatio reference, Watson, because as your roommate, there are some things I do not want to… ow!”
The flip side of not being able to see anyone is that you can get a bit sneaky if you need to, and John slowly meanders backwards in the crowd of athletes, avoiding the ushers shooing athletes along the avenue of flags. With a bit of ducking and weaving and a dash of strategic side-standing and flag-waving, John soon sees Sherlock walking towards him.
'It is a subject of some interest to you, undoubtedly,' rejoined Moriarty, 'and I think you must see it in the light that I do; indeed it will not bear any other. I trust you will agree with me, that any objection founded on sentiment, as they call it, ought to yield to circumstances of solid advantage.'
He was jolted back to reality by Sherlock giving a round of applause next to him, John joining in out of instinct more than anything else. Good thing too, as Mary was walking over to them, puffing with exertion. “Hello boys!” she said cheerily, standing over them. John pushed himself to his feet, returning the greeting even as he realized he had no idea what to say next. He looked down at Sherlock and extended a hand, pulling the taller man to his feet.
'Yes' replied Roberto; 'but if I had not, what I saw was enough to have frightened the Pope himself.'
THE MINSTREL
'He is dying, monsieur, my master is dying!' said she.
John has spun round on the bars and bent over a little, waggling his bum at Sherlock. Left, right, up, down.
: Poor, poor Sherlock. Strange and terrible events continue in the Castle of Musgrovio.
'Who was the prisoner?' enquired Sherlock, while his thoughts glanced back to the circumstance of the preceding night.
'Nay, brother mine, it cannot be denied, that you have pride enough; your father, had his share of pride too; though, let me add, his fortune did not justify it.'
“Oh look, the gang’s all back together,” said Sherlock from behind him, low and dark. John makes a vaguely affirmative sound as he marches off to the table, sliding his tray next to Molly’s, which is by happy coincidence about as far from Bill as he can get.
As the travellers still ascended among the pine forests, steep rose over steep, the mountains seemed to multiply, as they went, and what was the summit of one eminence proved to be only the base of another. At length, they reached a little plain, where the drivers stopped to rest the mules, whence a scene of such extent and magnificence opened below, as drew even from Monsieur Mycroft a note of admiration. Sherlock lost, for a moment, his sorrows, in the immensity of nature. Beyond the amphitheatre of mountains, that stretched below, whose tops appeared as numerous almost, as the waves of the sea, and whose feet were concealed by the forests—extended the campagna of Italy, where cities and rivers, and woods and all the glow of cultivation were mingled in bright confusion. The Adriatic bounded the horizon, into which the Po and the Brenta, after winding through the whole extent of the landscape, poured their fruitful waves. Sherlock gazed long on the splendours of the world he was quitting, of which the whole magnificence seemed thus given to his sight only to increase his regret on leaving it; for him, John alone was in that world; to him alone Sherlock’s heart turned, and for him alone fell his bitter tears.
‘Indeed, Molly!’ exclaimed Sherlock with a questioning look.
I'm from Australia and getting changed under towels is a useful skill, because you don't always have a trustworthy mate (or your parents, for small kiddies) to hold up a towel between you and the car.
It’s quite hard to kiss someone while walking along; it’s hard to coordinate the lips while noses and chins are in motion. It doesn’t actually work until John grips Sherlock’s chin in his hand, flag pulled across this chest as he leans and touches his lips to Sherlock’s.
“And the score is a 15.75, just behind the Irishman Moran, marvellous job from the veteran competitor.”
“Oh, dear, I wouldn’t be so sure about that.”
It’s a beautiful night outside; dusk is falling but the warmth of the day still lingers, and with it the slight salty tang of the ocean. For having spent two hours sitting watching other people compete, John is exhausted; and from the look on Violet and Sieger’s faces, they are feeling it too. John’s legs feel a bit wobbly, but Sherlock’s parents look like they are holding each other up as they wave off Mycroft a few paces away. They’re then immediately spied by a BBC camera crew and John watches a few paces away as they are interviewed for the folks back home; teary, gushy and so, so proud. John feels as if the smile will never leave his face.
John watched the head of dark curls flounce off towards the exit.
He would have left the spot immediately, had he not been conscious, that this conduct would have shewn John more obviously the interest he held in his heart. The Count was continuing: 'The lady,' said he, 'dancing with that young Chevalier, who appears to be accomplished in every thing, but in dancing, is ranked among the beauties of Tholouse. She is handsome, and her fortune will be very large. I hope she will make a better choice in a partner for life than she has done in a partner for the dance, for I observe he has just put the set into great confusion; he does nothing but commit blunders. I am surprised, that, with his air and figure, he has not taken more care to accomplish himself in dancing.'
. I’m just fucking sitting around and there’s no idea who this guy is, he could be whacking people left right and centre for all we know and I’m just…” she threw her hands up “…sitting around.”.
John shows off his medals to the media, before running back to the Arena to try and see some of Sherlock's qualifier. How will Sherlock fare? And will what happens afterwards change everything between them?
“Well, John, amazing footage there of your historic two gold medals from yesterday, how does it feel watching that?”
Sherlock, considering that he had no appeal from this will, forbore to dispute his right. 'While my brother lived, sir,' said he, 'my residence here was not improper; but now, that he is no more, I may surely be permitted to depart. My stay cannot benefit you, sir, and will only distress me.'
'Yes, let him come,' cried Wilkes furiously, 'and brave MY resentment! Let him dare to face once more the man he has injured; danger shall teach him morality, and vengeance justice—let him come, and receive my sword in his heart!'  His darkened countenance expressed all the rage of jealousy and revenge; and a person, who had seen his features under the smile of overwhelming tenderness, which he so lately assumed, would now scarcely have believed them to be the same.
“A what?”
'I have been impatient,' said the Count, addressing Sherlock, 'to express my gratitude; to thank you for your goodness; but I must also thank Signor Moriarty, who has allowed me this opportunity of doing so.'
The gaiety of the most splendid court in Europe, the magnificence of the palaces and entertainments which surrounded him,—conspired to dazzle his imagination, and re-animate his spirits, and the example and liquors of his military associates to delude his mind. Sherlock's image, indeed, still lived there; but it was no longer the friend, the monitor, that saved him from himself, and to which he retired to weep the sweet, yet melancholy, tears of tenderness. When John had recourse to it, it assumed a countenance of mild reproach, that wrung his soul, and called forth tears of unmixed misery; his only escape from which was to forget the object of it, and he endeavoured, therefore, to think of Sherlock as seldom as he could.
At that moment, the steward comes up to Sarah and gives her the three-minute notification: get her ribbon ready, she’s on next.
Let's talk Rhythmic Gymnastics (RG)!  At the Olympics it is only one of two sports competed only by one gender (the other is synchronised swimming), and they are both women's sports.  The athletes complete four routines each with different apparatus: hoop, ball, ribbon, and clubs.  In lower levels they also compete with the rope.
John rears back as if struck, and stares at Sherlock for a moment. “Naaah,” he says eventually, carefully getting to his feet. “Wonder why?”
'O Heavens!' exclaimed Sherlock—'what have you done?'
After supper, his brother sat late, but Moriarty did not return, and he at length retired to rest. If Sherlock had admired the magnificence of the saloon, he was not less surprised, on observing the half-furnished and forlorn appearance of the apartments he passed in the way to his chamber, whither he went through long suites of noble rooms, that seemed, from their desolate aspect, to have been unoccupied for many years. On the walls of some were the faded remains of tapestry; from others, painted in fresco, the damps had almost withdrawn both colours and design.
Sherlock, on hearing this, shrunk with a superstitious dread entirely new to him.
Moriarty turned, with a stern countenance, to Sherlock, and bade him quit the apartment, while his husband persisted in desiring, that Sherlock would stay. Sherlock scarcely knew which action would serve best his interests, when 'Leave the room,' said Moriarty, in a voice of crazed threat. Sherlock obeyed, and, walking down to the rampart, which the strangers had now left, continued to meditate on the unhappy marriage of Mycroft, and on his own desolate situation, occasioned by the ridiculous imprudence of his brother, whom he had wished to respect and love. Monsieur Mycroft’s conduct had, indeed, rendered it impossible for Sherlock to do either.
The mood was gone after that. John sat low in his seat, arms and legs crossed as he attempted to focus on the second and final rotation. Each time he turned to Sherlock at the conclusion of a routine, the taller man was perfectly still, fingers steepled under his chin, only his eyes moving as they followed the darting movements of the gymnasts and their apparatus. Each passing routine only increased John’s sour mood when Sherlock refused to meet his eyes at the end of it, capped when Sherlock stood at the conclusion of the fourth routine and abruptly left the arena, not looking back to where John stared open-mouthed after him. Not even Mike and Anderson’s terrible dancing along to Ukraine’s routine to ‘Vogue’ could cheer him then.
It was a bit harder to find official footage of the pommel horse final, but in
One asylum, however, would still be open to him France. He thought that he could board in the monastery adjacent to the convent that contained the remains of his late father. Here he could remain in safety and tranquillity, till the term, for which Bakersfield might be let, should expire; or, till the arrangement of M. Motteville's affairs enabled him so far to estimate the remains of his fortune, as to judge whether it would be prudent for Sherlock to reside there.
“Sherlock! Have you seen my bag? I forgot it!” She runs over to Sherlock and the dancer crouches down, a smile on his face.
As he’s waiting, he looks into the crowd. He sees familiar faces from various places across campus. Molly, his lab partner in biology, stands with a group of friends, all oozing of school spirit in their green and white colors. He sees a few of his own teachers at the front of the audience leaning against a metal railing and cheering on their students. He sees a head full of curls wearing a jersey that John recognizes as his own practice jersey.
He spins, and spins, and spins, and spins, his hair becoming a beautiful tornado atop his head. Sherlock falls to the floor and John’s heart drops a little, until he realizes it’s the end of the performance. The curtain begins to close and John’s the first one to stand up, clapping loudly and shouting praises. Sherlock stands up and takes in the view: a standing ovation. He bows and runs off the stage. The applause doesn’t stop. The curtain is fully closed now, then some music begins playing over a speaker. A woman starts reciting names into a microphone as ballerinas rush onto the stage to bow and wave to the crowd. They come up in groups of three or four, until Sherlock’s the last to be called. Of course, the crowd grows louder and John’s smile grows wider. He watches as Sherlock takes the hands of the girls still remaining on the stage and takes another bow, the smile on his face somehow wider than John’s.
They dance along, their posture rigid, and they form a small huddle towards the back of the stage- a more graceful version of a rugby huddle, John notes with a smile. They break apart.
With those last words and a few more “Thank you”’s, John leaves the office and walks back to his dorm. He could cry with happiness, but instead he just picks up his pace and sneaks back into the room, falling asleep quickly with a smile still lingering on his face.
“Thank you. I don’t care about the game, I just care about you and me right now.”
And that’s the last thing he sees before the ball collides with his face, his nose making a sickening popping sound as the crowd simultaneously lets out a distressed noise. It takes a moment for John to process the pain. It’s only when Sherlock disappears behind the group approaching him that he lifts a hand up to his nose. When he removes it, he sees blood. Everything happens in flashes next. He sees snippets of the crowd craning their necks to get a better look of the incident. Lestrade, red-faced and huffing is a few feet away arguing with the official over an “unfair call”, as he describes it.
“John! What’re you doing here?”
“She’s a delightful woman,” John comments, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s waist and placing a light kiss on his lips.
“Barely,” Sherlock replies as John sits down next to him. “You?”
Minutes later John’s finally at the front of the line, handing the usher his ticket and making his way towards the auditorium. Almost every seat is filled. He had ordered his ticket first thing in the morning after talking to Lestrade, and by some sheer luck, he landed a seat only five rows back in the center section.. The people in the row stand up as he smiles and squeezes his way through to his seat. The smell of flowers is overwhelming, but John doesn’t mind. He just stares forward at the red curtain, watching feet scurry back and forth.
“And I love you for that.” Sherlock lowers his voice for that as the two walk across the courtyard. “But I know how rough the team can be, and they won’t let you live down the loss.”
“Why do you want to look at my feet? Is there something I should know about you?” John laughs and rolls his eyes, then sinks to the floor and goes into the bag.
“You’re alive?”
John can’t breathe. Lestrade just looks at him.
“Oh, it’s so lovely to finally meet you! Sherlock’s talks about you so often, it’s lovely to meet the infamous John Watson. I’m Mrs. Hudson, by the way, Sherlock’s instructor.” Mrs. Hudson extends a frail hand then laughs, pulling John into a warm hug. “Sherlock told us that you attended our showcase the other night? What did you think of it?”
Sherlock inches his body closer to John’s and rests a hand on his shoulder.
One fall night into his second year he finds himself sneaking out of his dorm room, trying as carefully as possible to close the window without waking up his three other roommates. He shivers, an intense mixture of the cool night and his nerves. He’s about to do something he’ll probably regret, but it’s worth the risk. This means a lot to John, more than anything ever has, rugby included.
“Of course. I’ll see you next week then.”
“You can never miss a game, ever,” the coach threatens, his face looming over John with an intensity he didn’t even know could be reached. Coach Lestrade is one of those men who tries to live out his glory days vicariously through his players. Once again, John doesn’t mind. As long as he gets to play. While the rule creates an overwhelming amount of pressure on John’s studies, he does just as his coach says. Every day he’s either in the gym exercising or running laps on the fields. Every week, he finds himself squinting under the harsh lights of the stadium, his name being chanted from his fellow peers as he dashes across the field.
“You can have it,” he says, extending the ball out towards John, who gets flustered by this and instantly feels bad, but he takes it anyway. He doesn’t know that this moment will change his entire life. The power he feels resting in his hand as he walks back home is just a prelude to the new John Watson, the one who decides to take residence for many years to come.
Sherlock looks at John with fear in his eyes. John just smiles at him in return and pulls him by the hips into a deep kiss, this one meaning more than any other kiss the two had shared.
“I’m just a decent player, I don’t know if I’d go that far.”
“Yeah, I know. But it was worth it.”
“It was absolutely lovely.”
John’s taken back by this, a look of confusion on his face. “I am, yes.”
“I talked to Lestrade beforehand, and he was fine with it.”
“Please stop reading me, Sherlock.” John knows exactly what thing his boyfriend is referring to. He loosens his grip and winces as he unclenches his fist, his fingernails leaving half-moon dents in his palm.
“It was so nice meeting you, John. Please, stop by again soon, dear.” John is so stunned from the interaction that Sherlock has to nudge him with his elbow to make him reply with a quick “You too, Mrs. Hudson!” as the teacher disappears through the front door. The two are silent for a moment, then break into fits of laughter as they process the conversation.
John runs his hand over the banister in familiarity as he follows Sherlock up a minute or so later. He turned to the right and heads down the hallway towards the last room. He knocks twice on the open door and Sherlock snaps his head up, a smile creeping onto his face.
John can breathe again. To say the sentence aloud feels great. He wouldn’t even mind saying it again, so he does. He wants to scream it across the dance studio, his words penetrating the glass and spreading down the street. He wants every pedestrian’s ears to echo the sentence, every shop to stream it over the speakers. But instead he settles for another repetition of it, this time adding “And I love him.”
“John, that’s probably illegal.”
“Rugby players aren’t known for their dance moves.”
And oh, does it make John feel good. He forgets the constant pains in his shoulders even as he collides with players twice as big as he is. After every game he feels his entire body buzzing as he rides out the high of the win; the losses still seem to feel like wins to him.
John instantly finds himself sitting up straighter as Sherlock emerges from the crowd. He’s dressed in a tight black body suit, his silk pink shoes glowing with the light. His face is serious as he makes his way towards the front of the stage, his eyes closed in concentration. John thought on his way here that he’d have to restrain himself from jumping up in cheering. But in the moment, John is frozen, his body numb as he falls into a trance watching Sherlock dance.
A larger group of girls arrive on the stage, creating chaos as puffy white skirts run around. Amidst this chaos, John sees Sherlock, his eyes now open and scanning the crowd. For a half a second John believes he’s looking directly at him, a small smile appearing on his face. But then a line of girls passes in front of him and he disappears. He reappears a few seconds later as he goes leaping across the stage, his legs looking longer than usual as he flies. This causes a small round of applause through the audience.
Sherlock’s cheeks flush pink and he smiles softly as John puts a few dots of cream on his various blisters and starts unwrapping the bandages.
Mike laughs at his, holding the ball in his armpit as he uses both of his hands to tame his hair. “Brunch? That’s an old lady thing.”
“Barely.”
Sherlock turns his body so he’s facing John, who has begun unpacking his bag. “You really went hard last night. You danced the whole time.”
“What a beautiful and talented couple you two are,” Mrs. Hudson says with delight, clenching her hands together and placing them over her heart. “I have to run off now, but you’ll lock up for me, Sherlock?”
“I can’t. We’re going to my aunt’s house for brunch tomorrow morning.”
“Yeah, I’m more than alright. We’re more than alright.”
John Watson has never felt so good before.
“Where is everyone?” John asks as he pulls off his jersey, the smell of sweat muted thanks to his damaged nose.
“You’re alright.” Though hesitant, Sherlock doesn’t poise it as a question. It’s more of an observation.
Every excuse imaginable floods into his mind, his confidence dam breaking under the pressure. Sick grandma, an aunt’s wedding, seven tests the next day. Nothing sticks, nothing feels right. But the truth? John can’t say it.
“Watson! Where were you last night? We got our asses handed to us on a fucking golden platter.”
“Don’t let him get to you,” Sherlock pleads as John slows his pace down slightly.
“I just wanted to support you. I can’t let Lestrade or Moriarty or anyone get in the way of that. I won’t.”
“Oh, he’s just in the back room changing.” She stands up and walks across the room towards John, a friendly smile appearing on her face. “Why, are you John Watson?”
“Yeah,” John replies quickly, his body finally coming back into reality as he notices the setting sun along the horizon. He’s shaking Mike’s hand, although his eyes have now drifted to the ball. It fits perfectly in John’s hand, the memory of the material still lingering on his palms. “I loved it.”
“There are five simple positions in ballet, generously named first through fifth position.” Sherlock faces John and holds onto the bar, demonstrating and stating the position’s number out loud. John watches his feet move and feels comfortable that he could do that. So, he tries, and discovers that a one footed elephant was the perfect comparison to his level of grace. Sherlock’s face grows red as he laughs, placing a delicate hand onto his stomach. John doesn’t feel embarrassed by this, he just smiles and laughs along with his boyfriend.
“Fair point.”
“Yes, that’s right! Sherlock told us that you are quite the rugby player. In fact, he said you’re the greatest player in the world! What is it he compared you to, I can’t remember.” Mrs. Hudson places a finger to her chin and squints her eyes. “Oh! He called you the ‘Michelangelo of rugby’.”
“Hip hip fucking hooray.” John takes off his shoes and socks. He tosses them carelessly into a corner on his side of the room, then crawls across the bed towards Sherlock. The rugby player places himself in the dancer’s lap, John’s legs wrapped around Sherlock’s waist.
It’s neither player nor coach that speaks first, but the young girl attached to her father’s hip.
Then someone comes through the front door and John’s laugh falters. Coach Lestrade is there with a young girl clinging onto his hand. The way his looks at John makes the player’s skin crawl as he suddenly realizes just how close he is to Sherlock, how he has unknowingly placed his hand on top of Sherlock’s on the bar.
“Alright, mate. I’ll see you then.” Mike shifts the ball from his armpit to his left hand as he goes to give him a high five. John misses, his attention on the ball again.
And there he is.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispers as he breaks the kiss and rests his forehead against John’s.
They can feel it as their lips come back together and Sherlock presses their bodies together before giggling against John’s lips and flipping him over onto his back. They can feel it as their bare bodies become tangled in the soft sheets of John’s bed. They can feel their love deepening as the world around them disappears. It’s just Sherlock Holmes and John Watson- the dancer and the rugby player- just as it was always meant to be.
Things change when John enters university. It’s a prestigious school which would’ve bankrupted the Watson family if he hadn’t been so good at rugby. He’s able to study medicine there for free, as long as John plays on the team.
“They never said specifically that I couldn’t take some flowers, now did they?”
“Alright!” Sherlock takes her hand and leads her to the back room.
“So this is where you’ve been running off to? This is what you missed the game for? You’re a ballerina?” Lestrade spats out the words like they’re sticky on his tongue.
It isn’t until the last ten minutes of the game that things start to go wrong. John fumbles on an important play and feels every head in the stadium watching him as he lets out a string of vulgarities. He can hear his team yelling at him from the sidelines, and can see Moriarty’s sweaty face judging him as he makes his way back to their side of the field. John briefly contemplates apologizing to Moriarty and the rest of the team, but instead puts his game face on and gets in position for the game to start again.
“Watch it.” Jim speaks with such confidence that John almost feels compelled to apologize to him.”We needed you last night. I bet Lestrade is pissed at you.”
Sherlock slumps into the lecture hall the next morning like a zombie. His feet are still sore and he’s missing John’s touch. Students pile into the hall and Sherlock winces at their chatter. He’s just slightly hungover and his senses are heightened immensely. His nose catches a strong whiff of coffee and he lets out a deep breath of air. A hand being placed on his shoulder startles him, his muscles tightening, ready to defend. They loosen when they see John’s smiling face.
“I just think missing the game was a mistake.”
“I can’t believe you’re here right now,” Sherlock whispers. He leans back so his weight is resting on his palms as he tilts his head to admire John. “But don’t you have a game tonight?”
“That’s a very specific metaphor-which I’m slightly concerned about you coming with so quickly. Come on, I’ll just teach you some basics.”
Coach Lestrade is still in his office, just as John hoped he would be. He takes in the sight of the trophy case as he slides in through the automatic doors. The array of awards send a twinge of guilt in John’s chest. He knocks twice on the door, going in for a third when the coach looks up from the collection of papers on his desk. He makes a beckoning hand signal for John to come inside. The player steps into the office, a polite smile on his face.
John trails off here. Takes a breath, closes his eyes. “I really can’t make it to tomorrow’s game.” He opens his eyes and clears his throat, trying hard to maintain eye contact with Lestrade.
“Can I help you with anything, dear?” she asks. She looks so small in the middle of the empty room. She’s old, but not old. John places her in her mid-sixties maybe. She has a dancer’s body, her thin arms somehow muscular with fairly wrinkled skin bunching at her joints.
“Yeah, but I talked to Lestrade yesterday and he let me skip the game.”
“He’s just being modest, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock arrived from the back room, a messenger bag slung over his shoulder. He smiles and turns to the mirror, messing with his hair a bit before crossing the room and placing a kiss on John’s cheek. “You truly have a talent, John.”
“Yep! Bye Sherlock!” She goes running over to the coach and the pair leave the studio.
“You’re too good for me, John Watson.”
“That’s more than enough, Moriarty,” Sherlock says, reaching his final straw with the boy. Jim doesn’t reply, just smirks and turns his attention to the front of the room. The professor has arrived now, and Jim knows well enough not to mess with this man.
John laughs and reaches back into the bag. He takes out a box of band-aids and a tube of cream. “I was surprised too,” he says, taking the ice packs off of Sherlock’s feet and placing them to the side. “I’m never allowed to miss another game and I may have told him that’d I’d help him out before and after the next few games.”
John longs for the party as he watches Sherlock walk away. He longs for his touch, the new feelings he experienced last night as he let loose and let himself fall more in love with Sherlock. He thinks about it all day, throughout every class, especially biology when he has a seat across the room from him. He’s able to admire Sherlock’s studious face, his delicate curls falling into his face he writes in his notebook.
