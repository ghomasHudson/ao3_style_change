“Cas, I -” Dean choked and looked down at his shoes. That was a bit better. “I love you.”
“Dean? Dean Winchester!” Dean, in the middle of a solitary walk in the park, turned around to see a short, red-haired woman running after him, waving. He knew this short, red-haired woman.
“What were you thinking about?”
“This looks like a good place, how are we going to afford it? I haven’t found a job yet, so -”
“Sam,” Dean warned.
“Wh- how did you…?” he trailed off. He turned to Charlie for answers, but she only smiled mischievously.
“I see.”
“Can I come with you?” Dean smiled.
“I’d like that, Dean.”
“You’re at the motel. The one we arrived at two days ago.” Sam’s eyes narrowed. “You saw him again.”
“Not you. Nothing. Forget about it.” Cas smiled innocently. “Can we go back to kissing now?”
“Why doesn’t he?”
“Oh! I know a guy you could stay with! He’s around your age, and he’s a good guy. He's a little weird, but he grows on you when you get to know him.”
“Like what?”
“Yes?”
“I’m not sure whether to be grateful or offended.”
“So what do I do?”
Dean was lying on top of his bed. Laundry littered the floor, as did pizza boxes and empty beer bottles. The pizza boxes weren’t empty. Dean just wasn’t as hungry these days. He was listening to Dean’s top 13 Zepp TRA XX on repeat. He hadn’t been on a hunt in weeks. Chuck may have been gone, but so was Cas. He wasn’t coming back. Nothing else mattered anymore. He was reaching for another beer bottle when there was a soft knock at the door.
The door flew open, and there was Dean. His eyes glowed like a million suns, as if he contained a supernova.
“Dean, you are the Michael sword, the embodiment of good.”
“Dean.” Cas sniffed. “It’s fine. It’s more than fine. I… I love you, too.” Then the tears came even faster, but Dean was frozen in place.
“And whose fault is that?”
“You could come with me. It might be… useful. To have an ex-marine around.”
“Are we going anywhere specific?” asked Cas.
“The landlord’s offered me a special deal. I was able to track down the villain who murdered his wife a while back.” Just then, the door opened to reveal an older-looking man with a beard and a trucker hat.
“My whole life, I’ve tuned out people, I’ve had no trouble feeling nothing towards them - because emotions are a distraction, you know - but you show up in the morgue, and I…” he trailed off. “You’re different. And I don’t… I can’t figure out what that means.” He turned to look at Dean, and Dean could see Cas’ eyes were quivering and shiny.
“Actually, he’s probably hanging around the hospital if you want to meet him now. Unless you’re busy?” Dean chuckled.
“I don’t want any of your stupid presents.”
“Overseas. Enlisted in the marines, but I got shot.” He gestured to his cane. “I hate this thing.”
Cas!”
“Okay, what do you think about grilling tomorrow night? You can bring your friends, and we’ll all have a good time, huh?” Dean claps Sam on the shoulder, and Sam pushes out a nervous laugh.
“What’s this about stealing me?” Cas asks, entering the living room and plopping down on the couch next to Anna.
Dean, after that, had barely made it in to work day after day. He barely made it out of bed day after day. After a while, he just…shut down. He did everything he could to keep Emma off his mind, everything he knew how to keep Cas off his mind. It’s been difficult, considering the rapid fire phone calls Cas keeps sending his way, and each one sends a painful twist through his chest.
“Yo, Milton,” Dean calls, turning slightly to look at her, catching only a trail of red hair tied back into a ponytail.
“Dean,” Cas says gently and scrubs across his face again. Dean refuses to open his eyes. And then, “Dean, please, look at me.”
really
The next morning, Dean is awoken by the screaming of his alarm clock. He peeks open his eyes and watches the blinking of the clock before pushing the button to shut it off. Dean finds his dad in the kitchen, sitting at the table with Sam in a high chair.
Dean is balancing on a log.
He comes back around at some point later—it’s impossible to know when with all the emptiness—to Cas hauling him over the not-ground, towards the glowing door of
“Well, I guess, why him? The other…boys you...
“Doesn’t he know you’re leaving to pick up Emma?” Dean asks, standing back and turning his head towards the back of the house.
“Neither am I,” he says confusedly. “I’m only slightly shorter than you, and though my muscle mass isn’t quite as great as yours, my bone size and structure is very similar.”
“Dean?”
The first time Dean made love to Cas was weeks ago, mere days after their first time period. Cas was a whimpering mess, and Dean decided that he rather liked seeing Cas come undone beneath him, almost as much as he liked seeing Cas come undone above him. So Dean takes hold of Cas’ hips and pushes his tongue inside him, savoring the whimper Cas lets out. From there, Dean stretches him slowly, first with his tongue, then with his fingers, pulling him apart until Cas is nothing but a writhing mess beneath him.
“Yes,” he tells her, squeezing her lightly.
Dean feels Cas weakly lift his head, but Dean, even when his extremities refuse to cooperate, refuses even harder to let Cas go.
“Go to your room, Dean,” John says finally, his voice low and deadly calm.
“You’re not leaving? You're not leaving.” Gabe mimics him, his voice first incredulous and soon exasperated. “What about your apartment?”
“I’m getting
“You finish that one?” Dean asks, and Lisa glances at him because he doesn’t care about books. He never has before.
“Tell me what you like, Cas. Let me make you happy,” Dean says instead, because it’s his job and he doesn’t want to get fired.
“When she gets fussy later from not having had enough sleep, I’m sending her to you,” she says, bored with their games and child’s play. Dean’s eyes fall. He tries not to imagine a reality in which Cas had been Lydia; he tries not to imagine the way Cas would have curled up with them and done silly voices for Hook. He tries and only manages to push the thought away when Emma’s little hand closes over his.
“I actually moved to Seattle,” Cas tells her, and she gasps.
“Good morning,” Dean says softly, wrapping an arm behind his head so that he can prop up and see Cas more clearly. Cas grunts softly and cuddles beneath Dean’s arm, beneath his chin.
“Wow, you’re really wasted,” Dean comments, wiping Benny’s spit from his cheek, grinning when Benny begins to laugh.
She checks him out quietly after that, helps him bag his things, and waves him goodbye. He doesn’t look at Dean as he leaves. He takes the subway for the next two days, goes to bed without late-night snacks, and keeps his car at the tow-yard. Soon enough, however, he tires of the subway. He’ll call it
” Gabe’s eyes are disappointed, and Cas’ eyes are filling with tears. That hard and stoic person he was for ten years is gone. Castiel is gone.

“I can’t lose Emma, Cas. She means everything to me… I just…I can’t.” Cas blinks and drops his eyes. The disappointment he feels is suffocating.
me that you won’t tell John,” Cas says, his voice still shaky from the tears. His mother grins at him.
and a
But then, Cas winks at him, and all Dean can do is groan, and put his head back, and try to forget what it is that he’s doing.
“That’s all, Emma. You can get down now.” Judge Mills’ voice is sad too. Emma slides down off her chair and takes the bailiff’s hand. She starts towards Dean, and when the bailiff starts to pull her away, both father and daughter begin to cry, Dean begging her to be good, to be strong, Emma begging to see her father, to make him take her for ice cream. The bailiff ends up picking her up, kicking and screaming, and taking her back to wherever she was before, probably waiting with her aunt outside. As soon as she’s out of earshot, Dean begins to break.
“You can’t stop me,” Sam says, standing taller than Dean thinks he’s ever seen him. Dean wonders in passing how much longer it will be until Sam surpasses him completely.
“Castiel Milton?” the man asks, a half-grin forming on his face.
with,” he amends, and tears well up in Cas’ eyes. “He needs you, Cas.” Cas takes a long moment to answer, and when he speaks, his voice is shaky with tears.
“Dean, it’s nearly noon. You said you’d take me and Jess to the park.” Dean groans, and rolls over, tossing his headphones to the side.
A silver dollar would do the trick, tell him what he needs to know.
Cas. Someone told you about Bela,” Dean says, bringing a hand up to his face as though he could wipe away the panic attack beginning beneath his skin.
“I love you too,” and soon after, they are asleep. The next morning, for the first time in over fifty years, Cas wakes up in Dean’s arms. He nearly cries in relief. Some part of him still believed he would sleep and wake up back in his bed, tubes attached to him, body falling apart. Even so, when he wakes, Dean is already awake, staring at him.
“Yeah, Jess,” he whispers, his voice low and cheeks heated. “I miss you too...Yeah... I’ll definitely see you soon, okay? Things are just crazy...No, we're fine. Uncle Bobby's letting us stay here for a while...Yeah, Jess...I love you, too…bye.” Dean’s heart clenches in his chest. He misses Cas. Sam sets the phone aside but keeps his eyes low. He looks so beaten down by the world that he cannot stand it.
and left,” he explains, and the girl’s face clears.
“What happened?” he manages finally, and Sam grits his teeth.
“Mommy,” he asks, tugging gently at her hair. “What if none of the other kids like me?” His voice is small, his green eyes, wide. Mary smiles softly.
“Dean, are you sure this is a good idea?” Dean Winchester throws his head back and laughs.
“He didn’t,” Cas replies, and though his voice is dismissing, hope bubbles up inside of him, fast and dangerous and overwhelming.
When they get to the bar, Dean plops down at a booth far in the back, flags down the waitress to get the beers, and when she walks away after depositing their drinks, the two men are left alone together for the first time in ten years.
When they finally got back together, sexually, that is, they still went slow, however, not because of the past pressing around them. They went slow because they
intense platonic love
"I don't know how those bruises got there," Dean says again. "I love my daughter so,
Dean lets him. Comes silently, still crying.
“Thank God!” he cheers, and Dean barely has the malicious energy to throw a pillow at him before he is back into that dopey state.
She calls Cas right away.
“You know what to do?” he asks, and she nods excitedly. He smiles and brushes her hair back from her face. “Good. I’ve gotta go. See you soon,” he promises, kisses her forehead, and lets her go. He claps Sam on the back as he passes and pulls open the door with hands that definitely don’t tremble. The fresh air does little to calm him, and he walks quickly past the few people milling about to his place beneath the tree, ignoring all the eyes on him. He stands up there alone for a few moments, breathing deeply and humming with nervous excitement. He’s finally here.
, and it shocks Sam how much it hurts to hurt him. “I don’t think you should see him,” Sam blurts, and Cas closes his eyes, dead smile still plastered there. “It’s just.” Sam pushes out a burst of air and runs a hand down his face. Cas pulls in a slow breath and opens his eyes. “He’s really happy, Cas. Seeing you would just…bring back old memories, memories that he’s worked hard to forget and get past. It would only upset him.” Tears well up in Cas’ eyes, but he nods a bit.
“Nope,” Dean replies, standing and leaving the room. So yes, Dean avoids Sam, and soon the trial is upon them, pressing down on them all like the weight of summer air, sticky and heavy and omnipresent.
“Yeah, but it don’t mean nothin’, not to a girl like her.”
“A sociopath,” he bites, and Sam sighs.
“Well there were
“Idjit,” Bobby says to Dean when it’s just the two of them.
“What? Where is he?”
“I’ll never be interested in sex.”
“Please,” he begs, tossing his head this way and that. “Don’t do this.”
“How should I know?” Dean asks with a defensive shrug.
“Sam,” Dean hisses, grabbing Sam’s arm and noticing the firm muscle under his palm instead of the fact that he wants to beat the shit out of something. “Nothing’s changed. We’re leaving.”
“What about before that?”
“Why did they think that?”
Dean manages to wonder as he beats.
“Of course,” so Dean leads Cas back downstairs, fingers threaded through both Dean’s and Hannah’s as they exit through the big doors leading to the deck. When they get outside, Cas sees Dean’s family sitting in chairs, chattering, all facing a large arch decorated with flowers and vines.
“Dean,” Cas whimpers when they separate. Dean is shaking. His heart is racing. He is seventeen again, staring into the eyes of the only person he’s ever truly loved. He presses his forehead to Cas’, gulps in huge breaths of him like he we will die if he does not. They are trapped there, the darkness shielding them from the reality that this cannot last forever.
Castiel holds the letter in his hands for a while. He stares at the words printed onto the page, the round signature scratched at the bottom. Something is bubbling up inside Castiel, building faster than he could ever hope to squash it. It grows larger and larger until it’s there, pushing against him with the force of a hurricane. He sees it from the beginning, all of it.
I think I'd like to marry him,
“She didn’t get her brains from me, that’s for sure,” Dean says, and Sam rolls his eyes.
“Okay, you’re playing an army lieutenant, not Yoda.”
“Mrs. Winchester,” Jody Mills starts, and Gabe snickers.
“How?” he asks, and Lilith smiles, stepping forward and wrapping an arm low around John’s waist, her other hand coming up to cup the top of his stomach.
Dean will call back.
“I don’t want you to go,” he says finally, because it’s easier than saying
“Yeah, that’s what I thought. Idjit.”
It’s awkward at first. Really,
“Jess,” he shouts, banging at her door, not thinking about the baby or the fact that they are all asleep. She appears at the door in a heartbeat, accompanied a moment later by the sound of Sammy crying. “It’s time,” he tells her, barely able to keep himself from deteriorating with joy. “It’s time! She’s being born!” The annoyance on Jess’ face falls away at his words, replaced by a squeal and her arms flinging around his neck. The laugh together, Cas’ face in Jess’ neck and Jess’ face buried in his shoulder.
“So what do you think Dan should do?” She snuggles closer, eyes drooping shut again.
“Please, Dean," Cas whimpers, desperate as he watches Dean's face. He's never seen so much hurt, so much regret. "Please," he begs, and Dean looks away, eyes slowly becoming glossy.
The first day in a long time that he isn’t undoubtedly fine comes with the question that he knew she’d eventually ask. She is almost five and has been attending preschool for nearly two weeks.
“He’s not here,” he says coldly, and Cas’ heart falls.
She scoffs and drops her ratty coat to the ratty carpet.
“My mind is made up,” Dean says firmly, staring back at Bobby until the old man looks away, sadness on his face.
“That’s so much to give up, Cas,” he chokes.
“You mean the sex?” he asks, and she nods, cheeks burning with more color than he’s seen in her skin all day. “Yes. It felt very good.” He grins, a small blush lighting his own cheeks as well. He tries not to let the memories of Dean’s hands on him widen the ache.
. Dean’s
Sam is chattering happily away at his girlfriend—the punk finally got the nerve to ask Jess to be his girlfriend—and Cas is sitting peacefully reading a book. It has been nearly a month since they started this best-friends-by-day, sex-partners-by-night endeavor, and Dean has never been happier or more confused in his life. Dean is watching Cas, and when he comes to the end of his book, he looks up, confused as though he didn’t realize he was in reality instead of the fictional land his book sent him to.
too much of your sex life as it is and I want to see and hear even less of it with Cas." He shudders, and Dean grins, finding ever the pleasure in making Sam uncomfortable. "Okay, my question is, why Lisa if you’re with Cas?” Sam asks finally, and Dean’s playful banter deflates.
“Your mother,” she wheezes, and Cas jerks away from her so quickly it looks as though she scalded him.
,” Sam hisses, jerking away before Cas can set a hand on his shoulder. “It’s your fault, you son of a bitch!” Cas reels a bit.
“Where is Naomi Christiansen?” The man asks, his gun aimed at the floor beside the feet of the man at the front desk. The man, eyes wide, points to her office door, swinging the cops’ attention there and to the trio standing there in the hallway. April freezes, and in a blink, she is darting away from the whole scene, slipping out a back door into the blazing sunlight. A couple of cops from the back ranks take off after her, and that is the last Cas sees of any of them. April’s male counterpart, however, is still frozen in place, and soon, he is handcuffed and told that he is under arrest. The rest of the cops filter throughout the building, pulling out victims and abusers alike, taking them all aside for questioning.
Castiel didn’t think rule two was a rule as such, but Dean allowing himself to ask for something for himself was a big thing. He knew better than to argue with that. Looking straight into Dean’s eyes he nodded solemnly. Heat rose up in his stomach as his lips caught Dean’s in a blistering kiss. If he’d ever wondered which room he was going to stay in today, he now knew for sure it would be Dean's.
“Dean’s praying to me, asking to bring you back. He does this dozens of times a day. He doesn’t know you’re out of the Empty.”
“You know you can go back, but know that it’s definitive this time. There is no changing your mind. If you return, it’s as a human being with a soul. You’ll start your life as a baby and you will live it out like any other human until you come full circle. And Castiel, you will not remember anything from your time as an angel. Not your past as a warrior of heaven, nor your time as a human. You will, in essence, become a brand new human being. I can guide your soul so you’ll be born in the best possible circumstances, but that is all I can and will do. Everything else is up to you and the people around you.”
From then on, Castiel went to check in on Dean every night. Sometimes they talked about the apocalypse, about Chuck, but sometimes Dean told him about movies he’d watched, about a job he was thinking of getting. Other times they just walked or sat in silence. The scenery often changed from desolate and bloody to green and full of sounds as soon as Dean was aware of his presence.
Sam and Jack said their goodnights, but Dean just stood up and came with him. When they got down in the corridor, away from eventual prying eyes, Dean grabbed him by his lapels and pushed him against the wall.
“Yes. Everything down there will happen as it happens, there will be no interference. When we finish our task here, when we’re done rebuilding heaven, the place where souls come to rest, I’ll remain among them, as will all the angels,” Jack smiled brightly as he took in Castiel’s incredulous expression, “When everything is ready, we’ll guide the human souls to their peace. You see, most of them already found it here. They’ve found their loved ones, some are even making more friends. This is the paradise I once promised you, when I was in my mother’s womb. Do you remember that?”
“You gonna drive or what?” Dean grumbled as Sam didn't move behind the wheel, but kept looking out of the window. He startled when he felt Sam's hands grab his leg with more force than necessary. Sam’s face was expressionless, but his eyes were on fire. His pupils were dilated and his breathing became shallower the more seconds passed. He looked like he was about to pass out. Dean waved his hands in front of Sam's face, but there was no reaction. He just kept looking.
Castiel gave him the short version of events, without losing himself into the details of rebuilding heaven.
Castiel was puzzled. Why wouldn’t Dean enjoy his life without him around? He’d been doing okay when they talked in his dreams. Taking a good look at Sam, he noticed much of the tension he’d seen in his face had vanished. While at first he attributed this to getting rid of the vamps, there was something else to it. Something frighteningly akin to hope started to rear its head deep down insid of him, but he didn’t want to read too much into it.
"Cas, I...," Dean started, but the angel gently placed his index finger on his mouth.
Castiel took a step back and felt Dean’s hand between his shoulders, offering silent support. He saw Sam look at him with a soft and encouraging smile. For the first time in ages, he felt that those feelings he had for them were returned. He could feel their love and friendship reach him without needing words. Dean slipped from behind his back, covering him with his body, and Sam too took a few steps so he was in between Castiel and Jack. His heart grew three sizes bigger now he saw and felt what it truly meant to be under the Winchesters’ protection. His human body was weak, powerless, but his family had his back.
Jack kept his eyes trained on Castiel all the time, barely sparing a glance for the Winchesters. Castiel could feel the confusion and anger coming off the kid clearly, even in his human form.
Castiel looked at Jack, really looked at him. The boy looked lost, completely out of his depth. He tried to do the right thing, but he found himself walking into walls time and time again. Rebuilding heaven hadn’t been easy, they’d had a lot of resistance from the other angels, and from a lot of the souls who had been at peace for a long time, and yet Jack had pushed through, only because he knew Dean would be pleased when he finally arrived. Pleasing his family had been the kid’s first priority, so it wasn’t a surprise he was torn between doing the right thing and making Sam happy.
“I missed you, you dick,” he breathed deeply, inhaling Cas’ scent like a drowning man, “you can’t do that, you know? You can’t drop a bomb like that on a man, and then just get sucked into the Empty.”
He was busy rebuilding the Axis Mundi when he felt it, a sharp pain close to where his heart would be if he were still stuck in his vessel. This couldn’t be good. He vanished from his spot and appeared in Jack’s space, or office as he sometimes called it, which was thankfully empty. He walked up to the cupboard and took out the tray he’d used to check up on the Winchesters previously.
Castiel felt lighter when he heard Dean’s grumbling voice. While he knew his grace had healed most of the damage done, he’d been afraid there would have been lingering effects. The man seemed to be in good health, as long as he didn’t try to stand up too fast. Sam caught him just in time before he could fall onto the floor again. They both guided Dean back so he could sit while the fog lifted from his head.
“Why did you do it, Castiel? You know the rules, and why I changed them. Just… tell me why.”
“What happened, Cas? How can you be here?”
*****
"Cas?", Dean said, sniffing, "Did you put out the fire under that bacon earlier?"
Sam still looked bewildered by everything that had happened in the last ten minutes. From being resigned to continue without his brother to having his best friend returned, he really couldn’t fathom what had happened.
Looking at Dean’s narrowed eyes, Castiel smiled broadly, not an ounce of regret in his voice. “You can punish me, that would be your choice. I disobeyed the rules, you can choose to punish me or to let it go. I acted out of love. My love for humanity, but for Dean in particular, changed me. I could not stand by and let him die in that way. Not before he got the chance to live,” he glanced at Dean. Finding nothing but encouragement in his eyes, he continued, “We’ve tried to teach you compassion as well. I’m not going to plead with you to get my angel powers back, but I will ask you to leave us be,” he hung his head and took another deep breath, “as things stand, I am human, with a human life in front of me. All I ask is that I’m allowed to live it. Where my soul goes after I die, that will be up to you.”
Neither man seemed to pay attention when the door to the kitchen opened to let Sam and Eileen in. Dean grinned in the kiss as he noticed Sam's face fall when Eileen patted her breast pocket.
“When you were in the Empty, while I was looking for a way to get you out, I discovered many damaging events that would have been prevented if angels and demons had not interfered. At the time, it seemed prudent to close off the exits in both heaven and hell. Most monsters have been dealt with, they have their own place in Purgatory now. Eve watches over them and takes care of them. They no longer have a need to roam the earth. The few that are left will be finished off by hunters or they can live their lives in peace if they so choose.”
“I don’t know, Sam. Jack sealed off heaven and hell. I had no way of knowing who went where… We can’t go look for her in hell either.  I’m sorry.”
Jack’s face fell. His eyes filled with unshed tears and he licked his lips nervously.
“I thought we’d lost you, buddy. Glad to see those baby blues,” he said, relief palpable in his voice and tone. Castiel smiled. He took the hand that rested on his chest and kissed it. Dean’s eyes softened for a moment before he pulled his hand back and helped him sit up straight.
“You can only see events happening in real time. The future is no longer set, no one knows what will happen later on. Everything is up to them now.” Jack warned him before he took a deep breath and looked.
Castiel held his breath for a fraction of a second, just long enough for Dean to close the gap between them and place the gentlest of kisses on his lips. When Dean broke the kiss, he rested his forehead against Castiel’s and smiled at him. Castiel swallowed and tentatively smiled back, liking the feeling Dean’s gaze gave him. This was the first time he’d ever been on the receiving end of this heated look, filled with promises of good times to come. He lifted one hand to cup Dean’s cheek and pulled him in for another kiss.
Castiel looked at Jack’s open expression, wholly different from the one he had worn only five minutes earlier. His mouth pursed, his hand covering his eyes. He looked sad, resigned, devoid of anger. It took him a few seconds to regain composure.
“He is. He knows he can’t do anything. All he does is pray. They are saying goodbye right now, they know what’s going to happen.”
Taking out Chuck had been no worse than taking out any other monster they’d battled before. In the end, they beat him. Sam, Dean and Jack. Team Free Will minus one had done it again.
A few hours later, they were both sated and relaxed. They were tangled together on top of the covers, enjoying the cool air caressing their bare bodies. Castiel lay on his back, caressing the Dean’s neck, softly scratching that sweet spot where his hair fell over his skin. He was on the verge of falling asleep when he heard Dean whisper something, before burying his face in his neck.
When Dean tried to grab the flask again, he found Sam’s hand on his wrist, disapproval and sadness written all over his face.
They never discussed Castiel’s feelings, nor the way he’d finally told Dean about them. He noticed Dean acted differently in the dreams, that he didn’t hold back when he wanted to touch Castiel. He took his hands whenever they sat close, he hugged him every time Castiel showed himself. He never spoke up, but his actions filled the angel with joy. Dean’s physical shape changed with each of their encounters. The less anxious he became, the younger the man appeared. After a while, the only version of him Castiel still saw was the young, freckled man he had rescued from hell, but in his eyes lay the wisdom of the experienced hunter he’d left behind when the Empty took him. One who deserved rest and retirement, and had obviously found exactly that in his own dreams.
“Did Jack ever mention her? When you were in heaven with him, did he say what happened to her? And to the others from the other world?”
“No angel is allowed to come down to earth anymore. If they want to fall, they have to rip out their grace and start life as a baby. A new soul, a new human.”
“Please stay.” Dean breathed, ghosting his lips over Castiel’s earlobe. He pressed a chaste kiss to the side of his neck.
For all his previous confusion and hesitation, Dean found he returned Cas’ feelings fully. His heart skipped a beat when he thought of his friend’s face, the dark mop of hair and his clear blue eyes. There was nothing Cas couldn’t have if it were up to Dean. He imagined what it would be like to cup his face, to feel the roughness of his cheeks against his palm. The thought of tracing his upper lip with his thumb, before capturing his mouth in the softest of kisses made Dean blush. He tried to hide the twinkle in his eyes, but one look at Sam's face told him he failed terribly so he gave up fighting it.
With the last of his grace, he finished healing Dean, who now lay unconscious on the floor of the barn. His breathing was steady and his face was no longer gray and drawn. Castiel supposed Dean would wake up any minute now. He sat opposite Sam, but kept his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“Can you get him out? Please?”, his voice broke and after a deep breath he continued, “I’ve never asked for anything for myself in my life, but could you please do this for me, for Cas. He doesn’t deserve to rot in the empty. He saved me yet again, please...”
“You know why I did it, Jack. You know I had no choice. You gave us free will, it comes with consequences. There was nothing short of imprisoning me that you could have done to stop me.”
Castiel looked his son in the eyes, searching for a trace of the soft boy he had been while they lived together in the bunker. All he found was a strong and decisive man, a God, kind yet unrelenting.
“You know what, baby brother? You’re right,” he said, causing Sam’s eyebrows to disappear into his hairline.
Dreams. He could try and communicate with Dean in his dreams, like he had done a few times before. He doubted Jack knew of this ability, as it hadn’t been a common practice. It required a profound bond between the angel and the human they intended to visit. This form of communication was usually reserved for those who were called upon to be guardian angels, and the archangels that protected the prophets. There wasn’t much information on it in heaven’s extensive libraries, and Castiel guessed Jack hadn’t come across it, or his knowledge on the topic was limited at best.
Noticing that Dean hadn’t repeated his offer, that he didn’t want to give his life for hers, Castiel felt strengthened in his resolve.
“Damn it… I’m never drinking again… where the hell am I?” Dean’s speech was slurred, but he seemed healed and healthy. With obvious difficulties he sat up and took in his surroundings. He blinked as he saw the dead vamps lying on the floor, and he smiled apologetically at Sam when he saw him.
Castiel turned his head to catch Dean’s green gaze. His eyes were soft as he closed the gap between them. He closed his eyes and gave in to the feeling of Dean’s lips softly touching his. He kissed back with everything he had, this was what he’d dreamed of since his first time as a human. His feelings had been just as strong when he was still an angel, but his physical reaction to their proximity had never been as overwhelming as it was now. He held on tight as Dean’s tongue caressed his, both possessive and uncertain. He let out a soft, contented sigh when Dean moved his hand and took a hold of the hair in his neck. A warm, tingling feeling spread throughout his body at the touch and all he could do was hold on as their kiss grew just a bit more heated.
He stared in fear and expectation as Dean’s hand moved to his coat and pulled him closer. The hug he found himself crushed in was nothing like the previous hugs they’d shared. Dean held him close and buried his face in his neck like nothing else mattered anymore. Castiel relaxed in the embrace, wrapping his arms around Dean and holding on tight.
“I changed you, Castiel. I changed all angels. You are now capable of experiencing all emotions and sensations, and to let them guide your decisions. Your capability to feel love, to care, changed heaven for good. We made it a better place.” Jack told him, not long after they finished the repairs.
*****
Jack once hinted he knew what Castiel was doing, and he didn’t mind as long as he didn’t try and interfere. As long as everything went well, it wasn’t hard to keep out of it. Castiel kept his visits up, but he no longer showed himself to Dean. Whenever Dean was in distress, he sent out signals that suggested his presence, but he knew he had to let go some time. The reason he’d sacrificed himself was to give Dean a chance to lead the life he deserved. Now that his heart seemed to have healed somehow, Castiel hoped the hunter would be able to move on, to let go.
have they been together like this. Sure, they’ve never been these sweating palms or these frantic lips, these broken cries for more, but they’ve always needed each other. They’ve always been everything the other ever needed, a best friend, a brother, a confident, someone to beat at Call of Duty, but they've never known how much they needed
“She’s precious. How would you like to hold her?” Missouri smiles at Cas, but he is nodding and crying before he realizes it. Missouri leads Cas and Jess into the hallway and deposits them in a room dimmed and warm. He sits in a stiff arm chair with Jess next to him and waits.
“Awesome,” Dean spits, pushing himself away from the counter. He starts for the door, and would very likely be out and storming down the hall had it not been for Cas’ hand snapped around his wrist.
hungry?
want to know.
forgive myself,” she says, and he sobs harder, clinging tight to her frailing frame. He doesn’t want her to die with this burden. He wants to make it all better with Dean, show her that it’s okay, that what she did can be fixed, that there is hope for them yet. But he knows better. He has never seen Dean so set on anything in his life.
“You…” Dean says, but he can’t get the words out. He can’t move. He can’t think. He can’t breathe.
to court some
Cas stays in her office for hours, watching the world pass by through the window without seeing anything. He finds himself sitting in the chair across from her desk, curled up with his knees against his chest. Charlie comes back in later, hands him a cup of coffee, kisses his cheek, and tells him she’s going home for the night. She asks if he’ll be alright tonight, asks if he wants to go with her. He tells her no. He doesn’t specify to which question, and he supposes it doesn’t really matter.
Cas’ mom. Lisa rolls her eyes.
“Fuck no,” he spits into the phone.
And just like that, he remembers how much it hurts. How much he loves this man sitting before him, and how little it matters, now, at the end of things.
“That’s correct, your honor,” Lydia’s lawyers says, standing and straightening his blazer.
“Yes,” he answers, reaching into his pocket and pulling out his ‘inventory.’ The mock one he’d given Charlie read simply,
“I’m sorry I said all that about her,” Dean says softly when they pull away, carding his fingers through Cas’ hair. “Really, I am, but Meg’s gotta go.” Dean smiles and kisses Cas’ laughing mouth.
“I don’t know. Are you a stalker?” he asks, a grin he’s trying hard to hide staining his lips.
“Well, we’ve been engaged for over fifty years. I think it’s about time, don’t you?” Dean grins, kisses Cas, and pulls him close.
“Well, I don’t.” Dean left that night and has avoided Cas since. His window has been locked for the past three nights, and Sam doesn’t
“It’s fine…It’s not like I’m going to kill myself or anything. I just…I’m so tired, Dean.” Sam finally looks up at Dean, his eyes full of hurt and the weariness he was just speaking of.
wanted Dan to kiss him, but he didn’t want to stop being best friends with him. He didn’t want Dan to get in trouble for kissing him. But after Clarence ran away, Dan found him and told him that they would never stop being best friends, that he wouldn’t let them get in trouble. And so they kissed again, and soon, they became real boyfriends, spending every single second together. Their relationship had to be a secret though, because people still thought that boys liking boys was wrong, but Dan and Clarence didn’t mind. They were too in love to mind. They were very, very happy together, that is, until Clarence’s mom came home one day to find them acting like boyfriends together. You remember that most people thought that it was wrong, so when she saw them, she banished Dan from ever seeing Clarence again and locked Clarence away in the top of a tower.”
“Jack…,” Castiel started, but Dean cut him off with a gruff “Shut up! Eileen belongs here, she belongs with her family. She got a second chance at life, but so did we all. So just… bring her back.”
In his relief after being freed from Chuck’s cruel storytelling, Dean hadn’t even thought of asking Jack to bring back Cas. As he watched Sam’s softening features the longer he talked to Eileen, his stomach churned.
“You know I can’t interfere, He wouldn’t want me to. He… he wants to go, he’s ready.”
For a moment Castiel forgot that he no longer was an angel. He jumped up and put his arms around Jack to try and calm him down, but it didn’t work. The last thing he knew felt was a burning sensation in his hands and then being blinded by light and then pure darkness.
Cold feet? Now? Why would he get cold feet? This was Cas, his friend, his not-quite-brother, his... his angel. The one who had sacrificed his life again to save Dean’s, the one who saw through all of his bluster and bravado and still chose to love him, against his upbringing and everything he had stood for the first four million years of his existence. Imagining Cas standing at the stove, cooking Dean’s favorite breakfast, was the image that did it.
After what felt like hours, he found the familiar light of Dean’s soul emanating from a small boy with the brightest green eyes. The boy stood in a corner of a battlefield that was filled with dead monsters as well as humans. He kept his eyes averted from the light Castiel’s true form spread out over the whole plane. The angel treaded carefully as he made his way to the young kid, knowing that he could disappear as soon as he realized what was going on. Dean could also banish him from his dreams. He was fairly certain that wouldn’t happen, but he had no idea if Dean would be happy to see him now.
“Hey, hey, Sammy… let’s not get carried away here,” Dean interrupted him, “If you’re talking about Cas, just give the man a break. He doesn’t need to be punished. Just,” and he took a deep breath before continuing, “let nature run its course. Take me with you, like it was supposed to be.”
Castiel was surprised to hear these words, this open acceptance of a need Dean would never allow himself when awake. He took in Dean’s resigned posture as they walked away from the battlefield into a dark forest. The foliage was bright green and retreated as the two friends walked on. Stars lit up the sky and the forest and guided them on the right path. Castiel had always known Dean’s mind to be a welcoming place for him, no matter how strained their relationship had become at times. A weight fell off him as he followed Dean onto the narrow paths filled with freshly fallen leaves.
A beach, a desolate beach filled with dead bodies and debris, was the first thing Castiel saw when he entered Dean’s dream. More and more bloody and mangled bodies washed ashore, the blood red sea never seemed to run out, until there was not a trace of sand to be found. He knew he could take control of the imagery, if only to turn the dream into something nicer for Dean, but he also realized this wasn’t the purpose of his visit. He had to talk to him, make sure he didn’t self-destruct as he was prone to do when he took everything too much to heart. The first thing he had to do was to look for Dean himself, and find how he manifested in his own dreams.
Castiel nodded absentmindedly. He knew a lost cause when he saw one. Giving up his memories, his enormous knowledge, to start life anew as a human wasn’t worth it. He didn’t want to fall, he was quite happy being an angel. His love for Dean had helped him realize there was more to his existence than obedience, the man had taught him how to be independent, and in the end, he would be a better angel because of that knowledge. All of this, and the crushing realization that he had left him sitting on that floor, unable to do anything, made that he was becoming desperate to talk to him, but Jack’s changes seemed to make that impossible. There would be no way to go back to Dean, to clean up his unfinished business, to make sure he was okay.
Sam didn’t waste any time, moving the dog out of the way and hauling Dean up from his spot. Irritation radiated off him as he shook his brother a little rougher than strictly necessary.
“I already did, Dean. As of now, they’re all but gone. There are a few vampires, werewolves and rugarus left, but they’re peaceful. They will die when it’s their time and their souls will go where they belong.”
Castiel pushed Sam roughly aside and grabbed Dean’s face. He felt his grace rush through his body as he held his hand over the dying man’s heart. With practiced ease, he healed the internal damage as best as he could before he pulled Dean off the piece of rebar.
“Let’s take this elsewhere,” he breathed, barely hanging on to his self control, but Dean shook his head and groaned.
He couldn’t know that Emma would start calling him “Papa,” or that she would graduate from Berkley with honors. He couldn’t know that, even as they dance that night at their wedding, April Kelly starves, impoverished and malnourished after her flee from justice. He couldn’t know that Dean would eventually inherit the auto shop, or that he would eventually be honored with standing ovations and nominations and awards and roses thrown at his feet for the play he wrote. He couldn’t know that he and Dean would live long and happy lives, turning gray and grouchy and wrinkled and never once consider loving anyone else.
“Yes ma’am,” he replies politely, and Cas’ heart flips in his chest. It is the first time he’s heard Dean’s voice in weeks. There's no real reason for Cas to be as nervous as he is. It is just Dean standing in front of him, fighting for the only thing he's ever loved. It is just Cas' hands that have done the taking. It is just the entirety of their life together unfolding into nothingness. Cas watches the judge, praying to whatever powers may be that she is just, that she sees how much Dean deserves his daughter.
“No,” Dean lies smoothly. “Are you?”
. You said you didn’t want to talk about it, so we aren’t!”
to cry,
?” Cas asks, his thumb absently stroking Dean’s jaw.
. Cas, if he did convince Dean to give him another chance, would live the rest of his life knowing their relationship is a lie, is something Dean doesn't want, and Cas, watching Dean's teary eyes, understands.
to run. Cas squeezes Dean’s fingers again, and the storm wreaking havoc in Dean’s chest calms, slowly but surely.
“Dean,” Cas says softly, stepping forward in hopes of comforting the man he loves, but Dean just lashes out again.
“I’m not!”
“What?” John spits, and Dean drops his eyes.
to send him to college…to buy him a car…to start a house mortgage. Don’t you want that for your brother?” Dean squeezes his eyes shut because he does want that for Sam. He wants Sam to go to college, to drive, to
and here they are.
They stay in the park for another hour or so. The kids even manage to draw Dean into the snowball fight, Sam and Jess teaming up and pelting the spaced-out Dean into the war. He wins, judging by the soggy messes he returns to Jess’ house that are Jessica and Sam, and don’t you know he rubs it in, even as he tells Sam he’ll be back later to pick him up.
Cas probably thought Dean was just jerking him around all over again, torturing him for the fun of it.
"Our dad wasn't around much, yet we're still here, healthy, alive. How did you manage that with a no-show dad?”
“Cas,” he shouts, pushing through the people until he is standing directly in front of Cas, that dopey grin still on his face. Cas smiles at Dean, stubbly cheeks almost swallowing his eyes. “Do you want a drink?” Dean asks, leaning close so Cas can hear him over the music. He smells like cologne and strawberry shampoo.
“You know,” Cas whispered at about the halfway point of the play. “The guy they picked to play Frederick’s lover is, while technically trained and a professional, nowhere near as good as the guy
“He doesn’t care. That’s why I keep asking you to pick her up,” Lydia snaps, and Dean sighs. He hangs his head and scrubs a hand down his face.
“All day, every day,” Dean replies with a smile. “But, Sammy, keep it quiet. I don’t want dad to know. He would be pissed.”
He’s lost everything. What’s a little pride to compare with that?
“Just where the fuck do you think you’re going?” John growls, his eyes turned toward Dean, and Dean is about to scream that John told him to pack his shit and get the fuck out, so he’s packed his shit and now he’s getting the fuck out. “You’re not fucking leaving,” John snarls, snatching Sam’s arm from beside Dean. Dean hadn’t even noticed his little brother standing beside him, his own bag strapped to his back. Sam jerks away from John immediately.
“I asked you to go, Cas,” Dean says, his voice level. He does not sound angry. He takes one last long pull on his cigarette before flicking it into the driveway amid a pile of burned butts. He’s likely been smoking them one after another since yesterday to keep the monsters at bay.
“Cas? No! You guys are the best. You are like," Benny pauses, bringing his hands around front to stare at them. He concentrates on them for a while before smashing them together, lacing his fingers and wiggling them. He continues excitedly. "The
“I’m not gonna make you stay,” Bobby says softly, that smile still on his face. “But, boys, he was so damn
is going to break you into a million pieces.” Bobby takes in a deep breath, hands still gripping tight to Dean’s arms. Dean’s eyes stay glued to the ground. “Dean,” Bobby sighs, releasing Dean and stepping backwards. “I
“I promise,” she says, and Cas has no choice but to believe her.
“I’m right here,” he says again and again. “I’m right here, baby. I’m not going anywhere. I’m right here,” and what Cas wouldn’t give to believe it.
“I forgive you, Dean,” Cas says, eyes boring into Dean’s, and all at once, the ache of guilt melts off of Dean in the sincerity of Cas’ voice.
“So? You know the lines, and who could play Frederick better than the man who created this representation of him?” Dean smiles at Cas, and the sight of that smile alone is enough to send the rolling waves of Cas’ stomach into a perfect calm. That smile means everything will be alright, really and truly.
“He was.” A long silence passes between them before Cas finds it in him to speak again. “So what does it mean that he signed us up?”
“You’re so good for me, baby,” Cas murmurs, brushing a kiss across Dean’s lips and hitting the good spot with his fingers. Dean arches up beneath him, and Cas uses the moment to slip an arm beneath him. “Are you sure you want this?” Cas asks, because Dean’ ass is giving easily, and Cas may be mostly a virgin, but he knows Dean is ready.
They sit there saying nothing for a long, long moment, both staring out of the frosted windshield. The silence is only broken up by Dean’s unslowing shudders.
“I was,” Cas says softly, absently turning the ring he can’t bring himself to take off. “He passed away a few years ago.” Garth’s happy-go-lucky smile fades. Cas knows the feeling.
“Come on, Dean,” Sam says with a roll of his eyes, but his cheeks have heated, giving Dean the satisfaction he was seeking. “She’s too good for that.”
“I fucked it up," Dean agrees, squeezing Cas' fingers before continuing, "But I want this, Cas. I want
"And your attempt? What were the circumstances surrounding that?”
“Yes. I’ve had a change of heart,” he says, smiling earnestly back at her.  “I want to be better. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get better.” He smiles to her, Charlie’s warning about stage seven lying forgotten in the part of his mind that he has roped off, the part of his mind that still, and will always, love Dean.
“Why were you crying?” Cas asks again, this time scooting a bit closer, to the point that Dean nearly has to cross his eyes to see him straight.
hold down. The rest, Uncle Bobby helped with or I paid for myself.”
“Thanks, Jo; hi, Ellen,” he says, smiling at them before attempting to head to a private booth in the back.
“I had a bad dream,” she says into his neck, and he holds her tighter, rubbing soothing circles into her back.
is that there should be
“Come on, Cas,” she says, her smile soft because she knows he means more than this. She knows he loves her.
“Fuck,” Dean hisses, quietly, as not to wake Lydia. This is the third night this week he’s dreamed of Cas. The fact that he can’t even get away from that dick in his dreams—with ten years between them, nonetheless—makes Dean furious. Even so, he rolls away from his warm bed, the knowledge that he won’t be able to sleep again heavy on him as he heads for the kitchen. On his way, he steps over plastic Barbie dolls, picks up the princess costume she traded for her cowboy outfit, and pokes his head into her room.
“Sometimes,” Emma whispers, and Dean’s eyes fill with tears.
"I promise, there's a point to this," Sam assures, offering the judge a small smile.
“Dean,” Lisa moans, her bare chest pressed snugly down Dean’s. They are in the car on some dirt-paved side road. Dean’s hands are heavy on her, dragging over her hips, her ass, her breasts. He is trying to enjoy the curves instead of wish they weren’t there. He is trying to enjoy that she smells like perfume instead of cologne. He is trying to enjoy that she is Lisa instead of Cas. It’s not working so well, and she can tell. She grinds down hard on Dean, his pants still zipped and comfortable. “I want you so fucking bad,” she moans, running her hands through Dean’s hair, pulling him this way and that. Control and dirty talk. Two of Dean’s favorite things, but still, when he looks up and sees brown eyes instead of blue, he knows he’s fucked. And not in the fun way.
I'm sure you all hate me a little...That's okay. I hate me a little too, what with Lilith and Bela and Dean being a fucking idiot. Even so, I hoped you all enjoyed and as per usual, I'd love to know what everyone thought, good or bad!
“I so want to tap that,” he says eloquently, and Cas sighs
“What? No, no. Of course not.”
a Cas and Dean wedding…” he says after a long moment, and the thought alone hurts him. He always thought they would be together forever, even at five.
“Guess sucking dick isn’t something you forget how to do,” Dean replies with a grin, pressing a kiss to Cas’ shoulder.
. Every moment they can, they spend together, Dean sneaking into Cas’ new job at Charlie’s for a midday snack, and Cas going to the garage to bring Dean lunch. They are hardly ever apart, and Cas loves every single second.
prostitute.” He had been trying for humor, but the question is still there, still loud.
Dean thinks of his father, of his angry fists, angry words. He thinks of every missed game, every missed birthday. John was never there except to yell at them and beat them. John was never there except to remind them that they were nothing. Cas made him feel like he was worth the whole damn world, and the cycle begins again.
No, it hadn’t been a perfect plan. A perfect plan wouldn’t make Cas choose between being an angel and being with Dean.
“It’s okay to miss him, sweetheart. He was your best friend.”
“Okay, here it is. Says you opened a joint profile with someone named…Winchester.” Cas’ heart stops.
It takes Dean much, much longer than it should to realize why.
“Oh, shut up, Sam,” Dean says as he rolls his eyes. “You have no reason to feel not good enough. You’re the best kid I know.”
be over you, you dumbass,” Dean says, pushing Cas’ head back into the door again. “You’ve fucking ruined me. There will never be anyone else. I’m yours.” As soon as the words are out of Dean’s mouth, his lips are surging forward and slamming against Cas’. Cas’ hands are frantic on Dean, tugging and demanding and taking, always taking. Dean kisses him back desperately.
“Cas, can I ask you a favor?”
“How do you know? Why is that so unbelievable?”
“I know how it sounds,” Cas interrupts, a small smile on his lips. “It sounds like something that would hit your taste buds and immediately draw vomit up, but they’re actually pretty delicious.”
“He’s married now, got a kid. He’s happy, Cas,” and as much as that fact hurts, as much as he aches with the fact that they'll never be how they used to, he nods. He still needs to apologize. He still needs to know that the man he loves does not hate him.
“Cas,” Dean starts, but Cas cuts him a look that quickly kills the rest of his argument. “Okay,” he murmurs, staring longingly at Cas like he wants to kiss him goodbye, like he wants to take away every pain he’s ever felt, but he leaves without another word, picking up the rest of his clothes as he walks away.
“I’ve always used condoms, so I would assume so,” Dean says softly, pulling away to look at Cas. He’d have never imagined how delightful it would be to just lean over and kiss him, but now that he’s realized, he does so and revels in the tiny flip of his tummy. Cas smiles as Dean pulls away.
“My brother will likely be back before then, and…well, I don’t want him to think his gift wasn’t appreciated.” Cas shifts uncomfortably again.
“It’s time for me to blow this popsicle stand,” she says softly with a shrug. Cas watches her with wide eyes, watching as she hikes her bag higher on her shoulder and steps inside. “Dorothy’s done here, and I gotta get back to my girl.”
“Sam, you are the smartest kid I know,” Dean starts again, and again, Sam cuts him off.
“Thank you, Jess,” he murmurs, and he means more than just for coming to the hospital with him. It is in this moment that he realizes that, while he spent the last six years thinking he had no one, she was here all along, supporting him, holding him up without him ever realizing it.
so I’ll raise her as such. I’ll tell her that she has a mother and a father that couldn’t keep her. I’ll tell her that she has two fathers who wanted her more than anything. I’ll tell her that one of those fathers died. I’ll tell her the truth. She deserves that, especially if I’m all she’s getting.”
“We need to talk,” Sam declares, coming closer, walking swiftly as though Cas will try to run. He is not awake enough to run.
“Today is Jessica’s birthday too. This is hers,” Sam says, fingering the wrapping paper gently. Now that Dean looks, it is definitely a more feminine style paper than he would expect Sam to use for him, paisley or some shit. And pink. Very, very pink.
“I want to
Cas keeps expecting him to leave, but a beat passes, and another, and both are still trapped in the small, silent moment stretching outward between the two. Eventually, the cashier speaks again, voice casual.
“Did you drag me out here to tell me stories about us as kids?” Cas asks, gripping Dean’s fingers and voice barely there.
“Twenty-seven ninety-one,” he says, voice soft, eye downcast. Cas hands Dean two twenties, picks up his bags, and leaves, trying to pretend his heart isn’t breaking. He can’t look at Charlie, only at the ground.
“Missouri, is she here yet? Did I miss it?” Cas asks, his hands shaking.
But when he steps closer into Dean’s space, it’s enough to throw all of that out of the window. This is something he never let himself have.
“Yes, he was.” Cas brushes her hair back again. “You would have loved him.”
And Dean hated himself for it, but it was the only way he knew.
His fingers leave streaks of yellow where they dig into Cas’ arm, and Cas glances down at it. Dean realizes suddenly that he’s holding Cas exactly how he’d held Dean, how he’d said goodbye.
“Damn it, boy,” Bobby says, pointing the gun away from them. “I almost shot you! What’re you thinking riding up in your daddy’s car like that? Did 'ja steal that or somethin’?” Dean leans heavily on the door. He feels he might fall otherwise.
“Yes!” Dean says excitedly, raising a hand to his hair and brushing it down. He’s nervous. He’s really fucking nervous, but he breathes through it because it’s just Cas, Cas who taught Dean how to build a kite, Cas who Dean taught how to whistle, Cas who taught Dean that home is a baby brother and a best friend. “We are sexy, and we are best friends, and it’s awesome.
“Hey, Dean,” he murmurs, fingers tracing over the letters again. “It’s, uh, it’s Cas…but you knew that. Caller ID and what not…” Silence, Cas’ heart beats once, twice, and a third time. “I just…I’m sorry, Dean. I really would like to see you, talk to you, explain.” Cas chews his lip, fighting back the ache and the tears and the need to tell Dean everything. Another moment of silence, another beat of Cas’ heart. “Please, Dean, I love yo—” but a beep in his ear tells him his time is up. He sighs, considers deleting the message, but hangs up knowing that Dean probably won’t listen to the thing anyway.
It takes everything in Dean to jerk away from Cas, every ounce of strength in his frigid, brittle body, but it comes as enough of a surprise to Cas—who apparently
“He’s not
And if this is the end of him, then he’ll never get to make up for all the wrongs he’s done him, to trade all the punches thrown for coffees in bed, to trade the lies they’ve seared into each other for cheap beer and soft sex, to trade the anger and the sharpness and the hurt for something better.
“I’m sorry, Bobby,” Dean says finally, because if he isn’t angry, he’s hurt. “It’s just not the same.” And if going home was the knife to Bobby’s back, those words were the twist of the wrist, for every emotion falls off Bobby’s face. Instead, they are left with a half-smile entirely out of place coupled with the desolate eyes.
Cas, almost like he can sense what Dean’s thinking about, sighs.
“Is there someone we can call for you?” someone asks. Dean thinks it’s a lady’s voice, soft and sweet like his mother’s used to be.
. My mom would
“I’m not...but for a long time, I thought I was broken. I didn’t want to be broken, so I forced myself to have sex. Don’t get me wrong. Everyone I was ever with could always tell that I wasn’t enjoying it…” Cas remembers the way Dean looked at him earlier, that exasperation and annoyance blatant on his face. “Even so,” Cas starts, anything to get that look out of his mind. He doesn’t want to remember Dean looking at him like that. “Sometimes asexuals agree to have sex, be it for their own libido or their partner’s fulfilment or just for the hell of it sometimes, and even beyond that, many asexuals do enjoy a few acts that would fall under ‘sexual.’ The line is different for everyone.”
“I have two daddies!” She tells Jess excitedly, practically bouncing in Cas’ lap. “Did you know that?”
, that Dean is Cas' whole world. Dean speaks before Cas can find the words. "Was it all some joke, Cas? Huh, is that it? You break my heart all those years ago, leave me to rebuild my whole life without you for ten goddamn years, and
Which is precisely why he’s freaking out. Dean's never before needed someone to love, only someone to fuck, and here he is, thinking of Cas every single moment.
“Please, Jess, just trust me on this,” he asks, begs really. They stare at each other for another long moment before Jess drops her eyes with a sigh.
“I miss Daddy,” she says softly, stealing a look at her father. He smiles softly at her.
“You’re strong,” Cas rasps, pressing a firm kiss to his daughter’s forehead. She shakes her head, unable to use words to express just how weak she is, just how much she needs her father. They lie there for a while, Cas’ breaths rasping beneath Mary’s head, Mary’s tears dropping onto Cas’ chest. She counts his heart beats, cherishes each rasp of air until they’re gone. Soon, the beats stop, the breaths still, and all at once, her tears come back, silent and wrecking. She pushes herself up, presses a lingering kiss to his cheek before standing up and leaving the room. The whole house feels empty…
“Dean wanted a Mary,” Cas murmurs, watching her blinks grow slower and slower before closing for good. “So Mary she’ll be,” he finishes, wishing, not for the first time that Dean were here with him.
“As far as I know,” Anna says, and Cas can practically hear the helpless shrug in her voice.
“Come with me,” she says, turning their walk and leading them down one of the residential hallways. She turns into a room near the end and holds the door open to Cas. “This is my room, and my witch of a roommate, Dorothy.”
He goes to the baby store after he leaves the agency. The storm still crackles around him, but he drives through it. He calls Jessica on the way and beams about the little baby he’ll be getting. He tells her about the baby proofing things he has no idea how to install and of all the gender neutral colors and clothes he buys because he doesn’t know what the baby will be yet. Jess smiles because even though she still thinks it’s a bad idea, even though she’s 3000 miles away clear across the country, she can see just how happy even the thought of this baby makes Cas. She loves Cas, so of course she’ll support whatever ideas he has,
“Well, I’m not here to steal you,” he mutters, turning back to the TV and ignoring the M&M Anna throws at his head.
“Castiel,” Naomi starts, tilting her head at Cas, eyes gleaming. “Have you ever considered the possibility that what you felt for this boy wasn’t love, but mere lust driven by Satan’s temptations?” Cas’ eyes narrow.
“You know what I want for Christmas?” Cas murmurs, reaching up and pushing a hand through Dean’s hair.
that they would get married,” she said smartly before turning on her heels and marching back into the living room, hands on her hips.
“It’s probably Jess wondering where we are,” he says, and sure enough, when he flips the phone over, Jessica Moore is on the caller ID.
“What do you wanna start with?” Dean asks lowly, backing Cas up until he is flush with the wall. Cas is still staring at the pamphlet in his hands. Needless to say, Cas is no longer concerned about work. “Page three?” Dean suggests, fingering open the pamphlet to page three, exposing a picture of two men stretched over a table, one very violently mid-thrust into the other. Cas’ face heats, and he reels farther away from the man. One of Dean’s hands slides down his chest, landing at his crotch. He squeezes gently, and with that, Cas side steps and drops the pamphlet to the ground.
“Cas,” she murmurs, but he is shaking his head.
“My mom died,” Dean says, and the kid before him blinks and sits.
He thinks he’s going to die here. His arms give when he tries to push himself up. His lungs feel like they’re sheathed in ice, like they’ll shatter on every exhale, but his breath is heaving in and out of him just the same.
“Hey, wait,” Dean says, stopping Cas with his hand on the door. Dean scoots closer to Cas and takes his hand again. Cas looks down to their joined hands, a blush creeping onto his cheeks. Dean doesn’t pull Cas’ hand to his lips, instead he bends down and plants a kiss against his knuckles. “I’ll see you later, okay?” Dean says, squeezing Cas’ fingers before pulling away and turning back frontwards. Dean, from the corner of his eye, sees Cas hesitate and then leave, never once looking back.
“I’m okay. Thanks.”
All at once, he is overwhelmed by Cas. He is breathing in that scent, nosing against his skull. He is laughing as he cries, shaking so hard that he doesn’t notice Cas isn’t holding him back. He only notices that something is wrong when he pulls apart, sliding his hands around to Cas’ face. Dean starts to lean in, thumbs brushing over the stubble on his cheeks, but Cas shies away from the motion straightaway. Dean pulls back concernedly, lets Cas go, and Cas immediately takes two steps back.
“I’m not yelling at you,” she says in a voice that is very admittedly not a yell.
“Castiel,” the woman drawls, though the door is shut between them. “Come in, please.” Cas pushes open the door and sees a smiling lady with smooth brown skin sitting behind a desk. Her hair is pulled back from her face with a scarf that matches the deep magenta of her pantsuit. She looks familiar to Cas. “Hi,” she says, rising to greet him. When Cas steps closer, she takes one of his hands in both of hers. He cannot decide where he knows her from. Her smile falls to sympathy when she speaks again. “I’m so sorry about Dean. I knew him and his brother well. Good boys…I even baby sat them once or twice while their dad was…well, otherwise unable.”
“What did his teacher say?” Cas asks, wiping tears from his eyes so he can look at Dean clearly.
“I said five more minutes, bitch,” Dean growls, but there’s no real malice in his voice. Sam’s not the one he’s angry with. It’s God. Even so, Sam calls him a jerk and lets him lie there in bed for five more minutes before he comes back in and wakes him. “Fine,” Dean moans and sits up in bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes before standing and getting dressed. He meets Sam downstairs a few moments later with his boots tied and his veins in desperate need of the song of coffee. “Let me get some caffeine and we’ll go,” Dean promises, reaching for the pot and a mug.
“Dean,” Cas shrieks, pushing Meg off him and fumbling for his pants, as though Dean hasn’t seen it all before. Dean, however, Dean is already scrambling down the ladder, jumping at the highest rung he can get away with and all but sprinting towards the house. “Dean, please wait,” Cas calls. Dean can hear him clambering his way down the ladder before jumping away and running after Dean. Cas eventually catches up with him, flinging a hand around Dean's arm to turn him around. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have brought her up there. That’s our place.”
“Nothing…I have no idea what so ever,” Sam says defeatedly. “I am the worst boyfriend ever.”
“Really?” he murmurs, tears rushing back to his eyes without his say so. “That’s, that’s fantastic. What do I need to do?” Cas asks, and as Missouri gives him paperwork and parenting advice and an extravagant amount of coupons for diapers because
“Sure, Cas,” he says, and so he does, starting all the way at the beginning. “My mom died when I was four…house fire."
“Dan invited him to get sodas together. So they went to get sodas, and Clarence had realized that it wasn’t wrong to love another boy, and he realized that after ten years, he hadn’t stopped loving Dan. So they talked and talked and talked until the moon started to show, but then Dan and Clarence began to fight over something silly, and Clarence got so sad about Dan being mean to him that he walked away. Well, Dan was very sad about Clarence walking way, so he ran after Clarence…and kissed him.” Emma giggles softly next to him.
," she mimics, stealing his words from moments ago and ignoring the main point of his words. Dean must be safe. "Cas, you’re not broken. You know that right?”
“Green,” he answers hesitantly, unsure of what the question has to do with anything.
“Thank God,” Cas says with a roll of his eyes and half a grin.
“You want to talk to her?” Dean asks, holding the phone out, but Sam shakes his head softly. “Hey, Jessica,” Dean answers, forcing his voice to sound bright.
When Dean gets back to his house, picket fence and all, he finds a tan, low-riding hunk of metal where his baby should be parked. He furrows his brow at the Kansas plates, but when he sees his gangly-ass, bitch of a brother, a grin the size of Montana stretches across his lips.
“But he’s the reason you’re here right? To keep him from being outed.”
Disentangling from Cas is the worst walk of shame Dean’s ever experienced. He feels the shame so, so deeply.
“Only if you want it.”
“You’ll like it,” Dean says softly. “Friends hang out together and have sleepovers and movie marathons and tell each other secrets that no one else can know.” Cas’ mouth twitches with what Dean thinks is a smile.
, and endless support. I honestly cannot thank you enough. I love you all and can't wait to hear your thoughts on part two!
Gabe comes in next, hours later without knocking.
“Don’t give up on him, okay?” Her voice is soft and sincere.
“No.”
have forgotten my birthday,” Sam cries, spit flinging from his lips and spattering into Dean’s shirt. “I miss her so much,” he says, then apparently, he tires of talking, instead taking to only sobbing into his brother’s shoulder. Dean just holds him tight, running gentle hands through his hair and rubbing soothing circles into his back like he barely remembers his mom doing for him. Eventually, Sam’s sobs slow, and after a few moment of mere clinging, he pulls away, wiping at his eyes. “Jesus Christ,” he says, pushing out a broken and fake laugh. “I’m thirteen years old. I shouldn’t be sobbing like that.”
“Yes. I’m cooking dinner, and there’s someone I want you to meet.” Dean grins at Cas and pulls away. Dean settles the bill inside to a round of applause from the nosy onlookers before leaving, Cas’ fingers threaded through his. Cas leaves from the grocery store to pick up Sam and Gabe, Dean tucks back inside to get steaks, and they all meet back at Dean’s house.
“No. It’s a closed adoption. When I leave here with her, we’ll never hear from her birth parents again. All she’ll have is me, me and Dean.”
Dean and chose him anyway. Of course, he loves Cas…
“Dean Winchester,” Dean says, staring up at the fierce woman before him. He feels like an ant under a magnifying glass. Her eyes narrow at the name.
” he finishes, staring at Bobby.
“Well, isn’t that just the most ingenious, cutting-edge idea that I’ve ever heard!” Dean barks with false excitement.
“I’m sorry it took
“No,” Cas says after a long moment of consideration. “I mean, you’re already the person I’m closest to. You were the first friend I ever made. You were the one who taught me to ride a bike. You were the first person I came out to. I don’t really think anything could make what we have weird unless we chose to let it.” Dean smiles at the memories Cas offers but wonders if he’s right. Is it possible to have the kind of relationship they have and add sexual endeavors to it without it changing into something ugly? “Never mind,” Cas says quietly, reading Dean’s thoughts as he often does. “I mean, I may be queer, but you’re straight. Not to mention you have that thing with Lisa. Never mind. I shouldn’t have asked; I just really liked kissing you, and I thought maybe,” but this time, Dean cuts Cas off.
“I love my children! I loved your father!”
“It's Cas,” he replies, not stopping, not sparing him a glance. He chokes back the memories pressing in around him, does not dare to even glance at the door with April Kelly's name on it. His hands shake at his sides.
Gabriel, to this day, doesn’t know what tore the inseparable pair apart. He knows that they were sleeping together by the time he left that last time for school, and when he came home, Cas had started going by Castiel and refused to speak about Dean at all. His very name was a taboo for everyone, even Anna refused to talk about it, refused to talk to Cas, always saying bitterly and angrily that Gabe could ask
boyfriend instead of hers, his
“It was love at first sight,” she says with a smile that, aside from the devil horns under her hair, looks perfectly normal. She cuts Dean a very pointed glance, one that says,
His mind screams, slamming hands against every flat surface as Castiel crumbles.
“What?” Dean asks, blinking stupidly at Cas. Cas tries to focus on Dean’s bed head instead of the disaster the play will be without its lead.
It is wrapped in an old t-shirt of Dean’s, one he’s very likely not to get back. He really doesn’t mind. He likes people seeing Cas in his clothes, even if they don’t know they’re his. Cas returns just as Dean gets the bow resituated on the fabric of the shirt. Cas approaches excitedly with a giftbag in hand, but Dean presses his gift forward first and wraps an easy arm around Cas’ waist as he takes it and begins to unwrap the t-shirt. “I hope you know I’m keeping this,” Cas mutters, motioning to the shirt.
“Really?” Dean asks, nosing against Cas. Cas laughs.
, when compared with…well, sodomy.” She kneels over Castiel now, eyes hooded as tears stream down his face.
“No, not you. I was talking to her,” he replies, running his hand over his car’s glossy, black finish. Cas snorts.
“Hey, Winchester,” Anna says, walking through and pushing his head slightly, a grin in her voice.
“Hello, Jessica,” Cas says when she steps close enough. She smiles nervously.
“Do you want to go back?”
eternity,
forgives him. So on the exhale, Cas lets himself believe that he does. He breathes out the remorse and the sorrow, and once the last of it passes through his lips, he tilts his head those last few inches and lets himself press his lips to Dean’s.
“When we broke up, why did you leave home?” As Cas’ voice fades, Dean stills, his heart slamming in his chest.
” he sputters finally, but his mother only smiles.
“No, I understand. You don’t know how many times I’ve watched you being a dork in public.” Cas pushes Dean's face away playfully, a grin on his face. “And when I watch you,” Dean continues seriously. “It takes
“Yeah, no, sure, definitely. I don’t want to talk about it. Ever. I mean, I’m completely supportive of this relationship because it’s been forever in the making, and everyone knows you kinda love each other, but lock a door! Balls!” he says and leaves the bedroom, holding a hand over his eyes and bumping into the frame on his way out.
“No, Daddy,” she giggles, crawling into his lap and resting her head against his sternum.
Dean didn’t make Cas wait much longer, though. Dean had mulled over what Cas said, mulled over everything that had happened, from the very first kiss to all the places it broke apart to where they are now, and he finally came to the conclusion that he loved Cas, more than he’s ever loved anything. He
"Okay, well since you both agree on the divorce, it's official. You're now divorced. Irreconcilable differences, I presume," she asks, holding the forms in her hand.
“Oh really? And what about you, Mr. Mom? A minivan? Really?” Dean laughs, eyes crinkling and stopping Cas’ heart. He was not expecting this playful banter. Dean is nothing like what he expected. He expected anger, and when that didn’t come, perhaps a stone-cold business, but here they are, teasing each other as they drive down the highway towards their next adventure. It feels like nothing has changed between them. Dean is beautiful.
“I hate it, Dean. I hate that everyone else gets to be with the one they love, and I don’t.” Cas huffs irritably, and Dean smiles.
“Even I thought that some days,” Cas agrees with a grin. He twists the engagement ring slowly.
“To the moon and stars and back a million times,” she says, a small smile growing on her face. Dean nods, his smiling mirroring hers.
“Not? But what about your job?”
, Cas. She’s dying.” Silence. Cas’ heart slams in his chest. It’s a truth Gabe has come to know, to accept after their mother told him nearly a month ago. It was a short phone call, a short trip back home, and a quiet acceptance. Cas, on the other hand, Cas is choking on the news.
I turned to someone else, someone who
Bobby comes down first, Charlie’s arm wrapped around his as she beams, a small bouquet of flowers in her hands. Following Bobby is Sam, Gabriel strolling along next to him, waving to the crowd and reaching for Sam just to embarrass him. Judging by the blush on Sam’s cheeks, it’s working, and Dean laughs, the nervous energy growing as Sam takes his place next to him. Emma comes next, skipping down the path and dropping petals with every step. Her blonde hair bounces as she comes hopping to a stop in front of Sam. There’s just one person left, and as He appears, dark hair a mess, blue eyes wild, Dean can’t help but remember what brought them here in the first place.
“What am I supposed to do, Gabriel?” Cas shouts, his hands thrown in the air as well.
“As much as you love me?” she asks, big blue eyes curious.
“I live at 406 Sceadan. That means you live right down the road from me.” The kid blinks at Dean again. “My name is Castiel Milton,” the kid says and pushes a hand with dirty nails out for Dean to take."You can call me Cas."
being read in Cas’ gravely voice. He smiled, half-stepped forward, but paused again when he heard Cas contort his voice into a piss-poor impression of a pirate. He was doing silly voices for Hook, and Dean almost asked the man to marry him right then and there. His heart thudded in his chest, and he knew that Cas was it for him. He’d known all along.
“He’s leaving me, Charlie,” Cas says finally, his voice shaking and teary. Her eyes widen, and the tears fall against Cas’ will. “
“Shit,” Cas hisses, pushing slowly in until his hips are flush with the curve of Dean’s ass. Dean’s fingers clutch at Cas’ shoulders, and Cas has his hands threaded into Dean’s hair, his lips resting against the side of Dean’s neck.
“Lisa, look, I like Cas. A lot,” Dean says with a shrug, bringing a hand to the back of his neck.
“I need you to be sure, ‘cause some things you can only tell your
"If you have someone you love," she begins gently, fiddling with the photo in her hands. "Hold on to him, make sure he knows you need him now more than ever, and go through the steps, Cas. Just do it. Hold on to him, and make your way through the steps as quickly as possible. Put a wall up around all the bullshit they’ll tell you, because they’re going to tell you some bullshit, and go home to him.” Cas stares at her for a long while, but she is looking at Gilda.
“Dean,” Cas starts, but Dean shakes his head a bit.
Dean, still not remembering that he’s hurt, counts it as a victory. Hell, even if he remembered that he was hurt, he’d still probably count making Cas laugh as a win.
It is from a publishing company, one with a mystical and complex logo that Castiel did not remember submitting to. It’s entirely possible though, that among the dozens of companies his book got sent to, he forgot the logo of one of them. Castiel didn’t know that the letter would ruin his life. No. How could he have? It was a thick letter; he thought it might be his first yes. That being said, he sets his coffee aside and tears into the letter eagerly.
“Of course he is, and if he doesn’t, then
“It’s mine!” Sam shouts, and Dean can tell by the twerp’s face that he is merely teasing little Jo. The pen he is holding over her head probably
“Dean,” he murmurs, because if anyone can make whatever this mess is that Cas has found himself in go away, it’s Dean. Dean hums softly, the sound vibrating his chest and Cas’ entire being. He pulls back to look at his best friend, his fiancé, but for a flash, all he sees is the first time he saw Dean, blood pooling slowly from the corner of his mouth, eyes staring at nothing in the shadow of that bridge, and Cas remembers everything with a rush of panic. He sucks in a breath, tears flooding his eyes. “This is a dream,” he whispers, barely able to get the words out. “He’s dead. Dean is dead.”
—whoa, Cassie, look at you go!” He lets out a low whistle upon spotting Dean in Cas’ bed. A blush runs across both their cheeks, but they only smile softly to each other. “Hey, I hope you’re not racking up my credit card bill!” He says, eyes widening, though for the sappy look on Cas’ face, he wouldn’t mind another grand or so being withdrawn from his credit card.
“Dean,” he says sheepishly, staring over at the sleepy-eyed man before him.
hers, but Sam likes having someone only a few years younger here to play with and bother.
instead of Cas. Lisa’s brow furrows together.
“I have no idea, your honor.” So she turns to Lydia.
“I don’t want you to say anything, Dean. I just.” Cas lets out a shaky breath and runs his hand through his hair again.
“Are you and him okay?” she asks, taking a seat next to him on the porch step.
“Sam is your brother?” Cas asks, running his fingers over the S.W. beside the D.W..
care about. I know you aren’t big on the touchy feely, and neither am I, believe me." Bobby takes a breath to slow his ramblings. "But I love you, son,” he finishes after a moment, and Dean's whole face heats again.
“So what are you going to do?”
“Why are Cas’ feelings so important to you?”
“Hello,” he chokes out, tears streaming down his face. She forces one of her tiny hands out of her bundle, waving it around as if to say hello. Cas slips his pinky into her grip. “I’m your new daddy, and I love you more than anything.” He runs his thumb and index finger along her velvety cheeks, crying all the while. Jess reaches out to touch her as well, as if to say that she were real and not just a figment of their imaginations. “You’re so beautiful,” he tells her, and leans down to kiss her forehead softly. He wishes he had shaved for her.
“Keep it objective, pal,” Judge Mills says to the lawyer, but he just nods and raises his eyebrows expectantly at Dean.
“There it is,” Dean groans, bracing his arms against the sink and hanging his head. Dean jumps at the hand Ellen presses between his shoulders.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” she says, looking appropriately shamed. “I didn’t mean it like that,” and she lets it drop.
Driving back to Him is nothing. It is a single heartbeat, the flash of a camera, one instant indiscernible from the next. It is the space between one word and the next. Dean blinks, and it is gone. He blinks, and he is there at the motel, fist slamming against Sam’s door because he doesn’t know which one is Cas’. Sam comes out almost as soon as the banging starts sporting eyes wild and hair rumpled.
“You say that like I don’t know,” Dean counters easily, but it hurts. Dean has always worked so goddamn hard to make his father happy… “I’m not leaving without Sam, and even if I wanted to, Sam wouldn’t let me. Where ever I go, he goes.”
And things are settled. And Dean’ll be goddamned if he isn’t going to start making things right.
“You asked what I wanted…that’s it.”
“Get your ass outta bed,” Dean says after a moment, not bothering to shield his gaze as Cas stretches, his lean muscles pulling and tightening. Cas groans as he pushes himself out of bed before pulling on a pair of sweatpants and a faded t-shirt that Dean’s almost sure belonged to him once upon a time.
“Please, Cas,” Dean moans against the side of Cas’ neck. “Don’t stop,” so Cas doesn’t. He moves against Dean, inside Dean, sweat slicking the slide of their bodies. The only things either of them can hear is the moans of the other and their own heart pounding inside their chests. Cas’ rhythm picks up steadily, going faster and harder and earning filthy moans for his efforts. “Fuck, Cas,” Dean groans, lifting his hips so that Cas’ every thrust hits against his prostate. Cas licks the sweat away from Dean’s neck and pulls a hand around front to grip Dean’s cock. He doesn’t give Dean a moment to ease into it. No, he just starts jerking Dean in time with the thrusting of his hips, hand clenched sure and tight and steady.
“Yeah, I heard you. You and Cas are dating, sort of.”
Dean wonders if maybe he's right... He sighs before pulling open the door and sauntering back into the library. He doesn’t see Cas, but he see’s Lisa, so he goes up to her and wraps an arm around her waist. “You ready?” he asks her, glancing down to the paperback she holds between her hands.
“Why didn’t you wake me up?” Cas asks, rubbing sleep from his eyes as he motions to Sam.
The drive back to the bunker is one of the longest of Dean’s life. They don’t talk about it. Don’t even come close, except the moment they cross the state line into Iowa, and Cas asks why he’d chosen Pontiac.
Dean ushers her inside, and from there, the trio sit around Dean’s tiny kitchen table and begin shifting Charlie into their lives. After catching up on what Gilda is wearing for the wedding, what Dean is doing for a living, and what kind of beer to season chicken with, Charlie looks at Cas sheepishly.
“You mean dear Dean?” She asks sweetly, and Cas’ jaw clenches at the sound of His name coming from between her filthy lips. “Pity, really. I hear he’s married now.” Her tone is conversational, airy.
“Sure, bug,” he tells her, entirely aware of just how likely it is that she will be taken from him for good before they ever get their ice cream. Even so, she sits down like he asked her to, and Dean puts his head in his hand. Sam puts a hand on his shoulder, feels the sobs shake his shoulders a few times before Dean straightens up and wipes the tears from his cheeks.
Gabe, however, is none too happy with the idea.
you go!)
“No!” Bobby shouts finally, and Dean sees Sam flinch. Dean doesn’t react. “No,” Bobby says, softer this time with a small shake of his head. “Boys, it’s just gonna be the same old song and dance. He’s not gonna treat ya’ any better than when you left.”
, jackass, and I hate metal. I already know who sent the fucking letter! It was the bitch from the clinic who tore us apart in the first place!”
“That’s bad for you,” a voice says, and Dean realizes he was so involved in watching Cas walk away that he missed the little sister slipping out behind him. Well, Dean supposes she isn’t so little any more. She’s only two years younger and just as beautiful as Cas. They are different, but equally beautiful. She is five feet, six inches of soft curves, porcelain skin, and smoldering green eyes. She is bow-shaped lips, sloping cheek bones, and long, red hair. She has every ounce of sex appeal that Dean’s ever been attracted to in a woman, but he could never be attracted to
is sitting. Sam spends his night running through the main points of Dean’s defense, then whittling down to the details and the facts of the situation. Cas spends his night alone in his room. He thinks of Dean, of what may happen when they see each other, of what he might say to Dean to make it right.
assholery, verbal degrading, mention of a panic attack, depression, belittling, telling him he's a fuck up (not sure of the verb for that), and just general making to feel like he's worthless. I'm sorry...
was what steady was for me!”
“Cas, you know, I—”
“We’re here now,” he murmurs, and Dean smiles.
When they pull up, Bobby comes to the door with a shotgun in hand, cocked and ready to roll. Dean jumps from the car with his hands up, though getting shot would probably be an improvement on his day so far.
“I’m not
“Bela, please,” he gasps, leaning away from her seeking hands and teeth and tongue. “I don’t want to do this.” Bela laughs, her hands demanding of their conquest.
“Thanks, Sammy. Tell Jess the same.” Then he’s off to first period to stare at the empty desk with Cas’ name on it, the silence at the “Castiel Milton” portion of roll call.
“Dean,” Sam says, pulling away and opening his mouth.
“Then what’s stopping you?" Dean growls, pushing against Cas’ straining dick once again, his own reaching a crisis point. He removes one of his hands from Cas’ chaotic hair to sit back, unzip, and take it in hand. Cas’ lips part hungrily at the sight of Dean’s swollen and leaking cock, even going so far as to lick his lips before he speaks, his eyes still on Dean’s penis.
That morning finds Dean sprawled on his stomach, Metallica playing softly in his ears to drown out Sam’s television constantly blaring in the next room. Sam can’t sleep without it, and Dean can’t sleep with it, so his headphones are a resentful compromise. He is so enveloped in Metallica and…well, sleep, that when Cas knocks on his window, he doesn’t stir in the slightest. Cas climbs through the screen they’d long since removed anyway.
shoot his load all over Cas just because of some stupid claim that didn’t mean anything anyways. Dean flicks his ashes with a sigh.
“What?” Dean asks, pulling away slightly, his fingers stuck between the belt and the warm stretch of flesh at Cas’ waist.
“Who,” he growls, tugging a bit to get the point across. “
you, Dean. This isn’t about bringing Meg into the tree house, but you won't
“We’re here,” Cas says finally, spreading his palms along the flat of Dean’s skin. Dean
him? This is your son!”
“Five more minutes,” Dean mumbles, pressing his face back into the pillow. He was dreaming of Cas, as he often is. He was dreaming of a beach and Cas laid out next to him, skin shining in the sun. He was dreaming of sand and waves and the smell of salt in the air. He was dreaming of lazy kisses and no one to tell him he’s wrong for loving Cas.
“Did he get my letter? I sure hope it didn't
“Thanks.” Then Dean is excluded from their conversation, not intentionally, of course, but that’s just how couples are. When they get together, the rest of the world ceases to exist. It’s not Sam’s fault if Dean just becomes part of the rest of the world when he’s with Jessica. It’s not Sam’s fault that every time he thinks of Cas, the rest of the world ceases to exist, but he’s entirely alone. It’s not Sam’s fault, but Dean doesn’t want to spend his birthday as the third wheel. “I’m just going to catch up with you guys later,” Dean says, rising to leave and being pushed back down by a large and rowdy hand.
He doesn’t see Cas that night. Instead, he has sex with Lisa and pretends he doesn’t mind that she isn’t Cas. He doesn’t see Cas the next morning. Instead, he accepts a blow job from Lisa and barely holds back Cas’ name as he comes. It’s lunch when he finally sees Cas again, and lucky for him, Meg is close behind. Cas is smiling.
“I should get going, actually,” he says, causing Emma to let out a low groan.
” Cas burrows deeper into his sheets, determined to ignore the serenader. Who wants to be woken up before their alarm on any day, nevermind on their birthday? “
“There’s one more person who wants to see you,” he says, and takes Cas’ hand in order to lead him upstairs. When they top the last step, Cas is staring straight into the face of his baby sister.
“Right,” the man says, pushing his hands into the pockets of his khakis.
do you believe homosexuality is wrong?” she asks, voice chipper and head cocked to the side. Cas brings his eyes up from the floor.
“I’m just here to help you, Castiel. There is no need to be hostile with me.” Naomi takes a deep breath, and Cas wants nothing more than Dean here with him. “It says here," she says, motioning to her clipboard. Cas cranes his neck, and before she shifts, he swears he sees his mother's handwriting. Naomi continues, regardless. "That you willingly agreed to seek out help. That is a big step, one that I was
Silence.
“Happy birthday,” Bobby comments dryly, his hands still wrapped around Dean’s wrist where he stopped it mid-swing.
“That’s only reasonable,” Cas says, and Dean’s eyes fall. Cas takes the hand of Dean’s that isn’t holding his shoulder into both of his and squeezes. “My parents kicked me out for liking men, and I still miss them. Parents are people you never stop missing, as much as you’d like to.”
“Come in,” Dean calls, and sure enough, that mop of hair pokes its way through Dean’s door.
they would be here and wouldn’t decide they no longer wanted me! At least I was fucking
Dean's whole body, despite the past and the regret, is singing with the closeness of Him. If Dean thought he was buzzed from Sam, he is positively wasted off Cas. He is completely caught up in the moment, in the movement and the pull of Cas, like it’s all he’s ever known. His life between then and now never existed. All that he is, all that he ever will be, is Cas and the smile he tosses back to him when Dean’s hand reaches to open his door.
He is six, staring up at his father's alcohol glazed eyes.
Castiel sends his story to several publishing companies. He hears nothing but no’s back. He buys a new rug for his living room. He thinks it makes the place look warmer. His mother comes by often, even though he has moved nearly two hours away from Sceadan Street. They don’t talk much, just sit in the familiarity of each other’s silence.
“Okay. Can we order pizza for supper?” he asks, and Dean’s eyes snap to him.
“What’s up, Clarence?” Meg says, leaning forward on her elbows and cocking her head to Cas. Dean rolls his eyes.
“Garth told me,” Lisa spits, and Dean fights the urge to roll his eyes.
“I don’t think you understand,” Cas murmurs, his eyes falling from Dean’s, but his chin is quickly lifted, returning their eye-contact.
“You’re coming with us to Seattle?” Gabe asks, saying
Across the street, a kitchen window slides back into place, and a call is made collect to one Naomi Christiansen.
“Nope.”
“Yes," she replies shortly, clearly irritated as she crosses her arms over her chest.
“It tickles,” Cas says with a grin. Dean stares at Cas for a long moment before slipping his hands from beneath the band and pulling Cas closer to him by the arch of his hipbones.
“See that window over there?” Cas asks, hanging upside down from the tree in his front yard, an arm stretched out as he points. Dean sits in the grass at the trunk, staring up at Cas. “That’s my room. I have an aquarium. Would you like to see?”
“I don’t want to talk about this, Cas,” Dean murmured finally, unwinding his arm from Cas’ shoulders to all but curl in on himself. Sleeping little Emma pulled away from Cas too, curling into Dean’s side and letting out a content huff of air. Dean’s fingers begin brushing through her hair as they often do when he’s anxious.
“Don’t go, mom,” he pleads, sobbing against her. She strokes his hair and shushes him, tears of her own streaking down her cheeks.
“Sixth?” John guesses after a long moment, and Sam’s face turns sour before he can even get the end of the word out.
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean grumbles, wriggling lower in his seat. He sits there for the whole of the lunch period before pulling himself up and heading to math.
A burst of something dark rushes through him, but Castiel silences it quickly. He does not want to be disgusted by Dean; he has worked hard to push Dean from his thoughts altogether. Even so, when he skips to the bottom of the letter—desperate to see the signature waiting there—and reads,
“Cas,” Dean chokes out, tearing his eyes away from his mother to look up at his softly smiling boyfriend.
is your problem?” she shrieks, stomping her foot prissily.
‘Yeah, I’ll bet,” Dean snorts. Cas steps forward, his eyes dark, his lips slightly parted.
“Do you think he’ll tell anyone? Dean, my mom
“Your wife is lovely,” Cas says softly, watching Dean's lips because he can.
"Well," she continues, turning her eyes from Dean. "I guess that doesn't change the state of your divorce," she replies with a small shrug. "However, it is something to consider when discussing the next matter in today's trial. It says here that you're also trying for total custody of your daughter. Is that accurate?"
“Thank you.” He does not feel her. He hurts too much to feel anything but Dean pushing him away.
“That’s a great idea, bug. Cas, do you want to get ice cream with us?” and what can Cas do but push out a broken laugh and nod like his life depends on it.
Cas fucking left. Cas never loved him. Dean groans and jerks the pot from beneath the brewer. He pours his coffee angrily, angry at himself for being angry. He does not want this rage. He doesn’t want to hate Cas. He
“I’ll be there in a second,” he says, catching a glimpse of his reflection in the windshield. He barely recognizes himself, eyes bloodshot, face pale, hair wild. He closes his eyes, wipes away the remains of his tears and puts his head back on the steering wheel.
Not really. I'm a sadist. Next up is the last chapter of part two, i.e. really fucking painful... Brace yourselves...
“Dean yes!!!”
Dean looked at Cass for a moment before letting go of both his hand and his wing. Cass stumbled back, being hit by too many feelings at once.
Dean had always imagines angel wings to be fluffy, white, feathery and all. Cass’s wings were black. And almost metallic. And they were huge. Sweeping the floor.
Dean continued to look puzzled and Cass cleared his throat.
Charlie laughed on the other side, “
“It’s not like that. He’s just. He’s
Both brothers sat up abruptly at Cass’s voice. He stood near the door. His head cocked to the side – looking as adorable as only Cass could.
Sam nodded.
“Clean yourself up, you look like a fucking mess,” He whispered before running a hand through his distraught hair. Dean looked at him – flushed face, swollen lips, and sweat decorating every part of visible skin.
Cas yawned wearily, his hand tightening on the steering wheel as he blinked. He repeated the six names in his head. The names of the six quarks – the fundamental particles that made
“Charlie!”
He turned to the bathroom mirror.
The speed of the car increased as his mind kept thinking. Home. His father. Sam.
Quarks made atoms, atoms made molecules, molecules made humans and wood and metals and all that shit. He was still pissed off at Benny for kicking him out in the middle of the night just because Benny and Lisa were getting all cozy. Cas huffed, even on a group study night his best friend was thinking about sex.
He looks at me, worry flickering in his blue eyes for a split second before he nods.
*Dunks herself in holy water*
Choose? Is there a choice? What exactly does he think is going on here? I was never going to choose him. There was never any choice – it’s a damn fling, if even that. That was made clear. No one falls for anyone. And Anna’s not perfect; she’s made some bad decisions just like I have. But we can work. He can’t go around throwing accusations.
“You can’t leave,” I say.
“Cas wait,” I say, but he walkes out with me, dragging me to the stairs of the motel. Okay, enough manhandling for one day. I place a hand on his sternum and shove him into the wall of the corridor.
Sam grinned, “Yes! Yes!”
“My turn.”
walk in on you kissing Castiel Novak?” Anna says, her voice wavering and I walk to her, my hand touching her shoulder and she backs away – shying away from my touch. What the fuck?
And he fucking deserved it, I nearly say. He insulted Castiel, and punched
Where the fuck was that boy and what had he
He rested his head, by now pounding like hell, against the steering wheel. He inhaled the familiar leather smell of the car and sighed. He could fight. He should fight… but to what end. Dean started the car, and drove in direction of the hotel he was currently staying in. Almost an year in New York, and he still didn’t have a place to call his own.
“Leave her. Or leave me,” he says, and I stare at him. Is he fucking serious?
“Dean,” Cass said, his voice gruff.
“Anna?” he asks and I nod.
Chapter 2:
“Yeah,” he nods, smiling, “That little
Dean would’ve had no problems with the cold shouldering Castiel. But there was an issue. Dean and Sam went to the Novak’s house almost
Instead, he saw relief, acquiescence, something just shy of desperation.
I am aware of my eyebrows shooting up a little. I ignore his hand and look at Crowley. “What happened to Jody?”
I try not to flinch. I fail.
“What?” I ask.
Cas looked at his brother’s arm around Sam’s shoulder and it hit. Cas smirked, surprised that a casual display of affection from his gay brother could give him such an idea.
Dean laughed, standing up – his knees cracking and his uncomfortably hard cock rubbing against his jeans. Cas stared at him, his lips swollen and eyes wide.
“What the actual fuck?”
Castiel’s words echo in my head like they usually do and have done. However, these words are the ones that echo most these days. My success was stumbled upon. Everyone knows it. The fans know it. The tabloids know it. The reporters know it. But I know it more than anyone else does.
A new song kicks in. And I sing.
“We should talk,” Cass whispered into Dean’s mouth.
“No listen,” I say, “We have sex, Cas. We’re not a couple.”
“Charlie?” he asked.
“You’re stupid, Castiel,” Dean said.
“You know who told my father, Dean?”
“Actually,” Gabriel smirked, “I was hoping to spend some time with Sammy too.”
The thing with being an artist is, you learn to notice the smallest of details. I notice the calluses on his fingers. He plays. I notice how rough his skin is. I notice the glint in his eyes because he knows he has won.
“You don’t get to walk away from me,” I say, ignoring how stupid I sound.
“Sexually,” he explained, and Dean’s eyes went high.
“Go somewhere else! Fucking conjure a TV,” Dean looked at Sam for help, but his brother seemed completely at ease with Gabriel hijacking their room.
I groan and turn over, lying on my stomach. My head buried in my pillow. I hope she leaves. I hope it is for real this time. Because she always seems to come back. Sticks to me like a goddamn leech. Probably because the LV bags and the limo rides don’t come when you’re dating a normal bloke.
“Oh, shit!” Dean recoiled a little when he saw Cass’s bare chest but them straightened up. His face lit up as he saw the wings – Castiel’s wings – protruding from his back.

“But he
“All right, Winchester. Truth or dare?” He said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
“Even
“Then why did you…?”
“Sam changed his name?” Cass frowned.
“Uh…hi?”
I raise my eyebrows and Cas laughs.
I go through an internal debate in five seconds. Is this dude trying to fuck me? Castiel Novak, notorious womanizer? I open my mouth to answer. The air hostess looking to fuck me in the bathroom comes near the bathroom, sees Dean, scowls and walks away.
