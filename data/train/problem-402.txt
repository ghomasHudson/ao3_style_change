“Huh?” Sherlock asked, somehow having lost track of their conversation, hadn’t they just been discussing mothers? Or rather, his mother?
»Hell, Sherlock!«, he yelled still drugged with sleep, opening his eyes a little to peek at his alarm clock. 2 AM. Great. It took a few moments, but then the music cut off and he heard the door close downstairs.
“Yep.” Janine said and chuckled again, “So quit swooning and read. He’s not going to let us get away with doing nothing for very long.”
” he said with a roll of his eyes, raising his voice at the last bit and biting back a smile when he heard rustling from the inside, before the door opened.
“You sure this is the place you meant to go?” Sherlock asked sceptically, looking at Janine, who just grinned.
"Did my ears betray me? Did you just admit you love your parents?" his father said with a playfully raised brow, chuckling deeply.
“I’ll.. keep that in mind.” Sherlock said and walked out of the room with his head spinning around that whole conversation, but mostly around that moment when they smiled at each other like that. He just couldn’t stop thinking about it.
Sherlock tried to shake her hand off, "I'm not shy! It's illogical to send a person like me to a public school. That's why you and Dad decided to hire private teachers for me and Mycroft in the first place, remember? The chance I'll be bullied is rather high. Kids are cruel. I'll be insulted and probably beaten! Is that what you want? Is that some sort of punishment for the kitchen? I told you I didn't blow up the fridge on purpose. I only calculated it the chemicals wrong because Redbeard was sick and I was distracted!" he rambled and turned his back to his Mum, crossing his arms.
Sherlock huffed, grumbling a barely audible, "Sorry." His mother was the only person on this planet Sherlock found somewhat intimidating. "But sending
“Interesting choice. Though, I’d have thought you’d go with a dress,” Sherlock said, noticing that it was definitely too short to be a dress.
»Sh... Sherlock... what the f...« he began weakly, but Sherlock silenced him by capturing John's lips with his own. His eyes widened for a second, yet then they fluttered shut and he melted into the other man's arms. Instinctively, he rolled onto his side and snaked his arms around Sherlock's neck, pulling him even closer and burying his hands into his glorious ebony curls, tugging softly as he rolled them fully around, placing himself on top of Sherlock, being used to take the dominant part when it came to actions like this. He didn't know what was going on here, but he definitely liked it. He liked it a lot.
“See, I told you we’d become friends with Mr Watson, jush-lik-dat!” Janine said and tried to snap her fingers, although she failed miserably and just a couple of seconds later became pale as a sheet. “I think I..” she began, but Sherlock cut her off, he was dizzy as hell, but he was still able to tell that Janine was about to throw up.
But even more embarrassing than the form was the fact that Sherlock had painted several bees on it which were shaping a heart and in the middle he had written in his premature handwriting 'Best Mormy Ever' - he had even spelled Mummy wrong. It was humiliating.
Somehow she had actually managed to make it look good. The way she had cut it, even the colour looked better.
“That is so cool.” Janine said and laughed again, “I mean.. don’t get me wrong, I would have also liked you if you weren’t.. but it’s just that little bit more cool. I’ve never met a rich kid that’s not a douche.”
He had no idea, why he chose that night in particular, but he was glad he had done it. It was a bold move, he had to admit, but even in the dark Sherlock was able to deduce John. The increased heart rate he had felt on John's neck when he had touched it in the beginning, the sound of his voice - every reaction had made Sherlock more confident, though he hadn't even planned to go this far. But it was the most intense experience Sherlock had ever made and he wouldn't want to miss it, not even for the most complex and trickiest murder that could possibly happen.

He would spend a few weeks with her, until she – just like any of her predecessors – would dump him because of Sherlock. John had really liked all those girls, but they were all right. Sherlock was always more important than each one of them. No matter what, Sherlock was John's number one. Unfortunately. Unwanted. Life ruining – in fact.
»Thank you...«, John called into the darkness. He had to admit, though, when it wasn't two in the morning, he loved to hear Sherlock play, to watch how his fingers moved across the strings and the peaceful expression on the man's face when he was sunk into the melody. Actually, John loved everything about Sherlock – not that he would ever admit it.
happen to like his attitude.” Janine said and laughed along with Sherlock. “Either way, then let’s scan the crowd, anyone here you
“I don’t know.. just woke up early.” Sherlock played it off, while actually, he had set his alarm this early because he was planning on being on time for Mr Watson’s class – in fact, he was planning to be not five, but ten minutes early. Partly to see the look on the man’s face, but also because Mr Watson seemed like a good person to have on his side. After all, Mr Watson really didn’t have the best first impression of him and still he had gone and pulled that whole show with Anderson about his class bullying Sherlock. So yeah, he felt like he was a force to be reckoned with and he’d prefer to have that force on his side, rather than against him.
“That’s not a wild card and you know it, dear.” His mother said with a soft smile. “Next weird thing I find in the fridge and it’s the same routine as always.”
He hadn't expected the wave of laughter that followed quickly, the whole group in the smoking corner looking at him, pointing at him even. Perfect.
“Janine, no. First of all.. he doesn’t seem like the type to give anyone special treatment in school and second.. It would just be too weird, okay?” he said and looked back at John, who was already looking at them as well, giving Sherlock a small smile as their gazes locked for a moment and Sherlock’s stomach seemed to do a backflip. Then, before Janine had the chance to notice that John had acknowledged their presence, he had already looked away, continuing to chat with his friends.
"Have a nice day, dear!" he heard his Mum call right before he closed the door and started to walk, the school was only five minutes away. His flat at Baker Street was half an hour away by foot, which meant that he whether had to cycle to school or he'd take a cab every morning – of course he could as well get up earlier, but he didn't want to. So cab it was, then.
Walking through the corridor, Sherlock headed for the backdoor he had found this morning as he was looking for a spot to smoke, passing it and making his way over the back of the gym, where a bunch of large trees were standing, the ground covered in cigarette butts, letting Sherlock know that he wasn't the first one finding this spot useful.
“Well.. it’s a work in progress.” Sherlock said and shrugged, failure in progress was probably a better way to put it, but he didn’t want to worry his mother … or make her reconsider putting him on that school, if he was entirely honest.
He wasn't all that special. He was nothing. He was just another idiot. An idiot with a pretty face maybe, but still an idiot. His IQ was probably average at best and he was rude. And it took a lot for Sherlock to point that one out. There was a difference between being just dumb and being dumb and rude.
"Can I skip breakfast today?" Sherlock asked and only reluctantly he swallowed the bite he was still chewing on. He was much too nervous to eat anything. Or well, nervous wasn't quite the right way to put it. He was anxious. He wouldn't wonder if he'd end up in hospital. Yet maybe that would be good, though. If Mum would see that Sherlock was in fact bullied and beaten, she would hopefully finally forget about her stupid idea of Sherlock
– straighten the knocker. Due to hormones – tedious things, thank god Sherlock hadn't had to deal with them yet – mothers were basically unable to find their own children weren't perfect no matter how far away they were from that term. Fathers had a similar problem, but it wasn't as bad as it was with mothers.
, if you ever be late to my classes from this moment on and/or smoke on school ground, you'll suffer the consequences. Any breach of the school's rules will entail a disciplinary warning letter that is supposed to be picked up by either your parents or legal guardian. Three of those and you'll get a fourth letter along with it, as that'll be your invitation to your expulsion hearing. Understood, Holmes?« the man finished in a stern manner, now crossing his arms in front of his chest and Sherlock found his attitude would rather suit a military officer than a highschool teacher.
“I second that.” John said and Janine swirled around to look at the new voice and would have crashed into the table next to theirs in the process if it hadn’t been for John catching her.
“Take it from a professional, if Irene’s flirt attempts worked on you like a cold shower, but you’re pretty much drooling over Mr Watson and yeah you were, don’t even try to deny, I have eyes, my dear friend.” Janine said and chuckled, “You’re definitely gay.”
“Yeah.. er.. I just thought if I'm up anyway, I might as well go and look around the school a bit more.” Sherlock made up on the spot and turned to leave, before his mother realised he was fibbing, “See you later, mum!” he said and walked out the door.
, pleasure to meet you, Holmes. But you know what I'm wondering...« she babbled on and Sherlock pulled another cigarette out, certainly not going for the other one again.
“Fine.. you’re such a spoilsport.” Janine said and chuckled, shaking her head. “Okay, back to operation finding Sherlock a boyfriend then.” she said and nipped at her beer. “Aw yuck… that doesn’t taste even remotely like I thought it would. How is something that tastes so godawful this popular?”
“Holy shit.. you seriously live here?” she asked and continued to stare at the cottage. Admittedly it was a very large cottage, not excessively so when you considered that it was meant for four people. He could see where she was coming from, though, especially compared to her home. Not that there was anything wrong with it. It was a cosy townhouse and decently sized, but yeah, it was definitely another price class.
»I was wondering if Mr Holmes has a first name?« she asked and Sherlock couldn't fight a little huffed chuckle.
“Lock. I’ve decided that it’s the perfect nickname for you, also if I say Sherlock all the time, I’m bound to get caught up in some tongue twisters. It’s that or Shazza. Take your pick.”
What he knew, though was that from now on, he'd need another place to go for a smoke, preferably far, far away from this whole bloody building and everybody it contained.
With a roll of his eyes, he made his way through the hall, feeling the average IQ rise immensely by his mere presence – and also feeling slightly intimidated, not by certain persons, but by the large amount of people. God, he hated that. Finally reaching the locker that was his, he stuffed his books into it and first of all got rid of that terrible blazer and tie, opening the two top buttons of his shirt and hitching up his sleeves. - it would help with his plan, he figured and it helped immensely to not feel so insecure anymore, now that he was looking a bit more like himself.
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes!" Mummy called and Sherlock sighed in annoyance as he heard footsteps on the stairs which were coming too fast too close to his door until Mummy eventually entered the room. "Move your bum out of the bed and get dressed. You don't want to be late on your first day, do you?"
Sherlock lowered his kisses down John's neck while his slender fingers teasingly slowly unbuttoned John's pyjama jacket, eventually reaching his waistband and pulling down John's pants.
“That chemistry may not be my strong suit, but sewing is. My brother always wore the largest size they have here, I mean you’d fit into it at least four times, easily, but the sleeves should be long enough at least. We’re going to my place first to pick up the jacket and my sewing kit. And I’ll fit it for you at your place.”
»What?« he sighed, his voice dripping with disinterest as he lit up his cigarette, this time making sure to hold it a little away from that Irene woman.
“Are we all done gossiping now?” Mr Watson asked in his military manner, looking around the class that grew quiet in an instance. “Right then. Would anyone be so kind to let me be part of the fun?”
“No..” Sherlock said and walked into the room after Mr Watson, still busy figuring out what was so different about the man today.
“Sure.. just as long as I don’t have to carry you home.” He said and leaned over to look into the menu as well. “How about starting off with a classic and try sex on the beach.”
Johns breath stuck in his throat as Sherlock rolled them over in his turn, moving himself on top of John and straddling his thighs.
Sherlock just nodded, still being utterly startled and even a little intimidated by the other man as Mr Watson pointed over to a free seat in the back of the class.
Preparation. Okay. Right. For a moment, he sat knelt behind Sherlock, tempted to switch on the light to see what he was doing. To make sure he didn't do anything wrong, ignoring that he had no idea what he was doing anyways. He knew the human anatomy though, thank god he did.
“I’m not carrying my passport around with me.” She complained and Sherlock smiled, pulling out his phone, where he had photos of both his and Janine’s ID (from when they had been discussing whose picture looked worse). He had figured back then those might come in handy eventually.
»Sherlock?!« Blinking against the light and covering his eyes, John rolled on his side to look into the direction that familiar voice came from. »What for heaven's sake are you doing in here?«
She smiled, looking at the cup, "Because my very beloved son made it for me and because he's become rather sparingly with expressing such sentiment towards others."
“Didn’t you say you’d come by later today?” Sherlock asked and chuckled a little as he first let his mum hug him before Janine went to hug him as well.
He could have cried. Of course it hadn't been real. How could he have ever believed, it was? Like there was anything realistic about Sherlock Holmes sneaking into his bedroom and seducing him that way. God, he felt so stupid. It was embarrassing, really. Giving a silent, frustraded sigh, he stood up and slipped into his morning gown before making his way down the stairs and into the living, where Sherlock was lying on the sofa, eyes closed. John's heart skipped a beat, seeing him – it was almost like he could still feel the man's hands all over his body. His full lips still around his … no stop! It wasn't a good idea to think about that. Not now. Not ever.
Time passed slowly and Sherlock felt like even watching an hour glass would have been more exciting than listening to A level english. He was almost bored enough to actually work.
I hear from now on using any kind of slurs, or making fun of another student. And it’ll be doubled for any new mishap on your parts. I do not tolerate bullying in my classes.”
He froze as he felt Sherlock wrapping his arms around his middle, the sound of the man's purr still in his ears and shivers running down his spine. What was Sherlock doing? His heart was in his mouth and it took his whole strength to keep his lower half calm.
For a moment, John was grateful for the darkness, allowing him to hide the way his face flushed deep red, which was good. Hell, he just hoped the blood would continue shooting up his face. It would be embarrassing if it would flow into the opposite direction.
“Don’t worry, I’ve got you.” Sherlock said and held the phone out to the barkeeper, who took it. “Mine’s on the photo right after that.” He said.
“True, but out of the two of us, you’re still the baby..” Janine said and grinned at him, “I’ve made an outfit for you that you’re going to look absolutely bloody stunning in and you and I are going to out there and outshine everyone else.” she said and smirked, “We may even find ourselves a boyfriend.” she said, waggling her eyebrows and Sherlock snorted.
“Okay, we totally have to go to a bar tonight now that you’re finally not a baby anymore,” Janine said immediately. “I mean, not saying we should get wasted or anything, but like we need to celebrate!”
"You look good. With a decent shirt and trousers, it really doesn't look so bad." His dad said, glancing up from his papers and looking Sherlock up and down.
“Alright.” he said, figuring that when it came to clothes he might as well trust her. “Any trousers or should I take some of my own.”
»Morning...« John muttered then, averting his eyes after a slightly too long moment of staring at the other and trying to let his voice sound normal. »Coffee?« he asked and sighed silently, barely audible. God, how he wished it had been reality. But it was not and he had to deal with it.
“Stop being a drama queen.” his mother said and chuckled, shaking her head, “I’m serious, is it as bad as you thought?”
“Well, you sure are full of surprises, Mr Holmes.” Mr Watson said, looking down at his papers and Sherlock scrunched up his nose.
Sherlock just stared blankly at the man. It felt like he was talking to a whole different person than the one that had been giving him hell yesterday morning. More similar to the one from biology class, but still miles away from.. this. He was
. Sherlock even hated how that word sounded. Rules were just a social construct, made up by authorities to keep the public in line – or pupils for that matter. He sure as hell wasn't going to arrive five minutes early, nor was he about to wear that uniform
Only now looking at his lesson plan, he sighed. English, Biology, then Chemistry. Yeah, like they could actually teach him something new. So several hours of boredom before the first break. Great. Taking everything he needed – or not needed, seeing as he wasn't going to pretend he was studying if there was nothing to learn – he walked to the first class, managing to arrive fifteen minutes too late at the classroom, seeing as he had decided to go for a smoke and had had to look for a good spot before. The smoking bad boy who didn't bother if he was too late. That could actually work.
"I fear I don't, my dear son." Mummy said and Sherlock didn't even have to look up at her to know she was smirking.
»Okay...« he whispered and despite the fact that it was dark anyways, John closed his eyes, giving Sherlock full control.
“Charming.” She said and grinned, picking up her handbag, “Off to the pub we go then.” She said and linked arms with Sherlock as they made their way down the stairs.
“Just trust me, okay? Put it on and leave the first three buttons open.” Janine instructed and Sherlock eyed the shirt again, before shrugging.
He couldn't even tell what had happened just now. Sherlock had never been lost for words or unable to gave a snarky reply. It was a mystery to him that the man's whole appearance had thrown him off the track like that.
“Well.. that’s what Janine and I did up here. She gave me her brothers old school jacket, because it’s got longer sleeves and she fitted it for me. She’s a demon with needle and thread.” Sherlock said and smiled, looking down at himself.
“Sherlock, I know… everyone knows. You made quite an entrance today.” She said and smiled, “Personally, my favourite part was when you turned down Irene, that was awesome. That like.. never happens.” She said and shuffled a little closer. “Don’t you have a book yet? We can share mine, here.” She said, pushing her book in the middle of their table.
“There’s no middle way approach with you, is there?” he heard an amused and familiar voice say behind him as he arrived at the classroom, making him spin around to face out of all people – Mr Watson.
Sherlock sighed, gritting his teeth ever so slightly, his mouth forming a thin line. » There's a difference between being shy and not being interested and with you, it's the latter.« he stated firmly, pressing his back tightly against the wall now and feeling a little trapped as there was no way to escape this girl. If that was what his mother meant by making friends, then Sherlock was right to have been wary about it.
“Yeah, you did and I am still doubting your sanity over that.” Sherlock teased, making Janine giggle.
“And your point is?” Sherlock asked and bit back a smirk about her comment (which could have just as well come out of his mouth) as they started to walk towards the exit.
With a sigh, Sherlock lifted his head, scrunching up his nose, "I love you, Mum." he said reluctantly and stood up, grabbing his bag which he had placed next to his chair, watching from the corner of his eye how his Dad put his papers down,
“I mean, yeah, it would be kinda weird, but also kind of awesome.. like who knows if we like actually become friends with him, we’d have major back up in school, if anyone gives us shit, we just let him know and he deals with them!” Janine said excitedly and Sherlock shook his head.
quite cute and certainly nicer to look at than most other teachers.” Janine said and then got back to reading for good.
“Alright, alright, I get it, parental supervision not appreciated.” his mother said with a snicker, “Well, I’ll go serve the cake then,” she said and walked into the kitchen, still chuckling to herself.
»...we clear on that?« Mr Watson finished, his hands placed over his beige, slightly grey-ish woolen jumper on his hips as he was speaking and Sherlock needed another minute to unbend, before he frowned at the just slightly taller man (Sherlock gave it three months and he'd be taller than Mr Watson).
Walking into the room (at least he was almost on time), he already expected that teacher to flip again and spotting him, he did seem like he was about to stand up to do just that. Well he’d be having a hard time making himself audible through all the chatter about what just happened outside. Man, it really didn’t take long for rumours to spread around here. Sighing to himself, he moved to an empty seat and flopped down, before noticing the person next to him. Brunette girl, looking mildly annoyed, either by him or the chatter of the crowd, he couldn’t tell and he wasn’t that interested either as he was still waiting for Mr Watson to say something. Yet the man still hadn’t moved and his expression that had been annoyed before had now turned into something else that he couldn’t put his finger on. And the lecture? It just didn’t come. Despite him being a tad bit late and still not wearing his uniform ‘properly’. He would have expected the man to make a fuss about it, even though he had said that he was supposed to change his behaviour by tomorrow, which had been said
Okay, John didn't exactly turn Sherlock's world upside down, yet, but in the next chapter then, promise ♥
Doing as he was – more or less – told, Sherlock sighed, chewing a mouthful of cereals. Girls weren't even his area. Not that he would have had an actual area when it came to this, but he knew for a fact that he was naturally preferring boys. Women just didn't interest him in general, they were just there, while there – he had to admit – have been boys he had considered somewhat good-looking, but that was all. He had never been interested in anyone and that was good.
.« Mr Watson mused, visibly satisfied with himself, but still far from smiling . »Sit then.« the man said and Sherlock obeyed, strolling sheepishly through the class and over to what was seemingly his seat for now. » Oh and Holmes, the next time I see you, you
“You look like a million dollars.” Janine said in awe of her handiwork as the two stood in front of the mirror attached to his wardrobe and Sherlock chuckled.
“No, that’s for me, although you would totally rock some eyeliner and mascara. But I do plan to do your hair, we’re going to tame those curls or die trying.” Janine said and Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh again when she continued, “Well, that is until we really have to go to out if we don’t want to arrive when everyone’s going home.”
“Drinks are on me tonight, okay, so you might as well try your way through all the beverages they offer.” Sherlock said, figuring that she was working on a budget here, which was totally alright, but he kinda wanted her to have fun tonight and not think about money issues.
Mummy only laughed softly at that, continuing to stroke Sherlock's head, not minding that Sherlock had tried to stop her from doing that – well, actually he kind of liked it even, not that he would admit it. "Sherlock, you and Mycroft are extraordinary boys. We only hired those private teacher to grant you the best possible education, it had nothing to do with you not being able to make friends. You're a lovely boy. Stubborn, arrogant, but under your aloof mask, you're adorable."
“I’m serious, we should go home now.” Sherlock said and blinked stupidly when John walked up behind Janine.
"Oh, stop it now, Sherlock, you won't get beaten up. Look, if it's really that bad, you can call me anytime and I'll pick you up, but that doesn't mean that you can call me only because you consider the people on the school idiots. You will either way, even if it's just because you want to prove me wrong. So you can call me if they actually harm you, but if not, you'll graduate on this school.
“Yeah, I can see that. I’d rather say witch, though… because it didn’t seem humanly possible to me to do
“You’re welcome.” John said and led Janine outside, while Sherlock quickly handed the barkeeper his credit card to cover the bill – a very large bill that he was going to have to explain to his parents somehow since his credit card bill was still going to them. He would have to change that ASAP.
, my lad.” Janine said and smiled at his innocence. “Five quid says that she’ll be asking you about our friendship with a giddy smirk on her lips, hoping to get some info on our actual relationship status. That’s how parents and kids work, Lock.”
. Of course Sherlock knew her opinion wasn't worth a straw. She was a mother. Her brain was designed to find her own children adorable and pretty even if they were too tall, too thin, weird-faced and wearing a school uniform, he'd fit in twice. Or in Mycroft's case weird-faced and fat with OCD which made him carry an umbrella everywhere he went and always – really bloody
Dropping the half smoked cigarette – the second one that was wasted – he quickly left, ignoring the still on laughter and in particular muting out a clique that found it apparently even funnier to call him names – very explicit names.
“Let’s drop her off first.” John said and Sherlock nodded, giving the driver Janine’s address as he got in, followed by John.
Sherlock wasn’t really in the mood to get to know anyone, but he played along for Janine’s sake and looked around the room and…
“Hey, I’m a little out there, but even I wouldn’t share my boyfriends,” Janine said and laughed again. “You know what I mean.”
They’d talk about school, why Sherlock had never went to an actual one, what Mr Watson had done before his career jump to teaching. He had actually meant to become a military surgeon and go to med school after a couple years in service, but his plans had fallen through when he had been shot in Afghanistan and ever since had a tremor in his left hand, which effectively stopped him from being a surgeon or going back into service. Only then he had decided to study biology and English and become a teacher instead. And Sherlock had been thoroughly impressed, just about as impressed as Mr Watson had been when he had told the man that he had actually solved a couple of murders already and how educated he was already when it came to natural sciences.
»Christ John...« he suddenly heard Sherlock's voice coming out of the dark. »Would you just... I'm not going to break...« John couldn't help but letting out a soft hummed chuckle at Sherlock's impatience, this time it was his turn not to answer though.
, he thought as he moved to his seat, though best not mention that he couldn’t have been arsed to even look at any other books.
“You’re the best friend ever, by the way, did I already tell you that?” Janine asked with a grin and instantly grabbed the menu from the table.
“Well, I’ll use the money to buy us burgers then to cheer you up after I’ve told you that you’ve lost the bet.” He said when Janine dug out her measuring tape.
“But why am I the only one getting detention now?” Anderson kept complaining and Watson turned back to him.
“Well, we’ll see about that.” Janine said confidently, standing up again, “Come on then, take that godawful jacket off so I can get to fitting the other for you.”
“Uh.. the fact that you totally kicked Mr Stamford’s arse in chemistry when you let him know he was talking bullcrap and that he had to
Slipping into the small corner, Sherlock sighed silently to himself, finding it crowded, instead of being empty as it had been during the first period. Great. That was just great. Rolling his eyes, he occupied a small spot to himself, that was as far away from everyone else as possible, leaning against the brown-ish brickwall of the gym as he pulled out his cigarettes, taking one out of the pack and lighting it up, before slipping the pack back into his pocket and taking a deep drag, relaxing into the blue smoke that left his lips as he exhaled.
Sherlock laughed again, rolling his eyes, though he did so somewhat fondly this time. “Well.. it’s not the worst theory I guess.. I know that I do prefer males for a fact, but that’s not what I meant when I said I’m not sure. I’m just not sure if I’m interested in the whole dating scheme in the first place.”
“I.. You can call me by my first name, sir. Mr Holmes sounds a little strange to me.” He explained and wondered if it was appropriate to tell a teacher to call you by your first name?
“Good morning, birthday boy!” His mother – and Janine for some reason, apparently that was the reason she hadn’t texted him yet – called in unison when he arrived downstairs.
“Just saying!” Janine replied and laughed, which made the barkeeper who had looked a little taken aback for a moment laugh as well. “Figured he might want to know, as I said before, my gaydar is on point. Am I wrong?” she asked, turning to the barkeeper.
Oh, and for all you people who dislike Irene, as far as I can tell at the moment she isn't going to play a major part in the story, although I'm making no promises on that as I don't know myself yet where the story will go. Nonetheless, two things are set in stone for me:
“Okay… I take that back, but you like Harry Potter?” Janine asked and giggled, putting her things (which she had managed to spread around the entire room somehow) back into her bag.
The heat was seeping around his body. It was in his blood. It reached up and clamped the muscles in his stomach sharply, making his rhythm stutter.
“Undoubtably.” Sherlock pushed off the wall and began to pace the small space. It was a familiar sight, natural to watch Sherlock’s body thrumming with the speed of his thought, unable to stay still any longer. It was easy to fall back into this small comfort. Then the other man’s mouth took off, pouring out his swirling thoughts with dizzying speed. Even that made John smile. “There is nothing more deceptive than obvious fact. Besides, a look of the case we’ll find some other
He had considered texting John. Gone to the brink of it so many times but he pulled back every time. He had made his decision very clear when he moved back in with Mary. After months of sleeping on Sherlock’s couch because he refused to admit he was doing anything more than just crashing for the night, John packed up all the things that had accumulated and left. Sherlock should’ve seen it coming. He even caught John practicing forgiving Mary in the bathroom mirror. But he didn’t want to see it. So he deleted all the evidence and let himself be shocked and pained when the door closed behind John for the last time.
"You work your own method, and I’ll work mine. John and I will return to London by the evening train.” He answered calmly.
He had to think of the case. The crime scene had been fruitful, providing samples of ash and sediment, even the murder weapon.
He stayed there for a long time, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.
There had been a voice in the back of his mind that night that told him he wouldn’t be able to forgive her. But Sherlock had convinced him she was worth forgiving and if there was one person John knew he could trust to be right…
“We’re interviewing Turner’s daughter tomorrow, right then. So I’ll come round in the morning.” John rushed out as he pushed past Sherlock into the aisle and off the train without looking back.
“On January 3rd, McCarthy left his house at Hatherly about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his friend in the morning in town, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an important appointment at three. From Hatherly Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he walked the distance. One was an old woman, and the other was William Crowder, an employee of the neighbor Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses say that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. Crowder said that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, following with a gun under his arm.
The train pulled into the station and John let out a long silent sigh. He’d spent the entire trip staring out the window, refusing to meet Sherlock’s eye and refusing to give into the almost painful urge to reach out and smooth the crease between the other man’s eyes with his fingertips.
He had to have known. That’s why he licked his lips, those fucking perfect lips with a pouty lower lip John just wanted to chew on, and he swallowed, that long pale expanse of throat rippling begging John to run his tongue over it, and he simply said “John.”
Sherlock picked up the drink that he had been cradling, looked like scotch, and shoved it into John’s hand.Greg felt bad for the girl. She seemed nice enough and definitely didn’t deserve Sherlock’s ususal brand of torture. None of them did really. Sure, he felt bad for her but not enough to hold back the burst of laughter that spilled out when Sherlock plopped back into his armchair and mumbled, “No one likes eggnog.”
“I love you.” He said again, more forcefully, like if he said it hard enough it will be enough. Panting, he covers his face with his hands, pushing in hard to try to keep them from shaking. All he could see was swirling blue and grey and green.
Every time Sherlock would shift restlessly in his seat, John’s eyes were drawn to him only to be snapped back to the novel when Sherlock looked up.
Sherlock’s breath hitched once as he, with his whole body, started to lean forward. The sharp sound snapped John back to reality and he careened away from Sherlock pulling his hands away in the same motion.
“You can’t get rid of us that easily, boss.” Sally smiled, tipping her glass at him. She took a swig and cringed but managed not to spit it back into her glass.
“You’d have to be an imbecile to not realize all the evidence against you. I would’ve been more suspicious if he had acted surprised or feigned indignation. His frank acceptance of the situation is a sign of his innocence.”
He looked away guiltily. The thoughts weren’t exactly new and John had always indulged himself, they were just thoughts after all. But lately, they hadn’t seemed so innocent. His mind no longer reacting to Sherlock with just casual interest. Now his body was reacting and it really couldn’t have come at a worse time.
Lestrade laughed. "We have got to the deductions and the inferences. I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without your deductions. You’re going to have to explain all of that if it’ll hold up.”
He purposely avoided the guilt that would’ve come from thinking about what happened when he got home. Instead he turned his thoughts to that morning finding that ground safer to tread.
Mary pulled back eventually with a noise that wasn’t unhappy nor unsurprised. She shifted out of the way, one hand still on the door.
He seemed to be talking to himself but every now and then he would look up at John to see if he was following along.
“Miss Turner will be at Baker Street tomorrow morning and after we speak with her we’ll return to have a word with James McCarthy and find the murderer.”
He traced his way to the farther side of this and crouched down once more almost on his face with a little cry of satisfaction.
She sprawled forward on the mattress. It was obvious and she wasn’t going to argue right then. He climbed over her, kissing the back of her neck, reaching around to touch her until she was trembling.
What had come next was the hard part. Waking up in an abandoned building in the middle of eastern Europe, joints stiff from the cold, without the smell of tea enveloping him or the domestic sounds of john putting around the flat. Chasing a criminal through a back alley without the warmth and reassurance of John’s presence beside him. Looking to his left after making a clever deduction that would’ve astounded any normal person and finding only empty space.
Clawing his way back to life wasn’t the hard part. Forcing his heart to beat after Mary had destroyed it was nothing compared to watching her in John’s arms on the dance floor at his wedding. The hard part had been having John back for a few glorious months, only to have him slip away again, so determined in his damn moral principle to forgive her. But worst of all was standing with John on the tarmac, knowing he would never see him again. With only a handshake to say goodbye.
Sherlock glanced around for his phone at the small chirp that pierced the silence. He had been waiting for Lestrade’s response for nearly six hours after the DI sent him a rather lengthy and disgruntled message listing all the reasons one shouldn’t text someone at four in the morning looking for a case.
Lestrade shot Sherlock a glare and ushered John inside. “Um, Thanks.” John said, taking a seat. Lestrade sat behind his desk and started shuffling through the files on his desk.
The crime scene was a two hour train-ride north, so John waited until they were settled into their seats before he asked for more details on the case.
But tonight it was different. He could see Sherlock’s outstretched hand, his own aching to reach it. He heard the other man’s trembling voice through the phones cradled against his ear. But John was the one looking down on the world. He was the one teetering on the edge with Sherlock begging him to stay.
They hadn’t been together since she shot Sherlock, not for her lack of trying. And her hormones were driving her crazy almost constantly.
He won’t have to clear away a chemistry set from every available surface in the kitchen and that won’t make him homesick. And when he opens the fridge, he definitely will
Sherlock’s bow dangled from his fingertips over the edge of his chair. He’d given up on playing hours ago. He was turning over a case in his mind. It was an interesting case that Lestrade was struggling with whether he wanted to admit it or not.
Sherlock closed his eyes and John indulged himself. He glanced over him from head to toe, his gaze resting on the pulse in Sherlock’s neck.
Cursing his own starved body, he readjusted himself in his pants and pushed out onto the sidewalk, after the cabbie was paid, hoping the cold would calm him a little. It didn’t.
Anderson and Donovan were huddled together on the couch, trying to contain their laughter. It was only a matter of time now before John corrected Sherlock. Before Sherlock had his feelings and his business dragged out in front of everyone. He deserved to be humiliated every once in a while.
“We were going to go out for dinner, but if you’re not up to it…” She let her words trail off, the question clear. His response was slow and slurred as if he was just waking up but his words made some of the tension in her shoulders dissipate. “No, not really. But I’ll make something.”
Now all eyes were firmly fixed on John. Waiting to see what he would say or do, or if he would go chasing after his girl. He didn’t.
“I haven’t read the paper for a few days.” John admitted. What he didn’t admit was that he hadn’t read the paper for months because it made him see cases in each headline and that didn’t accomplish anything but making him homesick.
It really was a great neck, one John found himself watching even when he wasn’t looking for a pulse.
Sucking in a huge breath, he came back to reality, meeting the eyes of every person gathered around in tense anticipation. It was like he was preparing to make a huge announcement and he wanted everyone’s attention. But in the end, he just twisted in his chair so he could see Sherlock at the table and said, “Bees? Really?”
“I know you well enough. You shave every morning in characteristic military neatness.You were awake far earlier than you normally are, if the dark circles under your eyes are anything to go by, and didn’t want to risk waking Mary so you shaved by sunlight. Your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side. It’s clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I can’t imagine you’d be satisfied with your work if you saw it in equal light. I see everything and it is just possible that I may be of some service in this investigation. That is why we’re here, John. Because there are two seemingly minor details that have been overlooked by Lestrade’s incompetent staff that are worth more consideration than they’ve been given.”
“We?” Lestrade managed to choke out what everyone else was thinking. Poor Molly looked hopeful for the briefest of moments. Eyes were torn between Sherlock who was trying much too hard to appear casual and John, who was stuck in his chair eyes blank like he was seeing something far off.
"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding out the stone he picked up in the woods. "The murder was done with it."
”Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
Sherlock’s knuckles had brushed against his hips unknowingly, or maybe he did know. Did he know that John would still be able to feel the ghost of that pressure? Did he know the thought of that touch brushing just under the hem of his shirt would make a sharp shiver chase down his spine?
When he closed his eyes, John could see Sherlock right in front of him, with a large warm hand on his wrist.
“Apiology is a perfectly respectable hobby.” Sherlock sniffed. His whole body shifted from that intense stillness. He was back to lazily peering through his microscope, scratching absentminded notes on the paper beside him. Though his words had a sharp edge, no one missed that faint twist of his lip. That little bit of smile he couldn’t hold back.
That hand was on his waist on his wedding day. In his hand at Sherlock’s bedside. On his arm as Sherlock’s plane turned around.
“So Lestrade’s been kind enough to let us see the crime scene and interview the witnesses.” Sherlock plowed on, ignoring John’s questions.
She shoved at his coat and he pulled at her shirt and they had to break apart for a second, panting, to discard them.
Lestrade made some calls, grumbling under his breath the whole time, making arrangements for john and Sherlock to see the crime scene. John listened absently for a few minutes and turned to talk to Sherlock but he had gone. he suppressed his sigh and his disappointment. It was Sherlock after all.
For the most part, Sherlock was his normal self. There were a few moments throughout the day, though, when John would freeze and think 'Maybe…' without daring to finish the thought.
Sherlock snorted and earned several narrow-eyed glares and one quick smile from john that earned him a dirty look from his date.
"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder lost sight of them. Patience Moran, the daughter of one of the employees of the estate, was in the woods picking flowers. She said that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy using very strong language to his son, and she saw James nearly hit him. She was scared and ran away and told her mother when she got home that she had left the two McCarthys arguing near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the woods, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was anxious, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were stained with fresh blood. They found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested.”
In John’s absence, the flat was missing something vital. Something like light, or warmth. Or Oxygen.
It wasn’t his ego that made him dream it up. It was just that he knew how it felt to watch his world spinning out toward the pavement and he was holding onto the tiny spark of hope he’d seen earlier that day on the case that maybe, just maybe, John was as important to Sherlock as Sherlock was to him.
“And the son’s boots!” Sherlock called loudly up the stairs after her. There were some murmurs behind his back that he pretended not to hear. He knew John had heard by the way his back went ramrod straight and his fists clenched at his sides.
“We’ll interview him tomorrow.” Sherlock assured. He settled into his seat, hands steepled under his chin and John knew the conversation was over.
There was a lull in the conversation where everyone just settled into the comfortable silence, listening to the soft holiday music. Greg watched John sniff at the drink, but he didn’t even bother to try it so when his date burst suddenly, “How does everyone like the eggnog? I made it myself.” He had to choke back his laughter. There was a tense silence where eyes met and glanced away before they finally decided it was John’s responsibility to break it to her.
“Sherlock, let’s talk about this, please?” His mother called from outside, making him sigh in defeat.
The darkness began to spin around John and the room heated up in a matter of seconds when Sherlock moved his mouth down John's loin, stroking him softly with his tongue, little movements which could only be described as tasting, before he started to suck gently.
It was probably still locked as it was still roughly half an hour until class would start. But on the bright side, he would 100% be on time. Including that ten minutes earlier he had set for himself.
“Can you not?” Sherlock asked and chuckled again as he sat down, putting their glasses on the table. “I just don’t like his attitude, okay?”
It wasn’t until Sherlock had arrived at the biology lab, that he looked back at his lesson plan and realised – this had to be a joke – that his teacher here too was Mr Watson. Undeniably handsome, but also a bit of a cock, Mr Watson. Great. Just bloody awesome. Because his day wasn’t already bad enough. Realising that he still hadn’t changed a thing about his appearance, Sherlock was already mentally preparing himself for another public humiliation. His classmates were probably already getting used to it anyway with the scene in English and that fiasco in the break.
brilliant) idea to send her children to a school to make friends, instead of being taught by private teachers. What mummy didn't understand though, was that Sherlock was perfectly happy without
“Mr Watson!” The girl said and chuckled quietly, “Totally knew he was going to give Anderson shit. I’m Janine, by the way.”
“This is so embarrassing…” Janine murmured a few minutes later, still holding her head over the toilet, while Sherlock held her hair up as best as he could with one hand, while having his other around her waist to steady her and make sure she wasn’t falling into the toilet.
“So you should be over there flirting with him, not walk off like a weirdo.” She said and nudged Sherlock’s side, almost causing him to spill their drinks.
“I’m not spying on you, if that’s what you’re suggesting, I only wanted to check who’s outside.” His mother said and grinned widely at the sight of Janine. “And you brought a friend!” she went on excitedly.
“Well, for a start, I said suspicion, I wasn’t sure. But that mostly didn’t have anything to do with your sexuality anyway, love. You’re a teenage boy in the midst of puberty with his hormones bottled up due to the fact that there were no people your age in your close proximity you could target said hormones on. I didn’t think if you actually
“Fair point.” Sherlock admitted and rolled his eyes. “And you know.. I almost have..” he said and slipped into his uniform jacket, holding out his arms to show her that the sleeves ended a good bit above his wrists.
dinner, but Sherlock had convinced her that a regular breakfast was already quite much to take for his stomach.
Today would be his first day on an actual public school. Lucky Mycroft who had already graduated before mummy had the brilliant (absolutely
It was about an hour later when they walked up to Sherlock’s house, which left Janine gaping at the sight of it.
“Thank god..” Janine murmured and leaned into Sherlock, “I think you’re right.. we should go home.” She said and Sherlock nodded, leading her out of the bathroom, where John was already waiting for them.
“Phew.. Thanks Mr Watson.. always knew you’re a catch..” she said and Sherlock bit back a giggle. He really did need to send John a text about pretending he didn’t remember anything about tonight to save her dignity.
“Sounds good.” The man said, handing Janine over to Sherlock who made sure (as much as he could right now) that she wasn’t going to fall over on the way to the ladies’ bathroom.
“This is why you’ve been avoiding me, hasn’t it? Because you’re seeing someone else? You’re,” Sherlock struggled to even form the word. It felt out of place as he tried to form it in his mouth, as he tried to think about it in relation to John.
John found himself breathing heavily, like he’d just been in pursuit of Argentinian arms dealer who had somehow manage to scale a six story building, free climbing. Of course Sherlock was upset about the existence of the Peacemaker. Of course Sherlock had thought that The Peacemaker was competition. John couldn't help but roll his eyes. Some things never changed. God, if only Sherlock knew. John could imagine coming out from behind the wall right then and announcing that he was not only alive but the legendary Peacemaker and Sherlock would be more mad at him for his vigilante efforts than he was about lying about his death or working with Moriarty. It was a comforting thought, although John feared that unfortunately he'd burned far more bridges than that with Sherlock.
“Oi, hold on. The medical journal that the study was published in agreed to give us a list of their subscribers, to run the names through our system to see if anyone has any criminal background. We also did a search of them just to check and see if any of them have the kind of level of notoriety that might draw Moriarty’s attention.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure if the last sentence was supposed to be reassuring, but it was hissed with so much determination that for a second Sherlock believed him. But then Sherlock remembered that their entire relationship was a lie. They were just fucking, weren’t they? John had been using him. How had Sherlock gotten it so wrong? How had he gotten everything so wrong?
John stared at the other man with a look of horror and confusion. He didn’t have any idea where the other man was going with this, but wherever it was, it couldn’t be good.
“Once the wreck has settled, divers will be better able to search it. There were no indicators of anyone in distress while the ship was sinking, and it’s too dangerous to send a diver into a sinking ship.” he heard Mycroft murmur, but for perhaps the first time in his life, Sherlock’s brain seemed to have shut down completely. He couldn’t bring himself to do or say anything. His mind felt like static.
“John, John.” John was roused from sleep by Mary shaking his shoulder. He felt his heart pounding and for a second he thought that Mary was waking him from a nightmare. He'd been having them pretty often recently, but thankfully they weren't the screaming bloody murder kind. He couldn't remember dreaming much of anything though tonight.
From that point on, it became hard. It wasn’t him getting high off of waves of adrenaline as he whispered threats while beating the crap out of the criminals of London before going back to the flat with Mary to have a couple beers and tease each other about any minor missteps they had made. No this was work. It was like war. Worse than war. At least in war he had an entire army behind him.
“No Sherlock. This isn’t something I can negotiate on right now. If we had any sort of real case on him than maybe I could file you as a specialist and let you talk to him on the record, but right now we’ve only got him on trespassing, which will likely not hold very long since as much as Phillip Rogers may like to lock up someone from a rival gang, it is highly unlikely he’ll step forwards to press those charges since there are several warrants out for his own arrest. Trevor’s confession is basically useless as far as prosecution goes. It’s not technically illegal to be a gang member.”
“Yes, alright, your metaphors mean little to me and are not getting me any closer to bringing down Moriarty,” Sherlock said, trying to peer past Lestrade into the building.
Sherlock couldn’t believe it. John. Loyal, kind, stubborn, proud John, committing adultery. His John, betraying him. But it fit then, didn’t it? The text messages, the avoidance, the hesitation. All this time he’d been trying to protect John from Moriarty, when John probably was only feeling guilty for betraying his other partner.
But somehow some unassuming hacker with a slightly rough background had managed to discharge his illegal firearm into said assassins head. Because that was definitely something that could happen coincidentally.
But Sherlock, rather annoyingly for the self-proclaimed master deductionist, didn’t seem to understand John’s queue to change the tone, or was ignoring it. But the implications of that latter possibility were even more horrifying.
“He said that Trevor’s been released, because there were no charges against him. And in fact Phil Rogers turned himself in and is currently being prosecuted.”
“Don’t you think I know that?” Sherlock said softly. What was Moriarty’s game this time? What was the point of a game if he couldn’t figure out how to play?
“No. I don’t like where you’re going John. We’re not killing anyone, more specifically, you aren’t killing anyone.”
He rounded a corner to face and alleyway just in time to see a man standing over another mans crumpled body. Before Sherlock could think he found himself crying out. Later, Sherlock would kick himself for not remaining quiet, not taking more time to observe the crime scene, not taking a moment to text Lestrade to report the homicide. But in that moment he would only notice the way the man froze at the sound of his voice and then without even a glance backwards, would take off running down the opposite end of the alley.
“John,” Sherlock breathed his name, his voice coarse. “Your suspect is John.” He looked up at Lestrade, hoping for any chance that the DI’s face would not confirm it, but there was nothing there except for sadness.
“Well, I mean it’s not, technically, I suppose. If he confessed to a specific crime, or any series of documented crimes that he may have committed as part of gang involvement, then that’s one thing. But that’s the point, we arrest people for committing crimes, not for claiming to be a type of person who historically commit crimes. And the only reason I could imagine him admitting anything is if there is something that he’s been involved with recently that he feels is highly likely to get him caught, then he might vie to make a deal or something in exchange for information. But again, that’s a theoretical scenario, and we’re working with what we actually know, not things that could possibly be the case.”
“Oh, darling,” John cringed at the endearment. Moriarty caught John’s discomforted expression and smiled brightly at him. He got up from his chair and made his way around the table and over to John. “You didn’t think when I said all of that stuff about tearing you down and climbing atop the pieces I meant physically?” Moriarty asked, contradicting his words as he straddled himself over John, sitting down atop his lap. His fingers went to John’s jaw, stroking over his beard. John flinched away from the touch, but immediately gasped at the resulting sharp pain in his chest, and stilled himself despite Moriarty's ministrations.
“Oh, really?” Victor seemed to hesitate, as if thinking something over. “Found someone mad enough to put up with you?”
“Oh, John, I’m so sorry,” he heard her whisper before the weight on top of his hand disappeared and a few moments later he heard the sound of a door opening and closing.
Then he heard a noise from somewhere in the back of the flat. Sherlock bolted in that direction, shoving past an officer who had just been rounding the corner, his weapon held high in front of him, still trying in vain to make sure the flat was clear.
He had been wrong about the jumper. It wasn’t the last thing John had. John had the memories of his time with Sherlock. He had made those memories when he had no right to, having already agreed to betray Sherlock. But they were his anyway. He had those few moments where Moriarty hadn’t managed to wedge himself in between them by causing John to get lost in the guilt or Sherlock to become too controlling and protective. And just because they’d been taking things slow, did not negate their relationship. They weren’t married and it wasn’t the 18
He claimed that he was involved with an opposing gang. He claimed that he was searching for something that had been stolen. Some sort of trinket, Sherlock didn’t even bother to remember what it was, he’d deleted it instantly as it seemed so irrelevant. It was nothing actually worth money but that was instead worth pride. He was also quick to point out that Sherlock’s intel was complete garbage and ‘The Torture Chamber’ was ironic more than it was truly sadistic. In fact it was the personal residence of a leader in the gang and the place where he was known for taking women back to to have sex. Lots of women. Lots of sex.
“When you asked for my help, I was mentally preparing to become an assassin, not be digging through records to construct tips to turn into HMRC,” John sputtered. He had spent the past two weeks being briefed on Adler and all of the previous successes that Victor and Mary had already achieved, all while not actually mentioning how they’d been doing it.
“That’s really only a last resort John. We are trying not to become criminals ourselves any more than necessary,” Mary explained.
He eventually found Mornington Crescent and got himself on a train on the Northern line going south. He needed to be in Canary Wharf, probably an hour ago. The messages he'd received had actually been sent right after he'd turned off his phone. The train seemed to take ages, and John grew increasingly antsy. He wasn’t supposed to be needed until tomorrow night. Nothing good could possibly come out of the fact that he was being summoned spontaneously.
“So, we leave Victor, he’ll be fine,” John said, sounding resigned. “But we still need to deal with the gang.”
“John, can I use your phone?” Sherlock looked over at John suddenly, who had gone back to observing his shoes.
“Ah, yes. Lovely seeing you again,” Sherlock muttered shoving his hands in his pockets defensively. They ran across something fine and jagged. A business card. John had printed a bunch up a while ago and had taken to sticking them in Sherlock’s pockets when he thought Sherlock wouldn’t notice him lingering by the coat stand. Sherlock himself of course never gave anyone a business card, but he kept them stored in his pocket because even before their official dalliance began, Sherlock had to admit he had gotten off a bit on the feeling to John’s fingers brushing across his hips through the lining of his jacket whenever John would reach into his pockets to extract a card to give to a potential client.
“But surely if Phil Rogers has warrants out for his arrest, there must at least be one out for Victor?” Sherlock asked. There had to be something about Victor that he was missing. Everything wasn’t making sense anymore. Huxley was nowhere to be found and the reason for his disappearance at all was a mystery. His homeless network had failed him. And now someone he used to know had shown up claiming a career choice that did not at all become an Oxford graduate from a wealthy family. It just didn’t fit. Surely even someone as dull as Lestrade had to see that.
“John, I’m not proposing to you. I realize that statistically plenty of sexual relationships end, and sometimes badly. But we can’t continue any other way, can we? I’ve explored every other option, considered all the possibilities. This is the best one for us, I think.”
Sherlock sprinted, not caring about the people he was bumping into, until he was parallel to the boat from the bank of the river. He held himself against the railing and caught his breath, trying to figure out how to get out to the boat. Festival Pier was just on the other side of the Golden Jubilee bridges, maybe he could commandeer a boat there to take out to the yacht.
John felt sick for the first time in months. That’s what it had been since he had last seen Sherlock. He’d spent the past three months tearing down anyone who happened to have been so much as glanced at by Moriarty. He could deal with Mary’s jokes about what Sherlock and him had before, but he still couldn’t stomach the idea of an after. After all, there wouldn’t be one.
The next day Mycroft came to Sherlock’s flat to find him sitting across from a plain looking middle aged woman. She was sniffing. Sherlock was handing her a tissue.
“We don’t know anything for sure, except apparently that John’s bollocks medical journals come in handy after all. Is everything I think I know a lie?” Sherlock groaned, turning away from the body to begin pacing, running his hands through his hair, closing his fists around the dark curls and tugging in agitation.
John had had a lot of not good in his life. But Sherlock had been something good. And even if it was over now, that didn’t negate it.
“Vic,” John muttered, trying to look around him. His head flopped to the side and saw Mary leaning over a body, fingers checking for a pulse. Whose body was it again? John couldn’t remember. What was going on? Everything seemed too heavy, his vision seemed to be fading. He looked back up to the man kneeling over him.
"Shh, Sherlock. Calm down. This was days ago, back at the warehouse. He shot himself to protect us. He was trying to make it look like he'd shot me. He's doing fine, mentally."
He made sure any old experiments we're stashed in any odd places. Made sure there was nothing on the floor that John might trip over. He even dusted, swept, and vacuumed
“You have the most to risk,” Mary replied calmly. She paused for a moment, seeming conflicted over how to explain herself. “If things fall apart, if we get caught in the field, arrested for murder or assault or anything else for that matter, and our man can’t get us off without compromising our work, which is likely, it hardly matters for either of us. But if that happened to you, Moriarty would know you’re alive. Sherlock would know you’re alive. What you had been doing would be unearthed and all the work that we’ve done will likely become meaningless with a few simple recalculations on Moriarty’s part. This only works if Moriarty doesn’t realize his web has been disassembled until he makes his big move and realizes at the last minute that there is no one left to help him. If he finds out before that moment though, then I imagine he’ll be able to make all our work meaningless with a few phone calls.”
Something seemed off. This flat didn’t seem like a torture chamber. He’d imagined soundproofing would be in order, or there would be better taken care of weapons and other instruments of torture around. Instead it looked like the flat of an untidy alcoholic.
been shagging. But apparently he’d been too late. John had committed himself to someone else and couldn’t even bring himself to tell Sherlock.
“But gangs don’t just decide one night to cease existing. That’s very much how it doesn’t work,” Sherlock said.
“You cut off their faces, John.” Moriarty’s voice was rough, coming from deep within his throat. The blade stopped dancing along John’s jaw then, and cut deep into the skin at the corner of his ear. John screwed his eyes shut and held his breath while Moriarty cut along John’s jaw, stopping at the corner of his chin.
“Honestly though John, with the beard and the sunglasses and the new lithe figure of yours you look like you could have been pulled out of some high budget American thriller movie if it weren’t for the fact that you’re so vertically challenged,” Mary laughed, reaching over to him and swiping her hand over the top of his head for effect.
He pulled frantically against the chains that kept him tethered to the ceiling of the boat. He yanked and yanked and then yanked once more and whooshed forwards, the chains, while still bound to his wrists no longer holding him back having come detached from the ceiling.
“John, I don’t know what’s going on, but I think you would like to see this. It’s kind of spectacular. In a horrific way, but from a medical standpoint, I’ve been told anyway, that it’s phenomenal work that has been done to these bodies,” Lestrade said and John glared at the other man, probably regretting that strange character trait of his that allowed people to like him and bother consider his interests, Sherlock imagined.
Sherlock heard his brother’s words and found himself nodding slowly. Then he stood up and turned to look down at his brother and Lestrade.
Then, however, John realized that water was pooling at his ankles, and that the boat was going down.
But he of course didn’t feel like he owned the world. He felt tired. But he couldn’t bear to lie around the flat, so instead he was wandering the streets of London rather aimlessly.
things. But ugh, how boring is that? But we could rule the world couldn’t we, forever, no matter what.”
“Are you forgetting something, Sherlock? A key part of who the doctor was in your deductions yesterday? I don’t think you were wrong about that part, about why the doctor was doing what he did?”
The sun set and it got darker. Occasionally a river bus passed until it got too late, then only the occasional chortling hen do or group of drunken teenagers stumbled past. By 2 am the river and the land surrounding it had grown completely still and silent except for an occasional night bus or solitary car or the sound of a group of drunks singing in the distance. But still Sherlock sat.
And with that he turned around and began walking back down the hall. Sherlock waited a moment, feeling a bit dumbstruck, but once his brother disappeared from sight, Sherlock found himself walking slowly in the same direction.
?” John stood up and began to pace as Sherlock was. “You do realize that, don’t you? You don’t have friends,
John flew out of bed instantly and went out to the living room and began to pace, waiting for Mary to elaborate. But he knew what that word meant. And it wasn’t that Victor had wrecked a car.
They sped across London, Sherlock plying the cabbie into making increasingly daring choices in an effort to tail the other zippy little car with an endless stream of twenty pound notes carelessly shoved through the plastic screen that separated the driver from the back of the cab. The cabbie was hesitant but continued to oblige Sherlock’s demands as the bills continued to pile up. They drove east across London and Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat as he realized that they were headed in the direction of the West India Docks. It had been Canary Wharf where he’d gone looking for John all that time ago now, after all. And now Moriarty was leading Sherlock back through Tower Hamlets. They drove into an area that was populated by what appeared to be old factories. Usually these kinds of buildings now a day were remodeled into flats, but this string of buildings for whatever reason was eerily abandoned.
Sherlock and Lestrade had their tea and coffee, respectively. They didn’t talk much, both of them set their mobiles on the table and tried hard to pretend that they weren’t waiting and hoping for a ring, a beep, a vibration, a flash or anything to indicate news, preferably good news. But nothing happened, and after an hour, Lestrade left to get check on things back at the Yard and Sherlock went back to pacing the river, hoping that something would come to him or that he would see something. He walked for hours, hardly even paying attention to his surroundings anymore, instead just following the river.
far.” She said and snickered as well as she looked him over. “Hang on..” she added after a moment of looking at him, “That’s not your school uniform, is it?”
“Don’t be such a spoilsport, it’s going to be fun.” She said and was genuinely excited, so much so that it was a little contagious and Sherlock started to become somewhat giddy as well, despite still feeling the urge to open a window and turning the music down a notch. “So what do you want to drink?“
“I guess not..” Sherlock said and thought again of Mr Watson. “The teachers aren’t all horrendously stupid.”
Sherlock grinned and laid back down onto the sofa as the memories of the last night rushed through his mind once more – he'd barely been able to think of anything else since he awoke with John in his arms. He still couldn't believe what happened. He didn't regret it, not in the slightest. He had wanted to do that since he realised, how much John meant to him. That he was – in love – with him.
Mary said it didn’t have anything to do with the hair and the muscles, but the way that John carried himself. Before he was unassuming, and purposefully so. Only flashes of John’s true nature would be seen, and then quickly covered by meek shrugs and oatmeal jumpers. But now, John held himself like he “dared the world to contest that he owned it, and would take absolutely no shit,” Mary had explained eloquently and annoyingly. He didn't even know if he owned a jumper, having traded them in for t-shirts, button down shirts, fitted jackets, and anything else that might make him look like he knew what the fuck he was doing and perhaps like he did in fact, "own the world."
Sherlock stopped pacing and looked over at John. John stood across the body from him and was staring very intensely at his shoes and looked frustrated and uncomfortable.
“No, get out of here. He’s honestly right behind you, about five meters,” John’s stomach dropped as he watched Victor’s eyes move over his shoulder to look at something, someone in the not so far distance. The man grabbed his hand and pulled John close into a friendly embrace,giving him a rough pat on the back. "Just because you're back in London and the world is quaking at your feet, don't let your guard down," Victor whispered quickly, before he drew back and dropped John's hand.
“What time is it?” Sherlock asked, ignoring Lestrade’s rage, rolling over on the bench and still remaining curled up and lying down.
But John wasn’t the same person he was back then. That John’s eyes twinkled at the mention of danger. That John would follow Sherlock to the ends of the earth and couldn’t live without him. That John wanted to be consumed by the Sherlock bubble, that infamous space that John had spent the past year avoiding. Victor had been lucky enough to get sucked back into it when a part of John still wished somehow it had been him instead.
“Long time no see, Sherlock,” Moriarty said casually. He didn't move from his spot against the boxes. Didn't come closer to Sherlock, didn't make any gestures. He just stood there like a statue.
“The message from Moriarty on the sign!” Sherlock yelled in exasperation, turning his back on Lestrade as he continued to search on his mobile.
“He hasn’t figured it out yet, but he’s going to, you know. I bet it’ll only take him all of about 24 hours,” Moriarty paced leisurely back and forth in front of John. John followed his feet, refusing to raise his head and risk meeting the madman’s gaze.
John had made his way to the boat. It was a narrowboat that had at one point been converted into a houseboat, but the charming wooden boat seemed to have been beaten down by the metallic industry of Canary Wharf. Chipped paint and splintering wood, stuffed into a small corner of dock space in the shadow or a luxury apartment complex, the boat looked ready to capsize at any moment. It's windows had been blacked out with paper, making the boat all the more ominous.
“We’ve both been recast, haven’t we? Left to hide out backstage while the principle actors take the stage. To think we'd thought of him as nothing more than an understudy.”
John wasn't going to come around in the middle of the night, and Sherlock had to get out of the god forsaken flat.
Moriarty stuffed the phone into his pocket and exchanged it for something else that he grabbed out of the back of his trousers. The familiar weight and metallic chill of a handgun pressed against his lap. Moriarty leaned close to him, lips to his ear.
“Then John is a far better man than I am,” Victor responded, sounding strangely reverent. Sherlock catalogued that detail for later analysis, but otherwise thought little of it, considering that the conservatory of his mind palace was overrun with hundreds of bits of information for later analysis. He really should make a new room especially for them.
"Sherlock, I'll work as fast as I can," Mycroft began, gesturing to the bright screen of his mobile for effect, but Sherlock had already stopped listening, and was opening the door of the car and flinging himself through traffic to get to the side of the bridge. He took off down the side walk, trying to figure out how to get closer to boat as soon as possible, shoving through crowds of tourists trying to take their picture in front of the Eye.
Sherlock said nothing. Victor walked over to take a seat on the couch, making sure to leave John's chair empty.
“Victor, dear, there is someone here to see you. She seems quite desperate,” Mrs. Hudson announced, sticking her head through the door of Sherlock’s flat.
And then they were kissing again, and John carefully guided Sherlock backwards towards Sherlock’s room, trying to keep their mouths locked together while also avoiding tripping over the carpet, or chair, or random pile of books, or anything else that could lead John to spending the afternoon with Sherlock at A&E with a concussion instead of in his bed.
But then something wasn’t right. DMJS down 12.11. DMJS wasn’t the abbreviation for any company he’d ever heard of. He of course didn’t know extensive amounts about stocks, not being information he counted as important, but the case with Sebastian Wilkes several months ago, The Blind Banker as John had referred to it on his blog, had left him unfortunately familiar with the kinds of things that read across these boards, and DMJS was not one of them.
So Sherlock was now curled up on the sofa, facing away from the rest of the room, clenching his aching stomach and brooding horribly. John sat across the room, probably reading about the advancements of antimalarials or something else that was obviously completely irrelevant to everything.
“Victor? An addict?” Sherlock scoffed “Victor’s the reason I managed to graduate. I wanted to drop out and live in the gutter for all it mattered to me by my second year, rather than having to be in that... tedious place another second. He’s not an addict. He doesn’t look like an addict, anyway. Looks healthy, is unnaturally calm considering the fact that he’s been arrested, and he's not going out of his mind needing a hit, and no track marks,” Sherlock listed his observations, the only ones he’s managed to get from his old friend.
“I want to get you back to looking like your old self. John Watson was always a pretty impressive man wasn’t he? All this Peacemaker garbage isn’t some alter ego you developed, is it? No, that man has always lived inside you, didn’t he? But you hid him. Hid him because you doubted yourself, was afraid of your own power. And then Sherlock helped you get over those doubts, didn’t he? But you still had to restrain yourself around him. You were too afraid of scaring Sherlock off, was that what you told yourself?” John did not acknowledge Moriarty’s line of questioning and instead took slow, shallow breaths through his nose. “But what you were really afraid of was that you would outshine him, wasn't it? You were worried that if Sherlock knew all that you are, he wouldn't want you anymore. You were afraid that everyone would think you’re too crazy, right? Everyone always worries that if they’re themselves, their true selves, that everyone else will think they’re crazy. What would the world be like, though, if everyone stopped worrying about being crazy? You stopped worrying and brought the world to its knees.”
. Which made sense, because he’d been at work all morning. Which was something that Sherlock already knew.
In a neighborhood that had previously been occupied, coincidently, by the very gang that Roger’s led that had more or less completely disappeared from. In fact, there was more or less no major organized crime going on in the city right now. Maybe Roger’s gang had found new leadership and was making a comeback, or maybe it was merely a boring domestic disturbance. But as Sherlock ran hope bloomed within him that maybe, just maybe something interesting was going on.
can fix it? I’ve been running around London threatening and assaulting mostly petty criminals into either turning themselves in or going into hiding. Half of them weren't even Moriarty's, and certainly not his caliber, just trying to make a point. None of them had the resources to check and see if I was anything but talk, which is all I am by the way. But arms dealers, foreign mafias, civilian militias, they’ll know that I’m an illusion. All bark and no bite.”
John fired his gun, quickly tilting the barrel so that instead of firing into Victors head it fired backwards into John’s forearm. He tried to ignore the instant searing feeling that consumed his flesh, but the involuntary breath he took to try and regulate the pain reminded him that he didn't really have the ability to breathe. Before he could think a second more, he slammed the side of his gun into Victor’s head hard enough to leave a wound that would bleed enough if from a distance would look like a bullet wound and Victor collapsed to the floor.
And then, suddenly after the moment of delay as the information washed over him the connections clicked in his mind.
“What about Molly? Molly’s nice. And she likes you. I saw her name in that report, she ran that blood sample for you despite the fact that it isn’t really her job, you know. Ask her to dinner as thanks. I’m sure she’ll say yes.”
He lifted his head and gasped, panicked and trying to calm himself. He blinked the tears out of his eyes and looked upwards to find himself staring at the mantle. A stack of books, a figurine that he had long deleted the origin of, a dagger stabbed into the wood. His skull.
Sherlock imagined John's body, pale and marred with wounds from torture, floating somewhere lost in the murky water of the Thames. He imagined John strung up and screaming while he was repeatedly assaulted. He imagined John hanging there, bleeding and defeated.
“You’re a piece of work, you know that? Moriarty doesn’t exactly go around asking for consent before taking what he wants from people. You’d never have been able to say no.”
“I just don’t understand who you are. And what we’re supposed to do about Moriarty if he doesn’t want to be found right now,” John said finally.
No, it had to be Moriarty. If someone wanted a victim not to be identified, you could hide the body. If you wanted to disfigure it you could use acid or burn it. But this, this was mocking Sherlock.
Sherlock had returned to Baker Street and spent all afternoon and evening after leaving the crime scene yesterday trying to just get a moment of clarity to understand, but there seemed to be some sort of barrier he couldn’t get past. There was something he was missing, some connection that he hadn’t made. It didn’t help that it appeared that the Yard hadn’t even been able to come up with a single suspect.
“Sherlock?” Lestrade’s voice came, sounding unsure. He had apparently noticed Sherlock’s change in demeanor. “You alright, mate?”
” Sherlock had snapped at him from the door, a towel wrapped around his waist fresh out of the shower. It was the first time he’d heard Sherlock speak in days. He hadn’t answered the question, instead said something mildly nagging. Sherlock had nodded, and then went back to ignoring him. Mycroft felt defeated.
He had known of course that he was closer to Sherlock than he’d been in a long time, but he thought he was talking in terms of at least a few miles. Not a few meters.
That was the question that Sherlock’s mind had kept coming back to all night. But an answer never presented itself to him and he really didn’t want to think about it. It didn’t matter who it was. It could have been anyone. John was likable, he could have met someone at any time, at the shop, or maybe a patient at work. Maybe he'd just accidentally bumped into someone on the street and said something charming and let it slip that he was both a doctor
"It would do no one any good for you to find him right now. He's not the same as he was the last time you saw him all those months ago. And he's a bit indisposed at the moment."
The silence was broken by the buzzing of John’s mobile. John looked at the message and his face paled. Sherlock watched in confusion.
“Then why the fuck aren’t you already there rescuing him?” Victor hissed, a desperation and frustration licking at his voice that Sherlock had never heard from the other man.
It was what he assumed was a CCTV feed, showing a black car pulling up to the curb in a part of town John couldn’t identify, but imagined was wherever he was right now. The car came to a stop, and a man and a woman stepped out. Victor and Mary. John wondered if he should give up on breathing all together as once again it felt like the air was sucked out of him.
He was in a part of town that referring to as a “bad part of town” would be too generous. It was a neighborhood he hadn’t visited in several years, but it still looked exactly the same. And he was banking on that fact. He’d done some research, and there was nothing to indicate that this particular, well, crack den had been experienced a police bust that would lead to a change in location.
“This case isn’t specifically pathological,” Lestrade said. “If you’re going to class its anomaly, it’s more surgical than anything else.” Sherlock looked thrilled at Lestrade’s elaboration, while John scowled.
“Shhhh, Johnny,” came a calm whisper. A hand pressed gently against his chest while another cupped the back of his neck. “Look at me, darling, look at me.” John did, looking into Moriarty’s brown eyes. He was horrified to find that the world seemed to still for a minute, giving John a chance to regulate his breathing and come back to the present.
His head ached something awful and he let out a groan. He tried to sit up straighter as he looked around the room. His movements were clumsy, and his body felt like jello.
That out of the way, Sherlock sat back down and returned to his mind palace. Over two weeks after the wreck and he had grown tired of not feeling like he was capable of doing anything. Catatonia was boring. Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, all coming in and out of his flat at any given moment, clearly hoping to see that he’d managed to move himself from John’s chair, trying to get him to eat something, move to his bed to sleep properly, go outside, or at the very least relieve himself.
“Of course John’s fine, more than fine, but I need a name, Sarah!” Sherlock was growing impatient. He didn’t want to hear about how happy John was, and certainly not with a man that wasn't him.
“Do you worst,” John growled, realizing the man seemed to have a tool belt full of what would surely end up being torture devices strapped to his waist.
Celebrity gossip was at least as useless as John’s medical journals anyway. What did cosmetic advances in skin grafts or new treatments for toenail fungus matter? While occasionally John’s journals reported medical breakthroughs that even Sherlock had to admit might actually matter, usually they were mind numbingly boring.
he saw was not someone he had ever anticipated seeing again at all. He froze to match the person who he was staring at, who seemed paralyzed as well.
Something wet hit John’s back. At first John was confused, but then the agony began as acid burned into the skin of his back.
It wasn’t until John found himself chained to a wall in Serbia that he realized that this wasn’t going to be as easy as he for a moment had allowed himself to hope. John had spent twelve hours being tortured before Mary was able to stage a rescue. It had been the first time either of them had killed in the name of bringing down Moriarty. John had known that Mary was more determined to keep John’s hands clean of blood than her own, but when Mary made her way through the hovel of a building that John was being held in, taking out ten men with ten bullets, all shots to kill, a wave of the reality of what they were doing overcame John.
He did however have one lead, kind of anyway. He wasn't sure what this lead could well, lead to, but his old university friend, Victor Trevor, was definitely suspicious. But Trevor had disappeared after he was released and Sherlock didn’t have any way to find him. He even went as far as contacting Oxford to see if they had an address or any contact information on file for Victor Trevor just out of hope that perhaps maybe he was an active alum, despite Sherlock’s strong doubts that such would be the case. But he, like Sherlock, appeared to have more or less disowned the university the second he’d earned his degree.
“Oh, but you do, Johnny. I know you’ve been letting that girl of yours rack up the real body count, but you’ve got one of your own on your little world tour.”
“I’ve got it!” Sherlock declared. “Dan Morris and Jenny Stevens drowned in a narrowboat accident November 12
“And we still try to remain as removed from our man as much as possible. We’re completely underground, there is no record of us as far as any organization is concerned, particularly the government. All intelligence is exchanged via paper files drops to areas without CCTV and are burned when we’re done with them. This right now, actually, is the most involved he’s ever been with us,” Victor explained.
The pain in his shoulder quickly became worse than that inflicted by the blow torch, and after an hour he started screaming.
He slid quietly into the building that the woman had gone into when suddenly someone grabbed him from behind. Sherlock immediately struggled, but stopped when a familiar voice spoke to him.
But then he’d finally gotten Mrs. Huxley to admit that there was a file, a flash drive, which Michael had been carrying with him everywhere on a chain around his neck. Sherlock admittedly didn’t understand what all the pieces where, but after some probing of his homeless network, he’d discovered that there was rumored to be a flat, owned by gang leader Phillip Rogers, referred to not particularly creatively, as ‘The Torture Chamber.’ It was highly likely that that’s where Michael was being held. Sherlock tried to go to the flat on his own of course, but there was not a single vantage point into the flat, with all the windows covered, and no way he could find to break in without it being obvious, and no way to know if anyone would be inside.
“Long time no see Watson,” Victor smirked and John found himself lowering his weapon after Victor released him. They stepped away from the wall. “You really shouldn’t be here. You look like shit, by the way. I mean, in kind of an overworked action star kind of way, but still shit," Victor grinned. "But I supposed I’d have fared worse if I’d spent the past year building a reputation as the most feared man in all the world.”
“Since when does the great Sherlock Holmes have hunches, none the less say please?” Victor grinned teasingly. “The man that asked me to search Phil Rogers flat has nothing to with the Peacemaker. Honestly, it’s been months Sherlock and there’s been no activity linked to the Peacemaker in London.”
“Sorry, I had to go supervise my handiwork to keep a certain consulting detective off my case,” John snapped in reply, looking at the muscular assassin and first in command for Moriarty that was Sebastian Moran. Whenever he was around Moran, he slipped into the soldier version of John Watson. The version of John Watson who could be cold and clinical, who was everything that the regular old jumper wearing John Watson was thought never to be. It was easier this way, to accept his place as a part of Moriarty’s game, instead of scampering around like a frightened rabbit trapped in a box, running into walls in panicked desperation, which is what John felt like on the inside.
“What’s that, Peacemaker? Or is it Mr. Peacemaker? Sir Peacemaker, maybe? Do you expect to be knighted for your efforts in making peace? Or do you like the ‘the’, a la The Terminator? Or would you like your other titles?”
“But you survived, and I imagine that I can’t break you anymore now than I could before, though it’s for a different reason now than before. Before it was because you were already broken and couldn’t imagine a world without Sherlock, wasn’t it? Now though, it’s entirely the other way around. You can’t imagine the world without
He was going to be held for at least a week to watch the infection, but after than he could be released if he wanted, although he'd probably need to take it easy for several weeks so as not to aggravate his injuries and give himself time to fully heal. He’d get prescription for some relatively strong pain meds and antibiotics, but then he could get back to his life, the doctor had told him.
Sherlock Holmes had not seen Victor Trevor in more than ten years, not since university. Sherlock at the time been far stricter back then with his ‘no emotional attachments to anyone’ rule than he had apparently become over the years, and had no interest in staying in touch with his one university pseudo-friend. And he assumed Victor had understood that which was why he didn’t continue to have to turn down invitations to the pub. But apparently the man had gotten himself busy with other things.
It was such a clever thing to say. Well, in fact, out of all the things that Sherlock had ever said, it was probably one of the
To say that Sherlock was frustrated would be underselling it. Not only did it turn out that Sherlock had gone through all the trouble of actually bothering to get a warrant for once only to discover that he was humiliatingly wrong, but also because Victor Trevor was lying but he couldn’t deduce the truth off him. In fact, he could hardly read the man at all.
“And what, risk Sherlock tailing him to the airport to see him meet up with his dead ex-boyfriend? No, it’s a good distraction for Sherlock. In fact, as far as Sherlock’s awareness of any of the Peacemaking business, since as you know the Yard is definitely aware of, Sherlock is determined that Vic is involved. So it’s therefore pertinent that he isn’t.”
John suddenly realized the absence of Sherlock’s lips on his body and he opened his eyes to see Sherlock staring at him. He realized that Sherlock had taken his hesitation was a withdrawal of consent. John realized that Sherlock was giving him a way out. He could reject Sherlock right now. They'd be embarrassed, but Sherlock would probably take the strategy of pretending nothing had ever happened and avoiding John for a while. Which was of course exactly what John would need in the coming weeks. But he couldn’t, not now. Not after wanting this for so long. And the raging erection that had developed somewhere along the way wasn’t helping. He was only human after all.
“This is the part that you don’t know, Sherlock. This is the part of the story that you were left out of,” Moriarty explained. “But don’t feel too bad Sherlock. I didn’t know either, not until a couple months ago.”
"So you expect me to just sit around the flat and wait, while John is potentially fighting for his life?"
What came next, and would continue for what could have been an eternity for all John knew, was what John could only describe as agony. For lack of a better word, Moriarty began to pummel him. First with fists and knives, striking repeatedly into his body as it hung. The man was fast and thorough, leaving not an inch untouched. Eventually the chains were released and John fell to the floor with a heavy thump. Moriarty began to kick until John was sure that every single rib cracked and one of his lungs was punctured. The man was quiet the whole time throughout the assault. John was quiet as well, only letting out the occasional groan when the air was knocked out of him again and again.
He hoped that by hanging around he would see someone interesting brought in. Very few of the new arrests fell into Lestrade’s division anyway, since no more interesting major crime appeared to be occurring, none the less a homicide.
He paused on the sidewalk to observe the other man that was now speaking to Trevor. He could only see the man’s back from where he was standing, but the man was well dressed in comfortable but expensive looking boots, dark but well-fitting jeans, and a leather jacket that hugged around muscular shoulders and tapered over a compact back. He had blond hair that was slightly shaggy looking but not particularly long. It appeared to be kept in a style similar to Victor’s, but a bit less extreme to suit someone who was likely closer to middle aged than Victor was.
“The collision John. We can’t do anything about it now that Sherlock’s involved. It’s too high risk. We'll have to wait until he backs off before going after them.”
It was over much too quickly and John was dropped back into reality, panting as Sherlock pulled away. Though Sherlock’s lips were no longer on his, he was still close to him, head nuzzling the crook of his neck.
“One day, he heard tales of another man, a man who was like him in his genius, but used his powers for good instead of evil,” Moriarty paused, as if contemplating something, “Good and evil are of course complicated and relative concepts, but I’m sticking with the archetypes," Moriarty said as an aside. Then he continued: “And so, thinking he had finally found an opponent worth engaging with, he began to challenge him. And this new opponent rose so wonderfully to the challenge. They fought, and it was like a dance. A splendid dance.
He had gotten John to stop reading his ridiculous medical journals in favor of every single newspaper that he could get his hands on, even the crap commuter papers that were glorified tabloids that men shouted at you to take outside of underground stations. Of course it didn’t matter to Sherlock what celebrity had died or had an affair most recently, what Prince Harry was up to now a day, or that Parliament was completely incompetent in general. But he hoped somewhere in the pages John would find something interesting.
He spent most of his last day drifting in and out of consciousness. Occasionally he’d keep himself awake for an hour or two at a time. At first he tried to think about anything but what drowning felt like.
John. John was on that boat. He just knew that John was on that boat. It made sense, more sense than anything had made in days and just enough in the sea of nothingness and confusion to make Sherlock believe it had to be true. Moriarty had had John get on a narrow boat in Canary Wharf, but then used a larger boat to move the narrow boat from the docks and down the river. John could have been on the river right across from him all night, for all Sherlock could remember, but he was in a bigger boat than Sherlock had been looking for.
“Mycroft’s position to Sherlock limits him. Just as the New Scotland Yard are limited because of Sherlock’s connection to Lestrade,” Mary answered after a moment.
He’d revisit the thought later, but right now he needed to get out of this god forsaken pub and go into his mind palace. He’d reconnect with Victor later when he had developed a new approach to extracting information from the man.
He heard Mycroft calling after him, but Sherlock just began to run, back across to the South side of the river and down towards South Bank.
His mind was racing but, he felt strangely at ease. He had found John. He just knew he had found John. Now all he had to do was get to him.
John couldn’t have stopped the wail of absolute agony and surprise that spilled out of his mouth even if he’d wanted to.
“This is hardly the first time I’ve slept some place that’s not in a bed in a property I let and this is hardly the most compromising situation you’ve ever caught me in,” Sherlock muttered dryly.
“Hello, yes, is this Sarah?” Sherlock said recognizing the voice on the other end of the line while the surgery’s generic greeting was delivered.
“Alright mate, we should do this again sometime. It was nice to catch up.” Sherlock’s brain panicked, going into overload. It had been doing that increasingly often now a day. Even one faint allusion to John, and Sherlock would feel like the world was crashing down on him. He felt like he couldn’t breathe at the weight of it all.
But much to his annoyance, Sherlock realized he felt very tired. And helpless. And a bit nauseated. But there was also a feeling in his chest. It felt like the feeling of coming home after a long trip.
"Yes, Sherlock, I do. John has been through hell these past few months. The world he's been living in is not one that you could imagine, nor one do I believe you'd have been able to handle had your places been swapped. He needs rest. He needs time to process things, and decide what his life will be like now that Moriarty is gone."
And then he realized just how profound Moriarty’s victory over him was. Even if by a miracle Sherlock forgave him, John would be useless to him. Depressed, anxious, terrified at the thought of blood and torn skin. He couldn’t be a doctor anymore, could he, even if he managed to escape on his own? No. Probably not. So now all John had was jumpers and a gun. And Moriarty had taken away the need for the gun as well. Just jumpers. That was all he had left. Although Sherlock could easily be burning them in the fireplace right now. So he had the jumper he was wearing, at least.
“I felt the same this time last year. Me tied up just like this, you thinking you owned the world. But I rebuilt,” John murmured, not bothering to look up at the other man. He kept his head hung and his eyes closed.
“Going to send Sherlock more messages? I thought you told me you were done with him?” John asked, feeling the need to break the silence as it finally becoming less relaxing and more jarring.
“This process mostly introduces a whole new dimension of rejection that usually is relatively rare in skin grafting, at least in comparison to other kinds of organ donation where the donor organ comes from another person. The research was based on the idea of extending composite skin grafts, which are usually only small surface area grafts but take other layers of tissue and cartilage. But the largest graft in the study was only a half a dozen centimeters and most their research was done with pigs, they didn’t achieve enough success to work with human subjects,” John explained. “This graft though, must have taken half a meter of skin from a donor. But I mean, since this man was probably already dead when he received the graft, rejection isn’t an issue. It’s more like some sort of skin mask that was welded onto the face after the original tissue was removed. It’s honestly more like scalping, a real bastardization of medicine, this is,” John’s voice was rough and he even sounded angry.
But Moriarty had told John he was going off grid for a while, so maybe his life wouldn’t be for naught. He’d have bought Sherlock more time, and that was what mattered.
“So tell me, doctor, where can I stab you that will hurt like hell and cause you to bleed something awful, but won’t kill you before the boat goes down? And don’t lie just to end it early. The boss will know and rethink his holiday.”
He realized then just how alone he felt without John. Of course, being alone wasn’t something unfamiliar to Sherlock. But since John, well, he’d rarely been alone unless he’d specifically wanted to be. But now after all that time with John by his side, it was strange to be alone and left him feeling empty.
“What,” John paused, trying to figure out how to phrase the question without saying more than he could. He couldn’t do this unless Sherlock had at least a little warning. “What if this doesn’t work out?”
Why was he even fighting it anyway? What did he have outside of this darkness? His body was wrecked, even if he made it out of here, wherever here was. Even if he survived, he couldn’t really, could he? Moriarty couldn’t know or else he might come after Sherlock. He’d said he was taking a holiday. That probably meant going overseas to continue to strengthen himself before coming back to crush Sherlock. But John already had sold his life to buy Sherlock a chance to live, even if it could only be for a little extra time. And now he’d dared try and reclaim it.
And then Sherlock was walking. He didn’t quite know where, but he had to look for John. He walked down to the water and made his way along it, looking for a narrow boat, texting the locations of every single one to Lestrade, hoping that he could check them out, get warrants to board them if any of them came back looking like they could possibly be connected to Moriarty.
Eventually he did find himself in a cab heading to Baker Street. When the cab pulled up to the flat he pushed a twenty pound note towards the driver and got out, not even bothering to look at the meter. It was probably enough. Probably too much, but Sherlock couldn’t remember how long he was in the cab for. The driver didn’t seem to complain though and Sherlock went inside the building and walked up the stairs and opened the door of 221B.
Which is why when a gunshot echoed, Sherlock found himself sprinting off in the direction of the sound. Never mind that he was in a rough neighborhood, and standard wisdom stated that one should run in the opposite direction of gunfire, Sherlock’s heart beat faster as adrenaline took over.
“Sebby's going to want a slightly larger canvas though to work with. I might as well help him along.” Moriarty cocked his head to the side and stuck out the tip of his tongue in concentration as he pulled Johns jumper away from his chest and ran the blade down the middle, splitting it open. He then reached up above John, cutting the sleeves, before giving a fierce tug that caused the jumper to fall on the floor.
Mycroft left after that, but returned the next day with a round-a-bout insult to John juxtaposed with a complaint about Sherlock dying of dehydration that had gotten Sherlock sitting upright in John’s chair having tea with his brother and Mrs. Hudson. The two of them talked. Sherlock said nothing.
“Yes, alright. Well, it’s at least some place to start. Even if they weren’t a part of it, they might know of someone who requested information or otherwise expressed interest,” Lestrade responded, now dialing his mobile, clearly beginning to take action.
“Who is this government official? If even Mycroft has been on Moriarty’s tail and hasn’t been able to do much to help in getting any closer to bringing him down, I can’t imagine your guy is any better.”
There was one problem, however. It wasn’t a problem with the concept of being in a relationship, as he would have once expected, but it was a problem with the relationship, which Sherlock had not anticipated. Or more specifically, there seemed to be a problem with John. Or maybe it was himself who had the problem and John was just reacting to him. He hadn’t quite figured it out yet, but something was definitely off.
He remembered how he’d walked away, trying to tell Sherlock that he didn’t understand. That he was wrong.
“No,” Mary said defiantly. “Well, I mean sort of. We figured we’d pick off enough of them, and then target their leaders, and hope that at that point they were so disorganized that they’d be useles to Moriarty.”
The look of anger and betrayal in Sherlock’s eyes had been too much. He wanted to pretend that he still was following the commands of the text messages because he needed to protect London, his family, friends, and most importantly Sherlock from Moriarty. Weeks ago though when it became clear to John that he was only delaying all of their fates, giving Moriarty time to put a far more devastating plan into action, John pretended that he was at least doing it to buy Sherlock more time as well. But as he worked for Moriarty and saw the full extent of the man’s madness and genius, he began to lose faith in Sherlock. Sherlock was one man, determined to bring Moriarty down virtually entirely on his own. Moriarty, on the other hand, had countless numbers of people at his beck and call. John was just one tiny pawn. In a way, so was Sherlock. So then, John kept showing up for the purposes of self-preservation. He began to hope that he could just maybe keep himself alive long enough to maybe find a way out.
“The skin graft that covers his face continues to the back of his head. I assume that it’s covering the exit wound. That’s probably why the head is so smooth, because the suture line where the graft ends are under the chin and jaw and probably along the back of the neck as well as tucked behind the ears,” John shrugged and Sherlock stared at him confounded.
Sherlock realized that John hadn’t been speaking hypothetically. He had known. He had known so much more than Sherlock and kept it from him, carrying the weighty knowledge all on his own, trying to keep it away from Sherlock.
He put on his shoes and grabbed his coat and made his way down the stairs. He opened the door and slammed it shut behind him, not even caring if he woke Ms. Hudson.
After a few moments of paralysis, Sherlock lurched forwards in an attempt to throw himself over the railing into the river. Arms caught him around the shoulders, holding down his forearms and clasping against his chest. Sherlock blindly fought against them, but the arms held him firm, although hot breath was panted against his neck.
John still said nothing. Sherlock was stronger than that. He didn’t need John and there would be other criminal masterminds. He wasn’t worried about what would happen to Sherlock after he was gone. Mycroft and Lestrade would look out for him, so would Molly and Ms. Hudson. Sherlock had other people that he cared about and who cared about him, even if he was hesitant to admit it. Sherlock would be just fine. He had to be.
“Well, I’m not, Johnny-boy. I still have some praises left to sing you, don’t I? I’m sorry about…that, by the way,” Moriarty gestured to John’s entire body, which probably looked a wreck. “I was just a bit, hm, overcome. That’s done now, though. What do you say, Johnny? Can we start again?”
“Yes well, we underestimated you and them and Moriarty. But since you were one of the things we underestimated, you can fix it.”
“There’s been a murder! More than one! A possible serial killer!” he exclaimed, sounding absolutely giddy.
Moriarty looked up from the phone to John, his brow momentarily furrowing, and then another Cheshire cat grin slowly spreading across his face.
On the second day, Lestrade came by to take a statement, but refused to tell Sherlock anything else about anything. He claimed he didn't know anything, but Sherlock doubted that.
“Oh, I think I’ve teased you enough,” Moran grinned devilishly before he stepped behind John and began smacking the whip repeatedly against John’s chemically burned back. John had managed to survive the first hit before he was screaming. He lost count of how many times Moran snapped the whip against his already damaged skin, but eventually he passed out.
"I hadn't meant to see you tonight," he admitted. "I couldn't stand being in the hospital anymore. I was just taking a walk, and I guess I ended up here."
John closed his eyes, still holding his breath. He knew he was going to drown, but he couldn’t bring himself to willingly take the last breath and to fill his lungs with the dirty water of the Thames. He was completely underwater now and he’d been underwater for nearly a minute or an eternity when his body started demanding oxygen and John began to instinctively thrash in a vain attempt to get to the surface.
So Sherlock did the only thing he could think to do, which was to make sure that John was never alone, never without protection. John could hold his own in a fight, Sherlock knew that of course, but clearly Moriarty’s men were good. They worked hard to make sure their presence wasn’t known and would be willing to sneak up from behind. They didn’t feel the need to show off their strength, to dominate their victim. They just did their job, and they did it well. And John didn’t stand a chance, no matter how vigilant he was.
Sherlock and John arrived at the crime scene, which was an old warehouse in Camden Town that had been for a while used as a night club, but was in the midst of a remodel to turn it into some sort of niche restaurant. The construction had stalled currently though, and the building had been left locked and vacant for weeks. A tip had been called in, alerting the police to the body, and the building had been locked and undisturbed when the police had arrived to check out the tip. Now, though, the building was surrounded in a line of police cars and tape. Sherlock and John exited the cab and met Lestrade at the door.
“The work that you’ve done is going to be quite prolific, I do hope you know. I have granted you a very exciting death Johnny. You have to admit that’s what you wanted. Why you were hesitant to end things before. Being shot, self-inflicted or otherwise is soo bor-ing,” Moriarty sang. “But this, Johnny-boy is an awfully exciting way to die, don’t you think? To be tortured and sunk to the bottom of the Thames after having fled from your guilt over having taken part in some of the most disturbing serial murders London has ever seen. That’s beyond interesting.”
“But we only knew about the cabbie and smugglers because Moriarty wanted us to. How would we possibly get to any of them before they even commit a crime at Moriarty’s orders? And where are you getting your intelligence?” John asked. God, his head ached. Well, everything ached as whatever initial blast of morphine they had given him was wearing off and he was hesitant to have more administered.
It was all too much so fast. He was supposed to be dead. Taking a nice eternal nap. Instead, he was being briefed on secret missions.
An hour later he’d gotten to Westminster. He pulled his jacket tighter around him as the evening grew cold and the sun began to hang lower in the sky, golden light reflecting across the river.
“Jesus, Sherlock, you’re going to get yourself shot!” Lestrade yelled after him when the officer stumbled into a wall and began cursing after Sherlock.
“We have 47 hours and 49 minutes still Johnny. Don’t you think we should have some fun in the mean time?”
“But you know what I want. I want redemption, for those men that you defiled. You’d agree they deserve it, don’t you? They never did anything except for their jobs. And it’s certainly not my fault that they ran out of purpose. But you
John got his eyes to focus, and he realized that Sherlock was sitting on his waist and had his arms pinned on either side of his head in order to prevent John from thrashing.
After a few more slow minutes, he finally slowly stood up. His whole body ached in protest. He carefully fingered the gun in his lap, shifting it carefully into the waistband of his trousers. Then he slowly made to turn around, but the twisting movement required of his torso was too much, and something inside him stabbed something else. He gasped and fought against collapsing, but struggled to maintain his footing. He began to fall forwards when arms wrapped around him and pulled him back to his feet.
As John began to gather his faculties, he realized that this time he was seated, tied to a chair. He did another quick scan of his body, trying to push Sherlock out of his mind.  He tested what he could move and what he couldn’t, what hurt and what didn’t. He was bruised and bloodied, and taking deep breaths caused shooting pain, as did basically any other sort of movement he quickly realized. Thankfully though, there was nothing that seemed particularly life threatening at that moment. If he was jostled around too much, the likely broken rib, or more likely ribs, could possibly puncture his lung, which if without pretty immediate medical attention could become life threatening. But as long as he stayed still, bought his time to figure out a way out, or maybe to give enough time for the non guaranteed rescue enough time to show up, he still had strong chances of making it out alive.
Victor sat up from where he had been stretched out along the sofa, and Sherlock observed the confused, worried, and slightly panicked look that crossed his face.
“I don’t understand why you’re acting this way. None of this information is new, nothing has changed.”
“I don’t know, times are changing. I think the demand for a whatever-you-are-sexual who becomes some sort of mastermind vigilante in order to protect his sexy same sex lover is through the roof right now.”
“Victor Trevor barely exists as far as anyone seems to be concerned. He seems to have bounced around employment wise over the years, working odd jobs occasionally, nothing too interesting. He was a lab technician for a while, then bounced around a couple retail jobs, and then more or less disappears about five years ago. It’s not the most ridiculous thing, Sherlock. He’s a friend of yours, and from what I know of your past and have heard from Mycroft, you picked up your, um, habits, right around university. If Trevor had similar habits, it’s not impossible that he got himself in deep chasing a hit.”
Sherlock continued to scowl, but followed Trevor down the street to the coffee shop that his friend/babysitter/new arch enemy had insisted that Sherlock try. Several months ago, after the incident with Huxley and the mugging, and Mycroft had put two and two together and hardened down his watch on Sherlock by hiring his old university friend to keep near constant tabs on him, Sherlock had tried ditching Victor. Victor, however, despite his general uselessness at pretty much everything else, was very good at finding Sherlock whenever he’d try to run off.
The fact of the matter was that he could no longer picture his life without John, and Sherlock realized that if he didn’t open up to John about how he really felt, he was going to lose him. And so not having John had suddenly come to mean Sherlock couldn’t do his work, which was completely unacceptable.
His fingers grazed something smooth. Glass. Some of the paper must have fallen off in the water. Glass meant windows. Glass meant a way out. Before he could even think about it, he pulled his arm back and slammed it through the window, shattering the old glass of the weathered boat. He thanked God that the windows of the old nearly dilapidated boat were made of thin glass rather than plastic or something else sturdier. He then threw himself through the space that was created. It wasn’t much, the window wasn’t very big and he hadn’t managed to take out the entire pane. It certainly wasn't safety glass either, and he could feel his skin being grated on the glass as he shoved his body through the opening. But then he broke the surface of the water and frantically gasped for air.
Sherlock sighed. “Why did Rogers turn himself in? And you told me that you’d found reason to hold Victor longer. You’d promised me that I would get a chance to talk to him. I’ve been waiting all week and what, now he’s just disappeared?”
“I really am sorry about all this damage I’ve done to you. I’d like to clean you up now though,” Moriarty began to speak again and the voice was grating on John’s ears. He wanted to shove the man away from him and curl into a ball with his eyes tightly shut and his hands over his ears.
Before Sherlock or anyone else could question Huxley more on The Peacemaker, some men in dark suits had shown up with a file of paper work allowing them to take Huxley away, probably to some bunker somewhere for all Sherlock knew or cared.
“Yes, of course, I’m just a person. Nothing like you. You know what, Sherlock, I think maybe I need to take a break from this, from all of this. Maybe, maybe I’ll go see if Harry’s in one of those rare clean periods and is feeling generous enough to let me crash on her couch. Or is pissed enough not to notice, doesn’t really matter. I just feel like I’m slowing you down. ”
“You two are finally shagging?” Lestrade’s completely unnecessary comment came echoing through Sherlock’s mind.
“Oh, God, John,” the wrecked words slipped from Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock looked back up at Mycroft and Lestrade then, springing into action. “How long has he been missing?”
“Yes, Sherlock, surely you know that some wealthy people feel it necessary to have areas to store their smaller boats inside of their larger boats. You went to Oxford, and you are my brother, surely these concepts do not surprise you. I don’t know what it’s doing specifically, but I’ll have someone sent out to check the permits. It is unusual to anchor a private boat in this part of the river, but who knows, films now a days seem to have no rules. It's probably an elaborate prop for some spy film.”
John lay still under the covers, with Sherlock curled into his side, feeling the other man’s breath against his neck. He felt heavy with contentedness, and allowed his eyes to fall shut. He quickly forgot about the fact that he was still wearing his jumper, that Sherlock was still wearing his trousers, that he was caked in sweat and desperately in need of a shower, and the fact that it was likely about dinner time and he shouldn’t let Sherlock get away with skipping yet another meal. Instead John drifted to sleep.
He was trying to be nice. He really was. It turned out Molly wasn’t actually completely insufferable. She was reasonably intelligent, although naïve. She would catch onto things quickly, meaning Sherlock rarely had to explain things, which he hated. And her irritating crush on him seemed to have more or less dissipated, perhaps of her own inspiration or at the very least because she'd gotten the news that Sherlock didn't tend to be into... people like her, and was also mourning the sudden and tragic loss of his best friend and lover.
He didn’t know when his sense of purpose in life and his value in the world had become so tied up in Sherlock. Perhaps it was because Sherlock had come waltzing into his life at the same time he was seriously considering firing his Browning into his brain. He was sure his old therapist would have had something to say about how Sherlock was an unhealthy coping mechanism.
"Sherlock, after everything that has happened. All of the deceit, the betrayal, you still want him?"
But three continents, more than a dozen countries, a new bullet wound (it had only been a graze), a couple more stab wounds, a broken and rebroken nose healed just crooked enough that no one would think anything of it but John would always remember, countless scratches and bruises, and nearly two months later, John was back in London. Mary always joked that the other guy always got it way worse, which was true. But the other guys only had to face him once. John on the other hand had to face an endless stream of other guys, and it had taken its toll.
He saw that Mary had a little red dot on her forehead. He followed angle of laser beam to find Moran hunched up in the rafters with a sniper rifle. How and when he’d gotten up there, John wasn’t sure. Mary, however, had her own weapon pointed in John’s direction, currently at Victor who was nearly completely blocking John’s smaller frame. She was staring back at him, her expression patient. She was waiting.
So John stepped forwards, grabbed Sherlock and kissed him. Sherlock eagerly returned the kiss. After a few moments John decided it was his turn to go exploring, and he began to undo the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt and run his hands slowly down Sherlock’s pale chest. Sherlock shrugged the shirt off, and it fell to the floor. John continued to let his hands roam.
But none of that mattered really. Because Sherlock was kissing John. And it was brilliant. And John was kissing back.
But then maybe he could do both. Sherlock sat down on a bench on the southbank overlooking and river and began to wait. He situated himself in front of a window in his mind palace and processed both the world outside him and the events that had occurred recently.
“You care for me as well,” Sherlock said far too simply. The implication of his words hung in the air though, and suddenly London felt so small, like it was closing in on him.
Distantly, John thought he heard a noise that sounded like am alarm going off, but then again he also thought he could feel Sherlock nuzzling his neck.
“Yes, what are the chances?” he muttered. “So, what have you been up to since university?” he asked, probing in his best normal person small talk voice.
It was then he realized that the boat was moving. Moran must have been moving the boat into position. Moriarty had mentioned that John would die in the river, and while the water surrounding Canary Wharf did belong to the Thames, it didn’t exactly have the dramatic image of a boat sliding under the water line with Parliament in the background that John had imagined when Moriarty had first described his fate. The man after all was all about theatrics. He also then realized that the clues Moriarty said he’d left for Sherlock probably had to lead somewhere, and again, for theatrical purposes, that probably wasn’t the docks. For a moment hope surged through John. Even if it wasn’t Sherlock, maybe if the boat went down publicly, he’d stand a chance at rescue. But he quickly stamped the hope away. If there was any hope, he’d rather be pleasantly surprised then disappointed.
“What?” Sherlock paused, retracing what he’d said. “Oh, yes, well doctors being moral and all that, but also Moriarty’s want for the best. I imagine that the doctor was threatened, and even then could have likely only have agreed once he learned that his patient would already be dead. The pool of doctors who would fall to blackmail or threats is far larger than that of doctors who could be paid off to commit such a crime or do it for fun. Someone involved in the study could have been approached as well, someone who had desperately wanted human test subjects. But that still confirms the need for this murder to involve at least a pair.”
in any sense of the word, he felt repulsed at the idea of letting someone like Irene Adler anywhere near Sherlock.
, John told himself, trying to keep himself from panicking while Moriarty set to work, carefully running the blade along the base of John’s jaw, stopping to wipe the blade on a towel before repeating the motion.
This couldn’t be happening. In all the possible realities that Sherlock had ever considered, John drowning in the Thames in a ship wreck caused by Moriarty was not one of them. In fact, despite how he fought to try and protect John from Moriarty these past few weeks, he hadn’t ever considered it a possibility that John could actually die. John was his shining good thing. He had already survived so much, he was supposed to be invincible.
John followed Moriarty into the small room at the back of the boat that had last week been an office. Now it was completely bare except for a set of chains that hung from the ceiling and a trunk against the back wall. No light made it in past the thick paper that was gaffer taped over the windows, and the only light came from a dim yellow ceiling light that occasionally flickered tauntingly.
The worst thing was, Sherlock already knew that he was coerced. He knew that he hadn’t killed anyone. But Sherlock was stubborn. He had seen Sherlock’s hatred for John take its hold over Sherlock before he walked away this afternoon. Sherlock already thought he had the answer. He wouldn’t look for opposing data. He almost wished that he had been the assassin instead of the doctor.
“Are you trying to deduce me, Holmes?” Victor asked, still grinning at Sherlock with eyes twinkly mischievously in a way that Sherlock was coming to despise. “I’m not a very interesting person, mate. Everything interesting there is to know about me, you probably already know, and not because there’s a certain kind of mud on my shoes or tan lines on my neck but because we were friends for nearly three years and I, perhaps unfortunately, haven’t changed much since then.”
“No, it’s fine. If you’re sure it’s secure here I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t start catching me up. Do you actually have someone identified as being linked to Moriarty, or are we still working on following strings?” John struggled to pull himself a bit more upright in bed, groaning as pressure shifted along his back.
The only thing Huxley did seem to be good for was that he was desperate enough to make a deal that would ensure he was not sent to the same prison as Phil Rogers, who he apparently did not leave on the best terms at their last meeting, he, in panicked desperation, named the crime fighting force that had been destroying Sherlock’s career.
“No. I mean, well, yes. A little. I’m the best in my field dammit, and not even one sketchy text message to probe my interest. I wouldn’t have said yes or anything, but it’s nice to be appreciated,” she grumbled and John couldn’t help but look horrified.
“A DI really shouldn’t litter,” Sherlock quipped, and Lestrade groaned. “But why are we talking about Lestrade’s attempts to kill his colleague when we should be on our way to a crime scene where there is a person who’s already been murdered! The fact that you’ve been consulting Harrison enough to get through an entire pack of menthols before you came to us is an insult,” Sherlock had tried to act haughty, but had far to eagerly rushed to put on his coat, not taking notice of the fact that John had picked back up the medical journal that Sherlock had abandoned upon Lestrade’s entrance.
After the assessment of his body, the situation at hand returned to his mind. Moriarty had inevitably sent whatever photo or video he took of John to someone, and the most logical assumption was that that person was Sherlock. He imagined Sherlock receiving proof of John’s brokenness. He imagined Sherlock’s face showing fragments of endless emotions: anguish, anger, betrayal, pain, bitterness, disappointment, rage.  Maybe rescue
So Sherlock resigned himself to his babysitting and spent every free moment trying to unravel the mystery of Victor Trevor.
When he got outside he found himself in a dimly lit hall way. He heard the sounds of sirens in the distance.
“John, Victor hasn’t been hiding out, exactly. Well, he’s trying to, but not from the police or anything. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t think that it was relevant you know, you’re so busy being some sort of superhero and all,” Mary tried to joke but John wasn’t having any of it.
His moment of victory though was cut short as his eyes scanned the room and he caught sight of a man standing across the room, leaning casually against a stack of boxes.
“No. No. I mean. Yes. But don’t be sorry. There is no place left for me in that world anyway, not after everything I’ve done.”
“Smile for the camera, Johnny!” Moriarty sang, then raised a foot and smashed it into John’s skull and John saw no more as he lost consciousness.
“Oh, Johnny. Ever so stoic. Here you are, awaiting your execution and you’ve become so resigned? You don’t have any hope? You don’t think that there is even just the smallest possibility that I’m wrong?”
They were back at their old flat, which was caked in a layer of dust but otherwise eerily the same. What kind of money did their man have to pay eight months of rent in London rather than have to deal with the minor inconvenience of moving it in and out of storage? Were tax dollars being spent on this?
“It’s just a precaution John. Don't want to overwork your throat and you’re not out of the woods yet. We had to call in some help. We were hoping to avoid it, but unfortunately when you passed out again if became clear that we couldn’t pull you through this with a round of nearly expired antibiotics, some antibacterial ointment and a box of plasters,” the woman, who John remembered now was the same one as earlier, said. He took a closer look at her now that his mind was cloudy with painkillers rather than screaming in pain. She was probably about his height, maybe a bit shorter. Relatively unassuming. Short blond hair, wearing tapered khaki trousers and a blouse and cardigan. " It was a bit touch and go for a while, and you were on a lot of drugs, so I don't imagine you remember much of the past few days. /but you're on the road to recovery."
“Repressed emotions?” John squawked, still hoping to sound scandalized but instead just sounding pathetic.
century. Their relationship was valid whether or not they consummated it with penetrative sex, dammit.
“He’s right, or that was at least the case with the other two,” Lestrade confirmed. “How did you know?”
Lestrade was insistent that there was nothing that pointed anyone towards the existence of some sort of vigilante, nor that this was a move of Moriarty’s. Sherlock knew that the Yard wasn’t thick enough to think that this was just some sort of coincidence. What Lestrade meant when he insisted that there was nothing to investigate was, “Sherlock, don’t be a bloody idiot and go prodding somewhere you don’t belong. If we get a definitive lead, we’ll take care of it, and call you when we need you.” Lestrade may have been a man of few spoken words, but he had always had a habit of silently telling Sherlock off.
“Eleven people, Johnny. Now, over the course of a career that hardly compares to someone like Seb, but how many people have you killed in the past year, Sebby?”
“Cruel? You want to talk about cruel? John has betrayed me! He led me to care about him, when the whole time he was working with Moriarty. He hid himself from me entirely, mutilating corpses into a way in which they were specifically designed to taunt me!
“Fuck off,” John snapped, but he grinned. “Shaving around the scar is annoying and since I don’t have to keep it meticulously clean anymore might as well leave it be,” he explained. Really though he just hated to look at it. He didn’t want to have anyone else see it. It was far too much of an identifying feature. He was deformed. The best he could do is hide the evidence of it. “You try building enough muscle onto a body that was withered enough to give the Great Sherlock I Don’t Eat While I’m Working and All I Do Is Work Holmes a run for his money that you’re not blown over by every gust of wind in less than a month of recovery time. And the sunglasses are cool. Every anti-criminal mastermind needs a signature look.”
The adrenaline began to wear off and Sherlock began to lag farther and farther behind the other man, until finally the other man turned a corner and by the time Sherlock reached it and turned in the direction the man had gone, he was nowhere in sight. He also, Sherlock realized, happened to be nearly two miles from the crime scene. He cursed and whipped out his phone, texting Lestrade.
“Yes, why exactly didn’t you bring me in weeks ago? And why haven’t the press reported on it yet?” Sherlock asked.
“Ice dancing? Since when does anyone know anything about ice dancing, especially you?” John replied, choosing to ignore the more important bits of what Sherlock had said.
They had been playing this game for an hour already. Sherlock had showed up at the Maplin that Victor was apparently working at and the man had been perfectly jovial, telling Sherlock that he got off work in half an hour so if he wanted to wait around they could go get a drink and catch up. Sherlock had impatiently feigned interest in cameras while waiting for Victor to get off. Victor had chattered away as he’d led Sherlock up the street to the pub about the annoying customers and his crazy boss, barely letting Sherlock get a word in.
Moriarty set down the razor and the towel and took up a bottle, pouring a liquid into his palms and warming it between his hands. He then brought his hands to John’s cheeks with a slap. John hissed at the sting of the aftershave. The cold burn seeping into his pores, however, seemed to reset something within John’s mind. It was like he’d been drenched in ice water, and had now snapped out of it.
The conversation had gone nowhere helpful. Victor reminisced about some incident from university that Sherlock had deleted involving Sherlock stealing a car to drive out to a local farm to “borrow” a pig carcass to run experiments on. Apparently, the corpse had experienced some sort of rupture and intestinal fluid and blood left a massive stain in the trunk of the car. The car, as why would Sherlock steal the unlocked 1980 Citroën 2CV that Victor had apparently suggested when he could steal the Jag, had belonged to the son of some politician with an OBE. Apparently, the twat had become convinced that someone had been murdered in the back of his car. A full investigation was immediately launched, but came to a screeching halt when the results came back from the lab and pig’s blood was found. Sherlock was never caught. Oh, how the tabloids had been in an uproar when they found out, Victor told Sherlock, laughing uproariously
“Victor, don’t you think we should at least wait until John gets out of hospital? He needs to rest.”
Sherlock's mind worked madly to make sense of everything. A whirlwind of information flying around in his mind, and Sherlock was working madly to file it all away into the appropriate rooms. But it was coming together somehow. amidst the chaos.
“Why don’t we go get some coffee or something? We’ve got a whole team who have been working all night to try and get John back. But dying of exposure isn’t going to help anything.”
but instead he said nothing. He couldn’t make anything come out of his mouth. Everything had gone so horribly wrong.
John woke up with a groan. He’d unfortunately become so used to waking up in captive situations over the past few months that he instantly began his routine for such situations without thinking about it. He began to scan his surroundings, realizing he was upright, likely strung from the ceiling, and began looking for means of escape. He appeared to be in some sort of old warehouse or factory, judging by the high ceilings and large, occasionally broken windows. There was a set of double doors on the other side of the long room. He then tested his restraints. Chains jangled above him. Leather cuffs attached to his wrists. Leather cuffs. John froze. It was then he finally remembered where he was this time and the panic set in.
He briskly continued north, trying to take in anything and everything along the way. He didn’t know what he was looking for, but there had to be something that screamed John.
The final thought echoed in John’s mind. It was quickly answered when Moriarty walked back towards him and held the phone screen before him.
Sherlock took his bearings as consciousness came back to him. He appeared to be leaned up against a box in some sort of storage room.
“I told you that we were going to work on disassembling a gang that Moriarty draws a lot of his hit men from next. Well Vic went out to snoop around a flat of one the higher-ups in the gang that serves as a bit of a home base. No one was supposed to be around, I’d tailed them a while ago and their schedule seems pretty strict.”
John and Mary were sat on the sofa in their flat, beers in hand, for a little post-mission-stroke-operation-or-whatever-the-hell-it-was-they-were-doing-now-a-day celebration.
Sherlock Holmes was different than other people his age. He was in no way a usual a normal seventeen year old. Probably the only thing which could be described
Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle out loud, typing out his next reply. Before he knew it, he had spent the whole morning, lying in bed and texting with John and the next time he actually consciously checked the time it was already 10am. Had they seriously just spent four hours texting? He had barely even noticed the hours flying by, but he should probably go downstairs sometime soon, the rustling downstairs suggested that his mother was preparing some kind of birthday breakfast for him or something. Reluctantly telling John that they’d talk later – he really didn’t want to answer the questions his mother would surely have if he was constantly on his phone – he put it aside and walked downstairs, preparing his just woke up act.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock asked and tried not to show how startled he was at his sudden appearance.
“Are you joking?” Janine asked, following Sherlock over to the table he had spotted. “The guy is totally into you and you just walk off?” she asked with a laugh. “Don’t tell me he isn’t your type, because he’s super cute.”
"Dinner?" The doctor asked and frowned at his cup, "I don't recall you mentioning that before." he continued and sighed, dinner would be a terrible idea tonight. Not that he wouldn't like to spend time with Sherlock, but he really needed a bit of distance after the dream last night. It was still so real in his mind. It didn't feel like a dream. It didn't fade slowly like they usually did. It was all still bright and colourful in his head.
"I wouldn't mind to hear that more often as well." she said on purpose loud enough for Sherlock to hear and chuckled which Sherlock only answered with a roll of his eyes.
Sherlock wasn't exactly sure, but his heart seemed to have stopped for a second at John's words. He still wanted to go on that date? After all? Sherlock bit his lip, at the unpleasant and unknown feel inside in chest. It hurt. Not physically – not really, but almost.
“Well, you gotta give it to her, Willie.” The barkeeper said – right… his passport said his name was William. He did tend to forget that. “Her gaydar
“Don’t.” Sherlock said and cringed, though he laughed along with his mother. “Just put whatever you meant to say just now on the list too.
Feeling the pressure rise, John put both hands on either side of Sherlock's face, pulling him softly up again, capturing the man's lips in a heated, still sweet kiss and rolling them over as the alpha male got the better of him. Sitting on top of the taller man, John almost ripped off Sherlock's shirt and trousers, tossing them aside and petting the man's chest with his lips while he moved his hand down between their exposed bodies and began to massage him, firm but still tender and soft, doing – due a lack of experience with men – what he knew he liked to have done to himself. He whole heartedly savoured Sherlock's moans, wanting to memorise those pleasured sounds. Sounds he knew he elicited.
“Not what I mean..” Janine said and reached for some toilet paper to wipe her mouth, “Did I say to Mr Watson that he’s a catch?” she asked and Sherlock snorted.
(and those possible friends were probably more than happy if they'd never have so much of bad luck to meet Sherlock Holmes). But Mummy thought that was exactly what Sherlock needed.
“Sorry, Mr Watson.” Janine said, before looking down at the book. “He’s stern, but he’s actually a good guy, I think. Super fair.”
"It doesn't, Sher. You look good. I bet you'll be the hot topic of the girls before lunch ends." Mummy chuckled and gave Sherlock a wink, followed by her usual
His first day on this school wasn't even over and he was already made fun of. For something that was even only more or less true as he had no idea what he really was, having not found the right term yet. He liked to call it asexual, but that was only an unverified supposition.
“Oh, yes. She does. The way you uncomfortably pulled me past her and said we were ‘studying’.. that is totally code for ‘
Later that evening, when the birthday proceedings (which in his family meant cake and a bunch of calls from relatives which Sherlock had to reluctantly answer) were over, Sherlock and Janine went upstairs, where she instantly began the evening preparations, unloading the contents of her bag on his bed.
Spitting onto his fingers eventually, John slowly slipped his hand between Sherlock's well formed cheeks, using the mixture of saliva and precum as some sort of substitution for lubricant as he experimentally stroked his fingertips over Sherlock's entrance, hearing the man beneath him gasp fondly, which strengthened his courage. Taking a deep breath, John swallowed and circled the ring of muscles a few times, before pushing one finger in, letting the tight muscle adjust to the intrusion and luxuriating in Sherlock's sounds once again.
“Well, she’s not that kind of mother, she’s actually highly gifted and goes by facts, rather than assumptions and clichés.” Sherlock said and smiled at the way Janine made herself right at home.
Instead of an answer, Sherlock walked into the room, closing the door behind him, blocking out the light from the landing.
“You’re supposed to read, not chitchat.” Watson said and actually smiled as he looked at Sherlock and Janine, seeming genuinely pleased he and that Janine girl were talking, despite his words.
“Hello, Mrs Holmes, I’m Janine.” Janine said and walked over to them with a smile, holding out her hand to shake his mother’s.
The barkeeper cracked a little smile, “Well, happy birthday.” He said and – did the guy just wink? The big grin on Janine’s face seemed to say that he did.
So, I'm sorry if that annoys anyone, but that's just how my writing developed and I feel like forcing myself to go back to the way I did things five years ago would just take the fun out of writing and I'll eventually just procrastinate writing in the first place and eventually stop again and that whole shabang, so I basically just wanted to let you guys know what to expect from the story to take away what mostly stopped me from continuing this earlier :3
While Sherlock walked through the doors of his new school, he was already able to tell that this school would be like all those Sherlock had read about only by looking at his dull schoolmates that were flooding the hall. Giggling girls, boys that tried to look cool, leaning casually against the lockers, all grouped in different cliques, but when one looked closely, they were all just the same. Just like the boring teachers which strolled occasionally through the crowd, looking all but motivated. Oh this was going to be torture, days full of dull people saying stupid things and Sherlock was forced to keep his mouth shut.
“What are you doing here?” his mother asked in astonishment, walking over to the counter to make some coffee.
»Sherlock?« John repeated and frowned, what the hell was he up to this time? He tried to make him out in the pitch-black room, but failed poorly. He only got an idea where where he was when John felt movement on the mattress.
The next day, Sherlock got up extra early, which surprised his mother when he was already sitting at the kitchen table, completely – and
“Says the guy that yelled ‘gay’ and ‘virgin’ around a bunch of immature students on his first day.” Janine said and huffed a laugh, “I mean.. you could have just turned up in a clowns costume, that would have been less painful to watch.”
gay, you’d be aware of it yourself. And let’s face it, the vast majority of our society is still indoctrinated that boys will end up with girls. So I figured you’d go with the most likely theory to start things of and let off steam with a girl first.” She said and Sherlock shuddered.
His friendship with Janine had blossomed as well and they were pretty much spending every afternoon together. Janine had made it her mission – apart from polishing up his social skills – to also educate Sherlock on movies and TV shows, which they had watched in abundance when they hadn’t been busy studying chemistry together (Janine had actually aced their last exam, which had been her first A in chemistry ever), going out shopping or just simply sitting there, discussing guys (the theory that he was gay wasn’t as much of a theory anymore anyway) or the stupidity of the people in school.
