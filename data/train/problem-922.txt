"Sherlock's not well. I need to go to the hospital with him..." Mrs Hudson drew in a breath, a hand pressed to her lips. Her apartment smelled of a soothing combination of lemon drops and tea. "Could you look after Rosie? I'm sorry it's so early, but -"
Sherlock is a long-term sufferer of asthma. Glimpse into his daily life, and childhood, with the illness.
"Duty calls," the doctor sighed, a weary smirk crossing his features. The two stumbled downstairs, coming across a scene that, some how, didn't leave them at all shocked.
It's at this point Anderson knows something's wrong. Shifting nervously, he runs outside, searching for Lestrade. He finds the DI going over the details of the case with Sally. "Greg," he says once he slides to a stop in front of him. "It's Sherlock. He doesn't look good."
Phillip closes his eyes briefly, trying to contain the sudden onslaught of rage. "If there's something you're not telling us, Freak-"
"Doing whatever I tell you to." His flatmate groans, and it's followed by a chuckle from John. "Come on mate, it's not much. Just resting when I say, taking the medicine, eating what I give you and drinking all the fluids I say you need to drink. That way, we can get rid of it as soon as possible."
Sherlock could go quite long periods without them, if he took his medications and looked after his lungs and airways, but every once in a while he'd go down with a bout. John was usually there to help him fumble for a rescue remedy, and other than the sickness before Christmas, John had never been truly scared of Sherlock's condition.
"I was reluctant to call you in," Lestrade admits, standing next to him and wringing his hands, a guilty expression plastered onto his face. "It seemed so simple at first, I was sure we could solve it. But the whole team is completely stumped."
"Mr. Holmes?" He looked up, matching Dr. Wilson's expectant gaze. He felt his brother place a hand lightly upon his forearm – a rare, but appreciated, show of affection.
"We have a thirty-year-old male in here, unconcious." She looked at the detective on the ground. "I think it was a panic attack. He's claustrophobic."
And she was right. A week later, he had made a full recovery, and after some bloodwork, was back on course to finish his treatment.
He strained a smile, not trusting himself to laugh, and lay back on the pillows. John brought another from the living room and stuffed it under his curly head, plumping it up in the process. The detective pulled the covers up to this chin, shivering. He looked rather miserable, if John said so himself, and he found himself caressing the younger man's head as a mother would do a sick child. "You are a little warm."
"Sherlock?" John yelled in surprise, sprinting over to kneel down next to his newly acquired friend. "What's wrong?"
Mycroft narrowed his eyes. It did not suit his already aloof features. "You are his friend, are you not?"
The DI nods, but there's something he isn't saying. He seems to be staring fixedly at the wall on his left, and John follows his gaze, to find that Sherlock is already one step ahead.
"You're wrong." Sherlock seemed incredibly offended by these two words, and shot John a death glare.
"He should wake in the next few hours," the nurse told him, making notes on his chart quietly. John nodded, smiling.
It had been eighteen months since Sherlock was unreasonably nonchalant about the state of his health following the, quite plainly, horrific hospital stay - "malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly, I've been off my tits for weeks!" - and currently, John was living with Sherlock, Rosie almost constantly balanced on one knee and a notepad and pen balanced on the other. The doctor recalled distinctly how Culverton brought his friend almost as close to death as he'd been in previous fiascos - with a little help from the drugs of course - but now there lapsed a feeling of peace over Baker Street, one not quite perfect but, preferable. Things weren't necessarily always good; in fact often, they were quite bad, but John's new motto went something like, "It is what it is." And that was, sometimes, shit. Except, he didn't quite anticipate how shit it could really get, until he woke up to a crash one morning in their flat.
"To hell with the work!" John shouts, slamming his fist down on the concrete. "Why did you never tell me Sherlock? Why?"
"No wallet or identity found on the body," Lestrade ventures, also watching the taller man. "Looks a bit like-"
She tilted her head, meeting Sherlock's gaze as he twisted, barely conscious. John's patience was thinning. "Shall I tell him?" John looked down at his friend for a moment before turning back to Irene, police sirens whistling somewhere in the distance. Irene smiled at him knowingly. "My measurements."
John knelt beside him, examining his eyes. The detective continued to struggle against the power of the drug. "Sherlock, can you hear me?"
"Alright," Lestrade said once John had switched the shower off, "let's get you dry. I think the fever's down now, right John?"
?" John stabbed a sausage with his fork, shaking his head and huffing in disbelief. "Mate, that was bloody incredible."
"Do best friends... do... this?" Sherlock mutters, referring to their current situation. John becomes very aware of how close they have become, and of the fact that his hands were no longer on Sherlock's neck for purely medical purposes. He shakes his head.
"Might not be anymore," Sherlock counters feebly, wrist gesturing weakly to the tester kit. Lestrade picks it up, studying it.
Minutes later, the paramedics had whisked him away. And Molly, catatonic from Sherlock's parting words, was picked up by Lestrade, who drove her home and stayed the night.
She followed him downstairs, but left him a moment to peek into Sherlock's room. He went on and boiled the kettle, prepped two mugs – both a sickly shade of yellow – and then turned and leant against the kitchen counter. The light above him flickered once.
The budding doctor spent the rest of the day jumping between studying, and picking an outfit for the evening. He'd been out plenty of times already, but this would be his first time out with
"It's okay," the coroner said, setting a gentle hand on his shoulder. "He should be fine. He looks bad at the moment because he's only just started his second cycle. But he's... capable. And he's not too accident-prone – yet."
"John, a little hand please," Lestrade asks, his eyes never leaving the half-conscious man next to him. The doctor jumps into action, hurrying over and falling to his knees next to the DI. "Can you check inside his pockets for his blood glucose level testing kit?"
"I don't feel good Myc," he whispered, lip trembling a little as he turned wide eyes on his brother. Mycroft leaned forward, lips pursed. "I feel all wobbly inside here." He pressed shaking hands onto his stomach, refusing to drop the other Holmes' gaze.
"Molly," he began again, tapping a finger against the edge of his mug nervously, "I just wanted to uh, thank you. For being here. God knows no one expects it of you."
One cycle of chemoradiotherapy treatment had been enough to truly wear Sherlock down. A second round was clearly going to be too awful to stand. The first Friday of the cycle – his last day that week of radiotherapy, but his first day of oral EP chemo – saw the younger Holmes slumped in his armchair, orange pills glinting forgotten under the lamplight.
"My arms," he whispered, and then the offending limbs shifted as if holding themselves out for John to inspect. "Itches." John unbuttoned the sleeves and rolled the soft cotton up to reveal his friend's pale forearms. There was no rash, no mosquito bites - simply a map of track marks spattered across the crooks of his elbows, plucked by a young cartographer. The doctor's hands ghosted over the scars, and he could hardly imagine what Sherlock must be dreaming about. "'M trying," he breathed sadly into the pillow, and John's heart clenched.
John thought back to an hour previously, when the detective had been weeping pitifully into his pillow, and wondered how much truth was actually in that statement. As horrifying as the experience had been, it was probably for the best - now, the doctor knew how closely he should be watching his friend. For the moment, he decided to humour him.
He hated him for it, but Mycroft was right. It could not look less good – John wasn't sure he had seen anything so 'not good' in all his life.
Mycroft was standing at the end of the bed. "They had to treat the wounds on his back," he commented distastefully, gesturing with his umbrella. John swallowed thickly, regarding the fresh bandage and the unsettling protrusion of his friend's spine with something akin to horror.
"Lovely," he drawled sarcastically, smirking. "I suppose I shall have to hold my nose and bear it. How many shots are socially acceptable?"
"You going to have some?" He urged, pointing at the tea. Sherlock grimaced, paling even further, if that was possible. But, if he was to keep up appearances...
," Sherlock moans as he vomits noisily into the toilet bowl, before lazily reaching for a tissue so he can clear his sinuses
John clears his throat, still feeling the sides of Sherlock's neck. "Um, well they... they always have each other's backs..."
"So, what are his chances?" Mycroft had asked, tone clipped – straight to the point, as per usual. "And how can we maximise them?"
Ironically, it's Donavan herself that offers up a chocolate bar, and for once, her eyes don't possess any spite. Using his teeth to unwrap it, the DI hands it to Sherlock, who begins to chew it with a morose expression.
It was a second later that his little figure began to convulse. Mycroft closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and quickly reached for the cushion to cradle Sherlock's jerking head. He watched on quietly as his younger sibling's thin limbs seized, trying to contain his horror as his elbows quickly grew red with carpet burns and he felt the floor become warm beneath his palms. It lasted just over two minutes, but it could easily have been hours. Mycroft released a breath he didn't know he'd been holding when the younger Holmes finally went still.
Sherlock shook his head. "A while back. I was... much younger, early twenties. I've always been careful... after that." John nods, taking a seat. "London is... particularly cold this year. I guess... an average of -2ºC."
"Shh," Molly soothed as he burped again, this time spitting some bile into the bowl. He hung there for a while more, though it seemed to be over, saliva hanging from his mouth in a precarious string.
"No, no, no," John looped his arms underneath his friend's, hauling his gangly form upright. "No." He dumped him on top of the sheets, dragging them over his legs in the process. "Back to bed. You'll be fine in the morning. Just sleep."
"Now, John," the older man demands, and then the soldier is frantically turning coat pockets inside out in the quest for a kit John had no idea his flatmate needed. Finally getting lucky he pulls it out and offers it to Lestrade, who nimbly draws out a needle and pricks Sherlock's thumb.
It was a miserable existence, and Watson could not help but feel an intense sympathy. Holmes' wings had been clipped, for lack of better phrase, and the inescapable impression that he could be spending the remainder of his existence incapacitated indoors deeply frustrated him. Not even his violin could soothe him, and before long, the flat fell into a melancholy silence.
"Because we need it to survive," John mutters under his breath, ever the physician. But he trots after Sherlock anyway, ignoring the uncomfortable grumbles his stomach emits.
"Wrong," Sherlock replies quietly, sliding down onto his knees and inspecting the carpet. He raises his magnifying glass to his eye, only to have it catch the light and explode in a millisecond of pure white; the detective clutches his head, groaning.
The older man smirked. "I'm Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's older brother. I was called upon his admission. Might you update me on his condition?"
"Barely anything, I swear –" the words had scarcely left his lips before he was gagging again, and John helped manoeuvre him back towards the toilet before he made a mess of the floor. He sighed in sympathy at Sherlock's agonised groaning between heaves, and moved to rub his back again, feeling helpless. But even a trainee medic could do little for a hangover...
John blinked dumbly, and then once more. He cleared his throat, letting his spoonful of mash fall unceremoniously back onto his plate, splattering the toffee pudding sitting slovenly in the corner of his tray. Sherlock sipped his squash quietly, using his fork to push his food around. "I..." John rubbed his hands along his knees, astonished. "We've... only met each other twice." The other man grunted dismissively. "And you got all that from just... two tiny conversations?"
Sherlock laughs, rubbing a hand over his face. "You didn't take advantage, don't be stupid." No response. "Anyway- if anyone should be sorry, it's me."
Everything starts to blur in front of him, a pool of colour shifting and morphing in the glaring light of the sun. Sherlock squints at the police tape, a dull pain beginning to pound behind his eyes. John isn't with him today- Sarah had threatened to fire him if he didn't return to work in the next twenty-four hours.
The first was seemingly harmless. It must have been about a case, because John heard his friend mutter things like "obvious" and "phone," and then sometimes he would twist and turn like a criminal was getting away. John had smiled at this, wondering if he was in fact dreaming about their first case together, and began picturing himself the chases they had partaken in. However soon the first dream lapsed into the second - and the second was far more concerning.
The body has already been removed from the house, but otherwise the crime scene is untouched. Sniffing the air, Sherlock scans the room, noting the sofa's position and the angle of the coffee table.
"No service," Donavan interjected, glaring at her phone. "God. I'm stuck with you guys untll someone realises we're in here."
Lestrade slaps Sherlock's cheek gently, trying to rouse him. "Come on mate, you've had worse. We only need you awake for a minute," he bargains, sliding a straw in the carton. Sherlock's eyes seem to blink, before opening half way. He lets out a sort of frustrated moan, as if upset to be found on the floor, and John would have laughed had the situation not been so serious. "That's it. Can you suck on this?" He places the straw in Sherlock's mouth and the detective begins pulling on the liquid automatically. "Good, good. You're almost there."
"Molly," she interrupted, accepting the tea graciously and cradling it in both hands. "I-I know, we haven't spoken a lot, but we've worked together enough detective, and now this. You can call me Molly, if you want."
"Last night," John supplies, looking over the body once again. Several seconds pass, and John wonders at the silence. Anderson's turned up, and no one has said anything. No - Anderson's turned up, and
Sherlock holds up his phone, face expressionless. "Postman. It's been on the news recently- someone has been impersonating a postman, delivering false mail and then breaking into the backs of houses. You just have to track him down and arrest him."
When they arrived in A&E, Sherlock had already been hooked up to oxygen and flung it aside agitatedly twice - the nurses took one look at him, blue lips and all, and rushed him through to a private room. John explained that he had asthma and that his reliever was not working - he brought the blue inhaler out and handed it over to the attending doctor - all the while Sherlock weakly fought off a nurse as she tried to insert a tube into his oxygen mask.
Holmes' glare was so sharp it would have cut through the window-glass, had the window not already been swung wide and allowing the sluggish passage of sour air into the room. Dr. Watson returned to the page, lifting his chin and clearing his throat. "
"I can tell you care about him," Lestrade stated, and he didn't flinch when John flushed furiously, an argument already half way to his lips. The DI shook his head. "That's not what I mean. I care about him, too." He nodded to affirm this. "It just means you've become friends pretty fast. Which is... good. He needed someone to come along and... befriend him."
When they're finished, both are out of breath for no particular reason. John closes his eyes and leans his head against his flatmates before sitting up and looking around the room. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock starts to shake, falling down onto one knee. The pain is becoming unbearable; he can barely open his eyes, let alone stand up straight. He can hear Anderson screeching in the background, each word a knife twisting in his head- he moans against the side of the sofa, sliding down to the floor.
The taller boy coughed, bringing a hand up to scratch at his neck. "That's not what people usually say."
In only a few seconds, his breaths became quick, raspy pants, the air only succeeding in drying out his mouth and the pain intensifying in his torso. John held onto him, worry etched onto his tanned face as Sherlock held the blue inhaler gingerly between two fingers, looking at him with fear.
When John walked into the bedroom, he didn't know what he expected - perhaps Sherlock rattling off some deductions as Irene bargained for her phone back - but what he did find didn't entirely surprise him. The detective was sprawled out on the floor, trying in vain to lift himself up, whilst The Woman made a beeline for the bathroom.
from across the flat. Sherlock had thrown his bedroom door into the wall, and was now stumbling unevenly down the hall. Molly stood, knocking over her tea, and stared at Greg for a moment. There was a microsecond of silence, everything suspended, and then suddenly a flurry of movement as the coroner collected herself and rushed from the kitchen.
Amongst the graffiti, there's a message. It's not necessarily noticeable, but it's fresh - you can still smell the stink from the paint. Sherlock rubs a finger against one of the red, scruffy letters while John reads.
"Thank Christ for that," he said as he strode past. His voice was husky and deep, leaving John's bladder momentarily forgotten. He frowned.
Needless to say, enough shots that they were both sufficiently tipsy when they left their block at five to eleven, and sprinted to Klute in order to make the free entry before the clock hit the hour. A burly security guard regarded their IDs dismissively before waving them inside, where they were soon smothered by a sweaty throng of their peers and a remix of
"What's really wrong with you?" John asks, once he's collected himself. Sherlock rolls his eyes before wincing- not the greatest idea.
John knew exactly what he was expecting. He was a doctor, after all, and a bloody good one at that - but that didn't make the scene any more pleasant. Sherlock had transformed into an array of tubes and machines, each completing some bodily function that his "transport" could no longer perform. The most obscene of all was probably the thick tube trailing from his mouth, an ugly, tasteless thing that forced his chest up and back down again. John took his position in the chair by the bed, and slid his fingers inside the detective's, not even thinking twice about how perfectly they fit there.
"John," Sherlock voiced, eyebrows knitted together. "They... didn't take any videos or anything did they?"
"You're not flushed anymore, so maybe you were right," John said upon entering, knowing full well that it was because the detective had actually paled considerably, and had adopted a grayish tinge. There was no way now that Sherlock could deny his lapse in good health.
John scoffed – he'd been staring at the opposite wall aimlessly for hours, a minute hardly mattered. He took the opportunity to swig his coffee, and almost spat it back into the cup.
Before I get a ton of questions, this ending was on purpose. I wanted this fic to reflect my experiences at Durham university, especially with the friends I made there. So it's a little abrupt - creative choice. I adjusted some things - you can't actually study medicine at Durham but for the sake of this story, I made up the course. The rest is pretty accurate.
The doctor looks up from his blog to see a rather dishevelled Sherlock standing in the doorway. His eyes are red-rimmed and his face as pale as chalk. He sniffs pathetically.
The flat felt hollow; the silence, a clarity. He could hear the fridge whirring lowly throughout the flat, the echo of the tap spitting into the metal sink, the floorboards, breathing. There were three blankets folded neatly on the armchair. The table was clear of vials, burners, books – and
"It's alright, Sherlock. I've called an ambulance. They'll find out what's wrong." He clenched his jaw, eyes pricking. "I should've taken you last night -"
Lestrade grasped the handle and jiggled it up and down. "Ah, it's stuck." He yanked on it again, moving his head and peering down the side. "Bolts got caught. We can't open it from in here." He threw himself at it. "No, no way. It opens in the other direction."
"And I'm guessing we call an ambulance if he doesn't wake up," John says anxiously, moving behind Sherlock to lift up his head. "Why do you never look after yourself, Sherlock?"
Of course, we can't have that, can we? It's only right for Sherlock to reveal his ailment, publicly, in a very dramatic way. That's Sherlock's style, is it not?
"If you don't want to look after me then you can just say!" The detective's shout is ruined by a sudden fit of coughing, and Watson steps in to lift him up and tuck some more pillows behind his back. His gaze softens when he see's Sherlock's eyes watering and his chest heaving, and he perches on the edge of the sofa.
One evening, with the fire lit and casting sunset shadows over the walls and furniture, Holmes turned to him with bright eyes and a small smile. "Dr. Watson," he said, voice much stronger than it had been several weeks prior, "I must thank you."
They let John on the ambulance with him, and he slapped Sherlock's hand when the detective tried to cast aside the oxygen mask. "Stop it," he ordered, expression serious. "Just breathe with it. You need it."
She breathed harsh through her nose, sitting up quickly. "Oh," she said, looking around. The sun was setting. "I didn't mean to sleep so late."
"I -" Sherlock swallowed thickly, glancing off to the right. "It's nausea. It hangs there like a..." Sherlock faced John again, tongue slack. "I'm so tired."
"A week." He gnawed on his bottom lip. "You woke up yesterday, but I don't know if you remember much."
"Tomorrow." The word was final. "I need... bed." He stood up slowly, his chair left leaning against the table haphazardly as he wandered drearily off to his bedroom down the hall. John watched him go, taking note of the time - eight twenty-one - and vowed to take him to the hospital in the morning for a check up. After all, it could wait just a bit longer.
Sherlock smiled gently at his fate, something John found uncanny, and resolved to sleep until the next day. When he awoke, bleary-eyed and quiet, he looked John sadly in the eyes and spoke three words.
"I'm dealing with a teenager," John sighed, throwing his hands up. "Fine, don't talk to me." Silence. "Oh for - never mind." John dragged both his hands over his face. "Arrogant git," he muttered, walking away.
John grit his teeth. This wasn't fair. It shouldn't be allowed. A week was not enough time to constitute this much worry.
At the request of Holmes' older brother, they were to move to one of his estates in the country. It was a last resort, in the hopes that the fresh air and sweet quiet would lead to an impossible recovery. In all truth, Watson was willing to try anything, even if the sight of Sherlock Holmes, now frail in his common suit and unable to carry his own luggage, did little to comfort him.
He placed two Tesco bags on the counter, and took a moment to unload his goods into the fridge. He had no trouble, there were no organs or amputations to navigate around. At the end of it, there were just shelves of butter, milk, soup (Tesco's
It's a bit of struggle, but Lestrade eventually gets Sherlock on his feet, one arm flung over the older man's shoulders as they stumble out into the daylight. Groaning, Sherlock swallows hard, causing the Inspector to frown.
And then, finally: "I may have been mistaken," which Molly supposed was the best apology he could come up with. "I am also concerned, which could be why I came across so... crass."
Sherlock smirks, but shakes his head. "I'm slightly offended by your tone of surprise, but no, I haven't." John blushes, thankful Sherlock hadn't noticed how ridiculously jealous his exclamation had sounded. "Anderson has mononucleosis and he kissed Sally. When Sally found out she had it she spat in my coffee. It transfers through saliva."
"Sherlock?" Anderson questions, slightly unnerved by the sight of the man in front of him. He's obviously in pain, but Anderson's not sure how he's supposed to react to the Freak's whimper of agony. Taking a small step closer, he bites his lip. "Something... wrong?"
"I left you a bucket in your room for a reason," she scolded, frown marring her face. "You can't keep straining yourself like this."
John nodded, flicking through the files balanced on his knees. There was a small picture of Sherlock attached by a paperclip to a slip of hospital admin - he was sitting up in bed, grinning stupidly (yes, stupidly) and holding up a play pirate. A cannula thread its way across his face and into his nostrils. Mycroft appeared behind the doctor, looking down at the picture. He smiled. "He was five. He didn't make a fuss, actually managed to win over a few of the nurses with his... charms." His brow crept over his eyes, and he pouted. "He always liked pirates. Could never understand why..."
The doctor gripped Sherlock's hand as he came to several minutes later, eyes more grey than blue and staring somewhere past John's knee. The smaller man rubbed his shoulder soothingly as he moaned, his fingers sliced with shards of glass from the floor. Feeling helpless, the doctor began picking them out with his bare hands, wincing in the moments Sherlock remained unresponsive to the jagged crystals being pulled from his skin. Sherlock glanced up at him, mouth moving gently and silently, still very much limp on the cold kitchen floor.
"Ms. Hooper." The elder Holmes' voice was uncharacteristically small, and she sat straighter on the couch. "I apologise for calling so late."
He turned back to his best friend, moving him into the recovery position. "He was breathing too fast, and now he's passed out," John muttered, checking pupil responses. "Wet a paper towel with some water," he ordered, speaking to no one in particular. Lestrade did so, handing it to the doctor.
Mind over matter. Sherlock knew it was stupid to think that way, but he was the world's only consulting detective. His brain was superior, and his transport would not win. If he wanted his tea and toast to remain in his stomach, they would.
Lestrade put the lid down on the loo and sat on it, legs spread. Donavan slid down next to him, against the wall. She held her phone up to the ceiling, looking at the bars tiredly. "We're going to be here a while," Greg said, rubbing his hands together, "we may as well go over the facts, eh?"
Sherlock, as most people know, is particularly dismissive of his health. Phrases like "it's just transport," and "there is no time," often pass his articulate lips, much to the frustration of a certain Dr. Watson. However, John would probably be even more concerned if he knew the secret his detective has been keeping from him - as it goes, he remains oblivious.
"He's starting his radiotherapy this cycle." It was more a statement than a question. "He's scared, Mr. Holmes."
"Sherlock, mate," the older man says smoothly, taking a step closer to the other's man's hunched swaying figure. "When did you last eat something?"
The doctor nodded, tucking his clipboard in closer to his chest and taking off down the corridor. John drifted in and out of some kind of alternate reality, in which Mary was still alive and Sherlock hadn't destroyed himself on her orders; a gossamer dream where his life wasn't riddled with psychopaths, silvery revolvers and battered organs...
Several hours later, Sherlock was a mess amongst the hospital sheets, dark hair a shock of curls on the pillows and face mostly obscured by an oxygen mask. He was breathing evenly though, thank god, and his oxygen levels had remained stable all the while he slept. John released a shuddering breath of his own, stroking one thumb and forefinger over Sherlock's hand, whilst using the other to caress his forehead.
"Here." Lestrade offered up the glass of water as Sherlock reached over to flush the evidence away, and the younger man glanced at him gratefully, accepting it with both shaking hands. He sipped it slowly, ignoring the worried stares he was receiving from the other two people in the room.
"Am not," the detective countered, angrily brushing a curl away from his face in order to take a look through the microscope properly. He couldn't see through it right, it was out of focus. There must have been something wrong with the lens...
Mycroft had called, asking after his brother and letting John know he'd threatened the staff - despite John telling him that wouldn't be necessary - and John had told him it was under control and he should be home by tomorrow. Satisfied, the older Holmes had left John to the sentimental soothing.
He looked like hell. His complexion had taken on a sallow grey, matched only by the deep circles beneath his eyes, and John felt his heart constrict at the sight of tears and snot on the young man's face. He quickly reached behind him and folded a wad of tissue, before gently wiping at the mess. It seemed the only available way to ease his discomfort.
"Sher -" John ran a hand through his hair, feeling the sweat that had collected on his hairline. "You never said - Are you supposed to be running around like this?"
Around one o'clock, he was stopped by his name. Weak, Holmes reached out with a hand, and instinctively, Watson took it. "Dr. Watson," he wheezed again, only to be wracked with violent coughs, hardly able to lift a hand to cover his mouth. When he was finished, the good doctor wiped the blood from his chin quietly, still taken by his frailty, before hushing the detective when the man tried to talk once more.
When he finished, he was so out of it he almost fell into the basin. "Woah there," John yelped, putting it aside and hauling the detective upright. Sherlock moaned miserably when John laid him back against the cushions, and the soldier felt a pang of sympathy when he winced at the painful clenching of his internal organs. "It's alright Sherlock, I'll get you a glass of water. Oh, and we need to check that fever."
The second time something was amiss was when they were climbing the stairs to the flat, chips cradled in their hands. Suddenly, in the middle of the hallway, Sherlock stopped, and John had to consciously make an effort not to knock him over. The detective's form was hunched, a shaking hand still holding the chips and another pressed lightly to his chest. John watched as the colour drained once more from his face, washed-out eyes flickering left and right.
Sherlock watched him, unsure if he should say it. In a fleeting glance, he assessed John Watson, and then sighed, complacent. "Despite its reputation, Fresher's Week did not help me find a place to fit in."
. With the way the man rolled out of bed practically screaming perfection, could you blame him for not wanting to look like a complete and utter twat?
"No time, John," Sherlock interrupts, shooting his doctor a withering look. "Did you not hear me? A man's been murdered." The detective quickens his pace, almost in spite of his friend. "Why do you only ever think of food?"
Just under a month later, Sherlock was diagnosed with epilepsy, and was beginning to manage most of his seizures with a mixture of AEDs. A year and a half later, Sherlock received Redbeard for his seventh birthday, a russet Irish setter with long downy ears. He wore a blue clip-on jacket with bright red letters, and became Sherlock's shadow; quiet unless he was minutes from a seizure. His bark essentially became the young detective's lifeline, and their friendship was enough for Sherlock to continue his happy childhood.
Sherlock shook his head minutely, eyes closed. The whole bed moved as John stood and searched through Sherlock's drawers, bringing out a red inhaler with the long-acting beta agonist inside. "You should've taken it." The detective shrugged, tired. He only wanted to sleep. John handed him his medicine and he drew it in with one heaving breath without even thinking. "It lasts twelve hours, so you can take one at..." he checked his watch. "Two, tomorrow afternoon." Sherlock gave him a look. "I know it's a little irregular, but you can suck it up."
"I don't –" the room swayed sickeningly, and he threw out a hand to grasp John's knee, anything to ground him. "I don't know –"
The first time it has occurred it was quite minor, and it would have been missed had Mycroft not been so perceptive. Sherlock was five at the time, his steel eyes beginning to adopt a sharper appearance, and he was now mature enough that he would sit at the dinner table without too much of a fuss. It was over ham and peas that little Sherlock's sharp eyes became softer, staring endlessly into the air's particulates as he quietly consumed his ham. Sherlock remained at the table even once his plate had been taken, and Mycroft watched as he became lucid once more, looking longingly down at the grains of wood.
"Time," Watson parroted back into the silence, suddenly confronted with the terrible notion of how little they had left.
"It's my pleasure, really," she said, casting her eyes down to her lap. "I, um. I lost my dad to lung cancer, when I was young. I suppose, in a way, this helps me too. Allows me to do more than I could do back then."
Common, but deadly. For Sherlock, it came on suddenly, incubating slowly in his body after Fresher's Week, before cruelly and suddenly overpowering his immune system. John wonders if he himself had carried it, at the back of his throat, and had passed it on when he'd first met Sherlock outside the bathroom.
And then he'd taken a breath. And then another. And John looked up as he rushed clumsily over to the table and took up his inhaler. He quickly sprayed the corticosteroid into his mouth, pressing his left hand into the wood for support. He wheezed, trying to draw in a breath and then failing, returning to the inhaler once more, gasping, spraying -
"We'll set him up an IV, administer a stronger dose of corticosteroids. At this moment in time I'm a little reluctant to give him an LABA..."
The trip down to the hospital parking lot was quiet, tentative. Sherlock asked Molly if she'd perhaps like some coffee, and after a polite declination, fell silent. It wasn't until they stood outside of her old blue Toyota that the detective found the words to say.
Those sixteen minutes had been long and frantic. Molly had wrung the cloth despairingly each time, wiping the sweat from his brow and chest whilst her charge muttered insensibly. He was frightfully pale, emaciated – and for the first time, in all of Molly's stubborn optimism, she feared for his life.
The doctor set his jaw. "If you do not let yourself rest, you will never recover, Holmes." The hollowness he saw then in the other man's countenance filled his stomach with river-stones. He approached his next sentence more dubiously. "I fear it will develop into something worse. Pneumonia, perhaps."
"No," Sherlock stated simply, weaving through the police force to face the door. "No," he repeated, slamming his fists against the wood. "Is anyone there? I'm stuck in here with a bunch of imbeciles!"
Grabbing his mobile from the armchair, he punched in a number, eyes trained on Sherlock as the dial tones played out. After a few rings, a husky London accent broke through the speaker.
Sherlock looked up at him blearily, head sinking with the weight of exhaustion. "Of course I'll be fine. I
And if John hadn't been so distracted with Rosie at the time, he probably would have noticed the limp, one caused by heavily swollen ankles shoved into smaller socks - a symptom that would have had the doctor calling for a cab to Bart's.
The detective looks almost apologetic as he meets John's gaze. "You never asked," he provides, before placing the last piece of chocolate in his mouth and crushing the purple wrapper in his fist.
Both his mother and father had resolved to sitting by their son's side, stroking his hand with the soft pads of their thumbs and murmuring quietly, when Sherlock finally took a breath. Mycroft nearly wailed with relief when he turned his brother on his left hip as he choked and eventually heaved onto the old Victorian rug. Lydia had gripped his shoulder, frantically telling him to let it all out, they would clean the rug, they would
"The chair wasn't stable, or you weren't?" John snickered, walking over and holding out an arm. The detective scowled darkly, taking John's hand and allowing the good doctor to haul him to his feet. "You're not supposed to be up. What was your temperature?"
"It isn't all misery," Dr. Wilson had told him ridiculously, because to Sherlock, it certainly didn't sound like much else. "We've caught it, quite miraculously mind you, just before it could spread to your lymph nodes, trachea, and other organ systems. Over sixty percent of patients are in the extensive stage at initial diagnosis, due to the speed at which SCLC spreads. Your brother must be particularly observant to have caught it so quickly."
"Have you sat with him, even once?" Silence. "He's in pain, Mr. Holmes. And with chemoradiotherapy, it will only get worse for him. Of course, he's scared – and there's nothing irrational about it."
John stares at him for several seconds, before erupting into a fit of laughter. "Oh Sherlock, wow," he pants, wiping his eyes, "that's a good one."
"Yes," Sherlock considers, his thinking face ruined by the pallor of skin and the layer of sweat accumulating on his forehead. "I think you may have come up with a good idea for once."
"I'm not," Sherlock spat, voice hoarse and echoing inside the porcelain toilet, "vomiting into a fucking
John reached up to feel his forehead, twisting his mouth to the side. "Your fever isn't so bad," he said, and then placed an ear on Sherlock's back. "But your chest sounds like a burning building."
John laughed loudly as he keyed in the code to their block, and began muttering about pathetic excuses. The door gave a monotonous beep and clicked open, just as Sherlock rubbed his palms together and shivered.
"Look at the carpet!" Sherlock exclaims, pointing in the general area of the sofa. "You say there's no sign of a struggle, so the killer must have known her. But look!"
As March drew to a close, and April began to spread both her pollen and dewy showers across England, Watson finished packing his things at Baker Street.
Said cat screeched unhappily as she nudged him from her lap and crawled over to the other end of the sofa to answer her phone. In all honestly, she had expected to be summoned back to Baker Street much sooner, and may have enjoyed the radio silence more than she liked to admit. She had been Sherlock's caretaker for three of his cycles now, and she was
John shook his head, solemn. "Not as much, no. Less running about. More attention paid to your bodily needs, please. And you'll be seeing this place... a lot more."
In this AU, we're going to forget about the fact that Sherlock was an avid smoker, because that would literally not make any sense.
"John!" The medical student turned reluctantly to face him, temporarily ending his conversation with the blonde who'd sidled up behind them. "I'm not sure I like this."
The detective's only response is to allow his knees to give way - Lestrade lurches forward and catches him before his head can slam into the floor, before slowly lowering him down and moving him into the recovery position. John, bewildered, can barely move - he just stands there, staring, feet glued to the concrete. Sherlock's eyes flutter wearily, skin pale and sweaty. The DI finally pulls out what he was storing in his pocket, and John just frowns at the high sugar juice carton.
"Uh... He's got, meningitis... I think it came on last night –" John frowned. "Wait, why are you asking me?"
He sat down in the chair, eyes wide. He felt as if his chest was collapsing. His throat was numb and he brought a stray hand up to check if it was still connected to his jaw. John met his gaze. He breathed noisily, hunched slightly over his knees.
The doctor asked and, at the shake of Sherlock's head, relayed the message. "He used to have a BiPAP for this time of year when he was younger, because the cold caused so many flare ups. I don't exactly recall when he got rid of it..."
It did little to stop the detective, however. He stubbornly continued to pursue cases, despite Scotland Yard's pleas that he return to Baker Street and rest; he spent the majority of his waking hours scurrying about the flat, flinging his hands aloft nonsensically and making a downright mess; and, if anything, he must have eaten
Johns eyes widen, and he almost drops his tea. The china scrapes unceremoniously on the edge of the table as he catches it. "You've
"Uh, yeah, but I'd rather you didn't collapse on my floor while solving it," Lestrade chuckles, running his fingers through the detective's silky hair. "Want me to call John?"
He hadn't done what he wanted to do. Hadn't proved himself yet. Might not ever get the chance, now, to be a somebody.
The suspicion increased in volume when Sherlock returned from a case stiff and bone-weary one evening. John had been working monotonously at the clinic for the past week, attempting to earn some wages in order to pull his economic weight in the flat, and had been paying little attention to Sherlock between shifts. That Friday, as the night grew an eclectic blue, the detective stumbled through the doorway with a wince, falling onto the sofa with a stubbornness exceeding his mental capacity. The older man had observed as the younger massaged small circles into his neck and lower back, groaning like an individual of greater age than the athletic soul he was. He had even offered to help, and was surprised by the hesitation before Sherlock's dismissal. It was rare for the man to even consider such trivial medical help.
She stepped forward, placing an arm on the car as if to reach out to him from across it. "It was my pleasure Sherlock, honestly." Her eyes shone prettily with unshed tears, and the younger Holmes tore his gaze away.
"What about last night?" John felt bad for drilling him – he could feel the heat radiating from Sherlock's hand through his pyjama pants. "How did you feel last night?"
Sherlock heard John shuffle off, stomp up the stairs, and shut himself in his room. There was a shifting of what could only be cables, and a faint click that the detective labelled as the opening of a laptop. John was now occupied. Good.
"Is it a migraine?" he asks, and Sherlock grunts in reply. "You worked yourself too hard again, didn't you? I said not to come out when you have a migraine."
The disease had spread to his joints, causing a severe arthritis in his hips and knees, and when the doctor attempted to sit him upright, he appeared to be suffering with pain in his back also. He resolved to leave the man where he was, worrying his lip as he covered him with a thicker blanket. When he returned to his bedside with a hot broth, Holmes had no appetite for it, and so Watson set it aside and spent the rest of the morning sitting beside him, reading aloud.
Knowing the detective would want to be back in 221B as soon as possible, he called for a car and, with some effort, helped an incredibly woozy Sherlock into the back seat. Sherlock was so exhausted, in fact, that he leant his head against his older brother's shoulder and began snoring softly, much to Mycroft's disgust.
Merely two months later, the detective's battle with breathing restricted him from his beloved chasing of criminals, and, in order to shelter himself from the still frozen air, he resolved to remain contained inside 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock, John, Lestrade and Donavan all turned too late to see the bathroom door fall shut, the wood crashing into the frame and causing them all to jump. They had wandered in there to examine some evidence - a victim had been found in a disabled public loo outside ASDA, just over two days ago, and they had intended to reevaluate the scene. Lestrade sighed, walking over. "Nothing to worry about, it's just the wind."
"Is it?" Sherlock spat back sarcastically, letting his head fall back onto the sofa. John rolled his eyes.
"Yeah, yeah, alright. Try not to get on Anderson's nerves." The DI points beyond the police tape to an empty but ordinary looking house. Sherlock ducks under the tape, ignoring a small wave of vertigo as he does so.
"The paints from today," someone says behind the police tape, and John turns to see Anderson. "I already took a sample back. And the body-"
"Thank Christ for what?" he asked curiously as this mysterious man began fumbling with his keys. Stark blue eyes met his, alight with mirth, and John marvelled at how perfect he looked, especially after a week like Fresher's. His own mirror this morning had shown him eye-bags and a five o'clock shadow, and he suddenly felt self-conscious.
As Watson had initially with Holmes' persistent drug use, he withheld himself from protesting, wary once again of crossing the man – even if his conscience did, as before, consistently reproach him for his lack of courage. But the confrontation could not be delayed indefinitely, and as the detective's cough reached its fourth week of harassment, the doctor could no longer supress his natural urge to attend.
"My chest, and back..." John frowned, surprised by Sherlock's leniency. "I think I should see someone."
"I'm not going through it again." Her voice suddenly took on a sharp edge. "I'm not. Because Sherlock isn't going to die."
They heard the shower creak on, the steady stream of water creating an almost soothing undertone, and after listening for another uneventful thirty seconds, made their way back to the kitchen to clean up the tea they'd left all over the table and floor.
John wasn't family – technically, he was barely a friend – and so he sat huddled in the waiting room, a tepid coffee held loosely between his fingers. He'd been here since they'd rushed his friend in for a lumbar puncture, had dutifully taken the ciprofloxacin they'd given him, and had remained in the same position until way past breakfast back at the castle. At this moment in time, they'd be administering an intense course of antibiotics in an attempt to combat the bacteria multiplying in Sherlock's bloodstream. He felt sick.
The evening before the fateful crash, Sherlock had his hands pressed into his eyes sockets, his lips adopting a greyish hue and his forehead beaded with sweat. John had Rosie curled on one shoulder, and rocked her back and forth as he watched his best friend clearly struggle with some kind of physical ailment. Eventually, the detective looked up, eyes creased with pain and hands trembling minutely.
Sherlock's movements are much less lethargic as he shift his position against the wall. "I know John, but the work-"
"I've got a tutorial," he growled harshly, making for the door. "Wishing you a speedy recovery, mate."
After a painstaking five minutes, Sherlock's finished the carton, and he seems a little more lucid. Blinking, he looks around him, eyes finally clashing with John's. The doctor's gaze is a cross between worry and anger, and Sherlock isn't looking forward to the conversation that's going to precede this untimely event.
"We'll check with the thermometer once we're back in the lounge." They both got out of the bath, slipping on the tiles and dripping all over the floor. "You think you can stand?"
"Absolutely," he muttered, reaching for the mug. He had barely raised it to his lips when it slid out of his hand and stained the carpet. Shaking, he folded himself over and groaned. "Oh God..."
"Shh," John soothed as Sherlock opened his eyes blearily and coughed, groaning as he retched, bringing up nothing but the water he'd drunk. John helped him sit up so he wouldn't choke, and left him that way while he went to empty the basin. When he returned, his flat mate sat shaking, bile staining his shirt and trousers.
"With all due respect," Molly said, feeling her hands begin to shake, "I've been present throughout the majority of his treatment. I've gone with him to his intravenous treatments, I've made sure he took his pills at the right time; and I've seen, first-hand, how much Sherlock has struggled. You haven't seen how difficult this has been for him – how awful chemotherapy truly is."
He stopped kissing him, which was unacceptable to every single cell in Sherlock's body, so he pulled him again, but John put his perfect small hand on his lips and whispered again between shallow breaths.
Everyone turned to look, and were faced by a horrifying scene. Outside, the deranged bandaged man was…. Floating? No, it couldn't be! And yet, he looked as if he was flying in the dark under the heavy rain. It was only a second, but he passed by outside behind the glass, and peering from under his huge cape was Lidiya's head. Her skin was bluish and her eyes were wide open, pale, and empty. She was clearly dead.
John sobered as he watch Sherlock leave, then took notice of Anderson staring at him suspiciously. He turned his head quickly and started getting rid of the used supplies.
"Take your clothes off" John whispered in his ear as his hand reached inside Sherlock's pajama bottoms. Sherlock moaned softly at the feeling.
"Okay." He cleared his throat "Looks good" he said finishing up with the bandage and turning around to get the shot.
"It smells nicer here, and you've got ginger nuts" Sherlock says, as he pops said biscuit in his mouth, John only now notices the bag in his other hand.
"If the attacker came from outside, he would have had muddy or at least wet feet. He would have dragged something inside with him… a leaf… anything. But the floor is clean."
He raised his eyes tentatively, only to find John beaming, eyes twinkling, giving Sherlock that look that always made his stomach flip and his blood dance, a look of pure reverence, and suddenly he was not afraid anymore.
"Hey there, lovely" John crocked weakly, opening two puffy eyes, looking at Sherlock, and smiling as if he'd just had a long Sunday afternoon nap.
John huffed a laughter as he filled some information in Sherlock's file "Nice try. No hypos on the floor"
John's mind was still racing. He was thinking of everything Sherlock had said. It was silly and childish of him, but all he could think of was the fact that he had only been a pawn in his scheme after all.
He unlocks his door and gets inside, only to come face-to-face with a long figure sitting in his sofa in the dark, holding his pen light and one of his medical textbooks. John flinches, his heart jumping wildly before he realizes it's Sherlock.
A couple of hours later Sherlock and john went down to meet everyone and have dinner. Three men and two women, excluding Bill, sat at the huge dining table, which was already set.
"Okay, Sherlock" John interrupts. He cannot discuss this, not now, and perhaps not ever. "It was nice to see you again, Dr. Sholto, but we must be going now."
Greg's face turned and he grinned the moment he saw Sherlock. He did not even flinch at the fact that someone had materialized out of nowhere in his hospital room.
"Maybe you should …" Sherlock trailed off as John opened the third door "knock first…" he finished lamely watching John back off a third time.
To which Dimmock's annoyed reply was to nip it in the bud or "don't cash your paycheck." When he saw John coming he looked annoyed and gave him a tight smile.
"Listen" Greg broke the silence "He gave these gits the greatest gift in the universe. You think He didn't give it to us too?"
John's heart skipped a beat. It was silly, the man was just confused and didn’t mean anything by it.
The translucent eyes bore into John, making him feel exposed, but he could not help trusting the stranger. He couldn’t explain why it felt like the man had been waiting for him there, as if this was meant to happen, and the words came out of their own accord.
"You know, for someone who's married to their work, you sure spend an awful lot of time in my flat" John cannot conceal the bitterness from his voice, but Sherlock doesn't seem to notice anything.
John glared at him. Something was definitely not right. And he was going to get to the bottom of it tonight.
Sherlock blinked a few times before he could think properly. Oh, right, an abusive parent plus a younger more vulnerable sibling. Makes sense. He caught himself still staring at John, now dangerously close, breaths almost mingling. He could smell the faintest hint of soap, coffee, and gun powder. A scent just as paradoxical as its owner. Fascinating, but dangerous. Sherlock turned abruptly and moved outside into the living room, feeling John following behind him.
John didn't say anything, he just smiled and started working on Sherlock's button and zipper with one hand, and with the other he took Sherlock’s own hand and started mouthing at his long fingers.
"Bloody hell, Sherlock. If you're trying to kill me just feed me something out of your fridge, that'd be quicker than trying to give me a heart attack, you git." He says as he flicks the light on.
He looked into John's blue eyes, drinking them in, thanking whatever deity out there that allowed him to have him. A whole new perspective and fresh appreciation of his John overwhelmed him since he saw that axe aimed at his head. He constantly fought the urge to put his head on John's shoulder or hold his hand and take his pulse just to make sure he was alive and really there.
Luckily, John seemed to understand. He moved closer, and just like that, their lips were pressed together. Sherlock wondered how his legs still managed to hold his weight as he melted into the kiss. He had kissed people before, but always for a purpose, for a case. He was never kissed like this before. He felt cherished as John's fingers played with his hair and his other hand cupped his jaw tenderly.
He rang the bell to 221B, but when the door opened, it wasn't a grumpy pale face with eyes like supernovas, but rather an old woman in a purple night gown looking suspiciously at him.
Sherlock started moaning again and stroked himself a bit harder. Greg felt John move on the bed near them, and he heard the unmistakable slurping sounds of kissing.
"Watson" he answered, still clenching and unclenching his hand, trying to stop the shiver, but as soon as he heard the following few sentences on the other end of the phone call he was wide awake, on his feet trying to locate his trousers.
"We're going to wake Mrs. Hudson." He pants as Sherlock leaves open-mouthed kisses along his jaw. "She'll come out and find us like this."
Sherlock opened his eyes, a strange mixture of weakness and exuberance making him feel dazed. John smiled affectionately.
"Patrick and Jennifer Wilson. They were the second couple. Married a little over a year too" he said in a strained voice.
That night, John kissed him. It was strange, unexpected, and utterly glorious. They were watching crap telly after dinner. John was quietly giggling each time Sherlock made a comment on the stupid television show that was on, and Sherlock felt victorious every time he did.
"This is so unfair, you know. You just throw on one of your suits and look like a bloody super model, meanwhile I look like my uncle Horace in his church suit."
The door was wide open, crime scene tape, technicians, crackling sounds of radio, and the smell of death…
Sherlock climbed on top of the warm body, hungrily seeking more kisses. John welcomed him in his arms and took his lips in his mouth again. It felt like John's hands were everywhere, caressing Sherlock's back, teasing his neck and nipples, stroking his stomach, brushing by his public hair, and kneading at his arse. He writhed helplessly on top of John, trying to coordinate their movements, but they were both too frantic and hungry for each other to slow down.
Sherlock simply rolled his eyes at him, ignoring the confession completely, and went on to deliver deductions to a love-sick mesmerized John, who looked like he was about to snog him right there.
He feels the familiar twist in the depth of his belly that John is always responsible for, his heart working at maximum capacity, and his hands scrambling to touch him everywhere… anywhere.
Sherlock remained silent, waiting for the melodramatic opening speech to be over so that Greg would cut to the chase.
"Why so rude, brother mine?" Mycroft said as he let himself in and sat in the chair across from Sherlock. "And here I was thinking you'd be in a good mood, given the recent… developments." He obnoxiously over-uttered every syllable in the last word with a creepy smile.
With every button set free, new territories were revealing themselves for John's mouth to explore, and when the shirt was completely open, he slid it slowly off Sherlock's shoulders, and left it hanging loosely on his thin arms. He wrapped two strong arms around Sherlock's waist and buried his nose in his armpits inhaling deeply and groaning with each exhale. His mouth glided, leaving open mouthed kissed on Sherlock's flat chest until it wrapped itself around Sherlock's right nipple, suckling gently and still holding the warm body in place as Sherlock squirmed beneath him.
"Hey, that wasn't just me" He giggled, actually giggled! God, how the hell did this turn into flirtation so quickly?
It was dark, and the immediate sensory input was of a warm body in his arms and another looming over his head. He felt his arms unconsciously wrap themselves tighter around Sherlock as he blinked repeatedly in the dark, feeling cold metal against his temple.
"So, this is the great Sherlock Holmes we've been reading about in your blog, huh?" Bill said as he shook Sherlock's hand enthusiastically.
Soon, Sherlock’s trousers were hanging open on his narrow hips. John pushed them open and tugged a bit at the black designer pants so that Sherlock's flushed cock sprang free.
Sherlock looked at Lestrade who was breathing steadily through his nose, and placed a palm on his chest. A shudder went through the man, then he sighed and closed his eyes.
But Mike was looking at the wounds on his face and fingers. Much like John, he was first and foremost a healer and a care-taker.
He leaned slowly and pressed a kiss to his forehead, and Sherlock suddenly went tense, seemingly realizing what John was about to do, but there was not time to do anything. It was already too late.
Then, John felt rather than saw Sherlock move closer. He realized what was going to happen one moment before their lips collided.
The trip back to London was quite. John seemed distracted and lost in his own thoughts, and Sherlock was just happy to have him away from that dreadful place.
Lidiya, however, was nowhere to be found. Max came downstairs with wet hair and said he had been in the shower and couldn't hear anyone coming in.
"Do you know you have a habit of randomly materializing everywhere?" John said as he came closer, and Sherlock gave him that soft and infuriatingly gorgeous smile.
"And don't forget you are not allowed to whine while we're here. We came to have a fun Halloween." John added as he took a turn between the dense trees.
"Oh. She seemed to think we're… I'm… your boyfriend or something." He let out a nervous laugh. Sherlock remained silent and extracted one of the files from the box. He sat in a black chair by the fireplace and started skimming through the pages.
Sherlock did not think it could get any better, but smart, beautiful John could make everything better. He reached a hand and wrapped it around both of them.
Sherlock bent down to inspect the two bodies, and John stood mesmerized for a moment before he remembered he was supposed to be having a conversation with the man.
"Take a seat," John said pointing at the examination table. Sherlock walked slowly and sat, still staring at John.
John’s cum tasted like heaven, and Greg heard himself moan loudly as he licked wider strips of skin, lapping greedily to get every drop.
On one hand he couldn't risk revealing that snogging a prisoner had resulted in said prisoner nicking his keys, on the other, he didn't want Sherlock to be thrown in solitary confinement. He was in enough trouble as it was.
Sherlock doesn't know what to say so he doesn't say anything. He keeps his face closed and musters every bit of control he has to keep himself from running away from this conversation. He feels foolish.
"Yes, you're right of course." Sherlock says, making sure his voice is as even and as neutral as can be "Let's end this now. The sooner the better, so you can get back with your previous… ex-lover."
"What… no, I'm a… friend… colleague" he hastily corrected, though he wasn't sure either word was accurate.
"I'm sure" John laughed as he turned to catch Sherlock's lips with his mouth. They kissed softly at first, lips fitting together like pieces of a puzzle. Sherlock slowly moved to lie half-on top of John, careful not to put any pressure on his left side.
When they reached the visitation hall, they were in for a surprise as a huge figure appeared, blocking their way.
"Stop bossing me around. I never wanted to come in the first place." Sherlock said. He really hadn't wanted to come, but for one thing he couldn't say no to John and his stupid handsome face, and he also didn't want to be away from him for an entirety of three days.
"Their families do. It's very lucrative if you think about it. Inmates would do just about anything to get their hands on some drugs here, and so more and more of them had been spending what little savings they had on the outside, or asking their families for money, or simply doing the mafia's bidding, no questions asked."
Suddenly John was moving back and away. He quickly peeled off his jumper, revealing golden planes of delectable torso. Sherlock stared, too scared to blink lest he misses any detail. John took off his trousers and pants too. Under his belly button, a trail of blonde hair led to a nest where a very flushed cock was bobbing between two strong thighs. Sherlock heard himself moan again, and he swallowed when he saw a clear bead appearing on the tip of the delicious thing.
John hung up the phone, taking a few seconds for himself before returning to the room. Sherlock was leant lopsided against the doorframe, inhaler limp in hand. "I don't... need... a BiPAP."
It took him a while, but he found the bar. Pulling out a handful of cash, he ordered five jaeger bombs – but by the time he'd turned around to share them, John had disappeared into the crowd.
Sherlock had come to Mycroft's office to exchange some repetitive quips concerning brotherly matters such as the younger's knighthood and the older's attendance to a play with mummy. There was absolutely no way Sherlock was going to witness 'Wicked' or anything else as obviously evil, and he didn't care if Mycroft had the Korean elections to worry about, this was simply more important.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, refraining from wincing at the way it aggravates his headache. "Of course you are, I wouldn't expect any more from Scotland Yard."
So, I'm sorry if there are any mistakes, I did some research on medications and all the symptoms etc. but I know it's not quite the same as describing it from first hand experience. Feel free to correct me - I'd actually really appreciate it - and, just one disclaimer, as I've had comments before: THE ENGLISH TEMPERATURE SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE AMERICAN ONE. DO NOT PANIC THEY ARE NOT IN AN ICE AGE.
Over the coming weeks, John would notice that Sherlock could become lost on a case, weakly grasping onto a runaway train of thought one too many times and blinking in frustration in the moments in between. He
It then he had looked up at his brother with watery eyes. "I haven't had tea yet," he said, curling his hands into fists. "You didn't let me finish!"
"Here," John said as he placed the tea on the table, intentionally nudging it so it sloshed over the sides. Sherlock greened, and the doctor sighed. "Sherlock."
"I –" Sherlock laid still, mouth moving urgently as he sought an explanation for this lapse in judgement. But there was none. "I... don't know." His friend laughed humourlessly, chair scraping horridly against the cheap white floor. He swiped a set of books from the table by the bed, shoving them angrily into his bag, one of the pages ripping in the process.
It was a simple statement, but it snapped John out of his trance. He cleared his throat, nodding. "How so?"
"A medical student. Indeed," he clarified, marching quickly to the nearest table as he spoke. Once they were both situated across from each other, Sherlock placed his hands beneath his chin. "You're more intelligent than the average person, I can tell just by speaking to you. You agreed with my sentiments on Fresher's Week, which tells me you did not find the menial activities performed during that time at all interesting. Perhaps you are more acclimatised to a small social life – lots of studying, minimal procrastination – so, you took some demanding A-levels, such as Chemistry, and Biology, both renowned for their difficulty. Your nails are short – you've kept them so for practicals, and you eat a well-balanced meal, which suggests you are aware of your own health. Your bedside manner thus far has been impeccable – most with intent to pursue the medical career path have a kindness about them, I'm not sure why, but those who don't tend to struggle. And," he breathed quickly, finally pointing to John's rucksack, "
"We'll test it again in another few minutes," he says, digging in his pockets once more. "A juice carton won't be enough though." He directs his next question to the small gathering of officers behind the yellow tape. "Has anyone got anything sugary on them?"
Mycroft was finishing off some menial homework in his room at around seven when he heard it. Sherlock had usually worn himself out by this time and would be softly sleeping in bed, but as the elder Holmes' hand glided over the quadratic functions, he heard a snuffle, and then an almost
the rug - "Breathe, sweetheart," she had whispered like a mantra next to Sherlock's ear, stroking his dark mop of hair.
Immediately after, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson became, on some level, friends. They soon discovered that they shared two lectures a week together, and John found himself banging on Sherlock's door on both occasions so that they wouldn't be late. As it turned out, Sherlock Holmes was quite disorganised, and despite his genius, was often found running into vital seminars half-an-hour late, and with one shoe on. In-between lectures, the two spent their first week in the library, studying and chatting about their home lives, until Saturday soon approached, and they came to an important decision – that they must act like normal university students, and go out on the town.
Sherlock shook his head again, but this time it was more desperate. Molly set the water down on the rug just as he brought two shaking hands up to cover his face – and then, to her absolute horror, he began to cry.
Sherlock is diagnosed with epilepsy as a young child. This chapter is an insight into Sherlock and Mycrofts relationship as brothers, both present day and growing up.
"He will." Both men turned to stare at Molly, who blushed colourfully. "I – I mean, I know he will. I'll –"
Save for the coughing. It grew worse; became so debilitating, in fact, that the very violence of it fatigued Holmes. To his own vexation, he spent an inordinate amount of time dozing, only to be woken again by the terrible bacteria harboured within. With Mrs Hudson's assistance, Holmes' silk pillows had been replaced twice, and all three of his handkerchiefs succeeded by newer, cleaner ones.
A five-year timestamp. He'd be twenty-seven. It evoked, distantly, the thought that he'd be joining a club – a morbidly famous club – but that he was unlikely to be remembered that way. Or remembered at all. What right did Sherlock Holmes, unknown to all but a select few at Scotland Yard, have to share a list with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain, respected members of a cultural phenomenon?
The suspicion began when John caught Sherlock staring at a wall for several hours. This was not unusual - the detective often glared pointlessly at a wall for lack of better things to do; or he would simply appear to be watching a wall as he sank into the depths of his mind palace. There was something particular about this moment however, and that was because for a large part of the time he spent vacant, he was also smacking his lips, over and over again.
He supposed it might upset his dear old dad, if he ever were to find out, that Sherlock might also be taken by the same disease.
"Well, I don't suppose you remember much." The detective looked puzzled, and so John took that as a yes. "You weren't making a lot of sense. Oh - I should warn you, I think Lestrade filmed you on his phone."
"Sherlock?" There isn't a response, only a slight shudder, but before he can say anything else, Lestrade is next to him. The DI remains calm, one hand frozen in his pocket - his concern only flickers slightly in his gaze.
"How many of you in there?" A paramedic asked while someone got to work on the lock. There was clicking and scraping against metal, and Greg flinched at the sound.
Sherlock was hardly able to hold himself upright. He was pale and withered, bracing himself on toilet seat as he leant down, panting harshly. He didn't seem to have noticed Greg, head so he low he was practically in the basin, and flinched once when Molly reached over and began rubbing circles on his back.
"It's been my pleasure." Dr. Wilson stood and spread his arms. "I'll see you in a month, Mr. Holmes, and then every three months after that. Let's keep you cancer-free for as long as possible, shall we?"
John jumped, almost spilling his drink down himself. Mycroft Holmes raised an eyebrow from the door. "How –"
It isn't that Sherlock hadn't listened to him- he'd done everything the good doctor said, taking his pills, drinking lots of water and salt replacement solutions and swallowing some toast here and there. He'd even slept willingly, and sometimes without John telling him to. But the work, and the rushing about, and the
"Of course I was right," Sherlock forced out, snapping his lips shut immediately in order to ensure that words were the only things he spewed. John raised his eyebrows, wandering into the kitchen to make some tea. While boiling the kettle, he quickly identified the nearest basin, and while the detective was occupied with controlling the nausea, subtly nudged it closer to the couch.
"I'm not even going to reply to that." And he turned back to the microscope, brow furrowed, attempting in vain to identify some pancreatic enzyme active sites.
Sherlock's AEDs worked effectively for the majority of his youth, and his epilepsy became a part of him he could quietly manage with little upheaval. But despite his protests, any time his brother was home he would follow him into his bedroom, always there to speak gently to him when he came round, and provide painkillers for the headache that ensued. Despite the angry glares he would often shoot his senior, he was secretly grateful for the company when he woke up stiff and disorientated. And sometimes, although he was too stubborn to admit it, he did need that extra help getting into bed.
