feels different, now. He feels ready.
But, honestly, that was the least of Dean's problems right now. He wanted to get back to a place that he could brood over the almost-kiss without the sharp reminder that he had a beard in the form of coarse hair itching at his neck. So, he let his shoulders slump and nodded mulishly as Castiel led him out of the room and towards the table Sam had set up a little research station at.
“Hey,” Charlie protests, “I never said—”
For his own self-preservation, Castiel has stopped attempting to discern whether it’s
Pushing himself up off the log with his palms, Castiel belatedly realized that Gabriel had been talking the whole time. Gabriel rolled his eyes up at him, waving dismissively at Castiel’s apologetic smile.
(if Mr. Roper was a half-angel kid and “upstairs” were a lot more figurative).
The showdown with Chuck ended almost anticlimactically, thanks to Cas. With the chaos siblings neutralized, Jack up in Heaven, and Cas presumably dead, Dean was left alone with Sam. Left to slide behind the wheel of Baby and drive back to the Bunker like life was just supposed to keep trudging on. Like he wasn’t breathless with exhaustion, sorrow, and fear.
As Sam and Dean reached the barrier, guns already in hand, the distant rumbling—the one that had definitely not been thunder—grew louder.
Gabriel adds emphatically, ignoring him, “They
Dean exhales, guilt flooding his system. He takes one last look out the window before abandoning it (and the still-empty parking lot) for the night. Shirking his clothes, Dean leaves them behind in a trail as he crawls into bed. “Put the stupid book away,” he barks before nipping at Cas’ ear. “And turn out the light. We got better ways to deal with stress than talkin’ about it.”
“Some of the tasks I gave you were gross,” Castiel noted. “Stripping and washing all of our soiled linens, cleaning the toys we used by hand. I can’t imagine you enjoyed that.”
Dean has to clear his throat, and in an unprecedented move, Castiel exchanges the razor in his hand for the orange juice, cracking the lid and offering Dean a sip before they begin. Licking the sweetness off of his lips, Dean nods and says, “Impala.”
and Castiel disappears into the bathroom with his duffle.

The mummies turned away from Ryan, and obediently shuffled back through the gap. Ryan hurriedly shoved the cabinet across the opening and stumbled back to where Izzy was standing, staring at Sam with wide eyes.
He rocks a little in his chair, balances the beer on the arm and drags a finger through the condensation as he stares out over the mountains.
Dean didn't know how to say what he needed to say, so he pulled out the ring box and held it out, watching Sam's eyes bulge. "Here."

Castiel had gone through the notes Sam had made many times, and knew most of them by heart. His head started to pound as he looked at the words. He rubbed his hand across his eyes, deciding to take a short break. He turned to look at Dean and saw him with his eyes glossy and unblinking, glued to the page he was reading.
“You think this is where his records might be?”
The derisive snort that erupted from Sam was very loud. “Maybe I wasn’t there for that conversation, but I was there for the rest of the decade. Something is going on, and whatever it is, it's not what you think it is.”
“I just don’t understand why—”
It’s Dean’s turn to freeze—pulling back just enough to look his friend in the eye. “A couple?” Castiel looks at him like he’s the biggest idiot on the planet, and fair enough. “Okay,” Dean says with a shrug. “Now I don’t have to worry ‘bout who’s going to change my sheets once quarantine is over.”
Sam’s mom, much as anyone is.
Sam’s barking is completely focused in that direction now, hyper and nervous, and he’s lingering way too far away from the car for Dean’s liking. Dean himself has only made it just over halfway there, not nearly far or fast enough. Worried that Sam is getting
From the drawer below the sink, Castiel pulls out a clean plug, lubing and inserting it before stepping into a fresh pair of pajama pants. No need to ruin the surprise. Or, the mystique, anyway—with Dean’s current condition, there’s pretty much only one reasonable way to go about all this, and Castiel is positive Dean already knows that.
Spritzing a little of the cologne he’s noticed that Dean tends to sniff on his skin with heightened interest, Castiel jams his feet back into his duty boots (because Dean loves those, too, but also they’re already dirty from work so a strip club floor probably won’t make them worse). He laces them up tight and then strides out into the living room like he hasn’t the faintest clue why Dean’s jaw nearly hits the floor.
“Sorry, Uncle Cas,” Claire pants as Castiel wraps an arm around each girl.
—>Dissociation: it becomes very clear that this is what Dean is doing to avoid experiencing and coping with this abuse. This is discussed during his sessions with Cas, as is the fact that what Dean is experiencing is definitely assault/rape, even if Dean is reluctant to define it that way.
Standing to the left of the scene, out by the curb, Benny’s waving wildly, trying to get Dean's attention. His eyes find him just as Benny’s voice comes over Dean’s radio. “To your left, cher.”
“Fuck you, Sam.”
“He will be,” Cas agreed with a small smile. “I’m going to stay with him, regardless. He asked me to.”
“See something you like,
Tanha’s eyes light on his wings again, and the way she’s suddenly looking at Jack raises Castiel’s hackles. “Who did you say you were again?” she asks.
for either of them to have to leave after a scene without extended aftercare. While it doesn’t happen often (and the few times it has, they’ve kept in close contact and everything has been fine), Castiel still worries and he makes no secret of it. “Promise me,” he says, eventually.
“Shitty things in your past made you who you are today, brought you here. What happened to you is fucked up beyond the telling, but I gotta say, Cas. When I see your scars, I feel—” It’s abrupt and it surprises Castiel when Dean growls a little and shifts suddenly, slipping an arm underneath him to wrap around his chest and pull.

At least Cas is willing to keep working through the movies in relative alphabetical order. Dean’s got a system, even if it means he’ll be waiting another year to watch
Castiel wakes up before his alarm, wide awake and staring into the fuzzy dark as his cock throbs inside his soft cotton pants. Irritated, Castiel ignores it, except to mutter, “I am not a slave to you,” beneath lifted covers.
Moving over to the shelf displaying all of Dean’s knicknacks, Castiel runs fingers over the (just as he thought) brand-new versions of all the Shield books. “I think you’re going to have to connect these dots for me, Dean,” he admits. “You’re clearly a fan, rabid enough that the majority of your tattoos relate to Jensen’s journey and yet, these books appear to be untouched, as if you’ve never even opened them.” He turns to regard Dean curiously, one hand still wrapped around the first book in the series’ elegant binding. “Not that I blame you, I suppose. I suspect these are actually very expensive first editions, so perhaps you keep your own well-loved copies out in the library itself.”
The space in front of the truck where the magical barrier shimmered seemed to
In response, Dean’s hands tighten on Castiel’s hips.

“I finished mine last night,” Dean says airily. “Gonna hit the library after class to polish off the biblio—wanna come?”
“This is a misunderstanding,” Castiel tells his cop, his voice even. “I assure you—”
As much as Crowley is the bad guy in nearly every story he’s been in, for this one—Castiel has to admit—he wound up the hero. If it weren’t for the demon director, Castiel might not ever have gathered the nerve to speak meaningfully (“restock the roller items” and “the women’s bathroom needs cleaning,” notwithstanding) to Dean again, never mind try to repair their damaged friendship. Thankfully, Crowley’s determination to turn the things

“I know,” Sam says quietly. “Cas, I’m really glad you’re okay, man.”
The five of them—Dean, Cas, Sam, Ro, and Gabe—stood at the top of the steps, looking down over the room.
There is no doubt in Castiel’s mind that Dean is trying to be good.
But then, maybe two weeks into the new routine—just as Castiel is beginning to have his doubts about his own idea—something changes. Castiel happens to be meeting with the set designer regarding one of their biggest moving pieces (so his attention is pretty securely engaged) but the event still catches his eye.
“Well, I suppose that would depend on which street corner and what you’re doing there, sunshine,” Dean replies easily, punctuating his abrupt return to being a flirty brat with a wink. If Castiel didn’t find him so fascinating, Dean’s mood swings would likely give him a headache.
“Bloody hell,” Crowley muttered, rolling his eyes. “That is
with him—and has been for over a decade.
“It’s done, Cas,” Dean says with a shrug. It—like all of his motions and gestures and usual mannerisms—is smaller, quieter, subdued. He might barely be speaking, but to Castiel, Dean’s never been so loud.

Dean doesn’t reply, but his hand drops to thread fingers in between Castiel’s, squeezing in contemplative understanding. Castiel swallows, taking a second to compose himself before letting go, as Chuck calls the set-up cues for the next number.

love and driving desperation to protect Dean at all costs has become his greatest weakness, clouding his ability to make the difficult battlefield decisions he was once so very good at executing.
“Fine, stand if you want. Your brains will roast inside your skull but clearly you’re not using them for anything anyway. This is firefighting 101,” Dean yells from his crouch on the other side of the blaze. “Two hundred degrees near the floor means up to
As suspected, Sam and Claire had done a solid job of holding off the undead, but they were definitely starting to swarm. The rest of the group had to drop their loads in the entryway to the precinct and take them to the truck a few at a time, Dean and Donna ending up joining the fight while Cas and Jody ran back and forth loading up supplies. Claire and Cas ended up climbing into the back of the truck just as Jody hit the gas to move it down the street to the supermarket, leaving Dean to grab Baby and navigate in between (and over) the body parts left in her wake. One thing was for sure, Dean had a whole new level of respect for the Sheriff; Jody was a fucking
Chitaqua: The Next Generation (meh) has its headquarters on the main drag, centrally located to nearly everything New Washington has to offer. Save for the fields, which are naturally on the outskirts of town. The building that houses the mayor, meeting rooms, and various other municipal leadership offices is straight across the way, and Castiel’s relatively sure that’s no accident.
Eeeyyy!” Dean hollered, clapping and cheering. “Not bad, Cas! Not bad at all. I mean, you didn’t hit the Pepsi, you hit the Coke, but hell, it’s fine. No one else knows the difference between them either.”
Castiel looked up from their joined hands, his heart doing somersaults and slamming against his chest. He felt a bit numb in the face, yet warm. What were his emotions doing?
Wrinkling his nose sharply, Sam made a disgusted noise. “You realize that means it was
“It’s the end of the world, Dean,” Castiel replied, a simultaneously dull and yet razor-sharp edge to his voice that Sam couldn’t remember ever hearing come from him before, especially not directed at Dean. “I hardly think anyone will miss a handful of lightbulbs.”
“Spain?”
“Cas, if he can do this from
That was, until Dean flicked on the light in their cabin that was powered by a generator, and Castiel’s cot was empty. On the bedside table—a bucket they’d turned upside down between their cots—the glass of water was empty, but the handgun was missing. On the cot was the torn up trenchcoat still, thrown haphazardly in the corner like it’d been flung, and the man that was supposed to be lay on it was missing.
“Shit, Dean,” Castiel gasped out against sweaty skin, the rare curse just pushing Dean further toward the edge. “Oh, oh—
“Like it thought better of it?”
Jack bobbed his head easily, perhaps sensing that Dean didn't want to talk about it. "Alright, so what do we need to do to start?"
Before he can continue, Dean’s stalking forward, and despite the alpha bristling in his chest, Castiel shrinks back, not entirely sure that he isn’t going to be hit. Except—as Dean enters his personal space, Castiel suddenly realizes he has it all wrong. Dean doesn’t smell upset at
enough for both of them. At the very least, Dean hasn’t given him any reason to think he doesn’t feel the same. More importantly, Dean seems to be benefiting from their arrangement in the same way Castiel is—he’s happier, healthier (mentally, at least—internally, Castiel’s fairly certain Dean’s arteries are filled with bacon), and at the end of the day, that’s what matters most.
Dean barely listens to Cas hashing out details, leaning into the “quiet submissive” role so that he doesn’t have to answer friendly but stupid questions about how he’s feeling or whatever. Being a sub is definitely convenient that way, sometimes—especially here. No one thinks twice about a collared Dean standing docily behind his Dom, looking down at his feet and using his free hand to fiddle with the buttons on Cas’ trench coat, the one he’s currently got on.
Dad to Sam wasn’t enough, Dean had to be everything else, too. Plumber, electrician, mechanic. He had to do it
“What are you, seven?”
,” Dean powered on, talking over Sam, resting his hand on his stomach as it churned. “Someone is coming to rescue that pip-squeak downstairs, and they’ll take me, too, by the sounds of it. What do we do?”
“This is bullshit,” Dean blurted out.
“What are you waiting for?” he asks quietly.
When Cas lifts their joined hands (Cas’ left, Dean’s right) up between their chests to press a kiss to Dean’s knuckles, the metal of Castiel’s brand new ring flashes under the light of an overhead sconce. Dean’s ring is safely at home—he has particular feelings about his collar filling that role, especially in

Dean’s stony face softens slightly. “That’s probably the most convincing argument you could have given me,” he says. “Never good when a mob boss
night.
“The window is still open,” Dean says, in what he hopes is a reassuring and confident voice, though like hell if that matches what he feels. “If we find something in a week, or two weeks, it can reverse the spread. I can still fix this, Lis.”
“Then I guess we better get this show on the road.”
Clearing his throat and shaking his head, Sam tries his best to casually change the subject, though he’s pretty sure he does a crap job of disguising his secret interest. “So… out of pure morbid curiosity, which movie is this one from?” So sue him, Sam likes the classics, and he can’t remember a scene where hot, muscled men training half-naked shows up in either Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty.
Or maybe he just forgot how fucking

There’s no door, either. Dean knew that as soon as Bobby mentioned it. It’s either not there or covered by rubble, either way, it’s of no use to him. He’ll just have to find another way, and if he can’t go around, then
Back in the parking lot, Dean hesitates next to Baby, flipping her keys over in his hand. Sensing awkwardness, Castiel points across the way to his cottage. “That’s me,” he says, “With the motorcycle parked in front. You can always—just knock if you need anything. Or want to visit.” Castiel attempts a flirty smile, but it feels unfamiliar and strange on his face. He sighs. “Anything, Dean, really. If you’re awake tomorrow morning, I usually have breakfast around seven. I’d love to share it with you.”

Tomorrow, Dean will call Claire, ask her to bring her crew to the Bunker so that they can offer it up. Tomorrow, he and Cas will head into town.

Of course, because he was Dean Winchester, king of shit luck, that was not how it went at all.
Dean tells himself. “Wait—what?”
The thought of Castiel rejecting him takes care of that issue like gangbusters, and by the time he’s knocking on Cas’ door, Dean’s not entirely sure he could get it up if he wanted to. His nerves are flying back to hit him full force, heart pounding away in his chest. Is Cas going to open the door dressed head-to-toe in leather and carrying a whip? Is he going to yank Dean through the door, shove him to his knees and piss down his throat?
A few more drawn-out internal strokes and Dean is tensing up all around him, and just like last night, that’s enough to drag Castiel’s last ounce of self-control from his grasp. While Dean cries out and grabs a handful of Castiel’s hair, Castiel himself is burying his face in Dean’s chest, second dildo forgotten and slipping out as he buries himself deep, shaking and finishing with a thrust against Dean’s body that is anything but gentle.
“When Zachariah sent you to twenty-fourteen,” Castiel finishes, still holding Dean’s wrist. “You remember. I mean—it happened here. Uh—where...when...is here?”
“You know, when you withhold dangerous spells from Dean, it’s polite to let the much cooler, way more level-headed brother who is also your best friend in on the good stuff.”
Blinking into a whole lot of greyish-black nothing above their heads, Castiel just swallows and pats Dean’s shoulder again, aiming for reassuring and likely missing by a mile. “I think—I think it would be just fine if you stayed the night,” is what he opts to say.
flame of hope inside Dean’s chest. Before either of them can say anything further, though, there’s a knock at the door and it opens.
“You boys about ready to call it a night or did you want to get naked right here on the bar?”
“Alright,” Dean announces, clapping his hands together as Ash hauls another pallet in through the doorway and throws it on top of the fire. The blast of oxygen from outside fuels the flames and makes them surge like a wave, licking up the wall and onto the ceiling. “Search and rescue drill—hand to foot chain, clear the second floor. There are at least two victims. Go!”
Ryan and Izzy stared at her for a moment, then shared a glance. Izzy said, “I’m gonna take them down there.”
likes Christmas. I'll be Santa for him and give him my present," Dean said, waggling his eyebrows and hip-thrusting the air.
the job, never mind the fact that he was willing to raise his voice to Castiel to get it. Sam’s aggressive insistence that he needed to bring Dean home to their apartment to look after his brother himself raised Castiel’s hackles and resulted in him making a comment or two about the inappropriateness of that scenario when
Cas had ever appeared in any of my pre-sleep fantasies, I’m pretty sure it would have killed me.”
Tonight, his begrudging bi-annual hosting obligation has been particularly successful, which is both relieving and annoying. Opening his stately, brick-front colonial home in Pentagon City always seems popular amongst his co-workers, not that Castiel has the faintest idea of why. Perhaps it’s simply his stature and the power he wields, or maybe it’s the way he’s extremely open about hiring both a party planner and caterer for such things. It’s not as if

Not the voice of Chuck Shurley, oh, no. He’d heard that only minutes before—minutes? Had it really been only minutes since the world began to end?—and that had been… ordinary. Human.
“I dunno why you brought me here,” Dean starts as he turns on his heel. A cloud of dirt puffs up by his ankles as he does, and Cas’ face drops, his disappointment obvious as he anticipates Dean’s rejection. “But Cas, I think you should know—I can fix this.”

Humming the bridge of “Enter Sandman” to himself as he turns, Dean happily obliges. His rhythm is obliterated just as soon as he opens the door to the club itself, though, with the first notes of Madonna’s “Like a Prayer,” assaulting Dean’s ears and making him cringe. That’s one gay icon he just can’t get behind—give him some Elton, some Freddy Mercury, hell, he’ll even take Cher—Madonna just doesn’t do it for Dean.
“Do you require assistance?”
“So, you’re telling me no one else is injured?” Dean said pointedly.

Misunderstanding what Castiel wants, Dean lets himself be pulled, parting his lips like he’s anticipating a kiss. “You don’t listen very well,” Castiel remarks, tipping Dean’s head to the side so that he can better visualize the bruise around his eye.

“Oh, c’mon, seriously?”
“Hey Siri, what’s good?” Victor calls out, and everyone laughs. Alicia laughs a little too hard.
Castiel can only imagine that the furrow in his brow is getting deeper as he stares back at Meg in abject confusion. “You’ll have to explain this further to me at some point, because I certainly wasn’t aware that I had romantic feelings for Dean until very recently,” he says, and then drains his glass because this is a

Finally, she lifts her head and nods. “You understand what you’re giving up here? Your job, your career? The prison records which badge opens which door, you know. They have Dean Winchester exiting the prison on security cameras after swiping your ID card. The police are already on their way, they’ll want to speak to you. I assume you have a cover story?”
” Castiel repeats, as their lips part.
“We have established that the remainder of them are in the bunker,” Cas said, staring at the items. “The first blade is under my bed, and the colt is…”
When Castiel straightens up, Dean doesn’t even pretend to move, just stays splayed out provocatively on the countertop with his pants dangling off of one ankle. His neck is bent at a strange angle so that he can lean against the mirror, his shirt is rucked to high heaven, and he’s breathing like he just ran a marathon, sweat sheen covering every inch of visible skin.
“I thought,” Castiel continues, as he steps out into what appears to be a little foyer. “That you might appreciate being able to come and go from here freely. It’s a small thing, I know, but I couldn’t think of what else to offer that might help you feel more in control.”
cobweb should ever be.”
He settles in Dean’s lap, muscular thighs heavy over Dean’s own, knees pressed tight against Dean’s hips. His well-toned chest looms teasingly close to where Dean’s mouth is watering to taste it, barely resisting closing his mouth around a nipple as Cas leans over to pick up a small box from the side table before sitting back on his heels. It’s not a fancy or decorative thing, just cardboard and tape, about the size of a matchbox.
“Before college, I’m assuming. It’s not like he’s had a real relationship we can compare to since he met Castiel,” Charlie points out.
“DEAN!?”
Begrudgingly, Dean nods. He

Swallowing heavily, Dean tries not to panic, but it ain’t easy. This chick is pulling out all the stops from the jump—she’s wearing a skimpy black bikini, a white see-through coverup that barely grazes her shoulders, and stilettos. She’s busty, she’s curvy in all the right places, and her hair falls in long, soft waves down over her chest. Those tresses are held back by sunglasses that she pushes up off of her face with a knowing smirk.
Sam is nodding, opening his mouth to presumably thank Bobby, but they’re interrupted by Jo bursting back into the room from wherever she’s been, breathless. “Cas,” she says. “The restaurant is calling the cops.”
“What are you playing at, Dean?” Castiel growls.
he thinks, reaching over to flip the glove box open.
“Well, Dean, you are the one who taught me to lie,” Castiel responded with a small grin.
“Dean, don’t!”
In his darkest days, Dean always assumed he’d die in Manhattan. Best case scenario, he’d kick it of old age or maybe loneliness in his own bed in that same house in Washington Square. More likely, though, he’d slip up somewhere, somehow, and a Darkseeker would take him out.
contact, at least once.
He understood that falling from grace was probably pretty traumatizing, but it wasn’t Dean’s fault. Sure, he’d convinced Cas to make a bunch of poor decisions that turned him away from Heaven, and on more than one occasion ordered him to fix things with a snap of his angelic fingers, and he’d been the one to piss off God, but it wasn’t his…
“Witch,” Castiel corrects absently.
He would have left work earlier, would have run to Dean’s side (as Castiel is perpetually wont to do). The thing is, ever since Naomi showed up at their place, Castiel has
Two of them had been severely injured; they'd need the provisions to get through. She thought, with a small smirk curling on her stiffened lips, that this was possibly far too easy.
He blinks and looks around, realizing abruptly that it’s already well into the afternoon. Castiel’s been parked here, at the top of the stone steps leading up to the convention center nearly since the event opened its doors this morning. It’s the perfect place to watch as various customers and artists wander in and out, and to keep an eye out for Balthazar. There’s no sign of him, though, and Castiel has to admit, he’s getting bored just sitting here quietly as the day wears on. Part of him regrets not asking Gabriel along today, though Gabriel would just tell him to
Over the next half hour, Sam and Eileen fill Dean in on how
of course, but really, Castiel’s found the best thing to do with such a diverse portfolio is thus: hire hundreds of people who are smarter than he is, give them the tools and the resources to do what they do best, and stay out of the way. As he’s come to realize, sometimes it’s best to simply let his money talk and to keep within his lane. He tends to focus his efforts on doing just that, which is what he’s been up to today—signing authorizations and such, reviewing various project proposals, and ensuring his monthly charitable donations are being directed properly to where they can do the most good.

The silk slowly slithered from around Castiel’s neck before being tossed aside, off the bed. It slipped down to the floor, and Dean’s eyes followed it for a moment, taking in the way it curled against the stark concrete floor of his simple, Men of Letters dorm. Dean would never, in a hundred years of Hell, have thought that a tie against worn mid-century flooring would give him a boner, but he also always assumed he’d be able to

is Jack? Why is he ignoring Castiel’s (and presumably Sam’s) pleas? It’s so unlike him, and now Castiel has to split his worry between Dean and his surrogate son. Although, admittedly, Jack is slightly better equipped than Dean is to deal with whatever threat he might inadvertently come up against.
“I—is there a reason I should?”

less than fifteen minutes ago. Dead, and Dean brought him back to life in the most perverted form of a first kiss that’s ever existed. The thought is so ridiculous that Dean barks a hysterical little laugh, earning himself an eyebrow raise from the medic as he takes Castiel’s blood pressure and a squint from Cas himself.
The heels of Dean’s too-big dress shoes click on the tile as he follows Garth down the hall, Alfie steady at his side. He swallows, passing the infirmary and waving to Tessa for the last time. “Bye Dean! Good luck,” she calls after him, like she didn’t recently subject him to his least favorite swab exam

The other inmates have formed a natural little ring that boxes them in, and Dean and Crowley begin to rotate around it, eyeing each other up. The members of their respective crews are interspersed at the edges, but no one interferes. That’s encouraging—it was the only thing Cas couldn’t help Dean predict, how
“Dean!” John snaps.
before continuing on. “And, of course, there will be cameramen floating around, but it’s their job to be subtle. Just ignore them. So,” she says coyly, jabbing her elbow into Dean’s, forced-friendly. “Anyone…catch your eye yet?”
“Guarantee they tricked him, Cas,” Dean fumes, cheeks red and fists clenched into the fabric of the thin blanket draped across his lap. “Just like they tricked me. Oh, be an errand boy, Alfie. You’ll gain the boss’ trust, Alfie. You’ll move up quick, Alfie. Just do what they say and before you know it, you’ll be rolling in money and power, Alfie. We’ve all done it, Alfie, you won’t work the streets forever, Alfie. And then—and then before he fucking knows it, he’s in
to really sit with all of the pain, the loss, the worry, the
He decides not to overthink it—he’ll trust Cas, stay in the moment, and worry about anything else later.
“Shit,” he swears, glancing into the rearview mirror in time to see Ben bawling into Hunter's scruffy little neck. This is a nightmare; a living, breathing nightmare, and it’s all Dean’s fault. The
“I like your hands,” Castiel admits, not even sure why
“Sam,” Victor replies calmly. “I know that you hoped your brother would go home today, and Dean, I’m sure there’s nothing on the planet you want more. But you both have to understand, today is not about the strength of the case being presented. The warrant will hold up—you’re going before the judge that signed it, and arguing the facts of the case during arraignment will only piss her off. Dean, you’re a recently-paroled convict accused of murdering a police officer. Boys, I could be Johnny Cochran himself and bail would
Sam clearly doesn’t harbor any of the same nostalgic sentiment for what used to be. Even as the car rocks and does its best to toss him off, Sam clings tightly enough to bring his fist down on the glass of the windshield, weakening and shattering it from the outside. Desperate, drunk, and a quarter second away from losing his nerve, Dean spots an old street lamp built into the city-end of the pier and heads straight for it. Closing his eyes and sending up a silent apology to Sam (
“Penthouse, right?” Sam says smugly in his ear, and now that he’s listening, Dean can make out the vague sound of a keyboard clacking away in the background. “Hold on tight.”
“Still in the wind,” Castiel tells him, and the regret in his voice isn’t remotely manufactured.
The fear remains; hot, molten and angry in his stomach. It comes up several times, when Dean least expects it—once into the biohazard trash can in the corner of Cas’ room and once all over the “tranquility garden” that decorates the area between the parking structure and the entrance to the main hospital.
“You did it, Dean,” Castiel said as Dean approached the reindeer in front of Baby’s hood, moving over to where Sam—chunkier and moosier than the sleek reindeer—waited, joining Dean there. “You saved Christmas.”
” Dean replies meaningfully, a cheeky smile creeping across his face. “What? That I love you? That I’m
The trophies suddenly seem impressive. Boast-worthy, even.
Whatever semi-relaxed and humbled state Claire had previously appeared to have fallen into reverses immediately. “A
“Yes,” Cas agreed. “Someone usually needs something of us, don’t they? I suppose those are the workplace hazards of running a camp—”
He nods in approval. “Not going to argue with you there. And I know that you have no interest in being a Knight, once you’re free of the Bay. But to my point—
For a moment Dean was frozen, but then he nodded, his entire countenance seeming to slump a little. “Yeah, man,” he half-whispered. “Of course.”

“Didn’t you eat earlier?”
“Yes,” he tells him. “Your participation was satisfactory. We’ll resume at the same time on Monday. We’ll be meeting twice weekly for as long as I deem necessary.”
Just as they’re really finding a rhythm, there’s an odd sound—like a chime—that goes off from a couple of feet away, somewhere near the middle of the room.
“Shit,” he huffs as he swipes the back of his hand across his eyes. “I’m a mess.”

the current EMS Chief, Zachariah. Dude is a prick, and he’s always fucking with Cas, and—wait, what was he doing? Oh right.
“I don’t think that’s the best idea,” Balthazar said, looking around quickly. There was no response to Gabriel’s challenge. “Come on. We should keep moving.”
And Balthazar wasn’t a
here, prying into Dean’s
“I would never judge you,” Castiel interrupts. “And my comments weren’t about that. I simply said, in front of
As he headed away towards the cabin, Sam caught up with him. “Hey Dean, hold up.”
Dean’s cheeks seem to go even redder as he stumbles over his words, distracting himself by taking the food from Castiel. “Fantasi—I didn’t—”
With a shrug, Castiel takes another gulp of the remaining coffee before passing it over to Dean. It’s cold and could use a refill, but Castiel senses Dean needs something to do with his hands more than he needs a drink. “I think it’s fine to feel however you do right now. Our dynamic has changed, it makes sense that your feelings towards me and being in my space may have shifted as well. There’s nothing wrong with that, but we should talk about it. The last thing I want is for this to impact our friendship, Dean. Losing what we already had because of missteps around sex and submission, that would be...” Castiel trails off and shakes his head. “Unforgivable. Meaning, I would never forgive myself.”
But giving up wasn’t something Dean ever considered for himself, and now he’s got a state-of-the-art lab equivalent to what the US government used to provide him underneath his own home. Ensuring that even if he
Anael sighed and waved him off, slouching back against the wall, ignoring Dean’s look of annoyance at her constant fidgeting. “Stop fretting about the grace, Castiel,” she murmured. “It would’ve happened eventually. I didn’t have enough grace left to even remove the bullet. If it didn’t happen today, it would’ve happened tomorrow for something probably substantially more stupid.”
“Jody, cricoid pressure,” Sam instructs and Jody’s hand disappears as she complies. She leans down to put pressure on the cartilage rings in Dean’s throat to make it easier for Sam to slide a tube between his vocal cords. Sam doesn’t compress the ventilation bag he’s holding, just lets the high-flow O2 do its thing, since Dean is still breathing on his own. While he’s not practiced working in a bumpy, swaying ambulance like this, the procedure is still something Sam has clearly done hundreds of times, and Castiel is
True to form, Charlie picks up on something wrong right away, and Castiel finds himself spilling his guts about everything that’s happened thus far with Dean. From the weird moment when they met on the highway, to the easy conversation and subsequent make-out sessions, to Castiel’s rapidly changing and increasingly confusing feelings for the man..
has on from last night. A quick whiff under his arm has him recoiling, and he sent Dean to the only bathroom his apartment has to offer. With a sigh, he heads into his bedroom and raps on the bathroom door. “Quickly, Dean,” he calls out, not sticking around to try and decipher Dean’s muffled reply.
“Hey there!” The man greets him cheerfully, the outside corners of his eyes crinkling as he smiles. He’s gripping what appears to be a work-order in his hand, squinting down at it before gesturing towards Castiel’s SUV. “Castiel Novak, right?” He looks up almost expectantly, and perhaps Castiel is imagining things, but it almost seems as if there’s something
does that. Climaxing at the same time is for porn flicks and romance novels, but—here Cas is, slipping out of him like that’s what the fuck happened here.
Dean’s felt in a very long time. This isn’t just
Instead, he takes off at speed for the “L” building where it’s sandwiched between two others, nice and long, providing a decent amount of cover. Castiel pulls up alongside it and thanks his lucky stars (and whoever
When Dean reaches the second-floor landing, he hears it. Several thumps and the sound of scratching above his head. There are infected on the roof; it’s only a matter of time until they rip their way in. “
For every breakthrough, there’s a setback, often two or more. But sometimes, Cas’ steps forward are more like leaps, and they give Dean hope that they
“Oh. Oh, you’re gonna spell it out,” Dean replies, nodding insistently. “And then we’re gonna find this bitch—
Castiel gave a small laugh. “It’s okay. Not your fault. I’m just really glad you’re going to be okay.”
he’s so fuckin’ out of shape and out of practice, he’s already sore. No way is he getting out of this without a major cramp and at least one pulled muscle.
“That’s it,” Dean says, voice firm and unwavering. “That’s it, got it? We’re not gonna do this anymore. Go live your life, Sammy. Get yourself a girl—or a dude, I don’t judge—get the hell out of hunting and buy yourself a picket fence in the suburbs. Take your kids on vacation to the beach, go back to law school, hell, do
he wasn’t the only one feeling. In front of him, Castiel just stared back thoughtfully, contemplating the angles of Dean’s face, the curve of his mouth. He smirked at the hitch of Dean’s breath in his chest when he pressed a thumb and forefinger near-bruisingly on either side of Dean’s chin.
Castiel lasts two hours of alternately signing papers, reviewing meeting minutes, and staring dreamily out his windows before he throws in the towel. He emails Zachariah to finish up the duties he’s decided to shirk, and heads back downstairs to check his phone and see what Dean is up to this morning. Leaving his phone behind was intentional—at this point, Castiel has accepted that the man is a distraction he simply doesn’t have the willpower to turn down.
of this life, but Dean is still his brother and he deserves to know. Taking a deep breath, Castiel fills him in plainly and succinctly, including the unfortunate news about Jack also being M.I.A. He can tell that Sam is upset, but he seems to shift into hunter-mode just as quickly as Castiel did.
Dean blinks up at him with wide, glossy eyes, seemingly not even feeling the way Castiel pulls the dental-floss-tie closed with what he can only describe as a nauseating sound. Another few drops of blood ooze down Dean’s flank but then the bleeding stops, right as Castiel knots the stitch at the end. Castiel may not be a medical doctor (may not even be a decent substitute for a poorly-trained field medic), but he
This morning, there’s a hand wrapped firmly around Castiel’s cock, slick from more than pre-cum. Which means that Dean took the time to locate
job of holding him at bay. Castiel takes the opportunity to slip outside and breathe in some fresh air. The wind whips roughly at his face as soon as he walks out onto the balcony, and while it’s probably around seventy degrees on the ground, it’s much cooler up here. Castiel pulls his designer suit jacket more tightly around his waist and turns his face up to the sun.
now. They get along well, and that’s a relief. It’s more than Castiel dared to hope for.
because reasons. Castiel makes a mental note to not be surprised when Dean also wakes up tomorrow with minty-fresh breath just to spite him.
“We shouldn’t have pried,” Jo choked out. “We shouldn’t have—”
That was the reasoning that pushed him to offer himself up to Dean to begin with, to overlook the threat of having his feelings exposed for
Sam looks so fervent, so desperate for Dean’s absolution, that Dean can’t help but give it to him. It’s what he’s always done for Sam, and it feels kind of right that they’re getting back to their roots on Sam’s wedding day. Anyway, so what if Sam got lost? No one’s perfect, least of all
One step up from the kind of clothes shopping Charlie drags him along to do every few months (a.k.a. Dean playing the part of the gay bff in uncomfortable chairs while Charlie blasts “Walking On Sunshine” from her phone and pretends she’s in a makeover montage from the 80’s), but barely. At least here, there’s champagne, and Dean manages to down four flutes before Cas gently takes away the fifth and pinches his flank in silent warning. Dean’s tipsy brain digs it.

Of all the various wild and horrific things Castiel expected might happen as a result of Dean’s suicidal plan to storm Lucifer’s asylum, coming face-to-face with God wasn’t one of them. It happened shortly after Dean died, which, though Castiel
Castiel will wait. He can be patient.
and Castiel can’t help but smile back. “Man, it’s good to see you, sunshine. Gonna yell at me?”
Regardless, death should be welcome, for Castiel. If both he and Dean are dead, then he’ll see Dean again, one way or another. Even if he has to slaughter the entirety of Heaven’s armies to do so. Castiel just isn’t looking forward to the lecture he’s going to get for not making it out of the building in time, and thus, leaving Dean to his own irreversible demise. With any luck, Paradise will make Dean less of a condescending asshole, but Castiel’s not holding his breath.
As Dean gawks, his fellow castmates start disembarking somewhere behind him and to his right, but Dean doesn’t pay them any mind. At least, not until one of them speaks and he’s left without much of a choice.
The thing is, yes, Dean’s fallen asleep on Castiel tons of times, but the difference is that those moments can
“I’m so sorry,” he says between presses of lips. “I’m a mess, I—”
With his ass so full, Dean’s prostate has to be getting fairly constant stimulation, and it’s not long before Dean is completely undone beneath him, near-sobbing and clawing at Castiel’s shoulders, begging for contact, for release. Not that Castiel’s stopping him, but Dean
“As long as you don’t confess to murder or try to use these sessions to commit a crime, or become a danger to yourself or others, no. And in those circumstances, my ability to disclose anything you said would be limited to direct relevance or I could lose my license. No offense, but you aren’t worth that risk.” Castiel offers him a small smile.
“Just makin’ sure we’re clear,” Dean says with a wink. “Let’s go.”
With a map in their hands, gas in the tank of a mean-looking jeep, and each other as company, Cas and Dean had set off in search of this demon. They rode together with ease, despite the heavy conversation lurking over their shoulders. The bomb that Cas had dropped about the journey of their souls, together through existence, was kind of a big deal.
Thank you so much for reading!
Whatever other thoughts Castiel might have about that topic get siphoned out of his head as Dean’s knuckle twists and increases the pressure behind his balls. With that, Castiel’s muscles spasm and his eyes roll back in his head on the next rolls of his hips, positioned at the perfect angle to hit his prostate from the inside. All of his muscles contract and he can
is the reasoning.
—” He chokes on his own words, eyes filling with tears and spilling over as heat builds at the base of his spine. Castiel releases his hands, sliding arms beneath his shoulders and clutching Dean tight, and Dean’s quite sure he’s never felt anything like this before.
“No kissing, heavy petting, intimate touching, no masturbating or sex of any kind—assume that if there are genitals involved in any way, it’s off limits. However,” she says, with a very dramatic pause. “
"Better, I think," Carl said, staring down at the stump with a faint look of confusion, like he still hadn't grasped that a part of him was gone. That wouldn't matter if he hadn't escaped the bite; he wouldn't even register the loss or the pain. "Let's just—Can we get this over with?"
“Hang tight,” he says, juggling the laundry while simultaneously spooning some eggs and bacon onto a plate in front of Castiel. Dean winks before disappearing out the door, leaving Castiel alone, save for the eggs. Without a good reason to refrain, Castiel shrugs and tucks in, only realizing after he’s halfway through the plate and the steaming cup of coffee Dean must have poured before he came in, that he’s starving. By the time Dean reappears, Castiel’s plate is clean and he’s checking his phone, worried that his first appointment should be showing up within the next half-hour and there’s still an open wound on his face.
“Sam,” Dean croaks, his voice breaking. Gritting his teeth, Dean rips the knife from his leg and doesn’t even bother to try and muffle his own pained scream. Sam whimpers next to him, distressed that Dean is hurt, even in his own increasingly dire state. What did Dean ever do to deserve someone so loyal?
Charlie opens the side door to the ambulance and Dean climbs in, Ben’s positioning in his arms preventing him at first from seeing the paramedic who is occupying the back. Whoever it is must be setting up their gear, preparing for the worst while the EMT went and retrieved their patient.

“As I recall, an acquaintance of mine, Eucridicles, was working on a metal submersible not long before the island sank. He may have used it himself to escape, but if he was killed during the quakes and no one else knew about it…” Balthazar threw open the door to a large building. “Yes! It’s here!”

“Listen,” Dean tries, unable to believe that he’s giving this dude he has budding feelings for advice on how to date other people, even for one measly dinner. “Just have fun. I swear, I’m not holding it against you. Am I jealous? Fuck yeah. That bitch looks like she wants to peel your skin off and wear it around like a blanket. If she offers you lotion, just know it’s a trap. Also, To Serve Man is a cookbook.”
“That’s playing dirty,” Castiel mutters. “Fine, here’s the deal. In the name of new beginnings, I will make the incredibly generous assumption that the number was no more than ten—just this once. Tap if that’s amenable.”
“Still cold,” Dean declares triumphantly as he swishes his fingers in the bottle’s wake, eventually plunging his entire hand in to fish something else out.
Dean shook his head to get rid of his thoughts and smiled nervously at him, scratching his neck. “Yeah, I’m fine, just have too much on my mind, and it’s bad timing for all of it. Sorry for running out like that. Uh, have you guys decided what you’re going to do about the keys?”

When they arrived back at the room last night, there was some kind of drama going down with the girls. Despite the loud crying and shoe-throwing, they’d managed to avoid being pulled in, and Dean still isn’t entirely sure what the whole thing was about. He would have asked Charlie, but she was buried under several layers of bed covers by the time he sought her out. Brushing teeth side-by-side and exchanging shy smiles with Cas while their castmates screamed at each other in the adjacent room was a kind of weird Dean hopes to never experience again, but on the other hand, he’s nothing except grateful it wasn’t
It’s demoralizing, humiliating, all those good things. Dean gets that, it’s just…he thought Cas would get
This is the most risky part, as Dean will have to contend with the other members of his housing unit—either electing to let them in on his plan, or hope that no one feels like hanging out in the common area. In Castiel’s opinion, if this plan is going to go wrong, that is where it will happen.
Still smirking, Dean drags the sleeve of his maroon flannel up his right forearm, inches from where Castiel’s fingers were wrapped. Branded into the skin just below his elbow is an angry red mark that Castiel recognizes on sight. There are so many questions to ask, but he can also appreciate how little any of the answers matter.
. Castiel’s actual daily ranking depends on what exactly his portfolio is doing and whether Michael Bloomberg’s investments are up or down at the moment, but his standing is pretty solid. Perhaps he’d be higher on the list, but his donations to charity are in the billions themselves. It is just, as Castiel has learned,
Sam nodded, his brows knitting together worriedly. “He said that if he ‘bites it, all of existence bites it’. He, uh, said that in the bunker when he gave us the gun. So...can we really go about killing God?”
ravaged.
Nodding, Balthazar took Gabriel’s wrist and flew them southwest where they appeared in the middle of a huge open space paved in red, black, and white stone. Beside them was a defunct fountain with a statue in the middle depicting two men and a woman, naked and posed suggestively, each holding a pitcher from which water would have flowed, were it working.

But Cas had bigger dreams than that, and Dean should have known not to underestimate him.
It’s the mimicry of human civilization that’s most fascinating to him—it proves what angelkind has always assumed, every since Lucifer Fell, going on to create the Lilith and the other early demons to keep him company. Hell is the sheer
On the way to the station, Dean falls fast asleep, drool on his shoulder and all. Having shucked his bunker jacket, he curls up in Cas’ hoodie, which unfortunately now smells a lot more like smoke and his sweat and a lot less like Cas. It’s a knockout sort of nap and Dean only wakes because the backup alarm of the engine finding its place in the fire bay blasts discourteously in his ear. As he blinks sleepily and wipes wetness from the corner of his mouth, Dean hears Benny’s familiar “Ho!” to Victor as he spots his park job from behind the truck. He feels the air brakes engage before the engine finally stops and goes silent, and they’re home.

far off base and completely out of line, after all. And that—
After another minute or two, Garth stands and stretches, yawning loudly as his joints pop. Dean shies away from the crack he’s been watching through, but Garth doesn’t so much as glance around. He slurps the last few drops of his coffee, grabs his magazine, and hits the lights before exiting through the secured door that leads back into the rest of the prison.
There was some leftover Chinese food in takeout containers that Dean knew held his favorites. Beef and Broccoli, Shrimp Lo Mein, and an egg roll. Those things didn’t sound particularly appetizing in his head, but Dean shook that off and pulled them out anyway. He was
“Hey,” Dean says, stepping forward and brushing ungloved fingers over the shell of Cas’ ear, because fuck if he’s touching that gown he didn’t take off—Cas seems frazzled, who the fuck knows where that thing’s been? “Since when do we not help each other? I didn’t know you were having a bad night, you didn’t say anything.”
In that moment, Dean’s vision of the future feels more real than it ever has before.
And it’s stifling their therapy sessions.
Dean throws his head back and laughs.
“I wish,” Sam muttered, stepping into the bunker, clicking off the safety of his gun.
That'd been all he shared with Cas. He’d told him Zachariah had dragged him into three days of Lucifer apocalypse, where Sam had said yes, and Dean had said no. He'd selectively left out the part where Castiel had been a shell, where he'd been broken. Where he’d been a depressed human with nothing left except a substance abuse problem, and where the only thing he fought for was the next thing to fill that empty hole inside him.

Instead of acting like an adult, he gulps the thirty-five dollar glass of whiskey in front of him like a two dollar shot and pulls the remote free from his pocket. The club is dark but relatively airy and cool, not overly sticky or hot or smelly. Castiel’s glad for that as he tries his best to melt back into the shadows at the side of the bar, hoping none of

He hurries away, but then— “Hey, Cas!”
and the word
And look, Dean wasn't a fashionista by any means, okay? Give him some plaid, jeans that fit his ass snugly, and he was golden. But he was used to endless options to pick up and put down before getting what he inevitably got anyway. Such was the way of anyone who went shopping for clothes. Yet, clothes for bigger guys? Yeah, that was a fuckin' joke, and he could just
Despite that, Castiel can hear Eileen’s gasp and Sam’s quiet, “whoa” perfectly well as he pauses, silhouette framed and backlit by the mouth of the tunnel.
Dean gripped harder and smiled.
Dean doesn’t care about that—he isn’t remotely afraid to stand by Cas’ side, however messy this is going to get. He’ll be at every rehab session, he’ll fucking go to nursing school if he goddamn has to. Learn to work a feeding tube and a Hoyer lift and crush meds and whatever else. Cas doesn’t need to walk, doesn’t need to be able to feed himself or wipe his ass or put on his own pants and tie his shoes for Dean to love him.
Dean makes his way down the concrete steps leading up to his parking level and out the structure’s door. He keeps his eyes peeled—for any journalists or reporters taking too keen an interest in
Jack nods. “I did that,” he says proudly, and then seems to think better of it when they all continue gaping at him silently, his wide smile faltering. “Well, Fatback did. I called on him to help! Oh, and the bird—the Yellow Warbler—I sent her to Cas so that he wouldn’t lose hope.” Jack looks around expectantly at the three other men framing the table, as if that jumble of words is supposed to mean something to anyone else besides him.
Castiel puts Medic Two responding as Charlie gets them back out on the road, flipping on their lights and sirens and putting the pedal to the floor. Over text message, Jody and Castiel decide to request two other ambulances from the county to come and assist. There’s always a possibility they won’t need them, but it’s always better to have too many hands and send them home than to have too many patients and not enough help.
Dean did forget. He’s been so long without personal electronic devices, it’s no longer second nature to reach for his phone every five seconds, the way he used to do. The roar of Cas’ motorcycle starts up and then fades into the background as he drives away, and Dean swipes open his screen.
When the reaction isn’t instantaneous, a threatening rumble builds in the back of Sam’s throat, but Dean holds up a hand, knowing that it’s just a matter of time. Like clockwork, the monitors start to beep and alarm.
Still, sure as hell looks like sleeping in the same bed is fully on the “green means go” activities menu here at the Retreat, so who is Dean to pass that up? He scoots over and shoots Castiel a sunny smile. “Guess not, since everybody else is doing it. And by that I mean, get the fuck in here, sunshine.”
tree is decorated and set in one corner, and Jon Bon Jovi is singing “Please Come Home for Christmas” via the jukebox. There’s a quiet buzz of chatter mixed with the enticing smell of good fried food and beer.
“The guards?” Castiel prompts, when Dean beings to ramble on a tangent about Crowley’s fighting style that isn’t particularly useful at the moment.
“Who are you?” Dean asks when he finally finds his voice, forcing a cough when his words come out rough and harsher than he intends for them to.
Fortunately, the set changes going into the big, final number are almost nothing, and Castiel’s team carries them off without a hitch. On top of that, the ensemble is ready and waiting in the wings (no cues needed) to flood the scaffolding and boost the main cast’s voices. It’s quite the sight.
One hand tucked behind his head, Dean grins and points to where he’s dragged a hose out from the side of the building, already hooked up and leaking. There’s a half-empty bottle of washing soap dumped next to it—Castiel recognizes the thing from where it’s been gathering dust in the back of the Impala’s trunk for over a year. Not moving from the hammock, Dean bites his lip and tips his chin. “Let’s see it, Paris,” he says. “Suds her up. Work it like you’re trying to sell me cheeseburgers.”
punish you for trying to push me in that direction, and it will not be a punishment you enjoy. Understand?”
decide what happens to you, capiche?”
Admittedly, between the lack of light and the distracting nature of Cas’ presence, Dean gets caught up and forgets to warn his guest about the broken step towards the top of the flight. It’s only when Castiel huffs and stumbles, tumbling forward and out of Dean’s hands, that he remembers.
Dean gave another wonky grin. “Because that’s what we do now, huh?”
Already, Castiel seems to intuitively know just how to touch Dean’s body to light his fire. In turn, Dean is steadily learning Cas’ planes and curves, his likes and dislikes, his wants and his needs. It’s strange to so consistently feel
“Don’t,” Castiel whispered to her. A bead of sweat trickled down his face, sliding over his temple and cheek.
look.”
When Dean looks up, he’s relieved to see Cas still looking back at him so damn softly. “It’s fast,” Castiel admits. “And nothing I came here looking for or expecting to find. But being with you, getting to know you—it feels right. More than anything has for me in a very long time. I have no idea how what’s between us might translate back in the “real world,” but if things continue this way, Dean, I’d like to find out.”

Surprised, considering how into the whole thing Dean appeared, Castiel bites. He’s unable to stop himself from needling Dean in the process, though. “You’re over gay bars that welcome public orgies?”

Dean groans, rocking back into Cas’ touch, searching for more. “Sir,
Meg swallows and stares down at her plate, refusing to make eye contact with him for the first time this evening and Castiel’s guilty conscience swells in his chest. Both for what he’s definitely done to Meg and what he’s potentially been doing to Dean. Before he can apologize (not that he thinks Meg will like that, either), she continues talking.
"I'm fine, don't fuss. Just make sure that thing contains what we need and let's get out of here," she said, nodding towards the crook where Sam had put it back down on the shelf inside the shattered cabinet.
“Uh huh,” Gabriel chimes in, popping up to Castiel’s left. He taps Balthazar’s bicep and points down to suggest him into a crouch. When the other angel complies, Gabriel then slings his right arm across Balthazar’s chest so that he can grab his opposite shoulder, holding him flush to the front of his body. “Let’s solve a puzzle,” he says gleefully.
“It is,” Castiel says. “Obviously, we were hoping that wouldn’t be necessary, but we’re—”
I swear, if you mess up and I’m left with
He takes a deep breath before letting go of Castiel, stepping away and in between the dual ropes hanging from the ceiling. Letting his fingers caress the soft rope as he drops, Dean falls to his knees and folds his hands demurely into his lap. It kills him to miss Castiel’s reaction, but this is part of it, and Dean doesn’t have a choice. He lowers his head, stares at the carpeted floor in front of Castiel’s feet.
that?!), slamming the door in his wake.
Tired of pretending, tired of fighting, tired of being alone. Tired of having only Sam to lean on, of losing everyone he cared about over and over, of winning one battle only to be reminded that he could never hope to win the war. Of lying, to himself about what he wanted, to the world about the kind of man he was and the kind he wanted to be. Dean had lied so goddamn much at that point, it felt almost impossible to sort out what
Uncomfortably true, but true nonetheless, and there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it: Castiel loves a good distraction.
They tumble through the back door to the sound of sirens already filling the air, approaching swiftly.
Everyone groans and Victor looks more murderous than usual as Castiel loses it at Dean’s side, laughing so hard he turns red.
his newfound freedom on his own for a bit. Perhaps he just wants to pee without someone standing three feet away, waiting for him to finish. It could be any number of harmless, expected things. Reason aside,
Hope you enjoy this chapter! I put my heart and sole into it...
Next time: La Vie Boheme, Summer in the city, Cas and Dean heat up as the show cools down, there's a first time for everything, including "Contact".
When Sam and Eileen just exchange knowing glances, Dean throws his hands in the air in frustration before heading to the fridge and grabbing a beer. Water is definitely
In front of him, Alfie wavers, resolve dropping. His shoulders slump and tears roll freely down his face. “Yes. No, I don’t know, Dean. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know anything anymore. I’m so—I’m just lost.”
Nonetheless, it did cross Castiel’s mind—only briefly—that perhaps Claire’s professed disinterest in boys has put him

to sleep and then share a shower and greasy brunch together. Perhaps Dean would even like to watch a movie after that, before they both have to go their separate ways. After all they’ve been through this weekend, some extra cuddling and contact is certainly in order.
“I hope it does scar,” Dean says, eyes still glued to the way the marks look marring his skin. It’s beautiful, in its own right, and Dean can’t believe he thinks that. “Otherwise, you’ll have to do it over again.” He winks as Castiel looks up at him in surprise, a smile spreading across his face and—if Dean isn’t mistaken—a slight blush. He’s so stunning and perfect, fucked-out and exhausted himself, and Dean
He sighs.
He wishes he could touch—reach out and get a finger between Cas’ cheeks, maybe drag some more of those delicious noises out of him—but this thing ain’t gonna last much longer.
Gabriel squeaked beside him as his hands flew over his eyes and the ocean came crashing down on them, air bubble completely gone.
There are so many things he carries with him, so much guilt over victims and families he couldn’t save, couldn’t help, and it all just builds and builds with
Instead, Castiel forces himself to pull away, to clean them both up, to bring water and aspirin and juice for Dean to their bedside table before passing out. Even as that’s happening, Castiel finds himself blinking against his heavy eyelids, staring in awe at Dean’s peaceful face, his closed eyelids, the way he drapes himself so easily over Castiel’s chest.
“I dunno,” Dean shrugs. “Paris seems pretty cool. Everyone thinks she’s a bimbo, but dumbasses don’t become millionaires. Mark my words—that chick is playing
He furrows his brow. “No thanks,” he declares shortly, sliding the paperwork back towards Castiel using two fingers, and Sam slumps back in his chair with a groan.
Cas exchanged looks with Jody which Dean caught, but didn’t point out. It was a very ‘how are we stuck with these idiots?’ look.

“I brought you Advil and coffee,” Anna replies smugly, and suddenly, Castiel is much more interested in being a decent human being. He rolls (literally) out of the bed, leaving the covers askew as he shuffles over to the door. Cracking it less than two inches, he peers through suspiciously, unsurprised to find the Three Loud Amigos staring unapologetically back, all smiles.
“Fuck you, Gordo,” Dean says, just because he can, and because Gordon hates that nickname.

“We’ll get you help,” Castiel says shortly. “We’ll talk about this later,
“Stoplight it is. What would you do if you were gagged and unable to speak, but were unsure about proceeding?” Silently, Dean taps two fingers against Castiel’s thigh, and the action—with everything it implies—makes the hair on Castiel’s neck stand on end with his swiftly-growing excitement.
Dean chuckled and shook his head, whipping them into the pawn shop. Jack pretty much forgot about the conversation instantly in favor of hopping out of the car to buy the last of his gifts. Dean followed at a more subdued pace, pondering how exactly he was going to add onto last year's gift for Castiel.

“So let me get this straight,” he says, one finger wagging, and Castiel braces for the worst. “You thought you’d solve the problem of me not wanting to take handouts from you by handing me
“C’mon, Cas, you can come, sweetheart. I want to, too,” Dean says, before dipping down and capturing Castiel’s lips. His pace quickens as his fist moves faster, guiding Castiel’s hand and pressing them together in a way that’s so delicious Castiel couldn’t begin to form it into words.

in sound. Cheers and yelling, the kind of loud affirmation that is about as unambiguous as it gets. “Holy shit,” Dean breathes, looking around and taking in all the relieved, happy faces, genuinely stunned by all the support.
“Mogul,” is the objective word for it, Castiel supposes, and it’s true (not just in his own mind), though Castiel greatly prefers other descriptors. Engineer, for instance. Industrial designer. Technology entrepreneur. Philanthropist. His “C.E.O.” title at Novak Corp isn’t entirely encompassing either—at least, it’s not the whole story.
Once again, Dean struggles not to stare as Castiel sinks down, his thighs filling out his own boxer-briefs in the most ridiculous way not usually seen outside men’s underwear modeling. Even worse, the way his hands brace against the edge of the tub makes his biceps and deltoids flex, the steam rising around Castiel’s body and making him seem somehow ethereal. It’s terrible, it’s the worst thing Dean’s ever seen, and he aggressively rips the foil and pops the top off of the champagne bottle to distract himself. The cork goes flying and lands somewhere out in the yard, Dean doesn’t care, he’s never retrieving it. Once he’s seated, Castiel moves to recover his wine glass from the ledge and knocks both it
The other is from the aforementioned military stockpile; a plain, long-sleeved white button-down shirt at least two sizes too big for his frame, even with the increased muscle he’s put on in recent months. Castiel strips naked before pulling it on, buttoning it up completely save for the two at the very top. The cuffs hang low, drifting slightly past the tips of Castiel’s fingers,
as a whole—Against all odds, somehow Dean and Cas have found real safety, security,
The smile melts from Dean’s face and his hands slip from Castiel’s hips as he groans. Castiel knows the feeling. “Oh, come on. Business, Cas? Really? We haven’t seen each other in three days. You sure this can’t wait?”
“It’s just a game,” he deflects. “You know Dean and I…” He trails off as the bartender sets two tall hurricane glasses filled with blue and purple swirled liquid
Nothing. Nothing happens. The Bunker is as silent and empty as ever, save for the TV show Castiel forgot to put on pause that is now mocking him with its not-nearly-as-enticing supernatural crises. With a grimace, Castiel gets to his feet, knees cracking as he straightens up. He punches the “off” button on the side of the TV more forcefully than necessary before dragging a hand over his mouth.

“Did you pretty yourself up for me, Dean?” he asks, gaze focused, voice low.
“Fuck,” Castiel swears under his breath, and then into his headset. “Chuck?”

“That’s what Claire always says when she’s not fine,” Kaia yells after him.
feel so good. Or maybe—
Initially, Cas’ reservations were understandable, even if Dean didn’t like them. Causing intentional, recreational pain while he was still taking narcotics to manage his injuries just seemed like a really terrible idea and a recipe for disaster. And Dean could even comprehend his Dom’s reluctance beyond that—his uneasiness with any kind of hardcore scening at all. After watching him suffer for so long, Castiel had difficulty accepting that
, Dean rarely passes up a chance to show off his ass (especially in lace)—
To Dean’s surprise, cameras aren’t put down, mic packs aren’t turned off to save battery, but the newly-acquainted cast members are left to their own devices for a few minutes. Dean gets the feeling that “cut” doesn’t mean what here what it might on the set for a scripted TV show. He’s reminded of Rachel’s warning to assume that he’s always being recorded. Despite that, Dean embraces the break, taking the opportunity to snag a champagne bottle and to go sit in the shade closer to the ocean.

“Hell with that, I was trying to lay him down,” Dean snarks back. Castiel laughs despite himself, reaching out blindly and finding Dean’s hand once more. “Listen, this thing is a decade in the making, cut us some slack.”
And he’d fallen. As Hester had so eloquently told him once upon a time, from the moment Castiel laid a hand on Dean in Hell, he was lost. How right she was. Time and time again, Castiel had sacrificed, had rebelled, had gone against everything he knew and given up entire

"Dean," Castiel said slowly,
As they round the corner of the building, Cas pulls a pack of gum from his pocket and pops a piece, offering Dean one too, which he accepts. As Dean chews, the cinnamon that he’s been smelling vaguely on Cas’s person suddenly makes sense.
He imagined having to fold up the trenchcoat and put it away in a box. His heart ached as he remembered the picture he'd snapped days ago, of Cas' big gummy smile and the crinkly creases at the corner of his eyes, and that dumb hat on his head…
Despite the attendant's barked instructions to leave, Cas knelt down and reached out, his fingers shaking as they slipped past the rusty bars of the cage. “Hello,” he said softly, and the pig actually grunted in response, bumping his head against Cas’ hand in greeting. They didn’t get to find out what made the pig special—or anything else for that matter—because the attendant wandered over to shoo them out, complaining all the while.
Castiel thinks. Perhaps he’ll need to scrap that trip to the beach with Claire, after all. Or at least postpone until the weekend. No harm done, he hasn’t even asked yet, although he does send off a quick text while he’s thinking about her to see where she’s sleeping tonight. Whistling a little, Castiel pokes his head out of his office to let Becky know he’s leaving before heading over to the lockbox on the wall next to the elevator.
The feeling of nervous excitement died as soon as they helped each other climb over the turnstiles, trying to avoid the creaky levers in case Tryton had been lying and zombies really did still lurk around the station. Once they passed the pay barriers and found themselves at the top of a tall, steep set of stairs and escalators, all Dean wanted to do was run away.
Squinting and bringing the paper close to his nose to read Castiel’s writing, Dean’s face scrunched up while he processed. “Romantic kink negotiation?” he asked. “What—why?”
Perhaps this transfer
. Dean’s still not convinced he isn’t dreaming.
Dean relishes every second.
“Is it really you?” Dean asks, skeptical. Castiel nods, threading fingers carefully through Dean’s bruised and sore ones, raising Dean’s right hand up to where he can see it easily. “Fuck,” Dean murmurs, letting his head drop back against the stove with a

” Dean quips and Castiel’s eyes narrow, giving Dean less than a second to register his world being turned upside down before he’s being slammed against the shower wall face-first, a hand fisted in his hair and the other squeezing the base of his cock.
Clearly, Castiel wanted him out of the way so he could set something up, but Dean’s
“You ready to see the bedroom?” he asks, with a wiggle of his eyebrows. Clearly relieved, Castiel smiles back and lets himself be pulled across the floor and up the stairs.
” Charlie reassures him. “You should have seen them at the gala. Seriously, Sam. Love is in the air, I can feel it! Also, do you want to order Thai?”
In the end, he’d like to say it’s his need to make money or his interest in getting back to work in a meaningful way that has Castiel reaching out to shake Dean’s hand over the table in a gentleman’s agreement. Truthfully, though—not that Castiel’s admitting it to anyone, but—having a reason to spend additional time at the Bunker is also an excuse to be around Dean more. And that is something Castiel is
“That’s my—” Castiel pauses, but only for a moment, trying to decide what the hell would be most effective here, what can be best used to help Dean and gain information.
Castiel sighed and pulled Dean aside by his elbow, apparently out of Rudolph’s range of hearing, or maybe it was for appearance’s sake. Honestly, Dean wasn’t even trying to keep up anymore. His head was starting to hurt and he needed more cookies. Preferably homemade. “Vixen caused the turbulence that almost sent us crashing into the Guardian Building,” Castiel told Dean and
his mouth actually watered, this time not from impending vomiting. “Holy shit,” Dean muttered as his nausea rapidly transformed into something much more familiar—
Castiel scoffed and Sam raised his eyebrows. “I hardly think it matters what we do now,” the angel replied bitterly.
He stops, though, before anything can escalate again, dropping his forehead to Cas’ sternum and exhaling slowly. Dean can feel the warmth of his own breath, can taste the salt of Cas’ skin, and it all feels
These chills have happened before, though, and he wonders.

Standing by the Gracela’s front right headlight is a person covered head-to-toe in gear. A long-sleeved mechanic’s jumpsuit that is splattered with all sorts of various paints, plus a hood, a respirator mask, and a face shield that prevents Castiel from so much as identifying even a single physical feature. Well, beyond the fact that they’re tall, with maybe an inch or two on him, and with an
“Nah,” Dean lies. “Just c’mere and let me hold you.”
“C’mon, Sam, out with it. I don’t wanna hear it, you don’t wanna say it, but if shit is going down inside my body, I guess neither of us have a choice.”

Everything comes down to the points of contact between them: the breadth of Castiel’s hand along the curve of Dean’s neck. The moist heat of Dean’s mouth, teeth scraping urgently along Castiel’s jaw before he tips his head to bring them together again. The feel of Dean’s ass, when Castiel squeezes a cheek in his hand, the way Dean’s cock feels impossibly hot, hard and silky soft as it slides against his own.
and where he’d prefer them.
way, shape, or form terrifies him beyond belief—Dean thinks Cas might be his only real shot at getting that shit back. And maybe he’s wrong. Maybe Cas is just another bureaucratic idiot, brass through and through and only out to screw Dean over.

“Wonderful,” Naomi cheers, clapping her hands together before heading back across the threshold and yelling loudly into the interior of the house. “Zach! Your son is here! Michael? Michael where are you, your brother needs help with his bags.” Neither of them answer (
“Because,” Castiel shoots back defensively. “Because purported
too, to do with what you like. I know it’s possible you’ll hate this, perhaps even hate me for suggesting it. But I couldn’t—” Castiel cuts himself off and sighs, frustrated at his inability to convey his feelings effectively.
In turn, Dean keeps his one-night-stands and infrequent hookups away from their house out of respect. Definitely not because he’s still holding out hope for the off chance that Cas will come around someday and fall in love with him back, because that would just be… crazy.
to Sam and Jack’s makeshift presentation, and Castiel suspects—from the way she’s gone starry-eyed at the younger Winchester—that it’s not out of actual interest, but extremely personal reasons that he’s not going to dwell on. Intentions aside, Eileen is sitting alone at the closest table to the board, her back ramrod straight and feet flat on the floor like the
Dean’s breathing hard when he reaches Castiel’s side. He’s grinning widely, cheeks flushed with that adrenaline high they’re all experiencing. Even Castiel isn’t immune. No matter how many productions he’s managed, Opening Night always holds a certain amount of magic, of nostalgia for Castiel. Perhaps that’s why he lets Dean step so easily into his space, touching his waist as if that’s something they already
Naturally, when things went south for Dean, waiting became a luxury he could no longer afford, so he went for it. Castiel assumed that dawdling around for such a long time and being
Tears fell.
Sadly, it’s an all-too-common situation, in Castiel’s experience. Drugs run like water here, the people selling them rarely the villains in the story, more opportunists who are as hard up and desperate as anyone else. If he had to guess, from the way Sam was shaking, he and Dean had made an attempt to detox him on their own—an attempt that failed miserably.
“And your help only includes talking about the keys, not where or what they are? That’s not very helpful,” Sam chipped in.
Sam watched the mummies as they lurched back and forth at the top of the stairs, only five of them left intact. “Actually, why can't we?”
Humming happily and watching the smoke swirl off into the inky dark as he exhales it away, Castiel sighs and leans over the railing, assessing the goings-on below. His bare wrist grazes the icy iron, and Castiel quickly jerks it back inside the blanket, stung.
“Behave, boys!” Elanor calls after them from inside as the door swings shut.
The world comes rushing back in a furious blur of flashing lights and sound, leaving Dean gasping and blinking with stinging, watering eyes. The harsh haze of a fluorescent bulb hanging directly over his head makes it impossible to force his eyes to focus on anything else.
the twist,” she confirms, as if anyone was still wondering.
For all that Dean had ever done for Sam——from bringing him back to life, to making sure he always had someone watching his back——it felt frighteningly close to being all for nothing. Because Dean was about to murder his little brother.
With a deep breath in, Dean closed his eyes and hoped Cas was fucking right about the extent of his powers. He had been sure that combining Dean’s theoretical ability to use his own magically-enhanced will with the manifesting power of the sleigh would be enough to make this happen, but Dean? Well, Dean had never exactly been a believer, and he didn’t have any experience with harnessing internal magicks, not like Sam did.
It is not enough. Dean needs sex.
“We—” she gestures between them. “We talked it over while you guys were gone, while Jack went to break you out. We’ve already made the decision, and it’s ours to make. We want to be angels, and we’re coming with you. That’s that.”
Dean’s lips are soft and his hand is gentle where it cups the side of Castiel’s face. He’s an incredible kisser, and that
“Why would we not worry about zombies?” Dean asked.
“Probies to the second floor,” Dean hollers, swirling his hand over his head like he’s rounding them up, cowboy-style. “Time to see what you’re made of.”
steal Castiel’s entire brain capacity, and only after Sam’s said his name several times does Castiel even realizes he was talking. With reluctance, he tears his eyes away from the still-closing bathroom door, redirecting his attention to the pair of tipsy lovebirds openly laughing at him.
“Gotcha!” Sam didn’t stop to turn, frantic. “Move!” he was screaming, practically throwing people aside. The truck had lined itself up at the top of the road beyond the camp and was currently steaming toward the barrier. “Cas!”
For now, he’ll enjoy the more mild weather while it lasts. A little sun would help, but beggars can’t be choosers.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Castiel says quickly, before Dean can get any more upset. Not that he wouldn’t be justified in doing so, but there’s been enough suffering to go around already. “I had...I had no business treating you the way that I did. It was selfish and very unkind. Please,” he adds, looking up at Dean mournfully as his friend’s green eyes seem to dart and land everywhere but on Castiel himself.
"Fuck… Let's go."
“I’ve got you,” Dean yelled, kicking furiously at the chest of one of the zombies crowding over Castiel in a dome, crushing its ribcage with a sickening noise as Castiel’s world came back into focus. “Come on!”
He’s spurned Dean’s advances, turning him down left and right. He has absolutely
“Tell me all about it when we’re safe,” Castiel says, once again yanking Dean to his feet, despite his groaning protest. “We need to move.”
Dean was in bad shape. Sam wasn’t a medic but he had eyes, and he could see the skittish way even Alex had reacted when he’d burst through the infirmary doors with Dean, Crowley and Castiel in close pursuit.
Back in Chicago, trapped in a highrise and surrounded on all four sides by glass and steel, the idea of a multi-day road trip sounded so much more appealing. Castiel imagined long stretches of empty road, the sun rising and setting behind purple mountains majesty and over amber waves of grain—
With a disappointed shake of his head, Castiel puts his phone down and gets into the shower. He’s resigned to the fact that Dean isn’t going to answer him tonight, but also uneasy and still wishing he would. If Dean needs space, though, Castiel will give him it. He’s already pushed the limits Dean set earlier with all of the texting, the least he can do is wait to contact Dean again until the man is ready to reciprocate.
It’s magnetic and instinctual from that point forward, Dean’s eyes rolling back in his head and his hips thrusting forward to take Castiel all the way inside. The arm he has slung around Castiel’s shoulders tightens, encouraging him on, and Castiel responds in kind.
The strangled sound Gabriel lets out as he buries his face into the crook of his elbow earns him a scowl from Castiel. “No,” he tells Dean sharply, uncapping a beer via the side of the countertop and downing half of it in one go. That action does absolute
Just with some new and improved “extras”.
“We should be safe in the bunker,” Sam said, shrugging, and looking much more awake now that Dean had shocked him into the present with accidental dick conversation. “This place is warded against nearly everything under the sun. Maybe we should just hang tight until this all blows over. December 26th, we can show our faces again.”
“Too good to be true couples counseling,” Sam corrects him, his eyebrows lifting as he passes over both the victim list and the printed-out Craigslist advertisement one of the vics had turned over to them. Even though he’s seen it before, Dean scans the ad carefully again, refreshing his memory while hoping to spark something new, to connect some of the dots that are staying frustratingly
They don’t bother with condoms. The very thought seems ridiculous now, though it did occur to them to consider protection before their first time. As far as they both know they’re clean, and even if they weren’t, would it matter? Here and now? The world’s fucking over. In the end, they each came to their own separate conclusions that it wouldn’t.
“Yes,” he encourages, thumb dragging over Dean’s lip and his own erection bumping against Dean’s side. “I would be so proud of you, taking my cock so easily, letting me bend you over the nearest surface while every eye in the room is on us. You’d be so gorgeous, just like you are now—ass cheeks pink from my hand, of course, eyes glazed over, just perfect. Perhaps I’d grab your hair—” And he does, yanking Dean’s head up in a way that jerks his body back and settles him nearly all the way onto the dildo, tilting it this way and that as if he’s really showing him off.
They move from outside to in, and Castiel is so engrossed in shopping that he doesn’t take much notice to what else is going on inside the café. It’s only when he runs out of tables and vendors to peruse, that he really takes a minute to look around. Belatedly locating his family ordering food and drinks from Michael at the counter, Castiel wanders over. He doesn’t bother with the menu, instead informing his mother that he’ll have whatever Michael thinks he’ll enjoy.
At Castiel’s request, the police dissolve their line and step back, giving him a wide berth and space to speak to the patient alone. Thanks to Donna, the flashing emergency lights on all of the vehicles get turned off, too. In Castiel’s experience, they’re a constant visual reinforcement to an agitated person that

and thankfully, Castiel doesn’t try to steer them back to the verbal negotiation portion of the evening. He does refuse to stop kissing Dean any more than he absolutely has to, which Dean likes a lot more than all the discussion. He even growls when Dean’s head gets stuck in his shirt’s hole, ultimately ripping it down the middle instead of working it off like any normal person.
It’s a loss. Dean’s close, he’s
“Alright. I’m a jerk, I get it,” Sam said, laughing. “Though for the record, you’re not helpless either. You saved Dean, right?”
“How the hell did you get out here, Frank?!” Dean yells, half-panicked as he gesticulates wildly with his rifle. “If you’re real, you better tell me
for his own discomfort or fears, here. Castiel looks down, strokes a hand over Dean’s unsettled face, the lines on his forehead carved deeper than they usually are. Maybe he’s responding to Castiel’s own movement, since by the looks of it, neither of them have so much as quirked a muscle since falling asleep. Castiel’s left ass cheek is numb, prickly with that terrible pins and needles sensation he’s prone to—yet another

“I do.” Cas tilted his head and their cheeks brushed.
“It—it’s soft,” Jack said apologetically, snatching his hand back. “I’m sorry.”
He didn’t knock on the doorframe or anything like that, deciding to take his chances and step inside, facing him head on.
Too bad Dean’s game has
There’s something in his ultra-casual tone that seems off, and if the way Cas was nostalgically saying goodbye to each of the appliances in their rented cottage this morning is any clue, he’s not
“Keys!” Charlie blurts out, holding a ring of them up and shaking for emphasis. Castiel finally lifts his head from Dean’s neck just far enough to glower at her over the edge of the blankets, and now that they’re saved, Dean hits the
“Story of my life,” he replied with a pinched smile. He could feel Castiel watching him, but he wasn’t about to be the first one to budge. He’d caused Castiel a lot of pain and Cas had subsequently made his feelings about that pretty clear over the last two days. It wasn’t as if Dean blamed him, either. Which is why it was a hell of a surprise when Castiel reached down between the stacks of cars and pulled a blanket up from wherever he’d stashed it, shaking it out and settling it around Dean’s shoulders.
Dean learns, is an all-encompassing term for not just the act but everything that comes with it, and the more they talk it to death, the more
For Castiel, he’s nearly having a religious experience—the sun might as well be shining out of Dean’s ass when he steps forward and out of a small crowd. For a moment, Castiel forgets to breathe. As soon as their eyes meet, Dean’s crinkle at the corners, and Castiel had
“The keys to Heaven and Hell. God closed both of them, which is the reason why no one stays dead for long. We need to open them again so we can have a shot at undoing everything God did.” Gabriel opened his mouth to speak, but Castiel cut him off, “It’ll be easier to understand when you get your memories back and it’ll definitely make more sense then. This spell isn’t pleasant so you should be ready for it. It’ll bring almost all of your memories back at once...and could also drive you crazy.  You may not survive. You don’t have to do it, if you don’t want, but we really need you to in order to save the world.”
Still crouched with his pants around his knees, Castiel freezes. He’s never
People are still milling around despite the late hour, though the crowd is thinner now, maybe even quieter. Dean doesn’t really pay them any mind, though—he’s focused on one thing and one thing only.
The problem for Dean (and the reason he isn’t honest), is that while Jody and the entire town
“You!” Dean gasps out, “Yours! Oh, God,
That, at least, he can take care of. That, he has control of, and he plans to exercise that control to the fullest extent.
certain she’s one of the cops from the storage facility the night before, but honestly, everything after Cas flipping on the lights is basically a blur.
Despite everything, Sam gave out a low chuckle. “I think you’re just being human, Cas.”
“Actually, my name is Lana. Welcome. However, you are not here for the reasons you may think. Over the last twelve hours, I have been observing you and learning about your behavior. It has been most insightful.”
a block-letter sign spells out where it faces the road. Raising an eyebrow, Castiel glances in either direction, confused about who might be driving past and drawn in by such an ad. The road stretches as far as the eye can see, disappearing into fields the way Castiel came and into a dense forest on the other side of the motel.
“Mmm,” he agrees. “We should rectify that tomorrow morning. Breakfast in bed, I’ll feed it to you and then ride your cock. Perhaps I’ll feed it to you while riding your cock.”
a yoga instructor to go with that body, and that’s what she was talking to Cas about.
“--they thought they’d be fine because we hadn’t seen a zombie near camp for over a day. Anyway, they said they got surrounded and that the leader, that girl, the ‘queen’ had a knife. He said she stabbed at Sarah first, downed her. I think...I think she expected them to try to save her, but they ran.”
Castiel’s mental Rolodex of currently project-less actors has already been fairly exhausted, though to be fair, many of the people he’d suggest are already in the show. Gabriel, for instance (not just a roommate but Castiel’s best friend) is playing Mark. Mark is the co-lead, a nerdy filmmaker with impeccable comedic timing who’s recently been dumped by his girlfriend-turned-lesbian. Gabriel’s going to knock the role out of the park, and he deserves someone more compelling than boring old
Dean blinked. "Huh," he said slowly. "Y'know, kid, you're a lot smarter than you give yourself credit for."
And all because Dean didn't want to play Santa for one damn night. Because he didn't like to be told what to do, or who to be. Because he was still so traumatized from Michael.
Less than an hour later, Gabriel flew back to the iron box, cage complete and ready. He slowed as he neared the plaza, popping back into real space, though remaining invisible. The courtyard he approached was teeming with ghosts, moaning and crying just beyond a foot-wide perimeter around the box, afraid to get any closer. There was no hint of movement anywhere else in the city. Satisfied, Gabriel finished his flight, landing just behind Balthazar. “BOO!” he shouted, grabbing his friend’s waist.
The knife theoretically gives Crowley a slight advantage, but Dean still parries his advance easily. He manages to smack the wrist of the hand Crowley’s holding the knife in with the side of his forearm before shoving Crowley’s opposite shoulder and sending him careening off-balance. Even more amusing, he bumbles headfirst into Benny, who simply catches him, spins him around, and sends him stumbling back into the circle.
There are demons lingering nearby, occupying the edges of alleyways or skittering across the road. Some lounge on dilapidated porches or just inside houses, faces dotting smeared windows or half-visible as they peer around light posts that don’t remotely conceal them.
Jody sniffed sharply and nodded, reaching her hand out to take it. Everyone was quiet as Jody opened the locket and no one mentioned it when her chin trembled.
That’s what his brain supplies, because his brain is an asshole, and Dean doesn’t claim it. As if he doesn’t have enough going on, enough to worry about it and process and
Castiel unlocks his door with his badge and ushers Dean inside, closing and locking it behind them. Suddenly, his little work space seems more like a sanctuary, a fortress against an unforgiving world where no one and nothing feels trustworthy or safe. The blinds are still drawn to the interior hall, but the windows to the outside world glow with the sickly yellow spotlights that permanently illuminate the yard.
“I saw it,” Castiel says, clearly worried, and Dean nods.
Cas takes a breath and rearranges his arms around Dean’s neck, settling a little. He drops his head to Dean’s shoulder like it’s
And wow, Claire certainly did a 180! I'm sure that has absolutely nothing to do with Dean or the plot at all! :-D
The turmoil of Dean’s current emotional state must be showing on his face, because Castiel knocks on the window, looking incredibly concerned. Dean waves him off. “Got it,” he tells Cain, pulling himself together. “Uh—thank you.”
Back at the motel, Dean grabs the first shower and takes an extra-long time underneath the spray, which annoys Castiel somewhat. He’s the one with the mostly-mortal body, but then again, demons don’t have Grace to clean themselves up. Feeling out what’s left of his, Castiel ultimately sighs and resists using it—who knows when he might wish he had a bit of magic to tap into in an emergency. Best to save it.
Okay, so maybe this year he was feeling particularly bitter, but he figured he was allowed. He was, quite literally, turning into Santa Claus. Sue him.
They’re just a breath apart, and Dean can’t remember when Cas scooted closer, but his stomach is pressed against Dean’s now and his hand has relocated to Dean’s back. It’s intimate and arousing, and Dean can’t

A genuine smile flickers across Dean’s face and he ducks his head somewhat shyly which is, again, extremely bizarre for Castiel to have to just
Are you sure this kind of thing is really necessary?”

“I haven’t.”
His fists pounded the glass. Sam eyes were rolling back as the snow rose over his nose and mouth. His frost-covered brows disappears under white…
“I told you,” Castiel hisses to Sam at the first available opportunity, to which he’s rewarded immediately with what Dean would call, ‘Bitch Face Number Four Hundred and Thirty-Seven.’
“Hands down on the sheets, for now,” Castiel instructs,
“I’m getting there,” Dean assures him, somewhat grumpily. He is, but he’s also still working to shuffle his thoughts into something at all resembling coherence. Into something Cas won’t run screaming from the room over when he hears it fumble its way from Dean’s blundering mouth.
“He’s good now,” a voice says from somewhere above him, possibly belonging to one of the vaguely human-shaped blue blobs drifting in and out of his peripheral vision. Dean blinks hard and tries to sit up, stopped instantly by a firm hand on his shoulder and the same voice, now cautioning.
“Hey,” Dean pipes up as he pulls the Impala into the motel parking lot, stomach still aching (though not as bad as it did when the spell first hit). The pain is just beginning to spark the nerve tracts down into his hips and thighs, making both of his legs throb. It’s
After a moment of silence, Castiel raises his eyebrows and shakes his head. “I find that I’ve come to completely redefine torture since falling in love with Dean Winchester,” he says, finally, allowing the humor behind his complaint to quirk the edges of his mouth into a smile.
Dean’s eyes drift to the guy in question, and Cas raises an eye questioningly back at him. It’s subtle, but Dean can recognize the quiet worry in his expression. He shakes his head, almost imperceptibly—
Dean isn’t begging, but it’s a close thing, and Castiel truly feels for him. He understands the fear better than Dean thinks.
Charlie near-shrieks and Sam has to motion for her to keep it down. They are in the courthouse, after all, and there are courtrooms in session down the hall
Because of that, Dean has absolutely no clue what could possibly have driven Sam to start cleaning, but the sparkling plastic beauty with the clear, enticing water he’s looking down at is proof positive there was

going to treat him as such. He turns away from Cas and his unreal beauty, takes a deep breath, and gets himself together. “No, seriously, you can uh, get comfortable, if you want. I’m just gonna—”
him again. “I
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel replies back, holding Dean’s gaze from just a few inches too close for two (otherwise) platonic (fuck) buddies, and it’s then Dean realizes that maybe Cas has been looking at him this way all along.
“Remind me to thank Rowena with an angel blade through the heart. That’ll probably hurt her, right? Kills more things than you’d think.”
Cas was so hot and cold half the time, Dean had no idea how to maneuver him. One day Cas was smiling at him and giving him those soft, warm gazes like he had before the bank raid, or sharing a blanket with him under the icy chill of a cold evening. Then another day, he was barely making eye contact when Dean helped clean his wound and slid jeans over his splint, or handed him a glass of water and one measly Advil he’d found in a first aid kit.
From across the room, Castiel clears his throat as well, and seems to snap back into some practiced professional mode that Dean is extremely grateful the man has in his arsenal. Two more minutes of this awkward-ass bullshit and he’s tossing himself out the nearest window.

Or maybe—
Being led through the heavily draped curtains doesn’t feel ominous or scary, not when he’s following Cas, not when
is love,” Dean jokes weakly, his cheeks coloring either from the crying itself or the related embarrassment.
When he finally opens the door to the shower, Dean hesitates, caught up in admiring the way Cas shakes the water from his face and eyes before blinking them open. As usual, his gaze is sharp, intense, and it burns straight through Dean as steam rises around his tanned and wet body. If Dean’s being honest, he barely recognizes the man that’s been his friend for so many years—in this context, Castiel looks unearthly, ethereal, God-like. It’s a hell of a sight.
Dean’s heart sank and he exhaled heavily, his breath curly in the night, fading away in the breeze. He struggled for something to say to make Cas feel better, but he realised there was so fucking little he could say, so Dean just reached up and grabbed Cas shoulder, giving it a supportive squeeze.
"This is…" Sam peered at the ring, gently picking it up and looking at it curiously. He slowly put it back and looked up to stare at Dean. "It's for Cas, isn't it? You're gonna—you're actually gonna propose?"
cool—though, I hear you already found that out.” She looks up at him knowingly, and Dean’s horror must be reflected on his face because Becky goes instantly pale and slaps a hand over her mouth. “I’m sorry!” she squeaks. “That’s just—I mean, he didn’t—office gossip, you know how it is.”
For all the time he’s spent reassuring Dean that anxiety and vulnerability are not weaknesses, that there is
He turns his head then, raising an eyebrow, but Dean just scowls.
The question is: will they be good or bad?
OMG guys!!!! Our season is coming to a close, and it's been such an exciting ride! I feel so lucky to have been included in this amazing project and it's been so much fun to work on with all of my wonderful co-writers!!!
“Did you do that yet? Tell Sam we were going to go after his brother?”
“Enough,” Castiel interjects, but he’s choking down a smile when he does. He’ll have to work on that—it’s been a while since he had to
he notices. “You’re a weird, nerdy dude who likes orgies. But I dig it. You’re tough for a hippie, or whatever.”

arousing two-page spread.
Sam grabbed her by her face and planted a kiss on her forehead. He pulled back quickly, holding her gaze firmly. “Then I’m a real idiot. Go give the pieces to Jo, and wait there for us. I need to get my brother and Cas. W-We can’t risk those pieces not making it out.”
—to tuck himself into Cas’ side and wrap arms around his middle than to say, “Don’t worry, baby, I’m not about to run screaming from the room and possibly dissociate into next Tuesday.”
It’s more than clear that Sam is suffering, and Dean is out of time. Clutching Sam close, Dean sings softly as he does a brief, gentle exam. “‘Cause every little thing… is gonna be alright.” He half-sings, half-whispers, his eyes burning with unshed tears and his throat dry and cracking around the words. “Don’t worry…”
Castiel's face relaxed as he did that melting thing he always did. "Oh, well, yes, I do know that. And I'm sure you know that I—"
“Alright, just had to try that. But seriously, one more time.” This round, when Dean closes his eyes, he squeezes Castiel’s shoulder as he changes his own clothes back before working on Cas. The fabric of the trench coat shifts beneath Dean’s hand as he thinks, and when he opens his eyes, Cas looks a hell of a lot more touchable. “There,” Dean says proudly.
There’s a giant dumpster halfway down the alley, so Dean jogs over and peers around again before lifting the lid. Nothing remarkable inside, just big black bags of garbage, presumably waste from the courts. Without further hesitation, Dean pulls out the gun and the clip, gives them a cursory rub down, and drops them in. It’s a noiseless thing, the pieces landing softly on top of the existing trash.
His breath catching in his throat, Dean blinks back the water filling his eyes as Castiel’s hand comes to rest knowingly on his hip from behind. As Dean squeezes his eyes shut and the first tear falls, Cas’ face presses into the space between Dean’s shoulder blades, just as the door to the upper level finally gives way and comes crashing down the steps.
Humming thoughtfully, he turns his attention back to his blue tie against Dean’s wrists, regarding the way they’re pressed together between his fingers with interest. At the last second, he drops Dean’s hands without binding them, moving to the foot of the bed to sit down without comment. The disappointment on Dean’s face tells Castiel everything he needs to know about his feelings on restraints, and he resists the urge to give away the game.
“It’s just—” Sam growls a little and closes his eyes, but Charlie either doesn’t notice or pretends that’s the case. “
In fact, Dean—after all these years—still carried around a picture of him and Sam in his jacket pocket. If asked, Dean would proudly say his security blanket was his favorite gun, but Castiel knew better. It was that picture, and the picture was a promise Dean went out in a blaze of glory trying his damndest to fulfill.
There have to be more coming, though. Right now, there are only four or five other people on his boat, and one of the producers let slip that there are ten of them total. Dean supposes that makes sense, prolonging the mystery and making them think they have a handle on what’s happening just to rip the rug out from under their feet when they're least suspecting it. That’s the nature of reality TV (or so Dean’s heard, he’s not exactly a huge fan).
The worst thing he could do is send Dean away on another misunderstanding or miscommunication that they’ll both have to stew over alone, inevitably twisting and blowing it up into something that it’s not. So, later it is.
“I still have plenty of grace,” Gabe prostested.
—and he’s
It’s an incredible rush of power and emotion, and when Castiel pulls out and Dean gasps, he crouches down immediately, fisting both hands into Dean’s hair and kissing him thorough and deep, even as he’s still catching his breath. “Perfect,” he mutters into Dean’s mouth. “You’re perfect.”
Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. “God, that would be incredible,” he says.
