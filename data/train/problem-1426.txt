Eventually, John stirred beneath him, planting a kiss to Sherlock’s temple before his hands urged Sherlock to rise again.
“I’m not being ridiculous, you clot! You could have any of them over here with just a text. And that was before your body decided to start sending out mating signals left and right!”
“Alpha.” he gasped. “Bite me. Bond me. Breed me.”
When Sherlock was finished twitching and leaking, John hummed a deep low rumble in his chest as his arms came around Sherlock’s stomach and chest, smearing come everywhere they touched. Good to his promise, he soon had Sherlock covered in come. Sherlock was a sticky mess, and it was perfect. John held Sherlock close, satisfaction finally reaching his very core. Sherlock was his. No one had ever had him before John. And John never intended to give him up. His perfectly imperfect husband. John’s hand wove through Sherlock’s, their rings glinting in the low light of the bedroom. John stroked his finger over his husband’s ring, satisfaction and exhaustion finally sending him off to sleep.
“How long are we stuck?”
At John's question, a whimpering sob burst forth from Sherlock's lips, quickly caught and swallowed back.
John snorted.
“I want to hear your pleasure, Omega. I want to hear you whimper and moan and cry out. I want to hear you beg and scream and shout.”
His mind blanked and he came hard as John’s wet hand wrapped around his cock as his mouth settled on his neck, sucking hard on his scent gland.
Sherlock felt heat enter his cheeks. “You might.” he managed.
Within a week, Sherlock's body had begun to change. His hips had widened, his normally (
At that, John couldn’t resist anymore. He stepped forward, pulling the Omega into his arms, one arm at his back, one behind his head, guiding him to John’s neck. The hand on his back rubbed soothing circles, the one at his nape began combing through the hair there.
Sherlock’s heart plummeted. Of course. John didn't want this. He could never want someone like Sherlock. An Omega who was practically the antithesis of the ideal. John had tried, had given Sherlock a chance, and he’d blown it with his obvious inexperience.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at John’s incredulous tone. He realized John was expecting some sort of reply.
John began rocking into him, slowly at first but quickening the pace steadily until he was practically pounding Sherlock into the sheets. Sherlock was whimpering and clinging tightly to John,who was huffing little pleased groans on every thrust.
John sighed. “Someone replaced Sherlock's suppressants with sugar pills. He didn't recognize the symptoms for what they were until it was too late.” John didn't mention that he had assumed Sherlock had chosen to stop taking them, or that he had thought he'd done so for The Woman. “Ideally, we need to secure 221B against whomever it is.” It was always best for an Omega to endure their heat at home. “If that's not possible, we need to move him to a secure location immediately.”
“Chips. From the chippie near the tube that does fresh garlic. With French mustard.”
John reached out one hand, settling it against Sherlock’s cheek, forcing him to meet his eyes.
“I can think of something better to put in my mouth.”
“It was you?!” For once, John beat Sherlock to the punchline.
John forced himself not to rush up the stairs. He was constantly reminding himself not to smother Sherlock, not to treat him like some fragile, delicate thing that needed coddling, despite his Alpha side’s urgings to care for the Omega, to see to his every need, to make sure he was safe and comfortable, well fed and well loved.
“Indeed. The texts The Woman sent to your phone were intercepted by our team. We fed her misinformation, which she in turn fed to Moriarty. In the end, our net closed around both of them.”
“No!” Sherlock tightened his hold on John, burying his suddenly crimson face in John’s neck to hide it. Though they’d been having sex for weeks, John always initiated and Sherlock always followed his lead. He didn’t want to be too demanding, to rock the boat or show John just how ignorant he was in this area. But he desperately wanted this. “I want-can we just-?”and he lifted a leg, wrapping it around John’s waist, the shift bringing their hardened cocks into alignment.
John groaned and leaned in to bite Sherlock’s arse. Then he thrust two fingers into Sherlock, scissoring and twisting.
“This isn’t-you can’t just experiment on me. I don’t want-” Sherlock looked away, and John forced himself to continue. “I don’t want this just to be some sort of data collection. If you want this, really want
“Twins.”
John couldn’t move. If he did, he was liable to throw Sherlock to the ground and mount him like a dog in heat. He gripped the chair, trying to gain some semblance of control.
Sherlock found himself responding, mimicking John’s movements. Just when he felt he was getting the hang of it, sliding his own tongue against John’s and then stroking just the tip against the roof of John's mouth, John groaned low and deep. John’s other arm came around Sherlock's waist, pulling them together tightly. Sherlock was embarrassingly aware of how the hard length of his arousal pressed against John's belly. After a moment he realized John was in a similar state; his much larger Alpha cock was pressed long and hard against Sherlock's thigh.
Sherlock didn't bother to respond. He was elated. John was going to mate with him. John was working himself up, worried about preparing everything in time.
“Twins?!”
“I love you.”
to bond with him.
Smut, smutty smut
“Well, you’re not seeing to my needs. I
Sherlock groaned as he sat back. It had been nearly a week since he had decided to go back on suppressants, but it appeared his body disagreed with his decision. Every time he tried to take a pill, he became violently ill and emptied the contents of his stomach. Worse, now the nausea was present most mornings, and occasionally took hold at seemingly random moments: when he sat up too quickly, when an unpleasant smell wafted through the air, once when John had kissed him with coffee breath. John had started stocking bottles of water and crackers next to the bed, along with a large bowl, in case he didn’t make it to the bathroom in time. He’d also taken care to always change and bathe when he got home, brushing his teeth before coming near the Omega. This was awful. Sherlock wondered if being newly bonded somehow made him susceptible to germs. It would make sense for a newly bonded couple to need to stay away from others if bonding somehow compromised the immune system. Perhaps John had gone back to work too early, and now Sherlock was suffering the consequences. He vowed to give John an earful when he got home. He would demand that John stop going to work, and stay home and take care of him. But first, he needed a nap. Sherlock curled up on the floor mat in the bathroom, eyes drifting shut as he allowed the coolness of the bathroom to soothe his overheated body.
Oliver sighed, resting his chin on his knee again and turning the cube over in his hands. “I’ve never told anyone, but I’m always afraid I’m going to die. I can’t breathe when it happens and sometimes my feet and hands get numb, and my heart beats too fast.”
“Hm? Oh!” He looked up. “Yes. Please. Just sugar.”
“All right?” John asked.
“In the park a few blocks from Baker Street. Last time he had his phone on him was probably ten minutes ago,” John said, his heart still pounding. He can’t believe this kind of thing happened again. What must Mycroft think of him? He was so unfit to be raising Oliver.
Oliver nodded, and Mrs Hudson caught him in a hug. Oliver smiled, leaning into it.
“All right, Oliver?” John asked.
“What about my niece? I can’t leave her alone.”
“Good afternoon John,” Mycroft said, putting his hand on the boy’s shoulder, and the boy slid one of the headphones off his ear. “This is Oliver. Oliver, say hello to Doctor John Watson.”
John thought sarcastically, glancing back at Oliver. He didn’t really like other teenagers.
John shrugged, “Sort of, but nothing has been happening. I do the same thing everyday, it’s driving me insane.”
*sips tea*
Not long after, Mycroft came to pick Sherlock up because there were people he needed to talk to, and things he needed to do. Not just apologies or explanations, but there was still business with Moriarty’s organization, and Sherlock had information that Mycroft’s people needed.
after every news outlet ever blew up when he commit suicide two years ago. It’s like looking at a ghost.”
They stood in silence for another moment, the clinking of tea cups and Mrs Hudson’s humming coming from the kitchen. Cars passed by outside on the street below, the occasional honk in the distance.
He had been reading over what he’d written so far when the front door opened and slammed shut. He glanced at the time - it’s past three, so that must be Oliver. The boy’s feet pound up the stairs, and John turned to look at the doorway in time to see Oliver rush in and drop his bag. John barely got a look at him (pale, shaking hands, wide unseeing eyes, breathing hard like he had ran the whole way) before Oliver rushed into his room. It only takes a moment for John to think: panic attack.
Caden tilted his head, trying to catch Oliver’s eyes. “You can even punch me in the face if you want, right now. I deserve it.”
At the flat John told Oliver to get in the shower and take his time. Oliver nodded, kicking off his dripping shoes. He started unbuttoning his shirt as he head towards the bathroom.
“I don’t wanna talk about it.”
Emily jumped in, “Okay, let’s talk about this.” She pointed to Oliver’s easel, at the unfinished project propped up on it. It was supposed to be a painting of his grandparent’s garden, vibrant flowers accompanied by butterflies that often flew around during sunset. He started it before John sent him back after Sherlock’s return, and since then he couldn’t find the motivation to continue. The colors would look uneven and he wasn’t in the right mindset for the painting to flow together.
John threw off his blankets off, shuffled over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.
John nodded. The hospital visiting hours opened at seven thirty, so John just had to find ways to keep busy until then. He’d rather get rid of anything dangerous out of Oliver’s room now than later.
John rubbed his palms against his eyes and sat up. “I should have been here.”
Oliver was already dressed by the time John woke up and limped into the living room. The boy had sat in John’s armchair, his legs curled up onto the cushion while he leaned over a notebook in his lap. His dark curls hung past his cheeks, obscuring most of his face and the light that filtered through the curtain shone off the maroon tint to his hair.
Caden pointed his thumb at Emily. “She tried to beat me here, but I was already in the area, so we ended up at your door at the same time.”
John followed, leaning heavily on his cane while Oliver rushed past into his bedroom. They then spent the better part of an hour setting up the mount so the telescope would look out Oliver’s bedroom window, making sure the extra lens it came with worked and that everything situated correctly.
Mycroft rubbed the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes. “Oliver…”
“‘M tryin’,” he mumbled, his eyelids fluttering. “
“Um - yes,” Oliver’s eyes flicked up to his Uncle, who had put his phone down and was listening. Oliver switched to fidgeting with his sleeves. John stood up and grabbed Oliver’s rubik’s cube from the kitchen counter and dropped it in the boy’s hands. Oliver switched to twisting the cube before talking.
, and her tumblr
also i hate my writing lmao
Everything felt weird. As if yesterday was dream, or it happened to someone else. Truthfully, when he had woken up in the hospital this morning, a part of himself felt... disappointed, more than anything. Disappointed he woke up. Disappointed he had made it through bleeding out and through the surgery. Disappointed in himself. He didn't want to have to deal with everything. With John, or Sherlock, the physical pain, the emotional pain,
Okay so... here's the thing. I know you guy are getting a lot of "Oliver and his friends" in these past few chapters. It needs to happen though, because I'm setting up all the plot lines. Oliver has his own story in this fic, just like John and Sherlock have theirs (and everything intertwines). I hope you guys don't mind though, and thank you for bearing with me.
“I know,” Sherlock said. “Me too.”
He practically vaulted down the stairs, breathing easier when he left the flat, and opened the front door. Both his friends stood there, Emily looking agitated and Caden wearing a smug smile.
Oliver, visibly shaking with anger and John couldn’t recall a single other time Oliver had been this angry before. Oliver jabbed a finger towards Sherlock. “He’s being insufferable! He doesn’t understand what he’s done to everyone, he-!”
“Where’s Ollie? Oh, he’s going to be distraught,” She said, her hand moving up to cover her mouth.
“He -  he says he’s cold. On the inside,” Sherlock stuttered out.
He went on, his hand moving a bit to each star he pointed to. John watched his face grow relaxed, his grip on the windowsill loosen and his breathing calm. John put together enough to know he had a nightmare that led to a minor panic attack, but it blew him away that Oliver sought him out rather than his grandparents.
John rolled his lip between his teeth. “What do you want to do?”
it’s bad, but something about the illicit call and seeing Caden do it made it enticing. And he liked the idea of doing something John and Sherlock didn’t know about, they’re too absorbed in each other to even suspect. He’d been lucky to avoid Sherlock most of the times he came home after smoking.
John thought not to mention that working with corpses on the daily probably didn’t help as much as she’d like it to. Did Molly live with anyone? He couldn’t even recall, which made him feel worse - God, he’d been a rotten friend to her. “You’re not alone are you?”
“Thank you, John,” Oliver said, before yawning again. John chuckled and told him to go back to bed. John called out of work, not wanting to leave Oliver home alone all day due to his own paranoia.
Oliver snapped his head to look at John and his face turned red in less than a second. He hesitated, then blurted out, “It’s - it’s just that everything is changing and I - I hate it because Emily’s still annoying but I don’t really mind her, she’s just stubborn but she’s my friend now and, and, I’ve never really made friends before. But now it’s happening kinda fast and Caden doesn’t mind how strange I can be and he - he likes astronomy too, and he’s good at maths, and he likes my art and he has these stupid perfect white teeth and his hair is like -
“Oh, dear if he had you’d’ve been spoiled rotten with the pastries I make,” she laughed.
Just another thing he added to his list of differences between Oliver and Sherlock. Oliver listened to a rustic kind of acoustic rather than classical.
Monday, a week after their visit to the Holmes’ estate, John had the day off and Oliver came home directly after school instead of going to his club. John heard the door slam and looked at his watch with a frown. Oliver stomped up the stairs and appeared in the doorway, twisting his rubik’s cube erratically with a frown on his face. He ignored John and went straight to his room, slamming the door behind him.
“Shit!” Oliver shouted. “
When he did get home, he collapsed onto the couch and sighed, wondering where the sudden tiredness had come from. Today had just been a bad day, John decided. It happened sometimes. He hoped Oliver had a better day, but when the boy came home an hour later John could tell by the way he walked up the stairs and the clicking of his rubik’s cube that something happened.
Bad day, then. John gave him some time to cool down and started making dinner. When he did call Oliver out of his room, the boy seemed to have calmed down a bit, and sat at the table with John, pushing his food around on his plate.
John decided, was the lucky one of the two.
Oliver nodded in earnest, yet again surprising John.
“‘S all right,” John said, trying to show Oliver they were on the same side. “I can understand if he’s upset with having to move in with a perfect stranger.”
On another note, this is one of my favorite chapters so far.
“I played in the garden a lot when I was little,” Oliver said. “I brought in bugs all the time and grandmother would have a fit.”
John woke early, finally, because today he had to go into work. He currently had four hours of sleep (maybe) and somewhat dreaded having the morning shift. He stumbled downstairs to take a shower and fumble with the coffee maker for a few minutes. He’d need it today. The bag of sugar they had been scooping out of was empty, and he sighed. Oliver had a habit of not throwing things out when they were gone. It led to empty juice cartons in the refrigerator and John never knowing what they actually needed to buy at the grocery.
She scooted off to the kitchen, muttering about Sherlock bringing body parts home and causing hazardous molding again. John shook his head and smiled a bit, listening to the sound of her putting together some lunch. Sometimes she just came upstairs and made a meals for him and Oliver, and neither of them minded. They both knew she got lonely.
“Yeah,” Caden smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
John shut the door behind Mycroft and stepped over to the window and watched the teenager climb into the back of the car. He felt disconnected, it was so surreal. Sherlock’s
“Good day?” John asked from his laptop.
(See the end of the chapter for
“All right?” He asked. It’s strange that he’d come to know Molly’s niece just as well as Molly herself. She’d spent enough time at the flat with Oliver over the past year or so.
. I know the updates are a bit weird for this story, but you're getting the chapters much faster than you normally would! :)
Only a moment later, Oliver came out and dragged John into the room because he wanted to tell him about what all the different parts on the telescope did and what the phase of the moon meant in relation to the stars. John felt content to just listen to him be passionate about something.
Also, there is quite a bit of foreshadowing in this chapter ;)
Oliver turned and stood up, brushing the rumples out of his shirt. “I -um, I stopped taking my pills.”
Oliver shouted over him, “
“On the condition that you never run away again,” Mycroft added.
John didn’t say anything to that, but he stood and picked up their empty plates. He put them in the sink and turned on the tap, might as well wash them now since he didn’t have anything else to do. Sherlock stayed at the table.
“It was very nice to meet you Oliver,” she said, giving him a fond smile.
“Please, Oliver,” he mumbled into the dark locks.
“No, I didn’t move.”
Sherlock walked back into the sitting room, saying, “Mycroft has a lead but it’s unreliable at best and running cold.”
“My parents informed me that when they get back into the country, they’d like Oliver and you to visit,” Mycroft said.
Also, the next update is the last one for this fic, guess what that means ;)
“In just a few weeks,” John said. The rest of the conversation took off. They talked about things they always talked about, and bickered like always would - about their favorite sports teams or whether or not the rainy weather was good.
Oliver's French dialogue (i do not speak French at all, this is all through the shameless use of Google translate btw):
Oliver’s eyes widened and he ducked his head to look at the cracked floor tiles. “You miss him.”
A hole ate through Oliver’s very core, and he wanted to be swallowed up by the ground and never see day again.
He hailed a cab and took it to the street near the warehouse, paid the driver, and stepped out to walk the rest of the way. He put his hands in his pockets and stepped in the entrance in the back of the building they always used to avoid being seen.
Sherlock, teeth grit, spoke softly, “
Oliver’s face turned beat red and he nodded.
“That’s wonderful, have you explained this to him?”
“Good morning,” John said, walking a past him to the kitchen. Oliver didn’t say anything. John took a deep breath, and put a kettle on the stove.
“Sorry,” mumbled Oliver, crossing his arms and sinking down on the couch so his knees touched the coffee table. John couldn’t look at his face. He actually couldn’t, fearing he would vomit seeing
John thanked him again and let out a breath of relief before limping back into the exam room.
Harry laughed, and John raised an eyebrow though she couldn’t see. “He sounds like you, Johnny.”
Violet looked horrified and Sigar leaned forward, “Has it been dealt with?”
“We should go to the hospital,” John said, guiding Oliver’s unsteady feet to the stairs.
Oliver chewed his bottom lip and brushed his curls out of his face, looking towards the window. “Uncle Mycroft said Sherlock doesn’t have friends.”
“Even unfinished it looks like a masterpiece,” Caden said.
When they got back to the flat, Sherlock pulled off his coat and hung it while John toed off his shoes, then grabbed Sherlock’s shirt and kissed him. John pushed him backwards until he landed on the couch and John was leaning over him, one hand braced on the back of the couch, the other fisted in Sherlock’s shirt collar, and his knee on the cushion.
. There’s a massive crack between them that John’s worried will never be healed, and they both know it.
dumbass.”
“Shouldn’t I help look?”
” Oliver gasped. “
John smiled a bit, then turned to face him fully. “Mainly you have to try and get him to regulate his breathing. Oliver hyperventilates during most of his attacks, and if it goes for too long, he’ll pass out. Sometimes he pulls his hair or digs his nails into his skin, so just pull his arms away and hold them if he does. I’ve found giving him something to focus his hands on helps, which is why we have three of those,” John pointed to the rubik’s cube on the mantel.
Harry arrived first, an hour after noon. Harry and him had always looked similar, both a bit on the shorter side with rounder features. Harry’s hair was darker and shoulder length, and she took after their mother with her full lips and curved wasit that made other girls go crazy. John greeted her and accepted a little longer than necessary hug before she pulled away and looked him up and down.
John woke with a shout, his body covered in sweat and his heart pounding feverishly.
Oliver’s door opening broke the moment, and they both looked into the hall to see Oliver scowl at Sherlock, then walk into the bathroom and shut the door with more force than necessary.
“Oh, you’re adorable,” Harry said, then she winked. “It’s just Harry, by the way.”
’ and ‘
“But I want to sit out here with you,” Oliver said. He sounded like a little kid.
A few days after that, Oliver rushed home after his club and guitar lessons, pounding up the stairs. John looked up, worried something had happened, but a grin graced Oliver’s face instead.
“Here,” he said. Oliver couldn’t read him. He looked fine. He looked like everything was fine but it
Oliver nodded, his heart fluttering, He’d have to face John when he got home. His eyes flicked to the man, who was standing next to the bed, his arms crossed and face unreadable. Oliver swallowed, trying to calm himself down. He knew he was in deep shit. Suddenly, going home didn’t seem too exciting.
soft and -” he gulped for a breath and ducked his head, cover his face with his hands.
from his body, and blood splattered to the ground. Oliver sucked in a huge breath, his head pounding.
She smiled patiently. “Are you going to school?”
what's this? two weekly updates in a row? madness!
“Miscalculated?
Sherlock broke the kiss, “John-”
Oliver looked over his shoulder, his teeth grit. He had a tight grip on his hand, dark blood oozing out from between his fingers and dripping into the sink. “I - uh, I hit it against the counter on accident and it shattered.”
and respond to every single one. If I ever missed one, I'm sorry. I appreciate ALL of you so much, your reviews are what keep this story going.
That night John dreamed about Sherlock pushing him off the roof of Bart’s. He slept less than an hour.
John glanced from the desk into the kitchen, where Oliver sat at the table, listening to music and drawing, lost in his own little world. John let a small smile lift his lips. “You’re not going to believe me when I tell you this, but Sherlock’s child is what changed.”
The doctor was still talking, “You’ll need to come back in three or so weeks to check how your wrist is healing.” She flipped her papers down and smiled at them. “You’ll probably want to use a wheelchair to get to your car, there’s one in the hall for you. I’ll leave you two be, then.”
“Drop your clothes outside that door and I’ll ask Mrs Hudson if we can use her wash,” John called after him. Oliver nodded, then shut the bathroom door behind him.
I almost forgot to post this today... here's another shitty chapter I guess?? Sorry if there's any typos, I didn't have the chance to proof read it.
He descended the stairs into the living room just as a glass shattered in the kitchen.
Harry, being his sister, knew it was a lie but also knew it meant he didn’t want to talk about it. She took a sip of her drink and nodded. “Sometimes that’s good, yeah? When does Ollie start school?”
“Nothing,” interrupted Oliver. “I can deal with them on my own. I always have.”
His phone beeped from his room, and he went and picked it up. A message from Caden glowed off the screen. He didn’t want to think about Caden, or anything that happened yesterday. He chewed the inside of his cheek, and opened the message.
“All I need is your approval on this change, and Oliver can start his new schedule on Monday.”
John scoffed. “It’s my decision when it comes to keeping you safe! If you’d-”
John was relieved to be taking Oliver home finally, as quiet as Oliver generally was, the flat felt even quieter without him. Sherlock had to meet with Mycroft the afternoon John was due to pick Oliver up, so he went alone.
Sherlock’s head snapped up to look at him. “Of course not, someone is
Also, my update days are switching to Wednesdays, so the next chapter will be out on October 4th (next Wednesday).
“All right, it will be good to get out of the city for a bit. Especially for Oliver I think,” John said. “Take his mind off everything. Is this weekend too soon?”
“Where’s your room?” John asked.
“Please eat, John,” Mrs Hudson urged in a quieter voice. Out of the corner of his eye, Oliver glanced from John’s plate to John. Trying to appease her, John tried again with a piece of bacon. She smiled softly at the slight effort, then continued her spiel about the trash collector who left a mess on the back sidewalk.
John shut his eyes and breathed deeply through his nose, trying to calm the swirling tide of emotions that stormed his chest. A moment later there was a soft knock on the kitchen doorway, and John opened his eyes to seeing Mrs Hudson standing there.
"S-Something's wrong -
They sat across from each other, in the armchairs. Oliver had his legs crossed and up on the cushion, his rubik’s cube in his lap. “Um…” he looked hesitant, reaching up to twist his hair between two fingers.
like to do before. John realized that might entirely be a possibility.
John pulled Oliver to his chest in a hug. He held the back of Oliver’s head and felt Oliver’s fingers grip his coat. John shut his eyes when he felt the boy shudder a sob into his shoulder, thin fingers digging into his back. He held Oliver and let him cry, gently threading his fingers through the boy’s wet hair and rocking forward slightly moving his leg under him so he was sitting with Oliver between his legs.
Mycroft visit on the second day, to make sure the doctors were up to his standards, also to tell Oliver that his grandparents knew there had been “an accident”. Oliver’s glad he kept it vague from them.
Sherlock shouted, “I can’t keep pretending everything is okay because I know it’s not and so do you!”
John chuckled and led her up the stairs to 221B. Mrs Hudson greeted Harry with a big smile, saying she’d wanted to meet the other Watson for months now. Harry laughed, and said she would’ve been around sooner if John had just invited her. John rolled his eyes as that.
“You must be ahead of your class, being a Holmes boy, yes?”
“Of course.”
“Let’s do this again soon,” Lestrade pulled on his coat. “See you, John.”
John sighed again and leaned his cheek in his hand, watching Oliver draw from across the room. Since when did John start to care so much again?
He leaned out the door and watched her brave wind, her scarf wrapped around her mouth and nose. Then he leaned back in and pulled the door shut. Molly and Emily were behind him, pulling on their coats and gloves. Oliver and Mrs Hudson stood at the bottom of the stairs to see them off.
John smiled. “Okay, as long as you rest and actually eat something.”
Oliver looked back at him, but didn’t really meet his eyes, looked down at the floor and disappeared into his room, leaving his door fully open. John felt bad but he didn’t… trust Oliver. It felt awful, but it was best for now, and Oliver must know that.
Mycroft shook his head. “He’s always like this. At least whenever I see him - he’s a moody teenager. Similar to Sherlock at his age.”
The third (and finale) fic I've started writing already, and I'm not sure how long it is going to be yet. If I had to estimate, I'd say between 12 and 15 chapters.
“These are for Oliver,” She said, putting the plastic container on the table. “If he’s feeling up to eating. How’s he doing?”
“Really?” Oliver looked up, his face hopeful. He looked so much younger when his face lit up like that, and his hair was extra messy today, curls sticking up all over the place.
so we can talk about it! Or, just message me in general, I love talking to any of you!
A call from Oliver’s school came during John’s shift at work, a week after New Year’s Eve. Worry gripped him at first, and he answered quickly, stepping out of the exam room.
Sherlock came home on Wednesday night. Oliver had gone to his guitar lessons, and was going out with his friends after, so John was alone that evening. Oliver was looking a little less tired, and seemed happy to get out of the flat. John checked the tracker on his phone a few times, and it showed Oliver at Molly’s house, where Emily had been staying.
John thanked him and hung up the phone, then breathed out a sigh of relief.
I struggled a lot with this chapter because not much
Oliver looked embarrassed again upon seeing his phone.
Sherlock nodded, putting his hands on the kitchen table and leaning on them. “I can’t believe I didn’t catch it. I never paid attention to Oliver’s friends. Why wouldn’t I? It’s so unlike me.”
“When that happens,” Sherlock said, “how do I help?”
"Il est parfait…" means "he's perfect..."
A small smile tugged at the edges of Oliver’s mouth and he looked back down at the paper to hide it.
John walked to the front door and opened it loudly then shut it, so Oliver would know he returned home. The music shut off and Oliver appeared in the kitchen doorway while John took off his shoes.
“All right, I’ll grab your shoes and you can help me find all the pieces,” John said. He found Oliver’s shoes by the doorway and passed them to him, then got the dustpan from next to the fridge and they both began sweeping up the pieces of glass.
“Oh, um…” Oliver stepped around the chair and offered his hand. John glanced at Mrs Hudson, who for the first time he’d ever seen, looked speechless.
He could remember meeting her on New Year's Eve, almost two years ago now. He had hated her instantly. Oliver wished he could go back to those few months before he met Caden, when Emily and him were actually friends - even though they liked to pretend they couldn't stand each other. But it would never go back to that. Too much had changed and everything was ruined, and it was all his fault.
“Ah, you didn’t have to do that -”

I won't keep you up here any longer, I'm sure you want to read. So, here's the final chapter and I hope to see you all in the next one.
“Er… yeah, I guess,” Oliver played with the string on his hoodie. “But I acted sort of awful too, and he freaked out. Sherlock could tell I was high, and told John.”
“Didn’t he stay at your aunt's house the other night?” Oliver asked. “You seemed shocked to see him.”
- this was real. All of it was real and it made his chest hurt and flutter and everything broken felt like it was being taped back together.
. I should have stayed here.”
Oliver paused and took a shaky breath, putting his hand to his forehead. Then whispered, “Can we please just go home?”
They don’t speak for the rest of the night.
“I’m delighted you're enjoying London,” she changed the subject, letting go of his hand and picking up her drink. She looked at Sigar, “I haven’t heard him talk this much since he was little.”
John became more desperate with each unsuccessful try. He might have been crying but it might just be the water running from his hair. He didn’t care, all that was important was Oliver. Saving Oliver.
Oliver swallowed hard and slowly lifted his head. “I’m - I’m going to go lay in bed. I don’t feel well.”
John shut his eyes in relief. He sighed a breath he’d been holding for eternity and asked, “Can you stand?”
“I have something for you,” Oliver said. He got up from his spot on the couch and rushed through the kitchen to his room. He came back a moment later with thin rectangular canvas, about a foot tall. He sat back down cross-legged facing John on the couch and held out the canvas face down.
“This door always jams,” he said. “It’s Sherlock’s old room.”
Sherlock had two laptops in front of him (John had no idea where they came from) and John had his, plus all the clippings and files. They spent a good hour or two scouring news sites, files, and databases they probably shouldn’t have access too, trying to connect the organization with any other crimes or the terrorist attack. It seemed to be impossible to track them.
Mycroft left soon after. He mussed Oliver’s hair and gave him a one-armed hug. Oliver left the sitting room for a quick shower to warm up and get the grime out of his hair. John sat down in his arm chair, trying to read, but his leg was bouncing and he still felt anxious from the past days events. Nervous about if he could be enough for Oliver - he already almost ruined it. Did Oliver see it that way?
John sat by the window with his coffee on Saturday morning, his streak of bad nights continuing and making it extremely difficult to do anything. Oliver came out of his room a few hours before noon, his headphones over his ears. He sat down in John’s armchair again, crossing his legs beneath him on the cushion and opening the notebook he had left there.
Mycroft elbowed Oliver arm and snapped, “Oliver!”
“Oh, I insist,” she said, making her way into the kitchen. “I found a new recipe I
. Do you not realize you could have died the other night? You practically did! If I had been
“I was just on the phone with Molly, and she’s asked if you’ll tutor Emily,” John said. “Emily’s in the grade below you, and she needs help passing her classes for the year. She’s offered to pay you as well.”
“As I expected,” Mycroft said, and John could practically hear the aristocratic nod he gave when he was right about something. “I told him to ask you, I’m a bit surprised it took this long for him to work up the courage. You mightn’t be surprised to hear my parents have suggested it in the past as well.”
John didn’t fall asleep until after three in the morning, the shadows in his bedroom taunting him and dancing like people, his mind racing through half-formed thoughts. Nightmares kept him tossing and turning. He woke up late, and it took longer than he would have liked to get out of bed - already the start to a bad day. He showered and shaved for the first time in days. It gave him the illusion of being “
John felt like he was going through the motions as Sherlock dragged him outside and hailed a cab to follow.
Molly seemed to consider this. “She’s fourteen.”
There was a wet thunk as Caden’s hand met his body, the force of it pushing him back a step.
Monday came quickly, the weekend passing in awkward silences and forced questions (John) without answers (Oliver). John had scheduled a therapy appointment with Ella for 9:30 and Oliver had to leave for school at 8:00 to be there on time. John’s alarm clock blared to life way earlier than he had gotten used to the past few months. He didn’t get out of bed for almost half an hour. When he finally did, he made his way to the kitchen leaning heavier on his cane than he usually would. He could hear Oliver shuffling around in his room.
okay so another transitional, heavy chapter. but this one is sorta the turning point for the last "arc" as the story comes to a close. As most of you have probably seen, i've marked this story to be 20 chapters long, and it will probably be around that (maybe 21-22). my biggest problem right now is theres a specific plot line i'm having trouble wrapping up, but i'll figure it out.
“I was headed to the park,” Caden laughed.
John frowned, Oliver hadn’t come out yet. He lifted his cane off the back of his chair and limped to the door, then knocked softly, “Are you all right?”
Sherlock is gone when John woke up. He didn’t leave a text or note or anything, which is fine, because John didn’t expect him to. Sherlock could have left five minutes before John woke up, or three hours ago - John didn’t know.
“Spring.”
“I haven’t had a drink in months,” Harry told him. “Somedays are harder than others, but days like today when I feel energized and happy are what make it worth it.”
Oliver, who looked confused up to this point, shot his head up and looked from Mycroft to John with wide eyes. “Are those-” he didn’t finish his sentence, too busy lunging across the table to grab the folder and throw it open. The folder contained all the information to kick the adoption into gear.
, it didn’t even feel real now. If he let go of Sherlock he might disappear, or fade away.
, and it had to be believable.”
I'm planning on it being a trilogy, I guess. This fic is the first one, and there is 16 total chapters.
“Mhmm,” Ella nodded. “What reason would that be?”
Oliver started school on a warm August day, a refreshing change from the rain and wind they had the past few days. He looked eager, straightening his shirt and running his fingers through his hair. Hopefully this year would be better than last year. Oliver looked optimistic, and he said the astronomy club would start up in a week.
John leaned over Oliver and picked him up, his head lolling against John’s shoulder and his arm hanging. The Holmes followed him out to the rental car and helped him settle Oliver into the backseat before he got into the front and waved goodbye.
He slunk out of bed and got dressed, then made his way downstairs into the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth. Just as he was about to turn on the water heater for tea, a hesitant knock sounded on the front door. John shut his eyes and took a breath, then let Sherlock into the flat.
“Why not?” Sherlock snapped, standing up. “Why aren’t you angry at me? Like Oliver was! I don’t understand why you’re so forgiving! Yell at me, punch me, something!”
“Do I need to bring him, or…”
Oliver gave a noncommittal shrug. John then remembered Emily leaving the flat looking upset, and wondered if she knew about Oliver’s feelings and was jealous.
He took the hand Oliver was holding and pressed Oliver’s hand to own chest. He took a slow, deep breath in, then let it out. John did that a few times until Oliver began to mimic him and the shaking slowed.
bring Emily with you today, because I can just end this now.”
. John abruptly stood and didn’t register Oliver’s raised eyebrows as he almost tripped over the coffee table in a rush to get through the kitchen and into the bathroom. He dropped to his knees in front of the toilet just before he vomit, gagging and gasping because all he could see were glassy blue eyes and red stained alabaster skin.
“O-Okay,” Oliver murmured. He felt paranoid going to bed that night, and ended up staying awake until almost three in the morning, searching every inch of his room for cameras or microphones. When he finally collapsed in bed, he was relieved he didn’t find any, but fell asleep to nightmares.
“Wait, you’re leaving -”
John bumped his shoulder against Oliver’s. “If you like him, you should tell him.”
John shifted in his seat. Harry was bound to know Sherlock was alive, it had hit the news a while ago after enough people spotted and recognized him. But John didn’t really want to talk about that. He didn’t want to bring it up and watch concern wash over his sister’s face, or answer any of the questions he himself barely had answers to.
Oliver came home a little after eight, his cheeks and nose bright from the cold but a smile graced his face and he walked in already chatting. “One of the boy’s had a really nice, expensive telescope his father bought him so we took turns on that and we could zoom in enough to see details on the moon and it was extraordinarily pretty.”
Sherlock’s smirk grew as he kept staring at John. The doctor swallowed hard, not used to this side of the detective.
Sherlock was elated to hear those words, and the kiss. Well the kiss was just bloody fantastic. And there would be a lot more of those in the future. Of course, John had to answer for his crimes, but it did so happen that the men he killed, yes including Mary—she'd been a sniper at the pool—had worked for Moriarty, so that was at least useful in a way. The courts in fact exonerated him for getting rid of high-risk targets, but he was kept under strict surveillance.
Finally, that spark caused something within John's deranged mind to snap. All of the black thoughts, the dark, brooding nature of his thoughts that had haunted the depths of his mind for two years had finally ceased to exist. He closed his eyes for a moment, his hands against Sherlock's chest as he stopped moving. When he opened them again, he saw the detective in an entirely new light. "Sherlock…" His voice wasn't gravelly. It wasn't degrading. It was just a light, soft tone now. It was John's voice.
John laughed. "By leaving me alone with nothing for two years! I think it's a bit late for protection, Sherlock!" He growled, moving the knife upward slightly to get a new angle for another cut. Sherlock winced, and John seethed with maniacal delight.
John’s calm grin turned into a sly smirk and he waggled his eyebrows slightly. “I guess you’ll just have to find out, Sherlock.” His voice was noticeably lower and gravelly as he spoke. Then, he turned sharply on his heel and sauntered off to get his coat. He was smirking the whole time.
“Get in the bloody car,” John demanded. However angry he was, he still pulled the back door open for Sherlock, who clambered inside. The interior of the car was a nice and toasty, very comfortable temperature. John got in beside him, staring at him. Sherlock met his gaze, expecting the worst.
"For what?"
“But we just did something you like last weekend, John.” Sherlock stuck his bottom lip out. He was pouting. John shook his head and glanced away, clenching his jaw slightly. He smiled thinly.
“Sh-Sherlock…” John panted as Sherlock stepped back. “That was…”
“I’m your husband. I married you. Of course I want to know.” John rolled his eyes and sat down again, his eyes on Sherlock. Sherlock looked over at him, reaching out for John’s hand this time. Finally, he could hold his hand and stay that way, forever. He didn’t have to worry about John not loving him. He didn’t have to worry about someone trying to steal John away from him. John was his, and that made Sherlock happy. Well, it would under any other circumstances. After the hell they had all been through, he owed it to Sherlock!
“Oh come on, Sherlock. It’ll be fun.” John said, standing in the doorway of the bedroom to keep the detective from dashing off before he could finish.
“I’m fine, John.” He said, brushing him off and crossing his arms. John frowned and walked around the chair to face Sherlock, not caring that people were watching. “Sherlock, talk to me. What is it? This is supposed to be the happiest day of our lives. Don’t sulk at your own wedding!” John said, his voice becoming exasperated as Sherlock refused to cooperate with him.
Sherlock obeyed, tossing his soaking coat over the driver’s seat of the police car. Next, he unbuttoned his drenched hunter green shirt—it was Christmas Eve, after all—and similarly draped it over the seat in front of him. Finally, he slipped out of his trousers, pants, and soaked shoes, becoming one very naked detective in the back of one of New Scotland Yard’s police cars.
“John was relying on that. He thought you’d be pleased to see me. For some reason or another.”
Instead, a Christmas miracle: “Right, clothes off.”
He remembered it all too well. The falling. Watching his friend tumble to his death and not being able to do a damn thing to save him. Sherlock, goodness it pained John to even think of his name, was gone. For all intents and purposes he had given up on life. He'd given up on John.
“Mediocre hug, brother mine, though the sentiment is appreciated. Thank you for actually coming, Mycroft,” He smiled at him. “Come on inside. John and I are about to cut the cake.” He winked at his brother, quickly observing that Mycroft was looking much better than he had during the whole Eurus debacle.
Sherlock staggered outside, struggling to stay on his feet. The alcohol was stronger than usual apparently. His motor skills were clearly lacking, that was why he never drank. It postponed and sometimes even dulled out thinking completely. And this was one of those times.
"I got you out!"
“Sh-Sherlock!” John said, chuckling softly, but the look on Sherlock’s face wasn’t friendly. All it revealed was a hunger. A hunger to get John back for embarrassing him in front of everyone.
“That thing you did just now,” Sherlock scratched the back of his head, anxious as he spoke, “Is that a thing commonly done in movie theaters?”
“Sher- no, never mind. Just, come on Sherlock. Please. For me?”
John had a new plan this time. Oh yes, the chloroform soaked cloth was ready in his hand. He'd take the victim back to his place for an... experiment of sorts before carving their guts with the usual message. He growled to himself as he noticed a familiar looking stature nearby. Black curls, tall and lean. Their back was turned, and he couldn't tell, but even the slightest resemblance to that heinous man-made John seethe with rage. That would be his next victim. John would wait for the man to walk outside… be alone. Yes, that was the most opportune time to do such a thing. All he had to do was wait. John walked up to the bar and grumbled to the barkeeper to give him a pint. Might as well use the time he had.
“Don’t change the subject. This was one of the most foolish things you’ve ever done. It’s fucking freezing out here, Sherlock!”
John was equally as horrified at this entire series of unfortunate events, and berated himself for not cutting the kiss short and giving Sherlock at least one of his layers of clothing. This was one of the worst things that had ever happened to the pair of them.
Sherlock came to, and every part of his body ached. It felt worse than the time in Serbia. He looked around himself. Piles of pallets were everywhere. A warehouse then. It was dark, but there was a small table illuminated in front of him. It was blurry, and he blinked a few times to clear up the vision. A man sat at the table, a cruel look on his face. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and then they suddenly widened. Of course it was John. He was about to speak but found it incredibly difficult. And then he realized why, his mouth was gagged. Further observation showed that his arms were tied behind him. He was tied to a chair and John Watson was sitting across from him. Any other time it would have been kinky, but this was not the John Watson he knew.
"John, I'm.. uh… not dead."
“Sherlock, what the hell were you thinking?” John berated immediately, grabbing his hand and dragging him away from the river. Sherlock’s eyes widened as John nearly hauled him off his feet. His normally majestic Belstaff was limp and soaked, trailing water everywhere. His normally luscious, bouncy curls were pasted flat against his alabaster flesh, which to John was starting to look a pallid blue color, and that worried him.
Greg just shook his head, avoiding looking into his rear-view mirror at all costs. “You guys want a ride home?” Anything to avoid the awkward situation, he thought. “I know you normally take a cab, but I don’t think they would take you like that.”
John mentally kicked himself for side tracking from trying to cheer himself up. He'd gotten away with so many killings, and being on the lam was one hell of a thrill. Soon he'd get even more unwanted attention, and he'd start going after the people he used to hold most dear.
, John thought,
John didn't believe a word of his rubbish about being a fraud, about inventing the consulting criminal, about any of it. He never would believe it. Only one man could be that clever. And that was… him.
Sherlock stood in the hallway for a long while, trying to comprehend what John had just said. Once it finally clicked, and his demeanor made sense to the detective, Sherlock bolted for his own coat and shoes. In fact, he beat John downstairs to hail a taxi.
John Watson had changed. And not for the better. Two years had passed since that fateful day at St. Bart's. His mind was warped past all normal function. He'd turned. If London thought Moriarty was a worthy adversary, they had another thing coming. And he was just getting started.
Sherlock smirked at his brother. “John, would you excuse us a moment?” John furrowed his brow. “Hurry up, Sherlock. We have to cut the cake soon.” He wandered off to mingle, planting a sweet kiss on his husband’s lips as he trailed away.
Sherlock visibly relaxed and was about to reply, but his phone started ringing. He frowned and met John’s gaze as he withdrew the mobile device from his inside jacket pocket. “It’s Lestrade.” He said.
“Shut up, Sherlock.” John said, and to reinforce his order, he kissed his boyfriend. Sherlock soon became warm, indeed. John wasn’t really focusing on the kiss, but rather transferring his own body heat to his boyfriend. He rubbed his hands all over his body, holding him close. So what if they both enjoyed the contact more than what should have been appropriate in a public setting?
Mycroft almost handed over another file, but he stopped. Sherlock deduced the action as hesitant and was confused as to why. He held out a hand and snarled a little when Mycroft pulled it away from him. "About that…"
As they continued questioning him, he merely deduced that the man's wife was cheating on him with the coffin maker next door, and that if he headed home now he would catch them at it. The man-made a beeline for the door, tossing his makeshift beating stick, which happened to be a lead pipe, aside. The green coat man spoke a few words, before getting to his feet and deciding to grab a handful of the fake hair that covered the man's head. "Now listen to me." Mycroft Holmes snarled in the ear. "There is something new back in London. It's dangerous. And you're needed. Sorry, but the holiday is over. Back to Baker Street, Sherlock Holmes." He sneered the name, and his younger brother didn't move a muscle, except for the slightest twitch of his lips in a smirk.
Mycroft glanced at him. Sherlock rolled his eyes. "What is the signature?"
John furrowed his brow. If Lestrade was calling, that meant work. And Sherlock wasn’t answering it? “Well?”
This called for desperate measures. John needed to be shocked right out of this madness. Luckily he'd never claimed his feelings for the man before. He doubted John felt the same way anyhow. Sherlock glanced at him. "I know this isn't you John, please. This isn't the John Watson I fell in love with…"
"Sherlock you can't just go barging in. It's not John anymore. There's nothing left of the man you once called your friend." Mycroft insisted. His little brother needed to see reason.
Sherlock didn't want to beg, but he had to do something. "Please John!" Nothing. The man came closer, the knife raised again. "Please…" He choked back a sob.
“That wasn’t for me, Sherlock. That was bloody grocery shopping. That I did. For the both of us.”
"It's… complicated, Sherlock. A serial killer. Only his patterns constantly differ. The only thing that is similar every time is the signature he leaves upon the victim's bodies." Sherlock got to his feet, wincing from near on being beaten to a pulp. He walked to his brother's desk, eyebrow piqued. It was intriguing.
Sherlock would never admit that he’d secretly enjoyed being a part of such a tradition with John Watson of all people, but sometimes he just had to save face.
John felt himself grow angry for the umpteenth time that morning and he threw the knife down on the ground, the blood spilled all over his hands from yet another victim. He didn't know their name and he didn't care. Remembering names caused him too much pain. And he'd grown past the point of caring. His best friend was dead. He had nothing left to live for.
The taller man looked up at John. “You really want to know?”
Sherlock felt his eyes mist with tears and he immediately fought them back. Emotions caused mistakes. Just treat it as another case. Cross that bridge when they got to it, and probably burn it in the process. "Mycroft, you have been keeping tabs on him. Where is he?"
John waited. His brilliance was all a waiting game. Perfect timing and planning were a must. He fished what he needed out of his pocket, a small pill that when dropped into the detective's drink… oh the detective would be rambling on and on about god knows what and he would be vulnerable. And John would have his revenge. It was almost too simple.
"John these detrimental effects can be reversed. Don't do this…" Sherlock winced as yet another cut was made. John stopped for a minute.
The shaggy, long-haired man dashed through the forest, trying to avoid the guards that were stationed everywhere. However, he'd been discovered. There was no stopping that now. His long legs carried him as fast as he could go, but the guards were advancing. The man heard the noise of a helicopter above him and soon, a spotlight being shone right on his back. He heard the cocking of guns and his chest heaved, breathless. He dropped to his knees and remembered only the ground reaching out to meet him.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes, Jawn…" John smirked to himself. Oh he was going to enjoy this.
"Didn't I just tell you to shut up?" He hauled Sherlock into another kiss and they stayed there like that for a while before John ended it. "Of course, Sherlock. I've always had those feelings, and I am so sorry… I will do whatever it takes to make it up to you."
The ex-army soldier had gone insane. He was no longer the John Watson that everyone used to know. The loyal man was gone, and in his place, a monster had arisen. A beast clad in all black that cared about nothing more than the next victim. Because he was a man who had nothing to lose, and there was only satisfaction to be gained in these acts.
“You wanted milk. So you got milk. I don’t see –
"I always figured you were still alive. The first few months, I held onto the hope that I hadn't lost you. But now I don't care. What I do care about… is how this knife is going to look when it carves through that delightful alabaster flesh…" He brandished the knife in Sherlock's direction, snarling in delight.
Sherlock's eyes were pleading for the real John Watson to appear out of this monstrosity sometime soon, but he a feeling that wasn't going to happen. As the knife hovered next to his cheek, he stared down the man before him. "John, stop… this isn't you."
The day had finally arrived. The church service had gone smoothly; Sherlock only made one atheist rant the whole while. Now though, the reception was in full swing, with the newlyweds seated at the head table. The speeches were done, and people had toasted them. John drew Sherlock into a sweet kiss, which resulted in whooping and cheering from the crowd of their friends who had been relieved that the two idiots finally got together. It had been so obvious it was painful.
John laughed and crouched down enough to be in his face. "Sherlock, you did this to me. I waited. And waited. I thought you were dead. I had nothing else to live for. So I finally said to hell with it and I began plotting. Oh, how I plotted. You have no idea what I have done, Sherlock. Two years of planning…" John licked his lips in a savory yet insane manner. "It took me longer than it would have taken your brilliant mind, sure. But I did it. What was the one way to get you to come back from the dead? What would get you to come back and play? Eh, being a serial killer? 'The game is on, Sherly…' And nothing you do will stop what I am about to do to you." He pressed the blade against Sherlock's face.
But, as it goes when one has a tongue down one’s throat, Sherlock Holmes couldn’t have cared less about correcting the film. The night certainly wasn’t dull. Or boring. Or even remotely predictable.
It didn’t take long for Sherlock to apprehend the perpetrator, and although he was as jittery as a jackhammer, he still managed to swim back to shore, murderer in tow, quite gracefully. As soon as the younger Holmes and his prize were within reach of John, the army doctor reached out for the murderer, freeing his boyfriend of his rather cumbersome load and shoving him in the direction of an awaiting Detective Inspector.
John shook his head and finished his pint before heading to the washroom. He glanced at his hands. God, how he had changed. The tremor is his left hand was gone, he was constantly under stress and duress and he fucking loved it. The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through his veins as he hunted out his victim. He chuckled to himself at the change he'd made to his old friend's saying. When he came back out, Sherlock had moved to the bar. The man didn't drink and John knew that. Well, he seldom drank. And apparently this was one of those opportune moments, for Holmes was ordering a pint and nursing apparent alcoholism. Or so it seemed.
Sherlock glanced up, trying to read his intentions, but he didn't have time for that. He felt his head being jerked upward and suddenly his lips were being assaulted by more lips and he didn't know what to do but he wanted this so badly, but this wasn't his John. It was wrong. He pulled away, but the cruel man only pressured on, keeping Sherlock right where he wanted him. Sherlock whimpered softly and John let up. There was a different glint in his eyes. A glint of lust. Sherlock knew what was going to happen now, and he was terrified. "John! Stop! Please I know that you're still in there somewhere… you can't be gone completely…"
“”M f-f-f-ine.” The detective said, his words punctuated by the still-chattering teeth. Truth be told, Sherlock was rather regretting how painfully cold he was in that moment.
Sherlock seemed slightly upset during the reception, though. John noticed this and confronted him about it. “You okay, Sherlock?” The concern in his voice was evident, his love for the detective even more so. He reached out and grasped Sherlock’s hand, his thumb caressing the back of it with gentle circles.
"Oh for heaven's sake… you're crying? Christ, Sherlock. Learn to take it like a man…" John laughed to himself again. "Actually… you know what, I have a different idea."
HOW WAS HE ALIVE. HE JUMPED OFF A BLOODY BUILDING.
Of course, that was before John failed to inform him of one particular wedding tradition. Well, he did inform him of it, by shoving a chunk of sponge cake right against Sherlock’s cheek, some of the icing smearing against his lip and nose. The detective looked devastated, and everyone in the crowd laughed.
That made John stop. The grip on the knife slackened, his hand falling to his side as he took a few steps. His back was turned to the detective, and his thoughts were reeling. 'He's lying. He doesn't feel that way. He never has. There was never anything there. He doesn't feel things that way.' And yet, 'He just confessed to being in love with me! Sherlock Holmes, with me! Ha! I knew he felt the same! I just knew it!' And John suppressed those feelings right then and there. He wasn't that man anymore. He'd never be that John Watson again. John turned to face the detective once more. "Enough of your lies. I should just kill you now… but there's no fun in that. Not when there's so much left to do…"
“Right, let’s get you warmed up, love.” John said. Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
Watson laughed again. It was a maniacal laugh and it frightened Sherlock to see him like this. "Oh Sherlock! You finally come back! Bet this wasn't what you were expecting was it! When your big brother told you a big bad man was wreaking havoc in London. You certainly didn't expect wee little John Watson to be behind it all. No, John Watson isn't capable of that. The soldier boy, he wouldn't harm a flea unless that flea harmed his Sherlock first." Another laugh escaped him and he stared at the detective.
Sherlock immediately thought the worst. "Is John dead?"
The older brother chuckled and shook his head, twirling his umbrella as he walked back inside with his brother.
Before John could protest further, Sherlock was pushing up against him, his still cake-flavored lips pressed tightly against his husband’s. John scrabbled to recover and reciprocate, flailing for a moment before Sherlock caught his hands and pinned them above the smaller man’s head.
John growled to himself, walking over to the table and picked up another knife with a gloved hand. He ran a finger down the blade, holding it up to the light and watching as the beams glinted off the steel. Soon…very soon. His lips curled into a malevolent smirk as he thought of the idea of taking another life. Oh, he would have loved trying to solve these cases. John never left a scrap of evidence. That was the thing about working with a sociopathic consulting detective. You always knew the best way to carry out a murder. And the knife… well that was just a personal touch, with a special signature just for the Yard…
John didn't reply. He buried his face in Sherlock's neck and cried. Sherlock thought this was insane, but this was clearly his John. He winced at the pain in his face but he just stayed there and held John. Eventually the small man calmed down, his shuddering had stopped.
John kissed him back, putting his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and pressing forward, breathing him in. He broke the kiss and put his forehead on the crook of Sherlock’s neck, squeezing his eyes shut so he wouldn’t have to see Sherlock’s face. There’s a specific kind of raw internal pain that came from being confused and guilty, and not knowing how to express it. Like a cold spider in his chest, twisting and turning, spreading out and taking over. John’s throat hurt and he wanted to sob and scream and throw things, but all he could do was sit there, worry, and try not to cry.
“Generally, it can take years to adopt a child, but Oliver’s already been with you over a year. You have direct correlation with his legal guardians, and I work in the government,” Mycroft explained. “If you’re truly serious about it, I can go about switching his guardianship to you without much of a hassle. It may take a month or two to get all the paperwork.”
The situation with Molly was similar to Harry. Molly had tried calling him in the weeks preceding Sherlock’s death, but he never answered. John glanced at the clock, and figuring she’d be out of work by now, swallowed his anxiety and called her.
A few days before, gifts had come for Oliver from the Holmes family and John received somethings from his sister and mother as well.
John leaned his cane against the counter and held out his hands, “Let me see.”
At almost five at night on a Friday, John realized Oliver should have been home over an hour ago - he didn’t have club today. Did he stay for a study hall or have detention? John checked his phone but didn’t see any calls. All right. Maybe Oliver just forgot to call? How long does detention last? Were phones allowed in detention? Probably not. Would the school call him if they kept Oliver late? Probably.
“Have you thought about returning to work?” asked Ella.
“I don’t think so. Those were to only people who really messed with me,” Oliver said.
“Thank you for having us over, John,” Molly said. “I had fun.”
The wonderful Bellefant did some
“What’s that?”
“Someone’s… spying on us?”
John nodded.
It wasn’t until after sunset, a full day of doing nothing but guilty drinking (as much as he knew he shouldn’t and tried not to) he got a text from Mycroft, simply stating “
Oliver’s face turned a touch pink. “Yes.”
”. John felt relief roll off him in waves and he stood from the couch and partially stumbled into the kitchen, using a swipe of his hand to push the beer cans on the table into the trash. He bent over the sink, splashing water on his face to try and bring himself back to life. He wasn’t drunk, but he was on his way there and Mycroft would no doubt immediately know, but he might as well make the effort to appear responsible.
I need to know if you prefer to read the dialogue in French and have the translation of the scene in the notes at the end of the chapter, OR if you'd prefer to read it in
“Oliver-”
-I did, in fact, get the name Oliver from Nature and Nurture (and a few other fics as well) because I just can't picture a child of Sherlock's with any other name.
John had work on Monday, at eight, which he didn’t mind. At least it wasn’t the opening shift. Oliver was already in the living room when John stepped out of the bathroom, hair still wet and dressed in a soft green jumper.
Unlike Mycroft’s and Oliver’s rooms, which had been cleaned up a bit, Sherlock’s screamed that someone had been in the middle of their life and had gotten up and left without planning on it. John didn’t know a lot about Sherlock’s childhood or what he had done before becoming a detective, but his gut told him that it wasn’t anything good that drove Sherlock from the middle of his life.
John nodded, feeling like there was more to it. “Okay, tell her I said hello.”
When John felt like they aren’t going to find anything else, they left Oliver’s room. It’s almost open visiting hours for the hospital, and something occurred to John.
Another silent moment passed. John was getting sick of the quiet.
The last few days leading up to the end of the month passed slowly, and John and Sherlock decided to start searching the flat every few days, so they might be able to pinpoint a time the bugs are being planted. They found some more, but it was way less than the last time and everyone still looked uneasy after finding them.
“I should get back to the hotel,” Harry said, standing up and cracking her back.
John hadn’t even thought of this. He sighed and caught Mycroft’s eye, but couldn’t tell what the man was thinking. Oliver finally liked school, which felt like a feat in itself, and they didn’t even think about how switching Oliver’s school would effect him.
,” he made quotes with his fingers, “to spy on Holmes.”
climbed up the back of his throat, and he swallowed it like a rock. It settled in his stomach, cold and heavy and he left the coffee shop feeling detached.
Oliver slammed the door shut behind him on purpose, his phone already to his ear. Caden answered on the second ring, and Oliver asked, “Can I come over?”
John kept rubbing soothing circles on Oliver’s back. “It’s because you were were hyperventilating, and all the oxygen was coming and going before it could circulate.”
“Oh, I’d love to,” Harry said. “I’d have to find a place to stay the night, but that shouldn’t be too hard in London.”
its a month late
Emily’s face changed in the blink of an eye, and she scowled at him. “Your stupid hair is in the way, and I can’t see what you’re doing.”
“How did you meet Sherlock?”
Mycroft sighed, “He’s rather good at avoiding CCTV and populated areas. We had eyes on him about half an hour ago, but lost him again.”
He froze when he saw Oliver, squatting in the middle of the floor, his arms wrapped around his legs and his forehead pressed onto his knees. He struggled for breath and with each forced exhale, John could see his entire body shaking. Panic attack. John hadn’t seen Oliver actually have one before - he usually locked himself in his room, but he knew what they looked like from experience.
Somewhat of a depressing chapter... but it had to happen sooner or later.
“Listen, um, I’ve talked with Mycroft and he’s found a school he’ll transfer you too,” John started. “It’s a bit of a longer walk, but we can arrange a car or something. Mycroft has all the papers together and you can start soon.”
, pulling John into a hug and all but jumping up and down, saying how happy she was that it would be official.
“You too,” she said.
“You won’t be bothered anymore?”
“You have to tell me why!” Sherlock shouted. “Tell why you won’t get angry with me, because I keep getting mixed signals from you!”
“I’ve already cleared Sherlock’s room for him,” John said, running his hand through his hair. He leg started to ache. “If he wants to be here, I’ll have him.”
Sorry, I missed my deadline by a few hours, but I don't think many of you will notice... DX I'm developing carpal tunnel in my left wrist (I'm not even a legal adult yet I'm too young for this and very upset gah) and editing this chapter was a pain to get through, so point out any typos you see please!
“Does it sting?” John asked. The water ran clear after a moment and he turned off the tap, watching to see if it bled more.
Oliver mussed his hair and swung his bag around onto his back. “It’s okay.”
John set the drawing on the coffee table so it wouldn’t get damaged and reached under the couch to pull out his gift for Oliver. He hefted up the long package and held it out to Oliver, who took it with wide eyes.
“All right,” John worried his lip between his teeth. “Thank you Mycroft.”
,” Oliver mumbled, then took a deep breath. “I want - will you… adopt me?”
Molly hesitated, her eyes flicking to Emily, who stood next to her, looking around absently. John realized she probably didn’t want her niece listening in on such a sensitive topic.
He continued pacing the flat, not even hearing John as he waved his hands around, just talking to himself. “
Oliver nodded. “I’m going to.”
Violet frowned and looked at Sigar. “Is everything all right?”
Oliver felt the world stop spinning, and there was nothing in the universe but him, Caden, and tiny little things flashing through his mind from the past few months. “The cameras…”
John and Sherlock’s fight ran out of steam after almost an hour of stomping around and shouting about anything and everything. Now they sat up in 221B, at opposite ends of the couch, not talking. It was awful.
’, well I don’t care! He obviously didn’t care enough about me, so why do I have to hear about
“He can start in two weeks, if he decides to go,” Mycroft said.
John sighed, and sat forward. “Why don’t you do your schoolwork?”
“Nothing,” Oliver half shrugged. “It’s boring.”
“No, but when I was little grandmother hosted a lot of parties so the house was always busy,” Oliver said, pushing open one of the doors. “You can stay in this room.”
He washed his and Oliver’s mugs, then took a quick shower and got dressed. He actually had an agenda today. Weird. Also good. First he had therapy, and after he’d need to do some shopping. They lasted the weekend with the very little food in the flat (it helped that Mrs Hudson insisted on bringing lunch up to them) but they would not survive the week on takeout and canned corn, unfortunately. They were in desperate need of actual food. He made a quick list of the essentials, then caught a cab to his therapy session.
Mycroft sighed, “If you’re sure, I’ll cancel the paperwork I sent to the other academy.”
Oliver checked the time on his phone, surprised to see it was already one in the afternoon. Him and his friends were sitting on the roof of the warehouse, after messing around inside for a few hours and looking around on each floor. Now he sat next to Caden, who was laying back with his hands behind his head and his eyes closed. Emily was sitting on the ledge, swinging her feet and watching the sky.
Mycroft made an amused noise. “I’m listening.”
“Oliver. Oliver, you need to try and control your breathing or you’ll pass out.”
"Je ne comprends pas comment quelqu'un peut être - alors…" means "I do not understand how anyone can be - so ..."
Oliver fidgeted with his hands, his lips in a thin line. “I - I won’t,” he swallowed. “I’m not going to do it again.”
The second fic is only 4 chapters long and all four will be posted at the same time (I've already written them).
So I guess I like... graduated high school last week. I've been told that's pretty cool.
“That’s a lovely idea,” John said. “I can talk to Oliver about it.”
“He changed so much the past few years and was so quiet and reserved. I don’t know what happened and we were so worried. That’s why we thought he needed a change of scenery,” she sighed and tilted her head, looking out the window. “It’s nice he’s opening up. He finally looks happy again.”
too.”
As I'm already writing the third fic, hopefully buy the time you guys get there I'll be doing two updates a week. Please stick with me, and I love all your support!!
Yikes. So... this isn't even the worst of it...
Harry waved her hand. “I’ll be fine, it’s barely a five minute walk from here. Besides, I like the snow.”
John frowned, “It’s not-”
John shot awake hours later with a pulsing headache. He checked his phone, saw the time nearing ten in the morning. He felt awful, like he had swallowed a swamp tried to sweat it out. Before he got in the shower he called Mycroft, antsy for information. Oliver obviously hadn’t been brought home last night, but maybe Mycroft had him anyways.
“You can stay home from school today if you’d like,” he offered. “I don’t know how I feel about you being around those boys after last night.”
“That would be lovely,” John said. “I’m sure Oliver would enjoy it. I can image he gets homesick.”
“He’s a teenager,” John said, staring out the doorway Oliver had disappeared though. “It’s a striking resemblance.”
Then finally he got someone who managed Oliver’s schedule to listen to the idea Oliver had. John explained that he knew Oliver was smart, and the school must know too if they allowed him into a higher grade. They worked out that if Oliver raised his marks and kept them up until after the holidays, Oliver’s advisor would work with his teachers to accommodate the way Oliver learns. Relief washed over him at hearing that, and couldn’t wait to go tell Oliver.
It faded away after Mrs Hudson helped John get out the food and drinks. Lestrade’s loud laugh filled the air next to Mycroft’s balanced tone, Harry’s snark and Molly’s giggle. John checked on Oliver a few times, but he didn’t seem very interested in joining the conversation, opting for looking out the window or talking quietly to Mrs Hudson.
Please leave your thoughts below! Reviews are what keep my motivation up and my updates consistent!
John grabbed a glass and filled it for him, then pressed it into his hands and gave him some ibuprofen, telling him he should probably lay down.
The next chapter will be out on
“Ah - no,” John felt his face warm. “He’s sleeping on the couch tonight, but he can’t stay there.”
Sherlock stepped back and put his hands on John’s shoulders. “Not everything is awful. We’re all together, right?”
“Bye, then.”
“All right, Oliver,” She said, way too excited. “You’re set to go home as long as you take it easy for the next week. No long walks, running, lifting. After you start to feel your energy return, you can do a bit more but wait on any strenuous activity until you see your stitches dissolve.  Doctor Watson played a big part in getting you out early, so he’ll be overseeing your care, but I’m sure you expected that.”
Oliver shook his head.
Oliver fell asleep after that, and as much as John hated leaving him, they went home. John would see him again tomorrow, and Oliver would be more awake then. The cab ride home was quiet, and John’s leg bounced involuntarily the whole time. He glanced at Sherlock, who was looking out the window, face unreadable.
In his hands, he played with a pack of cigarettes and a lighter that Caden gave him a few days ago. The pack is full, because he hasn’t smoked at all unless he’s with Caden - because he
She set a plastic bag of groceries on the table, and pulled out a carton of eggs and package of bacon. “You’re fridge is empty, and I figured you’d enjoy a good breakfast since you have company now.”
Oliver raised an eyebrow, but leaned forward and gave her hand a firm shake, “Oliver.” He looked her over in the same way she did him. Lighter hair than Molly’s, held back off her face in a ponytail, unfortunately the same height as himself and her skin a few shades tanner (probably from her father, as Molly looked relatively fair skinned, so her sister should be too). She reminded Oliver of all the girls in his year who had high pitched laughs, chewed too much gum and texted under the table during class.
Sherlock shut his eyes and rubbed his face. “Moriarty arranged a sniper to be on Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and you at all times. The only way to recall them was if they saw me jump. I figured Moriarty must have some kind of other recall code, just in case things went wrong, but before I could get anything from him he shot himself in the head. I
John shook his head, Oliver’s face still squashed into his chest. “I think we’ll be fine.”
Sherlock looked frustrated, but nodded anyways, pulling his phone out - probably to text Mycroft.
“Getting worked up about it isn’t going to help,” John said.
John sat back in his chair, mentally adding that to a list of things to do. If it helped Oliver enjoy school and do better, John would get him there.
Oliver snarled. “You’re a machine! Can
“Constantly.” John answered. “Do you?
He smiled, “How’ve you been, Har?” She grins, white teeth showing, practically bubbling over with excitement. He knows she wants to tell him all about the wedding planning and everything.
Later into the night while he was talking to a few people he knew from Bart’s, someone tugged his sleeve and he turned to see Emily, fidgeting with her hands and looking nervous.
John had promised Harry he’d go to lunch with her on Thursday, so he took an hour off for lunch at work to meet her. She’d picked a quaint sandwich shop with a low flow of customers. When Johns stepped in, Harry was already seated by the window, and just seeing her lifted his mood a bit. John did miss his sister, and he was happy everytime he saw her because of how much she’s cleaned herself up over the years.
John could feel the hurt rising back up in his chest. “But you couldn’t trust
“You know I -” Sherlock cleared his throat. “I’ve never - I don’t know much about him.”
“You should… be put back on for legal guardianship of Oliver,” John said. “So if - God forbid - anything happens again in the future, you can provide legal signatures, permission and see him in emergencies.”
John leaned into the livingroom. “Oliver? Oliver.”
Sherlock’s hand crept into John’s vision, and two pale fingers tugged at the cuff of his sleeve, begging for a reaction. “I missed you terribly.”
Oliver didn’t answer. He didn’t even look at John.
“They weren’t even there when I woke up,” Oliver said, feeling angry. John made a big deal about it last night, but how bad could it actually be if he didn’t stay home? “They were probably on a case. It doesn’t matter.”
After that conversation, the tension melted away and things were getting better. John found it easier to talk to Oliver, and Oliver opened up more to John. On Saturday John brought Oliver with him to do the shopping so he could help pick out meals for the week instead of just writing it down for John to find.
Oliver immediately jerked away and snapped, “
“If you do decided to go through with it, I’d be delighted to come,” Lestrade said. “Have you spoken to anyone else recently? Your sister? I know Molly mentioned she tried calling you months ago and you never answered.”
“I know but I don’t want to always depend on medication to function.”
The boy’s eyes lit up. “You said yes?”
Oliver,” breathed John. He reached out and yanked Oliver forward, crushing him into a hug. Oliver gasped, his body stiff, before relaxing and slowly hugging John back, burying his face in John’s chest.
As soon as he pushed the door to 221B open, Oliver scowled, his arms crossed. Sherlock still sat at the desk, but now he looked alert and watched John step into the flat behind Oliver. Nobody said anything.
my parent.” Oliver snarled at him. John leaned back as if struck, and Oliver swung around and ran from the flat, the front door rattling when he slammed it behind him.
Their conversation wrapped up quickly, and John ended the call, elated to be able to see his sister again, it’d been over a year since their last face to face meeting and Harry had been sporting a bad hangover at the time. After he hung up, he sent a text to Lestrade, then after a moment of consideration, to Mycroft to see if they’d like to visit on New Year’s Eve. He knew Mrs Hudson would be delighted, and the only other person he’d like to invite was Molly.
He put it all in a basket, and left it in the living room. He’d bring it to Mrs Hudson in the morning - he didn’t feel like answering her inevitable questions.
The thing is, Oliver wants to forgive him. He wants things to just go back to having fun with Caden and ignoring everything at home. But John’s message said he didn’t want Oliver going out today.
The flat didn’t have space for a tree, but John and Oliver cleared off the desk enough to put a small decorative one on it under the animal skull, and it glowed with tiny lights. Mrs Hudson came upstairs with them and John lit the fire. The inches of snow outside gave the flat a bit of a chill and they welcomed the warmth of the fire.
There. Oliver had his back against the railing, and three taller boys were harassing him, pulling at his shirt, shoving him around and tugging at his hair. Oliver was trying to push them away, shielding his face, but they were laughing and kept him cornered.
"Sherlock you bastard, I thought you were dead. I'm… I'm so sorry.. I lost control. I couldn't take it. I watched you fall off the rooftop. I watched you fall to your death…" John quickly untied Sherlock and slumped to his knees, shaking and shuddering in despair. He had hurt Sherlock just because Sherlock had hurt him. He felt tears prick his eyes, and he soon felt arms around him. "John… John I'm here… I'm never leaving again…"
John’s eyes widened in surprise as he was yanked close, but relished in the kiss. The cake was exquisite, but it was nothing compared to how the detective himself tasted. Sherlock held him there for several moments and then let go, smirking at him. “This isn’t over, John.” He purred in his ear, then continued serving cake.
Mycroft rolled his eyes this time. "Obviously, brother dear. They just discovered another body last night. Lestrade has the details. He doesn't know you've returned."
Then, a deep, drawn out sigh was heard from the shadows nearby. “You know, Dr Holmes-Watson, I really do despise this idea of yours.” Mycroft Holmes said, stepping forward. He stood there a bit longer, an annoyed expression on his face. He twirled his umbrella a moment and then looked at his brother. “Surprise, Sherlock. Congratulations to the happy couple. Cheers. These sentiments are tedious. Can we please get on with this?”
John hitched a breath at the tone of Sherlock’s voice, but he carried on plating slices like nothing had happened. Once he was done, he covertly adjusted his trousers, which had suddenly become rather tight.
John cut him off by smashing his lips against Sherlock’s, shoving the detective against the wall behind him. “You know, for a genius, you are an idiot sometimes. But I love you for it.”
Mycroft proffered a hand to his brother. Sherlock stared at it, his eyes narrowed in confusion.
The elder Holmes sighed again. "Sherlock… all I'm saying is that John is alive. He is unwell. Your 'death' caused him to go mad. He is the serial killer I am referring to."
"Ha! You still think I'm a doctor. Sure… I'll fix all your wounds right after I create them, Sherlock Holmes. And then we can start allllllllll over." He slammed his hands down on the table and snarled. "You aren't getting out of this one, Holmes. There's no one around to hear you scream. Except me. And I'll be looking forward to every. Single. One." John stared up at him and got to his feet, throwing the table out of the way in rage and storming over to Sherlock. The detective slunk away slightly. The knife appeared in one of John's hands and was right next to Sherlock's face.
“Well he is busy running the country, love.” John said rather casually. Sherlock noticed, but paid no mind to it for the time being. He had other things on his mind.
Mycroft kept calm, no matter how much he wanted to slam his brother's face into a wall. Sherlock sat up, brushing away from the person shaving his face. "Well?"
"I got me out."
The woman he almost married had been the first one to go. He growled to himself delightfully at the thought… she bloody deserved it for trying to replace… him… so soon. That was the only victim he knew the name of. But that would soon change. All of them would have to go because if he had to live without him, they couldn't live at all.
John almost laughed to himself as he watched the man become slowly more deterred and confused. He knew the detective couldn't retain liquor very well, but even this was pushing it. However, as Sherlock's rambling became more and more rowdy the bartender told him to get out, and Sherlock stumbled to the door. The drugs were clearly having and effect and John smiled again. He ran his fingers over the weapon in his hand. Soon… but he'd have his fun with this one first. This one had caused him all the pain, and he was going to do the same to him: Sherlock Holmes.
But he didn’t answer it.
“Naturally, brother mine.” Mycroft said with a chuckle. “I do suppose proper congratulations are in order. I’ve had yours and John’s gift delivered directly to Baker Street, as I did not want to lug it here. But anyway. I, um. I’m going to do something that I’ve never done before, Sherlock.”
John decided to put on the accent again, just for fun. "Oi mate! Need some help keepin' upright?" He laughed and generously offered Sherlock a shoulder to lean on.
"I'm not going to kill you just yet, love. First, I have something special in mind!" Sherlock's eyes widened as his shirt was suddenly torn open, buttons clicking against the concrete floor. John's hands touched his bare flesh and he shuddered, but it wasn't all bad.
John sipped the beer, tossing a note in the bartender's direction. He kept a watchful eye on the curly-haired man, his eyes constantly scanning the room for other potential problems. And problem it was; because forget the man who looked like that bastard, the real thing had just walked in the door. The incandescent eyes, the unruly curls, the lanky body that was as skinny as a rake, and those cheekbones… those god damned cheekbones that were so high and so sharp… John felt himself losing focus and he growled, rage replacing other emotions that tried to make themselves known.
Sherlock Holmes, now completely devoid of all disguises, had just returned to his brother's office and was getting his face shaved at the time, sighed. "So, what is 'new' that you think is so interesting? I was in the middle of something."
John pointed the knife at him in a mocking manner. "Oh, except you of course. Because you're a flawless genius junkie. Is that it?"
"A small thank you wouldn't go amiss."
John casually flattened his hair and strode to the bar, taking the stool next to the detective. He didn't glance over, and he didn't move. He only ordered a pint in a Scottish accent. Surely the genius would have noticed him by now. He had to have noticed him. This was Sherlock Holmes he was dealing with, and not some average Scotland Yard idiot.
As for Sherlock and John, everything went back to normal. Well, as normal as it could get in 221B. Sherlock got chewed out for faking his death, and John vowed to never kill anyone again. Shame, that probably wouldn't last in their line of work, but John would never go back to that lifestyle. He had his Sherlock, and for once the soldier was at peace.
"Th-thanks…" Sherlock slurred, practically throwing his weight against John. It sent the other man tumbling sideways, but he caught Sherlock and Holmes met eyes with him for a moment. He swore and shoved him alongside him as he walked. "Let's get you home, yeah?"
Only, they didn’t stop there.
“Sherlock Holmes, how many times have we done things that you enjoy?”
"John?"
"No shit, Sherlock. Shut up or you might be."
“Oh relax, Lestrade. You’ve seen a naked Holmes before. The next time you’re in the middle of plowing my brother, make sure when he answers the call it isn’t myself as intermediary for the Prime Minister, who happened to be in the same room.” Sherlock snapped, reaching out to open the door. Only there was just one problem: they were in the back of a police car, and those doors could only be opened from the outside.
John glanced at the knife in his hand and then at the cuts on Sherlock's face. The weapon slowly slipped through his fingers and clattered to the floor. "Sh-Sherlock… oh my, oh dear god…"
John, although worried about his boyfriend, still couldn’t resist admiring the newly unwrapped scene before him. Christmas really had come early. He shook those thoughts away.
“Oi, what the fuck guys!” Lestrade said, accidentally yelling the remark into the receiver of his mobile. Sherlock, as bare as he had been upon coming into the world, turned a fierce red, his face screwed up in horror. His eyes blew wider than Lestrade’s at the realization of being discovered, and the detective dragged John over the top of himself to allow some cover. In his alarm, he had dragged him right over his lap, John’s face ending up in his crotch. John protested, but Sherlock kept him held there.
Outside, the Holmes brothers leaned against the wall, not looking at each other. “So, this is it then. The big day.” Mycroft said, a certain edge to his voice. “I suppose I won’t be seeing much of you anymore.”
Sherlock Holmes, it didn't hurt to think it anymore when John realized he was still alive. Immediately he was overwrought by more anger.
Holmes glanced at him as he stopped, confused. "Get it over with then. I thought you were going to kill me. Well come on then, do it!" Sherlock shouted at him, growling afterward.
IT WAS ALL LIES.
Mycroft sighed. “For god’s sake, Sherlock. Don’t make this more uncomfortable than it already is. We are brothers after all. And, considering you did save my life from Eurus…” Mycroft waved a hand, dismissing that thought. Sherlock raised a brow, then took the hand. Before he knew it, his elder brother had hauled him into a very awkward hug, but Sherlock returned it nonetheless.“I am very happy you and John finally made it to this point, Sherlock. You deserve it. After… everything.” Mycroft said before drawing away, dusting himself off and straightening his suit. Sherlock laughed.
“Sherlock!” He shouted, but he daren’t go into the water himself. That was fucking stupid. Sherlock
He came back to his senses in a dimly lit prison cell. It was obvious it was in an underground bunker; the moisture that seeped throughout it and the plumbing and wiring that were visible gave that away. The door was locked shut. Not that that mattered. His limbs were pulled taut at his sides by the manacles around his wrists, his bare upper half shone with a glint of sweat from the exertion. He felt nothing but pain as his captor delivered blow after blow to his body while his apparent supervisor in the green over coat merely sat and watched. He didn't give them any satisfaction. He bit back the cries of pain.
“And here I thought you were trying to be a suave romantic, John.” Sherlock said, a hint of a smirk touching his lips.
Sherlock glanced at him. He looked him over. John wasn't bloodthirsty, murderous. He just looked like John. His expression was soft, yet structured. Military. It was his John. Sherlock had done it. He'd fixed him. Well… more or less. Now he was a quivering mess and he couldn't stop shaking. "John…" Before he knew there were arms being thrown around him and squeezing him to the point of suffocation.
John rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t withhold a smile. “Shut up and take your clothes off, you git.”
"What?!" Sherlock snapped. Mycroft sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“He said he’d show up. He’s not here.” Sherlock immediately explained. “Mycroft promised he would be here for the reception, John.”
A chuckle escaped Mycroft’s lips as he stood there. “Yes. They are.” He poked the pavement with his umbrella, unsure of what to say. Well, he knew exactly what to say, but he wasn’t exactly good with this sort of thing.
Sherlock didn't care about Lestrade. There was only person he was concerned with as of now. "And John Watson?"
Before they knew it, the driver’s door to the car opened. John glanced up, horrified, as Greg Lestrade clambered into the car. He had been on the phone, but that stopped when he saw what was going on in his backseat. And when he saw how wet the driver’s seat of his car had become from the dripping Belstaff.
John Watson kept the knife in the pocket of his leather jacket. He was waiting for the most opportune time to find an unsuspecting victim. London was a great cesspool of victims. He need only find the right one, the most desirable one. He growled under his breath as anyone made eye contact with him. He had developed both sociopathic and psychopathic tendencies, and all people repelled him. One in particular, but he was safe because he was dead. Or so John thought.
"No! Although, it would be better if he were." Mycroft felt no remorse in saying it. It was true after all.
“Come on, John! He’s getting away!” Sherlock bellowed, his coat flapping in the wind. John’s feet pounded against the sidewalk, his own coat bundled up tightly. It was fucking freezing outside today, snow gently cascading from the clouds above, blanketing the city in a sheet of white powder.
Nevertheless, John hurried to catch up to his boyfriend, who had just rounded a corner and was now chasing their culprit, who happened to be dressed like Father Christmas—that was the third time this week, for Christ’s sake—right down to the Thames.
John muttered an affirmative and sat up, but Sherlock was still too petrified to speak. Until, of course, Lestrade took them back to Baker Street. Greg accidentally met his gaze in the mirror, and the younger Holmes finally said something.
Sherlock scoffed. He hated this. He hated seeing John this way. "Flawless? Heavens no. Genius? I like to think so. Junkie? Not in awhile. But being one back in the day helped me build immunity to certain date rape drugs, Watson. Even you, as a medical man would know that."
Sherlock watched him. “You know, I wasn’t expecting you to turn up.”
John was in the kitchen making tea when it happened. Sherlock silently approached and grasped him from behind, spinning him around and pinning him up against the fridge.
Sherlock wasn't listening to his brother's complaints. He knew that he could get John to see reason. He just knew. Sherlock was the only one who could even get close to him… he'd have to try.
The black-clad man sneered at Sherlock. "That's all it took to beat you, Holmes. A drug in a beer and a Scottish accent. My you can tell you're slipping." John laughed at his own wit before tearing the gag off Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock looked up at him, a pained expression on his face. "John…"
