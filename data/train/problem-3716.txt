“That sounds nice,” Castiel nodded, his breath whispering over Dean’s ear again. “We haven’t had a social moment with just the two of us in quite some time.”
“Spasms in the flesh of my vessel hold little interest for me in and of themselves, Dean.”
Castiel did as he was told, using his thumb and middle finger to almost break the skin and then twist harshly, crying out as he came dry, his orgasm so intense it veered into pain. He panted into the phone, listening to Dean breathing almost as loud as he was.
That one rippled pleasure throughout his entire body, and he set it aside for later, it was too distracting while he was driving. His mind wandered to Saturday night and made a home there, sighing contentedly.
“Good. Start now.”  Castiel glanced at Dean’s cock meaningfully and Dean gaped at him, wrapped his hand around his cock, and managed half a stroke before he made a strangled noise and let go, his cock twitching dangerously.
Couldn’t be more than a couple hours round trip hoofing it up that hill to the University. There just
“Good night, Dean,” he breathed, still not sure if it was okay to say
“It’s no big deal,” he offered, his voice deep and pleasant. “I’m just glad to be on the team.”
“My resume, Cas. It’s completely fake. I don't know how to do any of the shit I said I do. I’m barely keeping my head above water here, and Zachariah said the big account I just landed this week, the one with six restaurant locations...” Dean shuddered at the recollection, the client had been exceptionally handsy and he had showered a really long time after he got home. “The client specified the deal was contingent on my training him personally on how to use the customer portal. I can't do that Cas, I can barely describe the thing I’m selling!”
don’t. YOU do. You, and Cas, that one time before you frowned at Alex for flirting with him.”
He gulped air and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Come on, Cas,” Dean whispered, his eyes half-lidded. “Let him out to play.”
filled Castiel with a soothing sense of belonging. He accepted a plate solemnly, filled it shamelessly, and when he repaired to the couch because there were only two kitchen chairs, he was secretly touched that Sam and Dean followed him and sat down on either side of him, their shoulders brushing his somehow a comfort.
Dean cleared his throat with difficulty, Castiel’s puzzled stare his only answer.
“I couldn’t say where,” Castiel answered dryly, but I think I could hazard a guess as to
here because I lost.
Castiel couldn’t stop himself; it just came out. “You may call me Daddy if it means that much to you, Dean,” he allowed, his face completely serious, but the bark of pure joy that came bursting out of Dean, his delight pure and contagious, pulled Castiel’s laughter bubbling out of his chest, and that was how Castiel’s software team found them several minutes later, polishing off their beers and giggling like children over their own hilarity.
Dean’s body relaxed into the gold leather of his seat, resigned, but his eyes crinkled and his mouth insolently muttered “You’re not the boss of me.”
“I know,” Dean answered gently. “I’m smarter than I look.” That got at least part of the smile he was hoping for, and he continued softly, only loud enough for Castiel to hear, “I
Frank laughed at Dean’s ignorance, but kindly. “Castiel hasn’t taught you a thing, has he?” he grinned as Dean looked crestfallen.
“All set,” he promised. “Dunno if Diego wants his hose back, but I’ll take it back to him just in case, Okay?”
laugh, and another guy had sounded really bummed out about his ex and Dean had coaxed a better mood out of him before they’d even gotten started on an orgasm.
his grin as if Sam were standing in the same room, and he shook his head fondly. He loved Sam very much and it was sweet to hear Sam say he loved him, even in jest, but the part that really caught his attention, the part that had him leaving his plate untouched and grabbing his phone to drop it on the last step towards the bedroom that got reception, to rush back upstairs and leave the door open while he collapsed back into bed, squirting more lubricant into his palm, was that Dean was in the shower,
“Aww, shit,” Dean exclaimed, “We don’t have any guest towels Cas, I’m sorry. Dish towels okay?” He shuffled his feet dejectedly. Castiel reached into his gym bag, grinning triumphantly, to produce his own towel with a flourish. “BYOT,” he intoned, snapping his towel towards Dean, carefully stopping the snap several inches short of actually connecting with Dean’s dripping anything.
The water started and Castiel did sit, pulling out the other kitchen chair and mulling over the mystery of Dean Winchester as he idly picked at the label on his beer bottle. Why did he live here? Why was he accepted here, safety that extended to a strange man he brought home, apparently. Most intriguing of all for Castiel’s puzzle-solving mind, who slept in that second bed?
The chairs emptied as employees eagerly got up to grab paper plates and pizza. Castiel wondered when was the last time the company had sprung for lunch. He had only been back to work a few months and the lavish Friday lunches he remembered fondly from before the downsizing were certainly a thing of the past.
Ash was all smiles, clapping Dean on the back and hollering “REMATCH, Dean! You were holding out on me! I took it EASY on you!!!” Dean assured him next time he’d go all in, promise. Dean smiled and glad-handed and let the small talk wash over him, but when it died down he finally turned to the face whose steady gaze had not left him once all night, and his smile was soft and shy. “Better?” he asked quietly.
Castiel was floored, watching them. He felt sympathetic nerves over imagining meeting Big Man alone, holding his fate in those giant hands, relief that everything had turned out so well, and a small, unnameable trickle of something wistful. He wondered, for the briefest moment, where his brothers were, before turning his thoughts immediately away, scowling angrily.
“I didn’t mean to let this night end,” Castiel whispered back, and Dean smiled down at him, his face glowing in the soft light.

Dean was so charmed his chest hurt and he whispered to the boys to keep their Dad good company until he could see him again, yawning more and more frequently as they just listened to each other breathe and the music of the fountain until Dean started to snore gently. Castiel whispered goodnight and hung up, trusting Sam to take care of Dean’s phone, which he could almost feel happening as Sam gently pried Dean’s phone from his hand, plugged it in, and pulled a blanket over his brother, still in his dress shirt and slacks.
Dean’s paralysis abruptly came to an end and he surged onto the bed to close his teeth around Castiel’s nipple again, gently lapping at the nub trapped between his teeth, finally working up the balls to unwind the towel from around his waist and drop it, the searing heat of Castiel’s body drawing him inexorably closer until he was halfway wrapped around his friend, leaning on one elbow, increasingly bold fingers tracing the lines of Castiel’s chest and stomach, his cock pressing against Castiel’s hip, Castiel’s body arching against his mouth as he wrapped his lips around Cas’s nipple and just… suckled, sucking and licking and -

“Castiel is fine, Dean.” Castiel’s eyes twinkled with mirth, and Dean actually spit himself a little and had to wipe his mouth with the back of his sleeve, still snickering.

. Anything you want, Cas, I just… I need you to touch me.”
Castiel listened to dead air for a minute while his heart slowed, then he pulled his robe shut with his clean hand and wandered into the kitchen to wash his hands and microwave his dinner again. His body couldn’t decide if it was sated or desperate to go again thinking about Dean in the shower, but that last orgasm had
Castiel leapt to his feet. “Yes, Dean.”
this was dangerous and stupid and they should stop immediately but grinding anyway.
Can you just, please?”
“What happened at work.”
The nest was empty. Or, more accurately, the nest was abandoned and there were no vampires in it, but there were lots and lots and lots of cobwebs and quite a lot of bats sleeping on the ceiling, hanging in orderly rows.
After a moment, Castiel huskily cleared his throat.
Dean studied Castiel’s face, the opportunity to stare with impunity impossible to pass up. Cas looked so much younger asleep - not that he looked old, Dean thought reflexively, refusing to impugn Cas even in his mind, but… there was an innocence to him now, so much less pain written on his forehead and around his softly closed eyes. Dean pushed past the good part of their time in the parking garage, examined the slides that followed, clicking through them like he had on the red plastic Viewmaster 3D Sam had played with as a child, each memory burned as a still image in the round cardboard reel of his mind’s eye. He thought about the look that had flashed over Castiel’s face when the asshole in the truck they hadn’t noticed was occupied had rolled down his window and yelled, “Get a room, faggots!” The pain and shame he’d seen there for a split second, and the way Castiel’s eyes had flicked, terrified, to Dean’s face, to see if he would change his mind now. The way Castiel’s teeth had bitten his lip to blood and he had shrunk into himself, cold air between them now where there had been a wall of heat before.
Dean marvelled in sheer admiration as Castiel gasped and started to pant, staring at Dean’s mouth, rocking slowly, almost painfully, against his hip.
Dean nodded his obedience, his hair dripping sweat into his eyes, and he reached to wipe it away and only succeeded in spreading it around. He could feel his orgasm hovering, no less urgent than any of the others - Cas
“I don’t know,” Castiel moaned, his voice laced with desperation. “Work seems like a patently terrible idea… Oh, how about the work
not done his homework before.
“I should have controlled myself, Dean. I put you in harm’s way with my indiscretion and I’m sorry.”
Dean groaned low and desperate, his frustration palpable.
Castiel had missed a call.
"There. Happy?" Sam rolled his eyes and Dean grinned. "Now seriously, what should we get Cas for Christmas?"
Castiel was a
“More than okay, Cas,” Dean assured him. “That was
Small talk descended over Castiel’s table, arguments over who had a worse customer service story to share for the week, the clink of ice in glasses, but Castiel was oblivious to it all, his entire attention on Dean. Dean was on
Dean let out a slow, shuddering breath, and he leaned in closer so his lips were almost touching Castiel’s, so he could taste Castiel’s breath when he inhaled, the taste of him heady and fresh, like ozone in the air after a summer rain, just when the fireflies were coming out.
Castiel abruptly disappeared and Dean obeyed, a little dizzy, dressing himself with Castiel already gone and no trace of what they'd shared anywhere on his physical body kind of depressing, not even a hickey where Cas had gone kind of wild on his neck. Dean sighed, his fingers tracing the spot where he should by all rights have a bruise, teeth marks,
" Dean whispered, and Castiel unfroze, staring up at Dean's face with naked desire, not even trying to hide it, his hands lifting from the bed beside him to slide reverently up Dean's thighs, across Dean's ass, and up his back, one hand gripping Dean's shoulder, the other the back of his head, to pull him down into a kiss, his kiss so passionate Dean melted into a puddle in his arms, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s neck without even noticing he was doing it, sinking into him, the burning heat of Castiel's stomach deliciously thrilling against Dean’s cock.
The next pool night Castiel did not work late. He arrived before the rest of his team for a change, to stake out his perch at
“San José is... very progressive. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to... “
both commonly referred to as
“But -”
Dean slammed his car door shut with a little more force than he meant to, and he blew out a frustrated breath and sucked in another, waiting to find out if Cas would do as he’d asked voluntarily, or if he was going to have to drag his ass inside.
“No, I didn’t want you to control yourself, Cas. I wanted you to fuck me over this car.”
Castiel was already staring at the screen again, his breathing ragged and heavy, and Dean shut his eyes for a second, collecting himself.
Castiel moved smoothly to press the thing Dean was indicating while Dean knelt, his nose an inch from the door, frowning at the inner workings of the machinery.
Dean’s eyes flared wider as he sucked in a startled breath, and Castiel grinned down at him, his eyes sparkling.
Dean was riveted, barely able to tear his eyes away, but he finally managed to look at Frank curiously. “These don’t come in black?  This isn’t purple?”
Dean stepped away from the door and waved at it with a flourish for Castiel to do the honors, so Castiel stepped up to gently push the door shut, smile incredulously at Dean as he pressed the latch and it worked perfectly. He opened and shut the door a couple more times in disbelief and turned to Dean with a radiant smile.
you when you come,
Several minutes went by before Dean sent any sort of reply indicating he’d seen the note, and Castiel started to worry he’d overreached before his phone buzzed again.
Castiel waved vaguely at his dick, too exhausted to work up rage anymore.
“Right! Sorry, Dean.”
but in all the best ways, everything screaming that he'd had really spectacular, maybe athletic sex, definitely the one giving it up, which he hadn't done in a lifetime, his mind shying away from opening up those memories with practiced ease. He hadn’t missed it since then, that was for sure, but he felt…
poke through the makeshift casserole dish, hot noodles oozing through the gap as the foil tore and the takeaway cartons broke apart. Dean sighed as he stood up to deal with it and Castiel laughed, waving at Dean to sit back down.
too, y'know, stuff I've never told anyone. I bet I can give you a run for your money. Are you fucking your hand with that big cock? Are you thinking about my mouth?”
Dean pulled up from trying
Dean kicked at pile of dried up bat guano dejectedly, grimacing to discover that it wasn’t that dried up.
have to ask first, not with me. Talk to me. What are you thinking about?”
Dean fought sleep for as long as he could, relishing the feeling of Castiel’s heartbeat against his chest, until at last the gentle rhythm of Castiel’s breathing pulled him under and sleep took him, the weight he didn’t realize he was carrying around his eyes smoothing away and making him look just as peaceful as the man he loved, gently slumbering in his arms.
“Maybe he’s a prude!”
It is 1000% true that I am a petty, needy creature made of whining and raw anguish, but let it also be said that if you feed me, I deliver the goods. :-D  Thank youuuuu here is your bonus chapter. :-D
Castiel’s breath came fast and shallow; he sounded close now.
“Well,” Castiel answered eagerly, “these are Cymbidiums of course, and I have Masdevallias on the west side of the garden but just a couple because they’re greedy little space hogs, and Sylvia over here is a Vanda” - he pointed to a beautiful white spray of flowers growing out of a wooden basket hanging from the underside of the deck, waved his hand at the collection of others there to continue but his face grew gentle at Dean’s completely blank expression. “Orchids,” he explained quietly, smiling softly. “They’re orchids, Dean.”

on Sam’s side, grinning at Dean’s sheepish smile, throwing the covers back and eagerly climbing onto the bed, rolling onto his back, slipping his boxers off while Dean rooted around in his duffel for something, Dean unable to conceal his surprise and discomfort at the size and extremely
Eventually, Dean groaned, and whispered, “What time is it?”
Dean sucked in a huge, relieved breath, his entire body still screaming for Castiel to keep fucking him, and then Castiel was lifting him, laying him down, smoothing a gentle hand over his forehead and all the sweat was gone but none of the heat, Castiel’s knee landing between his thighs, and he lifted his legs for Castiel to fit their bodies together, Castiel pressing his cock against Dean’s entrance but not fucking him yet despite Dean’s whimpering, rocking a little as he leaned down to grip Dean’s wrists and pin them on either side of his body, Castiel’s face almost feral, his breath visibly quickening, and Dean suddenly knew he’d chosen exactly right, lifting his chin to offer Castiel his throat, shuddering as Castiel gasped, astonished.
Dean instructed, nodding as Castiel relaxed his grip, sliding his hand rapidly up and down his cock now, his face registering confused discomfort.
compared to the inferno of desire he could feel welling up from wherever it lived inside him, so powerful he fought it back, struggling to keep it from stealing his reason. He laced a hand through Dean’s hair, gripping it between his fingers tightly enough to pull Dean’s head back so he could lean forward to bite his neck down low where a collar would hide, hard enough for Dean to cry out before he switched to licking and sucking, his other hand working Dean’s belt undone as his mouth found Dean’s and he growled and licked and sucked his way inside. Dean whimpered, melting under the onslaught, his breath coming hard and fast.
“I will heal you, then, and you will keep count this time.”
people, Dean”
Castiel sighed and nodded. ”Don’t I always?”
Castiel took off at an actual run, returned in just under two minutes with more ingredients and a six-pack of root beer for Sam that he’d been unable to pass up as he jogged past. He set the avocados and garlic and salsa on the empty conveyor belt, and Brandon rang those up too.
“You are an exceptionally beautiful boy and I would have been honored, but I am in an exclusive relationship.”
Dean, I suddenly want to do this
“Are you sure? Extreme or irrational fear or aversion -”
“So it is,” Castiel agreed. “Dean, is this roux done to your satisfaction?”
“Dean?”
Castiel pulled in a long slow breath, relaxing his arms just enough to allow Dean to do the same, then exhaled steadily and audibly for several seconds, increasing the pressure of his arms to encourage Dean to follow his lead. Dean struggled to do as he was told, trembling violently for several minutes as his panting slowed to the occasional hiccup and he followed Castiel’s example, arms limp at his sides, Castiel’s vice grip on Dean’s chest the only thing keeping him from collapsing over the toilet again.
Castiel reached for a couple of the pillows piled behind them on the bed, shucking his borrowed underwear and propping himself up beside Dean, so close Dean could feel the heat of his body, his heart starting to pound as he tried to think of a way to articulate, “
“Yup. So you
“¡Hola primito! That’s my friend Castiel, José!” Dean answered, coming out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, smoothly relieving Castiel of his burden.
“How do you not need to urinate yet, Dean?”
That got the laugh he was hoping for, the basement echoing with chuckles and snickers, even Miss Kittredge grinning and rolling her eyes. She provided a pen, Stephen pulled a still sealed bottle of pills from a jacket pocket, and several other soldiers found similar bottles on their persons as more pens were produced and tiny dicks were autographed over names and under pharmacy numbers, the creativity at turning letters into stick figures engaged in carnal acts truly impressive.
,” Dean cut him off, his voice clipped. Castiel turned to look at him then, concern rippling across his face, but Dean held up a hand to clarify quietly, still staring straight ahead.
” Dean whispered. “
“No? You had a terribly exhausting week and Sam said you didn’t sleep Thursday night. That you were in the shower for hours. I’m so sorry Dean, I didn’t mean to - “
“How did you get them to stop?” Stephen’s voice was desperate, the dark circles under his eyes especially pronounced today.
They pointedly did not look at each other as someone took a piss, did not wash their hands, left, door slamming behind them.
“Thank you Anna. I wouldn’t have recognized what had happened if you hadn’t told me to wait for him to make a move, I wouldn’t have recognized it for what it was when I saw him talking to someone else, nor would I have understood that I had missed it. I honestly don’t know what would have happened, but… Oh, Anna,
and landing, Dean’s mouth dry now, on Castiel’s lips, soft and pink, Dean could almost feel them whispering over his flesh again.
Castiel looked like he was in shock, basically, his eyes as wide as Dean had ever seen them, his face frozen halfway between disbelief and awe, and Dean's nerves did a little shimmy and suddenly they were waves of heat, fierce and hot.
“Was it like this?”
“I had no idea you had arachnophobia -”
Castiel reached for his shirt, shrugged into it, the buttons incongruous over the naked flesh of his perfect stomach.
Castiel snorted, managed to heave himself halfway up on one elbow but collapsed onto his back again under Dean’s partial weight. Dean grinned, stroked his thumb along Castiel’s lower lip, shuddering with an aftershock of desire as Castiel’s lips parted.
Dean sighed and amended his statement. “Hurts.”
“Aye.”
“Sit anywhere, Cas,” Dean hollered from the bathroom, “Seriously, make yourself at home. I’ll be out in five minutes!”
The sun on his face pulled Dean back from wherever he was hovering in his head, his eyes focusing on Castiel’s face, furrowed with concern, staring down at him, before he scrambled to his feet, shaking his hands through his hair and ripping off layers as fast as he could move, jacket and shirt and tee shirt and boots and jeans - he paused when he hit boxers, electing to keep those on, gulping ragged breaths as he fished his keys and wallet out of his jeans.
Castiel smirked against Dean’s neck. “You’re right. I wasn’t thinking that far ahead, I thought you might need more rest - “
Dean groaned and nodded, shaking violently.
accidentally embarrass the shit out of me just then - “ Castiel winced, as Dean leaned forward and dropped his voice even quieter - “I’m gonna have to push through it to ask you where you get that.. stuff. It’s
“Cas, does he need to fuck me right now?”
Dean choked on his coffee and Castiel grinned wickedly, held up his hands. “Of course I kid, Dean, I would never raise a hand to anyone that hadn’t expressly begged me to.” Sam shook his head, grinning as Dean coughed, his ears turning a little pink, and Castiel continued. “But seriously Dean, would you like advil or tylenol? I found I needed some this morning and you imbibed a little more than I did…?”
“Dean is just friendly. He likes meeting new people. And I
“I believe you,” Castiel retorted, begrudgingly taking a swig and wincing. It tasted like a squirrel had defecated in a birdbath located under a hops vine.
Dean.”
“I’m sorry?” he answered.
“Like hunger, sex turns out to be a pressing human need I neither understood, nor anticipated how to meet. I was hoping tonight, Nora an' I - “
Dean threaded his way over to join Castiel, avoiding the piles of guano very carefully now.
Castiel leaned in behind him, so close Dean could feel his breath on the back of his neck, raising the hairs there just a little further.
Castiel’s face lit up in a pleased smile, his hand crossing the distance between them to pet the flush rising on Dean’s cheeks.
“Shall we clean out this nest? I just want to get fake Bobby off my back and… grab a beer, maybe.”
“Why do you need to go to meetings with Dean here, Castiel? He’s been selling like a rock star without your... let’s call it assistance.  I prefer to keep my software people away from the customers whenever possible. Although - “ Zachariah gave Castiel’s attire a cursory glance and added “ - I suppose you are one of the more presentable ones.”
“This body has a place to interlock with yours, and I neither eat nor drink so it requires no additional cleansing rituals like I read on the computer are needed for most humans to have intercourse there.”
he’d gotten from zero to blastoff in under thirty seconds.
had a mouth on him."
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “
Sam shook his head, “I think the cops were still skeptical but José and Felipe are smart kids and rolled with it a hundred percent. They hopped right in, whispered to us from the back seat how to get to their place which wasn’t even two blocks away. We basically had time to give them our names before we were rolling up into the parking lot with cops behind us. José and Felipe ran up to Big Man and Alejandro as fast as they could, threw their arms around Big Man, told him real loud that uncle Sam and uncle Dean were here for a visit and good thing we found them on our way because some big kids made them shoplift candy.”
Sam made a face while Dean snorted into Castiel’s chest, following that with an uncharacteristic giggle that made Castiel smile and Sam’s eyebrows rise.
“It was my pleasure, Dean,” Castiel answered smoothly. “April showed me how, before she killed me of course.”
“I will not pressure you, but I want nothing else. I am content to taste your pleasure.”
“Alright.” Castiel said. “Then I apologize Dean, and further, I look forward to seeing you use your powers. For chaotic good.” he added, winning a real smile from Dean.
Castiel’s fingers were twisting in slow motion, slowly separating at the outset of his thrusts and coming back together as he bottomed out at his knuckles, fucking Dean in languorous slow motion, and Dean found himself panting and gasping and trying to speak, only garbled half-syllables making it to the tip of his tongue.
, will you let me?”
deserve compliments on his hospitality, he’d thought of everything.
." Dean grinned as Sam rolled his eyes and flipped to a clean page in his notebook.
“Okay, first hold some of this in your hand so it gets warm…”
Castiel was the one to spit himself this time, horrified but laughing, and Dean held the door for him as they left his office, taking Castiel’s horrortainment firmly as a win.
Castiel adjusted himself in his trousers, dammit he was still half an hour from home.
“Me neither. But I sure as shit felt
Sam nodded and pulled off his headphones, but he didn’t leave the couch, intent now on studying. Dean stretched and groaned, drained his coffee, and stood up.
“I have very few friends Anna. I believe you are my closest friend.”
The party broke up with laughter and arguments and demands for rematches, and Dean’s “little” brother Sam firmly assimilated into their midst as a kindred nerd spirit. Dean watched the animated conversations and the fond goodbyes and the glow on Castiel’s face with a soft smile on his lips, bending over to pull on his boots, and only when he straightened up again did he see that Anna had thrown her arms around Castiel and was squeezing him tight, her face pressed against his chest.
Just a few seconds, that's all I ask, and for one brief, shimmering moment, feel what I felt. <3

Castiel had shaken him awake at the crack of dawn, already dressed and ready to go to work, with barely enough time for Dean to shower and get his shit in the car, and Castiel had shaken his head no thank you to pie, his urgency about work contagious enough that Dean had packed his pie to go.
“Yes, please,” he whispered, and as Castiel’s eyebrow arched in challenge, he added without hesitation, “
“These. I already wore this set but just once, and they
. He needn’t have worried, Castiel the consummate host, but that didn’t stop him imagining Castiel opening the door, seeing him like this, and instead of shaming him down the thought was wildly arousing and he hurtled over that razor’s edge, his pleasure intense and overwhelming as he came hard, holding his breath and spilling his pleasure in pulses over his hand and onto his stomach, twitching and shuddering and finally managing to choke out “
Sam and Manuel were facing each other down, Sam pouring sweat into his sleeveless tee, his hair soaking wet and dripping down his forehead. Sam was dribbling slowly in place, intent on finding a way past the wall of glistening, tattooed muscles and bright white grimace blocking his way. Sam and Manuel were several orders of magnitude larger than the next tallest person on the court, who happened to be Dean, apparently playing for team Skins. Dean’s freckled back rippled and shone with sweat as he grinned fiercely and guarded Diego from interfering with Big Man. Sam and Dean were conspicuously the only white men in the horseshoe, adrift in a sea of rippling brown muscles, half the men shirtless and dripping, the other half sweating into their tank tops and muscle tees. Castiel had eyes only for Dean, enchanted by the grace with which Dean moved over the court.
“We all kinda flirt with Alex!” Dean protested weakly.
“Take your pie and get inside the house, Dean.” Castiel’s voice was low and guttural, and Dean’s entire body vibrated as he spoke.

” Dean’s voice was strained; Castiel could hear the sound of the car door slamming and feet on stairs. Castiel knew
Castiel’s head tilted in puzzlement. “You don’t have a phone book?”
“I want you, Cas,” Dean finally promised, his face torn. “I’m just - you have to go slow or it’ll hurt - not good hurt, like a
. I’m going to do that first I’ll be right back.” Dean disappeared out the front door in his sock feet, pulling his shoes on as the door shut behind him, and Castiel and Sam shared a glance - Castiel delighted, Sam nodding and grinning an “I told you so” grin, and both of them going all nonchalant as Dean breathlessly pushed back through the door, kicking off his shoes and rushing over like Castiel might revoke his permission at any moment.
Dean barely noticed Castiel’s hand leaving the back of his head to trail down his back, too preoccupied sucking on Castiel’s tongue, nor Castiel adjusting something between them, his hand on Dean’s shoulder pulling gently down, but then Dean sure as shit noticed
Castiel’s surprised bark of laughter caught Sam’s attention and he looked up, but he could see they weren’t done yet and looked back down immediately.
I am so in love with this chapter I wanted to publish it alone. It is, however, quite short, and we do need to move this story along, so instead I beg you for a favor. After you read the last line, sit with it for a moment before rushing headlong to the next.
Castiel reached the last button and sighed, lifting his eyes again to meet Dean’s.
“I know that humans feel terribly guilty about it, and waste a great deal of time praying for forgiveness afterwards. I know that - just like human sexual orientation - god has never cared about that

Castiel grinned, kissing Dean’s forehead, and stroking his hair.

“Dean, that feels

Dean shook his head slowly.  “No.” he said. “Those were my new coworkers, people I expected to see again. I was just being friendly.”  He shrugged, looked a little hurt. “Whatever. It doesn’t matter.”
Warnings: One of those little misunderstandings I can't seem to stop writing. :-)
Dean didn’t call until almost eleven. He sounded hoarse, and exhausted, but he sighed in pleasure to hear Castiel say, “Hello, Dean.”
The general hubbub had died down a bit when the quietest man in their group, a newcomer who never said anything more than the bare minimum to technically meet the requirements for participating, cleared his throat.
There was a chorus of hoots and hollers and Dean shook his head, grinning saucily at Alex and rolling his eyes at the nickname he could not escape, then looking at Castiel. His face implored Castiel to say yes, his eyes wide and urgent despite the smile still on his lips. This was important. Castiel sighed, gave Dean the slightest nod, then answered loudly enough to carry.
“I can feel you blushing from here, Cas.”
“Yes ma’am. Please don’t hurt me.”
That one was harder. Dean mulled it over for a while. “Maybe he just rejected the family religion, doesn’t have to be about sex, Sam. Religions are complicated.”
“Of course this greenhouse is brighter because the new-fangled plastic siding is brand new, I keep having to cycle the varietals in and out of here if they get more sun than they want, but by and large I can’t complain…” The proprietor was almost muttering to himself now as he inspected a leaf on one of the orchids, trading his spray bottle and clippers out to manifest a bottle of hand sanitizer from somewhere on his person and squirting a little on his hands as he spoke. He offered some to Dean, who accepted solemnly, and they rubbed their hands in unison until the orchid man turned back to caress a leaf, frown at it, and snip it off with his clippers. He pocketed the leaf and the clippers, absently reapplying sanitizer as he led Dean to the back corner of this greenhouse.
This is one of my favorite things I've ever written.
“Yes, Miss Kittredge,” he said, hesitating, then he squared his shoulders and sat up straight, took a deep breath, and said the words out loud. “It was a very pleasant distraction indeed. I have entered into a new romantic relationship. For the first time in my life, I am
“I think that can be arranged.”
Castiel's steps receded back down the stairs and Dean sighed, slowly drifting back down. He hadn’t come that hard in forever. He had to find out where to buy that stuff, and hope it worked just as well in the shower. Dean wiped up with some tissues, wadded up the evidence in a ball and pulled off a sock to shove the wad into the sock, shove the sock in his duffel. He shoved the other one next to it for good measure, pulled up his boxers, grabbed his dopp kit, yesterday’s jeans, a clean tee and boxers, and padded down the hallway towards the bathroom to make himself presentable.
“- He’s crazy about me,” Dean piped up, his eyes open now and gazing up at Castiel in such worship that Sam blushed and looked away while Castiel returned the look, staring down at Dean adoringly as Dean spoke.
Castiel nodded.
Dean bore down on Castiel’s invading finger, nerves he’d never even known could feel so good twitching and pulsing around Castiel’s finger and deep in his gut, the tension of his imminent orgasm spiraling higher than he’d ever felt it climb before. Dean’s eyes fluttered closed and his hips arched up, pressing harder and harder into Castiel’s face, his entire body convulsing as Castiel’s burning heat and rhythmic friction pulled him over that edge and his orgasm
in here with him, a closed door, privacy. It was impossible to pass up, and he pulled his shirt off as quickly as he could, unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans to pull those off, pulled his boxers down and stroked his cock dry while he tore the top off the lube packet with his teeth, squeezed it into his right hand with his left, dropped the empty packet on his shirt on the bed and groaned as he wrapped his freshly lubed hand around his cock and slid his palm down the length of his shaft. This was completely different,
“They smiled at me, so I didn’t think they minded.
“Yes, it was,” Castiel agreed, his lips curving up gently as he paused to study Dean’s face. “Thank you for the experience, I will savor it as one of my favorite memories. I know you said you don’t want to talk about things like this afterwards, so I won’t, but this meant a great deal to me. Thank you again.”
“SO?” Dean exclaimed.
“I took an interest in the subject after the night you used my mouth,” Castiel admitted, buttoning and zipping the trousers, pushing the leather of his belt through the buckle, Dean helpless not to watch the silver prong of Castiel’s belt buckle slowly push through the hole.
“What are you saying exactly?”
The surprised pleasure blooming on Castiel’s face was worth any sacrifice - not that Dean would have left him tonight without at least giving him a
Dean nodded eagerly up at Castiel, eyes wide, his hands trembling in anticipation, and Castiel patted the bed, smiling gently.
After a pleasant lunch with Castiel, procrastinating the inevitable, Dean agonized for a good hour about what to say to the client. When he finally bit the bullet and called, he said only that his boss had requested they have another meeting to go over a few questions that had come up from the software team, and he made no mention of bringing backup. The client was eager to see him again - used those exact words, even, and Dean suppressed a shudder as he agreed to a lunch meeting the very next day, hanging up with a strong urge to go home and shower. He suppressed that too, typing only a formal date and time through the office intranet to Castiel, and texting him a single sentence on his personal phone so there wouldn’t be a paper trail.
to possess you. But you were afraid, and I have no wish to hurt you. I
“Better,” Castiel growled, his face stern, but satisfied. He released Dean’s cock to tug Dean’s trousers and boxers roughly down, leaned over him to take just the tip of Dean’s cock in his mouth and suckle while Dean gasped in surprised pleasure, his eyes rolling back in his head. Dean tasted like the hand soap in the bathrooms smelled and Castiel grinned appreciatively that Dean had cleaned up for him after his solo activities, surged up Dean’s body to thrust his tongue into Dean’s mouth, taste himself on Dean’s lips and tongue. He plundered Dean’s mouth until Dean was whimpering, arching his back and trying to fuck harder into Castiel’s slow caresses, and then he unbuttoned Dean’s shirt slowly with one hand, peeled it open so he could lick his way down Dean’s chest, nibble on his nipples without breathing on them, bite the flesh of his stomach as he worked his way down Dean’s body, slipping the condom on his finger and ripping open the packet of lube without Dean noticing.
push his aching cock into him - slow and easy until Dean was begging for more of course - and then not even a little bit slow
tonight. He reeled them in with clueless white guy bravado, showing just enough chops to look like a proud weekend warrior. He lost and barely won and lost again, his drunken bravado increasing at a rate Castiel knew for a fact was not remotely commensurate with the rate at which he was ostentatiously drinking. He goaded the boys into double or nothing, nodding at the gorgeous - beefy -  bartender who stepped in to warn these boys that Dean here was not to be trifled with - he played pool here once a week for at
Castiel hissed as Dean pressed forward, and Dean froze, his eyes wide in terror, his dick pulsing
Castiel let the tears come, no one could see him in his car doing sixty-five on the highway. He wept without a sound, tears running down his face, until his mind wandered again, and then he groaned instead, still so many miles from home.
Castiel sighed, he could not refute her logic, but he could refuse sitting in her tiny battery-driven Prius. “Mine.” Anna grinned and he walked her around to the passenger side, opened the door, closed it for her. He joined her reluctantly, sliding into the driver’s seat, and tossing his coat into the back seat.
“Your erection. Can I get rid of yours now? For practice?”
? May I?”
“It’s not a big deal, I just want…” He shrugged, unwilling to spoil the surprise. “Will you please wait in the bedroom once you’re dressed?”
that for each other, hot on the heels of the lies he’d told tonight, his body betraying him as his chin dipped forward in a single nod, his eyelashes fluttering in anticipation, Castiel leaning forward now, hot breath whispering across Dean’s cock as he studied the end of it where Dean’s arousal was glistening.
“Dean.”  Dean’s eyes flew open, searching Castiel’s face.  “I want you to come by your own hand, right now, while I watch.”
“No,” Sam retorted. “Cas is in this with us now and he needs to know what he’s working with.” He returned his attention to Castiel, who was musing, rapt.
hanging out with you, Cas. If you want my time you only gotta say the word.” He squeezed Castiel’s wrist once and removed his hand. Castiel watched Dean’s hand retreat across the table to his beer and his eyes now dared to make the trip up the bottle to Dean’s face.
Castiel’s whisper was barely audible, the sibilant hiss on Sam’s name the only part that really carried, but he’d already grumped in the car and Dean had already extemporized a couple excuses Cas hadn’t bought and Dean turned his head just enough to speak. Castiel’s breath was on his ear now, which he wasn’t sure had ever happened before, but it was distracting, and sent an unexpected ripple of chills along his spine.
“If that’s true, then you don’t have to be gross in the first part.”
“You’re welcome,” Dean answered softly, rubbing the back of his neck. “If you open the garage door I can get that hose swapped out and check that off the list, too.”
“Well,” Castiel grinned, “You felt my
“Like what you see, Cas?”
“Thanks, man. You didn’t have to and...” - he chuckled dejectedly - “and I’ve ruined your shirt.”
“Regardless of your decision, I will keep your secret, Dean, you have my word. You don’t have to worry about that.”
Dean reached a hand up to caress the side of Castiel’s worried face, brushing soft fingers over the deep lines furrowing Castiel’s forehead.
“Castiel will do just fine.”
I had, uh, a really nice night.”
Dean moaned softly, his hand flying over his mouth in surprise, and Castiel raised an eyebrow. He crooked one finger at Dean in a “come here,” gesture that lifted Dean bodily, as if by magic, first into a sitting position and then on all fours crawling towards Castiel and then kneeling in front of him, still on the mattress at the foot of the bed, their faces even. Castiel lifted his free hand to the back of Dean’s neck in a gentle caress as he leaned forward to press their lips together, a kiss that started tender and ended with Castiel’s hand gripping the back of Dean’s neck cruelly, Castiel’s tongue as far into Dean’s mouth as he could shove it, his body pressing Dean backwards as Dean eagerly melted, until Castiel groaned in anguish and broke it off, adjusting his erection more comfortably in his jeans with a frustrated grimace.
“No. Your job is grades, Okay? That’s the deal. I got this, Okay?”
apologize for wanting me.
Castiel sighed, rubbed his face. He switched off the heat and gripped the steering wheel again.
“Youthful vigor, Cas. You might remember it, it’s that thing you have to give up to get ‘years of practice with bourbon.’” Dean grinned, reaching into the carton for a jelly doughnut. To start.
“It’s not too late, Dean. Whenever you get here, dinner will be waiting.” Castiel smiled to hear Dean smile, and a silence stretched between them as they listened to each other breathe.
Castiel stood up from where he’d been sitting at the foot of the bed, yawned, stretched, slowly wandered over to his dresser. He pulled on clean boxers and a tee shirt, ambled casually to the closet to pull on a pair of jeans, ran his cleanest hand through his hair.
“Alright. She seemed to like lying under me and I wanted to feel what it was like to lie under you, while we are both still - improbably,
“Yeah, I know, and logistically it was impossible, I get it, but when you shoved me against the car, I’ve never wanted anything more.” Dean shuddered, the sense memory of Castiel’s breath against his neck intoxicating, and Castiel glanced at him and then back at the road, his lips slowly curving into a smile.
out the door to the bathroom, slamming the door in his haste.
“Truth.” Garth chimed in. “Mine was too, that dude put on a hell of a show tonight.”
“You said you could be gentle. I
Castiel cut himself off abruptly, still not meeting Dean’s eyes.
Stephen still wasn’t sure, so Castiel steeled his face, deadpanned seriously, “I will be glad to draw a penis on the bottle for you Stephen, if it helps.”
“I know.
Castiel nodded at Sam, momentarily speechless as puzzle pieces clicked into place in his mind. Sam relaxed at Dean’s indication he could be trusted, nodded at him, and returned his full attention to Dean.
Dean’s fingertips drummed on Baby’s steering wheel to the beat of whatever music was playing in his head, and Castiel stared straight ahead, far away now, worrying about something Ephraim had said; the weight of the world he hadn’t felt for a few hours turning around and around to make a nest, and flopping heavily back down onto his shoulders.
Dean stared at Castiel, aghast. “Cas, you have
Castiel grinned. “Yeah, alright that might be weird but I’m just worried about your self-care routine if you haven’t got a favorite brand by now.” He raised both hands in apology “Sorry! None of my business, I’m just glad you… liked it.”  Castiel blushed as he realized what he was saying and Dean laughed, pleased to see the flush on Cas’s cheeks for a change. Only fair.
It was two chicks going to town on each other and Dean just shrugged and left it, completely disinterested in the television or the dubbed moaning, trying to convince himself the sympathetic arousal simmering in his blood was probably from the porn and not at all because he’d spent the last fifteen minutes wondering how Cas was doing in there with that giant dick in his hand.
- alive, and these bodies are still firm and youthful - well, yours, I mean,
Dean abruptly let go as he got a little too close, leaning back on his elbows and trying to hide how heavily he was breathing, the sudden, burning question on his mind taking up every ounce of his concentration.
Please bear with me I know this is hours late.  I had a rough night; my empathy chip is on overload grieving something that is not my business for someone I care deeply for, in a parasocial one-sided relationship. Lordt help me. Lordt help us all. Hugs all around if you need them, we will get through this thing that is someone else's pain that should not affect me this deeply but still does. God bless fandom spaces for understanding, HUH?
to make you feel good.”
Sam looked up expectantly as they came in, his giant hands outstretched.
“I couldn’t help but notice that, and I have to say I appreciate it. Thanks, Cas.”
,” Dean finally whispered.
Frank snorted. “You’ve never been orchid shopping, have you, kid.” He mouthed the price silently and Dean’s mouth fell open in dismay. Frank nodded smugly, but as Dean’s face fell Frank’s face fell too. “Come to think of it, Castiel hasn’t been in here once since he picked up his ladies and he used to swing by every few weeks. Is he doing alright?”
“Go slow, okay?”
Castiel’s laugh was bright and pure, and Brandon smiled in pleased delight to have pulled it from him.
Dean shook his head at the two of them goodnaturedly. “Yeah, yeah, yuck it up, jackasses.” He grinned at Castiel. “Got a clean garbage bag, Cas? I don’t wanna set this down on the carpet, just in case...”  Castiel jumped to get him one, spread it out on the floor next to the door, and watched as Dean set her down, flipped her open, and had the door latch disassembled in under a minute, peering inside by the beam of an industrial sized maglite and poking and prodding with a screwdriver.
Dean spun around in a slow circle, the gravel crunching under his feet, as Sam came over to join them from where he’d been testing out a low stone bench on the opposite side of the yard. “This doesn’t seem tiny at all Cas,” Dean protested, “but sure, I’d love that.”
Dean suddenly couldn’t breathe, his pulse pounding in his throat and Castiel’s voice kind of a Charlie brown “Wah wah wah” through the roaring in his ears as he fought the rising terror, his eyes too white, Castiel’s hand on his arm catching him as his knees gave out, Castiel’s other arm wrapping around his waist and lifting him like he was stuffed with dandelion fluff instead of flesh and bone, calmly walking him out into the setting sun, and depositing him gently on the grass.
“At the BAR?” Sam was practically apoplectic, and Castiel decided not to admit they went to their work gym.
“Make no mistake, you are beautiful at every angle, Dean, but this is not what I anticipated. Will you not give yourself to me so that I may observe your face, and kiss your mouth, and touch your body as I wish?”
Castiel climbed up his body to kiss him, the taste of his own jizz on Cas’s tongue firmly clinching a spot in Dean’s Top Five as he eagerly opened his mouth to accept it. Castiel reached for lube, languidly stroked himself as they kissed, but it wasn’t until Dean reached up with both hands to harshly twist his nipples like he’d watched Cas do Friday night that Castiel gasped into Dean’s mouth, groaning around Dean’s tongue as he spilled his pleasure over his hand to spatter Dean’s stomach with searing heat. Dean groaned as he felt his last Top Ten entry that wasn’t Cas-related - a perennial favorite in his personal spank bank - drop firmly out of even his Top Hundred, his entire roster spinning like a cartoon slot machine and coming up all Cas.
burst through the door.
See you tomorrow?”
Castiel shrugged modestly, stepping back but only just the slightest bit as Dean released him, his smile self-effacing. “It was nothing.”
Dean stopped listening, smirking up at Cas.
“Your friend is also muy guapo, Dean, but I get it, I get it, no flirting, he’s all yours.”
“In any case, I'm clearly incapable of communicating with other humans in that regard - as in so many others, I s'pose - but our waitress seems to like you, 'n if you need to leave me here to have intercourse with her I certainly unnerstan'."
- but it was Sam who picked up.
uh, okay that’s - Ah - that’s - AH -
Castiel waited, only his hand in motion, sliding up Dean’s back and reaching over his shoulder to cradle Dean’s face, and Dean shuddered, lifting his panicked gaze to meet Castiel’s eyes, gentler than Dean expected, gray thunderclouds over silver seas.
Dean closed his eyes and pressed a kiss to Castiel’s thumb, and Castiel shuddered again, whispered “
“I don’t understand. If I watch pornography, this will go away?”
“Yes, sir. Many hands helped as the company gained traction of course, but I designed the database and the framework and I wrote the lion's share of our code libraries. To this day I continue to develop most of the new features on the database end before the team integrates the new features into the customer portal. We all test it after that, and then we work together to integrate our updates into the live copy.”  Castiel made it sound like no big deal, but Dean’s eyes widened as he watched Zachariah reassess who he was talking to, the adjustment in his demeanor something Dean found intensely satisfying, even as he marveled that Castiel had somehow stooped to helping
with a single force of will.
He didn’t, settling into Baby’s upholstery with a soft sigh like Dean had done his entire life, and Dean nodded to himself in unconscious commiseration.
Castiel glanced away only long enough to verify that Sam was not listening, then he leaned forward, his face earnest and apologetic, his voice so quiet Dean could barely hear him.
Castiel shook his head. “I didn’t think this through. You shouldn’t drive right now, and you certainly shouldn't be alone. Let me take you to pick up Sam, I’ll bring you back here so he can drive you home, okay?” He smiled fondly at Dean, his forehead creasing in concern. “Please, I insist. Or I’ll worry.”
“Good to know. I wish the windows opened.”
cock -
“Wait, how can we leave together?” Dean asked, obviously listening only to the most important part.
“Cas - “ Dean’s voice was thick and husky, and Castiel’s fingers paused their work wrapping his tie around his neck as he studied Dean’s face carefully.
Dean stared at Castiel evenly, his eyes soft, his lips curving into an affectionate smile. His voice was mild and fond as he answered.
“Yes what?”
“What do you need that for?”
Castiel’s gentle smile was belied by the way his upper lip lifted just enough to reveal a flash of incisors. He tore his gaze away from Dean’s mouth to meet his eyes, seas of black staring into polished jade.
Castiel found himself staring at Dean’s face, studying the curve of his cheeks, the way his eyelashes caught the light. Anna touched Dean’s sleeve and Castiel heard Anna say “Dean, I’d like to introduce you to Castiel Novak, one of our best programmers and a good friend of mine. Castiel, Dean Winchester.” Castiel had a moment to wonder how Anna already knew Dean on a first-name basis, and then Dean was turning his benevolent gaze away from the groupies to focus his full attention on Castiel’s face, and Castiel found himself being studied in return.
fuck you.”
You guys are catching up to the parts of this story I have what we still call 'written down' on what we still call 'paper'. I never planned out ahead to release these first couple weeks (character weeks in story time) of egregious amounts of sex over such a spread out amount of real life time but here we are. :-D  At this time we're good through August and the first week of September and then I may need to go biweekly. I'm toying with the notion of saving updates for when Supernatural is on hiatus. Publishing when it's live has had some difficult stretches for yours truly bc no one gives a shit about a fic when canon has just done something awful. ANYHOO, be forewarned, there is way more story but a lot of it is still in my head and I will need time to rattle it out of there. :-D
“What are you grinning about, Dean?”
Warnings: Nope.
Dean’s eyes widened, helpless not to stare, and Castiel grinned smugly to himself, even though Dean had not been given permission to look down. When Dean’s eyes returned guiltily to Castiel’s face he was not in trouble, but Castiel was not smiling either, his expression fierce and expectant.  Dean didn’t dare speak, just stared at Castiel for a hint at what was expected of him, and Castiel obliged, raising an eyebrow and glancing meaningfully at his cock and back to Dean’s face.
Castiel arched an eyebrow at Dean’s hissed intake of breath, and the way he was shrinking away from his side.
I’ll heal anything that’s injured after we’re done.”
Castiel hissed in a breath, his eyes wild. “But there’s lubricant - “
The boys shook their heads no, delighted, and then Dean remembered something.
“Where to, Cas?”
“How did you know that - that uh, that hugging me would help?”
” but Dean shook his head in anguished protest, wailing, his voice cracking, “
“May I continue, or should I go deal with my curse on my own so you can get more rest?”
Castiel’s eyes did not leave the road, but his fingers stilled their drumming on the steering wheel as he hesitated, obviously choosing his words with care.
Dean caressed her steering wheel, reaching forward to switch on the radio. There was a seventies station coming into this town, and -
“What do you remember from last night, Dean?”
, claiming Dean with one vigorous thrust, the full weight of his earthly body behind his claim as he landed, Dean’s exhilarated gasp only fueling Castiel’s inferno, his lips and teeth meeting Dean’s throat with enough force to taste copper, Dean’s whimper and the way he arched into it stealing Castiel’s reason, nothing in the Universe of any import but this one human writhing and moaning underneath him, Castiel’s skin glowing just a little as he let the pleasure take him, his hips pistoning out of control as he shifted his weight to reach for his human -
“But I have no way to repay you -”
Dean came back to his body in stages. First he felt warm, and safe, and he enjoyed that for a long while, safety not something he remembered feeling so viscerally since he was a child in his mother's arms, but these were definitely not his mother's arms, and he did not feel like a child.
“What do you want?” The man frowned up at Dean through bushy gray eyebrows, a spray bottle gripped in one hand, clippers in the other. Dean suppressed his instinct to back away out of fear he’d bump into another orchid, and he stared down in consternation at the scowling man in overalls.  On the one hand, he should just leave. On the other hand, the flowers here were gorgeous, much nicer and more striking colors than the pink and white combinations he’d just spent several hours being informed were the best available. He held out a hand placatingly.
“You can call me Frank, kiddo, you don’t have to keep calling me sir.”  Frank glanced over to follow Dean’s gaze and shook his head. “You’ve got great taste Dean, but you can’t afford her. Brand new varietal, just came out this year, closest to true black we’ve gotten yet.”
The way you were looking at me when you were drizzling it on, and, uh, adding to it, and then when you -
“I have been feeling pain for a while, yes, but I ignored it to give you pleasure. Is that not a normal part of intercourse?”
“I don’t think so, Cas. I don’t think god gets his hands that dirty. I think all us sorry bastards down here are on our own, and god doesn’t give a shit if we suffer or don’t, it just is what it is, and we have to do the best we can with what we’ve got.”
“What are you two talking about without me?” he mock scolded, crossing to the coffee pot and pouring a cup into the clean mug that was clearly waiting for him, half and half and sugar beside it and a spoon upright in the mug.
whimpering into Castiel’s mouth as Castiel pulled him down onto his cock,
Castiel nodded dejectedly, looking down to lift one foot to slip it into the boxers, stepping through, repeating with the other leg, before meeting Dean’s eyes again as he efficiently slid soft silk boxers over the heavy cock Dean had been trying not to stare at.
it, Cas,” he breathed, “but it doesn’t matter what I think, it’s your living room.”
When Castiel turned his head and sniffed him, sighing happily, Dean pretended that was a totally normal thing to do, and when Castiel shimmied his back across the bed to share Dean’s pillow, his head nestling in the crook of Dean’s arm, Dean went ahead and pretended that was fine, too, guiltily savoring the heat of Castiel’s body pressing against his side.
Dean’s jeans were on the floor before his conscious mind had made the decision, Castiel’s happy little sigh as he openly admired Dean’s body making Dean feel all sorts of warm and tingly but mostly incredibly horny, and he swallowed thickly and reached for the packet of lube with trembling fingers, the girl on the television entirely forgotten.
Castiel preened on his lady’s behalf, reached out to pet her too. “San Francisco is particularly well suited to orchids, and I find tending them calming. I can take you to one of the botanical gardens sometime if you want to see more, this is a tiny collection, truly.”
It was Castiel’s turn, technically, but he let Dean hold him because he craved it, fell asleep immediately, safe in the circle of Dean’s arms.
. You have my word.” Castiel was almost vibrating with the rage Dean had caught a glimpse of in the car, and he was
Dean shook his head and swallowed his mouthful of doughnut. “Naw I’m good, I had some advil from your impressively stocked nightstand this morning, thanks Cas.”
“Yes. I always felt a certain peace, or contentment, perhaps, looking at your soul, but even though I can’t see your soul anymore, observing your body is still pleasurable. Looking at you makes me feel... good. You are a beautiful human, Dean. Will you please take off your jeans, so I can see the rest of you?”
he filed away, scrubbing at the wine bottle label under the stream of running water and coming to the realization it would have to be soaked off.
“It didn’t work,” Castiel sighed, desultorily collapsing onto his back on his side of the bed. He dropped his damp towel and pushed it off the bed onto the floor, glaring at his offending erection in frustration, while Dean made a tiny, “EEP,” sound and fled to the kitchenette, to busy himself with opening a fresh beer.
Dean didn’t mean to say it, it just slipped out, his voice half an octave lower than usual, and he couldn’t tell which of them was more startled for the half second until Castiel replied; then it was
“Holy Shit, I bet you don’t have to buy him flowers or dinner to get any, must be
“Late. I’m not sorry.”
Dean couldn’t breathe, his chest rapidly heaving as he hyperventilated, staring up at the sheer menace on Castiel’s face, his body rippling with chills everywhere Castiel’s eyes happened to land.
” to his lips, so he gave up, the silence stretching out between them, his fingers idly picking at the fabric of the towel at his waist.
Dean nodded enough for Castiel to feel it and grin wickedly, and then Castiel tilted Dean's chin forcibly up and tilted his head back, slid his cock deep into Dean’s mouth, and kept right on going, tapping Dean’s shoulder to swallow just when he felt like gagging, and then pushing past where Dean imagined a cock could go.  Castiel groaned low and menacing and slid out a little, still too far in for Dean to breathe, pushed back in with a tap for Dean to swallow, and repeated the same several more times before growling in frustration and pulling all the way out, gripping his wet cock in his fist to watch Dean gulp air, gasping.
“I’m sorry, Sam, I thought I could keep myself under control but I thought of nothing but your brother all week and I was unable to compose myself in his presence. I had to step outside, and then Anna invented a lie to kick us out together so we could go somewhere and - "
The crackling tension already coursing through Castiel’s body was
Dean looked up, surprised, a soft smile on his lips.
Castiel nodded his approval. “Very good, Dean.”  He turned on his heel and strode out of the bedroom without looking back, shutting the door firmly behind him.
Brandon’s smile was bright as the sun as he bagged up Castiel’s purchases - apparently pulling double duty tonight - and Castiel grinned back as he accepted the bags.
“Holy Shit,” Sam observed to Dean quietly once they heard the shower turn on, “Cas was
Okay.”
Dean scrambled to his feet, laughing, clambered onto a dry section of the sticky sheets, and propped himself on his back on the covers and one of the thick white pillows, squirting lube into his palm urgently, like Castiel might change his mind. The reality of the situation only hit him as he wrapped his hand around his cock and looked up at Castiel’s gorgeous face, lips parted, his undivided attention curling around Dean’s awareness like a physical caress, heavy, and sensual.
He chanced a glance at Sam, tendrils of fear Sam might disapprove, or worse, be disappointed in him suddenly curling around his heart, but Sam’s gaze was steady, his smile soft and fond. Dean’s shoulders unconsciously relaxed, and he looked back at the road, a quiet smile playing around his lips.  They rode the rest of the way in companionable silence, Dean’s mind finally at ease, his heart so full it felt like only the tight cage of his ribs was keeping it from bursting all over Baby's gently glowing dash.
“I didn’t brush mine either, because I can still taste you and I infinitely prefer the taste of your cock to mint.”
Alejandro’s eyes raked over Castiel’s bare chest, lingered along the line of his obliques, followed the curve of them down to dip south, then slowly traveled back up to Castiel’s face. He raised both eyebrows appreciatively, yes, yes he did. Castiel snorted slightly in response, smirking. Dean was standing beside him so Castiel missed Dean’s glance following Alejandro’s, Dean’s subsequent fleeting frown, but Alex read it loud and clear. He threw his hands up in surrender, grinning.
Dean glanced at him then, his face an anguished plea for mercy, and Castiel startled guiltily and flashed him a wordless apology, nodded and looked away. He hadn’t realized Dean could feel not only his attention but also his
Castiel carefully did not admire the utterly charming bow in Dean’s legs from this angle as they protruded from under the car, his face a study in confusion again now that Dean couldn’t see him. He hadn’t been on anyone’s ‘watch’ in longer than he could remember, and Dean’s offhand remark had him feeling things he could not name; sadness he knew, the familiar wistful longing an old friend he had long ignored, but something else, too. Something nice.
, at least, I can take care of," Castiel murmured, two fingers to Dean's forehead and suddenly he wasn't sore anywhere, the loss of that fucked-out feeling kind of distressing, actually, but there was nothing to be done about it now so Dean managed a smile.
“Shadddddup.”
“My pleasure, Cas. Really.” She grinned at him sweetly and patted his hand. Castiel smiled at her. Anna’s touch was welcome and her hand was soft and warm, but it did not crackle across his skin like Dean’s had, nor did it leave his hand tingling when she removed hers.
“No onion?”
Castiel’s voice was wistful, his eyes fixed on Dean’s mouth.
Castiel turned, an apology on his lips but Dean's tongue was already in his mouth, his body crushing Castiel savagely against Baby, his erection pressing into Castiel's hip. Castiel groaned in desperation, reaching up to lace fingers through Dean's hair, sucking desperately on his tongue, running his hands down Dean's sides to cup his ass and pull him closer,
“Shouldn't you be at work?” José shot back smoothly,  and Dean laughed.
“My head is sore from the headphones. Anytime you’re not working my ears could use the break.”
Castiel spoke first, his voice quiet and shy.
Cas, I brought my toolbox and the new hose for your Old Lady, shouldn’t be but five minutes to swap it out. Do you want me to take a look at that door handle too?”
that what you helped me with made you uncomfortable, but that you helped me anyway, so I mean that I won’t talk about it with you - or anyone else - to avoid causing you further distress. I didn’t have anyone else to ask, and I will
Cas. I’m here
Castiel ran a finger down Dean’s rib cage, trailing sparks, smirking at the difference in the way Dean’s hissed intake of breath sounded now.
It was Dean’s turn to choke, far worse than Castiel had, if the redness in his face was any indication when he was done coughing and he attempted to look Castiel in the eye. Castiel held his gaze calmly while the red in Dean’s face traveled to the tips of his ears and he stared at Castiel, speechless, until he couldn’t hold the eye contact and looked away again, his face crimson. A moment passed, and then another, with Dean refusing to meet Castiel’s eyes, chewing his bottom lip, his shoulders shaking a little, until Castiel began to worry he’d actually upset Dean, and his face fell. “I’m just teasing, Dean,” he apologized quietly. Dean looked at him then, lifting his head to meet Castiel’s eyes at last, and there was such mischief on his face, Castiel realized he wasn’t upset at all. If anything, he was delighted.
“Dean, Cas is gay.”
Dean nodded his understanding, swallowing nervously.
dark and menacing, and he didn’t lose himself to his pleasure in the same way as Saturday’s Castiel, but Dean had no chance to compare and contrast because Castiel was shoving him roughly on his back, yanking his trousers down, shoving his suit jacket under Dean’s ass.
”  Dean’s strangled exclamation came as he looked around the parking lot furtively, but they were still alone. He sighed in relief and murmured shyly “Not gonna lie Cas, can’t say I wasn’t thinking about the exact same thing since the second I felt you thinking it.”
Dean paused, considering.
“Dean, read my lips. You. Are. Fine.”
“We’ll be alright Sammy.”
“Where can we go?” Dean whispered.
He groaned and thrust once against Dean’s ass, his breath already speeding up.
Castiel’s stomach chose that moment to make an audible growling noise, and Dean knew he’d chosen wisely as he signaled the turn and pulled into the roadhouse's parking lot, already hopping with a dozen cars and a row of bikes outside.
“Gross! I mean, why is he like that?” Sam sounded more worried than angry and Castiel winced slightly, then nodded and sighed. He spoke calmly to Sam while he gazed down at Dean adoringly, petting his face now, as well as his hair, while Dean purred and sighed.
“I gave Dean a great deal of pleasure - “
Chapter Mood: A little stressful, mostly extremely soft and *I* think exceptionally romantic
per se, it just felt really big, and that wasn’t a bad thing by itself, and Dean further admitted to himself that Castiel’s heat stretching him so wide felt
“- and those other kids were actually serious trouble,” Dean finished, “out of their territory but enough of them to get away with it if they pulled a quick raiding party. They didn’t need a reason to kick José and Felipe’s asses beyond rolling them for whatever cash they had on them. Anyway, we convinced the cops to let it slide with a warning, the other kids were gone and ours said they didn’t know them. The cops said we could give our cousins a ride home but they’d follow to make sure us country boys got there okay -”
. He shut his eyes and listened to the fountain, loud in the enclosed space, the sounds of the city muffled here. He half-listened to the soothing murmur of Cas and Sam’s voices as Castiel named his ladies one by one, answered in delighted affirmatives as Sam guessed last name after last name, names Dean had never heard of.
Dean stared at Castiel, utterly baffled.
Castiel threw his head back and

, seriously, you saved me in there. Not to mention you’re kind of a huge deal around here and you’re so modest the
“Yes, sir?”  Dean’s voice was a tiny bit scratchy. He realized as he spoke these were the first words he’d said during the entire meeting.
Dean stared at Castiel, utterly speechless, as Castiel blithely continued, the last of his beer sidling up to his tongue and making it thick and unwieldy in his mouth.
“The pleasure is mine, Dean” Castiel parried smoothly, and he shook Dean’s hand gravely before releasing it. Tentative détente reached, they pretended not to watch each other as Anna fussed, making small talk and making sure to introduce Ash and the rest of the programmers to Dean before the meeting broke up and everyone went back to their desks.
“Of course,” Sam nodded quietly and was in the living room in moments, his headphones on and his laptop in his lap.
Castiel smiled, fetched the pie to the table, and then, to Sam’s visible delight, pulled a pint of Ben & Jerry’s Vanilla ice cream from his freezer with a flourish.
still believe in beauty Sam, he has all those flowers and that garden." Dean's face lit up for real. "Let's get him a really nice one of those, one he doesn't have already."
“I forgot,
“Yup.”
“No,” Sam replied flatly, “no,
Castiel twisted his hand in Dean's hair, and Dean whimpered as Castiel's lips met his flesh, the hot breath of the predator raising all the hairs on Dean’s body, Castiel’s teeth barely grazing the vein in Dean’s neck, but his lips and tongue observing no such restraint, sucking and licking bruises to Dean’s skin as Dean writhed and moaned, his fists clenching knots into his sheets, his back desperately arching towards Castiel to no avail with truly unfair levels of sheer
“I thought we weren’t thanking each other.”
I'm sorry I'm like this & thanks in advance for your consideration. :-D
Dean’s bark of laughter was very loud in the quiet hallway, and he covered his mouth self-consciously as he scrambled to catch up with Castiel, long strides carrying him away at a rapid clip towards the stairwell.
“When I cause you pain, Dean, I intend for it to be intentional.”
This weekend marks the nuptials of my friends, which I will be officiating and have been flipping out over for MONTHS.
The drawer had a plastic organizer and a really thoughtful selection of crap a guest could need, like Dean had occasionally seen in a basket in the bathroom at weddings, although this one was better stocked. There were tissues and single-serve packets of medicine choices - advil, antacids, benadryl and the like - he grabbed the tissues and a packet of advil  - and a set of nail clippers and various feminine hygiene products and a small bottle of hand lotion and another of hand sanitizer. He reached for the hand lotion too but wait
“I haven’t even told you - “
Anna watched them both carefully, delighted.  “Better grab your pool table, Dean.” She pointed as a pack of bros wandered into the bar and Dean scrambled to claim his table, stripping his suit jacket to toss over the chair he had been sitting in as he hightailed it to grab a pool cue and bait his trap, innocently leaning over to flub a couple practice shots as the frat boys circled, sensing easy prey in a pink dress shirt and suit pants.
, okay?”
“Your… your throat please, Sir,” he stammered, wincing in anticipation of the epic blue balls this was gonna cost.
Castiel held his breath, somehow ridiculously nervous, until the answer came in.
Castiel waited for the verdict, his eyes unfocused now, lost in the past, sad and sincere.
Castiel suffered Dean with the patience of more than one Saint he had personally had the honor of meeting over the years, methodically disrobing, stepping into the one-person shower beside Dean to perfunctorily shampoo and rinse his hair, and making a show of examining Dean.
"I won't,  Sam, I promise.  That's just so...
“Not goldfish,” Castiel confirmed, smiling at Dean while Sam shook his head at Dean, smirking.
Castiel glared at the email subject line “Please Welcome our New Hire.”  In this economy they were hiring someone new? After how hard he had to fight to get his old job back at a pay cut
Castiel leaned back to stare down at Dean’s face, his eyes pools of black as he pushed his finger forward, Dean’s breath rasping and shuddering as Castiel bottomed out at his knuckles and held it there, watching him.
“Dean. Follow me.”

“This is a ton of food, so I’m assuming your pretty boy’s giant brother is invited too.”
Dean complied immediately, his heart racing.
“I asked you to please call me Kit. And that’s not like you Castiel. I hope it was a good distraction at least?” She smiled kindly, and the rest of the group leaned forward on their respective chairs, keenly interested. Castiel had

Castiel’s face registered overwhelming relief, and he handed Dean a serving spoon for the taco fixings. “
Dean’s eyebrows rose. “What does that mean?”
“I didn’t, sir. My name is Dean Winchester.” Dean stared at the orchids in the corner. They were a fantastic riot of rich colors and patterns but his eye was drawn in particular to a dark purple one, the outer petals solid and almost black, the center petal mottled with even darker markings, and he stepped closer to her to marvel, his hands carefully at his sides, his eyes sparkling.

“What are the chances you’ve got a rolling pin, Cas?”

“When you surrender your will to me, Dean, during that time you are under my care. That is a sacred trust of utmost importance, and I accidentally gave you impossible instructions.”
Cas was a great host.
Castiel looked surprised, then some combination of hopeful and shy, the emotions traveling across his face in real time while Dean smiled at him encouragingly.
“About that. Until the semester’s over and Sam has completed my course it’s not really ethical for you and I to begin a relationsh -”
Just the way Dean was already plotting to find ways to make Castiel smile tomorrow.
Castiel held up a hand, a glowing white light lighting up the dark, and Dean blinked as his eyes adjusted, the wall of the cave black and kind of pulsing. Dean blinked again, but it was still doing it, and he leaned forward to look closer -
“That’s right!” Dean exclaimed, pleased. “Bullies just need to know you won't take it anymore. High five! I’m proud of you!”
seen, I think we've got what it takes to go all the way."
“That big client told my boss the deal only goes through if I train him on the software personally. I won't be able to do it, they’re going to know I lied.”
” Castiel turned away to play with the door latch again and missed Dean flushing in pleasure, the tips of his ears turning pink, but Sam saw it, and he turned away to smile into his textbook.
“I was manipulating time to extend your orgasms, and I lost track of the number of them.”
“I always want you, Dean, every minute of every day, I want you. Thank you for tonight, you were
“Okay!”
liked being fucked but his mind shied away from admitting such a thing - and he concentrated on Castiel’s face, Castiel's eyes still jet black, sparks flickering in their depths, and Dean found himself begging, not meaning to, it just slipped out.
“You ate a few bites, Dean, but you were falling asleep at the table, and Sam insisted I put you to bed.” Castiel suddenly looked worried, setting his plate down and studying Dean’s face.
Call Jimmy.
“I think so, sir. But I didn’t know him before…” Dean trailed off helplessly, thinking about what Sam had said about Cas not believing in beauty anymore, and his eyes went misty for a second before he clamped it down, hard. “Every few weeks?” he whispered, agitated, and Frank nodded at him, eyes wide.
,” and he knew he’d chosen well when he heard Dean smile, his voice cracking as he whispered back.
“How? No one else had health care.”
more obvious than Dean’s had been.
“I feel you kid, believe me.” He glanced at his watch and his wince mirrored Dean’s. “I have to run, Dean, my wife gets snippy if I’m late to dinner with the family. Come back two weeks from today, exactly two hours before delivery to Castiel’s garden, you hear me? I’ll stay open until five.”
Castiel picking up his shirt to sniff it was a surprise, as was his happy sigh before dropping it again.
“No! I got a ride in -”
We earn a number of the warning tags starting here, particularly glimpses into how Dean has been 'getting by', so brace yourselves, Best Beloveds. <3 :-D
Dean’s eyes and nostrils flared wide in terror but he nodded, and Castiel shook his head, growling.
“Burn a bag of popcorn in the breakroom and bring it back here with you.”
By the third helping Sam
Artwork was admired, bottles found their home pockets, and the group broke up to pull on coats and grin at each other, men making their way over to shake Castiel’s hand and earnestly congratulate him again on their way out. He found himself touched, and heartened, and even trembling a little as the last of them filed out, Stephen’s mumbled gratitude particularly moving. He turned to go, but his counselor stopped him with a hand on his arm.
The room was straight out of the seventies, looked like it hadn’t been updated since. It was surprisingly spacious - hideous olive everything, a kitchenette with a wheezing refrigerator and what looked like a much newer microwave on the faded formica counter, kitchen table with two chairs occupying most of the floorspace in the kitchenette area, a faded, mustard brown couch along the opposite wall with a clock Castiel actually found appealing wall-mounted over it - one of those atomic clocks from the fifties, the second hand still dutifully ticking. An art deco style room divider screen contraption was currently being repurposed on one side as a suit rack with bent wire hooks jury-rigged through the wrought iron and glass.
Castiel’s back arched and his hand stopped moving except to grip himself tightly, Castiel’s little whimpering noises
Sam laughed. “That’s a first for sure, Uncle Bobby never had anything but forty ouncers and liquor bottles, and liquor bottles are weird shapes.”
This time.
like this,
Dean fidgeted uncomfortably, his towel scratchy now, against the boner he
Sam nodded, echoed solemnly, “He told him.”
Castiel’s face was shy now, and he looked smaller somehow, his shoulders rounded, his arms limp at his sides.
Halloween fell on a Thursday this year. Castiel hadn’t paid any attention at work - yes, Anna had been wearing little cat ears on a headband and that made perfect sense now, but there had been Halloween candy in the breakroom in a big plastic pumpkin with a handle on it for weeks. He hadn’t paid attention to the actual date.  Castiel certainly noticed at  “Sugar Tonight,” however, the place was crawling with college students overflowing from neighboring bars, the frat brothers in lazy costumes and the young women in every variation of “sexy professional” he could have gone a lifetime without seeing - you couldn’t move for scantily-clad nurses and cops and, in one case, a scantily-clad lion tamer with a frat-boy tiger on a leash. Castiel ordered a double bourbon on the rocks and a good beer to chase it, and slowly made his way through the unwelcome interlopers to get to his friends at their usual table. The rest of his team had gotten there early enough to stake it out while he finished up some coding, and had stacked jackets on the back of a chair to hold it for him. Castiel sank into his perch gratefully, and raised his voice to be heard over the din.
“I said,
Maybe he could make flyers, score some direct calls to his extension, and score some sweet direct call
, a bourbon in his hand and a buzzing adrenaline in his veins. This was probably the dozenth time he’d come here since Dean started working for FindATable dot com, but tonight felt different because now he knew for certain that Dean enjoyed when he watched him play pool - had given him an explicit invitation to continue, in fact, last week - and that Dean
“No problem. Where to?”
But Castiel was already seating himself on the edge of the bed, his feet on the floor, and Dean gulped as Castiel looked at him expectantly, Dean's glance helplessly traveling to what Castiel expected him to sit on.
“No, you’re right, I don’t care about the company that much, in all likelihood I could get another job at a moment’s notice. The truth is more personal. I was on my own when I was Sam’s age. My father threw me out of his house over certain… religious differences, and not one of my older brothers showed more than the slightest passing concern about my welfare after that. It was a very difficult time for me and I fervently wish I had family that cared for me the way Dean cares for you, Sam, but I wasn’t so fortunate. I survived, but in retrospect I now realize that was more luck than anything else. I am moved by your situation and I would like to help. To pay it forward, if you will, because Dean is the kind of man I wish my own brothers had been and I want to see him succeed.”
want you. I also need to feed myself and take care of my responsibilities,” he sighed, pulling on a different pair of jeans from his closet while Dean watched, his eyes half-lidded and glowing almost yellow like a cat’s in the bright sunbeams breaking through Castiel’s curtains.
“You didn’t take advantage of me, Cas,” Dean said slowly, “but you have my

,” and Dean straight up moaned, immediately covering his mouth with his hand in surprise to hear the sound he had made.
Dean regretted his flippant tone immediately. “I’m sorry,” he stammered, “really.”
, actually. If one thing was for goddamn sure, if he was gonna go down this road, if he was going to admit something this daunting to himself -  or to anyone else for that matter - he didn’t want a hookup. He didn’t want to say goodbye the next morning and never see Cas again, he couldn’t even bear the thought. He wanted to see him the next day, and the day after that too. He didn’t even know what you called that.
Castiel sighed heavily, peering out the window at the flickering sign for the bar, while his stomach made another audible complaint.

“You really weren't, were you. Well, I’d be dying to know,” Dean muttered, sounding to Castiel’s ears maybe a tiny bit hurt.
- while Castiel beamed at them in delight, his eyes bright and dancing.
Castiel held the innocent straight face for several impressive seconds before he broke, his smile wide and bright. “Yes,” he admitted, looking
Castiel turned to look at Dean’s face, his eyes searching for something, fingers drumming on the steering wheel again, but now they were just... nervous. “It seems to have worked, yes? Again, I apologize for -”
father to Sam?  Castiel felt a creeping shame for doubting Dean’s motives. He chided himself for mentally casting aspersions on Dean’s loyalty to the imaginary lover he had assigned to that second bed. He watched the brothers finishing their horrible beers and arguing over whether Sam should have gone to dinner with the study group - “It was an expensive place, Dean!”  “You have to fit in, Sam!” - and when the decision came to him he did not hesitate.
“Yes?”

“Yeah. The parts that I can do on my own, I mean. I don’t want to go back to Vegas with anyone but you, Dean. Not anymore.”
Sam’s demand to know what was so funny got a firm headshake, but Dean grinned at him to soften the blow, and Sam’s little smile as he bent back over his homework said Dean was forgiven.
I attend a support group for veterans coping with post-traumatic stress disorder. They teach several coping techniques, none of which were exactly suited to your situation, but I extrapolated.”
“No.” he whispered. “Not since…” Dean faltered, searching Castiel’s face, but Castiel’s eyes held no judgement, none of the pity he was dreading. Dean found only kindness, concern, and he continued hoarsely, voice cracking, “not since the day my Dad passed and Sammy found me - “
It wasn’t a question, and Dean gulped, nodding.
Dean stared at Castiel with his mouth open for several seconds before realizing it and consciously snapping his mouth shut.

Castiel’s breathing was labored, his eyes glazed, and he spoke with difficulty.
“I don’t mind. And there’s nothing weird about good lubricant Dean, it’s

“I will wait as long as you need me to, Dean,” he said finally. “But when you are ready, on a clear night, you will drive us out to the desert in your Baby, and when you have chosen the place you wish to scream my name I will fuck you over her glistening hood under the stars until you weep for mercy, and only then will I let you come, with my name on your lips and my cock splitting you open, Dean, possessing you how no man ever has, and only I ever will.”
Castiel locked the stall door and was kneeling beside him in an instant, hesitating only a fraction of a second before pressing the length of his chest against Dean’s back, wrapping his arms around him from behind, his shoulders under Dean’s armpits and his biceps caging Dean’s chest like horizontal iron bars, one above the other, immediately tightening like a vice until Dean’s rapid gasping sounded more like choking.
“Consider it done. Now get some sleep so you can win your games tomorrow night, which, just so we’re clear, I fully intend to ogle you during.” Castiel grinned to hear Dean choke a little and then snicker, and he stifled a strong urge to whisper “
“We’ll find a way, Dean.”
“Don’t you dare.”
“Why couldn’t Sam do this hunt with you again?”
Dean couldn’t feel guiltier, his face agonized. All that time he’d selfishly let Cas give him orgasm after orgasm… well,
Dean grinned and nestled into Castiel’s chest, whispering back, “Four days was too long without you, Cas. I can only shower so many times a day, and nothing helped.
sorry, Dean; I should have held you all night. I didn’t mean to ask so much of you or to leave you alone afterwards, but... “ He faltered, and Dean finished for him.
“I did,” Dean whispered, his voice a rasping croak. “Thank you.”

Dean leapt to his feet and smoothed his features, crossed to the refrigerator and had two beers open in his hand by the time the
“That it did,” Castiel murmured, “and I suspect you wanted it to, or it wouldn’t have worked so well. Did you play me, Dean?”
“I logged you out of your workstation and locked your office for you” Castiel offered, as he turned the key and the engine sputtered to life, doing a rousing impression of a bag of rocks in a washing machine.
“Listen, those bees
.” Dean moaned softly, his cock twitching in response but his hands obediently laying perfectly still on his thighs, the bottle of lubricant tightly clenched in his fist, and Castiel’s eyes widened with shocked incredulity, gaping down at Dean with wonder at the
Dean hadn’t thought of that, and his stomach sank. He didn’t want anyone else to go with him, he realized suddenly, he wanted Castiel there. He wanted Castiel at his side, that white hot fury between him and the fucking handsy client. Dean’s carefully impassive face waited to hear what Castiel would say next with quiet dread pooling in his stomach.
“Really?”
, the footsteps coming towards the door only adding urgency and heat - he stopped moving his body so the bed wouldn’t creak but was unable to stop his hand’s rapid stroking - and then there was a quiet knock on the door and Castiel’s voice asking “Dean, are you awake?”
taught me that, Dean.”
I, uh, I had a nice time.”
“I wish you were here as well, Dean. I like when you watch me.”
“Sure, after you jack off, I mean. You know how to do that, don’t you, Cas?”
Okay so I've made a command decision re my fanfic publishing, and it feels so right & gives me so much relief I know it's the right thing for me. I will publish the rest of this work weekly through 10/4/19. I am crafting a gorgeous stopping point there which will make a satisfying place to end book one.  "Book one," being well over a quarter of a million words, which is more like THREE books tbh; so let's all pat ourselves on the back for being this invested in something with such a grand SCOPE, huh? :-D
Dean could feel Castiel’s head tilting, and he dared to make eye contact again, guilty jade meeting puzzled topaz.
, Cas. I’m not gonna - I’m not ready to let you do that to me, man, I’m sorry. I think I’ll just go ahead and have that gay panic right now.”
Castiel watched, rapt, as Sam searched his big brother’s face and believed the lie he found there. “Okay.” Sam’s concern visibly lifted as Dean expertly pried it from him and added it to the weight Castiel could see in the corners of his eyes.
go slow.
“Arrange yourself to receive me,” Castiel commanded, and Dean fell over himself to oblige, rolling onto his stomach and arching his back, Castiel’s little sigh of appreciation encouraging, but Castiel made no advance, and Dean looked over his shoulder, nervously moistening his lips, to find Castiel’s forehead furrowed in consternation.
He smiled as the boy’s face flushed with pleasure, toweling himself off as he turned away to return to his locker and pull on dry clothes. He hadn’t even had to lie, quite, and it cost him nothing to ease the sting of being measured and found wanting.
Castiel actually sounded a little shy, and a little strained, and Dean remembered, suddenly, that he’d only come once, some eternity ago. His glance flashed guiltily to Castiel’s cock, and his guilt increased exponentially at Castiel’s state, high and dry, metaphorically speaking, but actually more high and leaking and alarmingly purple.
“The house numbers were a pain to see,” Sam explained, “but other than that, yes, no problem.”
“Of course, Dean, I’m sorry.”
“I’m sorry, I’ve got to go pick up Sam.”
Castiel buried himself in debugging a booking glitch that had been reported in the company’s main site until Anna rapped on his cubicle on her way by, at which point he stood up and stretched, adjusted his tie, and pulled his suit coat back on before heading to the conference room. FindATable dot com had relaxed their dress code for everyone but the sales team since the burst of the dot com bubble had emptied most of the building, but he found that dressing well meant people had a much harder time categorizing him and tended to take his opinion more seriously, so he had chosen not to relax his own.
“Why aren’t you more hungover?” Castiel demanded playfully, an echo of Dean last night. Sam snorted but Dean winked and grinned at Castiel, carrying his mug to the table to pull up a chair and growing visibly excited to discover the giant carton of doughnuts waiting.
“And you seemed to
Castiel snorted, his eyes dark, and nodded. His eyes dropped to Dean’s mouth and Dean licked his lips and shook his head reluctantly, his breath hitching. “In a minute,” he whispered, his voice husky.
“I’m sitting on the bottom of the stairs Dean, because the couch hasn’t been -
You don’t smell certain.”
Sam beamed at Dean and Dean waved a hand modestly as Sam continued.  “Dean convinced the cops José and his brother Felipe were our little cousins on our Mom’s side, we’d come down to the big city to visit family - just found a bunch of kids bullying our cousins into shoplifting them some candy bars. Dean made it sound like some sort of lemonade stand fourth-of-july apple pie shit Cas, the cops just didn’t want to rain on his small-town backwoods fool parade.”  Sam grinned proudly at Dean, who accepted this praise as well-deserved, grinning back and smirking at Castiel proudly.
The girl looked at Castiel, who didn’t have the time to pretend he wasn’t watching so he did nothing. He kept his expression as neutral as he could, but he truly had no idea what his face was doing; this was outside the realm of his experience. She looked from Castiel to Dean and pouted fetchingly, disappointed. Dean bent down to whisper something that made her smile again, blushing a little, and she looked mollified as Dean squeezed her chastely with one arm, smiled a goodbye, and walked over to rejoin Castiel. Dean slid Castiel a beer and reclaimed his seat to a chorus of hoots and hollers.
“I know.”
“Uh, thanks for playing Cas, it’s kind of a big deal around here and I’ve never seen you play anything before last night - not pool anyway - wasn’t sure if you… “ Dean trailed off as Castiel quirked a brow at him and finished lamely “uh, could?”
didn’t even know it. Dude. You’re
Castiel’s sharp tone surprised both of them, and Castiel held out a hand in apology. “I’m sorry Dean, I meant, I don’t want you to blame yourself. This is
- look, I haven’t done the stuff you’re supposed to do first. I have condoms though, hang on -”
“I can’t say I wasn’t thinking about the exact same thing, Dean.”
Castiel’s sharp intake of breath felt incredibly loud in the enclosed space. Time slowed to a grinding halt as his mind swirled and churned, forgotten images and repressed memories tumbling in a cascade that made his chest tight and his heart pound.
worked right.
Late Monday morning Castiel looked up in surprise to see Dean at his cubicle door, today’s black suit and pale green silk tie over a crisp white dress shirt startlingly appealing in the way they brought out his eyes... which were flared white in panic, as were his nostrils. Castiel‘s face immediately went soothing, his hand reaching out reflexively for Dean’s arm, stopping in midair not even halfway through the journey there.
Dean waved at the fire again, and Castiel nodded, stepping forward to catalyze the fire with a whisper of grace, incinerating the pile to ash and putting it out in the same moment, before turning back to where Dean had just been standing.
The single raised eyebrow in the challenging glance that Castiel shot his way before returning his eyes to the road knocked Dean completely speechless. The warmth blowing in from the vents that had been welcome moments before was now somehow far too hot and Dean struggled to regain his composure as a flush crept up the back of his neck and made itself at home on the tips of his ears.
“I’d rather work my way around your bases. Steak dinner, after I get paid?”
Dean held Castiel’s gaze without flinching, watching the worry lines around Castiel's eyes change into something else as his pupils flared again, his lips parting this time. As Castiel’s eyes dropped to Dean’s mouth, Dean licked his lips, and slowly, carefully, enunciating every syllable, his voice a low growl, he murmured, “
Castiel watched in confusion as Dean undid his tie, gingerly removed his suit coat, and Castiel’s eyebrows rose in surprise. The underarms of Dean’s white shirt were drenched, and he crossed to the closet in his office, shucked the shirt and undershirt before Castiel could think to look away from the acres of freckles suddenly swimming in his vision. Castiel blinked and Dean was reapplying deodorant, blinked again and Dean was buttoning up another white shirt over a clean undershirt, retying his tie without even looking. He grinned at Castiel as he straightened the tie and pulled his suit coat back on.
Castiel surged to a sitting position with a groan that sounded like anguish. He reached for a hand towel from the nightstand as he swung his feet out of bed, wiped the worst of the lubricant and ejaculate from his engorged cock with a groan while Dean watched him, eyes wide, holding his breath. Castiel stood up and turned to face Dean then, his eyes raking slowly over Dean's naked flesh, almost all his weight back where it belonged now, acres of freckles still wantonly spattered with the evidence of their pleasure.
Surely some of those rich kids had guilty pleasures he could help them out with, and the higher pay would help with paying for his own minutes, for damn sure.
He was so close to home, just minutes away and he could take care of the tension screaming in his body… His mind slipped to Sunday night and he sighed in pleasure, taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out as he carefully maneuvered the narrow streets towards home, one hand impatiently pressing on his erection over his black wool pants.
“You may do as you please, of course, Dean, but this body has no disease and cannot get pregnant and is entirely clean.”
He turned to leave the meeting to get back to his cubicle, but Anna elbowed him in the ribs and he sighed, busted, and made his way over to where Dean was smiling down at several women from the sales team, arranged around him like so many groupies. It was embarrassing, really.
“Just let him, Cas. That door latch is killing him, look at him.” Sam snickered, and Castiel studied Dean’s face curiously to see what Sam saw. Dean was still smiling winningly but there was definitely a hint of pleading desperation around the edges, now that he was looking for it, and Castiel’s face broke into a huge smile as he nodded.
“‘Lonely? Need a friend? Call Jimmy!’ That’s what you’re giving people, right? They’re lonely, and you’re giving them someone to talk to. You’re
His reverie was interrupted by a knock at the door. Dean had just turned off the water and stuck his face out the bathroom door, toweling his hair.
Dean stared up at Castiel, completely speechless, as Castiel continued.
Castiel spoke loftily as he stepped through the door Dean held open for him, his face straight but his eyes twinkling with mischief. “Not for lack of trying, Dean, I assure you.”
Dean’s garbled cry of astonishment rapidly became a crescendo of desperate groans as Castiel moaned around his cock, sliding his throat up and down
Dean’s mouth fell open as he stared at Castiel’s face, grim in the reflected streetlights, his mouth a straight line.
pounds
Sam grinned, his mouth still full. “I second the motion. All in favor?”
Dean shuddered, his eyelids fluttering as Castiel slowed the hand still stroking Dean’s cock and squeezed instead, hard.
Castiel’s pupils were enormous, his lips bruised from Dean’s kisses, and Dean stared at him as he pulled out slowww, and
Dean nodded, blowing out a huge breath. He shut his eyes and forced himself to relax, his forehead dropping its tension first, then his shoulders, then his back, the slow wave of deliberate calm traveling steadily down his body as Dean consciously forced himself past the fear, to nervously examine what his body was actually feeling, instead of what he was expecting to feel.
Dean set his bottle down and stepped over to take a look. The milk and flour and onions were bubbling and creamy, definitely starting to thicken.  “Yep, looks good,” Dean approved. “You can stir in the cheese now, a little at a time, until it’s all melted. Should be ready juuuust about when the macaroni are al dente,” he explained, shoving a thumb into the easy-open perforations at the corner of the box of Muellers and pouring most of the elbows into the water. He stopped at some arbitrary point, his eyes narrowing at the size of the saucepan, and set the box down so he could grab the salt and give it a generous shake into the water. “I’ll be back,” he intoned as he stepped back to his pie, his Schwarzenegger not half bad, and Sam rolled his eyes and retreated to the living room.
You get extra next week to make it up to you, & because next week's stuff comes in a rush and doesn't want to be broken up. <3
I *thought* about cliffhanging after this one, and I want you to *appreciate* that I didn't. ;-) :-D
Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away from Castiel’s face, his pulse pounding throughout his entire body as he watched Castiel’s mouth form his next words.
We have come to the top of the roller coaster ride, all that shimmering tension, that moment of flying ends, and now the plunge, when gravity takes you and you hurtle down faster than feels like should be possible. I am releasing the next dozen chapters as a block, for no other reason than *I* cannot start this section without finishing it in it's entirety or it fucks me up for days, and *I* /know how it plays out/. Mind the tags; I think we earn most of them here. Take a deep breath. And don't take this plunge if you don't have time to read twelve chapters (36k) today, because there are no good stopping points for a little while.
Dean obeyed instantly, moaning without meaning to, and Castiel nodded his approval, growling and pulling almost all the way out to rock the tip of his cock over the end of Dean’s tongue, watching Dean’s jaw work to contain him. It was
"Okay. What?"
“Yes.” Castiel’s hand was sliding over Dean's cock again, slow and steady, and Dean’s eyelashes fluttered, his eyes rolling back a little at how
“Being human
Dean blushed absolutely crimson, nevertheless opening his mouth to accept the now ridiculously suggestive end of the fork that had heretofore been an innocent piece of apple pie. He shuddered as he closed his lips over the fork, Castiel never breaking eye contact as he slowly pulled the fork out of Dean’s closed mouth, set it on the table.
“Look at me.”
“START AT THE BEGINNING CAS!”
“I don’t have a roommate, Dean, and you’ve given me
’ -  and his own subsequent bolting without returning any favors, Dean
“What’s the damage, kid? Wait, shouldn't you be at school?”
Sam glanced over at a piece of notepaper stuck to the refrigerator with a dirty magnet the approximate size and shape of a bagel. “Looks like a pizza run at six, which we’ve missed the call-in for, another at eleven or one am, Burritos at nine from Juan’s place - Oh, Hey, Maria’s doing tamales at seven if we call by six, we haven’t done that in a couple weeks?” He looked hopefully towards Castiel and Dean, the question hanging in the air.
sore; but it had been.
Dean couldn’t keep the smirk off his face, and when Castiel grinned back, the first joy on his face Dean had seen all day, Dean felt giddy, suddenly, to see it. Maybe it was this particular beer loosening his tongue and stealing his inhibition, or maybe it was wanting to see Cas smile again, it just slipped out.
“Pardon?”
“Orphan High Fiiive!”
Dean nodded eagerly, and Castiel pushed his cock between Dean’s lips again, tilting Dean’s head back at the correct angle and tapping his shoulder just before his gag reflex should hit to distract him with the swallow. Dean’s eyelids fluttered and he whimpered as Castiel fucked into him. He didn’t feel like gagging anymore, now it just felt intensely arousing, his cock aching and leaking, neglected in his unzipped trousers where Castiel had left it. He remembered to tap for air before he got lightheaded, didn’t need the shoulder tap at the gag point this time as he opened his throat for Castiel to fuck him deep, and when Castiel growled, “Ohhh,
“Right? Keep your voice down, he’s smug enough already.”
“Alright, tell you what, I’ll split the ‘Kiwi Baron’ with you; half price and we can both sign the card, how about that?”
Next, Dean's mind idly explored his body, because he felt - well, he felt
“Your brother is a really good salesman Sam. He’s helping our company succeed and that’s good for my job security…” Dean scoffed and shook his head while Sam rolled his eyes, a united front of completely unconned con men.
Sam harrumphed his way back into the living room and Dean smiled fondly after him, turned to glare at the software, plopped himself back into the kitchen chair.
“There will be more nights, Cas, I promise,” Dean said softly, his hand coming up to stroke Castiel’s cheek.
, Brandon. May I run and get those, or should I check out with these items and come back?”
Dean turned dreamily to do as he was told, followed Castiel obediently downstairs, got into his car, put on his seatbelt only after being instructed to. Castiel drove them towards Stanford, holding Dean’s hand as Dean leaned against him, only letting go to reach up to caress his hair now and then. He demanded directions as they got closer and Dean gave them, his voice and his eyes far away.
Dean nodded vigorously. “My treat, least I can do. Let me just change my shirt.”
Castiel’s chest hurt.  He had pored over every possibility he could imagine for what Dean might be up to, but this was off the map. The dissonance he’d been trying to decipher the whole time  - how Dean could seem to genuinely care about people yet throw so many false notes at work - rearranged itself in his mind and the reality was so much greater than the sum of the parts. Dean
“Baby spiders,” Castiel answered calmly, lifting his palm upwards towards the roof of the cavern, lighting up what looked like hundreds of dust motes floating in the air. “There must be thousands of them. They’re in the air, too, floating on little silk balloons, aren’t they fascinating?”
I think it’s safe to assume I can prepare your ‘human anatomy’ to receive me.
Past the divider were two motel style double beds, each barely large enough to contain an adult, which caught Castiel’s speculative attention. Two? If Dean was this obviously looking to live on the cheap, wouldn’t it have been cheaper to rent a single? Or had he been cheating on someone with Anna?
Castiel didn’t say a word, just leaned back into the passenger seat and shut his eyes, his face vaguely melancholy, and Dean’s chest ached while his mind furiously worked up half a dozen different conversational gambits, only to reject them out of hand.
. How many times had he imagined this exact thing, he couldn’t even begin to count.
“Aren't you gonna ask?” Dean was lacing a boot with his leg stretched across the coffee table. These clothes suited him, Castiel realized; these were Dean’s clothes. The suits were a costume, one Dean wore well. But not him.
Mood: Gentle domesticity, a little frustration on both sides figuring out Cas's samefoods.
Castiel turned back to Dean with black silk boxers in his hands, mournful now, his head tilting sideways again at the utter shock on Dean’s face.
this felt, his breath shuddering out in a rush as he fought himself, trying to find the strength to say no.
Dean shook his head in horror, eyes impossibly wide.
And yet… he remembered vividly the handful of times he had put his hand on Cas’s hand, or on his bare arm, how they both stared at the point of contact. Maybe it wasn’t just his imagination, feeling that electricity passing between them, maybe Cas felt it too. Cas never leaned into him when Dean crowded him in his kitchen, secretly reveling in the closeness, but there were times Dean could swear he could feel Cas wanting him to lean in.
“Cas, can you  - “
“Uh, well, let’s see, he’s hot, he’s athletic, he’s a single bachelor, and he lives in San Francisco?” Sam listed his bullet points rapid-fire, ticking them off on his fingers as he listed them.
laid out like a wrapped gift, and he shook his head in frustration as Dean’s effect on his body did not go unnoticed, a
“But I begged you for it, and you couldn’t say no to this sweet ass.”
This little window into Dean's work is dedicated to StellaOO, who was excited to get to see it. Although I had intended to leave it to our imaginations, I had to agree I foreshadowed it enough to leave us wanting, so I added this and now I couldn't possibly live without it. :-) <3
It felt weird, maybe too intimate a request, but Dean was already buttoning Castiel’s wrists, already reaching for the buttons at Castiel’s waist, before he could find a way to articulate maybe this was something friends didn’t do for each other, Castiel’s breath rasping over his lips in rapt attention hypnotic somehow, Castiel’s attention heavy on his hands as they rose towards his neck, buttoning each button in turn, until he discovered he was short a button, and Dean shook his head, smiling, rapidly reversing course to try again, unbuttoning his way down Castiel’s chest, Castiel’s eyes widening in surprise.
Please note that due to an egregious publishing error on my part, Monday of this week already saw the release of three new chapters that were accidentally left out just before Thanksgiving, now numbered 20,21 and 22. (All subsequent chapters have been renumbered.)
Sam and Dean had been watching him carefully, weighing his words against his face, and they now turned to each other to confer silently. An entire conversation passed between them without a word, ending with Sam looking insistently and pleadingly at Dean, who finally shrugged and nodded his assent.
Castiel thought about that carefully. Anna’s face and body language always matched what she said out loud, and he had never seen her gossip. She was smart, and funny, and he was fond of her. “Yes, I do,” he decided.
Dean couldn't breathe, and he abruptly opened his door to leap out into the night, collecting himself for a few seconds until he trusted his voice to speak, then leaning down to catch Castiel’s confused eye.
Dean didn’t call him until after ten, exhausted beyond measure, and Castiel had already gone for a run and watered his garden and eaten dinner and masturbated until it hurt by then, so he took the phone into his garden to sit on the bench under the twinkling fairy lights so Dean could hear the fountain and say goodnight to the poets, too.
Castiel’s eyes lifted to meet Dean’s again, his pupils just as flared as Dean’s.
The hair on Dean’s arms stood upright and ripples of gooseflesh raced around to the back of his neck with the realization. “Me,” he whispered softly. “He looks at me.”
There was no sound of chairs scraping, no sound at all as she stepped away, returned to her chair and sat down. Castiel scowled at the circle of silent faces, wiping his eyes with the back of his sleeve, as one by one the shock on their faces relaxed into smiles of encouragement and support.

” as Castiel knocked again, his voice rumbling “Dean? Are you alright?” through the door and incidentally throughout Dean’s entire body.
“What happened?”
Cas. Let me see the Castiel I felt when I bent over that pool table,
Castiel was incredulous, staring at Dean’s face, and Dean licked his lips nervously, nodded.
Dean, and so miserable all the time, no wonder Ephraim was so confused -"
“Thank you,” Castiel muttered, pulling them on without meeting Dean’s eyes. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know. The men at the Y display theirs without shame, some of them even copulating with one another in the steam room or the showers.”
“You give off a vibe sometimes, Cas. Be friendly.”
Dean demonstrated, gasping as his hand closed around the base of his cock, Castiel’s attention far more arousing than it had any right to be.
to work here in May this year after - after stepping away briefly for a personal matter. I was one of the first hires from the day the company started, sir.  Five years ago, sir, from the Spring of ‘97, until September of 2001.”
Castiel stared at Dean hopefully, a smile playing on his lips but his brow still creased. “Will you

lingering on the dip between Castiel’s pecs -
“Seven minutes,” Dean declared. Castiel leaned forward obediently to set the timer with his non-stirring hand. Dean nodded to himself, pleased, and poured spiced and sugared apples into his makeshift pie tin, stuck his thumb in the ice water to wet the edge of the bottom crust. He rolled out the top crust, humming quietly to himself, rolled the circle of crust up around the wine bottle, smoothly reversed course to unroll it over the top of his pie, slice off the excess, flute the edges with his thumb and forefinger. He could feel Castiel’s attention on him like he had at the pool hall and it felt… nice. He was good at pie and proud of his crust and his makeshift salad-tin improvisation, and he preened a little, looked up at Cas with a smile.
Dean shoved his phone away again, gulping air and trying not to hyperventilate as he sweated through his second shirt of the day, his heart pounding in his ears. The rising adrenaline in his stomach twisted around his sandwich from an hour ago and he felt abruptly nauseous. He scrambled to reach for his wastebasket in time, but the wave passed as he got the basket between his knees, just a little bile in his mouth, no sandwich wasted. The second wave came just as he heard the quiet knock on his door, and he heaved his lunch into the metal basket as the door opened and Castiel let himself in, locked the door behind him, rushed to Dean’s side.
Castiel stared at Dean, puzzled. Dean looked surprised, then shook his head.
“Not going to tell HR then?” she remarked, helping Castiel to pick up chips and put them back in the bag, garbage now. “Solid move. They got all evangelical up in there and it is
Dean’s eyes slid shut, tears still slipping out from under them as Castiel kissed the salt from his face and petted him gently, soothing the sobs racking his body. He didn’t really notice Cas unzipping his jeans but he
Castiel shrugged, his hands sliding up Dean’s thighs now, a wave of raw sexual desire, almost painfully acute, trailing in their wake, and Dean gasped, his back arching off the bed as Castiel’s hands reached his hips, Dean’s lips still sputtering protests as Castiel answered him gravely.
one won’t age -  but I understand this body is not your preference. Unless - wait, is it the body, or is it because it’s me inside it?“
have in his collection. “For washing fruit,” he had explained simply.  Dean dumped the noodles, rinsed them under cold water, carefully considering how to proceed. New friendships could be such careful dances of getting to know each other, but he just…
Dean had never hated anyone more in his life. Not Zeke for making him kick Cas out of the bunker, not Lucifer for fucking with Sam, not even Yellow Eyes. He hated them all
“Should we order something for dinner?” Castiel asked. “My treat. We need to study and you can’t cook and study Dean… “ he mused almost to himself “I could eat ten more of those... “ then added, conversationally, “Pizza? Got a phone book?”
Dean nodded as well as he could and dared to reach up to brace himself by gripping Castiel’s thighs, asking if it was okay with his eyes. Castiel nodded his permission gravely, gripping the sides of Dean’s head with both hands and tilting his face up and back just a little more before thrusting deep into Dean’s throat, groaning his approval as Dean leaned into his thrust and moaned with pleasure.
“Shoot, that’s the dirty one, Cas, try on this one -”
Cas, and it would be really nice to skip all the worrying for once and jump straight to the ease. He shook his head and went for broke.
When Castiel let out a soft snore Dean gave up on normal, reaching out to grab the edge of the comforter and pull it over both of them like a soft-shell taco, his eyes fluttering shut as he wrapped his arms around Castiel and nestled his chest to his friend’s back, sighing in contentment that no one was there to overhear.
Castiel laughed as she leaned up on tiptoes to whisper in his ear, “
"He used to like poetry," Sam said quietly.
pinned to a chair suddenly bright and glowing and beautiful. “What ARE YOU?” He demanded. It reminded him of Castiel’s smile. As he thought of Castiel’s smile the thing grew too bright to look at, suffusing him with the feeling of soft warm victory he felt on those rare occasions he could make Cas laugh.
“I masturbated until I chafed myself and my arm had cramps, imagining what else I would like to do to you.”
Castiel laughed, grinning at her as he popped another chip in his mouth, chewed pensively.
rippling over him; tremors that shivered over Dean’s body. Castiel watched with intense satisfaction, and when the wave had passed, Dean’s arousal showing no signs of standing down, the flush high on his cheeks, Castiel nodded and reached for the bottle of lubricant he’d dropped in the bed. He handed it to Dean, who opened his hand to accept it with confusion furrowing his face, and Castiel pressed his thumb to Dean’s bottom lip, shuddering as Dean’s lips parted immediately to accept it.
“What? Dude, don’t worry about it, thank you for talking me down from… ” Dean waved his hand helplessly. “What do you even call this?” he asked plaintively.
Dean froze, horrified he’d been overheard, but the low murmur of conversation below did not stop, so he dared to grind up into his fist again, trying to hold his breath so he wouldn’t moan but beginning to pant anyway, the delicious friction of the circle of his hand somehow much hotter if he fucked up into his slick downstroke like he meant it instead of just moving his hand. He shut his eyes and tried to picture a woman riding him but he could hear the low tones of Castiel saying something downstairs and it was too distracting, he could actually make out words now, Castiel’s voice becoming more distinct, saying “I’ll check if he’s awake,” footfalls on the stairs, but he was too close,
“Sir, I can’t do anything about the face god gave me, but I
“I am going to go wash my hands and brew a fresh pot of coffee, Dean. While I am gone, I want you to masturbate, but you must not give yourself an orgasm. Stop before you come, then start again when the urgency has passed. I am going to come back up here when I’m done starting the pot of coffee and doing a few things in the kitchen. I’m going to walk up the stairs and down the hallway and I am going to knock on this door, and you are going to say ‘Come in,’ and when I open this door, I expect to see you coming, do you understand?
Dean’s joke fell flat, Castiel’s disappointment palpable as he shrugged and turned away towards his waiting clothes, tossing his towel over a chair, heedless of his nudity.
“He did NOT.”
“Frank,” Frank muttered. “I told you to call me Frank.” He pondered for a long moment, his gaze somewhere in the middle distance, before coming back to focus on Dean, who was staring dejectedly at the flower he most certainly could
was the part that aroused me.
Castiel never touched him. Even if sometimes Dean could feel the weight of Castiel's glance curl around his chest like a physical caress. Dean shivered a little at the sense memory, and thought hard. Beyond those first panic attacks, Dean could not remember a single instance where Castiel had ever been the one to reach out, ever touched his arm or his shoulder, ever stepped into his personal space. On those few occasions Dean had hugged Cas to offer comfort, Cas didn't really even hug back.
The sound of Dean choking was intensely satisfying, and Castiel treasured every moment of it.
Castiel loaded his items onto the checkout conveyor belt humming to himself, and was startled to be winked at by the grinning cashier as he glanced at the selection of items.
The space was a straight-up zen garden. The fences were bamboo, at least ten feet tall in the tallest parts, lashed together with black twine and arranged so the top of the fence formed gentle repeating waves. The ground was covered in several thick inches of gray pea gravel, raked into concentric circles, that crunched deliciously underfoot as they tiptoed down into what was obviously Castiel’s sanctuary.  He had a large black marble vase fountain in the center, burbling water over it’s lip and sides from a source they couldn’t see, several carefully pruned shrubberies, string lights criss-crossing the space that looked like they’d be magical at night; but what stole Dean’s breath was the flowers.
Dean stopped instantly, his body going limp in Castiel’s arms as the dismay took hold.
I'm telling you now so you can prepare yourselves for a vague-tweeting hiatus. :-)
His phone buzzing on his nightstand took Dean by surprise. What else could Sam possibly want to talk about, he’d be home in like forty minutes -
Dean nodded eagerly, he could do that.
Dean grabbed another beer and plopped down on the end of the bed to collect himself, flipping on the TV to be polite, and because he absolutely, positively, did not want to overhear Castiel
“I would like to do… what you said. With you.”
“I’m sorry I broke your trust, Dean.” Castiel’s face was serious, his voice grave.
“Okay now the other way - “
“It’s a Zen garden, Dean.”
, and Castiel groaned, pleased.
“Good morning, Dean.”
Mind the tags, and I will trust you to hold our boys in your heart.
“I’m in love with him,” Dean breathed softly, astonished. “I didn’t know.”
“Yeah?”
“Gladly, if you’ll have me, but I’m hardly going to win any fresh titles. Does this mean you’re going to switch teams for me?”
Castiel studied Dean Winchester carefully as he charmed his way around the room, glad-handing and greeting new coworkers with that easy smile that reached all the way to his eyes. Castiel could see that the picture hadn’t done him justice, and further, that no still image ever would. He was beautiful in the photograph, but it hadn’t been able to capture the grace with which his features moved, or the charisma that radiated from his warm smile; the ripples he left in his wake. People would fall over themselves to do anything to please a man like that, Castiel mused, carefully keeping his face neutral.  No wonder he was in sales. He had probably never wanted for anything in his life and cared for other people only as far as what they could do for him. Castiel knew the type well.
“Shut up. I shouldn't have told you.”
“ - Nobody ever wins when the cops show up Cas,” Sam cut in, “that’s just the golden rule. The other kids scattered before the cops got out of their car but José and his brother Felipe were trapped - they were standing next to us. If they followed the other kids they’d get the beating - and it turned out lose their Mom’s grocery money for the week - and the cops had already seen them up close, so those boys took a chance on us. You should have seen Dean though, he’s
“Yes, Dean, you begged me, and your need was more important to me than what I wanted.”
“It’s easy to have great taste when you can afford it,” Dean observed wryly. “But, y’know,”  Dean offered saucily, batting his eyelashes theatrically, “feel free to buy me as many rounds as you like, Daddy Warbucks. ”
“Come on now,” Castiel defended Dean, his tone mild, “it could easily have been goldfish. Plenty of folks prefer goldfish for a pond this small.” He gazed down at the fish, nosing around the lily pads hunting for crumbs, and murmured softly, “But I believe a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, and that goes for little fishes in small ponds, too. Someday they’ll be big fishes in a small pond, thinking that’s their whole world, and then they’ll take a little trip and have their tiny carp minds
Dean grinned and batted his eyelashes, but Castiel didn’t smile, his face serious.
“Is that another way to say masturbating?”
“I want to taste you. You smell
“But how are you gonna-”
The first answering text came in after three, and Castiel winced at the implication that Dean had been out at lunch meetings for
two hours every time, and he’d been getting pretty good at it. There were jeers and general scoffing at this endorsement, and the bartender offered to put twenty bucks on the game himself if the participants would all put in another twenty, and to hold the bet to make it all official and whatnot.
I won’t be needing a barrier between us when I fuck you.”
“Do you like it?” Castiel’s voice was… shy, and Dean’s startled glance flew to Castiel’s face.
When Castiel pulled into the horseshoe on Saturday, the noonday sun baking the air above the concrete and asphalt into shimmering waves of heat, he was surprised to discover half of it was now a basketball court. Two full teams were battling for supremacy on the court with a small crowd of onlookers, mostly women and children, cheering and shouting. Castiel pulled up in the first available slot that wasn’t part of the de facto game court and joined the crowd of onlookers, coming to stand next to Alejandro, who was icing a swollen knee. Alex grinned wildly at Castiel and then returned to hollering, “Foul him, Manuel! Kick Blanquito’s asssssss!”
“We’re friends, so it’s no big deal. I was just saying, in general.”
Dean‘s hands were shaking as he unlocked Baby’s trunk, pulled out gasoline and a lighter, and doused his clothes and boots before setting them on fire.
“Up here, Dean. It’s much harder to clean the carpet.”
“Cut it out Ash,” Anna interceded. “We were all watching Dean. Don’t give Cas shit, your mouth was hanging open the whole time.”
Dean groaned in frustration, and he felt Castiel smile against his ear in response. Cas was definitely all the way hard now, his dick pressing insistently against the curve of Dean’s ass.
For a moment time slowed, Dean kneeling on the floor staring up at Castiel’s face, Castiel staring into Dean’s eyes, his fingers still gently cradling the side of Dean’s face. Dean’s hand twitched but he did not reach for his cock, and Castiel’s eyes followed the motion to Dean’s hand, then his cock, then traveled back up to Dean’s face, and his lips curved into a dangerous smile.
“Look at me this instant,” Castiel growled, “and do not avert your eyes unless I tell you to.”
By the third time going through the demo on his laptop under Castiel’s watchful eye Dean wanted to pull his hair out.
“Of course, Dean.”  Castiel’s smile was radiant. “Thank you.”
"How do you know that? Did you snoop? What do you mean, used to?" Dean was dying of curiosity, but now Sam looked uncertain.
Castiel felt no need to explain their current living circumstances, so he smiled and nodded, collected his coat from the chair where he’d set it for the hug, and made his escape to his car.
The nerves dancing in Castiel’s stomach spread into warm anticipation, making his throat feel thick and his chest feel tight. He dithered for a minute and finally just kept his response simple and honest.
Dean looked from one to the other of them in confusion but they were so pleased with each other he didn’t want to intrude, so he figured he’d ask Sam later, stepping around the two of them to check out the side of the garden Sam had been hanging out in. There wasn’t just a stone bench, there was a tiny
“Yes, yes it worked!” Dean interrupted, his sincerity palpable. “I appreciate it, seriously it’s okay. I was just surprised, that’s all. It was actually kinda nice, haven’t been hugged in... “  He trailed off to silence, cheeks flushing, only this time Castiel’s full attention on him made it worse.
“Come on, Cas, talk to me. Where's the Cas that begged me to fuck him this afternoon,
Castiel didn’t pause this time, didn’t tease, firmly gripped Dean’s hip in one hand and cradled his balls in the other, one adept finger pressing firmly up into his perineum behind them. Castiel knelt between Dean’s thighs and gave him as much pleasure as he knew how, while Dean’s back arched off the carpet and he screamed and convulsed, spilling wave after wave of ecstasy into the heat of Castiel’s throat.
Dean stared in shock at Castiel’s hopeful face, trying to figure out how to explain that guy friends just didn’t
“Yes, but this is the night you told me you were mine, Dean.” Castiel’s eyes glittered with sudden emotion, soft blue pools now, threatening to spill over, and Dean leaned down to kiss his forehead where it was crinkled again.
The water-damaged placard hanging inside the door said OPEN, but no one appeared to be around as Dean pulled the door open and stepped into the warm humidity of the greenhouse, his feet crunching pleasantly on pea gravel as he did a slow 360, whistling through his teeth. This place wasn’t laid out like the others had been, with their rows and tables of flowers in standard pots with clearly marked prices and care tags. This place was a riot of color, with wildly colorful plants in all different bright colors of ceramic pots hanging from the ceiling and walls and in several dozen cases from each other. Dean could barely move for cascading plants in the way and he threaded his way carefully between them, trying desperately not to bump into anything while trying to read the labels, which were barely legible hand-scrawled copper tags with genus and species only;  no common names, no care instructions, no prices.
“How the hell should I know?”
“Did I do it right?”
“I’m sorry Castiel, that’s just the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.” Castiel smiled at her, shaking his head with the barest hint of an eyeroll as she waved her hand dismissively. “Go on, get home to your man.”
enjoy the knowledge you taught me last night, so...
Castiel’s eyes widened with horror and he squeezed Dean tight, rocking him and petting him and soothing him with gentle assurances,
“Sorry. Those headphones weren’t cheap, Sammy, and I have to replace the food money that I used to buy them. I’ll get a headset as soon as I can, and lock myself in the bathroom for as long as I can stand it until then, but I guess that means your ears are doing time ‘til at
“Around,” Cas retorted brusquely. “I know, I probably make you scream and cry, but I
“I didn’t mind, Dean. Giving you pleasure was
Castiel growled his approval and started to groan in earnest, his vocalizations coming faster and faster with his breath until he came with a guttural shout, his body still completely motionless as Dean swallowed and swallowed until Castiel’s hand caressed the side of his face, then Dean reluctantly slid his mouth off Castiel’s cock, his eyes lifting to meet Castiel’s hooded gaze.
Dean rolled up on one hip, embarrassed, ripping at one of the foil packets he’d been clutching in his fist, while Castiel watched, fascinated.
Dean stifled a yelp as Castiel wrapped his hand around his cock and slid it down experimentally, then back up, his eyes lifting to meet Dean’s, another question on his face.
, Castiel resolved firmly,
made a difference, he noted with a sigh of surrender, and he watched Sam plow through his piece and reach for a second before Castiel had even taken a second bite with warm satisfaction curling around his heart.
“Is honey vegan?”
old enough to be your father in any polite version of society...”  Dean beamed at Castiel, his smile growing by degrees, until Castiel raised one eyebrow in challenge. Dean’s smile froze, his eyes growing wide instead, as Castiel continued sternly “And in any other circumstance where that title would be appropriate, it is nevertheless my understanding that you must

Dean bucked and moaned and tried desperately to grind up for friction, but he was held fast, and Castiel waited until the little twitches in Dean’s cock had stilled and he stopped fighting before breaching him just a tiny bit with his index finger, swallowing at the same time to give Dean plenty of sensation to process. Dean tensed and moaned, and Castiel pulled his finger back, slid his mouth slooowly off Dean’s cock, took a breath, and swallowed him back down while gently pushing his finger back in, a little further this time.
Castiel couldn’t resist the urge to tease a little, and he managed to carefully open his sandwich wrapper, examine it for pickles, and open his chip bag, contemplatively chew an entire chip and swallow, before Anna exploded, mock pummeling his arm and hollering, “OH MY GOD TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU ASSHOLE” with the biggest smile he’d ever seen on her face.
“Obviously, I was wrong. I apologize for making you uncomfortable. I won’t ask again.”
“I meant weird that I’m asking you where you get your brand and you’re gonna send me home with a self-starter pack.”
“Thank you.” Dean shot Cas a look of pure agony, and he dropped his voice and begged. “Now please, for the love of god can we go somewhere before Sam needs a ride,
Castiel stood at the foot of the bed, socks and sneakers in one hand, the other akimbo on his hip, his eyes soft as he finished the thought. “Trust me, Dean, it’s taking all the willpower I have not to keep pressing that lever like a rat, until we both perish of starvation, I suppose.” He smiled affectionately down at Dean, caressing a naked foot with the tip of his index finger, watching Dean’s entire body shudder and his pupils, tiny in the sunshine, twitch valiantly and then shrink again.
“Nature, Dean. Sure as hell wasn’t nurture.”
Dean watched Castiel carefully cut the pie into perfect eighths, plate three wedges with his only spatula, scoop out ice cream with what looked like a brand new ice cream scoop. Dean accepted his plate with a gracious smile, his fork poised to dive in, but he didn’t take a bite until he watched Castiel carefully cut a bite with his fork, spear a sliver of ice cream, pop it in his mouth. Castiel did not make a sound, but his eyes slipped closed and his eyelashes actually fluttered in pleasure, Dean’s entire body flushing with warmth to see it. Only then did Dean take a bite, nodding in satisfaction as the crust melted in his mouth. The fancy grass-fed organic butter Castiel had insisted on
He disappeared through the back door to the greenhouse still talking and Dean ducked through to follow him, his eyes practically bugging out of his head to realize he was in another enormous greenhouse, not quite as big as the first but brand new, and a lot less crowded - only about half as densely packed as the first space.
Short week this week, because I am frantically writing a missing chapter I need *really* soon for publication. Or, more accurately, frantically procrastinating it by writing delicious sex off the end AAAUGH. :-D
"In any case, I thought Nora and I were going to eat dinner together, so I didn’t eat the expired hot dogs tonight, which I now greatly regret.”
with you.
Dean reached back through the mists of time to vaguely recall fumbling experiments in the dark, and he flushed furiously even thinking about it now.
“His father kicked him out for ‘religious differences.’”
This chapter is therefore early, and shorter than usual. I promise you will get extra next week, and I trust I will be forgiven, given the nature of the content. ;-)
“Yes, Sam, you certainly would be,” Castiel agreed, nodding solemnly, but offering no further information.
Castiel fired up his Old Lady and pulled out his phone just in case. Despite it being well past seven, there was no text from Dean, but Castiel shoved his phone and his disappointment back into his pocket to think about their weekend together instead, smiling as he pulled away from the curb; not even sure where to start there were such riches to treasure.
Dean could hear Castiel banging around in the kitchen, doing dishes maybe? But he wasn’t doing as Castiel had instructed and that felt bad, made his stomach twist in unpleasant ways, so he tried again, wrapping his hand around his cock slowly and -
“I get that, Sam.”
The flush in his face felt hot, the moment awkward as hell, and Dean didn’t dare look up as Castiel lithely stepped out of bed to dress himself again, somehow fresh and sweatless and smelling of nothing at all, anymore.
Dean couldn’t seem to bring the words “
Time stood still. There was a complete absence of sound, like a vacuum had sucked all sound from the universe except for the rushing of blood in Castiel’s ears. There was nothing he could do now. This had been a safe space, but he had ruined it. He would have to find a new group and keep his mouth shut. Castiel’s tightly shut eyes stung with tears but he ignored them to breathe slowly; it wouldn’t be the first time he had wept in front of these men, but it would clearly be the last.
Dean could hear the same awe Castiel had stared at him with then echoed in his voice now, and he preened with satisfaction to have his
Castiel grasped Dean’s outstretched hand firmly in his own and found it warm and dry, his palm tingling at the contact. Dean smiled and Castiel begrudgingly quirked a slight smile in return, warily watching Dean watch him. There was far more intelligence in those eyes than he had anticipated, not just the shrewd cunning of a fox. He was being observed just as keenly as he was observing, which was startling, but there was something else there he hadn’t expected. Pain. It was subtle, he wouldn’t have noticed it if he hadn’t known what to look for; but this kid - god he couldn’t be more than what, twenty-five? Alright, man then - this man had not had everything in life handed to him. Castiel softened just a little and let his half-smile reach his eyes.  Dean nodded almost imperceptibly and squeezed his hand slightly before graciously offering “I am pleased to meet you, Castiel.”
- your tongue - in my mouth -
. He wrapped his still slick hand around his swelling cock and groaned.
so appreciated. Cas seemed shy over the phone though, stilted, nothing like his confidence in person.
They got up, stopping by the men’s room to throw away their waste and wash up and smooth their hair. Castiel’s shirt was wrinkled and his suit jacket was unwearable, but Dean’s hair and clothes looked great, only his dreamy stare and complete absence of cognitive processes a giveaway for what they’d just been up to. He stood waiting for Castiel to finish rinsing his face and mouth and smoothing his hair and then just kept standing, staring blankly as Castiel headed for the door, turned to call him.
By the time they’d flipped through all the channels, none of which had any solo guy action going, Dean had an uncomfortable boner, and an even more uncomfortable dread swirling in the pit of his stomach, his nerves jangling as Castiel begged him distractedly, his eyes glued to the screen.
“GUYS I’M RIGHT HERE!” Sam was laughing but there was a note of real horror in his voice and they apologized while Sam did up his seat belt, fiddled with the controls for a minute to figure out where everything was, and pulled away from the curb with a roar of acceleration, putting the Pimpmobile through her paces.
“I’m looking for a gift for a friend.”
“You can have what’s left,” Dean declared, “after the working men take their share.” He grinned and tipped a couple empanadas out of the bag into a napkin before handing the bag and a stack of napkins to Castiel, who was leaning over the tiny kitchen sink washing his hands. Castiel took one of each and passed the rest along to Sam’s grabby fingers.
Castiel held Dean tightly, whispering to him gently until the sobs racking his body eased. As Dean hiccuped and quieted, his breathing slowing as he finally relaxed into Castiel’s embrace, Castiel blew out a long breath with a shudder, sucked in another, and whispered, “
“You were having a panic attack -”
“What is it Dean?” Castiel murmured quietly, his eyebrows raised in concern.
If you are reading as a WIP - and bless you if you are, I treasure you so much - this week's release (7/23/2021), is two short chapters including this one and the next and ends in a cliffhanger. Not a terrible one, frustration and angst though, so if you don't want to sit with Dean's frustration and angst for a week maybe hang back 'til next week. It's just such a perfect cliffhanger! :-D
He accepted the serving spoon from Dean gravely as Dean handed it off so he could tilt and pour tomatoes, and busied himself spooning lettuce. It was inefficient at best, and he could
until the police came for them.
“I have excellent taste, Dean.” Castiel deadpanned, “unlike some people.” He managed to successfully look both haughty and serious for several seconds until Dean punched him in the arm lightly and he broke, grinning.
his pleasure into the crook of his own elbow; into the searing heat of Castiel’s eager throat.
if you call me while I’m here - “
Dean pulled his suit coat on gratefully and buttoned it over his disheveled dress shirt. There was nothing he could do about his soggy knees, but Castiel - first checking up and down the hall with the men’s room door barely cracked open - stepped out and motioned to him to follow and Dean fell in lockstep behind him without hesitation.
“Of course, Dean.”
, he thought smugly, grinning to himself, and yet he’d clearly accepted one recently. It must be maddening to wonder what Adonis could finally have turned his head, and Castiel gave in to the urge to preen just a little, arching his back and tilting his head back under the water to expose the column of his throat as he rinsed his hair. He actually heard someone sigh, and he couldn’t resist opening his eyes to raise an eyebrow at the young culprit, showering nearby, who flushed but stood up a little straighter under Castiel’s scrutiny; held his gaze hopefully, biting his lip.
“Alright Dean,” Castiel answered, “There are towels in the bathroom, first door on the left.”
“Dean, are you alright?”
Castiel stroked him dry, teeth and tongue now working around the shell of Dean’s ear, his other hand twisting a nipple through thin cotton until Dean’s whimpers sounded more like warning cries, then he yanked Dean backwards while sweeping his knees out from under him, easily lowered him to the floor, caught the last of Dean’s yelp of surprise in his mouth as he knelt beside him to shove a knee between his thighs. Dean whimpered and moaned and sucked on as much tongue as Castiel would give him, arching against the thigh Cas was grinding against him only to stop every time Dean got close, his panting breath laced with beer and pie and desperation.
him, sliding his mouth down over Dean’s cock in one smooth motion until Dean’s entire cock was buried in Castiel’s throat, much further than Castiel had fucked Dean only minutes before, Castiel’s nose buried in the dark hair curling over his pubic bone. Castiel pushed his finger into Dean’s body slowly, inexorably, curving back until he found the bundle of nerves he was looking for, and then he pressed against it in slow pulses while he fucked Dean’s cock with his throat.
“Okay, whenever you’re ready Dean. Sam thinks it’s time to start pies.” Castiel spoke calmly, completely unaware of Dean’s predicament, his voice curling around and through Dean as Dean lay perfectly still on his back, his spent cock in his hand, aftershocks of pleasure making him tremble.
“With a
“I didn’t quite understand what you were asking here, Novak is it?” he started without preamble, “ - or to be more accurate I don’t quite understand
Dean’s shocked little gasp interrupted the thought, and Castiel’s face fell at the look on Dean’s face.
“Well, let’s go see what Sam left us, shall we?”
“Thanks,” he mumbled quietly, without looking up. “I feel a lot better than after the last…” he trailed off, his mind clearly somewhere else now.
This was
“I insist. Please, or I’ll worry.”
“When it was really bad,” Castiel said simply, “I took the pills.”
“No way, man, we need this!”  Dean was emphatic, serious. Castiel did not ask who “we” meant, but his curiosity ratcheted up a notch as Dean continued.
Dean’s eyes immediately sought Castiel’s, his brow furrowed, but Castiel was painstakingly stirring, his attention completely absorbed in watching the last of the cheese melt into the roux. Dean studied the side of Castiel’s face, observed the hint of a crease at the corner of his eye, watched the corner of his lip quirk just the tiniest bit then return to the straight line it was currently forming, and Dean’s eyes narrowed.
“ - Is the fountain water the same water as the pond? - “
Dean smiled soothingly across the kitchen at his new friend. “That’s Okay Cas, I’ve never used one before anyway. We always used an empty forty ouncer, I just asked cuz you’re classy and shit.” Castiel snorted, staring down at the roux he was currently whisking without a whisk and making sure he was stirring all parts of the pan. “I don’t suppose you drink forties?” Dean asked hopefully, and Castiel snorted again, looking up at Dean this time.
Dean’s mouth fell open as Castiel continued, desperately filling the silence, “I awoke with a pounding headache and without my customary morning tumescence for the first time in many years so I suppose I projected a similar state onto you.
“Are you alright, Cas?” Dean’s voice was… knowing, but Castiel didn’t blush this time, his pupils just darkened and he sighed into the receiver, sitting on the bottom step of his stairs in his bathrobe and leaning back to cradle the receiver beside his head as he carefully didn’t touch anything with his still slick right hand.
“I didn’t realize you could feel intent.”
“I - uh, I don’t want us to talk about it with anyone
“Pull your pants up, Dean. I want to watch you eat your pie, and then I want to hold you.”
“Yeah?”
His eyes fluttered open to find Castiel staring at him instead of the screen, and he pretended the frisson of arousal tickling low in his gut was for the blonde getting railed on TV, and had nothing to do with the weight of Castiel’s glance, following his hands with interest as he pulled his tee shirt over his head and dropped it on the bed, subtly checking his pits on the way by.
There was nothing for it, and Dean crawled across the bed as gracefully as he could to get on his knees beside Castiel, flushing absolutely furiously as he gingerly lifted a knee over Cas to straddle him, coming to rest with the searing heat of Cas's dick nestling against his taint. Dean's stomach twisted with nerves again, his balance a little tenuous with his knees sinking into the mattress tilting him into Castiel's chest, but he wasn't sure where he was allowed to put his hands, and he met Castiel's eyes hesitantly to check.
Whatever Castiel was searching for in Dean’s face, he apparently found it, because he nodded, satisfied, and returned his attention to the road. The winding traffic hydra chose that moment to extend a neck and they were moving again, part of the unpredictable creature winding its way through the streets of San José.
The timer chose that moment to go off, the noodles swollen now to very nearly the top of the water. Dean’s guess had been exactly correct, Castiel noted, any more and the pot would have overflowed.
Dean didn’t have to say a word. Castiel had spent his entire adult life being aroused by arms and backs and thighs and stomachs. He knew
Once Castiel decided on a gift, he was at a loss as to how to surprise the boys in the remaining days before Christmas without tipping his hand. He agonized over it for days until he was saved by a text from Dean.
“Well,” he offered, smiling now, “You’re already apparently saving my life from my non-existent car maintenance skills...”
“Shit, how are you so smart, Cas?”
in the driver’s seat right now. “
“In any case, I have no money for other food, Dean. I spent my paycheck this week on a bag for sleeping, and hygiene products, and I am saving what was left over for more clothes. Clothes get so much dirtier than I expected I think having more of them would save money on the laundromat, since several days’ worth could be washed at once. And then I wouldn’t have to wear them damp sometimes, either.”
did, an’ now I’ll have nightmares, if I can sleep at all.”
Castiel didn’t answer this time, either, he just stared straight ahead out the windshield, his face mournful, and Dean gave up. He shifted Baby into drive, and pulled away from the curb, in the opposite direction of the Gas ‘n Sip, waiting to see if Cas would say anything.
He wasn’t sure if he was oversharing until the answer came in. He read it and smiled softly to himself before turning back to his keyboard to fight code.
And then he’d have done everything in his power to make it happen again. And again.
Dean nodded yes, shrugging helplessly.
“Yeah. Will you touch yourself for me right now, the way you did the last time we -”
Dean looked so disappointed that Castiel relented, reaching behind a potted orchid to pull out a small plastic can of fish food and hand it to Dean. “Just a tiny pinch,” he instructed, looking fondly at the three little faces now excitedly sucking air at the surface of the water. “They’ll eat as much as you give them and as soon as they get too big I have to trade them in for little ones again.” Castiel’s voice softened as he murmured “I hate to see them go.” Castiel watched Dean sprinkle a tiny pinch of food on the surface of the water, watched Dean’s face light up to see the fish gobble at the largesse. He smiled wistfully, gazing at the three little faces, and spoke so quietly Dean wasn’t even sure he was meant to hear it.  “I still miss Henry David. He was
fish!  Dean sat down on the small stone bench and leaned back against the warm stone back - the thing must weigh a
Castiel beamed, his fingers still petting even though Dean was awake now.
“So, you figure Cas and Anna ever dated?” Dean asked, pretending at casual.
“Welcome to the club,” Dean smirked, his smile dazzling in the late afternoon sunbeams glancing through the picture window.  “We meet on Fridays. At your place.”
Dean felt the weight of Castiel looking at him the moment the familiar pleasure he could not name curled in his chest, but he was very distracted by the gorgeous girl making eyes at him and leaning her buxom chest into his chest. She felt warm against his side and she smelled really good and he hadn’t been with anyone in months. It was difficult to get a lot of alone time living in one room with his brother. He felt Castiel look away, and by the time he looked up, Castiel was staring at his table, scowling a little.  He briefly wondered if Cas was okay but was distracted again when the girl - what was her name, she had said it - Alison? Alice? He knew it started with an A - shit, she was leaning into him, she was pressing her barely dressed body against him, hollering up at him did he want to get out of here - go back to her place - yes, yes he did want that very badly and Sammy could damn well wait an extra hour. She was dragging him by the hand when he felt the weight of Cas looking at him again and he turned to share a victory grin, but although Cas was watching him, he didn’t offer that approving smile Dean craved at this particular victory. Castiel had a weird look on his face that Dean couldn’t place and then Cas looked away abruptly, which stung a bit but Allie? Alesha? was dragging him away and he turned to follow the gorgeous girl out to the parking lot, shepherd her under his arm toward his car, open the door for her like a gentleman, preen at her squeal of delight at his Baby, ask her “Where to?,” and then he was well and truly - and *very* pleasantly - distracted for several hours after that.
Dean showered until his hands were prunes, shampooing his hair for twenty minutes solid, finally insisting that Castiel join him and wash his hair too, but more importantly, look him over microscopically for spiders.
The timer went off again and this time Dean did pull the mac and cheese out, the bacon and crumb topping all golden brown and smelling delicious in the takeout-trays-and-aluminum-foil casserole dish Dean had fashioned since Castiel did not own one and the pie was currently occupying his only cookie sheet. Sam appeared as if by magic as Castiel cleared their laptops from the table, and Dean gingerly carried his creation to the table to set it on the trivets Castiel somehow owned and carefully laid out side by side in the center of the table. The man’s kitchen implement selection was so random as to be a complete mystery to Dean.
“Har har,” Dean cut in, before Sam could ask for more details. “I doubt Jimi Hendrix meant basketball. Go shower Cas, the sweat in my ass crack is starting to dry up and itch.”
"Thanks, Cas."
Castiel hadn’t been fucking his face
Castiel waved at Garth and Jesse, there was no way they could hear him on the other side of the table. They waved back, Garth shrugging his shoulders and grinning. Castiel turned to find Dean in the crowd, scanning the pool table area but there was no room to play pool, no room for cues to maneuver in the crowd, no room for Dean to bend over the table lining up a shot, no room for Dean to preen under Castiel’s admiration of his skill at the game. When Castiel had started watching and Dean had... seemed to like it, Castiel had had to be very careful not to stare at Dean’s body. Now, he realized, his appreciation for Dean was for his friend, the man Dean was, and while Dean was somehow even more beautiful to him than before, it was easy for him to keep his eyes on Dean’s pool game and on his face, no longer a struggle not to admire his arms or chest or back. He just… didn’t want to anymore.
“I have learned certain techniques for dealing with anxiety from a counselor.”
“I’m kidding, Cas,” he soothed. “But it’s different with a client.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck with one hand, sheepish. “I guess I like, turn on the charm more.”
This time Castiel did not apologize for his tone. “We have to have the meeting, that’s
Dean’s breathing sounded strained, and he groaned in frustration as Castiel stopped speaking.
, what are you saying ‘yes’ to, Dean?”
Dean couldn’t drop it, chewing on his lip and frowning his way through months’ worth of recollections and finally protesting  “But… but I’ve never seen Cas so much as glance at any guys at the bar or anywhere, I mean I’m always looking at the girls and Cas never looks at dudes!”
“I do have a theory,” Anna nodded, “but I am gathering more data points for my hypothesis.” Castiel knew that look, she would say no more about it until she was ready. He didn’t even try to press her, just sighed and nodded. “Okay. Thank you.”
to have Dean’s arms around him again.
“I know you do,” Castiel sighed, his brow still menacing, but the thunderstorm averted, at least for now. “I’ve seen your wiles in action.”
“Can I do yours?”
Dean nodded, and Castiel’s relief was palpable, his shoulders sagging and his breath huffing out. He ran his hands through his hair, his eyes wide. “
I will preface the next stretch only with the caveat that I am not in charge of what happens when I put these two in a room. I try to be, I had a nice long argument with Cas - don't you want to be easily categorized? Don't you know you won't tag well like this? - but he wants what he wants. I wrote an entire agonized essay to my poor Beta about how we set patterns early and maybe some things don't reset and she said, approximately, "Calm down, just let me take a look... GOOD GOD GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS CAITLIN."
you looked my way I needed you so bad it hurt.”
Dean’s voice came out sharper than he meant it to, and he instantly regretted snapping as Castiel’s hand left his face and he stepped back, a foot of cold air between them where there had been a wall of heat before.
Sam looked at Castiel but Castiel was watching Dean, a soft smile on his lips.
“You know we’re not in Vegas, right, Cas?”
Dean shook his head no, both to Castiel’s conjecture and at their surprisingly attractive waitress, silently lifting an eyebrow to ask if they needed another round. Dean’s eyebrows answered that his friend had already had plenty, and the girl grinned and winked and spun away on her heel, Dean trying his damndest not to watch her go.
Why is it
of it, his eyelids fluttering open just in time to see Castiel’s lips and tongue close around his nipple, the sound that escaped him surprising them both but Castiel didn’t lose a beat, still steadily pulling him down, teeth joining his tongue in worrying Dean’s flesh, and then Castiel’s cock hit home.
Castiel was clearly picturing it, Dean's entire body somehow fluttering now, as Castiel nodded, turning to reach for the chair.
Castiel checked the timestamp. The message was from after nine o’ clock.
Castiel stepped out of the bathroom still drying himself with a towel, his face tired and unhappy. He did not look relaxed at all, and Dean couldn’t stop his eyes from flicking down and then back up, Castiel’s predicament clearly still in full effect.
stellar hosting, Cas,” he murmured, “and even though you
