Of course, I hope you guys like it and understand it, but college is stressful enough that I don't have to stress about what I do with my spare time.
“You okay, Charlie? Stevie is back with you, right?”

Hi everybody!
Dean stared a little dumbstruck before doing what he was told. Together they look at every cabinet in just a few minutes. They found everything that could be useful to them like first aid stuff and some drugs Castiel said that they could use against different creatures.
“I’m sorry, but aren’t you the nurse around here?” Dean asked.
“And what exactly are you trying to do?”
Dean still feels like he’s dreaming when he’s seeing all these people sitting at his table. He gave everyone a beer before sitting.
A loud crack echoes through the mansion, almost like a gunshot, and Five topples off the couch.
As always, reviews are appreciated greatly!
“This is Y/N Y/L/N, yes,” you answer. “Who is—Sam?”
Peacekeepers rotate out about every five hours. Whoever’s in charge stations the great majority of them in close proximity to the fence, and for a good reason too—in the past three years, eight people have tried to escape the district. The Peacekeepers whipped them for their temerariousness. Each Peacekeeper has a partner, and they stand about 500 feet away from the nearest Peacekeeper pair. Although a few patrol the streets for violence and crime, not many do. Dean’s sure that there are more Peacekeepers that do that in the poorer parts of District 5, which probably has a lot more crime because they’re not supplied enough food.
“The District 9 boy tribute.” Dean leans against the sink and rolls his shoulders. “Everyone knows he’s going to win. Have you seen him? He’s the size of a truck.”
“Hello!” Jack beams at his three dads and then at the six people trickling into the room. “It’s nice to meet you!”
There are lines underneath his eyes, too, like his lower lids are sagging with exhaustion. Dean’s so tired… he could fall asleep standing in front of this mirror…
“I’m going to protect you,” Jo says fiercely. “I know you think you’re going to protect me. But I’m going to protect you too. You’re going to come back to Sam. I swear it.”
Sam shrugs. “I don’t know why Jo trusted him, but yeah. Dean says she’ll give it back in three days if he hasn’t found it yet, but he’s determined to find it before then. I guess he’s been too tired from working all night that he hasn’t been able to call you. He’s fine, though.”
“I’m sorry,
Hey everyone! I hope you all enjoy this chapter. Let me know what you think by dropping a comment down below!
TW: Mentions of abuse, 'suicide' (sort of)
“I could just cut him,” Diego wheedles. “Just to see if it makes a cut and then it heals or if nothing happens. Come on. We don’t know how angels work.”
And there is the million-dollar question. “I don’t know.” And that’s the truth. Most of the guards didn’t take their helmets off, and besides, Dean was
“Dean,
He and Rowena watch as Sam tries frantically to stop Five from cutting Jack’s arm, even as Jack holds his arm out and holds him in place.
The train eases to a stop and Peacekeepers flank Dean and Jo as they exit the train. There are about ten people waiting for them just at the entrance of a building. For a moment Dean thinks that they can’t actually be real people, just looking at
“I think visiting my boyfriend while he’s working because I haven’t seen him lately is very romantic,” Cas replies seriously.
He reaches into the tree’s hollow trunk and takes out three woven baskets. The insides are stained red and blue from juice. Dean pokes the bottom of the most stained and it’s soft to the touch. With a sigh, he tosses it aside. “Well, that’s done for.”
“My full name is Castiel, Sam. It is not Casanova.”
“Gross!” Everyone else complains (except Cas), but it gets Sam and Dean to stop.
Reviews are always appreciated, as are kudos.
know?” the voice snaps back. It’s the voice of a
Dean puzzles over that for five seconds before remembering that adoption is a thing. The jump to another reality must have scrambled his brains again.
“There are no—”
“And why did you want that to happen?” Sam asks while lifting the cat out of the shelf. He is very aware that you are standing right next to him and don’t even come up to his shoulders. Your smile when he hands your cat to you makes his stomach flip.
“Lucifer?” Luther repeats. “Uh…”
Please review—they always make my day.
“Some people we know better than others,” Cas responds, which isn’t really an answer to the question you asked, but you’ll let it slide. Cas is like that. “We help people. And people get into trouble a lot.”
The first sign that something is wrong is the eerie silence. Nobody’s out on the streets, though Dean sees that the package he’d left on a doorstep is gone. Not even Peacekeepers are on the streets. Trepidation makes his stomach curdle.
Dean can’t argue with that. It’s fun to watch until you remember it’s real-life people dying on the screen.
Not that he’ll live long enough for Sam to ever tease him if he does wear an indecent outfit, or even go butt-naked. It’s Dean’s last hurrah, so to speak, but he refuses to go out without some semblance of pride.
Sam can’t help but feel a small bit of jealousy at how easily you talk and joke with Gabe but can’t even look at Sam.
“Chuck’s on vacation right now.”
“What? Yeah, totally.” Dean sits up and untangles the blanket from his legs. “Just startled after falling, is all.”
Dean hangs up without a good-bye.
“Yes,” Sam replies resolutely. It must surprise him.
Thank you to everyone that commented—I had fun reading them all even if I didn't respond to them (though I did try to respond to them all). Anyways, hope you enjoy this chapter, as always, please leave a comment!
“Sorry, Sam!” someone else yells and Sam shoots upright. He’s never heard you shout before.
“That’s right.” Dean dips his head and his pace doesn’t falter as he strolls behind the tree, but once he’s hidden from sight a significant amount of tension eases from his limbs.
“I hope so,” she finally mutters. “God, I hope so.”
Y'all, I have started my job and work around 32 hours a WEEK. My feet hurt so much. Also, school has started and I'm already behind in all my classes so that's fun. Please review; you're the only thing keeping me going.
. His account of anything shouldn’t be reliable apart from the very hard facts like Azazel, Mary, and the white room.
“Don’t interrupt me, boy,” Bobby growls and Dean rolls his eyes. Sam shoves him with his shoulder and Dean retaliates.
The ghosts have faded, especially with Sam here, but they’re not quite silenced. This is the closest place Dean has to their memories. Something slithers to his right and for a moment it sounds exactly like a knife soaring through the air, thrown by Wendy and coming straight for Dean’s back. Maybe that bark of a fox is a quiet gunshot, the bullet ripping into Vam Pyre. Or maybe it’s coming from the hellhound that tore Bela Talbot to pieces.
Sam sits immediately, but Dean makes a production out of it as usual, as he always does. “It wasn’t even us who did the whole bread thing, that was Gabe the Crime Scene Investigator next door!”
Sam cringes when Dean sighs, loudly, as they wait for their supervisor to call them into his office. What had started out as a little prank war had somehow evolved into a station-wide fight that somehow also included the police in the building over, dogs, shaving cream, and an entire bathroom filled with bread.
Vanya clears her throat. “Five, apologize for shooting Castiel or I’m taking your gun.”
“I hate you,” you say out loud, though it’s unclear if you’re talking to your cat or the trickster. As it is, the cat soothes its ruffled fur and squeaks at you. It has really big eyes.
It takes almost three hours until Dean’s prep team deems him suitable to be presented to his stylist. Those three hours were, to put it lightly, torture. They’d cut Dean’s hair, shaved his face roughly, and pulled hair out of places he hadn’t even known it was growing in (seriously, though, who cares if he’s got hair in his nose?). The one things they hadn’t touched were the bruises on his wrists and his amulet, but Dean’s face still gets hotter every time he feels someone’s eyes on the imprints. And he’d thrown a right bitch fit in order to keep that amulet on, but he’s
“Hardly. This will not be a business trip.”
Sam doesn’t respond.
Hey guys! Happy early Christmas for those who celebrate. If you don't, happy holiday season! I would say I hope receiving this chapter cheers you up but I don't think it will :). Anyways, I am happy to report that I have been working on some of the later chapters for this story and am coming out of an awful writer's block, so that's fun! Also, my work is shutting down for two months for the season so I would have more free time except my swim and lacrosse seasons are starting up. So we'll see how much writing I actually get done. Anyways, hope you enjoy and comment! Tell me how you're (safely) celebrating the holidays or what you'd like to see for the ending/climax of the story. I just really want to hear from y'all.
Something hurtles through the air and buries itself into Cas’s chest. A knife. Fuck. Will that hurt him, even though he’s an angel, but he doesn’t have any powers here, but does that just apply to grace and wings or—
With a sigh, Dean throws up his hands. “Whatever.” He checks the time. “They’ll be switching out soon, anyway.”
“We should sneak out—”
Dean grips the fake section of metal and pulls quickly. He steps through the fence, trying not to get stuck on any metal parts. He’s gotten too big for the hole, however, and one piece snags his jacket’s right sleeve. That could be a problem if this section ever turns on.
“You will!”
Do you guys think Cas is coming back? Personally I believe he will just because. And also because we have to have a happy ending. Also, didn't someone say Misha hasn't been in all the episodes he was supposed to be? Plus, because a gay man wrote that episode, he wouldn't do the kill your gays trope to us, right? But you all have to understand my excitement during that scene. I mean, you're all reading a physical manifestation of my love for this ship. I've shipped these boys for literal years and honestly thought there was no chance they would be canon, but they are!!! I hope you all are as happy about this as I am!
“You’re not going to get reaped again.”
“I am not
Dean blinks. Is Sam trying to counsel him? Make him feel better? That’s not Sam’s job. He doesn’t need to do that. “I appreciate that, Sam, but I’m really fine.” When his brother doesn’t look convinced, Dean insists, “I really am fine, Sam. You’re the one I’m worried about; Dad leaving all the time, me never being here… You know I’d do anything to stay, right? You know I don’t
“Castiel? You’re here?” Dean whispered in the room, trying to be discreet.
There was a young girl in a white gown behind a desk looking like she was bored. Or maybe it was just her resting face because she couldn’t look older than Dean and young 20-something often look like they were bored out of there mind. She was blond with bright blue eyes which were currently looking at Dean up and done while judging him.
“And I love you, Dean.”
Dean was sleeping like a baby dreaming of his younger brother. There were together in Baby, driving toward the horizon. There were talking about everything that popped into their heads. Sam was talking about California wildlife when he removed a flute from his backpack. The younger man started to play like some kind of prodigy while Dean was watching his brother with a confused expression “Dude, what the-”
Dean tried to ask Sam if he tried to contact Eileen but apparently, they just talk through texts. They didn’t try to see each other since the world almost end and Jack brought her back with all the other people Chuck Thanos-snapped.  Dean didn’t ask further questions.
“Dean? Are you here?”
“Hum, yeah. There was something behind the door.” If the weird drawing counted as a sigil.
“What do you propose then?”
When he was in the middle of the room he almost fell when he got access back to his extremities.
Castiel stood tall and Dean could see that he was slightly smaller than him. But the guy was so intimidating with his huge wings, it felt like he was a giant.
If you're still following this story, thank you so much!
Dean is in front of his computer looking for info about the Empty when he hears his brother coming back with the little click-clack of Miracle’s paws. Deans know that Castiel wouldn’t want him to try a rescue mission, but Dean can not just continue his life without trying to get him back. How could he go live his own life after what Cas told him? At least Dean needs to know if Cas can hear the prayers is doing every night so far. For now, it’s just mundane things about what happened in the day, like Dean was just praying his diary to him. Dean wishes he could tell him the four-letter word but what the point if they can’t at least hug. And if Cas can indeed hear everything he said, that would just hurt him so much.
“Yes, that is true.” The angel seemed to think about that for a minute. “Maybe you can try to make a harness?”
The two guards were two young girls, probably not older than Dean. One had beautiful blond long hair with big clear eyes and the second had pretty brown hair. They seem inoffensive enough. They didn’t have yellow eyes, long teeth, weird sulfur smell and nothing like a weird number of eyes. They seemed human enough so maybe they’re were human victims of the weird psycho just like him.
Against the wall opposite Dean, there was what looked like a workstation with several computers. The hunter tried to take a look at the screen but from his point of view, he could see what looked like a stupid Facebook game and a live stream of the camera in the cells. The quality of the image was an awful pixelated black and white thing. Honestly, Dean just guess it was the security camera because the layout just looked like it came from a spy movie. From this far, it was almost impossible for him to detect a human shape on those screens.
Now that the spell was on, he took a few moments to observe the beauty of the young man face. His skin was tan, and his cheeks and nose were cover by an infinity of freckles. The collector moved his hand from the forehead of the boy to stroke his sandy blond hair. The boy’s eyes were still closed, but he heard from his staff who tranquilized him, that they were a lovely shade of green. He was impatient to see them.
Dean slowly came out of hiding and advanced in the room. He passed behind the folding screen. Wasn’t that screen black two seconds ago? The first thing he noticed was that the room looked arranged just like his.
He left is bed to start his search of an exit way he could have missed in his state of grogginess yesterday. He was also hungry so why not to go looking for that promised breakfast.
ridiculous they look. Even though government officials wear odd, professional clothes, they’re nothing compared to the insects.
Luther opens his mouth to further ask about that statement but his younger/older sibling interrupts him. “No, no, I want to hear more about coming back to life,” Five insists, draping himself over a chair.
“Hey yourself,” Dean replies to their almost-sister. “You and Mo—Ellen still arguing, then?”
Dean tears his eyes away from Jo and looks to the crowd, where a hush has fallen over the crowds. He’s not sure if it’s a good thing, but his adrenaline is rushing too hard, heart beating too fast and blood rushing in his ears, that he simply doesn’t care.
Cas points at Dean. “You shouldn’t be too worried. Sam and Dean have died multiple times. One time Sam even killed him. They turned out fine.”
“Hello,” Dean grunts. He can’t afford to piss off his stylist; the Games are hardly a beauty pageant, but more attractive victors always seem to get more sponsors. Dean can’t afford to be a walking fashion catastrophe, not when getting back to Sam is on the line.
Allison giggles. “Like you can build up an immunity to stab wounds.”
Basically, this was a maze. A massive underground maze. And now Sam, Dean, and Cas are in the middle of it.
“Son of a
Dean really didn’t mean to eavesdrop. He’s two steps up when he hears Castiel’s voice and realizes he’d gone inside and not come back out. Curious now, he follows the voices down a staircase and flattens himself against the wall near the doorway of what must be the kitchen, judging by the smell of food inside the room.
have any experience with that sort of stuff?”
Klaus says out of the blue, “No, I will not!” He flushes when everyone turns to look at him. “Ben told me to tell Diego to throw a knife at Jack since it won’t hurt him either.”
ALSO, VERY IMPORTANT: THERE WILL BE NO NEW UPDATES UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2020. I AM GOING ON VACATION AND WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET DURING THE HOLIDAYS. Regardless, I hope everyone enjoys their holidays. I will see you all again in the new year!
Cas nods. “Yes. She was on her break. She says she’s moving soon.”
Dean’s face gets even hotter. He’s not a big fan of the ‘L’ word.
“I read Harry Potter,” Cas says, swinging his and Dean’s entwined hands like a pendulum. “I think Dean is a Gryffindor. Sam is a Ravenclaw. I think I am a Hufflepuff. Maybe—”
“We have Christianity,” Allison says, a little defensively.
Something lights on fire and a section of the Peacekeepers scatter. The screaming, though tinny, is still loud and sets Dean’s teeth on edge. “They must be unhappy their tributes died.”
“Uh…” Dean knows he has to get back to his universe. He has a responsibility to save the world, of course. But it was enjoyable to hear about other people’s crazy lives and be able to relax. He settles for gesturing for her to follow and he leads her out to the courtyard.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam nods and escorts you out of the apartment. In the doorway, you hesitate.
“Hey!” Sam says suddenly, making Dean wince. He points at the TV screen. “Look. He’s hunting that rat.”
First a trail of bodies with different organs cut out starting in, what a coincidence, the same town Sam and Dean were hunting a ghost in. But the mutilated people hadn’t stopped showing up in the hospital, even though they’d
Sheepishly, Jack lets Sam go and shrugs at Five. “Is it time for us to go already, Miss Rowena?”
I hope everyone had an awesome holiday break! I am back on the horse now, and we are in the home stretch!
The cameras weren’t lying about the Capitol’s grandeur. The spires of the shining city are gleaming white marble. Everywhere you look is polished white, which makes the people look even more striking, which Dean is sure was their goal. They stroll around with their bright colors, so different from the dull ones in the districts. Here people look like glittering insects. In the districts people could blend into the ground or the forest what with how stick-thin and dirty they all are. Even the mayors, even the Peacekeepers.
“You wish,” he replies. “See ya, Sammy!”
“Besides,” Sam continues, “it’s what Dad’s preparing us for.”
“I’m not talking about that.” Sam removes his hands from his stomach and looks away, biting his lip.
Everything is becoming more complicated by the second.
“Sammy!” Dean barks when he sees his brother on the opposite side of the room. He doesn’t look injured, but still—“Are you okay?”
It’s Jack, stumbling out of the portal. How he’d known to go inside the shed, find the middle of the maze, and jump through the portal, Dean doesn’t know.
A series of knocks sound at the door. When Sam opens up, you’re standing there in your scrubs and carrying a bag with your phone to your ear.
“Hello, boys.”
Five snorts. “So? I’ve got more.”
A fluffy orange monster jumps onto his bed and right off it before bolting over to the small kitchen. Sam can only watch with an open mouth as it jumps onto the counter and into an empty shelf, conveniently just above how far you and Gabe can reach.
But he can’t do that because Bobby stopped all his alcohol shipments. There’s nothing in John’s house because he’s literally never here anymore. Wherever he hangs out now is where he must stash his booze.
“Hannah is my sister. She told me about you.”
“Well, we can do that without having a superpower,” Dean brags, all in good nature of course, and the competition is on.
“One of them might be rich,” Jo shrugs. “We need to suck up to them, don’t we?”
“Yo, Winchester!” Diego yells, waving as both Winchesters whip their heads around. “Target practice!”
“Don’t even try it,” Sam growls. Dean knows that he’s got his gun pointed at whoever’s pointing one at him.
Dean frowns.
There is some explicit language in this chapter.
“I don’t care whose idea it was,” he grunts. “I just cornered you to make sure you’ll save some fruit for me.” He steps out of the shadows and looks a lot less menacing. With an open hand, he offers them coins. “Us Peacekeepers have missed our fruit boys.”
Cas takes his hand, a mysterious half-smile playing on his lips. “Of course.”
The Peacekeepers get the person on the far right side of the building and they fall to the ground. The sound of bones snapping is lost amid the chaos, but Dean can see in the bottom of the screen that their body looks like a ragdoll. The rebelling citizens have started to throw flaming rocks at the Peacekeepers, who look like they’re going to buckle under the pressure.
“How’d you know we were coming?”
The prep teams whisk the tributes down to the bottom level of the Remake Center, where their chariot pulled by four completely white horses awaits. The animals don’t skitter when the chatty prep team floods into the room with them. It’s impressive; Dean’s seen tame animals more skittish than these horses.
“Well, Luci told Cas that he didn’t want to deal with the little demon tonight so Cas brought him to me since him and Dean are going on a ‘date’ in the vending machine room of the fire station.” Sam rolls his eyes.
Bobby pushes them out of his office and leaves them to wrestle on the ground, much to the amusement of the passing Jo and Gordon, who’d just got back from
Okay, I know this is late. And I got reviews reminding me to update. And I am sorry, but I have no excuses. Just know I did this all to annoy Lansfics7 :))). Just kidding, she was the one who reminded me to update (because she is my alarm system for this story) at 11:00 PM on monday!!! I was in bed. I was asleep! And then I was too lazy. I apologize. Anyways, I hope you all enjoy this chapter and review, because they remind me to update and keep me writing :)). I hope this chapter cheers you all up because Chuck knows the world is a little fucked.
John had once told Dean.
was the one who did the first prank,” Dean interrupts.
“Yeah,” Luther agrees, sending an uneasy look in Jack’s direction when the boy snaps his fingers and his glass of chocolate milk fills itself. “So Sam dies, and Dean sells his soul to bring him back. Then Dean dies and goes to hell, Cas saves him, and you’ve been saving the world ever since?”
“You know what we use the water for?” Charlie grins, tilting her head. “Power. You’re not afraid of a little electricity, are you, Dean?”
As the trio strolls downtown, nearly everyone says hi to them. It’s that sort of town where everyone knows everyone, and everyone especially knows them.
Dean groans with frustration at the sight of a red hem turning the corner of the labyrinth he’s currently trapped in with his brother and Cas, with no way to call their backup, Jack, for help, because there’s no service in this goddamn maze.
That would make Dean’s life so much easier.
Unfortunately, nobody is listening to his prayer. Sam snaps at Dean at the same time the banner unfolds with a snap. Though the right side sags a bit, the message on the fabric is unmistakable. The rebels had painted a sword on fire on a large swath of grey cloth.
‘Detective’ Cas,” Sam adds. “Dean just doesn’t want to get his boyfriend in trouble. And guess how they got in in the first place?” He tilts his head to Dean and looks at Bobby, who rolls his eyes, but he can’t help but chuckle when Sam sticks his tongue in his cheek.
“Did you get it?” he asks gruffly.
“Look at this!” Dean crows. “He can run into fires with no fear, but the second I even
“Hello!” someone calls out. “Is anybody home?”
. He was allowed undergarments that won’t crease under the fabric but will prevent him from being completely exposed. Unfortunately, that meant he wasn’t able to wear the amulet. Charlie isn’t as easily bendable as Dean’s prep team and so Bobby promised to hold onto the necklace and slipped it into his pocket. Dean still isn’t sure if he should be worried about the old Victor’s wording.
Okay, so technically I still posted on the right day.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s lip curls. There are no Peacekeepers here. No Peacekeepers to whip people caught stealing food they need to survive. No Peacekeepers to trade people for goods they so desperately need. No Peacekeepers to catch an innocent Victor while she’s showing her sons the hydroelectric dam—
“Nothing important.” Dean grunts as he flops down on the couch. “I don’t think the program will be very interesting for the rest of the day, Sammy. We already got that chase and both District 11 tributes died, so they’re probably not going to force another confrontation until at least tomorrow afternoon.”
Hey so this chapter has a trigger warning so if you get upset by this stuff please do not read, I don't want to be responsible for someone getting hurt
“Whatever.”
“A woman of high standard will come to your room tomorrow night. If you do not behave according to my expectations there will be… consequences.”
to leave, right?”
“So, um, Fluffy?”
“Are you okay, though?”
Hey guys! Listen, I know this is one week late and I am really sorry. As I'm sure some if not most of you know, ao3 went down last Monday so I was unable to post. After that my week got crazy busy and I got distracted. I wish I had a better excuse, but... Anyways, we're going to recalibrate the updating schedule a little bit; this is my update for this week and in two weeks there will be another chapter. I know this sets back chapters by a week, but I hope you all understand. For all the hardcore Destiel shippers out there, this chapter might make it up to you.
Gabriel!”
“We have a profound bond,” Cas replies simply. That’s always been enough for their relationship.
“Not telling.”
“And there’s another apocalypse,” Vanya says slowly. “And you’re stopping it by coming to our universe.”
Dean glances into the mirror and sees that his neck and ears are turning red. He does feel warm. Is he coming down with a fever? “Uh, yeah, I guess,” he says shortly. “To pay you back for you cooking me breakfast that one time.”
“Um, hi,” you say. Sam hears it through the phone too.
Everyone is going to die. Naomi wanted people to see that to give them hope and tear it away. To crush people’s spirits.
?” Five blurts out, staring at the grown men with new respect.
“Are you sure you don’t want to go to the park?”
Dean looks at Sam as the witch starts to chant, and he shrugs. He’s always had a soft spot for the witch, but Dean doesn’t know why. He takes small solace in the fact that Sam’s here, and if worst comes to worst he’ll be the one to end the witch once and for all. Somehow.
taken care of the ghost. Then there was a girl who’d had one of her eyes scooped out, claiming to only remember seeing the color red before she’d passed out again from the pain. The color red, and a weird shed in the woods behind the high school with strange markings on the door.
District 1’s chariot goes first, obviously. Their white horses have been spray-painted gold and draped with glittering tunics that make them blend right in with the Capitol. Out of all the districts, District 1 is the closest one to the Capitol. They’re a fan favorite, which is obvious by the deafening cheer that greets this year’s tributes.
“Really?” an unfamiliar voice snarls behind Dean. “What’s that light?”
He’d started this. Sam is going to be punished.
Dean nearly jumps out of his skin. The Peacekeeper in front of him still wears his mask, but Dean can recognize that voice easily.
“Look, I just think it’s a good series!” Sam exclaims. “And that’s nothing compared to the cowboy hats I found hidden underneath your bed, Dean. You can’t really talk.”
“Stay still” Castiel's tone of voice didn’t give him any choice.
Thanks a lot to the persons who commenting while I wasn't there, you give me so much motivation back to continue this story! <3
“I miss you, Cas. I’m sorry that I wasn’t capable of responding to you that day, and that I wasn’t able to say what I’m about to say sooner” Dean knows that he’s taking his time, but he needs to think about what he’s talking.
Hi everyone !
Well at least he still had the same clothes, and he didn’t have felt any new injury.
I hope to not let you wait so much before the next update but i don't know how irl life will impact my writing time in the next weeks. I'll try to write more but if you want a sign of life from me you can find me on twitter @Mikey-Ran !
His feet stopped him in the middle of the room while the door slowly closed behind him.
“Oh My God!” So much for Dean trying to stay discrete.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed even more even if he didn't understand the innuendo. Those eyes were almost closed, how could this guy still see him?
Hope that you like this chapter, leave a comment or a kudos!
“Sinclair is a powerful warlock that uses his power to enslave all sorts of creatures. Some of them here are killers and use violence like it’s a form of art. It’s not the place for a human and you can’t hope to get out of here alive on your own. What you can see here he just the tribune he keeps for the public, but he does his business in the back where it’s all chaos and destruction. I don’t have the time to explain everything right now, but you need to trust me when I tell you that you need me. We will need to traverse that zone to leave this estate.”
“Well, when you take your time thinking about that, I’m going to find that restroom button.” With that, Dean walked to the other side of his room where the weird fake toilet was. He pressed the button hoping that, like he’s been told, it would let him go to the bathroom.
“Told you!”
Dean’s dream was abruptly cut by one of the worst wake up call he had since his father left. Still sleeping, his feet just projected him out of the bed.
“DEAN!!” Said man is assaulted by an excited, crying, and violent red hair cannonball. She’s squeezing him so much he feels like he can’t breathe anymore. This feels so weird, this Charlie never was emotional like that. But still, Dean hugs her back and she starts sobbing in his arms.
Dean looked at his new friend with a huge proud smile and step in the hallway. He was sure that the guy was following him but at mid-way, he looked for the guy without seeing him at his side. He turned over and saw that he was still standing in the doorway with a glare aimed at Dean.
“She was a werewolf Dean. By saying there was a problem with them you just give her the perfect reason to leave us alone here. That was truly intelligent.”
Dean tried to look serious even if he felt like “impostor” was stamped in his forehead in big red letters. That feeling didn’t go away when Castiel stopped next to the white doors that Dean didn’t see because of the big black wings in front of his face.
“Sam, they’re something I needed to talk to you about.” Start Dean.
I know it's clearly not the best chapter by far, but it's something that needed to be done.
Castiel pushed Dean aside and took a few steps back to close the door a little to be able to talk to the young man. He started his quick monsterology lesson while whispering.
Right, technically Dean never responds to his love declaration. When he heard everything he was too busy trying to follow what was happening with the news of the deal with the Empty and Billie pounding at the door to come and kill him. Then he heard the confession and tried to understand what he was saying, processing the fact that apparently angels, and especially Castiel, could feel love and not just the brotherly love that existed more or less between the angels, but real love like Adam and Serafina.
“What did Charlie want?” Sam ask.
The door seems shut but Dean his stubborn, so he tried again to open it. Again, nothing happened.
Like he saw last night, there was a pavement just in front of him. On the other side of it he could see a big bronze statue in some weird alcove. On a pedestal, he could see something that look like an angel with the halo and the wings. The dude had a full medieval armor from the boots to the helmet. He was branding a sword to slay a small dragon climbing the pedestal. The statue was beautiful, everything made of bronze except for the sword. The light was just striking the sword, creating a beautiful contrast and made the weapon shining with a pure white color. The sword was highlighted by the color, clearly the important piece of the sculpture.
The collector slowly stood and made his exit from the room still watching the young man. It was time to tell his assistant to bring him in his new quarter.
“Yes. But I never have the chance to get far while I was on my own. But I may have the beginning of an idea.”
“What’s wrong? He's sleeping! Just go!” Dean was becoming quite impatient to move already! He was now whisper-yelling just in Castiel's ear because apparently, personal space wasn’t an issue when it was for moving this gargoyle of a man.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said hiding a yawn.
“We need to gather everything that could be useful and try to fit everything in the guard backpack. Take first aid supplies and everything that you think you could turn into a weapon.” Castiel said that without hesitation and started to open the different closets.
Hearing his Bobby said that, the man who partially raised him, made him cry a single man tear and he come to give him a hug to.
His feet started to move without his own accord. They dragged him towards the door and even if he was happy to move from that room, he hated that he couldn’t move freely and couldn’t defend himself.
He just needs to find a way to tell his brother that he completely retires from the hunter-on-the-road life. He doesn’t know how this conversation is going to end but hopefully, Sam will understand.
“What the heck just happened?”
Dean just shook his head at him and get back to work on the door.
“You should buy me dinner first…”
Before he knew it, Dean found himself in the middle of the room, facing the door without control of his limbs while a small flute music was heard escaping the loudspeaker in a corner.
Dean just blinked under the dissecting gazes. He wasn’t sure if he understood everything about what the guy just said. Right now, he couldn’t care less, he just wanted all those weird guys to stop staring at him! There even was a child around 5 who just jump against the glass to try to come to Dean, producing a big “bong” before he was reprimanded by his mother. The hunter didn’t though he will be happy about the existence of that wall before.
Please, note that this story isn't and never will be an A/B/O story, I just used it at the beginning of the chapter for characterization reason.
“Yeah, I figured that much, I mean what are you?”
Dean was just starring at the wings so Cas resume talking like everything was totally normal “Dean, I need you to unlock the padlock of the chain. We need to go before Sinclair understands our diversion.”
Dean stood up, approaching Cas so he could touch his face, just to assure himself that he wasn’t dreaming. Their eyes meet and Dean saw the tears in Castiel’s eyes. He wasn’t sure if they were sad or happy tears, but he had some stuff to say that hopefully will make them happy.
The young man's eyes were darting between Castiel's eyes and his back while his face lost all his color. Behind the guy, he could see an enormous set of completely dark wings. How did he miss them?!  There was the most beautiful and scariest thing he ever saw!
“Dean, you’re really tired, you should try to sleep.” His angel said like he was concern that Dean would just drop on the floor in exhaustion.
The brown hair girl caught the arm of her friend just as she was throwing herself at Dean revealing sharp teeth and blue snake-like eyes. The hunter instinctively tried to dodge out of the way but: unmoving feet. At least Sammy wasn’t there to see him faceplanting on the floor.
“I think that makes sense, but why I am here? Do those creatures never saw a regular guy before? And if the visitors are supernatural guys, don’t they care to see their peers on the other side of the glass?”
“Cas? I’m not sure if I understand exactly how that thing work but what you just say is just crazy! With a camera like that and the right knowledge, a hunter could know what his hunting way faster! That could change so many things for us! Why nobody thought about that before?” Dean was really interesting in that thing now.
Dean sure as hell was going to leave soon but so far, he was well treated. Right?
Castiel sound very serious and Dean didn’t have a choice anymore.
He closed the door with his key and left the ward with a happy loving smile. After all this time, he finally had the Michael sword in his collection!
“I’m so sad. But please just don’t yell preparing your plan, it’s annoying and I’m pretty sure it’s not a good way to make it work. Now shush, I’m trying to work.” How could he sound so annoyed in just one sentence, Dean would never know.
With that, she threw her stethoscope at Dean and bolted out of the room like her life depends on it. She left behind her a stunned Dean and a Castiel who look at the human like he was proud of him.
However, the young hunter knew that he probably got carried away when he started to write down the toilet paper or the toilet brush. Yeah, how he could turn that into a weapon? Dean had no idea.
“What?! The werewolves?”
“Something is blocking me.”
They open the door again and Castiel walk first in. The angel didn’t try to be discreet and just storm in there so Dean didn’t bother either. The angel arrived next to the snoring guard and stopped next to him, on the guard right.
When he couldn’t hear the voices anymore, he saved is page in order to continue to read later and slowly stood up. He walked carefully to the edge of the room to try to take a pick in the hallway, as if a sudden movement could cause Morgan le Fay’s army to come back.
The sigil he needed to do was some weird little circle with what appeared to be Enochian letters, according to Castiel the language of angels. Dean never heard of what was Enochian before, but his neighbor was so sure of himself that Dean trusted him, and really, it was his only chance to get away from here, so he didn’t have anything to lose while trying that.
That sounded like a great idea. That way, as a dog, he would be completely entangled before he could even try to follow them.
Dean is bored and even if he wants Castiel’s sacrifice to be useful by living a normal life, life just is not easy without his best friend.
“Humans have needs! Biological needs that you must take care of every day! Multiple times a day!”
“What Metatron is trying to say,” started the guy from the other side of the wall, “is that they are supernatural creatures invited in Sinclair’s zoo every day. That is what he wanted to scare you about earlier. Every day, one kind of supernatural individuals are invited and apparently today is the fairies turn.”
“Breakfast dude! It’s just awesome, I tell you!”
The Sinclair-guy was probably some rich psycho who used his money to kidnapped human to show around supernatural creatures. After all, Dean was just a normal guy and it’s not like the fairies could have verified anything the guy said to them. And the kids were happy to see a boring human, the hunter guessed that for them it wasn’t something they used to see every day. The lore about fairies was clear that the fairies was for the biggest part a peaceful species who used to live hidden from the world.
“You want to kill the poor guy? But he didn’t do anything! He’s probably just under a spell or forced to be here!” Dean was raised to think that if you see a monster you shoot first and ask questions later but here, he started questioning himself about that ideology. It's something his brother and father always have disagreements about and teaming up with someone with feathers sprouting of his back makes you think a little about the definition of what is good or bad. If he wanted to get out of here, he needed to think that maybe all monsters weren’t bad. And something about killing this soft looking guard without hearing him first felt wrong.
“That should be it. I need you to destroy it. I think if you scratch it, it should be enough.”
“You’re my best friend and at first I thought that was just that, you are having a special place in my heart because of that. But time passed, I made new friends, a new family and I understood that the feelings I had were more than that. Those feelings were something I never felt before. And I was scared. Because you’re an angel and I thought that you couldn’t be able to reciprocate them. That’s why I never said anything to you. But then, Jack and I met an angel and a human, living together for millennials. But I was still afraid that you couldn’t feel this way. But then you said it and I never said it back. But now I can say it and I’m saying it again: I love you Castiel.”
He did what he had to do in less than that time when the voice spoke again to told him that if he needed an extra 5 minutes, he could find a button next to the toilet seat. Dean took his time finding it, knowing that it could be useful sometime soon.
I’m sorry that I took so much time but my computer die just when I could take some time to write… But now, I'm back with a new chapter which is a little shorter than the others but it's a transition that needed to be done. I’m already working on the next chapter but because I’m back in school I don’t know how long I’m going to need to finish it.
“Of course, Dean.”
“You already found a job? That’s great Dean!” Sam is taking it better than Dean thought.
“You should strip.”
Dean continue to read his book, which is more interesting that he first though. He never heard that werewolves had secondary gender before, after all he didn’t really care about stuff like that when he was disseminating a dangerous pack.
Okay. This girl is weird but maybe he could use this for his advantage. Apparently, she was just a student probably doing this job to gain some money between classes. Probably not the job of her dream then, just a boring task needed.
“W-would you like to come meet them?” Cas offers hesitantly. “Our family really is quite nice.”
They’re taking her again and Dean can’t save her—
Sam’s mouth shrugs open. “So that was all… you did that all on purpose?”
Also, this fic (which I have finished 18 chapters of) is already 30 pages aka ~20k words longer than The Wounds Inside with 22 chapters. In case anyone was interested.
Fingers crossed Dean, Cas, Sam, and Jack all get the ending they deserve.
IMPORTANT: At the end of this chapter is a very slight reference to forced prostitution because we thought the Capitol could not get any worse. Do not read if this will trigger you. However, it is just as graphic as when Eileen and Dean discussed it in the Roadhouse bathroom—as in, not at all. It will become more graphic in later chapters, but I will never describe the actual action; I do not write smut as I am underage. By graphic, I mean that Dean will think about the specific partners he's had while at the Capitol, but the most I will do with that is describe his reluctance, entering the room, and the outrageous clothing his partners wear. No character will describe the events in detail. If this offends or triggers you, please do not read further or read with caution as I tried to make it as implied as possible. I did take a bit of this d-plotline from Finnick's story in the Hunger Games where he was forced into sexual slavery by the Capitol, but this fic will not take it anywhere close to that level.
Sam flushes. “Shut up, Dean.”
“You’ll survive not seeing your boyfriend for two weeks, Dean,” their surrogate father responds. “Don’t argue with me, boy.”
Sam snatches the coins eagerly and looks up at Dean, pleading. Like Dean’s going to say no. Plus, having a few extra coins never hurt anybody. Though most of their supplies are shipped to their front doors and some people in the market will give them food without asking for payment, it’ll be nice to spread the wealth around and actually pay for goods.
Diego brightens at the idea and Sam leaps off of the couch, positioning himself between the murderous superpowered human and the half-archangel. “We still don’t know why the angel’s powers are working while there’s no heaven,” he says firmly. “We’re not risking any more injuries.”
“Fifteen,” Five says promptly, then he scowls. “Bitch. I’m still not giving you them. Get your own.”
He’s dressed in a black unitard that’s almost as bad as being buck-naked.
“Nope,” Dean lies quickly. “I was teaching Sammy here how to—”
In the opening ceremonies, tributes are supposed to wear outfits that represent their districts, ie agriculture for District 11 or fishing for District 4. District 5’s principal industry is power and electricity that mostly comes from a hydroelectric dam. More often than not District 5 tributes are dressed in a scanty little water-like outfit or a worker outfit. It’s practically sicking, and always predictable.
“What are you doing here?” he spits.
“You’re on, Winchester,” Jo grins after checking her wallet. “You’ll have to put it on my tab, though. I’m not packing cash.”
“Really?” Ellen turns to Jody. “That’s the first I’ve heard of this.”
“If you might not have to throw a party when you come next. It would heighten anticipation for your next visit and make the party seem more exclusive. Besides, you might say you’re doing it out of respect for the tributes who’ve given their lives during this year’s Hunger Games.”
Charlie nods, smiling gently. “It’s my first year with the Games. I wanted to be a Gamekeeper, but they wanted me here.”
“I’m not sure,” Sam calls back, but his voice is funny. Like he’s much farther away than the living room.
“Your enemies have a price on my head,” she replies. “While you three seem to have a knack for escaping the clutches of death, I’d prefer not to have to create another charm to prevent me from the unpleasant sensation. It can be quite painful to die, even if I survive.”
“Cas, you’re a saint,” Dean breathes without thinking.
“It is
“Sam, you are very bad at hiding your feelings. So is Y/N.”
Dean’s chest hurts. “I’m nineteen, Sam. I’m an adult.”
“You’re not going to switch out?” Dean asks suspiciously.
I need people to reassure me that you're still going to read this even after that godawful ending, because goddamn I am not sure if I will be able to rewatch the show like I used to.
Castiel was stuck here since longer than him so he probably already tried a lot of other plans. The guy with all his knowledge was probably a hunter with a big book collection like Bobby. At least he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
“I found something called
And Bingo! “It’s full of human food. We’re taking it with us, Dean.”
“Uhm, what are you doing?” Dean asked a little panicked.
Now Dean was eventually sure to be alone. He could finally think about what that dude said when he described him as a… what was the word again… a vessel?
“Do you see somebody on the pavement outside? Do you think I can come?” Dean wanted to be sure that the way was clear before coming and risking ruining their plan foolishly.
Dean open the compartment carefully and took the key. Everything went smoothly and the guard wasn’t disturbed in his nap. But really, an asteroid crashing behind him would probably not wake him.
The voice stop and Dean almost fell where he stood when his move could move freely again.
Hearing the voice of the one he thought was a fellow human hunter shock him from his stupor. He took a step back and starting questioning.
He sounded like he tried to call Dean a few times already. With a mouthful, the hunter answer:
“I can’t, Dean.”
Defeated, Dean slowly turn around to look more carefully at this room where he was trapped.
Ugly-bowtie-Sinclair was leading the crowd and gather them in front of Dean’s cell. He was making some big movement to the crowd, like some weird touristic guide.
Dean was so focused on watching Castiel's reaction that the booming voice filling the void made him jump a foot in the air. Castiel gave him an annoyed look over his shoulder while Dean could only give him a sheepish one.
Okay, that's new and it wasn't the response that he hoped for. “What like a dog?”
He brought a fork to his lips and moaned around it. They were heavenly. He was happily eating with gusto when he heard Castiel’s voice again.
“Let me look.” Those questions where weird but his friend was motivated to find a book so Dean couldn’t just go ‘bye! Goodnight!’ when his friend sounded like that.
“No.” Well at least that response didn’t give Dean any fake hope. “If I had, I wouldn’t be here genius. So now, you can stop banging the wall!”
That was kind of crazy that he trusted this guy so much. After all, he met him only yesterday and he didn’t even saw him. But he was the only nice guy around here who talk to Dean like he was a person and not some kind of freaky animal that you want to observe. And Cas was really motivated to leave this place with Dean and clearly, that was a good point in Dean’s eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
I everyone! I'm so terribly sorry that I disappear for so long... At first, I didn't have time to write because of college kicking my butt, then I had my English finals and started doubting myself a lot. You know that English isn't my first language, I probably said that at the beginnings of all my chapters, but I'm still afraid that what I write isn't understandable. Especially since I write in the evenings when I'm tired because it's the only moment I have time.
The young man just stood there, wasting time in the eyes of Castiel.
This weird cabin was missing a wall. All he could see from his bed was a few feet of grass before a weird pavement with some decorative cobblestones. The small light illuminating the room was in fact just the sunset light.
Once they were back in the control office, Castiel walk straight to the desk with a confused Dean behind him.
“Humm” Dean brains blank because they didn’t really talk about the cover story of why Dean needed to bring this angel prisoner in here. And what kind of injuries, an angel could even have?
He was trying to make a valid escape plan while he fell asleep.
When he came back, the sun was down so he took his book to read on the bed until his eyes were too heavy to continue. He killed the light and try to find some sleep, hoping that tomorrow at the same time, Castiel and him will be far away from this place.
Without anything better to do right now, the young man picked up the book he left on the table before. He settled down comfortably on the bed to continue his lecture about the hierarchy amongst werewolves and what differences between them existed to make “Alpha” socially more important than “Beta”.
“Well, it was a small black thing in a corner… Nothing exceptional about it.”
The next chapter is already halfway written and since it's one that I wanted to write since the beginning of this story it should be done for next weekend! (But as always I don't want to promise anything)
“As I said before, Sinclair does the visit himself. He just avoids taking his guest to see some area when they could see their peers or other creatures that would bring to a problematic situation.”
“What? Of course, I have to pee.” The ‘Duh’ at the end of the sentence was left unsaid but you still could hear it pretty clearly in the intonation. “Why did you sound like that was a big surprise for you? Did you hurt your head?”
“Yes, Dean?” The response came clearly and shortly after the question, like if the guy was just standing near the wall since Dean left before.
Yeah, Dean had to agreed that that made sense.
Castiel was talking animatedly. That was a big contrast with his usual matter of fact-robot voice he used so far. And for what Dean could hear, he was becoming completely crazy. It sounded like the fact that Dean just came back from the bathroom was the most amazing thing that his neighbor heard in weeks.
I should probably read everything to make sure I didn't lose myself somewhere but to be honest, reading my own stuff makes me cringe so I'm just going to hope for the best right now...
“That’s my name.”
From what he was currently seeing, they did a wonderful job. After all, with the spell he was using on them to make them obey his wishes it was the only thing they could do.
“Yeah. Thanks, man, I’m okay.” Dean reassured him. “But what does Tinkerbell’s army wanted? Why were the kids looking at me like I was some kind of unicorn? I understand now that this is some kind of zoo but, why I’m here?”
He showed them his last paper and went full force with the puppy eyes (Sammy will be proud! ):
Thanks a lot for reading and please if you have time to leave a comment or a kudos, it's always very appreciated!
Dean could understand the need to be careful, so he did as he was told and carefully slid his precious note through the trap of the ventilation system.
“So what’s the plan?” Dean relied on the other since his first plan worked great. Dean had an idea, but it sounded just crazy in his mind.
“Yeah?” Dean answered with a mouthful, but he couldn’t care less about table manners right now and the guy sounded like an ass anyway. “What’s your name by the way?”
Dean huffs slightly. “Seriously? A rat? That’s such a waste of energy.”
“And me and my brother aren’t either of those things,” Sam realizes. “Which would be why he hates us.”
Then Dean had seen a figure in red running down whatever hallway they’d landed in and he’d taken off. No matter how fast he runs, the figure in red always seems to be one step ahead of him.
“Sorry,” Dean says automatically. “I didn’t mean to, ah—”
“We could take turns?” Jack suggests.
“I was walking with Dean and Sam when we saw Jo, Ellen, Bobby, and Jody,” Cas responds, following after you as you try to listen and walk to your car at the same time.
Sam looks at the clock and curses when he sees he’s right. “Screw you, Gabriel!”
Sam crosses his arms stubbornly and glares at Dean. “You’re a Victor, Dean. You could choose to stay.”
“I’ve never tried a house or something like that, obviously,” Luther admits, rubbing his chin. “But I’ve never really found something that I haven’t been able to lift.”
A little disappointed he didn’t get to see you, Sam plugs in his phone and hops into the shower. He can’t wait to get in bed.
Dean groans internally,
“How despicable we must seem to you,” Charlie says after a moment. She’d obviously been watching Dean’s face as it contorted, looking around at all the elegance people only get to experience for a few days a year.
Dean scowls. Well, yes, there is (but only sort of) a looming apocalypse on the horizon, but she wasn’t supposed to know about that. “Why? What’s in it for you?”
“Jody, Bobby, Ellen, Jo!” the elder Winchester yells, waving frantically at them with the hand Cas isn’t holding.
Dean sits bolt upright. “Bobby—”
“I think something’s wrong,” Sam whispers.
“Hey, look,” Sam says, pleased. “They’re in full bloom. Animals haven’t gotten to them yet.” He’s right. The few strawberry bushes are laden down with berries. A little while away, the blueberry bush that Sam has tried to nurture for years finally seems to be yielding fruit.
It sounds like a lie or an evasion, but what does Dean know? He
He sighs and drags a hand down his face. “Soon, I assume. Naomi doesn’t like me to spend too long without making a public appearance and stirring the Capitol’s enthusiasm. I trust that she’ll at least give me until Gregory Washington wins.” He says it pointedly, sure that if Naomi isn’t listening to their conversation right now, surely one of her minions is.
Well…
“Yeah, that makes sense, I think. And how can you forget the food dude? Food is life!” That sentence was said with great enthusiasm before he remained his task of inhaling is plate.
But now, finding that key for Castiel’s chains sounded a little difficult. He looked around, imaging that an old looking key would be hanging on the wall beside the door. It was worth a shot since everything was so cliché so far but no. Life wasn’t a bad movie.
Castiel said he wanted to knock him out so Dean expected him to just give him a big blow on the head, but apparently, that wasn’t the idea. Castiel just put his index and middle fingers above the guard sternal notch and pressed hard. The guard's eyes open wide with a 'What the hell is going on' expression, so Castiel pressed harder and the guy just lost consciousness from the lack of oxygen.
This time, Dean didn’t get his answer right away. When he started to think that maybe his friend was already tired of him, Cas spoke like he had an illumination.
Dean let his head fall against the door with a thud. He will find a way to get away from here. He was quietly trying to make an inventory of his option when his nose caught a delicious smell and his stomach starting to growl.
“Put him on the bed please,” Dean asked.
Thanks a lot for reading and please leave a comment or a kudos, it's always very appreciated! (I hope I didn't burn your eyes while reading because I wasn't very focus when I edited...)
Cas turned and look at Dean expectantly, waiting for him to go in there first. Guess it’s the infirmary then.
Dean remembered that since Sinclair and his entourage came, he couldn’t hear anything from outside. He though that probably whatever soundproof spell he used was still working and the guy just couldn’t hear anything.
“Dude?”, yeah, he really needed to learn the guy name, that was just ridiculous.
“Huh yeah, Charlie just come and knock.”
The smell of breakfast helps him found the motivation to leave his bed and put on his dead man robe. Miracle follows him to the kitchen where his crazy brother, who just got back from running (because if you choose to wake up early just to run, you’re a crazy person) is making breakfast. When he arrived the toast just pop up from the toaster.
There was no breakfast and no new exit. And unfortunately, there was nowhere where he could empty his bladder because there was no way he was going to use the thing with the folding screen. That thing looked like made of polystyrene and the screen was way too transparent, thank you very much.
“Yes, we should go.”
The weird door-wall open slowly in front of him. Dean had no idea what to expect so his fight or flight instincts were ready. He thought that someone was going to enter his cell, but he was so wrong. What happened was quite the opposite.
The place was just gigantic, and all corridors looked the same to the human. Dean did a lot of confused noises when he saw another hallway looking just like the first fives that they have passed. Castiel had to explain to him in a whisper that even so Sinclair was an incredible magician who could make big indoor places fit into small indoor places TARDIS-style, he didn’t have a lot of imagination for the decorative part of things. To be honest, the two of them were just very lucky that their diversion worked very well. The only guard they saw was just a running kid who looked even more lost than them (must be a newbie).
“Hey kid!” That was his strange neighbor again.
When he couldn’t open the door, even after trying is best, he decided to take a shower. The hot water was actually a blessing because he couldn’t remember his last shower. After that he wrapped himself in the fluffiest towels he ever had. He gladly dressed in the clean clothes because his own reeked. But then again, he couldn’t remember the last time he changed.
Dean doesn’t know how to ask politely what is in his mind, so he just blurts: “You don’t know your girlfriend?”
Dean was lying on his bed. He was trying to learn the sigils that Castiel did in his notebook. He had ripped the page with them and was studying them while pretending to read his book about werewolves and their differents categories that he had already finished.
“Charlie? Is that you?” Dean asks a little awe, a little slow to understand.
“Look, Castiel, we can’t just kill him like a pig in a slaughterhouse. It would make us the monster of this story and it will be very messy, and we can be sure Sinclair will put his best man on our asses!”
“So that’s the fun part I was talking about. That’s what happened when you’re in a zoo, dummy. And apparently today is fairy day.”
After they did their chores, both brothers took place in the library to search for a case or something interesting on their computers.
Is this guy serious? Did he just talk about faith to make him believe that angels were real? Dean just started to become pissed.
Sam is outside running with Miracle.
He stood slowly and walk toward the tray. He found a big water bottle, some snacks, a piece of cake and a big plate greasy bacon, some eggs and even some pancakes. The smell was heavenly, but he couldn’t touch it. He was already stupid enough to fall asleep in this weird place, he’s sure as hell not going to eat the contents of that weird plate. He just couldn’t believe that he didn’t wake up when somebody open the door to leave that here. If his father was still in the picture, he would kick his ass for that fact and for thinking of eating that food.
Dean slowly took a few steps towards the right wall, the one with the second guy who sounded a little more on his side. The kids never stopped looking at him.
“Uhm… Sorry?” yeah, Dean wasn’t really accustomed to neighborhood conflict. Sue him.
Dean was sitting on the head of his bed, ready for bed.
“But why would I trust you?” Some random dude just wanted to help. Yeah… but no.
I started working on the next chapter but finals weeks are coming at uni so I probably will not have the time nor the energy to English, so I'm sorry but it will come in probably at least 2 weeks.
“Oh, you're bringing me lunch! That’s so nice of you” even if he couldn’t move his feet right away, he tried to bring his famous Winchester-smile hoping that maybe they had a way to let him move.
He took a long run-up and swing the chair in the door. The noise from the impact could probably be heard a few miles away and only the back of the chair was still in his hands.
He was examining the room with the morning light, but his eyes quickly focus on a little tray just in front of the weird door-wall thing.
They heard movements and people running somewhere on their right. When the noises seemed to come to a stop, Castiel took Dean’s hand in his and started walking in the other direction. Castiel's pace was fast and he didn’t make a single noise while Dean boots felt heavier on the floor, but he really tried his best to conceal the noise. Fortunately, the zone they rush in had carpet on the floor, helping Dean being more discreet.
I’m working on the next one, and hopefully, it’s going to get more interesting.
“Yeah, I can try.”
That made Dean stopped to plan the guy murder in his head “Sorry I’m a what now?”
“It’s hot!” Sam says trying to warn his brother.
“I think there some kind of trap blocking me. Did you see any sigil?”
“Why do you mean by the fun part? What does this dude want from me?” Dean asked his neighbor Megatron? Metatron? What’s wrong with people’s names around here anyway?
Dean turned his head to face the glass wall, and he almost had a heart attack. On the pavement there was a couple of little kids. A brown hair boy who looked not older 8 years old was holding a little blond hair girl who looked like she was only 6. Both of them were looking at him with big eyes filled with awed.
