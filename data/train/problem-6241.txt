"We're okay. Better than okay. We're good. I..." A blush stained his cheeks. "I like the things we do. Before the serum... I was sick all the time. Sex wasn't even something I thought about. I never would have been strong enough to follow through on any of the things I wanted, much less try anything new. And then I was better. Stronger. But I didn't have the luxury of dating or playing around. I had a war to win, and everyone was counting on me to do it. Everything was on me."
Steve was small, the skin soft and silky, with no trace of hair anywhere. Tony cupped him, able to fit the entirety of his cock and balls in his palm. When Tony’s hand closed around him, Steve groaned in pleasure, pressing back, trying to get him deeper.
Tony made his way out of the bedroom to his playroom. He put in an order for pizza with FRIDAY before rearranging the space, laying out anything he might want to use. Tony let them sleep until food had arrived before slipping into the bedroom and waking them with gentle touches and kisses. They sleepily made their way out to the living room.
"You'll find out. But please, by all means, keep racking 'em up. I do love to see you squirm. Now hold still. You're distracting me."
Steve immediately turned, leaned forward, bracing himself on his arms, perfect ass lifted high. His thighs glistened in the low light, coated in steadily dripping slick. Tony knelt down, lined himself up and pressed into Steve’s overly sensitive hole. Listened to him gasp and moan as he clenched tightly around each of Tony’s thrusts. Knowing how sensitive his boy got, Tony reached around, gripped his small, soft cock, squeezing and rubbing each time he stroked into him, driving Steve crazy. He whimpered and thrashed beneath Tony’s body, trying to both jerk free from the touch on his overly tender cock while arching his back to encourage Tony to rub against the sensitive glands in his passage.
He shook his head. "No. I'm up now, I won't be able to get back to sleep. Besides... It's not the same if you're not there."
“Shit. Sweetheart. I didn’t…” Tony shook his head miserably. “When I said privileges, I meant things like television and phone calls. Me comforting you? That isn’t supposed to be something you lose. That’s part of my responsibilities. It’s how I take care of you. I’m so sorry I made you feel like that. I’ll do my best to make sure you know how much you’re wanted and loved every day for the rest of my life. I promise…”
Tony grasped Steve’s arm, pulling him onto his lap and cuddling him close. “Such a good boy for me. I mean it, Steve. You’re mine, and I’m never letting you go.”
Steve’s eyes grew wide, a tightness in his chest made it impossible to breathe. He could see it so clearly. If one of his friends were hurt because he wasn’t there… If something happened to Tony, and it was his fault… “I- I’ll talk to him. Tell him the team needs me here.”
Tony was kneeling behind him, palms coming around to grasp at his chest, bare hands kneading the flesh hard enough to bruise. Steve moaned, tried to arch back against him, felt his cock slot in between his cheek and rub over his hole, but the sensation was so dulled that it brought him no pleasure. Tears slid down his cheeks. “Tony, Tony, please. Please. I’ll be good, I promise!”
Tony sucked in a breath, nostrils flaring and eyes going dark. When he spoke again his voice was deeper, a growl low in his throat. “Oh Steve… You have no idea, do you sweetheart?” He pushed Steve back onto the bed, prowling over his body, pressing him deeper into the mattress. “You smell absolutely divine, baby.” Tony dipped his head, flicking his tongue over Steve’s bond bite, drawing a moan from his lips. “You’re in heat, baby. And I’m gonna fucking wreck you…”
After he was done, Tony stepped into his body, wrapped his arms around him holding him close. "That's my good boy." He gripped Steve's hips, pulling them into his own, grinding them together, until Tony came with a moan.
“Like Stark Industries?” Even with all the time Steve had spent on the streets, he had still heard of the company. Everyone had. They had interests ranging from clean energy to medical technology, with a specialty branch dealing with omega training and rehabilitation equipment.
"Hmm..." Tony's gaze ran over him, and Steve could feel it, almost like a caress. "Well, I don't have anything I have to do today. You?"
Tony sighed heavily. “It became public knowledge that I took a mate. You know that. When you live under the press’ watchful eye, they jump on things fast. The day you had your little tantrum, I’d gotten a phone call from someone I used to know. His name is Tiberius Stone. He reminded me of what a fuck up the general population thinks I am. That no one would stay with me willingly. That I’d have to force them to. And it hit a little too close to what you’d been saying… I guess I kind of broke. I have a history with Ty, and one of our other mutual acquaintances.”
“It’s medicine, sweetheart. You need it. Once you’ve absorbed all of it, it should trigger your heat.” Steve’s eyes widened,  he began struggling against the restraints, screaming behind his gag as the vibrations spiked, sending him tumbling into another agonizing release.
The wait was longer this time, a hiss of sound like a match being struck. Drops of heat fell onto a nipple, burning for a moment before cooling, trailed over his chest to the other side. It had to be wax. Dripping over his other nipple, pooling and trailing down over his side. His back arched, trying to get closer, a hiss leaving his lips. "Tony..."
"As long as I want. Better be good. Because if you're bad, I'll just have to leave you in lockup longer."
“Remy’s been in position for a day and a half. Not much movement. Bobby and I are on the roof, ready to go in on your signal.”
As soon as they stepped inside, Tony began digging soft fuzzy blankets and a mountain of pillows out of various closets before carrying them all to the guest room beside his. He tossed them onto the bed, disappearing only to return with a few pairs of oversized track pants and t-shirts that looked like they should fit the other man. This Steve seemed to be a little slimmer that the other one.
"I did. And... He's so much more than I expected. He can be so sweet to me, Nat. The morning after our first date, he filled my apartment with flowers."
As much as he didn’t want to, Steve felt a small amount of sympathy for the man. His current situation wasn’t what he wanted it to be, but it was better than a slow painful death. The rest of his words began to sink in and Steve looked up at him in shock. “Wait. You stabilized?”
“Of course. I’ll bring it by later.” It always made him feel a little small and shy when Tony said things like that. As if for just a moment he was the same man who needed to be cared for and protected, the way he was before the serum. The way Bucky used to.
“Pretty baby. I know. It’s so hard. And I’m so mean.” He brushed his thumb across Steve’s cheek, wiping away a tear.
“None of that, now. Good boys take the punishments they earn without complaint. Now, ready to move on?”
Leather straps fastened around his waist, keeping the thick dildo exactly where it was. When he flailed, Tony caught his arms, holding them behind his back. His body was burning and aching, he could feel his passage trying to milk the toy inside of him, reacting as though he had been teased for hours already instead of only a few minutes. He gasped, turning begging eyes on his alpha.
Tony let his fingertips trail over the metal of the cage, a covetous expression on his face. “You’re so beautiful, Steve. Look so good like this. My sweet little omega.” When their eyes met, Tony’s were blown so wide they looked entirely black. “Did you know that there’s an offshoot of Stark Industries that produces technology to help alphas keep their omegas in line?” He continued on when Steve shook his head. “You’re wearing one of my designs. Bio-imprinted. The only thing that can open that lock is a scan of my fingerprint and my override code. You’re trapped sweetheart. Mine.”
He tried going down to the gym to work out his frustration, but as soon as he started the treadmill the cage tightened around his cock and began to pulse. And vibrate. The next thing Steve knew he was on the floor behind the machine and decided it was in his best interest to go back upstairs. When the vibrations drastically increased as soon as he stepped on the elevator, he decided the lab was better. If nothing else he could drop to his knees and beg for mercy.
“Fuck!” Tony crashed their mouths together, biting at his lips, hips grinding down against Steve’s thighs. “You asked for it, sweetheart. Remember that.” He levered himself off of Steve’s lap, dragging him up with the painful grip on his nipples before shoving him backwards towards the elevator. As soon as his back hit the wall, Tony was on him, hands running down his back over his ass, taking handfuls and gripping hard enough to bruise.
"Don't want you to, Tony." He tucked his face into the crook of the older man's neck, feeling weak and vulnerable.
Bucky watched Steve gear up for another mission. The third this week. He’d tried to get Bucky to come with them. Made him feel guilty when he refused. Reminding him of how long he’d been looking for him, how he’d always had Bucky’s back, felt safer when he was there to watch Steve’s.
Hello lovely people! I’m sorry it took so long to work into the story. But finally, the reveal of who Bucky has been secret dating! Ta da! Oh, and a good helping of more kinky porn. Because apparently that’s all I write.
He smiled when their eyes met, but there were shadows beneath them from lack of sleep. “Of course, sweetheart. But I did want to talk to you. Have a seat.”
Tony smiled. "You're right. I think you just got very, very lucky, Steve." He slipped the chain from around his neck, walking over to his side. Kneeling down, he carefully unlocked the cage, setting in on the ground beside him. As soon as his cock was free, he swallowed him down completely, the plug jumping to its highest level. Steve screamed, coming almost immediately. Tony kept working him, through the oversensitivity, and through release after release, until everything was overwhelming pleasure and the world went dark.
Steve's legs tried to give out when he stood up, nearly sending him to his knees. Every step he took pressed the plug against his prostate. He bit his lip to hold in the moans and whimpers that wanted to break free as he slowly, so slowly, followed Tony into the kitchen. By the time he got there, Tony had already started the coffee maker brewing and was digging through the fridge.
“From killing an unarmed and broken man?” Tony arched an unimpressed brow, then sighed, slumping back against his workbench. He kept his arms wrapped around Steve’s waist, holding him close. “I don’t know what I’m doing. I really don’t. I know that the person who showed up here the other night isn’t the one I met in Siberia. He’s not Rogers’ pet, and he hasn’t done anything other than hide since he got here. It’s just throwing me off, I guess.”
Steve hated himself for giving into his own weakness, even as he buried him face in the side of Tony’s neck. The scent of evergreen and motor oil surrounded him, soothing in a way he hadn’t expected. Tony rubbed over his back, letting him cry against the collar of his shirt until he was calm. “I don’t… I still don’t want this. Want you.”
Time lost all meaning. The only thing that existed was Tony's body under his hands, his cock throbbing in his mouth until he finally spilled down his throat. Steve swallowed around him, chasing the last drops with his tongue, lapping him clean as he pulled away.
Steve tightened his grip, slowed his hand, squeezing firmly up and down the length. Lightened his strokes, speeding them up. Nothing worked. A sob tore out of his throat as his cock throbbed, painfully hard and unable to come. Tony eased his hand aside before fastening a metal cock ring firmly around the base. Steve gasped, body jerking at the increased pressure. It was horrible. He wanted it to stop. He dragged in ragged gasps, clinging desperately to Tony’s shoulders. “Alpha, please!”
Tony laughed. “Yeah? Then why are you trying to get hard, honey? You think I don’t know what goes on in that cage of yours? You love it.”
“Alright. Well, I think you might like it sweeter. How about I fix it for you that way, and if you don’t like it, we’ll switch to black?” He added a healthy dose of cream and sugar to one of the cups, turning it a light caramel color. He held the cup to Steve’s lips waiting patiently for him to take a sip. “So, what do you think?”
Steve went limp against the desk, feeling wrung out and overwhelmed. He felt Tony's arms slide around him, gently untying the knot around his wrists and stroking the skin the silk had reddened. He gently tucked Steve back into his pants, fastened them, and sat down in the chair, pulling Steve into his lap. Tony's fingers gently carded through his hair, stroked over his back, gentle soothing touches.
“Yeah. Brain tumor. Spent a year going to the best oncologists on the planet. None of them could do anything. Inoperable.”
“Good boy.” Tony pushed the coffee table against the wall, leaving a wide empty space in the center of the room. “Why don’t you come over here, James.” He obediently rose to his feet, moving to stand at the ready in the space Tony had indicated. Tony nudged Steve’s pillow, turning it slightly so he had an unimpeded view as well. “When you are ready, you are going to do a series of one armed push ups for us. Metal arm behind your back. You will have… Let’s say two minutes. Got it so far?”
“Put on a show for me. Because if you don’t? I will.” He set a slim remote on the table beside him. A silent warning. Steve nodded, gathering his strength. He pushed his toes against the floor, hand resting on the front of the bench, rolling his hips against the toy. He had barely started when Tony was telling him to stop. He leaned back, waiting.
When Tony returned to the couch with the specific menu he'd been looking for, extolling the virtues of whichever cuisine he'd decided was a crime against humanity that they hadn't tried together yet, Steve simply curled into his side, smiled, and agreed to whatever he wanted. He wasn't there yet, but Steve might be starting to fall for Tony Stark.
The cloth slid up Steve’s thigh, slowly approaching the cage that still held him securely. He swallowed hard before answering. “No. We’re… We’re good, Tony. I… Enjoyed myself.”
"There you go. Almost done, sweetheart." There was a tugging as the ginger was pulled free from his aching ass, his cries turning to relief as the burning dimmed to a low level.
He wasn’t sore, but there was a slight tenderness in his muscles from last night that a part of him enjoyed. He was also acutely aware of the cage being off. It was… Unsettling. He had grow accustomed to it’s weight and constant presence. He made a mental note to ask Tony about it later as he turned back towards the tower. Feeling energetic, he took the stairs up to his floor, bursting through the door and coming face to face with a complete stranger.
Tony shifted to the side so he had a better view, dropping a hand down to squeeze his aching cock at the sight. James dragged the tip of his tongue through the gathered slick, moaning at the taste before attacking with a vengeance. Steve wailed, writhing in his bonds as James’ tongue flicked over his entrance, plunging inside to stroke over his inner walls. The cries increased in pitch as Steve drew closer to release, until he was shuddering at the edge. Tony waited for the small hitch in his breathing, even though Steve tried his best to hide it. The moment he started to fall over, Tony gave the order to James. “Stop, now.”
"I'll handle the rest of the team. One on one is probably best. I'm glad Thor is still off planet. Makes it easier."
Steve nodded. “Thank you, Jarvis.” It took him a few minutes to figure out how to reply to the message, touch screens were so much easier, but he finally ended up with something he could send.
“I do… The papers mentioned her. Said you tossed her aside and broke her heart. Had some sort of scandal right after.”
For everybody who has been waiting for it, here’s Bucky’s POV. Let me know what you think in the comments! Remember, I write more when I know someone other than me is enjoying it.
“I… Umm… You- You kicked me out of the tower this morning, and… I rode the subway for a while so I could think. By the time I got off it was night, and I was starving. I got something to eat, and sat down in a doorway, but then the door disappeared and I was inside with this weird guy named Strange who kept saying all of these things that didn’t make sense about preserving multiple timelines? And then he was making glowing shapes in the air and they came rushing at me and I felt sick. When I opened my eyes I was here. I’m sorry, Stark. I really don’t mean to cause you so much trouble.”
“That doesn’t mean you always will be. I think you should talk to Fury. Tell him you need to cut back.”
“You sweet boy. Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it. You stay right here.” Tony disappeared into his closet for a moment, before coming back with a triumphant look on his face. “Good thing I’m a kinky bastard. I love being prepared.” He rubbed the cool metal of the plug against Steve’s throbbing hole, using his slick to get it ready, before pressing it into his body.
“You delivered the first box to the common floor on purpose. And running into me in the elevator. That wasn’t a coincidence either, was it?”
Steve stood up and stalked downstairs to the lab. Bucky was right. He was always right. If Tony was going to throw away what they had, he could damn well do it to Steve’s face. “JARVIS, open the door.”
Tony moved behind him, he could hear the sound of a cabinet being opened. When he returned, he moved in front of Steve and began to play with his nipples, tugging and pinching until they were hard and throbbing before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a pair of clamps with metal weights hanging from the bottom. He attached it to one of his nipples, pinching it tightly, carelessly letting the weight drop afterward. Ignoring the harsh cry it caused and repeating the process on the other side. As soon as he had finished, the plug began to vibrate again, causing Steve to jerk in the restraints. The motion made the weights pull, nipples beginning to throb under the cruel pressure.
A low, desperate whine filled the room as Steve arched his back more, thrusting the dildo harder into his wet hole. Close. He was so close to relief from the unending frustration. But even as he thought it, he could feel that edge slipping further and further away. He let out a cry of frustration, pulling the toy free and throwing it across the room before collapsing onto his back and burying his face in his hands.
Bucky looked down, taking a trembling breath. He had to obey. Even if it felt wrong to use his given name. Even if he didn’t deserve to. He had sworn to do as Stark wished. “Yes Tony…” His voice was barely above a whisper.
"That's right. So I'm thinking for two major infractions, twenty minutes should be fair. Yeah, that sounds right."
"Uh uh. Naughty boy." Tony reached back behind him, gripped the base of the plug and pulled it free, carelessly tossing it to the side. "You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?"
Steve nodded tiredly, eyes fluttering shut. His entire body ached like he’d run a marathon then gotten into a fist fight. And he still wasn’t done. If he didn’t trust Tony, know what sort of person he was, it would be easy to assume he was needlessly torturing him for his own amusement. The problem was that Steve did know him. And if Tony said that he had to do this, that it was for his own good… Tony might completely ignore his own health and well being, but never anyone else’s. Especially someone he felt responsible for.
Tony's arms slid around him, drawing him back into his body, and Steve happily snuggled into him. "Blindfold off, or on for a little longer?"
A wave of calm flooded him. This was right. Somehow, Stark had helped him get it right. Steve relaxed, feeling like he could breathe for the first time that entire day. “Yes, alpha…” His voice was soft, but there was less fear present in the tone.
Steve slid closer, pressing his body against Tony's. "I want breakfast. Belgian waffles and bacon. And I want to blow you while we wait for it. Sound good?"
"Oh honey." He felt his heart squeeze in his chest. How much had this man been through, to be so afraid. "And I lost everyone and everything. I'm always afraid that everything is going to disappear. I guess that means we match."
It was Steve’s turn to cup his chin, force Tony’s gaze to his. His blue eyes burned with fury and indignation. “First of all, no one is ever going to say anything like that about you around me. You were hurt and taken advantage of. You don’t deserve to be made fun of for it. Second, I don’t care what the punishment is gonna be for it later, if I ever see either of them, I’ll fucking kill them myself. And third, you are not allowed to go to events without me anymore. If you don’t let me have clothes for them, then I guess it’ll make ‘em even more interesting. Because you are my alpha, and I will protect you.”
Before he could react, Tony had buried his face between his spread cheeks, devouring his hole the way he had his mouth earlier. One hand gripped his hip bruisingly tight, the other stayed between his thighs stroking delicately over the metal of the cage, caressing it. Steve cried out, his passage clenching around the burning heat of his tongue, slick pouring out into Tony’s mouth and over his thighs. It was overwhelming and he was just the right amount of painfully sensitive to have him releasing beneath him with a loud cry. But it wasn’t enough. He still felt empty and wanting. “Tony! Tony, please!”
The orgasm crashed over him, tearing a scream from Steve’s throat as wave after wave of ecstasy ran through his body. Tony kept moving inside of him, drawing out every last bit of pleasure before allowing Steve to collapse into a spent heap. He barely noticed the restraints being released, only realizing he was free when Tony lifted him into his arms. Steve rested his head against Tony’s shoulder as the other man carried him back upstairs. Steve was deposited gently on the bed, covers drawn up over his shoulders. Suddenly he was unable to keep his eyes open. He felt the gentle press of lips against his forehead and a soft murmur that included the words “workshop” and “sleep”. This time it was easy to obey. To slide into the oblivion of dreamless sleep.
“I… I know you aren’t happy… With him here. And I know you’re just doing this for me, because I stopped you from…”
"Yes Tony." Steve tugged off his clothes eagerly, laying them over the chair, and taking a seat on the bed. Tony disappeared into the closet, coming back with the gleaming silver cage and the key already on the chain around his neck.
Steve felt slick fingers probing at his hole, rubbing against the tense muscles there, and nearly sobbed in relief. Finally. Tony was going to take care of him, and this need driving him to insanity would finally go away. He was just as careful as he had been the night before, slicking his hole and stretching it slowly before his fingers slid away. "This still what you want, baby?"
“As I was saying, you have been building up a whole list of strikes against you. I know you rubbed off on the bed before I got you locked up. And how many times you’ve tried to take off your cage or take out your plug. Not to mention your attitude the last few days. You’ve earned yourself one hell of a punishment, sweetheart.”
Steve shook his head, wondering once again how he always knew exactly what Steve was doing and thinking.
Because I couldn't get plot out of my head, have another chapter! Major brownie points to anyone who saw this coming. I'm going to try to catch up on my other story, since there are a few points where plot (what little of it there is) overlaps, so you can look forward to that sometime soon. Comments and suggestions are always welcome. I hope you enjoy!
“Me? Not usually. Left to my own devices I spend too much time in the lab and live mostly on coffee. Gotten better about that recently, just because I get hungry now.”
“I know, baby. I’m sorry.” Tony sighed as Steve slowly relaxed against him. “There’s my sweet little omega. It’s okay. I’ll take care of you.”
Tony fumbled with the fastening on his pants, freeing his cock as he slid up to straddle Steve’s shoulders. “I’m sorry, baby. I’ll take care of you later, I promise. But I need you right now. Be a good boy and let me have you.”
“No, it’s not fair at all. Poor boy. This is so hard for you, isn’t it? Alpha’s don’t take their time to play with pretty toys, do they? Just mount you and leave. I’m never gonna do that, Steve. I’m going to take my time. I want you to feel me in every fiber of your being. I want it all to belong to me. You gonna give me that?”
Less than ten minutes later his hands were sliding over Steve’s chest, squeezing his pecs and teasing his nipples into hard points. Steve groaned, head falling back against his shoulder. “Tony…”
“Oh.” The genius’s pleasure visibly dimmed, causing Steve’s stomach to clench. “Why, what did you need?”
Tony let out a long sigh. “Oh Steve…” He curled a hand around the back of his neck, holding him against his thigh, the other began softly stroking through his hair. Soothing. “You don’t get it, do you? You scared me today. I spent hours watching you throwing yourself right in the path of danger. You care so much about everyone else, and so little about yourself.”
Steve felt a weight settle in the pit of his stomach, did his best to turn his back on the alpha, outraged all over again at the facility’s denial of clothes. He felt too exposed. On display. Which he obviously was. The alpha continued to speak to the handler, gaze trained on Steve for long moments, before he turned and walked away. Steve let out a breath, relaxing against the wall. Disaster averted, at least for the moment. They’d left, which meant he’d chosen someone else. Steve was still safe.
Steve bit his lip, toes digging in for purchase. He didn’t have room to lift himself off the toy, had to content himself with rolling his hips and rocking back and forth. It felt good, especially considering how sensitive he already was, but was nowhere enough to bring him to release. And Tony knew it. He watched Steve struggle for a while, eyes dark and focused solely on him. He picked up the slim remote, turning it over in his hands, drawing Steve’s eyes to it again and again as he waited for the inevitable.
The morning was spent touring a museum Steve had wanted to see, and Tony listened with a soft smile as he spoke excitedly about the artists displayed, the particulars of the painting styles he enjoyed, and why the specific works were chosen for display. Lunchtime found them at a small cafe that they passed that caught Steve's fancy, and Tony was more than willing to indulge him.
Steve’s breathing began to come in harsh pants, his hands shaking as he tried to curl up even tighter. He was spiraling again, only this time it was worse. His eyes squeezed shut as he tried to calm his spinning thoughts, but it didn’t work. Steve was going to crash, and there was nothing he could do about it.
He forced himself out of bed and into the shower, cleaned himself as fast as possible, not wanting to linger on thoughts of his body. Afterwards Steve headed to the training floor. It was usually a good place to distract himself from his thoughts.
Thor frowned. "It was... Father was set against Loki from the start. He did not allow my brother to so much as speak in his own defense. My mother and I managed to dissuade him from summarily executing Loki but were unable to reason with him further. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with no visitation allowed."
Tony’s voice was hard, vicious. And Bucky knew he deserved every word. He dropped to his knees, bowed his head, waiting for his own execution. There was a sense of relief there, underneath it all. It was finally over. He was finally done. “I’m sorry… So sorry…”
Apparently his fascination with Captain America had survived their last encounter. And Tony was fairly certain that the new and improved Steve Rogers would probably be over the moon if he knew that Tony wanted him. Stupid meddling sorcerer.
"Alright. I thought you might want to start off slow, but if that's what you want..." The machine responded immediately, fucking into him hard and fast, each thrust rubbing over his prostate. He tried to meet the movements, but was held in place, only able to take what he was given. Tony reached under him, a firm grip on his cock, stroking him, building the pleasure. Steve cried out as he reached the edge moments later, pulsing and spilling over Tony's hand.
“I understand plenty. What I want to know is, where did that punk from Brooklyn who never took no for an answer go? Because that Stevie would have marched downstairs and demanded to be let in no matter how long it took. He’d have broken down the door if he needed to. But you? You sit around up here mopin’. I guess it’s just not worth the effort, huh?”
Steve buried his face against Tony’s shoulder, blinking back tears once more. His voice was a soft whisper. “Thank you, alpha.”
Steve began moving the toy again, hips rocking, unsure if he was trying to avoid contact with that sensitive spot, or chase more of it. Several times Tony ordered him to stop, adjust one of the settings, increasing the speed or strength of the vibrations, pushing him closer and closer to the edge, desperate for relief. So close that a little more stimulation might have him coming despite the cage. A groan behind him signaled Tony's release, frustration at the thought of being denied again making him want to scream.
Mumbled begging and pleading fell from Steve’s lips as Tony drove him closer and closer. And then like some miracle, he was there, coming over Tony’s fist as he continued to pump him. The sensation was nothing like what it had been when he was a beta. It felt like burning knives tearing through the inside of his cock and stabbing deep behind his balls. He screamed, struggling against Tony’s grip, trying to make it stop, even as the serum ensured that he remained hard. Steve finally went limp in his arms, feeling weak and helpless as he sobbed into his alpha’s shoulder.
"Good boy. Smart boy." A gentle kiss brushed across his forehead, prompting Steve to let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He picked the right choice.
“Hmm. I’ll remember that. Don’t worry. This part won’t take long. And then you’ll have other things to worry about.”
“Why don’t you stay right here and rest for a minute. I’ll go start a nice hot bath with something that probably does nothing but smells really good mixed in.”
The cramps had eased when Tony began working Steve’s body, but he felt uncomfortably empty, needed to be filled. He breathed a sigh of relief when Tony’s mouth released his entrance, only to cry out at the quick thrust of fingers into his aching passage. Steve’s body squeezed around them, urging them deeper. Tony paused to rub firm circles into his omega gland, the pressure relentless until he released again with a low whine. Steve rocked his hips up as Tony slid deeper, hands gripping the sheets hard enough to tear. As much as he wanted the alpha inside of him, he wanted to be good for the other man more.
Tony blinked a few times before he could reply. "Yeah. Didn't expect to run into you here. Or your...?"
When his eyes opened again, he was curled securely in Tony’s arms, the alpha’s knot still lodged deep inside of him. “Hey…” He murmured.
“You’re welcome. Let’s get you upstairs. We can take a bath. JARVIS has it waiting.” When Steve nodded again, he lifted him, carrying him into the elevator and through the penthouse. Tony settled Steve in the steaming tub before stripping off the remainder of his clothes and sliding in behind him.
He swallowed around Tony, felt him twitch again, conversation never faltering. And then he did it again, before swirling his tongue around the head. He heard Tony break off in the middle of what he was saying, cover it with a cough and continue. Steve continued to lick and suck until the cock in his mouth was fully hard and leaking before letting it slip back into his throat. He could feel his own cock lengthen and thicken, for once able to get hard without the restriction of the cage.
Steve’s body shuddered with every movement Tony made. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. The girth of Tony’s knot seemed to take his full attention. It seemed larger then before, fuller. He had the hazy thought that maybe Tony was going into rut, before the pleasure stole that away too. Tony sank his teeth into the bond mark, ripping it open again and drawing blood as he savaged the side of Steve’s neck in his frantic need. He moaned his release against the skin, an unending flood of come filling Steve’s body in heavy pulses.
Steve pulled Tony into his arms, kissed him over and over again. "I think I was waiting for you. All the time in the ice, drifting afterwards. I just needed to find you. Thank you, for saving me Tony. Because you did."
Steve groaned long and loud as Tony's cock finally pressed into him, gliding deeper until their bodies were pressed flush against one another. One arm wrapped possessively across Steve's chest, gripping his shoulder, holding him firmly against him, preventing the possibility of movement. He tried anyway, desperate for friction, and was denied. Tony was forcing him to stay still, cock buried deep inside his body, until he allowed otherwise.
Tony shushed him, quickly injecting the medication before setting the syringe aside. “You’re actions have consequences, Steve. You need to get used to that. I let you go so we could have breakfast. You ran away, tried to break my door and window, then planned on attacking me. I wouldn’t be doing my job as your alpha if I let that kind of behavior go unpunished. Now, we’re going over to the table, and we’re going to eat. Alright? Nothing else is happening right now.”
Steve paced restlessly in the confines of his holding cell. He had to find a way out of there, before something worse happened. It was bad enough that they had discovered his secondary gender. Worse that they’d immediately taken him off the suppressants he’d used since he was a teenager, insisting they were detoxing him for his own good. He needed to get out before some uppity alpha decided to make Steve their property.
Steve sat down on the couch, intently studying the concrete at his feet. "I talked to Natasha. She wanted to know what was going on with us..." He smiled. "Apparently I've looked like a real dope the last few days."
“I know. But let me try? We have the next three days free, barring psychopaths or aliens trying to invade the world.” He let out a breath, a soft chuckle. “Never thought I’d say that. Anyway. Give me those three days. Try for me. Give in and let me do this my way. If you hate it, or can’t do it, we’ll figure out something different. Deal?”
Steve straightened from his bent position causing the toy inside him to shift deeper, and his knees almost gave out. He grit his teeth, remaining on his feet by willpower alone. His cock throbbed insistently against the metal of the cage, forcefully reminding him of its presence.
“We’ve been over this, Rogers. You’re a liability out there. What happens if you go into heat during a fight? Or if an enemy triggers your omega instincts? You’ll be ass up and halfway to happy land, and the rest of us will be screwed. If you hadn’t lied about your gender to SHIELD we wouldn’t be in this mess to begin with.” Iron Man took an intimidating step forward, and Steve could feel himself fall back, give ground. “Go find yourself an alpha who wants you, and stop pretending to be a hero.”
But after the last few months, Tony was feeling less than charitable. It felt like everyone had walked away from him, abandoned him. What would it be like to have someone who couldn’t do that? Who was dependent on him? Who needed him desperately? Who could stand against whatever threat came next at Tony’s side? And Tony had the power to make it happen, didn’t he?
“Aww, Stevie. C’mere.” He pulled Steve into a tight hug again. “The hurt’s only temporary. I promise. And if you haven’t gone into heat, it’ll be better for you than it was for me. And once you stop fightin’ all the time, it’ll get better.”
Steve felt sluggish, as though he was trying to move underwater, sinking deeper every moment. His limbs felt heavy and ungainly. He wasn’t sure if he could move if he tried. Somewhere far away he was still conscious of the hunger inside of him that never went away, but the call of omega-space was more insistent. So for once, Steve stopped fighting. He trust his alpha to keep him safe, and let the peaceful calm carry him away.
"Well, I hope it was worth it. When I got home, I was going to unlock you and fuck you through the mattress. Now, I'll just have to come up with a punishment for that hungry little hole of yours instead. Something creative, I think. Otherwise you just won't learn your lesson. Isn't that right, Steve?"
Steve nodded frantically, rolling his hips up into Tony’s hand. Tony curled his fingers around him, stroking over the satiny skin, encouraging Steve’s movements. He knew it was more than a little mean to tease him like that, the inhibiting agent would continue working for several more hours. But it was intended to be a punishment. Besides, Steve was gorgeous chasing pleasure with abandon.
Once he was calm, Tony was moving again. Bucky felt a light touch on his soft cock, jerked with a bolt of panic. Tony continued his ministrations calmly, lifting it and sliding a slitted metal tube around the softened flesh. His balls were just as carefully pressed through a metal ring, a thin metal strip running between, lifting and separating them. Then Tony’s touch was gone. Instead the metal seemed to come alive, moving on it’s own, closing protectively around Bucky’s cock, tightening down until there was no chance the restrained flesh would be able to harden. The loop shrunk around his balls, squeezing them together, holding them close to his body. His cock was bent back, curved into itself, followed by the unmistakeable click of a lock. Everything stilled.
Once his knot had gone down and they’d recovered enough for Tony to guide them to the raggedy couch in the corner of his lab, Steve tucked securely in his lap, he nuzzled his throat and asked again. “Did everything go alright at your appointment today, sweetheart?”
“Never, sweetheart. Never again. My good boy. My sweet boy. My love. I’ll take care of you. It’s alright now.” Steve tilted up his tear stained face, and Tony’s lips met his in a tender kiss. He could finally relax.
Tony also kept his word on another matter. It had been a week and he still hadn’t let Steve come. He had never been denied so long before. His body was always humming with arousal, it was all he could think about most days. He begged Tony at every opportunity, but his Dominant remained firm. Which only turned him on more.
When he realized what was happening, a light pink had begun to color his cheeks. With every bite, every gentle brush of Tony’s thumb over his plump lips, the color had darkened. James kept his gaze firmly on the ground, obviously overwhelmed by the situation. But enjoying it. Tony made a mental note to indulge both of his boys more often as they finished the last of their meal before finally breaking the silence. “Would you boys like to play a game?”
He clung, trembling, letting the words wash over him, the promises warm him. “I love you too, Tony. So much. Please don’t do this to me again. I can’t… I can’t stand it.”
He’d gone to the kitchen for something to eat one night. The door to their bedroom had been cracked when he returned. Carelessly. But Stark was never careless. He moved closer, making sure to avoid the golden spill of light from the room, peering through the crack. Steve was on the bed, on his knees, wrists bound with crimson rope to the headboard. Stark was kneeling behind him, cock buried in Steve’s body. Even as Bucky watched, Steve began to lose control, trembling on the edge of orgasm. Stark drew back, until only the head was still inside. Holding there with iron control, until Steve let out a miserable whine, pulled back from the edge. Only then did he start moving again. It was a beautiful and erotic dance.
The water drained from the tub as Tony got them both to their feet and dried them off with warmed towels. He guided Steve to the bed and gently settled him beneath the blankets before sliding in against his back, arms wrapped tightly around him, holding him close.
“That’s better.” Tony lifted the paddle, bringing it down on a rounded cheek with a crack. He could see Steve’s ass clench, his passage tightening around the plug, making him wail. Tony began paddling him with abandon, making sure that no matter how much he squirmed each strike landed exactly where he wanted it to. Once he’d settled into a rhythm, Tony was able to truly enjoy himself. The first thing he accessed was the nanobots, sending the command for Steve’s cock to harden, wanting him to struggle against the cage. Next he turned on the implant, sending pulses of vibration through Steve’s prostate. Finally Tony accessed Steve’s Extremis, using the virus to manipulate his hormone levels, sending Steve’s arousal soaring.
Tony shrugged. “He’s got a point, sweetheart. You are always awfully sweet when you want to release. And he’s been through so much... If what he wants is for you to be sweet to us for a while, I’m going to give it to him.” Steve let out a soft whine, burying his face in the pillow. “Be good now, omega. Or I’ll lock you up. And not that little cocklet that you don’t like us playing with. I’ll make something to lock up your slutty hole, so you can’t touch it until I decide to let you.”
Standing up, Tony moved back to where James was sitting, running a gentle hand over his shoulder. “Ready for yours now?” He nodded, tilting his head back to look up at Tony, eyes blown from arousal. “Good boy. I have just the thing. Be right back.”
It continued to press forward, until Steve was a desperate wreck, uncertain of how he would stand any more. Tony pressed a button, halting the forward motion. Steve hung there, limp and exhausted, unable to ignore the new sensations for even a second. His passage clenched around the intrusion, trying to force it out or adjust around the length, sending shivers dancing up Steve’s spine. His alpha was relentless. Possessive. Would own every inch of him, inside and out, eventually.
“Ready baby?” Tony’s hands slid up his thighs, gripping them hard and spreading him open, leaving his most intimate parts on display. Steve nodded hesitantly, and Tony immediately dived forward, taking his soft cocklet into his mouth. He tried to hold still, not writhe away from the steady sucking pressure, but it was difficult. The sensations were so intense, he could barely stand it. And Tony knew, his dark eyes were trained on Steve’s face, watching him struggle. He released with a cry, a flood of slick rushing out of him to soak the cushion below, and still Tony didn’t stop.
“Remember sweetheart, every hour you’re here counts for one of your punishments. I’ll see you in the morning.” Before the door closed behind him, the last sound Tony heard was Steve’s frantic wails.
Steve listened to Tony's breathing slow. His murmured endearments becoming soft and slurred. "Such a good boy... My good boy... All mine... I love you..."
"Tony..." He half-rolled onto his side, burying his face against the older man's leg. His nipples were still sore and throbbing, and he winced when the movement put pressure on them.
It took a few attempts before Steve could coordinate his muscles enough to roll over, arms crossed above his head. He felt Tony's hands glide over his ass and thighs, caressing the skin before they slid away. A hard slap landed on his thigh, followed by more over the skin of his ass. The sting caused his hips to jerk, driving down into the bed, before they jolted up again to receive the next. Air seemed to leave the room, and he could hear himself panting. Over and over again, his skin hot and throbbing beneath the painful strikes. But like the night before, the sensations seemed to twist, turning into pleasure, making him more desperate that he had been before.
He reached back, grabbing a blanket and tucking it around Steve carefully. "Don't want you to get cold, sweetheart."
“Yes. Your orgasm earlier helped me calibrate it. Your implant monitors a variety of things in your body that allow me to personally tease, edge, or ruin for you. I can also control automatic settings that remain until I change them. Even if you managed to leave me, you wouldn’t be able to take off your cage or have an orgasm without my permission. And trust me, I could make it so much worse for you, baby.”
Steve felt his eyes widen. This version of Tony was nothing like the one he’d known before. He was strong, yes, but also kind and caring in a way Steve had never seen in an alpha before. “I’m… I’m glad I’m here, Tony. With you. Not… Not him.”
Was this a consolation present? Sorry I’m ending things but have your dead friend back? He could feel Bucky watching him concerned. Knew that he heard him sobbing into his pillow at night. There was a dark empty pit inside of him, threatening to swallow him whole.
Tony pressed a thicker plug of his own design into him, relishing Steve’s low moan.  As with everything else in the tower, it was technology designed by Tony that was easy for him to control. Steve needed the hormones he would receive from Tony, had been deprived for far too long. He would be lacking in his duty as an alpha if he left him in a plug that the other man could remove. Because Steve would try to remove it. He’d do anything and everything to fight against his situation, doing unacceptable amounts of damage to himself in the process. Which Tony couldn’t allow. Once he’d been settled, grew accustomed to his place, Steve would be grateful for the care Tony was taking of him now.
"So pretty like this." The wax was gone, replaced with the feel of Tony's nails scratching over his sensitive skin, peeling the hardened wax away. "Just for me."
He turned the last remaining vial of Pym particles over in his hands again and again, trying to think it through. He could go anywhere in time, but even at the worst points in their relationship, Tony would never give him what he needed. And there would always be an expiration date. Because Tony had sacrificed himself for them all. There was nowhere for him to go here. No place he fit. And the longer he stayed, the higher the chances that someone would realize he was there. Would expect him to be Captain America again. In the end, the answer was simple.
Steve felt the familiar clench of his muscles, the tension in his body drawing tight. For just a moment he thought that Tony would have mercy on him, let him come from the feel of his mouth on his sensitive hole.
Each time Steve thought it might be over, the cage would shrink, increasing the pressure building inside of him to unbearable levels. When he finally thought he might black out, the vibrations finally ceased. He lay there, panting and staring up at the ceiling with unseeing eyes.
They reemerged before too long, heading directly to where Tony and Steve were sitting, Bruce flashing them a mischievous smile. "So, did you boys enjoy the show?"
They had spent the weekend quietly, enjoying the time together, laughing and talking like always. Then Monday came, and work along with it. Before he left for the day, Tony had bent him over the bed, opened him up, and slid a fairly large plug inside of him. Then he'd kissed him, told him to be good, and left.
Unsurprisingly, it didn’t take long before there was a soft rap on the door, followed by only a moment’s hesitation before Tony entered the room. His expression was softer than usual, as was his voice when he finally spoke. “Hey Capsicle. Heard you were a little under the weather.”
The genuine concern in Tony's voice helped him to relax the rest of the way. "No. No, this is perfect. Thank you."
They had nearly reached the doors when a lovely blonde stepped forward and touched Tony's arm. "Tony?"
"And I would very much like to continue them. But I can be demanding. And there might be things that I enjoy, that you might not. So, in order for us to keep playing, I need to know that you will tell me if you don't enjoy something we try. Alright?"
More metal was wrapped around his legs, slightly above the knee, forcing his thighs even wider and holding them there, leaving him spread open and exposed. "Tony...?"
Tony sighed, setting down the mug. “Today isn’t going to be an easy day, Steve. We need to start working on your omega gland. It’ll be much worse if we wait until after you’ve gone into heat. If you’re a good boy, and let me do what needs to be done, then I’ll call Bruce and arrange for him to come over later with his omega. You can have someone to talk to and maybe make a new friend. Which I think would be good for you.”
Tony gripped his hips hard enough to bruise, pulling them higher so the head of his cock slammed against Steve’s gland with every thrust. He wailed, giving himself up to the pleasure, his alpha pushing him to release again before burying deep, knot swelling, pressing against the now soft slick glands lining his passage. Steve’s cock twitched in his cage, valiantly trying to harden, but the feeling was secondary to the pleasure sweeping through him from his alpha’s knot, locking in place and drawing out his release with every movement of their bodies.
Steve had never felt wanted before. Didn’t know what to do with the constant attention that Tony showered on him. For the rest of the first day, the genius kept him tucked close. During meals he still kept one hand touching Steve at all times. Afterwards, the alpha ran steaming water into the tub and bathed Steve with his own hands, gently easing out the plug from the morning and carefully washing the tender area.
“Fuck that’s pretty. I could keep you like this all the time, sweetheart. Desperate for me, and oh so sweet.”
Bare skin pressed against his back. Steve hadn’t heard Tony strip, had lost a few moments in his confused state. The head of Tony’s cock pressed against his hole, burning hot like a brand, and steadily pressing into him. Teeth sank back into Steve’s neck, tearing open the bonding bite from earlier, causing his hips to arch back, pressing Tony deeper into his sensitive passage. It was overwhelming, intense, like nothing he had felt from his own attempts.
Steve started to panic. This was wrong. Everything was wrong. He couldn’t breathe. Then the world went dark around him, and he was alone.
There was a certain freedom in leaving his arousal completely in the hands of someone else. It had been three days since he had accepted his Sir’s offer, and he had yet to regret it. Steve’s skin prickled with desire as he finished his workout in the gym, trying to take his mind off of the throb of his cock. Which only served to turn him on more. Something was definitely wrong with him. But he was enjoying it. The cage and the control of another, it made him feel safe. Held in an odd way. And it had been so long since someone had cared about Steve Rogers instead of Captain America…
Tony helped him stand and make his way to the bathroom. He got Steve settled then went to the other room to clean up, allowing the plug to shrink, so Steve could expel the enema in private. Probably another thing he’d end up thanking Tony for afterwards.
Steve rocked his hips forward, desperate to come, so close to the edge and knowing he wasn't going to reach it. Sure enough the plug stopped. Tony reached behind him, tugging it free from his body. Steve whimpered, feeling hollow and empty, muscles trying to clench on nothing after being stretched open all day long.
"No. Not like what you're thinking." Steve took a drink of the vodka and handed it back to Natasha. "You were his personal assistant for a while. Did you learn anything about the things he likes...?"
"You've been thinking about it too, haven't you? Dreaming of every terrible thing I could do to you. And I will. Because you're mine." The hand was back in Steve's hair, dragging his mouth up to meet a harsh demanding kiss. Not releasing him until he was panting and clinging to him.
Before he could step back, Tony was moving into his space. He reached out and smoothed Steve's collar into place. A casual gesture, but proprietary in some way. As though he had a right to touch Steve whenever he liked. However he liked. "Do I make you nervous, Steve?"
Steve blushed. "Yeah, Tony. I can do that." He slid off the cushion and began to crawl down the hallway, careful to make his movements as graceful as possible. When they reached the bedroom, he crawled to the foot of the bed and sat back on his knees.
Tony squeezed his fingers around him, fast hard strokes over his aching cock, the machine still pounding against his hole. With the press of a button, it slid a forward a few inches, impossibly deeper, rubbing faster over his abused prostate. Steve screamed, hips jerking back against it with small movements, muscles tightening. He seemed to hang on the edge forever, body tensing as though trying to scale a physical cliff. A slow burn crept up his spine, spreading through him, drawing his aching balls tight against his body. And then finally he was there, pulsing in the other man's grip, screaming and shaking, drowning in the endless terrible pleasure. Feeling Tony stroke him through it, draw it out, until he was gasping, aching.
He hesitated. After all, he was team leader. It was his responsibility to make sure everyone got back safe. But in that moment, it was all he could do not to fall into the older man's arms, let him carry them to safety, take care of him.
"Fuck I love that blush. Okay, sweetheart. Let's finish you up now." Tony began to spank him in earnest, covering his ass and thighs until they were pink and throbbing, the front of the silk soaked from his cock, and his head spinning. "Good boy, on your knees now."
That was when Tony started moving inside of him. Slow, hard thrusts, burying himself to the hilt each time. Pausing to feel Steve spasm around his length. “That’s right, baby. You get to release now. As much as you want. As much as I want. With my cock buried in your tight little hole so I can feel it, each and every time. You might never get off any other way, sweetheart.”
The alpha growled, mouth leaving him only long enough to speak, before he returned to his ministrations. “Not yet. You’re being punished, remember?”
Steve shrugged. “It’s just another of the things you do to me. The ones I get no say in. I’m starting to get used to it.”
When he was looking for them, the differences were many and obvious. Steve was a daintier eater than Rogers. Taking small delicate bites instead of shoveling food into his mouth as fast as possible. He kept his eyes down, either on his plate or his lap, only meeting Tony’s gaze when he was directed to. Not out of avoidance, but deference. He didn’t swagger around and demand to always have things his own way. Steve was sweet, gentle, and timid. Unbelievably shy, with an adorable blush. And so fucking submissive that Tony’s brain wanted to melt. He had to be the luckiest man in the world. How had it possibly only been a few days?
“Would you like to play a game, sweetheart?” He could only nod, but the response still seemed to please Tony. “Good boy. Strip for me. Right here. Right now. You won’t be needing clothes for the rest of the day.
Instead he rolled over, pressing closer to the sleeping man's back. Let his presence and the warmth of his skin soothe him. Not quite back to sleep but drifting half awake. Eventually he felt Tony stir against him, heard the quiet sounds of the blankets shifting, but he felt too comfortable and lazy to move.
“Good boy.” Tony gripped the tube, holding Steve’s gaze as he began to tighten the crank once more, increasing the pressure until Steve was arching his hips forward desperately, trying to find a way to lessen the pressure, overwhelmed by the combination or pain and pleasure it was causing.
Steve followed him over to the couch, perched on the edge of the cushion under his watchful gaze. It felt wrong. He should be at Stark’s feet, where he belonged. He clenched his hands into fists, trying to resist the urge to move. This was why the team didn’t want him. Didn’t trust him. He was a slave to his instincts. He was always going to fail.
He woke up to the feeling of a wet hot mouth wrapped around his nipple through the thin t-shirt. A vicious pinch to the other nipple followed, pulling a moan from Steve’s throat. He blinked his eyes open to find Tony straddling his lap, keeping him pressed flat against the couch as he worked his chest. Once he knew Steve was awake, he sat up to gaze down at him, callused fingers never stopping their work pinching and twisting at his nipples or kneading his pecs. “Fuck Steve. Just look at you. So goddamned pretty I could lose my mind. I saw you lying here, all sweet and innocent looking, and I just wanted to fucking wreck you.”
"Long. Boring. Lots of people who think they're smarter than me only to find out they're wrong. The usual. Lots of boring meetings though. All day, actually. Have some energy to burn. And lucky for you, a beautiful submissive to help me do it."
Tony shook his head slowly. “I’m sorry, baby, but you heard the deal. You knew what was going to happen. So either you safeword, or you let me. Let us.” He softly cupped Steve’s cheek. “Do you need to use your safeword, sweetheart?” Steve shook his head, a tear slowly sliding free. “Good boy.” He pressed a gentle kiss to Steve’s trembling lips before turning back to James.
He moved away for a moment, and Steve breathed a sigh of relief for the brief respite. He returned with a small box he placed on a table beside the bench. It was small and black, with three small plastic tubes coming out of the surface. “I’m going to give you a choice. You listening Steve?”
"I think that would be a good idea. He's afraid. And I can't blame him. If his options on Asgard are worse than on the planet he tried to enslave..."
“Impatient are we? Alright sweetheart, I’ll give you what you need.” Then he was moving, thrusting forward to bury himself inside of Steve in a single movement, riding him down to the bed and forcing him flat against it. Tony set up a punishing rhythm, and if Steve had any hesitations about the effects of Extremis on the other man, they were gone now. No normal human could move like this. Short, hard thrusts pushed him down into the bed, slamming into his prostate every time. The pressure was building, had nowhere to go, made him restless. Steve rocked his hips back against Tony, down into the sheets, back and forth helplessly with no idea of what would actually give him relief. No idea if he actually wanted it or not.
After over a week of the torture, Tony urged him down onto the couch, carefully pressing against his abdomen. The alpha had examined him like this before, but this time he smiled softly. “You’re done, sweetheart.” The vibrator stilled, and Steve relaxed into the cushions with relief. Tony carried him to a table in the playroom, positioning him on it’s surface, feet held open in stirrups, but not restrained. Steve was nearly asleep by the time Tony opened him up, letting out a grateful moan when the cervical plug was finally removed. A wave of cramping followed, but eased quickly.
Steve did scream this time, as his entire body gave a painful spasm and went slack, slow dribbles of come the only proof that his body had obeyed. He didn’t even try to struggle anymore as his alpha repeated the process again, before moving to his inner thighs, searching for the glands high in the crease and forcing them to give as well. Steve felt hollow, wrung out, as his body gave for Tony. Tears slid down his face, but he could no longer tell if they were from pain or need.
He was content to stay there, hazy and floating, with Tony's arms wrapped securely around him. Eventually he felt Tony shift, lifting him easily in his arms and carrying him back out to the car. He dozed off on the car ride home, waking briefly as he was deposited on their bed. His clothes were removed, and his skin wiped clean with a soft damp cloth. The blankets were settled over him, and Tony slid in beside him, urging him to turn on his side so he could press against Steve's back.
Tony wasn’t the only one wanting here. This Steve, he wanted Tony too. It was the only explanation for the sheer devastation he displayed at being rejected and the immediate deference he offered as soon as they met. If he were a good person, Tony would leave it be. Let him adapt to the new world and make his own decisions. But he didn’t want to. And he was pretty sure that Steve didn’t want that either.
He moaned, forcing himself to draw in long deep breaths, to still the movement of his hips. Slowly he began to calm, the frustration from before fading away beneath the contentment that came from being in Tony's care. From being owned by him.
Bucky didn’t try to hide. Walked right in the front door and to the elevator that would take him up to the penthouse. A part of him was surprised when it started to move instead of holding him prisoner inside. When the doors opened, he stepped out. Arms held out to the side, palms open. For the first time in nearly a century, Bucky was unarmed. He’d expected to see Stark waiting for him in the suit, prepared to blast him to kingdom come. Instead he was greeted by the sight of… Steve?
"Alright sweetheart." He stood, allowing Steve to finish undressing him before sitting on the edge of the bed. "Are you going to strip for me? Give me something pretty to look at?"
Steve gritted his teeth, waiting for the cage to relent, allow him to relax. Only this time, it didn’t. The cage stayed tightly compressed around him, squeezing down on him even further. Bolts of pain lanced through him, somehow also accompanied by pleasure. Just when Steve started to think he could gain some sort of relief from the intense squeezing, it relented. Still uncomfortable, and much smaller than it had been that morning, but not enough.
“Great. Then let’s get started. The first one should be really easy. Never takes long to get him there.” Tony stepped behind Steve, gripped his cheeks and spread them even wider, revealing his clenching hole to his gaze. “Beautiful.” He lowered himself to his knees before leaning forward and lapping softly at the sensitive rim. Steve immediately cried out, shifting in his bond, trying to rock back into Tony.
Without waiting for a response, Tony moved over him on the bed, one hand pinning his shoulder while the other fisted in his hair, jerking his neck to the side. He tried to struggle, but his body felt weak and unresponsive. He couldn’t even lift his arms to push the other man away. Sharp teeth positioned themselves over his bonding gland, tearing a cry from his lips as they sank in hard enough to rupture it. A wave of sensation washed over his body with the rush of hormones, pleasure and need so intense that he began to leak.
“This… This is for me?” His voice was quiet. Uncertain. Tony could almost feel the fear radiating off of this man. He was nothing like Captain America, and the lack of comforting touches seemed cruel. Like Tony was punishing him somehow.
After he had bonded with the other man, he had asked JARVIS for help learning as much as he could about omegas and how they were treated. Since he’d registered as either a beta or a null, Steve hadn’t been required to take the secondary gender education classes, and there was a lot he hadn’t known. Tony had been right. It was common for sexually dysfunctional omegas to be caged, and over time trained to a smaller size. The prevailing thought was that removing any alpha-like physiological quirks helped omegas to function better. Tony was taking care of him. But God, did he hate it.
The warm glow of having struggled and succeeded to please his Dominant, of putting their needs above his own desires buoyed Steve for the next week. Being with Tony, and knowing it was him, was amazing. He had forgotten how much happiness could come from that type of relationship. How much comfort and security he could find, not being in charge or making the decisions.
“It’s not too much? The way I like to play with you?” Steve was such an eager and responsive sub that Tony couldn’t seem to resist teasing and tormenting him on a regular basis. No matter what his initial plans had been.
A knock at the door interrupted them, an assistant arriving with the lunch order. Tony took the bag, thanked the woman, and locked the door behind her. He moved back to his side of the desk and unpacked a variety of containers. Then he bent down to pull something out from under his desk before sitting down again. "Come here Steve."
He was quiet as Tony released him from the table, standing him up and fastening the harness around his torso. The wrist cuffs were bound to the lower edge of it, immobilizing his upper body, but leaving his legs free. “See? Isn’t this better?”
Steve let his tongue flick over the head as he slid out and stroke down the vein when he thrust in again. Hollowed his cheeks and sucked as Tony’s movements became more frantic. Greedily swallowed the come spilling down his throat as Tony groaned out his pleasure above him. When his knot was deflating and his cock soft, he pulled free from Steve’s mouth, settling against him on the bed. “You are such a good fucking boy for me, Steve. How did I get so lucky?”
Tony touched his cheek softly. It was hard to put the poor thing through so much so soon, but it was for the best. It would make everything easier in the long run. Bruce smiled at him when Tony released the restraints, allowing Steve to be transferred onto a waiting gurney. “It’s going to be alright, Tony. I promise. Would you like to stay during the procedure?”
“Making you what? Enjoy it?” Tony ground his hips against Steve’s ass, enjoying the way his jerky movements tugged on his knot.
Instead of getting angry, Tony tilted his head to the side, studying Steve with curiosity. “Is that what this is about? Now you’re mad because you think I don’t want you?” Steve turned his head to the side, fighting back the sob that tried to break free at the words. “Oh honey. You should have come to me. Any time you need comfort or reassurance, that’s what you do. That’s what I’m here for. I could have taken care of you. Been nice and sweet.”
"Watch it, Cap doesn't like that kind of talk." Natasha took down another slime golem, getting a mouth full for her efforts. "You know what, Stark? You might have the right idea. These things just keep coming!"
"And you've given me so much that I never thought I'd have. I'd give you the world, if you'd let me."
The sound of grinding metal filled the room, and the frame beneath Steve’s body began to shift, moving him along with it. The table flipped over, leaving him dangling from it’s surface. His arms were pulled back, leaving his neck completely exposed, and his thighs spread wide. A callused finger pressed firmly against his tightly clenched hole, rubbing for a moment before withdrawing.
Tony sat down on the bed, curled Steve into his lap, pressing soft kisses to his lips. “I’ll tell you what. I know you want to be my good boy again, so instead of counting your next punishment as one, I’ll take off one punishment for each hour you’re downstairs. So you can go back to being good for me sooner. Alright?”
Bucky snorted. “Let’s just say I figured out real quick why he was shoppin’ for an enhanced omega. Got my ass pounded into next week by the Other Guy. And after it was over, I spent the next week strapped to a board. I wasn’t goin’ anywhere.”
Time seemed to stretch out around them. Steve wasn’t sure how long he knelt there, basking in the affection from his alpha. Tony didn’t stop until his stomach was full and Steve was back in the pleasant floaty state he’d fallen into before.
Tony offered his arm and Steve allowed himself to be led downstairs to the limo. After they had settled in the back, Tony turned to face him. "Are you sure you're ready for this?"
Articles about the mistreatment of omega’s quickly lead him to information pertaining to suppressants. They were highly illegal and difficult to obtain. There were no companies that produced them, therefore those who bought them were reliant on whatever formula was available in their area. The side effects and long term consequences of use were well known in society. Damage to gland functionality. High blood toxin levels. Organ defects. Congenital heart failure. Development of necrotic tissue in the glands and passage. Death.
An arm slid around Bucky’s shoulder, curling him in against Tony’s chest. He rested his ear against it, listening to the steady sound of his heart beat. Steve tangled his fingers through Bucky’s, joined hands resting on Tony’s stomach. Bucky finally felt at peace, at least in the moment. He knew his place. Where he belonged. As he slid towards sleep, he felt a gentle kiss brushed against his forehead. He said it again, whispered like a benediction.
