And that was that.
They did
John immediately started running, grabbing hold of the doorknob to their flat (
Sherlock looked at his phone, his thumb hovering over John’s name as he hesitated . . .
Stephen sighed before standing up. “Back into the fray.”
Mordo, standing on the edge of the room, looked at him curiously. “What?”
“Of course you were.”
look. “What the hell is going on?!”
Except it wasn’t okay. He’d been gone two years. For two years, John had thought his best friend was dead. For two years, he had nightmares about Sherlock throwing himself off a building, his skull cracking apart in front of him and an unending fountain of blood pouring out.
“Am I still invited for Christmas?” Sherlock asked.
“Yes,” Mordo said with a nod. “Much more peaceful at night, at least where I live.”
John kept going to his therapist. He didn’t tell Mary, but she knew. Of course she knew.
“I’m sorry,” he said, unbidden. It took him a moment to figure out why. “I kept you tied to him for so long. It was my fault.”
Sherlock took pity on him and put the bracelet on. “I’ll wear it. Now go play with your new electron microscope.”
John broke their stare, leaning on the back of a chair. “Lestrade and I just came by to tell you about a new serial killer case.”
Sherlock was curled on the couch, his back turned against the world as he squeezed his eyes shut. He was exhausted, but he didn’t want to sleep. His mind was racing at a thousand miles a minute, but there was nothing to
“Oh.”
Stephen threw his arms around Sherlock and pulled him in for a hug.
“Different?”
Lestrade looked between his friends awkwardly. “I’m just going to . . .” He walked out, shutting the door behind him.
fine. “Why wouldn’t it be? It’s good, you should . . . you should have someone you care about here.” He was angry, but not at his friend. Only at himself. Sherlock was not
“Won’t you get up? It’s a lovely day, we could go to a park, walk around the city . . .”
Rosie felt a lot better after talking to Sherlock and she was really excited that he would teach her reading and writing as they walked back to the others. She was holding two of the bees they had made. "Amy! Ally!" Rosie called happily and rushed over to the girls, holding out the bees for them, "Lock and I made a lot of those together! You can have one!"
"Mmh, would you like me to show you?" John asked with a chuckle and rolled himself on top of Sherlock to smirk down at him.
Hearing little footsteps, Sherlock wasn't entirely surprised when the door opened and Rosie stood there with the twins in tow, "Hi Papa, hi daddy!" she chirped and held the little ones' hands, making sure they won't run out on the street, which made Sherlock strangely proud.
"No objections from my side." Viktor said with a John looked over at Sherlock before standing up. "I'll come with you then, if you then if it's that urgent. And if it's just to avoid the washing up." He teased and gave Sherlock a smirk, before turning to Charlie. "Are you joining us?" "Yup" She said and was already on her feet.
"Really??" Charlie asked him with a grin, before wrapping her arms around him once more. "You think he'll be interested in me by then?"
"Yeah, that's true, I really like her. You'd hope that with that few children they'd make sure to cater to all of them.. but then again they're understaffed and all busy." John said with a sigh. At least now Sherlock and himself would begin to work there. "Do you have any idea why she doesn't seem to play with the other children her age?"
"Oh right. Thanks." John said and rubbed at his eyes, before setting the tray on his lap. He was actually quite grateful that he didn't have to drink the blood straight like that already. At least it still felt kind of normal that way. "I didn't know you could get fried eggs at half two in the morning."
“Sweetheart, I can guarantee you that my response will seem mild in comparison to what my dad will do." John said with a huff. "But yeah, it'll be worse if he sees Richard; especially with him looking like the day he left. He'd go insane."
John laughed at that and nodded. "Yeah, I think he might actually show up in costume." He said and picked up the fake teeth. "But who knows? Maybe a support group would contact with us out of pity..." He laughed, turning the teeth a bit in his hand. "It'd still be nice if that actually existed though."
"His name is Greg?" Sherlock asked and raised his brows, before dismissing it with a shrug.
"Well I'm not gonna be a party pooper, dare." Sherlock said and chuckled again.
"Sherlock Holmes, you will /not/ under any circumstances open that bag of rotten lobotomised brain. Especially not anywhere we eat, is that clear?" John interrupted him exasperatedly.
"Me neither." Sherlock said and chuckled, before giving a small sigh, "Though you might be right about us having to talk to her, not only about the running off, Viktor wasn't specific, but I mentioned that Charlie was nearly kidnapped a while ago, no details don't worry, but Viktor told me that Rosie had mentioned a possible reason for it.. that does sound like she was quite open about our financial situation.. and that's definitely a problem, we don't need more reasons for them to be in danger."
"Yeah, I'll hang on to that." Charlie nodded and gave him a smile. "Thanks for covering for me. I owe you." She said, glad John and Rosie were already back to roasting marshmallows again.
"Yeah.. that we do." Sherlock said, biting back another smirk as he pulled up in front of the massive building Clara and Harry lived in. "There we are."
On the following weekend Sherlock and Mycroft met each other a in front of the orphanage, while the Watson men were out on a fishing trip and the girls having a sleepover. Their mother, of course, had been more than joyful to have the brothers do something together; even though they had already done that this year (and it was /still/ January). Nevertheless Mycroft had to admit, he was a bit curious to see how they organised that many vampire, even if he wasn't exactly fond of young children in general. "Hello, brother mine" He said as Sherlock walked up to him.
"Let's wait for them, they do sound like there having fun." John said and leaned down to give him a soft kiss; plus a few more minutes together with Sherlock wouldn't be too bad either. "Though, are we letting Charlie handle boiling water alone with Rosie?" He asked after a moment.
William stopped drinking after a few seconds, making sure he didn't get carried away, but good god it felt so good to get some blood. "You alright?" he asked, looking up at Jim.
Sherlock chuckled a bit at his new nickname, "Anyway, you go back to John and Rosie, I'll just quickly go and lock the door downstairs." he said, holding the keys up.
A few minutes Sally returned and put on her polite smile for Rosie again. "Seems like everything's right. She needs to be back at supper time, that's at half past seven. Violet is accompanying you?"
Sherlock chuckled, "I really didn't..." he said and shook his head, now feeling incredibly stupid about being so anxious about this. "I hardly doubt running after you in panic counts as really well..."
John pulled their blanket out of its covers to change them, chuckling at the comment. "Well, if I could snap my fingers to make you lie in a clean bed, I'd do it."
"Ha! Nice try my handsome friend." Sherlock said and chuckled, "Unfortunately for you, he isn't seeing anyone. Never seemed interesting in it, except for his wild fling with Frank the pet mustache, of course." he said and laughed, "But I take it you're up for the couple evening then. Let me text Harry, we could make it some sort of moving in celebration next week." he said pulling his phone out with a smirk on his lips.
John pressed a kiss on the top of Sherlock's head. "Well, that's good to know, love. And yes, I don't quite know what to do with this thought yet. Coming back to your original question. The answer is no; once I decide, I want to be sure enough to make my answer final."
David remained silent, waiting for whatever Vanessa was going to tell him. He was only sitting here because of his family and because he respected his sister-in-law, not because he wanted to discuss or talk to his father... But he was a grown man and he'd sit this one out for the sake of the others. "So, I've really only been told the basic outline. Richard was turned during the war and left when you were a child. Did I get that right?" David simply nodded. When it didn't look like he was going to add something to the story, she went on, before he'd shut her out completely. "Good. Would you mind telling me why you're refusing to talk to him?"
"That many?" John asked with a frown, before realising what Sherlock had just said. "And don't you throw your studies for me. Getting a degree is more important than-" Wait a second, hadn't Sherlock already studied several times? ''Either way my point still stands. Anyway, you want to work at that orphanage?"
"Hm, that old thing? Yeah, I did actually. I could never shake the habit if I'm being honest." She said with a chuckle and went over to the hallway to call the girls. Meanwhile John's head shot up. "Hm? What? I'm awake."
"Arse." John muttered grumpily and reached for a kitchen towel to wrap around the cut. "After that it better tastes good." He said with a bit of a huff (mostly though, because he was quite embarrassed).
Sherlock sighed and nodded, "If the dreams keep being like this.. I feel like you will probably know." he said and took a deep breath. "I heard you though.. at least I think so.. you kept saying things in my head like that you've got me and that you're there.. I even felt your arms around me.. in my dream I felt like I was going mad.. but it helped a lot."
"Mhm." Rosie said and smiled, "But when I knocked at their door they didn't answer and I didn't know anymore what I should do when they don't answer so I went downstairs to nana Hudson!" she explained, while Sherlock nearly tumbled down the stairs as he heard Charlie call. Thank god.
Viktor nodded at that; the plan sounded sensible enough. "An explanation would be good." He said and John picked the bug up to check if there was anything else attached to it, though it didn't look like it. "Want to turn it on then?" He asked and held out the mic to Sherlock.
John laughed a bit surprised at that and David tuned in. "Your grandfather, hm? It really was a bit obvious from then on. Though it is even more remarkable that you've apparently served with John's grandfather." John nodded a little and glanced at Sherlock, since they had a few more surprises in stock for tonight. After clearing his throat, he said. "Well, actually mum, we already know about Amy and Vio- Vanessa. Had a bit of an incident a few days ago where Amy really wanted to drink Sher's 'tomato juice'
Sherlock chuckled, "Well, obviously I could tell you what she was like and all.." he said and grinned cheekily, "/Or/ you could just... ask her yourself."
"Yeah, but I think my parents would've probably thought I wanted to move back in, if I had turned up on their doorstep with a bunch of my stuff. And I hadn't actually planned to tell them I'm moving in with you straight away either." John shrugged. "But yeah, retrospectively we could've still thought of that." He said with a chuckle, hoping Sherlock would take a bite so he could kiss him again.
"Rosie's staying with Mrs. Hudson, our landlady; She's basically their second grandmother. It's nothing bad, we just wanted to talk to you and dad about a few things that we can't tell her yet." John told her with a smile. "Could we maybe come inside for that?"
"Okay!" Rosie chirped and smiled as she followed Charlie into the kitchen.
"I don't know.. we could pop in a DVD and cuddle a bit on the sofa while we have the chance." Sherlock said and winked at John.
Sherlock smiled and walked into the kitchen, doing just a quick rinsing with the mouthwash, he loathed it's taste by now, but it was only a small price to pay for getting to kiss his boyfriend properly. And after all, there were various of mouthwash flavours out there, so that probably wasn't so much of a problem. Once he was done, he walked into the bedroom, changing into some pyjama bottoms as he waited for John.
"Yeah, true." John agreed. "They're both so bright though. It's a shame I wasn't in there in the supermarket too."
"We're not, but.. that's.. bullshit, sorry but it's just true. Hunger does not keep you sharp, hunger.. is terrible." Sherlock said and sighed, "Well. anyway, whatever you do or don't tell us, no matter how you behave.. you can have as much blood as you want as long as you're here."
"Yes, financially we haven't been in a situation where we could actually promote each child's interests. So we'll certainly take that to heart now that we've got the means." She said, still a bit shocked at that generous a donation. "Thank you again, I can't say how much this means to us."
John followed Sherlock's gaze with a frown before seeing the glass. He didn't know how to feel about the fact the sight and memory of its smell made him salivate... Closing his eyes he turned his head away. "Later." He mumbled, unsure how to feel about what this implied.. "It worked then?" He asked and looked back up at Sherlock.
"So we'll have bribery for dinner." Sherlock said with a little chuckle, giving Charlie a short smirk before looking straight ahead again, he was a bit proud of her thinking in that area, not that he'd encourage it, since that probably wasn't appropriate parental behaviour.
"Hm, it might be a loose contact." David said and checked the wires, before finding what was wrong with it. "You're lucky, I can just fix it..." He said, quickly working on it; it was only a minor thing anyway. "So, there we go. Rosie, could you turn on the light for me, please?" When they'd been little, Harry and John had always been very keen to press buttons on lifts or turn on light switches.
"I- yes, dad."
"Yes, please do that!" Amy cheered; it was great how many girl friends she had been making lately. "And can we have our cookie-sleepover all together with Rosie and Charlie" She added and peered up at Lock excitedly.
"Well, I don't know that many other vampires outside of the family.." Clara said and shook her head. Janine looked at the phone in Sherlock's and smiled. "Oh, he looks nice. Where exactly does he work?" She asked. "Hey, why are you looking at me like that? Should I be worried?"
"We're nearly there, just a little longer and I'll give you the first injection." Sherlock said and smiled, kissing John's cheek, already getting the injections ready. "Last chance to back out."
"Then let's hope Jamie had had a long and happy life before he or she ended up in your drawer." John said, purposely choosing a unisex name he wouldn't have liked for their own child.
"Dad, about Richard, he really wants to meet you again. In case you want his number-" He was cut off by David's clipped voice.
"Definitely" Charlie nodded with a smile and took them from Sherlock. Already skimming the first page excitedly, she walked backwards to the couch and sat down to put the document's onto her lap. "You weren't lying, she really is a dear." John told Sherlock with a smile, quietly enough for her not to hear them.
Sherlock chuckled, "The picture of Dorian Gray.. I mean.. a guy that stays young over decades?" he asked and chuckled, "Ring a bell?" he laughed.
John rolled his eyes at him in good humour. "And I can see your other father bringing a skull to your wedding." John said with a chuckle, which made Charlie both giggle and then cough as a result. "And I saw you both wearing matching dresses."
Sherlock chuckled, "You will." he said and smiled at the young girl, "I could check if John has a younger cousin," he said with a laugh, "The Watsons do have an astounding ability to deal with people like you and me. My mum is actually married to his uncle."
Here's what the footage Sherlock is showing John roughly looks like:
"I don't know..." Rosie murmured and looked at the floor, "I don't have a best friend." she added and Sherlock shook his head, "Not true. You've got John and me." he said and Rosie smiled, her eyes big, "Really, you're my best friends and I'm your best friend?" she asked, looking back and forth between John and Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled, "I'd say it definitely is a lot better." he said and remembered how he had tried to explain turning to Charlie and used that to compare what drinking blood must seem like to someone who isn't used to it. "Don't tell the others though.. I think John should do it himself."
"Oh, yeah, you're right." Dennis said after some typing. "Looks like there have been only like 5 adoptions in the past 30 years.. And not a single one in the last two years." He said with a frown as he began to gather the documents. "Hm, must be some brats living there." He joked.
"I've never held someone captive before, but I don't know if those go together." John said, and even though he didn't like the idea, he felt more strongly about the girls not being kidnapped. "But yeah, the way she's been working, she's probably on her own and forced to do it." He commented.
Sherlock smiled at that, "Knew you'd get along." he said and grinned, standing up to gather his coat and scarf. "Should we wait downstairs so we actually notice when the cab comes along?"
"Yeah it's over there!" Rosie said and tugged John along the pavement towards Violet's car. Smiling, Sherlock turned to Charlie, "So you and Amber talked a lot about Lowell then?" he asked casually, not wanting to make her uncomfortable, "Do you think he remembers you.. I mean.. your kiss in particular.. I can't help wondering about that dream, you know.. I haven't talked to Jane about it yet.. kind of hard to bring up something like that, especially when you don't know if the other person actually does know about it." he said and shrugged.
Sherlock smiled, "Well, nice to meet you too.. sorry, how is it everyone already knows about my mum and me? I mean.. did she send a mass text or something?" he asked with a laugh.
"Ah, alright. Though from on Saturdays and Sundays we do housework or spend family time together until 12:00 and eat until 1pm. So unless you eat together, you'd have to take her after that." She said, glancing back up from the schedule with a smile. She was glad that Rosie would be included in an activity with other children; it'd be good for her.
John nodded at that, making sure to commit that to his memory. "Well, I'm glad I asked. What good does it bring to start medical training to be able to help almost everyone except your boyfriend?"
Sherlock smiled, walking into the house and waited for Charlie to follow so Mrs Lucas could close the door, before following her into the drawing room.
Sherlock grinned and shook his head, pulling her into a proper hug, "Sorry.. but I hear that's a thing in our new family.." he said with a laugh. "I've missed you too. But.. how are you here? I mean.. when? When did you turn?" he asked, almost rambled.
"Good." Sherlock said and tilted his head a little to peck John's cheek, "I'd honestly rather avoid them noticing any of this, especially Charlie.. it would be just another thing to make her feel.. not safe. This is a sort of sanctuary, at least I'd like it to be for them. A place where they can feel 100% safe. I can't make any promises what I'll do to anyone who changes that."
Ron was (as usual) over the moon as he picked Charlie up to go to his dad's café.. which was basically where they were going all the time since her dads wouldn't allow her to go much further. But that was okay. Everything was okay with Charlie anyway. "So what cake do you want to try today?" he asked and chuckled a little as they started to walk, "Maybe we can start mixing them and create our own flavour." he said with a grin.
David nodded at that. "That's good, she's a good driver. Goodbye, John. It was good to have you back at home again. " He said and pulled John into a hearty one armed hug, patting his back three time with John doing the same, before pulling away again. "Bye, dad. It was great to be here again." John said, smiling at his father, who gave him a small smile in return. After hesitating for a moment he went over to do the same with Sherlock. It was something he reserved for good friends and family and, well, he seemed to count as that now.
"Speaking of that.. we could have dropped by at your place on the way back home to grab some clothes for you.. or grabbed some clothes for you when we knew we dropped by here so I could drink before we went to your parents." Sherlock said and chuckled.
"Can't you.. take her somewhere? I mean.. as her kind of grandmother you do have a valid reason to be interested in getting to know her. Maybe you could take her to the cottage... I do know she's a fan of Jane, so she'd probably be thrilled to go through your old wardrobe. Maybe have a bit of a fashion show.. you don't even have to talk to her about the situation.. just.. see how she acts. If you start to think it affects her too much, I'll keep her completely out of the case." Sherlock said and shrugged, "I just don't want this to scar her too badly."
Sherlock smiled, "More or less.. we email each other sometimes.. before that we sent letters, obviously.. he was mad at me for turning him at first. He had wanted children so badly and thought he couldn't anymore. I mean, I didn't know any better myself. But apparently.. vampires can still have biological children that's news for me too." he said and smirked at John, "Not entirely unwelcome news." he said and cleared his throat, "Anyway, after his son was born, he sent a letter. But we hadn't gotten as close friends again as we used to be. And yes. I can certainly find him. The problem is.. how are we going to tell your father that I'm a vampire and his father is still alive?"
"Yes, I know." John said with a nod. "You're not pressuring me into any of this, but thanks for saying that again." He said.
"Hi, I just want to pick Rosie up for our tri-" Sherlock began and was cut off by Rosie running up to him completely dressed in her coat, gloves and boots already. "Lock! Hi! I'm ready!" she chirped excitedly, holding up a little pink neck pouch with a unicorn printed on, "Look! Mrs Hope gave me /ten pounds/ all for myself!" she said with wide excited eyes. "That's great, bee," he said and crouched down to her. "My sisters, Amy and Ally are really excited to meet you, they're waiting in the car for us."
"Probably, but well, what did you expect after meeting her the first time?" John asked with a smile. "But as someone who knows her, if she didn't like you you'd be able to tell, so there's that."
John stepped inside the room and looked around with wide eyes... That was one hell of a hotel room! "Christ, that's gorgeous. You know, you almost make me feel like a prostitute. An expensive one, mind you." He said with a laugh once the shock had passed.                                                                                                                                                                    Sherlock couldn't help but laugh at that, "That's because you still consider our money mine." he said and rolled his eyes, "Now, pretty woman, here's the bed, I'll pay you after the weekend." he said teasingly.
The both of them nodded and Charlie could almost muster a smile; it was actually really likely that Rosie was out there exploring the neighbourhood; especially if there were nice dresses involved. "Okay, I'll stay here even if your Dad throws John out for good." And John glanced at Sherlock and nodded; "Yes, please hurry."
"Attic." Sherlock said and frowned, "Which is also where I've stored some of my experiments, I think I'll better get them myself and you and Rosie put up the tree." he said, which was pretty much code for 'busy her so she won't come after me to avoid scarring her for life'.
"Hm.. I think we'll be showered in valentine's cards, Janine made some with the kids and Rosie made one for each of us." Sherlock said and sat up a bit, running his hand through his hair to straighten it a bit.
"Hm, okay. Maybe getting out of there in the afternoon will help her a bit. I'm sure we can find time to bring her to classes once or twice a week. At least she'd meet some kids her age." John suggested with a shrug.
Clara chuckled at that. "By the way, we saw the pictures of Rosie's birthday that you've send us and it's a right shame we couldn't make it. It looked so sweet, you must've put a lot of effort into the party planning." She said with a smile and Janine nodded. "I remember her talking about it the next day. She was incredibly excited about the whole thing, it took me a while to figure out you had decorated a room to look like a honeycomb."
"Oh.. good." Sherlock said, wondering for a moment if he was becoming too predictable, "Well, let's wait for John anyway." he said and smiled, "What the school's name though?" he asked since that hadn't come up yet.
"Sounds good." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "We should probably go for human food only though... just so there won't be any .. complications.. though maybe we should have a small room in the back with multiple keys which we'll hand out to the vampire guests?" he asked and laughed, "And people think different nationalities are complicated when it comes to wedding planning.."
"Aw yeah don't remind me." Ron said and laughed, "My mum's fault entirely, she still has a Harry Potter fan blog on tumblr." he said and rolled his eyes, "She even does fanart, she taught me how to draw, actually."
"Now that's really pretty. So pretty that I actually want to buy it for you anyway, even if you don't choose it for your birthday." Sherlock said and chuckled a little.
"I mean, of course, yeah, I find it strange." John said, figuring that wasn't any news; most of the time he just didn't have a reason to think about it. "That idea is still pretty new for me. But that today doesn't change the way I see you or how I feel about you, which is actually why I'm wondering why that is. I guess the way someone looks and behaves are more important to me."
They quickly decorated the rest of the tree, before Sherlock lifted Rosie up to put the star on top, "A little higher, Lock!" she chuckled, reaching her arm out towards the tree. "Alright." Sherlock said with a smile and lifted her just a little higher.
Sherlock chuckled, "You're very welcome." he said and smiled to himself, glad that she still wanted them to adopt them. Pulling back a little, he looked at her, "Are you going to help us tell Rosie?" he asked and frowned, "Do you think she'll like that? I mean.. after all we let her down before when you both thought we were going to adopt you."
"Now?" Rosie asked happily, trying to peek around her own legs, "I can't see the paper!" she said and leant up a little more.
"Yeah, he's Ron's tortoise. And more transparency on the spying part would be nice." Her adventure actually felt a lot more stupid now that she knew Sherlock had been watching her the whole time and probably still knew more about Ron than herself; and yes, it was stupid and irresponsible of her to think otherwise right now, but still, it just felt like everything she did had been baby-proofed for her. "Ron's coming over sometime the next few days by the way. I can take him upstairs, right?"
Alrighty, buckle up!" Charlie chuckled before going carefully down the stairs and holding onto the handrail. "We'll wash your feet first and then we'll sneak that bed sheet down to Mrs. Hudson while our Dads are out. Any questions?" She asked as if they were on a mission.
"Oh. That explains it. I was about to say there are certain things we have to do before we have our own.." Sherlock said with a chuckle, setting the bags down and pulling out a box of cookies, "And luckily... he said, walking over to the girls and crouching down, I brought this." he said and Amy's and Ally's eyes grew wide, "Are they all for us?!" Amy asked and Sherlock chuckled, "Nah.. I think your mummy wouldn't like that so much, but you both can have one.. /if/ you tell me who is who." he said with a smirk and Ally snickered. "I'm Amy!" she exclaimed and Amy nudged her sister, "We don't get cookies if you lie!" she said and looked at Sherlock seriously, "I'm Amy and she's Ally." she said and smiled.
Sherlock smiled, standing up and holding his hand out for John. "Well, even if you weren't straight, I'm very much John-sexual, so.. there's that." he said with a chuckle and Lowell chuckled, "That's very obvious." he smiled and looked at them, "You're like a real life Disney film, I already told John that." he said and Sherlock huffed a laugh, "What's the deal with people comparing us to Disney films all the time?"
David's attempt to pull himself together could only be called meagre at best. He had a hard time to fully comprehend the immensity of what the teen had just said and didn't say anything at first. Nevertheless a few moments later something in him flicked and he managed to force at least his expression from an utterly shocked one back into his usual neutral one. Clenching his fist, he exhaled slowly, his voice low and dangerous. "Leave. Now."
"Oh, no I didn't, I met him in London actually, he had just graduated at Oxford." Sherlock said and chuckled. "Years later he wrote that book."
As the afternoon went on Mark and a few other relatives slowly left, so when Emma was talking to her niece in the kitchen, David turned to Sherlock again. "Would you come for a word over there? I'd like to talk to you in private." He said, the last part being directed at his son. John, who had thought this was going well, didn't look too happy at the prospect to say the least. He should've bloody known there was a catch to this. "John, go help your mother in the kitchen." David said in a tome that brooked no argument when John was still right next to Sherlock.
"Thank you Captain obvious." Sherlock grumbled, coughing again and pulling his knees up to his chest. "Can you call my mum by any chance?" he asked, blindly feeling for the duvet to pull it over himself.
"Good." John chuckled as well and brought their hands up to brush his lips against Sherlock's. At least Sherlock's nervousness distracted him from his own a bit, even if that didn't make much sense. "No matter what happens, I'll still love you. Even if you throw up blood on mum's favourite carpet." He chuckled and tugged lightly on his arm once more to signal him he wanted to start going to the house. "Ready?"
"Yeah he nearly broke up with me about 10 minutes after we got together... that must be some sort of record." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes, "Thanks to Mycroft by the way. We went to a military exhibition and Mycroft managed to get Victor's and my portrait into it.." he said and shook his head, still mad at his brother for that. "But well.. in the end I'm glad I told him.. that really made some things easier.. and it would have felt awful to keep that big of a secret from him." he said and sighed, "Wait, Mycroft basically encouraged you to tell him? I still remember how he gave you hell for turning me.. he didn't seem particularly fond of these things." Richard said and frowned at Sherlock, "Well he didn't so much encourage me as he was trying to remind me of how I felt after Victor."
Mrs Hudson had been out? Better safe then sorry he thought as he gave John a little push, "John, get up." he said and quickly slipped into the pair of briefs that was lying on the floor (for reasons that weren't important right now) before he put on his pyjama bottoms after a quick look around, determining where they had landed last night.
"Yeah, she acted quite awfully." John agreed with a sigh, before pausing. "You know I just met Greg, when I was looking for you.. Just to keep it consistent, I told him we're engaged too."
"Oh, don't you?.." John asked him with a chuckle and ran a hand over the smooth skin under Sherlock's shirt, before leaning down to kiss him.
"Bloody hell, you /do/ know everyone there is." Charlie said with a chuckle and shook her head. "But can we go there please? I'm in the mood for pizza."
"Don't worry. I'm a tough cookie." John replied with a smirk and continued to kiss him, more worried about the open bedroom door really.
Viktor followed both of them inside the second flat and looked around a bit. It really looked like a mature woman lived in this place. He quite liked her taste. Meanwhile John quietly closed Mrs Hudson's door behind them and went with them into the living room.
Sherlock chuckled a little, "It's dangerous, okay?" he said in mock defence, somehow he didn't mind being called a dad, "I told David about the ... well about all of it, by the way." he said, "That's why I delayed him upstairs. I also told him about why we took the girls in." he said, while Emma walked over to Charlie, smiling at her, she had figured something like what David had just told her about the girls when Rosie had mentioned that she'd have tomato juice with her dinner, so it didn't come entirely unexpected, "You play the guitar?"
Sherlock was just a little taken aback when Viktor said he had accepted the offer, though that lasted only a second until he realised the beauty of that idea, though he decided to wait to discuss anything until John returned with the drawing (which Sherlock was sure he was going to get, he had thought of the exact same thing when Viktor had described her), wanting to know if they were dealing with the same person again.
"Two or three." Mycroft said, evidently looking uncomfortable because of that, before unbuckling his seatbelt. Violet didn't even inquire much more, not wanting another argument right at the graves.
John chuckled at that, before asking challengingly "Almost?" He didn't give him a chance to answer though and leaned in to kiss him, because really he'd missed that. Besides, Sherlock was almost healthy again and had a more than excellent immune system for a normal person.
"Okay, good." John with a sigh. "I don't want you to feel neglected or like I'm pushing the child-care duties onto you."
"And a long life at that." John said and kissed the top of his head. "I don't know how it is for you, but to me it doesn't feel daunting, making a commitment like that. I mean, it feels like it should, but it somehow isn't. And I'm way past the point where it just hasn't dawned on me that this is a big deal." He said and look at the ceiling. "I'm just... happy to make it official and celebrate with our family."
"Don't worry.. he's head over heels for me.." Sherlock said and chuckled, turning to John, leaning in to press a kiss to his cheek, "I'm fine.. just drank a bit too much." he murmured quietly and smiled as he pulled back.
"Me neither," Harry giggled, shaking her head, "But then my dad used to do a lot of ridiculous things for John and me when we were little, I once got him to wear a tutu skirt, more or less, it was a crumpled white curtain wrapped around his waist and a light pink tablecloth over it, I was six or so." she laughed.
"Well I was thinking one dress would do. If she's only allowed to try it on once and then she can only wear it again on your birthday, that'll be almost as special as two different dresses." Sherlock said and gave Charlie a smile, "For now though, this trip is all about you. Your dress and shoes are the top priorities today."
When Sherlock arrived back home that day (two hours later than expected since he had been searching basically the whole town for a god-damned bee frame for Rosie's photo, having eventually found one, luckily), he smiled, spotting John in the living room, setting the little bag with the frame down on the coffee table, "Hey..." he said and flopped down next to him on the sofa.
family." Paul corrected him with a chuckle. "I'm still John's uncle if that feels like less of an odd descriptor." He said, finding it still a bit strange himself that he had two step-sons (who were much older than him at that).
"So far, I think all of you kids are great, just a little narrow minded sometimes. Not you, I mean.. but I really think the teachers should put more effort into explaining that some people are different and that it's not a bad thing to be." Sherlock said with a small smile, "But .. since John and I already agreed that I'm the fun trainee parent.." he said with a chuckle, "Would you like to go with Emilia and your other friends on a shopping trip? Naturally you won't have an open end budget there, but that sounds like something people your age do these days and well we could arrange for either of you to have maybe 100 pounds to spend?" he suggested.
"Oh, what, well, not exactly.. wait, you don't even know about half of this..." John said, before scratching the back of his head. "It's complicated, but I'll tell you everything. Sherlock has told me I could trust you with everything." He explained, partly to genuinely make victor feel better after that blow. "He was never in a relationship with the both of us at the same time, I know that for sure, but yeah, it's complicated. Anyway, will you listen to me? Preferably without whatever's under your jacket though."
"Yep." Sherlock said and smiled, "John's already excited to meet you." he said and held out his arm for her to link hers through his, "Shall we go, milady?" he asked with a smirk.
"Ah they sound like people you want to have around.." Lowell said with a raised brow, "At least when you're standing next to a well you can push them into and chain them to the bottom. Both of them, people that just go with people throwing footless insults are just as bad." he said with a shrug.
"Really?" Rosie asked and gaped a little, "Yes, of course, honey bee." Sherlock said quickly and pulled his phone out of his pocket, "We'll send all the photos to this phone, okay? And maybe we can even video call you, give it to Mrs Hudson, she'll help you with looking at the photos." he said, since her phone really was just a phone and text one without any internet access, except for GPS. "Cool!" Rosie chirped and grinned at Charlie, "And you'll show me every dress you try on?" she asked.
"Anyway.. I suppose we have bigger issues than the dog discussion on the list right now." Sherlock said and gave Scout another cuddle before standing up and letting the golden retriever walk over to his makeshift bed, which he promptly started circling and inspecting.
"Everything, really. Wrinkles, hairs on their clothes, lints, their skin, the way they walk, the trick is to pick up on all those little things." Sherlock explained and chuckled as they arrived at Angelo's, "You know.. technically, we could have walked." he said with a chuckle.
"Yeah, that's true." John agreed, before adding. "It's a good thing they're smart enough to understand concepts like that already; well, at least better than you'd expect. So you and Mycroft were like them when you were little?"
John listened to that story and was frankly not too surprised by it; they'd had to find out somehow, though an experience like that would've definitely been very disturbing for himself too. Charlie listened to him very carefully, frowning throughout. "Jesus. I think I'm grateful to live in a time where I don't have to slaughter for bacon and bit for blood." She concluded after a few seconds of thought.
"Scouts honour" Charlie said immediately and lifted two fingers as if to swear an oath. It was a scary thought that Sherlock thought it necessary for her to know that, but that feeling was overpowered by her glowing anticipation. "Do we already start today?"
David just nodded at that and rose to his feet to show Richard the door.
"Fifteen, actually." Sherlock said and handed John his glass, "But he's only just turned 15, I think."
John and Charlie both began to eat their meals. "Your hair looks fine." John said and Charlie bit back and laugh and nodded in agreement; funny was in her opinion fine. Wasn't it very possible that Angelo was a lot younger than Sherlock though? She still had to wrap her head around this age thing.
"We're just waiting for Sally to return with some glue and-" John told Sherlock and got up to his feet, when he noticed a little incredulously the packed plastic bag in his hand. "how much chocolate did you just buy??"
"That's sweet though. I'm sure they'll love it, all three of them." Charlie chuckled. "Was the room pink before or did you do that especial for them?" She asked with a smile, sitting down on one of the beds.
"Sorry, I just really don't like being on those." He said and ran a hand through his hair, putting the drawings away. "Used to wish I was a vampire." He commented with a faint chuckle and Charlie looked at John alarmed, who himself needed a second to get that one. "Well, this way you don't nick yourself during a shave, so there's that." John offered with a warm chuckle when Richard turned around again. "True that." He said with a small smirk, almost looking as if he was embarrassed by the fact he found that joke funny. "My partner's usually very quick to reply, so we won't bother you for too long." "Oh, not at all. It's nice not to have to talk to a wall all day." Richard joked and picked up another part of the decoration to put it on said wall.
"So that's a 'you're my son, so naturally I accept the both of you'?"
"Because the other kids are idiots." Sherlock said with a small smirk, "And I don't mean that as an insult, really. It's just a fact. I know what that's like. Mycroft and I didn't want to play with most other kids either, because they were childish and stupid out of our perspective, looking back though, that was only because they were regular children.”
Charlie had already made quick work of folding Rosie's shirt and jumper and put it onto the girl's chair. "Quick work." Charlie acknowledged with a smile. "Can you do your shoes and trousers as fast as that too?"
With that she closed the door and went upstairs to tuck the sleeping toddler in her arms into bed. While the two outside had been talking John had turned around in his seat to talk to Rosie again. "I think we all had a great time together today. Would you like to do something like that again?"
“Okay, here I am." David said and walked back into the living room. "What's so- Oh you've got out the old tapes?" He asked Emma with a fond chuckle as he read the title of it. "Actually John and Sherlock wanted to talk to you and Emma." She told him sheepishly and pulled him towards one of the chairs opposite of her fathers and looked at Emma to sit down to. Though Charlie still liked teasing her dad, this was probably something they should get out of the way first.
"Actually, Mr Watson.." Sherlock began and cleared his throat, "Could I maybe talk to you alone for a moment?" he asked, it just felt like something David should have some privacy to deal with first.
"Well.. it was necessary, I guess." Sherlock said and smiled at John. "And.. well, you came back so..." he shrugged lightly, pulling John after him into the kitchen.
"Come on, of course I want my big sister over. You two can plot against me via texts now anyway, so you might as well come over." John teased a little. "And mum certainly doesn't hate you. She's pretty much always asking about you one way or another when I'm there."
"Congratulations by the way. And I know it's true, you look better than you have in years. She'll be very happy to hear that." John said with a smile. "I'm seriously glad you've got Clara to help you with that." He said, getting out of the car himself, but staying next to to the open door.
“I mean, I wasn't in that conversation Sherlock had with dad, but... over the course of the night he began to behave so differently. I'd really almost say decently. Remember that thing about our aunt? He stood up for Sherlock without batting an eye and you know how the two of them are." He huffed a little and shook his head. "Yeah, I think he might actually apologise to her."
John smiled right back at her. "Well, they'll be coming with us too. We think you'll get along really well. They're only turning three in a few weeks though, so they'd look up to you a bit and maybe ask you questions. How does that sound?"
"Can't wait." Sherlock said with another dazzling smile, which vanished as soon as he had taken the papers and turned his back to the guy at the counter, leaving the building.
"Hey." Sherlock said and walked over to John, pecking his lips, "How was your day?" he asked, just to test the waters a little, not wanting to talk about that certain subject when he was annoyed anyway.
"That's brilliant." David chuckled and was pleased the light wasn't flickering anymore, before beginning to put the bee case back on. "And you've changed into a very pretty outfit, young lady." He said with a smile.
"Until I've talked to John, you're on the right side of the cat." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "Nice try though." he said, turning the engine on.
"Are you sure everything is alright?" John asked as after getting inside the car. Sherlock seemed oddly hurried. "You know I'm pretty sure the girls will be fine staying with Mrs. Hudson."
Rachel was visibly relieved when she saw that the little girl was unharmed and eyed the two carefully. "Who's idea was it to go outside then? I won't be mad at either of you." She asked and crouched in front of her, just wanting to make sure that /she/ had really brought /them/ outside.
Sherlock nodded, reaching for the suitcase next to the bed and getting out his laptop, "Alright then, let's go." he said, quickly connecting the computer to the hotel wifi, before he opened skype, "Oh she's online." he said, pointing at his contacts, "Charlie Watson-Holmes... it's not even legal yet, but she's already started telling people that's her name now." he said and smiled.
"So just to be clear, we'll kidnap her and lock her up in the basement flat until she starts talking?" John asked after a moment. Not that he was totally against that; he just wanted to make sure they were on the same page in regards of highly criminal activities.
"I can't actually.. At least not easily.. It would take decades, it would just get increasingly unpleasant over time and drive you insane.. I don't really want to think about people in asylums claiming to be a vampire and needing blood.. there's a good chance that some of those are real. "The body would start to fall apart either.. well, not literally.. but it seems like a form of aging. But it can be undone with decades of proper blood supply. Mrs Hudson told me she's seen that back in the early days.." he said and frowned again, "If you don't get blood at some point though, it'd look for all the world like you just died from old age. But as I said, it would drive you mad and cause incredible pain, so it's a bit worse than just ageing."
"Oh shut up." Sherlock said and chuckled as he fed John a grape, mainly to make him shut up about it. "But I'm definitely into the couple night thing, as long as we invite Harry and Clara and not Dennis and Jim.." he said with a roll of his eyes.
"Of course. We want you both to have nice dresses to wear that day." John said with a smile. "But you only get to wear it today and on Charlie's actual birthday so it doesn't get dirty or rip in the meantime."
"No." Rosie said and stood on tiptoes to watch the screen, "But sometimes I've secretly watched the computing classes, so I know what you can do with them."
John, who was already ready to leave, took Sherlock's free hand hand lead them out of the door and onto the street. "I feel like we could hire Harry as our chauffeur, considering how often we take cabs." He said with a bit of a laugh.
"You know what's ridiculous, the house is only half an hour from our former cottage away by car. I mean, yeah, back then with most traffic being carriages and pedestrians, that was quite a distance, but it's irritating how close she's been living for so long. If Mycroft and I hadn't travelled so much we might have met her again earlier." Sherlock said, following Greg up to the house.
"Yeah, that's true. I'm glad Vanessa and Paul have already taken away the edge from that one." John commented with a smile. "Oh and he must've talked to Harry too, if he has your number."
"Sounds like a plan to me." John said and got out of the car. "I don't think they will forget that very quickly.".
"No, I really wouldn't want that." John said with a small huff. "Hey, we've found something even worse for the girls to walk in on." He joked dryly. Though, it was a bonus that he knew they were fine and could definitely not come here.
"Yeah and the animals still learn their lesson!" Amy joined in and Vanessa smiled at them. "You're making some really good points there. I'll have to agree there with you." She said and glanced out the window, recognising the familiar building.
"It's only ever been you, honey." Clara said warmly. She wasn't really a jealous person, so she couldn't really empathise with being jealous at something that could've happened centuries ago.( But she did take it as a compliment.) And it was true; Harry was her first marriage. "And me and Jane really wouldn't have worked out, if that's any consolation." She added with a warm chuckle .
John grinned back at him over his shoulder, unbuttoning his shirt. "I agree, it does have a very nice ring to it." He opened his wardrobe and got out a plain blue button-up. "What's your opinion on that one?"
"Well, I have a strict no house parties while the parents are out until you're sixteen." Sherlock joked and chuckled, "But seriously, we were considering her staying alone at home sometimes and perhaps going out alone as well, although.. I still think the latter is too dangerous with how things are."
"Tell me what?" Charlie asked. Sherlock wouldn't smirk if John was gonna say no, right? They wouldn't let her show them the whole presentation just for nothing, right? Right?? "Right, I think I'll tell her so I get to be the one who says yes first once in a while" He said with a chuckle and Charlie beamed. "So I get to change to Ron's school?"
"Yeah I... Guess." Sherlock said and sighed, "Is it weird for you if I'd like to become friends with Lowell? I mean.. I don't know.. we would be talking a lot about Victor.. so.. I don't know how you'd feel about it."
Helping Charlie to sit up, Sherlock shuffled a bit on the bed so he could hold her steady in a sitting position while she was drinking, "I do wonder why you two are sick so often, though.. that seems weird." he said, thinking that it was alright to talk openly about this in front of Charlie as she did appreciate truth much more than sugar-coated words. "Maybe Paul should do a few tests.." he said and shrugged, "It can't really be serious, but it'd still be more comfortable for you two if you wouldn't catch the flu every few weeks."
"Yep." Sherlock said and laughed at her reaction, "Now if you find hearing about it shocking, imagine to stand there with him, introducing him to a colleague of yours and they suddenly start flirting like hormone controlled teens." he said and shook his head. "Though I must say that his taste could be worse." he said and frowned, "Do you have a photo of Greg?" he asked, looking at Janine.
“So you came out,” Jo said, because, really, it wasn’t a hard deduction at all.
“They’re old,” Lestrade pointed out.
“No work today?” Lestrade took the chance to ask her.
First, he told Gregson. To check. To make sure that it was fine, and wasn’t overstepping any kind of boundary in the context of an investigation, albeit a closed one. Just to be extremely sure – the reputation of the whole police force was at stake, after all. He even hoped for a screaming fit from his boss, however scary those were.
“And he had no idea?”
“We did,” Jo replied, without even lifting her eyes from her phone.
“I always liked kids,” he began, then felt holy terror rise in his chest, because kids didn’t sound like a first date topic. “...but Sophie and I had none. I always took my nephew and nieces to the zoo, when they were younger, because I loved it when I was a child.”
“Then why’d you say that?” Sherlock admonished her. “You’ve been reading them until late.”
“Yes, we get that a lot,” she replied. She was smiling, so Lestrade knew it hadn’t been a faux-pas.
“I don’t give a crap about contemporary French theatre and you know that,” she interrupted her. “I should have told you straight away – that I… all my life, since high school, I’ve refused to hide, Sherlock. Even when lying would’ve helped – at school, or in the army.”
“Sherlock told you?” He felt the urgent need to run a hand through his hair, which was almost completely grey; his mother said it suited him. “It went well. At a café. We’re doing it again.”
“No,” she said quietly. “I should’ve known this was too much to ask.”
“Whoever it was, an old woman’s still dead,” Lestrade reminded her, trying to think about what Joanna would’ve said.
“What?” he said. “Don’t you have her car?”
Two hours later, the first reports filed, Gregson placated, the architect jailed, he left Scotland Yard to find a black car parked right in front of the entrance. Agamemnon held the door open for him. “My boss has cooked ratatouille, monsieur,” the handsome man said, as he drove through the traffic to somewhere outside of town, which turned out to be an honest to God mansion.
Lestrade found that his mouth had done the thing it did when he knew he had to say something, but he really didn’t want to – which was his greatest fear every time he had to announce someone’s death to their immediate family, which was an unfortunately common occurrence, given the nature of his job. He ransacked his pocket looking for anything that could keep his hands busy.
“So, South East Asia. Lovely in the dry season,” Sherlock said.
“We’ll go there,” Sherlock said, “as a couple, and…”
“That’s how he bought his car?” Michael asked, in disbelief.
“Mr Brown from downstairs,” Parris said, “he is such a dear, always drives my mum to doctor’s appointments, and she does his laundry and irons his clothes.”
As they worked, they bickered – about the milk, the experiments Sherlock left lying around, the microscope she didn’t quite treat with care. At a slower pace than usual, but they bickered. “Thank God you don’t do that with the violin,” Lestrade heard Jo say.
“I don’t think they do it for free stuff!” Jo snapped back. Which surprised Lestrade, because he’d never heard her snap at anyone, not even Sherlock, and that was saying a lot.
“...to know that your dad, obviously, dealt with the stolen car parts…”
“Nonsense,” the employer replied, “it is a pleasure for us to have representatives of our police force, at such an important event…”
“Any news?” Robert asked him straight away. “Has it been finalized yet?”
There was a hidden ladder, leading to some kind of crawl space, in the ceiling. It was Joanna who found it. “I lived on the top floor too,” she said to justify herself, which was something she did quite often. The space above was tight, dark, and smelled foul; nonetheless, someone was going to be reprimanded by Gregson for negligence – overlooking something like that was not exactly a small mistake.
“You left home when you were twenty-two,” Sherlock said, a bit more bluntly than Lestrade would have. “Why?”
“I promise she’s never told me anything about it,” Lestrade said, even though it wasn’t exactly true.
Sherlock thought that it didn’t really make sense for them to sleep like this, hugging each other even though they were mad at each other, or at least Joanna was mad at her – Sherlock was mad at herself, too. She didn’t even try to close her eyes.
Afterwards, she didn’t sleep – she stared at the ceiling for a while, straightened her legs on the sofa at some point, looked at the light that came in through the blinds, until it became way too bright to still be night. A couple of times the air became thicker, and she didn’t quite dream, but definitely did something similar. She saw the familiar glow of brown hair in the sun, the shape of the ears of the dog that had bitten her ankle that mild early spring day.
“Traffic,” the doctor said, then smiled, as if she was trying to justify something.
“He or she – he, I think, despite the height – climbed down from the attic during the night,” Sherlock was saying. “Joanna, be a dear, move that chair over here. Like this.”
“Jo?”
, to be perfectly honest. They hadn’t kicker her out, or chased her with a shovel, the way Victoria’s father had, or the way some of the Irregulars’ parents had. They hadn’t hit her or called her names or anything, and they’d never done that on any other occasion. They were in fact pretty normal people, just not very loving. Everyone seemed to want to find something truly awful in Sherlock Holmes’s past, some great big trauma to justify the person she was. The truth was that there had been no such thing: they might not have been very loving, but nothing had, strictly speaking, happened. Actually, that was exactly the point.
“Who’s going to be your plus one? You’re not getting back with Sophie by next week.”
“This is Sherlock Holmes? The famous consulting detective? The genius that other dyke writes about?” He spoke as if he had a large audience in front of him. “Because I know what you two are, you little…”
“But she bought the tickets like, forever ago, because she loves Racine,” Joanna continued, then smiled. And then a truly wonderful thing happened – Sherlock looked at her, and then she smiled, too, and something in her face mellowed, that Lestrade couldn’t quite identify.
“Your friend, the consulting detective, and her girlfriend! They are lovely together. How times have changed, and for the better!” Margaret added, before brushing her teeth and retiring to Lestrade’s bedroom, as he took one more blanket to the sofa, where he’d be sleeping during his mother’s stay, since he didn’t have a guest room.
“What did you do?” Lestrade said, closing his mouth, fixing his tie.
“But…”
“So,” Joanna breached the subject first, or maybe she just said it to break the silence. Lestrade felt the urgent need to stick his foot in his mouth anyway.
– had come out of her mouth for possibly the first time since Lestrade had met her, seven years ago, when she was a recent Natural Sciences dropout with too much money and no perspectives whatsoever.
“Ex wife,” Lestrade replied, joining his hands on the table as if he was praying.
Lestrade’s shift was almost over – it was five minutes to five. His phone let out a single beeping sound, which was something it didn’t do as often as it once had, before the divorce. He picked it up without even thinking, expecting a text from his brother, a photo of the kids, maybe.
“I do. Did. But it still wasn’t nice to say it out loud,” Joanna replied. Her posture was defensive, no doubt a parting gift from the Army, and her eyes cold, and unreadable, which scared Sherlock.
“We’ll look for him, tomorrow,” he told her.
“You came for a case,” she stated.
“Yes,” came from between Sherlock’s knees.
“Well, since Donovan has that terrible boyfriend, and she got her own invite, anyway, she must have, or it would be a scandal, she was much more useful than you, on that case…”
. That was not going the way the Detective Inspector had imagined.
“Oh no,” Sherlock said, “what time is it?”
“It’s not a secret,” Mycroft stated, “although she doesn’t exactly publicize it, now that she’s famous.” And, Lestrade thought, it wasn’t a very well kept one, to be honest, thinking about it.
“...which means that f I lost you…”
The cab left them right in front of the entrance, so he paid and his mother thanked the driver no less than five times, and then she took his arm and they walked to the door, with a certain gravitas, Lestrade thought, as if they were entering a temple, the society of London’s strangest, and then his heart almost skipped a beat: Mycroft Lestrade was standing on the pavement, in a black suit and pumps, holding a black umbrella, a black bag slung over her right shoulder, and suddenly Lestrade could feel his back become a bit straighter, his head held a bit higher. He could feel that his mother felt it, too.
“Careful,” Joanna said.
It was her first year of uni and it felt like the world had finally taken a break from tormenting her.
“1958 at least,” Sherlock said.
“Yes,” he said, but he was faltering, “I believe that’s possible…”
It wasn’t a feeling she was very used to.
Still, his mother was alive and lived was a rather fancy estate – as he forced himself to remember as they entered – nothing like the one they were currently in: the tiled floor was a different colour from the one it had started out as, as highlighted by the few stops where the original shade still managed to emerge. It had no lift, just a narrow set of stairs with low hand railings, that Louisa Parris must have climbed every day, to go to the bakery or to the supermarket. The walls had to be thin, because he could hear at least two different small children cry their lungs out.
“You seem like a good man,” Mycroft was concluding.
“Maybe,” Sherlock interrupted her.
“It was worth it, in the end,” Lestrade replied from the backseat, the letters safe inside the blanket in a grocery bag they’d found in the boot.
“We received a formal invite,” his superior informed him instead, after he’d performed the customary bow upon entering his office and explained the situation as well as he could. Lestrade wondered why, then, the employer had sent that fair youth to wait for him outside his workplace, to give him the tickets inside a blank envelope, like some kind of mob boss.
Detective Inspector Lestrade had always more or less subconsciously liked the doctor, with her diminutive figure and quiet presence, which could nonetheless become very imposing when the situation warranted it. For example, every time Sherlock was acting out, which was a much rarer occurrence now than it had been at first, or before Joanna Watson came along, anyway. She was a good influence on Sherlock, definitely, the Detective Inspector had thought early on.
Still, no one had ever seen her room from the inside, and she spent most of her time studying during the day and walking around the university during the night, only occasionally sleeping; until one morning in late March she inverted her schedule, for some reason she couldn’t really recall, they might have had to do with Mycroft. She had time to kill so she went for a walk at one park she often visited at night. The French bulldog bit her ankle, the dog’s owner smiled at her, and one hour later they had become friends.
“The case is closed,” he said in the end, “and we’ll be there officially, as representatives of the whole police force. And Gregson says it’s fine, anyway.”
“If you still don’t get it, I don’t know what to tell you,” Joanna replied. She could her from her tone that she’d lost her patience and she was at a loss.
“His mother, I’m afraid,” his mother replied, smiling wide.
“Guess I’ll ask Mycroft,” she replied.
“What did your dad say?”
he replied without thinking, then damned himself.
Every single time it had happened – every single other time, she’d been concerned about her own interest: her own life, at the pool, her own respiratory system, when it had been on the brink of failing her, her own job and source of livelihood, both financial and emotional. But today, it had been about the doctor, and the doctor alone: the way she’d supported her head, checked for wounds in Joanna’s dishwater blonde hair; the way those words –
They kept Joanna for the night – and Sherlock curled up in an armchair next to her, in a suspiciously nice room, in a suspiciously nice wing, that Mycroft was no doubt responsible for.
He figured that he probably should have come alone anyway – he couldn’t exactly hand her the ticket in front of Anderson, who had worked on the case, too, even though he hadn’t exactly elicited the fair youth’s employer’s sympathies, with his snarky comments about contemporary theatre, that Lestrade only silently related to. He decided to do it before mentioning the case, hoping to downplay the effect the invite had had – on him, at least.
“How is she?” Lestrade asked, politely, as soon as the consulting detective arrived from the cab parked outside, making her way through the police tape with her usual confidence.
“I can drive you there,” Lestrade said, partly because he felt the need to leave the premise for a bit, but also because he still wanted to know whether Sherlock would invite her sister as a plus one.
“I burned the bloody pages – and made sure she deleted them from her computer as well.”
Once again proving that something extraordinary was going on, Sherlock didn’t say anything else. Lestrade drove in silence another five minutes, mostly spent waiting in traffic.
Sherlock breathed in the cold December air – she didn’t confirm or deny Joanna’s claim. She stretched her neck, studied the Christmas decorations in the streets as an excuse, the wrapped gifts and comets and gingerbread men and all the stuff they’d hung to the cables they’d set up at the end of November.
Lestrade’s assigned partner was Anderson – not like he didn’t like Anderson; he was just a bit difficult to share an enclosed space with. The car ride was uncomfortably silent. The estate was large, old and poorly maintained, and it made Lestrade sad, like most cases involving the elderly. They reminded him of his old mother, who’d sold the family house in favour of a small flat after both of her sons had moved away and Mr Lestrade had died. She spent her days decorating it and crocheting and knitting and baking French bread, and generally trying to keep the vaguely French spirit alive – despite the fact that she herself was not French, and had no connection to France whatsoever other than through her dead husband. Lestrade tried to visit her as often as he could, and even though the occasions had multiplied since his divorce, she still lived pretty far away in the South, and she sometimes became a talking and walking reminder of his failed marriage. And even the walking part wasn’t to be taken for granted, nowadays.
Sherlock was already at the Yard, when they came back with the newly arrested son. Joanna was with her; they were both drinking coffee, standing in front of his office, way past the point where civilians were usually stopped. “Sorry about your date,” Joanna told him, and Lestrade had to accept the fact that his relationship troubles were way harder to hide from them now.
