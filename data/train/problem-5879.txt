Then, he narrows his eyes to see what looks exactly like a bomb, the liquid of chemicals going exactly to it, which Tony knows that it can cause a chain reaction and powered the bomb. Yet, Steve is so close to it.
After the battle, he was taken to a hospital. He doesn’t remember much of it, he has no idea how he got there, he just remembers being taken on a stretcher through the halls of the hospital, everything passing so fast around him, everything was a blur. He doesn’t remember when he fainted. Or better said, when he fell in a comatose state.
Nevertheless, Steve doesn't feel convinced. Of course, there is something bothering him. So, Steve slides in the bed sitting by his side. The blond was a little taller than him, which oblige Tony to raise his gaze to find Steve's marvelous blue eyes.
God, he loved that laughter. He wasn't used to hearing it, Steve looked more relaxed than he already has seen it. It didn't matter that they were trapped in 1970, they were together and that' was enough. They would be fine, Tony knew it from the bottom of his heart. Everything would be fine as long as they stayed together.
His life wasn’t the same, and it would never be again. He knew it before he enlisted, but he insisted. He had seen what the military made to Bucky, and he insisted because he wanted to serve his country more than anything, he wanted to do it as his father once did. Perhaps, all of it happened because Steve always had had this faith in people. In individuals. He didn’t regret it, though, but he wished it was easier to cope with.
There's no way out. Tony knows that when the five guys cornered him and a foot hit him on the ribs, making him gasp for air feeling the pain spreads on his abdomen. Before he could catch his breath another kick hit his back. He wouldn't beg, he's Tony Stark, after all, he couldn't fight five guys with his own fist at once, he was highly outnumbered and these guys are such a coward.
Hank looks back to see who Tony is pointing, he frowns a little confused but quickly recovers his wise countenance.
“Huh, yes,” Steve replied. Then, he extended his hand to her. “I’m Steve Rogers.” The girl retributes the handshake.
The aid kit was on Tony's bed, of course, Steve would need to change the bandages before they go. Although Tony did not like the idea of Steve coming with him, he was still recovering from the bullet wound, but Tony knew very well that the supersoldier was as stubborn as himself, so Steve wasn't changing his mind.
The blond looks at his boyfriend. Boyfriend? Was that the right term? Steve wasn’t sure if he could call Tony that.
After a few minutes walking around the shop and some clothes hanging on his arm, Steve glances at Tony who seems to have difficulting find clothes to himself, the blond understand the feeling, the stamps in the 70s were too flamboyant, and the colors too bright. Kind of unusual to someone like Tony who is the most part of time wearing expensive suits, generally, in the same colors, dark blue, black, white, and grey, those colors composed Tony Stark's wardrobe.
"We can't go to the apartment," Steve says, opening his eyes. Tony feels his gaze on him. "They know about it, they've been following us for days."
"I found something, and I'd like to share it with you." She replies, by the confused looks she received, she added. "It's about Steve and Tony."
“I’m sure she will,” Bucky always tries to cheer Steve up. Sometimes, it worked, others didn't. Today was not one of them.
"Our first night here you said we'd do this together right?" Steve nods. "So we'll do this together too."
It might not be what y'all expected. Share your thoughts on the comments, I'd love to know what you think about this chapter, and please, do not hate me.
Pym Technologies seems unusually crowded today, and Tony notices it from the hall, some workers were decorating the place, which makes Tony thinks that maybe they would be celebrating soon, or it also could be an event to inform and update their interns about the newest techs that were presented in the congress Hank Pym attended.
As usual, sleeping didn’t go okay. Steve woke up hours late shaking and covered in sweat. He reached out for the glass of water on the nightstand, bringing it to his lips. However, he can’t keep himself steady enough for the task and the glass shakes against his teeth as he felt the cool water going down his dry mouth, at the same time undoing the thick lump formed in his throat. It’s relieving, but not enough to drag Steve back to sleep. It never is, and never will be.  The soldier puts the glass back and takes his phone, lightening the darkroom. The sudden glow makes Steve shield his eyes for a moment, blinking before adjusting to it.
What came next caught him totally off the guard, and also unpredictable, when Peggy tiptoed to reach his lips and kissed him. The odds were definitely against Steve because that was the exact moment that Tony chose to get out of Hank's lab and get a full sight of Steve and Peggy kissing, the blond took a step back and look to Tony.
Steve stepped into the office as Natasha told him. The office was bigger than Steve thought it was from the outside. It has a nice view of Manhattan below them. The sun hit the Empire State Building far away, giving it an angelical and glorious light. Steve appreciated those little details, how the light angle could change the perspective of something, and make it look better. He hardly would define Manhattan in this way, if he could pick a word to describe the noisy city below, he would choose gray. All those buildings and skyscrapers reflecting the light on their own mirrors never allow any colors to contract against them. Graceless. Gray. The head of marketing closed the door on his back, bringing Steve back to reality, and he almost wanted to curse himself for wandering in his thoughts, sometimes he was too absent-minded. Natasha walked around her desk to sit down. Steve followed the moves and sat in one of the chairs in front of her.
Steve waved goodbye to the members of the team going out for lunch until there were just him and Wanda in the studio. Even though the red-haired had turned off the lights, the window allowed a good illumination for them to organize the stuff. Wanda waited patiently for Steve as he got to clean the lens he would use later.
"Yes. Sure, he must've mentioned it." The soldier waved off while putting his hands inside of the pants' pockets. "Do you have an idea when he'll be back?" Stark nods negatively, he seems a little suspicious.
"Yes. They-they exist. Seems impossible, but they do," Steve leaned against a washing machine while crossed his arms in front of his chest. "One of them, Thanos. He snapped 50% of humanity in 2019, he said he wanted a better world, a perfectly balanced world. We couldn't stop him on time." Sadness was showing up on his face. "Only now, we found a way to reverse it, maybe." He shrugged. "Tony was the one who built a... Time machine? So we could restore the Infinity stones before Thanos. I-I know this a mess, Peggy, it's insane. I know what it must seem to you, I can't force you to believe me, but... That's the truth."
Steve put on the helmet, mounting on the motorcycle, one of the things he actually owned nowadays. That motorcycle was with him since he enlisted in the Army, and Steve thought that, maybe, he would never get rid of it. That piece of metal carried so many, good and bad, memories, it had accompanied him during all his five years in the Army. Bucky’s used to saying that Steve is sentimental with things, and he wasn’t wrong at all.
, Tony thought. Then, he crosses the street, this time looking attentively to both sides, but Steve stays where he is, so Tony turns on his heels from the other side staring curiously to the soldier. "Aren't you coming?" He asks nodding in the direction of the base. The soldier didn't answer but followed him.
"Did you know that the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl crossed the Atlantic on a raft in 57 days?" Steve says while pointing the news on the paper, he's trying to make conversation, so Tony nods negatively before start to serve himself while Steve follows him doing the same.
Tony tiptoes and kisses the super soldier’s lips. Steve tights the grip on his husband’s waist and deeps the kiss. A slow song starts to play in the background and Steve moves away just a little while Tony catches his breath.
Tony blinks, unable to turn his gaze to where the light comes, the philanthropist raises his arm to block the light from his camp of sight, on the other hand, Steve's eyes quickly adjusted to the light, and he spots two police officers, the first holding the flashlight is short and overweight, the second seems pretty young and apparently, new and unfamiliar to his jobs duties.
He remembers walking close to the mountains, taking the cave for shelter for their long walk under the cruel, burning sun. Drink some water. Listen to Falsworth and Jones joking as usual as Dugan checked his rifle. Bucky came to his side, punching him lightly on the arm.
“The perfect ring,” Bucky replied to his question, dragging Steve out of his reveries. Steve nodded in knowledge.
Steve carried Tony to the large bed in the room, placing the Omega on it carefully almost as if Tony was too fragile and could break if he put too much strength. Steve peppers kiss on Tony’s beautiful face, making him feel loved, then kissing his jawline and rubbing his lips on Tony’s mark, which sends shivers all over the Omega’s body.
Steve took a deep breath and before he could mount on the bike and go away, he stepped inside. The smoke almost stopped Steve from seeing ahead, in a corner, he could smell the weed, which made him twitch his nose to the unpleasant scent. The lights blinked incessantly in different colors, and the music was definitely louder than ever. Steve couldn’t understand how someone could spend their night in a place like it. He was ready to walk away, and find an excuse for his absence when he bumped onto Wanda tomorrow when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Steve turned around to face Wanda’s twin, Pietro from finances.
The man's eyes widened surprised and in horror when the blood starts to wet his shirt, Tony pushes him up taking the weight out of him while the man grunts on the floor, incapable of moving and probably dead in a few minutes.
Steve lifted up his head suddenly, staring at Tony, who seemed a little surprised by his sudden movement. Since they started to hang out together, Tony had never mentioned his parents, he barely spoke about his past. Steve could never judge him, however, since the soldier, himself, had never spoken about his parents, his childhood, and his time in the army. So, he could not ask Tony what he wasn’t willing to give either, but now that Tony started talking, Steve felt like he needed to open up with the man, too.
They led Peggy to the laundromat, at least there they are sure that no one would see or even hear them. Steve moves his hands nervously, clenching them against each other, he took out the cap and looks to Peggy who had leaned against a washing machine, her arms firmly crossed. Tony puts the briefcase aside and goes to the place where they hid the clothes yesterday, he found an empty and dusty bag in the corner of the room and put the clothes inside, zipping it with an annoying noise. No one talks in the room while Steve observes Tony, he can say that the philanthropist is upset, even though he tries to hide it without direct his gaze to Steve. The blond just wanted to fix the mess he'd made, explain to the billionaire what happened, even knowing that he didn't owe any explanation.
“Okay,” Steve said. “By Maria, do you mean Maria Hill?” Steve couldn’t hold his curiosity, watching Natasha’s features afraid of having crossed a line, but she only raised a questioning brow.
The laundromat is empty just like when they first got in there, the wash machines working at full, at least, the noise would drown out the conversation.
Tony Stark. Tony Stark. The name sounded familiar, maybe he had heard it somewhere. Well, if they were counting on Stark for the next campaign, then he should be someone important. Why did he feel like he should know this name? S-T-A-R-K. Maybe he heard on the news, Steve wasn’t sure. He tried to bring out the memory but his mind came back empty. He makes a mental note to google the name after his meeting with Natasha.
Sleeping wasn’t really easy for any of them. Sleeping lets them vulnerable in the field. Although, a soldier’s brain never shut down completely. Their eyes can be closed, but their bodies are well aware of everything that is happening in their surroundings. For most soldiers, if not all of them, nightmares were a real thing. Memories of their battles come at the silence of their mind at night to torment them, as well as missions that could go wrong and end up in fatal outcomes. Steve wasn’t immune from them, nor was Bucky.
They came trading Tony's expensive watch, even though Steve had said to the brunet do not do that, they'll find a solution for the money problem. But Tony rolled his eyes saying that he is not the kind attached to things, they needed the money and with that watch, they could survive for months. So, Steve agreed. Now, that Pym would be back in one week and a half, they would really need money, they needed to get to San Francisco and settle in as soon as possible.
"Tony?" The genius runs closer to the stretcher that Steve was tied. He looked fine, he did not have the IV tube in his veins anymore, he was just left here tied. Steve looked tired, like Tony has never seen before, not even in the battle in New York or Sokovia.
Tony goes to the kitchen to take what is missing, and he sees a folder on the countertop. He furrows, sure that it wasn't there when he left yesterday. Tony approaches it, checking the note left on the folder, "this is not over" it says, and Tony knows for sure that it is Hydra.
Apparently, the congress that Hank Pym was invited was a global one, according to the invitation, scientists from all over the world were invited to present their projects and ideas in a one-month event, which means that was a huge event, and they would take, at least, two more weeks to going back, since Hank left two weeks ago, and they were almost half one week. Tony sighed heavily.
He decides to start making lunch without Steve, he is not going to blow up the apartment, he is sure of that. In fact, he does not blow things up quite a while now, he smiles at the thought while some improvement ideas to the Iron Man armor runs through his mind.
"No. I'd get supplies in the morning, but then you arrived and we got distracted with this," Steve replied folding the floor plan. "There is a grocery store down the avenue."
Tony sighs, he regrets it too. He regretted more things than he should and he didn't want that Steve was consumed by this feeling as well. They could've done differently, they can do different now. Beginning by forgiving each other.
"I know it's a lot," Tony says. "I think they might've considered you because of the serum. Technically, you're already enhanced, they just need to clone you." There's a bit of worry on his voice.
"HYDRA's director, I think. Thomas Pierce." The brunet shrugs nonchalantly. Steve raises a brow, surprised.
"We need to go back to the base," Tony speaks suddenly. He looks up to Steve. "We need to get our stuff back... Uh... I mean our clothes." He was on the edge of breakdown again, he was already hyperventilating, this whole situation surely got in his neves.
Steve sits upright staring deeply into Tony's brown almonds eyes. The soldier sighs and Tony feels frustrated, he can't have another breakdown in front of Steve, so he shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath, he only opens his again when he felt Steve's thumb caressing his wrist. It's a gentle and relaxing touch and it gives courage to Tony lifts his gaze to that pair of blue eyes.
"It's a cute movie. I like it. I guess you won't be able to tell me your opinion since you didn't stop staring at me the whole movie. You were almost drooling." Tony said smirking sassily. Steve frowns, but eventually, he rolled his eyes, impossible to hold his smile for longer
“Is everything okay?” Steve nodded, realizing that even though the woman scares him, he should be able to answer her with his own words.
When Tony got out of the bath, he was fully dressed. Steve wasn't in the room anymore, which means that he was probably waiting for him downstairs. Tony takes the intelligent glasses on the nightstand and puts them on, also grabbing the lab coat he was wearing yesterday, with so much happening at once, they had forgotten to collect their clothes in the army base laundromat, now they must come back for collecting them and also learning more about Hank Pym whereabouts, in order to take the stones to 2023.
English and French are not my native language. I've been studying English for 7 years, and French for 4 years now.
“Man, thank God you finally answered. I need your help, it’s kind of urgent, and you are the only one that can save us. Seriously, you’re my only hope,” Sam practically spits out. Steve grimaced, confused.
Tony gets up, takes the syringe with him, and runs toward Steve who is still fighting the agent. The man didn't expect Tony to attack him from behind with a syringe on his neck. The man stumbles and falls beside the other agent, both unconscious.
He wasn’t happy at all, not with that Alpha sniffing his Omega. Not when he was so close to Tony’s neck, and the Omega is three days away from his heat, drawing more attention from the Alphas in his surrounding. All Steve wanted was to smash that Alpha ugly face. The man laughs again, leaning on Tony and the Omega laughs politely.
He wanted to take down Hydra as much as Steve, but they can't do it now. They had a mission, take the tesseract, and go back to 2023. Bring half of the universe back was their priority now, they can't lose focus, Steve knows it.
“Just one,” Wanda insisted, although Carol never moved away from the counter, waiting for Steve’s answer.
Tony joins the right elements, trusting his vision and experience to make sure he's putting the correct quantity, to the bomb gets the exact reaction he's expecting. This is their way out.
“Hey, Capsicle.” Steve stood by his side. Clint and Wanda both hold a glass of champagne and smile at the couple.
"You filthy faggot!" The guy spits on Tony's direction before raising his fist and throwing a punch that Tony blocked easily since the guy could barely stay stand on his own feet. The guy stumbles with an evil smile on his face.
It is a quick going to the grocery store that surprisingly is empty this morning, Tony thanks God for it, the last he went there he waited fifteen minutes in the queue, and Tony really hates to wait, although he does not care to let his place waiting for him. Tony gets what they need, checking his mental list to make sure he got everything, he pays for the products and heads back to the apartment.
Tony was tapping his finger on the edge of the table anxiously while looking out of the window uninterested, they haven't talked about what happened in the alley, about the kiss nor the fact that two guys were following him and one of them just said Hail Hydra before killing himself. This event brings out another memory from the past, the one right post-serum, when a man killed Erskine, ran away with a sample, he caught the guy and those are exactly his last words.
“Do you want to come over for dinner?” He blurted out. Tony shifted to look at him. “I mean if you want to. It’s nothing big. My friend Peggy, she’s going to marry my best friend, Bucky. Uh. We always have dinner together on Thanksgiving, so… I can pick you up if you want to.”
Tony nods still feeling the thick lump of his throat, his mouth dry with angst. He tries to convince himself that Steve was right, they did what had to, HYDRA was a bad organization after all. Steve has been frozen seventy years ago trying to defeat them. His parents were killed because HYDRA had brainwashed and made Bucky Barnes a weapon, they created Project Insight and they were willing to kill thousands of innocent people. Steve is right.
Steve turns his body to face Tony's back and realizes that Tony's sleep seems a little tormented, he was shaking a bit and mumbling something incomprehensible. Steve didn't know if he should wake him up, he probably should, because he doesn't like seeing Tony suffering this way and not doing anything.
Tony's eyes snap back to the TV. Images of the burnt warehouse were showing, in the corner of it, there was a photo of the supposed director of the company. Tony rolls his eyes. Then the journalist appears back on the screen. Tony looks down, stirring his hands nervously.
They stayed quiet for a couple of minutes before Tony decides to get rid of the heavy burden inside his chest, he needed to tell it to someone, let the words flow out loud.
"No need to apologize. You two have been under too much pressure lately." Peggy says calmly. "Is there something I can do to help you?"
After Steve had uploaded the photos to the company’s laptop, he was free to go. Wanda left earlier probably with Pietro, but Steve still had the address to the ‘party’, so he would just show up, say hello, get something, then go back home. The soldier wasn’t too fond of parties.
He feels Steve's head fell down on his back, the soldier's hands supporting him on the wall beside Tony's own. So, thankful, he is not putting his weight on the brunet's back.
Tony stopped suddenly, stumbling and hitting one of the cups against the kitchen counter. Pieces of the blue cup fell all over the place.
Wanda rolled her eyes, then raised her hand up, where Steve could see a beautiful, probably expensive, ring.
“It’s late,” whispers Steve while burying his face on the curve of the brunette’s neck. Tony closes his eyes, leaning his head back to the blond’s shoulder. He loves feeling Steve’s arms around him, that was definitely his favorite place in the world, no doubts.
“I believe you have some documents for me,” Natasha said, organizing the paper on her desk and clipping them together. Steve handed her the folder in his hands, which Natasha flipped through. “I’ll give it to Maria after I finish showing you the studio.”
Then Steve drops a kiss on his shoulder before trailed kisses down his back. Tony feels Steve thrust uncertain and he knows that he's close. Steve thrust two more times before comes inside Tony. The brunet feels the hot seed fills him for a while, that's Steve way of marking him as his and Tony just loves it. He feels Steve pulling out and the seed sliding out of his hole making a trail to his thighs.
Steve had lied. The grocery store stayed way more distant than he said, surprisingly it wasn't crowded when they get in. It was a small place with apparently all sorts of food and brands. Tony carries a basket while Steve takes what they need along the aisles.
"I know. I feel like if-if you die, that's on me." Steve reaches for another spoon of vanilla ice cream.
Tony and Steve look around the laundromat, the wash machines working in a unison and noise sound. It was dark there, but some flashes of morning light bathed the place, in the deep part of the laundromat they could see some dry clothes hanging in there.
Steve is rubbing his pulses. Tony notices the red skin from where his arms were tied, he knows that Steve heals fast so the marks will be already gone when they reach the apartment, nothing to worry about. His eyes sweep the room, He gets a blood sample with Steve's name on it, discreetly he sneaks the sample inside of his pocket. He notices how many chemicals are in there. Tony's hands start to work fast, catching the products while he also reads some labels.
Alright. Perhaps, Steve had borrowed her the book and she never had the time to read it nor give it back to its owner. It happens a lot with her. However, she frowns when she sees the year besides the name. 1984, that's not possible. S.H.I.E.L.D. had found Captain America in the ice in 2011, this book could not be Steve's, someone was certainly playing a prank on her.
Tony feels his body freeze, he knows that this is a terrible moment to have an anxiety attack, but he can't stop it. Steve cups his cheek with his good arm, his hand dirt with his own blood.
Steve grins. A smile that makes Tony's heart melt and he can't believe that once he wanted to punch those perfect white and shining teeth.
Steve enters his not so neat, tidy room. He didn’t have much stuff, though. There was only a small closet, a nightstand where he keeps a lamp, a book, and a glass of water. He also has a shelf with books, Steve loves to read, but the most important thing to him was close to his small window with a fire escape where a glass filled with cheap brushes is along with the still closed inks spread all over the floor, and a blank canvas looking back at him every day. Steve painted since he was a child, he loved it, but a poor kid from Brooklyn couldn’t hold all his future in being an artist, instead, Steve got a student loan and coursed Photography at the Pratt Institute. He must have been a photographer for two years after his undergraduate before he decided to join the military at the age of 24.
Steve observes how the rays of the sun give Tony's tan skin a beautiful light. His eyes looking over the horizon, his defined profile.
“He put something in your drink,” Tony looked up to meet Steve’s eyes. “My guess is that was some kind of drug to induce heat,” Steve concluded. Tony whimpered, putting one of his hands on his lower belly. “I've got you, doll,” Steve leaned in to plant a kiss on Tony’s forehead, Tony buried his face in Steve’s chest, blushing furiously when he feels slick pooling between his thighs.
"Or you could've just kissed me like you did earlier, then you would figure it out." Tony retorts with a sassy smirk on his lips. Steve furrowed and narrowed his eyes, but he ends up smiling too and leaning to find Tony's lips once again. After they parted, Tony stares deeply in those blue eyes. "I love you, too." He leaves these words to fill the silence between them. Tony always has been scared of saying those words out loud, everyone that he cares, ended up leaving him, and each departure hurt more than the last one. He didn't want Steve to leave him too, but he hadn't realized that not saying it was keeping him away from achieving his own happiness, from Steve, until now.
His eyes fell on the red-haired, it was her. Natasha Romanoff. The woman Bucky told him about, the one he had given Steve’s number for a job opportunity. Steve aligned himself to take the pictures, the flash lightning the group’s face and making Natasha’s hair burn red on the pic.
So, they cross the street walking peacefully in the pickup's direction, when they reach it Tony takes control of the situation unlocking the car's door fast like he had already done something like this a lot of times. Steve gets on the car, and Tony is already connecting the wires to make the car works. Steve observes the street through the rearview rubbing his hands nervously.
They lived downtown, so the street was crowded with people enjoying this amazing night. Couples kissing, or sat on a table drinking, young people listening to some music out loud on their car while drink with friends, families eating in a pizzeria, and laughing. It all seemed so unreal, but at the same he knew he was living in it. Steve's tip fingers touching his smoothly and discreetly, a smile playing on his lips, the blond was happy, and so was Tony. They couldn't hold hands in public, Tony needs to remember himself all the time that they were trapped in the 70s, but Tony promised to himself that once they get back to 2023, he would always hold Steve's hand in public, proudly.
Anyway, he couldn’t wait much longer. That was the first real job he was getting after being back from the Army. The first real interaction with people after six months of contact only with Bucky and Peggy, mostly. It was normal to be nervous to meet new people, he just couldn’t let it take over him. He was in the field again. A different, and less dangerous one, but it still had its battles to win.
“‘kay. Listen. There’s a huge event today, it’s beneficial to help war veterans. Anyway, the photographer Maria hired got sick. He can’t come, and you’re the only person I can think of, plus your pics are better, so, could you come over, replace him, and save this whole event?” Steve wanted to laugh at the tone Sam used, pleading with him to save them all.
Tony wants to comfort the blond, hugs him, kisses him endless times. Tells him that he always had his heart. Oh God, they were such fools. They've been playing around all this time, when they could've been together a long time ago, if they only have admitted their feelings before, their hearts always belonged to each other.
“I’m sorry, Peps, we are coming down in a few minutes.” Pepper nods and rolls her eyes, but she doesn’t say anything else before leaves the room.
Steve raises his head and fins Tony's brown almond eyes, he stares for a long time before sighs again. He doesn't reply to his question, and Tony also doesn't push him, instead, they eat in silence, the only sound in the place comes from an old radio on the counter.
“I know, but I do mind,” Steve turned the tap on, and the water fell on the dirty plates in the sink. “I have an interview tomorrow. Whatever it will be, I don’t know, I’m going to job hunting again,” Steve rubbed the sponge on the white plates. He looked at Bucky leaned against the doorframe with his arms crossed on his chest. The dark-haired sighed.
When the soldier got home, he didn’t expect to see Bucky pacing back and forth in the middle of the room so late at night. Steve furrowed, and Bucky stopped at the sight of the blond, but he kept running his hands on the sides of his jeans.
Tony looks away, unable to face the red hair. Steve wasn't falling with him, the blond loved Peggy, he carries a picture of her wherever he goes, Steve wasn't... couldn't... Steve does everything right and Tony, Tony is a such a mess.
Steve pulls Tony with him for a building abandoned entry, away from the curious stares. He smashes his body against Tony's, the billionaire's back hitting the brick wall behind.
The guy let go of him, and Tony falls again, being insulted for who he is, for love Steve. Tears prickle on his eyes when another kick hit his stomach and Tony lay in the fetus position to protect himself of his attackers.
Tony spits the words so fast that Steve's ears are not so sure of what they just listened. That's awkward. Unexpect just like the kiss they shared. It sounded so right. Maybe, the timeline was affecting his mind, or whatever. Steve doesn't know what to say next, so he observes Tony for a few seconds, watching while the brunet's shoulder tenses up, his grip intensifies on the wheel and his breath becomes irregular. The words loosen in the air and none of them can react to the side effects those loud words cause in their heart.
"So, will anyone explain to me?" She asks with a remarkable British accent. Steve lets out a sigh, he has no idea from where he should begin. Peggy rests her stare over the blond. "You're not dead." She constates. "What the bloody hell is happened in that plane crash? I thought you were dead all of these years." She is pissed, oh, she is really pissed. She could even punch Steve on his perfects white teeth, but she wants an explanation first."
“Go to sleep or I’ll sell your toys,” said Tony closing the door behind. Outside, they could listen to Morgan’s giggles.
Maybe, he should just apologize and waits for Tony's reaction, yes, that's it. He glances at Tony, whose eyes are fixed on the road, his hand thickened on the wheel, the wind coming from the open window is messing his black hair and the sunlight of the sunset making his brunet skin glows, it is such a marvelous view. Steve smiles turning to look out of his window, he takes a deep breath.
"I know. I'm sorry." Steve feels the guilty clenching inside his chest. "I was selfish. I never meant to hurt you, Tony. I hate seeing you hurt." Steve regrets.
Bruce sighs hopelessly, making his way to the kitchen and prepare himself a tea. He raises a mug to Natasha with a lifted brow, a clear question behind his eyes asking her if she wants some tea, honestly, she wasn't the tea girl, right now, she'd rather a bottle of vodka or gin, that would be perfect to forget all this shitty world. She shakes her head negatively.
She doesn't remember this book at all. Natasha opens it to see a beautiful and artistic handwriting that she had already seen so many times.
Steve exhaled, slowly, then he inhaled, feeling the air filling his lungs until it ached inside his chest.
Then, Tony's mouth is on Steve's again. His tongue exploring every corner of the blond's mouth desperately. Steve lets out a moan.
The man on the floor groaned in pain behind them, their glance back while the man crawled out of the alley. Steve's hand now resting on Tony's waist. The billionaire frowned.
With the agent on top of him, Tony moves his knee up hitting him on the stomach, the man groans in pain and closes his hands around Tony's neck. Tony's eyes widened while he gasps for air, his hands moving on the floor looking for something, anything to hit the guy. Tony's hand closes around a piece of glass that cut his own palm, but he ignores the pain raising the glass and hitting the Hydra agent on the neck.
"Okay, then. I don't deserve you, you know that, right?" Tony says leaning to drop a kiss on those soft lips that only that supersoldier owned. Steve's lips curled up to the gest in an amused smirk before he looks at Tony in the eyes, getting all serious.
Guiltiness is eating him alive. He shouldn't have yelled with Tony, and now he can't sleep. The sight of Tony's body covered in bruises just makes him feel more guilty. He was nervous and angry at Tony for putting his life at risk, because he loves the brunet so much that he couldn't handle the mere thought of Tony being dead. Every time, every time, they were on a battlefield and Tony gets hurt or almost dead, Steve felt like his asthma came back, he just couldn't breathe anymore.
"Oh my God. You blushed again. I surely deserve a prize for making you blush." Steve says filling his mouth with some scrambled eggs. Tony sticks out his tongue, which just makes Steve laugh.
"Okay, lemme make it shorter, then." Tony interfered. "Capsicle here," He points to Steve. "Stay stuck in the ice for over 70 years, he was found and awaken in 2011, where he fought for SHIELD, joined the avengers when we fought aliens coming from outer space, a lot of others less important fights too, and here we are trying to defeat or stop, I don't even know anymore, another villain from outer space. But I fucked everything it up and we are trapped in the '70s.!" Tony let everything out at once and inhales deeply attempting to recover his breath.
"Steve. I-" Tony feels his cock throbbing. "I'm gonna cum." Steve takes Tony's deep in his throat, Tony's thrust and come inside of his mouth, Steve swallows the hot seed that the brunet slips out, licking his lips with satisfaction. "Damn it, Steve, where did you learn doing that?" Tony pants, the blond smiles gasping, his cheeks in a heat ton of red. Then, he drops a kiss on Tony's lips, his hands sliding on the side of the billionaire's body.
"I believe you, Tony, I trust you, if you said you didn't drink, then you didn't. Also, I gave you reasons to be mad at me."
car tank. There was an old lady reading the newspaper nonchalantly behind the counter, a fifteen years old teenager on the back of the store looked like nervous and was staring to a ginger guy who was checking CDs, three others teenagers were hiding, or stealing, products on their pockets, on Steve's left, a couple was discussing what beer brand they should buy for a party. Steve just caught a basket and put some bags of chips, bottles of water, soda cans, and other stuff they might need.
Tony doesn't answer. He hears footsteps outside and he imagines that those agents are not going to give up, they are willing to look in each lab and room if that means to find them.
"I'm going to get a washcloth to clean us up." Tony lets go of his arm with a sigh before crashing onto the bed one more time.
Then, a doctor came in to evaluate his state. A nurse checked his medication. In a few minutes, he was out of the nasal cannula, the doctor explaining everything that happened to him. Lately, Bruce visited him and explained how the reactor saved his life, but also what his body suffered for the amount of gamma radiation he absorbed. The scars, caused by the burnt of radiation effects, went all the way up from his right arm to his face.
Tony distracts himself from watching the movie over the kitchen counter, he lost complete track of time. Food is ready. He glances at the clock on the counter, an hour had passed, his eyes focus back on the TV to see the final credits.
Steve watched as the blonde walked away, stopping in front of the elevators’ door. Then, he drew his attention back to Natasha on the doorframe, her arms were crossed and she was leaning slightly on it. Pepper stepped into the elevator, and Natasha turned her head in Steve’s direction. The red-haired frowned and looked down at the watch on her wrist. It was an old gold watch, Steve noticed, probably an heirloom.
Tony was looking to the holograms on the table, he was working in a new project, a new compound for the avengers, even though he and Steve were retired, there were still the others, Wanda, Sam, Bucky and Peter, they were technically integrating the new avengers’ team. And Tony wanted to settle them in a new and comfortable place, alike to the old compound. He has been working hard on it, more than he actually should. According to the doctors he was still in recovery, but when Tony puts an idea in his head, he never can get rid of it, it has to be done, complete, so he can rest until he finds another crazy idea. For now, everything was perfect.
The door was locked, of course, but a simple door would not stop Tony Stark, right? So quickly he solved that problem, and once he was in, he started to look for the floor plan inside of the cabinets, drawers, archives. Then, in the last drawer of Hank's desk, he found a black folder, the cover is made of leather. Tony glances at the papers inside of it, till he found it. The floor plan in the middle of all those boring documents, that's the original one, from the 50s, with all the entries, underground levels, and hidden labs.
! Tony thought. He couldn't get rid of the idea that all of this was his fault. If he hadn't lost the tesseract, if Loki hadn't caught it, if he didn't have that stupid idea of going back in 1970, if... So many "ifs". He is always the one that screws up, he deserves all of this crap happening to him. Tony feels a lump growing in his throat.
When he finds Steve, he is going to buy all the pieces of apple pie he ever wanted, he is also going to give a huge tip to this girl.
Behind the counter, there was a man, he was short, had grey hair and a mustache, he wears a pair of big glasses, and his smile is welcoming. Tony approaches him and requests two rooms. The man seems a little bit disappointed for, probably, lost two customers.
Yet, Steve wasn’t sure where knowing all these things about Tony put him to. They've spent an amount of time together, but were they dating? Steve had absolutely no idea how to put it. He knows he should probably ask Tony, there was nothing wrong in asking, right?
"Tell me if I'm hurting you, right?" Steve says, a flash of concern crossing his eyes. He only goes ahead when Tony nods affirmatively.
Steve follows the brunet to the exit, he looks both sides before crossing the street, they haven't talked about the kiss yet, and Steve was starting to worry that maybe he had pushed too hard, the adrenaline rushing through his veins didn't make him thinking straight, maybe he went too far. He couldn't know none of this, he had to ask Tony about what happened, does that kiss mean something? He couldn't deny that he was afraid of knowing the answer. All of these thoughts were growing roots inside of his head, making him feel so insecure.
Steve pushes a Hydra agent against one of the desks in the lab. The man falls on it, breaking glasses filled with chemicals, spreading it all on the desk and the floor. Another man comes over Steve hitting him on the shoulder, right where the bullet wound is healing. Steve grunts in pain, quickly recovering himself and knock out the man.
"Who are you?" Steve stops beside Tony watching the guy. The man smirks mischievously and his eyes fall on Steve.
Since he came back from war, Steve carried that feeling of being lost. His therapist used to call it ‘survivor guilt’ for those who died in the field whilst he got to go back to his small family. He was allowed to be someone again. Though, the sensation of inadequacy kept hovering on him. Would he be able to have an ordinary conversation with someone again? Would he even be able to feel comfortable around someone again? Steve hoped so because he didn’t know what he would do if he didn’t.
"Come for me, Tony." And Steve doesn't need to say it again, when the brunet comes, his hot seed spreading on his and Steve's stomach. Tony feels his hole tightening around Steve after his release. "Hold on a sec, sweetheart," Steve says. Right, supersoldier. He thrusts twice more before he releases inside Tony. Steve leans dropping a soft kiss on the billionaire lips before slid out of him.
Steve walked towards the group of partnerships reunited in the garden, all of them had a glass of wine in their hands. Steve walked closer and closer to the light and stopped when he saw a profile. He had seen this same face today when he was searching about her on the Internet, that red hair was typical of her. What a director of marketing was doing here?
"What? That's..." Steve starts to say, but then he looks back to the papers on his hands, flipping through the pages.
Steve stopped, putting his hands on his knees to catch his breath, and he looked around. How much has he run? The sun is rising on the horizon. Hell! How long has he been running? Well, long enough the city starts to show signs of life again. People are starting to leave their homes to work out or get to work, cars are whirring in the streets, some kids are half-sleeping against the window of the bus. Steve ran back home.
Steve pushes the door and they are welcomed with the sunlight, Steve raises his arm to block his eyes from the sudden light and Tony closes his own. Fresh air invades his lungs, it is almost sweet. They hear sirens still far from here. Steve takes his arm from Tony's waist, taking his hand to his mouth while he coughs. Tony stays still, he opens his eyes to see smoke coming out of the building, a part of it on fire. Damn, they caused a big damage. They always cause a big damage, Tony corrects himself.
, Steve grits his teeth. Truth is when it comes to Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, Omega, and philanthropist, Steve is always overprotective, and perhaps, too possessive. Steve used to tell himself that that was alright, that it's only his Alpha instincts wanting to prevent his Omega from any harm that anyone could inflict him.
The ride to Brooklyn was quite calm. Steve had the chance of showing Tony some establishments around, and alleys he was beaten up at when he was a child and Bucky needs to get him away from troublemakers. They passed in front of Peggy’s restaurant, which Tony already had heard about. Peggy would be over the moon when she knew that people were talking about her sympathetic establishment.
Steve let out a sigh of distress. He needed to do a proper apology to the brunet, or at least, have a conversation about what he saw. Peggy switched her stare between the two men.
Steve nods following his train of thought. They don't have answers, not yet, at least, but they are sure that Hydra will chase them and they must be planning something for tomorrow when Steve and Tony break in Pym Technologies, so they must be ready for whatsoever is coming.
"Two and a half," Tony argues narrowing his eyes. Steve smirks, he knows Tony doesn't give in so easily.
Tony pants, his short nails scratching Steve’s sides when the Alpha hits his prostate, sending immeasurable waves of pleasure as he keeps hitting the sweet spot inside the Omega.
"Tony, are you alright?" Tony nods affirmatively, and Steve notices the billionaire's shoulders starting to relax under his touch."Nightmare?"
He didn’t die because of the arc reactor on the Iron Man armor, as well as in 2012 when Thor threw a lighting over his chest, the arc reactor also absorbed the biggest part of the power emanating from the stones, so much power that it could keep a whole city functioning. That piece of metal that kept him alive for five years after Afghanistan and that also nearly killed him for palladium poisoning, saved his life one more time. Although that, it doesn’t mean that Tony didn’t suffer other consequences from the snap.
She sat cross-legged and she can almost hear Tony complaining and asking her to take her filthy feet out of the couch, Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang? He would say. It makes her a laugh, a sad and loud laughter. She never thought she would miss him so much.
He got a cab and around twenty minutes he arrives in the place. The building was far from downtown, which makes perfect sense since the enterprise would be running experimental tests that could result in a release of radiation or even an explosion.
"Captain, he left two weeks ago. He is out of the country." He took a step forward in his direction, then completes. "Something about a congress in Switzerland."
Natasha looks curious to the also yellowed envelope before reach out for it. There is nothing written in front of it, it's not even sealed and for a moment Natasha thinks to put it back, the book was Steve's after all, every content in it would be only for him, She should not poke one's nose into his secrets. But she can't stop wondering about how this book ends up in her room, and how all of it seems so odd.
"Oh" Tony lets out. Steve's eyes fixed on him, waiting for any reaction, but Tony's face keep steady, nothing. "I'm... flattered?" his tony of voice is incertain, is Tony embarrassed again? He sounds like he is.
“Miss Potts, I’m sure Miss Romanoff will be glad in seeing you if you wait a little longer,” the receptionist said, following behind said woman.
"I know what you're thinking." Steve lifts a brow under the brunet's statement. "Hydra would steal it yesterday, unfortunately, for them, not for us absolutely, we got there a little early." Tony takes a sip of his coffee and smirks. "Can't even imagine the filthy thief's face when he, or she, realized it was already taken."
Tony exhales deeply, then he feels both of Steve's hands on his hips. The blond thrust inside him, in the next thrust, Steve hits the right spot and Tony feels the pleasure spreading through his body once more. He'll never get tired of it, he'll never get tired of the feeling of having Steve inside him, it just fucking amazing.
Bucky was already up and dressed for work when Steve came through the door. The dark-haired looked surprised to see Steve in sweaty clothes at this hour of the morning, but he didn’t say anything. though.
Despite all, he loved being there, in the 70s, with Tony. Only the two of them enjoying each other. He had loved Tony secretly for so many years that sometimes he pinched himself to make sure that he wasn't dreaming, and Tony indeed loved him, too.
"Yeah, keep moving," Tony replies feeling Steve pushes all of him inside Tony. A wave of pleasure consumes his body and he moans out loud.
"This is gonna hurt," Tony says, glancing up to Steve, who just nods knowing exactly what is coming.
"Why didn't you tell me before?" Tony mumbled, hiding his face on the blond's naked chest. Steve smelled so good, it was intoxicating, and Tony just couldn't get enough of it. Steve ran his fingers through the genius' hair, dropping kisses near his forehead and ear, never letting go of him, keeping him safe and sound in his strong arms.
Not exactly what he expected to listen, but he lets out a sigh of relief. He trusted Natasha, after overcoming all that play about Natalie Rushman and get to know her along these years, she became a friend, he could count on Nat.
His muscles burn before the effort he’s doing, pushing himself beyond his own limits, sweat is dripping from his air, and his tank top is getting soaked quickly. Steve was a faster runner in the military, and he’s glad that his rhythm seems to be the same. He focuses on the burning on his calf, trying to push away the memories brought up by the nightmare. He shut his eyes to just feel the cold air of the morning on his face, making it easier to breathe. Steve wondered if someday he would be able to get a proper night of sleep.
Natasha just hoped that wherever they are, they are fine. She also expects that they finally had confessed their feeling for each other, because after everything that they went through they really deserved to be happy.
Steve doesn’t care about the scars, or even the slight shake on his right hand, that got a lot better since he’s been doing kinesiotherapy. In a matter-of-fact, Steve was just happy that he was still alive after everything that they went through the past year.
"There's this new movie everyone's talking about-" Steve interrupts the brunet, moving to see his face clearer.
He had been looking for the empty wall in front of him for almost one hour, he glances at Tony who sleeps peacefully by his side, and Steve lets out a sigh before stepping out of the bed searching for his sketchbook that laid on the kitchen counter where Tony had left when he saw the sketch that Steve made of him another day. He catches it and sits on the couch opening in a blank page.
He shouldn't have run away, he should've stayed and listened to whatever Steve had to say. He opens his eyes facing the glass, a weakness. He knew he shouldn't but it was so hard to hear those words coming from Steve's mouth. But an action shouldn't justify another, he keeps repeating inside his head. He raises the glass. He wasn't so much strong as everyone else thought.
They broke the kiss, both gasping for air. Tony looked deep in those blue eyes, as clear as the summer sky. He liked it, no, he
“What? It’s just sparkle water and lemon, babe.” Tony says like he was reading Steve’s thoughts. Immediately, the expression on Steve’s face softens.
First, they were invading a private property, even though it's abandoned. Second, the display of affection between homosexuals is forbidden, characterizing it as a crime. So basically, they're committing not only one, but two crimes.
Steve was there in twenty minutes just like he had told Sam he would be. Thankfully, it wasn’t a fancy party nor people were dressed in formal clothes. He dodged from a few men in the entry holding their glasses filled with champagne. Steve always felt like he didn’t belong to parties. He wasn’t very good at socializing or talking, he was more the kind of listener. However, his job today was to take pictures of everything happening here. He would pass unnoticed, or so he thought when a hand grabbed onto his shoulder.
I won't post next week. Sorry, but it's gonna be a little complicated for me. Anyway, I wish y'all a Happy New Year, and stay safe!
"I can sleep on the couch." He says. Tony pushes out of the blond's wrap and he looks around the apartment, his looks falls on the double bed and he turns with an incredulous look to Steve.
Inside of the lab, Tony stirs in documents on the table, most of them filled with chemicals instructions and equations, none of them were really finished, so far as Tony read them. The deposit of the Pym particles should be was empty, of course, the alchemist wouldn't let something so powerful, and dangerous if it falls on the wrong hands, exposed, he probably took it with him. Tony opens another drawer, he moves the paper inside carefree, then a light green envelope caught his attention, it was already opened, so Tony read it.
His mind travels back to a few days ago. After the game, Steve and him were leaving the pub, the guy, this same guy almost stumbled onto him, but Steve had put an arm on his lower back, preventing it.
“Will you be my best man, right?” Bucky asked, pulling away the hug to look at Steve. The photographer smiled only widened.
"I know." Steve shuts his eyes, feeling the redness growing on his cheek with the next question that came out of his mouth. "D-did you like it?"
"Don't worry kid." He pats the boy's shoulder smiling back to him. "Would you know, by the way, where the director's office is?" He slips out, taking advantage of the situation.
"I love you, Tony." He whispers facing Tony passionately. There's lust and love deep inside of those blue eyes. Tony strokes Steve's cheek affectionately with a smile on his face.
Steve grabs Tony's face between his hand, they are close, too close to each other. Steve can feel Tony warm breath so close to his face, he feels the adrenaline spike going away. Steve strokes his thumb back and forth on Tony's right cheek. He hates to see Tony hurt.
He feels his eyes watery and he decides to shut it. He couldn't imagine what this man must have done to Steve to talk. He must have tortured him. This simple thought makes Tony's chest clenches in distress.
The blond took off his camera, positioning himself to get a nice, clear shot of that lovely scene. This was probably the last picture of the day to update on his Instagram and online portfolio. Steve crouched down to get the sparks of light reflected in the water and the fancy color of the trees where a couple of swans created a gorgeous spotlight. Perfect. Steve stood up, blue eyes fixed on the camera, his main work material nowadays, and a slight smile on his face as he shoved the camera in his bag and walked fast, not wanting to get stuck in traffic on his drive back to the Brooklyn.
That seemed like a good occasion. The thing was just falling on the soldier’s lap. Maybe the odds are in his favor this week. First, a new job, then an amazing first day, and now a party. He couldn’t ask for more; he just expected the odds to stay in his favor during the entire week. Steve sighed assuring himself that he could make it. He could give it a try. It would be good.
"Oh, Tony," Steve whispers, his eyes falling on Tony's lips on the exact moment that the brunet's lick it, wetting it. Tony observed the blond's expression attentively. They wanted it, both of them, the universe was always pushing them to each other. So, Steve leans and smashes their lips together. Their tongues intertwined inside their mouths, tasting the moment, why they took so long to do it? It feels so right, so
“Oh, you’re the new photographer Natasha hired!” she said excitedly. “I’m Wanda. Wanda Maximoff. This is my twin, Pietro.” The guy nodded at Steve with a small smile. “We are internships here. I work with Natasha, and Pietro works with Clint. Clint and Natasha are almost like siblings, by the way. They’re best friends, I’d say. He works in finances.” Wanda wandered, waving her hands in the air a little bit exasperated or too excited.
"I told her that you have a really jealous partner and it's better, for her own's sake, to back off.
“Well, we don’t exactly pay for the food since Peggy always sent dinner for us. Anyway, you know I don’t mind, Stevie,” Bucky argued. “I’m with till the end of the line, pal.”
"Told ya." Tony throws three orange gums inside his mouth. "Let's go to the movies, then you take me out for dinner."
Steve does exactly as told. He moves at a rough pace as both of them like. Shamelessly. They moan out loud, and they don’t give a fuck if someone is going to listen to them. Steve thrust harder and harder each time, going deeper than ever and Bucky allows him while he pushes his hips back to meet with Steve’s thrust. Steve grasped tighter on his waist when he went deeper and Bucky moaned while the blond’s keep hitting that sweet spot inside of him. He probably will have bruises, though he doesn’t care, because he knows any purple will have disappeared in the morning thank to the serum running through their veins.
"Damn, Tony, you scared the hell out of me." He answers sitting on the bench and taking off the bandages around his fists and hands.
His hands work fast to untie Steve, and Tony glances at the door every second afraid of being caught, when he unties one of Steve's hands the supersoldier starts to untie the another, both working fast, he is untying Steve's right leg when he sees the knob turns.
"Hey!" He waves, the girl smiles to him, right before spreads an amount of smoke in his direction. "Have you seen Steve today?"
Crossing the crowd seemed almost impossible, but Pietro made it easy while Steve stopped a few times to not get hit on the chin or nose with so many elbows and hands swinging in the air. They made it. Pietro got to the bar in the first place, and Steve saw Wanda talking to Clint. Yeah, Clint, Steve thought that was the guy’s name.
“When they know what?” Steve asked, still confused with the course of the conversation. A surprised look appeared on Wanda’s face.
"This is incredible, Mr. Stark. This whole thing of time travel is almost unbelievable. Fascinating!" Pierce speaks in awe. "How did you manage it? Such expertise should not be wasted." He moves close to Tony. "We need someone like you, with your brain, we would be decades forward. We could control everything."
“Oh, fuck,” Bucky said, when Steve’s hands went to his shoulders, sending away any tension that could still be there. His fingers traced the scar that joined Bucky's metal arm to his flesh.
Well, Steve wasn't wrong at all, they walk two blocks away and there is a sign indicating the hotel, it wasn't so fancy, but it would be enough to pass the night. They enter the place, the only light source was the doors opened, the hall smelled of mold and there was a slight dust resting in the furniture.
He traces nonsense lines on the blond's skin, feeling the warmth under his fingers. Tony lets his body relax against Steve's. The supersoldier's jaw setting on the top of his head.
He fell on his knees on the floor, panting desperately, while everyone around him was moving. Some were hidden behind the scene or had crouched down on the floor just like Steve. Others were commenting on what happened. There was too much noise. It's too loud. He needs to focus, but he can’t, not with all that noise. He needs to find shelter, get out of the line of shooting, he needs to think. He needs to do something. Anything.
"I assure you that your Captain is having a great time with us, Mr. Stark." Tony blinks, frozen in place, he makes several attempts of speaking, but he couldn't.
"There;" Tony shouts overwhelmed with the pleasure his body is experiencing while Steve thrusts in the same spot. Tony grabs the sheets, his knuckles turning white when his cock throbs on Steve's hand who keep pumping it harder now. "I'm gonna cum." Steve smiles.
Steve's eyes follow Tony going into the store, he follows the brunet inside a few seconds later, but he stays close to the door. There were some kids running around inside the small place, the place opted for colorful walls, the colors were too distracted and it hurt looks at it for a long time, it smelled too sweet and chocolate, at the corner of his eyes he saw a five years old blond kid dive his fingers into the chocolate fountain, then licking them. The mothers too busy talking and gossiping with each other to pay attention to their own kids.
He should be doing better, right? That’s what he was supposed to do. That’s what people expecting from him. To do better. To be better.
Tony looks down to his own Time GPS on his arm, showing random numbers, it looks like it also was damaged, this he could fix it, he didn't want to. Tony smiles, and Steve follows his gaze. The blond opens his mouth, but Tony cuts him off.
“And will you let me sleep?” Tony mumbles, lifting a brow while a sassy smile is playing on his lips. Steve looks deep in those almonds eyes.
Maria was a taller woman who exhaled discipline and dominance. She was in the Army for a few years, but now she worked at the FBI. Steve met her when he went to one of Sam’s support group reunion. Even though Sam and Maria weren’t part of the military anymore, they were always involved with beneficent projects, support groups, and getting help for veterans.
"Don't look at me like that!" Tony exclaimed. "Didn't your previous experiences as a criminal prepare you for that?" Tony provokes reminding what happened in Germany, the Civil War.
Steve had spent his afternoon updating his portfolio, editing photos, and posting them on Instagram. He wasn’t popular on social media, but sometimes he got frustrated for having just a small number of followers. Some days he has the impression that he was talking with no one, besides Peggy who always liked all his pictures, and she even shouts out his account on her stories.
"Do you see that pickup at the end of the street?" Tony says but he didn't turn around, Steve glances upon Tony's shoulder. "Tank if full. The owner just got in the restaurant with a bouquet in one of the hands, probably a date, so he's not gonna notice that the pickup is gone till the end of the date. It gives us, at least, one hour ahead on the road." Tony speaks sure of himself. Steve nods in agreement.
"What? I saw him this morning, he said he'd come here." Tony says visibly confused, at the same time he feels his heart rate increasing.
Steve is just a few steps from him when Tony noticed two men entering the aisle, one of them leads his hand to his hips ready to pull out a gun, in the next moment before Tony blinks again Steve has the guy on the floor.
"Well, thank you." The boy turns back to return his activities and Tony starts making his way to the elevator, but turns back. "Hey, kid!" He shouts, the boy turns around to look at him. "Go break some eggs." Then, Tony turns back smiling nostalgically.
"He's Tony. Tony Stark." Peggy's eyes widened by the mention of the brunet's last name."I-I have to check on Tony," He finally says walking out of the laundromat, Peggy follows right behind him.
"What's wrong, Capsicle?" He furrowed. "You look like you ate something and didn't like the taste." Steve puts his hand on the genius back, leading him back to the laundromat.
Steve frowned. Of course, she would see him around, he worked there and so did she. Oh, wait… Steve thought when the words finally sink in. A voice came over to get Steve out of that situation.
Outside, the salty breeze of the sea welcomed them. It was fresh for a summer evening. The sunset was a mix of rose, orange, and blue. Indeed, a breathtaking sky. The weather brings up memories from when Tony lived in Malibu, he used to love evenings like that, the only ones capable of taking his ass out of the workshop just to appreciate the landscape with an expensive glass of white wine in his hands.
"Hey, don't look at me like that! It was the best thing I could think at the moment." The billionaire exclaims indignantly.
"Great, because I love you so much, Tony. I've been loving you since that battle in New York." Steve confessed. "I can't handle losing you anymore. I-I don't even know how I handled it all these years."
"I'm-I'm sorry for..." for what? He screwed up like he always does, he yelled with Steve and Peggy because he was jealous, that's utterly childish. Oh God, Captain America was really messing with his feelings. "...yelling." He concludes.
“Hey! That’s my parking space!” Someone shouts, and Steve turns around to face a dark-haired guy with a beard to shave. Steve’s eyes fall on the badge around his neck. Brock Rumlow.
Tony knows. There are no words to describe this whole fucking project. It seems impossible and unreal, but here they are, inside this folder there are the names of victims and the complete experiment report, most of them did not survive to the procedures and the ones who did had suffered several damages, physically and emotionally.
“Steve?” Tony called, bringing Steve back to their actual situation. “You’re gonna lose the show, honey.”
“You have a really nice portfolio, you know? The last one you posted yesterday, the two swans. An amazing shot. I was impressed,” Natasha said, and Steve couldn’t help but blush. “Pratt Institute, huh?” Natasha continued, a smirk on her face.
Steve wasn't sure how long he waited for Tony, fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe? He was so lost in his reveries that he didn't see time pass by. He was starting to worry when Tony's voice spoke through the comm.
Steve took a deep breath feeling his chest tightening, he hates to see Tony upset, it is even worse knowing that he is the cause of Tony being hurt. After that fight in the german airport a few years ago, he had sworn that he would never hurt Tony again. Steve exhales. He guesses he just had broken it already.
“Why the hell did it explode?” Wanda asked Natasha, she was holding an unused, new light bulb. The red-haired was massaging her temple like she had woken up from a terrible dream.
Tony rubs his hard cock over the pants on Steve's, the friction makes the supersoldier moans loud. He lets go of the brunet's hands, moving his own hands to unbuckle Tony's belt and getting him rid of the pants that Tony was still wearing.
“Hey, man. Wanda will be glad that you came,” Pietro shrugged. Steve gave him a cracked smile before following after him, in the middle of the crowd where people were dancing to the electronic rhythm played by the DJ.
Natasha looks at Rhodey determined. Nothing can stop them. They are going to save the universe. It's time to the Avengers assemble once more.
“Why not? It’s fun. It makes everything funnier,” Wanda started to dance when another song started to play.
“My father wasn’t the best either,” Steve made a pause. “He used to drink. A lot. That’s why I hate drinking so much,” he stretched his legs. “He was an abusive son of a bitch. He beat my mother and me. Then, he’d say he would be better, he would not do it again, and everything was fine for a while until the next one.” Tony squeezed his knee slightly, a comforting touch.
"Yeah, we should." Steve holds his hand pulling them back to the street light, they walk fast, their body is on fire and the urgent feeling of touching each other is too high to be ignored. Finally, the ugly building appears at their sight for Steve and Tony's relief. Tony pulls the keys out of his pocket and he barely could open the door because Steve was kissing him, on his neck, shoulders. Steve pushes him in, slamming his back against the door.
The elevator’s doors opened, and Tony broke the kiss, walking into the living room of the penthouse. Steve sighed exasperatedly. He did not understand what was holding Tony back. They surely needed to talk about it, but not today. Today Steve wasn’t in the mood, he just wanted… sex. And ask Tony about his Thanksgiving plans, of course. Steve followed Tony into the kitchen, where the brunet was already preparing coffee for himself.
Tony types the numbers, and they hear a click when the door opens. Tony sneaks in the room while Steve watches the door, quickly Tony slides four Pym particles inside the pocket on his lab coat. They only need two particles one for each, but Tony believes that it is better safe than sorry, they could break one of them accidentally on their way to Malibu. He just hopes that it does not happen in fact.
Steve checked the hour on the nightstand, it was pretty late, he probably should drag Tony out from the lab to the bed, otherwise, he knew the brunette would work all night. The soldier goes downstairs and watches Tony moving the holograms while drinking something from his mug, probably, coffee. He loves watching Tony while he’s working. He is so focused on what he’s doing that he didn’t even realize Steve approaching.
Steve's voice is hoarse and sleepy. Tony wishes he could sleep just like Steve was doing a few minutes ago before Tony sighed exasperatedly for his own lack of sleep. That's his fault, wake Steve, he means. He also knew that the painkiller was the reason for Steve being so sleepy. Tony probably should take some of them, perhaps he would fall asleep. The brunet sighed anew.
"I want you, Steve." Tony wasn't innocent. Tony Stark wasn't innocent at all when it comes to sex, but he never ever actually did it, even though he had played around with some guys that he used to know in parties, he never went that far, just some blow jobs at most. But with Steve he wanted everything and he'd never been so sure about anything in his life.
"Are you sure you want to come? I can do it on by myself," Tony reassures the blond. "Then, we can get the Tesseract and go back."
A small smile appears on the supersoldier's lips. Tony sat back on the bed, his hand starting to work on Steve's shoulder, he can't deny that he is a bit surprised when he takes off the bandage and see that the appearance is a lot better than yesterday, Steve indeed heals fast, faster than he thought.
"Good, you?" Steve replies standing upright, and Tony turns around to face him. Steve's blond hair is sticking on his forehead due to his sweat, his lips are dry and parted. He smells to sex, just like Tony, and he thinks that's so hot.
“Steve?” Tony is in front of him, but his eyes are still on the man being taken out. “Steve,” Tony calls again, a gentle and warm hand touching the Alpha’s face is what makes Steve’s blue eyes, now dark blue because of the rage episode, focus on Tony. A fond smile on the Omega’s face. “Hey, it’s okay. It’s okay, big guy. I’m okay,” Tony whispered repeatedly, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck to calm him down, Tony pushes Steve’s head against his shoulder close to his mating glands marked by Steve.
"Hey, you!" He shouts, taking a step in his direction, he's too close. "I know you." Tony frows. No, he didn't know the guy, how could he--
In the morning, when Tony wakes up Steve isn't by his side anymore, there are only wrinkled sheets and his smell left behind, though his side is still warm, so it's not a long time since the blond got up, Tony's suspects are right when he hears the shower on. He lays down again putting a pillow on his face to drown out his scream. There he was, trapped in the past with Steve Rogers, the man that his father always talked about non-stop, the man that was his teammate, the same man who he had a crush since... always? He had no idea when he started to develop feelings for his teammate.
Tony feels good to have someone to talk about his projects other than Pepper and Bruce. He had been working hard on these for the past ten years since he decided to shut down the weapons manufacture in Stark Industries.
Steve looked at his reflection in the mirror in the bathroom. He had bags under his eyes, which was awful for someone who would be in a job interview tomorrow. Steve threw the two pills in his hands into his mouth, swallowing the medication that allows him to get some hours of sleeping during the night. Steve hated being on meds, but he needed it now, otherwise, his mind wandered through dark places.
Natasha wasn't the kind affective and sentimental when it comes to objects. Her room used to be extremely minimalist, with only her basic possessions, although when Tony set them in he had told that all of them are free to decorate their rooms the way that they wanted, it was their home, after all.
loved it and he wanted more of it, more of Steve, all he could wish was that Steve also wanted it as much as him.
"Professor Pym?" The student says uncertain, he only continues when Hank stares at him. "Professor Evans requires you in his lab, something about a non-approved project, I think." The student slipped out looking uncomfortable.
