“We are not trapped under the thumb of the US government.”
“We have to consider it, Tony, if Thanos really got the Stone first, maybe Thor’s idea makes some sense. The Stone would be telling us about someone it had already met.” Bruce reminds him.
But he can’t.
He’s risked once, and it paid off.
“Wait, isn’t that the thing you said you were trying to get back a few years ago? The one your girlfriend got attacked by?” Tony recalls in a surprised jolt, a memory stirring in his mind, from a long time ago, from a certain point in time he can’t quite pinpoint right.

“I did. But I was ignoring it.”
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
He will always do anything for Anthony Stark.
(Breathe.)
“Did you disagree over it?” Bruce asks, not because he doesn’t get it, but because he wants to push Tony to keep talking. Tony, like the pathetic, starving for validation mess that he is, takes the opening without even thinking twice, unthinking of how he’s cracking his sternum open and letting his heart pour out like it’s spilled ink, of how much this will hurt if it gets too far.
“So.” Rhodey sighs. “This was absolute crap.”
“In case anything happens, and I mean
for Steve’s comfort at this moment. “Do you want me to come back later or are we talking about this now?”
But he won’t ask her to take him back.

Careless, indeed.)
“Then they probably did something right.” Nebula comments, slightly more satisfied. “I thought you’d die for a moment.”
“Sure.” Tony concedes. “FRI, I’m giving Nebula and Rocket access to you. Work on getting some Sanskrit into your vocabulary and in their own systems too – do the best you can to help us crack those books as quick as possible.”

“I escaped.” Nebula says, very pointedly, also making herself very clear and enunciating her words carefully, to make sure she cannot be misunderstood. “Most of his army started to move, so I had a chance. I went past the guards, sent a warning sign to Mantis, and asked her to meet me on Titan, because I knew that would be his meeting point. I thought we could try and ambush him.”
He doesn’t deserve him, either.
“It sounded like him.” Nebula whispers, out of nowhere, and the dead certainty in her voice makes Tony shudder. “Your robot. It

thinks of his own beliefs.
“Tony?” Says a soft voice, so gentle and so kind, a little rough around the edges. It’s full of promises of comfort, of caring concern, and it makes Tony freeze, because his body can’t properly compute it right now. The world feels to hostile. Sharp. Cold. The warmth is foreign, unexpected, and its presence catches him so off guard he feels like he’s about to fall, to collapse, unable to hold himself up. “Are you okay?”

Thor stays quiet for a long, long moment, so long that if Tony couldn’t see his feet from his lowered gaze, he would almost have believed that he left. It’s only when the awkwardness becomes too big, and the silence too heavy, that he dares to raise his head, and finds Thor, face open, eyes so sincere and concerned that it hurts to look at him.
The scream echoes through the walls, sharp and piercing like glass, and if anyone has any particularly shocking reaction to his screams, it’s not like Tony can see them; Not past the haze of rage and tears that cloud his eyes and judgment, that forces him to lock eyes with Barton and not even blink, refusing to give him a single inch after Barton has just tried to throw everything on Tony’s face as if Tony was the most horrible person he had ever seen. Barton’s teeth click together audibly when he shuts his mouth in a quick, startling movement, lips twisting in an ugly expression, his eyes dark and full of emotions Tony cannot comprehend, not when his mind is stripped so bare.
They all stop.

to see, almost mocking, and Tony is half glad, half pissed off at the realization that not even the apocalypse can put out the burning pit of spite and rage that seems to forever live inside Steve Rogers, because it’s familiar, it’s almost comforting, and even if Tony can’t help but associate his stubbornness and righteousness with less than pleasant memories, he still feels, deep down, a little twinge of relief in knowing he’s not broken.
“Why do you have his shield?” Rhodey stands up, chin turned up and eyes squinting, the same face he always makes when he
“He’s going to bite your head off.” Sam warns, not as an attempt to dissuade him, just as a reminder, because he’s already passing the phone back to Steve. Steve is not sure if he’s talking about the Accords or Siberia, but at this point, it really doesn’t matter.

“I’m sure she’s fine.” Tony reflexively says, before he can think about it.
“Zen-Whoberi.” Nebula nods to herself, determined. “And Vormir.”
“But if your guy isn’t joining us when we go after Thanos, we need to know.” Rhodey points out. “We’re gonna need to get you some equipment to give you a way to fight. The Hulkbuster is not in good shape, but we can’t let you go out there with no backup.”
“Ok.” Steve repeats, numbly— before something else, completely unexpected, bursts out of his lips in a rush, half panicked and half painful, a throb low and deep inside his belly that makes his stomach hurt. “Do you blame me?”
There is another matter.
“It’s complicated.” Tony huffs, moving closer to the worktables in a wobbly step. “I have all the original plans for what the program was supposed to be – his calibration settings, the code, the learning parameters, but none of those are exclusive to Ultron.”

That was all he had focused on. Nothing else.

The sound keeps echoing in his head, even when the metal plate of the wall behind him stops vibrating with the impact. It sounds weird. A dull, distant sound of a hard plate, so tangible Tony can almost feel the way it crawls inside his brain like a worm, finding a place to nest deep inside his cortex.

“But you want to leave all those people to die while you hide in your lab.”

Sam’s posture is relaxed, but he doesn’t seem completely at ease. Steve wonders if he should assure Sam that he’ll be fine, and then, he wonders if it would even make a difference.

“Rhodey.” Tony whispers, and gets up slowly, reminding himself
These are his children? Bloodthirsty maniacs, armed with psychic powers and weapons and spears, that descended from the skies to bring chaos and dust, to invade their lives and rip their loved ones from their arms without so much as blinking an eye?

They start collecting their things and getting up almost automatically, both of them moving in quick, stiff motions, like the always do when they go on a mission. This is them entering a battle mindset as easily as breathing, going through motions as efficiently and precisely as possible, as a way to diminish risks and make the most of the available time. They learned how to work like this during their partnership at SHIELD, when they discovered Steve’s strength and Natasha’s skill for stealth created a deadly combination, and now this is just second nature for them.

Broken promises hurt more than most things. Disappointment and betrayal have a very distinct flavor on the tongue, like ash and blood, and it doesn’t wash away over the years. It clings. It taints. And every time you swallow, it’s there, to make you remember, feeling like poison going down your throat, killing you slowly.

He is the only one that can taste the insatiable hunger for revenge? No matter the odds?

“It looks so beautiful on you.” He marvels, entranced by the sight, even though it doesn’t gleam in the low light of the room. There is no fancy light show as in the pictures or stores, there is no sound to accompany the sight, like an audio effect as in a commercial. It’s beautiful in how real it is. It’s beautiful to see in on her, it’s beautiful because of what it represents, what they tried to make it represent, on the chance she gave it and all it meant. It’s… beautiful. “You’d look so beautiful. I just know it.”
“Less than half.” Tony says again, deliriously. “What is the precise number?”

“Are you sure?” he asks, sounding every bit as preoccupied as he feels, but he doesn’t sound reprimanding. Which is a victory in his book— because Steve knows how cutting he can sound when he damn well wants to.

Pepper starts into a quick walk inside, and the only that stops her is the fact that Tony is half-attached to her and so, so distracted that when she walks, she pulls him awkwardly and the movement stings all the way across Tony’s abdomen, and he hisses before he can stop himself, and Nebula jolts in alert behind him at the pained sound.
“I don’t know.” Pepper admits, sniffing discretely, but still keeping the tight smile on her face. “It’s been a lot, Tony. It’s – It’s difficult.”
“Yeah. Alright.” Barton agrees, just as calm and determined, as if he’s made his peace with his choice. And what he chose was to

Tony denied, impossible not. He was watching him at the time crouching in front of his nephew and niece, putting on a fireworks show. And those dwarves, they seemed so delighted with him, like his father and mother, that they even climbed on his back with all the confidence in the world.
Tony turned to see him, he swallowed saliva. He hated those gatherings, because he always felt lonely and a bit underappreciated, besides being constantly bothered. Even the damn kids used to tease him. But that Christmas, he was not alone. Therefore, when he nodded, he did so with a genuine smile. He grabbed Steve's suitcase, because it was the least bulky (he left his for Steve) and walked across the concrete path to the entrance.
“Who is it?”
Santa nodded and turned to look at Tony with his kind eyes, half hidden by fake white eyebrows.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mr. Santa, would you accept the wish of a big child?”
“Yes” Steve smiled at him again.
“You know?” he started and gained the attention he was looking for “My family is… a little bit special. More like rare or, maybe, like all the others, but for me, they are weird”
Tony, Steve, and the children had their noses red and jackets covered with snow, but they laughed merrily. Maria smiled. It seemed to her that she had in front the two sides of the same coin; On the one hand, Gregory had problems in his relationship, and on the other, Tony started one that, unlike his brother's, she liked more. Steve was sweetheart, Sharon wasn't.
“Dancing,” he answered without flinching.
Tony rolled his eyes.
“Oh, very well, Tony, then. It's a pretty name”
The blonde smiled widely. It was clear why she had done it, indeed, he was sure that his mother had not sent her with that message.
“No, no, nothing like that... but we'll talk about it later....”
“We're here so uncle Steve can paint us." Jane tugged at Steve’s pants.
Howard didn't add anything. At some point, he had always identified with Tony. They were both equal at that age. Always from one place to another, without staying more than one night, jumping from bed to bed. A family was something he never thought he would have, but now he had one. And he was happy about it, it was something he didn't regret. And perhaps, Tony's time had come.
“A boyfriend” he said hastily “A boyfriend for Christmas”

Steve tilted his face. He looked like a puppy sitting there on the floor, waiting for some reaction from Tony.
“I think your mother already loves him” Howard crooned “You won't be able to leave him so easily anymore”
“Of course you can” said Natasha.

“Do you know what it's like to knock on a door, Sharon?!” the brunette snapped, still hugging Steve's neck, preventing him from turning around.
“I'm afraid not,
But the boy, named Steve, shook his head.
“What’s your name?” Santa asked.
The flight went smoothly. Exhausted by the morning's emotions, Tony fell asleep as soon as the plane took off. He woke up when the plane's speakers announced the landing and, also, the need to put on the seat belts. To his surprise, but not to Steve's, who, by the way, merely smiled at him warmly; he woke up with his cheek resting on his arm. He rubbed his eyes and mumbled a sorry, that Steve rejected by pinching his opposite cheek very gently. For Tony that kind of caress was far from his understanding, but he felt such a sense of comfort that he couldn't help but return a slightly self-conscious smile.
“Oops, sorry” Howard laughed, and spoke again to Steve “You're military, not bad. And then?”
Tony looked at them with a scowl “I don’t want to talk about that”
The man laughed and as if wanting to fraternize with Steve, he put his hand on his arm.
“How was the flight?” Howard asked, taking out a cigarette that he offered him later “Do you smoke?”
“Oh yes, I will."
“We will lose it” said the blond, showing him the plane tickets.
Howard outlined a little smile, the dynamics of both reminded him of something. He cleared his throat to get them out of their bubble, but only Steve turned to look at him, so he spoke to him.
"Tony," his mother told him, "we've run out of guest rooms. So Steve sleeps with you.”
“That blessed James, let's see when you present him to us” Pepper scolded her.
“I love it.”
"Ah, well, Steve and I are not married yet."
Maria nodded and smiled broadly at him.
And Tony asked his body not to pass out.

He could already see his house ridiculously decorated with bright lights, Santa's hideous sleigh with the whole thing and reindeer on the roof, which also, had movement (courtesy of his father). He could guess the crown adorning the front door, and the disgusting mistletoe hanging from the entrance, under which Aunt Elizabeth would be waiting to give him her classic and salivary welcome kiss. That, not to mention that his mother would think of making the turkey, which was an announcement of failure; at least he had to recognize that, to stay out of the kitchen all year, she didn't burn the turkey; but left it drier than the plant on his window sill.
“What?”
What if the wish ended that night? Perhaps Tony was some kind of Cinderella, and the magic that had given him the best Christmas of his life would fade at midnight. It gave him a shudder, and he followed his gaze to Steve, who, like everyone else, had risen to his feet and was heading into the living room. Tony did too, with a glass of champagne between his fingers. If that man vanished that night ... what would he do? Thinking pragmatically, how would he explain to his family that Steve wasn't there the next day? And on the other hand, the emotional side, did he want the magic to end?
Tony rang the bell and a female voice spoke through the door.
“It's not Santa, it's a dude dressed as a Santa” said Tony and got a harsh look from his friend.
He did not add more and turned on his heel, to go to his bedroom. Steve followed him without saying a word, but Tony tried not to turn to see him.
“It's me, aunt Elizabeth, Tony”
Hello!! Here is another update. All credits to Aomame_kz.

“They attack me every time I go. Except this time, I'm taking you with me. Well, they know I like boys, of course” he felt that he was babbling, so he took a deep breath to see if he could organize his thoughts “But I'm sure they don't expect someone like you... even I didn't expect it” he added in a slightly lower voice, but it reached the blond’s ears, who widened his smile “So... what I want to tell you is that, in advance, I apologize for...”
He opened the door and Natasha almost fell on him.
“Captain? Are you military?”
“Change of partners!” Yelled a crazy Howard.
“You would have dated him, and not ‘James’, by the way, does that James exist?”
“Oh, your bags” the girl found his luggage and started to snoop around “Ah, your tickets! Are you leaving early tomorrow? Greetings to your mommy”
He closed his eyes tightly and mentally counted.
“Yes!” she said “From holiday cheer!”
“It’s Santa!”
He would kill them, he swore he would kill them.
“Oh, yeah?” Tony dropped into a couch defeated and disinterested.
Tony got a piece of bread stuck in his throat and had to hit his chest with his fist, while trying to cough. Steve patted him on the back to help him. Those were the kind of questions Tony was afraid of.

The young man didn't answer, he handed him a Christmas card and smiled at him. Tony swallowed and snatched the card. He opened it and
Steve nodded “Does it bother you?”
After a brief discussion with the children, who wanted to continue playing outside, and a promise that Tony didn’t understand from Steve towards them, they entered.
“Sure, ma. Don’t worry.”
they wanted a son in law already. His mother said that settle down will help him in his life, his father said that, perhaps, that way he would concentrate on other things, such as the family business, for example.
“At school they said I was a nerd," he explained. “They bothered me, or rather, they tried to. I always managed to get rid of them and, also, make a fool of them.”
Tony opened his mouth indignantly, "Witch!" he told her, and like a child in a tantrum, he climbed on the legs of that corrupt Santa.
They had written down on a napkin. They wanted to go on a trip for New Year, all together. Tony was not bothered by that, but the fact that all his friends would go with their respective couples… except for him. He would be the only one without a partner. He would be the fly in the soup, the salt shaker on the table, the pairless socks. Boy, the little topic was turning more annoying than a piece of junk in the eye.
“But what a handsome boy!” exclaimed Tony's mother and came over to give him a loud kiss on the cheek “There is no doubt that my son has good taste”
Aunt Elizabeth preferred to go sit down, and Maria offered to guide her to a safe seat. On the dance floor, only Tony, his nephew and niece, and Steve were left. The kids, without thinking, danced among themselves. Tony thought that that dance session would end there, but suddenly and without realizing how, he was back in Steve's arms.
“Anthony” he muttered reluctantly.
“Is that it’s stupid…”
“You are clever, Santa" Tony smirked at him "It is enough for me that he is handsome and kind... and has to have more than half a neuron”
Hello!!! I just have a question. So I researched if the word “brunette” was used for men, it can but… not? I’m confused. Please, feel free to correct me if I’m wrong :)
“The pleasure is mine, sir” Steve squeezed the offered hand “Steven Rogers”
“It's okay, Tony”
Steve nodded again.
“My boyfriend!” Tony exclaimed, coming out of his temporary shelter.
“Where the hell did you come from?” Tony asked.
Tony looked at the Band-Aid that Steve had put on his finger, it had little drawings of dinosaurs on it, and he smiled broadly. Dinner was already cooking, so he was finally out of the kitchen. Sitting on the porch of the backyard of his house, “taking care” of his nephew and niece who were coming and going playing with fireworks, he saw how the sun began to set. Inside, his aunt was still knitting; Uncle Paul was watching an old Christmas movie; Gregory and his father talked things about the company, as always; and her mother took care of the turkey that had cost her so much work. Steve… Steve arrived at that moment. Tony heard his footsteps approaching and then saw him sit down next to him and handed him the box of donuts, the promised box. Tony smiled at him and received his reward like a puppy.

“Natasha, are you really not drunk?”
“Believe it or not, when I was a kid I was always thinner and smaller than average, and I was a bag of diseases. So, I rarely went out to play in parks.”
“What?! NOOOO! I’m not a child!”
“Do you know what it's like to close the door, Tony?"
Tony snorted and followed them dragging their suitcases.
“Your family must be amazing. If you're part of it, I can't imagine it being otherwise”
“You guys are really ridiculous” he told them as he took a seat between them and order without delay a very charged american coffee.

"You're Santa, aren't you?" scoffed Tony "You should guess”
“Love at first sight!” Howard, however, did not seem surprised.
Tony didn't know whether to feel fear or excitement. One thing was clear to him: He would stop asking him the what, the how and the why of that unheard of situation. He would accept it as it had been presented to him and also, why not? He would enjoy it.

like a taunt, but Steve won’t take the bait. He simply sighs and gives a minute shake of his head, a silent plea for T’Challa not to insist on it, and the king is kind enough to grant him this small mercy for now. With one equally minute nod, T’Challa changes the subject abruptly, uncaring if it looks too obvious.
Then, she brings him something that looks like chips, and tells him to eat. Tony also doesn’t say thank you.
That’s enough understanding for them.

Yeah.
And it’s the vibration that tips him off, even before the sound, and Steve honest-to-God startles and nearly cracks the table with the force which he hits it with his elbow, dropping everything, the projector making a heavy sound as it hits the wood.
“After longs hours of deliberation.” The man says, and the identification beneath his image tells them this is Judge Talbot, the very man who might have just sentenced Scott for a terrible fate; or not. “The delegation, along with World Security Council, the United Nations’ Enhanced Individuals’ Protection Board, and the American and the German representatives of the Sokovia Accords, has decided to sentence Scott Lang, the man known as Ant-Man, who sided with Captain America and the other Rogue Avengers against the Accords, to a prison sentence of ten years, to be carried out in the United States Penitentiary in California—"
“If I help you escape and you die, Stark…” Nebula growls a threat, closing in over Tony threateningly, her face very close to his.
“He gave the Stone to Thanos willingly. Thanos didn’t kill him first. He didn’t steal it. Strange
And with that parting jab, with a smirk on his face and a lazy wave, he turns around and goes for the door again – and this time, Steve lets him go.
He thinks he hears a noise, something akin to a sharp inhale, but he pretends he doesn’t hear it.
“I wouldn’t—” Tony gets up, annoyed, and their faces are suddenly so close.

And Steve feels shame like he never has before in his life.
He wasn’t trying to kill Tony, and he knows this; and he knows that at that point, Tony’s heart no longer depended in the Arc Reactor to beat. But if there is one thing that Steve only remembered far too late,

He exhales shakily, biting the inside of his cheek, and looks back at Nebula, unable to stop himself.
“To stop Thanos from killing us.”
He can’t lead soldiers who have missions of their own.
Tony feels a shiver run down his arms, hairs sticking up on their ends, and he hates the intense heebie-jeebies this magic talk gives him every single time. At a loss for words, the only thing he thinks to reply is, “I think I saw that on a Disney movie once.”
“We go out there and help who we can. Just in the city, we can’t go too far. I don’t even know if we’ll be able to, depending on how many people are out there.”

of them.”
He doesn’t want to admit it, but it’s true. They have to stay away from the palace, or else they might destroy something without meaning to, and Steve owes T’Challa far too much already to risk that happening in any way.
Natasha turns her face away, mouth twitching like she’s biting the inside of her cheek, eyes trailed on the ceiling in something that looks too much like an effort not to cry.
He takes almost twenty minutes to shake himself off his stupor and run to find Natasha, his feet moving without his consent, needing not to be alone and to speak the words out loud to someone else, so maybe— maybe they will make more sense, maybe the storm that begins to rage inside Steve’s chest will abate, someone else will hear the same and will assure him he doesn’t have to panic anymore.
(Cap…)

Natasha glances at him, but Steve keeps his mouth shut. He doesn’t trust what he’ll say, if he makes an attempt to.
so I guess that answers that question. God knows what Tony thought, no one knows what goes on in that guy’s head.”
But he doesn’t stop. Whatever it is about Nebula that made him hesitate – and it could be a whole lot –, Bruce shrugs it off almost immediately and keeps walking, stepping heavily on the ground when he gets out, as if he can finally trust what’s beneath him with his weight, and he all but jogs in Tony’s direction just as Rhodey did, hard, deep lines of worry etched on his face, jittery anxiety so clear it ages him years and years with just the creases on his forehead.

“We need that gauntlet.” Tony says, with complete certainty.
“And what would you have done!?” Natasha scoffs. “Would you have waited until Barnes came to you willingly to be treated, and then you’d wring a confession out of him?
— And isn’t that all that Steve wants? For them to understand?
Tony remembers why they are called dangerous.
While Rhodey is still on the line, Tony glances over at Nebula for a brief second before making an impulsive decision and saying, “Please don’t come in guns blazing. I have a friend over.”

, he moans, into his husband’s mouth, as his own clothes are pushed away, and skin presses against skin, and suddenly, that is not enough.
They all jump at the same time, shocked by the news. “Is he ok?” Sam asks, at the same time Clint asks “Where is he now?” and Steve demands to know “What about Ross?”.
Steve hasn’t been good at following orders in a very long time – and he thinks about telling her just that, but they have

And she pats him on the shoulder, soft and gentle, a small reassurance being all she is able to give him now. Her hand lingers for a moment, hesitant, and they stare at each other for a split second before they both visibly crumble and pull closer for a hug, their breaths shaky and their bodies cold, and Steve remembers the only other time they hugged like this, right after Peggy’s funeral, and he suddenly wants to
Steve stops himself from just pulling Tony’s arm away to check his stomach, or from just putting his hands on him all over to check if he’s fine – he’s fine, he says he’s fine –, but of course Steve gives him a hand to stand up, and Tony gives him the Gauntlet hand.

He needs his workshop a little emptier. He needs his thoughts not to be so scattered, so filled with white noise, to focus only on the information on the board and nothing else.
He doesn’t startle. The housing case for the nanoparticles is on top of the nightstand, perfectly close to his reach, but thought of picking it up doesn’t even occur to him. Not because he’s over whatever leftover trauma might be hiding in the deep crevices of his mind, because he isn’t, and he’s adult enough to admit it – but because he’s tired, and the touch is gentle, almost fleeting, and warm; And Tony recognizes the weight and the shape of the body fitted against his easily, the head resting on his shoulder and the leg over his, the familiar press of her arm on top of him and the touch of her body against his ribs and hip, like they’re puzzle pieces slotting together. The tickle comes from her fingers, as they barely brush against the shape of the circular scar on his sternum, slightly raised tissue barely making a bump on the fabric of his faded T-shirt, her nails teasing sensation here and there on accident, because they’re too big and the nail polished is all chipped off. But the motion is elegant and soft, just like Tony always thinks of her.

As FRIDAY gathers herself to say the news, Tony hangs his head, his neck tired and achy from too long without proper rest, and the stretch of his tendons on his nape make his entire spine light up in tight pain as his head lulls forward. Still, he endures it, and doesn’t raise his head. It’s too heavy.
Tony knew this would happen. He’d known. The feeling had been creeping up to him since the cave, the array of weapons with his name embezzled on the side, a mockery of his dream, of his morality, and he just hadn’t realized it yet. Hard to do so, when he was counting the days until the Ten Rings finally decided they had enough of him, until he finished the Mark I, until he was

his throat tight around the words he doesn’t want to let out. His jaw does that twitchy thing again, neck muscles jumping out as if he’s hiding a flinch of pain, and just when Tony thinks he’s about to try to shift the conversation away from himself, miraculously, he says, “Mine were memories too. From before the ice. They weren’t… I wasn’t actually

And he had agonized over it, of course. Of course he would have. When they conducted tests and trials to analyze the extent of Wanda’s powers Tony read all the reports. He sent in a bunch of simulation protocols and suggestions and dutifully poured hours into the charts and results, the footage and the annotations, and made sure no equipment would ever go amiss for her training, just like the others. He helped to get her Visa request going, he put in a good word for the press when they frowned upon adopting “Ultron’s little witch” into the team, he smiled and nodded at her when they saw each other on the sporadic meetings he had with the team.
“I’ll make sure to write that down on my report.” Ross sneers.

“Your Highness.” All three of them greet at the exact same time − but then, Natasha immediately keeps talking, her tone incredibly respectful and professional, even if a little rushed. “Thank you for allowing us entrance.

“There are six Infinity Stones, ever since the creation of the Universe.” Thor drawls, the same way Tony imagines prophets or storytellers of myths to speak, voice dragged by memories of things too vast and too ancient for others to comprehend.
Steve wants to ask.
“What good would it do?” Steve questions. “Bucky wasn’t himself, I thought he wouldn’t even remember, and HYDRA was still out there. It… It had been so long ago. Tony would get angry, he would want to get revenge. Why would I allow that to happen?”
“Tony?” Rhodey calls, softly, and Tony blinks drowsily as he steps back and stares at his best friend, his eyesight blurry and unfocused like a bad camera lens, and the look of concern in Rhodey’s face is so compassionate and familiar that it aches in Tony’s chest, the sort of comfort only Rhodey could ever give him, in the right measure, at the right time.

It’s not a waste of time, talking about these things. It’s not. Not just because it is true that they need to know if Bruce has been having some sort of problem with the Hulk – but they’re also about to throw themselves back into a fight, the fight of their lives, after almost three years without seeing each other. They don’t have time to train. They’re gonna have to wing it. And they… They have been separated for years. Tony hasn’t seen them in three years, even longer than Rogers and the others. And the circumstances definitely weren’t the same. Tony has missed Thor and Bruce—

“I didn’t save you, Tony. I just was there for you when I could.” Pepper tilts her head, crows feet wrinkling at the corner of her eyes so beautifully when she gives him an awkward smile, and he loves her so much it hurts. “But I don’t know if I can anymore.”
“It’s ok.” Tony says, even when he knows Nebula won’t believe him, but he has to silence her and let FRIDAY speak, or else he will lose the courage. “I can take it.”

Or maybe he didn’t die then, but he climbed out of the car, confused and scared,
“Thor, we gonna need some clarification on that, buddy.” Tony tells him, turning around to look at him, just as Rogers and Natasha do the same.
Thor steps closer, eager to contribute. “The first Stone he got was the Power Stone. It was the only Stone in his Gauntlet, until he found us on the ship and stole the Tesseract.”

“You’re not flying the armor to DC.” Natasha orders again, through gritted teeth, as she paces in heavy steps towards the elevator. “Get in the Jet.”
He cries, and Nebula doesn’t comfort him – because she doesn’t know how –, and neither does anyone else – because they
Okay so, last minute warnings! If this is your first foray into my fics, I strongly recommend you check out the Part 1 of this series, which not only will give you an idea of how I usually go about my stories, but also includes a lot of important details to this part of the series. Of course, you can just roll with it, I certainly can’t stop you, but I’ve already begun filling in plot holes since part 1, so it’d be interesting to give that one a try as well. Fair warning though, if we have any very intense Team Cap members in the audience, it’s going to be tough for you. Just letting you know, I am Team Iron Man and it shows. There is a No Character Bashing tag there, but not everyone has the same reaction to it, I’m afraid. If it’s not your thing, just let it go.
Like he has cried everything he had inside him, and now there’s almost nothing left.
“You take him to museums and buy him art?”
“Alright. Okay then.” He says, in careful pauses. “Listen, Tony, I wanted – Yesterday, that was shitty, and it didn’t need to happen. We both got way over our heads, and we both said some things we didn’t mean, but we don’t got time to be fighting like kids over a damn toy, so… I guess I – We – No hard feelings, alright? Can we agree on that? Let’s just get this over with, we find the bastard and we do our job, no need for us to fight each other like we’re the enemy.

Tony doesn’t say a word.

The thing about Howard Stark is that he is

Rogers and Romanoff look distinctly uncomfortable at the idea, and Tony can’t blame them.

It takes a moment for Tony to fully process what that information
(That’s not the problem, Cap.)
The thing is—Steve really misses the life he used to have. Which is funny, in a very cruel way, because he didn’t think it was possible for him to feel like that. For a long time, he thought he would never find any kind of normalcy in this strange new world, because for days on end, all he could think of was everything he missed from
“You want something?” Tony interrupts, as politely as he can manage without losing the hard steel in his tone, feeling immediately caged even though Thor barely gave two steps forward into the workshop. “I assume FRIDAY told you I was here.”

“Is Happy with you?” Tony urgently asks, throwing darks thoughts aside the best he can, even if it’s not much help at all. Now is not the time for self-pity. Now is not the time to sit down and cry about his own ridiculous fallings. He needs to know what happened. He needs to know how deep the cut is, how hard the blow.

than how he feels at the moment. It makes him panicky, it makes him itchy, and he doesn’t like it. It took him so long to get used to the idea that he’d have to add cameras to the back of his armor because there would be no one there to watch his six; through it all, Rhodey never let him down, never once, and their fighting style has become second nature for them.
But soon.

Steve can’t disagree, so he merely gives her a sympathetic smile.

But he steps back, like Rogers warned him to, and here lies the problem. They will always follow Rogers, and Tony cannot work with him. He thought he could, or he tried to convince himself that he could, but he sees now that that was a lie.

Pepper is pivotal to Tony's story. Not only because he loves her, or because she's been there since the beginning, even if those are very important things - But because Pepper brings to the table a unique opportunity to discuss one of the core subjects of any Iron Man story:

, this time. God, he wishes it wasn’t so hard on him, that he wasn’t so messed up – he wishes he could admit how much he missed Tony, how hellish the past years have been on him, how he learned things about himself he had no idea existed and it took a lot of pain and arguing and worrying, but he’d

Steve is sitting on the sofa, sketching carefully, because this notebook is nearly filled already and he really doesn’t want to ruin the last page. It’s a picture of Tony, working on the armor with a sharp look on his face, the fiery spark of excitement burning in his eyes, and it nearly makes Steve sigh like a lovesick teenager. It’s ridiculous. He just… He’s just

No one is alright, but they have to do something, because if they don’t, soon enough they’ll be wiped from Earth just like everyone else was.

“Well, it seems he knew what he was carrying, at least.” Bruce muses. “They were being cautious. Guess this is why Wong warned us about the spells. Some of them mention Time Loops and Time Reversal and all sorts of stuff that could literally break the universe.”
The Compound is silent when he arrives.

Steve frowns even though he is trying to keep his expression neutral and attentive. “You’ve been in touch?”
The red panic bar stands there before Tony, a mocking guardian of freedom, a cosmical fucking

Shuri’s voice echoes in his ear, bold and firm, and a shiver runs through Steve’s spine like a lightning bolt.
Tony has never been the kind of man to run away from a fight.
“That’s why we’re gonna follow you into this fight, and that’s why they will too.” Rocket says, after a breath to recompose himself, sounding much more confident. “We’re all in this for something that’s worth it, ya’ know?”
He does, but not the most efficient strategy.
he knew. But he is alone, why isn’t anyone here, where has everyone gone!?
“Was it now?” Steve teases, and Tony has to lock all his muscles like they’re made of stone to prevent himself from shivering.
And hope they won’t fall apart.
(To his face, at least.)
“There are other ways to fix this.” Pepper insists, and then, she finally turns to him, and to see her face is even worse than to stare at her back, because before she felt distant, and now, she feels so close, too close to his heart, to the gaping wound that simply refuses to heal, to that soft point in his carefully constructed façade that no one except her can reach. “You can't just jump into a spaceship and go to space looking for some…

“You can imagine my surprise,” Thor emphatically says, almost as if he’s daring Tony to contradict him, words drawing out in a knowing tone. “When I was told you arrived from space – when you shouldn’t even have survived, given your conditions –, but you did, and you had a woman with you, a
Steve laughed and thereby attracted the attention of the infants, who approached the couple.
Of course they didn't leave him in peace so soon; but, little by little, the conversation turned towards other things, although they never left the Christmas topic that Tony hated.
It was then that Tony jumped up and denied repeatedly. He was not a suitcase, far from it; He wasn't going to allow himself to be humiliated like that, less his boyfriend. He put on his coat and watched how Steve let out a chuckle.
“We’re going to dinner with a friend, the one who introduced us”
“Hey," without opening his eyes, Tony called out to him and gently pulled his boyfriend's wet hair, “hey, wait. If we don't get out soon my mother will come looking for us.”
“I'm talking to the dog, not the fleas.”
“It’s not like I could have a family with a guy” he said, spinning his own thoughts.
sounded as he did so.
Tony looked at him carefully. He was a handsome guy, very handsome, fuck! More than that, he was sexy. Even seated, he guessed that he was taller than he was; his arms, sticking out of the sleeves of his simple blue shirt, looked terribly strong; had blond hair, neatly combed to the side and back; and he wore a thick, manly beard.
“By the way, Gregory will come” he said “With his children”
“He's a captain” Tony pointed out, he had finally managed to swallow and was happy to be able to say something that would help “He is not only an agent”
“Tell him, Tony!” Natasha encouraged him.

Pepper was wearing a green wool sweater and some earrings that looked like frosty spheres; Rhodey was wearing a laughable sweater with a huge red-nosed Rudolph in the center; Bruce was also dressed in a Christmas sweater, only his was of small crowns and mistletoes; And even Natasha, who also participates a little bit in these parties, had succumbed and wore a headband with reindeer antlers on her reddish hair. Was he the only sane person in the world?
“Are you telling me that Santa made you for me?”
Steeeeveee!! I love this chapter! If you see any spelling mistakes or something that is not understandable, just let me now. All credits to Aomame_kz.
But Steve softly denied, and smiled at him.
“It’s cute, Tony,” he looked down to see his mother, with whom he was dancing at the time.
"Everyone calls him Tony!" shouted Rhodey, who was dying of laughter.
“You too” Steve smiled kindly at her.
“And how did you meet?”
A goofy grin crossed Tony's face for a second, second he realized and erased it.
“Exactly" ‘let's see’, Tony said to himself, ‘how good you are at inventing an identity’.
“And?”
“It’s not the end of the world. But it’s cute to have a partner”
Tony looked up. A shaft of light shot into the sky, along with the fascinated laughter of his nephew and niece. But he did not see the colored sparks, but his "boyfriend" with the children. Steve felt his gaze and turned his face, when their pupils met, he smiled and winked at him. Tony gulped.
“Just as you hear it, I woke up and had under a tree (which I didn't put) a blond, muscular and blue eyed gift.”
“True”
Had Santa arranged that too? What else?
“What? Are you drunk?”
Hello! Sorry fo the late update. Enjoy! All credits to Aomame_kz
“Eh?”
“Yes, mom, don't worry," Howard joked again.
Update! Yay!!! Hope you enjoy it. All credits to Aomame_kz.

“Change of partners!” Howard yelled again, and scooped up his granddaughter.
“Gone?” He repeated. His mother came out then and called everyone to dinner. “We’ll talk later,” he told her and hung up.
“What happens” said Rhodey “Is that you are a Grinch”
“Natasha is right” said Bruce “Sometimes, you don't know you needed something, until you have it”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come here," he said, as he patted one of his legs “I'll listen to you”
Tony didn't answer, his gaze was fixed on their newly joined hands. He felt the colors rise to his face; and he decided to shut up and look out the window at the passage of the streets. But he did nothing to reverse the contact with the other. Actually, he realized, he didn't want to.
“Little Tony, did you grow up?” she said confused, Tony blushed again with shame, while Steve, once again, held back his laughter. The aunt looked up and had to adjust her glasses to focus better “Hey! You're not my little Tony!”
“Point is to endure him for more than one day” Pepper added incisively.

That was enough for the blond to take his eyes off the raspberry tartlets and smile at him, with that tender and white smile, identical to the one he gave him in the apartment as he sat next to the Christmas tree.
“We all know” said Natasha, and Bruce nodded playing with a decorated donut in front of Tony, just to bother him “What you don't want is to go to your parents' house”
Howard shrugged.
Natasha laughed, and assured that they would meet him on the end of the year holidays.
“I already know that! What I mean is...”
“I will be” she said and sat down on the couch “You look like a grandpa with your pajamas on so early and on Christmas Eve”

“Of course it is!” said Tony with his mouth full.
There, in his living room, sitting on the floor, next to a Christmas tree that wasn't there the night before, was a young man. Tony looked at him stupefied and then at the tree.
“It was a smooth flight. And thanks, I left it a long time ago”
The details would escape him later, but he would remember very clearly the almost graceful way Steve removed his clothes. The caress of his hands, warm palms and cold fingertips, down his back. The brush of Steve’s skin against his and the heat emanating from his mouth, along with the delicious taste of his tongue. He will remember the pain, which did not taste like pain, having him inside; the morbid and wet sound of each thrust. The passionate and at the same time considerate, overflowing and gentle way that Steve made love to him that Christmas night, would be tattooed in his memory. And above all, he will keep the feeling that aroused in his chest, like a flame that had been dimmed for years and that, suddenly, was a bonfire of thousands of degrees centigrade devouring him. He felt genuinely loved and, in return, he loved genuinely. Even both ecstatic and involved in that frenzied dance, they said it. They said very clearly: I love you. And neither would have had reason to suspect that the other was lying. There was no room for lies between their skins, much less disbelief.
“Rogers... not bad. And what do you do for a living, Steven Rogers?”
“Well then, good night, dear. And Howard, come here, don't run away!”
Everyone nodded.
Tony looked at him with his mouth open. What the fuck...?
He looked for his keys, willing to go to the mall; but before he could even get close to the door, he felt Steve's hand gently grab his arm.
“That was before I met James”
“We have to go” Steve spoke to him familiarly, as he pulled out a small suitcase from under the tree. He was ready to go “Can I help you with your bags?”
"Mom says married people have children."
“He cooks marvelously, I don't know how he is single being soooo handsome”
“Oh, Stevie! Can I call you like that?” Maria Stark was delighted, so delighted that she had already hung on the arm of the blond without any shame.
(What does she want?)
"We got replies from nearly two thousand agents, and we might have more incoming in the next hours." Natasha quietly informs him, her tone all business, diverging the attention of the conversation to a different topic. “Steve, Rhodes and Pepper are downstairs, talking to the agents who made it here.”
(What a funny guy you are, Rogers.)
cut off at the middle of a breath, surprised and confused. Natasha frowns so deeply her face must hurt, so many questions dancing behind her eyes, but she won’t say a word. Sam looks like he has completely given up trying to understand what is going on in Steve’s mind.
