Steve chuckled and opened his door. Inside was a neat looking office. There was a large desk in the middle of the room with a plush chair behind it. There was still papers scattered across it, one of which had a pen laying on it, like the owner had left only temporarily, planning on coming back. To add to that feeling was a a half-full brandy glass, sitting next to one of the paper piles.
“Iron Man, what can you tell me about this place? Use the comm so everyone can be up-to-date.”
“Clint? Clint, where are you?” Steve's voice called.
Bruce nodded, moving closer to it, inspecting the intricate carvings on the side.
“That explains the tea, kinda,” she said to herself, shutting the door behind her as she moved to the next room.
“Get everyone out of here, babe,” Tony said smiling weakly up at him before erupting into another bloody coughing fit. His vision was starting to narrow and he was finding it hard to focus now.
“You've got to be kidding me.” Tony growled before he ran at the makeshift blockade, intending to plow straight through it. He was halfway to it when the chairs began to fly at him. The first ones he slammed right through, but when three hit hit at once with a surprising amount of force he found himself flying backwards through the wall into the kitchen.
He collapsed then, falling into Steve's strong arms. Tony started coughing up blood, the shrapnel hitting his heart finally. His mask was ripped up and Steve was staring at him with teary eyes.
Bruce was about to reply but settled for rolling his eyes when Iron man began to speak.
'I’m sorry Clint, I can't keep my promise, I’m not coming' was the last thing Steve thought as his last breath escaped him.
Steve nodded. “Iron Man and I will take this floor then. Keep communication and meet back here when you are done.”
“Calm down, please, Clint, you need to calm down and tell me where you are. Listen to me, I’m coming for you. Okay, do you hear me? I’m coming for you, I promise,” he said this as he used his leg to move the table of of his way, thanking God that he wasn't being attacked yet. “Where are you, Clint?”
“We will search every room. I will take the ones on the left and you the right.” she said, looking back at the God.
He nudged Steve with his elbow and motioned to the stove. Steve nodded and they both made their way over to it. They stood on either side of the old appliance and Iron Man pulled it open in one swift motion. A cloud of smoke spilled out and Steve retched, covering his face even tighter. Tony leaned down to look inside and regretted it the moment he did. The man they were after was stuffed inside, skin charred, his mouth open in a silent scream.
“They do to!” Clint argued.
“I'm not leaving withou-” Steve was cut off when Tony's hand closed around his throat. He looked down in shock and Tony's dead face stared back.
“Then we're going to have to go in after him,” Captain America announced and Tony rolled his eyes. Leave it to Steve to want to go into the creepy ass house.
“Tony I’m not leaving you. Tony, TONY!” Steve practically screamed, shaking Tony's now limp body, tears rolling down his face. He knew Tony was gone now and there was nothing he could do about it. Yet, he couldn't help but feel guilty. He should have stopped Tony. He should have been the one who tried to break through. Sure, Tony had a metal suit covering his entire body, but Steve had a shield and he was a lot stronger, he would have been fine.
“Tony's dead.” his voice cracked when he said that and he felt a heartbroken hollowness fill him all over again. “Are you still in the basement? Are you safe?”
“As you say. I shall inform you should I find anything.”
“I'll take this one,” Tony said, motioning to the one he was closest too. Steve nodded, he never did speak much when they were on a mission, and opened his own door.
And that’s when the pain started. He could feel something stabbing through the middle of his chest, right where the arc reactor is. He cursed his luck as he reached a shaky hand up to grab at the large, splintered piece of wood sticking out of his chest. What were the chances that he would get something in his most vulnerable spot.
“I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation for all of that,” Bruce replied.
“Thanks for the history Iron man,” Natasha said.
Thor came into the room and gave her a confused look. “What it is you needed?”
“Whatever,” Hawkeye just gave him a dirty look and moved on, pulling off the sheet faster than they had been before.
“You're kidding, right?” Hawkeye asked, “That place looks like it'll go paranormal on our asses if we go in there.”
And Clint did run. He ran to the other side of the room, stopping when he reached the far wall. He searched frantically for a way a out, a place to hide, anything. He almost cried in relief when he spotted the small door in the corner, just large enough for him to be able to crawl through.
“Tony. Tony. Tony, are you there? Whats going on?”
Natasha just nodded before moving to her first door. She opened it and looked inside. It was a simple sitting room. There were plush chairs in a semi-circle around a table in the center of the room. The table was covered in a fancy looking tea set and when she looked closer she could see the tea still sitting in the cup.
“You're such an ass,” Clint snapped.
“You're never going to leave. You and you're friends will be here forever.”
“Well can we hurry it up, this place is giving me the creeps...”
“I can't tell you. If I tell you they'll find me. Get yourself and Stark out. Don't worry about me. If I go out they'll kill me, they'll all kill me.” he knew it was true, sorta. He had the feeling that they knew where he was, but for some reason they weren't coming to get him. There was something special about this crawlspace that was keeping them out.
“You knew, Clint. Why didn't you stop us from coming in? You could have saved me. It's your fault, but if you come at it will be all better. I promise, I will make it better. When have I ever broken a promise to you? You know I love you, Clint. I'll forgive you if you come out.”
Thor ran after her and flipped the bed to the side, where it smashed against the wall, but she wasn't there. He ran out of the room, checking all of the other rooms, turning any furniture that got in his way into piles of shattered wood.
Thor took a step towards her, but when he did the grip on her leg tightened and she was swept off her feet. She clawed at the wooden floor as she was pulled underneath the bed in one swift motion, disappearing with a scream.
“Guys, it doesn’t matter, we're going in whether you like it or not.” Captain America intervened, already starting up the path.
“Come out and play a game with me. I’m not very good at hide and seek. Lets play something else.”
“You're a coward, Clint. You always were.”
“Bruce, mirror, took him. Their everywhere,watching listening. They took Bruce. They took him. They're going to get me too. I can hear them everywhere. Their house, 's their house.” Clint babbled on and on, making less sense as he went, starting to cry
Inside she found an elegant bedroom. There was a large bed against the opposite wall, what looked like a large closet, a dressing screen and a giant wooden vanity. Natasha stepped inside and looked around. The room was neat and she made her way to the closet. It was empty save for the moth-eaten clothing.
“Tony! Are you alright?” Steve came into the room after him, helping him out of the wreckage.
“What do you mean 'paranormal'?” Thor said and Clint looked like he was about to cough up a hairball.
“No, No. You're dead. You, you killed yourself. YOUR DEAD.” Clint screamed, backing away as his father just laughed, following him down.
His father was standing there, staring down at him.
“I don't think were alone here,” he said as he shut the stove, a scream sounding from upstairs seconds later.
He stood up again shakily, blood pouring down his face from the empty sockets where his eyes once were. He was slammed back into the wall again, then the other one and back again before he was finally thrown into the tub. Steve sat up immediately, thrashing and gasping for air.
“I'm not gone, Clint. I will always be with you.”
“You know we'll find you, we find e-e-e-everyone.”
“Just forget it,” Clint snapped, turning away to look at the giant mirror he had just uncovered. “That's a big mirror.”
“Clint, Hawkeye, what are you talking about who's gone? Who are 'they'?” the sheer terror and sorrow he could hear in Clint’s usually cocky voice seemed so out of place it only put Steve on edge more.”
“I'm stuck.” was all she said in reply.
“After you.”
“Who knows? Maybe,” Bruce shrugged, “We won't know till we check.”
“Clint,” Bruce began.
Natasha opened the door and peeked inside before motioning that it was safe. They went in one by one and fanned out in the wide entryway. The wood floor creaked loudly underneath their weight and Tony couldn't help but be grateful that Bruce wasn't hulked out right now. From what they could see where they stood there was a hallway that connected to the rest of the main floor, a flight of stairs that went up and next to them a flight of stairs that went down.
“Oh God, what is that smell?” He groaned, “It smells like burning flesh.”
Clint was too afraid to answer, to move. It might be a lie. They could be playing another trick on him, trying to lure him out. He curled up tighter as the voices outside continued on, Bruce's voice joining them.
“He's gone, he's gone. They took him, he's gone.” Clint rambled when he turned on his comm, more to himself than to Steve.
“You should have stayed out of this house.”
The last thing Thor heard was Captain America screaming Tony's name. Then the window exploded, shattering the parts of him that were in it and imbedding its piece in the rest of him. 	Everything went black.
“I do not! I just have good intuition and there is something wrong with this place.”
“I was just stating the truth, there is a reasonable explanation for everything,” Bruce retorted, starting to count backwards slowly in his head.
“Do you actually think he's down here?” Clint asked suddenly.
“Safe? Never safe. Can't trust you eyes, it's a lie it all a lie. Trust nothing, trust no one. Only out is safe. Never left, none of them. No one ever leaves. Go. Go now or they'll get you, Steve. Not real, nothing is real. They're playing with you're head. It's a game. All a game. Out is win. Out is safe.” He rambled, he felt like he was losing his mind. Nothing made sense anymore and it just made it worse that he knew he was going to die. They were all going to die.
“You knew, you knew all along.” That was Natasha's voice.
“And I shall accompany her,” Thor added.
Clint didn't even have the chance to scream.
“Ah, fuck, yeah, but I think Clint was right,” Tony groaned as he got to his feet. He was about to ask Jarvis to check the state of the suit and maybe call for back up when everything went black.
“He went into that house,” Black Widow, said pointing to the large, fenced off, house. The place definitely looked like it had seen better days and it didn’t look like a great place to hide. Not that the guy they were after was the brightest crayon in the box.
“Of course its our house, but it's going to be yours as well when you come out.”
Tony gave him a confused look before glancing around the room, his gaze resting on the stove. It was on.
"Yeah, hon, I can see it."
"My father tried his best to convince me to change my mind, even stooping so low as to deny me his blessing to marry Joseph, but by that point I didn't care." She gave Peter such a melancholy smile that tears sprang to his eyes. "I was young, and in love, and I thought Joseph and I could take on the world together."
“Yeah,” says Steve.  He read a few articles that referenced the same thing, including a couple that mentioned that Howard and Tony had a bad falling out regarding that weapons business that led to Tony moving out to New York.
"Oh, no, he wasn't really mad," said Peter. "You know Uncle Clint likes to act all gruff and stuff, but he's really a big softie when it comes down to it. And Pietro and Wanda told me that he and Auntie Nat are almost as overprotective as you and Dad."
"Doing a final sweep of the perimeter now, and all I'm seeing is a lot of debris," said Sam. "Looks like we did it, guys."
"Ah!" Peter cried, another ice bolt rocketing down his back just as Thanos' right arm broke free, his fingers immediately wrapping around Gamora's neck.
"Tony!" Steve shrieked over the comm, obviously frantic. "Tony, are you guys all right?"
He surged forward then, catching Tony's lips in a desperate kiss as the three agents yanked on his arms, tearing him away. Tony immediately lunged for him, only to be stopped by Agent Bartlett's palm on his chest.
"But, Papa, it's
It's a bit hard for me to admit that the story is over! I can't thank all of you enough for all of the support you guys showed me through this entire series!
good.
as he flew up right next to Steve, waving at him from the cockpit of an X-301. "Now, get the hell outta here and get this done!"
"Oh, that's good," Peter breathed, his cheeks flaming hot. He set down his cup and took Gwen's hand, leading her over to the dance floor. As soon as they stopped Gwen wound her arms around his neck, resting her cheek on his lapel as his arms curled around her slender waist and pulled her close. He closed his eyes as they began to sway back and forth, breathing in the incredible scent of her gorgeous hair and biting his lip to keep the tears in.
"I've got you, honey," Tony murmured, over and over as he stroked Steve's hair. "I love you. We're gonna be okay."
"Okay, so, I really think we need to run through the plan again, Steve," said Colonel Rhodes. "Just so we're all clear."
Steve Rogers, the skinny, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn who never went a day without getting picked on by bullies is now not only a Summa Cum Laude graduate from Camp LeHigh University and in a relationship with a great guy, he is also an Olympic champion.
"JARVIS, launch Pete's nanite suit from the Compound!" he heard Dad say, sounding like he was under water.
Tony huffed, his frown deepening for a moment even as concern flitted across his eyes.
Stunned, they both stood there for a few seconds, with Gwen's breath hot on Peter's neck and her nose nearly touching his chin, sending a shock of such intense warmth across Peter's chest and up his neck that for a moment he literally forgot how to speak, much less think. She was
This chapter is in Steve’s POV.  Please remember he is suffering from untreated PTSD here, which this chapter attempts to portray.  Please be safe 💖
Sam shrugged. "Coffee shop okay with you?"
"Uhh, you too?" Peter cringed as Dad shot Uncle Thor a downright murderous look, causing him to sputter as he pushed Peter back to his spot.
be constantly breaking the above mentioned knuckles. Don't you think?"
“Yes, Master Peter,” JARVIS said.  “Please give me a moment.”
"I did get my essay done for Decathlon though," added Ned.
Tony hesitated.  “No, I’m not.  But if you don't mind sending me a reminder text this afternoon, I can promise that I’ll do it then.”
"Well, I think that went as well as we could've hoped," Steve said as they exited the restaurant. He was still plenty nervous, but the steadfast support of his teammates along with having a solid plan in place had worked to alleviate at least some of his concerns.
"Well, the thought is that if we happen to run into trouble, then the other guy might be kinda handy to have around," said Uncle Bruce. "But I also thought it sounded like a nice break from the grind, you know? Go on a little joyride into space before getting back to the real work?"
spreading across the lake like a massive layer of glass to trap his boys beneath the surface.
"Quite likely, sir."
"Strange!" Dad screamed as he was once again repelled by the glowing purple stone. "Strange, you gotta do something! He's gonna kill my boy!"
"Why don't we tuck you back into bed now, all right?" Steve said. He patted Tony on the shoulder, raising an eyebrow. "So he can get back to sleep? It is a school night, so—"
Which meant all of their suspicions had been spot on. General O'Brien's government—and Meridia's government as well, if there even was such a thing—had been deliberately prolonging the war in order to keep the citizens oppressed and themselves in power.
look. "I'm pretty sure I can't remember the last thing you tried that didn't work."
Creation, rather than destruction.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "So she's still at home with him?"
"Eh, don't worry about that now," Tony said dismissively as he cupped Peter's face, stroking his cheek with his thumb. "Are they treating you okay, bud?"
"Tony, it's okay," Steve said. "Just… come on through, all right? Bruce is here."
"He's gonna be all right, Bucky," said Steve. "You know Peter, he'll bounce back like he always does."
That explanation made a lot more sense, but somehow didn't help Peter feel any better. Papa had been missing for almost a month, and if this was what HYDRA had been doing to him all that time, then—
Tony paused, glancing at Steve as he drew in a deep breath. They had anticipated getting a question like this.
, Tony thought as he watched Steve climb down from his cockpit, tossing Tony a not-so-subtle wave over his shoulder as he headed towards his locker room. Since their first picnic date they'd been able to see each other every single night except two, and those were only because someone on the C-shift got sick and Steve volunteered to take their place.
"Ah huh," Bucky said, his expression eerily neutral. "Go on."
Steve pressed another kiss to Tony's cheek as the elevator came to a stop, the doors sliding open to reveal a pair of guards standing in front of the nurses' station and two more posted down the hall, on either side of the door to Peter's room. Already Steve had overheard various medical personnel whispering about the crowds of reporters that had gathered at the hospital entrances, just waiting to catch a glimpse of the Langaran heroes who had overthrown the military dictatorship and restored peace to the planet. Several members of the Air Corps had already given interviews with Colonel Phillips's blessing, including Carol, John, Cam, and Colonel Rhodes—
“Steve, this is not—
“Just not when you’re sleep deprived and on-edge and ten times more likely to crash the thing, of course-“
Tony could feel him smiling.
“he means he likes you wearing his clothes, but he’d prefer them back on his bedroom floor,” Bruce piped up, which was surprising, because everyone had assumed he’d just been napping on the tabletop.
“Sorry for the antisocial time,” the girl said swiftly, smiling with practiced politeness, “it was the only time today both me and Rhodey would be available. I’m Pepper, by the way.” She extended a perfectly manicured hand, and Steve, now feeling somehow as if he hadn’t gotten the memo and had instead come to this meeting thoroughly underdressed, just took it dazedly.
that would stop the room from feeling so cavernous and empty. That was absolutely not what they should be thinking at these meetings. Sam would have kicked his ass and talked to him about positive reinforcements.
Tony looked at him with blank confusion. This was not right. Steve should be angry with him. “You said you wanted to talk,” he muttered, “You said… after our fight, when I was a stupid asshole, you stormed out and then you called and said you wanted to… and you want to break up now. Which is fine. Well. It’s not fine, but I get it. I get it.”
Steve made a face. “Why are we keeping diapers in the condiment cupboard?”
“You should invest in a personal helper,” Steve said, getting to his feet with a sigh as Tony smiled at him, “or robots. You can make those, right? You created JARVIS,” he reached over and snagged the tool from the desk, before turning back around and tapping Tony over the back of the head with it.
was the person that, of course, Steve had gone and fallen head over heels for.
Steve blinked a few times and then sat up from the tub, looking over at Tony somewhat analytically. Tony looked back with a tired smile, letting Steve pull him in for another kiss, even when the other man’s hands were uncomfortably damp around his neck. Things you did for love, huh?
Okay, yeah- Peter could admit- this was definitely better than the fighting.
Tony watched him- the way his hands pushed into his face and wiped away the wetness over his cheeks, the way he tightened his jaw and took a deep breath in, trying to compose himself. He finally looked up at Tony with a small smile. “Things are gonna work out,” he said with a nod, “I promise.”
Steve smiled wryly. “Steve Rogers Original?” He asked, and when Tony laughed, it felt like music to his ears. All he’d seen of Tony these past 24 hours was a heart-breaking sadness. Laughter was a welcome change.
Until then, though, his work was done. He needed a break. Needed coffee. That was probably the reason he hadn’t stopped shaking since Steve had left. Just caffeine deprivation.
He hated Darcy. She was…. She was the worst. Putting stupid thoughts in his head.
. No, Steve, this is not something you should—”
“-And she was the only person back then who seemed to ask me about how my day was and really mean it,” he continued, eyelashes fluttering as he blinked. Tony hummed to show he was still actively listening, and Steve continued. “Anyway. After the Battle of New York, I didn’t see her again. Her stand was right underneath the tower, pretty much. I’m not… I don’t know whether she was among the dead. I didn’t see her name on the list, but…”
“What about the guys?” Steve cut in, mind casting back to that morning before he could stop it.
They'd had been played.
“I understand that you’re trying to look out for me,” Steve admitted after a moment, sighing loudly, “and I get that I haven’t been my best this year. But you- you can’t just hide me away from the rest of the world and refuse to let anything unpredictable touch me. I’m my own person and I won’t let you do that.”
Below him, he felt Tony shiver. “Oh my fucking god,” he blurted quietly, “Jesus fucking Christ that was hot.
are.”
any more. The line was a speck in the horizon. You- you just don’t
“You’ve been looking after me ever since I turned up here, actually,” Steve said before he could stop himself, and when Tony glanced up at him with a raised eyebrow, Steve hastened to continue. “You said- about not starting to look after me yet, but… but you have. For ages. With the party and the ride and- and stuff. I- I’m not sure why I said that? I just- yeah. I… yeah.”
Yeah. That was Steve. He’d know that body anywhere, thermal imagining or no.
The last thing he was aware of before he lost consciousness was the sound of Tony screaming his name.
“I was supposed to be able to save people,” Steve said suddenly, wiping his eyes with the heel of his palm, “the serum was supposed to… what use am I if I couldn’t even save the people who mean the most? What’s the point?”
Steve also noticed he had a bunch of things in his hands.
By the end of it, he is keeping track of every single one of them.
Tony looked at him for a moment as if he were holding back a soft smile, but he managed to disguise it with an exaggerated roll of his eyes and a huff as his head dropped back into Steve’s chest defeatedly. “Don’t make this all romantic,” he mumbled, “I was trying to be Extra.”
“—Because I
“Be expecting the cavalry at your door sometime soon,” Thor told him with a clap on the shoulder, wiggling his eyebrows mysteriously.
And Steve just wanted to know
Steve laughed, his head dropping forward so it was leaning against the couch cushions. “Yeah, you don’t look so great yourself, love,” he stated, which was admittedly true. Tony’s whole face was swollen and blotchy, his eye hardly visible and deep, angry bruises covering his face. It was going to take a while for him to heal up properly.
He felt tired. Bone-deep weariness that was difficult to shake. It clung to him like the rain did; sticking in his hair, coating his clothes with coldness. He just wanted to curl up and sleep- let the storm pass over his head until he awoke and it had all dissipated again. And more than anything, he wanted Tony.
Steve?
Steve poked at a floating piece of cereal and let his head rest in his hand. He still didn’t really feel like talking about it. “I’m better,” he agreed in the end, leaving it at that and hoping Sam wouldn’t push.
“You just want a good hiding spot in my damn tower, don’t you?”
no, we’re not here to… no. No, Steve, nothing happened to him, he’s probably fast asleep in his bed right now, I swear.”
However, Tony
Tony folded his arms and huffed. “You’re god damn right I am.”
When he got to Thor’s apartment, the door was already open, and he could hear the sounds of all his friends inside. It brought a smile to his face, and he snuck in quietly, letting the door close behind him and then taking in the scene around him.
Sam pulled a wry grin, shrugging. “Imagine I’m Steve and I
A lot of people had the hots for Tony. Not a big deal.
“You’re not listening to me!”
He stood, slowly. The world was cloudy. His eyes hurt, and he realized he must have been crying.
“How are you feeling?”
There was another round of agreement, and then Bucky loaded another cartridge into his gun, raising an eyebrow at everyone. “Onward and upward then, fellas?”
Thor nodded, pushing his hair back from his face and then rubbing two fingers over his eyes. Steve saw that there were purpling bruises over his knuckles. “Yeah, I know how you feel,” he responded, before sighing and then giving Steve another tight smile, “are you heading there right now?”
In hindsight, Steve probably should have told Medical about the weird heart palpitations. Or at least Tony. But at the time, it’d just seemed silly- he’d known that it would eventually recover after a day or two, and he’d sensibly assumed that until then he really wouldn’t have to worry about putting his body through anything overly strenuous.  Honestly, what were the chances of getting shocked twice in forty-eight hours?
“I’m sorry,” he said again, “I’m sorry for… all of this. I just…” he clenched his hands on his lap and looked out of the window. “There are some really awful people at my school. I got angry.”
“Not when the children are enhanced, they’re not,” Bruce told her sharply, “they have a bad track record and you know it.”
“He’s got enhanced strength, too,” Tony responded after a second of thought, pulling away from Steve’s hold with a small sniff. He needed to fucking compose himself. “Uh. The woman, she was an AIM scientist in charge of looking after him. Left video logs. She said his motor skills were exceptional for his age and he showed signs of an above-average strength. There’s probably more information in there. I—I’ll need to look it over—”
They went back to the compound, over in New York. The remaining Avengers—the ones who’d survived Thanos and his decimation, tried to evaluate it all. Natasha found some sort of pager left by Fury, and they hooked it up to a battery and kept it running, just in case. Of what, they had no idea. Salvation, maybe. Hope.
“Would you expect me to apologise on Armistice Day?” Steve asked quietly, “if I jumped because Thor popped his bag of chips too close to me and I nearly flipped a table? Would you think I needed to be sorry for that?”
It occurred to him whilst he glared at the back of Tony’s head that he actually had a shade of paint almost exactly the same color as Tony’s hair. Deep brown- maybe if he added in a few darker tones, some charcoal black or something, it would turn out almost exactly the same. He hadn’t drawn anyone in half a year, but he found himself… wanting, very suddenly, to put pen to paper and see if he could map out the entirety of Tony’s body, just from memory.
Steve tried so hard to open his eyes, to make that last final leap into consciousness so that he could see his baby again, but no matter how hard he tried, it wasn’t enough to will himself awake. Even now, he could feel himself slipping again, falling back down deeper, the voices getting further away.
Tony had stayed- put himself in danger day after day, gone through Steve yelling and insulting and hurting him- because he’d thought Steve was worth it. He couldn’t pinpoint quite why that felt so utterly soul-crushing, but it did. It did.
There was a moment where Bucky hovered on the other side, but after a few seconds it seemed he’d finished giving himself a pep-talk because Steve heard his hand go to the lock. When he pulled open the door, Steve glared at him.
the voice in his head screamed at him,
“I do wear it!”
Before Steve could even stop him. he’d lifted the hatch and stuck his head out into the room, spotting Clint as he tried to squeeze himself into a suitcase under his bed.
HYDRA. Brainwashing. Some panicking upon waking up. Well, a lot of panicking, really. His whole conversation with Tony—
Tony scoffed from behind him, and Steve turned curiously. “No. I just fixed her up, duh. Didn’t take much- I think she was just moody because I hadn’t shown her enough attention these past few weeks. She’s very temperamental,” Tony explained with a shrug- and right, yeah, that explained the grease stains and general disorderly look.
“I can’t handle the fireworks,” Steve blurted, and then immediately balked.
The sensation of unyielding stone told him that he was waking once more. It was a relief and a horror at the same time.
"Did you honestly believe that I would remain unguarded?" Thanos sneered in Steve's direction. He jerked his head over to where one of his minions stood a few metres away, one of the very same aliens who had landed in New York at the beginning of this whole mess.
wanted it to go well.
"No, no, it's nothing like that," Peter assured her. He pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his eyes with his knuckles. "I'm just—I'm sorry, Gwen, but I really gotta talk to my dads first, all right? I promise I'll tell you as soon as I can."
“I’ve always said that Pete’s the smart one, honey,” Dad said gently.  “So I’m thinking it’s a good day to listen to him.  Don't you?”
"More," Steve said as he wove his fingers through Tony's hair, his wedding ring pressing into Tony's scalp. "Please, mo grá, I need—"
was the stubborn one, how could he not see that Steve was only trying to protect him? "But, sweetheart, you're not genetically enhanced, so why would they—?"
"Yes, well… we'll have to catch up some more once this is all over, hmm?" said Uncle Thor. "Perhaps over a game of chess?"
"One year ago, we lost," he began. "We lost friends, we lost family. We lost a part of ourselves." Steve paused, his eyes flicking to Tony, who gave him a nod. "Today we have a chance to take it all back. Today we have a chance to take back the worst loss the Avengers, the world, and the universe has ever suffered. We're ready. We're trained, and we know the mission. Most of us are going somewhere that's familiar, but that doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives, and we're gonna win. Whatever it takes."
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, finally giving him a nod. "All right. But I would appreciate it if you'll let me do most of the talking, at least at first."
"Did you see any ships?" Steve suddenly asked, his heart starting to thud. "When you were flying here, did you happen to see any ships out there?"
"Thanks."
"All right, all right," Steve said as he checked the clock again. He had already been away from Peter longer than he felt comfortable with, and he could tell by Tony's non-stop fidgeting that he was antsy to return as well. "So that accounts for the Reality Stone, the Space Stone, and the Soul Stone. Thor, what about the rest?"
Gwen shook her head, her long ponytail swinging against her shoulders. "Oh gosh, it's okay! I just wish you would've told me ahead of time that you were allergic to peppermint, I could've had Mom make something else for dessert."
"Cindy told me she qualified for Academic Decathlon too," added Ned. "So I guess we'll be seeing her after school."
"Everything looks good from down here," said Tony. "Long as JARVIS gives you the go."
Sam's eyebrows shot up. "Well, then it's a good thing we've got it locked up pretty good."
"All right, all right, you guys," Steve said as he shooed them towards the elevator. "Go on and get packed, we're wheels up at 0215."
"Oh, thank you!" Steve rasped, grabbing onto the counter as his knees threatened to give way. He had been trying so hard not to give up on the possibility that Tony and Peter might come home to him, but now there was actually a real chance, he found he could barely keep himself upright.
and I'm just so scared that I'm gonna drown again!" His long fingers curled around Tony's forearm, pressing it into his chest. "I'm so
, it had said.  And how convenient indeed that it had already been seconded by three of the nine Stark Industries Board of Directors.
"You're as pink as a Maine lobster, honey," he said. "What the hell happened?"
Besides. How was Peter supposed to have known that Grandpa had created more of his super-secret serum to fix him? Not even Dad or Papa had known about it.
"Ah," answered Steve, slotting that information into its appropriate mental compartment. He was familiar with Colonel Rhodes, and the accident that had left him unable to continue flying.
, Steve thought.
"It's gone, Steve," Natasha said flatly. "The sceptre's gone."
"Uh huh. Don't work too hard though. I know you haven't gotten any sleep for awhile."
The fact that Peter was no longer deathly allergic to the things did help immensely.
"Same time?" asked Tony.
Steve thought.
Tony sputtered out a laugh, his beautiful brown eyes glassy as they locked with Steve’s.  “You're seriously the best thing to ever happen to us, so… how in the hell could I possibly say no?”
He was also hoping that after the proposal—as long as Tony said yes, of course—he could give up that apartment and move into the penthouse permanently.  Ever since he and Tony had spent their first night together, Tony had told Steve that he was welcome to stay in the penthouse whenever he wanted, which Peter later informed Steve was Tony’s way of telling him that he wanted Steve to stay with them, but still leaving Steve an out if he felt that he needed time away.
'Cause that was definitely
"I see," said JARVIS after a short pause. "According to the top medical texts published in this country, it is quite unusual for someone of Master Peter's age to not have already undergone corrective surgery. Most children with this type of defect have it surgically repaired prior to six years of age."
"Not yet, according to Fury," said Tony. "And so far no one's taken credit for it either."
“Oops.  Sorry dude,” the guy says as he hurries past Steve, leaping off of the train just before the doors slide closed.  Steve grunts as he gingerly rubs his sore shoulder, wishing he’d thought to put on his sling when he left the PT centre.
Sharp tears pricked Steve's eyes, and he swallowed hard, his hands fisting into the pillow clutched to his chest. Of course Peter would try to hide his own misery since he knew Steve was having frequent nightmares as well. Tony had warned Steve way back when he first moved in with them that Peter was often selfless to a fault, and Steve had personally witnessed it for himself many times.
The man never forgot anything. Not even some silly throwaway comment that Tony had made because he'd been too nervous to stop yammering.
“Well—” Obie started, cutting off when his voice cracked.  He attempted a smile, one that came out looking more like a sneer.
"Very good, sir."
"What's your name? Who did this to you?"
"Oh, so this is starting to become a thing now, hmm?" Tony said, rather cheekily. "You end up getting up way too damn early, which makes you want to take one of these afternoon naps of yours, which then only makes you wanna stay up all night again." He twisted around in Steve's arms so he could face him. "You do see where this is going, don't you?"
"Okay, so the moral of the story is, the phrase 'better late than never' absolutely does not apply here, hmm?" said Bucky.
"Well, I'm not going to apologise for it," Steve said as he wound his arms around Tony's waist, hugging him close. "You needed it."
"You mean another space attack?" Sam said. "Like the one—?"
"Oh, it wasn't just any wedding," said Grandma. "It was the wedding of the son of one of their top colonels. You see, despite the fact that the country was still technically a republic at the time, certain people inside the Air Corps were already starting to realise the power that they held, and already beginning to silence those who didn't agree with them. Whether the president knew about what was going on or not remains a mystery, but I'd be hard-pressed to be convinced that he didn't have at least some clue."
“He identified himself as Tony Stark,” Lorraine says.  “Which, I wanna say I’ve heard that name before somewhere, but I’ll be damned if I can remember where.”
it, especially when Morita told me he wasn't really given a choice on whether to hire him, said it was due to some state-mandated program giving jobs to disabled vets or something. But it's already been taken care of. I personally contacted Morita about it and Maria Hill has already informed the FBI, so Smythe isn't gonna be an issue any longer."
Thor reached for the last taco on the platter, breaking it in half. "Well, then it is settled. And I thank you again for allowing me to share in your evening meal with you, my wonderful friends."
"No, honey," Tony said as he tried to work his hand loose. "I need to get to the lab."
"What, so he's thinking that Killian or Stane somehow managed to buy off some of our guys before they kicked the bucket?" Tony asked, incredulous. "Really?"
Gwen's cheeks flushed that beautiful pink colour that Uncle Bucky always insisted meant that she like-liked Peter, and she gave him a rather shy smile, making no attempt to take her hands off of him. "Oh… um… I was just seeing if you were ready for lunch. Since Ned's out today, I wasn't sure if you'd remember where the lunchroom was."
"Yeah, I'm sure he did." Tony blew across the top of his mug before taking a generous sip, closing his eyes as the hot liquid worked its way down his throat. Having HYDRA out of the picture would eliminate a good amount of the stress that Tony carried, especially where Steve and Peter were concerned. HYDRA had been haunting Steve for over seven decades, a proverbial thorn in his side ever since he'd joined the army back in 1942.
Before Steve could even react, Thor himself was launched from the ground, hurtling through the air before crashing down at least two hundred metres away.
"No!" Peter squawked as panic washed over him like a wave. His eyes were completely useless now, his hearing dulled by blood rushing past his ears. He hadn't had a full-on asthma attack since Afghanistan, but suddenly the memories of how he had almost died in the middle of that desert came rushing back, only increasing his panic.
Taking a deep breath, Clint was the first to step forward, glancing down at the paper in his hands and looking to Nat, who nodded solemnly.
“What the Goddamn hell even happened?” Clint asked as he helped Steve back into a sitting position, “all we heard was a yell and then it was just static and we couldn’t contact you. We thought something had fucking exploded.”
Thor came back, four plates of buttery toast in his hand. Steve had no idea where Loki was, but he got the feeling he wouldn’t be coming down for his portion. Thor probably knew that too, although it didn’t stop him trying. Steve didn’t think he was ever going to give up. “Right, eat quickly,” Thor said as he glanced at his watch, “you’re already late for school, Steve. I’ll drop you off, but you won’t make it for registration.”
“Fuck, your guy’s filthy fucking rich,” Bucky’s eyes were at his hairline as he stared at the little Stark Industries logo in the corner of the tab, “and also an heir to one of the biggest businesses in the world.”
furious.
He looked up at Steve as he entered, and smiled brightly. “Hey, Steve,” he waved in front of him, and Steve frowned, watching as the multi-coloured slinky went over and over and over, “I just solved the mystery of creating perpetual motion… and guess what I’m using it for?
“Guilty,” was all Steve said, before rolling himself on top of Tony, elbows resting against the bed to stop his weight from crushing into Tony’s arc reactor. He leaned down a little, kissing Tony’s nose. “Happy birthday, darling,”
“We might,” the bigger one shrugged casually, sneer curling on his lip, but Steve didn’t quail under it. It wasn’t even a decent sneer. “You might wanna watch yourself, Rogers.”
“I don’t… I don’t want you to punch him, Bucky,” Steve said irritably, rubbing his face, “and he will come. He’s probably just busy or something.”
Steve huffed, amused despite himself. “Show off.”
Steve turned back to the window, which was about where the whole day started to go downhill.
But he knew, as soon as he heard those words from Rumlow’s mouth, that this was genuine. Footage that clear couldn’t be faked. Words that enunciated couldn’t be computer-generated.
Steve laughed again, and then Tony suddenly felt himself moving as Steve wrapped a strong arm around Tony’s waist and pulled, until he was lying directly on Steve’s chest. “We have to get up. Got that early conference in Austria, remember?”
“Don’t you just want to fucking bundle him up when he’s like this? How do you resist, Steve?” Clint asks, and Tony glares at him and turns to Steve, ready to hear a witty quip in reply, but the other man is just spluttering a little incoherently, eyes still fixed on the pale blue button-down that’s pretty much slipping right off Tony’s shoulders.
, and I would pull the stars out of the fucking sky just to make you happy, and I know that you’d do exactly the same for me.”
Except he hadn’t. He hadn’t done anything.
Tony’s eyes twinkled. “They definitely seemed like they were only holding on by the skin of their teeth,” he said in amusement, as Steve just scowled and turned away.
He pushed back slowly, and Tony let him go, staring at his bloodshot eyes in concern. His jacket had little droplets on the left shoulder. “Are you okay, Steve,” he asked softly. “It wasn’t… too much, was it?”
“Get the
that went ignored.
They drove mostly in comfortable silence, arriving at Lina’s with time to spare before their reservation, which was pretty much unheard of for the two of them. And of course, as soon as they got there it was a battle. Tony was determined to get Steve to try something new on the damn menu, but of course, Steve just wanted to stick with what he god damn knew.
Silence fell. Distantly, Steve heard the clock ticking—eleven minutes past eleven. He thought about wishing. But his mind was too full, and the idea didn’t settle.
Steve shook his head, a twisted smile on his face as he looked out of the window. “And when we get a knock on our door with a little family of kids dressed up as vampires, my Ma will smile at them, because she never turns people away at the door, even on Halloween. But then the parents will see the teeth in our grin, and they’ll realise we’re the real deal, and suddenly she’ll start pulling her kids away, because it’s alright to dress up as one, but it’s a completely different fucking thing to
This wasn’t right. Tony wasn’t just
that mission report by tomorrow morning, do you understand?”
Bucky just smacked her hand away with a scowl. “Be nice, she’s had a tough day,” he said. “Also, I’d like to just say that whoever had the bravery to frogmarch both Thor and Natasha from any building is a person that I have the utmost respect for.”
Steve blinked again, fingers tracing across the picture clipped to the corner of the file. His head felt a little dull, like someone had just pressed pause on all trains of thought, but the familiar wrench of his heart at the sight of the other man was still present under his sternum, stealing the breath from him. In the corner of the room the clock gave a particularly loud tick, its hollow knocking bouncing around in Steve’s brain. “Why are you giving me a file of Tony Stark?” He asked, voice low and wary as he turned his eyes back to Fury. He didn’t pick up the file.
Steve eyed it blankly. It didn’t… it didn’t make sense. Why was Tony-
Tony glanced at him before sticking up his middle finger. “Yeah,” he agreed, “God help me, I do.”
Michael sighed. “Please, we don’t have to make a big deal out of this, guys. We know that you have a child on the premises. Multiple people have made calls to say as such. Just make life easier and tell us where he is, and we can move forward without having to take legal action.”
Tony twisted around, looking at him in embarrassment. “Please forget they ever did that and ignore whatever they said, it is lies and they’re both getting their asses beat the next time I see them.”
Steve cocked his head. “Oh yeah?”
“It’s not that funny,” Steve muttered moodily, whilst Tony just nodded against his shoulder.
“Why can’t you just fucking clean up after yourself?” Steve snapped at him as he shoved the plates into the dishwasher and then shut it with a slam, “it’s literally so easy. Eat, finish, put away. That’s it, Tony, Jesus Christ-”
“You’ve always been different, Steve,” Tony told him, a broken smile flitting across his face, “it’s how we managed to do this for so long. I thought- I thought maybe they’d last forever. I was selfish and stupid and I was so desperate to believe it I didn’t… I didn’t think about the fact it might affect you. And it’s obvious now that it has. We were wrong. You aren’t immune to my magic, and I can’t stop it. You don’t-
Steve felt his smile stick a little. Of course he was fine, he wasn’t the one lying in a hospital bed. Nothing had happened to
angry words resonating in the room. He didn’t know what the hell he was doing. Seemed the other guys in the room didn’t either, by the way they were looking at him. But he didn’t care. He just had to stop this. He
“Ah, he arrives at last,” Clint declared as Steve flopped heavily onto the spot Tony’s foot had been saving for him seconds earlier, “where’ve you been for the past ten minutes then?”
“No, sweetheart,” Steve told him, “no, it really isn’t. We’re people, and we’ve been through a lot. Being perfect every day is never going to happen.”
He grabbed his phone from the nightstand and dialled the familiar number, knowing she would probably still be awake at this time. And of course, it only took three beeps until the call connected, Natasha’s breathless voice speaking down the line. “I’m in the middle of a workout, Rogers. This better be good.”
Instead, he raised an eyebrow and stepped into Tony’s space. “My friends are currently all staring at us through the crack in the curtains,” he said with a smile, “you wanna give ‘em a show?”
?” Sam asked, squinting his eyes and leaning forward, “at all? Not even like-“ Steve sighed as he watched Sam gesturing what looked like an incredibly awkward handjob, and then shook his head simply, trying to turn back to his work.
“Fucking… Zeke,” was all he said to break the silence, looking down and shaking his head. There was a bitter, bitter smile on his face. “Dear old Zeke Stane thought it would be funny to buy the fucking disk. And let me tell you, if there’s- if there’s one thing you’re not expectin’ to see whilst you’re in the middle of doing body shots, it’s a running commentary about how your own mother- how she-“
“Uh,” Bruce began, “Steve, if you can hear, then we can- uh- we’ll get you some supplies. You probably shouldn’t be going out into the real world right now.”
He looked up, checking the street name as he turned the corner, and frowned. That didn’t look familiar- Natasha had said Williams Street, not Turner.
He blinked, rubbing a hand over his eyes and then looking up at the ceiling. A second later, the off-beat ringing tune of Sam’s doorbell went off downstairs, and he realized with a sigh that that was probably what had woken him up.
relationship because you thought I didn’t need you in the first place,” tony finished for him, his voice unable to keep from cracking toward the end.
Steve knocked their shoulders together. “Wow- you must really love me then,” he said with a laugh.
warning for graphic description of child abuse in this chapter. Also bad writing because it's 5am but I was determined to get this out for you
They didn’t get woken up that night, which was surprising. Peter decided that five in the morning was as good a time as any to rise and shine, however, which meant they did have an abominably early start. At least they’d had more than three hours of rest this time, though.
“I wouldn’t put it past them,” Natasha responded darkly, “the guy didn’t specify though- why? What have you found?”
“Cross my heart,” Tony said with a laugh as Steve climbed nervously onto the railings and got his hands around the rafter above his head. “See, just hoist yourself up a
Steve’s heart soared, and inside his head, he laughed with relief joy. They’d both done it. Steve had been right.
They both ended up at the hospital.
It was like every nightmare he’d ever had, rolled into one sickening reality. He knew that it had been a trap; the whole mission had been a set-up, designed to get him over to where they could take him captive and… and ‘rewire’ him, as they’d called it. He knew that he’d had moments, flashes, afterwards, where he’d been coherent. Where he’d been aware. He’d seen the piles of bodies at his feet, remembered the sound of a neck breaking under his hands.
He never once took his eyes off Steve.
“No y’don’t. Pepper cancelled it.” Steve blinked and then pushed himself upward a little, looking Tony in the eye with a nervous smile. “-And she cancelled the one after that, and the one after that… well, ‘rearranged’ is the term she used, actually, but the point still stands.”
Steve had paused, trying to look suitably offended, before he apparently gave up and shrugged. “Like I said- you don’t fuck around when you play hide and seek.”
Steve grinned. Thor was beginning to talk like he was medieval again. He raised his own glass off diet coke into the air with him, and Thor clinked their beakers together roughly, which, of course, meant that half of the contents of Steve’s drink ended up all over his face. “Wow,” he said, unimpressed, “thanks, Thor.”
“I’m your primary user now, correct?”
Tony let out an audible breath and then shoved him in annoyance, looking at Steve with a mixture of relief and irritation. “Oh my God, you bastard, I thought I’d ruined everyth-“
Steve laughed tiredly, nodding. “I’ll keep it in mind,” he said softly, “thanks, Sam.”
Steve sighed. “It’s f-“
But Steve was bleeding all over the fucking bedsheets, and Steve just couldn’t sit under that bed for three whole hours, sneezing away in immense pain. He was angry at Tony, but he knew he would only be angrier still by the time the boy eventually came back to collect him, which would just make everything a hell of a lot worse.
He was so tired of doing this alone. Of being alone.
Steve shouted over Mr. Wilson angrily, his hand slamming against the dashboard, “he manipulated and blackmailed Tony into sleeping with him and doing things for him,
There was a brief pause, before Steve suddenly lifted Tony out of the bridal-carry and turned him, until his hands were holding Tony up by the ass, lips crashing into Tony’s messily as he moaned. Loudly.
“I picked them up on the way. Had a feeling I’d be needing them,” Tony admitted, and Steve was sent back to the past, heard tony as he told everyone
"And if Steve ever breaks your heart and you need a quick fuck to begin the healing process, I'm your man."
Any answer Rhodey had was lost as the crowd pushed toward them.
"Mister Stark, welcome back." There's no preamble. She holds his chin and shines a pen light into his eyes. He jerks, but she's determined. Nodding, she turns to his monitors. "Everything looks good. Your teammates have just stepped out. I'm sure they'll be back soon."
There was a pause as they contemplated that, and Tony had to admit that it was probably the best course of action. "What movie?" He started toward the kitchen, gesturing for everyone to follow. "Comedy? Drama?"
Steve was out before Tony had finished speaking
Natasha took a second. Blinked once. "Hm," she said evenly, "I don't quite know how to answer that one."
"just trust me," Steve said quietly, shaking his head, "let this one go. For now, anyway."
Another second for him to have that thought, and he might have already opened the door and made everything worse. He tightened his fist to the point where it began to throb and then lowered it back to his side, jaw clenched and heart beating furiously as he stumbled away. He hadn’t thought it through. Hadn’t thought any of it through. Again, fucking selfish- so desperate to just see Tony that he hadn’t even thought about how that might affect the man. What the fuck was wrong with him?
"Eh, I guess it's not too bad," he said with a shrug. Hopefully Steve would think so too.
"Well, that can't be good," Tony muttered. Steve huffed, grabbing Tony's hand and squeezing hard as they stepped inside the room, which was filled with three rows of what looked like the same kind of odd sleeping capsules that he had seen in one of Peter's Star Trek movies. Steve watched as Tony's jaw tightened and his eyes narrowed, and the lead ball in Steve's stomach grew even larger.
Steve growled then, one hand sliding down Tony's back to squeeze his ass as his other cupped Tony's cheek, tilting his head up and capturing his lips. Tony whimpered as Steve licked into his mouth, scraping his blunt fingernails up Steve's back.
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree with Mr Stark on that one, Senator," said one of the senators from Oregon, Tony couldn't remember her name at the moment either. "However, Mr Stark, is there no way to make your… Iron Legion, a bit less conspicuous? While I don't agree that they are frightening, I do feel that they send a rather… aggressive message, and one that could perhaps become misinterpreted as time goes on."
Tony should’ve known that he’d needed to compose himself a bit more before stepping inside the store.  Peter’s perceptiveness aside, he should’ve realised that Steve would know something was wrong the second he laid eyes on him, which would then cause his mind to start working overtime.  Steve, for all of his wonderful attributes, seemed to believe that anytime Tony was anything less than content, he needed to step things up and make him so.  Tony had tried explaining to him a few times that sometimes he just needed to let his grumbly mood work itself out, but Steve never seemed to get it, and would bend over backwards trying to pamper Tony until he admitted that he was better.
"That's a good idea, Pete," Dad said. "I'm sure you're hungry anyway, aren't ya?"
snapped Image Papa.
"Or more than one," Tony added. "As long as they have the materials, they could build as many as they wanted."
"Sounds good, babe."
"But… don't you think he'd wanna know if his papa was deliberately killed?" Peter asked. "'Cause I think he would."
The god of mischief, indeed.
As he stepped through the second door from the restroom, Tony gasped, stopping short as the cat suddenly bounded gracefully onto the end of the tiny cot shoved against the wall.
As soon as Mr Rogers sees Peter’s head pop up, he crouches down, a rather impressed smile on his face.
"I said I don't know, Peter," Uncle Bucky warned. "Hopefully we'll hear something soon, and—"
Finally, after he’s listened to both versions of
"How 'bout I give you a haircut later, hmm?" she asked. "I'm surprised you can still see with all those curls hanging in your eyes."
"Well, you're wrong," Steve stated, smiling slightly at Tony's confused look. "Or, should I say, you're wrong about the most important part of that statement." He leaned forward, pressing a quick but firm kiss to Tony's lips. "I was never happy, Tony. Yeah, I guess I was a bit of the hotshot pilot that you mentioned, and I know that I enjoyed it, but I would not have called myself happy because I really wasn't. I was just kind of… existing. I had decided long ago to close myself off to any kind of relationship that could lead to marriage and family, because I was too afraid that if I got those things and then lost them again, it would destroy me."
"He's ready, gentlemen," she said. "Once the serum infusion is complete we'll disconnect the ventilator for the radiation burst, which should only be about fifteen seconds long."
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, Captain," said JARVIS. "His vital signs are within his normal parameters."
"Colonel Rhodes," Tony explained. "We've known each other for years. He was my roommate at university."
"I guess I'll take that as a 'no'," Bucky said once Steve had finally finished coughing and rinsed out his mouth, his throat still stinging from the soap. "Look, it's not like we're gonna have to work all that closely with him or anything."
Steve had huffed and glared at him, but dropped the subject anyway, allowing Tony to fluff up his pillows and make sure that his water bottles, books, and sketchbook were all within easy reach on the bedside table.
"Oh, that was awesome!" Peter exclaimed as he shot another web at one of the flying whales. Tony's heart lurched as Peter was pulled from the ground, huffing out a sharp breath when he noticed Rhodey take up a flanking position, blasting the whale away with one of his rockets just as Peter flipped away, this time latching onto Sam Wilson's feet as he flew across.
"Honey?" Tony asked, his eyebrows knitting together. "What's—?"
"Cap!" Uncle Sam suddenly cried as he swerved in the air in front of Peter, followed closely by Uncle James. Peter's breath caught in his throat, and he yanked hard on Papa's elbow as he noticed Thanos raising his left arm, the blue Space Stone and the red Reality Stone both glowing brightly as he pointed them towards the sky.
Don't do this!
Tony's head snapped back in surprise. "You did? When?"
"That's it!" Peter said, his horror briefly tempered by his excitement at finally figuring it out. He tapped his tablet screen, highlighting the line he'd just read.
"To Riley," he said, clear and true.
"Tony," Steve said, giving Tony's hand a quick squeeze. "Okay, Mr Lang, so you do understand that Tony here is not his father, right? And I'm sure I don't have to list for you all of the ways that Tony and his company have helped not only the people of New York, but all over the world."
Steve glanced down the hall, making sure they were still alone before leaning down to whisper in Tony's ear.
"It will then have the look and feel of a Captain America suit," finished JARVIS. "Very clever, sir."
"Do you have to go now, Uncle Bucky?" asked Peter. "Would you wanna play a game of chess?"
"Thank you, Mr Stacy," said Peter, offering Gwen his arm like the little gentleman that he was. Steve felt another surge of pride at his son's impeccable manners, and judging by the look on Chief Stacy's face, he was pretty impressed too.
"But if that's the case, then the president just let it happen," he said. "Why didn't he try to stop it?"
A slow smile spread across Tony's lips as he burrowed further into Steve's side, breathing in the delicious vanilla scent of his skin. Warm fuzzies flooded Tony's body as he recalled how tender and loving Steve had been with him the night before. They had started out with a bubble bath in the huge sunken tub in the master bathroom, complete with glasses of champagne and several of the chocolate-covered strawberries that Steve and Peter had dipped earlier that day. Once the water had grown too cool for their liking, Steve had lifted Tony from the tub and carried him to their bed, where he'd proceeded to make love to him as passionately as if it had been their very first time.
Ned quirked an eyebrow. "Oh. Well, that makes sense." He squinted, leaning closer to his screen. "Where are you guys right now, anyway?"
Tony had long since believed that someday his sins would come back to haunt him.  He just hadn’t expected it to hurt so goddamn much.
"Great idea, babe," Tony said as he landed about ten metres away from Thor, facing him and pointing to his arc reactor. "Thor, charge me up!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"And your people can then access this place if they wish to speak to their ancestors?" Steve asked. He couldn't help but think of what it might be like to be able to see his ma again.
Something about the tone of Dad's voice, the slight quiver that Peter knew that he was reigning in just for him, caused his belly to swoop in fear. Dad had already been twitchy as hell ever since the weird space thing over Wakanda, and now, after adding on Uncle Thor's proclamation of doom and yet another attack by HYDRA where Papa was almost seriously hurt, Peter was surprised that Dad could still function with how worried he was. Peter knew that he hadn't slept more than an hour or two since Papa left for Namibia, and was rapidly approaching his post-Battle of New York levels of obsession with finalising his nanite armour so he could then get started on a suit for Papa.
Image Papa shook his head, shifting from foot to foot.
"I was a pilot, and that was my callsign." Carol explained. "Carol 'Avenger' Danvers."
the gauntlet's metal fingers made as they snapped uselessly against each other was so small it was almost pathetic. Aghast, Steve could only gape as Thanos' face rapidly transformed from triumph to shock to rage as he glanced over at Tony, on his knees with his right arm held out in front of him, the six infinity stones locking themselves into place within his nanite armour.
But that doesn't mean I can't stand seeing you go off without me either."
"Good morning, Captain," Doctor List said as he arrived at the window, the young red-haired woman standing next to him. "I trust that you slept well?"
"I'm not planning on wearing much once we get back, honey," Tony whispered. Then he pressed a kiss to the underside of Steve's jaw, smirking when Steve's knees nearly buckled.
"Oh my God!" Gwen said, thankfully not too loudly. "Peter, do you
And they didn't wake until the sun was shining brightly the next morning.
Not that he should've expected otherwise. Unlike Tony, Peter still believed there was something resembling a human soul buried somewhere down deep inside Howard's aging body, but then again, Peter had an uncanny ability to sniff out the good in just about anyone.
"Very good, sir. Meeting is scheduled for a week next Tuesday, at 1pm."
"Duly noted, sir," said JARVIS. "Shall I get started immediately?"
damnit
that he saw Pete?" Tony asked, his heart slamming against his ribcage. He hadn't even considered the possibility that Peter wasn't even on the premises. "He doesn't know for sure?"
Dad hugged Peter even tighter, planting a kiss on the top of his head. "If you're sure that you won't be too scared, then I guess you can go. I'll make sure that Happy's got the guards in place."
"Yeah, J, that's fine."
Steve's belly gave a hard swoop. "We would be. The Avengers."
"Okay, so does this whole Project Rebirth thing have anything to do with the fact that you managed to tear the sheets last night?" Tony asked as he popped the last of his bread roll into his mouth. He grinned as Steve's cheeks proceeded to flush that deep pink colour he adored. "I mean, I know I can give a pretty decent blowjob, but—"
"They're ready for him now," Ma said quietly.
Clint held up his hands. "Hey, I'm just telling it like I see it. I'm not saying we should go in and start interrogating the guy ourselves, just that he's lucky he's not in the old Soviet Union."
"Steve, really?" he said. "We get to move in there already?"
“Oh, don't give me that diversifying crap!” Obie snapped!  “Tony, we’re weapons manufacturers!  It’s what we do best!  Anything else is just… gratuitous, and—!”
-fun experience in Afghanistan and the fallout that had followed, he had been inclined to stick much closer to home.
“All right, buddy.  I’m sure you’ve gotta be hungry, yeah?” Tony asked.  “So how ‘bout we get going.”
"No, probably not," agreed Tony. "Ah well, who knows. Maybe he'll be extra tired tonight. It was the first day back at school."
Of all the enemies Steve thought he might face as the Avengers’ leader, HYDRA had
Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "Well, you're right. I do hate it."
Yet another thing that just didn't add up, the pile of which seemed to be growing larger with every passing day.
" he forced out. "Does she know that I'm—I mean, have you told her that—?"
"No," he choked out. "Or I mean, nothing more than usual. My dads are just out of town on a mission, and I—"
"Of course, sir. Estimated time for render and construction for three devices and particle sets is eight hours."
"Aside from the lake incident," Steve reminded him.
"Where are my husband and son?" Steve demanded, his hands clenching into fists when the female alien's lips curled into a smirk.
completely destroyed their Malibu home.
"I know it, baby," he whispered against Steve's lips. "No one's ever been as good to me as you. No one."
Closing his eyes, Tony buried his nose further into Steve's pillow, trying to relax enough to fall asleep again. He was a bit sore and sticky from all of their sexual calisthenics over the course of the night, but it was the good kind of sore, like what one would expect after a hard workout. Warmth bloomed across his chest as he recalled the way Steve's hands and lips had caressed his skin, and the husky sound of his voice as he demanded for Tony to look into his eyes.
"I love you," he whispered, first into Tony's hair, then into Peter's, pressing kisses to both of their heads before tipping his own head back and closing his eyes.
“Or a husband,” Tony says, instantly regretting it when Peter’s face lights up like a Christmas tree.
"Yes, sir?"
"Ahh, sort of," answered Steve. "He was more like our civilian colleague. I lead a team called the Avengers, and Fury works with us."
“Yeah, okay.”  Tony wasn't
“Tony, do you hear that?” he asks between his panting breaths.  “I think there’s still something we need to deactivate before we—”
"Yeah, yeah, you know what I mean," grumbled Tony. "How soon can you get it out there to Bruce?"
"Well, it is called space, Captain Barnes, not vast quantities of stuff," replied Tony. "Now, JARVIS will alert you when it's time to release your trial satellites, so—"
"Uh huh," Peter said softly. "But why wouldn't I have been?"
"Yeah, it is." While Peter could see General O'Brien having it in for Papa because Grandma refused to marry him, it was still weird to try and kill him now when he could've just refused to give Papa the serum all those years ago and he would've just died on his own.
"Go ahead and try," he said, his voice so clear that Steve's knees nearly buckled.
“Yeah, honey, okay,” Tony said, his hands sliding up to hook over Steve’s shoulders.  He rolled onto his back, hiking his legs up around Steve’s waist as Steve settled on top of him, their hard cocks sliding against each other through the soft fabric of their sleep pants.
"O-kay," Bucky said slowly. "But you still haven't answered me."
He glanced over at Tony, clearing his throat when Tony shot him a wink. "Well… what can I say?"
"Steve?" Peter asked as soon as he emerged from the bathroom, his small, fragile steps chipping away at Steve's heart like an ice pick. "Are you okay? You look kinda funny."
"That tends to happen when you take someone's husband and son prisoner, Hammer!" Tony retorted. "Now, where the hell are they?"
"Babe," Tony said gently, brushing his fingers across Steve's lips. His chest was heaving, and there were beads of sweat sprinkled around his hairline. He had been just as nervous as Steve, but as usual had been trying to hide it. "Honey, let's not worry about that now, yeah? It's four in the morning. We gotta take Pete to school in a few hours."
"And that includes Pete, right?" Tony asked. "I know he's not technically part of the team, but—"
Gwen's eyebrows shot up as she laughed. "Oh! Well, we can't have that, right?"
“You know, I’ve never seen anyone who can sneak up on people as well as you can,” Steve says, chuckling as he reaches for his bottle of apple juice.  “You should’ve been a spy or something.”
“Aww, Cap!  That bike was brand new!” Tony says as he circles back around, still dodging the cannon blasts.  “You barely got a chance to get to know her!”
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea after all.
a visual that I needed," protested James. "Like, at
"We don't," said Bruce. "But while I can see Peter doing something like that, it would make more sense for him to do that if there was actually something at that location besides ocean."
“There’s no way Agent Danvers and I would be here if we didn't think it would stick,” answered Fury.  He dug his phone from his back pocket, chuckling as he read a message.  “And it looks like my buddies over in the JAG Corps just picked up General West.  I’d say so far this case is falling into place pretty well.”
Peter swallowed hard as he nodded, digging around in his pocket for his earplugs. "Yeah, just forgot how loud the bells are, no big deal."
"We're not gonna decide that right now, little guy," Steve said firmly. "I think we should go and celebrate with some pizza first, and then we can think about when we'll talk about it. Okay?"
Nostalgia hit Tony like a speeding train as he looked Peter—his sweet boy—up and down, not understanding how in the hell he had managed to grow up so fast right under Tony's nose. While he was still shorter than Tony, he had managed to get a lot closer to eye level over the course of this school year, and his jawline had sharpened up, with his cheeks losing a bit more of their roundness.
"Yeah, I got it," Sam said as he expertly landed the jet, killing the engines once the wings were folded in. "All right. After you, Cap."
"I'm not, little guy," Papa murmured into his hair. "This all looks a lot worse than it is."
"No," Steve answered, probably a bit too defensively when Tony quirked a questioning eyebrow. "I just… I just… please, do we have to keep talking about it? Can't we just—"
Steve had been planning the proposal for weeks, altering and fine-tuning certain details, and had nearly finalised everything in the days leading up to the mission.  He was going to take both Tony and Peter out to dinner, somewhere nice but not too fancy so Peter didn't have to dress up.  Then, once they were finished eating, he was going to first ask Peter if he would do him the honour of allowing Steve to formally adopt him.  Steve had already contacted a lawyer and had all of the appropriate paperwork drawn up, so all he needed was Peter’s approval and they would be set.  Tony had already given Steve the go-ahead to ask, and he was hopeful that since Peter had already taken to calling him ‘Papa’ that it would be an easy decision for him to want to make things official.
They didn’t linger long in the room, moving into a hallway that led to another room and had one door on each side.
“I'll take the basement, for obvious reasons.” Bruce volunteered, smiling slightly when Clint offered to go with him.
“Hello? Avengers? Natasha? Thor? Bruce? Clint? It anyone there!?” Steve yelled, his very soul filling with despair.
“No! Leave me alone!” He screeched, shooting arrow after arrow right through the illusion that was his father and into the stairs behind him.
He pressed his hand against the glass, right where Natasha's hand was. Her hand wrapped around his and her smile turned wicked, as she began to pull him in. Thor fought against he grip, pulling back, only to be pulled in further.
A boney hand grabbed him by the throat, pulling him back under. He struggled against it, fighting to get free as the fingers of its other hand clawed at his mouth, trying to pry it open. It pressed harder the more he fought, tearing at his flesh and ripping his lips and throat apart, his blood staining the water.
He lifted his head to look at the wooden structure that once held the mirror. There were still a few piece there, but most of it was shattered on the floor. Clint chocked on his tears as he struggled to stand. He had to leave, he had to get out of here because if he stayed any longer he would die. Just like Bruce had.
“Come out and you'll be with your friends again.”
“We're going to split up to cover the area faster and easier.” Steve said.
“I don't know! The suit just turned off! It's like I’m being blocked or something. Nothing is responding! Everything is dead and its really starting to piss me off.” he yelled, knowing his voice would be muffled by the layer of metal.
Clint walked beside Bruce down the stairs into the blackness that was the basement. He pulled out a flashlight from one of his pockets and used it to illuminate the darkness. It was one large room, filled with random objects, all covered in sheets.
He wasn't sure how Clint knew that, nor did he want to. Steve told himself over and over again that Tony was gone, Tony had died in his arms. He steeled his resolve and barreled forward, shield extended in front of him. He was almost to Tony when on of the hall doors was open and he was thrown into the bathroom.
But Bruce wasn't there. His reflection was, pressed up against the mirror, pounding on it and staring straight at Clint with a horrified expression. He pressed his hand to the mirrors cold surface, right where Bruce's cheek was. The moment they touched Clint flew backwards, slamming into a tall dresser so hard it tipped over, taking him with it.
“He is referring to 'ghosts',” Bruce answered for him, having changed back while they had waited for the Widow to confirm their targets location. “Which are just a baseless superstition and do not exist.”
They walked carefully, sticking close to each other so as not to get lost or trip over anything. Bruce pulled the sheets off the things as they went, making Clint cough at all the dust that flew into the air.
"But you won't, will you? Not until I tell you. Because good little whores follow directions, don't they?" He completed his answer by smacking Tony again and pressing his fingers hard into his prostate, jutting them back and forth. Tony's head lifted, throwing it back and yelling his moan, pushing back on his hands to drive Steve into him deeper. His thighs trembling around Steve's waist.
When Tony finally lets go of his life, it's with the reassurance that he's never actually been alone.
"You're a smart man, you do the math."
In the morning, he was still supine. Tony had moved through the night but stayed curled up against Steve, more on him than off. His sleep was jumbled and spastic, and Steve found himself gently cajoling him back into dreams every hour or so. Under the surface, he was fuming. The one thing he had asked of Howard was to not hurt Tony and that's exactly what he did.
"This is incredible," Steve breathed. He walked up to a photograph of himself and Natasha, both looking exhausted as they stared above, the object of their focus unknown, but the emotions displayed across both faces speaking volumes.
But literally nothing on the device made sense.
"What did ya do, Stevie?"
Maybe Rhodey hadn't always approved of the relationship, but these days, he could think of no one better for Tony to be in love with.
"That's because I love you!" Swinging an arm around his shoulders, she squeezed, purposely putting pressure on the arm she had punched twice.
He felt off-kilter, like he was on a merry-go-round and no one was at the controls. Spinning faster and faster, unable to keep his eyes on a stable landmark long enough to not feel sick. It was dizzying. Frightening. All the insanity but none of the fun or music.
Natasha snorted at Clint's choice of words, "Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Howard."
"This isn't just another cause for me to throw money at. I know a lot of you like to think that's all I do, and," he gestured to the attendees, "I don't mean any of you." The cameramen and the reporters shifted uneasily, the jab at them hitting their last shred of humanity. "This
He had only glanced up and grinned, "They can't afford me." Finished, they asked another Angel's opinion, which she wholeheartedly and enthusiastically congratulated them on such realistic work.

"StonyFan1918 posted a new story."
As it was, Tony was a half-breed, a
"Tony, if I were writing this scene, I'd pick you up and take you bed and show you just how much I love you, regardless of your flaws. Because we're still human, and we're going to have flaws. And that doesn't mean one person is better than another. It just means we're different. And I really like that."
Frowning, Natasha laid the crease in her left palm and flipped it open with her right. "The Avengers! Nick,
She scares the shit out of him.
Before Tony's abduction and captivity in Afghanistan, Rhodey never had cause to worry
"Tony?"
Snapping the drawer shut, she gave him a pointed look. "This will ruin all other curry for you, trust me."
"Say that five times fast."
He sighed heavily. "And nothing. I like it. Even if you do hate me." Shrugging, he held his hands out. "Just an observation?"
Trying again, the pain is worse the second time. And as Tony's eyes roll back into his head, he pictures his bed. Soft. Warm. Enveloping and comfortable. A good novel. A cup of coffee. And a frayed, greying blanket - once blue - that he can hold in his hand.
"I," he raised his eyebrows, "I'm useful?"
Groaning, Tony pushed a finger inside himself, working hard to ignore his cock for the time being. He used the tip of his middle finger to flit about, moving it like it was a tongue. His hips began to undulate, the feeling of something so teasingly close to his prostate sending sparks through his vision.
"And I don't care to, you fucking
Tony nodded. "Good choice. That's more than he deserved."
"Thanks, Tony."
"Fingers by your eye, good, and release." The arrow hits the target almost dead on, and Clint whistles. "Damn."
"Yeah," he said, stepping through the threshold. "Can I hold onto this? I found this list of acclaimed novels, and I started one, and it's really very good." He barely noticed Steve sitting uncomfortably on the couch as Tony led him to the bedroom. "The list is by some woman named Oprah Winfrey?"
"Whatever." He turned to face Rhodey. "So, let's say we can erase his memory and send his ass back home. You think
Michael shakes his head, "That's
Livid, Steve reaches for the only projectile he can find: his pillow. "She threw the house
"You're not going anywhere, Tony."
"All set then. I'll see you in an hour, Rogers." Turning on her heels, Natasha left, Bruce following behind, barely holding in a snicker. The door clicked behind them.
"Enjoy your lunch!"
"Are to!"
"I think he's actually tearing up." She bent over and looked up into Clint's face; he was doubled over clutching his stomach.
"And, apparently, no carrots," Tony says, standing up straight, "but we do have a parsnip. And that's basically the same thing."
"Not the first time," Steve grinned.
"No," she said smugly, "but if you don't back off the questions about him, his actual lover is going to rip your balls off."
"Yeah. Fiction."
Reblog the story on Tumblr!
It was like she didn't even know him at all.
The reply came quick.
"Go away, she-devil."
Not Steve, of course, because no matter how hard she tried, there was no way he believed that Steve wrote those smut stories. It was near impossible to picture Steve at his laptop, writing about eating Tony out in public, or fucking him on the sofa in his workshop, as wonderful as that thought could be.
It was years of erosion done in just a few hours. Damage that may not have been seen exasperated and brought to light by a single impetus. He was Fire Island after Hurricane Sandy had hit.
For once, they could find someone else.
"Come here first." Tugging Tony, Steve swept him up in his arms and kissed him breathless. "No matter what happens, I love you."
"I thought this had more in it?"
He nuzzled Tony's taut skin as he made his way back up to kiss him, letting Tony taste himself on Steve's tongue. "Of course, angel." He murmured, hooking his arms under Tony's and hefting him to the head of the bed. "On your stomach." Tony moaned, and rolled over, pressing his cleft against Steve's length as he did so. Steve hissed. "I should make you pay for that."
Bruce tried to placate him, "Tony, he's fine. It really wasn't a big deal, we didn't even need the Other Guy."
She flipped her hair and stuck out one hip, like Cher in
They were working on it.
"I want to explore every inch of you, Tony. I've wanted you, loved you! for so long." He paused, stilling his fingers. "I need you to know, unequivocally, how much I love you."
"How DARE you."
"Looked like you needed to talk."
Taking a deep breath, Steve walked slowly, but on steady feet into the room, coming to stand near the father and son. "It's good to see you laughing," he quietly spoke to Tony, a small smile emerging from his lips. He felt no need to assert himself or prove himself, or do anything other than say his observation. It was a wonderful feeling to be on such stable ground. He knew what he needed, what Tony needed, and what Howard needed. And he knew how to give it without forcing it on either of them. They were,
boudoir escapades." The air around them thinned, and Steve breathed a sigh of relief.
She tapped the knife in her place setting, "It's all about balance."
"Spoken like a true mob boss."
"It's not up to you, Howard." Carefully, Clint lined the vegetables up on the island. He walked to the counter and took the cutting board from Natasha's hands. "If we lose that battle, New York is gone. This tower is gone. And that means Tony will probably be gone." Picking a knife from the block by the stove, he turned back to the island and sliced a tomato in half. The red tinted juice flowed freely across the wooden board. "Gone, Howard. Do you understand that? Dead. If you don't listen to us and you go back knowing, then you have sentenced the very son you're trying to protect to death."
"I am." Steve said, putting his wallet and phone into his pocket. He picked up his jacket.
That broke the tension, and Howard laughed. "Thanks, but I think I'll pass. I'd like to stay here. Besides, you should see what too much dairy does to my ass."
"Bigger pain in mine, but thanks for the unscheduled time off." On the television, Rhodey watched as the Bad Guy of the Week
"I liked you holding me. I didn't think I could have both." Looking down at the blankie, he runs his hands over it again. "Can I have both?"
"Not dying!"

"Fuck you."
"Duh. The real question is are you Team Dean, Team Jess, or Team Logan?"
Tony’s fingers curled, nails digging into the pale skin of Steve's back, just under his shoulder blades, leaving deep red streaks as the pounding set him off balance, his body jolting, barely able to hold on. His legs, shaking around Steve's hips, stuttered as they wrapped tighter, hooking at the ankles to keep them wrapped around Steve. "More," he begged, his hands inching up to Steve's back to grip him and guide him down into a wet, open mouthed kiss. "Fuck! Right there!"
His skin heats under her palm, and he feels the wetness in his eyes roll down his cheeks.
"How old is she?"
Turning around to face the tower he thought,
"They don't have a website."
"Okay. So now that the science backs it up, what do we do?"
Nodding, Steve left the room, turning down the corridor and taking the steps to the bottom floor. He heard Tony's voice before he even opened the backdoor. As quietly as possible, he pushed it open.
"Excellent," Tony grins, "we just need a few things from the kitchen, and we'll be set to make the most awesome snowman that this city has ever seen. Why? Because I'm an engineer, that's why!" Some of it is false bravado, but it's enough to startle a laugh out of Steve.
"Why?" He was a little ashamed to admit it, but Tony's voice came out shy and childlike. He felt bare naked and torn open. Exposed and stripped. Like the last of his defences had given up and thrown in the towel.
Still, Bruce decided as he crossed the street, he'd buy some flowers. Some he'd place in a vase in the apartment; a little burst of color to cheer him up. The rest he'd give to the Hulk.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked exhausted, falling back against the back of the chair and sighing. "Google it."
"Maybe not," Howard continued, "but I had an inkling. I knew there was no sure way back. I just-" He faltered, lifting one shoulder helplessly and looking down, "I kept thinking it would all work out because it always did. No matter what I've done, I've always managed to salvage it. I always landed on my feet. I wasn't prepared to
I promise."
When he wakes again, Natasha is still at his side.
Sensing that Howard was becoming more emotional, Thor steered the conversation into a different direction for the moment. "What year are you from?"
"She already does. Who do you
"Get your booger picking finger out of my face!" Blowing through his lips as if he could create enough wind to send Clint's hand away from him, Tony tried really hard not to laugh.
It was just one more regret Steve had.
His eyes are already falling shut. "To survive my father. I have to hide." He won't remember saying it.
"Tony-"
Tony did look up at those words, his head snapping straight, shock and anger smeared across his handsome features. "They had no
Unsure of what to say, Natasha took a long sip of her drink to buy a few precious seconds, her face darkened with confusion. "Of course it's a good idea. No one said it was going to be easy."
"Regardless," sitting up straight, Rhodey made sure he had Tony's full attention before continuing, "the more I think about it, the more I think she's right. This is a rare opportunity, Tones." Tony looked uneasy but gestured for Rhodey to go on. "I only met the guy briefly on the way in, but from what Romanoff and Barton said, he's not a monster yet."
Against the window in Steve's room, for all of the city to see. Put on display like he was Steve's artwork, something to be admired from afar, but no touching. Not unless you were the artist. Not unless you were Steve.
"So, I've found something you're familiar with? The great Captain America knows about butt plugs?"
to get you in the Top 40 again," she held her hands up placatingly at the start of their protests. "Just this album. If it doesn't work, then I swear you guys can go right back to what you were doing."
Steve was chuckling, "Can't wait to see this end up on TMZ!" He was syncing his legs with Tony's, making wide strides out to the side, but Tony's shorter legs were falling behind.
"I'm not sure," Tony laughs, helping Clint pick up one of the gym bags, "anyone who uses the word
"They already know," Clint added. "The media storm if we lie will be so much worse."
"Talk to him," Bruce spoke up softly, looking up at Thor and back to Steve. "You know Tony. Better than any of us. He doesn't want this."
Which means all that is left is Tony's injuries, and he's not looking forward to that.
"Don't kink shame me."
What the fuck had warped Howard so much that he turned into such a...such a…
Of course it was still unsettling that the the rest of the team had found the stories (or Tony had found them and shared, but even that sent a tingle down his spine.). They all were seeming to enjoy them and it did lead to Tony telling them all the he was bisexual.
"Here," Tony said, standing. He followed the nurse to the back, Steve close behind.
Kissing his head, Steve smirked. "No complaints here either." He picked up the baking pan with the bacon, "I love your belly."
"Do what?"
The evening peak commuter hours were winding down, not that there was as much on a Sunday, mostly retail workers, police officers, and medical personnel, and she had several hours before she'd be missed at the tower. Enough time to stretch her legs and wander Eighth Avenue for a bite to eat.
"God, Tony. I love you so much."
Steve brought his knees up to cradle around Tony's bottom, tugging the smaller man up on them without ceasing his movements. Around his cock, Tony's rim stretched, Steve widening it as he thrust in and out, the angles sometimes elongating the muscle. It was mesmerizing the way he fit into Tony's body, the slick of leftover lube and precome gathering around the edges, a milky white that left streaks on Steve's cock whenever he pulled out. His hole, rose tinted and greedy, taking him back in eagerly.
