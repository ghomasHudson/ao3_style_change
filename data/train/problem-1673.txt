“I desire information.” As he stared at John, his eyes seemed to glow.
James shakes his head. “Don’t worry, I trust you’re working. Besides, you’re a far better client than some when it comes to keeping me in the loop.”
“Come on then!” Irene called. Judging from the pink in her cheeks, John suspected she’d already started in on the drinks. “Let’s dance!”
“Sherlock!” John grabbed the wheel this time. Rain was coming down harder than ever, making it difficult to see even the other end of the
Is that what it’s like for everyone else?
But shouts and cries from the
Sherlock's countenance softened. "You're such a sentimentalist."
“Oh,” Sherlock’s eyes dart between her and John. “Right. John, this is my lab partner, Molly Hooper. Molly, this is… John.” There is a brief hesitation before his name, and John wonders if Sherlock considered elaborating. He wonders what title he might have been given.
John encounters several surprises.
John's head whips back up. He frowns, amused but still uncertain. "Is... is that a yes?"
"John!" Sherlock's cheeks turned pink in an instant, though for all his pretending at offense, he was still laughing.
The man’s sharp cheekbones are tinted with pink, likely from the wind outside and the confrontation, and his curls are tousled in an almost indecently windswept way. John guesses he is mid-twenties, just a few years younger than John. When his gaze lifts and meets John’s, the author is immediately struck by the man’s eyes.
“We’re not making port yet,” Sherlock replied, even as his fingers flew to give instructions to Ekene. John marveled at his ability to literally speak in two languages at once. “We’re going to wait just out of sight until nightfall, then head in. John, any of your men who wish to find a different berth are welcome to depart. We will resupply and then leave as soon as we are able. I’d rather not be within sight of the port at dawn.”
“I would, but only because you are,” John popped up on his toes, and kissed the tip of Sherlock’s nose.
John stroked a hand down his arm. “That’s okay. I, well, I haven’t ever done this either. At least, not with a man.”
John’s gaze was fierce as he leveled his gun and fired. A man near Sherlock fell, crying out as a bullet rammed through his gut. A crack shot.
“-and I was scared!” Sherlock’s voice rose as he finished, though not enough to match John’s in volume. It was too upset.
John laughs without humor. “Understatement. He yelled for… oh, at least an hour that next morning. Mum cried the whole time to see us fighting. I ended up taking those bags I’d packed and leaving. Went to stay with my sister Harry until I got accepted into uni.”
Sherlock huffs a laugh, though his head dips self-consciously before he can prevent the movement. “Probably,” he murmurs, then moves further into the store. John chuckles behind him, and the sound is almost enough to compel Sherlock to spin about and stay to just watch John laugh.
Sherlock held his gaze. “You theorize without all the facts, Lieutenant.”
“Cold place to be thinking,” he comments.
John eased off, sitting back and moving both his hands to Sherlock’s sides, in that dip just above his hips. Sherlock trembled below him, panting and still clinging to him.
He sucked in a quick breath. Morning would come, and the
And all through the days leading up to Christmas, John finds himself facing the same question over and over again.
Well, perhaps not everything. John frowned as he climbed up the stairs leading from the Tube, the tall form of Bart’s looming larger and larger as he neared street level. He did have to admit his schedule had prevented him from relaxing as much as he’d used to. He and Sherlock hadn’t been spending as much time together as maybe they should have been. But, he reminded himself as he shoved his hand into his pocket for his ID badge - rather more aggressively than strictly necessary - that did not excuse Sherlock’s behavior.
Until now.
The crew, with John in tow, ended up in an inn, consuming probably the entire stock of food in the kitchen.
“Relax,” he said then, locking his gaze on John. And something in his voice seemed to act as a balm, easing the tension in John’s hand.
“Let me start over,” John said, more gently this time. He took a breath and then launched into speech again. “Sherlock, you didn’t ask for Sebastian to do this. I know I got really angry at you the other day, but… I don’t know, I realized that was wrong. You didn’t want him to threaten you.”
John nodded and positioned himself next to the door, peering out at the corridor through the gaps in the drawn blinds.
, and the detritus of Sherlock’s notes, equipment, and strange objects were strewn in a rather pleasing clutter. The sort of mess that felt deliberate.
Difficult, but not impossible.
“What are you thinking, Sherlock?” he mutters, seconds too late. The message is already gone. No recalling it now. But why on earth would John want to go to dinner with him, when he’s probably got plenty of other things to do, plenty of other people to see? In fact, he could have other people he might want to date.
“So, I see you brought your book and everything,” John says. “But could you just give me one minute? I’ve got to finish writing down something—”
“Well, come on then,” he gestured.
She chuckles and lightly smacks his arm. “Just a quick breakfast, you silly boy. You’re far too thin. Besides, I hoped to catch your charming young man. I’ve never met a famous author before.”
Cheesy epilogue for the win. I just wanted an excuse to give our boys a bit more fluff and snogs :)
It was as if the universe heard these thoughts and moved to taunt him, because at that moment came a knock on the bedroom door.
“Okay, but you’re my biggest fan. And rather biased for an entirely different reason.”
“We took a vote, Captain,” Maddox said. “Some of the pirates told us what the plan is, that they’re after the bastards who sunk us. We want to help.”
“Well... no, not exactly. But you have to admit, it's kind of suspect isn't it?”
“Back to work,” she instructed. Her voice did not shake, John noted with admiration. “We’ll let you know how Winter fares, but for now you can do nothing for her but your duties.”
And the scarlet wave seemed to wash over Sherlock’s vision, saturating everything with the color, Moriarty’s laughter ringing loud in his ears. This is the end, those sails said. There is no hope.
“Is he your Valentine?”
“No!” John cried and dove forward.
Soon, John found himself in combat with a pair of wiry young pirates. They slashed at him with their rapiers while he tried time and again to dodge and block their blows, tried to put them off balance, tried to do something to guarantee himself victory. He aimed more than once with his pistol, but each time was unable to fire. Either one of the pirates would take a particularly vicious swipe at him, or someone from nearby would get in the way, or a glancing blow from behind would startle him. He needed a proper sword.
. The memory of the first time he had seen her, half-built but calling for him somehow, appeared in his mind’s eye. Followed by images of the
However, as he and Stamford drew nearer to the debris, suspicion crept into John’s mind. If that was the main mast, this had been too small a vessel to the one of the Royal Navy’s. Its size was more befitting something like a schooner. Likely not one of his friends’ ships then.
Sherlock hangs his head. “No one’s ever…” he repeats.
“Fine. How… how are you?”
“Fine,” he snapped. He stood. “I’ll see you.”
anything to him.
Sherlock continues, animated now with John as his captive — and captivated — audience. “And by the time I was heading into university, some of the — well, magic I suppose, had worn off. I’d found chemistry, and…” He shrugs again. “The rest you can infer.”
“You’re still sore from the battle, though the wounds have mostly healed. The tremor has gone again, finally, as have the effects of that blow to the head. Still. You aren’t completely well yet. I’ve been discussing this with Molly. She says that stab wound you cauterized needs more time to heal. Stretching, pulling, twisting—you should avoid movements like those.”
“It’s not time sensitive,” John said. “Come outside.”
John swallowed a small amount and gagged a bit. “How do you drink… whatever that is?” he sputtered.
John scoffed, cutting off Sherlock. “It may disappoint you to know, but the Navy deals with other things besides pirates. We don’t just sit around and gossip about your kind. Besides, what does one pirate matter?”
Maybe this was happiness.
“Where are my cannons?” Moriarty yelled. “Fire!”
“Thanks a million,” he said, a little breathless. “I’ll see you later, okay? Probably will be another late night.”
“I know it’s a lot,” John says. “I know you’ve never done this before. But if you think I’m worth it, if you think you can maybe come to trust me, tell me. You don’t have to open up, not all the way, not yet. Just tell me it’s possible. Please. Tell me that, and I’ll be patient. I’ll wait for you.”
John looked up just in time to see Sherlock blushing, and he squeezed his hand. "Well, you are. Now where are we headed to, boyfriend?"
They separate and relax back into the sofa cushions. John pours them more wine. “So is that why Mycroft is so… overbearing?”
Sherlock nodded. “I suppose you could call him that.”
The smile slipped off his handsome, tanned face as he stared at the man clutching Sherlock.
He clicked back to the chat and composed a reply.
But Sherlock is already diving into the box, shifting aside the styrofoam bits and pulling out one of the objects within. A leatherbound book, one of six. Each is a different color, though the gold lettering on the spines unites them as a series.
, he vowed.
John shifts in his chair, glad it is a soft seat for once. At his first signing, a few years before, he had felt rather shoved to the side in the large bookstore in central London, placed in a stiff-backed metal chair and left alone by the employees for the duration of his signing. Since then, he has searched for different, more welcoming venues. This shop is one of his favorites, and today marks his third signing with them.
“It’s there,” Sherlock said. His eyes were fixed forward. “The
“Dunno,” Greg shrugged. “But if we’re right about them being together, and if I’m right about him ignoring that text,
Trying to remain calm, John smiled at her. “If he wants to be.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together. “John,” he said. His voice was uncharacteristically tentative. “Come back to my cabin. You need a comfortable place to rest for a time. And… I feel there are still things we need to discuss. About… why I do this.” He gestured at the ship, the sea. “You do not yet have a full picture of… well, me, and I find that… unacceptable.” He frowned, as if at a loss as to why he felt this way. “I can send for food,” he added.
“I, er, came to see how you are, Winter,” he said and stepped over to kneel at Sherlock’s side.
“Fine,” Mycroft waves a dismissive hand. “But the business I had there was, as usual, none of yours.”
enveloping warmth on the sheets fading to chill,
The breeze filled the grey sails with steady, cool air. The ocean rolled in gentle waves beneath the hull. The sun shone in hot beams down onto the decks of the
Sherlock blinks but smiles. John radiates sincerity, and something about that fact makes Sherlock lower his guard again. “Alright.”
“Yes,” Sherlock sighed. “I’ve known for about a month. From the prison records, it seems he’s been out about six weeks.”
Sherlock’s smile widened. “You heard me. So, what are you waiting for?”
Sherlock shakes himself out of that particular memory when John’s voice catches his notice. “Do you think his company is doing something… dunno, illegal?”
Sherlock blinked, then nodded. His expression was still hard, icy. “Yes. Goodnight, Lieutenant Watson.”
giving you."
John stared, lips parted slightly. Speechless, he could only lean forward and kiss his pirate, hard but tender.
"Because he doesn't trust me."
to, though.
After she caught her breath, she located the correct door. Room 221 in the Baker History building. She glanced down at the syllabus for Watson’s class. Yes, this was the right one. She adjusted the strap of her bag on her shoulder, took a quick breath, then lifted her hand to knock on the closed door before her.
“Hey,” he replies with a grin. “Come on, sit down.”
John nodded. “In a while. There’s a few matters I need to take care of first.” Their navigator had taken ill, so John was scrambling to ensure the charting of their course had been completed properly. Still, a sparring session with James was not something he wanted to miss. John knew the former captain was an excellent fighter, had known ever since the day John had met him on a dock in France, several months ago. He had invited the man to join his crew after a day of talking and sparring, made him his Lieutenant a fortnight after that, and had never regretted his decisions regarding the man once since.
When he opened his eyes, he took in the deck. Sailors moved about their business, working with efficiency but also what appeared to be good humour. John hesitated. So far, he had not been treated badly here. In fact, he had been rather ignored more than anything else. It seemed the presence of a Royal Navy lieutenant was not a bizarre enough occurrence for the pirates to take much notice. Perhaps they had seen much stranger, which—considering the apparent eccentricities of their captain—was not so far-fetched a guess.
“You aren’t darkness, John,” Sherlock whispered. “You
John fiercely represses the word
“Sure there is. This is so far from civilization,” John countered. “If anything, we need it more out here.”
He returned the emptied cup to John’s hand and lay back. “I was on board a ship belonging to the East India Company. It was set upon, hence the situation in which you found me. It’s Victor, by the way. Victor Trevor.”
John had given his statement while Dr. Willner examined Sherlock; now the consulting detective had been declared without any serious damage and was giving his. He was pressing charges, he’d told John that much before they’d been separated, and he would testify if he had to. Hopefully, John thought to himself, Sebastian would be locked away for longer this time, and never bother them again.
“Well, speaking of idiots, I used to be an even bigger one. I had a crush on a boy in school who turned out to be the straightest male imaginable. Talk about embarrassing. You know fifteen year olds can’t be subtle.”
Yes, all in all, a fantastic day.
“Secure him,” he said, pointing at Sebastian. “But leave him to me.”
a profession. Besides, looking at you right now, you’re like a handsome — I don’t know, Victor Frankenstein, concocting genius creations.”
Could they really fix this?
“I’m fine. Do you think you’ll have many people at your signing?”
“And there was so much pressure,” he goes on. “Dad was so proud and excited, telling me I was carrying on his legacy, giving me advice, on and on and on. I couldn’t take it. So I didn’t go.”
“John!” he gasped when he shoved the pillow off and squirmed under John’s fingers, laughter bubbling out of him, uncontrolled. “No, stop! You’re being-! Ah! Ridiculous!”
you. I want you in any way you’ll have me.”
He didn't yet know how he would blink back tears when Sherlock would graduate university, how his fiance would look horribly bored during the ceremony but would burst into delighted laughter when John would produce a large bouquet of k-cups afterward.
Sherlock emerged from below-decks, leading a still-trussed Sebastian. John had nearly forgotten about him. The man was no longer gagged, but did not speak, even when he saw Winter. He simply glared and allowed Sherlock to push him toward the gangplank.
, he thought. Perhaps it was better that no one else knew about Sherlock. Not only would it be dangerous for the captain, but a part of John wanted to keep Sherlock to himself. A secret, carried in John’s heart, unseen by everyone else. Because no one in England—no one in the world, really—could possibly appreciate the way Sherlock Holmes had made John feel. He had brought John alive again in a way no other person ever had, had shown him wonders in the way he saw the world, from the way he reacted to life. No, no one could understand. And no one else should.
“The look on your face, when Sebastian had you. You were so scared. I should have been there to protect you-”
Donovan took over the department, and developed more than a grudging respect for Sherlock. John watched, incredulous, one day after a particularly grueling case wrapped, when Donovan smiled, clapped Sherlock’s shoulder, and asked him and John out for drinks.
They fall into silence. John rubs his hand down Sherlock’s arm, then drops it back to his side.
"Are you sure?" John pressed, unable to stop himself feeling a bit anxious. This felt nothing like how the movies made it seem...
Sherlock looks back and skids to a halt, surprise evident in his slightly parted lips. “What is it?”
“What are you talking about?” John asks.
“You should. This convention is inspiring.”
“What?” John exclaimed. “How did you-?”
But no. Sherlock may have never had anyone feel such things toward him, but now was not the time to allow his emotions to torment him. He had a job to do.
“I would,” he murmurs, and moves to retrieve his notebook from his bag. Digging it out, finding the right page, and handing it to John is less graceful than he’d have hoped, but John is kind enough not to comment. He only slides an arm around Sherlock’s waist and reads the poem silently. Sherlock resists the urge to fidget.
So much had changed in such a short time. Had someone told him just a fortnight ago that he would feel himself comfortable upon a pirate ship, even defensive of the captain’s motivations and fond of the crew, John would have hit them.
Molly married a funny, gorgeous surgeon. Sherlock played the violin at the wedding, and this time, he did dance with John.
Sherlock’s heart leapt and fluttered at the same moment, a dizzying sensation. For several moments, he couldn’t move. Then, in a blurry motion, launched himself forward into John’s arms. He kissed John, fierce and bold and excited, then yanked back before it could deepen too much. He had to say this; there would be time for more kissing after.
While she was gone, John stripped off Sherlock’s shirt and headscarf. Best to keep him cool, comfortable, and able to breathe easily. A jolt went through John at the sight of so much of Sherlock’s body revealed. He looked thin, too thin. And a narrow, ropy scar crossed the right side of his head, from his hairline to just above his brow. Another scar rested over his collarbone and continued for several inches, curving into the dip in the center of his chest.
’s crew are interested in women, and the others are tedious in their suspicions or prejudice against them. Besides…” his shoulders slumped, just a bit, just enough that John noticed. “I will not risk anyone else unduly. This is my fight more than anyone else’s.”
John nods. “Yeah. I suppose I’ve never told you much about… about my father, have I?”
but you aren’t allowed to see him.
Sherlock faltered a little at that. During the past month of frightening texts and burgeoning paranoia, Sherlock had still rarely allowed himself to think that word:
John there, wanted him to slide in next to Sherlock and curl around him as he used to. He wanted him to kiss Sherlock’s neck and whisper a soft “goodnight.”
They all chuckled again, and the conversation turned to other matters. Work, school, their weekend plans, and so on. This hour began to feel like their last free moment before returning to the pile of assignments looming over each of them. Greg was loath for it to end. But eventually, everyone began to filter away, heading to various destinations — most school-related — with grimaces and groans. Only Molly, fretting about her essay for Watson, stayed behind with Greg, who had nowhere in particular to be at the moment and was actively avoiding working on that same essay.
"So if they kept you so isolated, how did you get away?" Greg looked, despite John's vague replies, avidly interested. "They couldn't have let you go."
“What are you doing?” Sherlock smirked, leaning into his embrace.
blush harder. “So, does that mean yes?”
“I’m not sure why last night, really,” he admitted. “I could say something like the stars must have aligned" — Sherlock snorted, and John nodded in agreement — “but we both know that’s not true. I guess… maybe I just got tired of waiting for the right time.”
"How so?" Greg's forehead creased. "Did they mistreat you?"
These thoughts resounding in his head, John was the first to wrench his gaze away from Sherlock and his fathoms-deep eyes. “Listen, you act as if I should be endlessly thankful for what you have done for me. But I don’t see why. You’re the one who got me into this mess.”
Sherlock grins. “I’ll talk to you soon.”
“I would rather die a thousand deaths than work with you, Victor,” he whispered.
, he vowed, as he raised his gaze to look up at the silhouettes above him, stepping closer. Some had realized one on board was not, in fact, a pirate.
“Probably around here somewhere…” John trails off with a glance at the bookshelves, and his eyes widen slightly at something he sees in Sherlock’s face. “Oh, no. Don’t you dare even think about looking for it. You’re forbidden!”
“I’m first mate, you git,” John barked. “Now tell me what happened to the men and the ship.”
John turned them sharply, eliciting a surprised noise from Sherlock, who seemed pleased John was taking charge. He guided Sherlock toward the bed, but before they reached their destination, Sherlock staggered. He broke off the kiss and caught himself on the bedpost, breath catching.
That got Sherlock’s attention; he whipped his head up to look at John. “What?”
Sherlock flops back on the sofa, growing bored with simply listening to John talk, now merely about dates and logistics. He beckons his boyfriend over, stretching out in what he hopes is an inviting way. John smirks and joins him, settling against his chest, still making affirmative noises in response to Sholto’s words.
“You… you bought one?” Sherlock froze. That didn’t seem like normal breaking-up behavior.
She nodded. “Thank you. We will do our best to get you safely to port. I think we may have to stretch rations a bit to do so, and your men will have to sleep on the deck instead of the crew’s quarters, but-”
“With a few new books, I reckon,” John winks.
“Kitty-” Irene frowned. “You won. You don’t need to indulge his wounded pride.”
John ducked as Moriarty slashed at his head. The man’s technique was aggressive, his pale face contorted with anger.
“Thank you,” Holmes breathed after a pause.
Holmes nodded. “She has taken several courses with me.”
“He was… not a bad father, really. Stern, sometimes intimidating, but he did care about me. Maybe too much,” he concedes. “He was in the army when he was younger, and never really shut up about it. It was his passion, talking about it, telling me how wonderful it was and all. His dream was for me to join, and be just like him. Cliche, really.”
Certainly, Sherlock knows where John hides the draft — under layers of codenamed folders on his laptop — but he would rather not risk his relationship over something he
John shrugged. “Not as bad as I thought.” He wasn’t sure how to reply without giving himself away.
He glanced at John, who cocked an eyebrow at him.
Sherlock’s home on the
With care and with burgeoning, tentative hope, Sherlock moves between a small cluster of women, trying not to drop his books. He gets trapped between a short queue at the register and a display table of fantasy novels, though, and has to backtrack, cursing silently.
“Ah, ah, Sherlock,” he crowed, triumphant. “I know you’re not much up to speaking or moving right now—that was a rough ride you just had,” Moriarty continued, and again paused to let the men laugh and jeer. “However, this is your last chance to save your life. Join me, agree to sail with me, and I will spare you. We can conquer the globe, be rulers of the high seas, together.”
He looked back and smiled, amused. “You are entirely unafraid, aren’t you?” He chuckled. “The name is Captain Sherlock Holmes. Welcome aboard the
BOOM.
out of Sherlock’s arms. “I didn’t finish signing this one,” he tells Sherlock as he uncaps his pen once more.
John laughs, loud and freely, throwing back his head in a way that reminds Sherlock, somehow, of a child. He wonders if he has ever laughed that way, and marvels that it comes so easily to John.
“We should probably go all the way inside your flat,” he says, winded and exhilarated.
Sherlock swallows hard, burrowing into John’s embrace. “I…” He trails off, though, as if at a loss for what to say now.
Sherlock froze. “Please,” he whispered.
Sherlock pauses before replying, taking a moment to observe John. He’s now chatting amiably with an older man, who seems to not really know who this person is and why he’s sitting here writing in people’s books. Still, he appears to be enjoying the conversation, as does John. However, Sherlock does not fail to notice the way John has his knee pressed against Sherlock’s, gently but with enough pressure to be, without doubt, deliberate contact.
“Hmm. Very well, I’ll help, but only if you pipe down and let me read this.” And with that, Sherlock shifts away from John and opens the galley of
“It’s kind of absurd, you know,” John says, drawing Sherlock’s attention back to him with a gentle kiss to his fingers. “I know this event is only a couple days, but I still missed you.” He ducks his head, but Sherlock tilts it up again.
“Oh, you don’t?” Sherlock snaps. He has that tone John has begun to recognize now, that lofty, dismissive tone he adopts when he feels cornered.
“I don’t think that’s true,” he was saying to John, whose stance was still annoyed.
The pirate’s sudden touch on his hand was warm and steady. “Stop that,” he ordered. “I don’t believe touching that injury much just now would be beneficial.”
The water was cold, and a shock to his system. He oriented himself, hand still clutching the line, and gasped a breath. The man floated a short distance away, so John set off. His technique was unrefined, but it got the job done. He reached the man quickly, and moved close to examine him.
. “So you like the Sherrinford series? Is it perhaps because you both have unusual names? Lovely, of course, but unusual,” he adds with a swift smile.
“Yeah,” John shifted on the bed, not quite meeting Sherlock’s gaze. “Just the way you like it.”
had been behind this all along. They had documents, falsified signatures, so much treacherous evidence, all of which ‘proved’ my father had been in league with them for years. They claimed he had gone behind their backs, secretly dealing with the ship captains, then altering the formal reports to hide his crimes.
After he finishes going through the emails, he pulls up his documents, where he’s saved the notes on his new idea. He’d been writing them by hand days earlier, but has since transferred them to a digital format. Which is convenient, as he’s not at home and perfectly content to be so.
“I know. It’s a… private case.”
Several of the spectators moved forward, yelling. John was distantly aware of Irene making for Winter, but he himself launched himself at Sebastian. His fist against the man’s face was oh so satisfying.
But he was unconscious. John didn’t understand; he had been fine, mostly, moments ago.
John stared. “What?”
If I were to give an alternate name to this chapter, it would be "swords, info-dumps and snogs." You know, the essentials.
“Yes, a trading company that deals in stolen goods, illegal opium, unlawful weapons, and kidnapped men, women, and children.” Sherlock threw off the hands of the men holding him and straightened to his full height, though he stayed against the mast. Saying these words aloud gave him a sort of vindictive pleasure, despite the fact he was surrounded by the enemy. “You have ruined the lives of many, by your own hand or through your corrupt methods. This is a criminal operation, and this-” He gestured to the ship, and the entire crew watched the movement. “This ship is at the center of the web. You are correct, Captain Moriarty, in thinking that I am here to destroy you. Napoleon Bonaparte may be working to forge himself as emperor of the known world, but in a similar sense, you are the Napoleon of crime.”
She chuckled, then whimpered in pain. Sherlock shushed her, and John peeked around the corner into the room.
Sherlock tugged him closer, chest still heaving from exertion. “You’re the amazing one, John.”
“Only because Sebastian cheated,” Sherlock corrected her. “Had it been a fair match, you would have prevailed.”
“Oh. No, Doctor, I can tend to it. But thank you.”
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow. He’s painfully aware of the scrutiny of the others around them. A few more people had joined the line after him, and he feels their gaze upon the pair of them like a physical weight. “Am I permitted back there?”
"Sherlock, you're only nineteen."
They froze. Then, a grin spread across James’ face.
“Good,” John nods, seemingly satisfied, for he turns back to his cooking.
me, as if such a thing were inconceivable, ridiculous. I believed him. All the evidence I’d seen pointed to me being undesirable. This just fit in with that hypothesis.”
Sherlock chuckled. While John had made tea, he had unraveled himself slightly, though the blanket was still draped over him. He didn’t reply, but instead said, “I dreamed about you, earlier.”
the fire burning down to ash and embers
“Did he say what I think he did?” Ekene had asked. Sherlock, in his haste, had abandoned his usual awareness and neglected to sign his words for the man, or to face him fully.
down.”
, he scolds himself.
“Yeah, Sherlock’s not the best at communicating,” John muttered under his breath.
And everyone dispersed, pointedly ignoring Sebastian, though their eyes were full of fear and, in some cases, tears. Winter was clearly beloved on the ship by all.
“Good.” Her gaze was softer, until she fixed Sherlock with a half-concerned, half-stern look. “Eat,” she ordered. Once he took another bite, she strode from the room.
“I’m glad. Since the alternative was sitting at the bottom of the sea.”
"Sherlock, I completely destroyed that test," John was babbling excitedly as he reached him. "I haven't felt that good about a test ever, and it was amazing and you're amazing," he was beaming and squeezing Sherlock's hands again, a bit breathless from his half-jog over. "Thank you so much for helping me."
Sherlock bit his lip. “John, that is infected. You’ve clearly been feeling poorly all day. You need proper care, extended care. Possibly a hospital. And as it is, you are a liability on this ship. Besides, I know you have been worried for your crew. I am certain Captain Lestrade would be relieved to hear of your survival. You have obligations to them, to your life.”
“So what happened?” John asked once they had quieted. His hands stroked slowly up and down Sherlock's sides. “To the
A series of peculiar artifacts littered the shelf above it, as well as the surface of a small desk, which was shoved in the corner of the cabin. Several of those objects were recognizable as navigational tools—compasses, telescopes in varying sizes, measuring tools, and maps—but others looked like they would have been more at home in a scientist’s or professor’s laboratory than in the quarters of a pirate captain in the middle of the ocean. John could not identify most of these, though he did pick out a set of glass tubes and beakers, a magnifying glass, tools for cutting and slicing (rather like what a surgeon might use), and a real human skull.
He twisted away from John, lighting a lamp hanging nearer them; night had fallen by now, and the sky outside the ship was deep blue, shifting to black with each passing second. John took the moment to study Sherlock’s profile and to consider everything he had learned.
When John reaches the end, he doesn’t say anything for a moment. Sherlock, abruptly unable to bear the silence, starts babbling.
“What, to take care of you?” John giggles, then pulls Sherlock into his arms. “Nothing wrong with that. And I have to say, I love your parents.”
“I suppose,” Sherlock scowls.
, staring across the ocean. The
“There’s one matter I am unclear on,” John said, and felt both sets of eyes fix on him. “What are they doing? They’ve been running their operations for years, so why start attacking ships in the last few months? Especially allies— the EIC, even the bloody British Navy. What’s their goal?”
“They are not an official English programme, no,” Sherlock shook his head. “Some Englishmen are involved, but its leadership and operations transcend borders and nations. Thus, it is untouchable. Or at least, not easily touched.”
“Yes we are!” he insists, as if exasperated that he has to spell it out like this. “We’ve established this. We’ve started calling each other ‘boyfriend,’ we spend most of our free time together. We’ve also—” he cuts himself off, glances around, and continues in a lower voice. “We’ve also snogged all over what feels like half of London by now.”
And without a backward glance, he departed. John huffed. He couldn’t bring himself to regret insulting the pirate, though the quiet side of his conscience couldn’t hide the fact that he almost wanted Sherlock to stay and say more fascinating, frustrating things.
One month after their first kiss, Sherlock found himself leaning on the fence outside their building. He gazed up at the walls, idly wondering about the future. The university owned the place, filled with a dozen single-occupancy flats specifically for uni students, equipped with a bedroom, toilet, and a cramped sitting room-kitchenette combination. But both Sherlock and John’s residencies would end at the end of the spring term. Would they renew them, as some students did? Would they seek out real leases, in real flats?
“What are you going to do about it?” he grinned. “You’re all alone up here! It’s just you and me!”
But you...
Molly shooed John away before he could say anything, however. “Drink this,” she ordered as she helped him sit up enough to reach the cup.
“Not yet, why?” Greg asked. “Have you heard something new?”
He leaps up from his armchair and locates his bag—he will have to remember to purchase a new one soon, as this one split the night before. Digging out his mobile, he types out a quick message to John, barely concealing his grin.
Sherlock frowned, a bit perplexed. He clicked on the man’s profile photo and scanned the information there.
“When others walk through London, they see streets and buildings and cars. You walk through London and see stories.” He pauses. “I wonder what story you see when you look at my brother. I wonder how long your interest in it, and in him, will last.”
“Oh, come now, Sherlock!” Moriarty cried. Footsteps rattled through Sherlock’s fuzzy brain, and then Moriarty’s face loomed in front of him. His fingers brushed back Sherlock’s curls, and a mocking pout bloomed on the man’s lips. “It’s not a bad offer, is it? I might even spare your beloved little ship if you agree.”
“John!” Sherlock snaps, exasperated. “Can we maybe continue this conversation face to face? You know I dislike phone calls.”
John chuckles. “None taken. But surely there’s something else you could do with the chem degree? Other avenues?”
, John thinks, then is proud of his alliteration.
John nods again. God, he needs to pull himself together. He gives himself a mental shake and straightens his spine, meeting Sherlock’s gaze. Wordlessly, he hands Sherlock the piece of paper he’s been clutching for who knows how long.
Stay tuned next week for a new poem here that applies directly to the next installment in this series, which will be posted the same day and will be called
Then, nearly an hour later, his head whips up.
Sherlock laughed as John whacked him with a pillow. They settled down, exchanging a few kisses but still too worn from the festivities of the day before to take things further. A half dozen ten-year-olds would suck the energy out of anyone.
Written during the events of
“Night, Sherlock,” he whispered. He slid close and placed a hand on Sherlock’s arm, then, after a brief hesitation, wrapped it around Sherlock’s body, moving flush against the detective’s back.
“They don’t have to.”
“What is this about, Sherl?” Victor asked with a yawn. It was still early, and they had found a bleary-eyed Victor in the galley next to Sholto, who appeared equally sleepy. John wondered if they had stayed awake through the night, talking. He also found himself biting back a laugh at the nickname.
The next best thing is to do just that to this memory in his mind palace, so that is what he does.
The pirate’s eyebrow crept higher. “Believe me, I did not intend to have you aboard. Your men left you behind.”
Any historical inaccuracy I made in this was accidental, nor has this been beta-ed or Brit-picked. So if there are any major errors, feel free to let me know so I can address them.
He seized a protesting Victor’s arm and launched the man into the last longboat as it began to descend.
He was about to look up, to call for Molly and ask her to take Sherlock below to recover, when movement made him freeze. Sherlock coughed. His eyes flicked back and forth beneath their lids, and he stirred in John’s arms. With what appeared to be a monumental effort, Sherlock forced his eyes open.
“Yes,” John nods, not removing his thumb. “I have to tell you, those passages where Sherrinford figures everything out were the hardest parts of writing. I always became very aware of my own lack of intelligence during those scenes. I wish I’d known you then; you could have helped me make them sound impressive and logical.”
Moriarty grinned, like a pleased schoolteacher burdened with a particularly slow student who had just realized one and one made two. “Of course. Go on.”
“That would be around when I met you,” John said to Sherlock. “But why would Mycroft not tell you Victor was alive? He had no reason to keep that from you.”
“That stakeout looking for those drug dealers on campus. How could I forget that? Some mad chemistry professor demanding I come with him because I apparently knew the suspect from my massive World History lecture. As if I’d know one student out of two hundred.”
to read them. She’s… insistent.”
Sherlock avoided his gaze with stubborn determination, but he replied. “And you’re here, alright? You’re here, making me come over all sentimental!”
Sherlock shrugged. “Perhaps. But we need to focus on getting you off this ship safely.”
Irene opened her mouth to speak further, but a hand on John’s shoulder distracted them all. John glanced around to come face to face with Maddox and the other survivors of the
“He’s pretty tired,” Lestrade said. “He needs to go home and rest. Looks like he barely got any sleep last night.
At that, Sherlock’s cheeks bloom with red, and he ducks his chin. John sees his small smile, though, and tilts his head back up with two fingers. He strokes his thumb across his boyfriend’s lips, which curl into a pleased grin under it, and which pucker to kiss the pad of John’s thumb.
“Sir!” a voice yelled, and John realized it belonged to that of Sebastian Moran, face bloodied and eyes full of fury. “Should we abandon ship?”
“John,” he gasped. His voice had somehow dropped an octave, vibrating right down to John’s very bones.
He looked up and waved in greeting. Molly Hooper had just entered the classroom, her flowery messenger bag swinging off her shoulder and a small smile on her face.
He strode down the stairs. John followed, startled.
John chuckled and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. “Alright, alright.” He sat back but did not release Sherlock’s hand.
Lestrade’s eyes flashed. “He’s treating you okay, though, right?”
John ignored him for the moment, instead turning to the woman. “You’re the doctor?”
Rosie. Mary’s death. Shutting Sherlock out. Culverton Smith. The morgue.
Perhaps fairy lights
Sherlock nodded. “The members of that company are criminals, of a higher order than mere pirates. They are embedded in the fabric of European society, masquerading at being respectable when really their reputation is built on violence, corruption, and death. I cannot abide the hypocrisy.”
Sherlock nods, clutching his new book—he’d finally settled on the Davy biography, after much deliberation and some input from John—to his chest. John squeezes his arm and starts to step away.
John flushed slightly, remembering that bit of their last conversation. “I suppose I am.”
“Well, I love
Sure enough, he spotted Sherlock standing by the prow of the ship with another pirate. The captain had been elusive the past week, not coming to see John in the infirmary once.
After nearly an hour, John pauses to take off his reading glasses, rub his eyes, and massage his hand. As he does so, he marvels at the atmosphere. This is… comfortable, familiar, as if they’ve done this a hundred times and now take it for granted. In reality, they’ve only worked side by side like this a handful of times, and always in one of their flats rather than in public.
were just disguises for a snake poised to strike
“I was sentimental, in other words,” Sherlock growled. “I allowed myself to care about him, I practically became a pirate because of him!” He looked at John, eyes wide. “My entire adult life has been built on a lie.”
Sherlock's laughter, so bright and joyous, sustains him for the rest of the signing.
A pause. Sherlock and Lestrade glanced at each other. Then, the latter shook his head, and Sherlock made a negative noise.
“Where is my ship? What of my men?”
Sherlock’s shoulder lifted, then fell. “Not precisely. Curious, yes.”
“Prove it.”
After several minutes, John lowered the phone. He stood again, paced a few times back and forth in front of the sofa, and then at last turned to stare at Sherlock. His face was no longer as horrified. But now, it was laced with anger too.
Scotland Yard… Sebastian’s threats to John… the roof… the knife…
Everyone seemed to leap into action. John himself darted to the railing, glancing up toward the crow’s nest on his way, to see his watchman pointing.
like it tastes unpleasant.
“Definitely not,” John shakes his head ruefully. “I scrapped that entire story, actually. Moved onto other things. In fact...” he muses. “That was the story I worked on before coming up with Sherrinford.”
Sherlock managed a small nod, then realized what was missing from the picture.
Irene grinned, all teeth. “Excellent. I think I’ll go next,” she declared, to raucous cheers. “And I think I’d like to spar…” She turned her gaze onto each pirate in turn, before stopping her sweep at John. “The sailor boy.”
Now, against the just-closed door of the hotel room, Sherlock lets John press kisses to his mouth, face, neck. He grins, wraps his arms around John, and tilts his head back.
It is a testament to how much Sherlock cares about him that he actually sets the galley aside in favor of kissing John.
“Sherlock…” he brushed back the man’s curls. The past four weeks, Sherlock had carefully dodged every mention of Victor/Moriarty, until John had at last decided to wait. Sherlock would bring it up when he was ready, he had told himself.
Three rings, and then a voice on the other end of the call. “Hello?”
“They know,” Lestrade murmured, voice low and tense. “They know the skies aren’t clear today, so they're staying back just far enough that we can't identify them but close enough to keep us marked.”
“Sherlock,” John murmured. His nerves — which he’d been able to ignore during the party — were gaining ground on his forced calm. He’d planned this, rehearsed it in his head multiple times, but with the moment approaching, the anxiety was returning.
“Well, I'm glad he did,” John smiles at both Ethan and the girl. Ethan beams back, and the girl grins at him, giving him a look and a significant glance at John. It's a look Sherlock can't quite decipher. Is she egging her brother on? Why? To what end?
That sounded… distant. Cautious, John lifted his head and scanned the area through the seawater that streamed from his hair into his eyes. The wreckage of several longboats floated, unmanned, their occupants unmoving. Wood, sails, and ropes dotted the water, and the hulking mass of the
John frowned. A thought had occurred to him. “What about the
“Not well enough,” John muttered, and the man grinned.
Standing there, Sherlock subdues a shiver. He feels as if he and John are on a precipice, in a droplet suspended at the end of a pipette over a solution, poised and anticipating the incendiary reaction.
As John drifted off, he wondered. What was he going to do when he had to tell this pirate farewell?
“Man overboard!”
“Fine,” Sherlock said, and he instantly wished his voice hadn’t sounded so small.
“Can I help?” he says upon reaching the kitchen.
The words send a wave of wistfulness through Sherlock. He misses John, sitting alone here. The writers conference is an exciting opportunity, the chance for John to network, attend panels and discussions, meet fans and other authors, and get to know new publishers. They’d both been delighted when John’s agent Mike had called John about it, but now, faced with another day and a half of being on his own, Sherlock cannot help but feel a bit melancholy and anxious.
to sign it as well.
lingering on him. A sort of noodle soup,” Sherlock adds in response to the confused question that springs to John’s lips. “He favoured it last time he went there, and there’s one restaurant he always goes to that uses a very distinctive blend of coconut milk and curry spices.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and pulled his hands from John's, cradled his face, and pressed their lips together again. John grinned into the kiss, his own hands reaching up to brush hesitantly against the nape of Sherlock's neck. Sherlock had no idea how to kiss, so allowed John to take the lead. John was gentle, just barely putting pressure on Sherlock's mouth, keeping his own lips firmly shut. It was a kiss that left Sherlock wanting more.
She shook her head. “No idea. Why would he do that?”
“You are remarkable, Captain Watson,” Victor said. “You’ve captured the heart of Sherlock Holmes. I thought he was certainly meant to remain forever wed to his desire for adventure and revenge.”
He and John chatted back and forth during the cab ride (mostly about John’s inability to craft his own pick-up lines), but once he arrived at Oxford Circus, Sherlock put his phone away. Too many people, tourists and shoppers alike. He didn’t trust that there wasn’t a pickpocketer hiding among them. So, unfortunately, John would have to wait.
At least, he’s content with that for a while.
The night before, after the Sebastian debacle, John had gone downstairs to his own flat to shower and sleep. However, as Sherlock lay in his bed, alone, he found that he couldn't bring himself to close his eyes. And it wasn't the caffeine from the half-finished coffee earlier; it was adrenaline and fear still thrumming through him. So after nearly an hour, he rolled over and snatched his phone from the bedside table, nearly ripping the charger from the wall in the process.
“Yeah?” John met his gaze, brushing an especially unruly lock of hair off Sherlock’s forehead.
The swelling had increased, as had the yellowish area. Worse, the yellow parts had taken on a green tint as well. When Sherlock brushed his thumb along the edge, John winced and pulled back. The inflamed area was sensitive and almost itchy with pain.
John reached under his pillow and pulled out the ring box.
“John-”
“I didn’t know you played violin,” he said, voice low.
“Let me know if you need anything else, Mr. Watson,” the twentysomething girl says as she sets down a water bottle on the table. “I’ll be just over there.”
Sherlock sucks in a startled breath as he peers inside. “John…” He reaches inside and extracts the new leather shoulder-bag. It’s formed of smooth, black leather with one large compartment as well as two smaller ones on the front. Inside is another, more hidden zippered pocket. The strap is thick and sturdy but flexible, as are the sides of the bag—where the old one had split. On the front flap, John had had an ornate “S” embroidered.
John nodded. “I’d best get him something to eat then.”
“Gladly,” the man whispered, breath ghosting over Sherlock’s skin. He stepped back a bit then, and set his lantern on a hook dangling from the ceiling.
John laughs. “Well, okay, I have two presents for you.”
John swallowed. “I am remaining aboard. My reasons are my own.”
Still fuming, he entered the building, clipping his ID onto his shirt. He waved to the receptionist, who nodded back. He was just about to head to A&E to check in with his supervisor when he realized… he was wearing the wrong ID badge. This was his university ID, not Bart’s. He cursed under his breath and shot a glance at his watch. He would have to head up to his desk and grab the right one. He’d be cutting it close, but ah well. He was covering for someone; that had to give him some kudos.
profession at the moment.”
, sailing the seas and having adventures, and had he once thought of John? Had he even wanted to find him again?
Sherlock shifted. “Well, yes. Though I had neglected to eat as much as I apparently should have days before that.”
eventually get to read. He still doesn’t enjoy this tedious exercise in patience, though.
“It was just a spar,” Sebastian insisted again.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, amusement saturating his voice. He lifts his head to meet John’s gaze, and beneath the desire in his expression, John thinks he can discern a thread of insecurity. “Would you like to come up?”
“But…” John bit his lip. “You
In the streets, they pause and deliberate on the pavement for a moment before deciding to simply order takeaway when they get back to Baker Street; neither feels like combating weekend restaurant crowds.
Then, Sherlock twisted to gaze at John, those intense eyes sharp. “John… I may have become a pirate, at least in part, because of Victor. Or… in spite of Victor. Moriarty. But… I want to become a better person, a good person, because of you.”
“Because I think, without understanding it” — he paused, harrumphed at sharing so many private thoughts and emotions, then pressed on — “I somehow knew I was waiting for you.”
Sherlock huffs a soft laugh, but it comes out only half-amused. “But that doesn’t sound so bad. Besides, we talk a lot about your writing and my school work.”
John edges closer, placing a hand on Sherlock’s knee. “Hey. Sherlock. Listen. You’re only twenty-five years old. And yes, you’re a genius, but you don’t have to have all the answers. You don’t have to have your entire life planned out. You can just think about what you want to do in the next weeks, hell, the next
“Oh, I don’t know,” he paused at the door and gave Sherlock a mirthless, cold smile. “I don’t really think I need to tell you, do I?”
“Because I haven’t let you see,” he says. “When I came to your book signing, I was making sure I was polite and friendly because I admired your writing. And when I saw you…” His cheeks heat, remembering how flustered he had been, when he had realized that his favourite author was also heart-stoppingly handsome and charming. “I wanted you to like me in return.”
He remembered last night, the look on Sherlock’s face when he’d whispered, “
“It’s a tough one,” he replies. “I’ll have to spell it for you.”
Reluctant, John broke the kiss and turned his head. Irene stood there, a smirk on her red lips, which shone in the moonlight.
“Well then, what about this?” John snapped, returning to the phone and brandishing it toward Sherlock. “These bits where he talks about me, and Bart’s, and… and us? You didn’t see fit to worry me then?”
John grinned and squeezed his hand. “Happy birthday, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, will you please tell me what’s wrong?” John finally breaks the silence. “Why are you so upset I saw you talking to that bloke?”
Sherlock shifted. “I’ve been well.” He sounded uncertain.
Sherlock allowed her to drag him away, smiling. John watched, affronted. That was it? Relegated to a menial task and dismissed?
“Stop thinking, John, I’m trying to sleep.”
He staggered and fell against the railing. Below, floating in the waves, were bodies of his men. “Oh, God,” he gasped.
“I know you, Sherlock,” Moriarty breathed, confirming Sherlock’s worst fears. The man had shifted close again, eyeing him. His hands moved to Sherlock’s sides, lightly feeling the lines of his hips. Sherlock suppressed a shudder as Moriarty leaned close. “I know you better than anyone. Your lust for freedom, for revenge, your brilliance and arrogance. No one else understands. No one else ever saw it, not even Mycroft. And certainly not your little idiotic Navy man.”
Sherlock tilted his head, satisfied with the response. “What did you want to discuss?” The sooner he could get to the point Sebastian wanted to make, the better.
“Well, I’m sure you can hold your own against him,” Sherlock says back. “You’re the one with actual experience. He thinks he’s going to be the next Hemingway, though why anyone would aspire to that, I’ve no idea.”
“You aren’t supposed to be walking about,” John chastised, though he was rather distracted by Sherlock’s mouth to muster a stern enough tone.
Pathetic. When had he gotten so pathetic? When had he had to get any sense of confidence from a simple pat on the back from a Detective Inspector who hardly knew him? What had happened to his own self-confidence?
Spluttering and terrified, Sherlock barely noticed the backs of his legs hit the roof’s ledge. When it sunk in a moment later, his mind went into overdrive at the same instant his heart too went haywire. He could hear both John and Lestrade crying out.
“Wanted to make sure you were alright.” John leaned forward so their noses knocked together. Sherlock smiled. “Are you?”
When he had begun this line of work, he had never dreamed of doubting the Navy. Now, on the other hand, he wondered how much longer he could justify working with men who might be in the pockets of the NOTP, or at least who did not act against it. He wondered if he could truly turn his back on the job that had helped give him purpose and which—indirectly—had led him to the greatest man he had ever known.
“How flattering,” Moriarty grins. “Someone so handsome, a fan of mine.”
And Sherlock would have to get used to sleeping alone again.
By Sherlock Holmes, age 24, December.
John lies there, letting his eyes drift closed again and listening to the fall of the water. A small — probably giddy — smile spreads across his face as images of the previous day dance before his closed eyelids. Spending time with Sherlock, selling almost two dozen books, putting his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders in the bookstore, speaking with fans, eating dinner with Sherlock, meeting Mrs. Hudson, declaring Sherlock as his boyfriend…
John stood frozen in place, cradling his newly cleaned shoulder, and stared until the ship had departed. He did not move, fixated on the horizon until all evidence of the vessel—even its foamy wake—had vanished.
He opens the window a bit farther and sticks his head outside. Sherlock is sitting on the fire escape, hunched over. A bright red-gold pinprick reveals the cigarette in his hand.
“Well…” Sherlock was still frowning. “What is this about?”
a brand new boyfriend in his flat — Sherlock would not be caught dead washing up. However, today, he stoops to doing so, cleaning the dishes from breakfast, the contaminated mugs, and both kettles.
The fairy lights are off that morning
Sherlock laughs. “John, I’m a chemistry student. I don’t have the formal training you and your students have. I can hardly even be considered a real poet. What does iambic pen-whatever mean?”
John bit his lip. He could feel Sherlock watching him but couldn't bring himself to look into those fathomless eyes. "I think we're doing a lot better. I think we've come far since then," he murmured.
Sherlock snorted as he joined him. “Of course I do.”
Sherlock flushed a rather fetching pink. “I have contacts in most ports by now. Using their information, I’ve been able to piece together their usual route and schedule.”
“Are you challenging me to write a rhyming poem, John?”
John simply gaped. How could Sherlock suggest something so hazardous? This was the
Turning away, he hesitates to change clothes; John likes this particular outfit. A smirk takes up residence on his lips as he opens the door and strides back into the main room, still wearing his deep aubergine shirt and black trousers. His smirk widens at the appreciative glint he sees in John’s eyes as his boyfriend passes him to take his turn in the loo.
“Yeah,” he jumped in, grinning at the memory. “They were all giggly in the corner, even though they were supposed to be mingling.”
Distracted, John watched as Victor reached James, who turned to greet him. They smiled at each other, then, to John's surprise, they began to speak. Sholto rubbed at the back of his neck, a sure sign to John that he was self-conscious. But whatever he said made Victor burst out laughing, the sound pealing across the waves, full of happiness. John felt his own lips quirk upwards; he had not yet heard the man laugh, and was glad to now, after all the man had been through. Sholto smiled at Victor, and even from a distance, John could see the softness in his eyes.
“Mrs. Hudson, what did you do?” he sighs, crossing the room and giving her a one-armed hug, which belies the irritation in his tone.
“You saved my life,” Sherlock murmured. “I couldn’t give the signal-”
, presses their mouths together in a zealous kiss, relaxes his hands on Sherlock’s wrists, clutches at his shirt. The moment Sherlock is free to do so, he wraps his arms around John. As the taller man pulls him even closer, John lets out a low groan and grazes his tongue across Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock shudders at the sensation and parts his lips slightly, and the kiss deepens.
John leaned against the portside railing, momentarily finding himself lost in thought as he gazed back at the strange ship. He had never encountered much trouble while at sea, in the five years he had sailed. Violent storms, hidden reefs in the shallows, even shark-infested waters. But thanks to good fortune, he had seen nothing quite like this. He had gone to the Mediterranean, around Africa, even as far as Asia, and not once had the ship been boarded or even threatened.
Sherlock chuckled. “I know just the place. Ready?”
John nodded. “You slept, like, eighteen hours or something.” He shot Sherlock a knowing look. “Have you not been sleeping again?”
“Sherlock, I-”
Trying not to let my fingers sweat in yours?
The cafeteria was bustling, but not overly so at this time of day. The noise levels were sufficient, though, to cover their conversation from other ears.
He tossed his coat down and bent over the teachers’ computer, signing on with rather aggressive keystrokes. Molly watched, frowning. He seemed especially irritable today; she wondered if it had anything at all to do with what Greg had seen — or thought he had seen — after Watson’s class earlier.
“Actually,” Lestrade called before they got more than a few steps away. “Let me drive you. The Tube will be busy.”
Molly cursed under her breath and dropped to her knees, first grabbing the article and neatening the corners. As she slipped it into her bag, she heard the voices of her two professors continue. She looked up.
“Yes,” Victor’s forehead creased. “Have you heard of me?”
That evening, John found his way to the infirmary. Ekene had already been and gone, beaming at John when he had caught sight of him in the crew’s quarters.
“To Father Christmas, make my puppy better.
“Poetry,” Sherlock murmurs after a beat. He does not elaborate, and John does not push him. Instead, he takes up the last two books and opens one. He signs it with quick and confident pen strokes, then pulls
But Sherlock intercepts him. He seizes the first mug and sniffs it guardedly. “John,” he says sharply. “You… didn’t use
By the time Molly located the pipettes, the other students, only about a dozen in number, were filing in and setting out their belongings on the black lab tables. Molly handed Holmes the box and moved to sit next to her lab partner, a girl she'd probably only exchanged twenty words with the entire term thus far. She usually spent most of the lab texting under the table, leaving Molly to do the work, only chipping in on occasion.
Mycroft nods, obviously sensing John’s internal struggle. “Indeed. It was a…” he pauses, considering just as John had a moment ago, and fixing him with that almost frightening stare again, “pleasure to meet you, Mr. Watson. I do hope you know what you’re getting into with him.”
He yanked John away from her and her soft laughter around to the foremast. They settled against it, wrapped up close.
“Guess so. We could always ask Watson, ‘hey, professor, do you happen to have a love bite we can examine? For science?’ ”
He swallows, and John’s heart clenches at the sight. “Hey,” he says. “We can go as slow as you like. We can just—”
“We don’t need Lestrade,” Sherlock crossed his arms. “I have my own ways of finding people.”
“Her place,” Sherlock repeated, soft and low and sinister. “And what place might that be?”
Sherlock let out a surprised huff of a laugh. "Of course it was," he replied earnestly, seeing John's shoulders sag in relief. "We've technically been boyfriends for weeks now."
“Well,” John said. “Whatever your reasoning, I am glad you made that choice.”
Yet at the same moment, while Sholto gives him a much warmer smile now and points him down an aisle, Sherlock wonders.
“Cannon fire, Captain!” Winter called down from the crow’s nest. “To the southwest!”
Damn!
Sherlock, having sipped some of his drink at that very moment, choked and coughed. Sputtering, he surfaced and gaped at John.
“I grew impatient waiting to meet your new… pal,” the man responds, and holds out a hand to John. “Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Watson.”
“What do you want, Sebastian?” Sherlock asked. He made sure to keep well out of arm’s reach, even as he approached the man. He got about ten feet away then stopped, watching warily.
“Please, Sherlock, was I wrong to look into those people?”
Sherlock rounds the corner, wearing striped pyjama pants and an old, inside-out t-shirt under a navy dressing gown. His still-damp hair sticks a bit to his forehead and the nape of his neck, and his curls are even wilder than usual. When he sees John, his expression softens. However, when he sees Mrs. Hudson, he rolls his eyes and huffs in amusement and exasperation.
Mycroft blinked once. When he spoke, his voice was low. “You are certain of this?”
Sherlock's expression fell. “We were ambushed. It was the middle of the night without a moon, so they surprised us. By the time we mustered our weapons, she'd been so badly injured by their cannonfire, it was too late.”
But why? Sherlock’s thoughts whirled, faster now, as Moriarty continued to eye him in the dim orange light. Why would Victor turn his back on everything they had fought for, for years, without a hint of remorse?
The night after, once the streamers and balloons and general party detritus was finally cleared away completely, John collapsed into bed next to Sherlock. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.
Molly blinked. “Because what?”
Sherlock inclined his head, but eyed John with a keen gaze. John, used to his pirate’s sharp observational skills, didn’t react other than to straighten his posture a bit.
“If you're about to make excuses-” Watson snapped.
“It’s alright,” John said with a sigh. “It isn’t your fault.”
I dodge fickle, disloyal feelings
“I hid it in Mrs. Hudson’s place,” John says, smirking. “Open it.”
“Molly, come quickly. It’s Sherlock, he… he just collapsed.”
?” John asked to take the focus off Victor for a moment. “They traced us because of James?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want oat-mill!” Rosie replied. Her small voice was still sleepy, and John was abruptly glad that she didn’t have school and he didn’t have work today. They could all just relax.
And John set down his tea on the table beside his chair, slid to the floor between his seat and the other, and took Sherlock’s hand into his. “No,” he breathed, with heart pounding. “Don’t think like that.”
John and Ekene forced themselves to gulp down a small meal, neither speaking. The images of what had happened to Winter kept flashing in front of John’s eyes each time he blinked. She was so young… He felt rather sick at the thought that she might not survive.
“Fair enough. She and your mum get along well.”
But John shook his head again. “It’s not even that. I… for a long time, I couldn’t really explain why I held back. I told myself it was because he was a man, and that I wasn’t ready to face that part of myself. But now I don’t think that was it.”
Before Sherlock could reply, Irene darted over, and they broke apart. “Alright, mon capitans?”
Yet at the same time, when he saw John’s reply—a single wink face—he supposed it could be worse.
Sherlock stared. Whoever this was seemed to know him, John, and about their relationship. But… it couldn’t be… No. He refused to believe it. There had to be another explanation. His thumbs quavered as they typed a reply.
Now, John was used to feeling unsteady; he did live on a ship, after all. He did not, however, expect to feel as if the floor were rocking at this particular moment.
“I hope so,” she ground out. Her face was pale and, as John watched, a tear streaked down it toward her temple. But Sherlock’s finger was there, brushing it away.
“Thanks, love,” he says, tracing across Sherlock’s cheekbone with his thumb. Sherlock presses into the touch, then turns his head to kiss John’s palm.
Greg finally shook his head slightly, focusing.
“Of course,” Irene's teeth gleamed behind her scarlet lips. “Sexy history prof. Pretty fair with his marks but sadly pretty immune to my charms. He says he wants me to succeed on my own merit.” Her eye roll was so impressive it was nearly audible.
“Hey, Greg, you will not believe what I saw today!”
together. If you want.”
Bang. The door swung open and bounced back off the wall. Everyone in the room jumped and turned to find Professor Holmes swishing into the room, his dark coat billowing behind him.
“That was not the plan,” Sherlock protested. “When we started this, we promised not to go off on our own. You and I were in this together with Mycroft.”
“Yeah,” John chuckles, stepping closer. “What about it?”
John swallowed. “Good.” He surveyed Sherlock, then looked away as if the sight of him was somehow painful. “You should go to bed. You look like you’ve had a long day.”
“I don’t like those biscuits,” Sherlock eyed the bready discs with a dubious air.
Then, a question came to mind, one he had been agonizing over all night as he had replayed the conversation with Sherlock over and over. “You really aren’t going to kill me?”
He then whispered in Sherlock’s ear, breath condensing on Sherlock’s cheek. “By the way, Sherlock, really? Your taste appalls me. You could do much better.”
“Sorry.” He tilts his head up to meet Sherlock’s gaze again. “You just deserve to feel confident, all the time, no matter what.”
“What makes you say that?”
You risk so much to feel
Lestrade seemed to have realized this as well, for not a moment later his voice rang out, strong and loud over the fighting and the rain.
“It’s only been two months—” Sherlock begins. It seems his mind has decided off its own accord to go on the defensive.
Sherlock nodded. That had been one thing he’d been able to decide on definitively during John’s absence. He had to stop Sebastian and try to salvage this mess.
gets past his walls.”
He looked back at Victor. “What-?”
"He'll get over it," Sherlock assured him. "I know you're wonderful. He's just slow on the uptake, as in most things."
Sherlock’s shoulders slumped in relief, but John continued. “In the morning. I’m going to check on my men.”
“Of course.”
Because surely John was going to break up with him. His stomach dropped through the mattress onto the floor as the door opened.
Sherlock let out a bark of laughter. “That seems very… chaste.”
He expects Sherlock to suggest dinner, or drinks, or something. He doesn’t expect the suggestive glint in his boyfriend’s eyes.
John has only a towel around his hips, and his skin looks soft, damp, and tantalizing. He smiles when he notices Sherlock’s eyes on him.
"Ah, so romantic," John drawled. "Really, I'm feeling so seduced right now."
“So, Lieutenant,” he teased, amusement sparkling in his every syllable. “How do you feel, having awoken in the bed of a pirate?”
“Dunno, Captain,” Moran said.
John bursts out laughing as they step over the threshold of the bookstore. "
“True.” John kisses him once more, then stretches out on the bed. “So, what shall we do tonight? We can order room service, or go out. There’s probably a bunch of authors at the hotel bar. You can meet some of my competition.”
The sound of Sherlock’s voice brings a grin springing to John’s face. “In here, you.”
“Sorry, Greg,” Janine said seriously.
The other crew was firing their weapons at the longboat that had just reached the surface. The men on it fought back, but one by one, they fell.
He turns back to his phone, stifling a smug smile.
John’s eyes widen. “You heard…?” He seems to have not realized Sherlock was within earshot while John was speaking with Ethan and his sister.
“Erm... John…” he gives him a look that is now decidedly flirtatious.
He had been down here working for over an hour now, after hiding in the bilge until certain that the
“The pleasure was mine, Molly,” John waves at her as she makes to depart. He turns back to Sherlock, whose face still is decidedly ruby.
“John!” James Sholto emerged from below-decks, a frown on his face.
Nor had it helped when two weeks ago Mycroft had called about a fight and a stabbing in a prison in the outskirts of London. Sherlock had answered and gone still, shoulders slumping in surprise and relief as he’d sought John’s gaze.
“Pirates.” John breathed. He was hardly aware of speaking aloud.
“How? He always buttons up his shirts all the way.”
“It’s over,” Sherlock murmured. When he turned back to John, he was smiling. He was still disheveled, bloody, and soaked. But the look of awe on his face, the exhilaration, the relief, made him stunning.
And, slowly, he healed.
John laughs as he goes for his phone. “Not that you’re biased.”
John turned and found standing before him, just as tall and curly-haired and brilliant as ever, was Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock twisted with a groan to look over the railing and across the waves. The
“Good,” Sherlock says. The two siblings stare each other down for a moment, seeming to have a silent conversation John has no hope of following. “I hope your trip to Singapore proved fruitful for the election proceedings.”
Sherlock chuckles. “Well. Thank you.” He meets John’s gaze with a slightly crooked smile on his face.
worried.
Sherlock groans. “Bossy.” He lets go, though, and John switches off the light, plunging them into warm darkness.
“Did it go alright?”
When they were an estimated two days from Lisbon, the dawning light found John waking with shivers wracking his body. He rolled over, groaning. Sherlock’s head popped up from the pillow next to him.
Lazy from the drowsiness that still clings to them, they kiss for a while, enjoying the warmth and softness of Sherlock’s bed. John is glad; he’d feared for a while that, with how serious Sherlock tends to be, he would not be much in the Christmas spirit. Luckily, he’s been… well, at least not
could shoot forward out of the sunlight. But fear for Sherlock infected him beyond the point of rationality, and when John caught sight of the pirate captain limp in the hands of the enemy, John gave the helm to Ekene, sent a warning shot across the
“What’s that? CCTV?” John asked.
Sherlock's smile vanished. “You... you did?”
“Do…” Watson cleared his throat. “Do you forgive me?”
Or… himself, for allowing both things to happen?
Nearly an hour later, when she was nearly halfway through scrawling her conclusion, Molly risked a glance up. Holmes was sat behind his desk, staring intently at his phone. Again, this was unusual behaviour for the stern professor: his anti-phone policy was notoriously strict, and he always spent labs pacing between tables, answering questions and critiquing work.
He turned on his heel to find John approaching with a small smile on his face. And in spite of their lack of communication lately, Sherlock felt his heart leap at the sight of him. He smiled back and waited in front of the door for John to catch up, making a deduction with every step his boyfriend took.
, he tells himself.
baritone, breath against John’s ear.
John gave a stiff nod, then turned and departed.
“You have betrayed a crew member. In doing so, you have also betrayed me.” Sherlock's voice was now so soft, John had to strain to hear him over the waves. “When we arrive at port, you will depart. You are no longer a part of this crew.
Sherlock was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he barely noticed that John left the room, only surfacing when the DI then immediately turned to Sherlock.
“Did you really mean it?” John blurts out, interrupting Sherlock suddenly. For once, he is the one who is blushing. “I—I mean, what you said, to Mrs. Hudson about me.”
“It was my idea, actually. I did not want to risk you by contacting you. I feared what would happen if such an organization as the East India Company learned who you were and what you were trying to do. It may not affect them directly, but they hate pirates with a notorious passion.”
But before Sherlock could speak, a man burst out of the storage closet, a knife in his hand. The killer, obviously having hidden himself in the closet during the confusion after the victim collapsed. Waiting for a chance to escape, remaining trapped by the horrified TfL employees and commuters, panicking when hearing the investigation... Sherlock heard Lestrade’s yell, but he was already moving. He threw himself forward, attempting to stop the man. Everything became a flurry of limbs, but then Sherlock reeled back. Pain was lancing up his side, fire was burning him from the inside out, he was bleeding, he was…
He locked the phone and shrugged, casual as could be. “False alarm. It was from a study partner from one of my classes.”
Sherlock’s eye roll was so obvious as to be physically palpable. “Well, I am glad you are enjoying yourself. I only request you do not get yourself mortally wounded anymore. It is growing rather tiresome.”
And that was when the
He did not mind, however. His emotions were confused and jumbled and baffling. Part of him wanted to rush to Sherlock and hold him until every bad feeling faded, but another part wanted to shake the man and demand why he had not come looking for John. And to demand why he had been so content to let John think him
“Aw, come on, Lestrade,” Irene rolled her eyes. “Where’s your sense of adventure? Of curiosity?”
The pirate’s infirmary was cleaner than John had presumed it would be. Very sparsely supplied, but neat and organized. He had been picturing a filthy, wet, horrible space. Not… this.
Spider…
He lunged forward.
He had never expected to mourn a pirate, and yet here he was.
“I love you,” Sherlock smiled up at him, an almost shy look.
"That's fine," John said quickly. "That's perfectly alright. I... I don't want to mess things up with you."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Wait, I..."
“You know what I mean!” John cries. “You never offer anything up, any of the usual things you tell someone you’re in a relationship with! You never tell me how you’re feeling, or thinking. I know you like me, like spending time with me, but I feel like I don’t know
“Captain, would you mind…?”
“What is it?”
John flushed and shrugged. “I… hoped.”
made forward movement difficult, but he dreaded the alternative of allowing himself to continue to scrape along the ship’s underside. The rope around his ankles seemed a vice, numbing his foot.
Sherlock tackled to the floor of a restaurant. The bomb on the Tube.
Ekene passed next, though he stopped and grasped John’s arm to bring him around so they faced each other.
John nodded. Sherlock leaned heavily back against the wood, gazing over at Sholto and Victor. Now, they were standing, conversing in low tones and tentative smiles, their hands brushing on the railing. Victor watched Sholto, staring as though the latter had hung the moon in the sky.
They gazed at one another, the darkness descending around them as the last blue of the sky faded to black and the shadows crept up the walls.
doing here?” Sherlock snaps, in a tone John hasn’t heard before —
John frowned, so Ekene elaborated. “Captain Holmes never takes to anyone this quickly.”
is that maybe, just maybe,
“I know, I know,” Sherlock rolled his eyes as he stood and made to grab his coat and shoes, trying to hide the twinge of pain and guilt he felt behind the sarcastic tone. “Another thing I haven’t told you about. Come on.”
A small smile fights its way onto Sherlock’s face, as if he is thinking the same thing, and they regard one another in silence for a few moments. Then, however, footsteps break the spell.
“Let’s get some wine,” he suggests before he can second-guess himself too much. “After all, this is a date… boyfriend.”
, learning. And experience at sea was at least as valuable as a university education. “What about food? Has he eaten today?”
“Have you never been here before?”
“John,” Sherlock murmurs. “You sell yourself short.”
“I see.” Sherlock chuckled. “Well, in that case, yes, I am Daddy’s Mushy Valentine.”
It did stop, however, after just a few brilliant moments. John stepped back, though his hands were still gripping Sherlock's. He stared up at him, eyes wide as if he were feeling as surprised as Sherlock. "I..." he stammered, his cheeks reddening. "Wasn't expecting that."
John raised his eyebrows. “Oh.”
“My father always opposed the sale of opium,” he continued. “Despite its continued popularity, he had seen too many good men succumb to its influence, and always asserted its evils to his children.
“Sherlock would let me stay?” he asked.
Despite his usual aversion for human contact, Sherlock found himself rather pleased with that reaction.
John scoffed. “Gathered,” he echoed, mocking. “You plundered us.”
“Hi,” John smiled against his back.
“I’m in,” John said immediately. “Of course I am. I was in even before they destroyed my ship, but now…” He shook his head, and his voice turned into a growl. “I want to take those bastards down.”
“It’s fine, John. Your company has been appreciated these last days, but face it. You do not belong here. You are a member of the Royal Navy and have no business consorting with pirates. Besides, a relationship is perhaps not the best course for me to chart. As a captain. I need to focus on my work.” Sherlock was refusing to look at him, and John thought he knew why; he was attempting to soften the blow this was dealing both of them by saying these things.
John looked to Irene, whose forehead wrinkled. “Did he leave at Jakarta?”
“No, what?” John asked. Moments later, though, his eyes widened in realization. “Oh. Right. Er… consent. Yeah.”
"Yeah?"
“Why?” John found himself asking.
John swallowed hard. “I hope so.”
Sebastian Moran stood silhouetted against the sky, leaning against an air-conditioning unit with his arms crossed. This marked the first time Sherlock had seen him up close - and looking like himself, at least - since the time he’d broken into Sherlock’s flat and attacked him. He looked more haggard, rougher somehow. His dark hair and eyes gave his face an almost shadowed look, which was probably helped along by his fierce glare.
“Well… mostly sure. And it might have been a text.”
The grin that lit up Sherlock’s face, John was sure, would rival the lights on their Christmas tree.
They eat and drink in silence, but after half of John’s tea is gone, the writer shifts closer, placing his hand over Sherlock’s on the sheets. “Listen, Sherlock.” He takes a breath. “I know all this is new to you, and you’ve never been in a situation where you can trust someone else with your feelings.” He pauses, and Sherlock reaches out to touch his bare chest. There’s a bruise-like mark there near his collarbone, and Sherlock blushes to realize
“Right, erm, anyway,” Molly says, “Sorry to burst in…”
Despite the consternation in his gut, John snorts. “I appreciate your faith in me. But this is some stiff competition, whatever you may think.”
“Pirates!” he yelled and whipped his gun out of its holster. “
“You trying to start something?” the man asks sharply.
The man had retired then, but John felt an overwhelming sense of need to see Winter and make sure she was alright before he too bedded down. It had been such a short time since the horrible duel, but he already missed her humming.
But with the dialogue safely back on the specifics of the plot, Sherlock feels the tension within himself again seeping away. John, despite being an at least modestly famous author, is quite easy to converse with. Sherlock discovered that at the book signing, but the revelation still fascinates him. After all, most people are tiresome. And yet here, on the sofa with John’s arm around him, he feels his smiles coming without bidding for the first time in a long time.
“Do you enjoy life here?”
“Still, my reputation made matters difficult for you for a while. I hope you know how grateful I am for your assistance.” His hand brushed across John’s where it lay on the tabletop. “And your friendship.”
Sherlock tilted his head in consideration, but there was no longer guilt present to cloud his countenance. “Well, Mycroft has gathered information not only about the NOTP, but about the EIC, about slave traders. There is plenty of corruption in this world and on these seas, besides Moriarty. And I would like to face them with you.”
They regard one another for another few moments. Then, Sherlock beckons him in. John shrugs off his coat and they sit together on the sofa, a careful two feet between them. The space makes Sherlock ache for John — ache to pull him close and stroke his hair until everything is alright again.
“I’ll do my best,” John says, shuffling his feet. He wishes he could assist her but is painfully aware he hasn’t the foggiest notion where Sherlock keeps his silverware. “I don’t cook much, though.”
Sherlock had closed his eyes while John touched him, but now opened them again. “I got it when the
Moriarty regarded him, brown eyes sparkling with malice. “Well, then.” He slipped his hands into his pockets and shrugged. “I suppose I shall just have to kill you, then. But first I will kill every member of your meddling little crew, and then… I will take a long… long time killing you.”
He began pacing the length of the ship again, exchanging only a few tense words with the man at the helm. Both were hoping against hope that the fog would not intensify.
Sherlock didn't reply for long moments, seemingly lost in thought. At last, he spoke, tone low and contemplative.
Over the next hour, a rather steady trickle of people wanders in, likely coming from the market or a nearby restaurant. He has two hours here for the signing, strategically scheduled to catch the post-lunch crowd, and is glad to see that it is proving to be a wise decision.
He looks ruffled and put out, but still captivating, radiant, amazing.
Sherlock disguised his flinch as he swung on his coat. “Both, I suppose.”
So what, he had thought in his angrier moments the last few hours. So what if those emotions seemed distant and inaccessible?
He did not fail to notice, however, how Sherlock looked up at the last moment, watching John go with a soft, longing expression on his angular face.
He interrupts Sherlock once — to bring him his cup — but otherwise leaves him be. After about an hour, though, John is missing him. That, and he thinks they need to have a discussion.
home, rather than just Sherlock’s.
Afternoon shifted into evening, and the yellow sun shifted to orange, just a finger’s-width above the horizon. But John did not see it as he ate his meal with his crew in the galley. The winds had been strong and favourable; he estimated they would arrive at least a full day early at this rate. At the moment, the winds had died down slightly, but were still steady. All seemed set for a calm, unpredictable night at sea.
John at last staggered out of reach of the two young pirates’ weapons, and he blinked in a futile, frustrating effort to get the fog out of his eyes. As he straightened himself, he managed to look up across the deck. Immediately, something drew his gaze.
He had been under the impression these men had disembarked at Jakarta to find new passages home to England. So why were they here? Moreover, what were they doing with weapons bristling and fists clenched?
He signed in, rolling his eyes at the ridiculous website—which featured a horrible pun on a Roman god’s name in its title—and found his profile. The photo Janine had selected for him was admittedly not a bad one, one she had once snapped of him without him knowing. She had, however, managed to catch him looking not entirely horse-faced and awful. In fact, he looked… alright. On the profile itself, he corrected a few things, including his birth date, which Janine had “helpfully” made five years younger than it truly was. Then, he groaned and began to type in the “About Me” section.
So he nodded. “I think I do,” he whispered.
“You wouldn’t be,” John says, swallowing back his disappointment and nodding. “But okay. Can I see you again soon, though?”
People were moving along its deck, staring toward him. One group, he saw, was lifting a gangplank and moving it into position. Others were armed, the metal of pistols and swords glinting in the moonlight.
John laughs and nods. They both sit down at the cluttered table, and John is just about to tuck in properly when he abruptly remembers the tea.
They chat in the queue, John telling about his evening. Sherlock, in turn, speaks a bit about his work in the lab with Molly, though most of the more technical terms go rocketing right over John’s head.
“I’m here, I’m here, you’re safe.” John kissed Sherlock’s wet curls.
“Where is Victor?” he asked. He wanted someone to provide an additional opinion, someone else who knew all the details of the plan.
He held his breath and began to float, limbs loose and splayed. If he appeared dead, perhaps they would not shoot him…
“Well,” Sherlock says, looking pleased, “I suppose it’s repayment for earlier. If you hadn’t said that thing about Frankenstein…”
"They had you tied up?" Greg exclaimed. "But you were injured! Bloody pirates." He scowled and shook his head, lifting his drink back to his lips.
They both froze, staring at one another. Sherlock didn’t understand.
Sherlock stretched out his legs next to his boyfriend's, and the detective hooked one around John's ankle as he reclined beside John.
“You have changed,” he said with a nod. “You’re... I don’t know, kinder? Softer?”

“Well, it was lovely seeing you, Molly,” Sherlock blurts, his head whipping up to reveal his scarlet face and neck. “See you in lab tomorrow.”

Sherlock smirked and kissed John. “Anywhere. Everywhere. Captain Watson of the

to me.”
Sherlock looked askance. “Please, John, I am attempting to be sincere.”
Sholto held his gaze for a moment, then his shoulders sagged. “Yes.”
“I will work to convince them further, John,” he murmured, a hand on his shoulder. “They will come around.”
It seemed that those who had stayed on the

“Well, I can leave you to it-” John began to say, bending down to retrieve his bag. But Sherlock caught his arm, tugging him back upright.
“Yes, the sixth of January,” Irene nodded. “I keep track of the days just so I can torment Sherlock with it. He doesn’t like to publicize it, but I assumed he told you.”
“Long time, Holmes,” he said. It sounded so casual, as if they were old friends who had bumped into one another on the street.
Energy surged through John again. Was this another foe? But it could not be; the first ship had fled without hesitation. Yet this was not a Royal Navy ship, or any other ship of a nation John recognized.
Sherlock smirks. Fighting back his instinct to hide, he tells John about his infatuations of his youth on various celebrities. John returns with tales of his own crushes, and anecdotes about awful dates he’s been on.
“That’s quite a promise,” John says as they approach. “Sounds good to me. I like a classic British dinner now and again.”
Sherlock felt as if, were he given the opportunity, he would be willing and eager to look at John Watson asleep in his bed for years. His eyes roved over the older boy’s handsome face, from his gold-blond hair sprinkled with honey tones to his oh-so-kissable lips and the light dusting of stubble on his chin.
It seemed Sherlock was actively avoiding John, which almost perplexed him. He knew Sherlock could easily have cornered him somewhere on the ship at any time, and had seemed willing to do so the previous night. But perhaps the pirate captain kept his distance to give John space to calm himself. John was not sure.
At that, Sherlock admitted he wasn’t truly depressed until
He could not understand it. Sherlock had had the chance and worse, the ability to save those men. The
After a few minutes, however, he sighs. He isn’t old — he’s not even thirty yet, dammit eyes — but he has begun to need reading glasses on occasion. He forgets often, though, and catches himself squinting or his eyes aching a bit. So he locates his bag (discarded next to Sherlock’s bed), digs out his glasses, then returns to the sofa.
Sherlock pursed his lips, gaze trained downward. “It also reminds me of my father. He taught me.”
He finally drags himself away and showers, starting to fret again that he hasn’t heard anything from Sherlock. When he emerges, wrapped in his warmest pyjamas, he tentatively steps into the bedroom.
Sherlock nods jerkily. But the motion doesn’t appear to stem from discomfort at being put on the spot, as John might have expected, but from something else less easily identified.
“John!” Sherlock called. John’s head whipped around immediately at the sound of his voice and nodded, holding up a finger to indicate he needed a moment. Sherlock rolled his eyes and went back to examining the port. However, a slight smile played on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, and John found himself grinning. Next to John, Sholto chuckled.
“I... yes,” he replies, a little baffled. Then, he looks her up and down and nods. “Ah, that's why you're here.”
Greg groaned. “But she still will know!”
Marvelous smells waft about —
“It doesn't always work,” she sighed. “Too many uptight boring teachers around here, too busy flipping through the latest academic journal to have any fun. However, some don't mind my... compliments-” Molly rolled her eyes a bit at this, though Janine and Mike smirked. “-and are willing to give me an extension or a few bonus points. But Holmes, well.”
Her former lab partner approached tentatively. “Molly? Do you want a hand with the lab today?”
“My fault. I shouldn’t have let you,” John groaned. “Bloody stupid shoulder.” He forced himself to sit straighter. “I’ll be fine.”
Before he could finish the word, Sherlock had uttered a mock-offended exclamation and thrown a pillow at John’s face. There was a ringing moment of silence, and then Sherlock’s eyes widened as John slowly, deliberately raised the pillow and met his gaze with fierce intent.
Sherlock nodded, and then—with an air of someone acting before he could think better of it—pressed his lips to John’s forehead. The contact lasted mere instants, over almost before John registered it was happening. But when the pirate pulled away the sensation lingered, warm and full of regret.
would have no way of knowing where she was. They would be ignorant of whether she was still following at the same distance, or if she was approaching them.
tentative, unskilled, eager:
Now, on the mostly-empty deck with the sea around him, he could almost pretend he was not on the
So John had launched into action, ordering the sails to be dropped so the
Sherlock’s embrace was warm. “I wouldn’t want you to.”
“To you as well.” Sherlock glowers. This is not at all what he wants to deal with right now.
“Sherlock?” Irene pressed. “We’re going after them, aren’t we?”
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, cradling him, holding him. But it wasn’t close enough, and he squeezed him tighter. “I’ve got you, Sherlock. I’ve got you.”
“Sherlock.”
“A guest,” a voice said. It was high for a man’s, almost lyrical, but undeniably cold.
“Not at all,” the man replies, a smirk on his face. “It was my fault entirely.”
“John—”
The man didn’t reply, just watched again, appraising both John and the work the other pirate had done—the bandage around John’s wound.
Sherlock leans in, and John wraps his arms around him. “I’m sorry for all this. I just… I want this, what we have, to be good.”
Molly giggled. “Really?”
Wiggins nodded, and he dashed off. The other pirates on deck, now that the threat to Winter had been neutralized, seemed frozen with uncertainty. Only Sherlock moved. He slipped his arms under her limp form and lifted her, adjusting so her head was on his shoulder. Whispering soft reassurances to her, he disappeared below-decks once more.
For the moment, though, John contented himself with kissing him. “Come on, you darling, daft thing. Rosie will be awake soon. How about some breakfast?”
John wanted to scowl at him, but the mirth in Sherlock’s eyes was impossible to resist. So he laughed, softly, into the crook of his neck, then moved up to nip at his earlobe. “You’re right, sorry. But if you want me to keep quiet, you’ll have to be less tempting.”
The response arrived within seconds.
BOOM.
They were silent for several minutes while Sherlock ate and drank. But John was thinking. Had Sherlock really put off eating just to ensure that John’s injured men got enough food? His heart seemed eager to pound out of his chest and make a home in Sherlock’s at the thought.
His momentum sent him flying through the air, anchored to the ship by only the thin cord in his hand. He cursed, but swung his legs to try to steer himself.
“Oh! Excuse me.”
They chuckled then fell silent, both listening to the fire and enjoying their respective roles in the stroking of the hair.
John blinked. “No. I thought he was with you.”
It may not be swordfighting or proper medical training, but John supposed it was a good place to start nonetheless.
“I have. The uni’s been great about it. Something about showing they support the arts, or something. Mutually beneficial, though. They get to show they care about more than maths and science, and I get paid for talking to other writers about hypothetical ways to commit crimes.”
The infirmary was brightly lit as John approached. Within, he heard low voices and slowed to listen, not wanting to disturb Winter if she was sleeping.
“Yeah that, where you heat metal and put it on a wound to stop it bleeding. You know?” She seemed, now that John thought about it, a touch woozy. He suspected Sherlock had had to give her some of his awful alcoholic substance before performing the cauterization.
“At the very least, they have some sort of past relationship,” Janine nodded.
“No,” he admits, “but I am a professional developmental and copy editor.”
John blinked. His lips parted, but no sound came out. Sherlock met his gaze, a little confusion seeping into his features. “John?”
After eating as much as they could manage around their emotional turmoil, the two men returned to the deck. A cluster of pirates surrounded Sebastian. All bore weapons and angry expressions, watching him with fierce eyes. Many were silent, but a few whispered about Winter, wondering and speculating and hoping. Without a word to one another, John and Ekene joined them. A man John didn’t even know laid a hand on his arm and nodded. John returned it, marveling at the solidarity he felt for the group in that moment.
, he reminded himself, sobering a bit,
The man giggled, a maniacal, unnerving laugh. The flames were rising higher now, and John sensed rather than saw the pirates and sailors alike abandoning ship.
laid anchor, and most of the crew filed off, faces showing their relief at arriving in one piece Several shook John’s hand or nodded to him; most, it seemed, were aware he would not be returning. Rumours spread quickly on a small ship.
“I have,” Sherlock replied, defensively.
John smiles. “Take as long as you need.”
“Not at all,” Sherlock shrugged. “Merely an offer.”
“We have already established the reasons you cannot go.”
He really had managed to sabotage the cannons.
John grins at that. “For which I’m glad. Otherwise, I might never have met you.” He turns his hand over under Sherlock’s to squeeze it. He has to admit, Sherlock looks rather dashing right now, his hair in disarray, the sleeves of his button-up rolled to just past his elbow. John can’t resist stroking his thumb across the back of Sherlock’s knuckles.
“Sherlock!” Irene screamed again.
“Because I know it’s not what you planned for your life,” Sherlock said hastily, lifting his head to stare at John, eyes wide. “You were a captain in the Royal Navy with your own ship, and now you’re a pirate. And you have to share your leadership, and—”
“I don’t know what to do,” Sherlock finally says.
“Oh, John,” he says, starting to grin, “this is wonderful!” He starts reading the letter over again, aloud now. “‘Dear Mr. Watson, We are pleased to announce that you have been nominated as a finalist for the 30th Annual Ellipsis Literary Award, in the Mystery/Horror category, for your novel
Sherlock has raised his eyebrows. “One of your signings is in bookstore… in
Before he could read the full name, however, Watson sighed and snatched up the phone, silencing it and shoving it into his bag without a second glance.
“But none of those versions of you would be here,” Sherlock whispered. “We’d both be on different paths if you were one of those men. We might still be friends, or we might not. We might not even know each other. I cannot envision any other scenario than the one we’ve lived in which we would both be here, like this.”
“What?” Sherlock shot back. “We have found them. The only way to do this is by sinking the damn thing.”
Sherlock allowed John to steer him inside and up the stairs, not even thinking to enjoy the touch. He followed automatically as John moved them both to the sofa and then slid close and began rubbing Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock frowns a bit. “But wasn’t Frankenstein a student of anatomy and…” His eyes widened, almost comically, then. “And biology! Oh! That’s the link I’ve been missing!”
They smiled at each other for a long moment, and John felt a sudden sense of this being the calm before the storm. What they were about to do, attacking a massive enemy ship in the middle of the ocean with no help and less firepower, was the most dangerous act John had ever taken part in. Yet as he stood here with Sherlock, he saw a future, just for that one instant. If they survived this, they could sail like this, together, for the rest of their lives.
“You okay?” John asks.
Sherlock smirked. “Honestly John, have you no faith in my ability to use chemistry appropriately?”
particular incident. He pressed the button and waited for the website to load.
And without warning, Sherlock is reminded of something he read in one of John’s own books. A quote, spoken by Sherrinford to James Sacker when he’d watched a client hesitate to enter.
He stared out at the city of Lisbon, fists clenched on the railing in front of him. Perhaps he was wrong in his estimation of Sherlock’s character. He had only been on the
As she left the laboratory, she noticed the professor step away from the student and make his way to her former lab partner to examine her work. Molly watched as he began explaining something to her, and was surprised to see the girl's pout fade. She was actually listening. Maybe she would end up having an alright time in this lab after all.
John chuckles, but then sobers. “Still, odd that Moriarty is recruiting authors like that, isn’t it?”
this odd and frankly irritating mess?
At that, a look John could only classify as wonder grew in Sherlock’s eyes. And before either of them could speak again, they were kissing once more.
John looks up and tucks a strand of hair behind Sherlock’s ear. “Yeah, yet. I’m working up to saying it in a minute — you know, spoiler alert.”
At several points, the owner of the restaurant, Angelo, comes to their table and gushes over Sherlock. From what John can glean, Sherlock had once done the jolly man a significant favour, though neither of them say precisely what it was. Still, Angelo shakes John’s hand with great enthusiasm, later bustles over with a cheerfully flickering candle, and then refuses to let either of them pay for the meal.
He nods his assent. John retreats then and finds the nearest lamp. He smiles at Sherlock in the golden light, though both of them blink a bit at the sudden brightness. Sherlock retreats into the adjoining toilet to brush his teeth and stare at himself, incredulous, in the mirror.
And now with Sherlock being in such an odd mood, John is getting

He said it anyway.
“It’s really okay?” he asks.
"John Watson," he beamed. "When I got your letter, I... I couldn't believe-"

Sebastian shrugged. “Just a couple minutes. You were quick. I barely got to admire the scenery.”
“How are you?” a deep voice asked, and John jumped.
added his sexuality in the profile.
The resultant smile on John’s face spurred him forward. He kissed that smile, pressing forward eagerly. John kissed back, cupping Sherlock’s jaw and running his hand down his back.
John meets the Sea Dragon's crew, but can he really allow himself to fraternize with pirates?
Sherlock couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this alone. He was on his side, facing the empty half of the bed, one hand resting on the place John should have been. But John had already left hours ago, rushing off to class and leaving Sherlock alone, without even bothering to wake his boyfriend to tell him goodbye. Instead, Sherlock had awoken some time later to find the bed already cold on that side, and he had been lying there ever since, thinking.
“You are not defective!” John jerks back to clutch at Sherlock’s shoulders, eyes afire. “Don’t you say that.”
He had a feeling if he did not have a goal, something to drive him forward, he would have drowned in guilt and grief by now. So many men, dead under his command. If the Royal Navy found out, he would doubtless lose his title as Captain just as Sholto had. Of course, he mused, he had also allied himself with a pirate, so probably should have lost it years ago.
“Sherlock, he’s a police officer. He can help us.”
So, compelling is certainly not the right word. World-tilting is, perhaps, closer to the mark.
“It’s alright,” Sherlock shook his head. “He’d be pleased I still remember how to play.” His forehead furrowed, thoughtful. “Perhaps I should continue. He’d like that.”
In the cabin, John was pleasantly surprised to see how similar the contents were to Sherlock’s cabin on the
John’s sword felt more familiar now, and he nodded. Yet still, his hand twitched involuntarily. Damn. He took a breath to steady himself, Sherlock's patient expression calming him.
cheekbones.
“I do not believe that,” Mycroft replied. “How was he, last you saw him?”
“What is it?” he asked.
, and this is my idea of how Sherlock (via poetry) reacted to it back then.
Sherlock’s eyes sparkle. “Would you like me to help you move?”
feverish scrawl,
“So you pretended to befriend me,” Sherlock said. He knew he should be fighting, getting off this wretched ship before something worse happened than mere threats, but his mouth seemed to be working of its own accord. He had to spell it out, had to understand everything. He had to know why he had not seen this coming.

has sunk. I saw the wreckage myself. I’m so sorry, but… your brother is dead.”
He soon found an answer as new sounds reached his ears. Another ship, sleek and much smaller than their assailant, appeared in his peripheral vision, and he whirled in the water. It looked less aged than the enemy’s, perhaps the age of the
“If you intend on remaining in his company,” he glares, as if to warn — again — that to do otherwise at this point would be unsafe, “perhaps you could keep me apprised of his wellbeing?”
“Good to meet you, Doctor Hooper.” He eyed the infirmary. Neat, organized, and rather well-stocked. John nodded. “Impressive set-up you have here.”
“Mycroft…” John looked down. “Listen. Your brother saved my life. He could have just as easily thrown me overboard when the

“Sherlock?” A new voice says, drawing his attention. He whips his head around, and his eyes widen.
In other words, this was John’s desk.
wondering if this affection is a dream.
They walked hand-in-hand to the bus, then once they were situated next to one another on an upper deck seat, Sherlock took John's hand again. He saw, to his relief, a small smile on John's face when he did so.
John watched with apprehension. Winter’s opponent was a full head taller and at least two stone heavier; how was she going to survive, let alone win?
She stepped back into the center of the circle and swung her sword to the ready position. Sebastian did the same, a fierce grin on his face. John watched, anxiety pumping through him.
“You have not!” John chuckles. “You don’t know even who the other nominees are, and there’s no way without reading their material to know who is the best writer. Ergo, you are biased.”
“Nor would I trade you, John, for anything.”
He heads off, and Sherlock grapples with a strange combination of anxiety and relief as he watches him go.
Finally, I am SO SORRY this story has taken such a long time. Obviously 2020 and 2021 so far have been… well, a time. But I’ve also been dealing with some mental health issues for months, which have prevented me from being able to create as much as I wanted to. That said, I’ll try not to take so long to finish this fic! I hope you’re all doing okay and know that I appreciate your love for this series so much! (Also, technically in the notes for A Draft Comes In, I did say I wanted to try to get this part posted by July, and… you know, this is a July. XD)
“I'm bi too,” Greg said.
Sherlock struggled against the overwhelming numbers moving to hold him down, but to no avail. The men carried him up the steps to the poop deck and toward the railing. Yet even as he fought, he watched a sudden movement above him. A new set of sails unfurled while the first, the black ones, were pulled up.
John sighed. He stepped over to retrieve the alcohol and a clean cloth. “James, if I had not been civil, or at least not violent, last time I was aboard a pirate ship, I would not be alive today.”
Now, at this closer proximity, other than the obvious benefit of John touching him, Sherlock can also hear Sholto’s voice, tinny through the phone. “...should be a success, since
Fairy lights in the stark white waiting room,
John shrugs. “Well, there’s a spare chair, and I certainly don’t want you anywhere else.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” John says. “I’d say a full time student
“I know. But I felt backed into a corner. I loved my dad.” John sighs. It’s been ages since he last talked about this to anyone. “But the night before I was set to leave for basic training, I backed out. I was terrified, but I hadn’t been able to admit it to myself until that night. I remember standing there, staring at my packed bags, and thinking how much I was dreading leaving.
She raised her eyebrows. “It’s Sherlock’s birthday.”
The name on the screen, from what he could see, started with S, and was several letters long.
“Why did they run?” John asked. “They’d already shown themselves more than capable of destroying a ship. So why flee from you?”
Her hazel eyes darted across the deck. “Over there with Ekene.” She jerked her head to the side, and he followed the movement.
"Of course," Sherlock murmured. He glanced down, then brushed a hand at the stains on his shirt. He seemed unaware of doing so. He made to step away again, but John tugged him back.
“That’s when a publisher charges an author money to be published?”
The door to Watson's office hadn't been closed all the way. She could hear everything.
“It is not that I do not want you here,” Sherlock’s hand flapped. “But your wound is… not good. I have seen that before. A man, years ago, his wound looked like that. He didn’t… well.” he bit his lip. “You have to leave. No arguments. I am… concerned for you.”
“I’m not
The tone — wondering and disbelieving and amazed — nearly breaks John’s heart right then and there.
John bent over him. Their doctor, a man called Hayes, joined him.
"They kept me below-decks," he lied. "I hardly had any contact with them."
“...No.”
The smile on his boyfriend’s lips spread, until it was a grin filled with joy and wonder. Sherlock’s voice shook slightly as he gripped John’s hands harder than ever.
Mr. Holmes — William — steps forward and gives John a warm handshake. He’s Sherlock’s height, wearing a jaunty bowtie and a grin. “The famous John, at last we meet. Do you know, I’ve read all your books.”
“Not particularly. From what I can tell, it’s a load of melodramatic drivel, really.” Sherlock leans back in his chair and crosses his arms. “Why? Is he important?”
This time, the cannonball smashed through their mainmast, which creaked and tilted dangerously. The men who had followed John onto the deck cried out.
“Fine,” he huffed. “You win. Again. Now let me up.”
"We can just have a long engagement until we're both fully ready. Maybe once we both have settled into our careers," Sherlock suggested with a slight eye roll, as if John were a slow child who kept insisting that one and one could not equal two. However, he moved close and laid his hands on John’s shoulders comfortingly. "I... I never thought I'd say this, but... I find myself rather taken with the idea of declaring myself permanently to you." His face turned a positively adorable shade of pinkish-red as he spoke. "Forever with you does not sound impossible.”
Sherlock, however, seems to have wilted in the presence of the other fans. He shrugs the strap of his bag onto his shoulder, then quietly slides his stack of books off the table and into his slender arms. His eyes downcast, he gets up and makes to leave.
, but had begged off early, not wanting to spend another moment reliving their days at sea. Lestrade had bid him goodnight, but a lingering concern was clear in his eyes. Perhaps that concern was warranted, but not for the reasons Lestrade probably thought. No, John was not traumatized by his time with the pirates. Quite the opposite.
swayed, and waves swept up over the deck. John’s feet slid on the soaked wood, and something grazed his arm, sharp enough to draw blood.
The man gave him a mirthless smile. “No one of consequence. Although, I suppose, that depends whom you ask. Take yourself, for instance.”
Sherlock didn’t reply; how could he? Moriarty had deceived him for years, since they were youths. Any denial of that would sound weak and pathetic.
John stared at him, astonished, for several long moments. Then, his face split into the tenderest smile. He reached up and brushed back Sherlock’s curls.
He laboured for a while, measuring and making notations. His navigation abilities were not as refined as their navigator, but he has ensured from months of study that they were well enough should he have to take charge of these matters. The
“I don’t know, can you?” he says, that confidence deciding to manifest, apparently, as playful teasing.
"Sherlock, you're barely seventeen," John fretted, clutching at his hand. "You're so young. I... I shouldn't have kissed you. I mean, n-not that I didn't want to, because I
“Actually," she grinned. “I saw right before I left campus…”
“Sure.”
But then, thoughts began to creep into John’s mind and whisper. He had initiated things with Sherlock last night rather on impulse. Did Sherlock truly desire this? Or was he just bored, seeking a distraction?
“Hello, Watson,” a voice called. He turned and spotted a young woman he knew. She called herself Winter, and she—along with a boy named Bill Wiggins—had tended to his wound in turns. It seemed Sherlock had ordered the two of them to care for John as best they could. John had, in spite of himself, taken to her. She seemed kind and thorough in her efforts to keep the bleeding stemmed, though according to her, she was simply a deckhand and a poor substitute for their late doctor. While she worked on John’s shoulder, she always hummed. Her bright attitude had made the infirmary seem a bit brighter, if only for the short time she was there.
More screams. The
. Good; they appeared to be maintaining their new distance, still mostly out of sight and waiting for Sherlock’s signal. He lifted his eyes to the horizon, where a pale yellow light peered over the faraway line.
After all, he was gambling rather a lot on that assumption.
“Ah,” Moriarty put on an exaggeratedly-impressed expression, brows high and eyes wide. “You’ve figured it out, have you?”
“Yeah.”
John laughs. Sherlock’s apparent tunnel vision in regards to his chemistry tests reminds John of his own tendency to withdraw into a zone where he sees nothing but the document in front of him. “Well,” he looks around the kitchen. “Maybe we should skip kettles entirely, yeah?”
At that moment, his phone buzzes. In spite of all these doubts, his dive for the mobile is frantic and eager. But when he opens the message, his entire body stiffens in shock.
As they sat in silence and watched London go by, John thought back their first fight as a couple, which felt like eons ago now. It had happened a month or so into their relationship, long before they had even broached the subject of moving in together. He could not now recall what they had even argued about, but he knew that fight had also ended in slammed doors and sleeping apart. The next morning, Sherlock had shown up on his doorstep with a single coffee clutched in his hand, a plaintive expression on his face, and a soft apology on his lips. John remembered how Sherlock had tried to say it was okay if they didn’t date anymore, that he had just wanted to say sorry. He remembered how Sherlock had started to leave but how he, John, had grabbed his hand and pulled him inside. He remembered the kisses that had ensued and how when they’d broken apart, Sherlock had looked at him with such relief that John had wanted to bundle him up in an embrace so tight he’d never ever doubt John wanted him. He remembered the affection and protectiveness that had surged within him as he’d held Sherlock close.
John exchanges a look with Sherlock. “It isn’t typical,” he begins. “Do you have the email to show me?”
, John."
Sherlock shrugged. “There’s not much need on the open seas for music.”
"You do know me," he placed his hand on John's bicep and met his gaze. "Better than anyone."
John gazed down at Sherlock, all weak-grip and sleepy-eyes, and smiled.
That didn’t mean they
“Sure, but I bet you’re top of the class,” John risks a wink, and is glad to see the blush make a triumphant return to those—
Sherlock immediately tensed. John seemed to feel it, because he turned to face Sherlock and took his hands.
They stagger to a halt underneath the awning of a bank that’s closed for the evening. John leans against the wall and examines the damage. His chips are just a bit soggy, but the fish seems mostly unharmed. All in all, still edible. And it all still smells delicious.
Sherlock flips the last page of
“John?” Sherlock asked after a few minutes. “What… what does this mean?”
“What is it?”
A moment later, Sherlock slumps against the pillow and drags his fingers through his hair. He can practically hear John telling him to stop “mussing those gorgeous locks,” but he ignores the thought. Because what the hell is he thinking? He is Sherlock Holmes, and although he has promised to open up to John, he cannot pine and moan to himself about
, so many gasps and exclamations in response to his grudging answers, and yet no one truly listened. No one heard him and saw through him to what he really thought of the pirates.
He nods, chest heaving from exertion. John does a terrible job hiding his interest in the way Sherlock’s sodden shirt now clings to his torso.
His cheeks had grown progressively pink as he had spoken, and as he finished he ducked his head. John was unsurprised; Sherlock was by no means an emotionally expressive person. John had been shocked enough by the soft caresses they had been exchanging since awakening. A speech like this, barely solicited as it was, was even more astonishing.
knew about their plan, the better.
and mastermind behind the NOTP. The man Sherlock was going to kill.
He swooped in for a kiss then, one that Sherlock quickly - and unexpectedly - took over without hesitation. John let out a soft moan as he was pressed back into the mound of pillows and had his mouth plundered by Sherlock's enterprising tongue.
“Well, fine,” John smiles, “but we don’t have to decide anything right now.”
“Alright. Goodnight.” He spared a brief glance at Sherlock, then left without another word.
talented!" he scoffs.
Molly glanced at him, seeming rather shy. It appeared neither had expected to be left alone so abruptly.
“Yes, now come here.”
Sherlock had awoken a quarter of an hour before, but had found himself surprisingly unwilling to get up. It was a Saturday, and he had no urgent plans. Instead, he remained next to John, where it was warm and he could be wrapped up in the memories of the previous night without interruption. Their talk about Sebastian, their kisses, and then everything that followed, Sherlock replayed in his mind, vowing to file them in a prominent spot in his mind palace. They deserved preferential treatment.
Sherlock hummed, nuzzling into John’s chest. He looked up, then frowned. “What’s this now?”
Sherlock’s body was ravaged, covered in gashes and bruises and blood. He was still soaked, though the heat from the fire had caused steam to curl from his tattered clothing. There were burns tracing along his arm, where the flames had crept too close for comfort. His shoulder looked injured as well, sitting not quite right in its place, and his left ankle was misaligned as well.
“So why did you stop?” A hint of a petulant whine creeped into Sherlock’s voice and made John grin.
He moved closer, lowering his weapon to his side, then trailed a finger along Sherlock’s jaw. “I shall have to pat myself on the back.”
“Good,” he muttered, nosing at the crook of John’s neck.
“Dammit,” he growls. He knows, as is the burden of genius, what he should do, but he feels a jolt of nerves as he considers it. “John, what have you done to me?”
"John," Sherlock huffed, relieved. "I did not have to allow you to kiss me. We have both seen that I am perfectly capable of stopping people from touching me if I wish to. And I am capable of giving consent, which I have never considered
“I… I know you carry notebooks, but you do most of your actual writing on the computer,” Sherlock rushes through his explanation, fiddling with a bit of discarded ribbon. “And I thought, if you got on a roll — not that you can type very fast—” he rolls his eyes, “but it’s… you know, another option. And you can get to the internet of course—”
“Hmm,” Sherlock frowned as if considering what to do, even as he rose from his chair and made his way toward the bed. “Well, I shall have to do something to make it up to you, won’t I?”
Sherlock sat propped up against the headboard with his arms wrapped around his legs, which were pressed to his chest. He stared straight ahead at the dim room, unseeing. Next to him, John slumbered peacefully.
“Since we’ve a few minutes until the ceremony starts, can I ask about your new book? Sherlock won’t tell me anything.”
Besides, he had a feeling if he simply ignored this issue, Janine would never let it go. Well, since he appeared to be in this, at least for the time being, he was
“Your actual-”
Sherlock’s face lights up.
“I don’t know,” John teases. “Why don’t you find out?”
Sherlock shifted. “They do when there is a much bigger scheme at work.”
The pirate’s jaw worked as he fought some internal battle with himself, then he sighed. “Just a day. The storm actually blew us to a favourable location. According to Ekene, and the stars confirm his estimation, we ended up farther northeast along the coast than I suspected. If it were a clear enough day, I think we could almost see Gibraltar.”
“You lost in a fair match, then challenged and goaded your opponent until she agreed to another,” Sherlock whispered. “During your second, unneeded match, you then violated the rules of combat. You deliberately inflicted serious injury on a fellow crew member. What have you to say for yourself?”
Because Sherlock was incredible. His mind, the things he did and thought, were extraordinary. He felt so deeply, John had realized early on. He pretended not to care about people, about normal societal expectations and behaviors, but only because he cared
Moriarty grinned, the light and shadows on his face giving him a rather haunted, gaunt, sickly look. “Bravo, darling! You’re right, of course. I took up the mantle of head of the NOTP, and got this pretty ship to boot.” He spread his free arm out wide. “You assumed something terrible had happened to me, and isn’t that just so adorable?
“And you could smell it on him?” John asks in wonder. God, he has known Sherlock is intelligent, but these powers of observation…
“Identify yourselves,” a man said. He did not appear to be armed, but John was sure he had a concealed weapon somewhere. It would be foolhardy not to.
“I’m amenable to
Yes, five minutes at the most.
He nods toward the stairs behind them, an unsure yet hopeful gesture. John kisses him again, lingering and gentle yet also clear in his wanting. “Oh God, yes.”
You are braver, by far, than I
Last week, John had forgotten a date he and Sherlock had planned weeks before. He still hadn’t remembered.
Sherlock was quiet a moment. Dimly, John could feel his hand on his own. “He will. He’s a fighter.”
“John, as you’ve already mentioned, I’m a chemistry student. Do you really think I care about
He waited, staring unblinkingly at his phone, until the reply came. When it did, he sucked in a breath, fear lancing through him like ice.
“Finally noticed I’m still here, did you?”
Surely he would conclude that the past month had made irreparable damage to their relationship. Surely he would decide Sherlock was not worth the effort. Surely he would leave.
“You couldn’t have,” Sherlock shrugs. He sets the mugs and kettle aside, frowning. “Though now I think about it, it might have been that kettle,” he nods at an older, copper kettle sitting — for some reason — on the bookcase in the sitting room.
He knocked Sholto to the ground, John’s sword an inch from his neck.
Slowly, Sherlock turns the spine of the first book to face him.
Sherlock takes an age finding the right response. He stares into his own lap, where his hands clasp together in a viselike grip.
anyone.
Yes, this is far better than the science books.
He turned from the radio and gave the room one last sweeping glance as the knob turned. He smiled with satisfaction to himself. Everything looked perfect. Now he just had to hope everything went to plan.
“But I wasn’t a published author at age, what was it, twenty?”
“Who says it isn't canon?” John says. “I'm not one to tell you that what you read in between the lines of a text is wrong. Besides, romance may not be the central theme of my books, but I think if he's anything, he's probably bi. Which is probably because aspects of my own self have seeped into the characters.”
The inside of a doctor’s office, the kind that had a few desks crammed inside one room for interns’ use. Sherlock recognized a picture on the tiny desk nearest the camera. Himself, laughing up at someone. It had been taken almost a year ago on the Southbank, when he and John had spent a day wandering along the Thames stealing kisses between mouthfuls of street-vendor cinnamon peanuts.
Holmes called the class to order and explained the procedure. He pulled up a document on the board to further detail the assay.
“It’s fine,” he repeated to the captain, who only lifted a sardonic eyebrow.
John turned to him. “Where did you find her?” he asked.
He crawled onto the bed and into John’s lap. “My hero,” he murmured, smiling.
Yet it shifts and changes and thrills
Sherlock snickered, then kissed John in response. He moved with eager confidence again, the acute focus he so often trained upon his work now turned directly onto John.
“Just because we don’t need it doesn’t mean we don’t want it,” Sherlock said, seeming to surprise them both.
By Sherlock Holmes, age 24.
John’s face heats. “I want to know what my readers are thinking,” he mumbles.
John processes that, hating that Sherlock has never been treated as he deserves. However, his sympathy does not entirely negate his frustration with the man.
, part 6 of How Novel.
“Watson!” a voice screamed, and a hand seized his arm. John whirled to find Victor Trevor’s wide eyes inches from his face.
“Perhaps I am, Captain Watson,” Sherlock teased, and John shivered in anticipation at the implication.
the roof. Hoping to make Sherlock feel less alone, John told him of his own problems, his fears that he would succumb to the darkness he knew lurked inside him.
John rather wants to hit him. How dare he? He doesn’t even know John. How dare he imply that John, so enchanted and fascinated with Sherlock Holmes, will not do his utmost to stay, to ensure the fragile heart Sherlock tries to hide is taken care of?
Sebastian, for finding him again and filling his life with paranoia and uncertainty?
He barely got his hands behind his neck and his head bent down in time. His back collided with the ship once more, and he grimaced as the water flowed around him. He drifted a few feet from the vessel and exhaled in relief for the momentary reprieve. More lacerations had opened up on his body, and the waves around were a frothy pink from his blood. He could not survive this much longer.
John shook his head, smiling, and kissed his lover again. Sherlock tasted of the sea, and the sweet fruits that they had taken on board two days previous. He wished they did not have to keep an eye on the wheel, because John would much rather devote all their attention to each other. He would rather pull Sherlock close and allow the pirate captain’s arms to wrap around him until that was all he could feel.
When Sherlock moved to stand again, perhaps to climb into bed properly, John’s confusion and concern doubled. For Sherlock gave a soft gasp and collapsed.
“Oh, that’s alright,” John flashes him that damn smile again. “You’re the guest, sit down.”
“I have a few contacts in the homeless population of the area. I can ask them to track him down, subtly.”
At the end of the port, moving away from them, sailed the
When the morning arrived, John didn’t want to open his eyes. This bed was too comfortable, too warm, too full of Sherlock. Why would he ever want to move?
Sherlock freezes in place. His heart plummets into his stomach, and he swallows hard. This is it—he's lost his chance, he let himself get distracted by books too long. And now John will let this man flirt with him, and take
He scrambles up and departs, leaving a bemused John behind. Sherlock sets off down the street, his reflection on the café windows a rippling silhouette from the light rain that’s still falling.
John pulled his pirate close, spinning him around, feeling the man’s laughter against his own chest.
John and Sherlock, though, did not move. Their eyes found one another again. All at once John found himself at a loss for words. What was he supposed to say to a man he had parted on tense terms with, then thought dead for years? Sherlock seemed similarly uncertain. Meanwhile, Victor surveyed them, brown eyes sharp and observant. And with a quick touch on Sherlock’s arm, he excused himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So John — and I’m sorry if I’m prying too much — but I was wondering if you two have thought about just giving in already?”
“That’s a start,” John laughed, before he reached up and pulled Sherlock into a deep kiss.
John turned to face Sherlock. “I hope this is alright.”
That is, if I am here when morning comes
But doubt has abruptly seeped in again, and Sherlock suddenly wonders. Is this really how dates usually go? Surely John is expecting something… more. “You probably didn’t expect me to come simply to talk about your books.” He ducks his head. “I suspect you grow weary of discussing them with fans.”
“Maddox,” John nodded. “What is it?” Then, he did a double take. “Wait. What are you all-?”
“Why?”
“What?” John asks.
More than anything, John wished he could go to Sherlock and apologize for the last words he had spoken to him. For the hurt he had likely caused.
John clenched his jaw. “Of course not.”
With a word of thanks, he took the water from Molly and set to daubing Sherlock’s forehead with it. The swoon had drained his face of the slight color he had… well, worked up, and he now looked deathly white in the dim light. Were he not stirring, more strongly now, he could have been a corpse.
That night, after Rosie fell asleep halfway through
At least six crew members flew back into action, holding down the man or retrieving ropes. They yanked him to his feet and forced him to the mast, where they tied him down.
“But they should! Classic poems rhyme! My writing students do it all the time. You should try it!”
“I… I am about to graduate with a chemistry degree, but I don’t want to be a scientist. Not really. I’m not the kind of person who wants to work for the government, like my idiot brother. And working for a university doesn’t appeal to me either. Students and grading and all. No offense to your creative writing workshops.”
“Yes,” John smiled back.
He shook off his sentimental thoughts as he hurried down the stairs into the Tube station. Lestrade waited, just on the other side of the turnstiles.
, okay?”
Nor had talking with Lestrade helped matters, unfortunately. He had felt his hackles rising while he explained to the DI what was going on. Sherlock hadn’t spoken up, which was something John had not failed to notice. Then, when Lestrade had responded to the situation with so much concern, John had had to get out of there.
Without warning, Sebastian spat in Sherlock's face. The captain leaned back, an eyebrow lifting. Several of the crew started forward, letting out loud protests, but he held up a restraining hand.
Do I care to find out which?
"What, kissed? I'll say," John beamed at him, and they both giggled.
John slipped back to the main deck and rounded up his men. Most of them, save Sholto, had made no effort to befriend the pirates, merely treating them with distant wariness. They spent most of their time, even during meals, up on deck amongst themselves. The pirates in turn had left them alone.
“Is this the part where you threaten to have me offed if I hurt your brother?” John asks with a feeble laugh.
“And Singapore?”
“Then why?” Sherlock tilted his head, and John was absurdly reminded of an inquisitive puppy. This time, unable to stop himself, he kissed Sherlock’s forehead.
“Yeah. I'm not exactly in the closet or anything — my parents know and they're okay with it — but I don't want a big deal made of it, you know?”
“What the hell…?” he mutters, swinging his legs out of bed, seizing his dressing gown, and storming toward the window. Cautiously, he peers out, and is startled when he catches sight of a head of curls outside.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is it?”
“I believe, I
By Sherlock Holmes, age 25, March.
“John, I… ah, feel I should apologize. I shouldn’t have spoken that way to your editor.”
“Ekene!” Sherlock bellowed. “Someone find me Ekene!”
John stiffened. “What?”
Yes, keeping Sherlock feeling this way sounds like a worthwhile goal indeed.
So John rolls up his sleeves and gets to work.
Fighting broke out all across the deck, and John was buffeted to the side. His hip slammed into the railing, and he crumpled once again. As he gripped the wood to steady himself, he caught sight of someone he never thought he would see again.
“Better?” John asked, amused, after Sherlock finished the scone in three bites. He nodded back, and felt a leap of pleasure in his gut when John pecked his cheek. He then picked up the cup of coffee and moved the tray to the bedside table. John moved closer, hesitantly, but beamed when Sherlock gestured his permission.
Sherlock’s face warms. “I did, but… I hoped you’d forget you asked me to write it.”
“Yeah,” John interlocked their fingers. He leaned down and kissed Sherlock’s palm, just a soft brush of his lips against his skin.
“Here,” Sherlock pointed to a strange contraption made of metal, wood, and other bits John could not identify. “Once I get it working, it will be brilliant.”
“I was there,” John said. “Or at least, nearby. It's how I found out. I saw the wreckage while on holiday.”
“Why are you and Sherlock avoiding one another like the plague?” she had asked without preamble.
He had not even killed Sebastian, when such an act would not have been unexpected, or indeed even unheard of at sea.
The group finishes work-shopping Kitty’s story, then at the top of the hour, breaks up. Adelbert is first out the door, looking quite put out. Most of the other students take their time packing up, bidding farewell to both John and Sherlock, who attends these classes more often than not these days, now that he himself is finished with school.
“Captain Watson saved my life,” Victor said, gesturing to John.
“Yes. Would you like to hear?” Sherlock’s mouth twisted into a smile.
“Our father never told us,” Sherlock shrugged. “We were young, too young to be involved in the situation. His protectiveness, though perhaps prudent at the time, has set quite the obstacle for our work.”
“Mmm,” John repeated once they broke apart. “This is going to be really cheesy, but I like waking up next to you.”
“You're sure?!” She heard rustling in the background and imagined him sitting up on his bed. “It wasn't a burn or something? I mean, he
John did not reply. “I said, is that clear?”
“And I you, John.”
Sholto hissed in a breath and bared his teeth. “Damn!”
’s crew. Thus, you became another target. As was Victor, as they had found out he was quite interested in their operations. It would not surprise me if they had a spy of their own on your old ship, Victor.”
“Sherlock, breathe,” his boyfriend was saying, hands wrapped around Sherlock’s upper arms to steady him. “Just breathe, he’s gone. Come on, let’s get you inside.”
John looked unimpressed. “Yeah, I really am. I’ve called in today and everything.”
Instantly, John’s posture straightened. “What else? Do you feel unsteady at all? Is your vision clear?” James’ arm did feel a bit clammy, now that John noticed. His time working with the ship doctor, soaking in as much information as he could in case of an emergency when the doctor himself was absent, flooded back. “James?”
Sherlock felt a shiver track up his spine. Those words, both said and unsaid, kept reverberating in his mind. John’s voice, full of desperation and worry and concern and affection, made him want to turn back. He nearly wanted to abandon this quest, and just let himself be held by the one man who had looked at Sherlock and seen someone extraordinary.
The rope was still tied around his ankles. And this time, he was sure, they would not pull him out of the water until he was dead.
“Why would he do that?” Her brow scrunched up, her mouth twisting in a moue of concern. “You don’t think they had a fight, do you?”
“You need a break, my love,” he murmured, pressing a kiss to the messy curls.
But John Watson loved every second of it.
. Yet he also wants to condemn Mycroft for his meddling, and so he chooses that course instead.
“I did alright when you attacked my ship,” John snapped.
What was going on?
The conversation quickly devolved into the blurting of theories that only grew more absurd as time passed. (Perhaps the end of term stress and workloads were getting to them all, not just Greg.)
He looked like a cat, John thought as he took off his shoes and closed the door. Like a sleepy house cat who had run itself ragged chasing mice and scratching chair legs and had finally found a safe, warm corner to curl up in.
. The skull had indeed made it onto the
Yet as he turned to gaze out the window, thoughts of how much he missed John still tugged at his consciousness, and everything suddenly felt colder than it had before.
Sherlock chuckles and rolls his eyes, but then starts to shuffle his papers a bit, giving John some space on the table.
But at this point, John couldn’t care less about where this was happening.
had stayed behind to work the cannons, while the pirates had gone on the attack.
“Well…” Sherlock replies, with more reticence than he’d like. “Did… did you hear much of that?”
“Quiet,” John protested. “I’m your captain, after all.”
“What— what’s got into you?” John asks, breathless, after a while. He looks down at Sherlock, who is grinning.
“John Watson,” Molly replied, eagerness saturating her bubbly tone. “You know him, right?”
And so on. Sherlock didn’t dare delete them, in case he needed them - they were evidence, after all, and he was a detective - but he also now worried that John would notice them if he ever used Sherlock’s phone.
“Since when does a pirate… well, care?”
“Irene,” John grinned. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
taking aboard a shipment of weapons they were not supposed to have. Thus, Sholto and his crew had to be eliminated. The
“What happened, Victor?” John asked. “How did you fall overboard?”
He lifted his eyes and met John’s as he said the last words.
“You still hesitate,” Mycroft smirked. “You’re very loyal, very quickly.”
He glided down, gaining speed with every second, wind rushing past his ears. The cloth he had wrapped around his palms before leaping off protected his hands, but he could still feel the heat that rose from the rope as he slid. He whooped, and the crew members who were on deck looked up and cheered.
“The NOTP,” Sherlock breathed. He did not continue, but John believed him anyway.
“What, that there could be an entire town run by women in the 1600s?” Kitty snaps. “Unrealistic to you, maybe. Have you ever had a girlfriend who could be described as anything other than imaginary?”
BOOM.
Meanwhile, John’s schedule was becoming increasingly tight. He had several exams coming up, major ones, and it seemed he was spending more and more time holed up in various study spots and less and less time with Sherlock. The detective didn’t mind, not really. He understood how much this meant to John. Becoming a doctor was his dream; Sherlock was not going to stand in the way of that. He only wished John would notice him, would at least study at home on occasion.
“Don’t like them?” John has to bite back a laugh.
John laughs and opens his mouth to reply when Mycroft interrupts. “Oh, please,” he groans. “Can we perhaps start your book club later? This is going to be tedious enough as it is.”
He didn't yet know about the lost, dirty, tired Irish Setter puppy who would find her way into a nearby alley, how Sherlock would drop to his knees upon seeing her and stay with her for hours until she felt safe enough to approach him, and how she would insinuate her way into their hearts and their home and never let them go.
“Where are we? How far from Lisbon?” John did not want to hear any defense Sherlock had spun.
“Sherlock!” Irene screamed. Breathless, John stood and looked around. She knelt, Winter’s head in her lap, and was stroking her hair. The red-haired woman had a cloth pressed to the bloody wound in the girl’s side.
“Mostly the sea, and you,” Sherlock said, though his voice was muffled in the crook of John’s neck. “I don’t mind.”
“Let’s get him below,” Hayes suggested. Together with Sholto, he and John carried him below-decks and laid him in the infirmary. Hayes examined him, John watching with worry and confusion.
In response to Sherlock’s enthusiasm, John seems to be emerging from the stunned state the phone calls have left him in. His lips tug upwards. “Yeah, yeah… I am. I just… can’t quite believe it. I thought I’d just be a minor author of middling fame at best. This is… a lot all at once.”
They remain curled up together for several minutes, the silence in between them comfortable. However, as the minute hand on the mantel clock inches closer to midnight, John sits up. He drags Sherlock up with him and turns him so they face each other. Sherlock feels a thrill of anticipation in spite of himself; he has never had a New Year’s kiss before. John keeps an eye on the clock as it ticks away the last minute of the year. He reaches out and takes Sherlock’s face in his hands.
“How is the shoulder, sailor?” he asked, the smallest of smirks tugging at his lip.
“Wait, was that answer to the first question or the second?” John looked up at him with worry, though hints of amusement were beginning to infect his expression.
Lestrade nodded. "Back to your posts. If we find that you need to know anything about the ship, Lieutenant Watson or I will let you know. Now back to work! Ready us for a storm! You know your jobs!"
He handed John a ration of salted beef and bread. “Winter is doing well. She was awake and asked if she could go back to work already.” He shook his head.
Satisfied (at least for now), he strides down the aisles, emerging into an open space dotted with tables and sofas. Only a few students are here, it being afternoon on Friday. Which is exactly why John has chosen to come here now, so he can spread out his things on a large table and not disturb anyone, or be bothered by babbling study groups.
John swept his hair off his forehead and lifted his gaze to the helm. Sherlock sat there, a rather exasperated smile on his face.
The members of the Royal Navy, as well as privateers and every other group of sailors John had ever encountered, were notorious for their superstitious beliefs. Chief among them was the one about women bringing ill fortune at sea. Sherlock Holmes, it seemed, did not hold to those beliefs. Women were as numerous on desk as men, going about their work with casual ease. Some wore their hair loose, others tied back in loose buns. But what really made John’s eyes widen was the attire most of them wore.
Sherlock scans the notes. Much of it is written in some sort of shorthand/abbreviation system, much in fragmented phrases and somewhat nonsensical sentences. He does see a few character names, details, and a timeline marked up with arrows. However, most of it seems to be very much still in the formative stages, judging from the sheer number of question marks and crossings-out.
had seemed to come out of nowhere, but that was only an illusion. Somehow, the crew—or perhaps, Sherlock suspected, wonderful, brilliant John—had angled their travel path so they moved in on the
“I’ll be quiet, then,” John smiles, amused. He opens one of his books, and starts flicking through it. After a while, his notebook, tablet, and several pens join the mess on the table.
John glanced at Irene, slightly skeptical. What honourable reason would there be for piracy? But she appeared to agree with Ekene if her emphatic nod was any indication.
John chuckled, lifting his hands to rest upon Sherlock’s shoulders. “Thank you.”
Sherlock fixes him with a stare that would have made anyone unused to him cower. “Why else do you think he was so short with me? And his body language when he interacted with you… Well, it was an elementary deduction, really.”
Sherlock reached his hand out, and John stood straight, moving close. The pirate captain’s arm looped around his waist, and his head pressed against John’s chest. “So you really should not be swinging from ropes like a madman.”
as the pen dances across the page:
“Nothing, never mind,” Sherlock says. He shifts the conversation back to Sherrinford, and the logistics of how he survived that waterfall. John allows the change, but seems to be watching Sherlock with a more thoughtful expression now.
“I cauterized it,” he said softly. John noticed he was still holding Winter’s hand.
“Are you sure?” Sebastian lifts an eyebrow. “If even you—”
That still did not exonerate him of his own crimes, though, John reminded himself. He still attacked innocent ships, still sailed without allegiance to any country, still defied every law John had been bound to all his life.
"This is..." he paused to take a sip. "Fantastic."
“You’re one to talk,” Sherlock interrupts. His voice sounds as if he’s trying to be venomous, but it only comes out tired. “You were already published and well on your way to being extremely successful by the time you graduated. And now, you’re getting the recognition and accolades you deserve—”
Sherlock stared at his screen, dumbfounded. How on earth had John interpreted his terse profile, his condescension toward the very website that had introduced them, and his admittedly rather lackluster conversation skills as… charming?
A fairly steady stream of people comes to see John, though Sherlock finds himself grateful for the quieter moments, which is when John turns to him and murmurs things like, “I missed you,” or “I can’t believe you’re here,” or “thanks for surprising me.”
By Sherlock Holmes, age 24, November.
He sighed and turned to his first mate. “James, they saved our lives. And Miss Hooper is trying to help you.”
Evening light spread across London. John strode down a street, though he was unsure where he was. He had spent another meal with the crew of the
“Of course.”
Trying not to think about it any longer, he skims his work before realizing that it’s been several minutes since he has last heard Sherlock writing anything down. He looks up to find his boyfriend leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed. When John meets his gaze, he grins.
Then, as if realizing how much he has revealed with those few words, he looks back down at his lap and wrings his hands. John smiles, feeling absurdly fond of this man already.
John scoffs, frustrated. He hates that he’s getting angry, but Sherlock isn’t giving him a chance to feel anything else. “That’s only a valid excuse for so long, Sherlock. I’m just asking you to try to let me in! Just a bit! It’s not that hard!”
“No, John, I mean… you’re a conductor of light,” Sherlock concludes, his tone earnest.
Apparently, contrary to John’s belief, Sherlock
As if the universe had heard Sherlock speak, a great creak rent the air. The Dutch ship was near enough that John heard her crew cry out as one. She had smashed into a reef, a fatal blow from the looks of it. Seconds later, the mainmast splintered and tumbled into the waves. The ship pitched to the side, then began unmistakably to sink.
And he buried his face in the pillow and let himself softly sob.
“Just one day, you’ll have to allow it,” John laughs, then gives him a quick kiss.
Back in the present, Sherlock sighed and settled back farther into the cab’s seat cushion, crossing his arms. As he did so, his arm pressed against his phone, tucked into an inside pocket of his coat. Sebastian had only sent him one text so far, just a vague reference to how much he’d thought about Sherlock in the last twelve hours or so. Sherlock supposed it was a mark of how strange his life had become lately that this did not concern him much. At least Sebastian did not seem to be trying to actually
Amber looks surprised but bites down on a guiltily amused smile and retreats; the man turns an even deeper shade of red as he chuckles at his shoes.
“You sunk them?”
“Well, come on then,” John tugged him forward. “Dance with me, Captain Holmes.”
We find connection between each other’s fingers
Sherlock’s countenance had become serious, almost stern and urgent. “I shall. Have you heard anything of a specific pirate gentleman, by the name of Victor Trevor, within the last few months?”
Now, he danced with that man who was the same but so different. And now, that man was his husband.
Smiling at the easy camaraderie and confidence in their relationship they have developed, John turns back to his work. He’s hit a spot of writer’s block, and decided this morning to set aside the actual draft, and instead shift to finishing the outline for the third act of his story. He’s doing this by hand, because at this point, anything to get his creative juices flowing once more is welcome.
“I don’t need anything else.”
He took a moment to scan the deck. The only men left on board now were prone, bleeding. John felt his heart crack at the sight.
Their journey upstairs is giggly and full of fond caresses and quick kisses. John, were he not dazed from strong wine and delicious food and heady snogs, might have looked around at his surroundings. However, he
Desiring to refresh his memory of the place, John pulled open the desk drawer to retrieve his private log. He flicked through the notes and stories he had jotted down over the past two years, then jumped as a slip of paper fluttered out of the pages onto the floor. Curious, he picked it up.
“That’s because they don’t make this version.” John reaches out to pick up
“Just fine, Miss Hooper, thank you,” he smiled, a movement that caused crinkles to appear at the corners of his eyes. He turned to his bag and began rummaging through it. “Now, I know it's the first day back, but there's still plenty of the Opium Wars to cover before our quiz next week. So, let's open to page 317…”
from the east. They used the rising sun, just on the horizon line at the moment, to their advantage. Thus, they were able to surprise the NOTP flagship by coming directly out of the bright light.
“A bit.” Sherlock finished the biscuit and began on the salted pork. “I’m sorry. What you were doing before this… with the kissing and all… that was… good.”
“Okay, but the really intriguing question isn’t what Holmes did to make Watson so upset,” Janine cut in. “It’s why the actual hell Holmes has lockpicks.”
Relief flooded through John, a balm and a shot of adrenaline all at once. “Yes,” he breathed, grasping at Sherlock’s hand. “Yes, of course. And I agree with you, there’s a lot to unpack together. And separately too. We can just… have fun, with this part of it, if you want.” He gestured between them, and Sherlock nodded even as he lifted an eyebrow at the mess on his stomach.
Sherlock nodded as he nestled the instrument back in its case. “As I said, it’s been ages since I’ve done so. Did… did you enjoy it?”
Now John was blushing too through his smile. “Look, I just… I’ve been thinking about this for, like, months. I like the idea, more than like it, and I thought... this might be a good time, but… now that the moment’s here… I’m kind of panicking. And apparently repeating my own arguments. Please stop me.”
The two sides crashed together in a cacophonous roar. John was almost immediately overwhelmed by the noise, the blurring forms of men fighting, the total chaos. The pirates were relentless, and at first, John couldn’t see any organization whatsoever. Royal Navy sailors were trained to move in disciplined, refined movements together, but these fighters did not. However, after a few moments of combat, John realized the pirates did have a technique, a system. Instead of moving as one predictable mass, they picked individual targets, whom they attacked. Then, they switched. By changing which opponent they were fighting every few blows, they instilled confusion and panic in the Navy crew. It was an effective, methodical, and ruthless means of attack. And it enabled them, in sequence, to get past the soldiers and dash below-decks.
“Thank you,” John added. “For saving my life. You didn’t have to.”
John rose to his feet again, firing back at the other ship. He scanned its decks, seeking a captain, a lieutenant, or anyone who looked to be in charge. But the
"I'm fine," he bluffed.
“I’m not that unobservant,” John chuckles, flipping his notebook shut.
It’s the scene where Sherrinford Scott meets James Sacker, he realizes. James, the character most of the fans tend to overlook in favor of fawning over Sherrinford, is the assistant to Sherrinford and often the one who gets into trouble thanks to his difficult friend. He had not appeared in the first book, which had narrated Sherrinford’s origin story, his discovery of his passion for crime-solving, and his struggle with controlling his emotions as he attempts to solve several horrible connected crimes. The second book, however, had seen James insinuate himself into both Sherrinford’s and John’s lives. John had nearly panicked, not knowing what to do with him, when he’d shown up as a witness to Sherrinford’s new case, seemingly fighting his way out of John’s pen of his own free will. But after just a chapter, John had fallen under the spell of the sarcastic but loyal man. And he had stayed with Sherrinford—and John—ever since.
Sherlock glanced at him, then went back to work. “Get out of the way.”
off guard before the full crew was awake, and for sinking them as quickly as possible. The strategy was vague and simple, which Irene seemed to like. However…
John laughs. “Oh, of course. I should have known this was your plan all along — you go to my signing, seduce me, and get your hands on the next book before anyone else.”
Sherlock leaned forward, his greater height apparent even with both of them sitting. Perhaps it was just his presence that made him seem to loom. His eyes were dark, and hard. “Victor Trevor. Have you heard?”
Chemistry is so much more clear cut, he thinks.
“That was nice, what you said to her,” he says.
“Goodnight.”
“You need a doctor,” the captain said without preamble the moment John was within earshot. He had barely taken a glance at John’s shoulder, but John could not deny the accuracy of his statement. Still, he was irritated that Sherlock was making decisions without consulting John first. Especially when those decisions were
finding the same fate, though he could imagine the vindictive laughter of the men he sat with now as they watched the ship sink.
