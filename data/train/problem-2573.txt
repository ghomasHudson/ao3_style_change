before you speak?’
Sherlock ruffled his curls. ‘My God, this is atrocious.’ He took a deep breath. ‘Sorry. Continuing. We have the same friends-‘
John nodded. ‘Yes.’
me, John.’
I've really looked forward to writing this chapter and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! :)
your child is born.’)
‘To the public, she is referred to as the King mother, Charlotte Elizabeth Margaret,' Sherlock said dramatically. 'To my father, Uncles and Aunt, she's Mummy. To my siblings and cousins, she’s Granny. To me, she's Charlie.'
Irene is always there.
And Sherlock leant forwards and took the whole of John’s cock in his mouth.
‘You can have me again, Irene,’ Charlotte whispered. Molly, standing next to Sherlock, had clenched her fists. ‘What do you say-‘
Sherlock stepped up to the microphone. He was wearing a suit, which showed just how broken-down he was: someone would have made him wear it and he hadn't protested because he just couldn't do it anymore, and John's arms subconsciously reached out to hold him, to take care of him, to pull him close and whisper everything was going to be alright-
“Sherlock isn’t… I mean, he’s not…” John stuttered, wanting to defend his friend but unsure of how to do so.
Sherlock had deduced that the professor was a werewolf the very first time he’d walked into this classroom. It was quite obvious, and he was convinced that his peers must have been completely daft if they didn’t recognize the professor’s condition. Of course, Sherlock didn’t care one way or the other if the professor was a werewolf or a vampire or even half-giant like Hagrid. The man was a decent teacher and quite kind to Sherlock, so he found himself somewhat fond of the professor, though he’d never admit that to anyone.
As the professor walked away, John stared down at his shiny, metallic matchstick. It was just like him. Being made of metal made it strong like a Gryffindor.  A matchstick had logical use like a Ravenclaw. But altogether a metallic matchstick was as useless as a Hufflepuff. Irritably, he brushed it onto the floor and gathered his books, exiting the room before all of his classmates as soon as the professor dismissed them.
“Would you mind watching for a bit to make sure that I don’t do anything wrong?” Janine insisted, and then, from the opposite side of the room, another voice spoke up:
“Alright, fine. But you’ve got to tell me everything when you get back to the common room.” Irene wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. She had always been like this, even back when they were first years. While it had taken Sherlock a little longer than average—and a hot ex-Auror turned Defense Against the Dark Arts professor—to understand the concept of sexuality, Irene had been an early bloomer. Even then, they had somehow been drawn together from the start. Best friends since day one—not that Irene had given Sherlock much say in the matter.
a genius. And people are simple. But people don’t like being shown how simple they are. So they hate me.”
“That was absolutely incredible. Did you really figure all of that out yourself?”
“Because… Because it’s not decent. It’s rude to not help somebody when you can.”
“It appears so, Miss Hawkins,” the professor answered, his tone somewhat bored. It seemed that he was just as unsurprised as John was that her potion was perfect. After all, she was the best in their class, much to John’s agitation. It probably wouldn’t have bothered John as much if she would just own up to being the best, but instead she used it as an excuse to come on to Professor Holmes, acting all modest while simultaneously impressing him with her skill. If the professor were a normal man, her attempts at seducing him might have actually worked. But from what John had observed in the two years that the man had been the potions master here at Hogwarts, the professor wasn’t and would never be attracted to anybody, much less a student.
detention. I was just… fixing it.”
“Double potions.”
And Sherlock had to admit, even though he didn’t like the fact that Molly would undoubtedly replace Sherlock in John’s life someday, right now she wasn’t quite as unbearable as most people usually were. So he gave her a small smile and tried his best to enjoy the game for John’s sake.
As he was about to exit the room, hand hovering right above the doorknob, the professor shouted after him, “Oh, Sherlock!”
“Michael Scott and George Baker, table one. Daniel Freeman and Cynthia Yates, table two…” On and on it went, groups of two being called and taking their seats together, pleasant conversations beginning anew as they began to learn a bit about each other. Sherlock dreaded this, being paired up with some stranger. All people were idiots, and having to act as though a lab partner had any useful input was something he absolutely detested. He eventually had to give up the seat he had claimed when he’d walked into the lab about five minutes before anyone else, much to his irritation. It had been the perfect seat, close enough to all of the lab supplies to get his first pick at anything he might need.
After that, John was escorted back to the library by one of the two girls from earlier. She only left him once they were right outside of the door to the library. John was still trying to work out what had just happened as he sat down across from Sherlock, who didn’t even look up from the book he was reading. John almost thought that Sherlock hadn’t noticed his arrival, but then Sherlock said, “Where have you been?”
He smiled at her.
‘Bye, John!’ Irene yelled, as she followed her parents away. ‘I’ll miss you! Call me!’
‘This is John,’ Sherlock said. ‘I met John almost nine years ago, when I was only fifteen. We began a relationship when I was approximately seventeen years old. We, um, broke up briefly but have been in a stable relationship since I was crowned. Last April, I proposed to John-‘
The game was disappointing; Man U took an early lead and the game stilted into endless passing; John soon lost interest. He and Greg spoke instead as the twins toddled around, using the chairs to keep themselves up.
‘Come with me. You know no one here, you’re feeling awkward, come with me. We shall collect your friends on the way.’ The boy cocked his head, placing the now-empty cup on the table. ‘Come on.’
John laughed, pushing Sherlock down so he was sitting cross-legged in front of his chair. John sat down behind him and began threading his hand through his curls; it felt so good Sherlock almost started dribbling.
He put his joy, his happiness, his sorrow, his anger, his love, his heartbreak, his confusion,
He did everything he could think of. He begged, he cried, he went on a hunger strike. He ran away (briefly), he pleaded with Mycroft, he even called social services. When none of those worked, he tried to be good: to show them that he could take care of himself. He
‘Hoodie.’ Sherlock repeated, picking it up. ‘It appears to have a design on it.’
Harry found out next.
Sherlock huffed. ‘Of-bloody-course. The one time Lestrade actually lets me go after the criminal by myself, it’s fucking pride. He’ll be long gone, John, we can go back to the Yard.’
Dick came up next, grabbing John’s hand and pulling him in for a man-hug. ‘Nice meeting you, John. I’m sorry about my brother.’ He glanced to his right, where Jim and Sherlock were standing so close that John was almost certain their foreheads were touching. ‘But you seemed to have a good time with Irene and us, eh?’
‘I think the note would really work.’ Lestrade carefully covered the body’s face again and resumed his crouch next to Sherlock. ‘What would you write, though?’
Sherlock was utterly dominant; Sherlock had the personality of someone who was born to be in charge. Yet with James he was hit by emotions so subservient it pained him to even think about it, most of the time.
Sherlock looked at him sideways. ‘I can do something even cooler.’
Sherlock realised he’d been quiet for too long and said hastily, ‘it’s just, will they like me?’
Time restarted, and suddenly they were back in the parade, two men pressed together. ‘Then let’s go,’ Sherlock grinned, a totally un-Sherlock grin, and began to lead him into the crowd of his, John’s,
Literally, his heart pauses in his chest. He feels the blood crashing through his veins grind to a horrible halt, the neurons in his brain freeze in their tracks, a brutally cold ice creeping through his muscles and ligaments and bones. Every part of him has stopped, because John Watson is standing in front of him, where Moriarty should be standing.
It was breaking John’s heart to watch, and he realised that this, what he was feeling right now, was what love
John could see that something had happened to make him feel like this, possibly more than one thing. But Sherlock couldn’t, or wouldn’t, tell him.
Neither of her fathers replied. Sherlock was lost, lost in a memory from eighteen years ago, with two boys, one with black hair and one with blonde, dancing in the glow of tiny stars. The start of a story, the start of a journey, the start of Sherlock’s
way, Sherlock, which in my opinion is a lot better because at least I can have normal, human relationships and at least people generally
There was much movement as his family stepped around each other, positioning themselves perfectly. William stood in the middle, slightly forwards, with Sherlock on his right and Trisha on his left. On Sherlock’s right was Mycroft, then his cousin Lilia, then Octavia; on Trisha’s left were Archie and his uncle Richard. Sherlock smiled; they were ranked, as always, with the most important in the middle and decreasing as it went outwards.
John moved so quickly that he almost fell off the roof, squinting at the roof edge. ‘The
John frowns: he can’t help it. ‘But, Nathaniel-‘
‘How do you understand me better than I understand myself?’ John didn't ask it as a question but Sherlock replied anyway, holding John’s shoulders tightly. ‘It’s what best friends are for.’
Probably because of the nice weather, it was busier than it had been before. Students were browsing, a couple of teachers sat in the window eating pieces of amazing looking cake, there was even a curly, black dog sitting under a table occupied by a pretty girl reading Poe. John absent-mindedly bent down to stroke it, looking around and inhaling deeply (the smell was just as mouth-watering)-
‘My son won’t be named Sherlock.’ Sherlock said adamantly. ‘I’ll give him his own name, so he won’t feel like a faded copy of some old-time King.’
‘Now apologise to each other,’ she said quietly.
John smirked and put his arms around Sherlock’s neck. ‘Try it, and see where it gets you,’ he whispered, and Sherlock leaned forwards-
‘Still, Sherlock.’ Lestrade bent down next to him and looked at the body, frowning slightly as he took it in. ‘That was…not good.’
‘I knew it!’ Molly shrieked. ‘I knew you had a girlfriend! Mike owes me fifty quid.' Sherlock smirked when he heard Mike's name: the guard was one of the few people who knew about John's friendship with Sherlock and had been sworn to secrecy. Clearly, he hadn't blabbed yet, which pleased Sherlock greatly. Mike Stamford was clever
When Sherlock had finished, John was quiet for a long time as so, so much of Sherlock finally made sense to him. Finally, he said, ‘that’s why you won’t let people near you. That’s why you insult people all the time. That’s why you have to be the cleverest. That’s why…everything.’
He didn’t mean it like that, Sherlock knew. He was just trying to make Sherlock feel better. Obviously.
And it was all Sherlock’s fault.
Sherlock forgot it all.
Sherlock blinked rapidly, his alcohol-soaked brain refusing to compute what was going on. ‘So have I.’
‘I wouldn’t let King William fuck me.’ Harry said, shaking her head. ‘No idea where he’s been, do I? He’s got, like, ten children, I bet. There are all these rumours about these random illegitimates scattered all over the country, aged from about forty to eighteen.’
The other boy smiled back. ‘I know. I got fat!’
Mycroft sighed, walking towards Sherlock and placing a hand on his shoulder. ‘I’m sorry, Sherlock, but we need you there.’
Sherlock didn’t reply, stopping in front of the final pair of doors down the long corridor. They weren’t particularly ornate, at least compared to most other doors in the palace, simple mahogany crested with gold leaf, but behind them…
People knew, of course; Sherlock had no real secrets, but no one said anything and it wasn't something that was spread around. Some of the staff knew, Mrs Hudson knew, Mycroft knew and Sherlock's father knew, though they never mentioned it. Sherlock often turned around in the studio and saw his brother at the door, but neither discussed it, because if they did they would inevitably get onto the topic of Sherlock’s mother and he was not prepared to do that.
‘Has anyone asked you to prom?’ Molly asked.
‘Don’t you dare talk to me like that,’ he growled. ‘Don’t you dare call me worthless. Don’t you dare call me stupid. You have no right.’
‘Doesn’t have to be perfect,’ Irene smiled. ‘Mike, put on that song.’
John had spent hours looking at Sherlock’s face, like everyone else in the country, and he had realised that his face wasn’t always so sharp and arrogant. Sometimes, when he was looking at his little brother, or talking to Prince Edward, or just staring up at the sky as his father droned on next to him, as he was now…
‘Sir, is your Majesty willing to take the oath?’ The Archbishop asked. Sherlock swallowed and looked at the Archbishop. ‘I am willing.
‘Harriet.’ Jenny hissed. ‘Please.'
After all their issues with Jim Moriarty, Sherlock had been all for exiling Irene, but surprisingly John had asked for her to stay on. She had become Sherlock’s advisor just before Christopher was born and had served him well since then; the kids loved her, John and her seemed to actually like each other and even Mycroft seemed to have got past his dislike for her.
And John felt an ache in his chest that immediately convinced him, reassured him, consolidated the belief that he was not over Sherlock, that he would never be over Sherlock, that he didn’t want to be over Sherlock and that he wanted nothing more than to be with Sherlock, right then, for the rest of their lives. He didn't care that Sherlock had slept with someone else, he didn't care that it had been Sherlock's fault that over seven hundred and fifty people had died on that New Years Eve all those years ago: all he cared about was Sherlock, having Sherlock, but now he couldn't, he would never, ever, ever be able to.
‘Well, once Princess Lydia were born there was no need for this vase.’
‘You were in love with my father.’ Sherlock said. It wasn’t a question, it was a statement. Morag nodded, her eyes flashing. ‘But he didn’t want me. He chose one stupid little girl after another, having bastard after bastard until he married your mother, who had so many beautiful secrets. When she was dead I expected him…’ she took a deep breath. ‘I thought he might pick me. But he went onto another noble girl and another little son, and I had had enough. If I couldn’t have the King, I would have the kingdom.’
He saw William’s eyes, his nose, his cheekbones and thick hair in the people. He saw William’s stature, his build, his height, and suddenly he remembered something Sherlock had said once, a few weeks before they started dating.
John Watson knew, deep in his heart, that he and Sherlock Holmes belonged together, but the two of them had broken their relationship and now, John was left with nothing. Sherlock had moved on, and all John could do was lie in the grass as the rain pattered on his back and cry, cry and cry and cry, as his shattered heart throbbed in his chest.
sweeter, and John fell in love all over again, as he kissed Sherlock’s lips and touched his hand to Sherlock’s cheek-
Mrs Holmes bustled into the sitting room, smiled at Lestrade, chucked Ezra under his chin, bent down and smoothed down Christopher’s hair, and fixed her eyes on her two sons. ‘Yes, Sherlock?’
Victor swallowed hard. ‘Sherlock…’
‘Ah…’ Molly said, voice trembling. ‘My…um…yessss?’’
John shrugged. ‘Doubt it. Go.’
And yet, the thought of leaving was awful.
to find out what it is. The entire summer between school ending and Uni starting he looks for it, doing everything he can to itch the scratch he can’t get rid of, but it seems pointless. John doesn't know
Moriarty was next to him, one hand on his back, the other clutching a handgun. ‘Don’t worry, Sherlock.’ He crooned. ‘Falling’s just like flying, except with a more permanent destination-‘
‘I solemnly promise to do so.’ Sherlock said clearly, though he could hardly hear what he was saying, and at that moment none of it mattered in the slightest to him because in the face of John being here, John being back, John being there nothing else mattered-
The image of Sherlock, five year old Sherlock, sitting next to his dead mother, watching her, patiently waiting for her to wake up, burned in John’s mind; he shuddered.
Irene was talking, but Sherlock was looking at him, his eyes dancing along his face, dipping lower, then back up, front teeth gently biting his plush lower lip, and John wondered what it would be like to bite that full lip himself, gently stroking it with his tongue-
Now it was Sherlock’s time to smirk. ‘I haven't said anything.’
Mike groaned. ‘God, Sherlock, you’re going to get me fired-‘
Trisha sighed. ‘I wanted to talk to you about your relationship.’
he? You didn’t just snog someone senseless and run off. What an utter
Upon hearing an affirmative from all of them, even shy little Molly, John sauntered over to the table. On his way, he passed three snogging couples, wrinkling his nose in disgust as he expertly poured four cups of some mysterious clear liquid.
If someone had listened to that little boy then, let him tell them what had happened and then reassured him that it wasn’t his fault, that he couldn’t have done anything, then everything that could have happened would have been avoided. The guilt had driven Sherlock to drugs, the guilt had driven Sherlock to Moriarty, the guilt had allowed that nurse to manipulate him like that.
‘Long live the King.’ Jenny cried, wiping one eye.
Nathaniel graduating is one of the happiest days of John’s life. Watching his son walk away from the top University in the country with the highest honours makes him proud, certainly, but it’s watching Nathaniel with his friend’s before and after the ceremony that truly makes John smile. He’s so easy with them and clearly very popular: almost all of his classmates stop to talk to him or congratulate him in some way, and John can almost imagine Sherlock standing next to him saying
It had been five months since it had happened and Sherlock still had nightmares about it.
Sherlock asks him why with those big, confused eyes and John just smiles innocently.
Nathaniel smiles then, a bittersweet smile, and John realises with a jolt that he’s now seven years older than Sherlock was when he died. ‘I couldn't have asked for a better father, Papa.
Sherlock was already next to Lila, talking in a low voice, so Ella replied, flicking to a new page. ‘Your brother-in-law insisted a doctor be present at all times, just in case. I was chosen.’
most of the children grimaced. ‘Irene gave John
She’d come out of nowhere: one day she’d not been there, the next she was, acting like she knew everybody and belonged there. She was so in-your-face, loud and confident that John had been sure Sherlock would publicly humiliate and then drop her to the kerb, leaving her to go running off to her Mummy, but unfortunately he

‘Buckingham- you want me-‘ John couldn’t believe what was happening. He had known this boy, who was a prince, for all of thirty minutes and he was inviting him to his house, his palace. ‘But what if I’m a terrorist or murderer or something?’
Or not. Sherlock nods, though, because that’s what he has to do. Let John do what he needs to do, let John go where he needs to go-
Two hours and two bottles later, they were drunk enough that when Irene suggested Truth or Dare they all, even Sherlock, agreed instantly.
There were other moments, of course, but until the summer after his fifteenth birthday, these were the most significant, the most important, the most life changing.
‘Lord.’ Victor corrected, flashing a quick smirk at the king, who sighed. ‘You and
Sherlock turned back to his friend, frowning. ‘I’m pretty sure you’re not allowed to say that, John. Isn't it a bit babyish and, ah,
Sherlock jolted, staring in shock at him. ‘What?’
‘How do you do the deducing thing?’ Hamish asked, making no effort to move backwards. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. ‘You called it deducing.’
‘Um, yes.’ Sherlock shouted. ‘And…you actually like him now! Tell me. God,
“No.”
“Thanks, Sherlock.”
“I saw the look on your face up there, even if nobody else did,” Sherlock informed him. “I, unlike most of the other idiots in this school, observe.”
He had a hard time believing that this was the man’s first time doing something like this, because it felt too damn good to be the work of a rookie. Sherlock’s head bobbed back and forth with ease while his tongue teased the head of John’s cock with precision. In a matter of minutes, John had essentially lost all control of himself and was moaning and whimpering with each suck and lick. Finally, he couldn’t keep himself from it anymore, and he saw a flash of white as he came in Sherlock’s mouth, crying out “Sherlock!” as he did so. As he came down from the high of the climax, his legs gave out from under him, and he slowly lowered himself to the floor so that he and Sherlock were face-to-face. Sherlock appeared absolutely disheveled, with his curls a frizzy mess and his cheeks flushed and eyes alight. It was absolutely arousing. John watched hungrily as Sherlock wiped the remnants of saliva and ejaculate from the corners of his mouth.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Is that what you think?” Sherlock asked.
And shall be your home forever.
John knew that Sherlock’s words weren’t meant to hurt him, but they did sting. It was bad enough that he had been sorted into Hufflepuff. Now Sherlock was saying that it wasn’t even a surprise? Why, because he chose to help people with their homework when they asked? With a huff, John stood, gathering all of his books and quills and shoving them haphazardly into his bag.
“Sit,” he commanded, and Sherlock did as he was told. The professor pulled his trousers and pants from around his ankles, and then held up the pink boxer briefs with a small smile. “Cute.”
Amazing.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s unnecessary.”
Brilliant.
John felt pretty confident that he actually was right, but he decided not to get into it with the professor right now when his future career could be on the line.
“I wanted to say hi!” John said cheerfully, grabbing a piece of bacon and chomping down on it. “I tried to get your attention earlier, but you were reading, so I decided to come to you.”
“Clearly,” Sherlock said. Lestrade appeared taken aback by his bluntness, but Sherlock ignored this and turned to leave. He had hoped to see John off before his first class. The boy had been obviously distressed by his house placement, and Sherlock wanted to make sure that he was okay now. It was a strange feeling for Sherlock, caring so much about the emotions of another person. He wasn’t quite used to it.
“I can tell that she is left handed because although she is not holding a quill at this time, there is a bit of ink smudged between her index and middle fingers on her left hand, as well as drips on ink on her left thumb nail. I know that she recently had her hair cut because there are a few long strands of red hair on her robes the same color as her own hair, although not the length that it is now. And I can tell that she hasn’t done her laundry in over a week because of the surplus of cat fur on her clothes as well as the strands of her own longer hair, and also the disheveled state of her clothes.”
The professor drew back from John for a second, barely, his hands still holding John’s face while John’s fists clutched the back of his robe. “I’ve never done this either, you know.”
Sherlock scowled. “I don’t need you to be my friend.”
John sat on his stool miserably for the rest of the class period as his peers finished up their potions—they were meant to be making a Drought of Living Death. He watched as the professor went around to each cauldron and gave them a grade for their concoctions, and he felt like doing himself in with the killing curse right then and there. Then he waited as all of his classmates filed out of the room, glancing back over their shoulders as they left, giving John sympathetic looks. Only Irene didn’t seem to pity him. Instead, she gave him an oddly suggestive smirk as she left, closing the door behind her, as she was the last one out.
That drew Sherlock up short. He’d never had a person invite him to delve even deeper into their lives.
They had reached Professor Watson’s classroom door, and Sherlock glared at her.
Outside, it was lightly misting, and the cold droplets soothed John’s burning face. He hadn’t even realized that he’d been flushing. Then again, that was to be expected when one’s secrets were stated as cold, hard fact. But as his embarrassment began to subside ever so slightly, it was replaced by anger. As if it weren’t hard enough for John, being a twenty-three year old in his first year at uni, now there was someone out there who somehow knew some of the most intimate details of his private life. Of course, it was amazing. Fantastic. Brilliant. These words kept running through John’s head, even as the rest of his body decided that the best way to react to this situation was rage. He could feel his blood pressure rising, his ears getting hot, his hands clenching into fists.
Then Hufflepuff will be your home
“Would you like me to join you?”
“Of course, you should probably make sure that all of your Saturdays until the Christmas Holidays are cleared, just in case.”
with you.”
“As for your father, your need to please him is almost painfully obvious. Your disdain for being sorted into Hufflepuff, your almost manic desire to achieve perfect marks in your classes, and your interest in playing Quidditch next year all point to seeking parental approval of some kind. When you were on the train you mentioned wanting to be in Gryffindor and become an Auror like your father, which practically screams that you’re seeking to impress him.”
Soon there was a large group of children surrounding Hagrid, and when it seemed like no more would be joining them the giant led them off. Nervously, John cast one more look over his shoulder, hoping to catch sight of Sherlock one more time, but his friend was nowhere to be seen.
Sherlock couldn’t keep his eyes from taking in every minute detail about the boy. He was approximately five-foot-six, weighing about 150 pounds. His hair was short, as though it had been buzzed at one point—most likely during his stint in the army—but was now in the process of growing out. He was solidly built, not quite stocky but far from slim like Sherlock. His left hand had a slight tremor, which he was currently trying to discretely stretch out as he smiled and chatted with a slightly obese boy who was gesticulating wildly. His smile seemed sincere enough, but his eyes… There was something more in those blue eyes. Sherlock cocked his head. Normally he would assume some form of PTSD. He’d seen plenty of soldiers who had come back haunted from the war. But, somehow, Sherlock felt that that wasn’t quite what he was seeing in this boy’s eyes.
As John began to stand up, Sherlock finally shook away his surprise and managed to ask, “Are you doing alright?”
, don’t you think?”
“How isn’t that relevant? That’s something that everybody knows!”
“This is my first year here. But I’ve been looking forward to coming my whole life. My mum and dad are both magic, though of course that doesn’t matter. Anyway, my mum works at St. Mungo’s and my dad’s an Auror for the Ministry of Magic. I want to become an Auror just like him some day. How about you?”
Truly bold beyond compare,
“The fact that you have an older sibling, most likely a brother, is deduced by the fact that you do your homework in a brand new notebook with the name ‘Harry Watson’ engraved in the upper right hand corner of the cover. It could be your father, except that I have it on good authority that your father’s name is Reginald—the person who told me acted as though I should be familiar with that name, although I have no idea why I would be—so the journal would have to belong to another family member. Hence your brother. I guess older because of my previous statement about you being the youngest in your family. The other part about your brother I also assume because of the notebook. As I noted earlier, it’s brand new, and the cover is adorned with the Hogwarts crest. Because of this, I assume that the notebook was gifted to him under the assumption that he would be attending Hogwarts. This clearly did not come to pass, however, and so he handed it down to you. Of course his not attending Hogwarts could have been a personal choice, but the fact that he passed the notebook on to you instead of simply tossing it in the bin seems to imply that the notebook has some sort of sentimental meaning to him—that being that he was looking forward to attending Hogwarts before discovering that he wouldn’t be. And I believe that you have a strained relationship with him based on the carelessness with which you treat the notebook. If you cared about its sentimental value you would be more concerned when its cover was marred with ink blots or when you accidentally spilled pumpkin juice on it, but you weren’t.
“Obviously psychosomatic.”
“Of course it’s psychosomatic.”
Sherlock nodded his agreement. “Yes. Very good.”
This came from Irene Adler, a Slytherin, and John had to admit that he was glad someone had finally said it. The irony was that Irene had a reputation for doing exactly what she was telling Janine to
. There’s always something.”
“Yeah, actually, he does,” John said irritably. Sure, he was upset with Sherlock, but he wasn’t about to let someone talk bad about him.
Just put me on and suddenly
The professor’s smile turned down into a teasing frown. “Oh, yes, right. I’m supposed to be punishing you, aren’t I?”
“I’d always hoped that his children would be in Gryffindor—I’m the head of Gryffindor house, you know. I’m actually a bit surprised that you’re in Hufflepuff, but of course Hufflepuff is an honorable house.”
“That girl you’re looking at. Do you fancy her?” John clarified, and Sherlock’s eyebrows knitted together.
Last year, he’d avoided each and every game, opting to enjoy the serenity of the library. This year, though, he had a John Watson. And John Watson wouldn’t rest until he managed to drag Sherlock out to the first game of the season, which happened to be Hufflepuff vs. Slytherin. John thought it would be fun to have a bit of friendly competition between them, rooting for opposite teams. And so that was how Sherlock ended up standing amongst a group of Hufflepuff first and second years, watching a game whose rules were dubious at best, wishing that he could instead be studying the effect of adding Asphodel to a shrinking potion or reading his Charms textbook over again.
John had never done this with a man before. Then again, he’d hardly even done this with a girl before. That is, unless he counted that one time in fourth year with Mary Morstan, where they’d made out in some secret passage and she’d let him touch her left breast under the shirt but over the bra. So having another man’s knee firmly planted between his thighs was both exhilarating and intimidating. He wasn’t quite sure what he should be doing. Should he thrust? Or grind? He felt pretty positive that he shouldn’t be staying still, which was the course of action he’d been taking up until this point.
It had been three weeks since John was sorted into Hufflepuff, and so far his parents hadn’t written him even a single letter. Their silence was louder than all of the howlers in the world, although John knew that it was his father’s doing, not his mother’s. He knew that, if it were up to her, John would have received a letter a day by now. Of course, his time here hadn’t been completely devoid of letters. Harry had somehow gotten her hands on one of the family owls and sent him a letter congratulating him on his sorting and wishing him a successful school year. John had been in the process of crumpling the letter and tossing it in the bin when he was suddenly struck by a wave of emotion and ended up flattening the letter and staring at it for a long time. After some deliberation he decided to bury it at the bottom of his trunk.
Once he’d finished his spiel, Sherlock held his breath and waited. He knew what came next. Insults, or possibly tears. Sometimes the impact of knuckles with his cheek or nose. He hoped that John would at least avoid his eyes. The last time someone had given him a black eye, it had swelled up so badly that he’d been unable to look through a microscope for two weeks.
“Sherlock, I don’t actually understand most of what you’re saying,” John interrupted him.
“Oh, and my limp isn’t psychosomatic, either.”
Five minutes of blissful silence followed before John spoke up again.
I put it in a song!
“They only like me because I play Quidditch,” he explained.
Lestrade paused, as if waiting for Sherlock to continue, and then asked again, “So are you Mycroft’s brother?”
John’s shout brought Sherlock to a standstill for a moment, and then he picked up his pace without looking up, as though he were trying to get away. This irritated John a bit. If it weren’t for his bloody leg, he would already be in stride with the boy. He forced himself to ignore the discomfort and picked up his own pace, and soon he was striding along beside Sherlock.
“Must be nice.”
“Are you some sort of genius, then?”
“Not your area, or—?”
“Because you have John. Yes, I know.” Sherlock turned and walked away… in the opposite direction of his next class, but he didn’t care. He just needed to get away from Irene Adler as she called after him, “But just you wait. I’ll make you like me, yet.”
John had never felt so violated. All of his problems laid bare by some stranger who couldn’t possibly know the things that he did. It wasn’t as though John went to Mike and told him all about his family troubles, about his dad and Harry. The other things, John could assume that his lab partner had asked around, though he hadn’t the faintest idea why the boy would do that or what he could hope to gain from it. But this was too… personal. Of course, he’d called Harry his brother, when she was in fact his sister, but aside from that everything had been spot-on.
For the second time in his life, Sherlock was made speechless.
, he thought.
The professor sighed. “Alright, Sherlock, would you like to elaborate on Irene’s answer?”
“Why on earth would you do something like that?”
After they broke apart, the professor quickly tucked himself back in and straightened himself up, ruffling his hair with his hands, causing it to fall back into its usual orderly chaos. It took John a bit longer to pick himself up and put himself together. When he finally managed it, the professor was already hurrying about, tidying up the room and reorganizing the papers on his desk. John slowly walked to the front of the classroom, his legs a bit shaky but otherwise keeping it together.
Now that John had Sherlock’s attention, he wasn’t really sure what to say, so he went with, “How’d you know all of that stuff?”
This seemed like a poor excuse to Sherlock, but he didn’t push the issue. Just then, the players began filing onto the field, all of them whooping and waving at the stands, soaking in the attention that the whole school was giving them at that moment. Dejected, Sherlock settled in for a few hours of torture.
“But what could there have been to observe? It isn’t as though I carry my family around with me.”
“John Watson,” the mystery man drawled, leaning back in his expensive-looking chair and steepling his fingers beneath his chin, an action John had watched Sherlock do on multiple occasions when trying to solve a rather difficult homework question or deduce something about a stranger. John swallowed hard, hands trembling by his sides. “What is it that makes you so special, John Watson?”
Sherlock averted his eyes again, and now John saw it, saw the cause of Sherlock’s hesitancy in continuing their earlier conversation. Sherlock was
“Pardon?”
“John, are you all right?” Sherlock asked as John turned to face him. John shrugged, trying to play off his disappointment as coolly as possible, not wanting Sherlock to see how truly upset he was. After all, the older boy was so collected all the time, and John didn’t want to seem weak to him.
“And I’m Sally.” The girl offered her hand for a handshake and John took it.
Sherlock hesitated, and then seemed to decide to dive in headfirst.
Lestrade turned to John. “Is he always this cheerful?”
Amazing.
“I mean, I feel pretty positive that Professor Lestrade’s name is actually Greg, sir.”
Mycroft’s eyes drifted from John’s forehead to his toes, and John got the uncomfortable feeling that he was deducing everything about him like Sherlock had that day in the library. It was significantly less pleasant when Mycroft did it, though.
“Good man,” Lestrade enthused, smacking John on the back, nearly sending the small boy tumbling forward down the stands.
“Yes.”
Sherlock was about to say that yes, he did indeed mind that this small creature wished to disturb him and his peaceful solitude, but something about the boy’s brown eyes stopped him, and instead he found himself saying, “Not at all. Sit down.”
if you’re only reciting something you’ve memorized?”
Welp, there it was. John was about to be kicked out of Professor Holmes’s potions class. And without this credit, he could kiss his dreams of becoming a Healer goodbye. Then again, he couldn’t say that he was surprised. He’d barely scraped by with an ‘E’ in the potions section of his OWLs, and Professor Lestrade had to convince Professor Holmes to let him into the class because man normally only took students that received an ‘O.’
“Well, Mr. Holmes, I’m afraid that it appears we didn’t really do this detention thing right.” The professor slowly walked over to stand in front of Sherlock, grinning at him. “I suppose we’ll have to try again next Saturday.”
“Look, I don’t suppose you’d mind if I were to continue reading, would you?” Sherlock asked irritably, holding the textbook up for John to see. “I’d like to finish this before we reach Hogsmead.”
“W-Why?”
When Sherlock’s mouth finally encircled the head of John’s cock and then slid down almost to the base, it took everything he had to keep from climaxing right then and there. Thankfully, he’d been wanking off for enough years to at least have some stamina. He bit his lip painfully hard to keep from crying out like a girl in a porno, and he twisted his fingers into the professor’s mop of curly hair. He forced himself to stay still, because the urge to fuck Sherlock’s mouth was nearly too strong to resist.
“Who’s asking?” Sherlock asked cautiously.
This actually made John crack a smile, and the professor mirrored it. They watched each other carefully for a few moments, and John felt heat slowly gathering in the pit of his stomach. Finally, he nodded.
The blond boy had been standing quite comfortably only moments before, as if he’d forgotten his injured leg—possibly a psychosomatic limp, then—but now that the professor had brought his attention to the fact that he wasn’t sitting down, the boy shifted his weight uncomfortably from his bad leg to his good one.
“I don’t think you give Sherlock enough credit,” John replied, his voice shaking slightly but otherwise firm. “I didn’t do anything special. I just offered to be his friend.”
“That’s… not the reaction I was expecting, I suppose.”
,” Mycroft replied, as if the answer was painfully obvious. Then he stood and walked back around to stand behind his desk, opening drawers until he found what he was looking for. He pulled out a small leather pouch and dropped it in front of John, who stared at it dumbly.
Professor Watson considered this. “I know that, if people said those things about me—
“It’s not funny. It’s scary. Just you wait, there’s a reason Sherlock Holmes was sorted into Slytherin. That’s the house that practically breeds dark wizards, and if he isn’t one in the making I’ll eat my broom.”
“I don’t plan to go home for the holidays, so I’ll make sure those Saturdays are cleared as well… Unless you plan to go home?”
He eventually found himself walking the perimeter of the Quidditch pitch, watching as a few people flew about in the air, tossing a quaffle around between them. Tryouts had happened last week, and John had completely forgotten about them, not that it mattered much since he was a first year and it was against the rules for a first year to play Quidditch. He wished that he could have tried out, though. Becoming a seeker just like his dad would be the perfect way to prove that he really was a Watson. That even though he wasn’t Gryffindor, he was still worth something.
The professor studied him for a moment, and then smiled, walking around the front of his desk and catching John’s face between his hands once more. “We’ll just use
“Why do people care?”
“What?” was all he was able to stammer out.
He was somewhat disappointed by this turnout. He’d been enthralled, trying to figure out what secrets hid behind this boy’s eyes. Now he would be forced to learn how tedious the boy actually was. Sherlock prepared for the illusion to shatter as he sat down, averting his eyes and flipping open his anatomy book, hoping that his face clearly showed that he would not be entertaining any of this boy’s foolish attempts at partner bonding.
He was doing very well in all of his other classes, too, especially in Defense Against the Dark Arts. This had been the class that he was most looking forward to, and although they hadn’t started in on anything practical just yet he was doing very well with his homework and in-class participation. He always had the answer when Professor Lupin called on him, and he was the one that first year Hufflepuffs flocked to when in need of homework help. Sometimes, while sitting in the library with Sherlock, one of his fellow Hufflepuff first years would meekly approach the table and ask John about how to go about answering a particular question. Sherlock would glare at the person in annoyance, but John was happy to help. Once, after one such situation had occurred, John asked, “Does it bother you that they come to me for help?”
“You have beautiful handwriting. Makes mine look a bit rubbish, doesn’t it?” the professor joked.
“Well, he’s nice enough to me. But he doesn’t seem very well liked. He told me that he doesn’t have any friends,” John explained.
For you’re unafraid of toil.
Now Sherlock sourly glared at Lestrade out of the corner of his eye, unamused by the boy’s teasing. “Are you quite done?”
Sherlock seemed to hesitate before entering the corridor and standing over John, appearing not quite sure what to do in this situation. John felt his face flush with embarrassment at being caught crying, and he quickly cleared his throat before scrambling to his feet. Sherlock watched him do so with an unreadable expression, and John felt more than uncomfortable under the older boy’s gaze.
The rest of the pop quiz went in the same manner, and afterwards the professor brought out a ghoul from his office to show everyone. The muggle-borns and a few of the half-and-pure blood students who had never seen a ghoul ‘ooh’ed and ‘ahh’ed over it, but Sherlock was unimpressed. His family had a ghoul of their own, which Sherlock had named Redbeard back when he had wished to become a pirate. He’d even insisted to Mycroft that Redbeard would be his first mate. Foolish, Sherlock knew now. Simple childhood fantasies and misconceptions.
“You did get one thing wrong, though.”
Sherlock shrugged. “For instance, she has some form of anxiety. She has a pet cat here at school with her, she is left handed, she recently had her hair cut, and she hasn’t done her laundry in over a week. Those are all of the things I have noticed so far.”
“I don’t mean to be inappropriate…” the professor said, but his eyes were already undressing Sherlock, and Sherlock
Perhaps you find you are patient,
“Ah, so you want to be in Gryffindor, hmm? Well, let’s see here… You certainly do have the potential to be an excellent Gryffindor… But—” John’s heart sank “—you would do so much better in HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Then I suggest you find a tutor,” Sherlock said. They had reached the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and were now soliciting outside the door. “Mycroft only finds issue in people sharing answers. A tutor will help you with your homework without giving you the answers. In fact, it’s probably in your best interest if you hope to progress into your NEWT years.”
“But you do. You carry them on your face and in your mobile phone.”
“Yeah. Believe it or not, I don’t actually look for validation in the form of holiday invites by second years. I actually wanted to ask you if you’ve talked to your brother about the whole ‘taking points off for “cheating”’ thing?”
There was a bit of a rustling sound, and then the professor’s now exposed cock was pressed up against Sherlock’s backside, its impressive length and girth obvious. The man bent over and whispered in Sherlock’s ear, “Is this okay?” to which Sherlock replied with an enthusiastic nod. The professor then kissed the tender spot of skin behind Sherlock’s ear, trailing the kisses to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and then down his spine a little ways. Sherlock could have come from this alone, but he forced himself to hold it together for at least a few minutes longer.
“Don’t worry,” Molly stage whispered to him over the cheers of the crowd. “I don’t like Quidditch either. You and I can be confused together.”
“Harry. She’s my sister. Harry’s short for Harriet.”
“Hey,” Greg said in a moment of sudden realization. “You’re that kid that hangs out with Sherlock Holmes, aren’t you?”
Lestrade glanced between Sherlock and John and Anderson and Donovan before saying, “I’ll see you after.”
“It’ll be fine. Go.”
“Do me.”
“What do you mean ‘deducing things about her’?”
His silence apparently seemed to frighten the professor, who quickly said, “Or, well, of course, we don’t have to. I don’t want you to feel that I’m pressuring you into anything.”
“Boyfriend?”
John laughed again. “Alright, well, luckily for you, I know all of the good takeaway places around here. What do you say about Indian?”
“Experience of what?”
“Not exactly, no.”
“No, I… I do. Feel the same.”
“Don’t fidget like that, it bothers me,” Sherlock instructed, and John automatically dropped his hands. “Now, do you see that big man right there? The one with the lantern? His name is Hagrid, and he’ll be taking you and the other first years to the castle.”
“Oh, that’s so nice of you! You’re such a nice person, John, I wish I was more like you. To be honest, I wouldn’t be brave enough to approach a Slytherin, I hear that they’re dreadfully mean. I mean, I don’t know much about them, since I never even knew about Hogwarts until I got my acceptance letter, but from what I hear they’re full of dark wizards and the like. Isn’t it odd that even the Slytherins don’t like him? Maybe it’s because they’re afraid of him. He does look pretty stand-offish, doesn’t he? Oh, but you must never judge a book by its cover I suppose—”
Sherlock had to admit, he appreciated Lestrade standing up for him. That didn’t happen very often, and if he was being honest, he would have never expected it from a Gryffindor of all people. Of course John was nice to him. It was the Hufflepuff in him, though Sherlock still wasn’t sure exactly how long that loyalty would last. But Lestrade had no reason to take pity on a stand-offish, anti-social second year Slytherin.
“My parents thought it was all some huge joke when the professor delivered it. He had to turn our dog into a footstool and back before they believed him, and then they were so terrified they threatened to call the police. Of course, I was so excited, and I talked them into letting me go, and so the professor came back another day and we all went shopping for my things in Diagon Alley. It was amazing, with all of its magical shops and everything; well, of course you know how amazing it is, you’ve probably been there with your parents all your life. What’s it like to grow up with magic? It must have been wonderful…”
If Sherlock had known some spell to magic both of their clothes off, he would have cast it here and now. Instead, he just nodded his consent, and that was apparently all that the professor needed. The man stepped forward and used one hand to pull Sherlock into the bruising kiss of his fantasies while the other hand slid down, deftly unbuttoned Sherlock’s trousers, and slid into Sherlock’s pants to grasp at his cock. Sherlock moaned into the professor’s mouth, and the professor smiled.
“So, between teaching at this godforsaken school and helping the Ministry, I really don’t have time for much else. However, I might be…
“Well?”
“Yes, I’ve heard that you say that, too. But I don’t think you are.”
Getting the cold shoulder from his parents was painful, but he decided to use it as motivation to do even better in his studies so that he could prove that he was just as good as any Gryffindor. By his third Transfiguration class he was performing better than all of his fellow Hufflepuffs and even a few of the Ravenclaws in his class. Of course, Professor McGonagall wasn’t one to choose favorites, but she did always make a point of stopping to complement his work, sometimes offering hints on how to perform the spell with more ease next time. John enjoyed the attention immensely, and he felt that soon he would have something to show his parents that would make them proud.
He had been so distracted by the two girls that he hadn’t been paying attention to how long his concoction had been boiling. The instructions said to only let it boil for three minutes, no more, but he’d forgotten to time it as his head had been whipping back and forth as though he’d been watching a ping-pong match. Because of this, a puff of grey smoke had erupted from the opening of the cauldron, followed by the smell of burnt asparagus and a foamy, acidic substance that immediately began eating its way through the desk the cauldron was sitting on.
And adventures you will share!
“Then why do you always glare?”
“Being categorized into a house.”
Sherlock smiled tentatively. “I’m glad.”
Of course, nobody had attempted to help him, for he was the most disliked student in all of Hogwarts. His know-it-all attitude and dry sense of humor did not liken him to anybody, not even his fellow Slytherins. People thought him odd and a freak, and most weren’t afraid to speak their minds to him, either.
“Greg Lestrade. We’ve met before,” the boy reminded Sherlock. Sherlock indeed remembered their initial introduction, which included a stray bludger to the gut on one of Sherlock’s evening walks. Lestrade was a beater for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and had apologized profusely for what had happened, much to Sherlock’s surprise. So Lestrade had stood apart from the other Gryffindors in Sherlock’s mind, although he could have sworn that the boy’s name had been Gavin…
Sherlock’s heart fluttered, and he nodded before slowly backing away and hurrying toward the door. He vaguely wondered what he would tell Irene. Would he share everything with her? He knew that she would want him to, but the thought didn’t really appeal to him. However, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to keep it a secret from her. She liked to say that people had a “glow” after they’d had sex, and doubtlessly she’d see this “glow” on him from a mile away. After everything that had happened today, he suspected that he looked a bit like a supernova. So, he decided to give her the bare minimum, and keep all of the specifics to himself.
He looked down and was met with the top of a head of curly hair. The professor’s fingers were making quick work of John’s belt, buttons, and zipper. In a matter of seconds, the man was peeling John’s trousers down, leaving him to stand in his red boxer-briefs, erection straining against the thin material. The professor glanced up at him and cocked a playful eyebrow.
“So, I heard John Watson will be spending Christmas with the Holmeses,” Lestrade said as he jogged to catch up with Sherlock, who was on his way to his Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Sherlock didn’t even bother to glance at him. “Why wasn’t I invited? I’m hurt.”
“The way you carry yourself suggests your age in relation to your family. The youngest always tends to have a softness to them, bred from babying and coddling. Of course, there’s also an air of maturity about you, which suggests that you’ve grown up watching the successes and failures of close family members older than you, and that you’re learning from their experiences. The dog was a long shot, assumed only by the fur that was on your clothes the day you sat with me on the train. I only guessed the breed based on the length of the fur and the fact that the color of the fur was white and brown.
“Nobody told me. Like I said before, I
Sherlock began to grow somewhat antsy as the professor neglected to call his name. He began counting out the remaining students, hoping that he might end up by himself after all, but was disappointed to find that there was an even number of students. Finally, after another minute of names being called, Sherlock was the only one left. Well, him and—
“John.”
“What do you need me to do?” Sherlock asked, deciding that he had been staring at Professor Watson’s smile for far longer than was socially acceptable.
John cleared his throat and nodded. “Yeah. Uh, see you ‘round?”
Sherlock was stunned. “You want to be my friend?”
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, and then buried his nose in his book without answering John’s question. Irritated, John reached across the table and placed his hand on the book, pushing it down so that it was no longer hiding his friend’s face.
John returned his grin before casting one more nervous glance around the table and standing up. “Alright, well I’m going to get ready for my first class. I’ll see you later.”
“And you don’t?”
“I would have been more impressed with your ‘knowledge’ if it had been something worth being impressed over.”
Fantastic.
“Why would you come to that conclusion?”
Well, it seemed that Sherlock wouldn’t be sharing anything with Irene after all.
Professor Watson’s joking made Sherlock relax a bit, and he replied, “Yes, well, that does tend to be the purpose of a detention.”
“Precisely, so why waste space remembering it when I can just ask the person nearest to me how it works?” Sherlock replied simply. John looked as though he might argue, but then thought better of it. Instead, he simply shook his head and then went back to working on his homework. Sherlock watched him scribble away at the essay for a few minutes before closing his own textbook and leaning back in his chair, examining the people sitting at the far end of their table. He began to practice deducing things about them, a fun game that he enjoyed playing whenever he became bored. A Ravenclaw girl, most likely a third year, caught his attention first. His eyes brushed over every inch of her in order to obtain important information.
“Yes,” Sherlock whimpered.
John relaxed a bit. “Alright. What do you like?”
“…Of course, the most logical way to go about this particular conundrum would be to—” Sherlock was saying, staring down at his Defense Against the Dark Arts homework. He and John were in the library, sitting across from each other at a table, each of them working on their assignments.
Mycroft watched John for a moment before slowly nodding and muttering, “Indeed.”
“What reaction were you expecting?”
And then the professor was slowly sliding into him, and though there was the burning sensation of being stretched a little too wide, there was also the pleasurable sensation of being filled to the brim with Professor John H. Watson, the man he’d fantasized about day and night for over a year now. This was a dream come true. No, it was better than a dream come true. None of Sherlock’s fantasies had done the professor justice.
Sherlock quickly came to realize that having a friend required quite a bit of effort on his part, effort that he was not used to putting forth. Instead of spending hours alone in the library on the weekends, he instead had to endure the company of the first year boy. Though perhaps endure wasn’t the correct word to use here. For any other person it may have been, but John’s company wasn’t something that someone endured. Instead, it simply posed as a distraction to Sherlock. It was a distraction that Sherlock wasn’t sure how he felt about. On one hand, John could go on forever talking about the most mundane things, like the goings-on in the news or his favorite singer. On the other hand, Sherlock finally had someone to talk things through with, a role previously filled by a skull that he kept on his nightstand, much to the distress of the other second year Slytherin boys.
“Ah!” John shouted out in surprise, pushing away from the mess he’d made and fearfully pulling his wand out of the pocket of his robes, as if he knew what to do to stop the acidic foam from eating away at everything it touched.
Sherlock,” John snapped, suddenly angry. He didn’t like the fact that Mycroft thought that his brother was so unlikable that John would need
“Oh.” Lestrade thought for a second, and then asked, “You’re not…? I mean, it’s fine if you are. But are you—?”
“I find you intoxicating, Mr. Watson.” The professor hadn’t moved from the spot he’d been planted in since the beginning of their… ‘conversation’ didn’t seem to be the right word for it… but somehow it felt like he was closer to John than ever before. The air was becoming thick and the whole world felt as though it had shrunk down into that small dungeon.
Sherlock blushed but didn’t bother to retort. Not that he could have even if he wanted to. All he could focus on right now was the throbbing of his penis, which the professor had once again grabbed ahold of as he kneeled between Sherlock’s thighs. The professor then licked his lips, smirked, and bent over, taking Sherlock’s cock into his mouth in one go. Sherlock gasped and grabbed at the chair beneath him, his head lolling back, biting his lower lip painfully to keep from crying out like a girl in a porno. He could only imagine what would happen if someone heard him moaning and gasping the way he wanted to right now.
“In my… Did you look in my phone? How—”
It took every ounce of self-control that Sherlock had to keep his jaw from hitting the floor.
“I mean, we don’t have to. I just thought…”
John shifted his dumbfounded look from the pouch to Mycroft. “You’re… paying me to be his friend?”
John was fighting the urge to storm out then and there, since the professor obviously wasn’t taking this seriously. Instead, he stared the professor down, cocking his head to the side with an unamused smile, and said, “No, I don’t have a girlfriend.”
“Because it isn’t relevant.”
The hat was yanked off of his head, and John tried his hardest to keep his disappointment off of his face. Instead, he forced himself to smile and made his way over to the table of yellow and black, shaking the hands offered to him and accepting congratulations. He sat down next to Molly Hooper, who began prattling on about how wonderful it was that they were in the same house now, and wondering about where they would be sleeping and what classes would be like the next day.
“No boyfriend, no.”
“For those of you who don’t know me,
“You don’t eat?”
And find yourself rather loyal,
Sherlock highly doubted this, but he was willing to try anything once for his friend. He let his eyes wander over the large crowds that filled the stands, wondering what the odds were that somebody would get trampled and the game would be canceled. Just as he was contemplating the idea of using his magic to start a fire that could spur a stampede that would lead to said trampling, a voice shouted over the crowd, “Bloody hell, is that Sherlock Holmes?”
“Well, why not?”
“It doesn’t bother me.”
John thought about this for a moment. Maybe Sherlock was right. Just because the sorting hat thought that John belonged in Hufflepuff, that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t be able to make his father proud. He would just have to work harder to show his father that he could be just as much of a Gryffindor as he was a Hufflepuff. This brought a small smile to John’s lips.
“About
John smiled meekly. “Hi.”
“And modest, too.”
“Not particularly, no.”
“Don’t I?” Sherlock asked in a bored tone, his attention still on his book.
“He’s not insane…”
to remain his friend. He didn’t like that one bit. “I like spending time with him, and I’m going to
As John sat down on the stool, his eyes met Sherlock’s for one moment before the hat slid over his eyes, blinding him.
“Doubtful.”
Sherlock turned. “Yes?”
“No.” John’s voice was sharp, and Sherlock’s eyebrows raised in surprise. John didn’t care, however. Right now he just needed to get away from Sherlock and everyone else in this bloody school. Irritably, he flung his bag over his shoulder and then stormed out of the library.
“Why are you impartial?”
“You are aware, of course,” Mycroft said, walking around his desk and sitting down on the corner of it, raising his eyebrows at John, “that Sherlock has asked to invite you to our house for Christmas.”
“I do. Gryffindor is scarlet. My pants are candy apple red.” John had meant this to sound sarcastic and flirtatious, but in the end, with his voice all breathy, it just sounded a bit stupid.
Sherlock liked to believe that he was an unfeeling machine. Capable of ignoring any and all human emotions in favor of completely dedicating himself to both academia and scientific research. He’d told countless people on countless occasions that he considered himself married to his work. His brother, Mycroft, tended to agree with the notion that caring was not an advantage. That sentiment was for the weak. Sherlock hated being in agreement with his brother on anything, but in this case it seemed like they were completely, and rather unfortunately, on the same page.
psychosomatic, so that was another thing his lab partner had gotten wrong—he’d heard Mike calling after him, asking him to wait up. But he couldn’t wait. He’d needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. He needed to escape, to breathe fresh air that didn’t smell like formaldehyde.
John licked his lips. Suddenly, the professor’s gaze felt like it was searing his flesh, like he was staring right through him. He shifted a bit in his seat. He’d always thought that the professor was an attractive man. After all, someone would have to be blind to
“Yeah. Bye.” Sherlock watched as the boy bounded away. His smile slowly faded, but the corners of his mouth remained slightly upturned. It would be nice to have a friend. Last year had been quite lonely, although Sherlock never would have admitted it. In fact, most of Sherlock’s life had been lonely. Making friends had never been something he was good at, and even now he didn’t understand what he had done right in order to make John like him.
“John Watson and Sherlock Holmes, table twenty-two.”
“I never insinuated that you weren’t,” Sherlock replied, though his eyes still closely watched John.
as a reward system.”
This seemed to snap the girl out of her trance. “Oh! Sorry! Sorry, I’m Molly. Molly Hooper. John’s friend. We’re in Hufflepuff together—well, I suppose you could tell that from what I’m wearing, and John says that you’re excellent at deducing things about people. I wonder, what can you deduce about me? Actually, I think I’d rather not know, John says that you have a habit of making people cry when you deduce things about them. And I’m a pretty easy crier, though maybe you’ve probably already deduced that about me. I might not be that hard to read, actually. My mum says that she can read me like an open book, and I—”
“Yes, I understand.”
“I don’t know. I’ve never gone out to eat on campus before.”
. Or to be Professor Watson’s.
“Molly and I met on the boat ride,” John explained.
John blinked twice and then cleared his throat before saying, “Sorry?”
I’m the Sorting Hat of old.
“Are you always this big of a tease?” John gasped, and the professor chuckled.
. A Hufflepuff, no less. And now you’ve invited him
“Ah, so he didn’t tell you. Interesting. Of course, my parents are more than happy to welcome you into our home, there’s no need for you to worry about that. The request simply piqued my curiosity. I’ve never known Sherlock to spend more than five minutes with another human being, much less want to invite them over for a full holiday. I knew that he’d been spending some time with you, but I suppose I just hadn’t realized how serious he was about this.”
“We need you to come with us,” the girl blocking his way said, her voice velvety smooth. John’s eyes widened fearfully.
“Of course I don’t know the answer yet. That is the point of homework if I’m not mistaken. Talking things through is how I’m able to work things out. Things become clearer outside of my mind palace.”
John chose to ignore the stab at his intellect and simply nod, mostly because he was struck dumb by the intensity of the professor’s gaze.
“Hey. Wait a second. I want to talk to you.”
Without a word, Sherlock made his way to the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk. He looked over what the professor had already written and then got to work copying down the rest. He was about halfway done when he felt a presence behind him, far closer than would normally be considered polite.
“How could you possibly know about the drinking?” John interrupted, astounded.
John’s heart dropped as he realized that he would probably be late for his next class. “Oh no.”
“I… I don’t…”
“How anyone could mistake you for heterosexual is beyond me,” the professor remarked with a roll of his eyes before leaning forward and kissing the inside of John’s thigh. John groaned and rolled his head back, his cock throbbing in anticipation. He wanted the professor to just get to it, but instead the man made a point to kiss every square inch of John’s lower half except for the part that bloody
Which was why Sherlock couldn’t understand why he found himself staring at the blond boy that had just walked into his advanced anatomy lab.
“I can, and I do.”
“I’d like to,” Sherlock said quickly. “Very much so.”
“Really, don’t let what she said bother you. Are you sure you’re okay?” John nodded. “Alright. Well, I’ve got to go, but I’ll see you around. Tell Sherlock I said hi.”
“I’ve finished my homework. I’m going for a walk.”
Sherlock jumped and spun around, swiping at his ear where Irene Adler’s hot breath had tickled the skin. She was smirking at him, arms crossed and one perfectly plucked eyebrow cocked. Sherlock rolled his eyes and walked away from the bathroom mirror, which he’d been fixing his curls in, trying to make them lay in a somewhat orderly manner. Irene jogged after him as he shoved the bathroom door open and walked out into the corridor beyond.
he graduated).
“So, can anyone tell me the difference between a ghost and a ghoul?”
“Yeah, um, Molly? I think it’s time for us to get to class,” John interrupted, gesturing to the almost empty Great Hall.
John shook his head. “No, I want to know. Did someone tell you? They must’ve.”
, John wasn’t gay, so he didn’t really know why he was having any of these thoughts to begin with.
Of course, there were a ton of students that had to be sorted first. As the students were called up and their fates were determined, John took the chance to really scan the faces in the crowd. Finally, at the very end of the table full of students with green and silver ties, John recognized the back of Sherlock’s head by the curly black hair. Sherlock was bent over a book, not paying any attention at all to the sorting ceremony going on. That is, until John’s name was called.
This made John’s indignation for his friend freeze up. “What do you mean?”
And then John’s potion exploded.
“Well, I guessed that you were from England based solely on your accent. You speak with a Received Pronunciation accent, which of course is not entirely indicative of you being from England, but it is a good place to start since it has a negligible presence in Scotland and Northern Ireland and is arguably losing its prestige status in Wales. The fact that you speak with a RP accent also aided me in predicting your status of wealth, as well as your tan. It was a particularly rainy summer throughout the United Kingdom, especially these past few weeks, so one would assume that you traveled somewhere sunny and warm shortly before starting school. The ability to travel and then also purchase all of your school supplies new suggests some form of wealth, or at least that your family is financially well-off.
“That’s not what I mean. What I mean is that you act like you know everything. Maybe you should just admit that you don’t know the answer to this problem, and then you can ask someone your year for help,” John offered, raising his eyebrows.
“I’d rather like to have the guarantee that you—”
He would never admit it aloud, but Sherlock was actually a little jealous of Molly. He’d known that he wouldn’t be John’s only friend here at Hogwarts—indeed, the boy was far too friendly to only befriend one person in his seven years here—but to Sherlock this seemed to signify the beginning of the end of his and John’s friendship. Soon enough, John would have a group of Hufflepuff friends, possibly with a few Gryffindors and Ravenclaws mixed in, and then he wouldn’t need Sherlock anymore. His new friends would convince him that Sherlock was just dead weight that he was lugging about for no good reason, and eventually John would smarten up and cut his ties. To Sherlock, this seemed inevitable. He had just hoped that it wouldn’t happen so soon.
“OI! HEADS UP!” a voice shouted at John, but it was too late, for a quaffle had found its way to John and hit him squarely in the temple, effectively knocking him to the ground. Two people landed ungracefully next to him, leaping off of their brooms and hurrying to his side. “Are you alright?”
“Not a fan of anatomy?” John asked, still reading over his own syllabus.
John was shocked. “Er, yeah, he did.”
John wanted to argue on his own behalf, but instead he found himself asking, “Who’s Geoffrey?”
Suddenly, the professor pulled away, and Sherlock’s eyes flew open in shock. For a second, he feared that the professor had changed his mind, but the man had simply reached over to grab a chair.
Behind him, Sherlock heard the professor mutter something that sounded like a spell, and then, without warning, one of the man’s fingers slid into his asshole, slicked up with some sort of lubricant. He gasped loudly as the man expertly found and stroked his prostate. Sherlock found himself white-knuckling the edges of the desk, his cheek flat against the cool wooden surface, eyes squeezed shut with pleasure and the slightest bit of pain.
“Sir, about the class. Please, I need it, and I need to pass it. I swear that I take this seriously, but potions just doesn’t come to me as naturally as some of my other classes. I’ve been trying to find a tutor, but nobody has the time. They’ve all got their own NEWTs to worry about, and—”
“I’ve known my brother longer than anybody. I know how…
“Well, I’m not like you.”
The man had John’s face between his hands in a matter of seconds, and John jumped to his feet, the stool that he’d been sitting on clattering backwards onto the stone floor. As the professor’s thin lips met John’s soft ones, he had the fleeting thought,
“I’m hardly a know-it-all simply because of my advanced vocabulary and problem solving skills, at least not in the derogatory connotation of the phrase.”
“You like that?” the professor asked, his lips lightly brushing against Sherlock’s.
Indeed, she did not stop talking until they got out of the boats and were lead into a small room where they were told to wait until things were ready for them. At this point, almost everybody was quiet, fearfully considering how in fact they were going to be sorted into houses. This was one thing that John’s parents had never told him about. They said that the wondering was all part of the experience. Now, as nerves twisted his stomach, he wished that they had spared him the experience and had simply told him.
“Do you have any friends at Hogwarts?” he asked. This elicited a chuckle from Sherlock.
“Yeah. I mean, Hufflepuff is nice,” John lied. Sherlock cocked an eyebrow.
“Alright, everyone,” Professor Lupin announced, striding into the room, a small smile on his lips. “We’re starting today’s class with a pop quiz.”
“Right, yes,” John said, grabbing Molly’s arm, causing her rambling to cut off mid-sentence. “Molly, this is Sherlock. Sherlock, this is Molly.”
“Oh! Oh no! Oh I always do that, I can’t seem to stop rambling once I’ve started. One time when I was little…” On she went as John led her out of the Great Hall and managed to find his way to the Transfiguration classroom just before the class started. She only finally stopped talking when the cat sitting upon Professor McGonagall’s desk transformed into the professor herself. Everyone clapped and cheered in astonishment, and then their first lesson began. It was mainly all theory, but toward the end Professor McGonagall passed out matchsticks and taught them the incantation to transfigure it into a sewing needle. John managed to make his matchstick shiny and metallic, but was unable to fully transform it.
Sherlock stared at John for a moment, head cocked, and then returned his attention to his book as he said, “I don’t quite understand how it was seen as such a shock that you were sorted into Hufflepuff.”
“On the train. He let me sit with him.”
“You don’t have to do that, you know.”
Finally, Sherlock glanced up from his book and gave John a disapproving look. “Pity, we could have split it. Do think it through next time.”
“I figured that if he ever managed to manipulate someone into being friends with him, they would have to be just as insane as he is.”
“Well, the game hasn’t started yet. You’ll see once it’s started!”
“You’re welcome, John.” Sherlock paused, and then asked, “Don’t you have a class to be getting to?”
The professor licked his lips again and nodded. “Good. Good. But, you know, it’s all fine.”
“Oh. How did you meet him?” Molly asked, her eyes focused on Sherlock’s dark, curly hair, which was the only part of him visible since he had returned to reading his textbook.
‘John,’ Sherlock breathed, and John pulled Sherlock towards him so their heads were touching, his lips just grazing Sherlock’s left ear as he murmured, ‘Will you run away with me?’
John nodded, smiling as Jenny recounted some story from the night before. He’d been so glad when she’d found people to hang around with at the resort; it made him feel less guilty about constantly asking to come back. Thank God all three of them loved it there, because John looked forward to it all year around.
'Honestly, John, I know how hard this must be for you.' A single tear escaped her left eye and she wiped it away fiercely.
His father laughed and patted his head and John smiled in delight. Even three years after he’d come back, John felt a spark of joy whenever he saw his father.

attention to her date of conception. She’s planning on leaving you and taking everything. You’ll be a pauper, Philip, which will be especially bad once you speak to Sally.’ Sherlock nodded at the DS, who looked outraged in the corner. ‘Congratulations are in order, Philip, though how you’ll be able to pay for your
Maybe it is the stillness of the air: dank, warm, so stagnant it almost hurts to breathe. Maybe it’s the creeping darkness over his bedchamber, shadowing the room. Maybe it’s just the feeling, deep in his chest: loss, sadness, loneliness.

Lestrade didn't say anything as Sherlock peeled back the blanket, though Sherlock could sense that he was displeased with his words to Anderson. ‘Ok, Lestrade, tell me off,’ he said. ‘I probably deserve it, etcetera etcetera.’
Except, at the same time, it wasn't simple and it wasn't just like it had been when they were children. There were too many illicit glances, too much touching, too much staring, and John noticed it from Sherlock just as much as Sherlock noticed it from him. It gave him hope, as the summer progressed, that maybe,
what he needs to say,
‘You’re an idiot,' he said to himself. It was too quiet, not harsh enough, so he screamed it, repeating the same four words over and over, shouting to the sky, ‘you’re an idiot!’
Out of his back pocket, he withdrew John’s faded (and much annotated) copy of
Most of the time Sherlock and James didn't communicate by sound. One could tell what the other was thinking without even looking at them; they were so tuned to the other that, until the beginning of the year, no-one outside their friendship group mentioned one without the other. Sherlock-and-Jim, Jim-and-Sherlock.
‘They’re men who sex men, and girls who sex girls,’ Seb continued. ‘Fucking gross, right?’
‘Are we going? To my house.’ Sherlock said, sweeping towards the door.
brother,' Archie smirked, and Sherlock laughed as Mycroft's lip curled. 'Of course he can come out!' Sherlock said. 'Trisha, too.'
‘One,’ Irene said mildly, ‘Those stupid people are your brother-in-law’s mother, father, sisters and daughters. Two, you refused to sit up there. You threw a whole fit about it.’ She narrowed her eyes. ‘Are you high?’
‘I love you,’ John told the gravestone. ‘I love you, and I wish I’d been brave enough to tell you that before.’
‘Who is it?’ Sherlock asked. He was imagining a tall, blonde woman who Mycroft saw out of his window and salivated at; totally out of his league, totally impossible. What was Mycroft’s type? Did Mycroft had a type? How had this crush formed in the first place-
James is approaching him, his feet loud on the wooden floor, and Sherlock closes his eyes as the older man pauses, slightly to his left. ‘Sherlock…’
John and Jenny simultaneously gasped. Siger nodded, and John was shocked to see tears pricking his eyes. ‘It’s- it’s not good.’
James doesn’t view life as a gift. James views life as something that must be extinguished, in order to gain power. He is Mycroft without the self-control.
‘You’re so childish,’ Mycroft snapped. ‘Anthea, please tidy away this vase. It’s quite disturbing the zen of the room.’ The moment the words were out of his mouth he looked horrified: Sherlock was almost pissing himself laughing. ‘The
John felt slightly awkward at this realisation but Mycroft coughed and looked away, the moment broken. ‘I will cancel the address for later-‘
When John was nineteen, he ended up in the middle of the London pride parade with Sherlock Holmes.
‘You and him get on so well, though,’ John replied. ‘Why aren't you hanging around with him?’
‘Well,’ Irene said haughtily. ‘I’m sorry I couldn't steal anything better.’
‘If Sherl’s busy,’ Jim sighed, and moved off the sofa before pointing at Sherlock. ‘Go on, Tiger.’
Smith had told Hunter (despite Hunter's protestations that he was not gay, John was sure that there was something going on between the two of them) and Isaac had guessed. For a seventeen year old boy, Isaac was incredibly observant.
‘We’ve spent a lot of time together. I’ve told you my backstory. You’ve told me yours.’
'When I’m with you, I am not only great, I am good.’
‘The second,’ he said, ‘is that King Sherlock William Scott has been secretly dating Doctor John Hamish Watson since he was seventeen years old.’

The man smiled, and reached up, kissing John quickly on the lips. ‘Obviously. The name’s Sherlock Holmes.’
His hair was longer, curling into the nape of his neck in a way that John found strangely attractive. His skin was incredibly pale, paler than usual, and his cheekbones were even more prominent; he had lost weight. His eyes seemed duller than usual, but that might just have been the grief, and John found himself staring into them like a blind man seeing the sun for the first time. He had forgotten just how beautiful, just how unique, just how perfect Sherlock’s eyes were-
Because, his brain screamed, you love him.
The day that Nathaniel gets married is the happiest of John’s life.

It was almost as if it were planned.
‘What?’ Sherlock said, eyebrows creasing. ‘What’s happened?’
Not again. Don’t remember. Not again. Don’t remember. Not again. Don’t remember.
Morag straightened up. ‘Fine. We have no choice. We’re disowning you, William.’
‘Not a word,’ Mike smiled, leaning back in his chair. John turned back to Sherlock. ‘So how?’
Sherlock, who was standing next to a tall boy with floppy brown hair and an arrogant smile and leaning against the counter, grinned. ‘Robber
‘Ahem.’ Sherlock rocked back on his feet, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. ‘John.’

like a puppet. At least he could pretend without feeling like a fraud.
She had once told him that he was worth no more to anyone than a sewage rat. She had said no one had liked him or would ever like him, because of his deductions, and he was an arrogant good-for-nothing who should abdicate when his father died, so Archie would become King. How she justified that Archie would be a better King than Sherlock was unknown to him; Archie hated the limelight even more than he did, and Sherlock was almost positive that as soon as he was old enough Archie would get as far away from the palace as he could.
Mycroft lifted his hands in a surrender gesture. ‘Pax, brother mine. I wouldn’t mention his name. Not after what he did to you. And me. And the rest of our family. And our country. And our Kingdom.’
‘Except me,’ John laughed, and Sherlock shook his head. ‘You’re not normal, John. Not at all.’ John smiled at him and Sherlock felt that feeling in his chest again, the same feeling he got when he drunk hot coffee and it burnt his throat on the way down. It hurt, and it made his eyes water, but the taste far exceeded any discomfort.
He took another satisfied bite out of his muffin and glanced at his watch, wondering where Mike was. His best friend was generally quite punctual, and John had been five minutes late.
‘Thanks, Mike.’ Sherlock nodded, before he turned and sprinted out of the gates, Victor close behind.
‘Pleased meeting you,’ Mike said in heavily accented French. Molly didn't say anything, just nodding quickly before alternating between staring at the ground and then staring at Sherlock, who was clearly doing his best to ignore her.
James smiles, kisses him lightly, and leaves the room. Sherlock hears him go downstairs, hears the slam of the front door, and then watches as he breaks the blanket of snow.

'I need nobody to keep me in check, Lestrade,' Sherlock said, offended. 'I am perfectly able to function alone.'
‘Why is father so upset?’ Alec whispered to his twin sister. Izzy rolled her eyes. ‘Father thinks Uncle Sherlock is too young, for starters, and is also angry that he is not allowed to sit on the top table.’ With all the tact of a four-year-old girl, she patted her father’s hand. ‘There there.’
Sherlock’s mouth fell open.
Countless people call him a psychopath and John agrees with them: they’re right. He feels no guilt for what he was doing and he doesn't care about the pain he is inflicting: all that matters is the buzz. Nothing else, just that, and John will do whatever he has to do to reach it.
‘Says who?’ John asked. Sherlock shrugged. ‘The Daily mail. Perez Hilton. Forbes and Vogue. I am truly amazing.’ He flashed John that side-grin that he could already tell meant sarcasm and stopped. ‘We have arrived at my dwelling.’
It was like the ground had lifted out from under Sherlock’s feet. He dropped John’s hand and backed into the wall, staring into the dead eyes of the one person he had thought he would never, ever see again
‘So does Molly!’ Jenny sounded unnecessarily pleased as she turned to the girl, who Sherlock had completely forgotten was there. ‘Don’t you, Moll?’
my father?’
John broke the silence, frowning. ‘It’s just unfair, you know?’
‘Right,’ Irene said breezily. ‘Now that’s taken care of, I want this one.’ She took Molly’s arm and gently led her back to her armchair.
even try and contact James.
in school since their A levels had finished, most people were just coming in to get extra info on the Uni courses they were doing (this meant that Sherlock had spent most of the last three weeks sitting in the Chemistry classroom with Jim and three other students learning about the absolutely
‘Nothing major, do not fear.’
Then Sherlock was being ushered out of the door with a desperate backwards look at the Royal Box (
Sherlock smirked. ‘Of course not. Once there were younger, better siblings, everything the older child had was instantly worthless. Isn’t that so, Mycroft?’
Later, as they frame the photograph depicting Sherlock sprinting towards the falling photographer, Irene half-standing and Felix smirking in delight, Sherlock broaches what Mycroft said: what, for the majority of the day, has been playing on his life. ‘Marry me, Irene Adler.’
Sherlock’s hands, which had been on his shoulder and in his hair, moved suddenly downwards, hitching John’s leg up to his waist, pressing John further into the door and lifting him up, and John could hardly breathe at this point, as he stared into those dancing eyes and felt an unimaginable urge rising up inside him, up and up and up until he felt like he was going to explode with sheer
Sherlock had no idea what was going on. ‘John-‘
‘Um- which bit, exactly?’ Sherlock raised his eyebrows innocently.
‘Yeah,’ he had replied, ‘but why do our generation love them so much? Surely it would be the older ones who loved them more. They’re generally more interested in patriotic shit like that.’
Please comment and leave kudos :)
‘Edward.’ John supplied. He was sitting on the floor, watching Sherlock with a look he could only describe as pride on his face. ‘Prince Edward. They call him Mycroft.’
John wasn’t shaking. John wasn't crying, or hyperventilating, or shouting. John was just packing, calm, collected, folding his trousers the way he’d learned in the army (Sherlock complained, but he secretly liked having all of his clothes folded: it made him feel cared for, protected). The only clue that he wasn't just packing for a holiday was in his hands, clenched so tightly the veins were standing out, and his tight, tensed mouth.
‘James?’ Sherlock said, eyes blinking rapidly. ‘You-‘
A million times over. It’s me-‘
John snorted, blocked out his thoughts, and shook his head again. ‘Not this year, Sher.’
‘You know,’ John gasped as he pulled himself onto the jetty, ‘You sound English but you drop
Sherlock risked a laugh, not looking at John; he was clearly trying to distract his father’s advisor. ‘I’d watch your tone, William,’ he mimicked, before his face hardened and he smiled coldly at Morag. ‘I’d watch your tone with me, Morag. I do think that you’ve become a little too…freelance and I shall be having a word with my father if you do not start addressing me with the respect that the heir to his throne deserves.’ John smiled and Mycroft snorted; Archie let out a full-blown laugh, not really understanding.
It was a beautiful shot; it spiralled across the room and right into Morag’s left shoulder (John noticed numbly it was the exact place he had been shot). Sherlock jolted and turned; he took in the dying woman on the floor.
And then their lips touched, and Sherlock’s heart exploded into a million tiny, glowing stars.
Molly didn't answer. The hose was still spitting water into her oven.
He had left the classroom as Jim shouted, ‘I’ve also got twenty on you asking me via body parts so make me proud, darling!’
‘This wasn’t you,’ John said firmly. ‘Did you fire the bullet?’
‘Fine.’ Sherlock had replied, rolling his eyes. ‘You can’t tell anyone. Seriously.’
Sherlock Holmes had broken the person he had tried so, so hard not to break, and it would kill him.
Rosie looked at him in a way that seemed to say
Why had John run off without letting Sherlock explain himself? Why had John ignored all Sherlock’s attempts to make contact for the next four months?
Mycroft was edging towards the door but the crowd were still taking pictures and Sherlock made no effort to move, still waving and smiling in a way that John had never seen him smile before. He was different, somehow, different to how he’d been when he’d woken up, like all the bits that John loved were still there along with a new, carefree side to his personality.
Sherlock couldn’t tell him when he came back with the milk. He couldn’t tell him when they were playing Cluedo (Rosie was delighted when Sherlock threw the board at the wall). He couldn’t tell him at the Yard, not with Lestrade and Donovan there, and he couldn’t tell him when they were watching Jeremy Kyle, Rosie sat between them, staring in interest at the turn ups on the man’s jeans.
(See the end of the chapter for
John opened his eyes, eyebrows furrowed. ‘Sorry?’ He said, clearly assuming he had misheard Sherlock.
‘No, I’m not high.’ Sherlock glared at her. ‘The rehabilitation programme was far too much hassle for me to go through all over again.’
At three p.m, the Watson family gathered in the sitting room for the mandatory viewing, along with half of the world’s population. John been excited but apprehensive; there hadn’t been a mandatory viewing since just after Sherlock and John had broken up. It hadn’t been about them, of course, that hadn’t been public knowledge.
was from the playground: Jamie Nickson, one of the bullies, taunting little Billy Prescott because he’d been reading a book under a tree instead of playing football.
Sherlock glanced back at John, a look of apology in his eyes and said, ‘I lied. That is true. But I lied because I knew I couldn’t ever just be who I am, in this family. I wanted to remain under the radar, I didn’t want to be looked at like a freak, I didn’t want to be accused of being inhumane, so I lied. I said I was normal, heterosexual, and I was planning on keeping the facade for the rest of my life, but when I met John…’ Sherlock turned around and smiled at John so sweetly it melted his heart. ‘I knew I couldn't do that. And so I gave in to my so-called ‘unnatural’ urges and I have never been happier.’
Mycroft sent him a smile that was only slightly condescending. ‘I’m sorry, John, but-‘
John shook his head and said coldly, ‘It’s John. Have a nice life.’
‘Why Charlie?’ John asked. Sherlock snapped out of it and smirked. ‘She called me Sherly, when I was a child. I got annoyed, snapped, called her Charlie. I was only four, but my entire family were amazed. No one had ever spoken to her, like that. She’s the family matriarch, you know that, and to treat her with such disrespect…it was unheard of. But, instead of screaming at me, she just laughed. The nickname stuck.’
This was when John finally realised what was going on.
There was no way in hell Sherlock was going to ask him, he needed to do something big and brilliant so John would actually agree. He had a feeling John would dislike the body parts and the poem was apparently so shit it made Mike Stamford feel physically sick, so that was out as well. The cookies was too much of a hazard to redo (Sherlock wanted to be
combination.
He picked up his phone and dialled Irene’s number. As soon as she picked up, he said giddily, ‘Irene. I need something to wear for Prom and it needs to be black. According to my date, it accentuates my cheekbones.’
He simply had to accept it: no one would hire someone who couldn’t answer whether or not they were with their soulmate.
‘Oh,’ Jim said suddenly. ‘I’m afraid I might have told a little white lie when I introduced myself, John. Although most people call me Jim,
‘You are a Prince.’ John pointed out. Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘I am aware. It doesn’t mean I have to like it. I have met three people who have treated me like I’m a normal person. Three people who haven’t sucked up to me, or hated me instantly because of my…my status.’
John sits there for twenty-four hours, waiting, and he would have waited for another twenty-four, and then twenty-four after that, but the phone rings and he gets up, walks to the phone and answers.
suggestions.’
‘He likes her because she’s new and exciting,’ his mother comforted. ‘He’s known you for two years and you’ve Skyped almost every day for the last year…’
Sherlock looked at the ground, still smiling. ‘You think?’
‘Because,’ Sherlock whispered, hiccuping slightly, ‘You always know what I mean, regardless of the language I’m speaking.’
It had been the most miserable summer of John’s life.
Sherlock shrugged, because that couldn’t matter less to him now, not with John so close and so available and so brilliant, his and only his, right in front of him. ‘So what? I have you now.’
‘No, no, no,’ she said hastily. ‘John. Listen. You have nothing to worry about.’
‘I told you so.’ To his credit, he didn’t sound that smug. After another few seconds a tentative hand touched Sherlock’s arms and he said, ‘I’m sorry, love. I know you liked her.’
Sholto smiled at him approvingly before clapping him heartily on the shoulder. Excellent, son. MAGGOTS?’
‘Sorry, brother mine,’ Mycroft said stiffly. Sherlock raised his chin and smirked. ‘Sorry, fatty.’
If anything, it made her even more attractive to him.
Many had thought she should remain as the Queen when William turned eighteen and there had been public outcry from millions all over the world. However she had gracefully declined the offer to stay on the throne when her son offered it to her, retiring to Windsor with her younger children and assisting from afar.
‘Thanks for the mental image,’ Sherlock spat, ‘but you and Lestrade had been engaged in a relationship for almost a year. John and I have never kissed, we are not in a relationship, this is probably classed as our first date. Also, I’m
Sorry, Jim. ‘It’s different.’
The song was something Sherlock didn't know but it was obviously a slow song because River pulled Eleven closer to her and hooked her arms around his neck and the breakdancers moved off the floor respectfully. As John reached up and connected his hands behind Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock caught the eye of Mrs Hudson, his Physics teacher, who winked and turned off the lights-
Sherlock shot him a half-smirk that brightened up his features. ‘I am the most famous teenager in the world. Anyone would find this surreal’
‘Ditto,’ she laughed as she sat up. ‘Roger and Susan went to a couple’s massage and Yolanda, Peter and Wendy were playing tennis. Tennis! I decided to come here for some R and R.’
When John woke up the next morning, Sherlock was gone.
John turned on his heel, stomped to the shelf, and sat on his haunches to inspect the third shelf. ‘Fucking twatty little arrogant
‘That was AMAZING!’ John shouted the last word, punching Sherlock on the shoulder. ‘You’re a genius!’
John was talking about his A level exams, and Sherlock was just watching him with that look he got when he was actually, really happy. His eyes became lighter, crinkles formed around them and his mouth slid into a half-smile: it warmed John’s heart to know that he was the one who produced that look in Sherlock’s eyes.
He shook his head and shouted, ‘may I present….’ he paused for effect; Mycroft muttered, ‘dear god,’ behind him. Sherlock turned, winked, and yelled, ‘may I present Prince Edward Mycroft and Sir Gregory Thomas Lestrade!’ He had given Lestrade a knighthood at Mycroft’s assistance, though Lestrade had blushed and insisted he didn’t want one. Stupid Mycroft. It didn’t make sense that Lestrade would be knighted; he hadn’t done anything.
he wouldn't say anything was pretty or interesting or cool, even if it was, and he refused to do or say anything that he didn't think was masculine.
‘I haven’t been here for a long time,’ John said quietly, remembering what his father had said. ‘I’d forgotten how happy they all sounded. I’d forgotten about the laughter. Why are they so happy?’
Sherlock clambered over him, laying in the bed and pulling the covers over himself. ‘Thank you, Mr Watson. And I you.’
‘His priority,’ she finished. ‘You’re jealous. I don't know why, though, because every time I see you together Sherlock’s attention is 100% on you.’
Sherlock huffed. ‘Damn those delayed planes. I’ll send them hate mail.’
Why had John told himself it was the right decision, over and over, when the phone calls and text messages had stopped?
Apparently, most people called it ‘prom’. Sherlock preferred his title.
‘Beautiful, aren't they?’ Sherlock murmured, and John looked at his friend in shock. ‘You don't like any of this stuff, Sher. You didn't even know the Earth went round the sun: you think it’s stupid.’
He hadn’t thought he was capable of such emotional gymnastics, but the moment his mind computes that John Watson is in danger the betrayal is forgotten, the sadness is forgotten, the feeling of utter despair is forgotten. All that remains is a single phrase, playing over and over in his head-
‘I’m not doing that.’ Sherlock said calmly. ‘I’m not going to stop seeing John. I’m not going to stop being in a relationship with John.’
‘W-what?’ Sherlock mumbled, and John just shook his head. ‘I need to go.’
Mycroft had jumped at the opportunity to fire Sebastian and then become Sherlock’s advisor instead; according to his elder brother, it was a miracle that Sherlock hadn’t doomed their country already. Mycroft insisted that his younger brother was disorganised, didn’t care and was stupid as well, and that he needed someone like Mycroft to prevent entire collapse. Sherlock had huffed but reluctantly accepted it. John and Greg agreed that the brothers secretly loved working with each other. They protested that the other was stupid (Mycroft) or annoying (Sherlock) but they made an oddly good team. They had sorted out the immigrant issues, helped the refugees and introduced the most successful economic policy in the history of their kingdom.
‘Right.’ John said. He hadn’t thought Sherlock had ever dated anyone before, but it was still nice to know, even if he was looking oddly suspicious. Maybe it was just the question: Sherlock hated questions. ‘Right,’ he had said in a businesslike manner. ‘Good.’ Then, before Sherlock could reply, he had closed his eyes and put his mouth on his boyfriend’s dick.
John snorted, finally opening his eyes, and Sherlock was captivated instantly. People went on and on about Sherlock’s eyes, claiming they were mystical orbs or mysterious pools, but John’s were twice as stunning. They were a pure, simple blue that didn’t confuse you, or seem mysterious; they were plain and beautiful.
) for him, he’d run for the hills-
John laughed at his mother’s face but shut up. Jenny loved the royal family, like so many others, and adored occasions such as these. ‘We can see the whole family, together!’ Jenny squeaked as the curtains covering the doors to the balcony opened.
But, on the bright side, I left the war a hero, and they promised to leave me alone for a while. And that is how I have lived, for the last century. Under the radar, as free as I have ever been.’ He lets out a shaky breath and risks a look at John. ‘That is my story, John Watson.’
‘Get out.’ Sherlock said coldly, still slumped in his chair. ‘No one wants you here.’
‘Spit it out,’ Sherlock groaned, running his hand through his hair. ‘I only have three months until prom and if I don't ask him soon someone else will.’
Irene smiled right back, eyes narrowed. ‘I think not. Have you
John’s eyes were scanning his face and Sherlock felt uncomfortable because John and only John could deduce him adequately, and he didn’t want John to know how confused (had John even said yes?) he was because that seemed pathetic.
‘I know.’ The deep, husky voice came from slightly to the right and above him. ‘Disgusting, isn’t it?’
‘Ejaculate?’ Sherlock jolted backwards. ‘Why?’
‘I can’t use King John,’ Christopher moped, ‘and there is no way that I’m calling myself King Mycroft.’
Sherlock raised his right hand and gently stroked his blogger’s, flatmate’s, best friend’s cheek. ‘You don’t even need to ask,’ he whispered. ‘Always.’
Rosie batted her big blue eyes and flicked her reddish-brown hair behind her shoulder, glancing at Lestrade. ‘Oh, it’s fine. I’ve seen worse.’
‘Are you saying you like me more than your own brother? You’ve only known me half an hour,’ John said, amazed. Sherlock nodded. ‘Oh, yes. I hate Mycroft.’
world-‘
‘It is a problem,’ Irene snapped, chucking her shoe across the room, ‘Because she doesn't like me back.’
John shook his head. ‘Nah. Not gay.’ It was his mantra: he repeated it to himself almost every day. He’d probably done it more often since he became friends with Sherlock and started realising that men could have perfect bow lips, stunning blue-green eyes and curly black hair that almost begged to be pulled and touched and stroked-
‘Yeah, yeah,’ Mike said. ‘He went through a bit of a slut stage just after you left. Then he very briefly dated Mary, but that ended pretty quickly…he wants to go to UCL, study medicine. His dad wants him to go into the army, but Jonny doesn’t seem that convinced.’ Mike narrowed his eyes. ‘Why do you look angry?’
Sherlock sat down on the floor and stared around the cluttered, empty-without-John flat. He sat and waited, though he didn't know what for. He sat, and then he took out his phone.
‘Where’ve you been?’ John said firmly. Henry frowned, glancing at Jenny. ‘Did your mother not say anything to you?’
. Though you like
‘That’s because you stalk me.’ Sherlock snapped at his brother. ‘And I bet you told Trisha, you gossiping whale-‘
Sherlock hissed impatiently as he looked around, squinting into the darkness. ‘Someone is going to see us,
John backed away from the door and moved slowly to the sitting room. Carefully he opened the second draw down in his desk; quietly he removed his gun, sliding in the bullets. Gently he moved back to the door.
And Sherlock became interested.
Sherlock's heart swelled and he had to look down to hide his smile. He didn't know why he was smiling so much, he hadn't done much of it in the last few years, but with John, suddenly everything seemed worth being happy about.
‘I am
‘SHERLOCK!’
: who else will read it? It’s addressed to about a fortnight earlier and it’s obviously been there a while because it’s soggy and the envelope is growing mould. Arthur doesn't mind, though, and he reads it as he leans against Sherlock’s gravestone.
‘Oh god.’ Sherlock said, looking vaguely nauseous. ‘Oh my god, John.’
And, of course, the three most important words in the human language. Three words; eight letters; two pronouns and a verb.
Sherlock fixed John with a bored gaze. ‘Hello.’
Inexplicable tears welled in John’s eyes.
You could have heard a pin drop.
‘Three weeks,’ Harry replied. Mycroft nodded approvingly. ‘You’ll pick it up quickly. Read the schedule, attend whatever activities you like the look of, and ignore Sherlock.’ He nodded at the curly-haired boy again. ‘Like I said, he likes to show off.’
‘Shut
John gasped. Harry flinched. Henry murmured, ‘oh dear,’ and Jenny covered her mouth with her hand.
you.’
John slowly turned his head.
Sherlock.
It’s a long night with punching and stories and finally John leaving Sherlock outside a chip shop, looking so alone, but as he lies in bed next to his snoring fiancée John feels a spark of something that he’d almost forgotten. A spark that grows into an urge which grows into a longing, a longing for that rush, that buzz, that
‘It was.’ Sherlock said honestly. ‘I haven’t talked to anyone…normal for several years.’
Sherlock stared at his husband, completely overwhelmed. Part of him was angry that John would think that way about himself, part of him was worried about why John would say this, part of him was in disbelief over how John had described him, but absolutely every atom in him was screaming about how much he loved John in that moment. More than during that first dance, more than at their wedding, more than at the birth of their twin daughters, more than at the birth of their miracle baby boy.
Sherlock switched off for the rest of the announcements; he didn’t care about his father’s recycled speech, or the glazed eyes of the lucky people who had made it into the palace, or the hundreds of cameras aimed at him and his family. He was used to it, by now. It was irrelevant to him; censorship had been lifted over a hundred years previously and the royal family were the whole world’s favourite celebrities. Everything they did was documented and nothing was private; William couldn’t ban newspapers because it would look bad, and the royals hated to look bad.
‘It’s mine.’ John said, blushing slightly. ‘It’s my rugby hoodie…everyone in the first team at school gets one. I thought you…you might want it.’
‘Oh yeah,’ John remembered. ‘Man U v. Chelsea.’ He had been an avid Man U supporter all his life, though Greg liked Chelsea. It would be a great match, hopefully.
Sherlock smiles, because it might be impossible and they might be doomed already, but for now John Watson is his. ‘It doesn’t matter how, John. All that matters is that it’s only ever been you. Only you.’
with Archie for three hours.’
it,’ Sherlock said immediately, smiling crookedly at John. ‘So ha at you, Janine.’
who should never have saved his life with her own. She should have lived, she should have stayed, because Sherlock knows that the only thing worse than seeing John with someone else is seeing John heartbroken.
‘You must have been with loads of people,’ John murmurs, and Sherlock shakes his head. ‘Apart from you, I’ve had an actual relationship with three others.’
‘At least he lives in the palace,’ Harriet countered. ‘That’s gotta be a plus. Oh my god, this speech is fucking boring. I’d be close to throwing myself off the balcony if I was up there.’ John nodded in agreement. ‘Sherlock looks close to pitching himself off anyway, doesn't he.’ Sherlock had settled into an expression of extreme boredom, eyes glazed and staring into the distance. The commentators were loving it, making snide remarks about respect and stupid teenagers, but John was sympathising with Sherlock. They didn't even have chairs, for God’s sake.
‘Sherlock, I’m not kidding when I say there’s a good chance they’ll all faint. Especially when they find out I’m the mysterious boy you keep being seen with around London. Oh, god, Harry will never shut up about it,’ John fretted. ‘Why are-‘
‘Hmm.’ John mumbled. He didn’t want to say he agreed, just in case Harry decided to tell their mother. ‘Sometimes. Some of them.’
‘But-but-that’s absurd!’ John shook his head, sure Greg had misheard. ‘She was killed, Greg. We all learn about it at school. She was at Dreydon palace, in the West country. Sherlock and Mycroft were both in the palace, god knows where, and a man snuck in and shot her and then himself. Charles Magnusson, remember? They found his body in her room.’
Sherlock stopped laughing and raised his nose at his brother. ‘I haven’t destroyed it.’
William turned to his advisor, eyes flashing in the same way Sherlock’s did when he was really, really pissed. ‘You are an advisor, Morag. That is all. The decisions are left to me. Do not forget that.’
‘John,’ Jenny said quietly, ‘When the divorce papers came through, your
‘Same,’ Irene grinned, and she and Janine laughed. Mike muttered something about
because he was paranoid as well as fat, and to just leave his friends alone because it was weird and creepy.
‘Probably,’ Sherlock dismissed. ‘I’ll do exceptionally whether I know when they are or not.’
Irene fixed him with a mutinous glare. ‘You’ll see in a moment.’
‘Stop, drop, roll,’ Dante interrupted, and John looked disturbed as he put his son on the floor next to the girls. ‘He’s sixteen months old, Sherlock, and he knows what to do in the event of a fire. I
‘Now listen here,’ Anderson roared, dropping his severed hand. ‘I am perfectly intelligent in a completely
Sherlock’s knees were particularly ticklish.
John was still talking, he realised, and he interrupted whatever the other boy was saying with a, ‘what, sorry, I zoned.’
Sherlock watched until he was out of sight, and then turned, numb. ‘I’ve worked out why I didn’t want to leave,’ he whispered to himself and he walked towards security as an avalanche of feeling overcame him.
‘She’s not my girlfriend.’ Sherlock snapped back. Mycroft laughed incredulously. ‘You engage in regular sexual activities-‘
Sherlock tasted better, felt better, looked better than any of the girls he’s groped at the discos or hit on in town or even dated (Janette, for three weeks, and then Sarah for two months this year).
John fidgeted uncomfortably as Irene, Janine and Mike laughed. ‘Explain, then,’ Janine giggled.
Sherlock laughed uncomfortably. ‘Why are you even saying this?’ He teased. ‘You’re not meant to be telling me to ask people out. You’re my over-protective older brother. You have random men follow me to school every day-‘
Sherlock was right on the edge of the building, just a step from falling. His head was held high, his hands outstretched. He looked like a dark angel about to fall from heaven, John realised numbly.
No child shouldn’t know his father.
He wakes on the last day of August, 1586, and immediately knows that something has changed.
‘I never told you how I knew it was what you wanted,’ Sherlock said quietly. All his nerves were gone, he was just staring up at John, eyes vulnerable and unguarded for possibly the first time ever. ‘But it doesn’t matter, because I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I don’t know what brought you to my bookshop that day but I’m so, so glad it did, and the ninety nine pence that you owe me is more precious than all of the money, all of the jewels, all of the knowledge in the world.’ He looked up. ‘John Watson, will you marry me?’
James opened his eyes and Sherlock’s heart sank as he said, staring at Sherlock with the eyes of a dead man, ‘you broke my heart once, Sherlock Holmes, and if you break it again, if you choose him now, I swear to God I will kill you. I will kill you, and Daddy, and Mikey and Archie and everyone you care about. And I will save John Watson to last, Sherlock, and I will kill him in front of you and then leave you there, leave you with his cold body until you starve to death. If you choose him now, Sherlock, I will hunt you down and I will kill you and everyone you care about.’
“It matters to me too Sherlock, more than anything.
Sherlock was silent, his face blank.
“Years and years.”
If asked, he wouldn’t have been able to tell how long they kissed for. All he knew was that his chest felt so warm he thought he’d burst into flames and he never knew how delightfully solid John’s body was.
The clouds were growing heavier in the sky as the cafe door clanged shut behind him. A sharp, salted breeze blew along the road as John walked, L.G.’s stories swirling in his head. He could see why the town was a perfect setting for his tales; with the close-packed buildings, cobbled streets, and grey sky, it felt like a place shifty sailors and merfolk would hang about.
Sherlock blushed and nodded.
He heard the lid come off and John’s little noise of surprise at the red and yellow fabric inside. There was a rustle as John pulled the dragon out, and Sherlock fought the urge to twist his glove box in his hands.
John’s face fell.
“Yes, I- um, I wanted to give it to John for Christmas,” Sherlock said, pinching the bridge of his nose. He was sure his face was pink and was glad he hadn’t decided on a video call. His mother would never make fun of him, but she wasn’t above teasing.
“Oh no, definitely not!”
“I- alright. Fine,” he felt proud at how steady his voice sounded, or maybe he was just numb.
All of that was irrelevant know though; the case was solved and Sherlock wanted something to eat. Preferable something with lots of sauce. He was debating between Tika Masla or Roghan Josh when he noticed John wasn’t next to him anymore.
With a twist of his wrist, and a snap of his fingers, a little ball of fire bloomed in Sherlock’s palm. Carlotta’s eyes widened and unable to help himself Sherlock morphed the flame into a ballerina, her little point shoes twirling over his palm.
Deciding John needed to be distracted, he John to him and kissed him until the man went pliant in his arms.
Then it happened.
“I’m glad he doesn’t,” Carlotta said with a giggle, “His writing is fantastic.”
Good.
fit. His stomach was hard and his shoulders were broader. The muscles of his biceps and forearms flexed and bunched in a way that had Sherlock blinking rapidly as John held up his hands to be taped up before the fight.
Sherlock shivered hard and tried to pull John in for another kiss. The doctor resisted with ease and caught Sherlock’s wrists in one hand and pinned them easily behind his back. Sherlock arched in John’s grip, this was surpassing every single fantasy he’d ever had. His head swam at the sheer amount of strength he felt in John’s hold. John wasn’t hurting him by any means, but the amount of power he felt in the doctor’s grip had him hardening in his pants.
“I’ve wanted to do that for ages,” he said, gently playing with the curls at the base of Sherlock’s skull.
Sherlock swallowed and forced his mind to focus on John’s words. “I’ve kissed people, but not for the romance of it, for the work,” he said, gently running his hands up John’s back and enjoying his shiver.
“Oh dear, I forgot the biscuits!” Ajay cut in as if it was a disaster. “Be right back.”
The man was dressed in lose, dark blue boxing shorts and nothing else. He looked
Sherlock rolled his eyes, a dozen snarky replies on the tip of his tongue. He held them all back though, he
“I thought it would be awkward.”
John chuckled darkly, and nipped Sherlock’s ear lobe.
“Morning Sherlock. Happy Christmas!”
They’d barely made it, and John found himself over Sherlock and in him. He knew it was Sherlock’s first time, so he took it slow, and kept it sweet. Everything slowed down as they rocked together, their eyes locked and lips meeting for slow, deep kisses. John used every skill he had, his hands, lips and the motion of his hips to make Sherlock shake apart below him.
Sherlock stood in the entrance to the flat, dripping onto the carpet and chilled to the bone. His plans for announcing his feelings seemed ridiculous now. He doubted John would be in the mood after such a shit end to the day. Truth be told, seeing a bullet pass so close to a three-year-old’s head had been a kick in the bollocks to Sherlock’s romantic notions. What he really wanted was a hot shower and his bed.
Sherlock froze for the briefest of seconds before he was kissing John back. His arms slid around John’s waist, pulling the doctor closer and almost onto his lap. John’s hands gently cupped Sherlock’s face, guiding him as their mouths slid together, softly, softly.
Sherlock blinked at him.
Sherlock followed suit, looking around as he did so. The house was warm, and done up in cream, with bright accents of colour. The living room had been hastily cleaned, as expected from two career women, with rich cream walls and comfy looking, jewelled toned, furniture.
Twelve books stood on little plastic holders in front of an iridescent backdrop, and each and every one was mermaid themed. There were two children’s books, what looked like the last installment of a young adult series, and even colouring books. But what caught John’s eye was the oversized book that took up most of the left corner of the display.
“Really? Where does he get it?” Carlotta asked, eyes wide.
“And what makes you think you can?” John croaked, hating the way his voice wavered.
“Why would he be jealous? He’s a
John sighed, “What, are you going to carry me out then?”
John grinned and pulled Sherlock down to him until their lips met. It was
“Sherlock!” Ajay said, every inch the scandalized boyfriend, “Let the man at least finish his tea!”
“Wait! Harry!” John shouted, ignoring the people staring at him as they walked passed.
“When?” Sherlock asked whipping around.
Sherlock swallowed hard and began frantically scooping vegetables off the floor as John footsteps made their way up the stairs. Deciding the chicken was more embarrassing than the veggies, he dumped what little he’d picked up and grabbed the chicken off the floor. The blasted thing was still hot and with a hiss Sherlock let it splat back onto the tile. The damn thing left a sticky streak of sauce down the front of Sherlock’s shirt
John. He could say it while they were in a cab, or just watching telly, but he didn’t want that. The romantic part of Sherlock, a part of him that was deeply hidden but still very much there, wanted it to be special. Something that would give this moment the heralding it deserved.
There were eager smiles all around and Carlotta shot to her feet.
For two months, it was bliss. They were drunk on sex and on each other, snatching moments behind the school and at whoever’s house was empty, exploring what they liked and experimenting with new ways to get each other off.
“Sherlock,” he whispered, ducking his head and peering up into the man’s eyes, hidden by his fringe of hair. “Its fine you know? It’s all
It was awful. His father had refused to let him buy the things he needed to get him through it, insisting, as he swayed drunkenly, that no son of his would take it up the arse. John had suffered for three days, alone in his room, stuffing himself with fingers and frantically tugging at his cock. It was nothing like the heats he’d seen in porn. His mind didn’t go blank with lust, and he was very much aware of just how much he ached to be filled and pleasured. His hind-brain screamed for something, anything to kill the craving with in him, while his forebrain (with a voice far too much like his father’s) rebelled against the thought.
Sherlock shook his head and leaned down for anther kiss, but John gently stopped him.
John pulled back and smiled wickedly down at him, before he dove down for a kiss. John never spoke to him in these instances. He smiled and winked but he never said a word. Sherlock groaned again, as John took his nipple between his teeth and tugged. He worked his fist harder over his cock, thumbing the glands and flicking over the head.
“Please Sherlock,” John said, cringing as his voice wobbled.
“And things with Patrick aren’t...messy?” John said, licking his lips.
He’d mull everything over later, before bed.
John nodded and sat up, blinking hard. His panic was slowly receding and anger was taking over.
“I got her number, and she said to text her if you want to talk and possibly meet her pack.”
He nodded at Carlotta as the pack and John trooped out of the house. Sherlock knew enough of werewolves not to get offend at the request to stay away. During their transformation a wolf was at their most vulnerable, which is why non-wolf strangers weren’t welcome. He did turn the news on, but kept his sense cast out in case John needed him. As he felt the change take hold, Sherlock pulled his senses back and into himself. Soon a series of soft howl’s filled the air and Sherlock was out the back door.
“God, just look at you.” John growled, cupping Sherlock’s cheeks. “All pink and panting and I haven’t even touched you.”
“Y-yes John,” Sherlock managed to get out, his voice deep with need.
John swallowed hard, his own eyes glued to the murky grey sky visible from the window.
Sherlock nodded. Oh God, John hated it, he thought it was stupid.
“John, that was amazing!” he said, wrapping his arms tight around John’s back, not caring about the come smeared between them.
“Morning Lynn,” he said quietly.
“So Sherlock was telling me you were interested in joining the pack?” Devaki said, crossing her legs and taking a sip of her coffee.
“Please let me explain John!” Sherlock cut in, sounding desperate.
I hope everyone likes it! Please let me know what you think.
John limped down the road, grinding his teeth with every step. It was Sunday, the day he visited Sherlock’s grave. Ella had told him the visits needed to stop, that making a habit out of it wasn’t healthy. That had been his last appointment. As much as he knew he needed the sessions, he couldn’t stomach having his grief being picked apart any more. In the back of his mind he knew that Ella was probably right, but he would bloody well visit Sherlock if he wanted to and he didn’t see why he should feel guilty over it.
John felt himself bristle. It was so typical of an alpha, giving him orders as if he couldn’t take care of himself.
Two women and a man sat around the room, eating snacks and chatting softly. They all looked up expectantly as they entered.
That earned him an eyeroll and a haughty toss of hair. To John’s own disbelief, he heard himself chuckle. The man’s ears, curiously long and pointed, pricked at the sound.
Slowly, John leaned closer, his hands gently cradling Sherlock’s face. Sherlock shut his own eyes, and swallowed hard, his hands coming up to hook on John’s elbows. He felt the heat of John’s body as John’s lips got closer and closer- and then pressed against his forehead.
He and Sherlock shared a look before they darted out the door after Greg.
“No, we still have some time,” Sherlock said, knowing nothing of the sort. “Come in, come in.”
“Keep going John!” Sherlock bellowed, struggling to untangle his legs while glaring daggers at the woman, who met him glare for glare.
Clenching and stretching his fingers, John strode out of the office and through the restaurant. The cold January air hit him hard. Roughly zipping up his jacket he stalked down the pavement resisting the urge to scream. Sherlock lied to him for two years and then had the audacity to be angry at John. Grinding his teeth John turned toward home, it was a long walk, but he needed to think.
The gift was already Sherlock’s favourite and it was only his first.
“Oh. The Rathbone case was the one I missed wasn’t it? With the mad strangler?”
“I’m always up for a run,” Imran said, flashing sharper than usual teeth.
It was all real and he wasn’t going insane.
“And? You’ve been lying for two years don’t you think it’s time to stop?”
Sherlock flopped back onto the sofa. He’d been expecting John to have this sort of hang-up. Clearly he would have to spell it out for him, accidental revelations be damned.
His eyes were shut tight in pleasure, his lips parted and the muscles of his thighs rippling as he writhed under Sherlock’s touch. As he watched, John’s eyes fluttered open, darkening as he caught Sherlock’s gaze.
“I had one of those when I was younger,” John said with a smile, “It was my favourite for a while.”
No, nope. Definitely not. He was
Their shoes slapped loudly against the tile of the airport floors as they  dashed after Evelyn Finn, who was surprisingly quick for someone near 70. John was feeling decidedly unwell as he followed Sherlock’s flapping coat. His stomach was churning and black spots danced before his eyes. He ignored it and kept plowing ahead, if he knocked into more people than usual, well he’d just have to deal with bruised elbows tomorrow.
He worked his hand faster as John began to lick and suck at his neck, nipping hard on Sherlock’s ear lobe.
Sherlock threw a cursory glance at the amount and nodded sharply, tucking it into his jacket pocket. The cheque had given him an idea that might help him convince John his job at the clinic wasn’t necessary anymore.
Thank you to Ami for whipping this chapter into shape and making it flow!
It was perfect. So of course Sherlock had to ruin it.
“They knew how important you are to me,” Sherlock said, anger beginning to creep into his voice, “If they found out I was still alive they would have hurt you to get to me.”
He was wondering when Ajay would show up, they had a lot of work to do.
“For John?”
John grinned, his teeth looking a touch sharper. “As you wish.”
Lestrade’s eyebrows rose. “
Straightening up, John rubbed a knuckle over his eyes and looked around. It had gone afternoon, the sun shining murkily from behind the clouds. He’d been reading for well over two hours! L.G. was still on the island and slowly beginning to trust the creature. It was a fantastic read for more than one reason. First, this L.G. was a very talented writer. Secondly, and more importantly, the story made John one hundred percent positive it had been a normal man on the beach, not some deep sea creature.
He leaned forward and did just that, delivering a sharp nip to Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock whimpered in John’s arms, each flex of John’s tendons against his trapped wrists making him shiver.
John was soon engrossed as he read the tale of L.G. getting washed overboard while he was on a tuna boat and being rescued by one the ‘deep people’, who’d taken him to an island. L.G. appeared to be both fascinated and horrified by the creature, noting it’s ‘inhumanly beautiful face’ and ‘long needle like teeth’.  John got so lost in it that his coffee was cold by the time he took another sip.
This case was a
There was another round of helloing and finally everyone was settled into chairs with cups of tea.
It was a bit disconcerting with the teeth, but the sound itself was a rich , pleasant rumble.
A strained silence fell and, for the first time since he’d returned, Sherlock found himself wishing John would leave. He had work to do, work that John couldn’t and most likely wouldn’t want to be part of.
Sherlock smiled back, he couldn’t help it. “Yeah. I named him spots. Mycroft was so disappointed at the lack of creativity.”
Aashriya nodded and swallowed. “I’ll get right to the point. My girlfriend is ill, and she keeps getting sicker, and I’m beginning to suspect foul play.”
Just as Sherlock was about to drop to his knees before John, the doctor stopped him again. Sherlock looked up at him in confusion, his mind spinning with lust.
Ajay snorted and took a sip of tea. “Do you really think Rosemond is the type of woman who tolerates
Oh was he kidding. He’d gotten so lost in the mess of twists and turns and new suspects that he was more than content to take a backseat and go where Sherlock pointed them.
“Back at the flat yes?” John said smiling.
“It’s fine really,” John said, trying to smile, though it must not have been successful considering the look on her face.
There were the soft sounds of footsteps over tile and then Sherlock felt the air move as John knelt in front of him.
John’s job was important to him, despite how boring John complained it was. He
John’s smile turned sheepish, raising a hand to scratch the back of his neck, “Well, actually, I was hoping to get an opportunity to use what I learnt on a case. As a surprise I guess.”
John nodded, unable to find his voice. Sherlock’s eyes continued to roam over his face, his thumb slowly sweeping over John’s cheek. At the delicate gesture, John’s breath caught and Sherlock’s eyes locked onto his, widening in surprise when he noticed what he was doing. He immediately ripped his hands away from John’s face, his eyes dropping to the floor.
Sherlock fingers tightened ever so slightly on his shoulders. “What?”
Here was the problem; Sherlock Holmes was completely and irrevocably in love with John Watson, and he now he had to plan the perfect way to tell him.
Sherlock whimpered and leaned in for a kiss, his hands sliding around John’s trim waist. John kissed him deeply, his tongue sliding firmly into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock gasped against John’s mouth, as the doctor pressed against him. The water from John’s body soaked into Sherlock’s shirt, making the silk cling deliciously to his skin. John pressed one more hard kiss to Sherlock’s lips before pulling back.
He took a deep breath. “I need your advice.”
“Newspapers.”
“Sherlock,” John said slowly, still clearly trying to make sense of what he was seeing. “Were you trying to cook?”
It felt
Sherlock’s lips clamped over his teeth and his face turned to stone. He edged away and John was suddenly filled with panic.
He had nothing against omegas, he just didn’t want to
John sat up with a gasp, the scream lodged in his throat. For one awful moment, he couldn’t breathe, and sat gasping hard on his tiny bed.
“Can I see you again?” he called, flicking his eyes been Sherlock and the porch door.
“It’s not for me,” Sherlock interrupted, not wanting to wander down memory lane. “It’s- it’s for John.”
He tugged the coat down Sherlock’s arms, the detective straightening his arms to help, and then draped it over the banister in the hallway to dry.
“We were partners!” John shouted, jumping to his feet, “All this explanation about Moriarty doesn’t explain why you couldn’t
There was another pause. If it were anyone else but his mother, Sherlock would have had a barbed quip at the ready to defend himself.
God gag him, he was an idiot.
Sherlock scrabbled backward and pressed himself against the alley wall as John tackled Minchel with ease. He smoothly avoided a punch, grabbed Minchel’s wrist and gave it a nasty twist. John yanked him forward and jabbed his knee hard into the other man’s ribs with a crack. Minchel roared in pain, and buckled to the ground. John hurriedly flipped him onto his front and pinned him down.
“Aashriya.”
Thank you to Ami for being an amazing beta!
Buckle up everyone! Thank you to Ami for being an amazing beta!
Just like that Sherlock was suffused with lust once more.
“Merry Christmas, John,” Sherlock said, grinning.
The detective opened his mouth to say, well he wasn’t quite sure what, but then John was leaning forward and his lips pressed softly over Sherlock’s.
John scowled at Nathan’s back as he opened the ambulance doors.
Fuck.
John kept sneaking looks at him, his brow furrowed. Suddenly, his expression cleared.
“The cat hairs on the bottom of your sari. A Bombay I’d guess.”
Mike grinned at him and winked, “It’s only the best when you’re with me, John.”
“Ah, I see.” Lestrade said, grinning at the look on Sherlock’s face. “Well…I’ve never been much good at the romantic stuff, but I would say keep it simple. You can’t go wrong with a nice dinner.”
He cracked open his menu, though he knew he’d order the same thing he always did. The food arrived quickly and John ate slowly, staring at his plate and trying not to think too hard about Sherlock. He was still trying to reach a middle ground where he thought enough about him that he wouldn’t forget anything, but not so much that he’d break down in public. Having that happen once was enough.
“I saw you, you great berk. Up on the balcony like the bloody Phantom of the Opera. Did you enjoy the match?”
“I’m John,” John said, smiling his most charming smile.
“Would you and your wife like to come for drinks at ours tomorrow?” Sherlock asked.
“I’m as well as can be. Your father’s building new draws for the pantry and I’ve been reviewing Ph.D. proposals. What do you need?”
Sherlock held his glare for a moment longer before turning his gaze to just over Greg’s shoulder.
“C’mere Sherlock,” he said, pulling the detective to sit on the edge of his bed. He was glad the chair next to his bed was stolen by the next bed’s visitor. He was also glad said visitor had shut the curtain between the beds tight.
“No it wasn’t that! I-,” Sherlock cried, looking up at John with wide eyes.
“So this was the plan then. A romantic dinner, then a love confession.” John said, sitting back on Sherlock’s thighs.
Shaking the thought from his head, Sherlock jumped out of bed and headed for the shower. He had several interesting body parts waiting for him at the morgue and no time for his thoughts to get derailed by John’s body. Again.
Before Sherlock was quite sure what was happening, he found himself on his back on the bed, with a grinning John Watson on top of him.
“He had one like it when he was small, and it would mean a lot to him to have another I think.”
When he carefully pulled away, Sherlock was smiling softly, his eyes glowing. Unable to help himself, John stretched higher and planted a kiss on Sherlock’s nose. The detective blinked at him for a moment before chuckling softly and pressing a kiss to John’s cheek.
John gasped and the man turned to face him, looking startled. Their eyes met for a breath before he dove back underwater.
“I barely make page six,” Sherlock said dryly, giving Ajay’s wasit what he hoped was a playful squeeze.
Sherlock hugged him back, his throat feeling just the tiniest bit tight. The privacy spell kept the moment between the two of them, warm and snug in the bustling café.
It was John, but John as Sherlock had never seen him.
John giggled and finally took a proper bite of toast. A small victory, but Sherlock would take it.
John pulled back and slid up Sherlock’s body. “Tell me what you need, love.”
“Sherlock! Hello dear, how are you?”
Licking his lips, John stood up and crossed over to him. He crouched down between the detective’s knees and peered at him.
. Sherlock was dead.
Aashriya pulled back, and giving him a kind look, she slid into the cab.
Sherlock seemed to be having a harder time than John at controlling himself. He staggered into the flat, keeping his body turned to John, his lips slightly parted and eyes wide.
“Sensitive?” A hard suck before John pulled back, his mouth tantalizing close to Sherlock’s chest. Their eyes locked and Sherlock struggled to find his voice. Clearly John wasn’t going to continue until he answered.
Swallowing, he hustled into his room, he needed to commit those sounds to his mind palace as quickly as possible.
“Begin then” he said, taking a gulp from the glass.
John grinned at her and leaned closer in a conspiring manner, “You know, in The Silver Band, it’s not the shoulder the minister gets he arrow in.”
Sherlock swallowed and looked down at his lap again. This was- this was too much. He couldn’t say it now, there wasn’t any cover, nothing to hide behind. John’s hands lightly slid over his own, stopping their twisting and holding them gently. Sherlock looked up at John in surprise, his eyes wide and ever so slightly wet.
That explained the foreign smell, sweatiness and elation. Sherlock felt relief rush through him. John wasn’t seeing someone else, which meant Sherlock still had a chance. For once he was glad he’d been wrong.
Sherlock smiled. His mother was never one for small talk. Something Sherlock both appreciated and inherited from her.
Aashriya shot Harry a look, her mouth tightening slightly. “I don’t think now is the best time as-
There it was.
He smiled as best as he could as he was lead to his table, a booth tucked into the back of the restaurant where people hardly ever sat. It was perfect for John to celebrate his love and hide his grief. He’d had their first anniversary, after
“Well his jealousy made it fairly obvious,” Ajay said, rolling his eyes.
Sherlock nodded, his smile at the DI feeling more natural as he strode out of the office.
“Doctor. Army doctor. What sort of reaction do you normally get?”
He rolled onto his side and stared blankly at the wall of the bedsit. He wished, with an awful, bone deep ache, that he’d told Sherlock he loved him. Maybe that would have stopped him from jumping, maybe it would have made Sherlock come to John instead of going up onto the roof, maybe it would have-
If Ajay would ever get here.
“John I- I was-
,” Harry said, her voice gentle. “If I ever saw that prick I’d punch him in the face, not take him out for
“So, um Patrick. What do you do?” John asked, turning a false smile to Ajay.
John had responsibilities outside of The Work, and he knew how much being a good employee meant to John. He
“Well, yes. You said you missed having a pack. This is your chance to get one.” Sherlock couldn’t understand why John looked so scandalized. He was getting what he wanted.
It had been two weeks. Two weeks since John had gone to
“I wanted to tell you- I wanted to tell you what I really meant to say on the tarmac.”
Behind John’s chair, Ajay came through from the kitchen holding a packet of biscuits. He brushed his hand along John’s coat again and Sherlock caught a flash of silver. Sherlock turned back to John before the man could notice where he was looking.
, John had kissed his
John’s grin threatened to make his face crack.
“I met another wolf.”
At any other time the sight of Sherlock’s long legs knotted up the bag strap would have sent John into hysterics while he helped the man untangle himself. Now, he felt too sick to muster up the energy to laugh. Instead he simply nodded and darted after the suspect, well as much as he could dart. It was more of a glorified stagger than anything.
“Lift up love,” he said, tapping Sherlock’s hip. “Lube?” he asked, after tucking the pillow under the detective.
“I’m fine…how are you?”
Sherlock still had his back to John, his shoulders ridged and arm extended in John’s hold.
. John felt his spine snap straight. No alphas, that was his rule. Aashriya’s brow furrowed slightly, obviously wondering what caused the change.
“What made you choose the Eton route?” Sherlock asked.
Finally, with one sinful undulation of John’s tongue and a stroke to his prostate Sherlock came. The world crashed and burned around his ears as he came down John throat. Pleasure shot through his limbs as he shouted John’s name. It lasted longer than any of his solo orgasms, the pleasure and satisfaction crashing over him in waves that went on and on. He thought he would die from the sheer amount of pleasure coursing through him.
Twenty minutes later John was seated with that overpriced coffee and his mermaid book in a cozy little coffee shop around the corner. The shop was nearly empty at this time of day so John was able to get a seat by the windows that made up the front wall of the building.
“It’s getting a little late. Do we still want a run?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at the move. He saw what Ajay had really done of course, he just didn’t know why.
“I love you,” John said quietly, when they’d parted again.
The detective slowly complied, his eyes still downcast. John took Sherlock’s hands in his own, giving them a squeeze and chuckling when he realized the man still had only one glove on.
As he showered he thought about Anthony Hopkins, the man Ajay said Mary had fucked over. If the man was still in the country, or still alive for that matter, Sherlock wanted to meet him. He hadn’t been able to find anything on him online, no social media, death records or anything.
The title was superimposed over a picture of a beach, clearly taken a few decades ago. The shot they’d used made the hair on the back of John’s neck stand up. It was the same beach he’d ran across last night. He was certain of it. The same oddly shaped rock was there in the picture, just to the right of the title.
“Of course.” Lestrade said, giving them both a knowing look. “You two will come in tomorrow to give your statements okay?”
“Yeah?”
“I could cast my senses while we take walks.”
The door to 221 slammed shut. John was back from this
However, as much as he liked Aashriya, he didn’t want to talk about what happened, with anyone.
“Before- long before that John.”
John blinked at him a moment before his eyes brightened and a huge grin began to spread over his face.
“The magic wouldn’t
When they parted, John sat back smiling wide. The dragon rolled between them, squished from where it had been pressed between their bodies. John picked it up and carefully smoothened the wings into place.
Sherlock blinked in fringed confusion, “What?”
, which was somehow worse in Sherlock’s mind.
He skidded around the corner of the ally, breathing hard, and surveyed the space behind the warehouse. He and John were tracking a drug smuggler, turned human trafficker, named Peter Minchel. The man had been responsible for the kidnapping of dozens of women. They had finally made a break in the case yesterday when Sherlock had figured out where the ladies were kept before they were sent overseas. They’d lain a trap for Minchel at the warehouse and the idiot had done a runner.
John’s own eyes felt suspiciously prickly weeks later, as he watched her family’s car drive away. He and Aashriya hadn’t been in love with each other (something they both knew), but she’d been the first positive alpha influence in his life. She’d helped him learn to accept himself, which was something he’d forever be grateful to her for.
John pulled the laptop closer, his eyes dancing, “So it says here we’ll need two forms of ID and we’ll have to go to the bank in person to complete the paper work.”
. Sherlock thought his plan of showing John a relationship with him would be more enjoyable than whatever he was up to with
her number. Think of it as networking.”
“You cast your senses for one, didn’t you?”
“Yes, I’d like that,” John said, turning to Sherlock and grinning.
Devaki nodded in understanding. “The pack is always open to new members, and they’d be happy to meet you.”
He slammed the door on that train of thought before it could form fully. He had John’s friendship, that should be enough, right? Right.
Sherlock nodded to her and she nodded back, one magical being to another. Sherlock raised a hand and beckoned her over. It was a pedestrian gesture, one that made him wince, but it was for John. The woman’s eyebrows knitted, but she started walking over to him. Sherlock took a deep breath and entered the grounds to meet her, sticking close to the car park where there was no one around. She definitely had to be a wolf, no human woman would meet a strange man in car park. Not unless they had wolf strength.
He caught Sherlock’s eye as Nathan tightened a pressure cuff around his bicep. The detective was staring at him, his eye narrowed and lower lip caught between his teeth. It was the most worried John had seen him in a while and he couldn’t help but be touched that it was over him.
“Is it- You have to tell me-is it Sherlock?” John asked, his voice shaking.
Christmas morning dawned cold and clear. Sherlock was up early, teeth brushed and face washed, but still in his pajamas. It felt wrong to get dressed on Christmas. He heard the clink of teacups and happily went into the kitchen. Just as he hoped, a sleep rumpled John was at the counter waiting for the kettle to boil. John turned to him and smiled brightly. That, coupled with way his hair was sticking up, made Sherlock’s heart do something funny in his chest.
Sherlock looked startled, then to John’s enormous surprise, he
“Hey Sherlock.”
John grinned at him, “The same! Did yours have little black spots on the tail?”
. It was a sweet kiss yes, but it wasn’t what Sherlock wanted. He opened his mouth to protest when John cut him off.
Shakily, Sherlock pushed himself onto his forearms and knees, John’s hands helping him into position. Once John was satisfied he was properly positioned, he spread Sherlock’s cheeks again and dove back in. Soon, he was pressing the tip of his tongue against Sherlock’s loosened muscle, wiggling his way inside. Sherlock blurrily raised his head from where it hung between his shoulders. He felt practically insensate with pleasure, his mind filled to the brim with
“John, you have to understand that for me this- this. It’s more than just- it
Then, came the devastating news. Aashriya’s father had gotten a job in Wales, and the entire family would be moving before the end of year. Aashriya cried as she told him and John held her and stroked her hair, giving a her a sweet kiss to make her feel better. Soon the kisses turned into more, and he found himself under her as she rode him slowly. Their eyes locked the entire time.
Sherlock was smiling as he approached, which was odd considering he hated missing the conclusion of a case. John grinned weakly back and blinked hard. He suddenly felt very dizzy.
“I don’t think I’ll be able to look at you with out wanting to kiss you for a long, long time Sherlock Holmes.”
She strode to join the queue, her cheeks red.
It was either tell John or go mad. And his mind was the one thing he was not willing to sacrifice. It was settled then, he’d do it.
Greg’s tone was teasing, and not the least bit mocking, but Sherlock’s nerves were frayed enough as it was.
Sherlock allowed himself to smile slightly, sharing a look with John, before turning back to Lestrade.
“No no, it’s fine,” Ajay said with an airy laugh, “Private accountant yes. You’re still with the clinic?”
John rolled over in bed, his eyes feeling gritty from lack of sleep. It had been three days since Sherlock’s return and John’s phone hadn’t stopping buzzing for more than ten minutes at a time. The detective had kept calling at first, but John couldn’t bring himself to answer. Sherlock had stuck to texts since yesterday.
Sherlock’s glare intensified as Lestrade grinned.
God, that was inadequate. Why could he never express himself in this area. In all other facets he was perfectly articulate, then here, when it mattered more than anything, his words failed him.
John swallowed hard, pinching the bridge of his nose between two fingers.
John moaned against his lips and coaxed Sherlock’s tongue into his mouth prompting Sherlock to do some moaning of his own as John lightly sucked on the muscle. Sherlock panted hard as John tipped his head further to the side to deepen the kiss. Just when Sherlock was contemplating begging John to touch him more, the doctor pulled away.
Intellectually, he knew he could just
Sherlock swallowed and nodded. John did have a point.
“Is that the not-a-client?” John called from the kitchen, “Would they like tea?”
“Jesus Johnny, it’s not for a social call. Lord knows we’re both pants at those!” Harry said, her laugh crossed between genuine amusement and bitterness.
“Good morning. Mr Lestrade, was it?”
Things are explained.
Sherlock’s cheeks heated and he began to pant as pleasure coiled low in his belly.
“I’ll,” he gulped at what he was about to say, “I’ll talk to Sherlock and see if he’ll help. I’m sure he will.” John added, when he saw the look on Aashriya’s face. “Don’t worry Ash, we’ll help you,” he said, giving her hand a squeeze.
The crime scene was a mess. A plastic tent had been set up over Mrs. Argos’ body in a pitiful attempt to preserve evidence. The woman’s body lay face down in the mud, her blood mixing with the rain water. Her powder blue dress was caked with mud when they rolled her over, but the evidence was clear. She’d been hit over the head and had her throat slit. The foot prints and the gardening tool used to hit her proved Victor had indeed killed her. Now, it was on to finding the child.
“Well if it isn’t Sherlock fucking Holmes,” Minchel sneered, “I should be honored.”
He walked over to the stone and patted a corner of it gently.
“….tell someone important.....”The DI’s brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of Sherlock’s words. Sherlock could practically here the click when he put it all together.
There was a beat of awkward silence. The kind that was becoming the norm of late.
“I’ll walk you out,” Sherlock said, keeping his voice smooth.
“Morning,” the woman behind the counter said, smiling kindly at him.
“Thank you for this Sherlock. It means a lot.”
Sherlock dried off, styled his hair and dressed in his favourite sapphire blue suit with a crisp white shirt. Feeling ready for battle he returned to the living room.
“It wasn’t too dangerous for
Behind the shut bathroom door, Sherlock turned on the shower and adjusted the spray. As it warmed up he began to undress. Sliding his suit jacket off, he couldn’t help but wonder how it would feel to have John undressing him. To have John working open the buttons of his shirt as Sherlock was right now. John’s fingers would lightly stroke each bit of bared skin, making Sherlock shiver, and shiver he did, standing all alone in the bathroom.
