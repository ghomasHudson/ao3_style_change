“We,” Sherlock struggled to keep his heart from beating so forcefully, “We don’t hang out. I can’t be avoiding you if we don’t have an established pattern of contact.”
Mary hummed with satisfaction. “That was excellent. Oh, I can still feel it. Give John a good snog for me, will you Sherlock? He likes that sort of thing after he comes.”
A deep breath from John and words were no longer necessary. He placed his hands flat on Sherlock's chest and dragged them down over his ribs, then the muscles of his stomach. Every inch felt like fire. He wondered through his haze of arousal if he was allowed to kiss and touch John like Mary had to him.
An extra percussion part made an entrance when Jawn fumbled with and dropped his keys outside, cursing as he stooped to pluck them from a puddle on the front step. Sharlock sighed and made his way to the door, not missing a note. Gladstone's droopy eyebrows wrinkled up when Sharlock nudged the door open with his foot, an impressive kick for his age. The wood of the door connecting with the railing outside marked the end to the movement, perfectly coinciding with a triumphant final chord on Sharlock's part.
Three days was far too long to stew about the possibilities of their next encounter. Sherlock tried to make a lengthy list of limits to show he had put thought into it, but ended up crossing out most of them after realizing that he was completely comfortable with the acts if John was the one doing them. In fact, thinking over the sheer potential was getting him ruffled, more so than he’d planned. He stared at the list and scanned down the items he had crossed off.
"You'd best listen to him, John," Sherlock suggested. He had a faint smile, but the lines by his eyes were tight. He positioned himself between Jawn and John when he returned the camera, feeling a little protective of his present-day blogger.
The sensation pulsed through his whole being, leaving him tingly and raw. He felt the rush of air on his lips that must have been his own loud, gasping breaths. Everything was happening in calm clarity as John slowed his movements. It was strangely peacefully, shattering apart and watching the pieces fall around him. He hoped that if he were to be gradually reassembled, John would be the one to do it.
Sherlock lay boneless as John mopped up the ejaculate from stomachs and hands. His muscles twitched with over sensitivity at the dildo being removed, though John was especially careful pulling it out.
Sherlock pulled off slowly, reveling in the feel of John’s length dragging over his lower lip. John’s hands gripped the bedsheets in his peripheral vision. Sherlock slumped down, an awkward maneuver with his hands immobilized. He let his eyes flutter shut and inhaled the scent at the base of John’s cock.
John must have finished just after Sherlock because the three of them were collapsed in a pile when Sherlock came back to a state of rational thought.
“I don’t mind.”
“What? What will everyone do? Since when do you care about ‘everyone’?”
“I… apologise that I have to ask this of you. But it is important. And I hope you will agree to do it.”
“Who taught you that, by the way?” Mycroft’s gaze momentarily flickered towards his abdomen and the blood-soaked scarf. Sherlock didn’t even know what to think about this sudden dawn of chit-chatting tone and couldn’t help the desperate laugh that escaped him and the hint of a smile that concurred with thinking about John.
John gave him a calculating look before turning his attention to the photo. It was in sepia, and not the edited in kind. The paper it was printed on was modern, though, so it must be a scan of an old photo.
“Really,” Sherlock said, not sure where this was going.
“What about the desert, Sherlock?” Mary reminded him.
John reached behind Sherlock for two packages of condoms on the nightstand. He handed one off to his wife.
“Sherlock, what is this recent obsession about?”
Sherlock almost mirrored her actions, gave her a quick nod, took breath as if he wanted to add something but mid-thought decided not to do it and without any further word headed out of the room, passing by Molly on his way.
So, somehow Sherlock couldn’t even blame John for assuming he’d gotten himself onto another trip. There was no other way to interpret the signs, with this one vital piece of information missing, and deep down Sherlock had known that everyone would assume that this was what’s wrong with him.
“Molly,” She heard a very faint voice saying as Sherlock started to approach her, stepping into the light cone cast by the lamps in the hall outside the door, “I think I’m going to die.”
Sherlock stopped in the middle of his movement and faltered. That was not the reaction John had expected, what had he said now?
And he headed through the door at the other end of the hall.
Could they all simply just… stop?
“No, but it’s also not
Molly’s eyes starting to water, her lips were trembling, so she bit them and just nodded obediently.
Sherlock Holmes at St Bart’s, this hasn’t been a frequent combination lately. Not after he had come back. Molly always had tried to push aside the thoughts that maybe this had to do something with her, or their – in lack of a better word – difficult relationship. They were friends, yes, close, but not in a seeing-each-other-every-day-way or in a knowing-what-the-other-one-is-up-to-at-this-very-moment-way. Close in a if-you-need-someone-I’m-there-for-you-way, and it wouldn’t matter if they had spoken to each other for the last time yesterday or half a year ago. Unconditional trust. And this was very mutual.
What the hell are they implying?

She could see the gulp forming in Sherlock’s throat, he bit his lip, pondered for a moment, but only to buy himself some time, to steel himself for what he surely had practised to say over and over again before he even came to her.
Defeated.
“I said, ‘Gold or silver?’ I know you don’t have too many accessoires to begin with, let alone jewelry, and I know the few rings and necklaces you already have are gold, but I was wondering if you really
"Of corse you do," Jawn pulled him over to the couch where they were quickly joined by Gladstone. There wasn't a fire going, Sharlock still opted for Bunsen Burners over fireplaces, but Jawn liked to think that Mrs. Hudson would have approved all the same. "For what we have, I wouldn't change a thing," he decided. Sharlock clasped their hands to together in agreement.
“Tease him more, Sherlock,” Mary instructed. “Use that clever tongue.”
Jawn looked rather smug.
“Research for the figure unit,” Sherlock lied.
John was suddenly having a difficult time forming words. “Alright. Um, would you mind if we… uh. If you want to, we could.” He coughed and floundered his hands.
The clack of the lube being opening was obscenely loud in the breath of silence that followed. John covered his fingers but didn’t touch him. Sherlock gulped down air, realizing that both John and Mary were waiting for him to begin.
"Found that when we were- yes, well," Jawn stopped abruptly. The two others looked up from the photo.
“Shush, no fun for you, Mr. Watson,” the teacher scolded him half-heartedly. “This is your detention, remember.”
If Sherlock's pants weren't already in pile with his other clothes, he wouldn't have minded the same treatment. What a lucky couple they were, the Watsons.
“Don’t let him come yet, darling,” Mary said. “We’ve still got-”
Jawn shooed the idea anyway with a wave of his hand, gold band glinting. "Reawakened an old habit," he explained.
John seemed to reach some decision. He stepped into Sherlock’s space, made the air leave the room with one look into his eyes. “Stay,” he whispered. “Mary gave us her blessing. Let me be greedy for just one more night.”
Molly’s friends weren’t all bad. They were loud, but they didn’t force Sherlock into much of the small talk he dreaded. One of them (George?) even offered to explain the basics of rugby when Sherlock admitted he knew almost nothing about how it was played. He was midway through the point system when the speakers crackled to life and the crowd cheered too loudly to continue the conversation. The cluster of them turned to face the field and joined in on the noise making. Even quiet Molly cupped her hands to her face like a megaphone to holler when the home team was announced.
"I'm not gay!" John protested. His face was red and his arm shook slightly as he wiped his mouth.
John did as he was told, tugging Sherlock closer to hoist one leg over his shoulder and stretch the other down the expanse of the bed, pivoting his whole body toward the camera. Sherlock felt a pressure at his wrists and remembered the restraints. Without realizing it, he’d stayed exactly where John had put him earlier, rendering the ribbons a mere formality.
Laughing with John was like slipping into something more comfortable. He felt some of the nervousness and tension between them slip away, enough to go on to the next matter of importance.
John gave him a hard look.
Jawn sighed. "That's what I'm here to convince you otherwise."
Back at his seat, Sherlock added a sketch of Mike for variety. It was easier to do than he’d thought. Mike was taller than John and had a bit more muscle; his movements were more straightforward, which had a lot to do with his position on the field. It wasn't as thrilling as drawing John, but there was a simpleness to it that was a pleasant break from all the excitement.
Mary chuckled. "Alright. Ask me."
When John wasn’t there, or more accurately, when Sherlock had left, he’d felt it: the grating absence of something very dear. Sherlock wanted to find it again, he wanted to catch it and hold it close for as long as he could. With John no longer in the flat, it was more elusive, but he was catching glimpses of it more and more frequently. Enough for him to hope.
Sherlock frowned. “I don’t understand.”
“Yes.”
"Come in, Mrs. Hudson," a bored voice said within the flat. Some awkward position of the sofa, judging by the strain in his tone.
“Hm?”
“What?” Sherlock asked. He scrunched his eyebrows together trying to think if there was some sort of safeword etiquette he’d overlooked. Or maybe his choice wasn’t serious enough? Should he have gone with ‘Mycroft’ after all?
"Danger," Sherlock answered for him. "You were being slow," he said in response to John's peeved expression.
“Who can give it to you?”
The call came on an ordinary Thursday evening. If it was anyone else, Sherlock wouldn't have answered.
John cleared his throat before explaining. “She wants you there with me when she calls, and, uh, she wants to tell us what to do. Together.”
A hesitant touch settled on Sherlock’s side just above his hip and he realized with a jolt that it was John’s hand. John liked what he was doing, he thought with a thrill. It was enough to summon the bravery to skim his teeth along the spot at the base of John’s neck before pulling away.
“Well,” John said, standing on the top step to leave, but not quite ready to descend. “See you soon, then.”
Mary smiled. "Excellent. On your knees, then."
Sherlock’s heart did a funny little jump in his chest. It wasn’t entirely unpleasant.
“Ah,” Sherlock said awkwardly. After that exchange they all but lapsed into silence.
"Sure," John answered, ready to list of the names of his longest-lasting girlfriends.
“It’s fine, John.” Sherlock whipped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Really, it is.”
“John,” said Sherlock. “You’re being presumptuous.”
“Mary,” John pleaded.
Hope you the best in the future, dearie. John wouldn't tell me much, but as I understand it, you don't visit much anymore. You'd be as old as me by then, and I can put two and two together.
“Celery?” John asked with a pause. “Well. It’s not something that would normally come up doing something like this.” Another pause, followed by a giggle. Faint, but definitely a giggle.
“See you around then,” John said. He waved and disappeared into the crowd. Sherlock didn’t get much done but doodles of the same subject for the rest of the day.
“Visiting relatives,” Sherlock filled in.
“Will do,” said John. Mary blew a kiss and ended the call.
Sherlock pushed open the door and made his way to the sitting room.
The chainlink fence made a sound like a rusty bell when John leaned on it, the fingers of his dominant hand wrapped around the interlocking diamonds. “Seeing as we’re doing so poorly,” John continued, his voice almost imperceptibly lower than before, “would you mind putting aside your role as biggest fan and be my good luck charm instead?”
"For Mrs. Hudson's biscuits, always," Sharlock replied. He plucked one from under the checked blanket that had kept out most of the rain. He held it in his hands and inhaled deeply, taking in the scent of a sunny London, so long ago, yet fresh from the oven.
John pushed the dildo in and out while fisting Sherlock at a startling rate. Sherlock was overcome with shocks of pleasure that mounted faster than he could process. He was vaguely aware of a low moan being coaxed out of him, the sound choppy from the rhythm being pumped through him. John was murmuring little encouragements to him and all at once, everything burst with vivid color.
"I love it when you deduce me like that," Jawn spoke over him. "And yes, we both kept our names."
"That was exquisite, Sherlock," said Mary. "You did wonderfully, both of you. Untie him, darling."
This invitation was delivered in person. Apparently John was over his initial misgivings on the matter. They hadn’t spoken face to face since the bedroom event three weeks ago, but texts and emails had gradually taken on their past habits of communication: snarky jokes, half-hearted insults, exasperated social commentary and the like. The nervous mannerisms displayed by either party had decreased by sixty percent, and Sherlock extrapolated that a recurrence would only aid that process, or at least not inhibit it.
No, stay strong, Sherlock. “That was before I found out how many #1 fans you had. Captain.” He walked around a dumb-struck John and practically sprinted to class.
"Go on and do another," Mary encouraged him. Sherlock swallowed hard and leaned across John to kiss at the hollow of his collar bone, resting a hand on John’s thigh to balance himself, though he could have just as easily put it on the sheets to the side of him.
The bell chimed and the boy left along with most of the other students. John stayed behind to get a signature from the teacher, who was known to forget about such things if not reminded. Sherlock pretended to pack up some things that he had taken out specifically to stall in putting back. He timed it so he was just ahead of John walking out the door.
“John,” Sherlock pleaded. “Don’t.”
"Ready?" Mary whispered. Sherlock nodded and there was a soft grunt of agreement from above. "Alright," she said and began to move.
“For this arrangement to continue, we have to,” Sherlock insisted. He would not be responsible for the devolution of the Watson marriage. He would not let the whims of his heart get the better of him. He knew better.
You'd best be taking care of yourself. You're retired for goodness sake, get some rest! I imagine the two of you curled up reading on a lazy Sunday with a dog warming your feet. John showed me a picture of Gladstone, what a darling. And what a relief that you waited until you were out of the flat for the bees. Goodness!
Sherlock allowed himself a grimace. His back was turned to them anyway. "There's no point in staying."
“Perfect,” Mary said. “Go ahead John. And Sherlock? Don’t come until I tell you to.”
“One more, darlings, then it’s John’s turn,” Mary said. She was resting her head on one hand and looked quite content.
“You ask so nicely when you’re being fucked,” Mary said at last, making Sherlock shiver. “However, asking nicely isn’t going to get you anything, sweetheart. John? He’s ready for the dildo.”
"What are you talking about," John said, his tone flat.
Mike&Psych: smh
"Mary," he nodded in return. A quick glance over her person told him what would have taken the average person minutes of nervous dancing around the subject to discover. "This isn't a surprise. John told you ahead of time."
“What do you want most?” Mary prompted, her sly grin apparent even without visual confirmation.
There will be one more chapter, the epilogue.
Maybe it would be easier if he wasn’t looking. “You were defending someone,” he said. Yes, this was a much more successful method.
Sherlock sighed. "To save you the trouble of saying it aloud, I would indeed consent to a threeway with you an your wife."
“You don’t have to, Sherlock,” John said calmly. He shut the laptop and turned back to him. “I’ll live.” He smiled.
Sherlock had to remind himself to keep breathing. “I, uh,” he said with the utmost intelligence, “yes. Of course.”
“I know what it usually is,” Sherlock interrupted quickly. “I don’t see why you’d need me for it.”
“Terrible,” Samira agreed, “I won’t name names, but he’s been leaving a string of broken hearts with the boys too.”
The best of the rugby drawings had been cut out, mounted on card stock, and turned in for credit. He’d have to wait until the end of the unit to dispose of those. Sherlock flipped to the beginning of the unit, to the sketches from that first day of modeling. The day Sherlock was doomed to meet John and fall for his perfect, sculpted, artists’ catnip of a body.
Five new stretches were added to Sherlock’s completed pile before the next change of pose was called. Sherlock struggled to swallow. The next one hundred and twenty degrees put John directly facing him.
On second thought, maybe there wouldn't be anyone else there at all. Sherlock didn't have to be on the team to be in the locker room. Maybe John would pull him in after everyone had left and tell him how he’d been waiting all day to get him alone. John would smell earthy, he’d be close enough to see the glisten of sweat still fresh on his brow or beading on his lip.
"Er, yes. Hello."
Sherlock did not ask what made it perfect.
“Am I permitted to see the supplies that we’ll be using tonight?” he asked John.
The players on the field divided into partners to do passing drills. Sherlock was familiar with their warm-up routine by now. John usually paired off with a boy whose name was Michael; if that was his first or last name Sherlock neither knew nor cared to. He had little interest in details about anyone who was not John or a to-be criminal these days.
"If I'm not on a case."
“What were your findings, hm?” Mary asked.
John let out a breath. “That’s fine then. Gave me a shock, is all.”
John, not noticing the abrasive tone, obediently pivoted them so Mary had a side view of them both; he used his hands on Sherlock’s sides to coax him to follow when he remained unresponsive. Sherlock recovered quickly and moved to the new position.
The careful attention John was paying to his skin was making Sherlock hot all over. He gave in to the pleasant feeling and dropped lower into John’s lap, drawing out a sharp breath from each of them at the sensitive contact. John kissed at his neck more fervently and with a hint of teeth. Sherlock shifted closer, sorely tempted to rutt up against John in earnest before he remembered Mary. She hadn’t told them to go that far yet. He went still, expecting her to chastise him, but instead he was met with praise.
“Absolutely, I’d even get that old mascot head down from storage for you,” he said.
John's pupils did a strange dance in his head. He closed his eyes, gave his head a shake, and, when he saw that the oddity before had not vanished like it was supposed to, turned to his favorite chair and proceeded to curl up in it.
A quick kiss and her flushed face was gone from Sherlock's sight. He propped himself up on his elbows in time to see the lips he had just been snogging wrap around the head of his cock. He gasped and shut his eyes, better to feel her fingers tracing up the length of him, her tongue swirling around the head.
"What do you think?" Jawn prompted.
“No, and that’s why it’s tough,” the girl said with a small smile. “I’m drawing my dad. He died, a while back, and the thing I remember most about him was how he always tried to make others happy. He did this thing with his eyes that’s hard to describe,” she gestured to the beginning lines of it on her paper. “It was how he looked when he was waiting for the other person to laugh first. It doesn't make sense, I know-”
“Yes,” Sherlock continued, putting all his effort into keeping his voice steady. “The preserved state of Egyptian mummies is commonly attributed to the parched climate of the Eastern Desert. I wanted to make a more precise study with a basis on the frequent weather patterns of London.” He allowed himself a ragged inhale after that lengthy string of articulate syllables.
“Amazing,” John said.
"No, that's not-"
"I'm glad." What else was there to say?
Sherlock held the page tightly, ready to tear it out. His face felt hot. He willed himself to just do it already. The page perforation strained, but didn’t tear. Idiot! What could he possibly gain from harboring all these childish feelings for someone who would never be as invested in him? If he could just destroy this marker of shame, maybe he could move on. He could go back to the way things were. When things were safer, more concrete. More predictable.
Sherlock held his sketchbook tighter and willed himself not to blush. “Sherlock,” he blurted out for lack of anything else to say. What was the use of having a genius mind if it shorted out on him when he most needed it?
Once the knowledge set in that he could feel that way, it wasn’t long before a tidal wave of understanding nearly drowned him. He was in love with John Watson and had been for some time. It all made so much sense in retrospect. Boring, everyday happenings went from taxing to comfortable with John. He could be himself without fear. Life was no longer a frantic search for the next high, be it by brainwork or another means. Being with John made him feel… content. At ease.
Sherlock shrugged. He hoped his smile wasn’t too toothy and ridiculous, because he couldn’t stop if he wanted to.
"It's okay," said Mary. "Keep going."
Class was agony today. Sherlock ruffled his hair in frustration and flipped to yet another page of his sketchbook to start over. The assignments of the last month had been effortless, the ideas spouting from Sherlock’s mind to the paper as fast as he could put them there. Today was the end of that, it seemed. Sherlock had met yet another nemesis.
You can do it, Sherlock, maintain eye contact. “That’s my name. Sherlock.”
John gave him a final peck and waited for Sherlock to detach himself. He hadn’t realized how entwined they had become. It took a great effort to move away.
Sherlock sighed. “No, it’s not actually from a crime scene. It’s my own, I cleaned it and the evidence bag was the most sanitary means of transporting it.”
"There's someone at the door, John," Sherlock said. Jawn could already picture his fingers steepled like we're when he came across something perplexing.
"How could I know?" John stammered. "I'm single, I may not have met them yet!"
The art room tables were arranged in a square around a central platform that was really just another table with a cloth draped over it. The teacher instructed John to take off his outer layers (“You want me shirtless?” “Whatever you’re comfortable with, John.”) and pose on the platform. Instead of some sort of ridiculous magazine pose, John had started with a simple cross-legged sit. It gave Sherlock a good view of his back and shoulders, which were indeed bare.
“I’d rather you crossed the field.”
"Yes," Mary said. Her voice was husky and Sherlock could see her arm move faintly at the edge of the frame. She must be rubbing circles on her sex through her clothes. She wouldn't break control to pleasure herself quite yet, but her arousal had grown too large to ignore.
“Ta, what would they do without me?” John flashed a smile instantly dropped Sherlock’s mental efficiency by twenty-five percent.
Sherlock dragged his eyes away from the kitchen and turned toward her. "I see no reason not to."
Sherlock busied himself with his coat buttons. “Fine.”
Mike&Psych: Well, hurry up! Half the team already have their victory milkshakes
“Lucky guess, now turn to the side, would you boys?” she requested with an edge to her voice. Sherlock drew back with a start. Mary hadn’t known that John liked to be kissed there.
"Stop...!" he rasped. Both Watsons looked up at him in slightly comical unison. Sherlock sat up and shifted closer to Mary. He placed his hands on her hips and ran them lightly to her waist and back. "What would you like?"
He would be undone so quickly by John. Sherlock was struck by the force of how much he wanted John to do that to him, to open him up and fill him, even if it was only a toy that he was filling him with. He could only imagine those calloused hands on his prick, stroking in time with the thrusts of the silicone. John would stay cool and collected as Sherlock became more and more derailed by sensation. Somehow the John in this fantasy looked at Sherlock with something softer than arousal; it was something akin to affection.
Relief swept over Sherlock. Molly would be his guide in this absurd, sporty hellscape. “That would be lovely, thank you.”
“Oh,” John looked off to the side. “About what Mary said. You don’t have to do that.”
“But they have,” John said with finality. “We can’t ignore it.”
She straightened up and kissed his cheek. It was light, meant to break the tension. Sherlock could see why John liked her so much. She was as considerate as John was loyal.
The official excuse was that he needed three sketches of a human body in action. The actual reason for Sherlock repeatedly attending rugby practice involved a more personal interest.
Yeah. You get this early because I got bored.

JohnWatsUp: I thought I saw Sherlock. I was going to invite him to come with us
“Got into a fight, actually,” John said with shrug.
He refocused on John. They were so near to each other. John was right there. Right there! If he got up on his elbows he could kiss him. He could kiss that face he had looked across the breakfast table at for years. He could find out what that mouth that produced witty comebacks and beautiful laughter felt like, tasted like. More than anything, he wanted John to look at him and want it too. They were both nearing the end and Sherlock was running out of time to take the chance.
"Lovely," Sherlock intoned, careful to keep anything incriminating out of his voice. "Though honestly, sight isn't my sense of choice right now."
Sherlock rose up and pressed into John's mouth with a kiss that was entirely messy, heated, and rushed. John made a small noise of surprise that Sherlock drew down his own throat and answered with a moan of pleasure. He was doing it. He was kissing John Watson. And, oh god, he was coming.
John snorted at that.
It had been about a minute since Mary had stopped giving him head and Sherlock hadn't noticed, he was so wrapped up in his own thoughts. He sat up and opened his eyes to the most wonderful sight. Mary had moved to be on her hands and knees beside Sherlock; John was smoothing his hands down her thighs and dipping his tongue into her arse. Mary had a content expression on her face and John- Sherlock nearly came right there to see what John looked like doing that.
“So it seems,” Sherlock replied. Molly turned left and disappeared into the crowd, Sherlock turned right only to collide with someone coming from the other direction.
He had stood up for someone else, had gotten in a fight over it. Dedicated. Moral.
"How- never mind." Somewhere under John's embarrassment was the hint of a laugh. "This Saturday at nine?"
We don't slut shame John Watson in this house.
Sherlock had experienced his fill of mutual avoidance with classmates. Even if someone were to reach out to him, his usual response was to hide. Simple shyness often morphed into biting remarks, which were really just badly phrased truths.The idea that someone might see all that and still want to get to know him was a hope that Sherlock had long abandoned, but a hope that had resurfaced in the form of John Watson.
John is out to his team and they are all rooting him on, btw.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, Sherlock brought it,” said John. “It’s clean, so either of us could use it, I suppose.” Sherlock detected some squeamishness at the idea. Penetration must be an unexplored or possibly uncomfortable thought for John when he wasn’t the one doing the penetrating.
“No, not bad at all,” John replied. His eyes drifted to Sherlock again and caught him staring. John did that thing, the secret smile that made his stomach do certain, very potently pleasant maneuvers. In his effort to look like he hadn’t been ogling him like he was still on the table, Sherlock almost missed John’s wink. John didn’t miss when Sherlock’s complexion suddenly deepened in color.
Sherlock's eyebrows scrunched together, then repelled each other very fast. "Oh," he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was too early to know anything for certain, Sherlock decided. He didn't know which was the scarier outcome, John rejecting him or John seeking friendship. Or, Sherlock blushed at the possibility, John wanting him past the point of friendship.
“I know,” John said. He did? Did everyone know him before he knew them? “Hey, are you going to the game tonight?”
Sherlock glared at the elder Holmes’ reflection in the bathroom mirror. “Shut up.”
“… die? Oh Sherlock, don’t be stupid, even you should be able to-”
Sherlock hissed a laugh, but couldn’t bear to look her in the eye, “No, it’s not that… listen,” He wagered every word as he continued, “After I… died. I need you to do the autopsy. I need you to prove in any way possible that I am dead, that it is really me and that I won’t come back, this time.”
pain. They took the pain away.
Mary Watson.
What a stupid little boy.
Sherlock pressed his scarf against the stab wound in Mycroft’s stomach harder now, but the bleeding wouldn’t stop, why wouldn’t it stop…
She knew it would be useless trying to reason with him, trying to talk him out of anything he had figured would be the right thing to do. She knew there was nothing she could say to change his mind now, but she wanted to, she needed to, there had to be something she could do to stop this happening.

(See the end of the chapter for
Turning over in his chair, John made an attempt to soothe his sulking significant other, “Sherlock. Come on. That’s not the end of the world. That’s just how things go. Look at Greg, this man has had grey hair on the top of his head for decades now, did you ever see him complain? I’m sure the silver fox look will look good on you.”
No, because Sherlock planned it “his way”. Mary was probably involved, but didn’t care as well tbh, and John was totally indifferent about it all. So, after Mary is dealt with and John is back in Baker Street for good and they finally have talked (and kissed and done lots of other things, obviously), Sherlock would start to ask question which seem totally random for the uninvolved observer.
Caught in the act, Sherlock’s thoughts suddently hushed and he looked at his brother with a frown on his face.
Molly couldn’t help herself and puffed a laugh in disbelief, “Sherlock, that’s not funny… what’s going on?”
Is this not what happened in TSOT?

Except Sherlock never has been dead. I mean, of course they don’t go there, but imagine how fucked up it would be if any time Sherlock really died. [...] Imagine Sherlock realises that there is no way out, “your friends will die if you don’t”, and he accepts it, if this is the only way John can be save so be it, Sherlock is fine with it and…
He was sweating, only lightly, but still visibly. This cold kind of sweat, which usually goes along with vertigo, nausea, and this feeling-the-way-that-you-currently-look-like. Sherlock knew he had to be quite pale, his sunken cheeks disguised by his some-day-old beard, but considering that he had to lean against a piece of wood to keep himself from swaying, he knew that there was no way to fool John into thinking that he was

“What are you, my mother?”
“Oh… thought as much.” His voice was calm. Too calm. “He’s a good man, Sherlock. And so are you.”
“You’ve been asking a lot of questions, lately. What happened to your
“I just mispoke and corrected myself,” Sherlock tried to deflect the topic at first, but at this point he knew John far too well to misinterpret the disbelieving silence which followed his almost blatant lie differently than that John would not end this conversation without having been given a satisfying answer.
I want you to do this. After the last time, I mean… He won’t believe it. He won’t believe I really died this time. He will come looking for me, he won’t stop searching, but there will be nothing to find, and it will kill him. So, Molly, please…” And his voice almost broke at this point, “Tell him. Show him. Do whatever it takes to make him believe that I died, for real, this time.”
Always the addict.
Sherlock nodded and filed away this new piece of information almost audibly before tending to his microscope again, while John turned another page of his paper.
John pressed the tip of his cock to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock had the urge to do something rash. He placed a light, closed mouth kiss to John’s heated flesh. A drop of precum fell to his chin. John groaned and pushed past his lips, not stopping until he hit the back of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock inhaled deeply, loving how the smell of John’s musk matched the taste permeating his mouth. John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s shoulders in what was must have been an attempt to stop himself from thrusting without Mary’s permission.
No, he chastised himself. This was for Mary. He couldn't be greedy.
"Don't be shy, dear," Mary pulled off, the increased motions of her hand making up for the loss of contact with her mouth. "Play with him a little. The way I like."
"Oh, that was fantastic," Mary sighed. John pulled out and rolled to the side. Mary followed and flopped on top of him. The two began to kiss, sweet and satisfied. Sherlock tried not to feel so cold in the absence of their touch.
Sherlock tried his luck at a joke. “It’s in the job description, isn't it? Biggest fan?”
90% of this was written in 2014. Since then, my attitude about sex has changed and so has my writing. Hopefully the transition across time wasn't too jarring.
Mike&Psych: ?
Sherlock placed his hands on John’s shoulders and took a moment to read his expression before he made his next move. To his delight, John’s pupils were blown wide. His mouth was slightly open; he met Sherlock’s stare and licked his lips in what was clearly anticipation.
“My safe word is celery,” Sherlock said quickly.
“What?” Now it was John’s turn to look confused.
“No,” Sherlock agreed, his mind getting hazy. There was another clack as John added more lube to his fingers. Sherlock gasped as John pushed them deeper than before.
"That's right," Jawn confirmed. "Come closer if you don't believe me."
He could imagine the awkwardness of the locker room. It would be filled with boys he was supposed to trust in various states of undress, hitting each on the shoulder and generally making fools of themselves. Sherlock knew he would hang back from the ruckus, waiting to get a chance at privacy, all the while hating whatever twisted state of mind that had got him into this mess.
He got off the bed and retrieved his clothes. He removed his condom and tied it off before dropping it into the basket beside the married couple's bed. They were still snogging, relaxed and content. Sherlock felt a surge of something unpleasant in his belly. He redressed quickly and had his hand on the doorknob before John's voice stopped him cold.
Sherlock knew his throwing skills were lacking compared to anyone on the field, so he tucked his sketchbook under his arm and walked the ball down instead. To his surprise and excited embarrassment, John ran up to join Michael at the first row of bleachers.
Sherlock had to casually steal his neighbor’s pencil sharpener several times in the next twenty minutes. He had so much data on John stored up from the moment he walked in to now and all of it went to generating untried poses for John. Action shots, stills, close ups, it didn’t matter; Sherlock craved the texture of his skin and the light on his hair. How could he catch the thrill he felt glimpsing John’s impulsive tongue wet his lips or the way his chest fractionally rose and fell with every breath? The more Sherlock committed to unfeeling paper the more he consciously recognized John as a fellow living, breathing, blood-pumping creature.
“I don’t know what you’re referring to,” Sherlock admitted.
“Cross my heart.”
Control kink, definitely.
“God, Sherlock, that’s-”
“Someone’s got a crush.”
“...and finally, your captain, number forty-two, John Watson!”
"The vast majority of them are idiots, so obviously," Sherlock noted as if it were a logical progression of thoughts. It probably was, actually.
“I,” John started. He closed his eyes for a moment, steeling himself for what he would say next. The pause was an eternity and a second all at once. “Sherlock, I-”
"You did what you had to," Jawn reminded him, looking up and catching his eye.
The tension left John’s body. He looked up at the ceiling and exhaled a long breath. “Good,” he said. “That’s good.”
JohnWatsUp: …
Sherlock gave him a stare. "You know what, don't be daft."
John did so, stepping cautiously. "Bloody hell, it is me," he said after a minute, taking in the greys mixed with his blond, the continued awful taste in jumpers and the lines on his face that he saw on himself every morning.
John grunted in frustration. “I have to choose? Hair. Please.”
“What?” Sherlock felt light headed.
Another grin, this one a little cheeky. "That's right."
"Out with it," Sherlock said more forcefully, "I'm terribly busy." He wasn't, his latest case had finished yesterday.
It was the most exquisite orgasm Sherlock ever had. Their mouths were still close but no longer connected. They breathed in each other's air and the slightest touch of their gaping lips only added to the fire Sherlock was feeling. He was light-headed and couldn't think and he loved it. His mind was empty except for the knowledge that John could see him. He had come undone and John was watching every moment if it.
"Because what, John?" said Sherlock.
Sherlock got to the floor perhaps a tad too quickly, his shins hit the hardwood with a smart thump. John winced sympathetically, a detail which Sherlock chose to ignore.
Kind. Social. Athletic. It was a start, but it didn't go deep enough. Everyone knew that side of John, he wanted to bring out something more complex. Sherlock thought back to the modeling day and kept listing. Confident. Joking. Inviting. Relaxed. Focused.
In his mind, Sherlock could pretend that he wasn't shy. He’d have something witty to say, something to drive John wild. He’d hear John’s breathing quicken and intermingle with his own. He’d feel the material of John’s uniform and know the exact texture of John’s hair, how it changed if it was wet with perspiration. He was overcome with wanting to know if John’s lips were capped or soft, or the angle that he’d tilt his head, if he’d ease into a kiss or surge up and take it from Sherlock’s eager mouth.
John breathed deeply. It was so good to be in London again. He hadn't had the chance to return as often as he liked now that he was retired. Well, in the future when he was retired. John Watson was not only traveling back to the place where his life began, but the time as well.
The girl handed him her pencil sharpener. “That’s the nature of art isn't it? It can’t be completely right. By definition, I mean.”
John looked hurt. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, I guess so, but. I thought we were about to? Y’know. ‘Establish a pattern of contact’.” He gave a weak smile.
"Now wait a minute-" John sat at attention in his chair.
Sherlock tongued at the slit and varied the amount of suction by hollowing his cheeks. He bent to take more of John in. It was at first startling and later amazing to feel him grow firmer in his mouth. Sherlock felt a rush of pride; John was at full hardness again.
“Yes, I understand the ideology,” said Sherlock, annoyed. He turned his pencil in the tiny pink sharpener with unnecessary aggression. The girl eyed his overzealous sharpening with caution. “I've adopted my own ideology,” Sherlock continued, “and that is to deny the existence of perfection is to give up on reaching it.”
Hands circled around Sherlock's middle and started undoing his fly. A flash of alarm shot through Sherlock's mind before he remembered that it was Mary and not just himself and John in this unusual situation.
Sherlock had a moment to look at John with wonder. There was more? Then John smirked and crooked his fingers up, making Sherlock’s senses absolutely sing.
Jawn chuckled and waited until Sherlock was ready. At the last moment, he reached for John's chin and pulled him into a kiss. A choking sound came from Sherlock's direction, followed by many shutter clicks. John blanched and struggled, but Jawn kept him in place with a hand on the back of his neck. When the aura of Sherlock's amusement faded into annoyance, Jawn gave a final nip to his lower lip, just the way his husband often kissed him, and drew back. John looked absolutely horrified.
"Hm," Sherlock mumbled as a response, attention fixed on the kitchen entrance. There was a moment of comfortable silence as Mary finished her tea, followed by a clink when she set her empty cup next the Sherlock's full one on the coffee table.
JohnWatsUp: Shut up! He’s our #1 fan
“Nn, the rate… was, ah, not linear,” Sherlock struggled through the simple words. “I formulated. An. Equation.”
There seemed to be some sort of malfunction in the part of John's brain that was responsible for maintaining eye contact. Everything else was in place, his hand was steady when he handed Sherlock his tea, but he was utterly unable to look at his former flatmate.
“Not good at chemistry?” Samira said, incredulous. “Um. He has very good chemistry with about half the school.” It must have been some kind of inside joke, because Sherlock was the only one who was not amused.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open. He couldn’t remove the image of John’s dumb, perfect smile from his head, but he could destroy the physical evidence that this whole futile endeavor had ever happened. He sat up and pulled his sketchbook out of his book bag.
Mary grinned and opened the package. She rolled the contents on to Sherlock's length and pushed him onto his back so she could wet his cock with her mouth again. She took the whole of it this time, or close to it; Sherlock was too far gone to know for sure.
What was it about faces that was so difficult?! Drawing them had been simple when it was connected to the rest of the body. Change one little thing, the point of emphasis, and Sherlock was fumbling around like he had never held a pencil before.
“Nice run at the game last night, John!” one of the boys called from the back row.
how about Sherlock coming to one of John’s rugby games and ending up practically fainting when he sees John all sweaty and dirty?
(See the end of the chapter for
Mike&Psych: hey, what’s the hold up? Did you lose your car again?
Mary beamed. “Wonderful. Well now, what are you two still doing in the sitting room? Off you get!”
"Come on, then," Mary said, taking his hand. She gently pulled them both to the bedroom.
John nodded and offered a terse hello. Sherlock drank in the sight of him, always up for a new puzzle. Short with a practical, athletic hair cut. Established tan lines this early in spring definitely pointed to sports. Where had he heard that name before?
Sherlock refastened his trousers and leaned on the table with his head in his hands. He concentrated on all the things that usually made his arousal dissipate. Carelessly collected evidence. Insipid party conversations. Yogurt commercials.
“I’m-”
Not a scratch on him to show for it. Experienced. Smart.
"Tell me, Sherlock," she said. "How does that feel?"
“Good luck,” Sherlock finally found his words.
“Hey, if you were any good at eating pussy we’d poke fun at you for it, too,” John said in return. John seemed to remember something and turned to Sherlock with an apologetic look. “Sorry if our humor’s a bit vulgar.”
“I was testing the rate of human decomposition in different humidities,” said Sherlock. Like a cue in a play, John rubbed gingerly around his entrance with slick fingers and Mary grinned with excitement.
JohnWatsUp: Um
The instant Mycroft’s car pulled away, Sherlock had many regrets. He hadn’t been to a sporting event since primary school and whatever ruckus he had just walked into was not that. Students pushed past him on all sides, streaks of their school colors under their eyes like warpaint. Everywhere he looked, clusters of teenagers and families were grinning and laughing, excited for a night out after a long week. The bleachers bordering the field were so full that people had taken to spreading blankets on the ground. Sherlock had neither a blanket, a place to sit, or friends to sit with. Maybe it wasn’t too late to ask Mycroft to come back? He might still be in the parking lot with the way traffic had been.
“Don’t make any promises, Mike,” John cut in. “With your aim, it’s only a matter of time before you do some serious damage to our biggest fan.”
John opened his mouth to say something, then seemed to change his mind.
"Say," Jawn continued, his casual tone as fake and strained as Sherlock smiling for ordinary people. "Have you met The Woman yet?" Judging by their blank stares, they hadn't. "I see," he said. "Farther back than I thought." His fingers toyed fitfully with the hem of his jumper.
“It’s usually when two people-”
"The experiment, Dr. Watson," Sherlock reminded Jawn. If it was out of impatience or worry over the sudden flash-forward, it was difficult to say.
"Yes, well-"
I'm in the process of betaing and transferring works I've completed from fanfic to here. There will be a chapter of this a day until completion.
John's shoulders slumped. "'Inconclusive' wouldn't be a proper answer, would it?" he said at last.
"Were you saying something, Sherlock?" John from the present tense entered the sitting room. There was a pause as Sherlock processed the dual source of John's voice.
“What do you want, John?”
Connection to a group of people on any level was a foreign concept to Sherlock. More and more he envied John and his ability to coexist and rely on something with so many uncontrollable variables involved. He had sat in on enough practices to know that every member of the team was interconnected with trust and sportsmanship and an array of other idealistic values Sherlock would have rolled his eyes at a week ago. Now he saw how important such things were to John; they consistently drove the team to do the physically stunning things that had found their way into the pages of his sketchbook.
"John," Sherlock said again. "He's just gone to Mrs. Hudson's flat. It's fine." He gave John an incredulous look, like he should at least be able to count the footsteps on the stairs to see if their time traveling guest really was gone.
“You’re bloody gorgeous, both of you,” Mary said, a little breathy. “I think we’re ready to move on. John, be a dear and get the restraints.”
Also, the reason I'm revisiting this story is completely based on my contempt with season 4. I'm a petty bitch okay
“I’ve got to turn in, it’s even later where I am and you know how traveling can be,” Mary said. “Good night, boys! I’ll call in the morning for a chat, John. Text me when you’re up.”
John withdrew completely. Sherlock nearly sobbed at the absence. He felt empty except for the memory of lightning in his veins. It was strangely… good. A harsh kind of good. Whether Mary had planned it this way or not, his arousal had doubled when she denied him his request and his felt a renewed need to be filled, stronger than before.
“Thank you dear,” Mary said to John. “Let’s not waste much time with the clothes today, I’m already knackered from traveling. I’d be asleep if I wasn’t so excited!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mary looked amused. "That's fine, I'll get them." She got to her knees to be at eye level with the last remaining piece of clothing and glanced up at her husband with another one of those sneaky smiles. John gulped again, apparently knowing the outcome of that particular position.
"Sorry," Jawn answered, hand already on the door nob. "I've caused enough paradoxes for one visit. I don't think we'll meet again. Ta!" He left with a quick backwards wave.
Sherlock was suddenly acutely aware of how spread out he was, kneeling over John’s legs. He tightened his hold on John’s shoulders and looked down into his lap. He had not expected John to be fully erect. That was… wow. If he hadn’t been flushed before he certainly was now.
"No, no," Mary chided him. "You've done me and I've done Sherlock. It's only fair the he does you."
It wasn’t until the lead was secure that Molly’s friends started to divulge other, non-rugby details about the captain. Molly claimed that he was pants at chemistry, but he’d been a decent partner for a presentation last semester. She had a fear of public speaking, but with her data and John’s charm, they’d done very well.
Blindfolds/Gags. Speaking hadn’t been a problem last time, so he doubted the use of a gag would be pleasurable for more than the visual appeal. It did prevent kissing and oral, so the likelihood of Mary choosing that route was small. The blindfold, however, was a more worthy option, for the experimental draw of sensory deprivation if nothing else.
JohnWatsUp: I see him, one sec
“I don’t remember that one,” Mary commented on the dildo. “It’s not mine, is it?”
Sherlock gave him a stern, I-can-always-tell look.
"Right," said Jawn. "How to put this delicately? Don't knock it till you try it. Yeah, that's about good."
“You’ll have the hour to draw at least three detailed sketches of our model,” the teacher began. “John will change poses every twenty minutes, so make sure you get all the lines that you need to finish the drawing down before he does. Don’t worry about shading, the name of the game is light contour lines. Any questions? No? Get to work!”
“You’re looking for a perfect answer where there is none,” she explained. “With portraits, you are trying to portray a person, to show the viewers who they are. It’s not a test on how accurately you can draw a nose or an ear, because even pictures don’t really show a whole person, and that’s as realistic as it gets.
“It’s no trouble,” Sherlock assured her.
Sherlock pretended to be invested in the conversation about how the home team would have to make up the twelve point difference in the next half, but his attention kept drifting back to the field, hoping to catch a glimpse of a certain blonde captain. To his surprise, one of the players, the only one he cared about, waved in his direction. Sherlock gave a tiny wave back, small enough that no one would notice if he was mistaken and John was actually waving at someone else. To his alarm and delight, John started jogging toward him. Sherlock excused himself from the conversation with Molly’s friends and approached the chainlink fence that divided the throng of students from the field.
"It's Mary."
"Just who are you?" John still looked confused.
Sherlock wanted him. Badly.
Mary stepped out of her dress, not nervous at all to be the least dressed in the room. Sherlock found that he wasn't uncomfortable in the slightest as Mary unbuttoned the front of his suit and slid it off his shoulders. His shirt followed in much the same way.
John keep the pace, thrusting the toy with unforgiving accuracy and lingering over just the right spots to make Sherlock's knees weak. It was so much better than his fantasy or anything he'd done to himself. This way Sherlock could let go of the concentration it took to maintain the image of John and instead focus on the reality of John. He was nearly enjoying himself too much to catch John's next words.
Both of them stood, hovering in the silence. John wanted to move, to do something, but he felt as if there were road blocks on all sides of him. Sherlock looked equally antsy, as antsy as he could be while maintaining a neutral expression and not fidgeting whatsoever. Only John could pick out the slight darting movement of his eyes, searching out traces of information before the real event took place.
Sherlock made an attempt at logic. “They don’t have to-”
Jawn laughed. "Not really. The point is that there are so many other factors besides gender. Would you care for an experiment?" Sherlock's eyes brightened instantly.
Seeing John in the flat again had two warring effects on Sherlock. The first was a pleasant hum in the back of his skull; every color was brighter and every line crisper when John entered. The second was a twinge of bitter reminiscence that he sought to squelch immediately. With both feelings held a comfortable distance at bay, he stood and waited for John to finish his pleasantries and address the subject he had made the journey for.
“Time!” The teacher called. “Please throw away any pencil shavings and stack your drawing boards neatly where you found them. Great work today, everyone!”
"Right. Now Sherlock, I might ask for either you or John to do something while you can't speak. If you have a problem with anything, raise your hand and we'll stop. If you want to slow down but not stop, raise one finger. Show me."
"I would ask for details, but I recall I was present the first time around," Sharlock set his violin on the coffee table. Not the same table as the flat, they had gone through two or three due to the stress of being walked on by detectives in bathrobes.
“Wow, really?” the boy clapped John on the back. Sherlock tensed at the stranger being able to touch and converse with John so easily. He wanted that too. He wanted to be closer to the one who now filled his thoughts and the pages of his sketchbook.
Sherlock scrubbed his hands over his face and stared up at his bedroom ceiling. He was better than this, wasn’t he? Focusing on school, on facts, had always been easy. Not always entertaining, but never as frustrating and confusing as whatever was taking up all his brain space now.
The corners of Sherlock’s mouth spread into a smile. “I’d very much like you to kiss me right now,” he said.
At that moment, John delivered a particularity solid thrust. Sherlock had to use every trick he'd ever taught himself to not give in to the tension building at the base of his spine. He was so close to the end.
"Not with a woman," he admitted. "but I'm not one to turn down an experiment."
Molly shuffled all her loose papers into a neat pile and stowed them in her art folder, which featured a glossy print of three kittens in a basket on the front. “What class do you have next?” she asked conversationally.
"You called me for that?" John strode to the door. "You were much closer, honestly, I don't-"
"Could I... touch him more than this?" he asked Mary. Sherlock felt a jolt through his system and hoped with all his might that Mary would allow it. He gazed at the computer screen with pleading eyes through his haze of lust and stimulation.
“I’ll be fine without, thanks,” Sherlock said. He gave his appearance a final once-over and tried out a tiny, closed-mouth grin. It wasn’t half bad.
John opened his mouth, closed it, and pondered. "Most of them get interrupted," he said slowly. Sherlock looked a little smug.
"Ever been in love before, John?" Jawn asked rhetorically.
“Not if it makes you uncomfortable,” John said quickly. “Maybe you only like it as foreplay, a means to an end, you know? And that’s fine. It doesn’t bother me.”
"She's pretty," John replied tersely. "Is this part of the experiment?" He handed the print back.
John continued without missing a beat. “I’ll text you the details, let me know if you’ve got any limits that didn’t come up last time. Mary’s normally pretty tame when it comes to doing, but who knows what she likes to watch, eh?”
John closed the laptop, a motion Sherlock suspected was just to have something to do. There was an odd silence around them. It wasn’t a distancing, uncomfortable sort, like the beginning of their first venture, nor was it the companionable silence that they had often shared in 221B, way back then. It was something new, and Sherlock ached to know what it was.
“Molly,” the girl smiled a little more. “Molly Hooper.”
“Yeah, you show up to more practices than some of our members,” John said with a pointed look at one such slacker by the water cooler. “You could be a mascot of sorts.”
They disconnected.
Sherlock wrapped his scarf around his neck. "You know where to find me."
Sherlock could feel his resolve crumbling. Why did John have to have puppy eyes, on top of everything else?
The boy who had complimented John before got up to speak to him again. “Not bad for a detention, huh John?” Sherlock overheard.
"Um," John said intelligently. Sherlock froze as well.
John continued. "So don't expect me to go on a rampage of dating men just because-"
As soon as he could speak again, John was apologizing. “I meant to pull out before...” he coughed awkwardly, “that happened. Should have been using a condom. I’m a goddamn doctor and I-”
“The setup was rather simple, five air-tight containers with a finger from the same hand in each. There were thermometers and humidity gauges on the outside of the containers so I could monitor-”
“Please!” Sherlock couldn’t help it any longer. “Let me come like this, oh god, John. Mary…!”
Sherlock untucked the tighter shirt from John's jeans and pulled that up over his head too. He put an effort into touching John as little as possible, even if it seemed backwards in this context. As a result, John shivered when he did feel Sherlock's fingertips on his skin.
Sherlock resisted the urge to pinch himself.
The focus of the photo was a girl; short hair, nice clothes. She leaned on the rail of a bridge overlooking a shallow stream. John recognized it from a park not far outside of London. It was much cleaner in the picture than it was now, all made more picturesque by the girl's genuine smile.
"Oh no," Jawn chuckled. "Just thought you'd like to see Mrs. Hudson from back in the day."
“Yes,” he confirmed.
There was no telling what kind of noises he made after that. John worked him open and Sherlock was more pliant to his touch than he’d ever been with anyone, he couldn’t get enough of it. John stroked and stretched and it was so intense that Sherlock could hardly breathe.
The laptop was situated so Mary had a view of John’s front and Sherlock’s back. Sherlock dutifully clasped his hands behind his back and leaned forward, supporting most of his weight on the bed frame. With his height, he had no trouble finding a comfortable position hovering over John’s cock. His lips were nearly in contact when he made the mistake of looking up.
It was a strange request, but having free reign to taste John's body was enough of an incentive not to question it. Sherlock thought carefully about John mannerisms, what side he favored, which points of contact he shied away from when talking with strangers. At last he had it narrowed down enough to give it a go.
"Pants too, boys," Mary directed. Her tone was gaining authority as the night unfolded. A control kink, perhaps? Or simple impatience?
He probably goes home and draws himself into some of the pictures but gets embarrassed and hides them in his room.
Still not your housekeeper.
But John would be there. Maybe he’d notice Sherlock’s discomfort and ruffle his hair, ask him what was wrong. Sherlock would mutter something about being fine, that nothing was wrong, and John would see right through that and pursue the matter. Sherlock would ask him why he cared so much, and John would pin him with that steady look, the one that made him feel trapped and safe at the same time.
The bell rang and saved him from admitting anything as damning as “Ideal” to paper.
“Good,” said Mary. “Let’s begin.”
“I brought something as well.” Sherlock procured an item from the folds of his coat, which was draped over the armrest of the sofa.
“Then it’d be a shame not to,” Mary decided. “Sherlock, lay down on your back with your hands above your head, that’s it. John, tie his wrists and use the headboard if you need to.”
Sherlock gets a challenging art assignment.
"Good," Mary smiled. She situated herself with a hand on the mattress to either side of Sherlock's head. A look of confirmation from Sherlock and she sank down on his cock. Every inch was hot and slow. Sherlock had never though he could be with a women in this way before. The breasts settling on his chest were uncomfortable and distracting, but he couldn't argue with the arousal that came with the heat and pressure of being inside Mary Watson.
Sensation was building too quickly. Sherlock knew their evening would be short lived if the focus remained on himself. This was suppose to be about Mary.
Sherlock couldn’t help but compare him to the Greco-Roman statues they’d gone over in preparation for this unit. He looked like a lounging god.
Sensations coursed through him too fast to catalogue. He didn't know what to focus on. A lengthy moan from Mary meant she was close. Very close. Her trusts grew erratic and Sherlock felt her natural lubrication drip past his condom onto the skin at the base of his cock. Her fingers wrapped tight in the sheets by his shoulders and her head dropped to pant heavy and wet on his neck. If her head was lower, that meant-
Sherlock becomes a regular spectator at John's rugby practices.
“How does it feel, John?” Mary asked.
Mary was speaking, but Sherlock didn’t register more than that she was breathing audibly. John’s noises broke through more clearly. Stifled grunts made way for louder groans. Mary urged him on until they were both panting. One of John’s hands drifted up Sherlock’s neck and twined once again in his hair. The fingers tugged lightly, giving Sherlock chills. He moaned around John’s length, loving how the vibrations made him swear and dig his nails into Sherlock’s shoulder.
Mike&Psych: [eyes emoji]
If you can't tell, I know almost nothing about rugby.
Sherlock clenched his hands into fists and let his nails bite into his palm. He worried that without distraction he'd do something horrendously transparent, like rocking into John's methodical, achingly through fingers. Oh, how he wanted to.
"God, that's hot," John said, vocal at last. "Is that really what it looks like?" He walked to the other side of the bed for a better viewing angle.
"I'm. Not. Gay," John insisted.
“Sherlock?”
Say it. There wouldn’t be a better time. Sherlock kicked himself for every second that he didn’t spit his words out. If was barely a sentence, he could do it. He turned slightly, drew breath, and-
Hm. "Straighten" probably wasn't the best choice of words.
“Are you avoiding me?” asked John Watson.
"Help me with the zipper, John?" she said casually once the door was closed. John visibly relaxed, the hand he placed on her shoulder seemed to be her steadying him more than the other way around.
“John!” Mary gasped. “I’m going to…!”
Sherlock never jumped to conclusions without facts, but the observations cropping up around John Watson were all pointing to hopeful, and not just for the sake of his wife. It was a tempting verdict, and Sherlock concentrated very intently on stowing it somewhere he could quickly forget. It would do him no good to assume John returned feelings that he actually did not.
"I'm not disagreeing with you," Jawn smiled, memories flicked by behind his eyes, but he didn't allow himself to be distracted. "The day-to-day can be brilliant."
Mary sighed happily. "That should do it." She handed the bottle of lube back to her husband. John leaned away from her smooth arse and slicked up his fingers, which he then swirled around her entrance. Sherlock noticed a shiny trail that dribbled down her leg.
Sherlock knew he’d done nothing wrong sitting in on practices, but his face heated with guilt all the same. “Biggest fan?” he asked with hesitation.
Mike&Psych: And you're his.
The laptop on the table beeped with a notification of Mary’s call. They hurriedly put their toys aside and shifted closer together to be in the frame of the shot. John fiddled around with the settings until Mary appeared on the screen.
“John, I’m going to let you fuck his mouth,” Mary said, then paused and waited for John to stop his whispered swearing. “You will look at me the whole time. With any luck we’ll come together. Now, I want you to push into him slowly.”
“That’s absurd,” Sherlock said in a serious tone, but he was smiling. “I only do baked goods sex.”
"Yes," Sherlock said quickly. That meant they would be facing each other. With any luck he would be able to see John's face when he came.
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” she said.
Jawn still had his keys to the flat, so he let himself in to 221B. The decency to knock at the top of the stairs did not escape him, though.
At halftime, Molly and George offered to hold their spots while Sherlock and the other two went down to the concession stand. Sherlock couldn’t care less about popcorn or hot chocolate, but it was an excuse to get closer to the field.
"Fair enough," John said.
"P- Please. Let me come. Mary, please!" he shouted.
Jawn gave him a squeeze on the shoulder. He hadn't realized how tense he had gotten. He set down the half-eaten biscuit to place a hand on top of Jawn's, identical rings clinking softly.
Try as he might, Sherlock couldn't look away. Some sane corner of his mind hoped that John didn't notice, but an alarmingly large, reckless part of him wanted the exact opposite.
"Feel like eating?" Jawn asked, setting a basket on the kitchen table.
“His mouth, oh god, I want him-”
It didn’t take Sherlock’s level of observation to count that there was one more warm body in the classroom than there should have been. Third hour life drawing was usually filled with a dull mix of arrogant prodigies and bumbling slackers. Today, there was one new exception.
Sherlock cupped her face for a real kiss. It was minimal, a simple slide of lips. After a few seconds they separated. Mary got up from the couch and held out a hand for Sherlock to do the same. She didn't let go as she led him to the kitchen. John was fumbling with a coffee maker. It didn't take much to deduce that his guilty look stemmed from the image of the sitting room reflected on the glass of the china cabinet.
Sherlock pushed his chair back from the table where he had been pouring over the list and opened his trousers. He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. It wasn’t right to get off to thoughts of his best friend’s fingers or wondering what noises he’d make when being sucked off. Sherlock bit his lip and palmed himself through his pants.
The scene skipped ahead as daydreams often do; somehow he was wearing John’s warm ups, the ones with “Watson” printed on the back. John had him backed into the lockers, kissing his neck and telling him, “I like that name on you…”
John placed a kiss on the corner of his mouth. “You alright?” he asked. Sherlock nodded, the tenderness in his voice had sent him reeling. John was aroused and holding him, kissing him, caring for him. It was so right that it hurt. John kissed him more, along his jaw and down his neck. He licked his pulse and Sherlock could swear from the shape of his lips that he was smiling when he kissed the shell of his ear.
John stopped mid-thrust. His shoulders hunched, his jaw dropped, and he came hot and thick in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock was enraptured by everything from the crease in John’s brow to the quivering of his thighs. All too soon, John was pulling away and a garbage bin was placed in front of Sherlock so he could spit.

"I'll leave you to compile the data on your own," Jawn gave John a pat on the back.
JohnWatsUp: I’ll be there soon
Before he could process the change, Mary was on her feet again, confident and determined, kissing Sherlock within an inch of his life. It had been some time since anyone had done that, and Sherlock was in such a stupor that it was easy to tip him backwards onto the bed. The rush of arousal was not unwelcome.
