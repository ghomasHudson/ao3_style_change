“He got my number from Benny and texted me. Asked me to come back inside. But I couldn't. I, um, told him I’d text him today.”
“Have you been wasting money on eating out the whole time I’ve been away?” Ishim takes a step closer and grabs Castiel’s wrist, jerking it down from his face.
Castiel meets his eye with a smile, “Don’t think I can resist you much longer, you sure you feel ready?”
The truck is packed full of exhausted people and the ride is extremely uncomfortable. The road is littered with rubble and shakes the truck violently whenever they drive over any bumps, jarring Dean’s ribs painfully, but he tries not to let it show for Jack's sake.
He had watched his master stand stock still for two hours once. They had been walking along the corridor when his master had just stopped dead. No matter what Dean had done to get his attention his master hadn't budged. He had freaked out a bit about the prospect of being trapped on a ship in the middle of space but then his master had sprung back to life and wandered down a different corridor like nothing had happened.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and let the next contraction pass. He was exhausted. He didn't know how his mother had done this three times.
Once he was done his master took the bowl back to clean. Dean sat on the floor beside him and leaned against his master's leg.
eggs was unsettling. He knew the vast majority of species that ate animal based diets were usually ovivorous to some degree but still they were
Castiel glared. He knew his grandmother was only teasing him, trying to bring him out of his mood, but he
Castiel panted and cried and laughed. His grandmother's deft hands swept over the baby, tied the cord, and cut it. Gabriel covered them up with the softest blanket they had.
heard Qech's pets make noises that sounded a great deal like garbled and broken Ipix. He hadn't known what to think then and he didn't know what to think now. Humans were animals. Some animals were gifted mimics but that didn't mean they understood language. But the way the Qech's humans had greeted Dean and had later acted in the kitchen...
Dean gave a shaky nod. "I think so." He looked down to Castiel's chest. His eyes flicked up and down. "I just...I've only seen animals and...and people are different," Dean repeated, shyly.
He was handed another bowl of mush, this one flavoured to be spicy. He sat down and ate it with his back to the outside view.
planned on throwing out the used sex toys when they were done with them so what did it matter if Uth ate them instead? He shrugged it off and messaged Uth back. He'd buy edible-for-Hflips eggs.
Castiel wrinkled his nose at the suggestion. The more water he drank the more slick he made. He sat up. Sweat trickled down his forehead. He wiped it away. "I hate this."
His grandmother's shuffling step stopped outside his door. She knocked. She poked her head in. She shuffled in and closed the door. She made her slow way across the room and sat on the bed.
His master made a snorting sound that Dean still didn't understand. Sometimes the snorting was a good sound but sometimes it was bad. He wasn't even sure it was supposed to mean anything. Maybe giant lizard guys were all prone to runny noses.
Castiel stepped in. The human stepped back and eyed Castiel's bladed tail warily. Castiel wrapped his bladed tail around his leg and crouched down to the human's level.
He fought the urge to cover himself; his cock hanging below his belly and the small puffy breasts he'd grown. His nipples prickled and hardened in the cold.
Evan rubbed his fingers together while inspecting the way Castiel's slick clung to his fingers. "Slick. I've heard about that." He reached under Castiel and felt along his ass again until he was pushing a finger into Castiel's hole. He made an appreciative noise. "You're right. You're so wet."
"We're aware." Castiel said. Sam pushed the bread into his chest. Castiel hesitantly brought his hands up. His fingers curled around it. If they had this and the other loaf they might not need to dip into their savings again this week.
Hannah hesitated but knelt beside Adam Winchester. She slipped her hands into his pockets and pulled out three protection charms, a handful of gold buttons, silk ribbon, a silver letter opener, and enough coins to buy a hen.
"What do you think alphas are like?" Dean asked from his spot beside him, half hidden by the late spring grass. It was already knee high and would only get taller with the summer.
"Castiel, you shouldn't bleed after. It shouldn't hurt," his grandmother said. "Even when you're only doing it for trade, it shouldn't hurt. That's now how it's supposed to be."
He had finally resorted to putting Dean on his leash and tying him off a short distance away from wherever he worked. Dean hadn't liked it at first but Castiel had given him a few puzzle toys designed to keep humans occupied while he absently talked about his work. The combination of activity and his voice seemed to be enough to calm Dean down a little bit.
"And there's plenty to eat in the forest this time of year." His grandmother said. She squinted at the woods beyond the fields. "Tomorrow we'll go out and start harvesting the early plants."
His pet that trusted him with everything and only ever wanted to please him. And there he was fantasying about what it would feel like if Dean licked at his mating tail.
Castiel tensed up with another contraction. He clenched his jaw and waited for it to pass. He huffed and panted when it was over. He looked up to find Gabriel watching him curiously.
Dean darted forward and wrapped an arm around his master's leg. "Come on, dude. Double rations. You forgot my dinner last night."
Castiel's grandmother nodded. "Alright then." She waved a hand at Castiel. "Put our things out then tell Michael Goodson we need water that's been boiled."
They go back to the Toyota dealer and Cas ends up buying the Highlander that he liked. He has to wait until Sam comes home from Jess’s later this evening to pick it up because he’s still not allowed to drive. When the purchase is complete, they drive back to the house so that Cas can rest, even though he tries to convince Dean that he’s not that tired.
Dean usually storms off in a huff until he can calm down and see that Castiel was right in wanting - needing - him safe in whatever the circumstance happened to be.
Dean wanders around the room for a bit, touching and moving a couple of things before hiding the keychain under some pillows. He doesn’t want it to be too easy for her. He then calls the instructor back into the room.
Ishim twists his arm harder and grabs him by the hair at the back of his neck, jerking his head close. Ishim looks him in the eyes and studies him for a moment before shoving him away. Castiel gently rubs his wrist with his other hand, steadily not looking at Ishim. His heart is racing in his chest painfully fast as he begins to realize, he doesn’t know how far Isham’s punishments might go anymore.
“Hi, Sam,” Cas greets him carefully as he takes his seat, “How is Jess? I hope she is feeling better?.”
Castiel hadn’t realized how on edge he used to feel all the time at ‘home’. Well, his old home, anytime Ishim was around Cas was filtering what he would say, always acting a certain way to keep Ishim happy, how had he not realized that it had made him utterly miserable.
He puts the flyer in his locker, planning to go to the club on Friday. He sure hopes Cain would be working.
“I was calling the police when I saw what he was stealing. The Seignac. MY Seignac! I didn’t know what to do. I thought that if he were arrested, I’d be in trouble for an attempted forgery or something.”
They finish their breakfast and move to Cas’s couch, turning on the TV - but end up making out. After a heavy make-out session, Cas curls up against Dean’s chest, and they actually watch TV until Cas begins to fall asleep. That’s Dean’s clue that it’s time to go. He jostles Cas awake and smiles as Cas rubs his eyes sleepily and yawns. Dean thinks he’s adorable.
“Look, I was drunk, okay - and he was hot!” Dean counters, nearly spilling his beer in his excitement.
Dean just smiles back at him and Castiel thinks with relief that they may finally be getting somewhere.
“Ready,” she repeats meeting his eyes. Castiel casts one last glance over to where the shark is still ripping large and bloody chunks out of the body. He tries not to think about the person alive, of their name and life or how their body is being devoured. He tries not to think about the family that may search for them… and never find them.
Time passes, more injured people are brought in, some bodies are wrapped and taken away. The hospital is dirty, overcrowded, and alive with movement. The sound of weeping mothers, angry and fearful fathers and wailing children fills the air. Doctors and nurses are rushing around, looking wary and stressed. There are volunteers helping out too, men and women from the nearby villages, writing names on lists, and trying to reunite families.
The employee let out a single sharp click. "There's no accounting for taste." She pushed the panel open and motioned for Castiel to go in. "It comes to Dean, although it's not the most trustful of strangers but it warms up to people quickly."
His grandmother sighed with soft sympathy. She sat down beside him and explained about using his fingers to get himself ready. Castiel listened silently, too embarrassed to ask questions. He had thought he knew so much but he hadn't even known he could make slick outside of a heat.
That was probably for the best. He wouldn't be burdened with a pet for most of his life if he didn't want it.
The priest gaped like a fish as his eyes flicked over his initials on the letter opener. He snatched it off Hannah and hastily stuffed it into his pocket. His eyes flicked over each of them until they landed on Castiel.
"I don't...I don't know how," Castiel admitted. He stared down at the bowl his grandmother had put in front of him. He didn't know how but he knew he'd have to go back to the bakery next week if they wanted to eat.
Dean bucked his hips against Castiel frantically. Castiel tangled his fingers into Dean's hair and drove his tongue into Dean's mouth. Dean groaned. Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean the way he'd seen Kali do it.
Dean kept his distance from his master as he hissed at the purple puffball. The puffball whistled and made a shrieking noise that made Dean cover his ears. His master clicked his claws then scooped Dean up and marched out of the kennel.
Dean hesitantly reached out and took the ball. He winced, expecting punishment anyway, but his master made a low approving hiss and gave him a pat on the head.
It laid on the ground and made harsh huffing noises. Castiel waited a moment before helping it upright. It looked up at him with wide eyes then tried to hide behind him. Castiel looked at the door to the ship. He wasn't sure if his new pet had just been startled but the sudden noise of the door opening or if his pet had a fear of loud noises.
Dean stuck just about anything in his mouth and rolled around on the floor, that wasn't something to get aroused about.
He counted off seventeen steps and tapped the wall. Nothing happened. He backed up a few steps and tapped again. Still nothing. He went ahead a few steps and tried there but nothing opened.
"If you were just a good pet about brushing your teeth..." Castiel said sadly. Dean hadn't acted up about bath time since he'd been punished but it was obvious to Castiel that bath time was taking its toll on his pet.
They reached the Goodson house when the sun was high overhead. Castiel didn't hear any screaming from inside. He couldn't find it in himself to do anything but hope they weren't too late. He couldn't spite an innocent child either.
He picked Dean up the next night and put him in his bed. He left the pet bed in the bedroom in case Dean acted up.
Castiel snorted in amusement. He would bet his ship that the human's last owner was a Lsserwrat. No one else would name their pet after body fluids.
He was grateful when Rachel was finally nursing, it gave him a moment to wash up and breathe. He peeled off the layers of clothes that had gotten messy and bundled them up, glad that he wore so many layers in fear of milk leaking out of him. He sat down in a nearby chair. He was exhausted. He hadn't thought being a midwife would be exhausting.
The ache in his chest turned cold. Gabriel would be gone. Castiel looked away. He shouldn't be thinking like that. A wedding was something to celebrate, not something to mourn.
fickle. They could turn on the Winchesters at a moment's notice. He held his ground and kept his head high.
Castiel sat up and winced. Daven tossed the used rag at into his lap. Castiel took it and wiped the come from his hole with shaking hands. The rag came back bloody. Castiel trembled and tossed the rag to the floor. He knew some women bled after having sex the first time. He didn't know if omegas did and he didn't know if it happened again the second time.
His master strode out of the bathroom at a slow pace. Dean had to jog to keep up. For every step his master took he had to take three.
Castiel laughed. He thrust his hips up in response. "Me too. Try not to get yourself into more trouble between here and home. I don't want to wait
Castiel swallowed back the pain in his throat that threatened to be a sob. He was sore, his breasts kept leaking, and he had cloth wrapped around his nethers because he was
His master stared at him expectantly. Dean rolled the ball between his hands. His master pet his head again and cooed his name at him.
His grandmother grabbed his wrist and pulled him over anyway. She folded his fingers up and slid two inside Rachel. His eyes went wide.
Castiel studied the baby talk on the door. He had thought that Qech simply had a very unusual taste in decoration but apparently it was for his
Castiel looked his human over. It stared back at him, waiting for a command. Castiel sighed. There was no point in stalling. He should take the human back to his ship and start training it while he was grounded.
Castiel flicked his tail in acknowledgement. It seemed backwards but then, humans had evolved on an unusual planet.
"Keep doing it!" Castiel demanded. He wrapped his legs more tightly around Dean's waist and tried to pull him in closer. "Keep- keep- Ah!"
He wiped at himself furiously but Dean's come kept leaking out. He swore when he realized how dark it was getting. He pulled on his pants. He'd have to walk home with Dean's come still dripping out of him.
His grandmother took the cloth. She dabbed some of the kitchen salve onto it. She held it up. "This is going to hurt almost as much as when it happened." His grandmother warned.
Dean didn't even want to fight it this time. If his master was willing to take him out of the kitchen and away from the outside view he would be happy to sit through another bath.
His master tapped his claws along his chest and studied Dean. Dean jumped in surprise when the second tail curled around his leg. His master made the gentlest sound a giant lizard monster could then slowly reached out and scratched a claw through Dean's hair.
His grandmother let him rest through one more contraction before making him push again. He grunted and screamed and swore as he pushed down for all he was worth. Castiel felt something impossibly wide push against his hole.
Anna stuck her tongue out and took Kali's hand. Hannah took the other one. The two of them dragged Kali off in a whirlwind of whispers and laughter.
He used twice as many sanitizing wipes than what he probably needed to but he couldn't stop worrying about infections. He bathed Dean regularly but
Qech bent his head around to nuzzle his face into his human's chest. He chuffed in delight when his human wrapped its arms around his head. He stuck his tongue out and flicked it across the human's bare stomach. The human squirmed and made pleased sounds.
She rolled her shoulders and pointed two hands at the display next to the humans. "Maybe a siren is more your speed."
His master went to a counter and opened cupboards above it. If Dean stood back a few feet he could just see the top of the counter.
When the priest had come to the schoolhouse to talk about mating they'd both been sent home. They were sirens and shouldn't be tempted. None of the other children had ever said a word about what the priest had talked about and after that day few would talk to them. It wasn't long after that they were both told they shouldn't be in the schoolhouse with the others anymore.
A series of hisses and clicks of claws made him pick up his pace. His master was calling him. He jogged down the rows of crates, careful to avoid stepping on or in anything on the floor. Not for the first time he wished he
A deep sense of relief settled in Castiel's bones. He touched the coins in his pocket. He'd have to buy something to sacrifice. Whatever god it was that favoured him would want their payment.
He kept at it until he was nodding off between each roll of the ball. He must have fallen asleep eventually because the next thing he knew his master was scooping him up and snuggling him in bed.
His thoughts must have shown on his face because his grandmother began explaining while she pulled back the blankets from Rachel's lower half.
He raced back to the kitchen. It was the last place he had seen Dean and the best place to start looking for him. He'd get Dean, carry him back to the ship as fast as possible, finish resupplying, and then never come back to this damned station again.
Dean chattered on as Castiel worked. It had taken a while for him to get used to how much noise Dean made but now that he was used to it, it was rather pleasant.
"My mother wants to talk to you." Sam said. He motioned behind himself, further down to a bend in the alley.
Castiel stared at the purse, bulging with coins. How much money was in that purse? His eyes flicked up to Mary Winchester. "It would." He admitted. "What do you want for it?"
He wasn't going to make that mistake twice. When he went to bed tonight he'd crawl into his master's bed, no matter how he felt about bath time.
Mary Winchester's chest heaved in anger. "How could you do this to a baby? Don't you want her to grow up with her family?"
Dean pressed closer to his master. He knew the ship wasn't shaking apart as it plummeted towards a planet. That was just him shaking in his own skin.
They packed the cart up in silence. Even the small crowd that watched them was silent. When the cart was packed up and their grandmother seated Anna and Gabriel each took an arm of the cart and started to pull.
Castiel picked the shoulder yolk up and held it out for Hannah. "He said he'd never really stop bothering grandma."
They came to the end of another alleyway. The noise of the mob grew louder. Gabriel put his hand up for Castiel to stop. He leaned around the corner to look.
Dean eyed the wall warily. He reached out slowly and tapped it. Nothing happened. His shoulders tightened up. He took a step over, braced himself, and tapped. Nothing happened. He took another step over and did the whole song and dance again.
to market?" The priest's voice was sharp and scathing. He reached across the crates and yanked the hood off Castiel's head before Castiel could jump back. "You think you can bewitch honest mated men into sin, threaten the village with curses, and then simply walk about with the fruits of your sin?"
"I'm gonna be stuck in my room for the rest of the week," Dean complained. He dropped down on top of Castiel and rocked his hips against him. "Probably gonna be thinking about this the whole time."
Dean pouted at him and chattered incessantly while Castiel sanitized his hand. It was far from the first time he had gotten Dean's saliva on him. Dean had a tendency to drool in his sleep. But it wasn't exactly hygienic. It was frankly disgusting. He had seen Dean use his mouth to open things or tear things apart. The plethora of bacteria a human mouth housed was why he brushed Dean's teeth so frequently.
His grandmother made an approving noise and held her hand out for the satchel. Hannah and Anna crowded around her and talked excitedly about the spell work they could learn now that their mother was gone. Gabriel disappeared around the side of the cart. Castiel slipped off the edge of the cart and followed him.
Castiel's grandmother leaned close and whispered, "He's worried but everyone screams like they're being gutted."
"Where is she?" Castiel asked. He peered down the alley. "How do I know you're not trying to rob me too?"
Dean stared down at him like he had declared him god's favoured on a feast day. Dean gulped. He rolled his hips the way Castiel had done. He stopped and shivered. "I didn't think it'd be..."
Castiel watched the still burning bundle on the alter. He looked skyward. He suspected he'd been favoured by Strife. He'd spent nine months finding out all the ways his parents had lied to him, the father of his child had run away instead of mate him, his face was burned with a brand, his muscles head to toe felt pulverized, his stomach sagged under the loose binding his grandmother had helped him into this morning, and his crotch was sticky with blood. Strife had most definitely smiled upon him the day his grandmother had asked for divine favour.
A cold feeling settled into Castiel. His milk had been bringing in enough in traded goods that they weren't always worried about starving. What would they do once Deidre was too old to nurse and his milk dried up?
to masturbate. His mating tail was warm and snug in the sheath, the unfurled opening was safely away from Dean.
"He works with Michael in the mornings but he eats lunch alone," Daven said. He rolled the corner of a sack of flour through his fingers, as if embarrassed to be suggesting Castiel be another man's whore too.
Castiel packed up two crates of their wares then joined his grandmother at the front of the cart. She had Deidre in her lap, dangling a protection charm in front of her to play with.
Dean dropped down to Castiel's chest. He huffed against Castiel's neck. He laughed, a bit hysterically. "Cas." He laughed again. "I didn't think it'd be..."
And he was considering it a bad idea as he stood in the store and watched the humans tear things apart, fight with each other, and make a general ruckus.
His master took his claw out of his mouth and unclipped his leash. He reached out to pet Dean. Dean recoiled from him and his claws.
Evan let go of Castiel's cock in favour of shoving his hands under Castiel's ass. He yanked him up as he thrust in. Castiel's eyes went wide. His back arched as he moaned. Come splattered across Castiel's stomach. Evan grunted out a pleased noise and kept thrusting into him at a frantic pace.
"Yes! Don't stop! God, Dean, don't stop!" Castiel grabbed Dean's face and kissed him. He dragged his tongue over Dean's lips and down his jaw until he was mouthing at Dean's neck. "Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop."
Castiel was seconds from giving up ‒ apparently he was not only terrible for trying to train his pet to do this he was plainly terrible at training his pet ‒ when Dean's tongue darted out and licked delicately at his mating tail.
His master held him in one arm while he made Dean's dinner. When it was ready he carried Dean and the bowl over to the chair. He sat down and shifted Dean to his side. He dipped his tail into the bowl of mush and brought it up to Dean's face.
"They're fine to walk with unprotected feet on most smooth surfaces within temperatures they're comfortable with but otherwise I recommend the foot coverings that we picked out," the store employee said, clipping a collar around the human's neck and adding a leash. She passed the leash to Castiel. "Dean's very well trained to walk on a leash."
The priest grabbed Castiel's arm and jerked him around. He motioned for two of the men to hold him still. They grabbed Castiel's arms and dragged him over to the side of the well. They pushed his head down until his cheek was pressed against the cold damp stone.
"You don't need to be here at all." His grandmother told him. She held out the herbs and salts in a little dish. "Just thought you'd like to do it."
His grandmother stepped in front of him with the baby. She passed the baby to him. "Nurse her for a bit. Rachel needs to rest a moment." Castiel frowned down at the baby in his arms. His grandmother prodded him. "Go on."
"Now I'm civilizing him," Castiel said dryly to the darkness. "Next I'll be one of those people who swear their pets understand them."
Castiel sunk down to the ground and blinked blindly at the side of the wagon. He had cursed Sam Winchester and now he was being run out of the village as an alpha.
His master finished cleaning the bowls from breakfast and dinner. He hissed something at Dean then bent down and picked him up, blanket and all.
bare their teeth in aggression." She stopped scratching the human's jaw and flexed her arm, clicking two spines together to make a sharp click.
"It's okay, Dean," Castiel soothed. He sat down on the bed and pulled Dean into his lap. He dragged his claws lightly over Dean's skin. "Good pet. Good human."
Castiel grabbed the cloak and threw it around himself. He pulled the hood up to hide his face. Gabriel stuck his head out the door. He listened for a moment then waved at Castiel to follow him.
"Got it!" Gabriel bounded back into the room carrying a basket. He set the basket down. He looked between Castiel and his grandmother. "So when do the celebrations start?"
desperate. A little external stimulation wasn't that disgusting really. It would really only be genuinely unsanitary if he let his mating tail unfurl while his pet had his mouth on it; all those human bacteria getting into his reproductive organs.
"Why did I have to come to market?" Castiel asked. He stared dejectedly at the crates that made up their table. "It's so cold. What if Deidre gets sick?"
Dean sighed and relaxed. He pulled the blanket around himself and after a few minutes, went back to sleep. Castiel gave a quiet snort of amusement. He doubted Dean would even remember the incident when he woke up.
He backtracked to the bathroom then started for his master's bedroom. He had been sure the two corridors led to the same place but apparently not.
Dean stared at his nakedness. Castiel did the same. Castiel sucked in a sharp breath as his eyes swept up and down Dean. Dean was perfect. Today was perfect.
He took a left and headed for a cargo hold that had been giving his master trouble since day one. Whatever was in the non-descript yellow boxes in that hold seemed to shift around and move on its own. His master was forever rearranging them and tying them back down. Dean didn't want to know what was inside.
He knew his master had bought him shoes and clothes but apparently he didn't want to bother cleaning them in transit because Dean hadn't been given a single stitch to wear since getting on board his master's ship.
He chattered at Castiel in a rhythm and tone Castiel had come to think of as Dean being pleased with himself.
"Like this." Castiel said. He squirmed until his legs were spread wide and Dean was between them. He rolled his hips up. His cock slid against Dean's stomach. He shivered when it pressed against Dean's cock. "Th-then that."
It didn't sting at all. Not even with the light burn Castiel was used to now. He groaned and wrapped his legs around him. It wasn't anything like being with Daven Hills. His hole was loose and pliant, ready to open up for Evan and let his cock slide in with a rush of slick. Everything inside Castiel lit up with pleasure until Evan's cock was fully sheathed inside him.
Dean gave his mating tail a few more licks before trying to squirm away. Castiel let him. He didn't want Dean to associate the command with anything bad and he wasn't about to let his mating tail unfurl because of a pet. He might be desperate for a bit of physical contact but he wasn't
Castiel could feel his fellow pet owner's eyes lingering on the patches of blue that peaked out from his coveralls but Qech had so far had the courtesy to not ask.
For one fleeting moment the prickle in his skin was satisfied. He sighed and clenched around the wooden cock. He rocked his hips down on it. He pressed his face into the pillows and moaned. It was never enough once he started moving, no matter how hard he chased the feeling.
"He was my friend." Castiel sobbed. "He was my friend and I think I loved him and he ran away as soon as he found out what we had done." He wrapped his arms around his grandmother and cried into her shoulder. "He left me here and now I'm a whore."
Castiel pushed away from the table with a frustrated growl. He stalked into his bedroom and snatched up the wooden cock.
Castiel licked his lips and swallowed hard. He took Daven's cock in his hands and bent his head down. He licked a short wet stripe up the mostly soft cock. His nose wrinkled at the sweaty taste. He slowly drew Daven's cock into his mouth anyway.
The bed bounced with the weight of something being dropped beside him. Dean squirmed around to look. His master had dropped a box of balls beside him. Dean looked up, surprised. His master had never given him any kind of throwing toy before— Dean figured it was probably because projectiles and ships didn't go so well together.
His master growled and clicked his claws then went to his dresser. He pulled out coveralls that he used when he was working on the ship and stepped into them. The coveralls conveniently hid the blue stains on his master too.
"That's it?" Castiel watched the herbs curl up black and turn to ash. "That doesn't seem like much."
He grabbed his own cock with his other hand and started pumping as he thrust the wooden cock in and out of his hole.
Gabriel snorted. "You sound ready to go into fits of happiness." He gave Castiel a gentle slap to his arm. "I get it. I'd be leaving. But we'll still live in the village for most of the year. And I could send money home when we're gone."
Castiel flicked his mating tail in the air and snorted again. He had been so worked up about it. But Dean was a good pet. He knew better without having to be trained not to.
He contacted the Hflip a day before he docked at the station. They messaged each other back and forth, messages coming faster the closer he got. The Hflip's given name was unpronounceable for him. They told him to call them Uth instead and explained Hflip sex in greater detail.
His grandmother let him cry and laugh for a few moments before putting her hands on his stomach and pushing down. "Just a few more, Castiel. The hard part is over."
He kicked his pants off. He didn't have to rub at his hole. He had been loose and slick all day. He reached between his legs and gathered up his slick. He wiped it onto the wooden cock then slid it inside himself with a groan.
His grandmother sighed. "If you stay angry forever, my sweet omega boy, you'll burn up faster than a hay fire."
His grandmother stroked his hair back from his eyes. "I'm sorry, my beautiful omega boy. I'm sorry I let your mother and father raise you."
Castiel hesitated, not sure how to say why he had come. He drew in breath and straightened his shoulders. "I don't want charity."
His master pushed and pulled him into different positions as he wiped him down. The most awkward part was always the last. His master would pick up a little sponge brush with his other tail and jam the brush into his mouth. He had seriously considered biting that second tail more than a few times when his master had shoved the brush in a little too hard.
"Your pets are very well behaved," Castiel complimented. "Dean's not a problem pet but he has his moments. He can be impossible sometimes."
Dean bent down and kissed him again. Castiel shivered as those kisses trailed down from his lips to his neck and back up again. He let his eyes slip closed. No on wonder people enjoyed kissing.
"Oh, don't feel bad. It took me forever to get here." Qech said as he led the way to his lounge. "It got so much easier once I had learned some human and they had learned some Ipix."
Castiel tugged the cloak tighter around himself as if it would stop a mob from dragging him away. He knew it was foolish. The cloak wouldn't stop them. They hadn't minded dragging him through the streets when he was pregnant. They would mind even less now.
Evan laughed and shuffled closer. He leaned over Castiel. He reached between them and guided his cock in.
"Where does he eat lunch?" Castiel asked. He took out the square of cloth he used to wrap up the bread.
Castiel wrapped his arms around him. He squeezed Dean tight with arms and legs. He didn't think he'd ever be able to move again. He yawned against the top of Dean's head. "I wish today would never end."
Castiel bit his lip. Kali's family had influence with the elders but it took money to persuade the priest. And what if Kali said things in favour of them and the priest turned the village on her too? He couldn't do that to Gabriel.
Castiel burst into laughter. He craned his head back further into the grass and smiled up at the sun. Today was perfect. When he went home tonight, he'd make some small trinket to remember it by.
"We aren't trying to steal from you." Sam said. He started down the alley towards his mother. "She just wants to talk."
"Wait!" Mary Winchester called out. She thrust the purse towards him. "Wait! I want to talk about your bride price."
His master passed him a bowl with the same amount he always got. Dean sighed but took it. He'd have to get better at reminding his master to feed him. He knew they weren't on the same day-night cycle for sleeping and from what he could tell they weren't on a similar feeding pattern either. He'd only seen his master eat a handful of times.
There was only one ad from a fellow Helodem on the station. Another spur. A mated rasa-olio pair would be
when it suited them. Michael Goodson was doing just that in the kitchen. His wife was in labour and they couldn't afford the village's doctor so he'd come to the Blackdogs for a midwife.
His grandmother started yelling. Gabriel darted up from the bed. He reached for the door just as it swung open. Mary Winchester burst into the room, his grandmother close behind her.
His master slowly eased closer, like he expected Dean to run away and hide. Dean squinted at him as he tried to figure out what exactly his master was doing. His master had spent weeks tying him up and ignoring him when he gave him something to play with but now he was incredibly interested? This was weirder than that time that his master had just stood statue still in the corridor for hours.
He woke up to his mating tail wrapped tightly around Dean. The warming sheath squished uncomfortably around his mating tail but hadn't let any fluids out.
Evan nodded. He went to the dresser and took out a pouch. He counted out enough coins to buy two generously seized loaves of bread. He set it aside then turned back around to face Castiel. His eyes flicked up and down Castiel again. He huffed and nodded to himself then pulled his shirt off and started undoing his pants.
"You don't have to—" Castiel started but Evan reached for his cock and started stroking. Castiel's back arched up into. Evan didn't relent. He kept stroking Castiel inside and out until he was a desperate writhing mess. It was like that first time with Dean. As if he had to have this. As if he
Castiel glanced between Cepheus and the door. He wanted to push, to try and persuade Cepheus, but he didn't want to put him off either. He'd rather have the small amount Cepheus paid him on occasion than nothing more at all.
Gabriel dropped his side of the cart. Anna yelped. Gabriel spun on his heel and pointed an angry finger at Castiel's grandmother. "No you didn't! Not if you want to eat. Not if you want to stay in your family's home! Not if you don't want the priest bringing another mob to our house to drag you out to the village square!"
"Twice. They thought I was asleep," Castiel said. He had woken up to soft grunts coming from the other bed and had watched in fascination for the briefest moment before tucking his head back under the covers in embarrassment. It was
Dean plastered himself to his leg while Castiel got out a bowl and filled it with just a little human food then reached for the sweet smelling paste that Dean favoured to flavour it.
His grandmother made a dismissive motion, as if what the baker asked for was nothing unusual. She eyed him and the careful way he was sitting on his chair. "He didn't hurt you?"
He watched his sisters take Deidre out into the yard, still talking about leeks. He pressed his hands to the table, wanting to push away and go after them. He didn't want to talk about Daven Hills' leathery hands holding onto his hips. He didn't want to talk about being a whore just like the village said he was.
Evan slammed his hips forward and stilled. He groaned and let his head fall back. He rocked his hips forward lazily and let go of Castiel's ass. He slumped down on top of Castiel and heaved a sigh.
The baker groaned in his ear when his cock finally pushed in all the way. "They say sirens are tight but..." He rocked his hips forward and groaned again. "God's tits they never said
"I think, uh, if you open your mouth a little..." Dean muttered. Castiel opened his eyes to find Dean turning pink above him. Dean nervously bit at his lip. "I saw Gabriel and Kali do it that way. It...they looked like they liked it."
"You can take your pick of the loaves on the cooling rack after." Daven said. He angled his hips. His cock pressed against Castiel's hole. "If you're good you can have two."
He rolled the ball up his arm and popped it off his elbow then caught it. He grabbed two more from the box and tried out juggling. He couldn't do it but his master seemed particularly pleased. The only thing his master liked more was when he tried balancing a ball on his nose.
They both gasped when Dean's cock caught at his asshole. Dean did it again. He bit his lip. He pushed forward. Castiel whined as Dean's cock speared him open. He didn't know if this was part of sex or if they were doing something new and sinful but it set him on fire and made him want to squirm and whine and scream.
"Sure, dude," Dean laughed. He moved his head in tangent with the rubbing. His master did his own weird giant lizard version of smiling. Dean shot a look up at the counter. "Now how about dinner?"
His master turned around and froze when he saw Dean playing with the ball. Dean tensed up. He was doing something wrong. He just knew it. He reached out and carefully put the ball back. Maybe they weren't for him after all.
His grandmother fixed her cloak and started the walk home without so much as a backward glance. Castiel caught up to her in three quick strides, his anger resurfacing. Michael Goodson called him a whore and Deidre a bastard and refused to sell rice to them but they had still come when Rachel needed them. They deserved apologies, not a swift shove out the door.
They circled around to the front of the cart, Castiel did his best to hide the smug smile that wanted onto his face when two children were quickly hushed by their mother for pointing out the whore. He'd nursed their baby sister three days ago.
The crowd murmured in agreement. Castiel felt that hope snuff out. The crowd had turned against him again. He shivered, it had little to do with the early winter. The skin of his stomach crawled.
"In his room," Daven said. He stepped aside, letting Castiel past him to the cooling racks. "He lives out of the Silver Head. Off the main street."
unsanitary. He had just given Dean a bath and brushed his teeth. His pet's mouth would be as clean as it would ever be. And it wasn't as if his pet would think it was degrading, he was only a pet.
She shot an apologetic look at the baker. "He's teething!" She yelled over Adam Winchester's screams. "Sorry!"
Castiel lazily pushed down. His grandmother coaxed him through it until a wet feeling passed out of him. His grandmother wrapped whatever it was in a cloth and set it aside before placing a cool cloth against his hole.
When he woke the next morning he didn't feel any better for having snubbed his master. He was cold and achy from sleeping on the couch instead of in his master's warm bed. He should have known better. He had been just as achy that time his master had banished him to the couch for a week.
Castiel knew his pet was probably no more intelligent than most humans but with nothing else to focus on during a shipment it was hard not to be endlessly amazed at all the commands Dean could remember.
He had Dean in his lap and the bowl in his hand when he hesitated. Why was he still doing this? Dean was a pet. And he was training him to lick his mating tail. Revulsion rippled through him as he realized just how disgusting it really was. He was putting his mating tail in pet food and then letting his pet put its saliva all over him. When he put it that way he wasn't sure what he was more disgusted by. His pet's mouth? Or the pet food?
Two of them were nowhere near sexually compatible with him and one, after he read up on the species and their sex acts, would probably result in his death even if he was careful.
For one brief moment the empty feeling disappeared. His gut twisted up in anger. Wasn't yesterday payment
"Nothing to worry about." His grandmother said. She smiled faintly. Whatever it was it had to have been cruel. "She left. She isn't coming back."
cuddling up with his master— he always had to watch out for claws. He'd rather cuddle up with other humans or some of the furry pets his other masters had kept. But he had gotten used to wrapping an arm around his master's leg and the way his master's tail would wrap around him.
"He's a siren and a witch!" John shouted. He locked eyes with Castiel. "He put me under a spell and seduced me!" He turned to the crowd. "You all know the Blackdog women are witches! They had David Milton under their spell for years! He's no better!"
Dean touched the collar. "Okay. So you're not getting rid of me." He gave his master's leg a quick hug then grabbed the other human's hand and let himself be led into the home of a dragon. He craned his head over his shoulder and called back to his master, "See you later, alligator!"
He was expecting another unplanned treat for doing absolutely nothing when his master called him over to the bed. But instead of another green cookie his master had a collar waiting for him.
It was probably a weird fetish. He wrinkled his nose. Was he agreeing to something depraved by Hflip standards?
He heard his father march to his room. His father didn't knock. He pushed the door open and came in.
feeding session for breakfast. His master got all nervous about it and practically shoved him off his lap halfway through and raced out the door.
Castiel reached out and slung his arms around Dean. He tugged him closer and leaned back into the grass. He pulled Dean down on top of him.
"You didn't mean it." Gabriel said. "You didn't mean to actually curse the priest. And Castiel didn't mean he wanted to curse the village either." Gabriel wiped sweat from his forehead despite the cool winter air.
Dean pulled back. His face was bright red. He stared down at Castiel's chest. "Does that...did we..." Dean bit his lip. He flicked his eyes up to Castiel's. "Was that sex?"
All Dean did was stare at him and chatter for a few minutes before curling around his legs and going to sleep. He didn't make a move to touch Castiel's mating tail. He didn't start trying to mate with the blankets or the mattress. Dean just wanted to sleep somewhere warm.
Then a couple of days ago he had woken up to his master's second tail bandaged up and wrapped around him. Ever since then his master had been happy to pet him with it and give him extra snacks almost every time he begged for them.
Dean wondered if he had accidentally alerted his master to a tumour or something in his second tail like those stories about dogs back on Earth. The thought made him laugh every time. He was happy to let his master think he had intentionally saved his life if it meant getting fed on time.
Castiel reached over and pulled Dean into his lap. Maybe Dean hadn't understood the command because he associated it with being in his lap.
Four days out from his next stop Castiel knew he had a problem. He was holding the used warming sheath, filled with mating fluids and semen from a night's worth of use, and staring at a still sleeping Dean. One thought was rolling around in his head: if he offered his mating tail to Dean would he lick his mating tail clean.
His master crawled into bed. He tapped the wall above the top of the bed. The light dimmed to near absolute darkness.
Mary Winchester put him off again. The baker huffed in anger. He came around the counter and picked Adam Winchester up. Castiel watched out of the corner of his eye as the remaining loaf of bread on the counter disappeared into Sam Winchester's jacket.
Castiel drowsily accepted the water and mouthed at a lump of bread. He was just so tired. He felt his eyes sink shut. He dozed in and out of consciousness as his grandmother and Gabriel took care of things.
"I fed Dean before we left," Castiel said. He reached into a pocket on his coveralls to pull out a small package of dental treats. "But I have some treats for him to snack on."f
Dean bit his lip and looked over the tools on the floor. He carefully picked up the stabilizer and dragged it over to Castiel.
The next morning he woke up with Dean wrapped around his leg and his mating tail exactly where he had left it.
"That's what an aggressive show will look like," the employee said. She clicked her spines again. The human relaxed. "The lips only pull up in front. You actually see less teeth."
"Or I guess we can keep doing this," Dean said dryly. He leaned in and licked the other half of the mush up.
Castiel stared out from under his hood. He narrowed his eyes at the loaf of bread on the counter. It was the smallest one and should cost half as much as what the baker was asking for. He swallowed down the loathing that boiled up in his stomach. Anger had been the first thing to find its way back inside him once he had stopped feeling empty.
He remembered reading a book or two that featured dragons when he had still been just a kid on earth. He had thought dragons sounded cool back then and that it would be
Castiel stroked his pet's head then tapped his claws on his chest again. Another wave of guilt washed through him as a thought occurred to him, Dean was only a pet and didn't understand how people mated but pets could be trained.
His master's head tucked down. The green-yellow of his eyes turned more yellow than green. He shifted Dean off the soft spot on his belly then cradled his dagger tail around Dean.
A quiet cough from behind him caught his attention. He turned to find Brianne Shields, the butcher's wife, peaking around from behind the cart. Castiel looked between her and Anna. He sighed and went to Brianne. She'd had twins and as well as the butcher fed his family she simply didn't make enough milk for both babies.
He filled Dean's bowl as he usually did and was halfway to his chair with his pet in tow when he stopped. Dean was being excessively clingy. Would he only be encouraging Dean to continue the behaviour if he kept training him at meal times?
Dean gulped. He grabbed at the hem of his shirt and pulled it off. He crawled off Castiel to squirm out of his pants while Castiel did the same.
Dean curled into his master's bony chest and sobbed in relief. He wasn't going to waste away on a dead ship.
His grandmother made a throaty noise. She took his cloak down and tossed it around his shoulders. She looked up into his face. "This is part of being a Blackdog."
Castiel thrust up again. Dean rocked his hips down. Castiel could feel a mess of pre-come starting to form on their bellies. He groaned at the slide of cocks over his stomach. He hadn't thought it'd be like this either. His skin sparked at Dean's touch, his cock ached to be held, his heart pounded in his chest, and a fire burned deep in his gut.
He followed Qech into his kitchen and kept his opinions on Qech's bizarre choice in decorations to himself— there was Oueyi baby talk covering his doors and walls. The humans chattered among themselves. Dean was surprisingly exuberant in his chattering. Not that his pet was lethargic on his ship but he had never seen Dean
He went back to the bedroom to find Dean where he left him. He stared down at his human and tried to think of a way to train him not to touch his mating tail. He came up with a blank. Dean had never shown interest in touching his mating tail before and unless Dean started showing an interest in it Castiel wasn't sure how to train him to not touch it.
Dean breathed deep before nodding. He leaned in. Castiel opened his mouth. Dean took the invitation. A groan tore from Castiel's throat. He never imagined that kissing would feel like this. Gabriel had never explained and he wasn't about to ask his grandmother.
Castiel stood awkwardly before the little family alter in their snow dusted garden the day after Deidre was born. Dean Winchester had runaway instead of taking him as his mate and now he would raise Dean's bastard while he was branded as a whore. Castiel had thought he'd feel...
Dean huffed a soft laugh against Castiel's neck. "Me too." He nuzzled his nose against Castiel's neck. "Did you have this all planned? Take me up the mountain and sweet talk me into giving up our virginity together? Dean, you're a hairy monster, now kiss me."
He flicked his eyes open before his head could start playing the re-runs of being shoved into a clear crate ‒ all so giant monsters could see the contents ‒ and that horrible growl of a cargo door opening into empty black. The monsters had shoved crate after crate out into the nothing on entry orbits then closed the cargo door behind them.
Dean snuffled in his sleep. Castiel draped his bladed tail over Dean. Dean sighed and snuggled closer. Castiel snorted in amusement. How had he been afraid of his own pet? His little speckled human was anything
harming his pet to just wrap his mating tail around him for a little bit. If Dean didn't like it or was being hurt he knew the human wasn't afraid to bite him in retaliation. The swelling in his mating tail from a bite would be his own fault if it happened.
Anna and Hannah were quick to push away from the table and head out the door. Castiel's shoulders slumped as he sank deeper into his seat. He let out a long sigh then picked up a cold piece of toast.
Dean huffed and slinked away to go sit on his pet bed and feel hard done by. Castiel flicked both his tails in dry amusement. His pet was truly spoiled. He had gotten
The priest glowered at her. He looked between Castiel's grandmother and Adam Winchester. "It seems to me that you're taking misguided vengeance on the Winchesters by beating their youngest."
He finished up in the bathroom then went in search of his master so he could start begging for breakfast.
Castiel slipped the coins into his pocket first then took the glass. He gulped the water down, washing the taste of come from his mouth.
He'd been careful to keep away from it after that. He didn't want to give his master a reason to think he'd attack him.
Castiel moved to sit up. He had a warming sheath stuffed into the back of his dresser. It was a poor substitute for mates but he could shove his mating tail into that and grasp the soft fake egg at the bottom and not have to feel guilty about abusing his pet or worry about getting some disease from him.
Evan sat up. Castiel could feel his eyes play over him. Evan stood and took his lunch from the dresser. He sat back down on the bed. "Maybe in a week or two. I'll get Daven to tell you when."
Dean's stomach was growling by the time his master decided to get up. Dean wriggled off his master's lap and kept the outside view blocked from his sight with the blanket.
"You're not going to come back nine months later and demand a bride price and a mating bite?" Daven asked him.
bleeding three days later. All because no one in the village had deigned to tell him what he was but now - now that he was exhausted and ruined - everyone was glad to do it.
"You'll come." His grandmother said. She took her cloak from a peg on the wall. "An omega is just as good of a midwife as a beta woman. It's time you learned about labour from the other side."
A light filmy blanket settled over him. His master hissed something long. Dean caught his name at the end of it. Dean turned his head to his master. Two green-yellow eyes stared down at him. There was more hissing. His master tapped Dean's head with one claw and hissed again.
It bared its teeth at him. Castiel jerked back and arched his bladed tail. He'd read about human bites. Their mouths were disease ridden. Left untreated a human bite could cause some of the worst infections.
Mary Winchester and chased after the baker telling him to put her son down. Sam Winchester followed after them. Castiel shoved his bread into his satchel and hurried out; tugging at his hood as he went. He didn't want to be there when the baker realized a loaf was missing.
Castiel opened his mouth to ask what his grandmother meant but the question died on his lips. He knew. His father had abandoned them and now his mother had too.
At the end of the day he fed Dean again then carried him to the bathroom for a bath. He knew his pet would try to avoid baths if he could. Making sure he was sleepy with food and carrying him to it made things go smoother.
Castiel squeezed the opening of his mating tail around the fake egg at the bottom of the warming sheath. A little rush of pleasure raced through him. Dean squirmed as his mating tail flexed around him.
The priest and three men marched past the alley shouting. Two men followed after them dragging a bound and struggling Sam Winchester between them.
Dean didn't hesitate at the command. He jogged along beside his master grateful to be off the damn ship.
Gabriel shoved the door open. "Gran! It's happening!" Gabriel called out. "Auntie, take the girls to Kali's mother!"
"Gran's waiting for you." Gabriel said. He pulled one of Castiel's arms over his shoulder. "She's got your bed ready. She was dead set your baby was coming today."
The store employee gave Dean one last scratch to the jaw then congratulated Castiel on his new pet before hurrying away to help the next customer.
Castiel's eyebrows furrowed. Gabriel was avoiding something but he couldn't put his thumb on what. He looked down at his chest. The scarf his grandmother had stuffed into his jacket had stopped any wet patches from showing through.
"You were spying on my cousin?" Castiel teased. He trailed his fingers up and down Dean's back. "Did they catch you?"
His master hissed again and rubbed his knuckle on Dean's cheek right where there was still a blue smudge that hadn't come off. His master made a grumbly noise. Dean looked down at himself again. The pants and shirt hid the rest of the blue stains.
Castiel pet him for a few more moments before gently lifting him off his lap and placing him on the bed. He made sure the blanket was tucked in around him before leaving him to sleep.
Castiel nodded as he adjusted his shirt. He combed his fingers through his hair, checking for any stray carrot.
A soft hiss woke him up hours later. Dean jerked upright. The blanket tangled around his limbs. He kicked and thrashed against it and ended up on the floor.
He hated it every time. He didn't want to go back to the bakery next week but he knew he'd have to if he didn't want his family to starve.
"Gabriel said they talked about it." Castiel sat down beside her. He reached out to stroke Deidre's wisps of hair. "Maybe in the fall."
Gabriel strode over and took him by the arm. He led Castiel to their shared bedroom. "Stay here," he said then closed the door in Castiel's face.
Evan breathed heavy against his ear before finally pushing himself up. Castiel hissed as he pulled his cock out. Come and slick dripped from his hole. Evan sat back on his knees and looked down at the come on Castiel's stomach.
Castiel's mother took one look at Castiel and hurried the girls out of the house. His grandmother grabbed his other arm and helped Gabriel haul him to his room.
Anna glanced over at him but didn't say anything. Hannah's story about finding a grove of leeks stuttered but continued. His grandmother stared.
Castiel's eyebrows furrowed. Of course it was their house. It was the Goodson house and Michael Goodson lived there.
"Ow!" Castiel flinched. Deidre never latched on so hard. He pulled the baby back from his breast and shuffled her around. He tried again. It still hurt but not as much.
Castiel felt tears burn at the corners of his eyes. Of course it was how it was supposed to be. Everyone said terrible things about whores and omegas and how awful it was to be one. And they were right.
His grandmother let out a growl from deep in her throat. "You know damn well John Winchester isn't an honest man and you know damn well that it wasn't him that got Castiel with child!" His grandmother shouted. "I should curse
He dressed silently. Every shift of his legs made him wince. He hobbled over to the cooling rack on shaking legs and took the two largest loafs. They didn't fit into his satchel. He wrapped them up in his cloak and limped home.
"He did," his father growled. "He's a little thief like the rest of his family!" His father snorted in disgust. "Well there's nothing to do for it now." He turned on his heel and strode from the room. He slammed the door shut behind him.
Castiel balked. It was just an infant still. He wasn't sure what was worse. An old pet or a too young pet.
"Yeah. I'm awesome," Dean said sarcastically. He reached over and wrapped an arm around his master's leg. He got fed faster if he was affectionate back. "As thrilling as the ball-stick thing is maybe it's time for breakfast?"
"They want you to hide. They want you to be ashamed of who you are and what's happened. Don't let them have that." She tilted his head up and looked him in the eye. Castiel felt like he was falling into two endless expanses of sky. He could believe his grandmother was a witch by her eyes alone. She put on a steeled look, "Hold your head high and look them in the eye so they remember who you are and what they did to you. This is their shame, not yours."
"They just can't make the sounds or thoughts to speak." Qech curled his hulking form onto a large pillow in the corner and motioned for Castiel to choose a chair that fit his own shape. "That's why they use their hands mostly. They're visual speakers."
His master snorted at him. Two long claws lifted the blanket off him. Dean looked up and had never been happier to see a giant lizard monster in his life. He scrambled to his feet and flung his arms around his master's legs.
It didn't take long for the bolder humans in the bunch to drag him into a hug then start tugging him along to a tiny clearing in the broccoli trees and showing him how to get lunch from the food dispenser.
It took Dean three days to realize the ship hadn't been damaged. He had been punished for snubbing his master.
Dean made a desperate embarrassed noise and started to pull away. "I'm such an idiot. I don't know anything."
Dean hated it ‒ he had gotten clawed by accident the first few times ‒ but it usually meant his master was happy about whatever he'd done. Not to mention he didn't have to stand around and guess where the doors were. His master just carried him through. It was worth putting up with.
He sat down on the bed and started to roll the warming sheath on. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned to find Dean watching him roll the sheath on. He froze with his hands on his mating tail. Dean was watching him getting ready to masturbate. A sharp thrill went through him. Was all the training finally working?
about it when it was all said and done but mostly he just felt empty. It was all rather anticlimactic for nine months of pregnancy and village rumours.
Castiel hissed as he sat down for breakfast. He shifted on his seat but couldn't ease the pain. He leaned to his side. A bolt of pain shot through him making him flinch.
his daughter a great deal more when she wasn't splattering food everywhere and throwing up on him. Or pulling his hair out.
The employee led him back to the one that had curled up into a frightened ball. No amount of coaxing could get it to come closer to Castiel. They tried another that had seemed mildly interested in Castiel but it ultimately had just wanted to be fed.
managed to teach Dean to recognize the names of tools." Castiel would admit that much but not something as outlandish as what Qech was claiming. "But that's a far cry from
"Guess you weren't lying after all. Looks like that Winchester boy's little omega cock wasn't big enough to take your purity." Daven said. He grabbed a rag and cleaned his cock off then started pulling on his clothes. "Hurry up and get dressed, I want you out of here long before I open."
Dean didn't even seem to mind that Qech's human was pulling him along by his hand. From Castiel's experiences at bath time he knew Dean hated having his hands immobilized.
"I don't mind so much." Castiel said. He had thought he'd be angry forever about what had happened to him but once spring had come he found he wasn't. He knew what the village said about him was a lie. And besides, half the women in the village had asked him to nurse their children. If they wanted his milk they'd treat him with more respect.
''You mean she won't know the village calls her father a whore." Castiel growled. "I'm not a whore." He kicked the loaf of bread towards her. "Or a thief. And I'm certainly not a
His pet yawned and sleepily chattered at him. He pulled his blanket tighter around himself and snuggled himself against Castiel's leg. Castiel snorted gently at the innocence of his pet then went back to the warming sheath. His bladed tail twitched when his pet's small hand reached over his leg and touched the warming sheath.
He wanted to go out. He could trade for their food and spell supplies, put the feeling under his skin to good use. He knew how to do it right now. He could do it. He'd feel better and they'd have dinner on the table.
His grandmother poked his side. "Get your cloak on. Anna will take care of DeeDee while we're busy."
His grandmother watched the blood drip into the bowl. She nodded when she deemed it enough. She let his hand go. She tossed the contents of the bowl into the fire.
While the humans ate, Qech offered advice on how to make bath time easier for Dean. There were a few things that Castiel thought would work ‒ not waiting until his pet was practically falling asleep and to let Dean investigate the brushes and wipes outside of the bathroom ‒ but there were other things that were utterly absurd. He wasn't about to let his pet clean himself or decide when bath time should be. If he let Dean pick bath time his little speckled pet would be speckled with dirt instead of spots.
He stretched and groaned. He muttered to himself about the couch but his aches and pains were his own fault this time. His master had wanted him to sleep in the bed. He had chosen the stupid couch instead.
Castiel didn't indulge him often, he didn't want to overfeed his pet, but the occasional treat wasn't harmful.
Hannah looked between their grandmother and the priest. A smile ghosted across her lips. "Possibly, sir." She held up the letter opener. "Did you perhaps forget selling him this?"
Gabriel peeled her hand from Adam Winchester's coat and shoved him towards the priest. "I think one of your flock is lost. Why don't you see him to his parents?"
It was harmless really. Dean was fed and happy each time ‒ he was still confused about Castiel's mating tail outside of meal time ‒ and he got to enjoy some pleasant time with his pet.
Castiel cast a sharp glare at Michael Goodson. How did he think he'd fool them into thinking all he had was one gold chain as payment?
Castiel didn't think Dean's face could get any redder but Dean proved him wrong. Castiel worried he might catch fire.
It was his first heat since Deidre had been born and it had come on like a plague two days earlier. The first day had been subtle. He'd felt feverish but excitable, like he'd been drinking all day. He thought it was just the heat of the summer but the next day his grandmother had dug out a box from a cupboard and gave it to him.
Castiel did his best to keep his demeanour blandly pleasant. From the messages they had exchanged in the last day he knew well enough that Qech was a
He checked his watch. He could find another store tomorrow. He still had time. He sighed to himself. If he left here today without one he'd never work himself back up into looking at them again and then eventually he'd lose his mind on one of his long deliveries and his therapist would use him as an example to his future patients of the dangers of touch deprivation.
He spent the rest of the day testing the commands he had taught Dean in the morning. Dean happily obeyed and only once brought him the wrong thing. Castiel wasn't too hard on him. He wasn't entirely sure Dean could hear the whole word. Part of it was right at the lower range of human hearing. He modified the command after that and Dean didn't have any more problems with it.
At the last turn before the door to the cargo hold Dean started counting his steps. The door was about seventeen steps from the turn. He had tried making marks on the walls to show where the doors were but nothing ever stayed. The marks were always gone in a couple of hours.
His grandmother stood and went to the cupboards. She took out a bowl and ingredients. "You were in heat the first time. That's why it didn't hurt. When you're in heat it doesn't take much at all to make slick. A little bit of kissing should get your pants wet."
"I gotta run," Dean said and did just that. He took off down the mountainside, stumbling in the dark and cursing his poor family for not being able to afford shoes.
Even inanimate objects or other animals. And tentatively worried about human mating cycles. The procedure done at the shop had sterilized Dean but it didn't alter his body's hormonal systems. Which meant he'd been letting a fully sexually developed human in the prime of their breeding life sleep in his bed. And humans would mate with anything.
"Third room on the left." Cepheus waved distractedly towards the hall. He didn't ask why Castiel was there.
When Qech's pets were done eating they carefully stacked their bowls beside the counter then took Dean's hands and pulled him over to play.
Castiel sat down on the floor and leaned against his bed. His pants were soaked and come was still leaking from him.
His grandmother prodded him out of his shock and set him to work. By midafternoon they had delivered a baby and the after birth. Castiel was exhausted and felt disgusting. He hadn't realized how much blood and shit was involved in labour; his grandmother and Gabriel had cleaned away everything before he'd noticed.
Castiel stared and shivered. He was sorry for that too. They'd kept everything hidden from him. They had listened to the priest and told him nothing so he wouldn't be tempted. Now look where he was because he didn't know what a heat was and had never before heard the word slick until Gabriel had shouted it in front of the fireplace.
of his grandmother's walking stick made them snap their heads around. The high pitched wail of a child filled the air.
Conflict tore at Castiel's mind. He had been training Dean to do this. This was what he had intended all along. But now that he was faced with the results of his training he wasn't sure he could do it. It was perverted and unsanitary. He needed to come to his senses. He should tell Dean
"You're a noisy little thing," Evan commented, grinning. He pulled out and snapped his hips forward, making Castiel groan again. "Daven didn't mention that." He started thrusting at a steady pace, slowly picking up speed. He reached between them and stroked Castiel's cock. "Or does he not bother with you at all?"
Dean squirmed in his master's arms. The blue stuff staining his master's arms was sticky and smelt like tomatoes. At least, Dean thought it was tomatoes. He hadn't smelt tomatoes since before he'd been grabbed off Earth.
The store employee let out another hiss of amusement. "Twenty eight is roughly thirty percent of its life span. They only live to about one hundred."
No one mentioned their bad luck at the market as they unpacked the cart at home. No one mentioned it when they ate the last of the bread. No one mentioned it when they came home the next day, exhausted from collecting plants.
His head kept playing Dean licking his hand over and over and how close his mating tail had come to Dean's mouth in the past. He could feel the scales of his back try to rise up again. He twisted in bed and pushed them back down. His mating tail twitched. He wrapped it tightly around his bladed tail.
The angry red flush left his grandmother's face. She shook her head and cursed at herself. She sighed sadly.
His master pulled his upper half out of the hole in the wall. His face did a weird spasm that Dean thought was probably a good thing. He reached down and rubbed the back of Dean's neck with his knuckles.
His grandmother heaved a sigh and looked up to Castiel. "It's a start." She tossed the silver needle into the fire. "And there's a bit more but one day you'll pay for the rest."
His grandmother pat his knee. "We'll finish up with your face then get you as comfortable as we can."
He pressed his face harder into his master. His master snorted and stroked his side. Dean snaked his arms around his master. He hated taking comfort from masters but he didn't have anyone else.
know?" Castiel repeated. He smiled cruelly at her. "I'm a whore, Mary." He reached up to brush his fingers delicately over edges of the W branded on his cheek. "I've been on my back for so many men and alphas..." He shrugged. "How could I possibly know which one had the honour?"
Castiel wanted to crush the tiny flicker of hope in his chest. "...did Dean come back?" What if Dean had changed his mind? What if Dean had realized what he'd done?
"Now what?" Dean asked. He glanced down at Castiel's cock standing up from a thatch of dark hair. "...when animals do it they...they
His grandmother nodded. She snapped the chain into two pieces and handed the smaller half back to Michael Goodson.
"Fuck," Dean swore. He pushed more. His thighs shook. His cock pushed further in. "Fuck. Fuck, is this...?"
It was evening by the time his grandmother patted his arm and told him she'd done what she could for his face.
Castiel closed his eyes and sighed. "Nothing." He opened his eyes and stared down at his half eaten porridge. "The same thing he does every time."
Gabriel made a disgusted noise and waved his hand at the cart and their family. "Look where our pride got us? Look what our pride did to Cassie." He shook his head and went back to the front of the cart. He picked up the arm and motioned for Anna to do the same. He heaved the cart forward; dragging all their worries with him.
"It's biologically male. So it's a little more maintenance than a female but don't let that discourage you," the employee said as she tallied the bill. "All humans are rather easy to take care of once they're out of the juvenile stage."
it. It felt weird and it tasted funny and his master never seemed to realize he was jamming it in too far and too hard.
A gush of slick flooded out of him. He groaned again. He knew the wooden cock wouldn't really help. He'd get a few moments of relief and then be right back to where he was. It wasn't worth having to face down his family after knowing they had all heard him screaming from a fake cock.
Castiel flinched at the sound of his voice. "I'm not‒ I mean‒" Castiel stopped himself and took a breath. "Evan Fawkes. I'm looking for Evan Fawkes."
The other human blinked at him. He mouthed what Dean had said. He scrunched his nose. "Is blue. Are you. Is blue. Are you." He shrugged at Dean. "Grandmother..." He stopped and did a series of hand motions. He said a few things in Ipix and looked at Dean expectantly.
Castiel froze in the doorway to the kitchen. He had found Dean. And he was busy slobbering his mouth all over one of the other human's genitals.
"We can find something else if you don't want to keep paying in trade," his grandmother said. She pat his knee. "But if you do keep doing it you have to get yourself ready first."
But Gabriel was wrong too. Castiel had meant the curses he'd uttered. He'd meant them with every bone in his body.
Castiel chewed and swallowed and didn't taste a thing. He kept his eyes on the crates. "I didn't ask to be an omega."
The baker didn't say anything. Silence dragged on between them. Castiel took a step back. This was the only idea he had left to feed his family and it was a terrible idea. What if Daven Hills went to the priest after?
They crept through back alleys and only dared to use main streets when there was little other choice. Castiel could hear the sounds of a mob rumbling over the rooftops. Whatever had happened the priest had managed to rouse most of the village.
Castiel reached up and framed his face with his hands. He let Dean push his tongue into his mouth and explore. He sighed when Dean pulled back.
He picked his way down the mountainside. He did his best to avoid rocks and roots but still managed to cut his foot open and stub his toes. It was just his luck that such a perfect day was going to end with him in wet pants, a bloody foot, and stubbed toes.
Castiel snorted in amusement. His grandmother and Gabriel fought from time to time but more often than not it turned into affectionate teasing.
The village had come to life while he had been at home. He did his best to disappear into the bustle of the street.
"Thank you," Castiel said. He hurried down the hall, grateful to be out of sight of Cepheus even if he had never bothered to look up.
Dean gave the disk between his master's claws a sniff. It smelt like it was probably food. He gave it a quick lick before taking it from his master. He groaned. It
He scrubbed the brush over Dean's teeth, happy that Dean was obeying again, when he felt the scales along his back rise up.
Castiel watched him for a moment before deciding this meant he should undress too. He wriggled out of his clothes and left them in a heap beside the bed. He sucked two fingers into his mouth then reached around to rub at his hole. He knew how to get himself ready fast. Daven never wanted to wait long.
Castiel sighed at the pathetic look on his pet's face. He went over and scratched his claws through Dean's hair. Dean chattered weakly at him and leaned into it. Castiel untied the leash then bent down and picked Dean up. Dean curled into his chest and chattered softly.
warm body. His pet that didn't know any better. Dean probably just thought it was some new show of affection.
It did not surprise Castiel at all that he was soon following her through the store with an ever increasing pile of things for the care of humans.
Gabriel flinched and turned red. Castiel had never seen him look embarrassed before. He kicked at the ground and ducked his head.
Sam Winchester blinked as if he were surprised, as if Castiel hadn't called the Winchesters thieves and liars in the village square. A bubble of anger writhed inside Castiel. He had called John Winchester a thief in the village square and John Winchester had called him a whore but only one of them had been branded.
His grandmother came back around with a small pouch of sunflower seeds. She dropped a handful into her mouth. She offered some to Castiel. She shoved the pouch at him until he took some.
Gabriel came home at noon with Castiel's sisters and a worried look on his face. He shook his head at Castiel's grandmother. Castiel looked to the door and frowned. It sunk in what Gabriel wasn't saying. His mother was refusing to come home. She had probably demanded that he leave. She already blamed him for his father leaving.
Gabriel's laughing quieted down. He squeezed Castiel's shoulder. "What was Kali going to talk to the elders about?"
Once Castiel had the warming sheath on he laid back in bed. He motioned for Dean to lay down beside him. Dean hesitated for a moment before slowly cuddling against his leg. Castiel reached down and scratched Dean's head.
His grandmother turned his head back. She unwrapped her scarf and fussed with it until she had it tucked into Castiel's jacket; sheltering Deidre and soaking up the milk that leaked from his breasts.
Dean chattered at him, worried and confused from what Castiel could tell. Castiel sighed. His pet didn't understand what he had done. Punishing him for it would only confuse him more. Dean probably wouldn't make the connection between the punishment and touching his mating tail.
Castiel backed up. He remembered his grandmother doing that to him but he hadn't cared at the time. He'd just been so mad at all the pain. But he wasn't in pain now. He couldn't stick his fingers into Rachel Goodson's cunt. They used to buy rice from the Goodsons.
He rubbed at his face as he ambled down the corridors to the bathroom. He eyed the counter where his master gave him baths while he took a leak. If his master would just let him brush his own damn teeth...
Castiel tugged his shirt on the rest of the way. He had bread for the week. The hens were laying better now that the days were longer. He'd go with his family to gather plants from the woods later today. They wouldn't starve.
Mashed carrot splattered up Castiel. He sighed and wiped carrot from his face while Anna and Hannah laughed.
"It'll be a while yet before we have another Blackdog." His grandmother said. "We need to clean your face up in the meantime."
He looked down at himself. The shirt was solid pale orange with long sleeves and the pants were yellow with a purple pattern on them that Dean had seen often enough to know it was the store logo for the pet store he had been in. They were boring in comparison to what his last master had bought for him but he wasn't going to complain. It was the first time he had been dressed all year.
He felt Dean go limp against him. Castiel squeezed the egg again for another burst of pleasure. Dean chattered at him. It was obvious Dean didn't understand what he was doing but he wasn't upset. He shifted his mating tail around Dean until he found a warmer place to press against his pet.
Castiel tried not to squirm. It felt strange to have Evan's fingers flex inside him. Evan slowly withdrew them then pushed them back in. He pressed his fingers up and dragged them across that odd little bump inside that Castiel had discovered not so long ago.
The second tail unwound from his shoulders to pick up the bowl from the counter. Dean gently took the bowl from his master's second tail and got another
"You cursed the whole village and John Winchester." His grandmother stopped to spit on the name. "A curse always costs, Castiel. You don't get them for free. And if you're not careful you can get caught up in them."
Castiel tugged at Dean's hands, guiding them under his shirt. He swore he could hear the slide of Dean's hands over the fine barely-there hair on his chest. Castiel whimpered. He tugged at his shirt until he had his arms out and the shirt pushed around his neck.
She pat his shoulder. "There, DeeDee's fine." She sat down beside him on the edge of their cart. She rolled the walking stick she kept for market across her lap. Its main use was for smacking thieves. She tapped her fingers on it. "You're sad."
"Babes aren't fussy about breasts." His grandmother said. She went back to work, cleaning up and saying spells over the afterbirth.
Mary Winchester glared at him before she spun on her heel and left. Gabriel followed after her and yelled at her from the kitchen door.
Cas checked the time again and he had thirty minutes before he had to leave, great. He finished putting away the clothes he’d pulled out and went to the kitchen to give it a good wipe down. Surely, that would waste some time and use up some of his pent up energy. Finally, it was time to go. He grabbed his keys, wallet, and phone and headed out to his truck.
When Castiel’s overprotectiveness carries over into the bedroom, once again Dean balks and sulks like a teenage girl.
“Well, I’m glad you weren’t punching the wall this time, anyway. I’ll take a look at your lamp if you want.” Sam offers.
“Yeah, but Claire’s room is already a mess, just like home.” Dean laughs as Claire gives him a stone-cold stare, which he catches on camera for Sam. “Well, we’re about to head to breakfast then down to the beach. I’ll talk to you later, Sammy. We’ll be sure to call you on Christmas morning too.”
“I am surprised, Ishim.” Cas, still standing holding his gym and messenger bags and a bag of take-out, answers quite dumbfounded, attempting to assess Ishim's mood. He looks at the sack in his hand and motions to the kitchen, “I’m just going to set this stuff down.”
The cat looks up at Dean then stretches out on the bench, giving him more surface area to pet. Dean does as the little cat wants and gives him a good belly rub. He smiles when he feels an energetic vibration coming from the cat, and he knows it means the cat is purring and he’s made the little creature happy. He pets the cat until the little guy has had enough and suddenly leaps off the bench and walks away, tail high in the air. Dean shakes his head and laughs, signing “You’re welcome” to the cat.
They finish getting dressed, Castiel, Dean, and Jack wearing shirts with their swim trunks, and Claire with her suit under her sundress. Cas makes sure that everyone has fruit with their breakfast (which Dean absolutely does not grumble about) so that everyone is well hydrated for the morning at the beach. After they finish eating they walk down the winding path to the beach. Dean and Cas slather both the kids in sunscreen before turning their attention to each other. Castiel turns and smacks Dean’s arm lightly when Dean makes a crude joke under his breath whilst rubbing in the white cream on Castiel’s back.
He kept thinking about the evening ahead, would he and Dean be alright? And why the hell had he chosen Harvelle’s? He knows that Dean loves how the waitresses wear short-shorts and low-cut, tight shirts. God, he’s an idiot, Dean will probably end up ogling that pretty blond waitress again. No, come on Castiel, you have to have more faith in him than that, besides it’s too late to change the location now. This could be a good way to see if Dean is serious about their relationship. That’s one of the biggest complaints Cas has always had about their time together, that Dean treated him like a second thought when they were out in public. When they were alone together, there was no problem whatsoever - Dean was completely focused on Cas. In other words, the sex was to die for. Cas pushed out the sudden and sickening thought that Dean only ‘cared’ about him, for the sex, that just wasn’t who Dean was.
Kevin gets Dean’s attention away from Charlie by poking his arm. “Talk about hot, look at that guy at the bar.” Kevin shows him the target.
Sam (Thursday 2:07 PM) How’s it going? How’s Cas doing? Jess is okay, we’re watching the Hallmark channel and she’s in TV drama heaven.
“Cas?” he croaks, needing to clear his throat he turns away and coughs a little against his shoulder, he tries again. His voice barely audible as he whispers tenderly, “Cas?”
