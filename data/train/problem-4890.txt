Steve can see the pale face on the Asgardians, and if Steve concentrated he was sure that the person who stared at him in mute horror as he whispered his name was no one but Thor. The sound of something recharging behind him and the sound of repulsors firing throwing Nebula away from him informed Steve that just as he feared, Tony was stupid enough to follow him into the battlefield.
Steve was silent as he took Tony in, almost making Tony shiver and run away, unfortunately, his legs refused to move; a few moments later Steve let out a sigh and stood up, walking toward Tony and helping him stand on his shaky legs. "I'm sorry,
"You better do Rogers." Howard said as he took the comm from Natasha and put it in his ear sitting next to the monitors.
Bucky swallows at that and walked to the door banging on it with his metal arm. "Open the door, Stark; I have a message to you from Steve!" Bucky hurls as he banged on the door, the music was cut so he steps back as he waited for what Stark was going to do next, heart pounding in his chest about what he was going to do.
Steven Rogers-Barnes… they told him that was his name; what a joke, a few days ago his name was Steven Stark, so how did things change so much in the matter of a few seconds? What irks Steve so much was Bucky Barnes… Bucky Barnes who waltzed in his hospital room when he think that Steve was asleep; coming to sit beside Steve and take his hand in his to start with his round of apologies that never seemed to end. It makes Steve so angry, so helpless, and spiteful; Bucky Goddammit whatever-his-last-name-was was the one who T-boned his car, he was the one who killed his baby and destroyed his life with his husband… he was the devil that everyone took his side no matter what Steve said or plead with someone to hear his side of the story… Steve doesn't want the asshole near him in any shape or form, especially to apologize for something that was clearly his fault.
"Peter!" Tony could only scream in terror as his eyes took in the mansion that was up in flames, pain, hurt, and denial warred inside Tony because it can't be, it just can't be, can't be, his son can't be inside. Oh God, his son, and Steve were inside the burning mansion!
"Why can't you understand? Why can't you just leave it be? I am fine, I don't need help!" Tony really wanted to hiss the Alpha in defense, but he knows if he did that it wouldn't end on a good note, so he still on scowling like no tomorrow, though his pup squirming and whine made him realize that he was letting his pheromones raging, he tried to calm himself when he realized that.
"I said can I help you, Ma'am?" Tony scowled as he gazed at the woman, daring her to do something or even say anything that Tony didn't ask of her, how dare she act like this? Scowling and ordering him around as if he was a maid in his own home.
Shaking his head, Steve went to his room, planning on taking a long bath and soak in lavender-scented water to relax his muscle. Steve did just that when he returned to his room, throwing his clothes in the hamper and lowering his body in the warm water, letting out a sigh as his muscle relax one after the other.
I liked the approach in The Avengers: Earth Mightiest Heroes when she became Miss Marvel, but I also loved the movie and their definition of the Skrulls and Kree, so I decided to mish them up, the storyline with Carol is not like the movie, the difference is that Carol doesn't have amnesia, and that Talos was able to save Dr. Lawson and Carol, and he was able to kill Yon-Rogg and Minn-Erva.
"That means…" Peggy's voice cracked as she trailed of when the situation finally made sense to them, it only took a few seconds before the Avengers ran to Steve, fighting between themselves to be the first to hold and hug him. Loki's shrieks made Tony raise his head from where he was trying to pull Steve away from Bucky who was about to strangle Steve for
So it was dinner time, and Tony was grateful that Aunt Peggy and her mate Angie were invited to dinner. Dinner was good, great even! Until his mother starts talking about Hammer and how he will make a wonderful Alpha for Tony… "He is a good Alpha!" His mother said happily making Tony choke on his juice... if only his mother knew… "His mother and I were talking, I think it will be a wonderful idea for you to meet him, you don't know, you may even like him!" That was Maria's happy voice.
"I see…" The Ancient One said looking at Steven for a while tilting her head a little, and everyone was impressed at how pale she became when some emotion seemed to paint her eyes, her eyes scanned the room fast, but not too fast that Peggy didn't notice how her eyes darken when they fell on Steve, who was standing with Natasha looking at his counterpart with disbelieved look. "Son of Sarah…" The woman said after she turned to Steven once again her eyes never leaving the man that turned to her. "It seems that you were the fates way of righting what's wrong… please use this chance wisely, for now, you are our only defense against that dark future…" The Ancient One said walking to Steven and out he had on his shoulder and give it a small squeeze before turning around and walking through the portal that appeared out of nowhere…She left everyone stunned when the realization crossed their mind and everyone turned to Steven who was looking at the portal the woman crossed…
Tony sobbed as he listens to his father, growling and glaring at the man as he walked around the room in circles, looking like a cornered animal every second that pass. "Why didn't you tell me?" Tony screamed, taking hold of his hair nearly ripping it out. "What did you get by torturing me?" Sobbed Tony as he whined making his father swallow at that. "Why?" Tony yelled, making Howard flinch.
"The ones who will execute the punishment are Loki and Thor, for the Omega that was hurt was one of their people." Starkad stated, which made Loki gaze at him with narrow eyes that soften as he nodded his head in thanks, followed by Thor who was grinning in a feral way as gazing at Hamar with hunger in his eyes, which made the man shiver and sob. "As for dear Hamar, tell me, which hand did you use to stab the Omega, hmm?" Starkad asked with a curious tone, which made the lesser Alpha shiver and shake his head, a plea shining in his eyes as he gazed at Starkad. "Which hand?" Starkad snarled, which gazed the kneeling man to whine pathetically and show Starkad his right hand, which made the Alpha smile like a feral beast. "Will then, it is of no use to you after today." Starkad gave Jamti a nod, causing the man to walk forward and take his ax from his belt, which caused Hamar to shriek and try to scramble away, only to be stopped by an arrow pointing to the back of his head, which informed everyone that Klint will make Hamar suffer worse than just his punishment if he dared to move again, when Jamti secured Hamar's hand he swung his ax in one swift move, cutting Hamar's hand, which caused Hamar to shriek and cry in pain, as he held his stump, trying to stop the blood from flowing. "Everyone! Standing in front of you now is an outlawed, he is no longer one of us, everyone who dares to help him will be punished in the same way he was. Klint, if you will please throw him out of the village." Starkad ordered, which caused the Omega to give a dangerous smile as he gazed at the moaning man who was shaking.
The dreamy sigh he heard from Barnes made him look at the man who was looking at the screen like a schoolgirl watching her crush, making Tony press his lips tightly into a straight line. "He is an Addams…" Barnes said, and where those hearts floating around him?
Reaching the Stark's mansion was like a dream came true to Tony as he got out of the car. It was hours later that he was able to gain the courage and go to Steve to talk with him; the Alpha was in the gym pummeling a punching bag to death. Tony watched the Alpha from afar, jumping when the chain broke and the bag sailed toward the wall hitting it hard. "Tony?" Steve gives a questioning sound as he unwrapped his bandaged hands, and Tony had to contain his jealousy about how the Alpha didn't break into a sweat.
The sound of the babe crying in pain made the Omega froze and turn around to see the small pup who stood for him cry on the floor as someone stepped on his hand, which made the Omega snarl and rushed at the man, all finesse in fight forgotten in the quest of getting that monster off the pup when he was able to push the man to the ground, the bastard had the gall to grin, something that would have made Steven snarl if it wasn't for the sudden pain that bloom in his stomach making Steven gasp and freeze.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, violence, mention of characters' death, anxiety, mention of chemotherapy, near mental breakdown, and who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Who Tony?" Pepper said alarmed by Tony's action, the scent of raging Alpha was swirling around the room suffocating everyone in the room, it made Clint fidget and look around the place, considering that he was the only Omega on the team it was justified.
Steve on the other hand was frozen in his place, gazing at Bucky's back with wide eyes, not believing what he just heard from the Alpha, did the two brothers made this story up? But from the look in Bucky's eyes, the Alpha was clearing thinking that Steve was crazy, Steve practically scared the Alpha that he fled from here. "I'm… I'm not lying, Tony, I swear I am not…" Steve finally said after he was able to gather himself, tears start clouding his eyes as he gazed at his mate with confusion and fear, wondering what happened to him that he couldn't remember last night.
The sight before him nearly caused Steven to laugh out loud at such a display; his son seemed really closed with Petrus to let the boy talk to him like that without glaring or huffing. "The bear is not going anywhere, Petrus, the two of you can see the bear whenever you like." Spoke someone behind Steven, causing the Omega to grit his teeth tightly when the king's voice filter through his ears, the anger that vanished after his talk with Nicolaus return full force when he was thrust into the dilemma that was the foolish king. "The two of you can go and see the bear if you want, I want to have a word with the queen, just wave to Jamti and he would show you the kill." The king continued after throwing a hopeful glance toward Steven who was forced to smile tightly when he saw his son and Petrus gaze at him with hopeful and sparkling eyes.
It hurt Steve how Tony practically starts living in his office, rarely coming home, leaving Steve wondering if the Alpha was doing OK, Steve, he gets bored, as much as he loves painting, he can't spend the whole day painting and drawing, nor he can spend it cleaning, he needed someone to talk to when he wasn't out with his friends or when they came to visit, and unfortunately, it seems that James wasn't all about talking, more of holding himself in his room without getting out unless it was the middle of night… though the blond really hoped that this will change soon…
On another different and serious note, brain injuries are not a funny business. Most of what we see in TV shows with coma patients is depicted as somebody waking up from a massive sleep a bit confused, then looking at the calendar and becoming even more confused before continuing to act completely normal. Not surprisingly, that's not true at all.
He just hangs on for the ride for now, since his legs are too jelly from being at the receiving end of Steve's wicked plans. But Tony swears to himself if Steve didn't knot him right here, right now, Tony will pin him down bodily and work that damn knot in him himself.
"Shhh, shhh, sweetheart, it is OK, it is OK, Daddy is just going to leave you for a second before he returns back, just stay calm and sweet for me, baby," Tony whispered shakily as he put his baby gently on one of the plush pillows on the floor, trying to ignore Howard's snarl as he continued to slam the door trying to break through it. "It's OK… sweetheart," Tony whispered, his hands caressing Morgan's cheeks, causing his baby to sniffle as she looked up at him with big teary eyes. "I love you, baby…" Tony whispered, kissing his baby on the forehead, before pulling back, distracting his child with a toy as he rushed out of the playroom, silently signaling to Jarvis to start locking down the playroom, and not allow anyone inside.
"Peter!" A low voice was heard from behind Tony, which made the hair or the Omega's body stand on its end at the dangerous undertone he heard under the frantic voice.
No matter how much they torture him, he will always hit back when Stane comes near him thinking he can touch him. He was a virgin and he will stay a virgin until he chooses his own mate. No matter how much he was slapped and hit, no matter how much they thrust his face into the water's until his lungs screamed for air, no matter how much he was thrown around like a ragdoll, or how much they starve him in hope that he will be weak the next time...
Natasha and Sam understood what he went through, they were supportive, and they definitely were pissed at Tony and what he said to Steve; it ended up with Natasha and Tony getting into a screaming match when the Alpha came to collect Steve the next day, hoping that Steve had calmed down a little. Steve still remembered the snarls and hisses his best friend and husband throw at each other, followed by screams and curses and threats; it was only thanks to Sam that the screaming match didn't turn into a brawl with Natasha killing Tony and going to jail for it.
Steve stayed quiet for a little time before letting out a small laugh. "Do you know how to kill someone without killing them?" Steve asked Fury, getting a confused look from the young man, it made Steve give a sad smile. "You drive them crazy…" Steve said making Fury pause at that before he was able to question the Alpha what he meant the door opened showing Stane being dragged by some of Shield agents. Fury shut his mouth, feeling that he already got his answer, an answer that he didn't know and sure as hell wouldn't like.
The video was cut leaving everyone in silence that took place; Bucky could do nothing but ask for the address once again, leaving the room when the AI gave him the address.
"You got it all wrong Tony." It was Peggy, who said these words, taking a step toward Tony and pushing Bucky behind her sending him a dark look when Bucky dared to open his mouth. "Everything until now, we did everything we could to protect you, we know that the only place you would be safe is near the lake," Peggy stated in a calm voice as she took a step toward Tony which gained her nothing but a dark growled.
"And then what?" Tony asked, turning a little toward Natasha wanting her to talk, wondering if it was possible for the woman to turn even paler than she already was; Natasha shook her head not a few seconds later, causing Tony to sigh in relief when the woman resumes her story.
Gave him the whole tale of what took place on Midgard two years ago Steven realize that not only was he held on this plane of existing, but the stone that was connected to him was in fact what those Midgardian calls the Tesseract that was lost in space when they were able to close the portal, and not only that but it implies that Thanos finally determined to carry out his plans, seeking to gather every Infinity Stone out there and that alone made Steven concern, because Thanos alone was bad news, but Thanos with the Stones? That means the end of the universe. Did he also mention how Thor will remain with him on Midgard until the Bifrost Bridge repaired? Ignoring the fact that he was stranded on Midgard for the last two years? Just his luck. The powerful idiotic warrior was replaced by a scary whimpering cat at the thought of Steven having a rough time breathing.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of fluff, a little bit of kissing, sadness, violence, near character death, hostage situation, Steve being a BAMF and Tony losing his mind! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
The sound of the heartbeat in the room, made Tony freeze, and as fast as he can he turn to the screen looking at the black and white image. "Look here Mr. Carbonell this is your baby." The doctor said happily as she draws a circle around something, Tony narrowed his eyes trying to see, he felt his throat close up as he saw a peanut shape, he swallowed, feeling his eyes becoming glassy…
"I see Captain Rogers, what will you like me to call you? I am sure being called Captain Rogers will confuse everyone." Jarvis said after he collected himself which made Steven smile at that, the man was just like his AI counterpart or Vision, straight to the point with a legendary patient and self-control.
Even if his heat took him by surprise and the only thing he could remember was taunts and pain, even if Stane smirked at him when his heat ended and laughed at him. Tony just gritted his teeth at that, if he didn't remember than it didn't happen, and that was it. Sex was sex and people do it all the time for different reasons and forgets about it, he will forget about it as sex was unimportant, virginity was overrated. He took sick pleasure at the shock and disgust that paint Stane's face when he spits on him, he endured the beating he got after as it was the norm. The only thing he was grateful for is that a mating mark won't take without the Omega consent, if Stan thought losing his virginity would humiliate him, will he should think again…
Two weeks pass; two weeks of spending his time with his mate and enjoying it to their fullest, getting to know each other not just intimately, but trusting the other with their most hidden secrets. Two weeks of sightseeing around Italy and taking photos to keep the memories of their happiness together, promising the other silently that they will be there. Two more weeks of missing Peter, and promising that the first thing they will do back home was holding their pup until they were content.
." The female huffed, ignoring the boy's protests as she picked him up and rushed away from Fury as fast as she can while throwing Fury cautious looks like the Alpha will follow them any minutes now and beat them.
But the thing is, Tony ends up fighting aliens by the end of 2010 under the leadership of his aunt, it was a hard pill to swallow… but what hurt the most was the fight that took a place in the Helicarrier, he and Bucky nearly ripped each other's head off, no one knew how the fight started but it ends up opening old wounds.
"Tony!" Steve's happy voice, caused Tony to purr happily as he was pulled back from behind into a tight hug, curtsy of his handsome husband who appeared behind him. Not soon as Steve held Tony, the Avengers trickled down to find them, mainly to glare at Tony and threaten him silently to break up with Steve, which was a stupid thing honestly; even after five years, the hostility was still up the roof, and Bucky was still trying to assassinate Tony every time he had, which was cute in a way. "…What is that?" Steve finally asked after he let Tony go, his eyes finally caught the sight of the baby in his arms.
"Peter, love…" His Mama's voice made Peter look at him to see the strange woman and man from before looking at him with tears. "Come say 'Hello' to Mama's friends, Pepper, ad Rhodey." The man who was holding him, let go which made the small boy crawl to sit in his mother's lap once more looking at the strange people.
"What do you seek from a person who nearly destroyed your world?" Odin asked which made Steven nearly growl at the older man but he contains himself, going to the old man and giving him a good punch on the face won't make everything turn alright.
Like all good things in life, Tony should have known that everything good was going to blow up in his face, it always does that, life with him never just stopped and let him rest for a few short years, let him regroup with himself, let him truly heal. No, life just took one look at Tony before it shook its head and decided that there wasn't enough tragedy in his life, and God, it made Tony so furious, so angry, because why now of all times, why now when he was finally making process and getting better, just why?
"I see you are awake." A gentle voice said, making Steven turn his eyes to the person who was standing near the door with a tray, Steven glared at the man, even when the Beta gave him nothing but a gentle smile, though, the Beta didn't seem to be phased by his actions. "My name is Braes, the village healer." The man said as he came toward Steven, ignoring the way that the Omega hides his babe away from the Beta, something that Steven admired the Beta for not pointing. "Now that you are awake, please drink this, it was a miracle that you survived the shock, I do not want all of my hard work to fall apart just because you refuse to take the medicine." These words were said in a firm tone, causing Steven to roll his eyes and take the mug from Braes' hand.
What Steve learned from the guardians, made him wish that this was just a nightmare that he would wake up from soon. That all of this was just a nightmare that Steve's broken mind hallucinate. After the guardian introduced themselves, Peter Quill the leader told them why he was here; surprisingly he wasn't here to kidnap Steve and sell him to the highest bidder, but he was here because of Thor's request. Asgard… Asgard was falling… they were failing day after day against Thanos; day after day Thanos attacked Asgard more brutally than before, trying to obtain the right Infinity Gantlet they had.
"Why are you here Tony?" Steve said which made the Omega fumble out an answer that made the Alpha narrow his eyes and lean closer toward the Omega, mainly to make him uncomfortable so that he will excuse himself and leave Steve, but the Omega only blushes at the closeness between the two of them. "Just leave Tony…" Steve said which made the Omega frown at that, and huffed while shaking his head.
"Can I have blueberry pancakes?" Peter asked, raising his arms in demand of Tony to carry him, which Tony did, he leaned down and plucked his baby from the bed, letting out a happy sigh when his boy snuggled closer to him. A year ago, if Tony dared to carry Peter like this, his little boy would have chatted his ears off, talking about everything walking under the moon and sun, telling him about what happened in school or what was his plans for the day… ever since Steve died, his baby became too quiet, too shut down on himself, gazing at any door they came across as if he was waiting for Steve to open the door and come in.
"Insatiable." Steve murmured into his next thrust, no meanness in the word, just fondness and adoration in his tone and eyes. And there's a stir of delight in Tony's belly at that look, Tony was so sure that Steve was feeling smug because he was the one who's reduced Tony to this.
Steve never knew who he was… but he knows it was the reason why everyone around him was dying a little bit every day on the inside…
"Tony!" Rogers gave an angelic smile, and Tony was so sure he heard glasses breaking in the background and some demons weeping and shrieking; Tony wondered if it was worth it to say sorry, did the holy water do something to Rogers' head? Because Tony is now more afraid than ever. He might even call Barnes and asked him for help.
Though Steve has issues about his age, he believed that it was wrong for him to be considered young when he was in fact born in 1920, mix that with surviving guilt, and you will have a man who counted the years he spent in the ice, so for him, he believed that his age is 67 and no matter what Howard and Peggy tried to convince him, he wouldn't listen.
Since the second day of haunting (Tony still won't admit to his friends that a ghost tripped him into the closet; just thinking about it made Tony scrunch his nose in disbelieve) the only victims were Rhodey and Pepper, thankfully, Morgan was never hurt or anything; at first, it made Tony feel bad thinking like this, but as the days progressed, he was thankful that his daughter was as fine as she can be.
Steve looked at Tony's face and he pursed his lips, looking at the Alpha's begging face, he let out a sigh and turns his gaze to his cup before finally coming to a decision and looking at Tony with a hard look. "One chance Stark, you only got one chance to make everything right, you messing that up, and you are out, out of my life, and most importantly out of Peter's life, and you better make sure to tell your father to not stick his nose in our lives this time, or else…" Steve threats which made Tony nod his head so fast the Omega wondered how it didn't fly off, he ignored the warmth he felt at the happiness he saw in the Alpha's eyes. "Tomorrow is Peter's appointment with the hospital, 9 AM sharp, try to not be late." Steve ended up saying as he took his cup and went to wash it in the sink, ignoring the happiness that took over Tony's face…
A family that will break apart and weakens if Tony continued in the path he was heading in. it was a dangerous path, a path full of pain and abandonment, Steve wasn't lying when he told Tony his last words, every time someone tries to end a war before it started, innocent people always pay the price. Death, torture, pain, and so much more will take a place after the catastrophe the sudden war will start, and when that happened, people will always jump to blame the person who starts everything, even when it was in good intentions.
"You learn fast…" Loki murmured with a sarcastic smile on his face. "It would have been easier to say that the mad was sane at that time, but it would be a lie if he was even considered sane. Every day, the mad got madder and madder by the second every time he saw the bright one looking at their love interest and exploring the worlds. In the end, the mad was able to capture them… let's call them the love interest, shall we?" Loki said as he leaned on his seat looking at Steven straight in the eyes. "Now the bright one was smart, they knew what the mad wanted, to break the rule, which defined his universe, but the thing was it was either them or their love interest, so the bright ended up making a deal with the mad, one-touch, one lifetime." Loki raise a finger at that, he could already feel the fear that rose in his mother's eyes, the suspicious in Odin's eyes as he gazes at Loki and Steven, and Loki had to contain his laugh at the confusion that colored every other face in the room. "But as I told you the bright was smart, for they know that there were other universes and that they can switch the places with another counterpart, thus that one promised lifetime will never take a place." Loki's grin widens as the realization crosses Steven's face. "Though the fates have a strange way of playing their cards, because here you are once again, back to the place you run away from… and Thanos felt it, he knew you are finally here and he is searching." That gets sharp inhales and gasps from the Avengers who finally made a connection to the story.
"I have stolen nothing, I am stating a fact." Steve grin a cocky grin as he raised his hand and trail it down Tony's neck and chest, making the inventor shiver and let out a sigh at the heavenly treatment, he could only hum and let out a stuttering sigh when Steve's lips start trailing down his neck and chest.
It's a thirteen-hour drive from New York City to Atlanta, Georgia… it could have been faster, but Tony didn't care about that he only wanted to arrive safely, but that didn't mean he didn't go faster when he thought cops weren't watching, he didn't care about the bone-crushing tiredness, nor the want to lay down and sleep. He had to reach Atlanta before the place he wants will be sold to someone else, he has to! For his baby's sake, he stops when he has to; pulling into gas stations along the road to refuel and gulp down bottle after bottle of water, hoping that he won't regret it in the next stop.
"Doesn't mean that you can run around, what if you get hurt?" Tony asked as walk to the buffet with the pup by his side, Tony hummed at that and pour the small pup a little bit of orange juice which the pup took with a chirped 'Thank you' and start drinking his juice.
"You shouldn't have done that." Frigga heard Loki's voice behind her, making her turn to the dark-haired man who was scowling at his mother, glaring at her, because he already knows that his mother used a spell to cause the Alpha to fall partially in love, and it made him angry that the woman will do something stupid like that, like breaking the Omega's heart, didn't she know that as soon as Steve will break Tony's heart, Steven will destroy this universe?
"You know what? I'm getting tired by this pointless fight, besides; my lunch break is starting now… Edith, you know what to do." As soon as Steven said that, all the Doombots froze in their places, which made the Avengers look at one another, waiting to see if this was one of Doom's tricks, but when nothing happened after a while, Tony knocked at one of the bots closer to him, watching as it fell on the ground like a hapless junk.
Steve could only watch the madness from the outside, falling more and more in love with Tony, as his fiancé lost it and start chasing both his parents with the axes in his hand; the terrified screams rang louder and louder as Tony's manic laughter increased in volume. "
Steve looked at the ceiling with an open mouth, not believing what he was hearing at all. "How is that even possible Edith? The blueprints were of a time machine, universe traveling is impossible unless someone has magical powers, and if I remember correct I returned the Infinity Stones and made sure they will never fall in the wrong hands again." Steve said running his hand throw his slightly long hair to slick it back, mind racing with every possible path this encounter could end with.
Steven turned his head to search for one of the Avengers, mainly to have an excuse to ditch the people that seemed to crowd him. He spotted Tony and a smile took over as Rogers was busy talking with Ross, (who is another person Steven should warn Peggy about). "If you will excuse me, something came up," Steven said giving his best smile, which made the Omegas flush and the Alphas laugh. In the end, they didn't let him go until he took their numbers.
"I will see what I can do, sir." He said making Tony laugh and followed Jarvis to the kitchen. It was half an hour later they heard a crash coming from inside the mansion which made the two froze. "Stay here sir and hide." Said Jarvis standing from the stool taking a kitchen knife with him, Tony moved and went to the landline to call aunt Peggy… the landline wasn't working that made Tony's breath hitches, he has to go to his father's office to get the mobile phone. Tony then jumped as he heard gunshots from upstairs, Jarvis!
"The heat you say? Then why didn't they discharge you unless they think something is wrong?" Steve asked, running his hand through the kids' hair before nuzzling Tony's neck, causing the Omega to grumble and huffing, probably annoyed that Steve didn't fall for his pleas.
"What did we miss?" That was Pepper, she was accompanied by Rhodey and Happy all of them holding so many presents and flowers; the three of them were late because Pepper and her mate had gone to the airport to give Rhodey a ride to the Stark mansion when they get the news that Tony had gone into labor at 1 a.m.
"He… he is my fated mate." Tony ended up saying after a while of silence, which made Dr. Ross's eyes widen, though she regains herself and a smile made its way to her lips as she looked at the flushed Omega, who was playing with the sleeve of his button-down, a nerves habit of his that Dr. Ross picked on.
"Stevie, are you sure you don't want to come with us tonight?" Sam's calm and gentle voice made Steve raise his head from the bed, already feeling drained and tired just doing that action; Steve only shook his head and let his head fall to the pillow once more, wanting to sleep but unable to do that, the words Bucky sprinkled on him yesterday still looping in his mind, causing Steve to lose himself more and more as he tried to make sense of what's going on with his life. "Steve, please… this is not good for you or the baby, you need to get out and see the world." Sam tried one more time, which only gained him a groan and Steve hiding his head under the blanket, wanting everyone to leave him alone until he gets his mind on the right track.
There on the walls were hundreds upon hundreds of pictures and information; what made Steve freeze though were that they were his pictures. They were
"Boss, we found him… the number belongs to Obadiah Stane." Said Coulson looking at Peggy while fidgeting… hearing that name made Howard go into a raging fit, he screamed, threats, and pleas and begged Peggy to go with the Strike team that will go, Peggy didn't want Howard to go, because if she knew her friend well, she knows that he would shoot Stane before they even find Tony.
"Mommy, Mr. Stark!" The happy sound of Peter made the two of them froze in mid-kiss, as fear took hold of the two of them, and suddenly Tony squeak as he was pushed away from Steve who seemed to regain himself, and tried to straighten his clothes, ignoring his flustered face that turning red, unfortunately for Tony, he lost his balance when Steve pushed him, so now he was left facing the ceiling with wide eyes and pounding heart not knowing what to do since he was brutally bushed away from his Omega by the said Omega. "Mommy… why is Mr. Stark on the floor?" That was Peter's question as the boy finally reached the living room and saw the two of them there, with Steve standing and leaning on the sofa with a flushed face and Tony still on the ground looking at the ceiling with a dazed look.
Steve tried to hold back from crying or even cursing, wondering why his husband was acting like a grade A asshole; part of Steve was curious about what happened between the brothers to make them act like this toward each other, but another part was tired of them continuously fighting. Steve doesn't want to be thrown into the Stark family's affairs, especially when he wasn't welcomed by them most of the time.
"I'm fine." Steve said as he turned his back to the Omega, hoping that the short man will take that as a sign and leave him alone, but unfortunately for him, the Omega took his dismissal as an invitation and came to stand beside him looking at Asgard with interest and thirst for knowledge, which made Steve's heart give a pang because Bucky used to look at new things like that.
"Who the fuck are you?" Snarled the witch when her eyes settled on Nebula, taking her in with so much rage and hate clear on her face; the witch was nothing but a child who continuously threw tantrums left and right. Nebula wondered what Thanos would gain from adding the nausea of a female into his armies, probably her magic ability, but Nebula knows for a fact that if Thanos gave her more time, Nebula would have found a stronger magic-user, one that wasn't ruled by their emotions.
"I think we both know that Peggy and Bucky are biased when it comes to Steven Rogers. They are too invested to give me the truth that I wanted." Tony explained, his right hand going to Morgan's back, running over it when his baby let out a whine.
"Well, Fury ordered Serpentine to do something she doesn't like!" Chirped Tony with a forced smile, trying not to twitch when he saw how pale Bucky became like he already knew the kind of punishment Fury gained because of him standing up to Serpentine. Tony wasn't an idiot, he wasn't a fool, he accepts his marriage to Steve mainly to not be Serpentine's target like how Fury made himself, all Tony can do is pray for those unfortunate souls lost in the crossfire of Serpentine and Steve's anger. "Now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is destroyed I will go and take a bath and then die somewhere in a ditch, so if you excuse me…" Tony's forced smile slipped as he turned around, dragging himself to his room, already planning out a date with his hot tube and rubber duck… God this was a nightmare.
A lot of things also took place in those months, and one of them the production of the design that Tony created; like his dad and Aunt Peggy predict, the machine did lead to chaos, Omegas' rights had launch once again with intensity the chance of standing equal with Alphas and Betas were too much to pass. Like Steve predict though, there were those who resist the machine; those were traditionalists whose minds lay in stone, thinking Alphas should constantly be supreme to Omegas, that they have the right to determine the Omegas' future, thankfully Steve handled them, on Live TV, informing them to 'Fuck off' an action that made Tony laugh breathless every time he remembered Steve's deadpanned face as he said those cusses on National TV in an irritated voice like he has so much better things to accomplish than remind close-minded individuals that they can't hold someone's freedom and that people has the rights to make their own decisions.
"See you later!" Steve waved to his friend which got him a wave and a thumb up from his friend; Steve hum to himself as he went to his car; already thinking about the new paintings he will start drawing once he returns home. Getting inside his car, Steve let out a sigh, wondering what he will do to gain Tony's attention this time; maybe he should chain Tony to bed so he will listen, that thought caused Steve to let out a soft laugh and he turns to put the messenger bag on the seat beside him, only…
"Now, Pep, don't be cruel, I'm sure that Rhodey's software still hasn't been downloaded yet." Tony grinned, enjoying how grumpy Rhodey became; it ended with Tony letting out a war cry when Rhodey stole a pancake from his plate, this was not acceptable at all! Thankfully it was Pepper to the rescue as she stole Rhodey's coffee and kicked his shin, which made Tony coo and calls her his hero.
It was only a few seconds later before Steve starts chanting, making the hair on Tony's body stand on its ends, he can already predict what was going to happen, and he prayed that nothing bad was going to happen to his poor soul.
For everyone who didn't know, I posted a new spooky story for Halloween 'The Soldier' to answer the spooky Halloween challenge I got, go check it out if you are interested!
After his brief period of depression, Tony finally gathered himself enough, determent that he would do right by Harley and get to know the boy better. And finally, after starting the adopting process, Tony got his chance to bond a little by little with Harley, thanks to the weekly visits. At first, Tony felt how uncomfortable Harley was, and he beat himself for not noticing before, but as days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months, Tony can safely say that Harley was finally feeling comfortable around him to relax and even joke around sometimes if the little boy was in the mood.
Steve was able to open his eyes by this point, and he frowns a little as he looked around the place, he looked like he was in a hospital room? No, it was impossible, hospitals' rooms weren't comfortable nor did they have this pleasant creamy color on the walls, hospitals were just white, and barren, and made Steve heartbreak over and over.
" Steve asked once more as he kissed the place where his mark will take, his eyes were wild and his voice was deep, causing Tony to shiver and nod his head, feeling desperate when his Alpha didn't touch him as fast as he wanted but took his time unwrapping him from his wedding suit like he was a present.
At that Tony snarled and snatched the phone from Steve's hand, not that Steve was going to object, not when he was too frozen from shock to do anything other than shiver. "Who the fuck are you, asshole?" Tony growled, which only gain him a dark chuckle from the other side of the phone. "Do you know who I am? I will destroy you! If you ever dared to call this number once more you have no one but yourself to blame!" Tony hissed his hackle rose when the chuckle at the other end turned into a burst of booming laughter.
"Yeah, not since you moved away to DC, a few months after we last met." Tony stated, trying to smile even when he was feeling uncomfortable on the inside. "I was surprised when Steve told me you were one of his friends, I admit; you know you should visit us soon, I'm sure Peter will enjoy befriending Wanda and Pietro." Tony's lips twitched at that, already knowing that Wanda and Pietro will get well with Peter, the two of them were too much like Cooper and Lila, that Clint will have a heart attack when he sees them.
"Welcome home!" Tony smiled as he said those words, his smile widening when he saw Harley holding one of Steve's hands as he gazed around the house with wide eyes, taking everything in; this would be the first time that Harley visit their home, for usually many of their interaction with the kid would take place either in the orphanage, the clinic or in public places with one of Harley's caretaker. "Hey, Harley…" Tony smiled as he leaned down in front of the boy, getting a shy wave and a small smile. "Are you ready to meet your new family?" Tony asked, smiling when he felt Peter running down the stairs, no doubt getting scold by Sarah for running inside the house.
"Oh, Steve… it is you…" The woman whispered her voice cracked as she close the distance between them, tears clinging into her lashes as she stood in front of him. "You are really awake… I couldn't believe my ears when Bucky told me that you were awake. I am so sorry it took me a long time before coming, Stevie, so sorry." The woman sniffled, her action causing Steve to blink his eyes, wondering who was the woman and why was she talking to him like she knew him.
A little part of Tony could only stare in awe at Steve, taking how much his beauty and divinity increased as the light of the sun touched him. Steve never pointed out that the sunlight enhanced him, but Tony should have known anyways, after all, the sun was just another star on its own. Gazing at how Steve's light intertwined with the sun's, it cemented in Tony's mind that Steve was not from around here, that he was in a league of his own, a league that not even Thor with all of his
"Rude!" Tony called out, rising the baby toward Steve which made the man pull away from the boy but stopped when Tony pout at him; Tony can see the hesitate and dislike in his husband's eyes, and he had to stop himself from laughing out because his husband was in for a surprise. The baby to his credit only gazed at Steve with curious eyes, taking the man in as he gurgled and cooed.
" Tony whispered in Steve's ears, holding tightly into him, not letting Steve move an inch, as if he was afraid that Steve was going to disappear if he did.
Tony let out a sad, so sad, sigh as he gazed at the paperwork on his desk. He was able to run to the Stark tower earlier this morning without Steve catching him, which was a relief because if that crazy Addams saw him, then he will follow him, and if he followed him than Pepper will see him, and if Pepper saw him, she will flirt with him because she had that awful crush on someone who was a scary assassin, which then will make Steve do something awful to her like he did half of his teammates. And that's why Tony can't have nice things!
The other one called 'I Love You 3000' also a Stony Omega-verse if you are into time travel, dimension travel, old man Steve Rogers, and young man Steve getting his ass kicked, then go check this story…
"Oh my God…" Steven heard the whispers of excitement behind him, which made him hum a little at that, the doors to the palace were suddenly opened, and when everyone entered the palace the saw no one behind the doors, which made their eyes widen a little when the candles were light by their own.
"Look, I don't care what Stark did, but I will give you a fair warning Rogers, I will never stop chasing you no matter what you think, and I will make you fall in love with me in the end and forget all about Stark, clear?" Bucky stated with a smug look, the sadness vanished from his eyes and it was replaced by a determent look, which caused Steve to smile and shake his head in amusement. "Good, now if you excused me, I have to start planning how to win your heart, so if you don't mind, shoo!" Bucky pushed him away, as he said those words making Steve snort and wave goodbye to Bucky before walking toward the red door that appeared out of nowhere, opening it and getting inside…
The first gunshot caused Tony to curse and look around the room, trying to find a way to escape before the door break completely by Howard's hands. The only way out was the window, and that alone made Tony bite his lower lip hard; Tony knew that falling from the window won't kill him, it may injure himself, but not serious enough to send him to the hospital. With that Tony curse as he rushed to the window, forcing it open as heard the second gunshot followed by another slam. The creaking sound coming from the door informed Tony that Howard was too close to his goal.
That's why you will find Tony searching the whole tower trying to find his own son now of all the time just because Tony finally noticed that Peter was missing when he didn't show up for lunch. Peggy and Bucky were at S.H.I.E.L.D., Clint and Natasha were away on a mission, which left only Bruce who was in the labs, Steve who was asleep in his own room (Hopefully), Tony who was searching for his son.
"Hey, don't blame me, blame that fucking shooting star that dragged me with it here, by the way, is there any close loony bin so we can drop my friend at, I am sure he missed his friends." The man… Steven was going to call him a man, said while pointing at him, which made Steven glare at him hard enough that everyone seemed to shift in discomfort.
"Finally! I am going to Asgard!" Steven turned around to see Tony in his suit pulling a… a portable lab with him? Only for Jarvis to call for Peggy's help in stopping the Omega. "But Aunt Peggy This is the opportunity of a lifetime! Thor say something!" Tony whines when Peggy pulled the Omega away from his gadgets which made Tony struggle to get back to it
Steve hummed as he looked at the peephole blinking his eyes when he saw a familiar woman, though he was sure that he has never seen that woman before now, Steve bite his lower lip and let out a sigh opening the door to take a good look at the woman. "Hello Ma'am can I help you?" Steve asked when he opened the door and he can see the woman's eyes widening and for her jaw to drop a little.
Steve tried to stay strong, if not for himself than for his baby, he tried to call Tony more, talk with him more, tries to seek him out more… only to have his husband claiming that he was busy if he wasn't busy then he was talking to someone through that damn phone of his if he wasn't using his phone than he was out, God knows where, and it was draining.
Reaching the mansion's door, Steve opened it and looked at the acres after acres of land that Tony owned, looking at the sky Steven realize that it was probably three in the morning, but that didn't stop him, instead, he gets out and close the door behind him.
Tony could only groan in pain when Fury launched on complaining once again, snapping and hissing and accusing Tony of being reckless as hell; oh God, could Fury shut up? "Do you know how hard it was to quiet the media down, Stark? Everyone is going crazy about you marrying an Addams, which by the way is something that never happened in the past 100 years!" Fury snarled, causing Tony to let out a huff, leaning back in his chair and holding the bridge of his nose.
His baby looked at him with teary eyes, causing Steve to kiss his forehead, before standing up and pulling his baby with him gently, causing the shaky boy to latch into his midsection, following Steve when he starts walking, trying to avoid coming near the body on the floor and near Howard who was gazing at him with an unreadable look on his face and a dark frown which was more of a reason for Steve to hurry out of the house.
"Why did you do it, Peter? You know you are not allowed inside of that room… no one is, so why?" Steve asked gently, causing the boy to sniffle at that and hide his face into his pillow taking big breaths, which made Steve sigh and picked up the boy, sitting him in his lap, wiping the boy's tears, which ended up with the pup's breath hitching now and then.
Knocking the door, Steve smiled when the two boys turned to Steve; both had a muffin in their hands while crumbs decorating their mouths and clothes like badges. "OK boys, put the muffins down, Tony is about to make dinner," Steve ordered the boys, narrowing his eyes until the kids put their muffins in the semi-full plate; good, the two didn't seem to have eaten
It was when his son changed into his PJ and was ready to bed; Steve finally got the courage to answer him. "How is my birthday boy, doing?" Steve asked as he entered the room to see his baby putting the presents he received in the places he wanted them to be.
As much as Steve wanted to snap at the woman for sticking her nose in people's business, he knows that it will be his head if he did, so he took a deep breath trying to calm himself down. "I love him." Steve said which made the woman look at the Alpha with a strange look on her face before she smiled at the Alpha.
"How dare you speak with your betters like that?" Doom exclaimed with anger, glaring at Steven harder when the man rolled his eyes and did a backflip to avoid the arrows Clint start shooting at the bots, Peggy was trying to evacuate the civilians with Bruce, but there were some stubborn idiots who wanted to stay so they could get exclusive stories.
"He is not good for you!" Bucky cried out as he was pulled along Rogers who was trying to run after Tony, uncaring of the weight that was holding him back which consisted of every Avenger that wasn't Tony, as they held into Steve in hopes of the man forgetting about the inventor, but to say the truth they were impressed and more in love with how strong Steve was…
"Let's get you to bed, Howard…" said Steve raising Howard and carried him bridal style. Steve walked toward his room, he heard the old man hum a song while moving his head a little…
"When will be the next time? Three months later? After the baby is born? After you ask for a divorce because you couldn't handle living with me and our child?" Steve asked, taking a sick pleasure in the shocked look that crossed over Tony's face. "I am tired of feeling like a whore whose only job is being a stress relieve, do you even know what it makes me feel when the only thing you want with me these days is sex?" Steve whispered, pulling his hands away from Tony making the Alpha stumble. "I didn't ask something impossible when I told you I want you with me today, this wasn't the first or the second appointment you miss, I'm sure if you asked around, everyone will tell you I am either a widow or a single parent because no one ever saw the husband I claim to be married to." Steve sniffed a little, wiping the moisture away from his eyes, hoping that he won't start crying any minute now.
"What about this? We can go and take Harley to the park tomorrow where the two of us can get to know each other… we can talk about adopting and other things after we get married." Tony offered as an olive branch, only to have his lips twitching when he saw how wide Steve's eyes became, shock and adoration shining clearly in the Alpha's eyes.
Steven felt his son's hitched breath as he hid his face in Steven's breast trying to stiffen his whimpers of fear. "It will be alright, love, you will see, Mama is going to protect you." Steven whispered to his son while keeping his trembling body close. "I am sure these fine men can be reasoned with. We will be alright." James choked out a sob, hiding his face further Steven's breast, the Omega took a deep breath looking at the warriors around him, wondering if he can plea with them to save his son, maybe he can give his son to Margaret who was kneeling beside him, he was sure he will be able to distract the Vikings long enough for the Beta to run with his child.
Tony didn't realize it, but by now he was sobbing while clutching the photos to his chest, he couldn't believe that all of his hope since last year, dashed just like this, all of the sleepless nights, all of the private investigators, all of the sites he hacked searching for his son, it all ends up with him being told that his son was dead, just like what his father said, but how can he trust Howard when the older man spent half of his life lying to him?
it was the first time someone dared to come into his water without screaming or tricking him to reveal himself. The creature tensed at that thought, his breath stalled in his chest, as he turned his gaze around the lake, studying his land; time passed fast, and the creature relaxed when he didn't see any other one in his land, no one was here other than the smaller boy in the boat.
A minute passed, maybe hours? Steve didn't know or care about that, he was in his own little world, lost in fantasying about the child he was having, would they be a boy or a girl? Would they have blond hair or dark chocolate hair like his husband? Would they have his husband's beautiful eyes or his? So many questions that made heart pound and head spin. Steve's smile slipped and he sighs and looks down at his tummy, he caressed his tummy, as he felt sadness consumed him, this joyous day was supposed to be shared with his husband, who abandoned him for work. That made Steve glares at the floor and when the door opened he looked at the Beta that walked toward him with a sunny smile on her face.
Trying to stand up Steven let out a pained moan as he fell on the ground, looking at his right leg with horror head turning from side to side in denial, trying to hold in his screams, because no matter what he did he can't make a head or tail of what he was seeing and feeling!
"Calm down, baby doll, I can hear you thinking all the way over here," Steve murmured after an hour of their wait, causing Tony to blink and give Steve a nervous smile; it was hard for Tony to calm down, especially when he was thinking about how Harley was doing at home, and let's not forget the baby he was carrying.
"I am not a girl!" Tony ended up squeaking in the end, trying to glare at Serpentine, who was looking at him with amusement coloring her eyes, like all the protesting that Tony was doing was just a silly tantrum a three years old was throwing. It was so not fair, Tony's life was so not fair! Why does he have to suffer like this? Why can't Steve notice that Tony doesn't even like him like that? What's wrong with Bucky for not catching Steve's attention sooner than Tony did? Tony didn't want to die!
"Why?" The pup asked once again looking at Tony with a curiosity which made Tony laugh a little at that.
He didn't know why, but today Tony really wanted to leave the house, it was probably because he was locked in his house for a month, but the Omega had made sure to wear comfortable clothes and get out, it was nothing but a pair of black jeans and a red sweater, Tony learned a long time ago that if you didn't want people to recognize you while walking down the streets then you should dress like them, the weather was cold, it was the middle of fall, but it wasn't that cold that people could only leave their houses dressed with all of the contents of their closets.
"Why this place Tony?" Steve finally asked as he looked at the Alpha with a tired look, wondering why in the seven hells that Tony will bring him to this place, out of all the places in New York, it had to be the place that started all of the pinning and heartbreak, which was something that Steve doesn't appreciate at all.
"Are you going to spend your heat with Steve?" She suggested, resulting in Tony's face going in flames, and his flush deepened when his son lifted his head at the mention of Steve's name and looked at Tony, asking him with wide eyes if he could come too, it was that point that Tony swore that he will kill Natasha, or tell Angie all about her wild night with Clint and how she left the poor, poor Omega pregnant, hungry, and alone, is it true? No, will it cause Angie to run after Natasha calling for blood? Yes, will Tony enjoy himself after having his revenge? Oh, yes!
"Then I am coming right now," Tony said cutting the Beta's next words, he heard the sigh from the end of the line, he said goodbye and shut the phone, turning to see Pepper looking at him with an expecting face. "He found something about him…" Tony replied to Pepper's silent question in daze, which made the Beta squeal in happiness and jump to hug the Omega, slowly a smile took over the Omega's face as he let go of Pepper and rushed upstairs toward his room. "I better get ready Pepper! I will tell you everything tonight!" Tony shouted as he rushed upstairs to change his clothes, as much as he wanted to rush out of the house with his sweatpants and sweater, he knew he couldn't let his first meeting with his son go on like that.
"Do you know the reason for the Omega disappearance?" Natasha was the one who asked that question after the silence blanket the place, her mind going into overdrive trying to think of every possible direction that Howard took to get rid of the Omega, from killing the pregnant Omega to threating him that he had to flee for his and his pup safety, Natasha was mentally looking in her connections wondering who she could ask that will give her information about any Omega who disappeared between 1998, when Tony met the Omega to 2000 the first interview with Tony Stark as the man starts his playboy ways in 1999.
!" James snarled, his loud voice made Tony wince, and he glances at the stair for a second, afraid that Steve will come down to investigate the noises.
Made both Steve and Tony raise their heads, only to groan when Peter throw himself at Steve's arms. "Did you hit a growth spurt?" Steve asked in confusion as he took in Peter, probably wondering why Peter was bigger than he remembered him being, which made Tony laugh shakily.
Was the only thing Tony's scared mind could think. "Fine, stay you asshole, I will leave!" Snarled Tony as he turned around, already planning to make a run for it when he reaches the front door, even with a pregnant belly, Tony knows that if he reached the lake at least he will be safe.
Steve went to the only person who he knew will be able to help him in this situation, he knew Bruce's schedule by now, and he knew that on Friday the Beta had the night shift, so Steve went toward Bruce's room hoping to find the doctor there, he was thankful when he saw the lights under the door, he knocked on the door and heard Bruce's calm voice granting him entry, Steve closed the door behind him as he walked inside the room, looking at Bruce who was drinking tea and reviewing some of his patients' files.
"Now why do you think that?" Steve asked with raising interest, well, at least Harley knew that everyone was angry at the stunt he did. Running away was no excuse, even if Harley was scared, it didn't excuse him running away and causing everyone to panic, he could have told Betty about his refusal of adoption; Harley could even come to Steve and talk to him instead of running away. What would they have done if Tony didn't find Harley? What would they have done if they knew about Harley missing days or even weeks later? Steve knew he would have turned feral if that happened, the same could be said about Tony, especially when his Omega seemed to be attached to Harley.
"She… she looks like you…" Howard mumbled as he stood beside Harley, gazing at the baby with lost eyes like he doesn't know what do to; a soft smile took over Tony's face and he had to let out a laugh, the sight his father was making was as beautiful as heartbreaking as it was.
It was the first time that someone asked him that question, about what he thinks of Steve… well, sure the Alpha was friendly, and Tony will even go to a length and say that the two of them were friends, he never thought of Steve like how he thinks of his parents and Aunt Peggy. As for the mates' thing, he can say that Steve was an attractive man, after all, it was true the man was like an Adonis with his looks, and Tony wouldn't lie and say he didn't feel attracted and had a crush on the man, but does he really want to have a relationship with the man? "I… I don't really know… I mean he is attractive and all that, I… I just never thought of him like that before. He is a good father to Peter, never complains, and loves my son like it was his… it's just confusion, what if one day he will turn out to be like Obadiah? He is an Alpha; Alphas always thought that Omegas are beneath them… and I… I…" Tony couldn't finish his words, looking at his hands with a flush face, eyes becoming glassy and he hated himself that he nearly start crying just by the thought that Steve could be like Stane.
Steven bite his lower lip and squared his shoulders, walking inside like he owned the room, not caring about the eyes that raised to take him in or the face that turned into a frown when the man saw Steven walk inside the storage room, taking a wooden mug and a few herbs, before walking toward the pit when there was a kettle with boiling water, and in the back of his mind he wondered if it was the Alpha who boiled it, Steven relaxed a little when he noticed that the king has a wooden mug of his own.
Steve finally convinced Tony to accept the pet shark after two years of going on and on about how pets are good for health. Now, the two of them are the proud owners of a shark tank with more than twenty sharks, and one of them was the same shark they found on their honeymoon (No matter what Steve's say, Tony knew it was the same shark, especially when it looked at Tony with the same puppy dog eyes as it asked for Tony to save it)
The first story 'The Lake House' it's Thrill/Mystery story, with pregnant Tony in the mix, if you like the cabin in the woods kind of stories, then this is the one for you!
"There is nothing that you can do other than braving on and moving forward, it's the only way to get better, facing your fear, and taking the step forward to recover… sometimes… I wish I had a suit of armor... maybe then it wouldn't hurt so much…" Steve told him in a whisper as if he was telling Tony a guarded secret that no one was told about before him, and it made the Omega blink at that, mind going into overdrive at Steve's words…
As the days to his appointment get closer, Steve starts losing hope of Tony ever noticing what was going on around him, and when Steve started to talk about the appointments and how it was in a few days; Tony only hummed and nodded as he worked on his laptop ignoring the words Steve said, which left the Omega a little hollow and pained at his husband's ignorance.
"I don't know, I don't think I can get out, sorry…?" Bucky nervously said, and Steve saw how his hands clenched the shirt in his hands, and as much as Steve was going to hate himself for what he was going to do next, he can't let the Alpha stay any more minute inside the house, any hour now and poor Bucky will turn into a ghost!
"Oh, you wish for it to blow in two weeks!" Fury snapped before walking around the room, huffing and puffing as he tried to calm down, the sight making Tony sigh once more and curse Pepper and Rhodey for forcing him to the party, he should have let Serpentine haunt every goddammit person who was invited and be done with. "Rogers is the original Captain America would have cooled off in two weeks, him being the former Winter Soldier would have cooled off in months. But an Addams? This shit wouldn't calm down even if two years had passed! It is a hell out there Stark! All because you couldn't help but go public with your relationships with someone from the main family of the Addams!" Fury ranted on and on, and in the back of his head, Tony wondered if Bucky would have got the same treatment if he and Rogers were going steady, probably not, especially him being America's sweetheart and all of that.
"Can't sleep?" A voice asked causing Tony to blink his eyes open, trying to look for the source of the sound, which only succeeded in making Tony shriek loudly when he saw the source. The source was Serpentine, who was floating over Tony's bed and was looking at Tony with equal boredom and dark evil in her eyes that promised death. "Oh, poor baby! Are you OK?" The woman asked in a worried tone, not that Tony was going to believe every word coming out of her mouth, not when she was grinning like a cat who got the canary and was planning on toying with it until it either dies or gets eaten.
Two months later and Tony was on the edge, ever since he went to Sam Wilson that day two months ago and he couldn't stay still, always looking at his phone in hope that the Beta will call any minute now so far the Beta haven't called, which made Tony scare to death, but Clint assured him that everything is going to be fine, and he should chill. Though what left Toy stunned was that his whole neighborhood was in a high alert, everyone was running around the place like headless chickens, and when Tony asked Winnie about it (She was the head of the gossips club in the neighborhood) she told him that Sarah's son was finally returning home from London, it made Tony hum, it was then he realized why Sarah was in a happy mood all of the time, it was much later that Clint told him that Sarah's son was not only a famous artist but was the one behind 'Captain America' comic books, now it made sense to him why everyone was squealing and chattering, they want the first printed version of his new superhero comic story 'Spider-Man'... Wow, sucks to be that Alpha.
"Fine, he is fine…" Tony's breathed out, kissing Steve's hand that was clutching in both of his hands once more, begging Steve silently to hold on, to beat this, just like he always beat everything that the world throw at them. "Steve… you…" Tony's voice cracked, he wasn't able to say the next words that wanted to leave him making his lips tremble, as they were locked behind his teeth.
Reaching the common room, Tony let out a shaky sigh when he saw his friends and family waiting for him there; everyone was present, except Steve and Peter, which Tony was so grateful for. Knowing Steve, he will do something stupid when Tony was going to tell them about his nightmare.
Steve's eyes widened, the two of them continued dancing as they gazed at each other, studying, waiting; Steve seemed like he found what he was searching for because a huge smile painted his lips. "Thank you," Steve whispered with a joyful and relieved voice, causing Tony to turn his eyes to Steve once more, only for them to widen when he saw how bright Steve was shining, and how big his smile was… it was this moment than ever that Tony was proven to that Steve was a divine being and that Tony was pulled into his orbit.
"Well, first of all, congratulations are in order." The doctor said with a soft smile on her face, as she looked through the chart in her hand; her words causing both Steve and Tony to look at each other before turning their attention back to the doctor. "You are pregnant Mr. Rogers." The doctor said causing Tony to let out a
The sight made Tony's breath hitch, hope, and longing warring inside him as Tony turned to Steve, who was gazing at the dancing couples like he wanted to join them but didn't have it in him to do it. Steeling himself; Tony offering his hand to Steve while his heart pounded inside his chest like a crazy bird. "Will you honor me with this dance?" Tony asked, hoping that his voice didn't crack like he thought it did (it did).
"Father!" The sound of a delightful child made Steven blink and turn his gaze toward the sound, feeling the king letting go of his arm and search for the sound too, and then Steven saw him, a child no older than his James, probably the same age, running through the crowd of people until he reached the Iron King jumping in the Alpha's arms when he did, which made the Omega raise his brow at that, especially when the Alpha's demander soften and he held the pup tightly crooning something in his ear.
Tony did so well this year; he was able to make a little family for himself with an understanding and loving Alpha, and an amazing pup, who considered Tony as a parent to him, so why will Tony destroy all of that just because he saw some freakish comic that might as well have been coincident?
Tony sat on the sofa, the blanket pooling around him, but Tony didn't care about that, he ripped his sweater off his body, terror and fear taking hold of him when he remembered what took a place before he passes out; Tony's hand fell on the place that Ty slashed only to furrow his brows when he didn't feel anything but the smooth skin under his hand, which caused Tony to put his legs on the floor and stand up shakily, heading to the bedroom where the full-body mirror was situated.
"The same could be said about you, for not once did you offer to give your name away as a show of friendship." The king stated which gained him a twitch of lips from Steven. "It is Anton." The king offered, which made Steven's heart give a painful pang at the familiar name; hearing this name made a pain like a hot knife pierce his heart, and Steven had to bit his lips hard as to not let a gasp out.
He was really an idiot; Steve was the real idiot in all of this and everything that happened was his fault. Just a month, only one more month and Steve was going to have his daughter in his arms, and already Steve screwed everything up. His daughter was going to grow up without her father, she is always going to ask about her father and why he wasn't there with them, and when she was going to learn the truth, she was going to hate Steve and despise him for what he did.
The day that Anton left this world, was like any other day, it was so funny thinking about it, he remembered that he saw Anton walk with the help of a stick (Because he couldn't walk straight anymore so Anton start using sticks to help to go from place to place) until he reached their place… he wondered when Anton's place near the river became theirs… he watches as Anton sat on the ground grunting a little at that and then looked up at the sky to smile as he saw the star shine.
Huffing, Steve slowly lowered himself and start picking up the clothes on the floor, at least then Bucky would be back to a semi-normal room without him feeling bad about destroying his bedroom. "Stupid Alphas, and their stupid hormones, and their destructive nature…" Steve muttered to himself as he started to fold the clothes in his arms, going to the closet and grumbling to himself about having a long conversation with Bucky about how to take care of himself and not burn the house when Steve leaves.
The sound of the AI made everyone blink at that and when it clicked everyone looked at Tony who was turning redder by the second. "So, 'J.A.R.V.I.S', huh?" Peggy asked as she leans on the table with an amused look on her face, she could see the human Jarvis was trying hard to stop himself from snickering at the young master; Anna was going to have an amusing day hearing about this.
I know, I know, you hate me for not updating the past month; it's not my fault though, college is a pain! T^T
The room if possible became deadly quiet everyone was looking at Howard and Tony, as the two of them were glaring at each other, Maria was leaning on the wall looking at her husband shaking in her place, not believing what she was hearing, looking at her son, she saw the hard expression on his face, it was a miracle he didn't attack Howard and kill him this instead. "You know… I always wondered why you are so cold… I never realized how much of a monster you were until now… I had everything I wanted, I loved him…" Tony hissed as Howard snorted at that.
"Well, I think Thor's words are true, after all, Steven did explain to me that he saw me two thousand years ago and that I am a reincarnation of the Anton fella he always speaks about." Tony said as he crossed his arms, trying to stop his pout that wanted to widen, instead, he acted pettily and told them about what Steven told him a week ago, about reincarnation and the two thousand years ago meeting, which was cool when Tony think about it.
"Mama!" Both Peter and Harley cried as they entered his room, rushing toward Tony and climbing on the bed beside him, holding him tightly as they finally turned their attention to the baby, after making sure Tony was OK. Peter to his credit was the first to touch his sister by raising his finger to poke his sister on the cheek, which caused his sister to hold his finger and refuse to let go even when Peter tried to pull his finger away.
Even with the doctors and nurses rushed toward him, trying to call him down, trying to sedate him last he hurt himself…
Steve's mind was riled up about the images he saw, images and memories that were so strange and so familiar at the same time, causing Steve's mind to nearly halting in confusion. When the baby touched Steve, the Omega felt like time itself stopped, and for a second, he saw himself sitting in a car with Bucky, the two of them had proud smiles on their faces as they drove away somewhere… the image as much as it was a fleeting thing, it made the hair on the back of Steve's neck stand on its ends, causing his body to flinch away from the source of distress which ended up being the baby.
"Are you sure this was the only note you found? What about the note I left for you?" Tony asked, causing Steve to furrow his eyebrow and shake his head; Steve didn't find any note near the nightstand when he woke up this morning. "Are you sure?" Tony stressed, causing Steve to tense and gaze at his husband with a frown.
"Steve… why do you think that you died?" Peggy said gently as she took a step toward the man which made him blink at her with confusion.
A child shouldn't carry the sins of his Sire, no matter what people say, a child is nothing but an innocent soul that should not be thrust in a violent world. "Why look! It is the king's whore!" Someone laughed behind Steven, which made the Omega growl at that and whirl around to see the caller, taking a dark pleasure when the men flinch at the Omega's murderous look.
Was Tony happy about acquiring a baby on a hunt? Nope, he isn't. Is the baby being a vampire mutant or something a plus that caught his attention? Maybe. Is it a midlife crisis causing Tony to take the child home? Probably. But what can Tony say? He is excited to see what's going to take a place in the mansion after he brings the kid in. Besides, Serpentine had been going on and on about how she wanted grandkids for a year now, and what better way to shut her than bringing her what she asked for? Five years of marriage gives Tony the right to bring babies home, don't they?
That's how Tony spent the next hour or so, sitting under his desk as he explained to Rhodey what happened from when Rogers came living in his mansion until yesterday when he was informed by Serpentine that he was to wed her 'Baby boy' on a full moon on else…
It started with the butterfly in his stomach, and the longing to see the Omega's face again, the need to hear his beautiful voice laughing and calling Anthony by his name, it started with the Alpha looking at his phone in work, longing for the Omega to call, so he can leave his work and hear that breathtaking voice… it ends with Anthony realizing that he was in love.
Tony let out a content hum when the warmth held into him a little bit tightly… which made Tony let out a shriek as he pushed himself away from the source of the warmth that was enveloping him not a few seconds ago, keeping the chills away. "Good morning,
"Steve, please, can we leave?" Tony shivered as he gazed at the grave in front of him; he can already feel that something really bad was going to happen. Something that will make Tony scream bloody murder and run out of the cemetery, something that's worse than seeing his parents becoming zombies. Just the thought of him having to face what had faced in his teen was enough to make Tony turn around, already planning on running away, only to be stopped by Steve who held him back from hightailing it.
"I am Iron Man." Tony cooed to the Alpha, grinning at the name he thought of in five seconds flat, this was fun, playing pretend and ignore everything around him for a little while.
Steve is 30 years old. Tony is 40 years old. Peter is 10 years old but he looks like seven or eight years old. Bucky is 31.
It nearly took the whole day installing the cameras and sensors outside, not to forget rebooting Jarvis after they installed him in the reinforced attic (Thanks to Rhodey). Now, the only thing left was inside the house; Tony didn't want to admit it, but it scared him shitless how Stane managed to get inside his house when it was still locked.
' left his mouth and his face turned to a frown. "Maria! Tony is here!" Howard called out as he left the door opened for Tony before returning inside.
The bear let out a roar at the pain, causing everyone to cry when their horses neighed and bucked, sending several hunters to the ground, one of them being Tyber. "Fool, what have you done? You angered the Gods!" A hunter snarled, trying to jump away from the bear that decided they were its enemy and attacked, causing the hunters to prepare their weapons to attack before the bear killed someone. (6)
"Steve… why do you even like me?" Tony gritted his teeth as he asked that question, God, it would have been so easy to accept that Steve wanted to change and never mention it again, but no! His conscious decided to act now out of all the times, it would have been appreciated to have its backup against Pepper.
"Can you do something for me?" Tony asked with a strong voice, Steve kisses his forehead whispering 'Anything' making Tony hum at that. "Can you promise me to love me for the rest of my life?" Tony said caressing Steve's cheek, making the blond man smiled at him in confusion.
"I already thought about the future! And that future contains my baby in it, I don't care about what the world would say about me, let them talk! If you can't accept my baby, then you better get out of my house!" screamed Tony, instincts messing with him so much, that the verbal threat of someone else hurting or taking his baby caused him to go mad, the thought of his father saying such a thing to him, made him mad! Especially when he knew that it was Obadiah who was putting those words into his father's mouth, he wonders when his father was going to wake up and see that bastard as whom he truly was, just a wolf in sheep's clothes.
Tears start clouding Tony's eyes, he could only let out wet gasps when he reached the town that was unlike yesterday, too quiet to be natural, which caused Tony to let out a choked whimper and rush toward where Peggy's office was. Tony was halfway through his destination when he saw the crowd surrounding something, raising his head, he was sure he caught the faint outline of the word 'Rapist' painted on the wall in red, but someone was already trying to wash it away.
Steve slowly raked his hands down the Alpha's body, admiring Tony's torso. Without a single warning, once his hands reached Tony's waist, Steve swiftly leaned over, taking the cock below him into his mouth. Tony gave a punched out groan at the feeling of his cock hitting the back of Steve's throat, and Steve preened at that. His goal for the night was to do nothing but make Tony feel good, and it seemed that he was off to a great start.
"Oh, thank God, I don't think I can handle looking at any more invitations without crying!" Tony gave a relieved sigh, turning in Steve's lap and giving him a grateful kiss before snuggling into his embrace. "Now that we are finished with all this jazz tell me about that Harley kid that you and Peter seem to adore." Tony smiled as he gazed up at Steve, causing the Alpha's lips to twitch in amusement.
"You!" Tony hissed as he stood up, trying to tower over Steve, but instead of that, he felt like prey in the presence of a predator. "It's all because of you!" Tony snapped huffing and buffing as he tried to calm himself, lest he gains Steve's wrath and condiment himself into turning to a golden fish. "I don't know what you think is an appropriate date, but torturing someone, even if he was a dick who deserves it is a NO!" Tony huffed trying not to sway on his feet as he remembered the gruesome sight of Stane getting it from Rogers, which nearly made him faint again. "I don't know what you think I am, I may be a superhero, but I'm not a fucking Addams! I don't do the shit you do, I don't enjoy dancing in graves and torturing souls, I don't enjoy people suffering and being in pain; I don't care what you think about me, but I'm not an Addams, I'm a normal human being!" Tony growled, his energy leaving him, causing him to fall to the ground letting out a sob; God why does karma hate him so much?
"Papa!" The pup… Peter squeaked happily as he let go of Tony's hand to run behind the Omega when Tony turn around he saw a huge Alpha behind him that was hugging the child and throwing Tony suspicious looks, so much for the Alpha being big, that man could easily break him into two with his bare hands, he was huge and scary!
"Is that so?" Her father asked, resting his jaw on his fist, ordering her silently to continue; Nebula knew if she didn't give him a sliver of good news, her life will end here and now, no question to be asked. Nebula though wasn't an idiot; she was never an idiot who will come and talk to her father without a backup plan, she will live, she will make sure of that.
Pepper's hysterical yelling caused both Tony and Rhodey to turn toward the window fast, tensing as they readied themselves for the fight that will come. The only thing that greeted Tony and Rhodey was nothing; the window was open and the cold breeze was making the curtain blow around gently, but there was no one standing in the room near the window. "Pepper there is no one in here!" Rhodey called out after he took the walkie-talkie from Tony and went toward the window, looking outside just in case.
"Steve…?" Peggy breathed the name getting a hum from the man that was lying on the bed, the man in question gave a little yawn and looked around the place.
Tony watched Steve go as he leaned on the sofa behind him, nearly groaning in embarrassment as he felt a little moister in his underwear; it seems that nine years of dry spell meant that he will get wet at the smallest touch… Tony licked his lips flushing pleasantly as he tasted Steve on them, shivering a little as he bit his lips trying to stop himself from grinning like a manic…
"My husband used to say that a lot." Steven stated, causing Tony to smile a little. "Your husband sounds wise, who was he? You never told me who the lucky fella was." Tony asked, flushing when he realized that Steven was gazing at him with soft eyes full of love. "I think you might know him…" Steven stated with a smile before standing up and helping Tony, unaware of how red Tony's face was.
It was painful, it was scary, and Steve was a minute away from sobbing his eyes out. The ride to the hospital was so tense; Steve remembered holding Peter and praying to God that his son will survive. It was not the first time this happened, nor will it be the last, Steve should be used to it after two years, but even after all this time, every time his baby was facing his sickness with situations like this, it makes something inside Steve break.
…" The slamming of doors followed by the voice of an angry woman made Peter let out a sob as he whimpered, holding tightly to Steve and shaking him, hoping that he will wake up, only that Steve's useless body didn't. "
"Oh, look at that, a boy!" Tony laughed as he covered the boy, swaddling him with his jacket (Well, it was Steve's, but everything his husband owns is his, so) "Steve would be so pleased. I personally would have left you and called the child service, I have no need for normal babies; they are too much work and cry at the smallest sound we make, but you! You may just be perfect for our family!" Tony informed the baby which got him a blink and gurgles as the kid once again tried to catch Tony's finger and suckle on it, causing the man to giggle and walk out of the alley, Zemo forgotten for now because the genius has better things than to go after trash; besides, Steve would bring him the idiot's head just as he reaches their home, so why is he worked up on something so insignificant.
The kiss lasted only for a few short seconds, but for Tony, it lasted a lifetime… a lifetime of shock and terror... On one hand, Tony was kissed by a hot dude, on the other hand, that dude turned out to be an Addams, so for Tony, it was justified that he was terrified of what took a place just now. "You taste like blueberries," Steve stated as he licked his lips, the feral grin was still pasted on his stupid (Handsome) face. And just like Steve appeared out of thin air, he disappeared in thin air too, leaving Tony doing this stupid wheel pose, staring at the place Steve was in not a few Nano-seconds ago…
Several hours later Tony was hugging his baby who was purring and telling him in a happy voice about how Captain America saved them. "Mama 'as sleep an' then Cap 'as 'here!" His baby said with such an excited voice that his words sound broken, Tony just smiled and hummed at that, being isolated from any life form, made his baby distrust of others the reason that Jarvis was not here in the room with them was his baby crying and trying to hide himself in Tony's arms away from the old man, his baby's speech isn't as advanced as it should be because let's face it, even Tony can't spend every minute of the day talking or his throat was going to kill him, even if his baby's speech wasn't advance it didn't mean he was slow on the contrary his baby was so smart that he can read and write, the newspaper that Stane gave him a long time ago was a good way to teach his baby letters and numbers.
"No one said you were…" Steve ruffled Tony's hair making the Omega swats his hand which got a laugh from the older blond. "Don't try to give me another excuse so you can ditch the therapy, I know one thing or two about the excuses you are going to use," Steve said with an eyebrow rising, making Tony who opened his mouth to give another excuse shut his mouth and throw a flat look to the man.
"So where are we going?" Steve asked as he buckled his belt, and Tony took it upon himself to give the Alpha the directions he needed. After half an hour the three of them reached the clinic, Peter was more awake and was chatting Tony's ears off about some school projects and asked for a few pointers on how to complete it, which Tony was too happy to share with the pup, the Alpha was humming now and then showing them that he was listening to the two of them, but mainly he was focusing on the news he was hearing from the radio.
"I can babysit Peter today if you want, there wouldn't be any problems and my house is right there." Tony said as he pointed toward his house to the right that was two houses away from Sarah's on the same side, which caused Steve to look at Tony tiredly with a stressed look.
Harley remembered that saying in one of the neglected foster homes he was forced into; he still remembered how his foster sister laughed in his face as she said these words, snickering as she gave her back to Harley. Harley didn't want to believe in such words, after all, he was not a dog, nor was a baby going to change someone's life so dramatically, that such nasty actions would take place… Harley always believed that, until he was thrown back into the orphanage the second day after Mrs. Joe told her husband she was pregnant.
"My, my, James, this is the first time I see so many emotions passing over your cold face; if I didn't know any better I would have thought you have a crush on Steve." Tony cross his arms over his chest and gave James a smug challenging smile. "It's really funny that you think you have a chance with Steve; you, nothing but a killer that doesn't have a thing in his name, tell me, did you really think that he will ever feel something for you?" Tony grin, challenging James to say something that will prove him wrong.
"Whose room is this?" Harley asked one day when Tony entered the room that was once forbidden, his question, gaining a smile from Tony who started tidying the room a little, opening the closet and smiling when he saw the boxes of clothes and toy's he kept locked in the closet for years and years on end… Tony thinks it was finally the time for them to be put to use.
"No, you couldn't…" Tony stated, shushing Steven gently when he opened his mouth to deny the claim. "You can't protect her from the outside world, Steven, neither can I, and it is not fair trapping her here… you know what it is like." Tony's soft scolding caused Steven to press his lips tightly and look away, anger and defeat shining in his eyes. Steven's looked back at Tony than at Morgan before letting out a huff, making Tony's lips twitch into a smile. "So… aren't you going to ask me?" Steven's confused look caused Tony's smile to widen into a grin as he took in how confused and unsure Steven was. "Seriously, I drove nearly a thousand miles, and you forget the question that you have been pestering me with when we first met?" Tony had to bite his lower lip to stop his chuckle, especially when Steven's eyes lighten up with realization.
"Hey, Tony…" Steve muttered shyly, a soft smile taking over his face as went inside the office closing the door behind him, taking in Tony who gave him a tired smile. God, it has been such a long time since the two of them were together in the same room. "I read the note you left for me… did you mean what you said?" Steve's voice trembled as he asked the question that had been running inside his mind since he found that letter; Steve know it was silly being hung up on a stupid pickup line, but it was their line.
"Funny, how I seemed to miss the debriefing package that seems so necessary." Tony mock, ignoring how Natasha twisted her hands nervously before she opened her mouth to apologize. "I don't want any apologies, I want you to finish this damn story, so continue." Tony huffed, being grateful that even after all the noise; Morgan didn't wake up, which was good.
"Good morning to you, Tony, also you are late." Pepper said as she raised her head from the papers so she did frown when she saw the man look at her with a tired and pale face. "Tony, what happened?" Pepper asked tensing a little in worry, wondering what the man threw himself into this time.
"Let go of me!" Tony shrieked as he pulled out of the man's embrace after kicking his shin (Being short taught Tony a lot about kicking shins, though he was not going to admit that even with the threat of death!), Rogers after letting go of him, looked at him with so much pride and love that it made Tony's skin crawl. "Pepper, do your thing!" Tony whined as he hides behind the woman, and that made Rogers look at her and tilt his head in confusion.
The first time Peter asked about his father, his baby was six years old. It had been years since Steve came to live in Queens with his baby, six years and Steve was tired… so tired. He realized now what his mother felt like raising a child as a single parent, working herself to death, but the thing is, his mother had a degree to back her off, to make things easier, Steve, on the other hand, was a college dropout without a degree, so Steve couldn't get a better job other than working the odd jobs here and there and working as waiter in the few restaurants who accept hiring him, with his second job in the bookstore.
"Young man… are you OK?" A gentle voice asked, causing Steve to look up to see the elderly man looking at him with a concern and worried look, probably wondering what to do with Steve. Steve probably looked like a crazy maniac running away from an asylum with his hospital pajamas and wheelchair he was using.
"No! Get out! I said get out!" Tony screamed as he pushed his father, making the older man protest at that, pleading with Tony to reconsider his choices, pleading with him to see reason. "Don't come back unless you get rid of Stane, because everything you said, I'm sure he spoon feed you those words. Oh, and by the way I quit." Tony growled as he pushed his father out of the front door and slamming it shut, he continued to hear his father knocking at the door pleading with him…
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluff, violence, Steve being protective AF, and Wanda being a bitch! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Steve gazed at the stars above with a lost expression dominating his face. Steve didn't know what to do after what he saw in Tony's workshop; part of Steve refused to believe what he witnessed, even when he saw the truth with his own eyes. Today started as a good day, or Steve hoped it was going to be a good day, Steve even hoped that he will be able to see Tony after a week of the inventor holing himself in his workshop to work on something that no one seemed to know what it was… until now that is.
Oh, God please, please, please, please! Please save his baby, please. Chant Tony as he put a piece of clothes with cold water on his son's forehead, his son was whining in pain, making Tony held his tears as he nearly gags at the scent of sickness.
As for Tony he could only keen, or something equally as unintelligible. It was the first time for Tony in years, the first time he allowed anyone to touch him like this after he knew about his pregnancy; Tony couldn't help but shake and gasp at the near foreign sensations that assaulted him. Steve was just too big, pressing against his prostate and every pleasurable spot inside Tony that the Omega didn't know about; Tony wanted to come so bad now and he needs to come around his Alpha's knot. "Yes,
Arriving late for the get-together is didn't happen because of his job at SI taking a long time… well, it did take a long time, but the reason he was late was that he was busy trying to bake some pies, and thankfully they taste good, their look? Not so much he was an engineer, not a chef, though Pepper helped him with the decoration, the other reason why he was late… well, it was more of him running away from Winnie, to be honest ever since Tony's eyes fell on Bucky Barnes the older Alpha had been trying to set him up with her son, it's not that her son wasn't handsome! He just wasn't Tony's type!
"That… that… ugh! Tony, we got to do something!" Pepper who was sitting beside him with a stack of paperwork growled, her hands twitching as she heard the annoying voice of Hammer spewing more insults at Tony and SI. The Avengers, Bucky, and Natasha (Who were frowning darkly at Hammer's insulting the Avengers) Bruce (Winced at the few japing words that Hammer said about the Hulk), and let's not forget Rhodey who was hissing and cursing at Hammer like it was a horse race. The worst thing of all was that Tony couldn't even disagree with Hammer claiming him to be insane, not when he was going to marry an Addams.
"Are you sure Steven?" Peggy asked, already knowing that the man, was talking about making his arrival a public for everyone, and Peggy doesn't really know what will happen if the knowledge of Steven arriving from another universe, and if what Steven said about Hydra was true, she doesn't know what they will do.
"We are talking to you Omega; you can't just walk around after your mate destroyed our home!" Someone pulled his arm which made the Omega snarl at that and pull his arm before punching the person who touched him in the face, hard, which caused the man's nose to break and for him to shout as he backed away, which made the Omega tense and prepare himself for a fight that will happen.
"Brother Stark!" Thor shouted and raised his head to look at Tony with horror which made Steven snort and thrust his cuffed hands toward the son of Odin causing the man to pale at the sight of them as he snapped them apart after pulling them harder than any mortal can. "Please forgive him, for mortals are not believers in the old ways…" Thor said a whimper was heard in his words as he looked at Steven with begging eyes.
"Steve?! What did happened? Why are you here at this time?" That was Natasha's concerned and alarmed voice causing Steve to blink his eyes and gaze at the woman with a blank look, not knowing how he reached Natasha's apartment when he was sure that he was still in his car not a few moments ago. "Steve, honey, what's going on?" Natasha asked him in a calm voice, causing the tears that Steve finally managed to hold back to slide down his face once more as he starts crying harder and harder into Natasha's embrace…
"But sweetie… he is… um. I…" Maria closes her mouth looking at Howard who was looking at his son like he sports seven heads and starts talking in a strange language. Tony wondered what they would do if he laughed his ass off right now, probably nothing good.
"OK… great I am stranded with a loon who thinks that he is a shooting star, and my suit is only thirty percent on… just my luck." The creature said which made Steven growl at it and take one of the rocks near him, throwing it at the creature which made it grunt painfully when the rock collided with its head. "Hey what was that for, you crazy bastard!" The metal man/woman/it? Snarled as he took a step toward Steven making the star take more heavy rocks and raise them ready to throw them at that thing if it came closer to him, which the creature seemed to realize that as it stayed away from him, making Steven relax a little which was mistake number two because the creature seemed to have been waiting for the star to relax before he bounced on him, which made the man shriek and try to wiggle out of the metal arms hold, no matter how much he screamed and threatened that thing, it was of no use, and Steven soon found his arms tied in front of him with metal bracelets?
full of books and toys of all kinds; there was a small floor cushion on one side of the walls, the walls were lined with colorful paintings of dragons, bears, mountains, waterfalls and so much more. Tony could only wow as he walked through the room and pulled the curtains aside, his breath hitched when he saw a window behind it, a window with the most beautiful view of the lake as the sunset was leaving various colors streaking across the water; in the back of his mind, Tony wondered how he didn't notice this window before, especially when it was pointing directly at the lake.
"From what I gathered from Thor's explanation, I think that gaining a star's bless is harder than it looks, I don't know what you all think, but if we crossed reference Steven behavior around Tony, and Thor's words we heard now, I find that Thor's explanation is countered to the reality we are in." Peggy stated, which caused Tony to pout like five years old at her words, way to go, Aunt Peggy, you just destroyed his dreams.
… to see if the sound of footsteps will return back once again. When five minutes passed and there was no sign of someone coming back, the teen sprint into action, standing shakily on his legs before taking his suitcase from under the bed, opening it and throwing everything of necessity to him in it, before slamming the suitcase shut when he was done and rushing out of his room hoping that he will be able to leave before He comes back and finishes what he was planning to do.
"Of course, Tony, I'm here." Steve said in a choked voice like he was about to cry too, like seeing Tony cry and clinch to him like a scared child was enough to give Steve the strength to hold it in and comfort Tony. "I'm here, I'm fine, I'm not going anywhere; you know how stubborn I am." Steve let out a wet laugh, causing Tony to sniffle like a baby and hide his face in Steve's neck, taking in his scent, letting out a shuddered breath now and then.
"Hello there, my star, I hope I did not keep you waiting." Anton said in his gruff voice, which only made him shake his head and smile sadly at the older man, Anton couldn't walk fast anymore, couldn't jump or run, he can only walk slowly that he now reach the age of 90, the older man always talks to him, which made the star shine at the thought of Anton thinking of him as a family to share his secrets with him. "I am sorry, little star, I do not think that I could talk today, will you be so kind as to let these old bones rest under your light for a little while?" Anton said before sighing a little lying on the dirty ground. The star could only smile sadly at the man, knowing what's going on before the mortal did
Tony swore, and he would swear for the end of his days that he only closed his eyes for a Nano-second, a Nano-second! Somehow in this Nano-second, Steve Grant Rogers was able to use his creepy power of time and space and appear in front of Tony who doing the wheel pose; Steve was sitting on the ground Indian style purring as his eyes took Tony over, not leaving an inch unexplored, and Tony never felt naked in his life even when he was naked. "You are so flexible,
In the final scene, Tony, Steven, and their children would have moved into the lake house that Steven told Tony about, the five of them living there happily.
"Of course we can Bucky! You know I want to introduce you to my friends, I'm sure they will be happy to meet you, especially Nat." Steve said enthusiastically, sending Bucky a happy smile, and he was rewarded by getting a nod and a flush that took over Bucky's cheek causing them to turn pink.
"Oh, you are so sweet!" The woman cooed as she pinched his cheek, making Tony hide his wince at the pain he was feeling, hoping that the woman won't bruise his face badly; he doesn't want any rumor that will come when people will see his bruised cheek. "But that's OK; I will just make myself comfortable in my Stevie's room! It will be just like old times once more." The woman gave him a dreamy smile, causing Tony to shiver because the look on the woman's eyes was pure hunger. "The last time the two of us were together, we caused the Great Depression with the help of the whole Addams family!" Steve's Ma let out a sigh, happy noises leaving her as she starts floating once more, ready to leave Tony alone, finally. "I will see you soon, Anthony! Treat my son right,
"And then Papa took me to meet Harley! And you won't believe it, Tony, but Harley actually laughed at one of Papa's jokes! He never laughs, because he is always sad, but Papa, made him smile!" Peter jumped happily up and down, which made the Omega hum along with the babe, his fake smile widens a little, becoming a little genuine at the end.
The pup looked at the toy with sparkling eyes, he then looked at his father who shrugged not taking his eyes off the Omega, the pup then extends his hand to take the toy from the Omega, shyly thanking him as he hugged the toy. It made Tony smile a little as he stood up and walked away waving to the pup, if he couldn't give this toy toward his son, at least another person will make use of it because Tony knows that he couldn't handle looking at that toy again after today.
Just looking at his mother glowing like this was enough to make the fear and doubts vanish from Thor's mind; the look his mother was sending him was enough to fill Thor with the strength that even Mjolnir couldn't. The door to the throne room opened and Thor unconsciously straightened himself even more if that was possible; the sight of his father, his friends, and his father's advisors was enough to give Thor the strength to stand tall and walk into the room.
Before Tony can think of a better quip to fire back, the doorbell rang, causing both Steve and Tony to break their embrace and look at each other with confusion wondering who was knocking when their friends don't usually knock as much as a barge in. "You think it's one of Peter's friends from school?" Tony asked, trying to remember if they forgot about someone from Peter's school, Ned, MJ, and Harry, were in the backyard with a few of their classmates that Peter enjoys their company.
The calm that greeted him, made Steve take a step back, his tears rushing down his face, as fear took hold of his heart, suffocating him until Steve was left breathless. "You are not, Bucky…" Steve whispered, already knowing that he was caught and hiding it would result in nothing but anger from the man on the other side. A part of Steve couldn't help but wonder how the man managed to replicas Bucky's voice; another part of him wondered if the man on the other side played a recorded tab in hope of confusing him.
Taking a deep breath, Anton managed to calm down for a second, grumbling something under his breath as he ran his hand over his beard a few times; he had to apologize to Jamti, Anton may have held his tongue and stopped himself from saying something hurtful to his friend, but the cold way he acted and the clipped order may have caused his friend to become concerned. As soon as the two of them were out of the village, Anton would make sure to apologize to his friend, maybe even invite him for a jug of good mead he has in his possession.
"He was beautiful…" Steve said which made Tony close his eyes tightly at that and fists Steve's shirt tightly, trying to stop his shaking. "An energetic little fella couldn't stay still no matter how much May and Ben begged him to." That got a laugh from Tony as he tried to hold into his sobs. "He was the smartest boy I ever saw… at that time, I wished to have a little boy just like him, and my wish seemed to be granted because I was blessed with Peter." That made Tony closes his eyes tightly, a few stray tears leaving him.
Steve doesn't know how long he stayed in the gardens watching the children play and have the time of their lives; what snapped him out of his somber mood was the soft voice that called his name, causing Steve to blink his eyes and turn to the side to see the person who called his name. The sight that greeted Steve caused him to pause and tilt his head in confusion; the woman standing in front of him was familiar, she was so familiar with her short dark brown hair and blue-grey eyes. What made Steve's breath hitch was the child in the woman's arms, probably six months old or younger than that, seeing the child, a whine nearly left Steve as his heart sized up, pain and longing warring inside him.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness, torture (Mentioned); Steve is so in love, and finally the second part of the date is here! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
He was told a lot of things that made his head spin, he was told about colored TVs, about mobile phones, new movies, music, cultures, new everything. He was told how the world starts moving faster than it was in the forties, how lots of things changed but didn't at the same time… He was told lots of things…
"Steven you acted like Pepper was a villain, she isn't, she is my friend, so don't worry!" Tony laugh it off as if trying to lighten the mood, though his smile fell from his face when Steven's face didn't change, it was the same emotionless face with rage burning under the surface, which made Tony look at Pepper and then Rhodey with worry that was clear on his face.
Carter to her credit only scrunched her nose at the aggressive scent that Steve was letting out, an action that did nothing but gains a frown from Tony. "Well, that's harsh, darling, especially when I came to give out son his birthday present," Carter stated showing Steve the present in her hands, which only managed to cause the Alpha's scowl to darken.
Their first kisses were shared in the elevator, behind closed doors, where no one was with them, only the two of them as they felt each other, kissing, caressing, holding; Tony will admit that he couldn't keep his voice down, especially when his husband's beard scratched him deliciously. The second time they dared to kiss was in the hallway leading to their suit, both of them not wanting to let go of the other even for a second.
" Many voices shrieked as one, causing everyone to scream and try to run to the door, desperately trying to break it when it didn't open as they hoped to.
"Steve…" Tony's broken voice made Steve raise his head and look at the Alpha who was watching him with a broken look on his face; whatever Steve hoped to feel wasn't there, he felt nothing but the emptiness that threatens to consume him, leaving him more broken and hollow than he already was. Steve just shook his head, pushing Tony away from him when the Alpha came to hold him; Steve can only walk away as he tried to stop himself from breaking down.
Steve ignored everyone as he reached the lift and hit the button to the ground floor, trying hard to stop himself from feeling the elation for finally punching Howard Stark in the face, like how he dreamed for eleven years now, he hailed a taxi when he reached the street and went back toward his home trying to stop himself from laughing like a manic all the way.
"A kiss, you say?" Steve hissed through gritted teeth, trying to count to ten and stop himself from turning around and punching Tony in the nose; Steve needed to calm down, he needed to calm down, or else he will do something that he would regret. "A kiss, you say? How should I know if I could trust you when it turned out that you were cheating on me?!" Steve shouted, pulling his hand out of Tony's grip and walked away from the bedroom, needing to cool his head down or he would strangle his husband possibly ex-husband on the spot.
Tony waited for a little for Steve's response, frowning a little then throwing his phone away when fifteen minutes passed and there was no replay, which made Tony hum sadly as he lay on the bed looking at the ceiling. The sound of his phone's notification made Tony look and sit straight; snatching his phone once again to see what was written.
If Steve thought that it will be easier when they reached wherever they were going, then he was so, so wrong because when they reached the big tower Thor screamed about (Which was covered with so many mirrors and glass it was stranger than anything Steven saw in all of his long life), he was then lead to a strange room that has many things Steven wasn't even familiar with but the things he was made him relax, and with the help of son of Odin he was able to sit on the sofa.
It seems that Steve was able to pick up on his discomfort as he touched his hand gently which pulled Tony's attention to him. "Everything is going to be alright, they are not going to reach us; Shield is already taking care of that." Steve whispered in his ear gently while pointing toward the number of men and women in Shield's uniform getting led on by Natasha as she was snapping orders left and right steering the reporters away from the limo and stopping them from entering the mansion's ground.
What a good start to the holiday; Peter is going to be so sad when he realizes that he fell sick a week before Christmas. The little boy has been looking up to the holiday ever since Steve told him about his father possibly returning home for Christmas, he will be crushed when he will wake up and realize that he has been sick, with Steve's luck his baby may stay sick for the next three months because of his condition.
"Go wrap your hands first." Steve said with a nod, which made Tony relax and went to the bench taking a roll of bandage and trying to wrap his hands, which turned out to be a messy affair, it ended up with Steve laughing under his breath and helping, which made Tony flush with embarrassment, thought that embarrassment turn to elation, when he saw the pride on Steve's face after punching the bag with all of his strength…
Steve woke up with a gasp; he sits fast and nearly fell over from nausea, but he swallowed and gaze around the place. He was in Tony's room, sleeping on the floor like he always does when he stays in Tony's room, he never slept on the bed, it was not his place… Steve sighs in relief, a peeping sound made him look up to see Dum-E peeping from above him in worry, it made Steve smile tiredly at that. "It's ok, big guy." Steve said petting Dum-E which made the robot peep once more and wheel himself toward Jarvis…
'Coincidently' Natasha, Peggy, and Bucky were also inside the diner, getting their lunch break before returning back to work. With that Tony sealed the rest of the day by spending it with Bucky and Peggy, the two of them were extra friendly that day, if Tony didn't know any better he would have enjoyed his day with them to the fullest, but the truth that Tony now knew, made Tony stay on the edge, it was not only his life on the line but his Morgan's too.
"Look, babe, I know that you are nervous and probably annoyed about how my brother acted, but you have to know that the man got his reasons, beside him enlisting in the army since he was eighteen… you can say that he was never father's favorite… ever… that's why he is coming to stay with us and not in the family house…" Steve winced at that, already knowing what his Alpha meant by that, Howard was not the pleasant type to be around even if you were his favorite, and it only got worse when you are the last favorite person on his scale, which regrettably saying, Steve was in that list (With his husband's brother it seems) as the man was still angry with Tony for marrying a starving Omega artist who has nothing in his name, the older Alpha was still trying to site Tony up with his friend's Omega daughter Virginia Potts, even when the two of them have been married for a year and a half.
It wasn't like Tony didn't want to reach his baby, the thing was he can't; Tony was too frozen in his place to do anything but gaze at the person beside Morgan's crib with wide eyes. There standing beside Morgan was Steven Grant Rogers; Steven with his blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin, Steven who looked alive if not a little faded around the edge (Like mist surrounding him) Steven who was looking at him strangely before turning to Morgan like he was planning on picking her up from her crib.
When Tony came to him holding a glass of cold water ready to give it to him, Steve raised his hand and pressed it on his Alpha's nose, making the man give a confused noise of protest, but he let Steve press his fingers harder, inspecting the nose in his hand to his heart content, trying to wipe any makeup there is, but there was nothing, Tony's nose wasn't broken. "You passed out last night, that's what happened." Tony stated, still confused at Steve's action but gave him the glass of water, causing Steve to take the glass slowly, taking a few sips before putting it on the nightstand.
As you all know dear readers I changed a lot of things in the timeline of the story and one of them is Captain Marvel, I have been wondering if I should add her or not or what kind of approach I liked the best.
"Do you act with this kind of familiarity with every Alpha you meet?" Anton growled the words before he can even stop himself, which did nothing but make his eyes wide from how stupid he was to say them out loud; by the blank look, Steven sends his way and the way the Omega's hands froze mid-air, Anton was informed that he had made a huge and unforgivable mistake. Steven let go of the amulet, taking a step back as his lips curled down in disgust, the dark blue eyes, became darker as the Omega shook his head in disappointment and disgust.
Some days Steve and Tony were content with going around the village the villa located in, taking the locals' life and enjoying their time. Steve thought, the art lunatic he was, planned on going to every museum in Italy before their honeymoon was over, it was thankful for Tony and his vast 'efforts' that the Alpha spent his time home resting, doing important things… things like making Tony sings and moan until their breath left them; but details, details…
It started like that, and Steve doesn't know if he should laugh or cry; Steve doesn't know why Tony finally got his shit together when Steve nearly died, why now? Why not before? Why when Bucky saved him and nearly got shot? Why not when Steve begged for a sliver of Tony's attention? But beggars can't be choosers; Steve would handle anything if it meant that Tony would return to how he was before everything happened.
"She was… she was my mate… Peggy Carter…" Tony returned his gaze to the picture taking in the woman's features, how she was looking so bored as if she had many different things she should do instead of staying here in this place, something that made Tony frown but he swallowed and asked the next question that burned through him ever since he knew Steve was married.
"I… I am sorry… I… I got a little lost in my head, is all." The woman smiled as she took in the man's brown hair, honey brown eyes, and tan skin; the woman was sure she saw him somewhere, the thing was, where? "My name is Sarah Rogers; I used to live in this house… I… I was passing through the town and decided to come and see how much it changed." Sarah whispered, taking in the man whose face lightened up and his eyes soften as he took her in.
"You definitely are." Pepper snorted, smiling to herself before she turned to Tony and checking him out, raising her brow at the suit he was wearing. "Oh my… the suit you are wearing is telling me that you are trying to impress someone. Is it Steve?" Pepper's grin widens when no doubt she saw Tony's face become pink. "You know, I approve if you asked me, if I didn't know Steve asked you out, I would have snatched him myself; the two of us have so much in common!" Pepper laughed when Tony growl and glare at her. "Wow, just as Peggy and Natasha said, this is entertaining." Pepper's grin widens as her eyes fell on someone.
Steve froze in his place, blinking his eyes once, before narrowing them, a growl leaving his lips causing Bruce to shiver at the dark look in the Addams' eyes that promised death. "Who dared to hurt my bride? Answer me!" Steve hissed causing Bruce to shiver, clamping his mouth shut, shaking his head no, causing Steve to growl darkly. "Fine! We have a deal, now tell me!" Steve snarled, causing Bruce to let out a relieved sigh and turn to the notebook behind him, going through it.
"We really should stop meeting like this." Tony said as he ruffled the pup's hair which made the pup squeal and runs behind his father giggling as he hides from Tony's hand, which made Tony laugh a little at that. "So you are Sarah's artiest son, I should have known." Tony said with a small smile which got him a smile from the Alpha.
The queen only gave a mysterious smile at that question before a frown took over on his face, tilting his head as he tried to listen to the sounds of nature that were coming from all around them; the frown on the queen's face was replaced by a mischievous look, causing Anton to feel uncomfortable at the conspiring gaze he was at the end on. "By the way, foolish king, it seems that one of the Stone's siblings is coming this way, if you do not want them to catch you, you better hurry and leave this place." The queen advised before turning away and started walking toward the direction of the town, leaving Anton freezing in his place. It was when Anton heard a branch being stepped on that the Alpha took his clothes and start running away, the thought of one of the Stone's siblings catching him nude made him sick…
"Yes, yours…" Steve said before bringing Tony in one more kiss getting pleasant noises from the Omega, growling when he noticed the scent of heat thick in the air, signaling that Tony heat is approaching sooner than they thought, Steve can't wait for it to arrive, and it was the beginning of a new page…
." Whispered Natasha to herself, giving Steve a mysterious smile when he scowls at her; his friend's sense of humor was always the worse, it always made Steve feel bad more that it made him feel good. "Anyway, tell me, what's your new boy toy work as? You said he was in the military, what branch?" Natasha changed the conversation one hundred and eighty degrees, and Steve welcomed that change.
"What if I lost the baby, Steve? I can't… I can't…" Tony took a shuddered gasp, turning toward Steve and holding into him tightly, letting out a whine as he hide his face in Steve's neck, taking his mate calming scent to stop the panic attack that wanted to take hold of him.
"What does Steve want?" Tony said tiredly as he pulled his legs to his chest hugging them tightly waiting for what Bucky was about to tell him, he already know that Steve was probably hating him, so he, of course, will want to stay away from Tony as far away as he can, Tony tried not to let a whine at that, at the possibility of not seeing his mate or his child ever again, it made fresh tears run down his face, and he hated himself for crying in front of Barnes, but he simply didn't have it in him to care anymore.
"Thank you…" Tony choked out as he looked at Jarvis with a happy look on his face causing the Beta to smile and then return to his duty of giving everyone their breakfast, it was stupid of him to cry over a pancake, Tony knows that, but the Omega couldn't help it, because this was a proof, a proof that the Omega was finally home with his family once again… and secretly the Omega couldn't believe it, that he was celebrating his twenty-two birthday with his family, he raised his head to see everyone looking at him, not touching their breakfast, which made the Omega give a weak chuckle and raise his fork cutting into his pancakes and taking a bite, a smile taking over his face at the taste, mirrored by everyone as they start eating their breakfast.
"Good, I think…" The Alpha said just as the pup start snuggling into his toy purring in content, which made Jarvis smile and stand beside the bed to get a good look at the pup.
A month of living in the Stark tower's penthouse with his father and family before Tony stopped flinching at the sight of different shadows, a month before his kids stopped jumping at every noise and rush to sneak into Steve and Tony's bed in the middle of the night; a month before Steve managing to stop growling at anyone coming near Tony or the kids in fear of them being the enemy. A month of Tony dreaming about Peggy Carter opening the closet door and shooting him, and Steve being late to save him and their baby; a nightmare that cause Tony to hold his screams every night as he tried to overcome the terror he felt.
Anthony didn't know what to do, should he tell the Omega his real name or should he not? Most people change when they knew that he was a Stark, Anthony's face may not be recognized because of him staying out of the spotlight, but his name was a dead giveaway, it made Anthony bit his lip to come out with something fast. "Anthony… Carbonell…" Anthony ends up saying secretly sending an apology to his mother for using her maiden name like that. The Omega though just nods his head and hummed a little looking at the hospital that was getting closer.
"I see…" Nicolaus ended up saying, his words causing Steven to frown, wondering what possibly the man can see. "I saw an annoying child who took it as his duty to call me an eye patch; he reminds me of an annoying lad I once knew, do you by a chance know who he is?" Nicolaus ended up changing the subject completely by asking that question and Steven couldn't be more grateful for the man's insight.
That night though, Tony stood up, gazing at the lake that seemed to gaze back at him, Tony not knowing what to do or say; frowning at the overturned grass and mud on the shore, before taking a big breathe and return his gaze once more to the lake. "I'm pregnant… I guess you know that already, it's not like I was hiding it or anything…" Tony shifted in his place, turning his gaze to his house for a second where he knows that Pepper and Rhodey were preparing dinner, then he turns his face to the dark water that seems almost inky black in the night. "It's a girl, I learned her gender today." Tony wet his lips before biting the lower one. "Look Rogers, I don't care what you want from me, or if you want to kick me out of the house or something, but please, whatever happens, please don't hurt her, Angie said you don't like bullies, her words not mine, but what you are doing is bullying, please, just leave her alone." Tony begged, waiting for a sign that his pleas were answered, seconds turned into minutes before Pepper called him to come inside, causing him to sigh in disappointment, he turned around and start walking home.
"The baby arrived." Natasha whispered, finally getting her voice back; everyone was certain that after this experience the redhead will never sleep with Clint without protection, dreading for her life perhaps, which was a sensible decision. When the door opened everyone crowded around the doctor who opened it asking about Tony, all demanding to be the first to go inside and look at the new baby.
!' which made Tony twitch and narrow his eyes… it seemed that he had been giving Peter way too much freedom if he was talking back like this. Pressing his lips tightly, Tony walked out of the kitchen and stood behind Peter, crossing his arms as he saw the boy flipping through the channels with a boring look. "J.A.R.V.I.S. shut the TV," Tony ordered watching the TV shut down making Peter squeak and for his eyes too wide when he noticed Tony behind him.
The only person who knew about Steve was his best friend Rhodey, the Beta had warned him when he first told him about Steve, told him that the boy was a child and that Anthony shouldn't get too attached to him, because what does eighteen years old kid know about love? It made Anthony angry, but he swallowed his anger, he knew that deep down, Rhodey was only looking after him, the older Beta care about Anthony deeply that he doesn't want his fragile heart to be broken, Anthony could only assure Rhodey that Steve was nothing like that, it ends with the Beta looking at Anthony with worried eyes and a small smile.
"Papa, you are 'ere!" The pup squeals happily as he felt the Alpha's arms surrounding him in a hug after the Alpha sat on the bed.
Steve didn't care about the nurses snapping at him or even the guards that no doubt were following him, thinking that he was a crazy maniac with a bomb. "Where is he?" Steve called out when he finally saw Natasha and Clint talking to each other with serious faces, which made Steve's heart jump at that.
"Peter, where…" Steve's voice made both the pup and the Alpha look at the Omega who was looking at them with shock, but that shock quickly turns into anger and wariness. "Peter go to May's house, now!" The Omega snapped which cut any protest the pup was about to say, which caused the pup to look at the ground and then let go of Tony giving him a small wave before running toward the house next to them. "I thought I made it clear Stark, stay away from me and my child." The Omega hissed at the Alpha which froze the Alpha a little before he rushed toward the Omega stopping him from closing the door in his face.
"Your marriage is next week, I already arranged everything." That was the first words Tony heard out of Serpentine's mouth not even a day since the downfall of S.H.I.E.L.D., currently Tony was trying (Stress on trying) to eat his sandwich in peace, unfortunately for Tony, part of his sandwich got stuck in his throat and he got busy trying to hack it out to give Serpentine any consent to the new arrangement forced into him, like what? What?! Tony thought he had at least six months of peace before being forced into marriage! Not six days!
"Oh, don't say that Stevie, you were really good this time, a day or two of practice and you will master ballroom dancing!" Bucky said in a cheerful voice as he stood up, trying to hide his wince but Steve already says it and let out a sad sigh… Steve was really an idiot, what was he thinking when he asked Tony for a dance? He will embarrass Tony for years and years to come!
It started harmlessly enough; that was until Pepper sprained her ankle falling downstairs after they rushed her toward the hospital, Tony finally could breathe when Bruce told him that Pepper's ankle wasn't a serious injury and that it should be healed from one to three weeks if Pepper didn't strain herself with work. The car ride was so silent that Tony felt like suffocating, especially when Pepper pointed out that she felt someone pushing her down.
The paramedics were fast, they took the Omega and put him on the stretcher while giving him a few shots and made sure he was stable when they rushed up to the ambulance car that was waiting for them, everything was fine until they reached the pup, as soon as they touched the pup and tried to separate him from Steve, the pup start thrashing and screaming in his already hoarse voice.
"Who do you think you are, boy, to speak to me like that?!" Stane snarled as he threw himself at Tony, being stopped by the two Alphas that were holding him, and the Omega drew more courage from the arm that Steve put around his waist as his Alpha pulled him to his chest, making the shivers of fear that were wracking Tony stop because he now knew that Steve was there to protect him, that Steve wouldn't let anything bad happen to him.
"Hey Spangles, are you here with me?" Tony called out gently waving the roses under Steve's nose, making the blond man blink and sneeze, which made Tony lose it and laugh. "That trick never gets old…" Tony stopped laughing making Steve look at his aged face with a gentle look, Tony paused a little raising his wrinkly hand toward Steve's cheek, making the soldier take it in both of his and kiss it. "Hey, Steve… do you love me?" Asked Tony with a smile, making Steve paused at that and stand up to kiss him on the forehead.
Not even ten minutes passed with Steven trying to chow his cuffs off before he felt harsh winds nearly knocking him down which made him look up with wide eyes when he saw a ship about to land, frowning when the design wasn't one he was familiar with, in any of the nine realms, which made fear size Steven's heart at the thought of falling into Thanos' hands, after all, the mad one has gone into hidden not five hundred years ago, and no one, not even the farthest stars in the universe can see him.
"Son of Odin, when can we leave this realm for Asgard?" Steven asked after standing up which made the big blond flinch and look down, face going red with shame causing Steven to close his eyes tightly. "I am stuck here, huh?" Steven said through gritted teeth, already knowing the answer to this question…
"What about the eloping? What was Stark's plan? Did he ever plan on telling us of his genius if his plan worked by a miracle?" Bucky snapped as he couldn't take this anymore, Steve could be out there, no, Steve was out there, he knows that punk and he knows that the Omega will refuse to die and will give Howard a hell before he did, but the Omega was out there, with a kid! A kid that he was probably struggling to feed and clothe, why didn't Steve go to his family for help, why didn't he sent a letter, Bucky would have left just to be with Steve, did the Omega trust him so little?
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, feelings, and fluffiest fluffy fluff! And Tony finally gets a day off, and Peter is precious! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
He was in the middle of the lake, or what he thinks is the middle of the lake; not that Tony cared or anything, this was his first time on a boat, so he thinks it was fair if he made a mistake or two. "Oh, they are swimming away…" Tony muttered, almost absent-minded when he saw the oars drifting away from the boat, which made him realize that he let go of them when he shouldn't. In the back of his mind, a part of him wondered, how would he return back to the shore? Tony wasn't a good swimmer, and he was sure as hell couldn't swim without getting tired thanks to the baby bump, so how will he return?
Captain America's fucking mate, did you get that or should I repeat it a second time?" Tony mocked the man; his sharp smile was more of baring his teeth then it was a smile, and he took a dark pleasure in how Stane was unbalanced by his answer, his face turning red from anger after opening and closing his mouth and no words left the man.
Three days, that was how long Tony had locked himself in his labs without allowing anyone to come inside, blasting AC/DC music as loud as he could so that no one could come near the labs without getting a headache. Three days with Steve trying to take care of Peter, telling him that
Tony's happy mood vanish before his next breath left him, his smile slipped as he took in the lake that seemed darker than it was yesterday. It wasn't like Tony didn't notice how attached his daughter was to the lake, how she would try to crawl to it even with Tony's disapproval and him pulling her away, ignoring her cries as he took her far away from the lake as he can. It was true that Tony hasn't seen a hid nor hair from Steven Rogers ever since that night when the truth came out, but even then, Tony was content with staying as far away from the lake as he can, even if it meant that his baby would throw a fit and try to sneak to the lake only to be caught by Tony.
Rhodey's eyes widen even more if that could have been possible, and the older man looked like he was one second away from a heart attack. "No… please tell me you didn't unknowingly agree to go out on a date with an Addams!?" Rhodey plea, and Tony's eyebrow twitch, how the fuck did Rhodey knew about 'Dating an Addams 101' while Tony was thrown in blind and deaf? "Oh God, you did! How the hell did that even happened? Didn't you say that you will die before you start dating once again after Ty?" Rhodey asked making Tony grumble his answer.
"Can I really?" Peter asked as he looked between the two adults, which made them look at each other, before turning to Peter with smiles, nodding their head, causing the boy to gasp in delight. "Oh, oh, oh! Can we go to the labs this time? I really wanted to meet Mr. J that Mr. Stark always talks about, and I wanna see Dummy too! Can we go to the R&D department too? Please! And I wanna, I wanna!" Peter starts jumping around which caused the adults to shake their heads, though Tony was too hyped up to care about acting like an adult, he was just engaging Peter about all the things they were going to do today, which caused the boy to look at his mother like he wanted to go and run away with Tony right here, right now, causing the Omega's lips to twitch at that.
"So what brought you to this neck of the woods, Mr. Carbonell?" Mrs. Carter asked after a while of driving which made Tony, who was looking outside of the window trying to memorize the way, blink and turn to the woman, giving her a small smile as he returned his gaze outside.
"I know babe, and I am sorry, but, I don't have any choice in the matter…" Tony said while looking at Steve with wide pleading eyes, making the man chuckled at that and shake his head at that, which reassured the Alpha that all was forgiving, and that made the Alpha beam.
He wanted to make a good impression, probably because then maybe Tony's brother will like him, after all, getting the cold shoulder from Tony's family always hurt, even when the Omega tried to act like he didn't care about how his husband's family treating him like trash, so that day instead of getting to work on his art, Steve started tidying up the house wanting it to be spotless when James arrived.
"… Who are you?" Peggy asked, unsure of the answer, it shocked her greatly how this man talked with her with such familiarity, no one joked with her like this, even Steve always act professionally with her these days.
"It is… it's not what it seems… that bastard is lying, Steve!" Tony rushed to answer when he saw Steve stand up from the bed heading to the door… Steve can't do this, he can't do this… he can't stay here and listen to Tony telling him lies. "Nothing happened, believe me, nothing happened! It's just a kiss!" Tony rushed to explain as he ran toward Steve, pulling him from his right hand, causing Steve to jerk back and grit his teeth at the temporary pain.
"No, I was reading in the living room before someone broke the window there, when I went to chase them I found this on the porch." Bucky shifted uncomfortably before showing Steve and Tony the picture. Steve's face paled when he saw the picture in Bucky's hand, as for Tony, the Alpha let out an enrage snarl when his eyes fell on the picture.
Steve could only give a sad sigh as he continued with his way to Peter's room. Tonight was Christmas eve, and tomorrow was Christmas Day, the day that Steve promised his baby that his father will return home; Peter was so happy when he heard the news, he remembered Peter not having a nightmare that night, too excited with the thought of his father returning home after so long for something to dampen the mood.
." Tony whispered a rustle of something followed him before Steve was enveloped in a warmth that made him let out a content sigh. "
Her precious son seemed to have been in a heated argument with Bucky, an argument the brunette didn't survive unscathed by the look of it. The doll jump from his sitting position, waving his hands around and mimicking actions, jumping around the place and letting out angry little squeaks, all the while Serpentine hummed and nodded her head, trying to stiffen her laughter at the sad beep Bucky let out at the end of his explanation.
Natasha grumbled to herself as she walked toward the kitchen, huffing when the storm outside increased and the sound of thunder became louder than it was a few seconds ago. The woman let out a sigh, looking at the hallway that Steve's room was supposed to be in with a thoughtful look on her face, biting her lower lip in deep thoughts.
It took Rogers a few minutes before he let out a hum, slowly, inch by inch; Rogers reached up and brushed his fingers against Tony's sides, dragging across the wet cotton of his t-shirt. "I thought I lost her… I thought I lost my baby, thank you for saving her…" Tony whispered, choking on his sobs when Rogers gathered him up in his arms and crushed their bodies together.
A voice whispered in Steve's ears, in Steve's mind, causing Steve to stop in his advance as his eyes widen and his breath hitch as he felt the Space Stone power surge inside of him…
"You… you had the antidote? You were able to make it, right? You gave him the antidote, right?" Peggy asked, her eyes widen and her voice was so full of hope; and for a second, Tony's heart pounded like crazy in his chest, the thought of his father giving the antidote to his mate, nearly made him tremble, could his father have a change of heart? Tony's hopes though, had vanished as soon as Howard said the next words, leaving only confusion and pain and helplessness.
"Yes." Tony simply said, narrowing his eyes at Steve as if excusing him of chickening out on him, which made Steve's lips twitch up into smile; it has been two years since Tony was fond, and in that time he had progressed so much with therapy and gaining himself back making everyone around him proud and happy.
J.A.R.V.I.S.'s words made Tony twitch even more, especially when Tony knew the name his parents choose to stay under the radar; Carbonell? Really? His mother's maiden name? No wonder no one found about them, who would have thought that the two of them would choose such a loosely name to hide under. "Prepare my suit, J, we are going for a hunt," Tony growled as he turned around stumping to his workshop, his mind already going through many painful ways of killing his parents and turning himself into an official orphan, fuck Howard! Tony knew that Howard would have done something like that, but he never thought that his mother was capable of doing such a thing and ignoring him when his near-death experiences were always podcast on TV daily.
"I gathered that." Steven said with a hiss as he stood up, putting a little weight on his injured leg. "Just as I gathered that I am in fucking Midgard!" Steven snapped which made Thor jump and lower his head, already feeling that the wrath the Ancient one is going to condiment Midgard too was not going to be light. "And you!" Steven said as he pointed to the man in the metal armor. "If anyone is crazy, it is you! Crazy bitch!" Steven hissed, taking satisfaction from the act of the metal-clad man screaming at him and nearly attacking if it wasn't for those two (The one with the Shield and the one with the dark scowl) holding him back. "As for you son of Odin, you are going to find a way to bring me back, and tell me from where the fuck did this show up when I was already told it was supposed to be hidden!" Steven said as he pointed at the necklace which made Thor pales, even more, when he gazed at it…
"Promise me, you will try…" Tony whispered making Steve look at his husband's sad eyes, in the end, Steve nods his head making Tony smile at that tiredly.
"I see baby, it looks amazing doesn't it?" Tony said after he sat up, his pup giggled at that and returned to his exploring, leaving Steve and Tony alone. "Steve…" Tony said nodding his head a little getting a small smile from the man himself.
"It was alright, though, they start boring me in the end," Tony stated with a satisfied smile on his face and the dark twinkle in his eyes that told Steve everything he needed making the assassin let out a dreamy sigh. Steve could only purr in content as he steps on the gas harder until the speed reached 250 KM/H, which caused Tony to do nothing but giggle and grin madly, ignoring the screams and shrieks from the people outside when they early ran them over.
"She is your daughter," Angie said with a strong voice, causing Tony to raise his head, the doubt shining in his eyes as he took in Angie who was looking at him with soft understanding eyes. "She is Tony, she is your daughter. The only thing Steven Rogers did to her was saving her from death, she is completely yours…" Angie's words caused a sob to leave Tony's lips; he was trembling so hard that he could only hold his baby tightly.
So as we all know I published another Stony story, this time with Alpha Tony and Omega Steve, the story is called 'A Child's Love' if you want heartbreak, hurt/comfort, and family feels, and Howard nearly being killed by everyone for being a shitty person, then this is your story
"You won't dare!" Betty hissed, causing Tony to raise his eyebrow, challenging Betty, which caused the woman to groan in defeat. "Fine, God, you are even worse than Clint when he sticks his nose in something. Come with me, I will tell you, if anyone from the clinic asked, I will say you forced me and I hate you." Betty grumbled as she stood up, knowing damn well that Tony won't stop pestering her until she told him what he wants to know, and that is she didn't he will hack the clinic server and by then she will wish she had told him, just to spear her of what will happen.
"What can you tell me about him, that wouldn't endanger you and end up killing you?" Steven said which made Loki look at him with a start of a smile playing on his lips.
"Do you like it? Serpentine let me chose it. I found it on YouTube and it sounded catchy, so I decided why not?" Tony stated, his grin widens even more at the grimace Rhodey let out, no doubt wondering why decided to go to YouTube to choose a creepy wedding song; what can Tony say? He was trying to find a creepy and dark song, and he found several of them he liked, so he decided to use one them.
?" Tony asked, from the tone of his voice the man was defiantly frowning, something that Steve doesn't want him to do.
"Amazing…" Steve's voice is reverent, impossibly awed. One of his hands moves from Tony's hip, slipping low behind Tony's ass and rubbing where they're joined. "Tony." Steve let out a shaky grunt and for the first time since the night started; Tony heard Steve's control start to slip. Tony clenched around Steve, and he was rewarded by a guttural moan from his Alpha and a stuttering thrust. "Perfect, you're so
"That was not the deal!" The Omega snarled and hissed which made the Alpha give a dark look as he leaned toward the Omega making the Omega growl at him and hiss, hoping that the Alpha will drop dead and relieve Steven from the headache that took over him.
"Mommy!" Peter squealed happily as he runs toward his mother, making the Omega smile at that and pull the pup in his arms cooing to him gently which got a purr from the boy. "Mommy, Mommy! You won't believe it! Aunt May says she is going to have a baby! Can I play with it, please, please, please, please! I promise I will be really gentle!" Peter said as he jumped happily around the place, his words made Steve look at the Beta with a hopeful look, getting a shy smile and a nod in return.
"Steve Rogers?" someone asked, causing Steve to blink and turn his head to the person who called him, giving them a confused smile to the man behind him, he doesn't know him nor the man seemed like he was working in the hospital. "Hail Hydra!" Before Steve can make any sense of what he heard, he let out a pained gasp when he felt pain ripping through his body, causing him to freeze. Scream can be heard around him as the man fell on the floor, followed by Steve, who slid down to the floor; his body couldn't hold him anymore.
he was already planning to tell whoever was listening about his day, already excited at the idea of even when the weather was a little on the freezing side considering that it's the middle of Winter.
That threat made Tony look at the ceiling with wide eyes, not believing what he was hearing, he was just sassed to death and back by this AI and he sower he saw his mother's ghost looking at him like an angry beast when he heard Edith's words. "Who made this AI? I demand to know the bastard so I will kill him!" Tony said after turning to Steven who was trying to hide his laughter with a cough and failing miserably at that.
"I know, Jamti, I already know all of that!" Hissed Anton, his words causing Jamti to huff and for his lips to curl down in disapproval, which did nothing but cause Anton to grit his teeth and look forward. "Even if I was interested in the queen like that, I would not have perused a relationship with him," Anton stated, his words did nothing but make Jamti roll his eyes and grumble something under his breath.
"Goddammit Rogers! Why are you ignoring me? It has been two weeks!" Tony finally snapped when he finally saw Rogers walking into the kitchen were Tony was making coffee, after two weeks of locking himself in his room with Barnes. It just happened, Tony just snapped, it was actually within Tony's right to snap at Rogers, for the man start ignoring him since they brought the Winter Soldier back, it was so unfair, so unfair for Rogers to leave him alone after everything said and done, so unfair for the man to abandon their six months relationship to return back to someone who was more machine than human, it was so unfair for Rogers to leave him alone after he… after he…
Steve sighed like he already knows what Tony was thinking of and looked at the Alpha with a tired look on his face. "Tony it's better if I stayed here, at least then Peter wouldn't rush toward the door and getting hurt in the process if you don't want me to stay here for you at least think of Peter." The Alpha said gently which made the Omega look at his side then at his pup that let go of Steve and rushed to him.
The blond man was followed by a female Alpha, she had fiery red hair that fell over her shoulder until it reached her waist that was covered in intricate braids and bright emerald green eyes that scanned the room with bone-chilling precision. Steven felt himself tense in place when the woman's eyes fell on him and stayed there, Steven's glare only made her smirk, and her smirk widen when she waved the double-edged ax she carried in one of her hands, and Steven didn't react other than scuffing at the display. Next was a man with a dark skin whose scowl rivaled even his on a bad day, he was swinging his sword while his eyes inspecting the people inside of the room like they were preys. But as soon as they stepped inside of the room they stepped aside to give passage to the leader.
"Do you think I did the right thing?" Tony asked his voice was a choked whisper as he saw Betty stump to her house anger radiating off her in waves. "What if I messed up Harley's chance of getting better? What if I caused him to relapse? What if I stopped him from having the family he wanted? What-" Steve couldn't let Tony continue stressing like that, so the Alpha pulled him in his arms and hugged him tightly, waiting until Tony calmed down a little before letting him pull back, but not letting go completely.
The silence was the only thing that hung between Carter and Tony, mainly because Tony refused to talk with the woman, hiding in the closet as he waited for the action of the crazy woman outside. This Peggy Carter… the woman left the realm of unstable and entered the realm of crazy; she was crazy… crazy for denying that Steve has moved on and got married, crazy for believing that he would want to see her when she continued to act unstable and assertive, crazy for breaking into someone's home and trying to steal their child; how did the doctors treating her missed her psychopath side?
"What's going on boys?" Tony asked when the two finally appeared before him, Tony couldn't help biting his bottom lips to stop his laughter, especially when his eyes fell on Peter's cheeks that were buffed in a protest at how Steve refused the boy every time the little munchkin wanted to go and play with Harley. Seeing him, Peter grinned happily, thinking that he finally manage to have someone in his corner that would let him play with his friend.
It was only when the door finally closed behind them that pieces of clothes start flying around the place as the two of them stumbled back toward the bed, their mouths refused to part as they kissed to their heart content. Tony never knew what unlocked the fever in them last night, but whatever it did, it made Steve more feverish, hot, refusing to let Tony out of his sight for a second, refusing to part for anything unless he was touching any part of Tony.
"Yeah, so here is the thing… look, I'm not interested, it wasn't about you being an Addams, it was about me not wanting to be in any relationship and you being bushy, would I have liked you if you were normal? Sure, I would; date you? Probably, but the thing is, you are not normal, neither am I, and this new version of yours is nothing but a cute face and no mind, a boring one, in fact, I actually prefer dating an Addams than making you change who you are just to be with me." Tony tried so hard to ignore the-madly-in-love/heart-instead-of-eyes look Steve was sending him, and Tony knows that he will regret this later, but he prefers an Addams chasing him instead of this carbon copy who will be miserable for the rest of his life, this was the only apology Rogers was getting, the Tony Stark way, the 'Me gonna live the rest of my life regretting that I made you turn into an Addams again but I feel like shit about last night' way. "Look, this is how it will end, I will take those roses, it's your way of saying sorry for showing wearing this and having that stupid idea of me loving you if you changed yourself, you on the other hand are going to get rid of all these clothes, though keep this new haircut, it's better than the shaggy mess it was before, and lastly, we are never gonna speak of this ever again, got it?" Tony narrowed his eyes at Rogers, ignoring the So-in-love sighs the man just let out, he took the roses out of Rogers's hands and pushed Rogers out of the workshop not commenting on how easily Rogers accept being herded out. "Oh, and before you go, black is your color, you look terrible in every other thing, bye." Tony ignored the mad grin on Rogers' face closing the door behind him with a sigh.
"Yes, Rhodey-bear?" Tony paste a smile on his face as he gave the bottle of warm milk to Pepper; his friend already had Morgan in her arms and was making silly faces trying to make his daughter laugh. Tony hummed as he turned toward the stove, platting the eggs, pancake, and sausages, and putting the dishes in front of his friends.
In the end, Barnes decided to come with Tony, in hope of explaining to Steve what happened, and hope that the Omega didn't ban Tony from seeing his son again which knowing the Omega, he will rip his head off before he got a word out. Reaching Steve's house, the Alpha fidgets uncontrollably which ended with Bucky being the one who knocked on the door, wincing when the door was thrust opened so hard after a few minutes that it slammed in the wall behind the door, and an enrage Steve got out of the house glaring daggers at both the Alphas, making them cower, wishing that they could disappear any second now.
"Then you will never see the happiness you have until you lose it." she said as she pointed toward Tony, which made Steve return his gaze to the Omega with a confused look on his face, frowning a little at the warmth he felt in his heart when Tony gave a small laugh at something the woman he was talking to said… he wanted the Omega to smile at him like that… the Alpha stood up as he went to talk with the Omega, hoping that the Omega will give him a little time so that he can apologize and maybe… just maybe…
Tony was frozen in his place, heart hammering in his chest, he wanted to go to his pup and pull him back into his arms, taking him far away from everyone and anyone, protecting him, the gentle grip on his arm made him turn to his mother who was giving him an understanding look as she steers him out of the room and toward his therapy.
It should be him, it should be him on this bed now; it should be him suffering for all the mistakes he did, it should be him. The last thing Tony can do was tell his mate that he loves him, at least he has to tell him that he loves him for one last time, it was the last thing he can do; Tony though, he can't, he was frozen, he was hurt, he was speechless and useless, and Steve was going to die without hearing that Tony love him more than he loved anyone in his goddammit life…
"Mama, Papa! Grandpa is here!" Peter's loud voice broke Tony and Steve from their moment, causing them to pull away with flushed cheeks to gaze at Peter who was scrunching his nose as he gazed at them. "Grandpa is here, and I cleaned my room!" Peter stated before he turned around, causing Tony to shake his head and chuckle, trying to stop his laughter when he heard Steve grumble about cheeky brats.
But in the end, Tony managed to calm down enough to start thinking about his pregnancy without panicking about dead children and the mess that was his first pregnancy. After thinking long and hard, Tony realized that part of him was content with the pregnancy, even happy that he managed to get pregnant; Tony knew that Steve would have his back and is probably overjoyed at the notion of Tony being pregnant, even when the two of them adopted Harley not even three months ago.
Tony pout as he struggled to locate the correct approach for telling his family that he was going into heat, only to groan in exasperation and set the fork down, years ago he would have blurred what was troubling him without a care in the world, and in this case, Tony was certain he will need to take a page out of his younger self's book. "I am going into heat." Tony ended blurring out which made silence to land on the dining table, all except Peter who was still trying to feed Goose, who was gazing at Tony with a perplexed manner when he blurred out the unavoidable.
"I get inside by using the door if you are a wonder; Peter, wanted to see you, it's late and he said something about you taking him to the park tomorrow." Steven stated, which made Tony scowl for a few seconds before letting out a sigh, gazing at the clock hanging on the wall with a thoughtful look on his face, wincing when he saw that it was 3:00 a.m. he wondered what kind of hell his boy will make him go through to wake him up tomorrow.
"I am so sorry…" Howard said but Tony already blocked what his father was trying to say, Tony shake his head at that not believing what his father was trying to tell him, refusing what his father was trying to tell him when Tony felt his father touch his shoulder gently, he lost it…
Morgan on the other hand start whining and moving around with no care for her wellbeing, trying to make Tony let go of her, which made Tony bite a curse and hold tightly to his baby, being mindful not to hurt his baby, or rumble her clothes last she got cold. The hair on the back of Tony's neck stood on its ends when suddenly, Tony starts hearing splashes of water behind him, causing Tony's breath to still in his chest.
"Tony… what does he mean?" Steve asked in a shaky voice, denial and hurt warring inside his heart; part of Steve wanted to deny and gloss over what the stalker said on the phone, not wanting to believe what the man had implied when he talked to his husband. Another part of Steve, the most rational part of him, was making the connection to what the man implied with the behavior Tony exhibit in the past few months, finding it matching in the most painful way there was. "What the fuck does he mean, Tony?!" Steve screamed when he saw his husband continue to look away from him, refusing to answer his hidden plea; why won't his husband answer him? It is a simple question with only a few words to clarify it, why was it hard for his husband to tell him the truth?
"Yeah, I'm fine; he was just being an asshole." Tony said waving the whole thing away, giving his friends a soft smile, hiding the uneasy and shakiness he was feeling, his mind was still going over and over what Ty just said about the monster in the lake, which caused shivers to go down Tony's spine.
