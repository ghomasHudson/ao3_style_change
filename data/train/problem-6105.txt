“Steve–”
“That’s a lot of people, sweetie,” he says.
Warnings: NONE.
“Tony--”
“It’s fine,” Tony blurts. “It’s... God, it’s more than okay.”
Prompt: "Imagine that HYDRA or Red Skull is back and after Steve and Tony and Steve are at some kind of staged mission to capture them. At some point they are supossed to act like Steve got hit and died. So they get to it and Steve 'dies' in Tony's arms, but Tony gets a little bit too emotional and distressed, becuase he starts to think how that would be if it was true and he never told Steve how he felt about him. So Tony just kinda curls around Steve and he can't stop crying."
he’s grinning, even though she can’t see his face. “He’s handsome, witty, and cool as fuck. A lot like me, actually.”
“I can’t believe we just did this to Chopin, Rogers,” Tony says.
“Doesn’t mean I’m not gonna keep trying,” Steve says, and grabs a corner of the blanket Tony’s wearing to pull him in. “And next time I hear someone call you a…” he falters, like the simple act of saying them out loud is a crime, “a killer, or a– a warmonger, or any of that absolute
“Hmm?”
Steve chuckles, and rubs his nose against Tony’s in an eskimo kiss. “I just told you, Shellhead.”
awfully hungry,” is all he says.
“Wasn’t planning to,” Tony says, and Steve’s takes advantage of it, moving his head back to Tony’s shoulder. It’s warm and real and very much alive, and as the rest of their team-- their family-- focus on the food and company once more, he sends a quick prayer of thanks. “Steve?”
“Then sleep,” Steve says, but the soft, soothing brush of his fingers along Tony’s hipbones just make him more awake.
He nods.
“Just do it,” he says, “like ripping off a band-aid.”
“Well, what do
. Because the things he’s writing, I'm thinking he’s definitely not indifferent.”
“You’re not as quick as you think you are, though,” he tells Tony. “Distracting me won’t change the fact that we’re not buying a dog.”
“Figured what out?” Tony's confused, because hadn’t they been talking about Steve a minute ago?
“No, you...”
“I don’t know if you would’ve wanted something a little more...I don’t know--”
Tony shrugs, looking out at the fork in the road stretching out ahead of them.
But as fun as this new friendship is, Tony doesn’t forget how it started, and now there's a veritable clutter of all their jabs and jokes and poorly disguised innuendos for all the world to see:
“Can’t think of anything better,” Steve says, and smiles when Tony just pulls them closer together.
Tony doesn’t manage to keep the tears from falling down his cheeks, but they’re quickly wiped away by gentle fingers. “I love you too,“ he breathes, and God knows he’s never meant it more than he does now. "Even with all this sap, you fucking meatball.”
“Freezing your ass off on the roof of your cabin
“Takes after her old man,” Tony mutters, but leans in to press a press a kiss to their daughter’s soft hair, relishing the happy little squeal she gives him in return.
Clint and Sam whine their displeasure even as they lick the rest of the tomato sauce from their fingers, and Natasha chews her pizza silently, narrowed green eyes peeking out from under her hood as she sits curled up beside Bruce.
Except it's not like that at all.
“No,” Tony says. “But speaking of changing, I gotta ask,” he runs a hand along the outline on the Iron Man suit printed on Steve’s apron. “Who do I have to thank for this little number?”
“It’s just Christmas,” Tony tells him. There’s a faint, barely there ache in his chest when he thinks about Christmas at the ol’ Stark mansion, but then Steve’s smile softens into Tony’s favorite smile-- that tiny, happy curve of those lips that he’s wanted to kiss for years-- and Tony’s heart gives a familiar, pathetic little lurch.
“Didn’t hear you complainin’.”
“Enough to make my day,” Steve says, pressing a kiss at the base of Tony’s spine.
“Thank you,” Tony says politely, because Pepper is looking expectantly at him. “And you-- Shaggy,” he calls out to the other man, who glares. “You must be Bucky?”
“Did you?”
“And you don’t want to do all that fun stuff they’ll probably be doing?”
“Because I love you,” Steve nods, and pulls Tony into his arms again.
“This was nice of you to plan,” she tells Tony later, after a busy hour of helping to corral, feed, and watch over six hungry toddlers. The party set-up had continued after, and now she’s curled up into one of the Tower’s ridiculously comfortable couches, heels kicked off and half a bag of balloons left for her to blow up.
“Okay,” Tony says, and it comes out like a sigh of relief.
“I’m not-–”
“Yeah, I’m sure it was. Just like the last time you dropped the other banana peel.”
,” he says. “
Steve looks up at him from beneath long lashes. “You always this bold, Mr. Stark?”
Warnings: NONE.
“You were... you were out of it for a couple of minutes. God, I feel like shit--”
“No it’s not, you were just walkin’--”
Tony has to shoot Darcy a knowing look before she leaves with a flip of dark curls and a wave. “So,” he finally says. “Is this something I should expect more of from you, Cap?”
“I’m, uh, I’m sorry about this guy,” Blondie stutters, patting his dog’s head. “He’s a sucker for rainy days.”
,” Tony muffles his face into Steve’s shoulder. “I always forget how fucking sappy you get after missions, Jesus...”
“You wish--”
“...help me up, then?” Steve asks, taking the hand Tony offers him a second later. “Careful, don’t want you joinin’ me down here.”
,“ Tony growls, but whips around to face the doors when they open, and at the faint sound of his team in conversation, he takes a step back.
“Oh really?”
Tony makes a tiny, longing noise. “My baby girl, I’m gonna miss her today,” he sighs. “Tell her I loved her, won’t you?”
“No, it’s… it doesn’t,” Tony stutters, and when he looks up, Steve’s surprised to see a bright blush on his cheeks. “Tell me about them?”
It takes Tony an embarrassingly long amount of time to realize who the voice he's just heard belongs to, but once he does, it takes everything in him not to scramble out from underneath the top half of his Iron Man suit. Instead, he takes a breath to try to calm the sudden pounding of his heart. "What, did you want me to be waiting at the door?"
"Oh... fine," Steve moans.
“Macawoni.”
Peter looks over at Mr. Rogers from the corner of his eye-- when Tony does the same, he sees the blond trying and failing to hide a smile-- and then pats Tony’s shoulders. “Mr. Steeb likes Cap’n America too!”
“Perfect. Love you,” Tony says, then leans down, grabs a fistful of the blond’s shirt, and kisses him square on the mouth.
“I’m quaking in my boots.”
“You love it.”
“It’s alright, baby,” he smiles, kneeling down until they’re all at eye level. “Go ahead and pick a name. Whatever you want.”
day that’s been ruined. “And you’re the one readin’ and walkin’, who does that?”
“You’re such a boy scout.”
“I hate you all,” Clint grumbles, even as Tony catches the familiar, relaxed quirk at the corner of his lips.
, hiding behind a pile of boxes stacked in the middle of the room like they’re playing a fucking game.
“Mister Tony,” Blondie says, “All you need to do is ask. Steve Rogers here, at your service.”
“Good job,” Tony says, not bothering to hide his smile at Steve’s blatant interest in his sandwich. “You still hungry?” From the corner of his eye, he sees their teammates look over with grins of their own.
“Alright, pumpkin,” Tony pats his thighs. “Auntie Pep and Uncle Agent are gonna be here soon with Cat’s bed and all his toys, so you get to pick where you want him to sleep, yes?”
“I know there’s a princess here who’s crazy for some yummy orange slices, right?” he coos, brushing baby soft hair away from her eyes as he settles down beside them. “And you get to spend all day in bed with Daddy and Papa, doll baby. Lucky you!”
- - - - -
“Especially you, Brock,” Steve says tightly. “Next time you even think about it, you’re gonna have to get through me.”
He’s gonna owe Bucky so much for this.
“Can’t force ‘em to do that either, Cap,” Tony shakes his head.
Tony stops him before he can pull them further into the hallway, and instead walks them over to the couch. “Sweetie. Cupcake. Gumdrop. Baby,” he drawls, pushing Steve down, and then climbs onto his lap.
“S-sorry,” his boyfriend gasps, shoulders heaving a couple of times before he straightens back up. “Shit, I’m--”
That smile Tony loves is back in full force, as beautiful as the first time, and if he never looked at anything else, it still wouldn’t be enough. “I just want it to be perfect,” the words come out before he can bury them, deep down where the rest of things he’ll only ever say to the boy beside him are hidden.
“I sent him down to the cafeteria. He called while I was in line at Starbucks, so he owes me. Really, Tony, I thought you’d grown out of this?”
But Steve just wraps an arm around Tonys shoulders, and leads him after their team. “That makes two of us.”
“Steve, come on–”
“Don’t be a grinch, Tony,” Steve says, “come on, sing alon– oh, here it goes…
“This isn’t funny.”
“Thought you might want some dinner.”
planes?”
you stop right there. I can fucking
“This isn’t even on the plane of how bossy I can be, baby.”
?” Steve raises an eyebrow, and... huh. There’s a tiny, minuscule curve to his lips that Tony hadn’t been expecting.
"An' even though we don't have mommies, you keep us safe an' you play with us and watch lotsa moobies with us, and you make macawoni all the time!"
“Fuck yeah,” Tony breathes, and even though it’s impossible, he wonders if Steve can hear how fast his heart is beating.
“He doesn’t–” Steve shakes his head, and tries not to sound as lovesick as he feels. “Not over me.”
“…Shit. Okay, yeah, that’s a pretty good reason,” Tony nods.
“I look
“Pot, Kettle,” Rhodey points out.
“You just want to take her from me.”
But instead, he just shrugs, and continues. “So... sue me for wanting this trip to be the best.”
“Yeah, well I thought I’d gotten over my army kink, but obviously...” Tony waves a hand in Steve’s direction.
“No,” Steve replies, a gorgeous blush settling onto his cheeks and down the neck of his FDNY t-shirt. “Not yet, at least.”
“Always. But that doesn’t make what I said any less true.”
that this is the most beautiful man he’s ever seen
“Ignore me,” he sighs. “‘M probably makin’ no sense–”
“Tony--”
“I can handle it.”
Even with his heartbeat still rushing, Steve holds out his hand. “Steve Rogers, at your service.”
“Don’t worry, I already got you a pony too, stud.”
“No, Buck– just one.”
"Yeah, I...
“…wanna repeat that? I didn’t quite get it–”
- - - - -
Tony comes home hours later to nothing but silence.
“You couldn’t even wait a whole night, could you?”
"I didn't fucking know if--" Stark stops, and only Bucky can see the way his fingers are digging into his palm.
– it’s not w-working.”
But then Tony’s lungs start burning to remind him he’s only human, and he pulls away with a breathy ‘
Tony’s sure Steve can feel the smile that blooms on his face. “It’s the least you could do.”
Steve shakes his head. “Oh yeah, no, that’s– that’s fine too, yeah, sure.”
“Jesus Christ,” he groans, “I’m gonna throw somethin’ at you.”
“I’m... I am,” he whispers, and he’s still crying but it doesn’t matter because Steve’s lips quirk up into a smile, and just like that, the screams in Tony’s head finally start fading to whispers.
His daughter nods, huddling into his side with ease as her tiny hands fiddle with his pajama shirt. “Daddy?”
“Yep,” Tony pops the ‘p’, “Just, y’know, in case you wanna help me pick the best spot to hang it up in.”
“Then you’re gonna have to give me something. Ransom note, script for your ransom video, super villain monologue— take your pick. Unless it’s torture. I’d like to, y’know, skip that.”
“She could’ve at least cleaned you up first.”
Mission accomplished, Iron Man.
“What’ve we been doing this whole time?”
“Yes I do.”
“Yeah, back atcha, sunshine,” he grins. “Even if it’s all your fault that we have to deal with this shit–”
"Obviously."
“How the fuck can it be yours?” Tony asks.
“I-- I didn't,” he stammers.“...What the
And really, he knows that’s not normal, but when has he ever been normal? He’s a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, and he’s been kidnapped more times than he can count, for more reasons than he can think of. Not to mention his time in Afghanistan—
“Baby, you have
“I’m gonna take that as the compliment it is.”
," Tony says, and kisses Steve.
“Uh, Macaroni and cheese,” he says, but it comes out more like question, and Clint sees the brunet’s eyes go wide in what might be panic. They both know Cap’s not going to buy it.
“You could, uh... You could come with us?” Steve blurts out, because Tony’s eyes suddenly aren’t as bright anymore, and the thought of Pepper sitting home instead of being out just feels
Tony just lets out a fond huff.
“He does when his Captain asks him to,” Steve replies, suddenly sounding a lot closer than he had seconds before, and a moment later, Tony lets out a happy sigh when warm, familiar arms are wrapped around his waist from behind.
“I said I’m in love with you,” Steve whispers, lips trembling and fists clenched at his side. The tears in his eyes hit Tony like daggers. “And I’m terrified.”
“We need to talk about these,” she pulls out the magazines and splays them out on the hood of car. Half a dozen shots of Tony and Steve walking around the city look back at them-- each of them wearing shirts or hoodies or baseball caps emblazoned with each other’s symbols in nearly all of them-- with a different variation of the same question as a caption:
, with a determination that’s almost frantic in its intensity, and Tony reciprocates almost immediately. A faint, distant part of him is aware of their noises they’re suddenly making-- little gasps and deep breaths that would almost be embarrassing, if he ever bothered to give a fuck about any of that-- but then Steve takes one step closer and turns his head
“Y’guys ever gonna take those things off?” Tony tugs the onesie-covered leg digging into his chest– he has no idea whose it is– and huffs out a laugh at the indignant yelp he gets in return. “There a reason you’re all in here? You hiding from Cap?”
PhD,” Tony scoffs, and then squeals when Steve flips them over, covers and all, and starts peppering kisses all over his face. “If this–
“Well forgive me if I’m not Susie-fucking-talks-a-lot when I get snatched off the street. Actually, scratch that, my mouth’s definitely gotten me into trouble through the years— some of it good, if you know what I mean,” he says, winking. “My assistant never hesitates to ream me out, either way, and as hot as she is when she’s angry, I started tuning her out a long time ago. I’m kind of busy getting out of these right now, though, in case you haven’t noticed? Unless that’s why you’re here, in which case I’m going to have to ask you where my driver is, and if you hurt Happy, I’m going to have to kick your ass. Or at least settle for seeing you behind bars for the rest of your life—”
When Clint sees it, he takes one step into the living room and almost walks out.
“You might need another one of these, then,” Steve holds up the tray, and Tony takes one with a smile.
“It’s no trouble at all,” she replies. “And just between us... I think it’s cute.”
He’s relieved to see his daughter looking livelier than she’d been before, even smiling into Tony’s side as they sit bundled up on their bed.
“You sure hit the shitty jackpot with me,
Steve doesn’t even flinch. “Watch me,” he says, and just like that, he’s Captain America, all squared shoulders and defiant eyes.
does. It’s not long before he realizes he’s lost because he can’t even look at the road-- the anger in Howard’s face is seared into his eyes and
”You…did this for me?”
“Uh huh,” she says, golden curls bouncing when she nods. “Wan’ some, Papa?”
” Steve growls faintly. “
?” Steve asks his, lips now pressed to Tony’s forehead, and Tony feels the last clouds of doubt leave his body like breath in a storm.
Bella rolls over onto the now empty space beside him, bright blond curls gleaming in the morning light, and grins up at him. “Thank you f’my pwesents.”
Steve obeys with a sigh, arms quickly finding their place around his middle again. “Just a m-minute, alright? Then w-we’ll get back to w-work.”
Steve lifts his head, squaring his jaw in determination. “Or a date.”
. Just one big thing that changes a lot of little things. Literally.
“I swear it was an accident.”
Tony finally forces himself to look away, facing two other men lounging around in the chairs by the window, both of them grinning like children.
“Nah, I’ll be back. Besides, I can tell Stark’s itchin’ to get to know you better.”
The moment they step out the elevator doors, every head turns their way.
"Because this is a bed, Steve-o, do keep up. Doing alright there, Barnes?" Stark turns to Bucky.
Tony doesn’t need to look at Steve or Pepper to know they’re rolling their eyes, but he just walks towards the man and holds out his daughter. “Support the head,” he orders.
“Remy Rogers?” Bruce asks, and not even Steve holds back his laughter at that.
“Sweetheart,” Steve starts, but Tony just shakes his head.
Tony scoffs. "If you thought I was gonna do anything but find you after the stunt you just pulled..."
Tony makes grabby hands-- he has no shame. “You’re stalling, stop stalling.”
Tony freezes, eyes zeroing in on each of them. The labels are yellowed and dusty, but even from where he stands, he can just barely make out the curly, elegant hand of Jarvis’ writing. “That–” he clears his throat, glancing quickly at Clint’s face before looking away. “Those are–”
“Tony--”
But Steve barely moves, still staring at Tony with those wide, ocean blue eyes. There’s a blush blooming high on his cheeks, and the more Tony looks at him, the farther down it moves. “
Tony barks out a sharp, incredulous laugh. “Well you’re just full of shit today, aren’t you?” he sneers, and watches her sigh into her handcuffed hands. They’re pale and delicate, but he’s surprised to see hints of calluses and faint scars.
“I’m a riot, Rogers!”
It takes Steve longer than usual to finish his lunch, and Tony decides it’s all Barton’s fault.
Steve rolls his eyes again. “I’ll have dinner ready on the table, too.”
“Okay, no, I’m not,” Tony says loudly, “because it’s the truth, and I don’t fucking know why you’d bother–”
Tony does.
” Tony purrs, “
“Stop apologizing,” Tony says. “Just keep looking at me, okay? Keep looking at me…”
“Not here,"Tony mumbles. "Obviously. He’s probably making breakfast for all you lucky ducks.”
Pepper scoffs. “No you wouldn’t. Just feed it and talk to it, and set reminders that you’ll listen to.”
Steve familiar smirk looks even more adorable on his smaller, younger-looking face, and he squares his thin shoulders as far as he can. “I’m gonna make you eat your words, Stark.”
“Aw shucks. Me?”
"You're not funny."
“Shut it. Just sit here and look pretty while we enjoy these babies-- here ya go, little miss,” he gives her the Santa hat cookie. “Feed, my child.”
But this is HYDRA.
“Really?” Tony grins.
Almost every head turns their way, and the room grows quiet as Rhodey’s voice cuts through the cacophony around them. Steve can feel the steady presence of his friends behind him, but the second he spots Rumlow and Hammer at Tiberius Stone’s table, he’s all but running in their direction.
“Understatement,” Steve says under his breath, only to furrow his brow in pretend seriousness when Barnes and Rhodey both glare at him. “And then?”
Tony nods. "That's a yes. Yes, I'll go to prom with you, sunshine."
Stony Christmas prompt #15: "What were you aiming at?!"
be this fucking cute,” Tony mutters, and feels his heart skip a beat when Steve smiles knowingly.
“Good morning,” Steve tells her, depositing a full plate of pancakes, eggs and bacon in front of her a second later with a grin, and she returns the greeting with one of her own.
Peter nods enthusiastically, and then widens his eyes. “
ENJOY!
“Well yeah, this is pretty tough to beat,” Tony says. “I honestly don’t know why I ever do anything else, I could just stay here forever.”
“I’m... used to a schedule. You’d probably have to tie me to the bed to keep me in it,” Steve says without thinking, and it’s only when Tony’s whole body starts shaking with the force of his laughter that he realizes what he’s said. “Shut up, you know I didn’t...”
Pepper’s the only one in his room when they bring him in some time later, but Tony doesn’t know how long it’s been, seeing as all he remembers is a blur of bright lights and the bliss of pain medication as it kicked in.
Steve gives him another smile, and then proceeds to coo over Ellie as she licks kisses all over his neck. “Who’s a good girl, huh? You are, yeah, you are-- oh thank you for that!”
“You’re so screwed, Tones.”
“And you don’t think I need you? How do you think I feel when you pull the same fucking thing more times than I can count?” Tony yells, and suddenly every moment he’s been on the opposite end is suddenly coming to mind like a flood; the anger and the helplessness, and the sheer terror are almost enough to drown him.
“–wouldn’t stop tellin’ the whole building how she beat James Buchanan Barnes at Monopoly.”
Tony pushes down the swell of embarrassment with everything he has, and stands back up. “Guess that answers that, huh,” he takes the frames off, “I’ll just– I’m gonna go call the, the um, the optometrist– buy a couple of thousand contacts–”
“I love you.”
It’s like sunlight, and for the first time in his life, Tony feels nothing but utter, incandescent happiness.
Because you’d hurt yourself trying to reach the top cupboards in the kitchen?
Summer of Stony prompt #2: “Are you ready?”
“Boo fucking hoo…” Tony rolls his eyes, and bumps shoulders with the blond as they make their way further into the lot.
“…You’re hogging the blankets, sweetheart.”
“Sweetheart,” Steve says calmly, even though his smile looks more like a grimace as he single-handedly stands there carrying their 42″ flat screen. “If you don’t open this door in the next second…”
It’s not until after he comes back in with a pizza box on his arm that he spots it, and he almost drops his food when he recognizes the handwriting-- neat, slightly slanted, but undoubtedly elegant.
“Shit, sorry,” Tony blurts. “Didn’t mean it like that, Pep says I’ve got a mouth on me, and yeah, sometimes it goes off on its own like a reflex-- but really, you can’t blame me, you’re hot as f--”
Rhodey’s eyes-- half-lidded and hazy from alcohol-- meet Tony’s and then Steve’s resolutely, before he sticks his head in between the bars, and says: “He s-sits’n a throne... of
“Jesus,” Steve wheezes, eyes still warm and bright as they meet Tony’s again. “Are you always like this?”
“Steve,” Shaggy puts a hand on his shoulder, but Steve-- god, that’s a beautiful name, for a beautiful man-- shakes his head.
"Like hell I would," Tony says, the firmness of his voice at odds with the tender, utterly gorgeous smile on his face.
Tony shivers where he stands. “You fight dirty,” he purrs. “But don’t talk the talk if you can’t walk the walk.”
“I‘m not goin’ anywhere, sweetheart.”
“I’m fine,” Steve says, and then holds up a container Tony barely notices he’d been holding. “I just… Clint drove me over because I wanted to, um, give you a little something to say thanks–”
Natasha shrugs, tucking her head under his chin, and her deep, steady breathing keeps him from asking any more questions. He pats her fleece clad back mindlessly, the low hum of the elevator surrounding them until it dings to signal their arrival.
“Just like the one you showed me ten minutes ago. Just like the rest of the little Iron Men in your bowl there,” he points to Steve’s plate, still half full of Avengers shaped macaroni. “Do they taste good? Go on, eat ‘em and tell me when you finish.”
” begins playing sometime later, he’s so into his work that he only hums the tune at first, but it’s not long before he’s mumbling the words, and then before he knows it, he’s screeching the words out into the empty workshop.
“Hey, Barnes!” Clint’s voice echoes from the living room. “If you can’t even do this one job– ow! What the hell, Nat? Why are all of you jerks? Hey, stop hogging the spawn!”
eyes that are bright and glassy.
“‘Sniper’ isn’t a verb, Tony–”
Steve rolls his eyes even as he feels his cheeks grow warm. “Just shuddup and watch the door, will ya?”
“Tony–”
“But I not tired.”
“I’m…” Steve gasps out one breath, then another, until he unfurls again and looks up at Tony through bright, watery eyes. “I’m o-okay. I’m fine, I s-swear.”
“It’s okay, Buck. Go on, sir,” he says.
“That I’ve had the money for this whole thing since the beginning.”
“That’s better,” Tony nods haughtily.
Tony glances back at him incredulously. “You kidding me, babe? Nobody can resist this,” he waves the phone around. “She’ll have ‘em eating outta the palm of her hand.”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks, when he returns.
“You really don’t see the way Steve looks at you, do you?”
March Prompt #12: “I miss you.”
“It wasn’t!” Thor defends him.
“It’s Christmas Eve, where else would I be?” is all he says, careful not to jostle Tony too much as he arranges their bodies to fit together, and breathes in relief when he’s not pushed away. “I’m not goin’ anywhere.”
"Thanks, Pep. I just--”
He’s almost bored by it all.
“Stop what, Edward?”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #16: “Why are you blushing?”
It feels like hours before Tony wrenches his lips from Steve’s, only to let out one last moan when he looks up and finds those baby blues dark with hunger. “Okay, y-yeah,” he gasps. “I remember...”
"...Tony?"
- - - - -
“I love you.”
“Toast,” she shakes her head, and Steve winks at her when Tony stuffs a slice into his mouth. “Happy?” he asks, after swallowing a bite.
“Wait a minute. Are you jealous?”
but here it is.... I hope you guys enjoy it. :)
- - - - - - - - - - -
“Yeah yeah,” the brunet sighs, giving him a fond eye roll, but he’s still smiling as he looks back down. “Daddy’s just being boring right now, princess, but I swear he’s not that bad--”
Tony doesn’t look away from the television as he shakes his head. “Never mind, it’s-- ignore me.”
“Lucky me,” Tony leers, and grins as the other man covers his flaming face. “Sorry, I kid-- well no, not really, because look at you. But my mouth has a habit of, y’know, running off on me, sometimes I just say things and I don’t always mean them. Ignore me.”
“I’m not. It’s just... Maybe I like knowing you miss me.”
“You sure?”
“It’s my fault,” Steve says. He can’t even look Tony in the eye-- oh God, not
Not the point.
“Y’sick?” Tony asks innocently, lips brushing against the top of his Captain America plushie. It makes Steve hold the boy even closer, pressing a kiss to his soft, brown hair.
But it seems today’s not their day-- or maybe it is, because really, any moment Tony spends with his baby girl is a good one-- because he sees Steve’s eyes soften, like they always do when their kid’s involved, and then a second later, he hears their daughter’s sweet, whisper soft voice.
Stony Christmas prompt #9: "You're insane."
Stony Christmas prompt #2: "What are the odds that you'll forget this even happened?"
“Leave it there, I’ll have Happy pick everything up someplace else.”
“So how was Papa’s day?” Tony asks, casually shoving an entire chocolate muffin into his mouth. Their daughter takes one look at him and does the same with her own banana nut muffin, cheeks bulging adorably like a hamster.
“Magic word.”
“I’m not judging,” the man shakes his head. “I’m just curious as to why you’d let a man– who’s got more blood on his hands than the rest of us in here put together, let’s be honest– why you’d let him join the rest of you heroes in protecting the world. Tony Stark is hardly the first person that comes to mind when you say ‘hero’–”
“Who,
“Only with you,” Steve replies, and laughs at Tony's glare.
“Merry Christmas, darling,” Tony feels Steve mumble into his hair, and he leans back for a short kiss before pulling climbing out of the mountain of covers and reaching over to pull their daughter out of her crib and down between them.
The paramedic takes care of that for him, shining a light in his eyes. “Are you sure?”
“She’s beautiful,” Steve whispers, and the awe Tony can hear in his voice warms him more than he already is.
Warnings: NONE.
"Who’s your favorite painter?” she asks with a smile, and Bucky suddenly looks eager to hear his answer. That’s a first, Steve thinks.
equal,” he replies, throwing his hand around again. “But... y’know what’d really make m’feel better?”
“For what?”
Warnings: NONE.
Steve smiles sweetly. “I’d rather spend time with you,” he says, and Tony tries and fails to hide the blush spreading over his face.
“Is that Clint?” Tony laughs. “Is he... drunk?”
“Because!” Bucky snaps, stomping his foot eagerly to get Steve’s attention, as if his shrill voice wouldn’t have done the trick alone.
"I'm willing to negotiate."
“Your mother would kill us,” Tony laughs, and it’s more than a little wet, but Steve just pulls him into his arms, breathing in the scent of machinery and oil, sweat and metal, and underneath it all, the indescribable scent of Tony.
“You...” Steve sucks in a breath, eyes wide with disbelief. “You can’t-- you really think that?”
Tony’s heart skips a beat. “Don’t have to say anything, sunshine,” he replies softly, reaching out to tap the familiar numbers on Steve’s pec.
“Where’s your better half been all day?” Clint asks, grinning when Tony rolls his eyes.
And why is there a loud ringing?
And when the movie’s over, when the team whispers their goodnights as they go back to their suites, Natasha takes the throw from her couch and settles it on top of her boys. She walks toward the elevator but doesn’t press the button because she knows Steve’s still awake, and some little part of her just wants to see more of their interactions.
“Dat’s wrong...”
, he thinks with surprised relief.
Warnings: Mentions of death??
“I don’t want her. I want you.”
“Bastards,” Barnes grumbles. “Made me miss the farmer’s market on Saturday.”
“—everything that’s not your science experiments—”
“If you die, I’m going kill you.”
“I love you too,” he rasps, and leans back in to taste the smile on Steve’s face.
, Steve.”
“I’m sure he does it because he knows it annoys you,” Steve says.
“Hmmm, I appreciate you too, stud,” Tony looks up at him through dark lashes.

“It was an insane amount of boxes, Tony.”
“You can’t just give people dogs, Tony.”
we can stay in bed all day.”
“Among other things,” Tony says, in between laughs.
“Fuck yes,” Tony breathes shakily, letting Steve slide the ring onto his finger. “God, you... we’re really doing this?”
“What?”
“Come on, Rogers,” he whispers, and he’s never begged more for anything in his life, but there’s no answering laughter, no light banter or warm encouragement.
“I can’t sleep.”
“Right.”
"You are not fucked up." Pepper says, and Tony loves her all the more for it.
“Tony, that— god, that doesn’t make any sense,” Pepper laughs.
His steps are slow, and more than a little stunted, but he finally comes to a stop in front of the canvas. “Wow,” the word is out before he realizes he’s even said anything, and his hand reaches out to touch the brightest spot in the picture.
Steve hums. “If you’re here, it must be.”
names?”
“I know,” Steve says, all earnest blue eyes and honest smile. “Now come help me in there, ‘cause I can’t do this without you.”
Tony had no idea a person could be so small.
heavy, sweetheart.”
“Yeah, okay, I’m breaking up with you.”
“Unless he turns out to be an asshole,” she continues, with a pointed look at Tony, “he wouldn’t have been flirting if he was attached.”
“Happy birthday, big guy.”
“Did you think I forgot?”
“You didn’t think we would stay home, did you?” Natasha asks quietly. Her eyes are softer than Steve can remember them being in a long time, and he feels his chest grow warm with affection. “
“Nothing,” Tony lies. “I’m all good, big guy.” From the corner of his eye, he can see Barnes, Romanoff, and Barton waiting by the elevators-- in their uniforms, they look more intimidating than ever-- and so he steps back even though all he wants to do is press his chest to the blond’s. There’s an all-too familiar wave of panic threatening to take over him that, on any other day-- on any other mission-- he’d brush off with an easy smile and a sharp quip.
“It’s already yours, genius.”
“Good, because now I can’t stop thinking about macaroni, and my stomach is killing me.”
“Yeah, well I think I’m owed some time off. I’m not lettin’ anything keep me from my first Christmas as a married man.”
“That’s one word for it,” Tony mutters, lips quirking up helplessly when Blondie laughs.
“Yeah, look at all the pretty trees.”
But his boyfriend just shakes his head, and turns on his side as he pulls Tony closer, until they’re face to face. “Maybe later,” he whispers, all tousled hair and baby blue eyes hazy with sleep. “For now, all I wanna do is kiss you.”
“Sure am, boss,” the man nods.
More than one eye widens in anticipation, and Tony hides his grin behind the rim of his mug.
“I just–”
“Tony–”
I was hoping they’d taken it down.
“My plane, my schedule,” Tony waves his hand lazily. “I will go when I’m good and ready, Captain Rogers.”
“Hiya back, handsome,” Tony hums, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck to keep them close even after their kiss ends. “How was the mission? How’re you?”
“Yes, sunshine?”
“Heya, Cap,” Tony can’t help smiling, and even with his eyes barely open, Steve smiles back, a thin quirk of his lips that nevertheless helps to lighten the heavy weight on Tony’s chest. “You okay?”
he’s in trouble.
He’s not sure when Rhodey leaves, but the next time he looks up, they’re alone again, with the heart monitor beeping steadily and the whisper soft feel of Tony’s hand in his.
Warnings: NONE.
“How ‘bout me?” Steve’s voice echoes around the room, and a second later, the man himself stands beside the bed again, a satisfied grin on his face as he hugs a plate to his chest.
Tony can’t stop staring. He’s not even sure he’s breathing as he looks at Steve, at his smile and his gorgeous baby blues, then moves down past the deliciously wide shoulders to--
“Sorry,” Steve says, even though he looks anything but as he holds out a mug. “Forgive me?”
“Yeah, for your boring values and promises, and those soda machines you’re gonna put at the end of the hallways–”
“Because... I’ve been dreaming about this since we were sixteen,” he says, and he has to swallow once, then twice, to get rid of the lump in his throat. “Because you’ve been my best friend for as long as having anyone has ever mattered. Because when I think about getting outta here and seeing the world... there’s no one else I wanna do it with, except you.”
would’ve settled it, too. He lets go of Steve’s hand to practically fling himself all the way to where she stands, and Steve would’ve worried about losing his little brother in a crowd, even one right next to the school, but the little girl is watching Bucky like a hawk, and the old man’s smile makes Steve feel inexplicably better.
He never actually said his name, it could’ve been anyone. He tries not to think about it that day, and the days after that. Tony doesn’t mention it and he doesn’t act any differently than he usually does, so Steve’s pretty sure he doesn’t remember.
It’s utter
But there’s nothing comical about the look on his face.
“I am not in love with Han, Tony,” Steve chuckles.
Barnes’ eyes widen. “I, uh… I don’t– maybe get someone… Steve.”
“What?!” Steve says, more than a little louder than he’d been talking a second ago, and Tony somehow manages to resist the urge to kiss him for it.
Civil Union Fest Prompt #13: “Quit Staring!”
“Justin Hammer?” Steve grins.
“As long as it’s delivery, though, ‘cause I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty comfortable where I am.”
“Worth what?”
“Good. And I’ll make it worth your while.” Steve’s grin is soft and happy, and full of promise.
“Shut it, Buck,” Steve glares at him. “Now, are either of ya going to tell me what happened?”
Steve looks up from his fiddling hands at the warm, comfortingly familiar sound of Tony's voice, and feels his heart skip a beat when their eyes meet. He's on his feet a second later, feeling more nervous about him being there than he is about the conversation Mr. Coulson's currently having with his Ma on the other side of the door beside him.
“Steve--”
“Honey bear–”
- - - - -
- - - - -
“They’re...” Tony waves in the direction of the couch, where all of their Iron Man-clad teammates munch on their pizza slices, and almost laughs when he spots a glop of tomato sauce on the top of Barton’s hood. “I feel like a cult leader.”
Tony wakes to darkness.
“--it takes one to know one, now, doesn’t it?--”
Summer of Stony prompt #26: “How did we end up here?”
Tony nods, and leans over to press their lips together. “We’re set, babe. Trust me.”
“Steve--” he breathes.
The words hit Tony like daggers, and he sobers up so quickly, it’s almost impressive. “Oh shit, shit, sorry, hey– Cap, breathe! Shit, fucking
“Thank fuck,” Tony mutters, grabs Steve’s face in his hands, and touches Steve’s lips with his.
“But I’m still not getting that hot rod red helmet.”
“The person inside… is a woman. And she’s refusing to talk to anyone but the two of you.”
“Better keep that mouth shut before we make you,” another goon says from over Rumlow’s shoulders, and Tony’s almost slides down to the floor when the tight grip on his shoulders is released.

“Only a penny, Rogers?” he asks, and their car swings with as Steve throws his head back and laughs.
“Really?”
“What?”
, sticks the note, and knocks before he can talk himself out of it:
Steve smiles down at him. “Take a picture with me.”
,” Steve repeats, voice low and soft once more, and Tony’s nodding before he knows it.
“Hey...”
Shit.
“Steve--”
“Well I am my father’s daughter!”
Tony pouts. “Carry me,” he says, and makes grabby hands at Steve.
“Remy, w-- oh,” Big, Blond and Beautiful stops when he sees Tony, and quirks his lips into a smile that makes his gorgeous blue eyes even more beautiful. “Um, hi.”
“I thought that was the plan for the next two weeks,” Steve smirks, and leans in again to nip at that plush, reddened lower lip.

“Well, not
“And where--” Tony clears his throat to smother the laughter threatening to break through, and works his arms through the sleeves of the coat Steve’s holding out for him. “Where, uh, are they?”
“That’s right, honey. Is he helping you fight the bad guys?”
But Steve just grins, and holds him tighter. “Turn that frown upside down, mister. Come mornin’, they’ll be here with all our stuff, you’ll see.”
“Yeah,” Steve replies, but he’s fidgeting beside Tony– all hunched shoulders and hesitant baby blues– and he has yet to pick up the needle. “I’m just…”
“The bastards were pushing me!”
,” he glares at Steve, “finished all the milk this morning, so, y’know... Anyway, hand it over, sunshine.”
“If you say so. There something you need?”
“I like it.”
“Is this--”
“Thank you.”
“Just what?”
He hears the other man step further inside, and the low bustle of the SHIELD Med-bay dies down as the door closes.
The first time it happens, Steve bolts.
“Sure thing, doc.”
Warnings: NONE.
“Morning, sweetheart,” he whispers, running a hand through the brunet’s soft, sleep-tousled hair. “Up and at ‘em...”
“You didn’t have to,” Steve says softly, and feels his heart skip a beat when Tony’s eyes move down to his lips.
Four minutes later, Steve has to hold back his excited chuckles when Tony stumbles into the kitchen.
” Steve continues, and Tony almost brains himself on a table when he can hear the blond’s voice beyond the door.
A golden eyebrow lifts in interest. “Your clothes?”
“No fucking way, babe. You were the one begging me to come back to bed–”
“Don’t be mean!” Steve’s laughter fills the room easily and god, Tony’s missed the sound; his heart feels fuller just hearing it.
“Fine, I’ll behave,” Tony puts a hand over his heart, and then, with a lewd bite of his lip– “
“There you go. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, all that jazz,” he teases, even as his heart is beating so hard, he’s sure Steve can feel it.
At the man’s table. Smiling like the little shit he is as he points to Steve.
Tony’s fingers freeze.
As long as he sticks to his Chunky Monkey.
Because Jarvis?
“Sap,” Tony laughs, a low, faint thing that doesn’t manage to drown out the steady pitter patter of the storm beyond their window. “Want me to warm you up some more?” he purrs, fingers wandering down to the warm skin of Steve’s hip in a soft caress.
“I know, I–” Steve gasps, “I just, I know h-how… how much you hate th-this. A-and I–
The last thing he sees before the doors close is Barton sticking his tongue out at him, and Steve’s bright, amused blue eyes as he laughs.
“Well damn.”
Inside the suit it’d been easy to forget, but now, it’s suddenly all he can think about.
“-- see, this is what I get for going outside--”
Steve closes his eyes, and breathes in the scent of Tony’s hair. “The Tower always feels a little colder when you’re gone.”
“It’s beautiful,” he says against Natasha’s head, scarlet tendrils tickling his lips as he does so. “Tony’s going to love it.”
“I think I’m in love with you.”
“Maybe you should get off me.”
“It sure makes you look somethin’, Mister...”
“What is she staring at?”
“I think there was a compliment in there somewhere?”
“… No.”
“They’re the same shade of blue as your reactor.”
– they’re waking him up. Tony,
Tony shakes his head. “I’m good, peaches,” he smirks. “I’ll have a nasty bruise for a couple of days, but I got off good compared to your buddy. I was just... just keeping him company.”
“I’m tired–”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #9: “You need to wake up because I can’t do this without you.”
Warnings: NONE.
“Okay, yeah, I get it, I remember–”
“Doesn’t sound your type.”
“We’re gonna get so much shit for this,” Bucky mumbles, sparing them a glance over his shoulder. “You’re lucky we love you, you crazy punk.”
“Jesus Christ, Steve. It’ll take us hours to put ‘em down.”
“Tony.”
Warnings: NONE.
“Well excuse me for worrying about my ass,” Tony scoffs. “And yours, for that matter.”
”So romantic,” Steve sighs.
“I don’t have twelve hundred bucks, you little shit!”
“Always.”
“Morning, sunshine,” Tony’s voice is low and whisper-soft against Steve’s temple, and he looks up to find the brunet smiling down at him. “You’re just in time for breakfast.”
Blue eyes-- Steve’s eyes, his Ma’s eyes-- widen in distress. “Why not?”
"You can't fool me, babe."
“Steve--”
Tony pushes the chart down. “You can find out if you say yes.”
Steve’s head snaps his way, guilt etched all over his face, and just like that, Tony’s anger fades into bone-deep relief.
“And–”
“Why are you at my doorstep at three in the morning?”
“Loser buys dinner?”
“Sounds perfect,” Steve nods, and then Tony stops breathing when he leans in and kisses Tony’s cheek. He’s big and warm and he smells
But mostly, he’s overwhelmingly in love.
“Steve,” he says instead. “It’s
He takes advantage of his early rising-- it’s a habit he’s not sure he’ll ever unlearn, no matter how tempting it is when Tony, soft and warm from sleep, purrs at Steve to
Steve’s laughter feels like the best thing he’s ever heard. “I figured you’d be less likely to deck me this way.”
“Tony–”
Tony wakes to a soft, steady beeping, and an even softer light from the corner of his eye.
Tony barely turns his head to face the man lying next to him. “I know,” he mumbles, and then quirks his lips into a lazy smirk. “You gave it to me this morning. Multiple times. And then again after breakfast. And right before the party–”
The plate slips from his fingers.
“It’s art.”
” she cries out, scrambling back on top of him with a pout.
Over the steady patter of the rain on the roof and the booming thunder still in the distance, Tony hears a loud, clear voice seconds before a soaking golden retriever comes bounding into the gazebo, splashing water all around as it shakes its fur dry. Ellie yips from his arms, wriggling down a second later to circle the new dog, and Tony jumps up to go after her just as a man runs in to join them.
“Are you gonna let me get a burger, big guy?” he asks Steve, but the blond shakes his head. “Steve--”
“Agent Coulson just– he just called me. Tony…”
” the paramedic asks.
Warnings: NONE.
“I know you said it wasn’t all my fault, but… the last thing I wanna do is make things hard for you.”
for knockin’ me out,” Tony pats his flushed cheek. Sam laughs harder, and Pepper rolls her eyes. Bucky just rolls his eyes, and taps Steve’s shoulder.
“I wish I could hate you.”
“You taste like heaven.”
“Tell me a secret.”
“I can’t breathe.”
“Oh, um, no,” Steve stutters, “my friend, he, uh, he told me to, but I… hadn’t said yes.”
“Yes sir,” Tony winks. “Did you miss me?”
“Open your eyes,” he says as he closes his own, aching and burning from lack of sleep and from the tears he swears no one will ever see him cry. “I’m so sick of this room– I’m so fucking sick.”
“An Avenger,” then Tony’s cheek.
pleasedon’tpunishhimplease--” Sam jerks him away from the mic with a tug at Steve’s sleeve.
the one to raise him, so he probably deserves all the crap his pet throws his way.
“Sure. I like seeing him fawning over you.”
“Pepper,” he says again, after he’s let her mouth run its course. “Pep—”
God, is that blush never going to stop being so hot? “
“Doesn’t hurt to double check,” Steve smiles, boyish and rogue, and god, Tony falls in love with him all over again.
“For your troubles,” the blond says, pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek and
“You want to go back inside, then?” Tony asks, a faint tendril of disappointment unfurling in his chest.
“‘M cold.”
“God,” he whispers, lips brushing against his baby’s cheek as she grabs a tiny fistful of his shirt and holds on. “I can’t–”
“We’ve never seen it live,” Steve points out. He looks so cute, cheeks flushed from the cold, blond hair hidden beneath a frankly ridiculous Iron Man beanie, that Tony can’t even summon a glare at his friend--
“I’d apologize,” Steve says, lips brushing against Tony’s hair, making him shiver. “But the only reason I even got the blue shell was because you banana peel’d me.”
“Keep me busy and you won’t.”
“I’m a big boy now, Rhodey,” Tony says, feeling his face soften into a smile as he takes a deep, steadying breath. “I can take it.”
“Tony.”
“Sure thing, sunshine,” Tony nods.
It's not the kind of kiss Steve's expecting, because things had been building up to something hot and heavy, and more than a little dirty.
Tony’s shaking his head before he’s even finished asking the question. “No, you can’t seriously-- Steve, what the fuck?”
Of course, it ends just as he’s getting comfortable on the small couch at the back.
Tony scoffs. “Tell me that again when you’re dripping wet with milk and have tiny hands shoving Froot Loops down your shirt.”
“Yes, yes, and yes. You’re not getting rid of me that easy, ” Steve chuckles, and Tony feels the warm tendrils of relief run through him as he leans his head on the blond’s shoulder.
“I don’t know why.” The words are out before Tony can stop them.
Steve looks down. “Alright, I guess I deserve that--”
Steve’s finger tighten around Tony’s. “You sure, sweetheart? Because there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting a couple of minutes with...”
“Yes sir,” Steve nods, eyes twinkling with admiration, and then-- “You’re gorgeous when you’re like this.”
That’s more like it.
“Why?”
“I was remindin’ ya to keep this covered for the rest of the day.”
“Look at me,” she says, and that’s when Tony realizes he’s looking back down at Steve again. “Remember yesterday,” she continues, and even though they’re whispered, Tony hears the words clear as day. “
“Do you not want to be with me anymore?” He asks, and his eyes are already blurry but he will not let the tears fall.
pick something like this.”
“I think I fell in love with you a little more tonight,” Steve whispers into his ear.
Tony groans playfully. “Sap.”
“What does that even mean?” Steve steps closer. “Tony, you can’t keep putting yourself in the line of fire!”
“English?”
“Hey, look.” Hammer’s grin is cruel when he spots Tony, “it’s the little orphan.” There’s a ripple of laughter from his stupid little clique, but Tony rolls his eyes, ignoring the deep pang of grief his heart gives at the reminder. It’s been seven months, but it hurts enough to make him wonder if the pain will ever fade.
“Hmmm?”
“Cap--”
Steve’s smile is as bright and as beautiful as it’s been all day. “Hey, Shellhead?”
Tony nods. "His heart. Since it seems I, y'know... have it."
Steve’s cheeks are starting to hurt by now. “Okay, yeah.”
“Oh. Good,” Tony nods.
“‘m hungwy,” Tony says, and Natasha smiles yet again at the familiarly determined set of Steve’s tiny jaw as he looks up as well.
“Alright,” he announces, when the minivan– and thank every fucking god this spell is only temporary, because if he thinks about what he’s driving any longer, he might get hives– finally stops in the semi-crowded parking lot of
But Barnes shakes his head. “Nonooooono, no cin’mon...
“As long as you keep your promise. She needs a lot of attention, Tony.”
“One strip?”
His husband’s smile is all sunshine and happiness, and so much like their daughter’s, it almost hurts. In the best possible way, of course. “Not even a little bit. Makes me fall a little more in love with you, actually.”
Blondie rubs the back of his neck bashfully. “Did you, uh, come back for more cuddles?”
“You like him?” he asks breathlessly.
“Pepper likes pink t–
Civil Union Fest Prompt #10: “I swear it was an accident.”
“Fine with me, Dr. Stark.”
So what would you do if there was ever an issue you disagreed on?
“No you’re not, Buck,” Steve shakes his head. Tony sees his eyes run over the brunet’s arm. “Is it dislocated? They need to set that right in, you know what Ma says--”
“Stay with me. Just...stay...”
I remember finding my empty carton back in the freezer.
“Pep.”
“Mr. Stark… you’re a genius, right?”
Summer of Stony prompt #4: “This is, without a doubt, the stupidest plan you’ve ever had.”
“Who has semi-sentient pets that he already takes care of?”
“Yeah,” Tony whispers, looking utterly at peace as he drifts. “Got y’both here.”
-- fucking b-believe you’re here--
Blondie grins. “Thanks. And anyway, I just... well, I thought it’d be nice to... maybe someone here needed the support today, and if I could give ‘em a bit of a boost, I’m more than happy to.”
“--because I don’t see anything in there that resembles human thought.”
And then, just like that, he’s alone.
Steve shakes his head. “No, Tony. Take me to Coney Island sometime?”
“Thanks,” he whispers, and doesn’t need to look at her– he wouldn’t even if he could– to see the tiny, genuine quirk of her lips as she leaves him alone. Alone with the silence and the soft rush of blood in his ears as his heart beats in time with Steve’s.
“They better be,” Tony scoffs. “I don’t come out trudging through Central Park for just anyone.”
“Mommies take care of us,” Bucky explains, with another decisive nod. “Mommies cook y’food, a-an’ dey give you baths—“
There’s only one person who’s not currently in the tower, and Clint decides that as annoying as it is to hear Stark and Cap gushing and flirting and laughing with each other, he’s going to stick around right now, because it’s also pretty fucking entertaining.
"Ah, ah, ah," he tuts, “Here she comes.”
doorstep. They’re all my doorsteps. My building, my doorsteps– and this isn’t even a doorstep, Steve-o. It’s a whole floor, so–”
“It’s so nice to have the family together,” Natasha murmurs. She’s leaning against Bruce’s shoulder as the two share a bright blue Snuggie, and Tony’s chest warms with fond affection for the two of them.
“Took you long enough,” she says, jutting out her chin in an all too familiar way. “What’d you do, stop for drive through?”
“JARBIS!” he calls out, and Steve’s quick to send a wave, crumbly and sugary as his hand is.
Warnings: NONE.
,” Tony hisses, but doesn’t pull away from Steve’s hand on the small of his back as they get up and all but run off the platform. “Cap, calm down–”
“Why did I even come here?” Tony mutters. “You’re not being very supportive right now.”
And when the final notes end, Tony stands there in the middle of all his creations, grinning and panting like a lunatic. “That felt good,” he sighs.
“It never gets easier.”
“Until then, how about I speed things up for ya with Glenn Miller’s ‘In The Mood’?”
“Loser treats winner to a day out at Coney?”
Stony Christmas prompt #30: "You're beautiful like this."
“I do. And Captain America’s always right, so don’t even fight me, mister.”
"I can't hear you over the sounds of me being the best mom," Tony sends, only to fall silent a second later as he seems to realize what he's said. His eyes are bright with wonder and awe as he runs a thumb over the slightly crooked border on Thor's card, and Steve wonders, for a moment, if a heart can shatter from happiness.
“Taken care of,” Tony waves him off, then turns to Pepper with a knowing grin. “See, Pep? What did I say? Schmoozing while I hold down the fort. Some team leader you are…”
“I know you do,” Tony replies softly.
Not to him.
“Yeah, I know.” Steve doesn’t stop smiling, even when Tony’s sure he wants to wince at the pain in his head.
In response, Tony’s body goes limp, and when Steve just crouches down to throw him over his shoulder as he walks towards the door, he can feel the smile settling happily on his face.
“Pepper said it was okay,” Tony whines, and looks up in time to see Steve’s curious gaze.
“You know I did,” Steve says. “Saturday brunch just wasn’t the same without my best fella.”
,” Steve gasps, almost tripping as he reaches the second floor. “Tony-- shit!”
“Then you should have no problem staying here while I go get our daughter ready for school.”
“I’m not the one on the mission, babe.”
“He’s losing it,” he hears someone chuckle, and-- oh, is he saying everything out loud?
His eyes burn again– god, it feels like that’s all they’ve done today– and before he can stop it, a low, broken sob feels like it’s torn out of him.
“We both know my son would never accept--”
“Okay, take it down a notch, you meatball,” he mutters.
Warnings: NONE.
Tony sees his younger self grin, all dimpled cheeks as he all but shoves a familiar blue action figure into the camera lens. “
“Steve...”
” Steve chuckles. “
This... this is something else. It’s almost too much, to see this obvious display of trust and affection, and something else that feels so much more intimate than she was aware of. It’s one thing to hear Tony talk about his friendship with Steve-- which he's gotten around to doing a lot more of, for months now-- but it’s another thing to see it. She wonders if this closeness is new, or if she’s been missing it all this time.
“I know you are,” Tony says softly, listening to Steve’s low, steady breathing over the phone. His hotel suite feels emptier than it had just minutes ago, even though he’s been the only in there, and he knows the reason for it is thousands of miles away. “I miss you.”
, JARVIS replies.
“Yes,
“Pease, Daddy?”
“Charmer,” she sighs, as she pulls away. “Why don’t you walk around and see if you actually like anything else?”
By now, Steve’s moved right beside Tony, shoulders brushing each other, and the smile on his face is pure, unadulterated charm. “No, better yet... Make it a hundred.”
"Huh?" Tony looks up to her, eyes gleaming with mirth.
Steve frowns. “Does what bother me?”
“Good. Pass me the tape.”
“Good,” Tony sighs, his relief almost pathetically evident in that one word. He takes the phone and adds his number in seconds, messaging himself to get Steve’s number. “Tomorrow sound good? I can get pizza.”
“It’s the meds,” Pepper smirks. “They gave him a full dose for the ride home.”
“Seven,” Steve grins. “Told ya, I was feeling lazy.”
“That’s all I want for you,” his mom says. “I love you so much, baby.”
“I’m not goin’ anywhere, Shellhead. I just… this can’t be comfortable for you.”
“You know why.”
A pale, pretty flush settles on Steve’s cheeks. “Thanks.”
“Can we help you?” Tony suddenly hears, and the new voice-- low and rough and wrong because it’s not
“I’m gonna barf,” Clint mutters, low enough that only Natasha can hear him. “Honestly, I dunno why I expected anything else.”
In hindsight, it’s pretty obvious why Steve does it.
“No one else I’m ever gonna wanna do this with.”
“I’m a genius, babydoll. I’m never wrong.”
someone calls out, just as Tony begins hearing sirens in the distance.
But mostly Cap.

“Back atcha, Shellhead.”
“I bribed them with this,” Tony waves a box of brightly colored cereal. “But
But he can’t think of that right now.
“I know.”
“I wanna know you too,” Tony says. Pepper and Sam snicker loudly, but Tony really couldn’t care less. He just wants to be alone with Steve again.
“I know you do.”
“Good thing both of us are shit at cooking.”
March Prompt #28: “Stop pushing me away.”
“Steve?”
“Nope, not you.
“They get really bright, and crinkly at the corners.”
Warnings: NONE.
“--and y’know, kind of irritatingly perfect--”
“I do,” Steve replies, soft enough that Pepper can barely hear him. “You know me pretty well…”
“Ex-boss.”
“Not yet,” Tony mutters, and Steve makes a sort of squeaking noise that should not be so attractive, really. Tony’s definitely not thinking straight.
“How’re you feeling, then?” Tony asks, trying to keep himself from staring at the baby blues before him. It’s a lost cause. “Any dizziness? Nausea? Anything?”
“Because Toasty doesn’t like sharing space with the other appliances, the greedy bastard.”
“I am,” Steve says, all earnest smiles and warm blue eyes, and Tony looks away to hide his burning cheeks.
“That so?”
“Drink your tea, sweetheart,” Steve offers the cup to his husband. “Don’t want it to get cold.”
Steve almost holds his breath. "
You have to answer for each other, though.
“Don’t you trust me?”
He wakes to the steady rise and fall of the warm chest beneath him.
“So… can we go eat now?”
Sequel to Chapter 15! :)
“Yeah, I’d just rather keep you alive,” Steve deadpans.
“Then why don’t you believe us?”
He makes a jab, one time, something about Steve and Jarvis needing some time alone, but Steve just rolls his eyes and brings the cat closer.
“I’m glad I don’t have to hold out for my hero anymore,” he whispers into Steve’s shoulder, and grins knowingly when it starts shaking.
“How does he even know this song?” Tony grumbles, but can’t keep the smile off his face at the sound of his friends’ happiness.
Whether or not it’s unwelcome is yet to be determined.
“Believe who?” Tony asks.
She also probably a robot, because she doesn’t even blink.
"Look at them,” he says, and then Pepper looks down at his picture of some of the notes, and... yep, there it is— he sees the moments she gets it.
“No, I need– I need sit rep, I need to talk to Nat, Clint– Barnes, they’ll know,” he rasps out, and manages to stay upright as he all but bolts out the room.
“How long might that be?” Steve asks, patting his friend’s back gently.
“You’re my best friend,” is all Steve says, like it’s the only answer that matters, and Tony thinks he could cry from the sheer amount of love he feels for this boy.
Warnings: NONE.
“I promise it won’t be that bad.”
“Don’t need to,” Tony replies. “It’s the truth. And honestly, I still don’t get why you get so worked up abou--”
“Hi,” Steve says, lips quirked up in the same bright grin Tony remembers from three days ago.
“Hey, what happened to ‘lucking out’?”
“Took me bein’ missing to get her there, huh?” Steve chuckles, before their lips can even meet. His eyes are red-rimmed and wet– not unlike Tony’s, to be honest– but he’s still the most gorgeous man Tony’s ever seen.
“It’s not you–”
"And heartbroken."
“Your boyfriend’s here,” Natasha tells Steve, just as he’s finished photographing a pair of toddlers grinning from their perch on Santa’s lap, and he almost gives himself whiplash as he whips his head in the direction of the thinning line a couple of feet away, breath hitching at the familiar head of tousled locks at the end of it.
The redhead on the screen rolls her eyes.
“Ass.”
“Tony--”
Stony Christmas prompt #24: "Merry Christmas."
Through the dim, murky swamp Tony feels like he’s under, that low, panicked voice is the only thing he can make sense of.
Steve laughs beside him. “I’ll call Coulson for some clothes.”
“We can call him Remy.”
“Love you too, Shellhead.”
Tony shoves the paper in his face. “I’ll tell you what the problem is,” he snaps. “Look at how many people you have coming from your side.”
“Love you too, baby,” Tony replies, and smiles.
“The correct answer, though, is ‘yes, dear’– not a good way to start out this marriage, babe. Hasn’t even been a day, and you’re already slacking off.”
“How ‘bout I pay you in kisses, baby?” Tony decides to purr, and then shivers when Steve’s eyes darken even as he blushes.
“Seriously, Pep--”
okay?”
“Hey, shush– you’ll wake her,” Steve says, both of them stifling their laughter behind their hands, and for the rest of the day, the world outside their bed falls away.
,” is all he says, and God damnit, if that soft, breathy sound doesn’t make Tony want to shiver all over.
“This is getting pathetic,” Bucky says, and Steve turns to him with a glare. “I’m tired of seein’ the both of you droolin’ over each other.”
He finds the first note later that night.
"What's the diagnosis?" Stark deflects, running his fingers over the bandage wrapped around Steve's middle.
“So,” the paramedic starts, all brisk and business, “first thing’s first. Mister Tony--”
“I like rainy days--”
“Thanks, bud. Okay, call it, Cap,” he turns to the blond beside him, who gives him a fond eye roll before addressing the children.
“Eat a couple and then you can nap, sweetie. You don’t want us to finish them all, don’t you?” He asks, chuckling when she shakes her head and opens her mouth expectantly. Tony drops the slice, and then he and Steve share a smile when she hums happily. “More, Daddy.”
“J, meet Steve. Steve, meet JARVIS–- my AI.”
It’s not often that words cut Tony to the core, because sometimes he thinks he might’ve been born with armor instead of skin. The ‘in one ear, out the other’ shtick is a reflex at this point, and he can’t remember a time when that wasn’t the case.
Tony looks down at their daughter--at the rise and fall of her tiny chest, the pale pink fists clenched at her side, the wisps of blond hair framing her precious face-- and shakes his head. "Never.”
“It’s rude to interrupt,” he says, and doesn’t bother hiding the way his eyes roam appreciatively over Steve’s body in his old Army uniform.
“You gotta wait for Rho–”
“Maybe I should leave then, since you’re bein’ mean,” Steve teases, grinning when Tony whines and locks his arms around Steve’s neck.
“And why not?”
“My friends wouldn’t let me name ‘em.”
“Good-- you weren’t being very subtle with those eyes. And watch that arm next time, big guy. Good luck,” Sharon waves, and then she’s gone.
Steve feels the warmth in his face spread further down his neck, and for the first time since he started working as a helper Elf at Santa’s Winter Wonderland, he thanks God for the ridiculous costume he’s wearing. “Hi, Tony.”
“We don’t…” Steve swallows. “We don’t have to, um, talk about it. If it makes you… uncomfortable–”
The days go by, one after the other, and Tony runs his side of the world-- SI business, SHIELD business, Avengers business, everything-- with a familiar ease that manages to keep the worry and longing to a bearable degree. He ends up eating dinner with the team more often than not, surprisingly, and falls into bed only when his body decides it’s not willing to pull through for him anymore.
Warnings: NONE.
“Doesn’t feel like enough,” Steve shakes his head. “Really, Tony. This is…” he looks around the room, and Tony follows his gaze, taking in the expertly decorated WWII Era decorations, the lighting and the smoky haze that’s transformed the entire floor into a time capsule to the 1940′s. “This is amazing.”
“Love you, too.”
“I have a sweet tooth too, y’know?”
“Tony–”
“Tony?”
Rhodey practically runs all the way to Tony’s workshop when he sees it.
“I just...” Steve finally looks up, nose brushing Tony’s jaw with every breath he takes. “It’s been a while since we’ve been able to relax like this.”
“I know you could have it,” Steve continues. “You deserve all of it.”
“Coffee?”
“Always.”
“Sippy cups, Rogers?”
“Because there’s
“Even with the cold?”
“D-deal.”
“Thinking twice about that now.”
“You’d be surprised how hard those things can hit. Especially when some of the bigger guys like you are throwing them.”
“Oh, I’m definitely not complaining,” Tony shakes his head. “I just really fucking love it when you go all Brooklyn on us.”
Tony feels relief rush through him. "You’re okay?"
Tony blinks the sleep away, and turns into his pillow to face Steve. “Okay, I need coffee right the fuck now,” he grumbles, “because I swear I just heard you say my eyes are like the stars.”
“You cheated!”
“...Can I get another tissue, please?”
“So, I’ve been nothing but a failure this whole month.”
“I’m gonna sue those fuckers,” he sighs.
vAll Tony can do is nod, and then Steve’s lips are on his and--
It’s easier than he’d expected it to be, keeping the secret from Tony.
And she’s still staring.
When he finally shuffles back into the room– for all that he’s made his life beside Steve Rogers, for the past week, and for the last few years, he wills himself to stay outside and let the rest of the team have their moments; God knows they’ve earned it– there is no silence.
But Steve...
“Hmm?”
“Yeah, yes, I would. If I can. May I?” Steve feels like an idiot.
“Dun feel lucky, Papa,” Bella pouts, looking mournfully at him.
“It’s war.”
” Steve says again, squirming around Tony’s hold even though he hasn’t stopped smiling.
“Our suits are wrinkled.”
“No, because you won’t, and you know it. You’ll end up distracted by your tech, or your suit, or Steve, and then I’ll come around to pick the papers up and you won’t even remember where they are.”
"I sure hope our daughter doesn’t get her manners from you,” Steve mutters, pushing the door to their bedroom open and dropping the carrier by the bed.
“We should probably go,” he sighs in defeat, and starts shepherding everyone out the way Tony came. Rhodey and Sam and Thor pat his shoulder as they pass him, and Pepper kisses his cheek. Bucky gives both of them a smile and a thumbs up before leaving, and then they’re alone.
“Like hell--”
“Yep. I made it last night. She’s got half a million followers already.”
“Yeah, you are, but you’ll be okay. Stay with me--”
“You don’t-- you don’t like it?” Steve asks, voice growing soft as his face starts to fall, and
Tony nuzzles into the blond’s arm in lieu of an answer, and feels his smile grow when he feels Steve’s hand find his.
Steve nods. “Head was achin’ something fierce that first night, though.”
“I’ll hold you to that, Mister Stark,” Steve says, and as Tony picks up his first forkful of Spaghetti, he feels better than he has all day.
“It killed me to see you with him.”
“One day... after high school, I--” Tony breathes, “we’ll take a year and get the fuck outta here. Just you and me. We’ll-- we’ll go see the world?” He doesn’t realize he’s crying again until Steve lifts a hand to wipe at his cheeks, and he tastes the salt on his lips. “We’ll go to... to Brazil and China, and the Louvre... We’ll send your mom postcards, and-- and Bucky and Rhodey and Nat and everyone else. Yeah?”
?” Tony looks away. “That you’d wanna marry someone like m--”
lucking out.”
“‘m serious,” he says, turning until he faces the brunet. “I could stare at you all day.”
Warnings: NONE.
Tony knows Steve can feel his giddy smile, but doesn’t even think about pulling away. “Always.”
“Are you happy?”
Steve leans against the door of his daughter’s room. “I think it’s exactly what it looks like.”
“I lost my phone--”
“Charmer.”
idea--”
“You won’t be laughin’ when I catch you,” Steve promises, but Tony just lifts an eyebrow.
“Like hell we will,” Steve says, eyes gleaming in determination. “I’m not waitin’ longer than I have to.”
The next moment, he pushes his tablet away, kneels on the bed, and then practically jumps onto Steve's lap. He takes his hands-- and god, how are they not shaking when Tony's very being feels like it's about to explode?-- and cups his boyfriend's cheeks. Steve's breath hitches at the touch, and Tony just leans in even though he can barely feel the breath in his own lungs. "I said, I want to marry you," he whispers, lips just barely brushing Steve's.
“Oh pipe down,” Steve chuckles, pulling him closer into the warmth of his chest as he rests his head on Tony’s shoulder. “We’ll go back in a bit. I’ll even make some more hot chocolate to make it up to ya.”
“Dude, I’m pretty sure they’re about to start sucking face–”
“Sleep,” he says, “and tomorrow, my Ma will make us some pancakes and I’ll show you my new comic ideas.” His voice is the softest thing Tony’s ever felt, and the cushions under his cheek smell like apples, cinnamon and Steve.
Steve looks over his shoulder at the sound of James Rhodes’ voice, soft and tired in a way that he’s never sounded in all the times Steve’s met him.
“I not a pum’kin,” she giggles, unruly curls tickling Tony’s chin. “‘m a pwincess.”
“I can’t imagine it ever could,” he whispers back, and his own voice sounds rough and wrecked. He wonders if that’s how he looks, with his dirty hair and even dirtier uniform that he hasn’t changed out of since they’d first rushed Tony in.
“You’re drivin’ me, right?”
“I don’t know,” Steve replies, pulling him away from the others. “I can’t decide if this is a really... creative way of hitting on me, or if you really believe what you’re saying.”
Summer of Stony prompt #10: “Hey, I’m with you, okay? Always.”
Pepper smiles. “Because most of the time, you still act like one. Besides, isn’t he cute?”
,” is the muffled reply.
He doesn’t go back up until dinner, and by then, he’s so hungry he practically inhales a slice of leftover pizza. It’s not until he registers the unusual silence, that he remembers what he’d set out to do earlier.
“Oh my god,” Steve laughs, “stop ruining the moment and answer the question, doofus.”
,” he says, closing his eyes when a fresh wave of tears threaten to fall.
“But... guys, Tony’s not—“ he pauses and takes a breath, any explanation dying in his throat against the excited gleam in everyone’s eyes. “Why do you guys want to do that, hm?”
, the Captain breathes out.
“Nothin’,” Steve says, as soft as the gleam in his eyes, and with his hair ruffled and tousled from sleep, he looks younger than Tony’s ever seen. “Just wanted to spend time with ya.”
“And you know you can tell me anything?” Steve continues. “Yeah.”
“What about the rest?”
“I’m asking you, Mrs. Rogers--”
Steve hands it over after a moment of hesitation, and Tony’s heart skips a beat when he finally sees the screen. He recognizes the fond gleam in his own eyes, still faintly blurry from sleep, and his hair is a mass of tousled waves from the wind around them.
“What?” he has to ask again, and the word comes out low and quiet.
“I like what I’m looking at right now better.”
Steve shakes his head. “Never crossed my mind.”
“No other annoying geniuses around here.”
Steve feels like a veritable giant as he takes a mini muffin, holding it easily with his thumb and forefinger. “Blueberry, my favorite.”
“It’s the fabric softener Ma uses-- ’s called ‘spring meadows’.”
And speaking of Mr. Rogers, what’s his favorite?
“You didn’t plan this, did you?”
“Steve...”
“Steve--”
“Shhh. I’m tryin’ to watch the movie.”
“Of course,” Steve nudges his shoulder again. “Here you go.”
“Daddy, I not funny.”
“Sam!”
And those arms. And that khaki-clad ass.
That’s… comforting to know.
“Okay, yeah,” Tony takes the container and nods, cheeks hurting from how hard he’s grinning now. “Thanks.”
“Holy shit, Stark,” Barton mumbles. “Your mom was a
“Oh god, that was so bad,” Tony says, breathless from laughter and the deliciously wicked gleam in those baby blues above him. “Jesus, that’s– seriously, babe, don’t ever say that again.”
Bucky narrows his eyes thoughtfully, and then he nods decisively. “Okay,” is all he says.
Steve doesn’t startle at the smooth, playful voice of his patient, but when he looks up from the chart in his hand, he almost stumbles from the big brown eyes aimed his way. “Mr. Stark,” he says, clearing his throat to regain his composure. “How are you feeling?”
After that, Steve figures it wouldn’t hurt too much to take Bucky to school himself more often.
“I could buy
Tony resists the urge to chuckle again, choosing instead to give Steve an encouraging smile. “Give it to me, peaches.”
,” Tony mutters, taking in the loud, uncontrollable laughter that has Steve doubled over, the wide blue of Barnes’ eyes as he nods frantically, and the low, incoherent mumbles leaving Rhodey’s lips. “Steve--”
“Then maybe I can prove the old man wrong.”
“But then you came along— you, the Avengers, everyone else— and just like that, I wasn’t... wasn’t alone. And now, I get to come home to
Summer of Stony prompt #21: “You’re the only one I trust to do this.”
?” is the strangled reply.
“Don’t you dare,” Tony says. “I mean it, you little-- okay, never mind. Do it,” he waves the dog off. “See if I care. I’ll just pay the groomers extra. Again.”
"Stuff it, Rogers. You know everyone's loved you forever."
“And where’s your friend?” Steve asks Tony.
“We’ll see,” Clint waggles his eyebrows, laughing when Tony just turns to start his coffee.
“Wasn’t gonna miss that for anythin’.”
have feelings, right?”
“Tony. Stark.”
“Both of you, of co–”
“Guess not. In any case, I’m glad you’re doing this with me.”
“Why the hell are you calling him ‘sir’? And I haven’t even said yes,” Tony points out, already a little breathless at the quirk of Steve’s lips.
“Don’t touch me.”
“Ohhhh,” Tony groans, moving off Steve’s chest to stretch his limbs languidly. “Now that you mention it, that sounds fucking perfect.”
“What?” he breathes again.
“You can bet on that, Stark. The second that hour’s up...”
“Zip it and scram, before I change my mind and hide dessert!”
“Starving. But first...” Tony leans in and captures Steve’s lips in a kiss-- slow and deep like he’s been aching to ever since he left for SI in the morning-- sighing happily as Steve returns it with soft, tender swipes of his own. “I love you,” he whispers, after they both pull away for air.
“Howard told me I’d make a shitty dad once– I told him it takes one to know one. Sometimes I think he’s right.”
“Well, I sure wouldn’t be opposed to ‘em. But mostly, I just really wanna know why you’re doing this.”
, ‘cause we’ve got better things to do with our mouths.”
Steve rolls his eyes fondly. “Sweetheart…”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #24: “Stop acting like a child.”
,” Steve almost yells, relishing in the way his voice cuts sharply through the conversation.
Tony all but throws himself on him, waving a large sheet of paper in his face as he slumps into the couch with a groan.
“Just sit there and look pretty, Cap,” says the other firefighter, a dark-skinned man with one of the friendliest smiles Tony’s ever seen. “Let the good doc take care of ya.”
“I said,” Shaggy stands up, “can. We. Help. You?”
“Yeah?” the blond says, and shit, is Tony still saying everything out loud? “Y’still are. Goddamn it, where’s the ambulance--
“It’s so unfair that you can just…” he grumbles, waving his hand around vaguely, “do that.”
Bucky and Pepper are as adorable in their costumes as they are any other day, and watching them charm the pants off every house they go to makes Steve happier than he’s been in a long time.
- - - - -
“Alright,” Tony squares his shoulders, “time to step up to the plate. Comin’, Cap?”
“How generous of me.”
Steve steps back into Tony’s space. “I love everything about this right now, but… it wouldn’t be half as grand without you.”
“It’s too goddamn early for you two to be smiling like that,” Tony mutters. “I have a goddamn heart problem.”
“Lennon, McCartney and Harrison?”
“Hmmm?”
Steve just hides his smile behind another mouthful.
“Steve. Honey bunch.
Tony scoffs, and bumps Steve back. “You are too fucking comfortable with my money, big guy.”
, it’s New Year’s Eve! Can’t you two keep it in your pants for more than an hour?” Clint groans. “I can’t even enjoy my eggnog anymore...”
Tony lurches out of his seat with a silent gasp, almost tripping over his teammates’ feet as he staggers towards the hallway leading to the elevators. Through the rush of blood in his ears, he hears someone call his name, but it just serves to spur him faster.
Because he still has the taste of coffee and salt in his mouth, and it’s almost bad enough to gag.
“You guys sure about this?” Sam asks, right as they reach the entrance to the cafeteria. It’s loud and full, but Steve and Rhodey just nod. “Oh, who am I kidding? Barnes, get ready to hold one of ‘em back–”
Pepperoni’s so much better these days.
“‘Cause it’ll kill ya. The guilt, the ‘what-ifs’…. they’ll break you, man.”
“Ah, no no no, stop! I don’t know what you’re talking about– Queens? Who’s Queens, huh? What’s– what’s that?” he rambles in between quiet laughter, and doesn’t quite manage to hold back the shiver at the feel of Steve’s own chuckles on his neck, at the vibrations along his spine.
“Love you too, baby.”
“Yeah?”
“Oooooh,” Tony purrs, kissing Steve’s neck as he rocks his hips into the body beneath his. “Feeling kinky too, are we?”
“Still, I kind of... I dunno, Cap, you’re usually a lot more--”
“...Really?” Tony furrows his brow even as his eyes stay closed.
“Yeah? Well next time, find a better hiding place than our sock drawer!”
Steve closes his eyes, and breathes through the emotions running through him.
” Maria says softly, hand reaching out to tousle her son’s hair. “
“Okay, so…” Rhodey steps up beside him. “I think I’m going to, uh, look for stuff?”
“Yes, Tony?”
“What’s wrong with it?” Steve asks, but he’s smiling, and Tony just turns around to pat his cheek.
“I don’t care where the bed ends up. As long as you’re in it with me,” Tony says simply, shrugging his shoulders even as he feels his lips quirk up into a soft smile.
“She will,” Steve says softly, bumping his shoulders against Tony’s. “She gave me an earful when I told her what happened, but she’s itchin’ to meet ya now.”
“‘Kay, Daddy,” she nods, and marches back across the room with a twirl of her blue Princess dress skirts. “Cat, d’wanna play wif my dolls?”
“‘m cold.”
“No, we’re not getting pizza again later,” Steve shakes his head. “Their stomachs’ll never let ‘em sleep.”
Tony looks up until he meets Steve’s bright blue gaze, and starts to pull away. “Uh, sorry–”
Ambulance?
“Uh huh.”
“It was his idea,” Tony jerks his thumb at Steve even as he pouts at being told what to do.
“Any pancakes left?” he finally decides to ask, hopping up onto the last stool when the team nods, and seconds later, Steve slide a plate piled high in front of him. “Thank you,” Tony says softly, looking up at the blond over the rim of his frames.
Steve’s hand is comfortingly warm on the small of his back, and like he’s done countless times before, Tony revels in it. “You’re never gonna let that go, are ya?”
But Steve just pulls him closer as they walk further into the night, and the warmth in Tony’s chest stays with him even longer.
"But you hijacked the AV room anyway?"
“I’m not--”
“It wasn’t the best idea to kidnap me, then,” Tony says. “Doesn’t do all that much for a good first impression.”
Tony pouts at him. “Killjoy,” he grumbles, but thankfully says no more.
“Steve–”
Bucky shrugs. “Fancy suit, shiny shoes? Looks like a Scotch guy. Lemme just go take a piss before you do anything, though.”
“What–”
“Yes, sir!”
“Back atcha, Winghead,” is all Tony can say. He closes his eyes, breathes in the clean, surprisingly woodsy scent of Steve’s uniform, and then moves away. “Now chop chop. I’ve got a company to run and you’re just taking up all my time-- really, Rogers, you’re a menace.”
”–just as a dark wave’d swallowed the two of them beneath concrete and metal.
– you can’t sweet talk your way outta this one, Rogers.”
- - - - -
“It’s a miracle you ever get anyone to follow you anywhere.”
“You didn’t hear me come in, did you?”
“You better not be getting cold feet about this,” he teases, but Steve’s shaking his head before Tony’s even finished speaking.
“Good point,
“That’s... you’re good at it,” Steve finally says, amusement clear in his voice even as his cheeks flush the prettiest shade of pink. “I’m usually okay with my Math, but lately, it’s um.... it’s getting a little-- well, not a little, it’s a lot more confusing. Today sure helped, though.”
And when he thinks about the box still stashed under his bed, his smile gets just a little bit wider.
“Shellhead--”
March Prompt #27: “We can fix this.”
“Later,” Tony promises. “Should probably let him get used to you first.”
“Hell if I know,” Tony scoffs, and then he grins playfully. “If I weren’t such a cynic, though, I’d say it’s destiny.”
Steve presses a kiss to his hair, his reply warm against Tony’s temple. “Never been happier.”
"-- that apparently you’re pretty sweet on this guy, and his voice--"
“I could hear you whinin’ from out there, y’know,” Steve says.
Steve shakes his head, face half buried into his pillow. “No. ’m just cold.”
“Don’t bother. Buck’s smug enough as it is.”
“I don’t give a shit,” Steve grins, and the others chuckle in approval. “I would do a hell of a lot more than curse for you, Tony Stark. You’re worth it.”
He can almost
“I’m used to it,”
He settles for sitting at the edge of the bed and straightening the blankets around Steve’s body tersely. “Barton’s nose and arm are broken when he stopped Barnes from going after you, because God fucking forbid we lose him out there too--”
“None of us did. But we’re doin’ alright,” Steve replies, bumping Tony’s shoulder with his own.
Do people count?
“How does tomorrow night sound, then?” Steve asks, and now he’s smiling too because he still feels a little ridiculous for being so maudlin and jealous, but now it’s just Steve and Tony and
Summer of Stony prompt #30: “Stay the night?”
Pepper sees Tony take in a shaky breath, and then another, before he speaks up again. “You’re somethin’ else, Rogers.”
“Fine, but only because I know you can actually do that. You’re fucking unreal.”
“I wan’ dis one!” Clint screeches, pointing to a fir easily twice Steve’s height.
” Bella whines, making grabby hands at her father.
Then another.
“Please,” he says, voice breaking despite his resolve to not fall apart. “I need…”
“Stark. Tony Stark.”
“We’ll live.”
“Sh–shit,” Tony pants. “Oh god, that’s…” His words get lost as he doubles over in laughter again, and Steve can’t even find it in himself to be bothered by it. “You’re gonna make the best fucking Elf that mall’s ever seen.”
Steve shakes his head, smiling as he gestures Tony further inside. “He wouldn't do that, would you, Jay?” He turns to the cat, who meows sweetly. “No, he's a good boy.”
The sound of it still makes Tony dizzy with disbelief, so he ends up just fiddling with his hands. For all that today’s been one of the best he’s ever had-- it’s certainly not his first time at Coney, but somehow, all the games and the food and the sheer atmosphere of the place have felt indescribably different-- he’s suddenly more nervous than he can ever remember being.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony nods, and tries not to swoon when the blond steps right into his personal space to settle the puppy into his arms. Annie barks at Steve once, and then turns to Tony and licks his chin. “Hey there, princess.”
“I kind of like you too, big guy.”

everyday, and God, how did Tony miss it? “But don’t ask me more, ‘cause I’m not fucking with the space time continuum for shit.”
“I missed you too, y’know,” he rasps, looking back up to meet those blue, blue eyes, and when Steve pulls him into his arms, Tony feels happier than he has in days.
“Fine, then,” he says. “They’re all from me–”
“I hate you.”
Tony looks at him now, and the only thing he can think is--
It’s a classic.
“But it’s Christmas!”
Civil Union Fest Prompt #29: “I got you a present.”
“Yeah?” Steve asks, more than a little breathless.
"Well, these three,” Steve points to the green, red, and blue collared ones. “These are John, Paul, and George.”
“You are absolutely crazy.”
Tony freezes and then reaches up to feel them. “Thanks, baby doll,” he teases, smiling sweetly at Steve, who rolls his eyes even as he blushes, and ignores everyone else’s knowing glances. Pepper finally finds his phone in the kitchen, so Tony fist bumps Rhodey and Thor, waves at Sam and Bucky and Bruce and Clint, sends Natasha a playful wink and then–
“You awake?”
Tony just nods, and fiddles with the collar of Steve’s white tee.
- - - - -
Now, two hours and one rant-filled debrief later, Steve hasn’t said anything since the doctor last came in the room, and Bucky would probably be a little more worried about him, but the doctor had assured them that the serum was already doing it’s work. He’s just glad for the silence that lets him think clearly again.
"I like history,” Steve says bashfully. “And they seemed to warm up to the names pretty quick.”
“I know.”
“Liver’s yuck!”
Still, as much as he’d like to keep staring, the music is starting to get annoying. It’s not the first time Mr. Rogers has played songs for his students, but Tony can only take so many Nocturnes and Opuses, so he walks to his desk— he’s past ignoring his class, they could probably use a break; it’s not his grade, anyway— and grabs his little stack of bright, gold sticky notes.
“Won’t stop being true even if I do.”
“...You, i guess.”
Tony takes a deep breath. “What.”
“Where’d ev’ryone go?” Tony mumbles.
Tony rolls his eyes, and walks further into the room until he plops onto the bed beside Steve. “I, uh, tried to call you,” he says softly. His eyelashes brush his cheeks as he looks down at his hands, and all Steve wants to do is lean in and press his lips against them. “Left you a shit load of messages, but you, um, you weren’t answering, so–”
“Yes sir,” Steve grins, and waves over his shoulder as he leaves the kitchen.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony rolls his eyes, but leans up to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek on his way out the kitchen. “Interview’s tomorrow, eleven am sharp. Dress nice, handsome.”
“I know,” Tony replies proudly, and feels something in his chest grow warm when the blond’s smile softens as he looks at them both.
and--
“Steve,” Tony says, voice echoing loud and sharp around them. “Steve, open your eyes. Look at me, Rogers.”
Steve just groans again, and keeps trying to rip their clothes from their bodies. “Get them off.”
The woman at the table takes one look at her, scoffs, and then– “
"I also like having a functioning heart, which might skip itself all the way to the grave if you keep it up."
-- you know me.”
“I’d like to see you try,” Steve hums, waving at the other blond as he disappears into the book stacks around them.
“I sure as hell don’t feel lucky right now.”
His mother smiles. “No, I don’t know,” she chuckles, “but it’s alright, in any case. As long as you’re here, I’m right as rain.”
“Sir, yes sir,” Tony gives him a lazy salute, but doesn’t miss the blond’s trembling jaw. “Steve–”
In the span of about six weeks, he goes from 5′4 to 6′2; Tony almost faints when he sees him the first time after he comes back from his family vacation. And this time, that little pang of attraction he's always tried so hard to ignore around Steve-- who's always been cute as hell, ever since Tony's known him, with those eyes and that smile and that sass-- suddenly becomes impossible to.
"Not the food, hon. This.." Tony waves his hand generally. "Whatever the fuck you call the day after Christmas--"
again-- and he looks so small, despite being taller than everyone in the room, that Tony can’t stop himself from reaching out to touch his arm.
Warnings: NONE.
"We need to talk."
“Nobody likes it when you guys fight,” Sam says softly. “And Steve’s always been easier to rile up when it comes to you.”
“Too much macaroni," Steve points out, and grins when Tony lets out a soft, shaky laugh.
“Tony–”
And then he waits until the fourth-- Steve’s birthday-- to tell him.
“’M not silly– ‘m a genius.”
A bed holding the only person he wants to see.
“Your driver was not hurt. We just had to knock him out to get to you. He’s probably awake by now.”
“I know,” Tony says, and the words taste like ash as they leave his mouth. “Time to put your game face on,” he turns to everyone else, and then jumps out the Quinjet.
“Oh my god, I love you,” Tony breathes, and leans over the table to press their lips together.
“Wuv you too, Papa,” their daughter echoes around a mouthful of her sugar cookie, and Steve’s smile-- all dimpled cheeks and clear, azure eyes-- sends Tony’s heart fluttering like the very first time.
for the lovely concussion.”
The tower feels empty in a way he immediately hates, even though his brain reminds him it’s anything but-- Sam, Wanda, Bruce, and Rhodey are still around, and he knows he’ll see them all at some point of the day. He fires off a quick pizza order to JARVIS-- not his usual, because he only eats that with Steve-- as he reaches his workshop, and it doesn’t take long for him to get lost in the numbers, the calculations and the equations, which is probably why he almost misses the bright blue sticky note clinging to DUM-E.
“Steeb?”
Clears his throat.
“Yeah, that’s my baby,” Tony sighs. “He’s a fucking handful. If you’re not careful, he’ll end up down here again, so keep the windows shut.”
You’re a dork…
“And no matter what your father says-- no, listen,” she continues, when every part of his body screams at him to bolt. “You have
Steve leans in to kiss Tony’s cheek, and then their daughter’s. “Back atcha, sweetheart.”
“‘Cause I’ll do it myself if he hasn’t.”
Steve reaches out to grab his arm. His skin is cold. “Tony.“
“I did! Look--” Steve says happily, pulling out a tiny plastic cup from the cup holder. “Jell-o!”
"Okay, we’re gonna have to sit down and actually talk about about this, obviously. But not right now,” Tony says, pressing his lips against Steve’s jaw once, then twice... “Definitely not right now.”
“Really?” Tony says, but his voice is so breathless, it’s almost pathetic.
Until one day, when he’s in the middle of enjoying a night in to draw-– at the end of the day, no matter what, Steve can always unwind with his sketchbook and pencils-– and Tony’s voice comes in through the walls, loud and clear and so excited that Steve is helpless to stop his lips from curling up.
"Like?"
“You punched the waiter,” Nat smirks.
"We had to!" Rhodey yells, only to groan and hang his head a second later. "Shit..."
“Yeah, I’m, uh, I’m sorry about that,” the Captain admits. “We just… we couldn’t find a better way to contact you in person without putting both of us in any more danger.”
“You good, Dad?”
“Look,” she says, “the Board is starting to ask questions, Tony. I’m not telling you to stop-- though that wouldn’t be a bad idea, either--”
Steve looks up at him from beneath those gorgeous eyelashes. “I really do appreciate it,” he says shyly.
Steve carefully turns him over until they’re face to face, their intertwined hands cradled between them. “I wanted you to have a nice time.”
“Then you better find someone else to bunk with tonight,” Tony says, slowly so that they understand every word. “Because Steve’s a screamer.”
, Tony feels like screaming, at Barnes and Natasha, at the doctors, and even Pepper.
“I like the one I’m lookin’ at right now better.” From where Bucky’s sitting, he can see Stark leering as he says it.
“Sorry for, uh, springing this on you,” he finally says, voice rough and raspy, “I don’t even know why I even did that without thinking, it was weird– well, not weird for me, since I was the one to just fucking plant it on you, but, y’know, I’d totally get it if it made you uncomfortable, again, sorry–”
think so.”
“Daddy, I like duh park.”
“Obviously,” Tony says, and piles two heaps onto his plate.
Steve rolls his eyes as he settles into the pillows against the headboard. “You’re ridiculous.”
“God,” Tony sighs, “if I’d known you were gonna be such a sap when we started all this–”
“Really, I’m not surprised you guys have nothing b-better to do,” he snarks, breath hitching when one of Rumlow’s goons pushes him hard against the locker, his back hitting the sharp end of the handle. The hallways are empty except for him and a handful of guys. And Brock, of course.
,” Tony whines, and with a sigh, Steve turns around until they’re face to face, taking in the gleam in Tony’s eyes from the moonlight streaming in from his window. “Hi, there.”
“Jesus Christ, they should
Tony looks down. “Yeah...”
“You leave Brock to me,” he says firmly, and then feels the corner of his mouth quirk up just a little bit when Clint lets out a loud whoop.
“That the only reason why?”
Steve shakes his head. “Adams, Revere and Washington.”
“Here, just stop talking and eat this,” Rhodey grins, sliding a wrapped sandwich at him, and Tony’s just about to reply, except the smell wafts up to him and–
“’M not attached,” Tony assures her. And Steve, hopefully. “Pep’s just m’friend.”
“You’re so crass.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it. You’re tied at the hip, the two of ya.”
Warnings: NONE.
-----------------------
“Yeah!” Their daughter says happily, squirming in Tony’s arms. “Daddy, down! Cat!”
“Doesn’t seem like you mind much,” Steve says, after a particularly delicious swipe of his tongue.
“Pie from Marcello’s when your shift’s over?” Tony looks up at him through his eyelashes, and Steve doesn’t even pretend he’s going to put up a fight.
“Zip it, Bucky!” Steve yells.
“Playing dirty now?” He asks through a shiver.
“Fight me.”
” Maria’s voice cuts in before anyone can say anything else, and then moves the camera to capture both of them as she kisses little Tony’s head when he nods. “
drunk?
Finally, though, they reach the gates, and that’s when Steve spots a little girl-- her bright, red hair styled in two neat plaits over her shoulders-- standing next to an old, suit-clad man, holding his hand as she looks around. He knows who she is almost instantly, and even if he hadn’t, Bucky’s excited little
“Uh huh. Early.”
Sitting primly on Steve’s balcony once more, smug as the day Pepper brought him into his home. Little brat.
“We’re not kids, y’know.”
Tony laughs. "Shut up, you dork,” he rolls his eyes, and Steve returns his grin with one of his own.
“All the pet names, Tony.”
I’m right, though, ain’t I?
“Now that we’re all friends, though, Cap, I’ve gotta tell you... I’m afraid a simple handshake won’t be enough to really close this thing up,” Tony smirks. Behind the Captain, Bucky’s grin returns full force, and when he bumps shoulders with Red, she only rolls her eyes.
Mr. New Yorker here? He’s all for a good pie, no surprise.
“Don’t apologize, ya moron,” Bucky groans, and Sam doubles over in laughter, his cackles no doubt echoing in every room throughout the school.
Steve’s eyes find his at the action, grin is boyish and bright and everything he deserves to be. “I love you.”
Steve lets out a low chuckle as he leans down to sweep Rhodey into his arms. “Wouldn’t you rather go lie down next to Sam and Bucky?”
Bucky nods. “You’re Tony Stark.”
“I can’t imagine what that must’ve been like,” Steve says softly, “but I hope you never forget just how much good you did that day. More than I think you realize.”
Yeah, they’re okay.
"...You ready?"
“If you say so.”
“Yeah, well,” he shrugs, reigning in his laughter in the face of his husband’s ridiculously adorable excitement. “I figured it’d only be a matter of time before you’d go ahead and get one– and honey, I love you, but I can’t even imagine the kind of thing you’d bring in here.”
“I love you too,” Tony hides his suddenly burning eyes in tousled blond curls, and when he feels Steve lean in to kiss his hair, his next breath comes easier than it ever has.
Tony nuzzles into Steve’s shoulder, and doesn’t even hesitate. “You bet I am.”
Steve eyes sparkle like the sun. “Good morning, beloved,” he replies, and leans in once more.
Until Tony turns, and catches Steve looking at
“You’re so whipped,” Bucky sniggers.
DUM-E and Butterfingers and You beep in approval from their stations–- of course it’s approval, what else would it be? Tony’s a fucking
“Okay, so that’s, what, the first one in two days?”
“About what?” Tony asks, and he has no idea why he’s suddenly holding his breath.
“I remember,” she tells him. “I was thinking I’d drop by at around seven. Unless...”
“Shit! Sorry, I’m–
“It’s just snow,” he says, and if it comes out a little breathlessly, it’s just because of the cold.
“Like that, you would,” Tony teases, and then Steve whispers something she can’t make out, but Tony lets out a laugh that lasts and lasts, until it fades into a quiet hum as the living room dims. Clint’s loud and off-key rendition of the theme gets jeers from Bucky and Rhodey as they throw popcorn his way, and Natasha can see how Thor’s booming laughter makes Bruce smile into his tea.
Tony staggers back like he’s been hit. “
“…Are
“Steve,” he says again.
“Maybe you should shut me up, then.”
“That sounds uncomfortable.”
“You’re a dork.”
“I already have that,” Steve says, and then both of them try to pretend they don’t see the other blushing.
“How ‘bout I kiss ‘em and make ‘em better?” Steve asks him, and in lieu of nodding, Tony reaches up and does it for him-- it’s slow and deep and everything this moment feels like-- and feels a thrill of happiness when Steve reciprocates almost immediately, those thick, familiar arms wrapped snugly around his waist.
“I’m not leaving,” Stark says casually, like he almost wasn’t falling apart a couple of minutes ago. “He’s not leaving,” he points to Bucky, “so just close those baby blues, and go the fuck to sleep.”
!” Tony breathes, and he’s so completely done fighting everything. “I’ve been
"You do," Steve whispers, and then lifts his head from Tony's neck so their eyes meet again. "Always will."
“You make me–” Tony swallows, but doesn’t look away. “I’m not half as good at anything, as I am when I’m doing it next to you. You make me better, baby. So as long as you’re in this with me–”
“Thank you, baby,” he coos, kissing the beanie atop her head.
“Yes, honey?” Steve’s smile is curious and indulgent and mischievous all at once.
“That didn’t answer my question, y’know.”
“With gwapes?”
"Okay," Steve says, when they pull away, "I love you, but you need to rinse your mouth."
“Pepper, Tony. Say good morning,” Steve repeats. His voice is so soft, he’s almost whispering the words into Tony’s hair, and when Tony just rubs his cheek against Steve’s shirt, Pepper has no idea why she suddenly feels like she’s intruding.
His daughter is no longer wearing a beanie, and her blond, downy head shines like gold in the dim light around them. Her gurgles are low but happy, and when her wide eyes meet his, they widen in recognition as she squeals in joy.
Steve just sighs.
“Tryin’ to make me feel better?”
“Yeah, okay that’s it. No take backs,” Rhodeys says; Tony doesn’t need to look at him to know he’s grinning.
,” Steve gasps, the sound of his low, rumbled laughter echoing through the room. “
in charge of Christmas dinner.”

“Honey, if you think I ever need a reason to be naked in your bed, we’re clearly doing something wrong.”
“Yeah, well I prefer my company with two less legs and abs I can lick, if you know what I mean.”
“Remind me why I’m doing this, again?”
“That’s seven months from now.”
] His? It’s… is it a tie?
“Um, hi there,” she says, her words slow and uncertain at the new, decidedly
“My lawyers are three minutes away,” he says, only to see the chief shake his head.
“Just a little red,” Tony replies, more than a little breathless. “But I know how you can make it up to me.”
“How’s the paperwork?” Tony asks, and when Clint walks into his line of sight, the genius only nods at him before keeping up the steady taps on his tablet.
“I love you.”
“What did I ever do to deserve you?” Tony mutters fondly, torn between laughing and squealing pathetically into his hands. “I honestly don’t know if I should be flattered that you took a laser tag shot for me, or terrified that it’s something you’d ever do, at all.”
Tony takes in a second to revel in the utter happiness on Steve’s face, before dropping his head onto a warm, firm, cashmere-covered shoulder. “Thank you.”
"Is that jealousy I hear?”
“I love you, sweetheart, so much.”
Tony just nods, but the memory of Steve’s lips is enough to keep him warm all night.
Steve, chest pressed up against Tony's back, just tucks his chin on the juncture of Tony's neck and shoulder. "Hey, it wasn't that bad, was if?"
Tony freezes.
“Kick,” is the whispered response, as Nat fiddles with the zipper sitting on his neck.
“More than birds, huh? He clearly means business.”
“At this point, I’d sleep with a fucking cactus next to me.”
Steve nods.
was slacking off on Daddy duty,” Tony says pointedly, chest bursting with warmth when Steve leans down to pepper their daughter’s face with kisses. “Wanna maybe not leave me hanging like that again?”
Tony just kisses him, soft and slow, until both of them are left breathless and gasping.
“Tony,” Natasha says calmly. How can she be so calm, when Steve’s– “You need to let them take him.”
“Somethin’ tells me that’s easier said than done,” he chuckles bashfully.
And even though Steve’s tuxedo is as perfectly immaculate as it always is– the man wears anything as well as it can ever be worn, Jesus– his jacket is unbuttoned, as are the top two buttons of his white shirt, and Tony can see the long lines of Steve’s neck and the dark tie hanging under his collar. His bright blue eyes are now dark and steely, the heat inside obvious as he steps up into Tony’s space. He looks well on his way to being thoroughly debauched, and Tony’s suddenly glad no one else will be seeing him like this for the rest of the night.
“You’re ridiculous!”
“Where’s duh pizza?” Clint asks, as soon as they corral their charges off the elevator and into the Stark Tower living room. “We wan’ pizza!”
“No, I didn’t– y'know, you keep apologizing, and I’m gonna start thinking you really mean it.”
“Then how ‘bout because I love you?”
What’s Mr. Stark’s?
,” he mumbles, looking back up again.
“Gonna give me your helmet, then?” he finally says, sauntering up to the bike with more aplomb than he feels.
“You’re…”
, damn it. Please?”
Rhodey throws him a knowing look as he laughs. “Can’t bullshit me, buddy.”
“Y’sure can’t beat the view from here,” Steve says, and Tony’s heart gives a happy lurch when he looks up and realizes Steve’s looking at him.
“But I’m your idiot,” Steve grins, boyish and playful and everything Tony’s ever loved him for.
"I'm not jealous.”
“I know you are,” Tony says softly, then turns at the next doorway and enters his son’s classroom.
“Is there a reason you’re naked in my bed?”
“Wouldn’t want that,” Steve says, baby blues running over every inch of Tony’s face with so much awe, it’s almost unbearable. “I’m kinda lookin’ forward to that date.”
“Nope. Come on, you won’t drop her, lemme see your arms– yep, there you go. Careful, please… see? All good,” Tony says, then smiles at the baby again. “This here’s Uncle Bucky, on your Papa’s side.”
It’s slow, whisper soft, and still as tentative as the first time, but it sends Tony’s heart racing like nothing else can, and he loses himself in the warmth of Steve’s lips as they caress his own.
“Sorry, I’m just a little... it’s been a while since I’ve cooked anything. I hope it’s good.”
“Yeah, you’ve said that more times than I can count.”
Tony nods once, and meets his eyes briefly before quickly looking away.
’, but he looks back up just in time to catch the happy curve of Steve’s lips.
“Steve--”
Tony tries not to envy the elegant lilt of her voice as he shakes her hand. “Tony Stark.”
"God, I want to marry you."
“You can’t- you
Even the guests– and there are more of them than Tony’d expected, but Steve’s never had a shortage of friends, no surprise– look like they’ve stepped right out of all those war reels Tony’d seen when he was a kid. It’s as perfect as he’d wanted Steve’s birthday to be. “‘Course it is,” he says, with more aplomb than he feels. “All my parties are.”
This, Tony thinks as he leans back into Steve’s chest to watch the rest of his family collectively lose their shit over their new member, is so damn good for his ego.
“We know, Steve,” Natasha says, mirth lacing every syllable.
” Clint giggles. “
Warnings: NONE.
“You guys are nauseating and this is the last party we’re inviting you to!” Clint yells at them as they cross the room, even as the rest of their friends share knowing looks.
“Figured you’d prefer burgers and hot dogs to anything else.”
After a night of thinking of a good time to do it the next day— like hell he’s going to ask in front of his students, and he will scrap the whole thing before doing it in front of Barton and the others— Tony waits until school’s out.
“That depends,” Steve bows his head, looking up at him through long eyelashes.
“Anything for you, princess,” Steve grins, and then, with a kiss blowed their way, he’s out the door.
Which, you know, it kind of felt like.
’d know what that’s like, right?” Rumlow smirks, and Tony’s blood runs cold. “Nobody thinks you’re worth a fuck, y’know. The whole school knows better than to waste their time with you.”
September passes without a hitch, then October, and that’s when Bucky announces one day during dinner that, "me ‘n Pep wanna have matchin’ costumes for Hall’ween, Steeb."
March Prompt #17: “Hello gorgeous, do I know you?”
“That is a first.”
“No.”
“Still, you don’t have to antagonize them.”
Tony smirks. “Well yeah, I wouldn’t want you to get bored.”
in front of him, almost looming over him with those shoulders, those eyes that Tony’s dreamt about so much.
Because Steve is sitting right in the middle, wiping his eyes hastily as he turns to face him. They’re big bright and red, even from where Tony’s standing, but it’s the wet tracks rolling down Steve’s face that he can’t look away from.
From the corner of his eye, Steve sees his friends nod.
“But we’re keeping it?” Tony smirks.
“No,” Tony shakes his head, and god, just the sound of Steve’s name is almost enough to send him running again.
“I’ll make it up to you later.”
Tony scoffs as he follows him up, and doesn’t even bother looking away from his boyfriend’s ass. “You fucked me against the wall twice last night–”
“Sap,” Tony whispers, and closes the space between them to press a quick kiss on Steve’s nose, laughing when the blond wrinkles it a second later. “Now entertain me, honey bunny.”
“Have some toast, first,” the blond says, reaching behind him to bring a plate of bread, and bumping it against Tony’s shoulder.
“Yeah,” the blond says. “Captain Steve Rogers, at your service.”
“Well ain’t you a sweetheart,” Tony breathes, slipping a finger under the lid to swipe a generous amount of the frosting, and Steve almost swallows his tongue when the brunet proceeds to lick it off his finger. “Thanks, cupcake,” he says after, reaching up to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek.
“You got in the way!”
“I regret calling you up here,” Natasha mutters, rolling her eyes as Clint grins at her over the scandalized faces of their pint-sized team leaders.
“Stebe,” Bucky says, rolling his eyes, “we already do that. We’re bros.”
“Impossible man,” Steve shakes his head, but he’s surprised at the fondness he can hear in his own voice.
“Tonight,” he whispers into Steve’s ear, and then gives it a gentle nip, “this whole fucking floor is our bedroom.”
Tony gives the rubble above them one final push, but just like the countless ones before, it’s in vain. With the armor out of power, he doesn’t even manage to move anything even an inch forward. “Fuck,” he growls. “Fucking shit. Steve–”
“You can’t use that all the time, y’know.”
“I don’t sound like that,” he points out, jabbing Steve’s bicep hard, and tries not to let his hand linger.
Tony can’t help the incredulous laugh that leaves his lips. “Uh, no. Thanks, but no thanks.”
ahead of them.
“Tony--”
Unfortunately, he remembers he’s still human when he has to tear his mouth from the good Captain’s to come up for air. The blond leans forward to follow his lips, eyes wide and dazed and the most perfect shade of blue
"Really, I just fucking told you-- fourteen hour flight? Did you hit your head, too?"
“That’s... that’s all you, Tony.”
“Do I what?”
“Picasso,” he says, and Pepper wrinkles his nose.
“Doin’ what?”
“Don’t jinx it!”
“The snow makes your eyes so bright,” Steve whispers, and the awe in his voice is enough to send a flood of warmth up Tony’s cheeks.
Prompt: PROPOSAL! :)
“Take care of the kids, Cap,” he mumbles distractedly, tapping at his phone now that it’s in his hands.
“Stop looking at me like that.”
“Yeah. I wanted to say thanks.”
“You already did,” Tony says. “I lost count twenty minutes into this thing.”
“Always,” Tony promises, and follows.
“I said I was sorry,” Steve mumbles, and almost gives Tony a heart attack when he reaches up to brush his fingers against Tony’s cheekbone. “It doesn’t hurt, does it?”
"To be fair, I'd do a hell of a lot more for you," Steve admits.
Tony lifts his head from Steve’s shoulder to meet his eyes. “Love you too, baby,” he says, and leans up to taste Steve’s grin with his own smiling lips.
“I just– I wanted to…”
“Say how much I… appreciate you.”
,” he leans in again for a short nip at Steve’s lips. “All feelings mutual.”
Steve rolls his eyes even as he blushes. “I can’t help it.”
“Tatiana,” Clint whispers. “It was an accident, shit, don’t let Nat find me, I swear I only looked away for a
“That comes
” Tony grumbles. “
“Simple rules, team,” he says, voice as serious as it is gentle. “Stay together, stay with me or Tony, look for trees you like, and have fun. Understood?”
“He doesn’t wanna see me.”
It’s slow and warm, and Tony’s lips taste like coffee and mint, a delicious combination that makes Steve lose track of how long the kiss lasts, but when finally Tony pulls away, they’re almost panting.
“I could get carpal tunnel.”
” Rhodey calls out, and Tony holds back a sigh at the eager nods all around.
“All the grapes you want.”
– if this is supposed to–” he breaks off into giggles, “– supposed to be punishment–
Warnings: NONE.
“Sure, come on. Who wants some help from Buck?” he calls, and then gestures him over when Sam raises his hand. It’s another hour before Tony calls them over for lunch, and Steve herds them in and out the elevator with a conspiratorial wink that sends his little crowd into titters.
