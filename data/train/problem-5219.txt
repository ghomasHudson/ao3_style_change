Sam is still laughing as Steve leads him across the shop to a table in the corner and sits down. "Honestly, Sam, why did I think going into business with my best friends was a good idea?"
Eventually, Natasha tells him it's time to go, and reluctantly, Casey packs up his things and pulls his backpack onto his back again. He gets to his feet, and then throws his little arms around Steve, giving him a huge hug. Steve is pretty sure he forgets how to breathe, he's so happy, and he crouches down so he can return the hug properly.
"I should, um, go. Get something to eat, I guess," Steve says, even though he has little interest in food, and even less interest in leaving Tony's side. But Pepper is – well, he's not entirely sure what Pepper is to Tony, but he knows she deserves time alone with him. Steve glances at Rhodey, leaning against the door frame of the room. He doesn't look apologetic at all – in fact, he's mostly ignoring Steve and just watching Tony's unmoving face.
The medical centre is chaos. There are doctors and nurses and volunteers running around, hauling equipment, yelling across corridors. The whole place is roiling like an ocean, and Steve doesn't know where to go.
Steve wants to argue, but there isn't anything he can say that won't sound like a lie. So he just takes another spoonful of stew and puts it in his mouth.
“Alright then,” Steve says, easing slightly. “Thanks Tony.” Thanks doesn’t begin to cover it. He can’t fully explain the way Tony saved him from his own dark backslide, how he hadn’t realised just how how afraid he was of being alone tonight.
The answer slides into his brain a moment later, and he audibly groans. "Assemble the team, Cap. We need all hands on deck. And tell Clint – I cannot believe I am saying this – bring all the paintballs he can carry.
“No one?” Steve responds, a little confused. “I was in basic for a week before the serum, and then I was on a USO tour. And then… well when I actually started fighting it was kind of a… hit the ground running sort of thing.” He shrugs. “Got in a lot of fights growing up though.”
"You're not the only one who had shit to do, Stark," Natasha chides him over the comm. He rolls his eyes.
"Wow," Steve says, trying not to think about Tony and Rhodey together in some way. "So, what, that's it?"
As he slowly begins to settle into his new place in the following days, the tension that had been building while he’d been trapped up in SHIELD begins to pass. He’s still in there almost every day, but having somewhere else to be and go back to helps. Not having to pass through security checkpoints every time he comes and goes outside helps. At least some days. The rest of the time, he’s up late, wandering aimlessly, and very pointedly not thinking about his empty, barren apartment.
The doorman – Reggie – puts the phone back into its cradle and jerks his chin toward the elevators. There's no button on the wall, but the one farthest to the right opens when they step up to it. There's a little placard above the doors that reads 'Penthouse Elevator'.
“Yeah, that’s me. What can I do for you?” He tries for casual but he falls short. He’s hoping that maybe Steve won’t notice.
Tony ends the call, grinning to himself, giddy over the fact that in just a few hours he's going to get a chance to see his boyfriend again. It's ridiculous, and it makes him feel like a dumb teenager all over again. But he doesn't care. He's happy.
"True story. I'll show you pictures when we're back. When it finally hit, it hit hard. I shot up, filled out. Starting training with Bucky so we could make it into the army together. Then, well, a few years of active service and I kind of just... gained a lot of muscle. Comes with the job."
"Sam! Save me! Steve is beating me up!" Clint yells as he darts around to the front of the counter and huddles behind Sam in mock cowardice. Steve rolls his eyes, and Sam turns to eye the man hiding behind him.
, that is definitely not what he wanted this very large, very big (very attractive gay) man to think he was saying.
He trails off, but his hand waves to indicate the space between Rhodey and Tony. As though to indicate there is something
"What happened?" Steve asks, confused, as he and Bucky head out the back door and start making their way down the street. Steve knows the general direction of Tony's house – he's watched Tony walk Casey to school or watched Tony walk into the shop often enough. Bucky glances at his phone, and Natasha must have texted him because he picks up his pace, destination known now. Together, they work up to a jog – they're both in good enough shape to handle it.
The club owner fires a shot, but HYDRA guy is ready for it and is already ducking for cover. His backup seems to take it as a personal offence and charges after them. Steve almost feels bad for the club owner and his crew. They aren’t going to stand a chance against highly trained HYDRA assets.
"It's – Wow, Sir, it's good to meet you, too. I'm real sorry about, well, taking your shield and trying to arrest you the last time we met, it was, um, I mean, Mr. Stark said you were breaking the law, so I was –"
warm and safe, but they have the benefit of being achingly familiar and comfortable, without any of the pesky one-sided sexual tension.
"Lucky for you, I love scrap metal," Tony says, completely ignoring the apology. Before Steve can stop him, he's come around the far side of the counter and is waltzing his way into the kitchen. He takes off his perfectly cut jacket and drops it haphazardly on the counter, and starts to roll up his sleeves. "Let's see what kind of fixing up the old girl needs."
. All he’d wanted was a lunch date, a few minutes where he could actually see his love, and spend a few minutes just the two of them, holding hands across the table like the massive sap he’s become.
Tony rolls his eyes. Really, with this? "Me and Rhodey? No. That's… that's a hard no. Rhodey is very much interested in the womenfolk," he says. "The menfolk, not so much. I mean, I'll take anything that walks by and winks at me…"
For Clint and Steve, it's like a burst of light, a moment when the sun crests the horizon in the east, turning the dim shadows of dawn into an explosion of colour, light and warmth. It's why Bucky and Natasha have been so drawn to both of them, she imagines.
Their fight comes to a sudden and startling halt as the room is suddenly filled with a fully decked out TAC team, weapons raised, shouting for everyone to get on the ground. Predictably, both HYDRA and the club crew try and flee towards the back of the building, but don’t make it farther than ten feet before they’re surrounded by the second half of the TAC team. One of the HYDRA goons tries to go for his weapons, but his hand barely has a chance to twitch before he’s roughly thrown the to ground, his head hitting with a crack and his shoulder dislocating when he tries to struggle. The rest put up far less of a fight.
They're both spent, gasping for air and covered in sweat. Tony shivers, keening slightly as Steve rubs soothing hands up and down his flanks, his back, over his ass.
"It's almost Christmas," Steve says, voice rough and broken. Small. The voice of someone who has known loss over and over again. "It's December."
"No, man, you wanna make fun of my beverage order, I'm gonna spill all your business out in the open, see if I don't."
"But you have to remember that you'll still have a life to live. Casey isn't here anymore, but you are. Tony is."
He hauls Tony up to a standing position, heart pounding as Tony is suddenly close, so close Steve can feel a puff of breath on his jawline, and time stops entirely for just a second while they stare into each other's eyes.
He needed to get out. Nowhere in the mansion was safe for him any more. Sure, he could try and hide out in the workshop, but that’s the first place they’d look for him, and he just
In the days after the accident, everything shifts, and it's absolutely not for the better. It's driving Bucky completely insane. He and Clint had ignored Steve's insistence that he was fine, and didn't need any help, and found excuses to work from the Manhattan shop for a few days.
"Look, man, I like coffee as much as the next guy – actually, okay, I may have a slightly uncontrolled addiction to coffee but that's neither here nor there – but we just don't want that kind of –"
"You and I both know you're not worried about how Clint and me are gonna work now we're home," Bucky interrupts him. "This is about you and Tony, because you love him. You're worried that it's not real because the Haven wasn't real – but the things we did there? The things we went through? That's all real. It's all a real experience we had. The relationships we formed, the love you felt – that's real."
He loses track of time after that. The worst of the sobs have subsided, but he’s still hit with the occasional wave, like all of his feelings are still scrambling to evacuate. He wishes they would just hurry up and get it done so he didn’t have to feel anything anymore.
"Yeah. There's a tech start-up there we're meeting with about a project we're looking to get going on. So I booked a meeting with them to tour the space and throw some ideas around. I don't really want to be away from Casey overnight, so I was going to leave first thing in the morning and come back that night."
"That's true," Tony nods, pretending to think it over. "Did you tidy up your room this morning with Miss Natasha?"
"Yeah," Steve agrees. "Unfortunately, we both need to get up. Sam needs my help with the set up at the VA.”
Without thinking, Steve moves his hand under the blankets, and takes Tony's hand. Tony laces their fingers together in response, and squeezes gently. "She got to hold him, before she died. She named him Casey. And the docs and nurses, they were amazing. Really. I still can't get over how fantastic and supportive they were. I was a goddamned mess. I was angry, and scared, and hurt. Rhodey came to the hospital to get me. I wanted nothing more than to drink enough whisky to convince myself that I was dreaming, that this wasn't really happening. But before we left the hospital, I took Rhodey to the nursery to meet him. We walked in and... there he was. This tiny little bundle, half asleep, wrapped up in his little blanket. I went to touch him, and he smiled at me, with his little eyes barely open. And I swear to god, my heart broke and stitched itself back together at the same time. He was just... the most perfect thing I had ever seen in my life. I didn't know that any human could feel that much love all at once and not explode. I swore to myself that I would do whatever it took to keep him safe, and to make Rumiko proud of us. That's what I've tried to do."
The bell above the door jingles again, and Steve looks up to see Clint and Bucky walking in together. "Oh hey, kiddo," Bucky greets, waving over to Casey.
It’s well past a sane or reasonable hour, but he’d known early on that this was going to be a Bad Night. He’s trying and trying to wear himself out, to burn enough energy so that his mind will be too tired to keep playing the same images over and over on repeat, burned in his memory for every time that he closes his eyes. He growls, low and fierce and frustrated, and drives his fist into the bag, splitting it and ripping it free from its chain. His third one of the night. His shoulders sag, and behind him he hears footsteps and the door clanging shut.
"We don't have time for this, Tony! Every second we spend fighting among ourselves is a second we lose of preparation for the real fight. And it's coming whether we're ready or not."
Tony's stomach twists itself up into knots of fear and anxiety, and he feels like he wants to throw up. But his brain is already kicking into high gear, throwing solutions to the problem.
But as much fun as he’s having, he’s happy to set it aside when JARVIS informs him it’s time to get ready for his reservation. He dons his suit with a shirt Steve had picked out for him one day, and heads out to the restaurant in Greenwich Village where they’d had their first
A light blush dusts Steve's cheeks, and Tony does have to admit it had sounded a little bit flirty, but he ignores it because he knows Steve didn't mean it that way. Tony does wink back, though, and waves toward the case. "Cannoli for me, please. And what kind of cookie for Casey?"
"Look, Tony, I really appreciate your help but if you have a meeting, I mean, I can call someone, it won't be –"
, certainly not to the extent that he could be deemed ‘the guy my dad never shut up about.’ Stark had caught him flat footed — a feeling he had been experiencing a lot in the past week and a half, and one he was growing to hate with every fiber of his being.
Natasha gives him a look, scrunching her face up as though he's said the most ridiculous thing she's ever heard. Her leg is propped up on a stack of pillows. The medics don't think it's broken, so she's still waiting for an X-Ray while those who definitely have broken limbs are treated first.
"Clint, why are your arrows suddenly leaving pink–" Bucky pauses and stoops down, running a finger through the pink mess as Natasha dismantles the last couple of creatures. "Oh my god, Clint. Is this paint? Did you make fucking paintball arrows?"
"I know, isn't she great?" Clint beams up at Nat, and she reaches over and ruffles his hair. "But seriously, Bucky. Enough is enough. We need to tell Steve to get his head out of his ass and do something." It's honestly painful to watch, and seriously, Clint has had enough. He just wants Steve to be happy, and seeing Steve with Tony and with Casey is the happiest Clint has seen him in longer than he can remember.
"Don't mind him. His partner in crime isn't here today, so he's just acting out. I'm not keeping him busy enough, apparently."
"You loved him," Steve repeats. "You loved him, and you protected him, and you didn't lose him. He was taken from you. Everything in the Haven was taken from us. But that's all the more reason to grab hold of something that would make us happy now."
"This is better," Tony tells him, not slowing his strides. They'll be inside soon, and then it will be cooler.
Eventually, Rhodey pulls back, and Tony swipes his hand across his face, wiping away a few tears that had leaked out.
It was too bad that peaceful, emotional moment that he’d shared with Tony in the hospital hadn’t lasted. Almost from the time that Steve and Tony were back in the same space they were back on each other’s cases. Steve had been trying to make it work but… it wasn’t going well.
But as soon as his attention hits the project he's been working on, he loses all sense of time. He checks the NannyCam feed from time to time, and Casey is still fast asleep, so Tony keeps working away.
wearing for underwear. Steve, at least, is wearing sensible, comfortable-looking boxer shorts. Really, they're completely unattractive, and he's so glad for that because the last thing he needs right now is to have to look at Steve in something sexy. It's bad enough as it is.
"Hey, kid, I'm outta here," Natasha says, crouching down on her knees to give Casey a hug. He launches himself at her and winds his skinny little arms around her neck. "I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?"
"I have a proposition for you," Tony announces without preamble, sauntering up to the counter and dropping the folder down in front of him. Steve's eyes pinch a little in the corners in a hint of a tell, but he stays smiling and polite. "Hear me out," he continues before Steve can object.
He doesn't mean that. He's just hurting right now. He'll push it down and get on with it, the way he always does.
intentions they should be worried about.” Steve voice was thick and heavy with intention and promise, and it took a great deal of self control not to arch himself against Steve with an audience sitting right there. Instead, he looked over his shoulder at his team — his family — and in a very adult manner, stuck his tongue out at them. Steve laughed, and stepped towards the door, pulling Tony with him, away from the warm, supportive, not-at-all mischievous smiles of the group.
"No," Strange said. "Ms. Maximoff, we need you here. The level of your power… we can't risk trying to fight Thanos without you. We need all the firepower we can get."
"The exact dinner we ordered? Yes. Yes it is." Tony confirms. "I flew back to the restaurant. They were packing up for the night after all the excitement, but the chef was more than happy to finish our order. He says thanks, by the way. And not to worry about the plate."
After the great oven incident, Steve makes sure that everyone on staff knows that Tony never pays for coffee ever again. Steve is in the back the first time Tony comes in after, but he overhears Sandi arguing with him about not taking his money. Steve comes out of the back to find Sandi standing behind the counter, arms folded over her chest and smiling sweetly – but fiercely – at Tony.
Before Tony can say much else, Steve is there, looking concerned. "Everything okay over here?" he asks. "That woman – she wasn't bothering you, was she?"
"Stark," Thanos spits, and for the first time, Tony looks into the true face of the nightmare that's haunted him since the wormhole, since the Chitauri. He swallows his fear, and in one quick movement, fires a repulsor blast at the already gaping wound and pulls with everything he has until the gauntlet comes free. Tony's hands are shaking as he holds it, brain racing to catch up with what's just happened.
It feels like a private moment, but Steve can't look away. He hasn't seen Tony in a week. Even though the man looks like he's been through the wringer to hell, and even though the circumstances are horrific, he's still a beautiful sight for sore eyes.
He looks over at Strange, and is impressed to find Strange's expression twisted up into something uncomfortable.
"Oh, did he, now?" Bucky says, raising an eyebrow at Steve. Yet another thing Steve is never going to hear the end of.
"Yeah, fire me, I dare you, we'll see how long it takes Congress to get all up your ass," Rhodey mutters.
Then he smiles. It's still tinged with sadness, but it's real. His teeth gleam in the low light of the hospital room, and his eyes are bright and hopeful.
. And that simple pleasure that comes as he takes another bite makes him feel just a little bit better.
"Don't play dumb, Widow," the woman says snidely. The strange nickname makes the record skip again. "You and I both know why you're all here. Trying to
"Actually, we should get together because I've been thinking about getting into medical prosthetics, that kind of thing, and, I mean, who better to start with than veterans, and who better to talk to about veterans, am I right?" Tony's still talking even as he drops Sam's hand and moves toward the oven, crouches down beside it and shoves his arm down into the back, the narrow space between the oven and the wall, and starts fiddling with something that Steve obviously can't see. "I mean, Rhodey's former Air Force – he's my government liaison – but he never defers to me because he likes to be contrary, and I think it'd be nice to talk to someone who still thinks I'm kind of a big deal instead of someone who knows what I look like when I'm drooling into my pillow, you know?"
Oh, man. Tony feels like a real idiot, now. Of course, Justine Hammer. Daughter of Justin Hammer. He hadn't known her back in Haven, but now he recognizes the name.
Tony takes the glove off Thanos' hand. Steve isn't far; he's dealing with a swarm of the alien beasts nearby when Thor comes across the bifrost, battles with Thanos. When Thor gets a hit in on Thanos' head, he goes nearly limp, limbs heavy with the injury. It won't be for long. Even from here, Steve can see that Thanos is gathering his strength, working to close his fist so he can use the power of the Infinity Stones, but then Tony is there. Tony
He's been searching for a qualified nanny for six months. No one is right for the job – they're good with childcare, but not with making sure Casey is
They take Tony's car and another from the Stark Resilient motor pool, splitting up into two teams. Tony drives his own, with Rhodey and Clint, while Steve drives the Stark Resilient car with Natasha, Bucky, and Sam.
Steve crosses his arms over his chest (which makes his biceps bulge somehow even more ridiculously) and blinks at Tony.
"Mr. Stark," the doorman says into the phone. "Reggie, here, from the desk. Got a couple gentlemen here sayin' you might be expecting them." He pauses. "Sure thing, Sir."
"Rhodey, there was no flirting. I wasn't flirting with him. He wasn't flirting with me. Period. End of story." His words come out in a harsh whisper, and he peers furtively over Rhodey's shoulder to the counter, worried that Steve is going to overhear what they're talking about.
He wants to curl up in a ball, wants to scream and cry. Strange hadn't told him it would feel like this; that the people that they had been over there in that reality – Strange had called it the Haven – would bleed into who they are now. That they would bring back all the memories, all the feelings, all the loves –
It's the only comfort Steve can take in the fact that Tony is still here, in the bed, not waking up.
"Oh. Jeez. Uh, sorry," Tony scrambles for a sheet to wrap around himself to preserve what little dignity he has left. "I didn't –"
. As in Stark Resilient. As in Forbes' most talked-about 'up and coming' tech company in a generation. Steve is just a broken-down vet with a case of PTSD who's recently mortgaged his stupid little coffee shop to expand it into
“Maybe I’m not just interested in being your tool,” Steve says. “Think I’m dealing with enough of that already, thanks.” He folds his arms over his chest and stares, hard and unyielding.
After Steve had recovered, which thankfully took only a few days with his healing speeds, he didn’t really have any place to go. He couldn’t go home - his apartment was still a crime scene. He couldn’t go back to work - SHIELD had gone more or less under on account of a cephalopod infestation.
Across the field, he sees Steve, fighting with all that rage and fury that constantly burns inside him. If Steve had known then, in Stuttgart, what he was walking into, would
When Steve had brought Casey back to him, Tony had – he doesn't have words for how he'd felt. Relief is too mild a term. His chest still aches with it, with setting eyes on Casey.
A few things click into place all at once, and suddenly the woman who’d taken an interest in him and ‘what was troubling him’ makes a hell of a lot more sense.
stay away forever. For one thing, he’d miss Steve too much, and he’d be hard pressed to convince Steve that they should run away and live naked on a private island together. So, eventually, he made his way back, trying his best to sneak into the kitchen unnoticed to grab some food. The ‘unnoticed’ part didn’t end up working too well, considering the size of the group hanging around the large kitchen island, but before he could say anything to them or them to him, Tony felt strong arms encircle him from behind, pulling him into a broad chest.
“You wanna communicate?” Steve says, eyes darkening and grin turning impish. “Let’s work on practicing ‘oh, yes, harder.’”
"Oh, yeah! We're expanding! We're pretty excited about it – I wanted to be a little closer to the MoMA, but you take what you can get with real estate, am I right?"
"Right. Okay, Anne. Let me tell you what you did right," he says. Anne's head snaps up and she looks at him, confused. "One, you tried to do something new, and innovative. Were you intentionally trying to raise hell and cause harm?"
Steve's brain snaps into gear and suddenly, he's thinking with perfect clarity. This is a crisis, and he needs to make sure his people get out of it and to safety, even if 'his people' is just Tony at the moment. "We need to get out of the snow, we'll freeze out here." The driver's side door is still open from where Tony climbed out, and Steve drags himself up into a sitting position on the seat. He reaches over to the passenger side of the car where he'd been sitting, and grabs the sweater he'd tucked onto the floor. "Here," he says, passing the sweater over to Tony. "Put this on, you need to stay warm."
"There we go, that's what we need," Tony says, clapping his hands together. "Lucky for us, I know how to fix this."
"I do recall that," Steve nods, and then catches sight of what's sitting on the table. "Oh my god, Tony, is that –"
“You’ll have to try harder than that, Barnes,” Clint taunts as he darts across the space and out of sight.
Casey's already got his face pressed up against the glass, big eyes drinking in the cookie choices. Steve is grinning as he slides over the coffee Tony hadn't even ordered yet, and a small mango lemonade. "You want something sweet, too, Tony?"
Tony swallows hard. This is it, then. The moment he's lost countless hours worrying about. Preparing for. Everything they'd done since the day they'd hit the streets of New York together have been building to this. Earth's mightiest heroes. Her last defenders. He hopes like hell they're enough, because they're all there is.
"What the hell are you doing, Steve?" Bucky demands, striding into the office and kicking the door shut behind him.
“Then what is it? ‘Cause I have tried my damndest to make sure you and everyone else there has everything they need.”
At some point, Rhodey comes in and brings him dinner, and doesn’t comment on how red and puffy Tony’s eyes are.
this, so much so that it aches. And with Steve — maybe Steve believing in him will be enough on the days that he can't believe in himself.
“Sam and I will be on stand by a few blocks out, we’ll follow you there. Call if you need anything.” She squeezes his shoulder gently on the way out, and Steve doesn’t move until he’s heard the door to his apartment click quietly shut behind her.
"No," Shuri agrees, "But he will be in the best possible care, Tony. He'll be okay. We'll do whatever we need to do to take care of him."
Steve's stomach twists up a little at the mention of Rhodey and the blunt reminder of the place that he has in Casey and Tony's life. He shouldn't be jealous, Tony and Casey aren't
Bucky snorts again, louder this time. "Sure, maybe not. But that's not gonna apply to you and Stark."
It's such a casual statement, but to Steve, it feels like there's more to it. Another layer that reveals something about Tony that feels a little more vulnerable.
Tony had told him, back when things were going off the rails with the Sokovia Accords, that he and Pepper had broken up. They hadn't talked about it before they'd gone to the Haven, and then Tony hadn't remembered Pepper had even existed for the duration of their time there.
At that moment, their little heart to heart is interrupted by a shriek of "Bucky!" and a tiny human throwing himself at Bucky's legs, clinging on.
"Deal," Steve says, giving him a knowing look that makes Tony want to just make out with him here and now, in the middle of the street. He settles for stealing a quick kiss. Steve's mouth tastes absolutely vile, covered in slime residue, but Tony couldn't care less. Any kiss is a good kiss if it's from his Steve.
With that, he turns and walks out of the shop. He can still hear Steve's musical chuckle as the door swings shut behind him.
With that knowledge, Tony is sleeping better at night. He's more productive at the office. When he's at home with Casey, he can put all his energy into enjoying that time, instead of wondering whether Casey will be okay through the summer, or whether he's in danger, or if the company will fold and they'll end up out on the street living in a van.
"Gonna have to keep that leg up. You should probably ice it, but that can wait until you warm up and dry off. I've got some Tylenol, you'll need it. Keep an eye on your abdomens, and if they start hurting, or if there's any bruising that starts to form you let me know ASAP. Might be internal injuries. Where were you boys headed?"
It's ridiculous. He has no business thinking any kind of thoughts about Steve Rogers. They're friendly, sure, but they're not even friends. They'd gotten off to a rocky start, but now Tony's in the shop daily, and most days Steve's working in the Manhattan shop. Tony's started to wonder if Steve even bothers to work in the Brooklyn shop anymore.
"Yep, I thought it –" Tony breaks off as Steve, against his own better judgement, whirls and pulls him into a tight, huge hug. His arms go around Tony's torso and he squeezes, doing his best to put the feeling of
"You've lost a lot, recently," Sam says quietly. It's not a question, exactly, so he doesn't wait for an answer. "Both of you have. Casey – he wasn't real, not really, but he kind of was. Strange took all the good parts from Vision and Tony and made a child out of it. And that kid… man, that kid was amazing. Funny, and curious, and smart, and so kind."
He is, however, pleased at how well Natasha seems to have fit into their lives. Casey really does adore her, and she'd come with more references than he'd ever seen on a resume for a Nanny. She'd worked on the secret service detail for the White House, and when the president's kids had been small, she'd been in charge of their care despite her young age at the time. She'd worked private security for a few years, and now she's Tony's nanny – meaning that no matter what, Casey is in good hands. Hands that can protect him.
After some squabbling, Tony ends up paying the bill, but Steve manages to convince Tony to let him pay the tip. Together, they head outside and Tony offers to walk back to Steve’s apartment with him. Steve puts up a token protest, because it’s a 20 minute walk in the wrong direction, but Tony waves him off, saying he could use the walk, and he’ll just flag a cab to get home after. Steve doesn’t argue, because truthfully, he wants the company for as long as he can get it. He wants to cling to this connection and try to convince himself it’s real. That it’s something that he can hold on to.
Not that he needs to talk to Steve about anything. He'd like to think they're more than casual acquaintances at this point, but he doesn't dare hope for anything higher than 'more or less friends'.
"That's a pretty damn special kid," Bucky remarks softly, resting his hand on Steve's shoulder and squeezing gently. Steve's heart tugs with longing, and he sighs.
Tony snorts, then pulls a triumphant hand back, grinning and holding onto some hunk of metal that Steve doesn't recognize.
"I mean, trust me. If we tell him how he feels, or try and strong arm him into this, he's just going to reject it, clam up and pull away even more." Bucky shakes his head. "No, he has to think it's his idea."
He rides for a long while, arching his back and circling his hips and grinding down to try to put as much pressure on his own prostate as he can. He knows he's chasing his own pleasure more than he's trying to make it good for Steve, but by the sounds Steve is making and the way his hands are tightening on Tony's hips, Tony can be reasonably sure he's having just as good a time.
He’s pretty sure Pinky knows who he is, even though there’s been no announcement that Steve is in fact alive, but the guy also doesn’t seem to care. He just lets Steve do his thing and occasionally tells stories about what New York was like when he was younger and how the neighbourhood has changed. He never asks Steve anything personal, and never pushes when Steve volunteers information of his own. This place is a sanctuary, where he feels sane, and where he can fight the demons inside himself that keep him awake at night.
"But you're hurt – you need rest, you need painkillers, you need something that isn't me pawing at you like a teenager."
It had been strange, watching the odd-looking spaceship full of aliens – and Peter Quill – touch down in the middle of the Avengers Compound. Tony had watched from his window for a bare moment before suiting up, calling for Rhodey to do the same, and then going to confront the ship.
"You'll all be connected," Strange said. "You'll have lived entire lives, and those lives will lead you to each other. As for Vision – well, there's nothing more protective than a parent's love, is there?"
thorough background checks he'd started on the (very) short list of possible nanny candidates. Casey will be done school in just a few weeks – Tony doesn't have much time to waste.
He's standing there in the empty, half-finished shop, staring out the window like an idiot. He can't tear his eyes away from Tony and his son. Because the kid – Casey, Tony had said – obviously worships the ground Tony walks on. He's looking up at his dad like he hung the moon and the stars and then presented them to Casey as a gift.
"Remember that department of defense meeting you skipped?" Rhodey says, barging into Tony's office without knocking.
here, and this conversation is happening whether he likes it or not. His brain seems completely on board with this, because before he realises what he’s saying, Steve is growling back, “I can’t stand being so close to you, knowing you can’t stand to be around me. I can’t stand having you so close and being reminded all the time that I want you and can never have you. That I can’t even manage to be
in bed with Tony. They're in the hotel, and Steve – oh God, Steve had just tried to kiss Tony. Tony, who'd told him all about his wife. Tony, who wants nothing to do romantically with some coffee shop-owning war vet with lingering trauma issues.
He gets up and goes to the refrigerator, finding himself a few bottles of water. He drains one immediately, then takes the other and sips at it while he leans against the counter and thinks.
There's an even better-looking guy actually making the drinks and putting together the orders. He's fast and accurate, and Tony sneaks a peek at each and every cup put on the pick-up counter, and all the names look like the correct spelling of the actual names that the customers had given with their order. Each latte is done up with a deceptively fast, beautiful piece of latte art.
It's so quiet on the street without the sound of a scuffle in his ear. He can hear gunshots faintly in the distance, but not much else.
Ah. Yeah. That. Honestly, Steve should have seen that coming. He's gotten better about talking about his PTSD, his experiences, his struggles. But it's still awkward, and hard. It makes him feel all kinds of vulnerable. But, Tony had exposed himself to Steve, bared his soul. Steve could trust him in the same way. And, it was good to talk about it. Or that's what his therapist and Sam and all the group meetings kept telling him.
It's not his first sleepless night, and it won't be his last. He makes his way to his bedroom, and flops onto his bed fully clothed, face mashed into the pillow, and falls asleep almost instantly.
"Hey Casey, did you know that Steve also really likes art?" Natasha says. Steve looks up, a little surprised, but she just shrugs. "Clint."
"Of course I'm not moping, why would I be moping?" Steve turns his attention back to the screen. Bucky knows there isn't anything of interest there, it's just so that he can avoid meeting Bucky's gaze, because Steve is a terrible liar.
"Anything I've got won't mean shit if if there's no world left to enjoy it," Tony said, lowering his voice as well.
Tony presses his nose into Casey's hair, letting the smell of blueberry-scented shampoo fill his senses.
Tony has instructions to let Clint and Rhodey out a few blocks away from the meeting location, in case the kidnapper – or any partners – is watching. They don't want to tip their hand too early. It's better if the kidnapper thinks Tony really did come alone.
"You know, I haven't really talked about her in a long time," Tony admits. "It... feels really nice, actually. I mean, it hurts still. Think it always will. But, I dunno. It's easier now to remember the good things. And I see so much of her in Casey. He got me through the roughest years of my life. I'd have been lost without him." Tony's voice sounds significantly less strained around the edges now, he feels more relaxed laying in the bed, and Steve has learned more about Tony in the last few minutes than he probably has in the entire time they've known each other. It reiterates the fact that Tony is tough, stubborn, and beautifully impressive.
He'd rather not, really. The underwear, sure, whatever. He wears it because he finds it comfortable, and it makes him feel a little bit sexy even when nothing's going to come of it. But the wet, dirty, cold pants?
"It's not what you think," Pepper says softly. "We're not – we tried again, for a little while. But it wasn't right, we both knew it. He and I – we're not together."
It still somehow manages to feel like the longest day ever – longer even then the day before when he'd been counting down the minutes until Steve's plane landed. Now, he'd gotten a taste of actually having he and Steve in the same place, with schedules that cross paths, however slightly. And he wants more.
"Bucky was bleeding out in the sand, we were being shot at, and I had no idea what the status of the rest of my crew was. So I did the only thing I could do. I threw Bucky over my shoulder, and ran for cover behind one of the other vehicles. Thank god Nicki and Clint made it. Dee – one of the most level headed, good under pressure people we had – helped me load Bucky into the vehicle. She said everyone was on their feet, so I called for a retreat, and the squad got the hell out of there. We didn't lose anyone that day, which is nothing short of a goddamned miracle. Though if we'd have been out there any longer, Bucky wouldn't have made it. He was in surgery for hours, and even when the docs on the base got him stable, they weren't sure whether or not he'd lose the arm. Turned out in the mess I'd torn some ligaments in my knee, and then fucked them up even worse by dragging Bucky around. Shock and adrenaline were the only reason I was still standing. Once the dust settled, Bucky was given a mandatory medical discharge. Clint and I both opted to take honorable discharges too. We were done, neither of us wanted to go back out there, and we didn't want to send Bucky home alone."
Without needing to be asked, Steve puts his own coffee down, picks up the French press, and pours coffee into Tony's outstretched mug. Tony leans over and kisses Steve's shoulder, snuggling back into the pillows and pushing his toes up against Steve's ankle.
"It's definitely better. Anyway, Mr. Stark, it was nice to meet you," Rogers says, and now his tone is pure dismissal. "I've got to get back to the counter, we're about to see the mid-afternoon pick-me-up rush. I'm sure I'll see you around the neighbourhood."
"You always were a sucker," Bucky agrees, and Steve basks in the wave of relief that Bucky hadn't been offended or hurt by the joke.
Steve glances up at the clock, and it's right around the time that Casey normally gets out of school. The bell rings on the door, and Steve looks up hopefully, to see Casey coming in with Natasha in tow. A small part of him is disappointed Tony isn't in, but it's nice to catch up with Natasha now that she's integrated into their lives as well – she had been serious about being Clint's new best friend. The two of them fell into step together so naturally Steve would almost swear that they've known each other for years. And these days, seeing Casey brightens Steve's day as much as seeing Tony.
He watches Casey play with his friends for another moment before he heads off in the direction of the office. Another strategic placement, Stark Resilient's corporate offices are only a few more blocks down the street, and most days Tony walks back and forth from the preschool. So far, he's managed to only walk down the street a few times during lunch to make sure everything is okay at the school, though he'd never admit it to anyone.
"Everything is secured out here," Bucky says into his comm, voice impossibly relieved. "Next time you take that comm out of your ear on a mission I'm going to staple it to your skull."
Steve chuckles, and it sounds warm and intoxicating. "We don't have to do it all in one night, Tony." His expression falters a little, and suddenly he looks young and unsure. "I mean, I'm clean, after my last test, and I haven't been with anyone since, well – for a while."
because I fucking told them the timeline was unreasonable, and I have bigger shit to worry about. Because school lets out in a couple of weeks and I've been spending the time I should be spending asleep catching up on new projects and looking for childcare, and I cannot for the life of me find someone qualified to watch Casey. I mean, how hard is it? I'm not asking much. All I want is someone who, you know, is competent and trustworthy, and can actually keep my son safe, but I'd have an easier time getting the moon than getting an actual, decent nanny. So look, I know you're just trying to run a business and do good or whatever the hell else you're trying to do. But you need to do it somewhere else. Because this? Worrying about this? I literally –" he instinctively takes a sip of coffee from the cup that's just magically appeared in his hand, and his eyes widen. "– Holy shit. What. Is. This."
After the third sip, Tony manages to tear his gaze away from the cup and turns his attention back to Steve. "So," he says carefully, "all the other parents I've talked to won't shut up about how great this place is, how nice you all are, how much they love having a good, wholesome cafe next to the school."
"Tony, love of my life," Steve sighs, "as much as I love what you're thinking right now, I really just need to get clean. And maybe actually eat. Then I can think about burning more calories."
Tony knows he's trapped. Either he gives in and allows Rhodey to think that he can convince him to act on the crush he keeps denying, or he fights back by insisting they
He watches his son talk animatedly about what he hopes to see at the aquarium, and he watches Steve listen, respond, and interact with him. Casey is already smitten – he loves it when adults treat him like a peer, and Steve is a natural with him.
"I'm glad you found someone," Steve says, feeling his own sense of relief. It's definitely because of how much less stressed Tony looks now compared to the first day they'd met — which wasn't actually that long ago, even though it feels like ages. The relief
While Tony takes small sips of his coffee and nibbles at the sweet cannoli, Steve slips back under the covers on his side of the bed, picking up his tablet and his own cup of coffee from the bedside table.
Except no, okay, Steve shouldn’t really be here. The meeting is important — necessary really, for the team to keep up a working relationship with the Rest of the World. But dammit, it feels like he’s barely seen Steve at all in weeks. It’ll pass, once he’s done with his R&D deadlines, once Steve is finished this round of meetings and PR crap. But it doesn’t help
Steve gives what he hopes is a reassuring smile. He answers with more confidence than he really feels. "The doctors think so. We're just waiting for him to wake up, now. Physically, he'll heal. But there's some question… because of the stones. And their power. It's not something anyone has any medical experience with."
for eight months," Bucky says. "Just because time didn't pass the same here, doesn't mean we didn't live eight months of our lives in that place."
"Good. I asked Miss Natasha if we could come and get a cookie even though Daddy isn't here and she said
“Yeah. It is. I know I have this whole life that I can’t remember. It just feels empty. Sometimes, when I sleep, I think I dream about my memories. And when I wake up, for a second I think I have it. But it doesn’t last.”
There's a beat. Steve waits to hear Tony's reaction. He doesn't recognize the name, but he wouldn't, necessarily.
Tony, who is so beautiful that it leaves Steve breathless, had helped him because he's feeble and ridiculous and – his knee? Really? They get into a stupid car accident and his
"Yeah?" Tony asks. "So do I, Case." He glances back over his shoulder at the shop as they head down the block and smiles. "Yeah, we can definitely come back."
"I have no idea why this is working, but best. Day. Ever!" Clint yells, letting go another volley of arrows. The rest of the team has swapped out their regular weapons for the paintball rifles, and Steve is ordering a perimeter to keep the slime beasts from wreaking anymore havoc outside the city block. All the civilians had either been cleared or shooed inside, and Tony can see that the restaurant window is packed with faces pressed against the glass as diners watch the battle unfold.
"And I have it on good authority from Rhodey that Tony hasn't been on a date since Casey was born," Natasha adds.
Steve reaches over and puts a comforting hand on Tony's back. Tony hunches in on himself, but at the same time he leans just a little in Steve's direction.
"I can not stand idly by, no more than could you. Others will fight, and risk their lives for this world. For this universe. I will do no less than the same."
"We've got strawberry lemonade, raspberry lemonade, and mango lemonade," Steve says, tone serious. He gives Casey a little wink. "I think the mango might be my favourite."
"You're makin' me sound like a drug dealer," Steve mutters as he pours Tony a cup of the daily brew — which they are very definitely
"See, Steve gets it," Tony says haughtily. "My kid is the best kid, and deserves all the people around him to love and protect him as he deserves to be loved and protected."
"Yeah," Tony agreed. "It –" Tony hesitates, draws in another steadying breath, and presses on. "It was the best, and worst day of my life. I got Casey, but I lost Rumiko." Steve feels Tony shift again, rolling onto his back so they're both laying side by side, staring up at the ceiling in the dark. "It's honestly crazy to think about. All the advances we have in medicine, in health care... we had the best medical team that we could, and it still wasn't enough. Things just... happen. It, uh, it was a hard pregnancy for her. She was sick, and in pain a lot. But she wanted to go through with it. The doctors were amazing, they took such good care of her the whole time. The birth itself was really hard, but she pushed through. She never gave up on anything, Rumiko. But... right after he was born... I don't know what happened. Her blood pressure skyrocketed, and um, she started hemorrhaging. They couldn't stop the bleeding in time. They tried so hard." This last comes out as barely a whisper.
"Good. Good. Okay, I'm calling Nat. Steve, you need to call Clint. Do you understand? Clint needs to meet us at Tony's house."
"Not – it's good. For both of you, probably. I just mean… how is it? How… do you make it make sense?"
With a sigh, he pulls his jock underwear on, adjusting his dick and balls so they're comfortably seated in them, sliding his fingers under the straps in the back to smooth them out, trying not to think too hard about how bare his ass is. Why hadn't he just put on something else this morning? Why?
“Whatever information you can find.  The more, the better,” Natasha says, leaning against his counter and drawing his attention back to the task at hand. “We know who’s involved, but that doesn’t do us a lot of good if we can’t recover the assets. You thinking of moving on us, Steve?”
Tony blinks, not expecting to have been called 'sir'. Well, maybe there's a chance to salvage this negotiation after all.
Steve makes his way back to the medical centre and finds Tony's room. Rhodey and Pepper are gone, but Natasha and Thor are there instead. Thor glances up when Steve comes in, but Natasha doesn't move – Steve can tell by the set of her shoulders that she knows he's there, though.
So maybe, just maybe, Tony has reason to believe that Steve might have some of those same positive feelings for Tony?
“In the flesh,” Stark confirms. He tilts his head as though considering for a moment, and then nods. “I’ll take him.”
Steve wouldn't be shy about sex, Tony imagines. He'd be confident in bed, certain about what he wanted and how to get it. He's probably got a bit of a knight-in-shining-armour complex, and Tony could get used to that, play the unsure damsel.
Steve washes his hands quickly, and he's still drying them off as he walks up front, ignoring the grease and dirt covering his arms and shirt and, probably, face. Evan is, as expected, completely in the weeds. He's running around trying to take orders, make specialty drinks, and explain to every third customer that no, they don't have cinnamon rolls today and yes, he does know it's Wednesday, but the oven isn't working, and he's very sorry, really, but until the oven is fixed they won't be able to have any baked goods, and on and on.
Rhodey drives to Brooklyn first. Sam and Clint get out of the car, and Steve moves as though he's going to follow, but he's reluctant about breaking physical contact with Casey.
Tony blinks in confusion. "Yes? I mean, I sent you a text telling you I was okay, we're just stuck overnight."
"Mr. Stark? Tony?" Julie says, regaining his attention. She's looking at him bemusedly, and Tony realizes he hasn't responded.
start to worry," Steve tells him, and Tony can hear the laughter in his voice. "I brought you a cup of coffee."
"You just spent the equivalent of eight months in a dimension I created from scratch, Stark. You're not honestly going to get your socks in a knot about a little portal."
Steve obliges wholeheartedly, mouth sliding over Tony's heatedly. Tony licks at the seam of Steve's lips, and Steve rewards him by parting them. Tony groans at the taste of him.
“Hm, way to give me mixed signals.” Tony huffs at that, but Steve continues. “I love you, too. You found dinner, I see.”
The third set of thugs is a little better trained, better prepared, and this time Steve takes a couple of punches to the face. Of course, this time it's four on one, so Steve had expected to take a couple of licks. He dodges some kind of blunt force weapon – it might be a pipe or a wrench, he doesn't get a good look at it. Only that it's coming straight for his head. He rolls, sweeping a leg out to bring the guy down, and then flips up to bring an elbow into another guy's face, the satisfying crunch of a nose breaking almost drowned out by a grunt of pain.
"That's part of the spell. You'll have a reason to protect Vision. You'll be willing to protect him with your lives, all of you. But knowledge of this reality is too dangerous. If you're there and you know it isn't real, it will weaken the spell. It could lead Thanos right to you – or it could break the spell altogether and bring you back here. It's not enough for you to believe you belong there, in that pocket reality. You have to
"Captain Steve Rogers," Steve continues with a wry smile. "Bucky, Clint and I served together. Long story short, we got out at the same time, needed something to do. So we opened the shop."
Great. They'd spent so much time and energy focused on defending themselves against Thanos, they hadn't stopped to consider the potential for attracting attention from another direction. Stupid.
Finally, he's about eye-level with Steve's erection, straining against the confines of his boxer briefs. Tony can't quite help himself, and he licks at the fabric, sucking the head of Steve's cock into his mouth. Even through the cotton, Tony can feel the solid heat of him. Steve's fingers tighten a little in Tony's hair, but he doesn't pull or push. It's more like he's holding on a little tighter.
Steve and Bucky hang back for a long moment, watching Rhodey hold Tony while Tony shudders and shakes.
But he has to do it, because Rumiko had cared about Stark Resilient so much. Her dream had been for the company to revolutionize the world's energy industry, putting an end to carbon emissions, non-renewable resources, all of it.
“Clint, your left side is wide open!” comes Steve’s voice as one of the little training projections takes a shot at Clint. But Clint is already jumping back, firing a shot, and as another comes up behind, he fires a grappling arrow and immediately climbs out of reach up to a ledge. On the other side of the room, a swarm forms out of seemingly nowhere around Natasha and Sam, launching themselves off the walls to drag Sam down by the wings. Without thinking, Tony shoots forward and grabs Bucky’s raised hand. Bucky is already expecting him and jumps to take hold. Tony flies him right over the walls of debris that separate Natasha and Sam, and drops him on the horde. He goes down shooting, taking out the ones pinning Sam’s wings and landing back to back with Natasha.
"That was Quill," Steve tells them. "Thanos has the soul stone – apparently he got it from someone called the 'In-Betweener' at the Nexus of Reality. It didn't… make a lot of sense."
His stomach growls, and he takes his frustration and hunger out on a rogue slime ball that is trying to crawl its way up the side of a building in an alley. He’s supposed to be down there, eating dinner with Steve and having a lovely evening with the love of his life. Not out here shooting goddamn paintballs at piles of goop
Bucky and Steve step in, but just as the door is about to close, Rhodey bursts through the lobby doors, looking as frantic as Steve feels.
Then Vision is there, taking hold of Steve's arm, and pulling him down the hall. The sea of people parts for them, and they have a straight path to the room at the end of the hall.
“I didn’t think I’d see you again,” Steve admitted. “Considering I was kind of a dick to you last time.”
at you. Every time you opened your damn mouth, every time you smiled, every time you were a stubborn, snarky, infuriating asshole, I wanted you.”
He thinks Yinsen would be okay with him dying this way, too, and he hopes that Yinsen would be proud of what he's done with his life. He didn't waste it. He's fucked a lot of things up, but maybe this will finally balance the scales.
"Oh, don't you even start," Steve huffs and grabs a towel, flicking it at Clint with a snap of his wrist. Clint yelps, and jumps back out of reach, cursing under his breath as the door swings open again.
"There's nothing wrong with the coffee cart coffee," Rhodey gripes. "You're being a coffee snob. Is this one of those places that uses the cat shit coffee? I told you, Tony, I don't care how good it is, I'm not drinking coffee that's already been inside an animal."
"Assuming we win," Tony adds, the reality of what they're up against shattering the momentary joy he'd felt at seeing the wonder that is Shuri's workspace.
Steve knows he’s looking for a laugh, or even to make Steve blush, but Steve’s not going to make it that easy for him.
"Hi Steve!" Casey waves his little hand so hard it looks like it might fly right off. "Daddy says that you're stuck in a snowstorm."
Steve waves him off. They all have the same problems. It's hard enough trying to settle back in after retiring from the service. Harder still to find work, especially work that lets you make time for appointments, therapy, shit days that result from all the trauma. Not to mention the complete lack of work experience outside 'ability to fight and shoot.' Steve, Clint, Bucky, they all get it. They'd all benefited from the services of the VA, and hiring other vets just makes sense, as far as they're concerned. Sam and the rest of the staff run some great programs and workshops geared towards helping vets get out into the civilian workforce, but having places like Brewed Awakening that actively try to hire vets helps a lot.
“Figured that you’ve had a few days to cool off. Thought I might try again. Since apparently I hit a nerve last time I talked to you.”
At that Tony snorts. “You’re probably the only person who would call my workshop ‘inviting,’” he says. Steve doesn’t seems to take offence. He merely shrugs.
She turns and walks away, and Tony glances around the playground, looking for Casey. His chest relaxes as soon as Tony spots him. Glossy, thick hair, darker than his own, hanging down in Casey's face because he's overdue for a haircut. Dark eyes, wide grin, missing tooth. Casey notices Tony watching him, and runs over, crashing into Tony's legs with an 'oof'.
A cold sweat breaks out across his forehead, even as he fires a missile at the pod. Of course, it does nothing, bouncing right off the pod's shields, but it was worth a shot.
Across the table, Steve sighs, glancing at the window. "I don't think that's going to be an option," he says defeatedly, and nods towards the street behind Tony. Tony turns in his chair, and there, sure enough, sliding their way down the road, are half a dozen large, sentient slime blobs. At least, it looks like six. But then two of them join together and the doubled mass makes an incredibly gross noise as it reaches up to shove its slimy face against a second story window. Out on the streets, the pedestrians are fleeing, and the screams carry inside.
"Because I saw you after Siberia, punk. I saw how torn up you were over losin' him. You and I both know you were in love with him long before the Haven."
Strange sighs, and looks at him pointedly. "I told you, Vision was the center of the pocket reality. It was built around him, he was the lynchpin. I have no way of knowing how pulling him out of it so quickly, and so violently, will have impacted him, or what damages it might have inflicted on his mind."
, that if Steve were to wrap his big, solid arms around Tony's torso, it would be the best hug of his entire life.
"How'd you find out we'd crashed anyway?" Tony asks, partly from curiosity, and partly to change the subject.
Whatever feelings he'd been nursing in the back of his mind, whatever hopes and dreams he'd had for a relationship with Steve, he'd killed and buried after Siberia. He'd done everything in his power to move on from that little pipe dream. Steve had betrayed his trust, had run off with Barnes, had beaten Tony and killed his suit.
But the thought of getting into a cold shower, with as cold as he's been all evening, is too awful. He can't bring himself to do it.
"Tony and Steve are blind to what's right in front of them – but fortunately, I have a plan," Natasha informs them.
A shrug of one shoulder. "All the heavy hitters need to be here. As a relatively light hitter, that takes me off the front line."
Tony hoped he wasn't being too melodramatic. He was terrified, though, that they had no idea what horror was coming.
Tony winces visibly. "Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that. I really am. I wasn't trying to suggest anything or, you know –"
“So, what do you want?” Stark asks suddenly, shifting so quickly from humour to serious that it almost gives Steve whiplash.
“Excuse me?” Steve and Coulson say at the same time, staring blankly at Stark. Steve bristles and flicks his gaze to Coulson, but before he can snap back Coulson cuts in.
"Yeah, well, not everyone has your crazy psychic superpowers." Clint waves her off and then pauses. "Wait, is that why you told him that you and I were only going to be friends? 'Cause that seemed like a weird thing to say, but hey, who am I to judge?"
Or maybe Steve would play the virgin, would cry out in surprised arousal as Tony took Steve's whole length into his throat. Would whimper and whine and beg to have Tony fuck him, to open up that sweet, perfectly shaped ass and slide right in, thrust and thrust and just – oh, god – just fuck into Steve's tight body, oh,
To be clear, it isn't the presence of the shop that upset him — far from it. The neighbourhood has an alarming deficit of establishments to get caffeine. It's the
He's saved a second later by his cell phone ringing. A quick glance at the screen shows that it's Rhodey, and Tony pounces at the phone, eager for the distraction.
the graceful fluidity of Tony's movements, the way he talked with his hands. The way his fingers flexed and stretched to underscore his words. And above all, Steve determinedly did not see the way Tony's suit pants hugged the remarkably tempting curve of his ass.
"Don't," Steve says, a little sharper than he intends. He softens his tone. "Don't be sorry. I'm okay, you're okay, you were there, you grounded me, and quickly. That's more help than you can possibly know. We got each other out of it, no harm done."
"Huh," Steve hums thoughtfully. Honestly, it's a great combination. Bucky and Clint had always gotten along, ever since they'd landed in the same squad. Completely inseparable. And they deserve to be happy.
"Oh, holy fuck," Bucky groans. "They're like a little family already. The most aggressively oblivious little family in the world."
“Then what’s it like, huh? It’s fine, Steve, I get it. I’m not easy to be around. It’s probably better this way anyway.”
They finish up their sandwiches in silence, but it's comfortable – like the quiet moments of the car ride had been that morning. Once done, Tony takes the plates and sets them aside on the dresser, and then excuses himself to take a much needed shower.
“Good. Maybe that’ll knock something loose. Can you pull up Barnes’ brain scans? The first set from when he came here, and the most recent. And put the ones the doc sent us of Cap beside it.”
Steve blinks at him, and then the smile that blooms across his face eclipses all the other smiles Tony has seen from him.
He turns to Thor, still there, beside him. His expression is grave as he steps in front of Steve and clutches Steve's bicep in one meaty hand. "Don't worry, Captain. He is gravely injured, yes, but Stark has won the day. And I've met only one man more stubborn than he is." Thor gives him an exaggerated wink, and Steve can't help the ghost of a smile that twitches up one corner of his mouth.
Steve would use his entire body to cover Tony's, maybe use one hand to press Tony's hands down into the mattress above his head. His kisses would be possessive,
"No, you won't," Strange said. "You have to go, but you can't go alone. You need someone there with you, just in case Thanos gets through."
“Oh, so Captain America is a security risk now?” Stark spits. The two start bickering, Stark growing more outspoken and animated, and Coulson not flinching. There’s history there, Steve hazards to guess, but he cuts in, not caring about interrupting them.
Tony spends the bulk of his days in meetings that week — the only positive part of that being that half those meetings are with his best friend from his college days at MIT, who happens to work for him as his government liaison. Since,
“On the ground,” the squad leader demands again to Steve and Tony who are both standing with their hands raised.
children, but this child, the one growing inside her, was precious and perfect and a dream come true.
“I can see you’ve been catching up on all the quality news,” Stark mutters. Steve laughs at that, but it’s hollow and brittle, like the brief moment of comraderie they’d managed to establish had just shattered. Stark winces. “Sorry. I just kicked another landmine.”
Tony doesn't glance at the cash he pulls out of his wallet, putting it down on the counter and taking his cannoli and coffee to sit at a table by the window. It's a complete coincidence that he sits facing the front counter, able to keep his eyes on Steve.
"Good night," Steve says, an almost inaudible whisper. Even in the dark, the sight of Tony's ass, framed and perfect and
"Hear me out, Steve," Tony says, setting his tea down on the coffee table and turning his body slightly so he's facing Steve head-on, one knee curled up beside him on the couch. "I wanna get this out. I don't – I don't do this, I
“My brain scans,” Steve adds. Tony nods again.  Steve considers this for a moment and then asks, “why did I come down here? It felt… right. But I don’t know why.”
"I'm the one that should be thanking you," Steve says. "There is no way that we'd be able to keep up with two locations without more staff. We're stretched too thin this week already. Sooner they can start, the better. I'll call them all this afternoon."
Steve quickly barks something to Okoye, who nods, and they split apart. She rounds up a group of her warriors, and Steve calls orders to each of them, coordinating their assault to hit from all sides for maximum distraction to allow Okoye and her people to catch him unawares. Tony's not convinced it's going to work, but it's the best plan they have. Tony circles just out of reach with Rhodey and Sam, firing off shots in rapid succession. Steve leads the ground team, charging Thanos head on with Clint, Natasha, and Bucky along with him. Tony's heart leaps into his throat as he watches Thanos take a physical swing at Steve, but to his complete and utter amazement, Steve blocks the hit, catching Thanos' fist in both of his hands, holding him physically back, straining with his feet planted firmly on the ground. It's – now really isn't the time for it, but Tony can't stop himself from noticing how unbelievably strong, fierce, and attractive Steve looks.
"No, no, Rhodey just likes to harass me, I'm almost done here," Tony says, interrupting Steve. He fiddles around with the back of the stove for a few more moments, muttering to himself, and then he steps back, running a grimy hand through his hair. It stands up every which way as a result.
Coulson is standing behind Stark, completely unfazed, and despite the fact that Coulson had ‘protested’ to Stark’s presence, there is no doubt in Steve’s mind that this meeting was at the very least sanctioned by Fury, if not set up by him. If Stark truly wasn’t supposed to be here, then he wouldn’t be standing here, staring at him.
Bucky comes out of the back and exchanges a few words with Steve as Steve is placing the baked goods on little plates. Steve heads toward their table, and Bucky starts wiping up the counter.
"Your idea of compromise is you getting your way and us moving?" Steve says flatly. Tony waves him off and pushes on.
"I did, didn't I? Doesn't really seem like it right now though, let me tell you." Tony shakes his head to clear it. "But there's a coffee cart a couple blocks up from
"Mr. Stark. How lovely of you to stop by again," Steve says, pleasant and nonchalant. Tony would absolutely love to wipe that stupid smile off his stupid face, preferably with his own face, but he's got bigger problems to deal with.
Sam is limping when Steve sees him across the field, but Rhodey is there, supporting him, so Steve just waves tiredly and continues walking, searching for more injured that can't make their way to the tents under their own power.
"I was going to in the morning," Tony protests. "I didn't want to worry you since there was nothing you could do until morning anyway. Roads are all closed and there's a blizzard here."
Steve blinks furiously, and tries to figure out what the hell just happened as he takes a step back and stares at Tony in admiration. Tony, on the other hand, is staring at him in horror.
But Thor had stumbled out, bloody and beaten, one eye gone and a patch in its place. His hair was shorn short, and he looked tired and dirty.
Tony was given instructions to meet the kidnappers at midnight. Casey had been picked up from school. Natasha had called the school in the afternoon to find out when Casey had been taken. Julie, Casey's teacher, had told her that Casey's aunt had stopped by to pick him up around eleven. She'd told Julie that Casey's father had been in an accident, and that she needed to pick Casey up. It was serious, they were in a hurry.
"Oh Jesus, this is bad," the girl says, looking for all the world like she wishes the ground would swallow her whole. "Please tell me the Avengers are not out there dealing with this."
It burns through him. It's pain, terror, a roaring chasm of nothingness. It's everything all at once.
"Can I ask you what you want with the owner of this fine, upstanding establishment?" Man-bun asks, mouth twisting.
She doesn't answer before she heads out the door, and Tony turns his full attention back to his son.
"You are very smart," Steve agrees, looking over the pages of carefully written out math problems. He's definitely Tony's son, no doubt about that.
Tony balls his gloved hand into a fist, and the sky swirls with darkness. There's a scream, a howl of pain and rage as Tony points that fist at Thanos, and a beam of light shoots out of his hand. It's like the repulsor beam and yet nothing like it at the same time. The howl of pain is Tony, screaming at the unbearable energy flowing through him, through his fist, aimed right at the Titan.
again. For this all of have been a dream. He wants to wake up where Peggy smiles at him across the dance floor, where Bucky is alive, where he doesn’t have this giant fucking hole in his soul, gaping and festering as the days drag by. He doesn’t want to wander through empty days feeling like a shell of his former self, living in a life that isn’t his, that
Tony looks up at him, eyes searching. "Are you – I mean, I haven't been with anyone since Ru, so I'm, you know, I'm clean, too."
What followed was one of the worst weeks of his life, and given his history, that was saying something.
So he’d followed Tony back to New York. Sam had come along, ostensibly to stay in touch working on the Bucky search, but Steve was pretty sure Sam had been feeling just as adrift as himself. He wasn’t surprised to find Bruce already there, nor was he surprised when Natasha reappeared a few weeks later, Clint in tow.
"It's not fair, I know. But you're gonna have to be the one that props him up for a bit. He's gonna fight you – tooth and nail – but as much as you loved that little boy, for Tony that kid was
By the time he finishes, he's feeling a bit better about things over all, even though he can feel fatigue tugging behind his eyes, and he could definitely use a cup of coffee. He pours himself one, but grimaces at the first sip. His beautiful caffeinated nectar of life, and all its would-be delicious taste is doing is reminding him of this other impending crisis he has yet to solve.
Bucky sits himself down next to Steve, still pressed closed to him. "Hearing that you're okay after being in a fucking
Tony shivers at the desire in Steve's voice, shifting up on his knees so he can push his shorts down.
"Yeah," Tony agrees, reaching out his hand and lacing his fingers with Steve's. His voice is rough, dry. Steve should get him some water, but he's frozen in place, pinned by Tony's intense gaze. "Yeah, we
Once his breathing and heart rate make it back to normal, he turns off the water and reaches out for one of the big, fluffy white towels. Dries himself off, then looks sadly down at his pants and underwear.
Tony and his son are so enamoured with one another that they don't even glance at the coffee shop – a fact for which Steve is glad, because he's still standing there like an idiot, watching as they walk past Steve's shop.
"Lotta kids in this city could stand to be shown some love," Steve sighs. "Must be real hard for them."
The change in track throws Tony for a moment, but he doesn't hesitate to answer. "Three years since Thanos."
Bucky watches him eat in silence for a moment – and possibly with a bit of horror – before he turns away and rolls his eyes, taking a mouthful of his own stew.
"Why don't you tell us, and we'll let you know when it starts ringin' bells," Bucky says, sinking into a loose, easy crouch in front of her chair. He reaches up to brush a stringy lock of hair out of her eyes, and she flinches back. "Start talkin', sweetheart."
Besides, who's to say he could trust a personal chef to be as diligent about Casey's health and nutrition needs as he is?
The door, which had been half-closed, bursts open, and Pepper Potts comes through it. She looks tired, piqued, but her eyes are bright and her strawberry blonde hair is flawless. Her nose is pink, as though she's been crying, and her lips are pressed tightly together.
"Nah, guess not." It's just the two of them, so it's not like they have to worry about disturbing anyone else, but there is something about laying in the dark in the middle of the night that makes hushed voices seem more appropriate – more comfortable. Steve is quiet for a moment, but then speaks up, hesitantly.
Tony leans down and kisses Casey's forehead, then leads Steve out of the room. They hang back in the hallway for a moment, watching Casey's breaths deepen and lengthen.
“So, this sucks,” Tony says cheerfully as the TAC team works on securing the rest of the building. “Not quite how I pictured this evening ending. Mind you, nothing about this is what I pictured, including you being here. You never answered my question about why that was.”
"You guys want anything else? Bucky's telling me I need to take a break, or he's going to kick me out of the shop for a week."
"We're here to see Tony Stark," Bucky says confidently, navigating the world of the very rich better than Steve would have expected. He's not sure he would have been able to do as well.
"He destroyed Xandar," Gamora said, her voice hard but tremulous with emotion. With pain and anger. "So he took the Power stone from the Nova Corps vault. He'd gone to Knowhere and taken the Reality stone already."
"Home and shower?" Tony asks, waggling his eyebrows at Steve once they'd let the police and the officials take over and do their thing.
It starts with a grunt from Rhodey, and then Natasha is on the comms, breathless. "It's an ambush," she says, sounding like she's running. "I've got four hostiles on me."
"I sent the Space stone with Loki, to take it as far as he can," Thor said. Clint had snarled, eyes blazing.
"Well, if we're not running away, and we're not putting Vision front and centre of a fight, what the hell
And, he thinks dazedly as he looks up and glances out the window, time to watch Tony Stark pick up his ridiculously adorable child from the preschool that really
Tony was the first one to treat him normally, and Steve just happened to cling onto that like the desperate, lost puppy he was. It feels like he’s projecting, and the more time that passes since that night, the less real it feels.
. He's the only link Tony has to Rumiko, and he's the most important thing in Tony's entire world. He
"I can't thank you enough," Steve says into the place where Tony's neck meets his shoulder. "Really, Tony, you've saved me so much."
The woman blows out a huff of breath. "Justine Hammer. You remember my dad, don't you, Widow? You ruined his life – and mine."
“I don’t care if you’re Father-fucking-Christmas, you’ll get on the ground so I can clear and secure this site,” He says it in a way that makes it clear that the topic is not up for discussion. Steve quickly takes Tony’s arms and nudges him to the ground. Tony protests, but he goes, and the squad leader waves at one of his people who quickly zip ties their wrists together behind their backs, and then ties both cuffs together so that Steve and Tony find themselves sitting on the ground  sitting back to back, attached at the wrists. It’s not remotely how Steve would have wanted things to go but considering they were caught in the middle of a fight between two groups of hostiles, completely naked and with no ID on them, he should probably count himself lucky that it didn’t end worse.
He doesn't know if he's lying or not, but he hopes he's telling the truth. He'd likely know for sure if he'd kept his comm unit in, but he needed to get to Casey without the distraction.
– then Steve's hand is covering Tony's own, adding pressure and the touch of a foreign hand and Tony can feel it washing over him, like a high wave. An instant of stillness as everything comes into pinpoint focus, and then an explosion of pleasure as he comes, spurting over their joined hands, over Steve's belly and chest.
“And don’t you forget it.” But Steve is right, and they both know it. Even though it means arrows flying through the house, or someone always drinking the last of his coffee, or the fact that having enough issues under one roof they could have their own subscription series is occasionally a recipe for a meltdown disaster, he wouldn’t trade it for the world. For a fleeting moment, he thinks about how Howard would have reacted to any kind of tag in the house, or how Clint’s father would have reacted, (even worse than Howard, he knows.) The thought stirs some lingering resentment deep inside him — present, but nowhere near as powerful these days.
"Dude, I coulda seen you flirting from across the street. That was gross. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Wanda glared mutinously at him, but she looked as though she was going to stop arguing – for the time being.
Tony wrinkles his nose up in mock displeasure, making an offended scoffing noise in the back of his throat.
Yes, Tony. Tony, who thinks his coffee is the best he's ever had. Tony, whose smile lights up an entire room. Tony, who makes him feel alive. Steve shakes his head and reality settles back in. It's cold snow that's burning his hands, not sand. Tony is staring at him, wide eyed and afraid. "Tony, are you okay?" Steve takes Tony's face in his hands and checks him over.
It suits him fine, though, since it means he doesn't have to spend any time talking to politicians, and he
Within a matter of seconds, the training room devolves into a flurry of chaos and colour. Tony parks the suit and steps out just as Natasha throws him a gun of his own and a couple of spare clips. He grabs them, and ducks behind some cover, narrowly avoiding getting hit by the next Hawk-Falcon barrage.
," Clint throws his hands up in exasperation, then deepens the pitch of his voice and affects a ridiculously over-the-top Brooklyn accent that doesn't sound anything like Steve, yet is pretty obviously supposed to sound like Steve. "'Oh, but Tony hasn't been
"Well, I'm glad that's settled," Tony chimes in. "Now you, mister, should be going to bed. It is your bedtime after all."
His erection curves slightly back toward his body, and it's thick, resting proudly against Steve's belly.
Steve nods. "I'm serious. So if security and sketchy kidnappers skulking around is what you're worried about, trust me when I say, we have better security than any other establishment would have. And, we have the best coffee. Just think about how nice it'll be in the autumn to drop your son off to school and get a cup of the best coffee in the city in one stop."
Steve opens his mouth reflexively to argue, but closes it a second later. Because the thing is, he believes Tony. He might not know Tony well, but he’s seen the way that Tony acts around other people. He’s seen the way Tony acts at SHIELD, and how he acts in interviews, and it’s not like this. That Tony is guarded, calculated, and a bit of an asshole. But this Tony, the one who teaches him how to block a punch, who sends him photos of Iron Man dolls in the middle of the night, who takes him for pancakes, that’s not a Tony’s who’s just being nice because he feels bad for someone else. That’s a Tony who’s letting a realer, softer side show. And the other thing is, Steve gets it. He gets having the difference between public and personal image. He understands having to create a face and play the game. Sometimes it’s just to get shit done, and other times it’s necessary to just survive.
"Just my ego," Steve huffs as he tries to untangle himself from the blankets. Tony crouches beside him and offers his hand, and when Steve turns to take it, he can't help but get an eyeful of the half hard-on that is visible under Tony's barely existent underwear. It's just a normal morning erection, it has nothing to do with Steve, but nonetheless Steve's mouth goes dry, and he can feel his heart rate speeding up. It would be so easy to turn his head, lean forward and –
"Wow, it sounds like you've been very good today," Steve pipes up from behind the counter. "Tony, I think that's the kind of behaviour you should reward." Steve's eyes twinkle right into Tony's, a cheeky grin pulling at the corners of his lips. He's probably just managed to ingratiate himself to Casey for life.
Thinking about the school reminds him to check the clock, and he finds it's nearly time for him to make his way over there again to pick Casey up. He quickly sends an e-mail off to the prospective nanny confirming an interview time for the following day — early afternoon, so he has time to bring his new proposal out out to Brooklyn first thing in the morning — and packs up to head out, a small smile on his face and a light bounce in his step as he leaves the building for the day.
Tony talks all through the meal, and long after they’ve both finished, and the longer they’re here, the more comfortable Steve feels, and he joins in more with thoughts and comments of his own until he’s feeling sure enough to speak what’s been on his mind since he arrived.
“Their labs and workshops, they weren’t like this,” Steve says at last, turning his focus to Tony. “They weren’t… inviting.”
It had been a difficult pregnancy. Severe morning sickness, wildly low blood pressure, the whole nine yards. In the end, she began hemorrhaging when she went into labour, and the doctors had to perform a C-section to save the baby.
"Oh, yes, I'm a huge fan," she says, gaze intense on his. "Honestly, I've always thought you and I would get along very well."
"So then why is he avoiding him?" Clint asks. "'Cause I highly doubt Steve would have told him to bugger off. Not even
as perfect as Steve thought it always looked under Tony's clothing. But now, he has first hand knowledge of the flawless skin, the perfect dimples the – oh,
The apartment is fully furnished with all the essentials, but otherwise it’s bare and utilitarian. But it’s all Steve needs.
"Oh look, customers, thank god," Steve says cheerily as the door opens and a couple of people walk in. "You can go help them and leave me in peace to talk with Sam."
"Justine Hammer told us what Haven was when we were interrogating her. Well, as much as she knew," Natasha tells them. "Guess it was enough to bring us back. How did she even find us?"
Bucky rolls his eyes. "I'll tell you when you're older. Nat, that'll work. I'll figure something out. Meet us at the shop tomorrow morning?"
Casey is clearly exhausted from his ordeal, but he's not hurt. He's half asleep but still whimpering from time to time in Tony's arms.
Tony leads Steve out to the living room, taking a quick detour to the kitchen to pick up their tea. He sits on one end of the sofa, watching as Steve takes the other.
that, thank you very much,) when he catches something out of the corner of his eye, whizzing through the air, past the kitchen and into the common space.
Steve flushes a little, but looks pleased as he takes another bite of sandwich. "You know, wasn't always like this," he said casually. "I was really late getting my growth spurt. Most of high school I was about five-five and scrawnier than you'd believe."
"I don't think so," Tony says musingly. He really hadn't thought about what kind of beans Brewed Awakening might be using. "We can ask Steve when we get there."
Tony tilts his head slightly to the side. "Do you still know how to make a good cup of coffee? I feel like this might be a dealbreaker in our relationship."
He can't help the strangled sound that comes out of his throat as Tony crawls into the bed and pulls the blankets up to his waist, effectively hiding the underwear that is causing so many problems with Steve's body.
At least Tony isn't lacking in visitors. Some of them come to drag Steve out of the room for food and hygiene and sleep. Some of them come to watch Tony sleep while sitting in silence with Steve.
insane," Steve agrees. "And they aren't likely to get any less insane whether we have a kid of not. But, imagine how good it would be, too. We could do that. We could make it work. Everything we've done together, as many times as we have saved the world, we can handle fitting a child into our lives. And, we won't be alone, either. We have the others — our family. It's not like we're in this alone."
"Drivin' me around the bend," Bucky says, looking mulish. "He won't stay still. Romanov and I are talking about tyin' him down, but Wilson said he'd probably just fight worse."
"It really is," Steve agrees. "Bucky and I met Clint there, and the two of them bonded instantly. They were inseparable our entire tour. The entire squad became like our family, that's just how it goes. But Clint was something else. So, we were out one day, just doing a patrol around the base and a few surrounding villages. Clint, Bucky, Nicki, and I were in the lead vehicle. We didn't even see the IED until we were on top of it."
When Steve had come limping down the street, face bloodied and swollen and sure to bruise, with Casey held tightly in his arms, Tony had known, then, that Steve isn't just some distraction, some infatuation. That while Tony might still think he's not quite good enough for someone of Steve Rogers' calibre, that Steve Rogers might just fit into their little family, anyway.
He talks to his counsellor about it, and she suggests that maybe he needs to work on giving himself permission to make connections here, that doing so doesn’t mean he’s giving up on what he had before, or make the past any less meaningful.
"Okay, one more question," Tony says. Steve is really, very glad that Tony can't see the way that Steve is grinning to himself. Tony's curiosity is insatiable, no matter the subject. It's one of the many things Steve loves – likes – about him. "Why a coffee shop?"
Steve's face pales, and whatever's going on, it isn't good. "I'll send you our coordinates," he says, and ends the call. All eyes turn to Steve and they wait, breaths held.
Tony is wearing a jock. The front is navy blue, almost mesh so that Steve thinks he can see a hint of the outline of Tony's genitals, and then the back is – the back is just strips of elasticized fabric across the waist and around the thighs and
“I don’t suppose, you’d let me try and take you out again?” Tony asks, listening to the steady sound of Steve’s heartbeat.
should have done a better job keeping him safe. It's not your fault, and it's not my fault. Tony's gonna decide it's his fault, but it's not. You know whose fault it is? Whoever took Casey. That's who. Our job now? Find the son of a bitch and put 'em in the ground."
They chat idly a few minutes more before Tony ends the call. He's just starting to feel a little more at ease when he hears splashing coming from the bathroom, followed by grunts and hushed cursing. Tony immediately springs to his feet and darts into the bathroom in time to find Steve half leveraging himself out of the tub with just his arms. He looks so much like an awkward, forlorn seal flopping around that Tony can't help the sharp burst of laughter.
"Well, if we can't send him away and we can't keep him here, what's left? What, are we going to send him to an alternate reality where Thanos doesn't even exist? Boom, problem solved?"
Tony sighs and rolls over so he can sit up. "It's with that German rep for the energy project. He wanted to meet last night. But if I had, I wouldn't have seen you until after you got home and were probably asleep."
At some point, Steve dozes in the chair beside Tony's bed. He wakes up with the realization that he's not alone in the room.
"We will be, but you are staying right here," Tony demands. "You're what he's after, and we still have no idea what kind of effect snapping back to reality might have had on you. You're safer here. Stay put."
He'll admit to himself that he'd thought Tony was a good-looking guy. He'll even admit to himself that he'd been thinking more about Tony's rear than he should have.
They've got Bucky's gun locker, several take out containers of Chinese food, and a sturdy-looking plastic case.
The slime monsters are approaching the restaurant now, still flinging droplets of gunk as they move. Somehow, that doesn't seem to be diminishing their mass at all. Tony doesn't even want to think about how that's working. Beside him, Steve is studying the one closest to them as it slides around, and then, in lieu of his shield – which is safely tucked up at home – he takes an empty plate he snagged from the restaurant and flings it at the creature like a Frisbee. He doesn't even look fazed when the creature just absorbs it and keeps on glopping around.
“You… can’t actually be serious,” Steve says, but Stark is already making his way to the mats and kicking off his shoes. Steve follows helplessly.
get to spend time talking to James Rhodes. He's overqualified for the liaison position, but he spends the rest of his time in R&D putting his aerospace engineering degree to good use.
“Tony Stark, I assume,” he replied, attempting to keep himself composed and implacable. He’s pretty sure he fails.
"I know, I know," Steve laughs, waving him off. "I'm trying to give you a hard time, and clearly it's working. But, for the record, we have zero tolerance for any harassment or discrimination here. I'll throw you out myself." He flexes his arm jokingly to prove his point.
"Tones, god, I'm so sorry," Rhodey mutters as Tony sinks against him. Tony turns his face to hide it against Rhodey's chest as he feels hot tears prickle at his eyes.
"Yes," Strange informs him. "Which at least gives us a place to start. But we need to move fast. There is a good chance he's injured."
, that they're back home, he feels an ache in his chest, like the glass shards of a broken heart pressing angrily into his sternum. Whatever had happened in Haven was nothing.
The third finger is a bit much at first, but Steve eases it in carefully, giving Tony lots of time to adjust. Ordinarily, Tony doesn't think he'd need the third finger, but it's been so long since he's been with a man, and Steve's cock really is on the large side.
"Nah, see, that's what you think. There's no doubt in the room when you're going out of your way to turn up the charisma and the charm. When you're making a point of
Strange stands and moves toward the portal, waving one hand behind himself. Tony's prone body floats into the air and follows Strange through the portal into the palace's hospital, and Steve watches, despondent, as it closes.
were going to die? The first time I saw your ass, I knew it was the most perfect thing I was ever going to see," he laughs, running his hands through Tony's hair. "And then you were wearing that goddamned
"He likes my coffee." Clint and Bucky both stare at him. "And the cannoli. That's it. He's just a nice person who's a regular at the shop."
But there's nothing easy about the horror dawning on him as he blinks himself to full consciousness.
“The research is great, might be the primary focus now, but the reason it all started was that he wanted to find you. Bring you home and all that jazz.”
“You’re an idiot,” Tony tells him. And here it comes. “You’re such a goddamn idiot and I don’t even know what to do with you, Rogers. Where the hell did you get it into your head that I couldn’t stand to be around you?”
As soon as Natasha walks in, Clint is making up her tea without prompting. She takes it gratefully, and steps behind the counter to stand with them. The shop is quiet, and neither of them are going to tell her no.
Sensing that their warlord is in trouble, the swarm turns their attention away from the crusade towards the palace to find the stone, and towards the more immediate threat. Steve, on his feet again, calls the order to stand against the onslaught. Thor has enough on his plate clashing with Thanos. Thor doesn't have to kill him, just wound or distract him enough that they can get the gauntlet away. Tony turns his attention to the swarm, and starts firing. He can buy Thor some time.
"So, uh, how're you doing?" Steve asks, trying to steer his mind back on track. Beside him, Bucky is suddenly tense, and a shadow has fallen over his face. Clint instinctually shifts closer to him, even as he's still chatting up Tony's friend.
“Well, this is you,” Tony says, coming to a stop. “This was fun, we should do it again some time.” He gives Steve a jaunty wave goodbye and turns to leave.
"Okay, but this one, there's lots of space, great natural light, it's just on the other side of the Stark Resilient building, close to a main intersection so lots of foot traffic."
"Why are we letting the Wizard of Odd call the shots here, anyway?" Sam asked, crossing his arms in front of his chest. Steve shot him a glance, but Tony couldn't read it. He blamed the beard.
an aura. There's no empty bed where he would have materialized had he come back with them the way they'd all gone in. Tony doesn't know how it works because it's
When he’d been sitting in the ruins of that blown out bar, stone cold sober and two thirds of the way through a bottle of whisky the night that Bucky had died, he didn’t think it was possible to feel any worse. Certainly not and still live. How could a human possibly bear any more grief and not be crushed under the weight of it?
"I am. She'd prefer to meet in person to discuss terms and sign the contract. We should get it done sooner rather than later."
“He’s at a liaison meeting with the European Union,” Sam reminds him. Tony waves his hand dismissively.
Steve finds him one night in the kitchen, up late, pouring himself another cup of coffee. Before he can drink it though, Steve takes the cup from his hands and offers him a cup of hot chocolate instead. Tony takes the cup and sips carefully. It tastes exactly how it’s supposed to. Steve heads out to the balcony, and Tony follows behind without saying anything.  For a moment, they stand together, staring out over the city.
“What did you mean when you said it was SI funding that led to finding me?” He asks, cutting through all the preamble. He really just doesn’t have the patience for it.
"No, I'm serious, he's all – he's just nice because I'm a good customer, and I fixed his oven that time. He has to be nice to me."
“Okay, fine. So this is exactly what it looks like. Or, wait. Maybe I just wanted to come and talk to you?”
"Okay, first of all," Tony says, flipping up his faceplate so they can talk face to face, "normally I would tell you to stuff the apology, but, I was just sitting down to a date which got interrupted by all this –" he waves his hand around "– so, instead I'll say thank you. Apology accepted."
“Technically, it’s your fault. You’re the one who suggested we should all live together,” Steve points out.
"But Pepper, Steve is flying in tonight," Tony whines. "If I have to go to this stupid dinner meeting, I'm not going to be able to be at the airport to meet him. I was going to bring him flowers. And surprise him."
The streets are quiet. It's nearing midnight, but it's still New York, so it's eerie. Steve isn't used to any deserted streets in New York.
He slides to the floor and curls into himself, pressing his face to his knees, trying to make himself as small as he can as his entire body shakes with the sobs that are now ripping through him uncontrollably. He can’t deal with this, with feeling this way all the fucking time. He just can’t. What he wants, what he actually wants is just to wake up and be
Steve nods, and can't quite suppress the 'I told you so' grin. "A few of them have already asked about doing book clubs and social gatherings here on the weekends when there's programming running at the school. And someone asked about catering for school events when things start back up in the fall. Which, by the way, I would be happy to do."
"Seriously, Tony," Steve says, at a loss of what to do or say now as Tony shrugs back into his suit jacket, oblivious to the smudges of dirt and grease on his hands, face and shirt. He slips the phone in his pocket without reading the texts, and picks up the to-go cup of coffee as he moves toward the kitchen doors. Steve keeps going. "I mean it. You saved my life, here. I can't – if there's ever anything I can do for you, tell me, okay?
"Careful, there's a group of three trying to make a break for it down the alley to the west," Natasha calls.
"Guys? We've got incoming. Again!" Rhodey calls over the comms. Sure enough, there is a pod hurtling towards the earth, and there is no doubt in Tony's mind who's inside. Their destruction. Their end.
Years of indiscriminate casual sex with both men and women had ended the moment he'd met Rumiko. Rumiko had been the daughter of a business magnate in Japan, and she had, inexplicably, fallen as madly in love with Tony as he had with her. He quit drinking, quit doing drugs, quit partying. In short, he got his shit together.
Steve could swear it's like Christmas come early. Inside the case, nestled into its foam liner, are a dozen long-range comm units.
It seems ridiculous that the confusion and chaos and rush out in the hall could give way to this quiet, private room at the end. The lights are dimmed, and there are no windows here. There is a white bed against one wall, surrounded by monitors and IV poles and medical equipment. The equipment is all attached to a figure in the bed – a man who is only slightly smaller than Steve in practice, but right now looks tiny. His eyes are closed. There's a ventilator making soft whooshing noises beside him, a tube down his throat. His eyelids have been taped shut, and a large patch of hair has been shaved on the side of his head. There's gauze wrapped there, but it's wrapped loosely.
"You saying that scrappy is a part of who I am?" Steve cocks his eyebrow. Tony resolutely manages not to lean over and kiss him.
"Stay sharp," Steve says, knowing he doesn't need to say it. Clint is always sharp, even when he looks like he's napping at the desk in the office in the shop, feet up and hat over his eyes.
"Yeah," Tony says, glancing down at Steve's leg. "Except you're hurt. Because I'm a selfish idiot who pressed through a storm. Like an idiot."
"We should celebrate a successful first week tomorrow. Dinner and drinks with the crew after the shops close," Steve suggests.
They'd set Tony's comm unit to pick up long-range sound as well as close, so they can hear the woman's response.
True to her word, Natasha wanders into the Manhattan shop the next morning while Clint is piling fresh baked goods into the case. It's actually been nice that he and Bucky have had a chance to spend more time in the Manhattan shop, now that the new hires are comfortable enough to work without them around in Brooklyn. It's good to get to know the new building, and, as great as having a second location is, he's missed working together, all three of them, like the old days.
"Yeah, okay. Fair point," Steve concedes. "But we agreed, not your fault either. Just an accident that happened."
"He hasn't been into the shop since the day they went on that trip. Did something happen? Does he all of sudden just, not like Steve or something? I mean, I wouldn't believe that for a second, but honestly, I don't know what else to think right now."
"Where – I've never been there," Steve says, the reality of that hitting him square in the face. The feelings he's been denying about Tony, the love he has for Casey, and he still doesn't even know where they live? How could he be so self-centered?
"So what I'm saying is that if you want to have a hope in hell of making something work with Tony, you're going to have to get through that
After a moment's hesitation, Steve flicks at the screen and answers the call. Instead of turning it to speaker phone, he holds the phone up to Tony's ear as Tony works, and is rewarded with a grateful, if slightly distracted look.
"That would put the Mind stone alongside the Soul stone, or at the very least lead Thanos right to wherever it's hidden," said Wong.
Sam had been a big help with that, even if he'd deny it. Steve had been damned lucky to make friends with him – and then more or less force Bucky and Clint into doing the same.
For a moment, he almost feels like he's gone too far. He wouldn't have said that, before. Before the Haven, things had been raw and dark and strained. Everything had hurt. But the Haven, those eight months stuffed into two weeks, had been a healing balm for Steve's soul, for his relationships with his friends. Yes, it had ended abruptly, and his heart is still broken at the loss of Casey, at the loss of what he'd begun to have with Tony. But still – that had been a world of laughter, of joy, of
Steve's eyelashes are fluttering and his chest is heaving, but he's still holding Tony's gaze, and Tony can see his own emotions mirrored back to him.
"I'm not, it's nothing like that," Tony says quickly. "Look, it was great seeing you, but now isn't a good time. I –"
chair, which he's been sitting on for probably close to 24 hours – and gestures to it. She gives him a long look before she takes the chair.
Bucky fills him in on a few of the others before he leaves. Steve only feels a little bit guilty about how relieved he is that none of his friends – the people he's closest to – had been killed in the attack. There are people dead, and he mourns for them, but anyone he'd met before two days ago is still alive and well.
"Excuse me?" Tony says, horrified realisation dawning across his face. "What do you mean we're not getting back there tonight?"
"Wow. I can't believe I'm meeting Tony Stark," she gushes. "I'm such a fan of what you've been doing with the StarkPhone lately."
Clint snorted, and just when it seemed everything was about to devolve into name-calling and hair-pulling, Strange stood, silencing them.
." Clint shakes his head. "We were busy in Manhattan, and the cannoli were selling like mad. I don't know what was going on, but like, it was Cannoli-For-Everyone free for all or something. But, whatever, I thought it was fine, because that means people like the cannoli. But then Steve walks past the display case, and sees that we're down to the last one. I swear he nearly tripped over himself trying to get it out of the case as fast as possible to tuck it away. And do you want to know
Natasha sneaks a glance at Bucky, who's looking at her questioningly. She lets her left shoulder twitch up in a shrug to indicate that she doesn't know what Hammer is talking about.
Buried deeply by grief, Tony had wanted to die, too. He'd wanted the earth to swallow him whole, wanted to trade the infant for his wife, had blamed himself for carelessly getting her pregnant in the first place. He'd been angry, so angry, and then he'd seen the baby,, and he had looked down into the face of his son,
"Clothes, and a ride home. You know, I'm pretty sure this is not the first time I've had to do this for you," Rhodey teased.
"I'll bring 'em out to you at a table if you want," Steve says. Tony smiles again and picks up their drinks, leading Casey over to a table by the window so they can people-watch pedestrians. Casey kneels on his chair, practically leaning over the table to sip at his lemonade, chattering excitedly.
you. I don't know! They used a voice scrambler. They said they had Casey, and they said they'd kill him if I didn't 'give it to them,' or if I called the police. Give
"Called the local tow truck company. They'll be out working all night but they should be able to get to you in the morning. Made you boys some sandwiches. The kitchen is closed, sent the staff home when we saw the weather report. It's not much but it's better than nothing." He holds out a couple of plates stacked high with sandwiches, that at this point look like the most delicious things Steve had ever seen. "Also got the keys to your room. We're booked up solid, again cause of the weather. All I've got left is the honeymoon suite."
Once they're back in the city, Steve tries to convince Rhodey to just drop him off at the shop where Bucky and Clint are, but neither Rhodey nor Tony are having it. They both insist that yes, they will take him to the shop – by way of the hospital first. They insist on waiting with him, even though Steve insists it's not necessary. Rhodey just gives him this dreadfully unimpressed look that seems to say that he doesn't actually believe Steve will stay put if they turn their backs. He's going to go out on a limb here and assume that that was probably developed after years of Rhodey having to deal with Tony. Luckily, the hospital is blessedly quick, and after some X-rays and an exam, Steve is sent on his way with some slightly stronger painkillers, crutches, a brace, and a recommendation for physiotherapy just to help things along. Steve sighs to himself as he slips the crutches under his arms. His old physiotherapist still works with the VA, but she isn't going to be thrilled to see him again under these circumstances.
Well, he can’t exactly argue with that. Natasha has a point — he really is the best fit for this part of the operation. Her lead is solid, and the sooner they wrapped things up, the better. One less head to chase down in the aftermath of DC that had left their entire support network in ruin, and HYDRA scattering in all directions, armed with all the SHIELD intel, tech, specs, weaponry, everything they could get their hands on. While HYDRA hadn’t exactly won the day, they hadn’t exactly lost either. What remained of SHIELD had prevented total catastrophe, but HYDRA had had the advantage of already being mobilized, already having a plan. So when they went to ground, they took a lot of valuable assets with them.
“But. I don’t want you to feel obligated to spend time with me. Or feel like I’m some kind of responsibility. It’s okay, really.”
“Well now, I’m glad you finally brought a friend along,” she says to Tony, while looking at Steve. “What can I get for you, hon?”
"Oh, shit, Steve, I shouldn't – oh, god, you're hurt, shit, I'll –" he moves to get up off Steve's lap, but Steve's hands grasp at his hips, holding Tony there.
It's only Rhodey subtly placing his hand on the back of Tony's elbow that keeps him from punching Strange in the face.
Tony pulls out his phone, looks at it, and swears. "Fucking fuck. How is there no signal? What good is a phone with no signal? I swear to god, as soon as we're out of this I'm going to make something better. Fucking middle of nowhere, fucking blizzard messing with my reception."
"Hey, it's okay. Sorry I've been too wrapped up in my own world to see what was right in front of me."
“Steve is a jerk,” Tony mutters, glaring mutinously at the drawing but fighting to keep the corner of his mouth from twitching up.
"Come on," Tony says, and crouches down. Together, they manage to get Steve out of the tub without too much trouble and without him having to put any weight on his bad knee, and get him wrapped up in a towel to dry off. Steve carefully slides his boxers back on, and continues to accept Tony's offer of help to make his way back across the room to the bed. Steve pauses at the foot of it and stares, as if realising for the first time that there is, in fact, only one bed.
“You’re so tense,” she purrs, bringing a finger up to his jaw and running a thumb across his lip. “And you seem so distracted, handsome. Come on, tell me what’s on your mind. I’ll take good care of you.” She rolls her hips against his to emphasise the point.
"You make me glad that I never had siblings," he looks back at Vision, the mind stone pulsing gently in his forehead. "He'd better be okay."
Tony flashes a quick smile, and pulls Rhodey into a hug, ignoring that they're both a little sweaty and hot from their walk. "Thanks, Rhodey."
"Well, it's not really the kind of thing we want in that neighbourhood," Tony tells him. "You understand."
Rhodey stops walking, and it takes a few moments for Tony to realize he's no longer keeping up. He turns, and instantly regrets it.
But that optimism is short lived. They've taken down wave after wave of the creatures, but it hardly looks like they've made a dent. More and more keep swarming in, forcing them to respond at a punishing pace that they aren't going to be able to keep up with for long. The Masters, or whatever those things in charge are, stride across the field as if they're taking a Sunday afternoon stroll in the park, all of them heading straight to where Vision is fighting alongside Wanda. It's as if they're drawn to the stone, which they probably are, considering the ease with which they pinpointed the stone's location in the first place. But Tony isn't going to let them have it.
"Oh, you do, do you?" Tony grins back. He sighs, and glances at the case. Casey's not a picky eater, but most of the fare in the pastry case is geared toward adults.
A waitress comes by a moment later, her short skirt and top only barely covering her, eyes and face covered in smokey makeup.  She smiles at Steve, batting her eyelashes coquettishly.
As he walks toward the office, he already has his phone out, searching for more information on Brewed Awakening. He's going to find a way to nip this whole thing in the bud.
"Right, then." A moment later, Tony is worming his way up under Steve's right side, and Steve slides his arm around Tony's shoulders. "Come on, soldier."
Tony moves fluidly, confidently, like he does everything. He walks around the bed and goes to slide in on the other side.
"Tony is the same," Natasha speaks up. "I haven't talked to him much about it, but Rhodey has. And Tony is just as scared to get involved with Steve, for his own reasons."
Tony had told Steve he and Pepper weren't together anymore, but what if she still has feelings for him? What if she's realized she wants to come back to him? If anyone has a claim on Tony, surely it's Pepper?
And then Steve watches in absolute horror as Tony retracts his armour's gauntlet, frees his hand and slips it into the glove.
"Hey, I'm not –" Strange doesn't have a chance to finish – which is probably for the best because Tony is not having any of it right now – as Steve's communicator goes off; a sharp, startling alarm that makes Tony's heart leap into his throat.
"But – but it'll make the bed wet." Steve's not trying to be inappropriate here, he really isn't. It's just – he knows Tony's clothes are still wet and dirty from the snow they'd slogged through to get here. If he crawls into the bed like that, he'll catch a cold. "You'll get sick."
"Yeah, I know. Thought about just telling you we were stuck because of the weather. But I knew you'd be more pissed if you found out after the fact about the rest."
Steve reaches over and takes the keys. "Thank you for your hospitality. Honestly, we really appreciate everything."
"Then I'll go, too," Steve announced, jaw set, eyes glittering with steel. Tony stared at him, his own jaw slack.
"Nope," Tony assures him. "Seems like all the evil geniuses and grad students bordering on ‘mad scientist’ managed to keep it together while you were gone. Turns out the biggest menace was the domestic threat of Clint and his damned paintballs."
"It never is," Steve says. They don't talk for a while, and then Sam gets up and leaves the room, squeezing Steve's shoulder as he goes.
Clint strides into the office. Enough is enough. They need to deal with this shit because seriously, he can't take it anymore. Bucky is sitting at the desk, tallying up something or other and inputting numbers into the complicated-looking spreadsheets that are up on the laptop screen. Clint walks up to the desk, slaps his hands down on the surface, and stares at Bucky directly in the eye.
Bruce had gotten a brief moment with Natasha, Vision and Wanda had been whispering in a corner, and Sam and Rhodey had chatted idly. Like old friends. Like nothing had happened. Clint had watched them all while Bucky had stood beside Steve like a sentry.
"Steve? Are you alright?" Tony scrambles to his side, heedless of the fact that he is kneeling in the snow and it's soaking through his jeans.
The warmth of the lobby is quite possibly the most incredible thing Steve has ever experienced in his life, and he openly sighs in relief. The late-middle-aged man with a greying beard who'd exclaimed their arrival hurried out from behind the front desk and over to them. "You okay there, son? Here, grab a chair." Steve sinks gratefully into the plush chair, and tries very hard not to move his knee.
At that moment, Bucky makes a very obvious point of checking his phone, and then cheers. "Hey, great news!"
“You can take me out, definitely,” Steve assures him. “But just so you know, I’m already yours, even when I don’t remember.”
“Fancy meeting you here,” Steve says as he eyes Tony standing beside him, as naked as he is.  Tony very obviously eyes him back. Unlike Steve, Tony doesn’t appear to make any effort to keep his eyes above Steve’s neck.
into Steve's retinas, and he knows he'll be seeing that in his mind every time he closes his eyes. The way that jock had framed Tony's ass, put it right on display as though to fulfill all of Steve's dark fantasies.
"I don't – I don't know what to do. Shit. How did this happen? Fuck, Steve, I did everything. Everything I could to keep him safe."
It's Steve's turn to take a steadying breath before he replies. "Yeah," he confirms. "The last mission we were on. Except it wasn't even a mission. Just a routine patrol. It was supposed to be a break from all the missions we'd been running."
That night, Steve expects to dream of the crash. He expects to dream of dragging himself out of the remains of a vehicle, of desperately searching for Bucky, or Tony. But his subconscious decides against being straightforward. Instead, he dreams he's in a plane, hurtling towards the earth, everything around him cold and white. The dream shifts, and he's walking through New York, except there's something off about it, something he can't quite place. But it doesn't feel like
"Oh – my god," Tony manages to get out between fits. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh, I know, but. I'm sorry, that was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen." Tony's eyes are shining, and through the mortification Steve is feeling, he manages to crack a smile of his own. It probably did look ridiculous from where Tony was sitting, and the carefree, pure joy on Tony's face would be worth any amount of embarrassment. "Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?" Tony asks as he rolls to his feet and hurries off to Steve's side of the bed to help him up.
"No!" howls Tony, and Steve runs faster, he doesn't even know where he's going, but it doesn't matter. He'll find Casey – he has to.
She immediately complies, and the suit deconstructs itself, flowing off Tony's limbs and head, then off his torso and disappears into the new arc reactor – no, he'd called it a nano housing this time, it's not the same thing – in his chest.
Beside him, Tony draws in a deep breath, and for a moment Steve thinks that Tony isn't going to answer. Steve's about to cut back in and tell him to forget about it, that it's none of his business, when Tony speaks.
“So,” Stark says, studying him so intently it feels like he’s boring holes inside Steve’s soul. “You’re the guy my dad never shut up about.”
"Fine, you caught me," Steve says, leaning up and pressing a peck of a kiss to the tip of Tony's nose.
"Gods, no," Thor laughs, letting the sound boom through the air around them. "I mean Phillip Coulson."
"Pepper. Pepper, please. Light of my life," Tony pleads over the phone the next day. "Can I just not?"
“Steve. Trust me. I’m not doing this because I feel obligated, or because I feel sorry for you. That’s not my speed. If I didn’t want to be here, I wouldn’t be.”
He's not been having the best week, maybe. He mostly has his PTSD managed, especially with Sam's help, but some days are better than others, and sometimes when everything falls apart at once, he struggles.
"Fuck, yes, just – come on, honey, let me –" Tony shifts up on his knees, letting Steve's fingers slide out of him reluctantly. He grabs the lube from beside Steve's head, pours a little into his hand and wraps it around Steve's dick as he pushes Steve to lie on his back again.
"Uh… I really don't. Buck, you got the counter for a sec?" Hunka-Stevie turns to Man-bun, but he's already untying his apron from around his waist as he speaks. Man-bun rolls his eyes and mutters under his breath.
Steve keeps his arms around Tony, but he pulls back slightly, tipping his head down to meet Tony's eyes.
He finally strips his clothes off, taking his underwear – his stupid, ridiculous, embarrassing underwear – with them. He opens the shower door and turns the taps on, considers turning the water cold to deal with his unwanted desire.
Shuri grins. "I'm going to make the most annoying AI, put it in a tiny robot, and make it follow T'Challa around the palace all day long."
Tony keens, thrusts down and jerks himself off, hand stroking hard and fast over his own erection because he's close, he's so close, he just needs –
Tony shrugs. "Like I said, figured it out by accident. It could have been any number of chemicals in the fluid, I was just really hoping it was that one, and we got lucky and it was."
"You can be here 10 minutes ago when this meeting was supposed to start." Steve can hear Rhodey clearly through the phone, as close as he is to it. "You could be here on time, even just once, ever."
"God, Tony, I can't –" Steve breaks off, the tendons in his neck straining. His fingers are like clamps on Tony's hips, holding him still as Steve works in him, leveraging himself with his feet planted on the bed.
Before he gets a chance to say anything further, the elevator opens into a wide, empty hallway. There's a door across the hall, and Rhodey strides over to it and places his hand flat on some kind of biometric scanner. The door slides open after a moment.
Steve doesn’t remember him. More accurately, Steve doesn’t remember any of them, or anything before his kidnapping. But right now, Tony is selfishly only concerned over the fact that Steve doesn’t remember him. Steve doesn’t remember
He feels even bigger than he looks, and Tony's legs are trembling by the time he makes it all the way down, gets Steve's cock seated all the way inside him.
New York. It's unsettling. The dream shifts again, and he's laying in a warm, soft bed. Someone shifts beside him – Tony, his mind supplies. This is a much nicer dream. He shifts in bed and turns towards Tony, towards the warmth and the comfort. He leans towards a Tony he can only just see through half closed eyes and goes for a sleepy kiss. But in the moment before their lips touch, Steve's brain wakes up fully, and reality slaps him in the face. Shit. This isn't a dream. He
“You thought I didn’t want you?’ Tony said, his voice raw. “Steve, I’ve wanted you so fucking much it hurt to
"You know witchcraft," Tony corrects. "I swear to god this is the best fucking coffee I have ever had in my life and I need more of it in my face."
Casey looks up, eyes wide, and points at the case like he's just discovered the centre of the universe. "Peanut butter monster cookies, Daddy."
They eat without speaking for a while. Once Steve has demolished one bowl of the flavourful dish, he spoons himself out another, then takes it to the sofa to eat. Bucky follows him more leisurely, sitting across from him.
Not that he cares. He doesn't have time for a crush on the coffee guy. Also, he doesn't have a crush. He'd have to be
It's mid afternoon the following day, and Steve is absently wiping down the counter. Clint has a batch of cranberry white chocolate cookies in the oven, and they smell amazing. Casey would love them, Steve thinks sadly to himself. Too bad that Casey probably won't be in to try one. Maybe he can get Natasha to bring him one, so at least he can still enjoy 'the best cookies in the world.'
And yet, despite all that, Steve knows deep in his heart that the love he'd fallen into in the Haven is just as real today. Had been real before they'd gone, even. Before the Accords, before all of it, Steve had loved him. He hadn't always known it, but he does now.
"I'm not saying anything," she laughs. Steve rolls his eyes and heads back into the kitchen before she can change her mind about it.
Steve reaches over and sets his hand gently on Tony's arm. "He's not alone, Tony. Nat's with him, remember? She'll stay with him for the night. And if she can't for whatever reason, then Clint and Bucky can."
Bucky and Steve walk as nonchalantly as they can, not talking. Steve knows it would be less conspicuous if they pretended to carry on some sort of conversation, but he needs to concentrate – he has to listen in on the comms to make sure nothing goes wrong with Clint's team, and he has to keep an eye out for anyone that might be suspicious or out of place. And, most importantly, he has to watch for any clues that might tell them which building Casey might be in.
"Well," Tony says, reaching over to pull the cord on the lamp on his side of the bed. "Guess we should get some sleep."
As he makes his way along the streets towards the address that Tony sent him, Steve wonders briefly just what the hell he’s doing. The answer is, of course, that he’s clinging to some modicum of human interaction and kindness, because the reality is that sitting alone in his apartment wishing that he’d died is… not good. It’s not going to end well for him. Even he knows that.
"Where's Vision?" Rhodey asks. It's the first Tony realizes that Vision isn't there with them. He instantly feels guilty about it – technically, Vision had been Casey in the Haven. He's been so rocked by the loss of the little boy that the one piece of him left hadn't even crossed Tony's mind.
"It probably has, but it's fun how those things can flare up when the weather starts playing the human version of kick the can. Can you walk?"
"Right!" Tony says, knowing he's lost the high ground. "So, I mean, preschoolers don't drink coffee, and there's basically nothing else there that –"
Sandi gently rests a hand on Steve's arm and turns to Tony. "We really appreciate it, Tony. It's kind of been a rocky week, and you gave us a win that we needed. Just take the damned coffee, with our thanks."
"What does that mean?" Steve asks, knowing he's talking too quietly to be heard. The deafening roar of triumphant cheering from all around them drowns out his voice entirely.
Because Tony had spent the better part of his day looking into the city's zoning office and one ridiculously-named coffee shop, he hadn't done much actual work for Stark Resilient. He ignores it as long as he can; he plays with Casey, makes dinner – he's not a great cook, but the food he makes them is nutritious and edible, and most days Casey doesn't even whine and ask for Mac N' Cheese. He could certainly afford a personal chef to do the meal preparation for them, but he thinks Ru would have wanted him to do the cooking, if she couldn't do it herself. Hiring a chef just seemed too impersonal.
Ten hours of close quarters, one-on-one interaction, and the car full of the scent of Tony – vanilla, spice, coffee and a hint of motor oil. Ten hours where he's going to have to try not to make an ass of himself, or let it slip how he feels.
"I figured we could compromise, so I did some research, and I think I've found a couple of other locations nearby in the neighbourhood that would be great."
current idea, the one that had left him clinging to bed sheets, dangling from a second story window, yelping as he lost his footing. Above him, Steve poked his head out of the window and called down, “You sure this is the easiest way out of the mansion?”
Natasha strides in behind him, and perches herself on the edge of the desk, arms folded across her chest.
"How long have we been under?" Bucky asks, glancing around the room. His eyes keep tracking in Steve's direction, but Tony refuses to take the bait.
It's nine in the evening by now. They've spent the last few hours planning. Bucky and Clint headed home to collect their service weapons, as well as Steve's. Natasha shakes her head that no, she doesn't need one. Sam takes the offer of an extra from Bucky's (rather impressive) gun locker, as does Rhodey.
Tony Stark," Rhodes says. "Your name is on the building, on all the business cards. They wanted to talk to
He knows who the boy is. They haven't met officially, and Steve hasn't seen him out of his mask, but he recognizes the voice and there's only one teenage boy that would be visiting Tony Stark in a hospital room. Plus, they're in Wakanda, and there are only so many non-Wakandans here.
Pepper sighs again, but he can hear the smile in her voice. "You do realise this means you need to be up and functional, and presentable for a 7:30 am meeting. You cannot be late. I don't care how cozy bed is, or how cute Steve looks when he's half asleep. You. Must. Be there."
Tony has seen Thor fight before, countless times – but never like this. Tony's not sure what happened to Thor in the time since they've last seen each other, but whatever it is, Thor's come out of it fighting with unfathomable intensity and power. He's the only one of them that really really stands a chance against Thanos one on one.
He doesn't get a chance to finish his thought. Frantic footsteps pound through the hall, and someone – Gamora, he realises – flies into their line of sight, wide eyed and fearful. "They're here."
Tony groans, then does as he's told, shifting around until he and Steve are laying side by side on the bed, facing one another but head to toe. He keeps his lips wrapped around Steve's cock the whole time, and the second his own groin is within reach, Steve takes Tony into his mouth and sucks him in deep.
Tony turns his head and shoves it into the pillow next to him, wishing, for once, that he could just shut his damned brain off. Or shut his feelings off. Or possibly both. Both would be nice.
T'Challa orders a section opened to funnel the swarm coming in. A second later, all hell breaks loose on the inside of the dome, and instinct takes over. It's been months since he's fought with the Avengers, but Tony's body remembers. He knows without looking exactly where in the sky Sam will be. He knows with one call of his name where Steve needs him to be to lay down cover fire. He knows without having to think about it that Steve has his back. It's exhilarating and heartbreaking all at once.
," Bucky says, staring hard at Steve, "that you're just doing the order, and not remotely hiding out or moping at all."
"You're both ridiculous," Rhodey says, exasperated as he stands up from the table, tossing back the last of his coffee with a deep swallow. "You deserve each other."
"I hate everything," Tony whines as he reluctantly climbs out of bed and stretches. "Tonight. You, me, dinner date. And clear schedules tomorrow."
"He's been busy," Steve says. "He's got a major project on the go with the DoD, they have deadlines coming up. He doesn't have time to be hanging around here."
"Where's my son?" Tony asks, and Steve can see the scene in his mind's eye. The woman standing there, and Tony approaching her slowly. Cautiously, Steve hopes.
Finally, Tony tears himself away. Casey is the most precious thing he's ever known, and without Steve, Tony's not sure he would have him back now.
“Agent said I could find you here, probably,” Stark informs him. Coulson, Steve guesses. Stark seems to always call Coulson ‘Agent’. Never Coulson, or Agent Coulson, or even Phil, just… Agent. Steve’s guessing there’s a history between the two, but he’s not going to ask. He’s got other things on his mind.
Which is of course why, as he’s just taking his first bite of his amazing-smelling dish, something splats against the window next to him. Looking up, he sees a smear of green slime sliding down the glass.
A second later, Tony was surrounded by projections of images and documents, everything they had that might help, and he cracked his knuckles. Sure, there was a good chance that HYDRA had improved their methods, but Tony was encouraged by the fact that HYDRA had never managed to get their hands on Steve’s serum, so there was no way to compensate for it.
Tony runs a hand through his hair, then scrubs it over his face tiredly. It's only 7:30, he shouldn't be this tired. But he's got seven nanny resumes to go through and a full day's worth of Stark Resilient work to finish. He
"So, any ideas?" Tony asks as the things draw nearer, dropping and flinging globs of slime all the while.
Tony's heart plummets, and he turns in time to see King Slime Lord lunge forward in something close to a charge, moving far faster than they'd seen it move before. Right towards Steve. Tony's yells incoherently, but there is nothing he can do, and he watches helplessly as Steve brings his shield up to cover his head, and curls himself into a protective ball as the slime giant slides right over him.
From there, reflexes take over. He’s got a whole library of training programmes designed. He and Steve had spent hours together — in the days before they’d stopped dancing around each other, before they’d stopped staring wistfully (and lustfully) across the room at one another when they thought the other hadn’t been looking — taking all the feedback from the team, all the data scanned by JARVIS, compiling it together and designing different adaptive programmes that would change enough to keep them on their toes while still giving them the chance to perfect co-odinated movements and strikes. The results had been a team training regime that has turned them from from a bunch of skilled people fighting alongside one another into a skilled cohesive unit that fights together.
Tony, of course, immediately feels like a heel. He'd like nothing better than to be Steve's friend – except, perhaps, being Steve's boyfriend. Of course, he can't
Steve feels his whole body tense up, feels the back of his throat tighten and burn. He swallows hard.
deal with facing another round of questioning. Besides, judging by how his day had gone so far, someone would be camping out by his door waiting for him to leave, or sneaking in somehow.
"I love the feeling of the neighbourhood, I love the architecture, I love that there's so much cultural diversity. I love that it's growing more vibrant, and how much of that is community-generated. I saw a chance to be a part of that, and to expand our outreach programs. Give back a little."
stupid little coffee shops with his two also-broken-down-vet best friends. A lot of people are well out of Steve's league, and he thinks Tony might be at the very top of the pyramid. Even if he's
"He is back," Strange says with utmost certainty. "That constructed pocket reality no longer exists. He would have been pulled back just as the rest of you were. Only… because he wasn't human, he doesn't have the same aura. And because he was the centre around which the reality was constructed, he didn't have the same anchor."
He opens his mouth to say something, but doesn’t get a chance before his train of thought is derailed by a shout, a loud bang, and something that sounds a hell of a lot like a gun shot, followed by screams. Without thinking, Steve grabs the woman around the waist and rolls them to the ground, putting his body between her and the door to shield her. She stares at him, wide eyed and panicked as he jumps to his feet.
The name alone made Tony's blood run cold. He'd asked Thor to say it again, hoping it wasn't the name that had been in his head for years, since the day they'd beat the Chitauri.
It's not the same as it had been in the Haven, and yet it is. He looks wan and tired, too still and pale, but he has the same little scar over his left eyebrow as he always has. Steve knows that if he were to wake up and smile, the smile lines would be deep, and that little dimple on his right cheek would be visible. He knows intimately the golden flecks in the deep brown of Tony's eyes, and allows himself a moment to hate the tape keeping them closed.
Tony would have people around him who would be more than just friends. Tony had mentioned being a single dad but that didn't mean he was
Tony isn't sure what the hell he can say to that, so he decides it's probably easier for everyone if he says nothing at all.
Except now, that mood is rapidly deteriorating. They're working side by side – Bucky at the till, Steve making drinks, and it's light and easy the way it always is. Steve smiles at the customers, makes small talk with them like he always does, but it feels... hollow. The clock ticks closer to 9am, and Steve starts glancing up at the door every 30 seconds. It's like he's trying to be subtle about it, but he's failing miserably, on account of 'subtle' not really being Steve's strongest skill. His shoulders are tensing by the minute, and he's winding himself so tightly, Bucky honestly fears that he might snap.
"In my experience, you don't have a great track record with lodging complaints with management," Steve teases.
was bi," Steve says, looking across at his best friend and wondering how he'd missed something like that. How after everything that they'd shared, including Steve coming out, Bucky had still kept this to himself.
"... and then when our alien overlords come, we can tell them, 'behold, for I have created a giant clown car for you to learn to drive stick shift,'" Rhodey is saying.
"Here we go again," Man-bun mutters, turning away towards the other end of the work space to go stand by where another employee – another blonde guy, though maybe not as tall and jacked – is standing. Tony ignores them both and flips over the folder.
It feels like an eternity ago, but Steve knows it's less than 48 hours since he had gone to bed with this man. Since he had kissed him and held him and made love with him, then fallen asleep beside him in his bed.
“Absolutely,” Tony said, staring at the ground, feeling his hands slip. As far as ideas went, he’d had better. He’d also had a hell of a lot worse. So, call it even.
Hammer falters a little. "He's – he's an alien, or something. I've been keeping my ear to the ground, you know, so I hear things. He's coming to get the stones, and then he's going to destroy the earth, and getting the stone for yourself is the only way to stop him."
It's a tough slog, crawling out of the ditch and back up onto the road. Steve has to lean more of his weight on Tony than he'd like, but it's the only way he can manage to drag his beaten body through the drifts and back onto stable ground. It's easier going from there – somewhat – but the snow is piling up, swirling around their ankles, making every step harder. Even with Tony helping to keep the weight off his knee, it hurts like hell and every step is agony. But they keep going. Ahead, through the swirling mess of snow, Steve sees the lights of the motel at the edge of town, maybe half a mile away now. It's going to be one of the longest half miles of his life. Briefly, he contemplates whether it's worse to trudge through the sand in the blazing sun, or through snow in the frigid cold. Both, is the answer. Both are horrible. But both are made better when he isn't alone. In the desert, he had his crew. He had Bucky, and Clint. In the blizzard, he has Tony, a warm support at his side, keeping him upright. Reminding him that he isn't alone out here. Tony grounds him in a way that means more than he's capable of expressing, especially since, really, he's focused on putting on foot in front of the other, and again, and again. Less than a quarter mile now. He can feel the wind biting into his bones and joints and it aches something fierce. Beside him, Tony keeps up a steady litany of words.
