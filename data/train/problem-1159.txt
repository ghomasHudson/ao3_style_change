I sniff back the tickle at the bridge of my nose.  Fuck, how I’m going to get through this day without an embarrassing display of emotion, I have no idea.  I take a deep breath.  Man up, Watson.
As he sat beside Stamford in the passenger compartment, protected from the abominable weather, he looked outside and said, “This will never get us to the airport. I doubt a tank—"
“Of course!  Do you want me to call someone?  Your doctor?”  The man sitting across from her became alarmed at her distress.
I reach behind him and remove the gun from his back, the weight of it familiar in my hand even after all this time.
It is my turn to kiss his hand.  “You could never fail anyone, John Watson; it is not in your nature.  I know, because you have never failed me.  If you would have given up on anything it should have been me.”
The man who held the door open was tall, thin, and a contradiction of pale skin and midnight dark hair and clothing. As she walked into the office, she watched him watching her, studying her with an intensity that raised the hairs on her arms.
His lips sought and found a sensitive patch of skin on the delicious body below him, the body that carried within it the other half of his being.
'I never want to see you look fearful again, John; it hurts both us of too much', I tell him silently, reaching for his hand and holding it firmly in mine.
Midway through the third speaker, a tall bird-like woman with a beak for a nose, the door of the small hall opened and in rushed a small sandy-haired man who looked to be in his early to mid-thirties.  Sherlock hadn’t seen him at any of the meetings before.  A recent convert, perhaps?  Perhaps his family had held an intervention forcing him to come?  He didn’t look as though he had had any drug addictions, his skin was healthy, his eyes, though a little on the baggy side, were clear.  His coordination not showing any of the hesitancies or tics an addict usually had.
—routine that they’re unable to break with it long enough to take the step that will elevate their relationship to the next level. To the one that will make each of them happier than they would have thought possible.
She set the other cup on the floor, giving her a free hand to knock, but before she had the opportunity to set knuckle to door, the door swung open. She knew she was tired, but she didn’t think she was so tired she wouldn’t recognize the man she saw minutes ago. This was not Mycroft.
—in it, a link taking Sherlock directly to a video that began with a view of a computer screen. On it, a blank Word document, its title bar revealing it belonged to James Alderman.
“Today Sir John told me that you and I be no different than Sherlock, that pages and squires be servants, too.  I disagree; we be different.  We may serve, but tis for a nobler cause than that of a house servant.  We put our lives at risk, but Sherlock?  He sweeps in like a damsel in distress, and with no responsibilities has the same stature as you and me.  Does it not trouble you?”
He catches my eyes and briefly stares deeply into them, centering me…at least for a moment.  “Soon, Sherlock.  Soon,” and then he softly mouths ‘love’.
At the sound of her name, Rose loped onto the floor of the cab and laid her head on the gapless seam where Sherlock’s and John’s thighs met, her large brown eyes guileless as she seemed to query the men.
And in that moment John knew that it was true.  Knew that no matter what Sherlock had said about sentiments and areas and caring, that he had loved John. Loved him with a passion and devotion that was as uncommon as a double rainbow.
“You asked to view your memories so, in preparation, I clicked on the one I believe to have been recorded immediately after you were injected with the chip.” Sherlock lifted the laptop so John could easily see the screen. “But as you can see, this is not your bedsit, and this is not you. In a moment, you’ll see the cabbie in the rearview mirror.”
With Mycroft gone, Sherlock sat motionless, trying to absorb what he had heard.  He finally reached over to the bag and opened it, taking out the boots and the uniform that, though obviously recently laundered, was still stained with blood.  At the bottom of the bag was a small padded envelope.  Opening it he found a ball chain necklace from which hung a set of dog tags.
Slitting an eye, he saw the dark coat, dark hair approaching the door. Smelled the waft from a freshly soaped body.
“Who else does thou think holds thy hand?  Has thou so many suitors?”  Sherlock kept light both his voice and an answering squeeze to John’s hand.  He turned to look at John.  His eyes having adjusted to the low light he was now able to make out John’s features; such a beautiful sight they were.
“Yeah. We can review them from when you left the house, fast forwarding the footage. There are cameras at both the front and the back of the house. About what time did you leave?” Her fingers raced over the keyboard as Sherlock told her to start at 3 a.m.
“If there was a false alarm, that means there was an alarm. What did you see that indicated you needed to do a stereotactic biopsy?” He sounded hesitant to ask—or at least that he feared he might not get an answer. More likely, he feared the answer itself. “What was the alarm, Dr.?”
Wasting no time, I plant a kiss on his cheek and rush into the house to retrieve our coats.  I do not want to leave my beloved husband alone too long; the thought of him in danger leaves me colder than any frosty air and freezing feet.
Crossing his arms, Sir John took in Sherlock's pinked cheeks, the wild hair, the fire that burned in those (Blue? Green?) eyes.
“You wait right here; I’ve made John’s favorite,” she said, turning to scurry back to her flat. “Chocolate chip with pecans.”
Perhaps he had a fever. Bringing a hand to his forehead, Sherlock felt his skin. Beads of water rested there, but twas no more than one could expect given a covered brow on a temperate day.  And he was not lightheaded or feeling ill, his only complaint the thin stripes of muted pain running down his back.
Sherlock grunted. “How would you know?” The box grew heavier; he needed to start viewing. “Have you watched any of it?”
Sherlock’s mind racing, he frantically made a list of explanations of why John had failed to keep up with him, but reason rebelled against them all. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. John would be by his side unless something against his will kept him from doing so.
John disentangles himself and jumps out of bed, (No!  Do not go!), but before I have time to scramble after him, he is back, holding something in his hand and a glint shining from his eyes that I know oh so well.
“You remember what I told you to say?  And that you are to act as haughty and bored as possible?  Take thy time as you search the house.  No overseer is going hurry.  You have to appear as if you be a public servant doing tedious work.”
The lone difference from their last meeting- a light shining on Moriarty, giving him an eerie glow.  Sherlock quickly searched for the source of light, but could see none.  He scanned the surrounding buildings, his peripheral vision never allowing him to lose sight of Moriarty.  Nothing Sherlock saw appeared out of place; nothing appeared suspicious.
Mycroft was the first to look away. And after at least a full minute studying a room that John felt sure he must have been in more than once, Mycroft spoke. “If you must know, he asked if the chips, such as the one retrieved from you, can be used to program people's actions.”
Sherlock palmed Simon’s mobile with one smooth sweep of his hand, pocketing the device and walking back to where he’d been sitting.
The afternoon and evening proceed as they usually do.  Long bouts of comfortable silence as we attend to our respective projects or reading.  The occasional snippets of conversation interspersed with companionable bickering and gentle teasing on his part.  Me calling him an ‘idiot.’  More than once.
Sherlock blinked back the sting at his eyes.  How much easier it would have been to die had it been before he had met John.  Before he had ever had a taste of how truly wondrous life could be.  Before he had known what love be.
I do as told; there is nothing I will not do for John.  (There is an exception to every rule; in this case, it is housework.  But, as it appears my love for him will only continue to grow, I plan to invest in a mop with a longer handle; his will only give me a backache from stooping.)
“Have you not eyes?!” Sherlock bellowed at the slovenly man demanding the portage.  “Four of us there be, and for four of us we shall pay!  You say you ‘think’ since you saw five of us arrive yesterday then we be hiding one so we do not have to pay more.
hold a certain logic.  Time enough there had been whilst he had been gone, not that he would share with Cedric for how long and not what he had been doing.  But no.
“All this time you’ve taken the piss about me being a romantic, and it seems I’m not the only one.  You never fail to amaze me.”  His eyes soften and he kisses me, his lips tender against mine, and I feel
The sound of the distressed inmate a dozen cells down was what was keeping him awake.  Always before when he had heard a criminal say he was‘innocent’ he had scoffed.  ‘Sure, he is,’ John had thought countless times over the years, biased by the fact that the police did not arrest and incarcerate innocent people.  But now he viewed things differently, for he knew that he himself was innocent.  He might not be shouting it at the top of his lungs for all to hear, but it was true nonetheless.
Like this morning.  Waking up cuffed to the bed was not normally on the breakfast menu, but as it was…might as well make the most of it.
“Is it true then what Mycroft said?” He asked as kindly as he could, willing Sherlock to, for once, share a bit of what he hid behind his carefully constructed armor.  To let John in.
“Yes, John?  Something the matter?”  I stand still, my back ramrod straight as I attempt to appear dignified.  It is not working.
Looking back up at Sherlock’s face, John’s darkened. “I cannot lose thee.  I have only just found thee.”
, to do with him? No, no time. He must have gone over it two dozen times, and one more wouldn’t help.
Never ending love and gratitude to my dear friend and beta, Burning_Up_A_Sun.  I bow down to your talent and thank you for your keen eye.
“Sherlock,” he sighed as the lips that be so provocative drifted up to his ear and murmured his name.
“Okay, I will let you love me in whatever way you see appropriate.  It is not for me to say if you are misguided in your affections.”  I stroke my fingers through the hair around his ear, grateful beyond measure to be able to touch him.  To love him.
"As I was saying," Sherlock paused, assuring he had the Knight's attention. "There lives a woman deep in the bowels of town who mixes a special potion. The townspeople call her a witch because of its miraculous powers. She is old, forty years or more, her family killed by the plague-"
“It’s not safe for you to go in; a security guard is stationed outside Mary’s door.  I was able to ascertain it is protective in nature due to the unfortunate incident she was involved in with Shikov.  Since she was the one last seen with him, they are going to keep her under guard until they know for certain she is not…”   This was the difficult part, “…a target as well.”
Passing an outdoor bar, I see a machine making crushed-ice drinks.  “John, look!  Slush puppies!  I am parched; let us go get one. They will help cool us off.”  I head toward the bar, a veritable oasis in the desert, dragging him behind me.
Switching on the nearest lamp, his eyes rebel against its brightness, and as he listens to the voice on the other end of the call, I watch him.  Watch his shoulders square, the deep breath he draws in and releases slowly through his nose as he clenches his jaw.  How he squeezes his eyes shut for the briefest of moments, bracing himself against whatever this person is telling him.  His tongue darting out of his mouth, he moistens his lips and takes another deep breath, fortifying himself.
Looking over the rest of John with light this time, Sherlock puzzled over what he saw, or more precisely, what he did not see—another, more serious, injury.
I am briefly disappointed, but I console myself with the thought that were it too easy to achieve my end, the prize would be less sweet.  My initial failure only serves to strengthen my resolve.
“The meeting is about to start,” Dr. Juma said, practically having to tug the papers from Andi’s hand.
His hands glide up my naked shoulders to my neck; the thumbs that I will never again take for granted massage the skin behind my ears.  Out of pure instinct I reach around his waist and, by his hips, pull him to me until his body is flush with mine.
“Bit of a surprise, that.  We’ve been friends a long time now and I, well, I never had  a clue you felt that way.”  This was far more difficult than he thought it would be.  “But you do know I don’t feel…that way, don’t you?”
“He told me nothing.” Sherlock paced the room, his hands behind him clasped so tightly together that his fingers looked about to snap. “My brother said I needed to meet him at hospital; that John was out of surgery. You’re Rudnikov? A neurosurgeon? Why did John—”
“No, it’s okay, don’t stop.  It will hurt sometimes, but that’s not a bad thing.  It means you’re working some of the kinks out.”
“So what shall we do today, John?” I tilt my head back and look at him upside down.  “We dock in Puerto Rico.”
“I’ve always thought I had everything under control.  All these years I’ve known you, even though I always loved you, it’s been from a distance.  I’ve had to keep it to myself because it was the wrong time of life or I thought you weren’t interested.  Then, when we became intimate, though I knew you were in love with me, I somehow thought my heart was still protected.  I knew, or I thought I did, that you couldn’t love the same way I do; that you didn’t feel things that way.  But when I read your list, it hit me how
“How do you mean you changed her name?  One doesn’t just go about picking out new names for children every year, John.  I know that and I don’t have children.”  He bit the inside of his lip.  Why did he have to sound so taciturn?!
And just as they started to shout “Happy New Year!”, Tracy, with her mask still firmly in place, leaned down and pressed her lips to John’s.
“Where’s Sherlock? Dr. Rudikov has agreed to administer him a sedative. That will help ease him along, keep him from causing trouble whilst we transport him to hospital.” Removing his gloves (
As he spoke, John saw Sherlock’s eyes flicker the first time he used the less intimate “you.”  Saw Sherlock’s eyes narrow the second time John said “you”.  Saw Sherlock stiffen when he told him that Sherlock be none of his concern.
“His name is, was, Leonid Shikov.  He was a Russian National assigned to kill me.  Mycroft doesn’t know anything about his meeting with Mary other than it lasted about 15 minutes before Mary was rushed to hospital.  Leonid was killed on the pavement outside the restaurant.”
Scooting close to Sherlock and reaching for his hand, I remove his glove; our interview indicated that lack of familiarity and ease with touch brings any thought of courtship to a grinding halt.  His hand is warm and smooth, the immensity of it dwarfing my own. I twine our fingers together. His, long and elegant, send a shiver through me. And for the hundredth time tonight, I wish I were his date, not a pretender. But I will make the sacrifice, standing in for his heart’s desire (now firmly established as
With Molly settling the cab fare, Sherlock half walked, half wobbled to the coolers, even in his compromised state easily determining which drawer held James. It was the one with the bloody handle.
I retreat, changing into my night clothes, a broad smile on my face.  Getting into bed I draw the covers back and snuggle against my husband, putting an arm around his waist and my head at his chest where he has made room by wrapping his arm around my shoulders.
“What brought this on, then?  Not that I mind being called ‘idiot’, but ‘I love you’ definitely has a different flavour and that isn’t what you usually say.”
as if he is sorry.)  “But I don’t think drinking tea is going to negatively impact my health.  People all over the world have been drinking it for centuries and it’s well-documented that tea-drinking has many positive effects on people’s health.  So tell me, what is this
It came to him.  Sherlock knew how to lure John into revealing the truth of his heart.  If he be wrong, if John did not love him, then he would blot the emotion from his memory.  But if John
Wadding the first tissue to expose a clean side, she blew her nose again.  Her eyes about to well over, Mary shook her head, “No, they wouldn’t let me see him.  They said he has to be processed first; I can’t see him until visiting hours tomorrow.  What happened, Sherlock?
“As you are aware, he and Greg have been in a relationship for a number of years now.  Quite happily it seems, so I sought his viewpoint.  What he said was quite illuminating.”
Many hours later I slide the hotel key card into the slot, unlocking the door; I have been gone all day.  Fear weighs me down as if a 25 stone corpse has fallen upon me and I am struggling to crawl out from beneath it.  What if John returned first and, not seeing me, left, thinking I do not care?  Thinking I do not want him.  Thinking he is not worth the ‘trouble’ of a relationship.
I was not wrong, then.  I think about his request.  I think back to kissing him (as if I had stopped!).  If I stopped breathing whilst doing that, what will it do to me to feel his body along the length of mine?  I do not want him to wake up to a cold, dead body next to him; I will not do that to John Watson.
To make the best use of his interminable wait, Sherlock mentally mapped the entirety of London, adding virtual stick pins to places John might have gone, color-coding them to reflect degrees of likelihood.  The most horrific possibility, yet the least likely knowing his character, was that John went to Royal London Hospital.  No matter his frame of mind, nothing would cause the doctor to act against his code of decency.  Whatever Mary’s wrongs, he would never harm her. Of that, Sherlock felt certain.
Wait.  What?  No “I love you” in return?  A chill runs through me.  The situation is direr than I suspected.  This requires drastic measures.  And I know just the man to concoct a devious, unassailable plan to make John happy again.
I am certain that at this moment Dr. Watson no longer remembers I am in the room; the words he has waited so long to hear are about to be uttered with the certitude that only the truly love-struck can bring forth. “
? His vision hazy, he watched Sherlock rise and wipe his mouth, a delicate burp erupting behind his hand.
Walking to a bed, Sherlock sat on its edge, tossing clothes to the side as he bared himself to the waist. “Here,” he said. His back to John, he held out the mazer.
find the answer to.  Had he said or done something to drive John away?  Had something…happened to John?
“Here’s what I’m gonna do, Sherlock.  I’ll come by tomorrow, and if you don’t look any better, gotten yourself cleaned up and properly dressed, then I’ll have no choice but to call Mycroft.  I won’t let you do this to yourself.  As annoying a dick as you can be, I’d much rather have you pecking at my heels than…digging yourself an early grave.”
“No, no, no,” Simon shouted, shaking his head. “We’ll dispense with the wheelchair; we haven’t time.”
I tend to my roses until it is so dark I cannot see and go inside to fix something to eat for the first time in three days.   Seeing nothing of interest, I close the cupboard.  The refrigerator has nothing better to offer.
She watched as Sherlock processed what she said.  She could almost see the cogs in his brain turn, fueled by the pursed lips, the furrowed eyebrows.  He didn’t look at her, instead shifting his eyes every few seconds to settle on a different object in the room.
when Sir John be harmed?  Why did you not protect him?”  Sherlock’s eyes blazed with anger.  “Until Sir John awakes and declares otherwise,
The smoke from the candle, dirty and biting, nipped at Sherlock’s nostrils.  His nose twitched as he sniffed back the tickle to keep from waking John.  When the urge to sneeze passed, he puffed out the candle’s flame.  Twas nothing more at the moment that Sherlock needed to see; John’s wound be cleaned and he be sleeping.
Then it comes to me.  Regrets.  A rush of blood reaches my face and I feel myself flush.  It was so long ago I forgot about it. No, that’s not right.  I made the decision not to think about it anymore, to set from my mind something that could not be.
The smile on her companion’s face held no guile.  He had always found her beauty compelling and did no less so now despite the fact she carried another man’s child. He stood up and pulled the chair out for her. When he bent down and gave her a soft peck on the lips, she wiped a smear of bright lipstick off the corner of his mouth with her thumb.  To anyone viewing it, the intimate smile they shared would appear to be that of a couple deeply in love.
“When I was in your flat last night, I found this,” he went on, removing a tagged key from his inner suit pocket.  “I’m not sure of its importance, but it must have some meaning elsewise why would I have found it in the boot of a toe, boxed high in the closet?”
“Clearly,” Sherlock interrupted, “you lack the critical thinking abilities required of someone who should be capable of fulfilling their duties without playing imbecilic practical jokes. You couldn’t properly secure a—” Sherlock cut himself off mid‑sentence as the dog rose onto its hind legs and put its paw to the doorbell.
John’s hands clung to him.  His lips clung to him, mindless of any onlookers, not caring one whit who could see.
Quietly ascending the last steps, he opened the door.  From the doorway he saw John sitting in the chair that had always been his, motionless, appearing to stare into the air at nothing.  With the gun lying on the table by his side.  Lying there innocently, as if it were not an instrument of death.
His foot slipping on something, Sherlock saw it be parchment that appeared to have been cast under the door.  Unfolding it, he read:
They had sniped at each other for another long, very long, five minutes until John had huffed a final “Christ, you’re an idiot. You deserve to spend Christmas alone,” and had dragged the tree—now woebegone from having been tussled between the flatmates—out of the flat. When John returned, he charged up the stairs to pack. How it could have taken John the rest of the evening until the next morning to pack a carry on, Sherlock hadn’t a clue. All he knew was that instead of feeling triumphant at getting his way, fighting with John had left him with a niggling pain in the pit of his stomach.
“Let me put the goddamn Christmas tree up, Sherlock,” John had grumbled the night before. “I’ll decorate it. Wouldn’t want you to do any actual manual labor.”
“Besides,” John said softly, “you need to be near the hospital in case the baby decides to make an early arrival.”  He put his hand on her belly, feeling for movement; he’d not yet been there at the right time to feel the miracle of the baby moving.  Mary placed her hand over his and kissed him one more time.
Responding in Sherlock’s stead to Dr. Watson’s question, I say, “Enchanting. It was an enchanting evening, indeed. That would be what Sherlock would say.” As I speak, I sift quickly through a list of romantic tropes, those prompts that bring a reluctant lover’s feelings to the fore. I must get Sherlock and Dr. Watson moving in the right direction.
As I continue cleansing myself, I cannot forget the sight of John’s face.  Of the light I saw in his eyes that I have never seen before.  I cannot articulate what it was I saw.  Surprise?  Confusion?  Embarrassment?  No, there was something else, I cannot pin it down.
“I didn’t get ahold of you because I was trying to sort myself out.  It took a long time for my body to heal and it took even longer for my head to heal.  The inside of my head.  Hell, it’s still not totally right.”  John grew silent for a moment while he continued to stare at the ceiling.
“Minor detail. Now, if you don’t mind, I must…” By pure force of will, Sherlock raised himself to his feet. As much as he detested the thought, rest was in order, and he needed to get to his bed before he couldn’t get there.
“We did, but I had nowhere to go.  I could not go my family or to friends; I would be too easily found.  I stayed in the city a few days, always looking over my shoulder, fearful that I would be caught at any moment.  I stole a hooded cloak to shield my face and Sherlock’s, and whilst the shop owners turned their backs, I stole necessities.  Of this I be greatly ashamed.  Never would have I thought I would steal; I know I have burned it into thee tis wrong to do.”
Yes, had John ended his life due to his inexcusable mistakes he knew there was no way he could live with himself.
My hand is unsteady as it reaches for the envelope.  John is quite amorous today and it is causing me to lose muscle control.
Katie lets go and I look around for a clear spot to set my overnight case.  Seeing none, I continue holding it.
I will be fine.  I will be fine.  I will be fine, I chant.  For the most part believing what I say.  I lived quite adequately for many years without John Watson; I can do it again.
As if it had just dawned on him what Nika had been saying, Mycroft looked directly at her and asked, “Item? What item? I’m afraid...”
John interrupted the detective, “But, who is it then?  And why do they have Mary’s mobile?  She’s should be in Brighton by now and she wouldn’t leave it behind.”
I peer closely at him.  The smile appears to be genuine.  I smile back; he has seen my point of view and heartily agrees.
Sherlock appraises me in the muted light of passing streetlamps, and I openly return his gaze, hoping he can see that he can trust me. He studies me for a good thirty seconds before he turns away.
John’s hand stops moving and, raising his eyes to mine, looks at me closely.   I am sure he wonders if I have read something I am now regurgitating to contribute to the romantic moment.
After several moments, Sherlock commented dryly, “Well, you were wrong.  Obviously.”  Sweeping his hand over the two bodies that were practically joined together, “Because here.  we.  are.”
Sir John cleared his throat, snapping himself out of his reverie lest anyone notice anything amiss with him.  “Aldus, fetch him something with which to shield his nakedness,” he said, now careful his eyes didn’t stray any further down than the Naked One’s neck.  His long, elegant, milky white…no, his chin.  Yes, yes, his chin, that is far enough.
I wait, giving him time to think. (And giving me time to swoon over that thick, rich hair. Unprofessional, I know—tell someone who cares.) To many of us, dating is as natural as breathing; yet to others, it’s not a matter to be undertaken lightly. And worse yet, to the very few, to embark on a romantic journey is antithetical to everything they have ever believed, as if it were a life principle to not “get involved.” Since Mr. Holmes is here, it appears the last is not the case. Unless that is why he hesitates…
“Sherlock, we can stop this anytime you like.  This isn’t a punishment or a way to hurt you.  Or me, for that matter.   We agreed that we want to deepen our physical relationship and to do that we need to well, uhm, find your libido.  But if it’s going to tear us apart in the process, then it’s not worth it.  I meant what I said, I will be with you no matter what, sex or no sex; a lack of orgasms is not worth losing you over.  I love you.  Whatever you want to do, or not, I will be right here by your side.”
Folding Sherlock into his arms and hugging him tightly, John said, “Sweetheart, thou has a far, far greater capacity for love than thou realises.  Thou does not lose one love because thou starts loving another.”
Sherlock felt as if he’d been hit; he hadn’t expected any objection, let alone one quite so vehement. Pausing to regain his equilibrium, when he did, he stood, seeming to have a sudden interest in the muffin still in his hand. “Well, I’ll leave you to—”
“Home.  Right.”  John scoffed bitterly.  “I’m a wanted felon, or don’t you remember.  Besides, it hasn’t been much of a home since Mary shot you.”
“Ahhh, you be the other fellow – Shirelock, Sherluck; something akin to that.  Sir John told me you might come.  Said if you did, not to answer any questions about where he might be.  But, like I said, I don’t know.  Ask all ya want.”
Sherlock turned, as if he might see his parents arriving. Needing to see for himself that his “loss” hadn’t negatively impacted them. But the snowy lane stretched on for what may have been miles, empty of any sign of life. He sagged, weary from this delusion that seemed would never end.
“Cedric!  Tis not what Sherlock meant.  Eduard’s death be a tragedy, true, but to know where Sherlock’s family be tis important to him.”
Bending down, Sherlock sniffed John’s breathe, unsure if the poison would leave an odor.  But no, John’s breathe smelled of ale.  He dipped a finger in the half-empty mazer sitting on the ground near them, lifting it to his mouth to lick it.  Sliding his tongue around the inside of his mouth, he tasted ale, and ale alone.
As I undress, John kicks his shoes off and pads over to the closet, his feet hushed on the carpeted floor.  Tiptoeing to reach a shoebox on the shelf, he takes it down.  When he opens it, I see the outline of a familiar object appear from the box.  An outline I have not seen in more than two decades.
“Come now, tis obvious.  Millicent urged you to marry after knowing each other for only a few months; why the rush?  She be sewing infant garments which she says be for a friend, but tis no one with whom Millicent be so intimate that she would commit so much time.  And she be unusually cautious lifting heavy items, often asking for assistance, which is not her usual wont.  She be with child; tis no other explanation.
It is early afternoon.  This is what my day has consisted of thus far:  I watched John lying in bed until he arose for the day.  I sat in the bathroom and watched him shave. (He would not let me watch him shower.  He said we are not far enough along in our relationship…yet - whatever that means.)  I watched him make breakfast eat wash the dishes read the paper start his new novel wash and iron our clothes leave the house to go for a long walk come back from the walk balance his checkbook make an entry in his blog take a nap.
“Follow me”, Sherlock almost barked.  Under John’s breath he muttered “Like I have to be told. Don’t I follow you
“Yes, but it will be easier to get you out of my mind, put something else there, if I cannot see you all the time.”  I truly believe this will solve my problem.
But twas difficult to stay angry, not with Sherlock’s eyes turned a sea green in the amber from the dying embers.
Sitting on the settee in Buckingham Palace, John looked over at Sherlock, ridiculously wrapped in his bedsheet. Taking a pointed look at the where Sherlock’s crotch was hidden under a mound of crumpled sheet, John asked "Wearing any pants?" Sherlock's bored response "No-o-o,” should have made John laugh, but despite their location, or perhaps because of it, he found himself aroused by the risk. Reaching over with his left hand he slid it up Sherlock's leg to where his thighs met. Nope, no pants…but there
Sherlock avoided Molly’s eyes as she re-entered the room; he could see she was somewhat shaken by the task she had agreed to complete and didn’t want to distract her.  Still, he was proud of her; she had come a long way from the timid girl he had met years ago in the morgue.
“Oh, you and your mysteries, always in a fuss. And give John my love. Now, about those cookies…” Mrs. Hudson disappeared into her flat.
“Yes, Mycroft, I believe I do know who she is.  And no, you won’t find her in your database.  But there is something else about this document, the paper itself, which strikes me as familiar.”
John snorted. Sherlock was anything but whimsical. And the MOD’s history of covert “research” harming unwitting people was well documented.
“Goddamn, lamebrained idiot. Hasn’t he learned?” John slammed his bag back to the floor and marched to the bedroom to give Sherlock his due.
Colin said this gently, but there be a determination in his voice that told Laila twas only a matter of time until her two boys met.   She knew he be right; they both be grown men, entitled to make their own decisions.  Ignoring the last remnants of doubt that said she should not reveal where Sherlock be, she told Colin what he wanted to know.
I thought I would be able to hold it together better than this; I mean after all, I didn’t shed a single tear when I married Mary.  But today?  Marrying the man I’ve been in love with for so many years?  I...I don’t have words for it.  Thank God I wrote my vows down or I don’t think I would ever get through it, hanky or no hanky.
It was now Sherlock who looked to the door and beyond; resuming his pacing, he walked the same staccato path back and forth.  And for the first time, Nika noticed the weariness on his face, the concern etched around his eyes and mouth that, with an educated guess, she knew had not been there the day before. Sherlock didn’t care about the chip. He cared about Dr. Watson. John.
The thought that he, himself, had one of the chips in him was an exciting twist to a case that he barely had a toehold on; to personally experience a chip in his brain could provide him just the clue he needed to move forward.
Sherlock fought back the emotion he’d been holding in as it threatened to escape him, pressing the back of his hand to his nose to ward off the threat of tears.
“What?  You think even if I be a murderer I be fast enough to use it on you before Cedric or your knight strike
“I don’t believe you,” he finally asserted.  “John wouldn’t confess when he didn’t do it.  And as I told you ...”
They’d been dating for six months now and John was starting to consider that Todd might be ‘The One’.  Now that he was firmly in his thirties he thought it might be time to start thinking about settling down and Todd seemed to be a good match.  They were both in the medical profession, John a doctor and Todd a surgical nurse.  They both loved to play rugby, and while much younger than John, Todd seemed to have gotten over his clubbing days and wanted to settle down.  They got along well, having only the occasional tiff.
“If your father will pay so handsomely for your return, then why do these men not take the purse gladly?  I have little doubt they could buy a small farm were the reward so generous.”
I push his shirt up and pull his jeans and pants down (just a little!).  Even though we have slept together every night since that first kiss that literally left me breathless, never have I seen him without a shirt.  I stare at his flesh.
John finally fell into an uneasy sleep, the noise fading into nothingness as he willed himself to ignore it.
“Oh.”  Sherlock seemed surprised at the thought.  “No, but what difference does it make?  The results be the same.”
He looks at me thoughtfully.  “It’s a fact of life, Sherlock.  We get old and then we die.  There’s so much I always wanted to do and never got around to.  When you’re raising a kid, especially by yourself, you get so caught up in daily life, in making sure they’re happy and healthy and they get their homework done and learn to drive…”  He pauses, appearing to reflect a lifetime of memories.  “Then all of a sudden you sit here thinking ‘Where did the time go?  What about the things
John rocked back on his heels and wiped his mouth, unable to look at Sherlock.  What in the hell was his flatmate going to think
John glances back at me. “What the fuck?” his face plainly reads. (This expression differs from his “What the
Sherlock slowed his steps further as he sought the building housing the old woman. Spotting her through an open doorway as she hunched over a basin, her hand felt along the table on which it sat. Her fingers bumping into a plate, she grasped it and passed a wet rag over it.
), pushing aside the nagging ache that remained and making room for the memory of meeting Sherlock, an occurrence that had affected him like nothing before had. Even now as he thought about it, he had the sense of leaving his own body. Meeting Sherlock had impacted him on the scale of Michael Corleone’s thunderbolt when meeting Apollonia, stripping away everything else in life so completely that that nothing else mattered and no one else existed. The feeling was unsettling. It was exhilarating.
John squared his shoulders and stood tall; he would need some courage for this one.  The prospect of kissing Sherlock was one of the scariest, and one of the most thrilling, circumstances he had ever encountered.  And he had invaded Afghanistan.
John traversed the streets of Leith in a haze, not knowing or caring where his feet took him.  Not knowing he walked the same streets and paths time and again.  It did not matter.  Nothing mattered.
I say it was easy to think of ways to show John I love him, but I became distracted as I observed him, budging closer to the bed to rest my palm in his where it escaped the covers.  As I sat, memorising for the hundredth time (or was it a thousandth?) the shape of his brow, the quirk of his mouth, the curve of the body that transported me to ecstasies previously unknown, I put a plan together for the day.  Finally, I removed my hand from his, able to do so only because I knew I had work to do…make him happy.
His stomach twisting, Sherlock tore his glove from his hand, his need to dissuade John from further dark thoughts paramount.
“Off!” Sherlock pushed the driver off the scooter with a well-aimed hip, sending him stumbling to the side. “Your helmet!” Adjusting himself on the seat, Sherlock tossed the driver’s briefcase to his feet and grabbed the helmet from a shaky hand. Strapping the helmet on, Sherlock throttled the engine and, just as the machine started rolling, someone grabbed him, straddling the seat behind him.
At first it is awkward, holding the baby.  I sort my memories; have I done this before?  I think not…and I do believe this is one of the most frightening things I have ever done.  Jump off buildings?  Pfft.  Stare down murderers.  Double pfft. Even kissing John the first time was comparatively painless, in part I think, because I was not fully aware of what was happening.  But hold a tiny human being?  Terrifying.  The thought flits through my mind, “what if he bites?”, but John has reassured me such a small child does not yet have the capacity.
“John!  John!  Where are you?!”  I hear fear in my voice as I call out to him.  I am scared.  Nothing,
John sighs wearily.  I do not know how he can be weary; he has had almost three and a half hours of sleep.  He should be as well-rested and alert as I.
Crossing his arms, John waited for an explanation, a reasonable explanation.  Doubting he would get one.
Sherlock unleashed his anger on John next.  “And what more be there to hear?  I shall tell you.  Nothing.  I have heard all I want or need to hear.  You knew about this and did not tell me?”
Thoughtfully rubbing his thumb up and down the side of Sherlock’s throat, he told him, “It had nothing to do with you.”  Seeing the expressive eyebrows lift in doubt, he waited for Sherlock’s gaze to meet his and looked directly into his eyes, adding firmly, “Nothing.”
John’s brain drew a blank; twas not part of the script, to be interrupted.  He had known what he was to say, but now, nothing.   “I will…  I will…”  As twisted and almost unrecognizable as be the mask of Sherlock’s face, all that came to John be
I leave the room and head down to the lobby, ignoring the ‘Good day, Mr. Holmes’ the concierge offers as I pass by him.  I scan every place visible to me, watching for a short (my apologies, John, but it
“I felt lost, John.”  I pause as I recall the sense of grief I felt at not connecting with my cherished home as I stood on the pavement.  “Here I was in a city in which I lived and breathed all my life, and I could not feel it.  I could not feel the pulse that I always thought kept my heart beating.”
Gesturing toward the canvas bag that neither man had explicitly acknowledged, Mycroft said gently, “His sister and mother have been notified of his death.  What personal belongings he had with him have been sent to them, but recently he sent word to his sister that if something happened to him he wanted you to have his uniform.  He told her that enlisting in the Army was the most important thing he had ever done and that if he died over there he wanted you to have the best part of him.”
The smile disappears from his face, and he frowns.  He sets the invitation down, reaches over and presses the back of his hand to my forehead.
the same man.  But why would he attack me and Cedric?  We look nothing like you.”  John looked up at Sherlock, puzzled.
Sherlock’s nostrils flared and, with both hands, John held that beloved face so he could not look away.
Honey?  Who is Honey?  I feel a hand underneath my unbuttoned shirt (how did that happen?) persistently rubbing me in brisk, firm strokes up and down my sternum.  It is not an unpleasant sensation.
“Yes, John, I be well,” Sherlock said, giving John’s hand another small squeeze.  “I be bored, so I pushed Cedric out to spend time with you.”
After whipping up a breakfast casserole, I took a steaming plate of it on a tray with a mug of tea and a shop-purchased rose bud in a vase for color, booming, “Good morning, John!”
I fly to the bed and perch on the edge, grasping his shoulder, shaking it.  My urgency to wake him now surpassing all other thought.
“Exactly. Toys to be played with. Toys to be manipulated. Just as Simon did with Spencer and James.”
writing a book under my nose.”  I can hear him thinking it through, realising he’d come to the wrong conclusion.
I’m touched that Sherlock and Katie can have this conversation, and so proud of our daughter; she’s always been compassionate.  After the fact, I found out there were many times as a child she would talk to Sherlock about things she didn’t feel she could talk about with me, but I didn’t know it went the other way.  If she weren’t my own daughter I’d probably be jealous.
I go lie down on the sofa, close my eyes, and wait.  And think.  Not that kind of thinking.  Thinking about John.  About how much I will miss him, at least for a while.  I estimate it will be no more than two days that I will miss him, for that is how long it has been since I kissed him and fell in love.  Surely going through the withdrawal of being in love with him can last no longer the initial feelings themselves.  Surely.
“I’m sure you are aware you are putting Dr. Watson in danger by bringing him here.  After all, there
“I know you want to see Ekaterina straight away, but there’s a matter I need to take care of first and it involves you.  I am turning myself in for Magnussen’s murder.  You deserve see your daughter without fear of returning to prison.”
Lestrade was conflicted.  He didn’t like to interfere in other people’s business, especially between Sherlock and his brother, knowing there was no love lost there.  But this was just too much.  Sherlock was using again and he feared that one day it might be once too many.  The last thing he wanted to do was knock on Mycroft Holmes’ door to tell him his brother had died.  Of an overdose.
As if being barred from kissing him will make me want him more.  What a ridiculous notion.  I have strength of self-control he has never encountered the likes of.  I will show
Toeing his shoes off and using his trench coat as a makeshift blanket, Lestrade sank into the sofa, fatigued almost to the point of exhaustion.
Sherlock turned, looking into John’s face, starting to feel the keen loss of never seeing it again.  If John had no need to go to London he would go home, and Sherlock would have to go…somewhere; certainly there would be no place for him in Cambridge.  No, he would revert to his original plan, then, and go on to London.  Alone.
A soft mist fell on John as he sat along the promenade between Tower Bridge and the Tower of London, but he took no notice of that or anything else around him.  Most sitting there on a temperate June night, on the cusp between spring and summer, would have been enchanted by the pink and blue tinted lights on the bridge.  Would have found the lighted buildings along the skyline comforting, their presence a reminder of the indomitable spirit of London.  A city many centuries old that was the perfect blend of old and new.  A city that gave testimony to the idea that not all living things need have a pulse.
When he lets go and turns away from me, I take me and my puddle below the covers and press my lips, my tongue, to him.  I kiss and lick and suck the patch of skin laid bare before me.  Soon his body is pressing into me and I am floating on a cloud.
It was in the darkness that Sherlock allowed himself to share the horror of the nightmare in which John had been killed.  Why he had put himself at risk to break into the prison with the express purpose of breaking John out.
John stopped what he was doing and turned to look at Sherlock.  The detective’s face told him he was dead serious.  As much as John wanted to be a free man, the thought of losing Sherlock again,
John surveyed the room. “I see you be packed and ready to leave, good.  Uh.  Uhm…”  His heart sank at his next words, but he drew himself up straight.  The squires did not need to see his distress. “Sherlock be not traveling with us, he has decided to go his own way.”
Ready with a cutting remark, Mycroft let it die in his throat.  His head cocked to the side, he looked at his brother, for once unwilling to respond with sharp words.  For before him was a man he could see was in true need, a look that made Mycroft uncomfortable; he wasn’t used to a Sherlock that was not ready to challenge even the most innocuous comment.
I open an eye and peer at him, the look on his face apprehensive.  His book lies flat on the table, forgotten.
Sherlock followed John out of the inn; the sounds of the city that be muffled whilst they be inside, now a dull roar.  Side by side they twisted through the throngs, the crowds thinning as they reached a ward more abundant with homes than businesses.  As they walked, John tested Sherlock on what he was to say to access Cedric’s aunt’s household, what he was to do when he entered.  Twas not that John thought Sherlock too feeble-minded to remember, for who had a greater facility than Sherlock?  But if John did not stifle his rage, he be in danger of doing something rash.  In danger of storming Cedric’s house himself.  And twould do no good for Cedric and his family to know John be in the city; he and Sherlock would be unable to catch Cedric unaware if Cedric be about.
Colin may have said something else, but John did not hear it.  Thinking quickly, he knew what they had to do.
“Budge over, Rose.” Rose lumbered to the far side of the cab’s bench, with Sherlock taking his rightful place next to John. And fighting, for the second time that day, guilt. An emotion that he didn’t wear easily.
“Yes, you do.  Something be bothering you, and you barely hear a word I say; you keep looking at the door.  You be like a covered pot ready to boil over.”  Nearly as tall as Sherlock, when he stood up straight, Colin’s gaze be level with Sherlock’s.  “He will be back.”
John interrupts my reminisces.  It is for the best; I should focus on the more agreeable moments, and there are so, so many.
stupid as to fall into the same trap again?  John felt the bile rise up in his throat, knowing this time Sherlock wouldn’t have time to create an elaborate plan, ensuring his survival.
No, Sherlock had been the one to try to bury Mary’s secrets, had been the one, even more than Mary herself, to try to convince John that he needed to move on, to look forward.  Look forward to the day he held his baby girl in his arms and let it all go.  Mary’s past was just that….past.
“Ahhh, up so early?”  Mycroft is sat at the kitchen table, cup of tea in hand as he scans the Parliament website on the laptop in front of him.  Even though he has long been a pensioner, he likes to keep up with the Hansards.
Even if I want to think of anything else, I am unable, for John’s mouth has finally found mine and I can think of nothing but daisies and butterflies.
delusion, and I say we go.” Sherlock grabbed the cab door and flung it open with such force that when it opened as far as it could, it bounced back, slamming shut. He opened it again and pointed at the interior. “In. Now,” he said fiercely. Much to Sherlock’s relief, because he had little spirit left with which to fight, Stamford complied without argument.
I tell him I lied to him. I tell him I have always wanted to kiss him. That I have always dreamed of kissing him, both while awake and when asleep.  That I thought if we bridged the dream where I kiss him without falling unconscious, with reality, I may connect the two in my mind, relieving me of my overwhelming sense of anticipation.
The morning dragged into the afternoon.  As much as he be able, Sherlock tempered his restlessness, concentrating on the strategies Aldus be giving him to dismount the other rider as swiftly as possible.  But it be difficult.  Every piece of armour reminded him of John; armour that had touched John’s skin touched his.  It be as if John’s body be wrapped around him.  Twas exquisite torture.
If she did tell him the truth of her visitors, where did she start? With William, her first husband, who Colin did not know existed?  Or with the brother he had never met?  He would have so many questions, rightfully so.  Not all she would want to answer, not all to which she would want to admit.  But she knew in her heart twas time.  Time to tell Colin the truth about her past, and his.
Baker Street's pavement teemed with pedestrian traffic and, with balletic grace, Sherlock weaved through the throng of people, dodging the plodding shoppers and tourists, heavy bags hanging from their arms.
Stopping by the bed on his way to his laptop, he studied John. The bruises turning shades of blue and purple. The scrapes losing their angry red coloring and the deeper ones bandaged or forming scars. A thin blanket outlined the splint and dressing on John’s left leg; soon, a cast would replace the splint, after the threat of infection at the incision site had passed.
“Drat,” I curse to myself; I woke him.  “I am fine, John.  Just needed a glass of water.  Go back to sleep.”
“Of course, tis our place.  Tis our job to protect him, is it not?  And he needs protecting; he just may not know it.  Be you on my side?”
“Tis a brilliant idea, is it not?”  Cedric broke in.  “We decided since we lost Eduard, and since you already possess some of the skills, twould be easy to place you into the role.”
Sherlock’s world slowly collapsed in on him as he realized with sickening clarity he once again fell for a man who could never reciprocate his love.
So when Sherlock pulled his lips away from John’s (dammit!), drew the sheet back over the corpse and quickly strode to the door, John was hot on his heels.  “Where’re we going, then?” John inquired.  He assumed Sherlock must have some hair-brained idea he was chasing after, but hadn’t a clue what it was.
The dim lighting in the cell gave Sherlock and John enough light to see that each other was there, that neither was alone, but offered enough cover that they couldn’t see the inflections in each other’s eyes, could not witness the fears on the surface of their hearts.
It would not normally matter to him whom Mrs. Watson associated with, but more than he would care to admit it did affect him.  Whatever troubled John Watson would trouble Sherlock, and therefor himself.  But more than the fact that Mrs. Watson was holding the hand of a man not her husband, he was deeply concerned by
“No need,” Sherlock mumbled, his own breathing laboured, and his arm draped lazily over John’s legs.
The room crammed from one wall to the other with cartons and crates, it seemed futile to even think about unpacking just yet; she could barely move her body, let alone the mountain of things. Moving house was never easy, not to mention the move was transatlantic. And when Mr. Holmes had called, she had already been behind in her packing. The only saving grace had been that Mr. Holmes (his people anyway; she couldn’t imagine his posh arse doing anything as common as calling a removal company) had swooped in at the last moment and organized the move.
He takes my hand in his and, holding my hand over his heart as if I am an inestimable treasure, he budges back, snuggling deeper into the curve of me.
“My precious girl,” she whispered to the small, wizened face she held in her arms as she sat down in the chair.  “You are more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.  Your daddy is going to fall in love with you.”
The salary Brian earned as a skilled tech for Her Majesty’s prison system was more than the average UK worker was paid and comfortably sufficient for his family’s everyday needs.  However, he would have been lying if he said he had not dreamed of the kind of life where he could take a vacation to an exotic location every year, buy his wife the Coach bag she coveted, or make sure his son would be able to attend a top-notch Uni.
“Tis nothing, no more than a scratch; I fell onto a root and it gouged me. But they are,” he cleared his throat, glancing at John, “Tis deep.” Scanning the room, he did not see the brass jug. He knew she had kept it on the shelf over the washbasin, but twas long ago.
The crate’s contents clanging as they set it on the floor, for the first time Sherlock felt a twinge of doubt that he could carry out his plan.  For the first time, he saw a flaw in it.  To ride a horse?  Twas simple enough.  To reason the lance’s angle for an an accurate hit?  Twas easy enough a child could do it.  But to dress his body in one hundred pounds of unyielding iron whilst he did so?  Twas a daunting thought.
“Sherlock,” he again heard his name, this time accompanied by a brisk slap.  A slap on his cheek that while not painful, was jarring.  His eyes opened.
“My subconscious related it to when I was in prison; I could not move, just as I cannot now.  My subconscious does not know the difference between a body and chains.  Imprisonment is imprisonment.”  I do not blame John.  It is an unfortunate consequence of an unfortunate event.
For the first time in days he could not tell what Sherlock said to him and, sinking deeper into a dour mood, John bid all an early good night.
Looking back, I could not have been more wrong how I handled the affair, for I reverted to my pre-marital method of coping – I sulked.  For three days I did not talk to John.  Three days I did not sleep.  Three days I did not hold my husband in my arms and tell him I loved him.
“We will not leave the country until after thy tournament.  Tis important to thee, and we will use the time to make plans.  Plus,” Sherlock’s eyes twinkled, “surely thee will win.  We can sell the precious stones that be the victor’s prize, and that cottage of which you speak will be ours much the sooner.”  He swiped the pad of his thumb along the lower lid of John’s eye.  “And do not weep; tis not becoming,” Sherlock said, trying to sound stern but not quite succeeding.  “I like thee happy.”
Have I mentioned that I despise John Watson?  That I rue the day I met him?  That I would delete my memories of our spine-tingling, sigh-inducing kisses if I did not think I might,
Colin’s mouth flapped.  Noises that sounded nothing like words escaped him as he continued to stare at Sherlock.
Unsure of how to respond, John’s mouth gaped. No, he had it. “That’s one of the most ridiculous things I’ve heard of. I’m leaving you. What’s the point of leaving if you go with me?”
And he finally looks up, his eyes searching mine, softly pleading for me to say ‘yes’.  My stomach goes flippity flip; this time not from happiness, but from the pain I see.  The dark depths that say whatever he needs to tend to, it must be alone.
Never before had he met someone who within minutes put him at ease, that didn’t have that wary look about them that said there was something a bit off about him.  No, John had been warm and inviting and there had not been a thing about him that said that Sherlock was not okay.  Sherlock had seen it in his eyes, in the way he held himself, in the softness about his mouth.
“Do everything you can to ensure my brother is unharmed. But if he is an imminent threat to others, act accordingly.”
“True.  But then you would miss your curfew and would have nowhere to stay and…oh.”  It suddenly dawned on Sherlock that John getting kicked out might not be such a bad idea; there was an extra room in the flat, after all.
“I said, do you want another one.” The server stood over him expectantly, the chewing gum in her mouth dying a violent death.
“I won’t hurt you, Sherlock, it’s the last thing I want to do; I love you. So now that you know what’s coming, you can prepare yourself and maybe find out just why I like it so much.”
Oh, my, oh my,” she flustered. “Could I please you with a cup of ale? Tis fresh. My cupboards are empty, but if you wait until Colin comes by, I will have something for you to eat.”
"My predi..." Aldus started to spit out, but stopped himself as Sir John approached. He had no desire to explain their conversation. The last time he had been in trouble with the Knight his "correction" had been to chop two tall trees into kindling. The act left blisters on his hands, and arms too sore to lift for a many days. Most upsetting, his arms and hands had been useless to pleasure himself. No, he did not want to suffer such agony again.
“Thanks, mate. Cracking work,” Simon said, his exuberance threatening to burst from him. He replaced the disc’s envelope with another that held £5500 and nudged it to the middle of the table. “I added a bonus for you.”
“How long has Dr. Watson been in love with you?” I ask quietly. This cannot have escaped the notice of the world’s most observant man. And even if it has, he needs to know.
“Yes, love,” John said, amusement playing about his eyes and mouth.  “So what be the answer to my question?  How will we bring Cedric out of hiding?
“And hello to you, too,” Mycroft said as Sherlock stepped onto the patio, closing the door behind him. “Why so sour?”
Looking away, Sherlock couldn’t help from adding silently, ‘I couldn’t live with myself if something happened to you.’
Mary.  But still…he thought with the baby on the way Mary decided to once and for all put her past behind her.  It appeared he was wrong.  Very wrong.
For the girl’s benefit, I point at the ‘Captain’.  “He’s dead.  A dead pirate.  A pirate is dead.  So sad.  One less pirate in the world.  I wanted to be a pirate.”
“Nika? What is it?” Jax stepped quickly to her. Before him stood a woman who, if not in a panic, veered far too close to one, and this was not the Nika that Jax knew.
With no warning, a black cab appeared on the curb in front of them. Without a fleck of snow on it, it sat, engine running. And it hadn’t rolled up; it had
“He will not tell anyone.”  Sitting beside him, Sherlock folded John’s hands in to his own, weaving their fingers together.
The man in the red suit, the tracks and sleigh bells, the footprints.  Could it be…could it be true?  Could there really be a Santa Claus?  No, there cannot be.  But what other explanation is there?
At this Aldus swung at Cedric, nearly unbalancing himself from his horse, but Cedric ducked out of the way of the flying fist.
Sherlock nodded. “And a bag of chips,” he said, his eyes following her as she continued to a few more tables before returning to the bar, as his thoughts returned to what he had seen.
After barring the door and taking off his clothes, John climbed onto the bed beside Sherlock so they were face to face.
Sir John waited for more, an explanation, a colourful story, but nothing followed. For a man who suffered a near drowning because he "talked too much", he could be stubbornly reticent.
I still cannot think because now all I can do is feel. Feel his lips soft against mine.  His body burning against me.  His breath warm and sweet on my face.
Sliding the chain off, he opened the door, managing to affect a dark scowl in an attempt to drive his visitor away. It had worked many times in the past, no reason it shouldn’t now.   He had to admit, he had a vague curiosity as to who was disturbing his sleep.  Though, to tell the truth, he didn’t know whether he had fallen asleep or passed out, it was all the same anymore.
It enters my mouth, thick and strong. It is not intrusive; it feels as if it always belonged there.  I suck at it and it pulls back; I have to dart at it to catch it again.   And again.  And.  Again.
When he reached the landing, Sherlock dabbed his finger in a trace of the oil he had spotted on his way up, sniffing the substance as he rubbed it between finger and thumb. It had been tracked up by average-sized footwear (male, size 9, somewhat above average body density given the pressure on the treads—the intruder at the Belgravia home?)
Of course, she is, you are John Watson.  Anyone would be happy to have you around.  Even me, if I could think.  Think of anything but you.
Rolling his eyes, Mycroft said, “I may want to know what you’re up to but imagine the tedium of going through hours and hours of Dr. Watson’s memories. I shudder at the thought. Speaking of which, I have something for you.” Mycroft handed Sherlock a box. “The chip.”
Photographs. Few pictures of people; perhaps taken by James since she featured in none of them? But there she was in full view in the selfies she had taken around the world—Bangkok, Amsterdam, Sydney, and an African safari that appeared to have been taken just months ago.
But everything that came to mind sat uneasily in him; he couldn’t imagine them reaching his tongue. Mentally crumpling each rejected snippet into a wad, he tossed them aside.
“No, I don’t remember.” A cloud passed across John’s face and flitted away. “From what we’ve been told, I don’t think I ever will, but it doesn’t mean we can’t start our friendship over.”
Mycroft shifted uncomfortably, searching for a way to soften the impact, finding none.  “He doesn’t want you to contact him, Sherlock.  He doesn’t want anyone to be in touch with him.  I…I’m sorry.”
“Of course.  Of course, you be loyal.  Please forgive my intrusion.  Tis just that he reminds me of someone who once lived outside my town.  I will pursue it no further.”
A smile tipped up the ends of John’s mouth.  “Yes, my love, thou be perfect, absolutely perfect,” he said before slumber reclaimed him.
“Oh, yea, right!  Right proud of myself about now, ” he laughs with me.  Flippity flip.  There is no sweeter sound.
It was in the darkness that John was able to tell Sherlock why he had taken the blame for killing Magnussen.  Why, in that one crucial moment, it had been more important to him to keep Sherlock safe than to give himself safe passage home.
Ooohhh, I know what lip biting means. In a response worthy of further Pavlov studies, I bite my own, getting lost in eyes hooded by long lashes.  Thinking about him sucking my toes.  The hands that massaged my foot drifting up my inner thigh to my…
He would have been even more grateful to leave had he known he was soon to see the young man he had treated in the A&E a year ago.  To once again see the man that, unbeknownst to him, would one day save his life.
“Sherlock, soon they will play something less brisk; go dance with thy mother.  Colin cannot watch after her the entire evening; he be newly married.”  John’s knee bounced, and his whole body swayed back and forth in rhythm with the music.
John smiles.  “You’re not a machine, love.”  He winces at his choice of words, never having forgiven himself for something he later found to be thoughtless.
John said it quietly, but looking at Sherlock John knew had he shouted it he still would not have been heard.
If she had ever wondered before, and she hadn’t, she would now know the life of espionage didn’t suit her temperament. The depth of deceit she was involved in and the threat of exposure made her feel she might go a little bit mad.
“What are you doing, John?”  I had asked him minutes before we went to bed, watching as he set a glass of milk and mince pie onto a small table he had pulled close to the Christmas tree.  Why would he take an evening snack beside the tree? I had wondered.
“You what?!” It is Dr. Watson’s turn to erupt, letting rise the emotion that has boiled just below the surface since the first time he laid eyes on me. “One date?” He jabs a finger at me. No, not
With no thought for anything but John, Sherlock shoved through the wall of people, seeing what he knew he might never unsee. Not far from the cab, John lay on the street, the blood trickling from his nose a vivid red against the deathly pallor of his face. His legs positioned so unnaturally that it was as if a macabre puppeteer had experimented with how far he could bend them without snapping them in two. And John’s face, scraped and bruised, looked worse than many a corpse Sherlock had—
It didn’t take long for John to realize that in some respects Sherlock was a genius.  He would get long emails about cases Sherlock was working on, great care taken in recording all the details.  Once in a while he would even be asked his opinion, only to be told summarily his answer was incorrect, but he wasn’t offended.  He didn’t think Sherlock was being unkind, he was getting it that Sherlock might not be as socially advanced as most people he knew.  He found Sherlock fascinating and that was enough for him.
Sherlock stared down at the screen in his hands. Swiping his thumb back and forth across it, he didn’t look up until Andi was gone, left with the faint feeling that he was more alone than before she had sat down.
John palmed the back of Sherlock’s head, bringing his flatmate impossibly closer, tangling his fingers in the tumultuous curls.  His other hand cupped Sherlock’s jawline, his thumb teasing the obscenely full bottom lip.
We are still in London; delight fills me as I anticipate the day.  I would clap my hands in glee, but I do not want to wake John.  Whilst he does not need beauty sleep as he is already a fine specimen of that well-worn phrase ‘aging gracefully’, I cannot say the same for his temperament.  There is a direct correlation between the number of hours he sleeps and the number of times he gets angry at me during the day.  What I have ever done to merit such vitriol directed my way, I do not know; the care I take in attending to his endless number of wants and needs is incomparable.
Around 11 John goes to bed.  My need for sleep or lack thereof in this case, has never altered; I stay up to work on my current regimen of experiments.  The house feels lonely when John heads to his room for the night.  I miss him.
“Sire, God keep you,” Colin called out to the young man who stood up from where he sat at the fire.  “There be no reason to raise your weapon; I mean you no harm.”  He held his open palms up in a profession of peace.  “I be Colin, from Leith.”
He puts my hand on him, where I touch the silkiness of his shaft.  Feel the ridges of his veins with the tips of my fingers.  Smooth along the edge of his glans, and up to the top, where its velvety softness causes my breath to hitch.  Mesmerized, I swirl my finger through the beads of liquid that have collected there.  I am entranced with this new part of John.
John nodded, too late for Sherlock to see. Uncertain, anyway, how he could prepare himself for the unknown. But what alternative did he have? And hooking his mobile to its charger, he sat sentry over it as he waited for Sherlock to call.
“And what was that?”  John has finally exhaled and is speaking normally.  I shall have to touch him again when he is not watching to see if there is a correlation between my touch and the previous reaction.  I will try not to distract myself with the thought.
I tear myself away from John and go to my old haunt, the chair at the end of the bed. Though asleep, he seems to know I have gone. He rolls toward the now empty space beside him and reaches out to hug my pillow, giving it a little squeeze. Is it because he needs more space, or could it be, dare I hope...he misses me?
), he thrust it into his pocket and started walking, his clip decidedly less urgent. As much as he instinctively rebelled against Andi’s recommended course of action—
“So when I found out, I couldn’t bring myself to tell you.  How could I tell you that I hadn’t talked to or seen my own mother in over 20 years?  That I hadn’t had any idea where she lived or if she was even alive?  I didn’t want you to know what kind of person I truly was; that I abandoned my own mum.  What kind of son does that?  It’s eaten at me for so long, Sherlock.  Sons are supposed to love their mothers and help take care of them when they get old.  I’m sixty-two fucking years old and sometimes I feel like I’m twelve, still rebelling against a mother who was too sick to know how badly she hurt other people.  I feel ashamed, Sherlock.  That’s why I didn’t tell you.”
When he clicked the link to the newest video, as soon as he saw the setting, he closed it and leaned back against the bench for support. Stunned that, of all the many, many hours of memories that Simon had to choose from, he had chosen
.  He could not have more boldly declared his love for Sherlock.  Hiding his regard for Sherlock was going to be much more difficult than he thought.
Lestrade pawed a hand through his hair, his shaky sigh telling John everything he didn’t want to know. That Sherlock’s brilliance, and stupidly uncanny luck, might not be enough to save him this time.
John leaned forward, falling against Sherlock’s chest where he felt an erratic heartbeat that matched his own. And with a tortured groan he reached up, cupping Sherlock’s face in his hands. Knowing without a doubt that nothing,
John sat there, overwhelmed as Sherlock finished recounting the day that changed their lives forever.
If you're enjoying the story, kudos and comments are greatly appreciated!  They help this little writer carry on.  <3
Blowing out a few breaths, he rights himself, sounding more like the John I have known and…loved, all these years.
Sherlock wanted to scream. But he stood numb, willfully postponing the full impact of where he was. Or why he was there.
It did not mean Sherlock had forgiven him, but it did mean Sherlock had accepted his offer.  Perhaps he not be so stubborn after all.  “Good, tis good.”
“Well, we’ll do what we can to keep warm until furnace repair gets here; you’re already about to turn blue. I’ll get the rest of the wood for the fire, but you do know, don’t you, it won’t last even one night?”
Pulling back so he could look at Sherlock, John asked, “Will that do?  If you prefer, I can continue with Ily-”
With one small touch Sherlock had begun to do what the doctors and the psychiatrist could not do.  He had begun to restore John’s heart.
John stared at Sherlock whilst he talked. Twas not only his beauty which stirred him so, but, the extraordinary mental agility which he possessed. His thoughts straying, John could not help but wonder at the servant’s agility in other more
“Oh! Hello, Dr. Watson! I’m so sorry. I thought you’d be sleeping.” She started backing away. “I’ll leave you—"
“Thou be out quite late,” John mused, rubbing Sherlock's back.  “The fire almost be dead.  About what did thou and Laila speak?  I know thou has forgiven her, but what has held thee back from talking to her until tonight?”  What John also wanted to know, but did not ask, be why Sherlock refused to call Laila Mother.
"Ha!" Aldus erupted. "If this potion you speak of be so miraculous why did she not save her family? Maybe it is what killed them-"
His body had slowly mended over the three months he was there, but there had been nothing they could do for his frame of mind. He had met with the in-house psychiatrist every week, the two fighting a battle over his relentless apathy and the underlying depression…the psychiatrist calm and unaffected, John unable to see the point as she gave him tools to cope with a world that was somehow passing him by.  Gave him drugs that took away the nightmares but left him even more apathetic, drugs he took to hiding under his tongue until the meds nurse was gone, when they were then flushed down the sink.
Her eyes moved around the room, taking in the faces of the rich and elegant; people who likely never worked a hard day in their lives.  The woman with the almost imperceptible plastic surgery whose face looked a good twenty years younger than her hands.  The man with the noticeable hair implants, touching the bare shoulder of a woman young enough to be his granddaughter, looking as if he could eat her right then and there.  The man in his late forties wearing a three piece suit and tie; his eyes beading on her, the glacial look in them cold enough to make ice feel comfortably warm…
John gloated in his triumph, albeit an unexpected triumph.  “It will not fit you, Sherlock, twas custom made.  And tis too late for a blacksmith to create a suit for you.  I believe your plans are for naught; you will not be able to compete.”
He remained sitting in the chair for hours, staring at nothing.  Feeling nothing.  Holding the metal tags so tightly they pierced his skin, creating a wound that would soon turn into a scar he would carry with him for life.
“Did something traumatic happen recently that you know of?”  Even more gently John asked, “Do you have any reason to believe this was a suicide attempt?”
“Suz. Is John Watson still in surgery? …yeah, I know. I’m as surprised as you that I’m here…Listen, I’d love to chat, but— No worries.” Nika thrummed her fingers on the desk; she needed to get moving.
Lestrade turned away from John and called out, “Hey, Sherlock!  Come over here!”  He shook his head, marveling at the coincidence of the doctor being at just the right place
“What am I going to do with you, you silly man?  You can’t stop breathing every time we kiss and there is
sacks instead of out of them. Had Sherlock put the mistletoe there? What kind of experiment could he be conducting? John found this puzzling. Sherlock was not remotely interested in botany.  Perhaps he was testing its relative potency as a chemical agent depending on the length of time it hung there or maybe he wanted to see what reaction it might cause when they had Greg and Molly over the next evening.  John sniggered at his own cleverness, meanwhile knowing his first thought was far more likely than the latter.
“If you have questions, find the answers yourself.  You always do.”  With a last withering look at Sherlock, John slammed the door behind him and marched out to the street.  Putting as much distance as he could between himself and that addle-brained idiot before he stormed back into the room and did something he regretted.
Annoyed, Sherlock closed his eyes; his impatience with the exercise spread through his body, his heel persistently tapping the roof beneath it.
I awake to the sound in my ear of a river rushing beneath me; it has a strong, soothing current, one which threatens to lull me back to sleep.  The water is warm, yet oddly, when I put my hand to the side of my face closest to it, it is not wet; I do not feel water.
John’s eyes drifted closed, and not wanting to overstay this new welcome, Sherlock gently placed John’s hand on his bed. About to bid John a good rest, before he could, the doorbell rang.
Somehow each question be harder to answer than the last.  Not because Laila did not know the answers, but because they meant a meeting between the past and the present, the past and the future.  And what that meeting might mean.
I am not moving, but I freeze anyway.  Maybe he is talking in his sleep, though I have never known him to do so.  I say nothing, hoping if I do not I will not wake him.
Looking at her monitors, she saw Sherlock snap closed his laptop and leave the bedroom. Moments later, he appeared on another screen, in this one, fetching his coat and swinging it on. With Rose by his side and a long glance at John, he left the house. Grabbing a hoodie, Andi typed out a quick message before racing after Sherlock.
John helps me, assisting me to properly angle my arms so the subject, I mean the baby, is fully supported.  He tucks the blanket here and there so I can see tiny little hands and a face with a nose and ears reminiscent of John’s.  And when little John and I are sufficiently situated, I start to relax.  Then, the oddest thing happens.  My body grows warm and it is as if the room glows.  Does his presence in my arms have magical powers?  I do not believe in such things, yet I am unsure what other explanation there can be.  Looking down at the tiny scrunched up face, I am in awe.  John is right, he
Sherlock would have been able to think of a few thousand reasons why, but he didn’t want to think about those right then. All he knew was that John was there, John was safe, and that he didn’t think he’d ever seen anything more beautiful.
Sherlock lifted John’s hand from his face and kissed the palm.  As he looked at John, his eyes held hunger and contentment as he gazed on the face that he could look upon for many lifetimes without ever getting bored.  Contradictory states of mind to be sure, but instead of dividing him, they complemented each other in a way that only served to make Sherlock whole.
a middle-aged man, and she wouldn’t be able to believe that what she had suggested hadn’t been shocking to him.
John’s smile tightens to the point it is almost a grimace.  My own heart racing, I have a desperate need to go over and hold his hand (that is, if I can pry it from the other), to tell him this bottom feeder is not worth the breath he will use to answer, but I stay rooted to my spot.
John started to chuckle, but managed no more than a “ha” before he sucked in a quick breath.  Righting himself, he said, “Christ, no one I hope; I have no desire to hold Cedric’s hand.  You be all right, love?”
But he should know by now to have more faith in his mercurial lover, after all they’d been together a lifetime now.  Well, at least the part of their lives that mattered.
Why had he cheated? John just didn’t know. Every day and every restless night for weeks on end, John had dug deep into himself, examining what he’d done. It hadn’t been because he was unhappy with Sherlock, of that he was sure. Yeah, they’d had the occasional tiffs, insignificant spats that flared up quickly and blew over just as fast. But despite their different approaches to life, there’d been nothing that had scarred the easy, natural rhythm they’d shared almost since they’d met. Living together, loving each other, was almost effortless. No, unhappiness wasn’t the problem.
With John finished examining me, I press my hand to the side of my face and moan again, trying to look as pitiful as I can.
“What happened? Why twas Eduard alone?” While he spoke, John bared Eduard’s chest to reveal a gash from which blood had stopped flowing.
His head cocks to the side.  He sees something in my face.  What, I do not know.  He studies me, settling on my eyes.  His lips part and his chest gently heaves.
John ran to the front of the hospital to find a cab; his discussion with Mary would have to wait.  Shoving out of the way a man about to step into an awaiting cab, John barked at the driver as he jumped into the back, slamming the door shut, “St. Bart’s!”
“Unlike thee.”  John found Sherlock’s hip bone, stroking its ridge with his thumb.  “Thou be long, and lean, and –”
A bundle thrust into his arms, Sherlock pulled the robe over his head and tightened the belt around his waist.
At first I am disappointed.  My lips do not burn as they did the first time I kissed him here; it was the balm after all.  But as I am not quick to move away, I find myself grow light-headed.  His skin is warm and soft, the tiny hairs there curious; I cannot help but reach my tongue out to touch it.  Just a little touch.  Just enough to see what he tastes like, if it is the same here as his mouth and lips.
Sherlock quirked a smile, his eyes shining with the knowledge he no longer felt the need to hide his love for John.
Meeting Sir John’s unflinching gaze, Sherlock saw something he wasn’t sure he had ever seen before.  And though he did not know what it was, he turned his back to Sir John, instinctively knowing he was putting himself in hands that would not hurt him.
“I’m right here, Sherlock.  But I don’t want to touch you; I don’t want you to have any more nightmares.”
He turned, taking a tentative step in the direction of Nika’s house, coming to a full stop and looking around him. Even at this late hour, the city hummed with activity. Lamps glowed in living rooms and bedrooms, shaping occupants into shadows, and workers changing shift walked the pavement. Sherlock looked up, a soft mist dampening his face, but the stars he sought hid behind clouds reflecting the city’s light.
most important, person in his life.  The face that in a few short years led him into more danger and ridiculous situations than any one person should be a part of in a lifetime. The face that made a life that once looked hopeless, hopeful and interesting.  No, more than interesting, Sherlock had made him feel
Simon shoved the thoughts aside so he could listen to what else Sherlock had to say; he would tend to the woman later.
is wrong with me,’ I say, my words clipped.  “I am reading up on a case Lestrade sent to me.  Is that quite all right with you?”
And though he knew what was coming, his unease grew as James walked robotically across the room. As she opened a window, allowing the vibrant sounds of the city to pour in. As she climbed to the sill and stood tall.
The last two days had been perfect, but they had sped by quickly.  Too quickly.  With Colin and Aldus at the blacksmith’s the greater part of the daylight hours, John and Sherlock had had the luxury of spending those two days, for the most part, alone. Together.  Two days tangled around each other’s bodies, slick with sweat.  Muffling the urgency of their passion.  Murmuring words of love and commitment that neither had ever before heard.  Or had ever wanted to say.
You don’t have to look at the goddamn things if you don’t want.  For me, love, please?”  Sigh.  “There you go, that’s good.  Beautiful!  Thank you, honey.”)
To Sherlock’s immense relief, the black cab, driverless as before, rolled near. Sherlock slumped into the passenger seat, his sense of impotence from not being able to help Mrs. Hudson almost unbearable, and he closed his eyes, determined to put the episode aside. Deep in his thoughts, Sherlock paid no notice to the cab’s peculiar means of travel, unaware that it was in motion until it plopped onto a snow-laden path near a cottage. The cottage Sherlock had lived in as a child.
“Mistaken identity?  Sherlock was remembering the incident the year before when the Ministry of Defense misidentified a soldier killed in action, only to find out they had made an error.  The family’s lawsuit was just now going to court.
I nod in approval; John can hold his own.  And not one vulgarity sprang from his mouth; I almost beam with pride at his restraint.
Sherlock carried his cup with him to his chair and sat down facing his friend; John had yet to acknowledge his presence.  Crossing his legs, he lifted his cup to his lips and took a sip.  As he looked at John, saw the emptiness in his eyes, saw the look of a man totally lost in the world, an ache deeper than he had ever known filled him.  Somehow his past attempts to merely keep John
Shifting in my seat to easily face him, I lay my head against the headrest.  And as I watch him, my heart swells with love for the face I have known a lifetime.  A well-worn face, full of honesty and compassion.
Attempting to look stern, Sherlock raised an eyebrow and glared, but he had not the fortitude to maintain the pretence.
sword?  Not if my life depended on it, and I assure you it would!’ my husband tells me later when I whine…I mean, thank him.), but it is a
So here I lie, basking in what little I am able to feel of John’s body, listening to him breath.  As the gentle sound washes over me I wonder how I possibly lived for 58 years without it; little makes my life more complete.  Despite this, I cannot sleep.  The mantel clock fills the quiet of the cottage…tick, tick, tick.  It is almost midnight.  Almost Christmas day.  In all my years I have awoken on Christmas day to nothing different from the day before, but for weeks John has been aglow with anticipation.  What he sees in the day, I have no idea.
When he opened it, he was looking at—well, John was looking at—John’s computer screen. In John’s periphery, Sherlock could see John’s hands on the keys appearing to pause as he thought what to type next into his blog. John’s gaze fixed on a blank patch of the wall, he picked up the mug from beside the laptop, taking a slow sip of what appeared to be tea and setting the mug down again.
“SHERLOCK!”  John yelled, throwing his hand up in the air, praying Sherlock would see him.  Hear him.
John picked his gun up off the patio from where Sherlock had dropped it, said a soft ‘I’m sorry’ under his breath, and with the butt of the gun connected it in a solid blow to the back of Sherlock’s head.  Sherlock’s head jerked, a low grunt the only sound he made before he swiftly dropped to the ground.   John caught the tall man as he fell and, with some difficulty given Sherlock’s dead weight, eased him the rest of the way to the pavement.
“Andi is MI-5. I played along with her assertion that she wasn’t, determining that I’d get more information by being purposely obtuse rather than butting heads with Mycroft. Anyway, Andi is the lead agent in the search for Simon, correctly, we can now see, assuming that there is a personal connection to either you or me. The head scientist, Dr. Strummer, should have been of assistance, but he was killed months ago. They said it was by suicide, but he had to have died by Simon’s hands. Strummer was Simon’s first, not James.”
“My… I don’t keep journals. I mean, Ella suggested I write a blog, which I do. So why would I keep journals, too?”
Once again you see but you do not observe.”  Sherlock stepped next to John and pointed at the motionless form, directing the doctor’s eyes to the middle of the body.  “Does that look like a woman who is about to give birth within the month?”
My face buried in his neck, I worry the inside of my lip, my breaths coming in short, quick puffs.  I purposely take a deep, long breath.  Whatever is to happen between us, I desire to be aware of every moment of it; losing consciousness is not an option.
John may not be right about everything, but he does have an excellent memory and he never lies to me.  Well, rarely ever.  And when he does, I can always tell.  Well, almost always.
Sitting on a bed of the rented room the men shared, Sherlock blocked out the exchange. While he did not look directly at him, every sense focused on John. Fluid and strong, John’s body appeared more powerful than his compact stature would attest to as he carried wood from the corner of the room, tossing it in the hearth. Twas warm enough outside, but the inside the old inn twas damp and musty, as if the walls had stored the cool air for centuries, releasing it for its new guests.
“What?”  Sherlock asked brusquely.  He really was tired of this, not to mention the fact that he was getting cold.
He turned his attention to where Sherlock explained what happened that day.  The detective swept his hands in an arc along an imaginary line on the roof’s floor.
“Colin, I swear.” Aldus grabbed the boots, muttering as Colin urged him to move faster, “I can put on my own shoes.  Leave me be.”
“The invitation is to a wedding reception.  Katie’s best friend Maeve is getting married this weekend.  It only just came because she didn’t realise I was living here now.  I was enjoying the scent of it because it reminded me of that case we were on a long time ago.  You remember, the one where you figured out it was the mistress who murdered the husband because of the perfume on his handkerchief.  It’s the same scent.”
Jumping to his feet, Colin positioned his body into his most manly stance; twould do no good for his brother to think him soft.  His hands braced on his hips, and his feet spread apart, he scowled.
I cannot unbutton our shirts fast enough.  I need to feel his skin on mine.  I need to feel his heart beating against me with nothing between us but….us.
“You’ll be fine, just fine, right here. Sit,” Angelo says, eyeing me curiously and blowing out the flickering candle. “John will forgive you. Your spat will blow over, poof, like it never happened. You’ll see.”
“Yes, it is.  Not that I be unconcerned about your safety, but does thou think I will be separated from thee so easily?  No, Sherlock, I am thine, if thou will have me.  Where thou goes, I go.”  John cupped Sherlock’s face.  “I love thee.”
And standing, he retrieved John’s laptop and cord to take with him, pausing at the door to read the text arriving from Mycroft.
I cannot help it.  I peak back to look at the door.  The door to the room that holds John.  The door to the room that I spent the last two nights, the two happiest nights of my life.
I see I was gravely mistaken in my estimation of his devotion to me, but I will be brave.  I will show him how little it bothers me.
“Even for you, Mycroft, that is a bit cruel. Now, what did you drag me out here for?” Sherlock glanced back through the doors to Recovery in the off chance he could catch a glimpse of John. He could not. And when Sherlock returned his attention to Mycroft, his brother’s face was devoid of expression, as if he were waiting for Sherlock to catch up.
“I do not think so,” John said. “I wish you could see him the times he be around you; tis not that he has not forgiven you, but that he be overwhelmed by what you did for him. I assure you, Sherlock knows you did it out of love and not because you did not care for him.  It does not come easily to him to express sentiment.”
Anger draining from him, John collapsed into himself.  And with a weary sigh, he asked, “Why?”  Knowing full well Sherlock would have the answer.  And that, no matter what, he would not like the answer.
“Twas a cut on his belly; I saw it when he changed out of his bloody clothes.  But I did not confront him; he would have come up with a clever lie. I decided to wait for more proof before saying anything.  You said Eduard and I had similar features; I did not give it pause until I saw Cedric had affections for thee.  And when the knife appeared that night in your tent?  That is when it came to me that Cedric killed Eduard to place blame on me so that I would be arrested, or that you would send me away.  Anything that would put distance between us.  He be jealous of our friendship.  Of our…of our…”
Several miles into their journey, John cautiously broached the subject that so quickly built a wall between them.  With little time left for them to be together, they needed to tear it down; it couldn’t be allowed to become insurmountable.  Any other option was simply unacceptable.
I remember the first time I called him an idiot; it was the first time we worked a case together.  Though I meant it relative to my own brilliance, he took it as an offence.  Thereafter, I occasionally said it because he knew I did not mean it in its truest sense.  He would laugh and I could not help but laugh with him; his laughter made me feel warm inside. But that was years ago.  What does it mean now when I say it?
Finished reading the proclamation, the Crier began to count down the seconds until the hanging was to occur.  The last seconds of Sherlock’s life.
Propping himself up onto his elbows, Sherlock turned his head in the direction from which the voice had come and was faced with a smiling John. Sat in a chair, John propped his newly plastered leg up on an ottoman.
Eduard’s preparation complete, John watched through hooded lids as Sherlock and Aldus readied themselves to treat Sherlock’s back. Whilst Aldus retrieved the mazer and brought a chair over behind Sherlock, much as John had done earlier, Sherlock tossed his tunic to the side.  Next went the shirt.
Sherlock sucked in a deep breath of air, holding tightly to it lest it escape him and he never find another.
He thinks he is amusing, but I am not persuaded by his anecdotal analysis of the hazards of tea drinking.
She cringed at her reference to Sherlock and tossed the mobile into her bag.  Taking one last look at her image in the mirror, she couldn’t help but think she didn’t look half bad for a woman almost nine months pregnant.
How had they overlooked that one? It’d be easy enough; they had traced Rose’s commands to a device at the employee entrance. They could start there. Turning to Hawthorne, before she could tell him to procure a couple of canines, she heard her name. Sherlock.
“And here you are.” John clasped his hands together on his lap as if he had all the time in the world.
At Mary’s desperate request he call ‘John’, Leonid scrambled through her bag for her mobile; it was difficult to search for it while he tried to comfort her.  Finally grabbing ahold of it he shoved it into his pocket, freeing his hand to reach for the cool, wet towel a waiter brought him; the call he needed make quickly dropped from his mind.  ‘Chyort voz’mi!’ (shit!).  He should never have let her leave him, no matter what she said.  He should have spent his days trying to find her, not drowning himself in alcohol.
I think about it.  How embarrassing can it be? I ask myself.  It was years ago and it has no relevance to my life now.  I decide to tell him.  We’ll have a good laugh and go back to reading.  I lick my lips; they’re dry.
Stopping at a busy intersection, when the light turned green, Spencer moved the vehicle forward at a pace that puzzled Sherlock; instead of accelerating, it was as if Spencer had merely lifted his foot from the brake, letting the vehicle choose its own speed. And when, after what seemed a painfully long time, the vehicle rolled to a complete stop in the middle of the intersection, vehicles buzzing past.
And so, Sherlock had retreated back into the night, restless, lost.  He had gone back to the park. He had gone back to the bench where he had last seen John’s eyes shine. Had last been reminded of the understated elegance in how he moved—
Smart girl.  Doesn’t try to push him.  Looking at her long text, I can just imagine how her thumbs must have been a blur.  She’s not unlike Sherlock in that respect.
(I appreciate John’s restraint in overriding the top of the list.  He said that though it is not my job to make him happy, when he saw ‘Make John Happy’ on the list every five to ten lines, he knew what appears to make
John rolls towards me and rests an arm on my chest. His head lies on my shoulder and a blanketed leg reaches over and nudges itself between my uncovered ones.  I do not know how he can be comfortable; it must be like snuggling a board.  He is not complaining and he does not move, so I must trust his judgment that it is good enough for him.
Feeling the inexpensive paper against his fingertips, he debated opening the envelope and once again reading the brief letter, something he had not done in many months.  But there really was no need; he knew by heart every letter, every punctuation mark within as if they were seared onto the very surface of his brain, never to be erased.  Letters and words that, despite their unequivocal message, he at first hadn’t believed, wouldn’t believe.  But as the second hands on the clock ticked slowly through time that at some point ceased to have meaning, Sherlock knew that what John said had been true; never again would he see the man who had become the beat of his heart.
Sherlock looked, and leaned in to get a closer look; twas not the poor light that caused him to at first miss it.
His head fuzzy from lack of air, he pulled back to catch his breath and as he did so he heard a soft voice in his ear say “Happy New Year, John”.  What the fuck?!   She was a bloke!  And just how in the hell did she know his name?
“That’s not Mycroft.” Sherlock tightened the folds of his dressing gown against his body, but they couldn’t stave off the chill that had nothing to do with being cold. “He’s had his struggles, but he would never allow himself to become so rotund. This man must weigh six hundred pounds.”
I grab my phone from the table and revive my internet search for Dr. Watson. Practically shoving the phone into Sherlock’s face, I show him a picture. It’s a zoomed on photograph of Dr. Watson’s enraptured face. Enraptured because he’s gazing at Sherlock.
John shut his eyes; he be tired, so tired.  “You saved Aldus; he would likely not be alive be it not for you.  You fitted Sherlock’s suit and helped us catch Cedric.  You—you gave Sherlock and me the gift of time.  These be no small things.  I know twas for Sherlock and not for me, still, I benefited, as well.  Greatly.  So, thank you.”  He pasted a wan smile on his face.
have to put everything in your mouth, you stupid git!”, grabbing Sherlock’s wrist and yanking it down from his mouth.
Sherlock put his hands up. “If you look closely, you’ll see that Agent Rasperson has the gun; it would be imprudent of you to consider me a threat to her. Now, if you don’t mind, I have other, more pressing matters to attend to.”
Resting a hand on her arm, he arched down so she could see him more comfortably. “John’s had a rough go of it. The accident was serious, yes, but he’s getting the best of care, and I will tell him that you send your best. I’ve no doubt that will help rally him, and I promise I will get him home as soon as possible.”
He saw Sherlock practically press his nose up to the screen, peering at it as though John was mere inches away from him.
John nodded, a small, weary gesture that tugged at Sherlock’s heart.  His eyes drifting closed, John breathed out “Ily,” as his head lolled to the side.
"Light or non, we must set forth. If all goes well you soon be back in your bed." Sir John picked up an outer garment lying nearby and a pair of shoes that looked to be the right size and tossed them on Aldus' prone form. "Now, up with you."
“Someone breached the house. They stole the chip.” He could see from her face there was no need to explain the repercussions. He leaned over her, intent on the screens. “These are in real time?”
By the time John sat down and glanced over, Sherlock awkwardly held Laila in a loose embrace, taking tentative steps in time with the music.
He would have liked to blame his lack of arousal on the strong ale he had drank, but he knew twas not the problem. Twas the vexing servant who rattled him so.
“It is nothing, John.  I am fine.”  Not waiting for an answer when I ask “Ready to go?”, I disengage from him though it is the last thing I want to do.  I want to wrap him in my arms, hold him tightly to me, and never let go.
“No.” The heavy air swallowed Sherlock’s grief; the deep snow muffled his despair. He couldn’t look at Stamford, couldn’t bear to see the pity that was sure to be in his eyes. “It can’t be true. He was with me that night. He shot the cabbie.”
“Stop being so puritanical and go back to sleep, John.  Your body uses less energy when you’re asleep.”
“Where does thou go?” John asked, dismayed, but he did not have to wait for an answer; twas but a moment before it became exceedingly clear where Sherlock went.  And why.  John, already half-erect, swelled further at the thought of Sherlock’s sinfully luscious mouth on him.
“Don’t be ridiculous. How can I miss someone I see every day?” Sherlock sips the last of his wine and reaches for his outerwear. “Best be off, shall we?”
I awake with a start.  The room is dark and John is not beside me. Where did he go?  Looking at the clock, it reads 1:13.
Before he could take a step, he froze.  His chest heaving, for the second time that day he struggled to breath.
?”  He glares at me.  (I did not allow him enough sleep.  Two hours short equals three outbursts.  I do hope he gets them out of the way so I can enjoy my day.)
. And certainly not now. Though she shouldn’t be surprised; he no doubt needed to take action as soon as possible.
“Looks like he just died in his sleep.  Looks right serene to me, I can’t imagine someone thought it was murder.  Wouldn’t mind goin’ like that myself someday.”  He almost looked wistful at the thought of leaving the world so quietly.
“Yes, of course, you can.  Kind of comes as a surprise to me, too, that I said that, but it feels right, Sherlock.  You are the love of my life and there’s no one,
This time there’s no need to guess at Sherlock’s meaning, he’s got that cute little lopsided smile thing going on.  His eyes smile, too.
He rolls over, his bum sticking out at me.  Even under the covers I can see it is a nice bum, rounded and very firm for a man of his advanced age.  Reaching back toward me, he takes my hand and pulls it toward him gently, bringing the rest of me with it.
“She lives this way,” Sherlock said, slowing his long strides as he realised he left the shorter man behind. Turning a corner onto a pathway so narrow even were he and John moving at the same pace, twas not enough room for them to walk side by side. The house fronts mere steps apart from each other, a gulley in the path carrying the stench of urine and excrement.
I look at John, puzzled.  “What do you mean ‘who is he’?  There is no ‘he’.  And please, John, keep your voice down.”
The girl stared back at him, unafraid.  Her hostility grew; the resentment she felt at being pushed around by one more man stoked the fire raging in her.  She couldn’t know this one wasn’t like the rest, that he wouldn’t try to take something from her she hadn’t offered.  Yes, she had just killed someone, but the john had deserved it.  Sodomy was not on the menu… prostitute or not, she had the right to say how her body was used.
Dressed in corduroys, loafers, and a hoodie that shielded his face, Sherlock pushed his hands into his pockets.  He sat in the back row of chairs in the small room at the community hall.
“Strong and steady.  And if you also remember, I said ‘a hundred lifetimes is not enough’, so we have at least 99 to go.  I’m not going anywhere a second sooner than I have to, bucket list or not.  And you better not, either.”
‘My’ bed?  When did it become ‘my’ bed?  I thought it was ‘our’ bed now.  Has he so quickly tired of me and kicked me out, sending me back to the hinterlands of my old room?
‘John loves you ALL THE TIME’, the reminder all I need to make myself feel nominally alive again.  Not as happily as if John is here, but it strengthens me enough to get to work.
No one but John would have noticed that at that moment, Sherlock’s confidence wavered.  His eyes darkened and, almost imperceptibly, his face slackened, easing his angular features.  The change be just enough that John knew that for whatever reason Sherlock be arrested, twas egregious and likely true.
?”  Cedric locked eyes with Sherlock.  The sound of rain pelting the ground filled the air, waiting for one of them to speak.
When John joins me by the fire I cup his face in my hands, giving him a peck on the lips.  “I love you, John.”  And while I still feel anxious that John’s bucket list will soon be complete, I make the effort to push the thought aside.  I will live in
“Go on. I’m listening,” Sherlock said. “I just want to check on Rose.” Swiping his thumb across his mobile’s screen, Sherlock resumed the video where he’d stopped, keeping the sound low. He watched as Andi realized Rose was at her side, concluding it was Simon who had sent Rose in.
I cannot bring myself to say ‘yes’, to verbally agree to exile myself from him for one minute more. John will have to read into my silence whatever he will.
It had not been the first time he had committed such an act. Before, it had been an act of servitude at the behest of a greedy elder servant, a man who took advantage of his youth and sold his “commodities” to traveling noblemen. Twas why he had not wanted to stay at the inn John had first chosen. It had been where he had “worked” and where he had honed his skills- his body engaged, his thoughts far away.
“And it be not for Aldus,” Colin said.  “He will not leave Aldus; he be his squire.  But more so, he will not leave
Like on Bonfire Night not long after our first anniversary, when we went to Caerphilly Castle to watch the fireworks.  I am not much for such celebrations (Please forgive me, but how abysmally ridiculous a notion is it to ‘celebrate’ the failed Gunpowder Plot with explosives.  From the minds of simpletons…), but John enjoys it (No, I am
In the cab on the way to Sherlock’s flat they didn’t talk about what had happened to John, about why he had not sought Sherlock out when he’d come home, about why he had allowed Sherlock to continue to believe he was dead.
Aldus shrugged.  “I am not a child, Cedric.  I know tis not popular to share an opinion that does not align with the Church, but tis what I think.”
“I do not know, then.  He be out late last night and left early this morn.  I be glad you be here; he has been distracted.  I think it unwise that he will joust, but he be determined, and he will be no good at all if he cannot concentrate.”
Sherlock nodded at John, silently telling him to stay.  Begrudgingly, the detective moved into the empty corridor, where he could still see John and Molly through the window.
“I think…I think what you say may be true.  I know it is incomprehensible for a person such as I to engage in such a base emotion, but I… just may be in love with you.”
“Thank you.” John looked at Sherlock as if waiting to be interrupted again. And when he wasn’t, he started talking. “For a few months, I’ve been going to the Ram’s Head once or twice a week. It’s an out of the way place that I’m pretty sure I won’t, I mean, I wouldn’t see anyone I would know. I was, uh, I just wanted to be alone, and they left you alone there; it isn’t one of those pubs where everyone knows everyone. It’s a place where no one
Thinking back to that little black and yellow book, I am grateful for it.  We had long known that sex is so much more than a physical act, but somehow since studying the book it is as if our whole life has become about making love.  In both body and spirit.  Giving time and thought to each other in ways we had not before.   I cannot say it is an unpleasant way to live life.
It was as if the whole of his body flushed with pleasure. His hand reached for his neck, tracing the path John’s fingers had taken earlier. John, touching him…
Simon answered his mobile before the ring ended and put it on speaker. “I don’t want you playing any tricks on me.” Glancing at John, he added, “I haven’t hurt Watson, and I won’t, just as long as you’re straight with me and help me get me what I want.”
She paced back and forth in front of the mobile, nibbling at a fingernail, debating whether to listen to the message. But did she really have a choice? He knew where she lived, where she worked, and he was associated with some of the most powerful people in the world.
“Why?  Would you like to copulate with me?  Shag me?  Fuck me?”  I am shocked at how easily his words roll off my tongue.
When Sherlock felt assured John would sleep through the night, he quietly rose and tucked the blanket securely around John.  He did not want to leave; after all, had he not told John he would not?  But, though appearances did not matter to Sherlock, they did to John, and he did not want to give anyone cause for idle talk.
No, he was done.  They would divorce.  But not before ensuring he had fair access to his daughter, or better yet, custody.
His name called as the next to compete, John leapt into action; twas time to hobble his horse.  They could not risk Sherlock being obligated to joust.  Thrusting his hand into the pocket deep in the folds of his cloak, John withdrew a slim blade, and giving Jocelyn’s rump an apologetic stroke, he whispered to her, “Forgive me, Jocelyn.”  As he crouched down at her hoof, she stretched her neck to look back at him with mild curiosity, and before she had time to draw her leg away, he dug the knife into the hide above her coronet, scoring a long gash. She squealed in protest, jerking her leg up, but she did not kick him.  Not giving himself time to regret his betrayal of the loyal and hard-working horse, he unwound the cloth he had hidden in his other pocket and wrapped it around her wound.
Both men fell silent, reflecting on the implications of what Sherlock said.  If John’s deftness be compromised, it meant he could not joust in the tournament.  No tournament meant no prize money.  And no prize money meant no cottage in Germany.  At least not any time soon.
Oomph. The vehicle tires providing little cushion, the black cab landed with a stiff thump. They had arrived.
“Right.” Sherlock practically tripped over himself, rushing to sweep 221B’s door wide, letting John through. “Who told you I was here? Mycroft, I presume. He has a disturbing need to follow my every move.”
“We’ve not yet determined the identity of the subject,” Andi said, pulling herself back to Dr. Juma. Whatever was causing the ruckus could wait. “Dr. Strummer went to unusual lengths to conceal the identity of Operation Eclipse’s Person #1. I did, after extensive efforts, recover this photo. We’ve run it through every database to find a match, from Scotland Yard to local constabularies to the three military organizations and the DVLA, but we’ve come up empty handed. It’s almost as if he never existed.”
Despite what John saw on the internet, he seemed to remember only that Sherlock was a friend of a friend. Sherlock hadn’t much experience with having a friend, but he was fairly certain that a person didn’t spill all of one’s secrets the moment one met them. He and John were friends—or at least they had been before the accident—and even they withheld information from each other. It hadn’t been necessary to do more.
Putting his shoes back on, Lestrade hauled himself up, his weariness making him a little unsteady on his feet.  Looking through the glass walls of his office to the workroom floor, he saw his staff huddling in groups of two or three, nodding at their computer screens, pointing at the TV in the far corner of the room.   The looks on their faces to a man, and woman, were ones of bewilderment.
“I’ll be off then. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” The tip of Mycroft’s umbrella tapped the linoleum in perfect sync with his footsteps as he walked away.
How did I miss this, me being in love?  I am The Most Observant Man in the World and I did not see I am in love with John?  There had to have been clues.  Relief courses through me.
“The time may come when you are not.  On the side of precaution here is an untraceable mobile.  I have taken the liberty of deactivating your mobiles and entering your primary contacts into these.  Your personal mobile number remains the same.  We do not want to arouse suspicion if there is no contact between you and say, Inspector Lestrade. And here is a matching mobile for Dr. Watson.  It truly is a miracle his location has not already been traced.”
He went over and stood by Sherlock, who proceeded to bend and contort him like a human Gumby. He had long gotten used to being Sherlock's personal guinea pig and for the most part trusted Sherlock wouldn't go far enough to permanently damage him, so he shut up and waited to see where it was going. Occasionally he had to huff and puff to get enough air, after all, he DOES have lungs that need a certain amount of expansion and contraction so he can actually....breathe.
I wave my hand at him, shooing him toward the loo andshuffling the papers as if finding my lost spot, excitement surging through me as I mentally poise for a quick exit.
“Are you all right?” he asked, holding onto her arms and peering into her face. And when she breathed again, her head slowly moved toward him, and she looked at him, nodding.
When John stepped in front of Sherlock, Sherlock held out his arms. “Show me what I be doing wrong.”
I continue to be mesmerized by the body touching mine.  Truly, I wish John had introduced me to this novel approach to cuddling weeks ago!  I heave a sigh, relishing the feel of him.  As I look at the flesh in front of me I cannot help but touch a finger to one of his nipples; it hardens at the merest contact.  Fascinating.
Sherlock gives his heart to few… me, Katie, John John, but when he does it’s one of the most glorious things I’ve ever seen.
“Erm, and Rose,” he said again, trying to sound like someone who wasn’t about to lose it. Someone worth taking seriously.
But Simon’s titter caught in his throat as he watched the two men. Though they had yet to consummate their obsession, their love for each other was obvious, each about to bust out of their seams in their need for each other. He had seen it time and time again in the months he had recorded Dr. Watson’s memories.
Hearing the door open behind him, Sherlock turned just enough to see John emerge from the roof’s outlet.
“Ahhh, I suppose it is,” Sherlock said.  “Thou be right; I cannot give thee children.  And thou be a childless father.  How stupid of me to think that it no longer be something for which thou longed.”
“Are you finding my house comfortable, Dr.? We tried to leave as much as we could so that it’s functional.”
It wasn’t uncommon for someone with a concussion to have some amnesia, but John’s symptoms didn’t align with any he’d ever come across, nor did they fit with the casual research he’d done: his memory loss didn’t go back to the accident, it went back months before that. The extended time frame, that’s what disturbed him most.
The purse be stout in Sherlock’s palm.  His relief at the tentative connection to John be replaced by a discontentment greater than he had had before the girl came.
“Too much data. There’s a device to read it and—I don’t know, wires and stuff—to connect it to your laptop. A backup wasn’t created, so there’s no need to tell you to be extremely careful.”
Never one to indulge in self-pity before he went to war, John now found himself in a daily struggle with it.
.  There has to be some other reason Cedric ran.”  The anguish on Aldus’s face made him look iller than when he had gone to lie down.
That wasn’t quite true, was it, John realized.  He had always thought Sherlock’s desire for his company was in the capacity of helpmate, someone to tag along after him and be a sounding board for his brilliance.  But it was more than that.  Looking back, from the beginning it had been about more than tolerance; at no time was it more apparent than when Sherlock had helped plan the wedding.  The thought of Sherlock folding all those buggering linens almost made John laugh.
Having seen Mycroft off, Mum approached Sherlock. “Leave him be, dear. John needs some time to sort it on his own.  From what Mycroft told me he’s had some difficult things to deal with today.”
I do not know what comes next; I will trust John to guide us.  The only thing that matters to me is that John is back in my arms.  Where he belongs.
Jerking up her head, the look Andi saw on Dr. Juma’s face told her that this wasn’t the first time she had said Andi’s name. “Yes, Dr. Juma. So sorry.” She opened the portfolio on her lap and, slipping out some papers, did her best to hide her tremble as she handed them over. “If I could just have a few minutes with you—”
“No!  God no!”   He lowers his voice as he realises his volume has exceeded what is acceptable in the ‘quiet car’.  I do not understand why he agrees with me with such vehemence when it was he who made the suggestion, but I am relieved.
.  He knew there would be times the mere knowledge of John’s existence would be the only thing to keep him alive.
Colin beamed, and, as if he realised how indelicate his smile be in the circumstances, he let it fall flat.  “You be welcome.”
I lick my lips.  “I, well, I… It was one of the days you went to Cardiff and I feared you were not coming back.”
“Shite!” Merek cried, jerking his foot back in pain, almost toppling over.   “What the bloody ‘ell?”
Scanning the empty path before them as they drew farther and farther away from their camp, disappointment filled Sir John; he would not see Sherlock again. Ready to tell his men it was time to turn back, he spotted a figure up ahead, its steps faltering. Yes, was Sherlock. Sir John's heart stuttered. He thought how weak Sherlock must be to have taken so long to travel such a short distance. Picking up Jocelyn's pace until he reached him, Sir John measured her pace with Sherlock.
He turned his computer off and went to bed, sleepless for hours as he lay on the regulation mattress.
“I am experimenting.  I like it when you call me ‘love’; I often wonder what it sounds like with your name attached.  Do you like it?”
Mary swore as her eyes locked briefly with Mycroft’s.  It didn’t occur to her she would see anyone she knew at the restaurant; she didn’t run in society circles.  As coolly as she could, her eyes continued moving past Mycroft as if his was just another face in the crowd. Squeezing the hand she still held, she whispered across the table, “I’m so sorry, love, I’m not feeling well.  Do you mind if we go?”  For added effect she smoothed her maternity blouse across her stomach and grimaced as if a sudden pain hit her.
Colin laughed, a deep “ha!” that told her that he indeed be happy at the thought of having a sibling.  Laila knew he had always been disappointed that he had no brothers or sisters.  As a boy, he had had no one to play games with when she would not let him go outside.  As a fatherless young man, no one to share the burden of an ailing mother.
Gareth bit back a giggle though twas no one to hear him on the sparsely traveled road.  Nearly a week it has been, and he still be giddy.
I feel a hand reach under the front of my shirt to lie flat on my belly.  Another is roaming slowly, slowly along the entirety of my back.  And the lips and tongue that have commandeered my existence?  They continue to enslave me as they kiss me, suck me, and trail along the small of my back.
At that moment the door opened.  I pulled back quickly, hoping the nurse hadn’t seen, but instead, in walked Mrs. Hudson with Katie.  Shite!  I forgot I called and asked Mrs. Hudson to bring Katie here, that I wouldn’t be at home.  My entire body flushed in self-consciousness, and clearing my throat, I stood up straight, shifting my hand to Sherlock’s wrist as if taking his pulse.
“I sent the letters because of you.”  Mycroft, frustrated with his dim-witted brother, practically spat out the words.  “You were so distracted by your infatuation with, or shall I say…
Our wine soon arrives, and we settle into the business of romance, the next hours showing me what an exceptional pupil I have under my tutelage. Whether due to a steady flow of wine or to the commitment to my expertise, Sherlock not only warms to my touch and my endearments but quickly learns to mirror them. And occasionally take the lead. I have to say, he is a most charming companion; I have not been quite so titillated, nor have I giggled so much, in quite some time.
“Tell me again what we’re doing?” John asked, looking as if he might nod off before he finished the question.
“Morning breath, Sherlock,” he mumbles against my lips.  I ignore him, what is a little bacterium between lovers?  It is not as if we do not share the same air on a daily basis.
?!  I should have done this the day he moved in, if it makes him so happy.  Maybe he can move back in and immediately move back out.  He’ll be ecstatic.
“Be sure to put those in your pocket,” he said, nodding at the cuffs and key in John’s hand.  I think we will be needing those again.”
Without hesitancy, John took the final step to Sherlock, tilted his head up to the face that was already reaching down towards his and closed his eyes.  This might be his one and only chance to kiss Sherlock and he didn’t want any of the outside world interrupting this unbelievable moment.
This is how it came to John’s attention that Sherlock had started to talk in his sleep.  When it first started John thought his flatmate was just thinking out loud.
“You have it wrong, Sherlock. Well, she is safe from him, but she’s not doing well. She wasn’t able to recover any money from him, as you did for her before having him arrested. After Frank was murdered, authorities confiscated the money, the house. Everything. She was left with nothing.”
“Com’on Sherlock, I told you what I want to do.   How bad can it be?  I promise not to laugh.  Scouts honour.”  He holds up his fingers in an oath.
“I be not going anywhere,” Sherlock repeated.  “Not to joust, not to live with my family.  How can thou think that John?”  Lifting John’s hand, he kissed each finger, savouring each of them one by one.  “Sir John,” he said softly, meeting John’s eyes.  “Does thou think I could ever part from thee?”
I look at John, confused.  “But, I am too old to be a pirate.”  Even as I say this, I rip the ribbon off the box and lift the lid, revealing a billowing white blouse, ragged black trousers, and a tricorn hat, amongst other paraphernalia appropriate for the properly attired pirate. There is even a sword.  True, it is plastic (‘You think I would give you a
Sherlock frowned at John.  It should not be so difficult to say, but the sentiment attached to it made it hard for him to get the words out.
I puff up with pride; the day has not yet officially begun and I have already achieved #1 on my Pail List- Make John Happy.  I clearly am a master at any task I undertake.
He is lifting his eyebrows, as if trying to tell me something more.  I am not quite sure what.  It does not matter; I like looking at his eyes.  They are such a deep blue, and even when he is angry they look at me in such a way…
will be the death of me.”  John rolled, pressing himself along the length of Sherlock’s body, bringing them closer together for a languid kiss.  John melted, certain he could be quite happy the rest of his days if he never left the cradle of this man’s arms.
Sherlock started to say something; his mouth fell open, but instead of speaking, he took a small bite of potato.
Walking back into the dining room to join her companion, she smiled widely, her face alight with a glow that could not be attributed to her pregnancy.
Even to himself, Sherlock had trouble articulating the ache inside caused by the absence of the John he knew. The John with whom Sherlock had shared an easy camaraderie that, since the day they had met, Sherlock had always been able to depend upon
The private compartment of the limousine was kept at an exact 21° C, warm enough that Sherlock needed to remove his coat, laying it on the empty seat beside him.  He leaned his head back on the headrest and closed his eyes.  He was just as happy not to have to talk; Mycroft was reading e-documents, taking occasional notes on the yellow pad laying on the small table top that pulled out of the seat between him and Anthea, and Anthea was absorbed with her Blackberry in between making corrections on the notes Mycroft handed her.
“And what do you conclude?”  John asked gently, unable to fault Sherlock for being exactly as God designed him.
“Aren’t you going to be late for your dinner reservations?” Dr. Watson looms nearby, and the steel in his voice tells me that I have outstayed my welcome. Not that I believe there
Clasping her hands together and resting her chin atop them, Laila recited the Lord’s Prayer.  And when she was done, she gave herself permission to pour out her heart out to Him.
Dropping the brochure off the side of the bed, he rolls toward me, his firm thighs pressing into mine as he brushes his hand through my hair, his fingers winding through my curls.   “Christ, I always wondered what these felt like.  I can’t tell you how many times those first years I dreamed of touching them like this.”
Sherlock did not know which annoyed him more, that Colin spoke to him with such familiarity or that he felt he knew so much about him and John.   Sherlock knew he himself had faith in John, but why would John not have faith in him?
As John sat reading the paper, he couldn’t help but let his mind wander back to the mistletoe.  He knew his first thought had been that Sherlock had put it there for an experiment, but…he knew that Sherlock was even more ignorant of, and less interested in, non-human living organisms than he was of astronomy.  And as far as he knew, there was no current case that would call for the examination of the oxygenation of mistletoe, or its hydro genic properties, or whatever unimaginable thing Sherlock might want to discover about a plant that makes an appearance only once a year.
“Sir John, please go; tell him yourself.  He has asked for you to be there.”  Colin rested his hand on John’s shoulder.  “He needs you.”
Mr. Abernathy lived in the countryside outside Cardiff in what he came to believe was a haunted house. He requested I live in the house with him for a month to prove he was not insane. He said I needed to live in the house that length of time before the ghost felt comfortable with my presence and would reveal itself.
Closing his eyes, John felt Sherlock resume his exploration, pulling down John’s jeans and pants just enough to give him easy access, the wished for extra fingers now a reality.  A large palm wrapped around him, the sensation bringing him to a full erection.  His own hand still resting on Sherlock’s crotch, he felt his flatmate’s erection nudge the satin bottoms, twitching toward him.
“No.  Tis enough, Cedric.  I will listen to no more absurdity.  Sherlock is but man who was in need of our assistance and we will continue providing that assistance until we arrive in London.  I have already arranged for him to travel with us.  We…”  John cleared his throat.  “I came to the conclusion that Gareth, whoever he may be, thought Eduard was Sherlock and that is why he killed him.  They look convincingly alike, of this you cannot disagree.”
“We’re as well as can be, Mycroft. Thank you for asking. Off to America in three days’ time. Moving, in fact.” Nika shook his outstretched hand, noting how, not unreasonably, he had changed in the intervening years. A little less hair, a little more tummy, a little less upright. And most surprisingly, a little less haughty, as though life had taught him that he didn’t have quite as much control over it as he had thought.
John snatched his mobile from his pocket and called emergency services.  Taking off his jacket, he tore his shirt off as quickly as he could, bunching it up and pressing it firmly to the wound in Sherlock’s chest.  He had to staunch the blood flow, had to stop the life from pouring out of the slender body lying on the floor.
“Let’s get back inside; I don’t want you to catch pneumonia,” John says, disentangling himself.  I take a last look around the roof, resigned for the moment that we may never know what happened here.  Take one last look at the pastoral scene beyond the cottage before I follow him.
“Mr. Holmes, I no longer have any connection to the MOD or the PTSD research.” She watched out the window as she spoke; it made it easier to think without Mr. Holmes’s hawkish face looking at her, as always, as if she were somehow wanting. “It was born from an exciting discovery, but I have long moved on, and the program itself has morphed into a travesty of what it should have been. People are dying because of it, and while I’m grateful for what you did for me, I have paid my debt. I want no part—”
“Thank God the authorities actually checked out what you told them.  If they hadn’t…I don’t even want to think about it; I was so fucking scared when they arrested you.”  Clouding over, his eyes lock them with mine.  "I can't lose you honey.  It's not even an option."
The hurt on Sherlock’s face made John ache to tell Sherlock that he be all John needed to be happy.  Made John want to kiss away Sherlock’s fears, to hold him in his arms and tell him everything would be all right.  But everything would not be all right, would it?  If, by some miracle, Sherlock came through the joust unscathed, then he would leave to seek his family.  And if Sherlock did find them, how would John fit into that setting?  No, twas better for Sherlock to think John wanted children.  Twas best to start the break now.
John stood with Sherlock in the bedroom of the small flat, his arms folded tightly across his chest.  His left hand clenched into a fist under the fold.
Ella scribbled in her notebook, and when she looked up, Sherlock leaned back quickly from where he’d been trying to read her writing.
“You felt betrayed, and yet you saw fit to forgive me. Not only recommencing our friendship but soon agreeing to marry me. Correct?”
“Trouble me?  No.  Whoever Sherlock is, or whatever he does, it does not affect me; I have a duty, as do you, and that be to serve Sir John.  Sherlock’s presence does not change that, and anyway, he will be gone soon.  When we get to London, we will part ways.
We have come to bed early.  It is at my suggestion after complaining we did not get our usual morning cuddle time.
And Sherlock didn’t want to ask, didn’t need to ask.  He had seen the haunted look in John’s eyes, the limp, the jagged scars at the edge of his hairline and on his jaw, and though he hadn’t seen the pictures Mycroft had spoken of, he could only imagine the horrors John had gone through.   A rage started to build in him that anyone had dared touch this good man in such a way.
I move next to him, close enough to hear him breathing, close enough that should one us move we would brush against each other.  (You look so sad, John; what do you need?  How can I make you feel better?)  For once, being the smartest person does me no good; I have no idea how to comfort John.
“Just as I was about to inflict the mortal wound, Laila rushed into the hall.  ‘William!  What be you doing?!’  I told her the servant had defiled her name, that I be defending her honour.  And before she could stop me I struck my dagger to his chest and he dropped to the ground.  Laila ran over and fell to her knees beside him, pressing her hands to the wound to stop the bleeding.  Twas all the proof I needed that she loved him and had been unfaithful to me. ‘Whores be not welcome in my home!’ I shouted at her.  I pulled her up from the floor by her hair.  As I dragged her to the door, she pleaded with me, but what she said I did not know, so engulfed with fury was I.  I never saw her again.”
!  My daughter is standing right here!”  I glare at him, unable to truly be angry; like a child, he often says whatever pops into his head.  “Filter, Sherlock.”
Standing in the car park, John’s head is turned away from me to admire the country inn, its expanse of wrap-around porch perfectly complementing the white clapboards and black shutters.  Beyond it, everywhere we look are multi-hued trees, a kaleidoscope of colours that would be impossible to imagine had one not seen them.
“Ok, if you want to help, be my guest.”  His eyebrows knit together, clearly dismayed at my refusal of his kiss.
Sherlock collapsed further into himself, desperate to shield himself from the incomprehensible madness he’d found himself in.

I apologize if this bothers you.
I am languid and content as I finish my shower, only half surprised John has not stormed in to make sure I did not ‘waste’ my orgasm on behalf of my prostate.  Still puzzling over what I saw in his eyes when he opened the shower curtain, I towel myself dry.
Reluctantly, I lift my head until our eyes meet.  He peers into them, searching, I know, for artifice.  I blink my eyes rapidly, quivering my lower lip in “pain.” Hmm, perhaps I have not lost my ability to deceive, after all.
“And how do you propose…” Sherlock took a deep breath to steady himself. “… that I went from completely sober to blackout drunk in less than an hour?” He couldn’t have been at James’s flat for more than three-quarters of that.
In his haste to reach John, Sherlock had completely forgotten the minor detail that he'd kidnapped a government agent.
“Twas a silly name,” John chuckled.  “But know this,” he said, sobering.  “Every time I say thy name, every time I look at thee or touch thee, every time I draw a breath, I tell thee I love thee.”
Entering Royal Albert Hall, he checked his jacket at the coatroom and wound his way through the crowd, plucking a pint of ale from the tray of one of the waiters.
“Yes, John.  You.  Me.”  I sigh.  This is exactly what I feared.  It appears there will be no having a good laugh over it.
So as I lie here listening to John, I think maybe, just maybe, now I am married I will discover what it is about the holiday that devolves people’s minds and hearts to sentimental mush.  In the months since first kissing John and then swiftly marrying him, my life has changed in ways I would have previously found inconceivable, giving me reason to believe my life might change in other ways as well.
“Who be this William who authorised my release?”  Sherlock asked, pushing mutton around his plate.  “Be he someone with whom you talked?”
“You will get stiff sleeping like that.  Back to bed, come on, now.”  Groggy and already stiff, Sherlock takes my arm to make sure I don’t topple over as I get up.  “I put John John back in his cot.”
Sherlock felt disoriented.  Disoriented to see John here in front of him.  So close. Still so far away.  He briefly wondered if he had lost his mind, if perhaps John were an apparition.  The thought crossed his mind that he might be a hologram, just as ‘Moriarty’ had been on top of St. Bart’s that night, but he quickly pushed it aside as being too ridiculous.  No, this was John.  John was
I vote for renaming Beta to Taskmaster.  Besides notes to correct punctuation (how did I get so lucky as to have a former English teacher as a beta?!), my beta makes the occasional comment that she wants a section clarified.  Usually it is when I have been lazy and decided it was 'good enough', because I couldn't come up with the words for what I wanted to say.  Fortunately for me, 'good enough' is not good enough for Burning_Up_A_Sun, and because of that I find the missing words. I believe my work is stronger for it.  Thank you, hon.
“A stubborn man thou be, John,” Sherlock huffed, his breathing laboured from the strenuous exercise.  “Tis better thee not walk alone. I know thou say thee be capable of taking care of thyself, but I will come with thee.  Two swords be better than one.”
fantasy. I didn’t go looking for something; I have no reason to want you to be implanted. And I know it’s not very scientific, but I just know.”
Sherlock nuzzles in closer.  “That is exactly what I said. Now can we get on with something more interesting?”
“It’s alright, sweetheart,” he said, lacing his fingers with mine.  “It makes me sad sometimes, but I’ve had many years with Katie to make it a happy tradition again.  And now I have you…”  John’s sentence drifted off as he turned, lifting his hands to hold my face, softly kissing my lips.  With a long sigh he pulled away.
As John turned to leave, thinking everyone had left, he saw Sherlock still sitting there, watching him.  It didn’t occur to him to be afraid; he instinctively knew he was meant no harm.
good, it is just skin, John.  Cells and nerve endings with a microscopic layer of dirt, sweat, and bacteria.”
Sherlock girded himself, pushing down the swell of anticipation that overcame him, unable to allow himself to believe that though John now stood behind him, he could not be there for any reason other than to greet an old friend.
My thumbs fly over the mobile as I lie to him; I do not want him to worry about me.  I want him to do what he needs to do and get back home to me as soon as possible.  Where he belongs.
On the seventh day John is gone, instead of hearing text alert, my mobile rings, the screen displaying a picture of a smiling John.  Putting it to my ear, for several seconds, I hear nothing, unsure if we have been disconnected.
“Amazing.  Simply amazing.”  Sidling up to Sherlock, John slipped an arm around him.   “Now, where were we?”
run to the shops before he notices she has not replied.  And that is because he will not yet have finished the message he is sending.
“Good evening, I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade.  If you don’t mind, I’d like to take a statement from you about what you saw happen here.”  He stopped, getting the feeling he’d seen the man somewhere before, somewhere important.  Suddenly it hit him, “You’re a doctor, aren’t you.  Yeh, I think you were the one who saved my friend’s life at the A&E a few years back.”
The second time was when he almost died on me after being nicked by a cab as we chased a mugger.  He stopped breathing due to his punctured lung and in my brilliance (fright) I shouted at him, startling him from his journey to the afterlife. (‘I figured it was the only way to get some peace and quiet.  I was afraid you were going to follow me to wherever it was I was going,’ he groused long afterwards.)  It still warms me to recall his gratitude for saving his life.
to be, I do not know.  He will find out, he always does; I cannot hide anything from him indefinitely.
With a hearty laugh that scraped on what nerves John had left, Sir Norman rode off, adding the indignity of splattering mud on John as he did.
“You call that a look?  The glimpse you gave me be but no more time than the flap of a hummingbird’s wing.”
With an almost feverish intensity I throw myself into the only thing I can think of doing at the moment… I clean the cottage.  I wash every wall, dust every surface and the articles that sit on them, vacuum, scrub the loo with thick rubber gloves protecting my hands.  All the while thinking about John…John.  Wondering why he has not texted. Wondering what can be so disturbing that he dismisses all thought of me.
There it is.  Perhaps I should ask John to wash my bedding since I will be back in my old room tonight.  I will be kind and tell him he can wait until morning; there is no need to rush.
Sherlock snuggles into me, wrapping an arm around my waist and laying his cheek on my chest.  My arm brings his shoulders closer, and I kiss his head, resting my cheek on it.  “I love you, sweetheart.”
John puts his arm around my waist, leaning into me as I wrap my own around him, my lips pressing a tender kiss atop his head.   “It’s beautiful, isn’t it,” he says, his tone hushed.  And for several minutes we stand here, oblivious to the cold, warmed by the beauty around us.  By the love we have for each other.  (Really?  Did I just think that?  No wonder they call it ‘lovesick’.  Pffft.)
My smile fades fast; I almost feel as if I am on trial.  Don’t be silly Watson, you’ve done nothing wrong.
My eyebrow raised, “I am guessing that is not what you were intending to say, since by no means does it hurts my feelings.  What is it you need to tell me?  It is not about my coat again is it?” I fully understood why he tried to save me from inflicting upon myself a heat stroke whilst we were in America, but we were home in Belstaff territory, and had been for three months.
“Come on, hurry up!  I ain’t got all day.  If you don’t get a move on I’ll have to give you demerit points.  You.”  The guard indicated the man limping.  “Only a few more and you’ll be in solitary.  Wouldn’t like that would you?”
“You don’t understand, do you, Sherlock,” Stamford said. “If you had never been born, he wouldn’t have had you here to challenge his intellect. It was you who made him want to be better. Yes, he has a competitive edge, but it’s about his wanting to set an example for you. He’s always felt a certain responsibility in helping raise his little brother to be a good man. It’s a responsibility that’s always been there, even when you grew to an adult.”
If John had not already been relieved that Sherlock would not compete, he had been doubly so when he had learned twas Sir Norman the Merciful of Leicester against whom Sherlock was to have competed.
Still cupping his face, I gently kiss his cheek, his temple, his eyelids whose lashes tickle my lip, and nudging my nose into his hair, I pull him to me, my arms wrapping around his strong shoulders.  “You may never leave me behind again,” I whisper, knowing I have somehow transformed into the person I have for so long derided, mocked with the fervor of someone devoted to a lifetime’s cause.
Begrudgingly, Sherlock acknowledged that Andi’s plan was better than his, for he hadn’t one. He walked faster, eager to return to the house. Eager to be near John. And arriving, he took a steadying breath before turning the knob, about to embark on one of the most difficult things he’d ever done. Nothing.
So as I watch John fumble with his tie, I get up and brush his hands out of the way; it is almost time for the driver to pick us up and take us to the television studio.
“Sherlock!  Compete in the joust?  I did not know you be trained.”  In his excitement, Aldus lifted himself to his elbows.  “Why I be surprised, I do not know.  As quickly as you took to the sword, it did seem as if you had some aptitude.  Now I know why.”  Aldus sagged back down onto the bed, weary from the exertion.
He does not seem to have heard me, for he does not look up.  I study him.  He looks older (was it only this morning?) and the thought occurs that it is due to me.  I have caused him to worry and wonder and to age more in 10 hours than he has in ten years.  I am ashamed; who am I to cause pain to this good, kind man who would never, ever hurt me.  Who has always had only kind words for me (excluding ‘idiot’, ‘dim-witted’ and various other pejoratives which were more than likely well-deserved).
“Where are we going?”  Sherlock repeated, squeezing John’s hand, letting go only long enough to discreetly trail his fingers up the long hardness along a certain ex-soldier’s crotch .  “I do believe the cloak room is unoccupied…”
But oddly, instead of quickening, I find my heartbeat slowing, becoming smooth and regular at a rate somewhat below normal.  I am…relaxed.  Just as relaxed as I was sitting in the chair just minutes ago.  It is rather a pleasant sensation to have a John wrapped around me, much more so than I ever would have imagined.  My breaths start to match his gentle ones; I sink into the mattress and hesitantly circle him in my arms.  It feels right.
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s with a fiery intensity, their flash of sea blue a disconcerting contrast against the harsh, grey day.  “I never thought he would harm thee.”  The voice that began strong and determined, faded away with the admission, and he once again stared off into the distance.
Despite the careful mask of stoicism on his friend’s face, John saw everything he knew the proud man would not want him to see.  Hope.  Fear.
“A car is on its way to retrieve you,” Mr. Holmes said, after having given her the briefest of summaries of what he knew. Which, in reality, was nothing. Then, uncharacteristically for someone who wielded almost limitless power, he offered a humble “Thank you, Nika” before disconnecting.
It was thrilling and more than a bit scary the way the car raced through the streets of London. It was a pace Nika had never experienced in a city center unknown as a place anyone expected to move with expediency. But running late following their quest to relieve Spencer of his implanted chip, a police cruiser—siren and flashing light included—had been provided at Mycroft’s behest.
“Then get some sleep, Aldus.  You, too, Cedric.  You be exhausted and we will arise early.  We leave for London first thing.”
“No, I didn’t come home because I couldn’t fly out. I came home because I realized the reason I was angry was that I didn’t want to be away from you. Not on Christmas, and not on any other day, either, Sherlock. As it turns out, I’m in love with you.”
More to stall for time than from any real need, for Katie has already done what she could to make him comfortable, I adjust his pillow, moisten his lips, smooth his blankets.  And instead of sitting in the overstuffed chair Katie moved near to John, I walk around to the other side of the bed.  Lifting the covers, I lie down and lean lightly against him, my head just far enough away so I can still see him.  So, as he slowly turns his head in my direction, he can still see me.
487.  That’s how many days until he could say goodbye and good riddance to this hellhole that had sucked the best years of his life from him.
When John died Sherlock knew there would never again be anyone like him in his life.  Should anyone ask, he would not be able to explain the profound affect the appearance, and loss, John had had on him.
“I don’t know John, maybe you were snogging the junior detective in the coat closet.” Sherlock said acerbically; he was getting impatient.  Did it really have to be so difficult?  It’s not like John had anything better to do on New Year’s Eve.  He didn’t currently have a girlfriend and one would think John would be happy to spend some time with an attractive woman.
Sipping at his lager, Sherlock inserted an earbud. Across the room sat Andi, raptly attentive to her mobile. While the Ram’s Head would not have been her first choice, she had been excited to get out of the house. Even if only to work.
And entwining their fingers they stood looking at each other, enraptured, each unwilling to be the first to break the spell they found themselves under.  But break it they did, and with reluctant footsteps they went in search of where Cedric found Eduard’s body.
John didn’t want to visit that painful past, not right now.  He didn’t want it to taint these precious moments he was sharing with Sherlock.
As John removed his cloak, Sherlock put a hand out, stopping him.  “No, I am not cold.  Never have I been warmer.  Tis you that warms me.”  A soft smile spread across Sherlock’s lips, lips swollen from kisses.  Kisses freely taken and freely given.  And he pulled John back into the circle of his arms.
“…Oh good, good, yes!  Tell them I’ll be round later today to give them the deposit and rent money, and pick up the key….yes, today.  I’m just about packed…Sudden? Yes….No, nothing’s happened; Uncle Sherlock and I have been getting along just fine.  I’ve been thinking about it; I’ve missed London and I just decided it’s time to go back.  No sense waiting!...Ok, ok, see you tonight.  Bye, love.”
be Colin’s mother?  Which makes you…” Sorting the information through his brain, Sherlock glanced at John, who still wore that silly grin.
Dr. Watson’s brow furrows, for he is as confused as I. “The chap who electrocuted himself in the jacuzzi? You said the case was closed, that it was accidental.”
I do not give him a chance to answer.  “We will stop right now and I will read up on the subject, research techniques that will help bring you to orgasm. I do not want to disappoint you, John.”   My decision made, I start to sit up, reaching for my zipper as I do.
John’s mind whirled.  As serious as an offence as be their deceit, murder be much more so.  All that kept John from going mad be that he well knew Sherlock did not murder Eduard.  To effect his release would be tedious and time consuming, but he
For hours, they had prepared.  Had planned down to the minutest detail, giving Sherlock every advantage to see that he succeeded.  Aldus had practiced with him until Sherlock could not bear it any longer.  “Tedious!”  Cedric had sharpened the weapons- a sword, a dagger to hide in each boot, and one to hide underneath Sherlock’s cloak.  John had fitted him with protective padding and any piece of his armor they could fit on Sherlock’s slim frame without restricting his movements.
“Yes.  Yes, I would.  If it would not be too much trouble for you.”  I am very sincere in this statement; I have no desire to put John through, what could be to him, minor torture, but my curiosity is piqued.
“Of course, Sherlock. Leaving me out of the loop was thoughtless, but not malicious. You didn’t do it to intentionally hurt me. But why are you bringing that up now?” Lord, he could barely think anymore, he was so tired. Yet here Sherlock was, drilling him like some low-ball attorney. He was closing in on something, but what was it?
Conflicted, John fidgeted.  He didn’t want to leave, but he knew he couldn’t stay.  He knew that despite the joy he felt this evening in seeing Sherlock again, being with Sherlock again, a feeling he thought he was no longer capable of, it was something that could not happen again.  He had absolutely no doubt there was no future for them and he refused to torment himself by being near him again.  If he had to he would leave the city.
Growing as limp as did I, John relaxes into the bed, a smile playing on his lips.  I lay my hand on his cheek and stroke his face.  His smile deepens and he purrs.  To the sound of his contentment and the vision of his beloved face in my mind, I fall asleep.
John couldn’t say that having a bomb strapped to him was his preferred way of spending the day, but it was far from the first time he had stared death in the face. In only the last year, he had been shot, hit by a cab, and attacked by knife. So far, the bomb was the least painful of the lot. And he intended it to stay that way.
After a few more grunts and groans John finally looked at the food I placed in front of him and let out a deep sigh.  “Honey, you know I love you, right?”
“But won’t you feel trapped?”  He says sleepily, ready to put my needs before his own.  As he always does.
As much as I want to give Katie my undivided attention, I cannot help from glancing toward the back of the flat, my eyes flicking back and forth between the girl before me and the space beyond, space that holds the person whose importance to me is beyond my comprehension.  My only thought is to see my John, hold him in arms whose muscles ache from the lack of him, feel the warm breath that will make me, once again, feel fully alive.  I am utterly besotted with the unassuming man who so gently and capably holds my heart in his hands, and I cannot bear the thought of spending one more second without him.
“…it’s understood, then. I’ll call again in twenty minutes,” Mycroft ended his call, tucking the mobile into the inside pocket of his coat.
“Aldus, Cedric,” he said.  Confused by his emotions, he needed to get back to familiar territory.  Thinking.  “I want you to remain awake the rest of the night, guard the area.  I do not think Gareth, if that be who it was, will be so foolish as to return tonight, but we cannot be too careful.”
The point is, my John is not happy, and I am almost at a loss of what to do about it.  After all, on our wedding day I vowed to make him happy.  Every day.  The vow secures the top position on my Pail List.  Bucket List, for you neophytes.
“Oh! Sherlock is doing splendidly!  Splendidly indeed.  Quite a fine swordsman he is turning out to be and, given a different circumstance, I think he would make a fine squire.  But tis nothing to be done about it; Eduard is gone, God be with him, and you will have to suffice with the two of us for the time being.”  Cedric stooped, stoking the fire to keep it burning whilst he readied the rest of their meal.
Gareth’s ears had pricked up; little chance there be of two Sherlocks existing in the world.  He had looked at Sherlock and measured him against the description he had been given of how he should look.  Twas slighter and taller than Gareth had thought he would be, given his father’s appearance, but, eh, one never knows from where one’s characteristics come; Sherlock’s form could have been passed down from generations two or three previous.  All Gareth knew was that he had found the long lost son, and he would take him back to his family.  Whether or not Sherlock wanted to go.
So, had he evaded talk of “us”? Of course, he had. It hadn’t been the right time. And even if it had been, he wasn’t going to admit to a man he’d met only two days ago (as far as
I stop rubbing him and retreat back to the far side of the bed. Shivering from the loss of John’s body heat and the thought that I nearly sent him from this earth, I huddle under the sliver of duvet still on my side.
“Stop acting as if thou does not care.  Thou tried once before to tell me thou did not love me.  I told thee that if thou said it again, I might believe thee. But I assure thee, I will not.”
“Good?!  It was a 240 volt of electricity…  You could at least warn a man…”  I am silenced by his kiss whilst he shifts us so that the bed is behind me, and with practiced ease, he sits me down.  Presses me into a lying position.  I do not want to know how he learned to be so good at this.
He kisses me again.  Something firm and moist peeks between my lips. Ooohhh!  It is his tongue again; I remember it so well from yesterday.  It comes to a stop just within reach of mine.  Wanting.  Waiting.  Teasing.  Making sure I am ready.
John,” Sherlock whispered, lightly touching his lips to those turned toward him.  Twas a small act, but it filled him with anticipation for all that their life together would be.
“True.” Thumping the mobile on the heel of his hand, Sherlock tried to unravel how Rose’s natural inclinations could be overridden so seamlessly. Coercion, drugs, hypnosis—these were the tools used to induced someone to commit an act they had no inclination or desire to commit.
As John took the pulse of the man lying there, he studied him.  Noted the dark hair and lashes against the too pale skin, the cheekbones that looked more likely to have been chiseled by a sculptor than by God.  Noted the fine bedclothes that had gone too long without proper care.  Noted that his skin, once healthy, now sagged on underused and underfed muscles.
“What is that?” I ask, and lying down close beside me he lifts what he holds above our faces and shows me the cover.  It is a brochure for Heaven.  (??!!)   “Why do we need a brochure?  We are already here.”
person he’ll talk to. If he’ll talk, that is. But I get the idea that maybe talking isn’t even the point. Maybe you just need to be there. But if you don’t want to...”
His hand dropping to his side, Sherlock sucked in a breath, and he took a step forward, stopping only when he realized he wasn’t quite sure what he would do when he reached him. “Are you alright?” he asked, glancing around, aware that though John appeared to be unencumbered of any threat, Simon could appear at any moment.
Half way to 221b, Sherlock slowed his pace, deliberating his next move. Knowing that running away was not the answer.
“I love you, too,” he says, as he reaches up to meet my lips that are just starting to tilt toward him.
As Sherlock left the flat, he could hear Mrs. Higgins start to rant about the ‘little tart’ her husband had been seeing on the sly.  He tuned her out, uninterested in the details of the ‘why’s’ behind the man’s murder.  Though he could have told her it was the ‘little tart’ who had placed the anonymous call when her lover didn’t show up at the appointed time.
“Come along, John.”  I pull at my husband’s hand, but when he does not immediately follow, I look back to see a one of the goofiest grins I have ever seen on his face.
John swiveled, surveying the space around him and trying to absorb it all. Trying to fathom how he had lived here for more than two months, and yet it all felt so… unfamiliar. Sure, he recognized things from the pictures in his mobile—the skull on the mantel, the horns over the desk, the general clutter of it all—but there was no physical memory, no sense that his body remembered being there.
“You aren’t a runner, John!” This time, a slam came from what sounded to be a mirrored cabinet in the bathroom. Followed by Sherlock’s footsteps flying up the stairs.
Mary sniffled for effect.  She was quickly tiring of the game, but knowing Sherlock wasn’t quite as clever as he thought he was, helped.
To ease the tension, Colin entertained Aldus with a story about a man who one night went out for an ale and, somehow, in his drunken state, traded his wife for an ass.  Not sober enough to know he had spent the whole night with the animal in his bed until he woke up the next morning.
I glance at John and he looks more relaxed than he did before we left the hotel.  The subject of his books, of
John hooked an arm on the chair's handle and wrenched himself around, but a hand pinned his bicep in place before he could see what had happened. And in what seemed like the same instant, with his free hand, the man dug under John's right thigh and grabbed his gun.
John had nothing to say to that, for he knew that since he had gotten married he had been far too self-involved, taking Sherlock for granted and failing to show just how much value their friendship still had to him.
John had watched his wife Eda die.  Had watched his son die.  The grief from those deaths had prostrated him.  But the thought of watching Sherlock die?  Twould surely kill him.
He felt it unwise to send an unarmed man off on his own, but he had bought Sherlock’s freedom and that meant giving him the freedom to do as he chose.  To do as one chose, one needed tools. This time when Sir John reached for his purse, he first unlatched his belt to slide it free.  Holding it out to Sherlock, its weight felt heavy in his hand.
I look over at Sherlock, his lips reddened from our too brief kiss; his mussed hair looking like it will take a week to tame.
Rolling over, Sir John sought to soothe his troubled mind by finding a more comfortable position. It did not work. Sherlock was like no other servant the Knight had encountered. Quick of mind. An educated manner of speech. A man with otherworldly powers.
What the hell was he doing?  Dreaming about John?!  Fucking Christ, even when he was sleeping he couldn’t leave her husband alone. Well,
be wrong.  After all, as inconsiderate as Sherlock could be it still wasn’t like him to be unresponsive for so long.
The Sculpture Gallery was almost akin to a storage room, filled wall to wall, floor to ceiling with sculptures and figures and mountings.  John found the cluttered feel of it made the room all the more interesting.  Comparing the usual museum with this one it was not unlike comparing a single flower with a bouquet.  Each had its own appeal.  Each its own beauty.
John shifted in his chair and turned his attention to the window above Sherlock’s head, still avoiding the pair of eyes taking in every detail about him.
Shoving the sock back onto John’s arm, Sherlock nabbed the bits of face and hair that had fallen off, slapping them on in a Picasso‑esque fashion; Simon hadn’t demanded perfection. And capturing the image haphazardly on his mobile, he ran across the room to Simon’s note for the email address and hit Send. Almost immediately, a text with a link arrived.
John’s eyes had left Sherlock just long enough to check the sight on the gun. And when he looked up, for the first time since John had seen him in the warehouse, Sherlock looked uncertain. His shoulders sagged almost imperceptibly, and his eyes narrowed as if in deep thought. His lips, usually full and inviting, were drawn into a line.
“There be no need to thank me, Sir John; I knew as soon as I met you that there be a unique quality to you.  You be as much a part of the family as any other of us.  Now, you had best get back to your young man; if I know my boy, he be getting impatient about now.”
When he rounded the screen, he saw a man who appeared to have been hit by a lorry, but the rest John had gotten in the last few hours had much improved his skin color, and his eyes looked brighter. He looked more like the John that Sherlock missed.
