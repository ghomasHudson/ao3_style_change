“Fuck you,” Dean growled.  He hissed in pain and Castiel’s hand tightened on his gun.
Castiel scrambled to his feet, confused and hurt.  This wasn’t
” Dean snapped.  He grabbed Castiel by the shoulders and shook him, much like in the auto shop.  “What the fuck would you have done if he’d seen you?”
“Y-you . . . kissed me,” Castiel rasped.  “With your mouth.”  He didn’t quite meet Dean’s eyes, staring at a spot somewhat to the left of his head, instead.  “You . . . aren’t supposed to do that,” he added, sounding genuinely confused.
The signing went
So, Castiel wanted him?  Honestly wanted
Dean glared at Castiel and then Balthazar.  “Don’t listen to him.  He’s full of shit,” he muttered.
Dean grabbed the blanket, setting it across both their shoulders before opening up his to-go box.  The food was lukewarm, but somehow tasted better than it had in the restaurant.  Like Castiel had said, it was lovely out here.  The cars were a distant shush in the background, very few using the road behind them.  The wind hummed in the air, followed by the faint lowing of cows.  Much better than overhearing a bunch of strangers babble about their day.
" he began.
Dean sat at an old armchair, a fire burning behind the grate.  At his elbow was a cut glass filled with brown liquid and he read from an old paperback, pages folded back in his hands.  So very . . . normal.  Castiel pressed closer, yelping when the glass burned his nose.  Fluttering away in confusion, he rubbed it.
He tucked the idea away, however, when he picked up the man at his home, a pleasant two bedroom in the suburbs.  Castiel sat with a sigh, leaning back in the passenger seat.  “Ah.  I’m grateful it’s a Friday.  I’ve decided to cease working weekends if I can help it.”  He rolled his neck, smiling warmly at Dean.  “How was your day?”
Another week passed before he saw the man again.  A few of his customers had mentioned something about a stranger in town but no one knew where he lived or what he was doing there.  All they really remembered was his car, the black classic that rumbled down the quiet streets.
He stared blearily straight ahead before finally barking out a tired, strained laugh.  Seriously?  So far-fetched but also highly believable when it came to this man.  ”Dean, are you

It's then that Dean realizes he's at
Castiel was freaky smart, too.  Almost every damn story Dean presented, Castiel had some interesting factoid to add to it.  To the point that Dean typically ran his copy by Castiel before submitting it for review.  It helped that the little nerd was a walking encyclopedia.  Though, it often led to unintentionally humorous incidences where crass jokes soared about a mile over the man’s head.
He blinked at that.  For a moment, he forgot he was talking to the drop-dead gorgeous owner of a bookstore and instead, just a man.  A man who
“So I’ve noticed,” Dean muttered.  He looked at the display again.  “I still don’t get what
And this.  This was precisely

He pushed open the door to his hotel room, immediately noting the broken seal on the mini-bar, the tiny bottles of liquor lined up neatly on the table above.  He sighed in irritation, stomping over. The note was hardly a surprise.
it wasn’t something he’d be repulsed by.  “Not like . . . water sports or something?”
Dean only grinned before opening his mouth and taking Castiel in.  Gasping, Castiel’s fingers dug through Dean’s hair as the man sucked and licked, his mouth vibrating around Castiel’s dick.  He squeezed his eyes shut, legs trembling as he struggled not to thrust.  God, how long had he wanted this?  How fucking long had he wanted to do this with Dean?  All the taunts and flirts.  All the stupid little notes.  Through it all, he’d just wanted
Worry set in but Dean nodded.  “Sure, sure.  I can call you tonight?”
The blush suffused his body and his glow heightened as he did, echoed in the amusement crossing Dean’s face.
Once home, he made a decision. He would go find out
Castiel blinked.  So Dean had done something to the window?  He tilted his head, watching Dean curiously as the man walked them both over to the opening.  As Dean lowered his hand to the open pane, Castiel launched off, flapping his wings.  To
His stubbornness waned and his hands loosened.  If Dean wouldn’t hear him, what point was there in arguing?  He bit his lip, muffling the mournful trill.  Another breath, shakier than before.  “If I push, it won’t matter; will it?”
“Call me, Dean,” the man purred.  He gestured toward the dig site with a jerk of his head.  “You’ll find that thing ain’t remotely ancient.  I found it at a flea market this morning.”
He shivered, affectionate humor a sour lump.  “I warned you about digging in my head.”
After walking his brother to the front door and making arrangements to meet up for dinner with Jess on Sunday, Dean headed back to his office, still too unsettled to return to work.  He paced, his hands still twitching.  He deserved good things, huh?  What a joke.  If he deserved such things he wouldn’t be so fucked up right now.  He’d be normal.  In a normal relationship.  With normal problems.  Instead of this twisted need to get fucked by a man who
Castiel smiled and checked his watch.  “Well.  If we grab the next train, we might only be a few minutes late to work.”
"Jesus Christ, Cas!  You brought a fucking cougar into the house?!”
Pamela smiled into the camera after yet another puff piece on yet another hipster wedding in a cornfield.  “Speaking of weddings, I hear your brother walked down the aisle, Dean.”

It was all Dean was good for.  He’d failed school, failed Azazel; Michael was doing him a favor.  Giving him
Despite his tension and general confusion, the lull of the Impala’s engine finally began to get to Dean.  His shoulders eased and he leaned back in his seat, sinking into the interior.  After a bit more, it was nothing more than the rumble of the road the grasses flashing by.  They drove for another half hour before he found what he was looking for.  A small hill, overlooking farmland.  He pulled off the road, the gravel and dirt crunching under the Impala’s wheels.
Ignoring the last bit, Dean grinned widely.  ”Slow your roll; you
Castiel frowned again.  “Given?  Did you agree to that?”
Dean's got a crush.  It's a silly thing.  But maybe today he'll make good on it.
“Dean, you needn’t hide.”
As he hefted his sandwich board from behind the counter, he found himself already wishing for Wednesday.  A second date surely called for sex; or had in Castiel’s past.  And Dean’s virility rang in the air like a hawk’s cry; nearly palpable to him at this stage.  So, if he was a bit
Scrambling backwards, he stammered an apology, the words dying when he found Dean blinking wide-eyed at him.

too familiar.  His college’s star pitcher, Dean Winchester.  And Castiel’s crush since freshman year.
Before he could say anything, though, his cousin piped up.
Some of his anxiety melted when he recognized the cake in the man’s hands.  “You brought it?”
He took a deeper breath and pushed away from the counter.  It didn’t matter.  He could admit now, over a month into their time together, that he loved the man.  Truly and deeply.  Perhaps, if he told Dean that . . . he frowned.  No, Dean needed to be

about being crazy about you.”  He poked Castiel in the forehead.  ”But you, like usual, are oblivious to subtlety.”  His smirk softened.  ”That’s probably my favorite thing about you, Cas.”
His cheeks warmed and Dean swallowed.
“Running to the store for microwaved pizza doesn’t count, love.”  He patted him again and returned to his seat across the table.  “I think you should do it.”
“Fuck me,” he blurted.  He felt the blood drain from his face at the words.  “I mean, don’t fuck me!  Not that I’d say no!  I mean, you could if you wanted.”
By eleven, Bobby kept throwing him the stink eye but Dean hadn’t stopped roving around the shop.  He and Bobby were partners in the restoration business but Dean didn’t think for one second he was actually the one in charge.  Bobby never hesitated to put him in his place.  Even so, he found himself unable to stop moving and after picking up the same torque wrench for the fifth time in a span of five minutes, he wasn’t all that surprised to hear Bobby sigh.
“Uh, just . . .” fuck.  He’d not mentioned Castiel to anyone yet.  At all.
a new one.
He tried to think if he’d seen the store.  Granted, he didn’t venture out much but for a movie now and again as well as groceries so it was anyone’s guess how old it was.  It might be fairly new.
“Hey, you were the one with the overexcited dick, Winchester.”  His tone mellowed quickly.  “Look, you might be able to get him to talk
Castiel grinned.  Oh, he was going to enjoy this.  He pulled out his handcuffs, slapping one on Dean’s wrist and the other on his own.  “You’re under arrest.”
Dean winced.  “Um … lucky guess?”
Castiel sniffed again, still smiling.  After a moment, the smile shifted to a frown.  ”Wait.  Aren’t viruses contagious?”
He slapped the window frame.  “All right, you sit up there and be bird food.  I’m going back to my book.”  He snapped the window closed, turning away.
he though, strutting his way to Commuter Angel’s side.  He didn’t really hear the commotion behind him he was so intent on his destination.  About a foot from his crush’s side, he heard a bellowed, “
Careful of the food in his hands, he leaned up and kissed Dean softly.  “I’d like that . . . very much,” he murmured.
Benny blinked and shrugged again, testing the door.  Like the garage, it turned and the heavy oaken door swung open, the hinges silent.  Castiel yanked Benny back just as he heard a voice.  The heavier man stumbled almost falling.  Waving him silent, Castiel switched places, crouching low against the door.
to admit what I was.”
Startled, Castiel lost his grip on Dean and stumbled, colliding with the man’s warm, broad chest.  To his further surprise, Dean’s arm looped around his back, catching hold of him and keeping him upright.  Face disturbingly warm, he looked up, finding dim green watching him.  He could barely see Dean in the low light of the tunnels but he could still see that familiar, brilliant color.
The pout looked both awkward and adorable on the former angel's countenance.  Not that Dean would ever admit to that.  Ever.  "I’ll bring in some soup and tea, okay?"  He gave Castiel a nudge toward his bedroom.  "Go get tucked in, all right?"
“Urk,” Castiel replied, still staring at Dean.  The expression on his face once more mirrored a deer stuck on the highway in rush hour traffic like their first meeting and Dean couldn’t have thought it more adorable.  Castiel swallowed violently and rasped, “He . . . um . . . has . . . he’s very . . . frustrated.”  He winced at the final word, his face flushing red again.
On Sunday, while finishing up the setup for the signing the next day, he did the unthinkable:  he called Balthazar.

Nothing.  He’d had
Would it show weakness to give Castiel another chance?  He’d not done anything hurtful before now.  And Dean had the misfortune to know
Dean scowled, though his green eyes danced.  “You know, I’m going to fuck you
Dean sighed.  “No, I shouldn’t.”  He kissed Castiel again, harder now and more demanding.  Lips barely a hair’s breadth away, he murmured, “I know what I want in life, Cas.  I want
true.  Tiny things altered.  Dean still hadn’t slept with Castiel.  That, clearly, wouldn’t happen any time soon though Dean’s anxiety flared more often at the continued celibacy.  Thankfully, on the dates themselves, Dean ended up far calmer than he’d been in a long while.  Which only left him flustered when he thought back on his personal history with men and women.
He nearly smiled at that.  Sam might not demand he switch over but he would do his best to remind Dean not to drive himself – literally – to exhaustion.  He shrugged, even as his stomach gnawed at his spine.  “Yeah, I could eat.”
Charlie worked part-time and also handled the website for the shop and any ridiculous technological advertisements she could force on he and Bobby.  She was younger than Dean and thankfully, smarter.  Also the only woman he didn’t feel the need to flirt with.
He finished off his coffee, gasping at the burn.  Though, he
Castiel stared at the open door, wondering if he was still knocked out.  He slumped back against his pillow, frowning at the ceiling.  If he was headed back to America like Bobby claimed, he
The door jangled as both women left and Castiel stared after them, jumping when Mr. Wallace cleared his throat.  The older man grinned, his longer canines glinting.  “Morning, Castiel.  You look a bit distracted.”
“Am not,” he finally replied.  He wiped his mouth on a napkin and grabbed a fry, gesturing with it.  “People can be single, you know?”
Unable to speak, he shifted his hips, hoping to get the message across.  Given the tightening of Dean’s hands and the sudden absence of cock, he wondered if Dean had misunderstood.  But then Dean plunged in again, jolting his body forward.  Before he could recover, Dean drew out again and pumped into him, pleasure bursting out in shivering sparks.
“I think you are an ill man who is confused,” Castiel remarked.  He patted his shoulder.  “There’s an A&E on the way to my hotel; I can drop you off.”
to tell him who I was.  But . . . he’s really pretty.  A little unreal, to be honest.  So . . . so I . . . I might have . . .
The man’s green eyes widened and then narrowed.  “You gave it away.”
The werewolf lunged, colliding with the barrier Dean had set up.  He scrabbled at the air, howling and snarling, spit flying.  “She was

Making a decision, he pushed off the chair, slipping down the hall to find Dean puttering in his bedroom, now dressed in boxers and an old t-shirt.  He flew to the man’s bowed head and tugged on his earlobe, startling him.
He tweaked Dean’s ear, smirking at the yelp.  ”You also owe me about a hundred pounds for digging into my mini-bar.  Therefore, you’re not to leave my sight until this

but rather
When Castiel didn’t answer, he looked over, finding the man staring at Dean’s hands.  “Cas?” he nudged.
“Good.”  Castiel kissed him on the cheek.  “Drive safe, Dean.”  He turned then but not before offering a final wave over his shoulder.
to stay with Castiel?  Sex had actually made the man want him
'she' and 'her' sound to me now.
Castiel blinked back. “Um, yes, really. I discovered, about a month ago, that I am not actually a woman, but a man.”
First kisses are tricky things. Anticipation can make them overwhelming…or huge disappointments. They can be awkward and messy or dry and clinical. Maybe noses collide or teeth click uncomfortably. Maybe one person’s breath doesn’t bear the closer examination.
What had happened? Had Castiel slipped into a different dimension? One where transgender people were not reviled or seen as bizarre or unnatural? Where they were actually welcomed and valued? He felt a lump forming in his throat, and his vision was getting a little watery. “Charlie, I don't know what to say . . .” he began, his heart full.

Adonis grinned. “Sure thing, dude.” Lafitte tossed the keys at his partner, who caught them neatly out of the air without seeming to look at them. He gave Castiel a long hard look, then turned away, leaning in to whisper to his co-worker,
After they cleaned up, Castiel brought out the open bottle of wine, and Dean grabbed a second, unopened one, and they nestled into the sofa with their glasses and talked. Or rather, Castiel talked. Dean asked a few questions here and there, but mostly he just listened, his gaze soft and accepting, a deep, quiet pool that took in everything Castiel gave him. Castiel, on the other hand, felt like a cataract: once he let go, all the thoughts and feelings and fears that had been spiraling around in his head for these last two months came tumbling out of him in a heady spate, catching Dean up and spinning him along in its wild current. He told Dean everything: how he had come to his realization (it wasn't a
“I think that might have… left some part of my grace in you. And that drop of grace was probably enough to power any angelic abilities I choose to use here, having the full knowledge of myself being an angel from how your mind built me.”
, Dean,” says Castiel. Dean notices that Castiel’s hands are trembling, so he reaches out to grab them gently in an attempt to calm Castiel. Castiel recoils slightly at the touch but allows his hands to rest in Dean’s as he stares at them. He grounds himself with the touch to recollect himself, then he looks back up at Dean with fiery determination in his eyes.
“It is as real as it will get for me, Dean. But it isn’t for you, and you need to stop this,” Castiel’s hands finally slide down Dean’s arms and they settle on Dean’s lap. He brings Dean’s hands into his with care, as if handling an exquisite marble piece, and brushes Dean’s hand with his thumbs absent-mindedly.
"I love you."
Dean trudges to the table and gives a grunt of acknowledgement to Castiel who is already sitting there sipping his coffee. Sam, being the health nut that he is, is already out on a jog and has dragged Eileen along with him.
“It did.”
"I only learned from the best, as you have already heard from me."
He lets his hand glide down Castiel slowly, from his face to his shoulder, down his arm, brushing his hand and fingers, and it finally hangs loosely by his side. “I’d say you’re pretty attractive for a human, Cas,” Dean says to conclude his analysis. Castiel realises that his breaths feel shallow, too frequent, and he feels something strange and indescribable pooling his stomach – another combination of sensory input he has come to experience only as a human, but does not yet understand fully.
It takes a while before Castiel could get Dean up onto the sofa. He goes to the kitchen to make some tea – hopefully calming enough – for Dean, and returns to Dean on the sofa, hands rubbing his face.
"I love you, Castiel."
“I said you’re objectively attractive. Don’t let that get to your head,” Dean huffs and pointedly looks up to the sky. He finds himself focusing on Vega.
He notices Dean looking down at his own feet with hands in his pocket and he seems to be struggling to stay still, as if teetering on the edge about something, but it only lasts for a few seconds. Dean looks up.
“So, no, I don’t regret losing my grace. I may mourn the loss of my previous life, but regret is not what I feel. I do not regret being given the chance to experience life afresh, so different from what I have grown accustomed to my entire existence,” Castiel rises from his leaning position and he grips Dean’s hands tighter. His voice grows louder, more insistent. “I do not regret being able to taste a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again. I do not – I cannot,
He catalogues his facial features. Dark brown hair, prominent brow ridge, blue eyes, raised nose bridge, defined jaw. These are what he notices first and he thinks these would be what others look at too. That said, there are too many variables to consider, each potentially having its objective benchmark to be measured against. He cannot even be sure if what he noticed matter – for all he knows, the shape of his ears matters too.
“Sorry – you’ve been so fidgety since we left the Bunker, I thought you were possessed,” explains Castiel with a shaky chuckle. “And since I’m not an angel anymore I can’t actually see if you are.”
. He finds a wall to lean on and feels the paper-thin veils he has put up to protect himself getting torn down by the claws of reality. Dark, oppressive truth bears down, straining the walls of this elaborate set, and they collapse. The set is undone. Dean’s legs buckle below him and he slumps down the wall until he is on the ground. He brings his knees up and sinks his face into them, breathing in and letting out a shuddering sob as he becomes vaguely aware of Castiel moving with hesitation and kneeling down beside him.
“If you are willing to try,” Castiel whispers. “Maybe I’ll see you on the other side.”
That it was all pretense.  Meant to look innocent and secretly, they were desperate lovers, unwilling to keep their hands to themselves.  Like some old, 80s, soft-core porn flick.  He’d have been embarrassed if anyone knew but luckily, he managed to keep his infatuation to himself.  Other than Gabriel’s knowing looks and eye rolls.
Castiel swallowed, touched by Dean’s familiarity with his work.  The fact that he found

Eyes half shut, Castiel leaned back and yawned.  ”As you’ve said.  Ten times by my count.  You need a new argument, Dean.”
“I didn’t do it on purpose!  I was flustered.  He kept
He yawned and stood, shivering when his feet hit the ice cold wood of the cabin floor.  Winter was on its way and Dean saw a trip to gather firewood in his near future.  Underneath Castiel’s singing, he could just make out the snap of logs in the fireplace.  He padded down the hallway, Castiel’s voice growing stronger as he neared the kitchen.
relationship; right?”  Fucking words.  They were so damn hard to spit out.  He could swear at anyone and shoot back retorts like they were nothing but here?  Here he felt like he’d only known English a short while.  Couldn’t grasp a damn thing.
Castiel smiled that same enigmatic smile that had snared Dean so quickly.  “I know.  You aren’t the kind of man who would dream of making such a demand.  And you aren’t.  This isn’t you coercing something from me, Dean.”  He touched Dean’s chin with careful fingers.  “This is me . . . making a choice.  One I should have made many years ago.  I’m only sorry you had to bear the brunt of my conflict.”
Gabriel remained silent for a moment.  After a bit, he mused, “
“It’s not the same,” Dean rasped.  He looked up at Castiel then, eyes shining.  “You know how much blood is on my hands?  The things I’ve done?”
of these men who touched you.”  He licked his lips.  “You are far from broken, Dean.  Wounded?  Yes.  Broken?  No.”  He smirked.  “If you were broken, you would not fight me so much.”
“Um, I spoke with James.  If you’d like, he can meet for dinner tonight?”  He’d have to hurriedly call Balthazar after this, however.  He doubted his cousin would be happy but if he promised to pay and to take the three of them to
He sighed, leaning against the door, watching Dean’s chest rise and fall.
” he murmured.
Shaking and trying
Castiel squinted at Dean, surprised by the heat in his voice.  “Benny, please; show us where we need to go,” he murmured, still watching Dean.
“Shit,” Dean muttered, all flirtation gone as his gaze dropped down.  He crossed the room, kneeling down beside Castiel, startling him.  His fingers were gentle and quick against his stitched side.  “I’m sorry,” he murmured.  “This was my fault.”
Castiel tilted his head, squinting.  “With Anna?  Not likely.  She’s a Domme much like myself.”  He still smiled though his gaze grew troubled.  “Dean?  Is everything all right?  You seem anxious.”
Castiel reddened.  “N-no!  Not that.  I mean . . . Bartlett . . . he’s . . . I . . .”  His mind blanked.  Or he’d seizured.  Something.  That was the only reason why he suddenly blurted, “I’m his publisher!”
Gabriel answered on the third ring.  “This is Gabriel.”
hm?”  He tugged on his briefs, letting the head of his dick peek through.  “I mean, I was willing to help.”

him, body and soul.  Silly man.  Good thing that Cas is a very stubborn man.  :D
He took a seat, dismayed to find James inching his chair over closer.  The man ordered white wine and leaned back in his chair, once more surveying Dean.  “You know, had I known
Not that he could say that.  How foolish would it be for him to admit to a wanted criminal that, ideally, he wanted nothing more than to let him run rampant if only to keep chasing him.  The tease.  It was all in that damn tease and those green eyes and that charming grin.
Dean was … blushing?  The other student shrugged nervously.  ”Been … kind of into you since … Freshman Seminar.  But you’re Biology and I’m English so … kind of hard to find an excuse to be around you.”  He cleared his throat again.  ”So … I know you like this tree.  And —” he shrugged a second time.
Spent and mind swirling, Castiel yawned and nuzzled Dean’s chest, only catching on to the act when Dean himself chuckled.  He blushed, head shooting up.  “Oh, s-sorry,” he murmured.  He only hoped Dean wouldn’t realize it a sign of how deeply and quickly Castiel had fallen for the man.  Pathetic, really.  He’d keep that hidden for as long as --
The other man blinked at him again, that same owlish expression from before until it relaxed into a wide grin.  “What, you got cat ears or something?”

With his curiosity sated regarding James, Dean realized there was really only one thing left for him to do before the signing:  Learn anything and everything about one Gabriel Milton.
to subdue it so that I can take it back where it belongs.  I shouldn’t just demolish it because it’s in pain.”  He leaned back in the seat, leather shifting under him.

was that calm at three in the morning with alarms blazing.
“Hey!” Dean barked.  “Look, I didn’t . . . it wasn’t what I meant to do, okay?  I got . . . sort of . . . carried away,” he muttered.  He leaned against his counter, holding his head in his hand.  “I didn’t . . . I wanted him to stop lying; that’s all.  I like the guy, Gabe.  A lot.  And . . .” he broke off, staring at the carpet.
Thrilled by Dean’s overture, it took a moment for Castiel to answer.  “Dean,” he began, “I’m an adult.  I get hurt.  You get hurt.  It will happen.”
Dean breathed in deeply, still looking perturbed.  “I’ll see you Monday.  All right?”  He began stepping backwards, toward the door.  “And you can call me any time you want to call this bullshit off, all right?”
Feeling open enough, Castiel shifted, guiding Dean inside him.  Dean’s fingers tightened then, the tremor fading as Castiel sighed, sliding down Dean’s thick cock.  It hurt so blissfully good.  It had been ages, it seemed, since he’d slept with another man.  Felt that invasion that was so exquisitely cherished.  He panted, head bowed as he struggled to relax against Dean’s girth.  He felt a hand on his jaw and looked up to see Dean watching him, the concern almost palpable.
“Because you don’t look like you,” Sydney whined.  “Castiel, he’s going to hurt us.  He needs to leave!”  He huffed into the phone.  “I know you went to his cabin, Castiel.  You have to know what he is!”
He sighed, leaning against his fridge.  “Sydney, calm down.  Please?”
He opened his eyes slowly, avoiding looking down at his over-excited crotch.  “Um, thanks.  I mean that,” he answered honestly.  He didn’t even know how that could be possible given that his heartbeat sounded like a freight train in his ears and he didn’t think he’d breathed in the last minute.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean purred, leaning in and sucking with gentle pressure on Castiel’s neck.  “I want you on a bed.  All splayed out.  But, I don’t think I can wait.”  He blew on the damp skin and Castiel whimpered, fingers digging into Dean’s t-shirt at his waist.  “I got a couch in the back.  A nice one.  Think we can make use of it?”
Beyond amused, Dean lifted his eyebrows innocently.  “Oh?  Like . . . writer’s block?”
Castiel refused to get off the phone with Dean for nearly an hour.  By the time they’d finished talking, Dean had a firmer idea of where they stood but some questions still lingered.  He agreed to dinner a second time, promising to show up at six like he’d stated earlier that day.  And even though the rest of his afternoon remained uneventful, those questions simmered in the back of his head.
Feeling calmer, cradling his phone, Dean asked, “How long since you’ve had a long-term sub?”
Clearing his throat, Castiel couldn’t hide the sudden speed of his heart, or the flush that traveled southward.  “Using a man for his kitchen equipment, Dean?  Not very gentlemanly of you.”
“Cas!” Dean shouted, following quickly.  The man hadn’t heard him, though.  He was already in his car, tires squealing and gravel spitting.  Stunned, Dean watched him go, wondering what the

“Fine.  I’ll go on your word.  For now.”  He turned then.  “You do one thing, however …”
“You let me out of the vase the moment your want manifested.  But instead of keeping it, you gave it away and severed my connection to it.”  The man’s eyes went dark.  His humor suddenly faded.  “You … you released me.”
“I prefer eccentric,” Castiel protested.  He coughed at Dean’s squint.  “And . . . possibly perverted.”
Castiel spent nearly ten minutes with his face planted in starchy fabric before he finally managed to gain enough energy to sit upright.  Still irritated that Dean had gotten into his hotel room, he dialed his assistant director in France, wondering how he was going to frame this additional cost without looking like an alcoholic.
“Yeah.  Sorry.”
”  He clapped a hand over his face, moaning in embarrassment.
Castiel blinked, surprised.  He’d never had made that connection.  Dean had supposedly started around age nineteen.  According to their files, Sam was just over four years younger.  The heaviest of his sprees were in the beginning.  He’d tapered off in recent years but not by much.  It made too much sense to be a lie.

he had at the moment with the other man.  Even if it was only temporary.  He sighed and picked up the room’s phone, dialing the take-away place he’d used the first night.
Not long ago, Castiel had been a studious member of the corporate rat race.  A good little capitalist soldier.  Clocked in at eight, every morning.  Home at five, every evening.  Saturdays when necessary.  Smile politely.  Mind his tongue.  Head down.  Work, work, work.
” he snapped, face flaming red.  They were at a garage, it looked like.  A poorly used one, from the look of things.  One busted light that buzzed and snapped.  The door on the garage hung crazily.
Castiel shook his head.  “No, I didn’t finish the degree.”  He shrugged.  “Many might think it a waste of my education but I don’t feel that way.”
Dean pursed his lips.  “Maybe,” he drawled.  “But see, at least I wasn’t eating the hearts of whoever I damn well pleased.”  He stood then, both hands on the gun.  “Did you forget that little tidbit?”  He sneered.  “She was a pretty thing, I’ll admit; damn disgusting habits though.”
The years that followed Sam’s death and resurrection were no less painful.  He watched in Dean’s handwriting as the man became more withdrawn.  As he watched those he loved die.  The world itself breaking at the seams.  How he almost lost Sam a second time when they’d nearly closed the gates to Hell.
Gorgeous.  Utterly gorgeous.  Drenched and in obvious pain, the man was
A hiss of wind and he jumped, striking his head against the window.  “Fuck!  Cas, goddammit!”  He rubbed at his head, squinting at the angel.  “Shit, warn a guy.”
Face red, Castiel choked on his coffee.  He licked his burned lips and snarled, “You say
“Uh huh.”
He said his goodbyes to Balthazar and hung up, staring at the glossy hardbacks in front of him.
Dean rolled his eyes and sat back on his ass, legs splayed out in front of him.  The display for Castiel’s books mocked him.  That damn name.  He’d had such a crush on the guy all through college and even now.  But Castiel appeared to be so much more than brilliant word play and hot sex.  Well, he
“Hrm?”  Castiel was dizzy.  He couldn’t quite follow what Dean was saying.  He licked his lips, so close.  So damn close to this man.  It would probably taste divine to kiss him.  He could just imagine; Dean would be warm and sweet.  Probably taste like honey.  Maybe he’d crush Castiel to his chest, grab his ass.  Grind against him.  He whimpered a little, his imagination running on overdrive.

Castiel glared at the cup and then at Dean.  “You
He shrugged, clicking open the bottle of lube, letting the cold liquid spill over his fingers.  He stroked Dean’s hole, savoring the quaking sigh as he did.  “Do you know how long I’ve wanted you?” he rasped.  He slid two fingers into Dean, marveling at the heat and tightness.  “How long I’ve
“My name.  Dean?”
Surprised, Dean blinked at him.  “T-touch?  Um . . . okay.”  He shuddered when Castiel’s hand cupped his jaw.  Warm and soft.  It didn’t take much for him to lean into it, his eyes falling shut in the process.
The door creaked open and Castiel poked his head in.  “Hello, Dean,” he murmured, slipping all the way in and shutting the door behind him.  He shrugged off his coat, folding it over one arm.
He almost wanted to whine over the unfairness.  Castiel just needed to take control.  Step in and direct Dean.  Not drag this out.  “Cas, c’mon,” he muttered.  He looked up, startled by the warm grin, and soft eyes.  “Wh-what’s that look for?”
Dean.  A great deal.  And he certainly didn’t want to hurt the man.  Admitting the truth would likely do that.  Which meant no clean way out of this.  Maybe, if he showed up looking like a mess, Dean would be less interested?  Well, less interested in Gabriel.  Which was him.  Sort of.

“Hell, no!” Dean assured him.

There is light everywhere.
“And he doesn’t mean that, y’know, metaphorically.” Dean clears his throat. “We thought maybe we were dead, that maybe we were in Heaven. Or Hell.”
Dean frowned in confusion. Okay, this was good, probably, judging from the smile tugging at the corner of Cas' mouth, but why was she –
“It's the family business,” Dean protested, though Castiel heard the smile underneath the words.
Dean looked down at their hands, mercifully withdrawing his intense gaze and giving Castiel a moment to breathe and reset his brain. “Don't get me wrong, Cassie – whatever it is, it looks like a good thing. I mean, you've been so

Castiel covered his face with his hands. “Charlie,
Charlie waved a nonchalant hand in the air. “A binder. You know, to squash your boobs down,” she said as if she were talking about wearing a hat on a rainy day. “You're lucky, you know, not being too big, um,
he was beautiful. “Oh, Cas, what would you do without me?” He took half of his sandwich and pushed it front of Castiel on his napkin, then dug into his bag for a banana, which he peeled, broke in half, and likewise shared. “Dean,” Castiel said in some alarm, “you can't…”

Dean's breath was warm against Castiel's lips. “Not even you, Cas?” he whispered.
to the desk top.
They all crowded on the landing in front of Castiel's apartment. Castiel fumbled with the keys – why hadn't he left the door unlocked? He wasn't in Chicago anymore, for godssake.
-girly as it was that I felt
“I remember…Chuck and Amara. Amara said the sun was going away because Chuck was dying, that she would die, too. But they worked it out and fucked off to do a brother-sister vacation or something. Then nothing. Then I was here.” He looks at Castiel, who is regarding him now with an unreadable expression. “What about you?”
Castiel looks around at the vast white emptiness, his eyes narrowing when he catches sight of the wound in the world. “
The sky was bright, blue and white. The sun caught off the lake, dazzling.
Sam turned his head just enough to see Jack standing nervously in the hall, eyes round. “He okay?”
Castiel drops his hand,  his face and body freezing, waiting. His eyes search Dean’s. “What do you remember?”
Dean looks at Castiel. Castiel smiles, a little shyly, eyes flicking down, then up again. “Oh, yeah,” Dean says. In this particular moment, he can’t remember what he was ever afraid of.
pleased with himself, even smug; Benny looked mostly amused, as if Dean's strange behavior was so familiar that he'd stopped being annoyed at it years ago. “I really can't…” Castiel began.

Castiel pulled down the passenger-side sun visor and frowned at himself in the makeup mirror. When he'd seen the style taking shape in the barbershop mirror, he'd been excited; he thought he'd actually
“I like to think of it as mental flexibility,” Castiel said. He looked down at Dean with a knowing smirk. “I’m nothing if not…flexible.”
Castiel looked on, paralyzed, as Dean rifled through the boxes, fanning them like playing cards and chuckling to himself. He didn’t sound disgusted, at least.
Castiel opened his mouth to take responsibility for his own absent-mindedness, but Benny cut him off. “It's all right, Dean,” he drawled. “You keep apologizin', you're gonna make Mr. Novak uncomfortable. Let it go, brother.”
Dean drew back again and stared at him in surprise. “Huh? Me? I don't need anything. I'm not the one who's had the world do a one-eighty on 'em.”
“What should I say? 'By the way, Dean, I'm not a woman'? Just like that?”
Benny nodded as he pulled a sandwich and a container of fruit salad out of his little cooler. He raised his eyebrows in question; Castiel nodded minutely, trying not to jog his head too much. Benny sat next to him at the table. “Oughta be,” he said. “He practically raised that boy after their mom died, his pop being…” He broke off, frowning, as if he'd realized he was about to cross some line. “Well, let's just say the old man never really got over her death, huh? So, there was Dean left with little Sammy, and Dean did his goddamn best, and the kid grows up good. Real good. Smart, good heart. Got a full ride to Stanford, even. Damn right Dean's proud.”
Dean starts walking, not looking to see if Castiel is following, because he knows he is.
Oh, god

is what you need most? All this nothing?”
Dean feels something stirring. He’s building something up, in his body, under his skin. A challenge to the nothingness that mocks them. A challenge to himself.

Dean does not reach out to take Castiel’s hand. He stands still, very still, in the limitless light and sound. “Cas.” His voice sounds strange in this place. “What are you doing here?” He flicks his eyes away, back. “Where
Castiel stares into the void. His left hand is twitching slightly. Dean watches it. “No, it’s gone.” Castiel’s voice is heavy. “Maybe it was never there.”

“Like what?” Castiel asked, eyebrows raised challengingly.
Sam stood with a small grunt and a sigh. “Do you need anything?” he asked at last, gently. “You hungry? You haven’t eaten since —”

They went to bed early again, though they didn't turn immediately to sleep, instead lying on their backs, Castiel's head pillowed in the hollow of Dean's shoulder. “So what are you going to do now, babe?” Dean asked after a several minutes of warm, comfortable silence.
They drank wine – Castiel in quick gulps, Dean in slow sips – and Castiel talked until he couldn't think of anything more to say, though he knew there
The prospect of being able to talk to Charlie on the weekend shifted a bit of the weight off Castiel's mind, and the memory of his breakdown the night before softened, becoming less painful and humiliating and more quietly sad, and as he went about his day, even the sadness faded, leaving him feeling merely wistful and a little guilty about worrying Dean.
Dean looks down at his feet, disconcerted by the sudden pain in Castiel’s voice.
Dean sounded like he was going for outrage but couldn’t stick the landing. “I didn't do nothin'. Cas knocked the back of his head on the counter when he was standing up. Just a flesh wound. I'm off to look for ice.”

. “There are other orifices, you know. And toys. Toys are always good.”
“But what?”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut. His breath seized in his lungs, a hard, painful convulsion in his chest. Another, his mouth gaping and gulping for air his body refused. Once more, and then he could breathe again, and everything was suddenly quiet and still, as if the world were very, very far away.
Dean nodded. “I remember.”
Charlie drew her hand across her brow melodramatically. “Whew! Thank Hera! I'm too old to learn new names
Castiel had opened his mouth to speak, though he had not the slightest idea what he was going to say, when Dean's face split into a wide grin. “Hey, it looks
“Pfft!” Charlie said with a dismissive gesture. “Coming out is hard. You're not a coward for having to do it in tiny little steps. Give yourself some credit!”
I was, has been incredibly freeing. I feel . . . stronger, more confident and less afraid than I used to be. And yes – I'm happy.”
They lay a long (or short) time on the hard surface of their world, quiet now, the only sound between them their low breaths, the occasional gentle murmur of sounds that are not words but something deeper and more meaningful. The place is chill and bright, but they are warm in each other’s arms, eyes half-closed, just being.
Dean kissed him, placated for the moment. “Lucky thing,” he murmured into Castiel's mouth. “Take care, babe.”
Did he
Dean shrugged and turned to his own lunch, sitting on the other side of Benny, but his brow remained furrowed. He pulled out his food and started in on his sandwich. Castiel sighed and switched hands on his ice pack again.
He put his hand over his mouth, blinked at the ceiling.
“Nothing happens here,” he says.
Castiel thought, then he noticed that Dean's uniform shirt was missing; he was wearing only a black t-shirt. A
“Yeeaah,” Dean said slowly, and his eyes flicked down and back up. “Okay, but—” He stopped, coughed, and fixed his gaze on the bed as if it were suddenly the most interesting thing in the universe. He was strangely still for a moment, then he sucked in a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and stood up straight. He gestured. “We need to get
Dean’s eyes brightened. “Man, I like the sound of that. Like, can you put your ankles behind your head? Because that would be awesome. And really hot.”
They left the store two hours later, having spent, much to Castiel's alarm, at least half his little nest egg (the one he'd been saving for a new computer): not one, but two pairs of “modern cut” men's jeans and a belt to keep them from gapping at the waist, four casual short-sleeved men's shirts, one more formal long-sleeve, an Iron Man t-shirt (“Face it, Cas – you

to them, to be not just a man, but a man among other men.
Dean was sitting more or less upright in the tub, fully clothed save for his boots and overshirt. He was staring down into the water, his expression bemused. “What y’think, Sammy,” he slurred. He did not look up. “A fi-see-ter mac-ro-seh-fallus, yeah?”

He walked slowly downstairs feeling strange, like he'd taken some kind of irrevocable step without really knowing what it was. He felt kind of . . . happy, yet at the same time nervous and scattered, uncertain of what to do. He glanced around the living room, into the kitchen. He
He starts walking again; Castiel falls into step beside him. Castiel seems a little closer this time, close enough that Dean could reach out and touch his hand, if there were any reason to do so.
I mean, it's really cool!”
He felt like he'd been hit up the side of the head with a brick. “What? I – I don't . . . I mean, I don't understand,” Castiel stammered. “What do you mean?”
“Cas!” Charlie stood up and waved from across the coffee shop. Castiel waved back and made his way towards her and was immediately enveloped in a bear hug. His coffee sloshed dangerously, but he managed to keep it all in the cup.
“A makeover!”
“Put the gun down,” Sam says warningly.
He didn’t wait to see if the boy complied but turned and surged into the bathroom.
Benny nodded. “Sure can. Like a stuck pig, sometimes.” He smiled a little. “Well, if Dean says it's not too bad, you're probably safe.”
“Two words,” Castiel deadpanned. “Cherry. Pie.”

– strong hands on his hips, twirling him around. Wine splashed, but he held onto to the glass by sheer instinct, his heart beating fast as it tried to to jump into his throat. He looked up, mouth foolishly open, and there was Dean, his face lit by one of his best grins, eyes dancing.

Dean released him and sat down on the couch, pulling Castiel down beside him. “Shopping? What d'ya get?”

Castiel understands before Dean does, teasing the meaning out of the slowly shifting vibrations in the air. “

The answer to that, at least, was that his brain (or body or hormones or whatever the hell ran this particular show) didn't give a rat's ass what he wanted. He was apparently a man, dammit, and if it took over forty years for said man to realize it? Well, too fucking bad.
Castiel’s eyes go wide. “I got chills, man,” Dean continues, “though I didn’t remember Amara then. But now…” He looks at Castiel as if he has never really seen him properly before. He looks at that beautiful, careworn,
Castiel snorted his own beer through his nose. Dean laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world, mouth open wide, all his teeth showing, and that more than made up for the sting and the cough.
Dean kissed Castiel's shoulder. “You always look gorgeous, no matter what you wear,” he murmured into Castiel's hair.
But he hadn’t
Castiel sighed, sliding down Dean's body until his head rested in the hollow of his shoulder. Dean folded him in his arms, and Castiel could feel him smile against the top of his head. “Yes. I would like that, Dean. I would like that very much,” Castiel murmured.
“I dunno,” Dean said. He grabbed Castiel and tugged so that they both landed on the couch, somehow neither of them landing on the wine glass, and thank god for white wine anyway. “Silly, laughing, having fun. Y'know – just
They both dissolved into laughter, which settled into chuckling, which settled into kissing, slow now and easy.
Dean laughed and reached for his bloody work shirt, but Castiel snatched it out of his way. “Let me wash this,” he said gravely. “Technically, it's a biohazard.”
“Here ya go, Cas,” Dean said as he entered the room, a small bottle in his hand. “Unpacked any glasses, yet?”

Castiel chuckles, and it’s still such a rare thing that it makes Dean smile. “Perhaps. This place, where nothing happens—it held the potential for anything and everything.”
Then Castiel had looked up from the clipboard into humorous, moss-green eyes, set in a beautiful face, atop a absolutely

And he'll love you whether you identify as male, female, neutrois, Wookie, or whatever.”
Loss turned into grief and grief turned into a fear that rose up as a physical pain in his chest. He hunched over himself in the bed, unconsciously moving away from Dean as if Dean had already left him, as if he were already alone. He felt his body heave with strangled sobs. He tried to fight them back, pressing his fists against his mouth, terrified of waking Dean, but he wasn't strong enough.

“Yeah, but he
What if Dean left him?
“Sometimes.” Castiel's smile stretched out sideways. He felt suddenly and strangely bold. “My
His head was feeling a little light, now, his stomach a little sour.
In a fit of paranoia, Castiel shoved the button-ups and jeans back in a bag and buried them in the closet, under a pile of bedding they only used in colder weather. The hoodies and sneakers he put away properly. He hesitated over the t-shirt for a moment, then pulled off the shirt he'd worn out and slipped out of his bra. Ducking back in the closet, he grabbed a fairly tight sports bra and put the t-shirt on over it. He blinked at himself in the mirror: the shirt was a bit large, and its size plus the sports bra minimized his not-overly-large breasts pretty well. He smoothed down his ruffled hair (
beautiful, and wonderfully framed by those absurdly long lashes…
He turns to meet Castiel’s gaze, then, and in those blue eyes he sees everything they’ve ever done to each other: sacrifice, betrayal, forgiveness. He sees every smile and frown, feels every blow and embrace, hears every angry word and desperate prayer. Dean breathes in deeply, as if it’s the first breath drawn in a newborn world.
Dean shrugs. Castiel gives his hand a little squeeze. “I don’t think so, no,” Dean says. “We think Amara made the place and put us there.”

Dean played with the curls at the base of said cock, soft and spent and wiped lovingly clean. “I mean, I like uncut guys, too—that can be fun. You know, like a present. You just peeeel back the wrapping paper, and there it is, all bright and shiny.” His voice went soft, almost dreamy. “But I kinda like this, where it’s right out in the open, like a big red gumdrop, or a lollypop, ready for me to suck.” He darted down and licked the head of Castiel’s dick, which, despite the monumental orgasm of just ten minutes previous, gave a tiny, hopeful twitch. Castiel growled and gave him a sharp smack on the back of the head.
Dean waved his hands at the mess. “So now your
They stare at the slash for a while. The sound in the place has settled again to slow and sonorous, as if, once they’d deciphered its meaning, it is lazily sitting back to see what they do. The light is still bright and cold. Still nothing happens beyond the faint fluttering at the edges of the gap.
Dean reminded himself sternly – blushing? “Like what?”
. He kept running his hand nervously through it, and it felt so weird when he ran out of hair so quickly.
“I can,” Castiel confirmed. He yawned. “Though I don’t think I have the energy to demonstrate right now,” he said. “Maybe next time.” Dean brightened at that, like a kid who’d found an extra present under the Christmas tree, and Castiel, who’d hardly realized what he’d said, felt his stomach shiver in nervous anticipation.

to right-here-right-now.
Castiel wrapped an arm around Dean's shoulders. He closed his eyes, seeing his whole life before him, from his anxious and fraught childhood to his somewhat-less-so-but-still-anxious-and-fraught young adulthood to now. To what?

Charlie shrugged. “Well hey, you
Castiel hastily finished his own beer, and began fishing for his wallet. “Only if you have the time,” he demurred. “I don’t need it right away. I bought a dresser on Craig’s List, local, and my landlord was nice enough to let me keep it in the basement until I moved in. It’s not so much heavy as bulky, but if you need to get to bed, I can hire someone…”

“Yeah, well, know your enemy and all that,” Dean said huffily, and Castiel laughed again.
place ever? Where else can you get binders, bibles, and vibrating butt plugs all in one place?” Castiel's face grew even hotter but he chuckled anyway. Charlie grinned at him. “So you crossed that Rubicon, huh? That means you've finally talked to Dean, right? How did he take it?”
“Dean is
“Oh.” Charlie cleared her throat. “Oh, well, yeah, that might be a little hitch.” She fell silent, frowning in concentration, then her expression cleared. “But even that's not necessarily a deal-breaker. I mean, even if you do the Full Monty, you know, all the surgery and all the hormones, it won't change, y'know,

that your tits were suddenly AWOL?”
Castiel felt his throat close up, and his eyes began to sting. He and Charlie stared at each other across the tiny table, and then they both burst into tears.
“Dean…” Castiel says. He takes a step forward, almost too close.
Sam closed his eyes as the world broke in half. Tears began to slip down his face, cool tracks in the hot fog of the bathroom. “It’s okay,” he murmured. “It’ll be okay. You gotta hang on, man. Cas would want you to.”
“My look?” Castiel asked with a confused tilt of his head. “Um, I want to look . . . male?”

is crowded!”
The term stopped Castiel cold, as if he had been hit with high-voltage current.
Castiel had anticipated was a cool distancing. But once Sam got over his surprise, he burst into dimples and drew Castiel into a rib-creaking hug, and both he and Amelia gave him their joyful congratulations, just as Charlie had. Little Bobby had simply nodded, hazel eyes solemn as only a six-year-old's could be and squeezed his hand. Emma, a

So, of course, Castiel had to ruin it all.
“Cassie, love,” Dean coaxed, rubbing Castiel's shoulders, pressing his lips to the back of Castiel's neck. “Wake up, babe. Why are you crying? Did you have a bad dream?”
Not the vessel. There had been no Jimmy for years. The body
Dean embraced him tightly, lips in Castiel's hair. “It was just a nightmare, babe,” he murmured. “I'm never gonna leave you, okay? You know that. I'm never gonna leave you, 'cause I love you more than anything.”
something like this?), how he had struggled with his body, how he had slowly come to accept himself for what he was, and how much better he felt about himself and his life once he'd done so.
So in the end they went about their usual Saturday lives: errands, chores, games, cooking, TV. They discussed Sunday brunch with the family, Castiel deciding, after much solicitous questioning from Dean, that he was up to another coming out. Now that Dean knew, he felt that he could face anyone (with the possible exception of some of his own family, but as he had serious doubts he'd ever talk to any of them except Gabriel again, that was something of a moot point). They had ribs and coleslaw for dinner, watched an episode of Deep Space Nine instead of bingeing on Babylon 5
Dean raised his eyebrows, his expression ambiguous. “You sayin' you're dangerous, Cas?”
Castiel strokes Dean’s hair, kisses his forehead, his cheeks, his eyelids. “Shh,” he says gently. “It’s all right. Everything is all right now.”
. It was ugly and unfair, and Castiel hated it. Tears begin to well, stinging, but Castiel blinked them back, refusing to let them fall.
“Yes, it is.” Castiel pulls back and fixes Dean with that solemn, eternal gaze, daring Dean to deny him. “We have both erred, Dean. We have hurt each other, sometimes terribly, but in the end we always come back. Back to forgiveness.” He smiles a little, just a lifting of one corner of his mouth. “So, yes, it is all right. I have what I need most; I am content.”
“Castielle! What's
Dean.
Castiel’s expression goes blank; his lips part, moving soundlessly, then, “Dean?”
But then Castiel took Dean’s bottom lip between his teeth and worried it slightly, and Dean’s hands slid back behind Castiel’s neck, his fingers pressing against the nape, thumbs on his jaw, and Castiel shuddered. He grabbed Dean’s hips and held on, fingers tightening. He flicked his tongue out, a question, and Dean took it almost delicately into his mouth and sucked on it gently before letting go. Sighing, Castiel pressed forward, just enough to feel the heat of Dean’s body against his, to verify the hard shape against his hip, but then Dean was pulling back slightly and pressing his forehead to Castiel’s.
need this last consequence. Now just trust Aunt Charlie, and everything will be all right, okay?”
Castiel laughed, the knot in his chest easing and a few of the butterflies migrating off to wherever stomach butterflies went when they weren't tormenting poor idiots like himself. He stood, skirted the table between them, and caught Charlie up in a tight hug. “I'm so glad to see you, Charlie,” he said into her hair.

have been the best kiss I’ve had in the last, oh, three or four years, but I’m not sure.” He broke into a slow, sly smile. “I think I’ll need more examples for comparison.”
“My look?” Castiel asked with a confused tilt of his head. “Um, I want to look . . . male?”
Dean's brow creased. “Well, you just seemed a little off this morning, too . . .” he began.
Dean laughed again and moved his hand to squeeze Castiel's shoulder. “Yeah, okay – whole lotta baggage with that one. Got it.” Dean pulled away a little then, so he could look down into Castiel's eyes. “You know I'm gonna mess up, babe, right?” he continued slowly. “I'll try to be good, but I know I'll forget sometimes. I mean, I've known you for so long, and, y'know, habit and all . . .” His voice trailed off as he searched Castiel's face, eyes anxious.
A queasy feeling rolled through Castiel's stomach as blue eyes meet blue in the soft light of the bedroom. It was wrong, this body: weird, flabby bits; bulges and curves all misplaced; one part out of proportion with another – it was all just

this time they
Dean feels something cool on his face and realizes with a start that it’s tears. He doesn’t know whose. “So…I want to say I’m sorry, okay? I’m ashamed of myself, more ashamed than I’ve been about just about anything. I pushed you away just because I was afraid of being left behind.”
He found himself
a big deal, and I guess I just got myself all worked up about it.”
from when
Quickly, yet gracelessly, they managed to hobble over to a kitchen chair, and Castiel sank down on it in relief. Benny came in a moment later with a blue ice pack, which Dean wrapped in his bloody shirt and pressed back onto the wound. Castiel hissed in pain, but said nothing. “You got any aspirin, Cas? Ibuprofen?” Dean asked.
Without surgery. What would it be like to
Castiel wasn't convinced, but he didn't feel like arguing about it, so he just shrugged and said something non-committal and returned to his lunch.
Dean took one hand away from Castiel's waist to look at his watch. “Shit, yeah,” he muttered “And I still have to grab Sam's present and feed the cats.” He kissed Castiel's temple. “Hurry up, babe. I'll meet you by the car.”
Dean responded by enveloping Castiel in his arms and tangling their legs together and nuzzling his neck until they both drifted off to sleep. There were no loops in Castiel's head than night, no voices of self-loathing and condemnation, and he slept without remembering dreams.
God, something had to break.
brought the queasiness back again.
And then Dean was right before him, cupping his face with his big, calloused hands, and there were his lips on Castiel’s, god, so much softer than he’d even imagined, moving so gently and carefully, and
The first mover shrugged and flexed a well-toned bicep as he shifted his grip on the box, apparently unconsciously. Maybe. “Yeah, that's what your sister said,” he muttered. The other man laughed shortly. “Don't you worry, Mr. Novak,” green-eyes said more loudly, turning to flash Castiel a disarming grin. “You're the boss; we'll get ‘er done.”
Dean shrugs and buries his face in Castiel’s neck. Castiel smells like sweat and ozone and power. “I don’t know. Nothing. Everything. I was afraid of you being an angel. I was afraid of you being in a male vessel, afraid of what people would think. I was afraid of hurting you, of being hurt by you.” He looks up at Castiel again; Castiel’s eyes are clear and unjudging. “I was afraid to let anyone else in. There was Sammy, but he was always there, and that was enough of a burden, you know?”
, and you're straight. I know I look like a woman, but I'm not, and I think – no, I'm fairly
something, we won’t feel dead,” he says.
He scooped up the precious volume before its spine could crease and whirled around to find Dean looking at him with an expression of friendly interest. “Sorry. Didn't mean to startle ya,” he said, frowning a little. He sounded like he meant it, but there was still a gleam in his eye that Castiel didn't know what to make of. “I wasn't
He felt Dean stiffen, then relax and take a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Oh,” he said. “Okay.”
Castiel's serious expression cracked, and he broke into a broad smile, the full, show-all-his teeth grin that Dean so rarely saw but loved so much. He threw his arms around Dean's neck and held him tight. “It's so strange,” he murmured in Dean's ear. “I mean, I'm in the completely wrong body, but for some reason I don't think it's ugly anymore, and I certainly don't feel like it's so disgusting it shouldn't be touched.” His pulled back a little, and his bright smile softened into something almost shy. “In fact, it seems to be very on board with the idea of being touched again. And of touching in return.” He put a gentle hand on Dean's crotch, whispering his fingers over the stiff denim.
They were interrupted by the waiter with their meals. Charlie withdrew her hands and put them primly in her lap as the dishes were set down. Castiel, his head swimming, ordered another beer. Charlie laughed and ordered one, too.

“But, Dean —”
body. Dean had burned it to ashes.
BTW, the correct collective noun for butterflies, is, in fact, "kaleidoscope." Isn't that awesome?
“You’re gorgeous.”
"I’ll need to find you a doctor.  Soon.  This won’t last long."
“Please,” Dean rasped, “say something.”  He rubbed his forehead again, fingers dragging through his hair.  “Just say it.  Say that you hate me.  That . . . that I deserve to die.”  He looked at Castiel then.  “I’ve killed fairies, you know?  You can’t trust me.”
He stumbled back, panting.  His face stung where Alastair had scratched him.  Looking down, his eyes unfocused, he could see a blade in his side.  That was probably bad.  He tugged on it and whimpered.  Yup, definitely bad.  And his head pulsed with agony.  Vision going black, he wobbled his way to Dean, finding the man’s green eyes fevered with pain but open.
“He isn’t an idiot,” Castiel retorted.  Ignoring the fact that he himself was referring to Dean as such just a scant second ago, he scowled, staring blindly ahead.
“Hey.  What . . . you need something?”
Dean couldn’t think of a protest to that.  He fell silent, following behind Castiel as they entered the restaurant.  Castiel had clearly made reservations earlier and they were led toward the back, in a quiet, secluded section.  Dean, for one, was relieved.  It meant if Castiel changed his mind about anything, Dean had some cushion of secrecy.  The restaurant was darkly lit, leaving them further shrouded.
It didn’t take him long to get there.  The place felt strange, though.  Hostile.  But not from the forest which left him tilting his head in confusion.  No, this was a foreign sort of violence.  A defensiveness.  He fluttered up to the front window, peeping in.
Taking a chance, he reached out and lifted Castiel’s chin with his fingers.  God
Rubbing his thumb along Dean’s bottom lip, Castiel smirked.  “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
Swatting at the man’s hands, Castiel coupled it with a quick swat to the back of Dean’s head.  Before he could respond, Balthazar clucked his tongue.

The man smiled, eyes sharpening.  “This way, sir.”
He rubbed his face again and stood, tucking his phone into his pants pocket.  No, he didn’t

She smiled as she crossed back to the door.  “Yup!  Said he had this goofy look on his face when you skipped off to the bathroom at one point.  Just thought you’d like to know.”  What wagged her fingers at him.  “Gotta get back to work, boss-man.  See ya!”
Plucking at his bedsheet, Castiel muttered, “I asked Bobby; he said Dean took off.”  He hadn’t been
He looked at Castiel then.  That clear honesty he’d known for the last four years.  That same damn look that always dragged him back deep into this never-ending crush.  His cheeks grew hotter and he bit his bottom lip.  “You, uh, you sure?”
Scowling, he yanked on Dean’s arm, drawing him away from Balthazar.
The words themselves ached.  Castiel looked away then, nodding.  “Of course.  I . . .” he stopped when Dean’s hand squeezed his knee.

“Sierra came to me this morning.  Her mother died.  Just last night.  A . . . thing found her.  Sierra was frightened but knew a fairy lived here.”  He leaned over her, crooning and trilling, placing a quick kiss on her head.  "So, she lives here now.“
books he writes?” Dean purred, leaning forward.  He tapped Castiel’s wrist where it still lay atop the table.  “Gotta admit, I have to wonder how he does it.  Those scenes?”  He shuddered dramatically, lips curled in a wicked grin at the faint whimper he caught.  “Fucking
Castiel stomped and pointed at the phrase again.  In response, Dean grinned like he had in the hardware store.
Dean reclaimed the pad and tucked it away behind the counter.  “Yeah, I get that.  This day and age, especially.  Can’t even shit without someone writing a blog post about it.”  He leaned over the counter, slipping off his glasses as he did.  Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and yawned before replacing his glasses.  “Look, Gabe, he doesn’t have to do anything but show up and sign some books.  If I have to, I’ll pay for him to come here.”
Castiel sat back, grinning.  “You said a drive would make you happy.  So, we’ll do that.”
Blue eyes flicked to him and away, a smirk pulling at his lips.  “Do what?”
Dean also learned that Castiel had had two prior subs:  One, a man named Samandriel who lived with his Dom in New York and the other a woman named Hiel who’d decided to leave the D/s world behind and made a living as a photographer in Europe.
"And for what it's worth now, you have me, Cas," he feels tears prickling his eyes again. "You always have."
“Cas, do you – do you regret losing your grace?” Dean says in a voice tight with nerves. “Did I make the right decision by getting you to cut your grace out?”
“No, I just came back from the washroom.”
“How’re you feeling?” Sam asks as he returns Dean to his pillow.
“Don’t you want us to be together?” Dean interrupts. “Don’t you want this?”
“Why are you laughing?” Castiel asks as he frowns in confusion.
“One last night, Cas?”
“Cas,” Dean finally breaks the silence. “Can I ask you something?”
Castiel sighs quietly, annoyed at being cut off and slightly frustrated that finding a straight answer for such a simple question (
Castiel looks at Dean with sincere eyes and reaches a hand over to grasp Dean’s free hand. Dean looks down at it.
“Sure, Dean. Let’s go.” Castiel smiles.
“I don’t understand. How are you encouraging me? The last time I was in a djinn dream, everyone was asking me to stay and I had to stab myself to end it,” Dean says and takes a deep breath. That memory only brings back even more faces of the people he has lost. He instead focuses on Castiel’s thumbs brushing his hands. “How are you encouraging this, if it means your end, Cas?”
He decides to put the book aside to retreat to the sanctuary of his room. Sam and Eileen are already in theirs,and Dean is nowhere to be found. This doesn’t bother Castiel much as Dean has always been the private sort, which is why Castiel finds himself surprised when he bumps into Dean just as he leaves the library.
“My feathers were black, which is considered rare for angels as white is the typical plumage. They weren’t just plain black either; they’re iridescent depending on the light, you could think of them akin the colours of an oil slick,” Castiel says as his face grows blank in remembrance. “My true form had several animal faces too – there’s a lion, a wolf, an eagle, just to name a few.”
“You need to wake up, Dean.”
“I brought him somewhere safe, but far away from here,” Castiel says. He moves towards Dean, but Dean moves away.
“Who are you?”
, Cas, you have to help me out here”. Seeing no response but cold impassivity, he turns to Dean and takes a deep breath before speaking as fast as he could.
an angel, though not necessarily understanding
“Can’t I check up on my brother?” Sam chuckles. He pushes his way through the door and makes his way to the living room.
“Where are we going?”
“Cas, come on, you’re – ”
“Possessed? Really?” he says.
“I know.”
Silence follows as the trio stares at Castiel and he feels his heart quicken – a sensation he is still getting used to as a human, and not a particularly pleasant sensation at that. The silence has to mean something. Maybe he is not attractive. Maybe they are shocked to hear him ask that question given how unattractive he is. Sam is the first one to break the silence.
“Okay. Fine. But you
“Never mind, I was just being a little paranoid. Anyway, to answer your question, I’m not exactly concerned
“Huh?”
“Are you familiar with the Summer Triangle, Dean?”
“Not really, Cas. I grew up travelling on highways and navigating with maps, not the stars of the sky,” says Dean. He sees Castiel begin to roll his eyes as he lowers his arms. Dean has always found that to be endearing, but he keeps it to himself. “But yes, I can see the triangle.”
“Cas,
Realisation dawns upon Castiel’s face and he breaks his gaze with Dean to turn to Sam.
“You aren’t going to make this easy, are you?”
,” Castiel says through gritted teeth. “You cannot possibly understand how much I want this.”
Castiel shifts the car back to the parking gear and turns to Dean. He narrows his eyes.
At that moment, both brothers hear the creak of a door. Castiel steps out of his office, head tilted, face puzzled.
“It’s delicious. As always.”
“Dean you are in a djinn dream nothing here is real and – ”
“Uh – you’re welcome?” he returns with a questioning look, but Castiel has already moved away and is opening the door on his side. Dean clambers out from the driver’s seat too, and Dean moves over to Castiel’s side off the side of the road. They lean against the side of the Impala and look up to the sky, a black canvas punctuated by uncountable stars. They enjoy the view for a few minutes in silence, then Castiel raises a hand and points to a certain part of the sky.
Castiel does not react for a few seconds, then turns to lean his side onto the Impala. He smiles – that private, face-down smile which warms his face when he wishes to imprint a moment in time onto his memories; when he opens his heart in a silent outpour of affection.
"You tried. You've always tried to do your best. What you've done, it has always been to protect the ones you love, the ones you cherish."
“Hell, yeah.”
Castiel gives Dean’s hand a squeeze and returns to his meal without a word. They continue to eat in silence. It is a comfortable silence, again something which comes with years of being in each other’s company, but silence nonetheless. Dean thanks the heavens for the temporary reprieve as he tries to convince himself of the reality around him and brings his mug to his lips. Bitter. Lukewarm. Real.
using your powers to whisk Sam away? Is that part of my subconscious as well?”
Dean wakes up in darkness and for a brief moment, panic wells up in him. He then realises that he is on his bed (he would recognise his memory foam mattress anywhere) and that this is his room in the Bunker. He reaches over to the bedstand and switches the lamp on. The room fills with light and he sees his brother by the side of his bed, seated on the floor and head collapsed on Dean’s mattress.
“Were you spying on me?” Dean asks as he settles beside Castiel.
,” he finally opens his eyes and glares, but Dean can only look on transfixed. Those deep blue eyes which he saw just last night, not more than eight hours ago, yet he feels like he has never truly
whether you’re hot?” asks Dean. He feels a flush coming onto his cheeks at his unintended word choice and gives silent thanks to the fact that it is the middle of the night and Castiel can’t see it, not that Castiel seemed to notice.
deserve better, Cas,” and Dean pulls Castiel into a bone-crushing hug. He feels the salt of tears start to sting his eyes as he breathes in Castiel’s scent greedily. He tries to remember Castiel’s warmth, to memorise the outline of Castiel’s torso pressed against his, and he feels the beginning of an inhale as Castiel speaks into his ear.
feels real.
“You’re lucky it’s warm enough for me to not be complaining about the cold. As much as I enjoy my job, the prolonged winters here aren’t exactly to my liking,” Castiel says. Dean smirks at that. Castiel is indeed a champion grumbler, and if not for the cloudless sky offering some warmth to their skin and the Thermos of hot coffee beside Castiel, Dean would not be hearing the end of this field trip of theirs.
“Cas, before you interrupted with that monologue, I was going to say that you, objectively speaking, are attractive.”
he thinks.
“What is it?” Dean replies with a glance to his right. Their eyes meet.
Dean chuckles. “Right. And Cas had to bring you away.”
He slides his hand down Castiel’s face. “Your stubble – well – who doesn’t like a well-stubbled man?”
“I love you.”
“Dean?”
Castiel returns a soft smile. "That we did, Dean."
milk; with butter – Castiel settled for just plain sugar as he found that to reduce the bitterness, yet retain the original nuttiness or flower notes of the coffee. Yes, he has been reading up on coffee as well.
Dean finally brings his eyes up to meet Castiel’s. It lingers for just a second, and Dean flicks his eyes back to the cup. It is a cold day, and the steam starts to fade.
“This could keep going on for many more whiles,” Castiel says as he backs away without looking away from Dean. “And before you know it, you are dead.”
” Dean turns to Castiel with wide eyes, begging him to see from his point of view that this man in front of him is not his brother, not a lawyer who works in a law firm in California. That this
“Heh, yea, fairies. Perfect for us,” Dean chuckles. A silence falls between them again as they wait patiently for a snag. This goes on for another hour or so, punctuated only by the occasional conversation between the two of them.
Silence settles again, this time uncomfortable and stilted, far colder than their surroundings. Castiel gives in, gets up from his stool, and crouches on the ice before Dean. He places one hand on Dean’s knee, the other wrapping his blue scarf tighter around his neck.
Dean wakes up in their bed under a thick white comforter. He turns to the side and sees Castiel lying on his side, face peaceful and free of worry in sleep. The morning sun filters through the snow-encrusted windows and illuminates Castiel from the back, creating a glow that seems almost divine. Dean brings a hand out from under the pillow and traces his thumb along Castiel’s jaw, grazing the rough five o’clock shadow. Castiel snuggles deeper into the blanket.
“It’ll be a nice place to take a look at the stars. Dark, quiet. I mean – we don’t get to see the night sky often in the Bunker.”
Dean is about to speak but chokes on his saliva instead. He coughs and sputters, and Castiel’s eyes immediately widen with concern as he reaches out to pat Dean on his back.
“My time has already ended, but yours hasn’t,” Castiel deadpans.
“You heard it, Dean. You heard it all from me, how much I want something I can’t have, and,” Castiel breaks off as he lets out a sigh in exasperation. “This.
They break from their chatter over dinner and turn their heads to Castiel, who has been unusually quiet this evening.
Castiel nods.
“I was washing my hands,” Castiel sighs as he picks up the cutlery to start on the pancakes. Dean eyes him and takes an even louder sip.
His green eyes flit down and linger on Castiel’s lips. He runs his thumb over them, and Castiel inhales sharply. “And your lips. They’re pink and moisturised, but only because I’ve been reminding you to hydrate yourself all the time. Lips like yours are a sign of health and humans are always looking out for a healthy partner.”
standing beside him – just said. In the faint moonlight, Dean realises that Castiel is ancient. He is timeless; he has witnessed the transformation of chaos to order, the very opposite of entropy; he finessed the birth of stars and world; he saw life on this planet from its beginnings in the primordial oceans, becoming humanity – and yet, all these would have been just an infinitesimal fraction of his existence. Dean shudders at the thought of the scale of, to put it simply, Castiel. His true form, once as large as the Chrysler Building, about a thousand feet tall, now all squeezed into this man of almost six feet.
having."
“Cas, I said I’m fine. Just have some stuff on my mind. If anything, ice fishing should help clear it out, so we’re going.”
“Eyes on the road, Dean,” Castiel chides gently. Dean averts his gaze back to the front.
Dean watches Castiel pack up their belongings at his side of the fishing hole and feels his stomach sink. He sits there, alternating between feelings of guilt and confusion, at what he was trying to forget, that which triggered such a strong response from him so deep down in him that the outburst of unspoken emotion scared him so.
“Mmm, I suppose. That said, I can’t even remember what we did last year. Do you? We really must have been indoors the entire time.”
them, never truly allowed himself to drown in them.
Dean stares hard at Castiel and Castiel opens his mouth as if to say something, but he closes them again. He slides his hand off Dean’s knee, stands up with a sigh, and moves back to fold his stool up. He drains the last of the coffee, now cold, and caps the Thermos.
Dean furrows his brows in confusion. He had to steel himself up to ask the question and this was not the response he was expecting.
. What I – we have now, is beyond my wildest dreams. You. I
“Yea, Cas. I think so too.”
Dean chuckles at that and decides to accept that with grace this time. As he decides to make these last moments less painful for Castiel.
“Can we use those minutes for a quick one before leaving, then?” Cas says as if making a statement about the weather while mopping up the remaining maple syrup with the last of his pancakes. Dean sputters into his coffee.
“Sam? Eileen? Dean?”
“Spit it out, Sammy.”
face. It has been a gradual realisation – that he does not think of this body as a mere vessel anymore, but rather just his body.  After all, he has been revived numerous times and each time he was put together again in this body, though without the soul and consciousness of James Novak. Staring at himself, he muses if this is a transposition of his true form to a human one; that maybe, this is how he would have looked as a human being. That would explain why James’s body was the perfect vessel for him.
“My wings were big to accommodate my true form’s size. The wingspan would have been from here…” Castiel traces a pointed finger across the sky and Dean follows it. “To here.”
Castiel hums in affirmation, heart still jumping in his throat, but he keeps his expression neutral.
Dean feels the corner of his lips pull up and he sees that Castiel has that private smile of his again, but this time he wears it for Dean to see, and Castiel glows. Dean reluctantly pulls his eyes off Castiel and looks back at the road. Safety first.
Sam is at home now, poring over his files for his next hearing, but definitely not here in this house.
“Hey, Cas. It’s time to wake up. Remember – our plans for the day?”
“We should head back, Dean. It’s getting late,” Castiel says and he reaches to open the car door. He knows how much it took Dean to say what he said, so this would suffice. If anything, he has always taken Dean’s words very seriously when it came to human matters, and he feels relief at this unambiguous response. He stoops into the car and watches as Dean crosses over to the other side to climb into the driver’s seat. Dean starts the car, pulls off the side of the road, and leaves in the direction of home.
“Cas helped, just as he always has,” says Dean. He looks to Sam. “But this time, we will help him, Sammy.”
He stands shocked for about ten seconds, blinks again and Castiel reappears, and he swears he hears the faint
“I love you so much, Cas,” Dean says and Castiel gives a shy smile. Dean notices the little crinkle which appears on Castiel’s nose when he smiles. He catalogues that in his mind as well.
“Both,” Castiel says as he shifts closer to Dean. He places a hand upon Dean’s thigh and motions to the cup. Dean reaches for it and gives it a light slurp before bringing it down and staring at the final swirls of steam. Dean’s grip on it remains tight.
“Not like we’re going to push our beds together or sumthin’ like that,” Dean shrugs. “Anyway, I’m heading out to stock up on some groceries. Wanna come along?”
,” utters Castiel with a shake of his head, and that single syllable is tinged with despair, with admiration, with fear, with anticipation.
“One last question, Cas,” Dean says and Castiel tilts his head. “Were you likening yourself to a fish earlier?”
“Good morning,” Castiel rumbles as he buries his face in Dean’s neck. Dean puts the syrup down and turns in the embrace to return a hug. The hug ends up being a little too long, a little too tight. Castiel pulls back from it.
“Uh – I’m fine. All good,” Dean says as he closes the door and turns back to Sam. “Wait. You mean you came all the way from California just to
“What? No. I’m fine, Cas,” he turns back to the plates and finishes it up with some strawberries. “Could you bring these to the table? I’ll get the coffee.”
? And how are you finding the time to do that? Wouldn’t the partners at your firm kill you?”
Dean is silent and only smirks. Castiel, surprised by his sudden outburst of emotion, begins to feel the nerves. Perhaps he said too much, and perhaps Dean does not want to deal with this, which is obvious, considering that neither of them ever addressed what transpired in the room right before he was taken to the Empty. Castiel wrenches his hands away and leans back on the Impala again, wishing he was experienced enough to have controlled his now-intensified emotions, something which he notes Dean seems to be quite good at doing.
“I meant whether I’m physically attractive. By human standards. I was just curious,” explains Castiel.
” Dean cries. “
“Whaddya mean?”
Dean moves to grip Castiel’s hands and his eyes light up with urgency. “I will find you, Cas. I – I will get you back.”
. Sam is nowhere to be seen.
for eternity.
“You see the star in the upper corner?” Castiel asks. Dean nods. “That’s Vega – at least that’s what it’s called in English.”
“In a way, you could say so. But I thought there’d be no better place than to start with my own body,” Castiel pauses as he contemplates this. “My permanent human body.”
He gives Castiel’s coffee a final stir and brings the two cups out of the kitchen. He goes through the doorway to see Castiel sliding into his chair in a hurry.
