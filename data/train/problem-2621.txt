The only sour note of the entire night was his inability to answer several of Castiel’s questions honestly. He’d always been good at improvisation, though, so he had created a drastically different version of his life to deliver. He made mistakes, and Cas probably didn’t believe everything that he said, but he was gracious enough not to call him out on the fumbles.
Dean thought that they would be spending the dark night searching for a place to shelter, but it turns out that Cas knows exactly where to find one. Only a short hike later, they come upon a rundown cabin. Cas pulls out a candle from his pack and lights it, revealing a small part of the interior. The edges remain in shadow.
Add to that fact that he wants to make this special for Dean, and Cas is actually nervous. He lost his virginity when he was sixteen, but Dean is having all of his firsts still. And this one is the big one.
No time to celebrate, though, as Castiel would need something more substantial - he needed meats, and quickly. Fortunately, having lived with soldiers for years, Dean knew how to whip up a quick and dirty Feast. He quickly set to finding meats to cook, as well as a few other quick and necessary things, and rushed back to his room, where he set about cooking over his fireplace. Normally, he’d cook in the kitchen, but he wanted to keep an eye on Castiel, and by now Dean could cook over just about anything hot.
Besides, later in the evening, he has an opening party to attend at his sponsor’s gallery. There’s no way that they will let him miss that. Whenever they host a new show, all of their other celebrities must go and work the crowds. He’s technically there as a guest, but he’s been trained in what that means. He is an accessory for the show. He is a draw that gets the buyers into the building. From what Naomi has suggested, Mr. Roman has spent an exorbitant amount of money on this artist, and he intends for this gala to be a success.
As he waits, Dean finds himself people-watching. His eyes scan quickly over the patrons without slowing until he notices a table directly across from him. There are a few young men, Sabanto caste he can tell by their customary robes, all enjoying a good time. Most restaurants will not let them in at all, others allow them in after the dinner rush is over.
The Naga quickly buckled his belt around him, dropping his eyes so as not to meet Castiel’s gaze, before slithering out the door and through to the large pantry.
Cas’s face resolves in the inky mirror, his lips brushing along Dean’s neck. “You’re going to have to draw lines here, Dean. If I had my way, you will have all of your firsts with me tonight.”
Cas huffs in surprise. “Yes, of course I do. I was flirting with you the very first time we met, Dean. I don’t think my appreciation has been at all subtle.”
“No!” he finally shouted. “No, Dean, you can’t do this, please. Please, look at me. Please. You have three fledglings who need you. Please, I don’t -” he said as tears fell down his face.
Dean kisses him again, moaning at the touch of Cas’s tongue pressing into his mouth. Without any guiding being needed, Dean straddles his body, lowering himself to brush their chests together.
Long after the steps retreat, Castiel slowly pulls the wig off of his head and tucks it into his beggar’s bag. Pulling a dirty, threadbare cloak out of the same bag, he puts it on over his head and adjusts it to cover his own nicer robe. The final step in the process is to pick up some of the foul mud from the ground and rub it everywhere that his skin shows. If he is to pass for one of the Namae nashi, the unnamed, he can’t appear to be clean in any way. His short hair is actually too long for the lowest of the castes. It should be shorn close to his skull like a sheep without its wool. He hopes that no one will be looking too closely.
Sometimes, in the depth of night, he would hold the furs of his bed close and allow himself to believe he was holding his love. His precious little love. Imagined his smell, his smile, his eyes, his voice, his bright soul.
“Jimmy!” He shouted in dismay as his brother fell to his feet. He couldn’t help it. His heat and hit just that morning. It was night now, so it was a wonder he could even stand. And Castiel’s own heat would soon follow.
Castiel fell silent, rendered speechless. He’d never experienced such an act of selflessness before. “…Thank you, Dean,” he at last said. Once more, he clothed himself in the large bearskin cloak, so long on him that it dragged against the snow, before directing his eyes to the telltale rays of the rising sun. Before he could turn away, however, Dean clasped his narrow wrist, drawing the Omega’s gaze to him.
“Come on, move!” Rowena shouted as the deep rumbling grew ever more loud, and tall figures rustled in the surrounding forest.
Cas snorts in derision. “I’m sure that you’re not used to people telling you no, but listen to me now.” The bratty man points to his lips and says, “No. I’m not.”
He fell back, not fighting the tears that fell down his cheeks. He wanted to hold his son. His daughter. He wanted to hold them close. He ached for them.
Dean doesn’t know much about the history of countries before the dome was created. It wasn’t something that his private tutors focused on. His studies centered around his strengths, music and the arts. Groomed from a younger age than most due to his long lineage of celebrities, he’s been bounced between the stage and screen since he was old enough to speak.
Dean had kindled it that afternoon as the last step of preparation before night fell. Before that, he had killed and skinned a stag, whose flesh was even now cooking above the flame’s wild licks. About the perimeter of the fire was a wide, crude circle of upturned dirt. A week or so earlier, Dean had purchased a bag of enchanted dust that would protect him from fell creatures. Due to the slight wind, however, he had to dig a sort of moat and pour the dust inside it, burying it beneath the dirt and snow. After all, the fire was sure to attract unwanted beasts, but he had now defended it. Defended the Omega. Like an Alpha should.
“You have my blessing to do so. I’ll be right back with some food,” Dean said, slithering towards the outer door, only to stop as he reached to open it.
The beet red Naga cleared his throat. “I brought some of our best weapons. I - we - would like to purchase a blessing so that they’ll be more effective against demons.”
“Oh, good,” Dean said pulling his hands away awkwardly, leaning down to collect the fallen feathers to make jewelry with, trying to hide his bright blush at the whole affair.
Filing in slowly, several people crowd in close to Dean. He recognizes most of them, as they are his staff either in the house, or for his many businesses. He is sure that Naomi sounded the alarm and required them all to be here for questioning and debriefing. He wishes that they would all go home now. This is difficult enough to deal with among those closest to him.
By the looks of the vegetation around them, they seem to be in a dense forest. He recognizes the tall pine trees from Cas’s books, but there are so many varied types. Every single one is unique. The dome and its brilliant and constant light prevent them from seeing anything except the silhouetted forms of the plants.
They shivered in each other’s embrace for a moment before the sound of angered yelling came from somewhere behind them. Somewhere nearby.
There was silence for a long while as Castiel tried to force himself to take another step, but he couldn’t. He just couldn’t.
It takes more than a little prodding to get Dean to move on. His obvious fascination with cars is an obstacle that Cas only overcomes with promises to show him books and videos about them using his VR goggles when they get home. The word sinks in his gut like a stone in a river. He wishes that it wasn’t home to Dean, that they could vanish together someday in this idyllic place.
Without wasting a minute, Dean swam faster than he ever had, true as an arrow to the spot, immediately grabbing the other Naga, wrenching their hand away from his mate, biting his shoulder as hard as he could to get him to release the angel, before Dean yanked his mate to the surface, where Castiel gasped for air.
The man stares at him now, a concerned furrow growing between his eyes. He seems so familiar, especially the eyes. If he didn’t know better, he’d think this was…
“Because… because it would change everything,” Castiel said, sadness in his voice. “You wouldn’t look at me the same.”
“I really shouldn’t. It’s past -” Dean stops and purses his lips. He keeps making mistakes that are going to get him caught. Of course the Sabanto are allowed to flirt. They are allowed to do many things that Dean never will. They can decide who they love, who to marry, and who to have children with. They also don’t have curfews like the Yumeijin. Everything that he’s always accepted as part of his protection suddenly feels like an extremely tight leash.
He was in pain. Everything was sore, and his head throbbed. There was something cool and damp around his neck.
Oh. No wonder it was this one that brought him to life. His heart was so strong, his soul so beautiful.
Dean could not help but clench his jaw and shut his eyes at the sound of footsteps behind him, not daring guess as to whom or what those footsteps might belong. But it didn’t matter. If he had to fight or bargain, he’d get them away from Cas. From his beloved. No matter what it took.
“Dean, no,” Cas said, grabbing his face to make the Omega look at him, but his glazed eyes were too unfocused to meet his own. “It’s me. It’s Cas. I’m here. I’m here to save you.”
Cas finally looked down at his mate’s cock. An Omega’s dick was naturally smaller than an Alpha’s, and only slightly less sensitive. He hadn’t really played with it before, but looking at it now he didn’t see why. It was such a cute little prick.
She’s a close friend of the leader of the pack on whose land she resides, as her own pack was slain. While she will do work for travelers or members of other packs, she usually does enchantments for her own pack - though, of course, they do not trust her completely. No one trusts a druid.
This wasn’t normal healing magic, blood magic. Blood magic glowed deep red, and it was never this powerful. This was blue, bright, pure. Intense.
“Do you?” The glossy gaze is sweet and vulnerable, and something in Cas wants to dirty up this innocence. Of course, the other half of him wants to protect Dean from ever being sullied. He’s in constant battle with himself lately.
“That’s what giant kelp looks like. It is mostly in the Pacific Ocean.” Dean greedily scours the page.
If Cas hadn’t already fallen for Dean, hearing him sing for the first time, and every time after, even these disjointed pieces of songs, would have doomed him. He understands the entire country’s fascination with Dean; he feels it too. Feels it in his very soul.
Dean finds himself in front of Cas’s restaurant the next evening. He needs a new valet, and after the fiasco with Cole, he needs someone he can trust. If Cas will vouch for someone, he’ll rest easier in giving them the job. He came here only because the man doesn’t carry a phone, which Dean wishes he could get away with. He’s doing one personal errand in a fourteen hour day filled with tasks he doesn’t want to do, and the infernal thing hasn’t stopped beeping with notifications.
The Omega strained once more, giving it all he had left within him. He wanted to hold his fledglings. He wanted to feed them, to clean their newborn wings, to sleep with them by his side.
Dean sat down as he thought. [[I don’t know.]] Just then, he jumped up and slammed his forelegs down playfully. [[How about you run with me?]]
Today, his Zen meditation is marred by the presence of blue eyes that he’d only seen for a few minutes in the restaurant. It was enough. Dean is certain that color doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. He’s never seen it in all of his years. Beyond the color, those eyes seemed to see deeper into Dean than anyone else has ever tried to look. The questions Cas had asked weren’t about his celebrity status, his work, or who dressed him for the evening.
Dean is thoughtful and careful in investigating new ideas. His humor is genuine and mischievous. His heart is pure, wanting to understand the problems of this world and then solve them. In short, Cas couldn’t have created a more perfect companion if he had been asked to cobble one together from his dreams.
Before he knew what he was doing, Dean embraced and lifted the Omega off his feet, spinning him around, the Alpha’s laughter sounding over the winds around them. At last, though, he set the Omega down, but still held him close.
Dean looks at him with a hunger that sends a spark running through his body. Oh, he knew that there had to be passion lying in wait in this repressed man. He’s so glad to be right. There is nothing sexier than being wanted. Right now, it looks like Dean would devour him if he had the slightest clue what to do.
Dean turns to watch Cas as he chops some tomatoes and herbs. His dark lashes fan out over his cheeks; his long elegant fingers holding and pressing them into position as he cuts. Cas had called him insatiable last night, and he supposes it’s true. How could he not be? Cas is gorgeous, competent, funny, and incredibly sexy. He’s the most educated man he’s ever met, and that is saying something. His knowledge is constantly put to practical use because Cas is not scared of stepping out of line. He sees something that needs to be done, and he makes it happen. He’s such a powerful, striking figure that Dean often feels lacking by comparison.
“Here, let’s do it together.” Cas maneuvers to his knees and pulls Dean close in a mirrored position. Dean is patiently waiting to see what Cas is up to. It isn’t until Cas takes his own cock and presses it against Dean’s, circling both of them in his hand that Dean moans and holds onto Cas’s shoulders.
“R…r…” Castiel tried to say, tried to warn his love with the last of his strength, but he couldn’t speak. His body had stopped shaking, it didn’t even have strength enough for that, but his lips, his tongue failed him.
“Will I ever see you again?” Dean said, an ache burning in his chest. Now that he’d met him, he never wanted to leave him. He wanted to always be there, to protect him. To keep him warm. But to lose him forever…?
Dean is hesitant, of course, but his lip is trembling with the effort not to cry on this very public street. He hasn’t been hugged in so long, and never by anyone besides Samuel and his parents. His body is pleading with his head to allow it. When Cas’s body is close to his, his eyes consoling him with their kindness, he nods his assent and lets the man’s arms go around his back and neck. The squeezing strength of those arms brings him so much comfort that his battle to remain quiet is forfeit.
“I told her that you were so worked up about the pageant that you didn’t fall asleep until early this morning, and I was worried about your health if you didn’t get enough rest.”
They held it there, for as long as they possibly could, unable to see or open their eyes in the freezing cold rushing water.
The wolf smiled. That much was true. “So what, then? You speak cordially to me, yet you yourself are hardly commonplace. So what are you? Good? Evil?”
He was still so cold, though. Even the small flame in his heart couldn’t warm him, couldn’t revive his frozen body, limbs still turned to stone.
Castiel popped one of the berries in his luscious mouth, the taste bringing a smile to the his lips.“You say that, yet you have been nothing but gracious to me, a complete stranger.”
“So how is it?” Pamelia said, walking up to the other side of the thin creature that merely looked up at them with bright blue eyes, struggling to breathe. It seemed to be trying to speak.
That bit of information stings. Dean wasn’t aware that he was sheltered from knowledge, just actions. “It seems that you know more about what is being kept from me than I do.”
Castiel gripped the amulet up against his mouth to gently kiss it. His wolf’s gift. All this time, he’d wondered what this wolf wanted from him. And now he knew.
Dean had never thought about it as censoring himself, but now that Cas has said it, it’s obvious. He has to censor himself all the time.
Dean turns an amused look at his valet. “Are you suggesting that we sneak around by playing up my perceived weaknesses?”
Castiel almost just wanted to fall to his knees and weep as night fell and darkness enveloped them. It had been all for nothing. They were going to belong to a cruel master for the rest of their lives. It was over.
“Just leave me, Castiel. I can’t run anymore, I can’t stand, I can barely think, Cas…” he said, trailing off with a needy whine.
Cas decides that the easiest way to explain himself to Dean is to bring him to his treasure room, so that’s where they are going now that Dean looks like a regular Shokunin worker rather than a movie monster.
“Castiel!” Dean shouted trying to hold him up, even as he appeared to have no strength left, eyes rolling back into his head before shutting completely.
Besides, Dean was as content with snuggling against Cas’s body and talking as he was with everything that preceded it. Watching Dean’s eyes droop into longer and longer blinks had been a highlight of Cas’s existence. The man is as adorable as he is beautiful.
As it was a fairly warm mid-autumn, it wasn’t cold enough to bother bringing a jacket along yet. Besides, he hated how his left sleeve fell useless at his side, keeping his stump of an arm from holding or gripping onto anything.
Dean drew back with a gasp, pulling back to stare into Castiel’s bright blue eyes, now tinged with gold. “Are you sure this is what you want? I thought you said you didn’t-”
Dean gives Cas a blessing, another ancient piece of religion that is a holdover from their past. Once it is said, he steps into the waiting vehicle, and is home in moments.
“Cas…” he said, voice trembling. He took a deep breath, and suddenly the world was dark again, dark save for his love’s bright hand. Dean could still feel the power rushing from it, through him. He could hardly bear it.
Castiel swallowed, watching his shadow dance on the cave wall. “You aren’t far from the truth,” he said, drawing the cloak tighter about him. “But there is nothing you can do. I’m bound to it ‘until the twilight of the gods, when the realms will be bathed red with blood and the suns’ rays turned black as pitch.’”
Turning, he asks Eileen to zoom in. She does and plays the video forward at a quarter speed. When the on-screen Dean turns away, so does Cas.
“Dean,” the Alpha said, voice warm, love caught in his throat as he held his Omega. His beloved Omega.
“I apologize, Dean. Our castes are quite dissimilar. I don’t often censor myself, but I will try for you.”
Cas notices that Dean doesn’t return the hug, his arms hanging loose by his sides, but he leans himself into Cas’s body with intent. He wants to be held. Cas’s heart breaks when he realizes that Dean probably doesn’t know that he can hug back. This poor man has been touch-starved and lied to his whole life.
Cas wished he could say more, comfort him, convince him, say how beautiful his mate was all full and round with his fledglings, but the words never formed quite right in his mouth. The only way he could really tell his Dean how much he loved him was via his actions, which he was in the middle of right now. He was happy they’d found a position that was comfortable for his mate - this was his first pregnancy and a multiple one at that, so it was hard on the Omega. These eight months had been very difficult for him, for the both of them. But only one more month and it would all be over.
Before he could complete this task, though, Castiel let out a joyous yelp. “You have speckles all down your back!” Before Dean could react, the Omega was running his hands up and down his shoulders.
Looking around his treasure room, as he calls it, he smiles. The walls are stacked with paintings, the makeshift shelves overflowing with statues, jars full of trinkets, ancient tomes, and even dinosaur skulls.
“Me being your servant?” Cas asks with a snap to his words that Dean recognizes as his ‘proceed with caution’ tone.
Cupping Dean’s jaw, he leans in slowly, giving Dean time and space to back away if he wants. Instead, Dean leans forward, anxious to complete the connection. Their lips touch gently the first time. Cas nudges Dean’s lips with his own, coaxing them to soften and part. He puckers and parts without a sound. Dean catches up with him on the next press of lips. Cas tips Dean’s head to the angle that makes their mouths slot together perfectly. Sucking the round plumpness of Dean’s lip between his own, he licks slowly, waiting for Dean’s reaction. Dean moans, letting his mouth drop slack.
“No,” he repeated mindlessly, rocking his beloved in his arms. Dean was limp and cold in his grasp, motionless wings rustling against the floor of the nest. Their nest. The one he’d made especially for his precious mate. His Dean.
“All it took was meeting me, right?” Cas is a cynic of the highest order, a position that has been reinforced by years of struggle and disappointment. But, Dean has been so sheltered that even this epiphany is pure innocence. Cas is ashamed of the way Dean’s face falls at his sharp words.
The god’s shoulders drooped. “When everyone left, I… I tried to help those along our borders growing crops. Then that was seen as illegal and pagan, sinful witchcraft. They began burning those I helped. So I haven’t used my power in years. I’ve just been teaching, spreading knowledge to those who will listen, who pass through. It isn’t much, but it keeps me alive.”
“I, uh,” Dean said, completely disarmed by the little Omega’s boundless curiosity. “Well, I don’t know if I still do, but I used to. Mom used to mention them all the time, but that was years ago, so…” Dean said, drifting off at the now painful memory.
Despite their nerves, they are naked in moments, and Cas coaxes Dean to lay on his back. They could go about this in a number of ways, but Cas riding him is by far the easiest on Dean. They continue kissing once Cas straddles him.
Dean takes in the new discovery and tries to process it. He’s always found both men and women to be attractive. Maybe that’s more normal than he’s been told. He’s sure that some of what his handlers tell him is for the purpose of keeping him in line, so he isn’t as surprised as he probably should be. He focuses on Cas’s lips again. He knows what a kiss is, but he’s never experienced it. Now, he’s picturing what it would be like to kiss Cas.
“Has no one ever flirted with you before?” Cas can’t believe that anyone could pass up the opportunity. It would be a travesty.
Cas sighs but nods his acceptance. Uriel is not known for his empathy, and he’s never seen him go back on a decision he’s made. It’s over. “Okay. I need to collect my tips from the cashier first.”
Dean breathed in the air around him, the scent of Omegas in heat, the bitterness of terror and sorrow laced within it. He couldn’t deny what it did to him, what it made him feel, but he would never hurt a family under his care. He would never do anything to any Omega in the dark what they wouldn’t ask for in the light.
Inside the mansion, past the security checkpoint and metal detector, there was an ornate lobby with an adjoining waiting room - smoking and non-smoking. Several attendants stood behind counters as Alphas waited in line. At last, it was his turn.
Cas shakes his head ruefully. “No, but with enough money, we could gather everything we need before we go.”
“We can call it whatever we want,” Cas reminds him. “It’s not like it’s going into any scientific journal.”
“Yes. It’s kept under glass to preserve it. Without the protection, it would have fallen apart centuries ago.”
Smoke was rising from the alcove into the sky, giving off a beacon taller than trees, telling all with eyes where they were.
She wrinkles her nose and waves him along. She talks to him all the way to the table where she seats him, but she faces forward, so he only understands every third or fourth word. Honestly, he doesn’t care to hear her. His eyes are scanning every face in the crowd, trying to find the one he’s here to see.
He was alone with his own family. They were hurt, but not nearly as much as he. He’d lost everything. Everything he’d ever known and loved was gone. Had left him. Had been taken away. Had been killed.
Instead of giving Cas this tiny shred of dignity, the man decides to humiliate him. “You are fired. Leave now.”
Knowing that Cas will leave him soon, leave all of their world behind, is devastating. It’s going to kill him to let Cas go. Of course Dean is insatiable. He can’t waste his opportunities to be close to this precious man.
Strange how it was now. He’d slept by himself almost all his life. But the knowledge that he would now always be alone?
When Sam comes home from meeting with his advisor, he finds his brother sitting in their kitchen alone in the dark, a combination of morose and furious. After a few attempts at small talk, he realizes that Dean is seriously out of sorts. It’s so unlike him that Sam pulls up a chair next to him and tries to coerce him to talk.
“Shhhh. It’s alright, Dean. You’re alive. That’s all that matters,” he said, drawing his beloved in for a deep kiss. A kiss he thought he’d never taste again.
She knit her brow. “Wolf, this is,” he said, tracing a finger around the outline of it. “This is very powerful magic. I’ve never seen anything like it,” she said, staring at it some more before forcibly turning Dean to meet her gaze.
Suddenly, the grip on Dean’s veins was released, and the wolf fell limply into the water as the pain of his broken bones surged over him.
“Don’t feel bad, we get plenty of new customers. Do you know what you like? What you’ve got a craving for? You want an Unbroken one that’ll put up a fight? A Broken one that’ll let you do whatever you please? Or an Archangel - one that’ll do their very best to give you the best experience possible?”
Taking up the gauntlet, Dean stares at him dead in the eye when he asks, “Do you ever think about having sex with me?”
Cas sighs before answering. “I want to use this space to create a museum, a place for people to learn about our history that seems to be forgotten.”
And, for the first time, he’d been given a glimpse of what he could have had, the life they could have shared. And he wanted it. With all his heart, he wanted it.
Cas grins. This is exactly the reaction he wants. Dean is held immobile in his pleasure, waiting for Cas to take the reins and give him everything.
He looked over, sighting a strange wolf that immediately caught sight of him and rushed towards him, large blade drawn.
The sovereign nation of Kanpeki Basho was created hundreds of years ago when the existing governments came to the realization that the Earth was dying because of their neglect and abuse. Pollution and deforestation had led to increasingly foul air. Sea levels rose several feet, devastating most coastal areas. Entire countries had to be abandoned, creating a refugee crisis for the entire planet.
He abhors these laws that were put into place when people entered the dome centuries ago. Flaws are not allowed, let alone genetic disorders. Sam has been doing research into law and how the concept of the legal system has changed throughout time. There was a time in their past where all people were considered equal under the law; regardless of genetics, disease, ability, intelligence, or economic status. Sam is terribly saddened by the fact that although their civilization has advanced by gargantuan leaps, most of those leaps have come at the expense of individual freedom.
“Mmm. I love that.” Cas pulls his finger to Dean’s rim and adds his index finger to push in next time. Dean’s legs splay out to the sides and he lets out a guttural groan as his body goes slack. Quiet little curses fall from his lips as he acclimates.
When they leave to continue their journey, the monks present them with gifts. They give Cas a conch shell necklace on a silk cord. The conch is a sacred symbol that means having a fearlessness to share teachings and ideas. Dean is given a similar necklace, but his symbol is two golden fish that represent happiness and spontaneity that comes from freedom.
Despite the cold, his brother was sweating, trembling with heat and need, pale with terror. He clasped his little crucifix as tears wet his eyes. “I can’t go on, Castiel. Oh, Cas, they’re going to take me…” he whimpered.
Cas shoved the knife in The Demon’s throat, all the way to the hilt so that the tip poked through the other side. Alastair twitched and gurgled as Cas walked out of the truck.
But he couldn’t stop the tears falling unbidden from his face as he trudged on, Jimmy kissing his crucifix and praying by his ear, praying that his scent wouldn’t grow so strong, that Castiel’s heat wouldn’t hit.
“That I don’t know. I have a few ideas where one might be, but you’re going to have to consult someone a bit more educated than me. The Worthy are hard to find, as, being the only mortals able to pass between realms, demons will capture them and drag them to Niflhel where they drain them of their powerful blood for the rest of their lives - or, for the ones that have been gifted eternal life, the rest of forever. It’s quite lovely. So, there are only a couple Worthy mortals that I’ve heard might yet be alive in Alfheim.”
Castiel lifted a finger to his mouth as he opened his eyes. Eyes that glowed blue, and a mouth that shone as if there was some white light within it. “Shhh. Trust me,” he said, in his soft, sweet voice, but amplified as if it were echoing all around them.
He took a deep breath before he at last slid the card into the slot. A light on the handle glowed green, and the door unlocked.
“Put him right back to work,” Alastair continued, panting for air as blood poured out of him. “Heat didn’t even hitch. He didn’t make much noise after that whole fiasco. Didn’t cry again. Only said the words we told him to say. Like a good bitch. You should have heard the noises he made while I -”
Squinting at the lock itself, Cas determines the type of mechanism easily. After all, on the inside of a secure building, the locks are more or less decorative. A request to not enter the room rather than a mandate. Swiftly, Cas is inside.
He had looked at Cas then, realizing that their days were numbered, even if Dean wasn’t going to be forced into an arranged relationship. The sadness that realization had released in him was a deluge, and he couldn’t contain it. When Cas rushed to him and held him, Dean wept. He wouldn’t speak of his fears, didn’t want to make Cas feel beholden to stay when it was obvious that he wanted to take on a new kind of life. Cas knew, though. He always seems to know.
“I carved it with protection and healing runes, so that when you need it, you’ll have it. I even carved it out and put a couple drops of my blood in it and sealed it in - mother taught me that blood magic works best for protection and healing. And, that way, I’ll always be with you, by your side, to protect you, heal you, and keep you safe.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel said, eyes glistening. “I’m so sorry. This never should have happened. I’m sorry to have done this to you, Dean. You mean so much to me, but you have to let me go. I don’t deserve you. Go, find a mate here. Find happiness
Finally, he sighed. “I’ve been like this for as long as I can remember, bound to the cycles of the moon. And, what I am fated to do… I love. Few things give me joy as what my duty, my fate has given me. And, beyond that joy, I was allowed pure freedom one night a cycle. It was everything I dreamed of, hoped for. I wanted to do it forever,” he said, biting his lip. “Then I met you.”
The woman, obviously one of the escorts that are circulating at the party, freezes comically. When she turns, Dean finds that he is not a woman after all. The blonde hair is obviously a wig, but the scruff on his face is the dead giveaway. Unreal blue eyes meet his and the man takes a horrified step back with a curse.
Castiel turned, anxiously watching the sun dip closer and closer to the horizon. “Please,” he whispered, “Please open.”
This time, while it was mostly the relief at his sensitive wings being cared for and massaged, if Castiel was 100% honest with himself - and he wasn’t - it was partially because, well… he liked it when Dean touched him there. It made his mind wander, imagining his spouse’s hands drifting from his wings to brush across his skin, up and down his sides, fingers along his belly, palms sliding up his thighs…
“Yes, I would appreciate that.” Thick and warm like honey, Dean practically purrs. “Don’t be so careful with me, though. I want to feel your hands on me.”
“Dean, no, it’s okay,” Cas said, forcing himself to remain composed even as a lump grew in his throat. “We’ll be alright. You aren’t broken. Look at me,” Cas said. Obediently, his Omega straightened and met his gaze. The Alpha cupped his mate’s face in his hands. “You are not broken,” he said, giving him a chaste kiss, leaning his forehead against his mate. “I love you,” he breathed. “There’s no other mate I could possibly want. I mean that.”
He forced himself to stop trembling, instead sitting back and making himself read something inane on his phone.
Dean could do nothing but stare. There seemed to be no noise as it rushed back and forth across the lake, quick as lightning, slaughtering and smiting each beast that dared meet his gaze. All across the lake, everything save Dean that looked into the Moon God’s eyes or felt the Moon God’s touch fell down dead, heart stopped in its chest, the blue light from his gaze burning off their flesh. Dean was nothing but an ant to such a god, nothing at all compared to the very Moon itself at war.
“Mm hmm,” she said, pulling down a large tome with the words On Reversing Magic emblazoned on the spine. “What else do you know?”
“Yes, I’m fine,” Dean said, taking a breath. “Anyway, what happened was my mother became too proficient at fighting demons, so they made it a point to kill her, teaming up to attack her and her whole pack. They killed her, my father, my… brother.”
Castiel dismounted the wolf, laughing as Dean shook himself off and shifted to a human, quickly wrapping himself in his cloak as he got dressed.
“Right. Now, while I’m sure there are some pure, precious little druids out there who might perhaps be able to wield such magic, you sure as fuck don’t find them on a Black Moon.”
It was that damn tea, it must have been. Maybe it had something in it that made Angels trip out or something, Castiel didn’t know, he just knew he felt
Dean and Castiel breathed unburdened for a brief moment before countless roars of anger filled the air. Every fell creature for miles, drawn by the glow of red, rushed towards them, towards Castiel, towards Dean, determined to undone what Worthy Blood had wrought.
“Watch out!” he said, rushing to Castiel’s side to catch him when he lost his balance. “Here, sit down until you feel stronger,” he said, guiding Castiel back to the bed to sit on. He weighed so little, like he was made of sticks. It made Dean want to feed him, make him strong.
At that, Cas grasped onto his omega firmly, sending a shudder piercing through him. The Alpha immediately began to work, pumping, twisting, thumbing his omega’s slit as his mate writhed beneath him, moaning with need.
“No!” he said, shaking his head. “Not that. I mean me. I can’t give you pups, and when we try I end up…” he said, grasping his belly, “with
Dean broke into tears. Not from pain or hurt, but because for the first time in what felt like years, he felt truly loved. Like someone cared about him. He came with a soft cry in Cas’s arms, where Cas held him close as he knotted his beloved. Held him so tight.
They are just a few minutes into the video, the part where the fake Dean staggers and his shirt falls off his shoulder, when Cas makes a choked sound and jumps up. “Stop!”
“What?” Dean asked, still coming off the high of the scent and the feeling of Omega on his lap. God, Castiel was still astride him, arousing him even more.
Cas starts to find a rhythm, tiny undulations that are driving Dean fucking insane, a gentle, minute back-and-forth that’s just enough for Dean to be constantly reminded of how ridiculously huge Cas’s hand feels inside him.
“That’s just the way some people are,” Dean replies, “It’s fine, don’t let it get to you,” he adds, fully aware of what a hypocrite he’s being.
He could lose himself in those eyes, most likely would have if he weren’t interrupted by a voice beside him.
Cas keeps his pace nice and easy, steadily rocking into Dean, his unshaven cheek rasping against Dean’s neck as he buries his face there. Dean gasps right along with him as he tips over the edge, muscles flexing beneath Dean’s hands, growling into Dean’s ear.
if I got involved.” He’s still ashamed of that, but it’s more bearable now that he’s opened up to Charlie about it. Go figure. “But Cas was furious, didn’t give a shit at
“Well,” Dean says awkwardly. “I should probably—” he says, making a vague gesture at what a disheveled mess he is. Cas is hardly worse for wear, looks just as good as he did when he walked in, and Dean feels another pang of desire that he hastily stifles. “G’night,” he mumbles, turning away so he can slink off to process all this in the privacy of his bedroom.
Apparently Dean’s initial response of, “Oh hell no,” wasn’t clear enough, because instead of  taking him at his word and dropping the subject like a
person that attacked him?” he asks, determined to sound calm and businesslike. If they’re going to declare this a ghost sighting they need a bit more to go on than ‘pale and mysterious.’
Before long Cas snakes one hand between them with the clear intention of getting himself off. Dean doesn’t try to take over. Frankly, he likes watching – Cas’s long, thick fingers wrapped around his cock, his muscles flexing, eyes closed as he groans loudly, coming hard all over both their stomachs, spilling into his own hand. Dean knows that Cas finds pleasure in just about everything they do but it’s still a thrill every time to see that Cas feels good, that Dean can give that to him. It’s flattering,
When they finally part, Dean can’t hold back a goofy smile because yeah, they just did that. Wow. He’s a little embarrassed to feel his eyes prickling, but he resists the urge to brush it off or squash those feelings down. This is a
let alone trying to cram himself into a comfortable sleeping position, but hey, if he’s so concerned about it, maybe Dean can talk him into a massage once they get back. And that’s a thought that makes Dean’s foot even heavier on the accelerator – Cas a solid weight on top of him, powerful hands working Dean over until he turns into putty, melting into the bedding. And Cas is always so
When they put the game away, Dean’s eye is drawn to the jigsaw puzzle he’d quickly passed over the first time around. Cas is on board, so they clear a space on the rug in front of the fire again. Dean’s instantly reminded of the last time they were down here, but he’s going to focus on the task at hand. They’ll get back to that eventually.
to do. He notices the blood staining his fingers and shirt and wills it away, as if that will absolve him of the rash decision he made, and tries desperately to interpret the expression on Dean’s face. The only thing he can pinpoint at first is mild surprise.
look is in Cas’s eyes right now, his intentions clearly written on his face. But they’re not in the middle of job right now; they have the chance to actually do something about it, no need to tamp down their urges until they finally have some privacy. This could be the start of something interesting instead of a tortuously distracting temptation.
“I mean,” Dean’s eyes flick down to where Castiel’s hand is splayed over his chest. “Yeah. Unless you don’t want to, obviously. If you’re not into it, you know, it’s cool.”
. Dean doesn’t miss the note of apology in Cas’s tone, can see that he knows Dean’s anxious to get back, is looking forward to it himself too.
“Oh, I know you heard me,” Charlie says brightly, undeterred by his repeated efforts to shut the conversation down or make a swift escape. “But I don’t think you’re listening.”
Dean’s always found that exhilarating, in any context. It doesn’t have to be sexual, or even have anything to do with Dean at all: Cas is just fucking
, he can actually do that now. He stops walking abruptly, and Cas looks at him with curiosity until Dean winds his fingers in Cas’s jacket and starts to pull him closer. His face softens in understanding as he meets Dean halfway, reaching up to cup Dean’s face in his palm. The way Cas touches him is so confident and familiar, and Dean wonders exactly how long Cas has wanted to do this. He sighs happily when their lips meet, squeezing Cas’s hand in his, pleased when Cas immediately squeezes back.
all the time,” Dean confesses without entirely meaning to, mumbling as he feels a blush coming on. His verbal filter has been slowly eroding ever since he and Cas became a thing, and right now it’s nearly obliterated by alcohol and growing arousal.
Castiel keeps his hand where it is as Dean wakes fully, twisting around so his eyes meet Castiel’s. Castiel wonders what else Dean would allow when it’s just the two of them like this, what kind of intimacy he’s been craving but is too afraid to ask for, would welcome if Castiel initiated. What he might be tempted to initiate himself if his tendency toward repression and denial wasn’t so deeply entrenched.
that Sam just couldn’t help himself, had to give into looking at his Google alerts or whatever the fuck he’s got set up. He fills them in on an article involving the president of a regional bank in Colorado that Dean’s never heard of – and doesn’t care to hear of now either – attacked in his office in circumstances that seem like some definitely weird
Dean’s luxuriating in the ungentle treatment, realizing how stupid he was for clamming up the other day, for being vague and evasive, because look at what actually
Cas is so hard – there’s no way that can escape Dean’s notice, with nothing but two thin layers of fabric between them – and Dean’s right there with him, didn’t even need that head start his dream gave him because everything about Cas right now is driving him fucking crazy.
with him, has no desire to leave or look for anything else. Cas has told him that so many times, showed him even more often than that, but it still comes as a surprise to Dean that he’s actually started to believe it.
The marks elsewhere on Dean’s body are covered (Castiel wants to see those too – but he doesn’t – but he
It’s almost too much to bear, but Dean doesn’t dare look away, couldn’t even if he wanted to, held in the approaching figure’s thrall; all at once he realizes he
to be quiet, but that idea crashes and burns once Cas undoes his belt, inches the zipper down, impatiently pulls his shirttails out of the way and wraps his fingers around Dean’s erection.
Dean sighs. “Yeah, they were,” he replies, as if it’s killing him to say it. But it makes Cas laugh, and that’s the important thing.
Dean’s getting into it now, stroking himself fast but steady, trailing his other hand down and nudging between his legs. He just barely teases himself open with the tips of his fingers, hissing at the pleasant sting – fuck, he’s still a little sore, Cas really gave it to him
“Of course,” Cas says instantly, and Dean’s sure he’s smiling, just like him, hears the earnestness in Cas’s voice and
Dean looks away, mindful of how incredibly guilty that makes him look. “Yeah okay, that wasn’t cool on my part, but y’know, sometimes it can get a little weird when two friends, uh… mess around like that,” he mumbles, hating the flush he can feel rising to his cheeks. He really needs to get his shit together. “But hey, we talked it out, right? And now we’re past it. No big deal.” He tries to smile and sound convincing. He just hopes Cas doesn’t notice how badly he fails on both counts.
Dean swallows, wants to make this right, to avoid going through this ever again if they can help it. “Look, I could… I could stand to be a little more open about that stuff. Like, you know, I’ve
Too soon, Cas pulls back and kisses along Dean’s hip, leaves another mark on the sensitive flesh of his inner thigh. Dean spreads his legs, holds his breath and hopes that Cas is going to put his tongue to use elsewhere, but Cas apparently has other plans.
But the need is still stronger when Dean is physically near to him, when Castiel is able to look at him, get even closer and
Meanwhile Dean’s needy and frantic, eagerly arching into each touch, shamelessly wrapping himself around Cas. He’d love to blame his embarrassing display on intoxication, but the reality is that he just can’t get enough of Cas, wants Cas to give him everything he’s got and then maybe do it a couple more times just for good measure. He pouts when Cas pulls away until he realizes Cas is just getting the lube, and then he’s saying a silent prayer of thanks for Cas’s forethought. Dean’s not sure what Cas’s exact plan is, if he has one, but for now he slicks them both enough so they can slide together easily, the friction making Dean’s toes curl.
“Fuck,” Dean says articulately, squirming as Cas palms his ass, “Should I—” he chokes out, “Should I, uh… like, count them?” he mutters, the idea popping into his head and flying out of his mouth before he can stop himself, images springing to mind before he can tamp them down – he’s been doing a bit of research of his own too, likely less academic than Cas’s.
. It’s humbling, terrifying, thrilling to discover that it would take him apart like this, and that’s okay as long as Castiel is there to put him back together. As if he’d be anywhere else.
he gets from Dean, evidence of how thoroughly Castiel has satisfied him. He’s definitely thinking about Castiel, not some waitress who could never take care of Dean the way Castiel can, and will never get to try.
He’s trying to hold himself back from being too forceful, but he’s aching for more, has to speed up just a little. Dean cries out, his fingers gripping Castiel’s hips and digging in, and for a moment Castiel thinks Dean’s about to slow him down again. “You can—” Dean attempts instead, seems to lose his train of thought as Castiel pushes inside him again. “Yeah— fuck,
Castiel tries to go back to focusing on the job at hand and not get too caught up in Dean’s presence. He rereads the brief article about the disappearances, but there’s not much information there. He’s already done some research on the area – some of its history, its record of incidents like these – but there’s been no noticeable rise in missing persons reports, no records of mysteriously slain animals, no deaths that can’t be explained by natural phenomena.
But he can’t just come out and say that, explain how he doesn’t want Cas to stop because he fucking likes it, and then he’d have to get into
at him then, doesn’t make a move of any kind. Dean’s not sure what he was expecting – maybe for Cas to clear off the desk in one sweeping gesture, wind a hand in Dean’s tie and haul him up onto the surface. Dean sure wouldn’t complain about that. But Dean started this, in his own veiled but ultimately obvious way, and he can see that Cas is playing along with it, keeping up with the charade of acting like they’re only discussing the case.
But if this is supposed to be Castiel’s punishment, being left to stew in his own guilt, then maybe he simply ought to accept it. “Perhaps I should go then,” he suggests slowly, “If you don’t need me.” He doesn’t want to bother Dean with his presence anymore, sensing his obvious discomfort. Dean doesn’t want his help, and that stings more than he was prepared to handle.
They find Sam a couple of floors down. “That took a while,” he comments as they approach. “You find something?” he asks hopefully.
Dean can’t help but be drawn to the sight of Cas’s hands as he shuffles the deck, taking the opportunity to give Cas a lingering once-over while he’s focused on passing out the cards. He’s looking especially good today, wearing a plaid shirt that he actually bought himself instead of pilfering from Dean’s dresser. He’s got the sleeves rolled up, a few buttons undone, and Dean’s eyes wander helplessly from his forearms, to his chest, to the two-day stubble lining his jaw.
Castiel was already relatively hard just from sleep and Dean’s ministrations, but his arousal intensifies at the reverent way Dean looks at his cock when it’s finally bare, licking his lips in anticipation, squirming and grinding his no doubt equally insistent erection against the soft give of the memory foam, breath already shallow.
Dean nods. “Yeah that… makes sense.” It makes a lot of sense, actually. He wishes he’d had someplace like this when he was younger, somewhere he could hang out without the crippling self-loathing – given…
Dean sighs as he looks at Sam again, injecting a little more drama than usual. “You sure it’s—” He feels like a parody of himself just saying it— “
“Do you see that moss?” Cas asks, slowing to a stop and pointing to the damp soil at the edge of the lake. “That’s rhizomnium moss.
denied you?” The words slipped out before Castiel could think them through, and he was almost taken aback by his own statement, but he dared to let it hang there and see what Dean would do.
It just wouldn’t be right to try to rope Cas into anything more… serious. He’s dreamed of Cas as a freakin’
He’s only just started the coffee maker when he hears Dean shuffle into the kitchen behind him. He still looks half-awake, standing stock still, face set in sort of disoriented, unreadable stare, and for a moment Castiel wonders if Dean will feel differently about things between them, will retreat into his protective layer of sarcasm and gruff dismissal now that things have changed too much for him to handle. Castiel did prepare himself for the possibility, based on prior experience, but the idea of it stings all the same.
been kind of a dick to Scott this entire week. And, as far as Scott probably thinks, a massive cockblock. “What happened to Cas?”
, never be able to get enough of Dean’s sweet mouth against his own, especially now, denied of this indulgence for what felt like a terribly long time.
Dean gets a certain kind of thrill from Cas smoothly pronouncing the words, voice deep, smile just a little smug.
Dean allows a beat to pass before he turns her down respectfully, but that’s enough of an opening for Cas to finally step in. “I don’t think that will be possible,” Cas says, hand landing on Dean’s shoulder and squeezing in a way that probably shouldn’t go straight to his dick, but, well, here they are. “We really need to get going.”
But Dean’s relationship with Cas has always been… complicated. Too complicated, probably. Finding Cas distractingly hot just adds a new wrinkle that Dean is not at all prepared to deal with, no matter how convincingly he assures himself that it’s no big deal.
into. It was there all along, maybe, that part of Cas that might find something like this kind of enticing, just kept in check until he’s assured himself of Dean’s well-being.
this is precisely what gets him distracted. Castiel is patient, kissing Dean slow and heated, wondering idly what set Dean off. It can be the smallest thing sometimes. Dean has quite the active imagination with this, and Castiel can almost feel him struggling to stifle the thought. Or, the more difficult task, actually talk to Castiel about it.
Cas sighs, and when Dean gets a closer look at his face, he actually appears sincere. "We're never going to build anything useful by ourselves."
on a phone call with Sam – Castiel is still keenly aware of just how much the band around Dean’s finger means to him. Castiel could swear to Dean a thousand times that he’ll always be by his side, but now Dean has the tangible proof on his finger, something he can look at and remind himself of their promise. It means the same thing to Castiel.
for it, has Castiel’s movements going erratic as he teeters on the brink of orgasm. Dean’s breath catches when Castiel tips over the edge, burying his face against Dean’s neck, muffling his moans as the tension building in his stomach finally bubbles over. He slows to savor the slick heat of Dean’s body as he pulses inside him, pleasure racking him in waves, rocking forward until the last feeble twitch, until it gets to be too much and he has to withdraw, immediately missing that intimacy and connection.
,” behind him, he realizes he’s only delaying the inevitable. He slowly closes the refrigerator, not turning to look at her but very aware of her hovering at his elbow. “Where would we even go?” he asks flatly. The question was meant to appear rhetorical, but in all seriousness, what even makes her think this plan is even doable? Their neck of the woods isn’t exactly known for its vibrant nightlife.
, but he quickly reminds himself that that concept doesn’t really apply here. He doesn’t have to worry about them giving themselves away by not being careful, doesn’t have to stop himself from doing even simple things that he’d readily do when they’re alone. He still can’t quite wrap his brain around it.
“You’ve done the same for me,” Dean says, shrugging off the thrill he gets from the affection and sincerity in Cas’s voice. “Not quite as impressive when I do it, though.”
Normally, angel birth was a private affair, carried out in the Omega’s nest, surrounded only by their Alpha to give them support.
He continues working Castiel up with light touches, watching the steady rise and fall of Castiel’s chest pick up as he switches to firmer strokes, his hips twitching slightly as Dean twists his wrist on the upstroke.
“Yes.” Dean breaks into a smile. “Yes, Cas, you freak, I’ll—” The rest of what he was about to say is swallowed up by Castiel as he crashes their mouths together. Dean is smiling so widely that it’s hard to kiss back, but Castiel just trails his lips up Dean’s jaw, nibbling at bits of his skin as he covers Dean in little kisses.
“Hell yeah.” Dean brightens. Some of his anxiety seeps away at the reassurance that Castiel wants him both as a boyfriend and submissive.
Dean can’t help the frown that crosses his face. He’s notoriously bad with rules…more specifically: breaking them. “Uh, okay, what are they?”
Dean smacks Castiel on the arm playfully. “On second thought, maybe I’ll just say I have no references.”
The pleasure that sparks through Dean is more than welcome after experiencing only pain for so long and he jerks in Alastair’s grip, except he imagines it as Castiel instead. He closes his eyes and imagines that it’s Castiel he’s bound for, imagines that deep voice whispering against his skin, encouraging him with filthy words of praise, and then he’s sighing and spilling into his hand.
The day after, Dean had texted and apologized for having to end the night early because of him, to which Castiel replied that 2am is by no means early and that he still had a wonderful time. Since then they’ve been texting non-stop—mostly shameless flirting—but Dean still didn’t really expect Castiel to show up tonight, and now that he’s here, Dean’s nervous. Well, more nervous than usual.
Most of said mess is Castiel’s collection of books. Dean thought he had a lot of movies, but Castiel has to have at least twice the number of books. They’re stuffed onto multiple bookshelves and on top of his dresser and there are endless stacks leaning against each other on the floor. Dean thinks if he stomped his foot hard enough he could send the piles toppling like dominos.
Dean focuses on shuffling the cards, trying to ignore the anger bubbling up under his skin. What does Meg mean by 'everything'? Surely not
He had been too nervous to eat breakfast this morning and now his stomach is rumbling. There’s a coffee shop on the way home and Dean decides to treat himself. He feels a little guilty as he opens the door, the little bell tinkling to announce his arrival. Castiel gave him some cash and Dean finally relented and took the money, swearing to himself he wouldn’t use it. He hated relying on Castiel for money. Hence the job search.
Dean pushes the blankets off and crawls to the edge of the mattress. He rests on his knees and lifts a hand to caress Castiel’s face, running his thumb over the lines breaking up the perfection of his skin.
The accompanying sounds of approval coming from Castiel as he spoons soup into his mouth or chews on the fluffy, still-warm bread…well, they’re just an added bonus, and if the noises coming from his kitchen are in any way borderline pornographic, Dean doesn’t comment, nor does he mind.
Doctor Pavlovská doesn’t fit in with the image of shrinks he has in his head. None of that ‘and how does that make you feel?’ crap he’d always assumed went hand-in-hand with therapy.
Dean shifts, sitting up slowly and feeling like he’s going to throw up as he rights himself and kneels on the edge of the bed, looking up at Alastair. “Master?”
Over the sound of his own ragged breathing Castiel can hear Dean gasping for breath, choking and coughing like an avid smoker with only one lung. Even from the other side of the room Castiel can see the angry redness on Dean’s neck from how hard he’s pulling away from the unrelenting chain. He snaps out of his momentary stillness. If Dean keeps it up he’s going to hurt himself…more than he already has.
“Let me help you. If he’s threatening you or blackmailing you, whatever it is does not trap you with him. You have options, just—just let me help you.”
Dean rights himself with Castiel’s help and sits with his back away from the couch. He notices it doesn’t hurt as much anymore and raises a hand to touch at his shoulder, cringing when he makes contact with the open welt there and his fingers come back pink and sticky with the ointment Castiel applied.
He listens to the click as the line disconnects then puts his phone back in his pocket. He sits in the parking lot, staring at himself in the mirror, fussing with his hair and trying to make himself look presentable. Brick House is only a few blocks away so he has time to spare, but he gives up after realizing there isn’t much he can do about his swollen eyes or the handprint brightly adorning his cheek.
They stop in front of a store with half-naked mannequins in the window, all modelling fancy-looking underwear and lingerie sets. Dean can put two and two together well enough to figure out what Castiel is getting at.
They lie together for a while, content in the silence between them as they come down. Eventually, Castiel shifts and Dean reluctantly lets go.
Dean opens his eyes and watches Castiel staring off at nothing, his hand stilling in Dean’s hair. “Hey,” he says, “No more thinking about work.”
Castiel stands so that he and Alastair are eye-to-eye. “I don’t believe we’ve actually met.” His voice rumbles through Dean’s chest. He clutches tightly at Castiel’s arm still wrapped around his waist.
He shakes his head in short jerks, looks out at the crowd, “Please stop this,” he begs, “I don’t want this.” A few of them look concerned, but most of them are just aroused. The concerned onlookers dwindle when Dean chokes out a moan as the man tonguing his ass slips in a finger at the same time as he plays with Dean’s balls.
The fact that Dean’s been researching BDSM for the past hour isn’t exactly helping quell the constant itch. But he wants to know how these relationships are actually supposed to work. He has to wade through a lot of crap, but every once in a while he lands on a useful article or blog post from people who aren’t just spouting bullshit.
His mind is screaming at him to just leave, bolt for the door and avoid the possibility of angering his Master further, but he senses that Alastair is displeased with him and that’s somehow worse.
Dean finds him sitting on the floor in front of the shelf, mulling over two movies in his hands. Dean watches as he moves, his knitted sweater shifting and revealing a sliver of tanned skin that appears even darker against the cream of the wool.
“You don’t have to,” Charlie starts, but Dean is already up, quickly slipping behind the counter to make Charlie a cappuccino.
Dean takes that as invitation and is on his knees in front of Castiel in a flash. Castiel sets the laptop next to him on the couch and scoots closer to the edge of the cushion. He starts undoing his pants, but Dean bats his hands away.
Castiel sits up and looks at the clock. “Oh. Well, I’m almost done. I’ll just be a few more minutes.”
But even with Dean next to him, Castiel still has nightmares. Dean gets awoken in the middle of the night to Castiel thrashing around in the sheets, whimpering in his sleep.
Chatting with Charlie has always been easy and even after years of not speaking it feels just like it used to back in their university days. Dean and Charlie talk for so long that Dean loses track of time and doesn’t realize he was supposed to start his shift until there’s a lineup of customers and an angry woman shouting at Tessa.
“Yes, you did, and you need to tell him that you’ve had too much to drink to participate in a scene tonight.”
“I just want to clarify that this isn’t a twenty-four-seven arrangement; when we aren’t in a scene we’re just boyfriends.”
Castiel’s head tilts slightly. “Why?” He lifts Dean’s hands again and at the grumble of disapproval he places a kiss to Dean’s wrist over the cuff and reassures, “I’m not saying no, I’m just genuinely curious.”
Castiel puts on some music while he reads in his armchair and Dean lies across the couch spending some time on the laptop. It’s nice being in each other’s company, but Dean still wishes Castiel would close that damn book and fuck his brains out already.
He reaches for the fly of Castiel’s pants but jumps when Castiel grabs his hands. His eyes dart up to Castiel’s, pupils overtaking the blue. “Stop,” he says firmly, sending shivers through Dean, and yeah, he can’t wait to see this side of Castiel in full effect. Powerful; commanding; dominating. Dean shivers again just thinking about all the things he wants Castiel to do to him.
Dean thought he would finally get what he’s been craving, but this isn’t at all what he wants. He looks down at the little circle of rice on the floor, then back up at Castiel. Instead of moving, Dean stands still, holding his ground.
Castiel doesn’t leave him waiting for long. Dean’s barely settled in his position when Castiel comes out of his bedroom. Dean listens to the soft padding of his feet across the hardwood floor until Castiel is in front of him, sinking into the couch and placing a leg on either side of Dean, boxing him in.
Castiel picks up the length of braided rope from the bed and uncurls it. “You’re going to look so good all wrapped up for me,” he says from behind Dean.
They order pizza for dinner and stay on the couch with Dean’s head in Castiel’s lap, talking quietly while they wait for their food, and Dean can think of a dozen places he wants Castiel’s fingers more than in his hair, but for now he’s content to sit peacefully on the couch with his boyfriend.
It’s colder than the weather report said it would be this morning. The thick branches of the trees along the trails block out most of the sun’s warmth. Snow still sticks to the ground here, slowly melting as spring tries to reclaim the land.
The man in his mouth stills and comes with a grunt. Dean spits the release on the floor when he withdraws. He’s panting, sweat soaks his hair and runs along his neck down his back.
“She said she was disappointed you had to miss your appointment,” Castiel continues, “and was wondering if you wanted to reschedule. She has time Wednesday and Thursday afternoon next week.”
Castiel chuckles as he sits back up. Dean’s positive the way he rubs his ass over Dean’s cock is entirely intentional, done just to torture him.
“I mean after last night we’re done, right? You’re done with me.” Dean can feel the sting of tears behind his eyes and he curses himself for crying so easily, but he feels so defeated. In a matter of hours, his life has been upended. He’s not sure what he’s supposed to do now.
Dean wallows in self-pity for the way he treated Castiel. It’s time for his weekly performance with Alastair at the club and Dean’s nerves are through the roof.
Dean stares into Castiel’s eyes, seeing only adoration reflected back in the endless blue. And then they’re leaning towards each other and Castiel presses a chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. He’s been craving harsh touches from Castiel, wants to see his more dominant side in action, but the gentleness Castiel treats him with is just as good. Maybe better. He treats Dean like he’s something to be cherished.
“It’s only orange juice,” Castiel assures him.  “Oh! I should have gotten a bottle, hold on I’ll—” but Dean opens his mouth and accepts the straw, drinking half the glass before settling back against Castiel.
Dean’s had worse though, so he just unscrews the lid of the ointment and gets to work. He starts with the long, deep cut that runs from his shoulder to his opposite hip, cursing as he rubs it in as gently as possible. There are parts of his back he can’t reach, but he’s covered the worst of it so he leaves it be and pops two pills for his headache before going back to bed.
Their conversation tapers off though, and Dean watches the crease in Castiel’s forehead grow, so he slips into the kitchen and makes a cup of the fancy loose leaf tea that Castiel likes.
This amazing opportunity fell in my lap and I’m currently fleshing out all the details but if everything works out I’ll be collaborating with an author and writing a book with her. (My first one ever!)
Castiel can feel the anger radiating off of Dean. He slows to the speed limit and casts worried glances across the car to his passenger, who’s digging his nails into the meat of his palm.
The hallway of doors leading to the private rooms isn’t far and Castiel makes it there without incident, but stops in his tracks when he realizes he doesn’t know which one Dean is in. It looks like the rooms are only locked by deadbolts, not number pads like at most other clubs, so theoretically Castiel could force his way into a room without the key.
“Fuck.” Screw dinner, Dean thinks, he wants Castiel to tie him up and drive him crazy right now. “Fuck, Cas, if you keep talking like that I’m gonna come in my pants.”
“I want you to understand that you’re not being punished for not going to see Doctor Pavlovská; you’re being punished for lying to me. If you don’t want to see a counsellor, that’s your choice. But I will not tolerate you lying to my face.”
As Dean sinks further into his role his mind begins to wander. He thinks about the man from earlier today and his thoughts drift to Alastair for a moment, but soon everything goes blissfully quiet. His mind breaks free of his body, soaring in that perfect headspace.
“That’s a given, hence the alcohol.” Dean raises the glass of whiskey to his lips, trying to chase the buzz that Castiel’s sour mood is squashing, but before he can taste a single drop Castiel is slipping the glass from his hand and sliding it away.
“Seems like someone needs to learn a little patience,” Castiel says, but he doesn’t make Dean wait for it any longer. He pushes his finger through the tight ring of muscle and runs his other hand up and down Dean’s side, soothing him as he adjusts to the intrusion.
Dean snorts. “Yeah, lack of communication skills is a trait that seems to run in my family. It’s like embedded in our DNA or something.”
Castiel steps into Dean’s space, so close that Dean can smell sweet citrus on Castiel’s breath. “You didn’t do as you were told,” Castiel whispers as he grasps Dean’s cage-free dick, squeezing just lightly.
Above him, Castiel is breathing hard but is otherwise silent. Dean frowns. Castiel is rarely so quiet during a scene. Sure, he’s only ever had a handful of scenes with Castiel, but Dean’s worried that Castiel is angry with him.
Dean picks out a booth near the back of the restaurant, away from the few other tables with people dining. He unfolds one of the cloth napkins on the table and dumps a few ice cubes onto it, shuddering as images of Alastair flash through his mind.
In the past couple of days, Dean’s learned that Castiel isn’t much of a morning person. So it isn’t surprising that when Dean wakes Saturday morning, the sun barely peeking over the horizon, it’s to a quiet apartment, Castiel’s bedroom door still shut.
Castiel keeps stroking him in time with his thrusts. The tears roll down Dean’s cheeks now, the pressure within him needing to find any kind of relief.
“I’m sorry,” Dean repeats. That’s all he can say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry,” coming out of his mouth in a constant chant.
Dean tries to say, “I’m sorry,” but his words are garbled around the dildo and he’s not sure whether or not Castiel understands.
“There, that’s better, isn’t it?” Castiel runs his hand through Dean’s hair, fingers scraping against his scalp as Dean nods in agreement. “This is how I want you whenever I ask you to kneel.”
Sucking Castiel off with a condom on had been fine, but actually having him in his mouth without that thin barrier between them and being able to taste Castiel on his tongue and in his throat has Dean growing hard quickly.
Dean watches a naked man kneeling at the feet of a woman who ignores him and laughs with a group of her friends, another one of which has a naked woman snuggled in her lap. The first woman’s fingers run through the kneeling man’s hair, tugging at it occasionally, and Dean watches as all the tension in the man’s shoulders dissipates.
“I tried to get it off already. Alastair has the only key. I could pick it if I had anything, but…” he shrugs. “He could come back any minute. You should just leave. I got you into this mess, but you can leave, get out now before something worse happens. It was stupid of me to think I could just leave Alastair.”
And there it is. Dean doesn’t want to answer and looks around the restaurant hoping that the waiter will save him with the arrival of their food. No such luck. He turns back to Castiel, but lowers his gaze to where his fingers tug idly at his napkin.
“C-close.” Dean chokes out, but Castiel doesn’t pull away immediately. He swirls his tongue around Dean’s length and hums before pulling off. Watching a line of spit connecting Castiel’s lips to the tip of Dean’s cock almost makes Dean lose it.
“Yeah? And what, exactly, would that be?” Dean tries to sound casual, unaffected, but he’s sure the hitch in his voice gives him away.
“There is always somewhat of a learning curve in a new relationship. Ours is no different. You will learn my preferences as I will learn yours, but I don’t expect you to know everything right off the bat.” His voice moves farther away and Dean turns his head slowly to watch Castiel as he moves back over to the closet.
Dean looks up at him, nearly a head taller, and smiles politely even though the way the man leers down at him makes his gut twist uncomfortably. He opens his mouth to thank him, but the man takes a step forward, pushing into Dean’s space until he can smell the stale cigarette stench on his breath.
Sharp pain steals Dean’s breath and his pleas die on a gasp as Castiel bites into the meat of Dean’s ass. He laves his tongue over the indents his teeth leave, making Dean’s skin slick and shiny with spit. The pain of the bite only increases his pleasure and he balls his fists in the sheets by his head.
The next morning Dean gets the Doctor’s phone number from Castiel and makes an appointment for Wednesday afternoon. The anxiety is still there, but he keeps the appointment and even shows up early, texting Castiel non-stop to keep his mind occupied as he waits in a comfortable armchair just outside the Doctor’s office.
Once both cuffs are secured, Castiel clips them together and Dean gives an experimental tug as he brings his hands back to his lap, just to feel the reassurance of the restraints holding him.
He doesn’t know why he’s suddenly crying and it makes him angry. He doesn’t want Castiel’s soft touches, doesn’t deserve it. He wants to push Castiel away and deal with this himself, like he usually does, at the bar drinking until he can’t think.
Hey, I wrote and edited this all today, so don't hold me accountable for any mistakes just enjoy two updates in two days as we barrel towards the end of this fic!
Castiel is talking to Meg, Dean realizes. About what she had said earlier. Shit. He may not particularly enjoy Meg’s company, but Dean doesn’t want to cause any trouble between her and Castiel.
Castiel maintains eye contact as he slowly raises the handful of popcorn and shoves it into his mouth.
Anyway, this also means most—if not all—of my writing time will be spent on this new project. Regardless, I promise to not completely forget about this story. I have the majority of the next two chapters already written so I’m good to go for a few weeks.
The praise sinks bone deep and fills the dark corners of Dean’s body with warmth and light. He ruts up, his hardening length rubbing against the inside of the sweatpants, gaining friction against Castiel’s firm body leaning over him.
He doesn’t know Castiel all that well yet and can’t read him the way he can read Alastair. He knows by the slightest shift in posture when Alastair is angry or displeased. But with Castiel, he has to guess what he’s feeling and it unnerves him, not being able to anticipate.
“Are you ready to talk to me?” Castiel asks, and Dean grumbles, but nods. “What happened at the end there?”
Dean waits and tries not to move around too much on the wet blankets. His only focus is the constant ache of his backside and the fact that it means he failed his Master. It feels like forever before Alastair returns, his weight jostling the mattress as he sits down.
A cold cloth is dabbed lightly against Dean’s back, a nice contrast to the fire he’d felt there before, and he sighs contentedly.
Castiel glances briefly in Dean’s direction when the floor creaks under his weight but barely pauses in his hurry to get his things together. “I slept in,” Castiel says, breathless from dashing around the apartment, “I’m late, and I have a meeting with that potential client first thing this morning.”
“Cas,” Dean whispers against his lips as he gyrates his hips. He’s getting close, can feel himself hurtling towards the edge of release, but the friction isn’t enough. He needs more. “Cas,” he says again, voice breaking on the single syllable.
“That settles it, then.” Dean takes the DVD out of Castiel’s hand. “It’s entirely unacceptable that you haven’t seen the Swayziest of Swayze movies.” His joints crack when he squats to put the disc in the player.
He does understand. He knows Castiel’s past now, knows why Castiel hesitates to say it. But that doesn’t mean it stings any less when he finally said ‘I love you’ first and it isn’t reciprocated.
“Oh…yeah.” Charlie runs her fingers through her short hair as she sits down across from Dean. “It’s a lot easier to manage now.”
The air is cold on his bare chest and he turns up the thermostat a few degrees on his way, hoping Castiel won’t mind.
Would Castiel punish him over such a minor infraction? Dean supposes he did break a rule, so punishment is surely in store for him. But would Castiel do it here, now? They may be alone in the changing rooms, but they’re still in public. His heartbeat thuds wildly against his chest as Castiel leans towards him.
He spends the day cleaning the apartment. Having a job now means chores like laundry and cleaning the bathroom gets neglected more often. Catching up on chores is a much better use of his time than sitting down and letting a stranger pick through his brain for an hour.
As Dean tries to keep himself steady on the stools he feels the dildo begin to move. It pumps up and down slowly, rubbing between the cheeks of his ass. He gasps and looks up to see Alastair’s smirk. “That’s right, this machine’s gonna stuff you and fuck you good. Now sit on that cock and give these people a good show.”
But Dean doesn’t care for reason, cares only about the broken sound of Castiel’s voice after Dean had said things he didn’t mean, had said specifically to hurt. And now he needs to feel the sting of a whip or the burn of a flogger, needs to feel
“Cas, I swear I didn’t know.” But Castiel won’t look at him. Dean’s not even sure he heard. “I swear I didn’t know,” he repeats, and Castiel runs a soothing hand up and down his arm.
“Dean,” Castiel says quietly, petting a hand through Dean’s hair. “I’ve told you before that I will never punish you out of anger.”
Castiel walks them to the living room and sinks onto the couch with Dean straddling his lap. They sit like that, slowly making out until the buzzer sounds with the delivery guy calling up to the apartment and Castiel has to untangle himself from Dean to answer the door.
Dean leans forward, wincing as the movement causes more pain to flare in his knees and down his legs. He immediately takes the dildo as far as he can into his throat, backing away when he feels himself about to gag.
He ends up going through the fridge and cupboards, throwing out everything that’s expired. He has to empty the trash can under the sink twice because the majority of the food is more than a year old.
“I love you, too, Cas. And I promise that in the future if I need to use the safeword I will—even if it’s during a punishment.”
He hisses in pain and tries to force his muscles to relax. As soon as the pain begins to turn to pleasure the fingers withdraw. Freezing ice is pressed against his skin, but after the beating Alastair inflicted it’s a welcome relief to his heated ass and thighs.
One of Alastair’s lackeys has to lift him out of the stocks and Dean drops to the come-covered floor when his legs can’t hold his weight. He shivers on the stage as come dries in patches on his body.
Dean stretches his arm as far as it’ll go, trying to get the collar, cuffs, and panties all in the shot. He has to settle for just the collar and cuffs, though.
As Dean walks to the stage he feels the anxiety that’s been simmering in his gut all night claw its way up into his throat. He’s been doing this for so long that it should be routine by now, but every week he’s just as nervous as the last, though that only lasts until the music starts. He stands in the center of the small stage and takes a deep breath, waiting for the song to begin.
Cold water is dumped on his back and ass, spilling off him and soaking into the covers beneath. He doesn’t have enough strength left to do anything other than lie there as the liquid slides uncomfortably down his crack and over his balls.
Castiel raises an eyebrow at him. “Is it? How is it any different than any other title? ‘Master’ and ‘Sir’ are just titles that indicate respect, authority.”
The man sees the two of them watching and beckons them over. He offers them each a handful of birdseed from a little plastic bag and instructs them to be very quiet and very still. The three of them raise their palms, full of bird seed, and the man whistles a short tune.
But once they get home Dean can’t seem to sit still. He wanders between his room, the kitchen, and the living room. He sits on the couch with Castiel only to get up a few minutes later and go to the kitchen, standing there staring at the contents of the fridge.
With the condom firmly in place, Dean leans forward slowly, parting his lips and puffing warm breaths over the head of Castiel’s cock. Above him, Castiel shivers on the couch, fingers twitching as if he wants to reach out and grab Dean.
He watches himself in the mirror as he raises a hand to prod gingerly at the angry outline of fingers stamped into his cheek. He splashes cold water on his face and wishes he had something to make his bloodshot eyes less red and swollen, and something to cover up the stinging handprint.
At a quarter past six Castiel still hasn’t shown. Dean tries to occupy himself, but he’s already cleaned everything and ends up fiddling with the throw pillows on the couch: flipping them one way, pacing from the living room area of his studio to the kitchen and back again, only to fluff and flip the same pillows back the way they had been before.
Castiel’s words float to the background of Dean’s mind as he lets the soothing tone surround him. He can still hear himself hiccupping and sniffling, his breathing still ragged, but he ignores it and wills Castiel’s voice to cover him completely.
Dean has a moment to reason that leaving the club with someone he just met isn’t a good idea, but before he can think too much about being chopped into pieces in this man’s basement his mouth is already working into a wide smile. “Hell yeah,” he beams, “Let’s go.” He grabs Castiel’s hand and pulls him through the club and out into the cool night air.
All of the lights in the apartment are off and Dean has to keep a hand on the wall so he doesn’t run into anything as his eyes adjust to the sudden darkness. He follows the sounds of cupboards banging shut and the faucet running to find Alastair in the equally dark kitchen, fixing himself a drink.
All the alcohol in his system is having the opposite of the desired effect. It makes his heart beat faster, makes him sweat and his mind race. Dean’s breath is coming in shallow pants now. Sitting so close together at the crowded bar he can smell the scotch on Castiel’s breath, feel every little shift in position, limbs brushing together in the cramped space, and it’s overwhelming.
He wishes someone could make these decisions for him. He doesn’t think he’s ready to deal with rejection from Sam a second time if he does reach out to him now, but he can’t stop thinking about all the things he’s missed in his baby brother’s life over the years.
Their shared guilty pleasure of reading bad romance books was how they became friends in the first place. After complaining about flimsy plotlines and how cheesy and unrealistic the writing was in their respective stories, Dean and Charlie swapped books and numbers, becoming fast friends.
“No, I shouldn’t have to do this,” Castiel agrees, sounding disappointed, and Dean’s heart sinks. He shifts to get up, but Castiel places a hand on his back, just below the long gashes Alastair put there. “Aftercare is an important part of a scene. Any self-respecting Dom knows this.”
Castiel grabs Dean’s hands from where they wander closer and closer to Castiel’s erection. He leans over Dean, pulling his hands up and placing a kiss to each of them before moving them above Dean’s head and pressing him into the mattress.
Dean jumps at the touch and Castiel quickly removes his hand, taking a step back to give Dean some space. “What?” Dean blinks and gives Castiel a half-smile to ease the worried look on his face. “Yeah, no, I’m fine. Sorry, just zoned out,” he mumbles.
Castiel agrees with a laugh and Dean takes the offered condom before pulling Castiel’s soft cock out of his underwear. He looks up at Castiel and licks a wet stripe up his palm before grasping him and stroking gently.
He wishes he could withdraw into himself, into that small corner of his mind, as he feels ropes of warm come splatter on his body: his back, running down his side, along his thighs. It seemingly drives the man in his ass over the edge as he’s pumped full. The man pulls out and it drips out of him and mixes with the release running down his thigh.
“Busy,” Meg repeats, glancing past Castiel to Dean. She barely waits for Castiel to introduce her to Dean before she and Garth are retreating the way they came to finish making a pitcher of Garth’s apparently famous margaritas, leaving Dean and Castiel to shuck off their shoes and coats.
Dean wakes up the next morning to pain shooting through his back. He curses and rolls over onto his stomach, hoping to drift off again for a few more hours, but the movement only brings new pain, lower this time. He squirms, trying to get comfortable, but the pain is too much and eventually he gives up on sleep and wiggles out of bed.
The man glances at the other patrons in the club, frowning at the sight before him. “I can assure you I know exactly what kind of establishment this is.”
His limbs feel heavy when he finally comes down from the haze of orgasm, but he fishes his phone from the tangled sheets and snaps another photo for Castiel.
They order in for dinner, flipping through the various menus Castiel has in a pile in the kitchen before deciding on Thai. Dean perches himself on the countertop while Castiel calls to place the order.
A warm body between his legs snaps Dean back to the present. Castiel runs light fingertips up Dean’s thigh, still clad in the comfortable sweatpants he borrowed, and up his sides.
“Right,” Dean mumbles. He still hasn’t told Castiel that he isn’t dancing tonight and the thought of Castiel being here, witnessing what’s to come, sends a mix of emotions through him that he doesn’t necessarily want to evaluate right now. So instead he orders a whiskey and tells the bartender to keep them coming.
and Dean’s hands pause on the button of his jeans. “Is that any way to treat your new clothes? Pick them up and fold them neatly, then place them on the dresser.”
“You can’t go back to your apartment and you don’t have a job so you can’t afford to rent a new place.”
“We need to talk about our relationship.” The breath shudders from Castiel’s chest as he watches Dean sink to his knees in front of him.
“I considered dropping out after that, but I wanted something more than working a menial dead-end job for the rest of my life. I wanted to do something for myself for a change, so I switched programs. I really wanted to help kids, y’know? Make a difference in their lives? And the only person who had ever done anything like that for me was one of my teachers, so that’s what I decided I wanted to be. I got into the Bachelors of Education program and the first day in I knew that I’d made the right choice.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean calls. Castiel takes a minute to look up from his book, but Dean chalks it up to him finishing reading the sentence he was on rather than a delayed response due to a head injury. “Do you hear that ringing noise?”
“Dean,” Castiel warns. He hadn’t realized his tongue had been working against the underside of Castiel’s length.
Dean sets his phone down in the living room and puts some music on the stereo before he goes back to cleaning, trying to ignore the pit in his stomach at having lied to Castiel.
As Castiel leans forward to reach for the popcorn bowl on the coffee table Dean does the same, intercepting him and brushing his fingers over Castiel’s knuckles. He looks up from their hands to see Castiel turn his attention from the movie to their hands, then up to meet Dean’s eyes. He opens his mouth as if to speak, but Dean withdraws his hand quickly and turns back to the TV.
“You were very enticing,” Castiel says, but Dean isn’t sure if it’s a compliment or not given his current predicament. “So enticing, in fact, that I got hard looking at those pretty pictures you sent me, thinking about how much I wanted to mess up those nice panties you put on.”
While he was in the hall Castiel, apparently, had dealt with the used condom and tucked himself back into his pants and is now sitting calmly on the couch looking at the laptop and not at all like he just got his brain sucked out through his dick. He even had time to grab cutlery and two plates from the kitchen.
“Awesome. We should totally swap numbers so we can start planning.” Garth shoves a handful of gummy bears in his mouth before pushing up from the table. He stumbles a little as he makes his way to the kitchen and laughs as he walks into the doorframe. “Had one too many margaritas!”
Dean follows behind him a minute later, sinking down on the closed lid of the toilet as Castiel fiddles with the knobs on the tub until it’s the perfect temperature.
It feels like it’s been forever since they’ve had sex and Dean worries that Castiel is growing bored with him. He would even be fine with plain old missionary sex; he just needs the reassurance of Castiel’s touch.
Dean tilts his head to try and see what Alastair is doing, but only sees his back as he opens the closet that holds all his supplies.
They come across an elderly man standing in a little clearing off to the side of the path. He raises an open palm and is immediately greeted by a round, yellow bird. It chirps and eats the seed from the man’s hand. A squirrel dashes out from the brush and grabs the seed the bird drops on the ground.
After the shirts are folded Dean finishes undressing, folding his jeans and placing them on the dresser as directed. He hesitates only a moment before he slips his underwear down as well. He curses himself for not having the foresight to wear a pair of his new panties.
Dean and Garth have bonded throughout the night over their shared love of Batman comics. Garth likes the newest Batgirl comics, but Dean insists Legends of The Dark Knight is the best.
Dean can’t wait for him to get home from work, walking in to the smell of tomato and basil, being able to just sit down and relax with warm pasta and maybe a glass of wine if Dean can find any in the many, many cabinets and cupboards in Castiel’s kitchen.
And then everything streams back into Castiel. He sits up in a rush and immediately doubles over, groaning and willing himself not to throw up on the lady’s shoes.
“Can we start over?” Dean asks, a shy smile playing on his lips as he steps out of Castiel’s embrace.
Dean closes his eyes as the soap swirls down the drain. He doesn’t want to look at the ugly marks on him. But in the blackness he sees himself tied to a bed frame, choking on pleas for forgiveness while Alastair stands over him, watching his friends taking turns fucking him.
Castiel helps Dean up off the kitchen floor and holds him steady as he gently removes the grains of rice still embedded in the skin of Dean’s knees. Dean is shaking as he watches Castiel. He lifts his hands to see that they’re shaking as well, though he doesn’t understand why.
“Cas,” Dean’s head hits the back of the couch hard, “It’s not—that’s not it.” He rolls his head to the side so he can watch Castiel out of the corner of his eye, “If Alastair finds out, if he saw us, he’d hurt you. I don’t know how far he’d go; I wouldn’t put murder past him. But I can’t be the one responsible for getting you hurt.”
“Cas?” Dean calls, but the apartment remains silent. He must still be at work, but it’s late and Dean’s tired, so he shuffles to bed, leaving dinner on the table, cold and forgotten.
It feels like Castiel leaves him waiting forever. Dean is tempted to look over his shoulder at the clock on the nightstand to see how long he’s been waiting, but he doesn’t want to risk Castiel catching him out of position. Maybe it’s part of the punishment, keeping him in time out like a toddler to think about what he’s done.
The fog from the mirror fades fast and Dean pauses when he sees himself no doubt creating new bruises or at least making the ones he already has bigger. He scowls at his reflection and flees to his bedroom where he covers his body in layers of clothing until the only skin showing is his head and the tips of his fingers poking out of the long sleeves of one of Castiel’s thick turtlenecks.
“Okay. Well, let’s see.” Dean picks at one of the deep fried pickles, withdrawing quickly when it burns his fingertip. He rests his burned finger on the cool glass of his half-empty beer. “Grew up moving a lot, never staying in one place for more than a year. Dad was completely checked out most of the time, so it was just my little brother Sam and me. I pretty much raised him on my own after Mom died.
The sneer falls from Alastair’s face, his grip on Dean’s jaw turning bruising. He smears the spit on Dean’s cheek and backs away. “Seems like the lesson still needs to be drilled in.”
“Hael, yes. We weren’t in a romantic relationship, but she was my submissive for a time. I wasn’t in love with her like I was with Alfie, but I did care for her. As it turns out, she didn’t feel the same about me. The only thing she was after was furthering her own place in the world. She wanted a position within the company I work for and thought I could grant her that. When she realized I couldn’t, she left. But not before breaking into my apartment and stealing anything she could get her hands on.”
When Dean is aware of his surroundings again he’s on his back with Castiel curled up against his side, his eyes closed with a dopey smile plastered on his face.
Castiel mumbles something that Dean can't quite make out as Castiel yawns between his words. Dean hasn't slept much the past couple of days, so he's more than okay with just resting on the couch with Castiel for the rest of the afternoon. He gets comfortable again, lying with his back against Castiel’s chest, both of them wrapped in the knitted throw blanket even though the apartment is too warm for it.
“I was actually thinking he was more like Hael, but yeah, this is probably a lot more like the whole Alfie situation, you’re right.”
A drop of precome spurts out from the head of his cock and down Dean’s length. He cries out in frustration as he feels his orgasm fade and slip out of reach.
Two of Alastair’s henchmen are arranging Dean into position in the center of the stage where wooden stocks have been secured to the floor. One holds Dean still while the other opens the stocks and then he’s being bent over at the waist until his neck and wrists are resting in the open semi-circles. The top half of the wooden contraption is quickly closed over him and latched into place.
The words are like a knife in Dean’s side, slicing up his ribs and making his breath wheeze out in a pained gasp. “I know,” he manages, clutching his drink so tightly he thinks the glass might shatter in his hand. Had he read the signs wrong? Did Castiel really not want to be with him?
He rambles off the rest of the symptoms: “Sleep disturbances. Psychological adjustment problems and depression. Disorders of taste and smell,” all of which Castiel says no to.
“It helps calm me down.” Dean grasps his glass tightly when the bartender slides the drink towards him. He stares into the dark liquid and twirls it around so it splashes against the side of the glass, but doesn’t make a move to take a drink.
Dean’s fingers find their way to Castiel’s hair, smoothing over his scalp, and he relaxes into the touch until he realizes what Dean is doing.
Charlie looks over at the counter to where Tessa is dealing with the rush of people coming through the door. “I should probably get back to work, too. I don’t think this company I’m temping for would approve of me taking a two hour lunch when it’s only my second week there.”
“Be careful. I may not look like much, but if you run into trouble I can throw a pretty mean punch, so just holler.”
Sabriel anyone? Seriously though, I’m not sure if I want to get those two together or not, but something could be starting? Maybe? Just a bit…
“I know our relationship started in a…unconventional way, and certain circumstances made us move in together, but I need you to know that I want you here. And that’s not going to change even when you can support yourself financially.”
“Oh, is that all?” Dean tries to joke but that list is intimidating and sends the previous anxiety flowing back into him and clouding his excitement.
Often times Dean spends countless days holed up in his apartment and the most interaction with another human being he gets is when he goes grocery shopping, or when he grabs a coffee from the diner across the street from his place. Sometimes he finds his voice has gone hoarse from extended disuse. Now, though, he can’t seem to stop talking.
with him. He’s content with that conclusion and goes back to rolling dough in his hands, his cookies dwarfed next to Castiel’s giants.
Too soon Alastair is adding another finger and Dean hisses in pain, trying to step away only for the hand on his shoulder to tighten. He likes the rough burn and stretch usually, but Alastair always takes it a step further. The fingers turn more aggressive and Dean bites his tongue to keep from crying out.
Castiel’s arms tighten around Dean almost painfully and then he lets go, pulls back until he can look Dean in the eye. “I wish you would believe me when I tell you this: you are not perfect, no, but no one is. Your worth is not defined by how others see you, or what traumas you’ve endured. Your worth is defined by how you engage the world, your actions. Even if you can’t see it right now, you are good, pure-hearted and worthy of so much. I’m going to make it my mission to make you see just how much.”
Dean spends the rest of the day in bed, wrapped in layers of borrowed clothes under borrowed blankets trying to banish Alastair from his mind. But by the time the sun is setting Dean feels worse than he did before.
The bell above the door jingles and Dean looks up to see a short man step up to the counter. He looks familiar, but Dean can’t quite place him.
Dean makes a show of giving the man a once over, taking in his suit and perfectly polished shoes that somehow look perfect next to his ratty, tan trench coat. He looks back up and takes in the dark hair, mussed and shiny with perspiration, and the pinpricks of stubble lining his strong jaw.
“It’s all right. You’re safe. Just relax.” The chorus of assurances keep coming, and Dean recognizes the deep, soothing voice as Castiel’s.
He buzzes the delivery guy in then slips into the hallway to wait so there’s no chance of a stranger seeing Castiel slumped on the couch with his dick out. But when Dean goes back in with the bag of food Castiel is already composed.
“My apologies. I might have been a little too enthusiastic.” Castiel presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s chest. “I’ve never been with someone with nipples as sensitive as yours. The noises you make when I lick them…”
He nods once and sighs, “Yeah, sorry.” Drinking and talking with Castiel was supposed to keep him distracted, keep his mind from overthinking, not send him spiralling into an anxious mess.
Dean thinks, eyeing Castiel over the top of his menu. The thought sends little butterflies fluttering about in his stomach. He’s enjoyed the soft touches from the man up until this point, has enjoyed every second they’ve been together, but he hadn’t considered the possibility of a relationship.
It’s doubtful he’s going to be able to sleep, but he’s got nothing better to do, so he carefully lies on his stomach on top of the covers. He grabs his phone from the side table and scrolls through different apps, checks his e-mail, opens all the apps again, then opens Netflix. He flips through the shows he has on his list, unable to settle on what to watch, and ends up falling asleep without picking anything, phone still in his hands.
Driving would be safe. It was unlikely he’d be ambushed in his car. He could take the Impala and drive out of the city, cruise around for an hour or so just to get out of the apartment and clear his head.
Dean fights against the post-orgasm haze that threatens to overtake him, so welcoming with the promise of numb oblivion, but there’s no telling what could happen to him if he’s too out of it; some people like to take Dean’s immobile state as invitation to use him on the days Alastair leaves and no one bothers to cut him free. So he doesn’t allow himself to drift, instead trying to quickly claw his way back to full awareness, but his body betrays him as he goes limp, no longer able to stay upright.
When Dean stares into his mug instead of answering Castiel places a hand on his knee. “Think on it. Pick something we wouldn’t otherwise say during a scene. Something you won’t forget.”
“Okay, I can do that.” Dean focuses on Castiel’s voice as he starts talking about his day at work. “I was supposed to have a meeting this morning, but it got pushed back so I had to miss my lunch break so I’m just trying to slip away now to find something to eat, and…”
“I liked the things Alastair did to me,” Dean confesses. “I mean, not all the time, and definitely not most of the stuff closer to the end, but between scenes all I could think about was the next time I’d get to see him, the next time he would call on me.” Dean pauses, wincing at his own words.
The webpage has an extensive list of kinks ranging from all assortments of gags to impact play to any kind of restraints you could think of, and then some.
Reading the look on Dean’s face, Doctor Pavlovská adds, “Or not. Dean, I’m not here to tell you what to do, y’know. I don’t know everything.”
Dean only looks up and locks eyes with Castiel, doesn’t need to look down to see the evidence of how affected Castiel is right now, can feel it pressing against him insistently. Castiel’s eyes are blown wide, and a fine sheen of sweat dots his forehead.
Dean unlocks the Impala, eyes never straying from Castiel’s as he sinks into the driver’s seat. He waits until Castiel turns and heads for his own car before starting the engine and driving home, singing along to his Zeppelin cassette the entire ride.
These three or four minutes on stage every Thursday is where Dean feels most alive. The rest of his days pass by in a blur of the same routine, but here, now, there’s nothing but him. This is the one thing in his life that he still has all to himself.
Dean’s body is on fire, and he’s gasping for breath. He can feel his abused cock, half hard, hanging between his spread legs. He doesn’t want to look out at the crowd, doesn’t want to see the faces of the people judging him.
His plan for the day had been to go out and explore this part of the city. The shops around the apartment are all more upscale and way too expensive for Dean, but window shopping was still better than being cooped up all day.
CAS: You can help it and you will stop now before you earn yourself even more punishment when I get home.
It’s still early and Dean isn’t very enthusiastic about spending another day alone in the apartment, so he rolls over, hoping to fall back asleep. But there’s a banging noise from somewhere in the apartment, probably what woke him in the first place, and Dean slips out of bed to investigate.
Dean pulls Castiel into a kiss just as his orgasm finally takes over him and he screams his release into Castiel’s mouth. Everything around him falls to the back of his mind as wave after wave of unending pleasure wraps its way around his body, drowning him under the onslaught for so long he’s not sure if he had multiple orgasms or if it was one drawn out one.
He knew it was going to be hard to find a job considering he’s been unemployed for so long, but he’s starting to get discouraged. He’s applied to dozens of places, but he’s pretty sure most of his
Castiel takes his hand away, and Dean holds his breath waiting for the first blow to fall. When it does he’s jolted forward with the intensity as Castiel’s bare hand cracks against his skin loudly.
Castiel takes a long drink of his tea before continuing. “I want to go over the non-verbal safewords now while we’re both in a good headspace. During a scene, if you can’t speak, tap me three times.” Castiel taps Dean firmly on the thigh three times to demonstrate. “If you’re unable to do that for whatever reason shake your head three times, sharply.” He demonstrates that too then asks Dean to repeat the actions to show his understanding.
Alastair was nice in the beginning, too. He knew how to put on a good face and lure someone in with promises and sweet words. And then he changed, slowly dropped the façade of the caring lover. It had been Dean’s own fault for ignoring the red flags early on, and it had landed him four years of abuse.
DEAN: I’m not very hungry, so I’m just making butternut squash soup. Might have a piece of toast with it.
The day after Castiel had texted and told Dean he’d bought a copy and was only a few chapters in but already could tell it was going to be a good one.
Castiel nodded his head sadly. “Benjamin wouldn’t call for us without good cause. He was a good fighter, but he cared deeply for his vessel. They were friends. He wouldn’t put her in unnecessary danger.”
“I know that Cas, but it’s not the point,” he said, shaking his head dismissively. Yes, over the course of the day he’d been sugar dipped in more worry than he cared to remember, but the root of Dean’s anger ran far deeper. Cas couldn’t play fast and loose with his life anymore. Neither of them could, because it wasn’t just about them anymore. There was another life that they were responsible for.
“So,” Dean said, challengingly, “if you had them back, right here, right now, where would you take me?” He josselled his Angel’s shoulder playfully.
Sam gave his brother a quick once over. For the most part Dean was usually alert shortly after waking. Probably one of the side effects of growing up in a protective role, feeling like he always had to sleep with one eye open. He had always been the last to fall asleep, the first to rise and always took the bed closest to the door. Even now, in the safety of the bunker, Dean’s bedroom was the closest to the entrance. He claimed it was because it was closer to the kitchen, but Sam knew otherwise. It was rather annoying really. Occasionally Dean would let himself sleep in, but it wasn’t the norm. Dean being this sluggish usually meant he was getting run down, or sick. “You okay?”
Satisfied, and not wanting to stress his brother, or deny a pregnant person a meal any longer than was absolutely necessary, Sam nodded in agreement.
Now Dean can really take his time. Slowing the kiss till Cas is groaning, while he plucks the buttons open one by one, letting the backs of his fingers play over Cas' firm chest and stomach, drinking in the feel of every new part of Cas' torso that's revealed on Dean's southern journey.
“You were Heaven’s puppet,” Dean continued, his grip getting a little tighter. “They were pulling your strings. Asking you to jump and you didn’t even have the option of asking ‘how high’... But, Cas-” Dean pulled back so he could see his angel’s face, so he could know his words were getting through to him. He’d said it all before, but he needed to know this message was driven home. “You’re not that guy anymore. You know your own mind now. You got a conscience. You feel... You found your free will, Baby.”
Sam watched the decision play across Castiel’s features. The Angel rocking back and forth in desperate confusion, drawn between his need to go after the enraged hunter and doing as the younger brother suggests. It's obvious Castiel wants to stay close, the Angel looks physically pained by the sight of Dean walking away while so distressed.
The Brits had been told to stick it where the sun didn't shine. Most hunters preferred to work alone. Those rare ones that did play nice with others, certainly weren't going to ask ‘How high?’ when told to jump.
The sun set and rose and set again. Days and nights passed. Still Castiel had lingered at the spot where Dean’s body had last been on Earth. He’d watched the fire turn him to ash and bit by bit, floated away on the wind, leaving the Angel alone and numb with loss. A shell of what they once were.
“Please stop calling my Father's name,” Castiel murmured, nudging Dean’s knees apart further as he crawled up over the hunter. “It’s very disconcerting.”
Everything had gone better than he had hoped. Apart from one small thing. He had pictured the date ending with them ravishing each other like a pair of horny teenagers, but it would appear luck as usual was not on his side. Seemed more than likely that the only one Dean was going to be embracing in the foreseeable future was the porcelain throne.
“-Don’t want sympathy, Cas.” Dean wiped his hand down his face, unsurprised when it came away damp. “The only reason I’m telling you this is ‘cause afterwards I did everything I could to hide that side of me. I knew it wasn’t wrong, but...”
As Sarah Connor’s departing words faded, and the closing theme began, the house lights came up and everyone around the couple started collecting their things and quickly leaving to avoid the rush.
“Everything should be in there.” He waved his hand dismissively in the general direction of where Cas’ trench had been tossed the night before.
Dean’s busy search stopped abruptly. Slowly turning to face him, an annoyed questioning glare upon his face. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
At least Dean was starting to see some form of rationality. Of the very few times Dean and Castiel had actually come to blows in the past, it had only been when Dean was under the influence and strengthened by the mark of Cain that Dean had come out on top, though that may also have something to do with Castiel’s reluctance to hurt Dean that had lead the angel into not fighting back. So even if Dean did carry out what he was threatening - which Sam wholeheartedly doubted - it would be unlikely that Castiel would come to any actual harm.
They had been searching the bomb site for hours now. The day had edged passed and the sun had started to set. Most of the fire had gone out, but a few still smoldered amongst the wreckage, providing only dim light for the ongoing fruitless search for the missing angel.
Jody had been the last to go, having to get back to the girls, but not before she had firmly demanded that Sam promise to take care of his brother because, in her words, Dean looked like shit. Sam couldn’t disagree.
Due to his morning sickness, Dean hadn’t been in the best shape before he’d been kidnapped, and by the look of him the last two weeks hadn’t made him any better. He had definitely dropped a few pounds in weight and the bags under his eyes were threatening to become suitcases. But it was the  mental strain that Sam was most concerned with.
It wasn’t the closed in and watched feeling he got in the cell, he had always managed to get the rest he needed while remaining on high alert before.
“We’re wasting time.” Cas kept up his one-sided conversation, his tone growing more desperate, as Dean scanned the shelves. “We need to get you back to the bunker as soon as possible. You’re warded, but I have no idea how much of that applies to the Nephilim.”
His evenings were spent with Cas snuggled in their nest, the laptop propped open between them while Dean went through his favorites to broaden his angel’s pop culture knowledge. He did not want another Officer and a Gentleman incident. He now had ‘Back to the Future’ and it’s sequels under his belt. As Dean had correctly assumed on their date, Cas had made a connection to what had happened years back, but at least now he understood that reference. And happily for Dean, many others.
It wasn’t even that the amount of times he had been drugged into unconsciousness since his kidnapping meant that getting some natural sleep wasn’t necessary. The pregnancy induced fatigue had meant that he was pretty much in a permanent state of exhaustion, despite the amount of sedatives forced into his system.
“I can’t see that, Dean,” Cas stated, with a small almost apologetic shake of his head, as if not being able to confirm Dean’s belief for certain caused the angel stress. “I don’t know if it’s too early or if I even will be able to tell, but right now I have no more insight than you do.”
“I get it,” Dean stated with a nod. Who was he to judge what length the angel would go to in a desperate moment. Or how hard it was to keep your head when your whole world had fallen in and collapsed in on itself. But he couldn’t let them fall victim to the same mistakes that had happened before them. They had to learn from the past. His mother had sold out. A noble and desperate act to save his dad, but it had led to the downfall of their whole family. He would not allow their baby to pray victim to similar circumstances, not while he still drew breath...and maybe not even after then. “We have to do better than our parents, Cas,” Dean told him forlornly. “....We just have to.”
I would love to hear people's thought and opinions so far, it really helps to know how it's being viewed by the reader xXx
“Dean, look at me.” His chin was urged up until wary green meets with sincere blue. “I went into my own mind because what I felt was intense and confusing... Not because it wasn’t real. I meant everything I said. Coerce or not, it was the truth.”
“You were perfect, Dean.” Castiel replied sincerely. “You feel so deeply. It made trying to decipher everything so much clearer. There would have been no one better to guide me.”
“We need to get you back!” Cas said panickedly. He was warily glancing all over, as if searching for some unseen threat, as he hooked his hand under Dean’s armpit, practically forcing the hunter up to his feet and into the car.
“Can we do this back at the bunker?” Cas practically whined as he followed less than half a step behind as Dean made his way over to the small bathroom.
Castiel chuckled. “As did I, Dean. At least in the beginning.” Since his revelation in the movie theatre Dean had been adamant on proving that the Angel and Terminator were nothing alike. So much so that he was misunderstanding that Castiel was actually finding the notion of sharing similarities with the fictional cyborg somewhat comforting.
He needed to vent out his fear and clear his head. It had been a day filled with a roller-coaster of emotion; fear, relief, dread, horror, panic, hopelessness, grief, guilt, relief again. The unexpected twists and ups and down were sure to make his head spin. And like usual, when Dean emotions were too raw for him to handle, he favored towards anger.
Cas stared back almost blankly, before his eyes drop to Dean’s abdomen. But whether Cas was simply avoiding the human’s gaze or looking to the Nephilim within, Dean couldn’t be sure. His Angel’s expression is giving away nothing, he’s only showing the worry and fear, maybe a hint of guilt, but whether or not he feels for what’s growing inside Dean, that the hunter can’t see.
He couldn’t dwell on that right now. He would deal with the consequences once Cas was safe. Determined, he brought the cup to his mouth and took a deep chug, finishing the bitter brew quickly and settled down on his back next to Cas. Within moments and with a silent apology and plea for forgiveness, Dean's eyes slipped closed, head lolling to the side.
Dean remained silent, his jaw tensing, not wanting to admit that Cas had a point. And it’s a point Dean hadn’t considered. He’d been so caught up in the possible ramifications that he hadn’t stopped to realize that neither of them were responsible.
It only took a few moments for Dean to crack. “Alright, Cas, either you’re trying to mind meld with me, or something’s buggin’ ya. So, what’s up?”
Dean swallowed and when he spoke again his voice had somehow found the strength he needed it to have. “That’s not an option!”
On his left bicep, right up by his shoulder, was a handprint. He twisted to get a better view. The mark was the exact same size, shape and placement as the one Cas had left on him from dragging his ass outta Hell. But that one had faded away to nothing years ago, not even leaving a scar and at no point did he remember it looking like this. Before it had been harsh and raised, like he had been branded by his saving Angel's hand. This one wasn’t. It wasn’t raised, it didn’t look burnt. It was smooth with a faint silvery shimmer to it. A ghost of what was. And unlike the other, when he gently ran his thumb over it, the marking didn’t hurt.
Castiel nodded quickly, forcing himself to hold Dean’s gaze and not to look away ashamedly. He had hoped that his part in the Seraph's and his child’s death would never need to be fully divulged. Preferring it to stay in a past with a self that he barely recognized anymore. But it would seem fate was not going to be on his side.
“That’s ours,” Dean confirmed, jumping up to quickly take their food from the waitress with the perfect timing.
Cas was transfixed and no sooner did Dean swallow before his mouth was occupied by something else just as tasty.
Castiel’s head raised slowly to find the bartender who had spoken. She had kind eyes and wore a feign smile, as she wiped her hands on a rag dirtier than her skin was, making Castiel wonder what was the purpose of doing so. “Excuse me?”
"No, it wasn't. And don't apologize." His voice was confident, husky as he closed the small distance between them.
“Of course I did,” she tutted. “I wouldn’t come traipsing halfway across the country for nothing now would I? Don’t suppose you’re going to tell me what you need it for.”
“Brother?” One of the other two in the room with him scoffed, Dean identifying them both as Angel’s by Cas’ wording as well as the blades they both held, blades coated in Cas’ blood. “What are you?”
“So?” Sam tried to keep his tone casual, side glancing briefly to try and gauge his brother's mood. “You and Cas, huh?”
There was a long second of disbelieved silence, where Cas’ words hung heavy as lead in the air between them, before Dean laughed loudly, a dry cackle, a tad too forced, until the sickness threatening to make a reappearance forced him to stop.
“You sure about that?” Dean asked, “‘cause you just spent hours inside your own head trying to figure out how you feel. So how can you be sure?”
“Well, my soul may be, but I am not!” Dean retorted hotly, his patience with Cas fast waning. “I’m a dude and dudes can’t get pregnant!”
Dropping his voice to barely a whisper, Dean turned the tables back onto the Angel. “What are we to you?” It wasn’t the total subject shift that he wanted, but it was the best his panicked mind could conjure at the time.
“Do I need to do something?” Dean offered, a smirk crawling playfully onto his lips. “Tell her to back off my man and defend your honor?”
Dean remembers Jessie, the little boy born half Demon. Heaven had wanted the kid dead and Cas had barely hesitated. Probably would have succeeded too if the boy hadn’t gotten the upper hand on the Angel first.
Dean didn’t reply. Because, yes, that was precisely what he thought. But admitting that would open up the floor and put what had happened between him and Cas just hours before under the spotlight. He didn’t have time for that, not now. So he ignored Sam’s puppy dog eyes, instead turning his attention into doubling his efforts in the search, thankfully finding what they were looking for just seconds after.
“Don’t!” Dean’s softly demanding voice interrupted his turbulent thoughts and Castiel’s head shot up, surprise widening his regret filled eyes.
Dean takes Cas’ little grin as this time he is ‘inclined to agree’ and pulls the Angel into a fierce kiss. He’s sure no matter how many times this happens, he’ll never get used to kissing Castiel. There’s just something about the effect it has on the hunter. The way his heart wants to swoon and his body melt, the way his stomach jumps as if shocked and the tingle that runs through his skin. Despite the Angel’s lack of experience his lips seem to move and mold to the hunters as if they were made to fit his own, so perfectly.
Cas let out a primal moan as Dean’s words go through him, sounding more like a growl in its deep baseness so close to the hunters ear. He wants to, Dean can see that he does, he's holding on as if for dear life.
“I would do anything to keep you safe,” Castiel finally speaks up sadly, under the hunter's intense watch and Dean doesn’t doubt for a second the sincerity of what the Angel is saying, but he can also see the conflict brewing beneath the surface. He knew that despite Dean’s misgivings, Cas was capable of anything if he believed it was the right thing to do.
Shit. Dean rubbed his hand harshly across the back of his neck. It would be the simplest thing in the world to reach across and take Cas’ hand in his, just like the couple opposite. So easy and yet impossibly hard.
Cas had been coming to Earth, helping the Winchesters, fighting alongside them for years and yet he had rarely sampled the finer things life had to offer.
It was true. The young Nephilim did look uncannily like Castiel and was only getting more so as she grew. Sam was convinced that once she reached adulthood you could put her in a trench-coat and a backwards tie and pass them off as twins. But when it came to her expressions, and mannerisms, that side of the Nephilim she had inherited, one hundred percent, from Dean. The more the child's personality developed, the more apparent it was becoming. Yet because Castiel had kept himself away he hadn’t seen it.
being unreasonable?! You’re the one who’s deluded enough to think that those douchebags will ever do anything to help!”
Cas didn’t need to be told twice. He was out of the nest and had the mentioned notes in hand quicker than Dean would have thought possible - Humanly possible, anyway - before the angel stroad speedily from the room, presumably to find Sam.
“...No...” Dean interrupted, sounding stunned and weak in his objection. His voice has no strength, no conviction. And after the deep gravelly explanation from Cas it sounded nothing more than childlike.
Without realizing, Dean’s smile mirrored theirs as he took in the little window into their lives. Something about their body language told Dean that this was a familiar scene between them. Despite the husband's frustration and the wife's inability to help him understand, the couple were comfortable, putting each other completely at ease with a simple gesture of affection.
Castiel sighed, taking a long moment to drop his head and let Dean’s anger abate somewhat, before turning his soulful blue eyes up, meeting Dean’s in painful honesty. “You didn’t say ‘yes’ to it,” he clarified, “but even if you had, I would still have to consciously force my grace into merging with your soul, Dean.”
He punches again and again. His hand going from chapped, to cut and bloody. The plaster cracked and splintered with the impacts, until his fist passed through it leaving a gaping hole to the room adjacent. Pulling his hand free, it came away caked in plaster dust.
Trying to mentally will himself to pee proved to be the hardest part about taking the test. Not only did he not need to go, but holding the test in one hand and his dick (literal proof that he was a man!) in his other just looked fucking absurd and made his bladder go shy. Or maybe it just didn’t want to be part of this insanity.
“That's what’s fucking with your mojo?” Dean asked, peering over the Angel’s shoulder, sounding like he had already suspected that would be the case.
Dean’s head jolted up from where it had been resting laxly on his fist, propped up on his elbow on the tabletop. He’d only closed his eyes for a second... Or two... He hadn’t nodded off while Sam was talking to him. He hadn’t.
Lady Toni Bevell, from the British Men of Letters, she had claimed. She was quickly on the draw, so clearly comfortable and trained in handling firearms, but she hadn’t shot to kill. Choosing to lodge the bullet in his leg rather than a fatal shot to any major organs or head. That gave weight to her claim that the British Men of Letters were not here to kill him, but to take him in for questioning. They clearly needed him for some reason, although what that reason was exactly remained a mystery. If they wanted help they were going the wrong way about it.
“Oh,” Dean sighed out, his head dropping, not knowing what else to say. That certainly didn’t sound promising for Cas’ friend and Dean knew he was not the best person to be counseling Cas through his grief. He may have been through more than his fair share of grief himself, but he never knew what to say to others that could help them in any way. He was more of a ‘push it away’, or ‘get angry over the injustice of it’, rather than ‘talk out your feelings’, type. And the hormones raging his system would only make it harder, but his angel was inexperienced with emotions, so simply giving him a pat on the shoulder and offering condolences were not going to be acceptable.
Over the years those feelings had only developed deeper. Growing from a mere, yet strong and unexpected, attraction, to a friendship and onto something more profound. Yet Dean pushed them down, hiding it from everyone, including himself - Mostly. He tried to think of Cas as his brother, a brother in arms, but also family. But every now and then when he thought no one was looking, or when he found himself trapped in that soul piercing stare, or while being embraced like he was right now, like he was the most precious thing in the world, only then did he allow himself to indulge in the fantasy.
There's so much that he wants to say, but the Angel's name seemed to be all that was left in his vocabulary.
Dean nodded along disappointedly. It was never that easy. It wasn’t as if he expected all the answers they were searching for to be right there on the first page, but after what he’d been through to get the notes he reserved the rights to be annoyed when they weren’t.
The low rumble of Dean’s beloved Impala was both music to his ears and a stab to his fractured heart. He knew Dean was no longer the one driving her, but for the briefest of moments, Castiel let himself imagine. The reality only made the loss more vivid.
With nothing else left to smash he punches the wall, pain shooting up his arm from his knuckles that come away chapped. It hurts, but it’s a different pain from the one clouding his thoughts at the moment. So he focuses on that, letting it take his mind away from the turmoil his thoughts are swirling in.
That was the first time Dean had found himself caught in the most penetrating stare from the bluest eyes, that even the darkness of the barn hadn't dulled. He would get used to being looked at with such intensity over the years, but in that first time he remembered his stomach flip flopping in nervous excitement, his heart pounding 'til it was all he could hear, in a way that had nothing to do with fear, and thinking Castiel was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid eyes on.
Slamming the door shut behind him, Dean hunched over, gripping his knees and trying to drive the image from his own mind. He was sure that if he was actually here, actually in his body and not a mental projection, he would have thrown up.
Since then Hunters from all over the country had reported being approached by members of  the British Men of Letters. None of them had received the Winchester's style of greeting. Instead,  they had been offered access to all the advanced weapons and research material the British had to offer, in exchange for the Hunters doing what they were told when they were told to do it.
He didn’t have the luxury of ignoring his basic needs. His baby needed him to take care of himself. But he didn’t want to leave. Because leaving meant giving up and accepting, without reason or explanation, that Cas was gone.
“Oh you didn’t think it was necessary.” Dean mocked, his voice, heavy in sarcasm and disdain, turning to thick anger. “Well, you thought wrong didn’t you?!”
At the sound of Sam's voice Dean jerks back, breaking the kiss and shoving Cas away, roughly. Wiping his swollen mouth with his sleeve, his wide guilty eyes track his brother as he enters the room. With his head down, nose in a book, Sam seemed unaware of the scene he had just stumbled in on, while Dean tried to get hold of his breathing and hoped the heat rising over his head wasn't a telltale blush.
Cas rolled his eyes, “You forgot your key,” he chastised as he climbed the steps to let the hunter back in.
No sooner was the lip freed that a long drawn out moan escaped the hunter, and reassured, Castiel gave a few more pushes in and out of Dean's opening hole, before gingerly adding his index finger also. Curling his fingers, aiming for the little bundle of nerves he knew was within.
“Don’t you dare blame this on hormones!” Dean’s face was reddened with anger as he glared hotly at the angel. “Don’t. You. Dare!”
talk now? Here? Seriously? He glanced around the crowded diner, expecting to see all eyes on them. Not that they were. Everybody was too busy with their own food, or jobs to pay the two men any attention, but still this was too public for Dean’s liking. He had kept this side of him so hidden over the years, that it was second nature to him by now. There was no way he was ready to start an in depth discussion about their relationship in the middle of a crowded diner full of strangers.
“He went to retrieve Dean’s body,” Sam said, quickly giving weight to his previous lie. He made his face fall and voice catch as he spoke. Even with her keeping her distance she would clearly be able to see the mournful expression he managed. “He’s a hero. He saved the world...again. He deserves a decent burial.”
Dean had been forced to grow up way too quick. With Mom dead and their Dad too hellbent on revenge to be any sort of real parent to the boys, it was Dean that had taken up the mantle, sacrificing his own childhood for his baby brother. Sam hadn’t understood or appreciated it at the time, but as a man he can look back and see everything his brother had done for him when he was little more than a kid himself. No one had been there for Dean. No one had put Dean first... that was, until Castiel.
Looping his hand under Sam’s arm, Dean helped ease his brother to his feet. Sam hopped a few times, getting his balance on his good leg, before testing his weight on his wounded one. Dean had done a good job. The removal had been speedy without being rushed and the stitches were tight without pulling too badly on the tender flesh. With his weight settled, Sam met his brothers curiously worried eyes. “It’s good. I’m good,” he said, giving Dean an appreciative and approving slap on his shoulder.
Sam ran his fingers through his unwashed hair in frustration, before striding wearily back the short distance to the Impala. The cries got louder, drowning out the squeak of the car door as it opened, but he hesitated before getting in, looking over to Castiel hopefully.
Dean’s nod had a tremble. “He- He’s like catatonic in there.” Both Dean’s hands were fisting his hair, like he was trying to rip it out by the root and Sam pretended not to notice the wetness collecting in his brothers eyes or the way he was biting at his lower lips to try and hide the quiver.
"What are ya waitin' for Cas?" Dean breathes against his shoulder, interrupting Cas' inner debate, "A written invitation?"
He swung his legs over the edge of the metal cot with the lumpy thin mattress and padded to the facilities to empty his protesting bladder. A pointedly placed sample cup stared up at him from on top of the system. Reluctantly he snatched it up, popped off the lid and filled it as he relieved himself. He hated that he was complying, but after he refused to give the first sample it had been taken via a catheter. Since then he had taken the opportunity to give it himself whenever it presented itself. He’d had that probe up his butt often enough, the least he could do was prevent his dick from getting put through the same treatment.
Dean smiled as he left. He was happy for once and he wasn’t going to apologize for it, hide it, or worry about it.
“What do you need, Dean?” the angel asked, snapping Dean out of his head and he glanced up to find Cas looking at him with softly concerned eyes.
“But I never said-” Dean stopped himself, questioning. Had he? He’d said a lot of things in the throes of passion, ‘yes’ could definitely have been one of the things that had slipped from his lips. But he hadn’t meant it like that. There was a big difference between ‘Yes, Cas, just there, like that’ and ‘Yes, I want you to give me your half Angel love child’. He hadn’t said ‘yes’  to - to that. How specific did this ‘yes’ have to be? Surely that should have been something that was mentioned before. Something that was desperately important and yet this is the first time he’s hearing about it! What the hell was Cas thinking? The implication made his temper flare red hot.
As if that was the matter settled, Dean turned to his brother, his whole demeanor brightening. “So, how was the hunt?”
Cas was frowning at Dean like he was a complex puzzle the Angel was trying to solve and Dean’s heart suddenly skipped a beat as he realized his slip up. Castiel had been alone when he had retaken his grace and gotten his wings back. He’d never told anyone how torn up and frail they were. Dean only knew because he had seen them in his uninvited trip into Cas’ memories. Something he had sworn he would never talk about.
Cas shook his head quietly. “Nothing definite, but there was one thing I noticed that may be relevant... The mark on your arm.”
“One cup isn’t going to hurt,” Dean objected dismissively, tossing a large lump of pineapple into his mouth.
It was a good way to start the day... Even if it ended far too quickly, because no sooner had Castiel insured that Dean had slept as well as he assumed and had been unnecessarily reminded to have breakfast, that the angel was off for his day of uninterrupted study.
Castiel nodded in silent understanding, before parting himself from his mate. “Stand back,” he warned.
...Well, as normal as things could get for a supernatural hunter whose brother was knocked up by an Angel of the lord.
Rowena eyed him critically for a long second, skepticism etched deep in her features, before eventually deciding that he was being truthful and reaching into her bag, pulled out a small pouch.
Dean frowned curiously, watching his Angel stammer. It wasn’t like Cas to get flustered, over anything. He could count the number of times he’d seen Cas struggle to get out what he wanted to say on one hand. It peeks his curiosity, he has to know. What was he told? By whom? He shouldn’t be able to do what? The questions swarm through his mind, while Cas blushes, rubbing the back of his neck nervously, before dropping his head hiding the flush of his cheeks.
Cas gave a tiny half smile, his eyes gliding up to meet Dean’s, capturing him in a soft but holding stare.
“Hmm,” Sam murmured in agreement, taking a casual swig from his own mug. “That’s because it’s decaf.”
He raised a weary hand so he can run it through his Angel's soft sex messed hair. "Cas?" he rasped out through protesting vocal cords, "You okay?"
Castiel’s brow drew in, offended and hurt becoming very prominent as he tried to catch Dean’s busy eyes. “Not understanding something doesn’t make it nonexistent, Dean. From the beginning I was...” The Angel took a sighing breath, wetting his lips. “I’ve always been drawn to you.”
Castiel was so fascinated that he doubts he would have known Dean had spoken had he not been staring at the hunters mouth so intently.
Sam quickly tried to mask the horrified confusion Castiel’s words caused, grateful that the Angel had quickly looked away so he wouldn’t be able to see. He waited, sure that there must be more to that statement, a reason that didn’t sound as bad as he was thinking it was right now. “Cas, you can’t- ...She’s innocent. You can’t blame her for what happened.”
“What happened?” Sam was already leading the way, back towards Dean’s room, as he asked, Dean following briskly behind him.
“Two human males can’t, but for an Angel and a human...  it’s entirely possible.” Cas’ tone was edged with tension and guilt, he dropped his head fractionally, turning more away from Dean.
echoed throughout the bunker, grabbing the attention of them both. At first they glanced at each other in confusion, until a second
To start with, those among the hunters that hadn’t required medical attention had stayed behind to help search for their missing comrade. What was left of the compound had been surrounded with people calling out to the angel, until the fires died down enough for them to start searching more thoroughly... That had been hours ago.
“Look,”  Dean turned on his brother, jabbing his open palm into his chest, “whatever you think you know about me and Cas, you can just forget about it alright,” he snapped hotly, glaring at his brother.
Propped up on one arm, Castiel watched the hunter below with wrapped attention. Fascinated by the reaction he was getting from the teased circling of his finger, while he made sure to spread the lubricant well. The Angel's body was thrumbing with undiluted desire. His hips seemed to have developed a will all of its own, reacting to the stimuli. His genitalia had swollen to the point where it was becoming painful and seemed to be leaking and was driving him to find friction. His breathing shallow, but quick, his skin flushed and his heart was pounding. And Dean's body was reacting in just the same way, except the hunter was also coated in a very fine layer of adrenaline scented sweat.
Dean was hoping Sam hadn't noticed anything, but the way his little brother seemed to be trying, and not quite managing, to hold back a grin, didn't fill him with confidence.
"Subtle, Sammy!" Dean shouts after him, hearing a chuckle float back to his ears as Sam disappeared down the corridor.
Luckily she seemed to be buying Sam’s cover story that Dean was dead and Cas was out looking for his body. That at least would give them the element of surprise. He’d been worried that Sam’s story was too far fetched to be believable. Not that Cas wouldn’t have gone looking for him, of course he would have, but they all knew that if the soul bomb had been used then there wouldn’t have been a body to recover.
Dean’s brow raised in surprise. He honestly hadn’t been expecting that. Judging by the look Cas wore, he wouldn’t expect to find out they were still flying below Heaven’s radar either, but somehow they were still safe, for now, yet Cas’ troubled look remained. “Anyone I know?” he asked tentatively, hiding his relief behind sympathy for his angel.
“No,” Cas replied. “All Angels can sense the conception of a Nephilim. The serge of celestial power that happens when a Nephilim is conceived is felt by all, yet I sensed nothing at the time and nothing came across Angel radio. I suspect that the warding I placed on both your ribs has kept the Nephilim hidden. At least for now.”
“So you were following orders, before you knew any better?” Dean asked with a hopeful tone to his voice.
Castiel rounded on his mate, a telling look glinting in his eyes. “Can’t you?” he asked, a single eyebrow raising.
It took forever and a lot of visualizing waterfalls while running the tap, but eventually he managed a meager stream. It was only a small amount, but it was all he had, so he hoped it would be enough. He watches closely as it absorbs up to the little window, the strip darkening slightly until a little line appeared signalling that it was ready, there’s enough pee there to get a reading.
Castiel’s frown increased and Dean forced his eyes to stay locked on what he was doing so he didn’t have to face that probing look. “Guns aren’t a threat to me, Dean.”
Dean chuckled, draping an arm over Cas’ shoulder so the Angel could snuggle into his side. “I hope you know you’re gonna be getting a ton of homework.”
“You think I acted differently because we had sex?” Castiel’s tone was soft as a whisper, yet it cut like a hot knife through butter straight to the heart of what Dean was skimming around trying to avoid.
Glancing out of the impala windshield at the reunited couple, Sam sighed out in relief all the tension that he’d held in recently and smiled.
“Are you expecting company?” he asked, listening intently at something Dean’s human hearing was not strong enough to pick up.
With the purr of Baby’s engine a calming buzz in his ear, Dean reached out and took Cas’ hand in his own. “So to answer your question, I don’t know what label to give us. Boyfriends? Lovers? Whatever you want, Cas. And if you wanna call us mates, I’m cool with that too.”
Dean dipped into the first bag, pulling out and examining the contents one at a time before lining them up alongside a yellow spongy waterproof mat, with a hexagon pattern. That Sam had correctly assumed Cas would appreciate.
But the knowledge had come with a cost. The impersonal terminology used for ‘subject #169’ aka Dean was making Sam’s stomach turn and he for one couldn’t read anymore. The last straw had been finding out that the morning of the rescue they were planning to put Dean through a very risky procedure that should never have been attempted that early on in a pregnancy, just because if the Nephilim didn’t survive it there was no point in transporting Dean back to England. They were more concerned about the inconvenience of transporting them than Dean, or indeed the Nephilim’s life.
Cas looked at him like that was the last thing he had been expecting to hear come out of Dean's mouth and maybe it was. “You want to help?”
The topper on the large bottle of whiskey got yanked off and a generous three fingers poured into a matching tumbler. Without a second thought it was pressed to his lips. But as he tossed the glass back he caught himself. Realization hit him, full force and he coughed the drink back into the glass.
Dean shook his head. The whole evening had been ‘out of the ordinary’. Yes, he had always had those thoughts and desires towards Cas, but it was not like him to act on them and it was definitely not like Cas either. But there was nothing specific that stood out. It had been an epically intense first night together, but that was it. There wasn’t anything obvious that could be the cause of Cas’ current non-responsive state.
In the center of the overly lit, too clean clinical looking room that Dean found himself in, Cas was laid back, strapped down to a surgical type chair. His wrists restrained tightly to the arms by solid looking metal cuffs.
Castiel couldn’t reply. He was having to focus solely on what he was hearing. Making sure he didn’t miss a single word. When the voice abruptly silenced and he blinked opened his eyes, Dean was leaning into him, a deeply troubled and panicked look dominating his handsome features.
Dean’s brow lowered slowly. “The dude who’s mate survived the birth?... You were - you were part of that?”
Sam knew his brother needed someone to blame, someone to take his anger out on, but Sam firmly believed that this was nothing intentional on Castiel’s part. The Angel was just as freaked out about this as Dean was, he was just handling it differently. Cas was scared, scared for Dean. Dean was lashing out, but Sam understood why.
“Look, I’m Michael’s sword, right?” he began, spinning round to face them, finding both were giving him their wrapped attention, with matching worried and confused expressions. “His true vessel. If I’m supposedly strong enough to hold an archangel, then in comparison a little half angel kid should be a walk in the park, right?”
“Awesome,” Dean beamed right back, before dashed to where Baby was waiting and threw open the passenger door, holding it wide and gesturing for Cas to get inside. “Dinner and a movie? Dating Dean Winchester style.”
Although Dean had never admitted it, Sam had known Dean was bisexual for years now, and suspected it for even longer. Dean had just tried too hard, put on too much of a macho front for it not to be over compensating for something. And even if all that bravado hadn’t given away his brother's secret, his siren becoming a man certainly had. There was no denying that Dean was into women, but he definitely had part of himself locked and barricaded away in the proverbial closet, as far as Sam could see. So tightly locked away that Sam was sure that door would never be opened.
Picking a direction at random, there was no difference between the two, he had a fifty-fifty chance, he hurried down the corridor calling for the Angel at the top of his lungs. He hadn’t ran long when something caught his eye and he came to a skidded halt. The door to his right was slightly different to the others. It was the same spotlessly clean white of all the others, identical really in every way, but it was just
It felt right, that Cas would be his first time receiving, that Cas was going to be the first inside him.
It's a whispered prayer from the lips of an Angel and Dean gasps out without thought, quickly shaking his head, to clear it, before he drifts away again.
“Naomi,” he gasped out mournfully, stunned he didn’t think of it before. Of course his angel would doubt his own memories after everything that bitch had put him through - had done to him.
Eventually he started tuning out what he was seeing, only glancing in long enough to call to him and see if that Cas would respond in any way. He didn’t want to see more than that, but he couldn’t stop what he heard. The magnitude of voices, sometimes hearing Cas’ own, but mostly others. He heard his own voice more often than he liked. “You can’t stay.” “Nobody cares that you’re broken, Cas. Clean up your mess!” “You’re the famous spanner in the works. Honestly, I think you came off the line with a crack in your chassy.” “Top of the Christmas tree Castiel, no more than a doop.” “Next time I won't miss!” “You are expendable. Weak.” “I just followed the sound of your pain. You have no idea how loud it is.” “You don’t even die right, do you.” “I ask you to help me. Please. Save me from doing the worst.” “I’m sorry Dean.” “I don’t care!” “You are broken, Castiel.” “How many times have you tore into my head and washed it clean?” “Frankly, too damn many.”
“Last night... did you like how it ended?” Dean asked, rolling his hips to rub their groins together.
But for now Castiel was content to see the change in his hunter and beam in awe. His charge, so brave, so stubbornly strong headed, so human. And so admired by the Angel.
“Angels don’t have what you would consider romantic relationships,” Castiel replied, not showing any sign of the anxiety that was ripe in the hunter. “But the most accurate way to define us now would be 'mates'.”
“They took blood,” Dean informed him and did his best to ignore what sounded suspiciously like a growl rumbling loudly from Cas’ chest. “Hey, easy Tiger. It’s not as bad as it looks.”
Dean buried his head in Cas' neck as he felt the hard length gliding up the inside of his thigh and bluntly pushed against his clenching hole. This was it. After all these years of fantasies it was finally becoming a reality. And he needed to relax, because he knows it's gonna hurt. How could it not. It's his first time, and Cas is completely inexperienced. Tensing up is only going to make it worse.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle at the air quotes. The mask was well and truly off now that they were out of that room, and Dean’s dorky Angel was back in full swing.
Blackness engulfed the whole room, leaving Dean in nothing but empty space. He spun around on the spot searching for his Angel, or his torturer, or even the room that they had just been in, but it had all gone. He was staring into nothing but a void in all directions. Fearfully, he rushed back to the open door, before that too could have a chance to disappear.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Dean replied reassuringly. Though he had been feeling lethargic recently. A side effect from housing and then being stripped of thousands of souls no doubt. Storing that much raw power, even for a short time, had to take a toll, right? Not that he was going to share his thoughts. There was no need to worry his brother when there was nothing anyone could do. It’ll fade, he was sure of that. “Taking a bit longer to get going this morning is all.”
“What the hell was that back there, Cas?” Dean glared, intermittently jumping his eyes to Cas’ while he worked, earning himself a confused head-tilted squint in return. “You can’t go charging in like that. You could’ve gotten yourself killed.”
He gave a brief nod when Sam told him that Cas was breathing normally and had a strong steady pulse. He was already aware, he had checked before he left to find Sam. The Angel was fine physically, as far as his health signs were concerned, the problem was simple. Cas wouldn’t wake up. And for someone who doesn’t sleep, that couldn’t be good, not good at all.
He broke off, rescanning the room. The cream, the same as Baby’s dash and interior. The shiny black and leather, resembled her paint job... Even the round lights, edged in chrome, looked like the headlights of his beloved car. “Huh.”
“I’m powerless,” Cas said, returning Dean’s look with a helpless one of his own, that had Dean hurrying over to the pair of them.
“I have a son!” she gasped out desperately, trying unsuccessfully to flinch out of the Angel’s strong grasp as much as her binds would allow.
Dean chuckles and tossels the hair he's fingering through. It had been intense, probably more so for the Angel if Cas' inability to speak is anything to go by. So he gives Cas a few minutes to recover, running soothing hands over the Angel's surprisingly sweat-free back, before telling him to get out and off so he can go clean up the mess they'd made.
Castiel raised his hands in mock surrender, falling silent - Though it was clear from his tight lipped, flexed jaw and narrowed eyes, that he was far from conceding the argument.
“Whoa, back up a few pages.” Dean floundered on the bed, kicking off the sheets that tangled around his ankles. He scrambled up, blocking the angel’s path as Castiel was flapping the coat over his jacket onto his shoulders. “What’s goin’ on? What did I miss?”
The restaurant Dean had chosen for Castiel’s first ever date was bright and busy, bursting with life and color. The walls were adorned with memorabilia, staying just shy of looking cluttered. Instead giving it a warm and inviting feel. The wait staff hurried about wearing vibrant uniforms and friendly smiles to the sound of old rock buzzing in the background.
Dismissively, Dean turned away, but Sam was right, and he knew it. Thanks to the doctor’s overzealous sedatives and forced feeding, he had no idea when he had last eaten, or slept properly, yet it wasn’t ‘til his brother had mentioned it that he noticed just how hungry and tired he felt.
After a beat the cashier seemed to have snapped out of it and quickly rang up the sale, albeit a bit awkwardly. He must have either assumed that Dean was buying for a wife or girlfriend and had just brought a buddy with him for... moral support or whatever (Castiel’s extreme closeness was not helping the matter though. The Angel was practically glued to Dean’s back), either that or he thought he was being pranked. Judging by the way he was looking around, possibly searching for hidden cameras, Dean was assuming the latter was most likely.
“You got it,” the waitress said, collecting their menus. “I’ll be right back with your drinks.” With another smile for Cas, this one joined by a wink, she left.
A ball of guilt gripped at his stomach. He’d behaved like a dick to Cas all day because of his own misgivings, and at a time that Cas had already admitted was intensely confusing for him. Cas had told him he loved him, he hadn’t used those exact words, but the meaning was clear as glass and Dean had said nothing, just ran off like a little bitch at the first opportunity. After years of mixed signals and friend-zoning, the Angel deserved better.
Dean’s best reprimanding glance came out of the corner of his eye, not pausing his rapid search, shoving unwanted items around in the box to get at what could be hiding in the bottom. “It’s complicated," he said, everything in him screaming out ‘don’t go there’.
“I dunno man,” Dean shrugged, feeling vulnerable under Cas’ intense gaze that seemed to stare into him as if he could see through to Dean’s every inner most thoughts he’d ever had, past, present, and if he stared harder enough probably future too. He dropped his eyes to the ground. “But it seems too much to be a coincidence.”
But Dean was the only one there. Sam was still hunting down the satanic cult. However much Dean doubted his grief counselling skills, there was no other option for Cas available.
Hey guys, so so sorry about the how long it's taken me to get this chapter up. I knew it was going to be a tough one, but I wasn't expecting the series finale to put me into such a depressive mood that I didn't see the point in carrying on (no pun intended) with the story at all. The only reason this is even continuing at all is the kind words some of you have left and I also felt awful that I left it on a cliffhanger on the chapter before.
The hunters were scattered all over the country, some days of travel away, even if they could be freed up from their work instantly, which was unlikely. Most changed their contact numbers frequently to avoid brushes with the law, so it was a chase tracking them down in the first place, and those who Sam managed to contact had others that they might be able to enlist. Good for their numbers, but bad for the length of time it was taking to round up a group sizable enough to take on the British.
The minuscule nod of acceptance, Dean would have missed had he not been so focused entirely on Cas. “I will need to meet with them - The other angels that Benjamin called out to.”
There was only one intruder, as Cas had told him. Using his superior hearing the Angel had been able to fill Dean in on everything that was being said, while Dean had quickly thrown on the first shirt he had laid his hands on, not caring that it was inside out (Cas was dressed in a blink). The blonde woman was standing over Sam with her gun raised and trained on him. Too close for Dean to reach either of them before she could retaliate. They needed a distraction.
“Amara!” Dean all but shouted in realization, snapping Sam’s attention back to his brother who had frozen just inside the doorway, as if afraid his closeness would hurt the Angel further.
The thought left his blood running cold in his veins. Dean didn't get scared; he had spent thirty long painful years on Alistair's rack, he knew the true meaning of ongoing torment. These British asshats could do their worse, but they didn't have a hope in Hell (no pun intended) of breaking the hunter. He wasn't scared for himself, but his hands clamped protectively over his lower abdomen.
The angel rolled his eyes, sighing in frustration. He vaguely recalled the confusion he’d experienced upon first waking when he was without his grace and tried to remember that his mate had only just woken up, and he hadn’t slept for that long either. Putting Dean’s seemingly lack of comprehension down to that, Castiel licked his lips and started again, trying to explain as simply as he could, so he could get through to Dean’s sleep muddled mind.
Complete rage flashes through the hunter. The urge to smash the tormentor’s face in, ram his teeth down his throat till his crapping cavities. Cas was clearly driven rabid with the curse, muted in struggle, taking away his last defense and instead of helping one of their own they threatened to cut his dick off. Fuck!
“Son of a bitch!” Dean sighed out, almost under his breath, drawing Cas’ attention to the troubled looking hunter instead.
Once the brothers were both at a safe distance, he  raised his palm to the hole Dean had already started widening. His eyes lit up as he called upon his grace, before letting it explode from his vessel, focusing his power on the wall before him.
While they searched, Sam waited. Waited to see if Dean would bring up the subject. He doubted it, it was not Dean’s way to voluntarily open up, he was more likely to bottle everything up and never let anyone see that side of himself, but he gave his brother the chance anyway...
"Are you sure this is what you want?" Dean took the opportunity to ask, breathlessly, though he can see the answer in the Angel's eyes, read it in his expression, feel it in his eagerness, but he needed to hear it out loud to put the one last shred of his doubts fully to rest.
Cas pouted thoughtfully, considering Dean’s reasoning, eventually nodding along in agreement. Leaning back he slid his hands onto his lap beneath the table, seemingly relaxed and Dean couldn’t help but mimic him, happy that Cas had accepted his explanation and dropped the subject before it went any further.
Running his hand up Cas’ arm in an appreciative gesture, Dean stepped through the new ‘doorway’ into what he would transform into their baby’s bedroom. Looking around the space he let his imagination picture how it would look when it was finished, decorated and furnished. He still had a lot of work to do before it was perfect, but it was a start. A good start and that eased his worry.
“I-” Cas’ eyes were back to flitting aimlessly once more, his frown deepening. “What are you- how are you here?”
“Well, how about something a bit more subtle?” Dean reached towards where Cas had his hands tightly clasped together and prising them apart he gently took one in his own.
Dean frowned at the disarray of the bedroom that had been hidden from him before with the light being off. Everything he owned it seemed was thrown about the place, as if a tornado had swiped through the room while the pair of them had been distracted with each other. He'd been pretty out of it, but he thought he would have noticed if they had had an earthquake. "Cas?"
?’ Cas might get tossed around, maybe have his clothes burnt, or get a bit singed, but he would live through it. ‘
“Is that supposed to scare me?” she scoffed dryly, rolling her eyes. “Please. Your pet Angel can’t do anything-”
“So we don’t have to hike halfway round the bunker to get in,” Dean stated, giving his brother a ‘don’t ask stupid questions’ look. “Which reminds me, I need you to go to the hardware store,” he added, tugging a scrap of paper out of his back pocket and pushing it harshly into Sam’s hand.
Now really wasn’t the time for finger painting, but Dean remained quiet, giving the Angel a chance. Truth be told he was a little curious to what Cas was trying to explain, and he’d gone this far, might as well get the full story.
Cas is coming completely undone, because of him, because of Dean. His panted groans coming fast and rampant, lost in the throws of ecstasy.
With his eyes locked on Dean's face, ready for any sign of discomfort from the human beneath him, he slowly pushed just the tip of his middle finger in, breaching the tight ring of muscle.
Sam wriggled as many of the topmost bags that he could carry free, tucked a flat plastic wrapped package under his arm and made his way inside. He would unload the rest once he’d had a coffee.
He scrubbed his hands through his saturated hair. It was no wonder that his shoulders were knotted together tighter than the box of jumper cables in Baby’s trunk.
He shook his head unable to finish either sentence. How could he explain that to Cas? How could he explain it in a way that would make Cas understand. “You’re a frigging Angel, Cas... I shouldn’t... You deserve better.”
Dean’s tone isn’t calm but it isn’t the explosion that Sam feared, so he pushed further. “Come on, Dean. You really think Cas would do this to you intentionally?”
Dean knew what a strain it was to be still in those first moments, when your whole body burns with desire and all you can think of is the need to thrust into that hot clenching heat. He knows Cas is feeling that overpowering urge right now. He can feel the fierce tremor that vibrates through his Angel's skin and the tenseness of his muscles. Yet the kiss Cas gave him in that moment was nothing but tender and loving, no hint of urgency, no rush to take the edge off. Just a gentle brush of soft chapped lips against his partially clenched ones.
