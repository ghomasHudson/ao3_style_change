They met halfway and didn't think to pause as they embraced each other, stumbling from the force with which they had collided and almost toppling over before they regained their balance.
They both knew they needed to talk, to iron things out before they moved forward with this new aspect of their relationship, but they were both exhausted and desperately needed a moment of quiet.
John’s eyebrows raised, slightly taken aback. Of the few times Sherlock had visited the home John had shared with Mary, he’d given off the impression that he disliked the place; usually deigning to stand instead of sit on one of the chairs or engrossing himself in his phone for the whole time. The one time he had sat down in the living room was brief and he only perched a little awkwardly on the edge. John had once caught his face curling into a thinly veiled look of resentment at a photo of him, Mary and Rosie on their sofa not long after she was born. He had brushed it off as a buried sense of hatred for Mary after being shot by her and was quick to distract the detective, finding relief in the way his face had cleared once the picture was pushed out of mind. Still, in his current state, John wasn’t in any place to deny Sherlock much of anything, so he nodded with a small smile.
John chewed on the inside of his cheek, arms folding across his chest as he leaned back against the kitchen counter. Rosie was brushing her tiny fingers through Sherlock’s wayward and fuzzy curls in his peripheral, however, he didn’t turn to look at them, knowing that if he did he may lose his nerve.
John pressed his fist to his mouth as he worked to keep his tears at bay and Sherlock wanted to hold him so bad. His ocean eyes were shiny and his vision must be so cloudy because he wasn’t even blinking as he breathed through the overwhelming emotions that had come onto him in a wave.
“Because it’s true!” John snapped and Sherlock flinched, memories of a cold morgue and angry fists briefly clouding his already foggy mind before he blinked them back. He didn’t mean it; he hadn't been thinking straight. He wouldn’t do it again.
"Thought so" Greg smiled weakly before falling silent, the comforting warmth of his presence keeping Sherlock grounded in the wake of Eurus’ destruction. Closing his eyes again, Sherlock could see the splintered foundations of his Mind Palace, the thick fog that rolled through the hallways, the room dedicated to subjects and people all left in disarray. All but one.
Sherlock paused, his back to the tv screen with a frown darkening his features. He could see Mycroft out the corner of his eye, staring defeatedly at Eurus’ face displayed on the tv with his arms dropped limply at his sides.
The phone went to voicemail, the robotic female voice getting cut off as Eurus ended the call, "Alright, alright, I suppose we can call one more time" she said, speaking as one might to a group of disappointed children.
A hand gripped his shoulder and Sherlock realized he had been teetering precariously on his own feet, the nausea being very real and very disorienting. He was going to be sick. Mycroft held him upright without saying a word, just keeping Sherlock on his feet while he sent a venomous look to his sister.
“Yes, but it’s me calling” Sherlock retorted, turning his head slightly to address his brother and catching sight of his pale face and twitching hand. He turned back quickly when the phone went to voicemail and his heart sank. He dragged his hand across his face and repositioned himself in front of the tv as Eurus spoke up again.
When the formula was finally ready, John half ran into the living room and took his still flailing daughter from a very frazzled looking Sherlock. It took a couple of tries to get Rosie to drink it, but she eventually latched on and drank sulkily. "There you go, see? No need for all that fuss" John said, swaying a little and smiling down at her still red face.
John shook his head, "No, Sherlock, you need a proper nights sleep and a bed is the best way to get it" he said, but Sherlock’s frown only deepened and he opened his mouth to reply when Molly interrupted.
" He repeated, slower and raising his voice to something just below a whisper. Sherlock flushed and nodded, breaking eye contact and returning to his father.
John emerged from his room, having likely finished putting Rosie to bed while Sherlock was in the bathroom, with his pyjamas draped over an arm. He smiled at Sherlock and jerked his head in the direction of his room, "I forgot to tell you earlier that one of your brother’s lackeys dropped off some of your clothes and stuff while you were half asleep. It should be in the box in my room" he said, gently squeezing Sherlock’s arm as he passed on his way to the bathroom. His hand left Sherlock’s skin buzzing and he had to suppress a shudder until the doctor had shut the bathroom door behind him.
"Perhaps it would be easier to discuss in the morning" He said after a moment of deliberation, glancing at the clock which read 3:38am. Molly bit her bottom lip, the niggling feeling of curiosity and frustration pressing at the back of her mind the only thing keeping her exhaustion at bay. Even so, she nodded slowly.
[In which there is a walk in the park and confessions]
Rosie had just finished her formula when Sherlock’s phone rang and she scrunched up her face at the sudden noise. Sensing the impending doom, Sherlock grabbed the empty bottle and his phone and disappeared into the kitchen to take the call. John watched him go, a tiny hiccup from Rosie being the only thing that broke him from his daze and prompted him to go upstairs to settle her into bed. She went down surprisingly easy, having tired herself out from her tantrum and the long day outside. John pressed a kiss to her forehead and tucked one of her stuffed animals closer to her before shutting the curtains and silently exiting the room.
Sherlock’s heart picked up its already quickened pace, beating like a rabbit’s in the jaws of a fox, “No! No, John, please! This is important-”
"Now, pull yourself together, I need you fully alert for the next task. Don't keep me waiting" Eurus said with an air of finality before the screen went dark once again and the brothers were finally alone in the room.
I procrastinated and this chapter is a lil’ bit shorter than the others but compared the the last chapter it’s not too bad.
“Sherlock? Is something wrong?” John’s voice was soft and tired and the creaking of the stairs could be heard in the background.
Sherlock exhaled slowly and closed his eyes to collect his scattered thoughts, concentrating on the unsteady breathing coming from John on the other end of the phone. “Please, John” He said gently, opening his eyes again in time to see John’s face soften ever so slightly with the phone pressed against his ear again. “Just say it”
When they arrived home, the sky had darkened slightly and the clouds were tinted pink by the slowly setting sun. It sent warm light pooling into the living room and onto the soft rug under the coffee table, where the two cups of tea John had forgotten about still sat side by side.
"Oh, he’s here. I came to fetch you so he could take you home but…I wasn’t sure if you were all finished up here" Greg explained and glanced back into the empty ambulance. Sherlock huffed a bit through his nose, indignation filling the void where he had once felt fear and anger and simply nothing as he stood abruptly. The world immediately spun on it’s axis and he stumbled, shoes squeaking on the wet grass. "Hey, hey, easy, Sunshine" Greg had leapt up alongside Sherlock and gently held the disoriented detective until the fields stopped whirling around him like a tornado.
Rosie had gotten fussy on the way home and was squirming in Sherlock’s arms, having been handed over to him halfway there when she’d started thumping at her father's chest. She whined irritably as Sherlock tried to hush her with gentle kisses to her cheeks and forehead, though she soon began to angle her head away and push at his chin.
"John, please repeat these words for me; 'I love you'"
“Coffin. Problem; someone is about to die. It will be, as I understand it, a tragedy” She continued, bottom lip sticking out slightly in a faux pout. Sherlock adjusted his grip on the gun. “So many days not lived, so many words unsaid, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera-”
SORRY THIS IS SO LATE.
As he sat in the driver’s seat, Sherlock spoke up, "Thank you" He murmured, just above a whisper and John glanced over at him. He looked back with an almost blank face and you wouldn’t have thought he had been bawling his eyes out just moments before if it weren’t for his red rimmed eyes and dried tear tracks still staining his cheeks. John wanted to gently wipe all traces of Sherlock’s sorrow from his face and push his mess of curls from his forehead so that he could kiss it, if only to see that small flicker of a smile. Instead, he just smiled at the detective.
"How are you doing?" Greg asked, settling beside Sherlock and watching him. He wasn’t expectant, though he looked at the detective with thinly veiled concern.
"I think she’ll want a nap after this" Sherlock piped up, his voice a lot closer than John expected, and reached forward to carefully wipe a tiny tear that lingered on Rosie’s cheek. Normally she would have already had her nap that day, but what with the outing and losing track of time, she’d missed it and now she wouldn’t sleep until later that night. Missed naps also often meant a long night of screaming and little to no sleep for everyone in the house. However, if she was on the verge of throwing another fit, John was willing to risk the sleep deprivation to avoid that.
I Love You
"Well, actually" Molly turned and handed John a mug of tea before going about making herself one. He thanked her quietly and took a sip, relishing in its familiar warmth and taste. Oddly enough, Molly was always the one who could make his tea properly and he could always count on her for a good cuppa. Lord knows Sherlock tries, but the only time he spends in the kitchen is to work on his experiments and is painfully inexperienced when it comes to food or drink.
Maybe it would be a good thing. If he couldn't think, he couldn't remember, and if that meant a migraine then so be it. Sherlock would give anything to never have to think again.
"Both of you, c’mon," He said loudly, breaking through the haze of Sherlock’s usually racing mind. It had slowed with the exhaustion of looking after Rosie and he counted himself surprised at the toll looking after a child had taken on him. He grunted and slowly slid off of the sofa, stumbling a little as his legs, still heavy from sleep, forgot how to hold him upright. John had already disappeared up the stairs and Sherlock followed, laboriously trekking up the 15 steps to the landing. He poked his head into Rosie’s room and cocked it in question.
But it couldn’t be. John had been adamant, from the very start, that he was not interested in men. ‘Not gay’ might has well have been written on his forehead in permanent marker from all the times he’d said it. He had even married a woman, Mary, for god’s sake. He could not love Sherlock. Even if he matched perfectly with the description of whoever the coffin was for, even if Sherlock could sometimes feel lingering glances on the back of his neck and if John sometimes gripped his elbow for a little longer than necessary or moved to touch him before aborting at the last minute. Sherlock could explain it all away as platonic. A way to reassure John that Sherlock was still alive and well after everything that has happened.
Steeling himself, John shuffled even closer - realisation flickered in Sherlock’s pale eyes - and kissed Sherlock.
“It’s true, Sherlock” John repeated, voice muffled from where it was hidden behind his hand and quieter than before, defeated and somehow even more tired. “It’s true and it always has been. From the very first time I saw you”
"Thanks, Greg" Sherlock said over his shoulder, not turning to gouge the DI’s reaction, but he knew that he must be smiling.
John exhaled through his teeth and switched position again, planting his feet on the carpet to ground himself and shaking his leg irritably, "Why? Why are you doing this, Sherlock? I can't. You know I can't" He hissed, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees, perhaps to still his leg.
John shook his head despite thinking they couldn’t see him, his face was crumpled as though he was in pain and his bottom lip trembled minutely. “I c-…” His voice cracked and he took a deep, trembling breath before he tried again, “I can’t… I’m sorry”
Sherlock looked up when he entered and offered a very small, weak smile. John set the tray on the coffee table and sat on the other side of Sherlock.
I’m feeling confident about finishing this but you never know, especially with my GCSEs just around the corner.
Sherlock's heart rose to his throat in despair or elation, he couldn't tell anymore, not with it thudding too loud in his ears and sending blood rushing through his body, lighting his nerves on fire and urgency once again made itself known. Get him to say it. You have to.
Sherlock was ordering their food and drinks while John looked for a table. He found a small booth in a more secluded corner that offered privacy and he slid onto one side. He carefully undid Rosie’s carrier once he was settled and pulled her out, disturbing her from the light doze she had been in since they left Regent’s Park. He set the carrier beside him and settled his daughter on his lap, where she leaned into his chest and drifted off into sleep.
“Yes, yes, yes, and this, I presume, will be their coffin?” Sherlock interrupted, indicating the coffin with the barrel of his gun. He couldn’t stand the mock sadness in his sister’s voice and the carelessness with which she spoke of someone being killed, someone (Sherlock could assume) close to him. Eurus didn’t need to tell him she had killed before for him to know.
"Sleep well?" John asked, rising from the table to dump the rest of his cold tea in the sink and retrieve Rosie’s bottle for Sherlock.
Sherlock's breath hitched and his eyes widened as he saw John on the sofa, relaxed, with his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles, Rosie cradled in his arms.
“Emotional context, Sherlock, it destroys you every time”
"Will you two be alright with Rosie once I leave? I can always take her back to mine if she’ll be too much trouble" Molly offered lightly, coming closer to John to gently stroke Rosie’s blonde curls as she drank her formula. John knew she was giving them the chance to talk without interruption, but looking down into his daughter’s large blue eyes made the guilt that had already made a home in his stomach rear its head like a kind of sinister beast.
"We all went out after you left, so she missed her nap and got into a bit of a tizzy. She’s still up now but I think she’ll fall asleep soon" He said, stifling a yawn that both Rosie and Sherlock caught. John grinned.
Sherlock nodded and ducked back out, heading to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face. There was always a spare toothbrush in the bathroom and Sherlock would’ve assumed it was Mary’s if he couldn’t deduce the entirety of it’s use at a glance. He was the only one who had ever used it.
Sherlock's brow furrowed as he walked into the cold, damp room. The harsh winds from outside were sweeping into the room through a large vent in the ceiling, directly above the neat, polished coffin, sitting innocently on a metal table. The lid was on one end of the room, propped up against the wall and with the front facing away from the two brothers. There was a large TV screen on the opposite side of the room, mounted on the wall and identical to the one to it's right.
John entered at Sherlock’s offended tone and cocked his head to the side in question. Sherlock had taken off his coat and draped it over one of the chairs at the kitchen table and was perched on the counter, ankles crossed. He shook his head at John with an exasperated expression before returning to his conversation.
"What words? Sherlock, I'm not really in the mood for your games-"
"I know" Sherlock interrupted, and this time John did look at him, finding his face solemn as he dipped his head to give his goddaughter better access to his hair. "I know we have to talk, but I just-…" he sighed and trailed off, but John understood. They both knew that whatever the outcome of their conversation would be, their relationship would change. Whether it be noticeably or not, it didn’t matter, the change was inevitable and neither was sure if they were ready.
Molly waved a hand dismissively, "It’s nothing, you know I love looking after her" she said with a reassuring smile that John could only half return. Even with Molly’s assurance that it wasn’t a bother, he couldn’t help the guilt that settled in the pit of his stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
John woke to the sound of pigeons crooning outside his window. The pale morning light coated the inside of his eyelids orange and when he opened his eyes it gleamed into his face, forcing him to quickly shut them again with a soft grunt. He turned to lay on his other side before opening his eyes again and was greeted with the sight of a peacefully asleep Sherlock beside him. Memories that had been held back during his short time between sleep and consciousness flashed through his mind and he dragged a hand across his face, suppressing a tired groan.
John felt a deep ache bloom in his chest at Sherlock’s tone (trying to be hopeful, but ultimately weak) and he squeezed his hand as he tried to come up with a reassuring response. The slightly forlorn look on Sherlock’s face felt like being crushed under a heavy weight, "Then perhaps…it was a blessing in disguise"
“Why?” John asked, his own voice beginning to shake as he leaned forward, hooking an arm under his legs to hold them close to his chest, “Why are you doing this, Sherlock? I can’t. You know I can’t” John said, shifting again to plant his feet on the carpet, feet sinking into the soft fabric as he rested his elbows on his knees.
Mycroft shot a troubled look at his brother as Eurus' lips curved into a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. Sherlock tried not to think of the similarities between that and Moriarty's dead eye smile.
"There, one for luck"
Sherlock paused and drummed his fingers against the draining board, "No, I don’t think so" he said after a moment, his brow furrowed, "I reckon I’ll just be the buffer between them; stop things before they get too ugly"
John dragged a hand across his face like he knew Sherlock had flinched and he sighed heavily, exhaustion colouring his entire demeanour. There were unshed tears in his eyes and his breathing was sharp and stilted through the staticky receiver.
"Because I-..." he swallowed, "I-I...." come on, Sherlock, get it together now, "I love you."
"What- Oh!" John exclaimed as Sherlock tugged him down and kissed him fiercely for a brief moment before pulling away and grinning impishly up at him.
"Victor Trevor" The detective’s wavered on the boy’s name and John’s heart sank to his feet, his whole body going cold as he sagged back in his chair, a contrast to Sherlock’s stiff muscles and straight back.
He had, shamefully, not thought about John since the phone call, too caught up in the whirlwind that was Eurus' sick games and the prospect of never leaving that cursed prison alive. But he was alive, a bit shaken up and probably harbouring more emotional damage than he had the energy to process, but he was alive.
A smile slowly spread on Molly’s face and she rose from he seat to start making tea for when Sherlock inevitably came downstairs. Her amusement was contagious, it seemed, as John felt his own grin forming on his face and he settled back into his chair, listening to the soft noises upstairs.
Rosie was surprisingly obedient when John dressed her. It could be the good night's sleep or the abundance of affection she’d received that day, perhaps even a mixture of both. Either way, her joy was contagious and once she was dressed warmly, John kissed her forehead and picked her up off the changing table.
John sighed heavily, “Give me a reason why. One valid reason, and I’ll say it” he said, moving so that he was now leaning back against the sofa cushions again while his leg continued to shake.
Sherlock frowned, his head tilting to side slightly as he tried to pick out the meaning behind those trembling words. “No, I…why can’t-”
Sherlock looked up from where he had been staring at his hands, cradled in his lap, and straight into the eyes of Greg Lestrade, "Hey, Sunshine, John's looking for you, you should go to him if you're not too roughed up, he was in borderline hysterics when I left him" the DI said, looking at Sherlock as though the detective may shatter at any second.
"It's not-...it's not like that-"
"Yes…yes I know, Mummy but-…right, but he-…I know…so you’ve said…no I’m not!"
“Why isn’t he answering?” Sherlock muttered, brows furrowed and the hand that wasn’t holding the gun clenched and unclenched. John still didn’t reach for his phone, seemingly content to ignore it until the call went to voicemail.
"Because…" Sherlock swallowed and began wrapped and unwrapping the tie on the dressing gown around his hand. "Because I was scared"
[In which there is a lot of tea and talking]
When they opened the door to John’s house, they were greeted by a very concerned, very tired Molly. She was dressed in her pyjamas under a thick dressing gown and her hair was tied in a loose plait that hung over her shoulder.
Something about the sight of his best friend made Sherlock stop in his tracks, unable to move further or tear his gaze away from the man a small distance away. The events that took place at Sherrinford over the phone flashed before his eyes and he wondered if John was angry at him. It wouldn’t be the first time and he couldn’t blame him. He’d left him out again and put him and Rosie in danger in the process. Sherlock chewed on his bottom lip and took a tiny step back, but it was too late. John had looked up and their eyes met almost immediately.
The café, as Sherlock had promised, was nice. Tiny and quaint with rustic decor and warm, dim lights. It smelt strongly of coffee and pastries and the pleasant murmur of voices added to the homey feel.
"She killed my best friend…"
“I-…” John swallowed, “I love you too”
Sherlock stopped abruptly, fists clenching and unclenching, his shoulders tensing and curling slightly inward. No. No, no, no, no, no-
Shaking his head fondly, John left the bedroom and took his first full breath since heading upstairs with Sherlock. The air was thick between them and a tension followed them whenever they were together. John knew it must be from the phone call that had started his whole involvement in the situation, the one that had seemingly broken them both and caused a rift in their relationship. They had both confessed their long suppressed feelings for each other, but they still couldn’t breach the lines drawn from an early stage of their friendship. There was still a barrier between them and the simple confession wasn’t enough to break it. It was frustrating, but John knew he had to be cautious. Everything was fragile and raw from past events and the last thing John wanted was to push Sherlock away again or vice-versa.
"No! Don't! Please, John, please, just say it!" Sherlock raised his voice, reaching out toward the screen as though John could see him, could see the panic swimming in his eyes and the tremors wracking his outstretched hand.
John nodded, "Thanks for taking care of her on such short notice, it means a lot"
The smile dropped from Sherlock’s face as the memories of the other night returned with a vengeance and John’s heart rose to his throat, immediately regretting his words. He was about to apologise when Sherlock beat him to it, "Well…I doubt we would have on our own…"
John was quiet for a moment, chewing on his fingernails as he held the phone closer. He looked like his was mere inches from bursting into tears, his face tight and jaw working as his grit his teeth, biting back the lump threatening to push those tears from his eyes.
"If she continues to be around you, then far too smart for her own good" John teased, though Sherlock’s face fell slightly and his gaze snapped to John’s.
"Right, but I meant the bit about your dad asking after me. Oh, and what’s happening tomorrow?" John asked, handing the last mug to Sherlock and drying his hands on a tea towel.
IT FINALLY HAPPENED!
"Oh- John!"
Just the two of them, together, and nothing else.
John watched Sherlock’s eyes mist up and had to swallow down his own tears when the bitterness seeped into his friend’s tone towards the end. They sat in silence, John unable to think of an appropriate response and Sherlock unwilling to elaborate. John knew he would in his own time, (this confession, alone, was a breakthrough) and he didn’t mind waiting, he just wished he could ease the pain, even just slightly.
Eurus gripped him tighter when heavy footsteps thundered up the stairs and Sherlock curled protectively around his little sister, "It's okay" he whispered despite himself, "It's all going to be okay..."
[In which there are tantrums and plans are made]
"Eurus did?" John asked after composing himself, his voice soft and careful. Sherlock nodded and John saw him swallow hard.
John sighed and took a large gulp of his tea before answering, "Sherlock…has a sister"
“Whose coffin, Sherlock” Eurus answered, her smile gone and her eyebrows raised in a deceptively open expression, “Please, start your deductions. I will apply some, context in a moment”
"For what it’s worth, John" Sherlock started, pausing to catch John’s eyes, "I’ve never doubted you since…"
The detective frowned, "You don’t have to do that, John…" he said, "I’ll be fine on the sofa"
"Not a chance," He said, attempting to wriggle out from under John, who curled his arms around the detective’s waist. "Oh- you bastard, let go!"
When he opened them again, he was outside, the cold wind biting at any exposed skin and police officers and paramedics milling around the entrance to Musgrave. The pain in his head had lessened enough that, when a Paramedic came over (37, newly married, infertile), he was able to answer her questions with minimal struggle. She offered him painkillers for his head and recommended he seek therapy for his experience, before settling him on the back step of an ambulance and draping a bright orange shock blanket over his shoulders. A little way away, Sherlock could see Eurus being escorted into a helicopter that sat in the stretch of field beyond Musgrave’s front garden. He looked away and down at his hands, unable to watch his sister be taken back into custody.
“Oh!” Eurus suddenly piped up again and Sherlock grit his teeth against the voice he was quickly growing to despise, “One important restriction; you are not allowed to mention, in any way, that his life is in danger. You may not, at any point, suggest that there is any form of crisis. If you do, I will end this session and his life. Are we clear?”
There was a hint of resentment in Mycroft’s voice that Sherlock was not too keen to unpack. He ignored it in favour of staring into the coffin once more and resting his hands on the rim, just above where the head would be, as he began the flip through all the possible people it could be meant for.
“Oh, do be sensible, there were no explosives in his little house” Eurus continued, her voice growing quickly irritable like she was speaking to a petulant child and not her older brother, “Why would I be so clumsy?”
"What was that about then?" John asked, rinsing out the mugs and bottles that had accumulated in the sink.
"N-No, no, it's not that it's uhm...I just need you to repeat these words exactly" Sherlock said, fighting to keep the fear and panic from his voice as John came back into view on the cameras, rounding the sofa and curling up in one corner.
“No! Don’t hang up! Do not hang up!” Sherlock raised his voice, reaching out towards the screen as if he could touch John, could encircle him in his arms and whisper a thousand ‘Sorrys’ and ‘I love yous’ until the pain went away for good.
John hummed thoughtfully, "I don’t think I
The bed was a little cool and Sherlock shuddered, curling into a ball and wrapping the duvet tighter around him after tucking the borrowed jumper under the pillow. John appeared a while later and settled in the bed beside him before clicking off the bedside lamp.
Molly bit her lip and tapped her nail against her mug, "Yeah he didn’t look great when you guys turned up…"
"I also must say that you cannot, in any way, let John know that he is in danger, you must act as though everything is normal" Eurus was raising the remote again, presumably to call John, and Sherlock shared one last look with his brother before nodding once and peeling his fingers from the coffin to stand in front of the TV screen.
When he was done, he headed downstairs after poking his head into Rosie’s room, finding her, surprisingly, still asleep, and entered the kitchen. Molly was already in there, making tea with her hair loose around her shoulders, "Good morning" she said as he sat down at the table.
"Don’t worry about it, John, I’ll live" He said, and John waited until he heard the detective slide under the duvet before turning back around. Sherlock looked impossibly small all alone in the bed and his eyes were already closed, fatigue drawing lines in his face as he buried himself further under the duvet.
"Yes, yes, whatever, go before she reaches a pitch only dogs can hear" Sherlock waved a hand in the direction of the door and John rolled his eyes as he slipped out of bed and shuffled to the door.
"It was years ago. She’s back in Sherrinford now so…" Sherlock trailed off and his gaze slid from the window to his and John’s entwined hands. He moved his own so that he could gently trace his thumb over the thin lines of John’s plans before speaking again. "He was my only friend…apparently I was so traumatised at the time that I ‘re-wrote’ my memories into thinking I had a dog instead. Redbeard." His lips quirked up slightly at the mention of his (imaginary) dog, "And when Eurus was sent away I gradually forgot about her. Until recently."
Sherlock sneered a little at that, but he softened and nodded once. John beamed and caught Sherlock’s eye, eliciting that shy smile that was reserved only for those closest to the detective.
When he was done he hesitated in the hallway, glancing between John’s room and the guest room. Since Molly was no longer using the spare bedroom he didn’t have to sleep in John’s room. Of course, that didn’t mean he didn’t
"Not Baker Street" said Sherlock suddenly, stopping in his tracks by the passenger side door.
John was crying too, albeit more quietly as he sank a hand into Sherlock's dark curls,
“I love you”
After he’d burped Rosie, Molly came back into the kitchen to say goodbye, her overnight bag hanging from her shoulder. Rosie reached out to her when she came close and she gladly took the little girl into her arms. "You promise you will call if something goes wrong," She said as she bounced Rosie lightly, much to her endless amusement.
“He’s perfectly safe. For the moment...” Eurus spoke up again, leaning forward and picking up her remote. She pressed a button and the tv screen flickered before splitting into four. One section was black with a glowing white timer frozen at 3 minutes printed into the darkness, while the other three sections were all different angles of John’s living room. John was sitting on the sofa, feet resting on the coffee table and leaned back into the soft cushions. He had Rosie cradled in his arms and she snoozed on his shoulder while he gently stroked her golden curls.
"Can…" Sherlock bit his lip, "C-can we go to yours?"
"Yes, tomorrow…okay…yes, you too…but I-…fine, I love you too…yes, goodbye…bye"  He ended the call and sighed tiredly, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands.
All the anguish and pain Sherlock had kept at bay burst forth in a choked sob, salty tears finally falling freely and rapidly down his cheeks as he pressed his face into John's shoulder, his body shaking with the strength of each violent sob.
John froze. He was still for a long moment in which Sherlock kept glancing, anxiously, at the timer, until he raised his other hand to also hold the phone and press it closer to his ear, “Again…say it again” he breathed, and Sherlock obliged quickly.
Sherlock looked a lot younger in his sleep; like the young teenager he often acted like with his face relaxed and dark curls falling in a messy cloud around his head, ringed by golden light in a kind of halo. John thought back to find out if he had ever seen Sherlock asleep before and could only vaguely recall a time before the fall when he’d come home from shopping to find his roommate passed out on the sofa. Watching Sherlock’s face a little longer, John debated waiting for him to wake up before leaving the warm comfort of the bed, but the pressure in his bladder urged otherwise and he careful slipped out of the bed. He replaced the duvet around Sherlock, who shifted and grumbled softly in his sleep before settling again, and John left for the bathroom, wondering what it would be like to wake up like that everyday.
"What do I-...." His eyes trailed to the coffin lid, golden plaque winking derisively at him, "...Oh..." his heart plummeted, crashing to the floor and breaking into thousands of tiny pieces. No...not that, anything but that.
"Oh, he’s absolutely smitten" John agreed, chuckling along with Molly as footsteps padded from Rosie’s room to the stairs.
He shuffled closer and Sherlock looked up from where he’d been staring at their hands again, expression questioning and painfully innocent. Far too innocent for a man like Sherlock. John’s eyes darted across the detective’s face, unsure of what he was about to do. He knew it was highly unlikely that Sherlock would not reciprocate, but even so, the little niggling fear in the back of his head refused to leave.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something indignant when a high pitched cry rang through the house. John groaned and dropped his head onto Sherlock’s chest, the sharp point of his collarbones pressing into his forehead, "That has to be a record"
"What do you reckon she’ll be like when she’s a bit older?" Sherlock suddenly asked and when John looked up at him, he too was watching the children with a veiled fondness in his eyes. His adoration for Rosie had come as a bit of a surprise to John, a pleasant one at that. The first time he’d held Rosie was the same day she had been born. Mary had fallen asleep and John called Sherlock in as the detective hadn’t been allowed in the room during the birthing process. John had handed the tiny baby over to Sherlock, who’d held her with such care he may have been convinced she was made of glass. She was still slightly pink and she’d scrunched up her nose before settling against Sherlock’s chest, falling asleep almost immediately. John would forever believe he had seen Sherlock hold his breath when the baby cuddled into him and he would be lying if he didn’t feel overjoyed at the whole experience. It was almost like an initiation and Sherlock had passed with flying colours.
"We should probably settle her down somewhere," John said after a while, glancing up at Sherlock to gauge his reaction. His face was decidedly blank as it usually was when confronted with facts he was not quite ready to digest, but he nodded if a bit reluctantly.
Sherlock was beginning to shake all over now. ‘Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, just SHUT. UP.’
Anyway, updates will be irregular and will probs be even more so when school starts up again (if it does at all what with covid and the shoddy way it’s being dealt with over here in the England) so heads up for that!
John looked up at him in confusion, brow furrowed, "Why not?" He asked, keeping a steadying hand on his friend’s elbow. Sherlock’s jaw tightened and he kept his gaze turned away from John.
John turned back and shot Sherlock a questioning look that the detective only returned by sitting up and beckoning him over with a finger. Squinting suspiciously, John cautiously made his way back to bed and stood beside Sherlock.
“John, I just need you to do something very easy for me, without asking why”
John had to blink a couple of times before he could respond, "The usual place?" Sherlock nodded, "Sure" he shrugged and waited for Sherlock to disappear through the door before he let out a shaky sigh. John could swear the bugger kept doing that on purpose.
"She’s not allowed any of this yet, is she?" Sherlock asked as he sat opposite John, shrugging his coat off of his shoulders and letting it pool around him on the seat.
After whatever barrier that had caused them to pause broke, the pair of them bolted towards each other, exhaustion forgotten as John ducked under the police tape that sectioned the area off and Sherlock's blanket slipped off his shoulders.
"Oh, come now, Sherlock, use that wonderful mind of yours and figure it out" She said, encouraging but with sinister undertones that sent shivers trembling up Sherlock's spine.
Sherlock froze and John felt panic surge through his veins. He made to pull away, cursing himself for overstepping a boundary, when a cool hand cupped the back of his head and tugged him back in.
Lotta love
"Yes, but you can’t just say that and expect everything to be okay again. Two years, Sherlock. If you had just told me none of this would have happened" Even as he said it, John knew he couldn’t and wouldn’t change much about their current situation. His eyes trailed guilty over to where Rosie was still lying across her mat with one of the toys she’d pulled from its string hugged to her chest.
John burst into giggles at the swift change in tone and Sherlock shot a glare in his direction. "Hi…yes she was…no I’m fine, I promise…he is…you want-…he’s a bit busy right now…right, yeah, of course…has Mycroft spoken to either of you?… ah…uh-huh…" John perked up and tried to catch Sherlock’s eye, which took far longer than was necessary.
John’s raised his eyebrows, but didn’t speak, waiting silently for Sherlock to continue, which he did after a moment of trying to compose himself.
The screen momentarily filled with an image of Moriarty as he made the tick tock sounds of a clock again and Sherlock huffed a small sigh through his nose, “John, please repeat these words for me” the screen switched back to the angles of John’s living room and Sherlock took a deep breath before continuing on, “I love you”
He entered cautiously, ready to shoot at any time as he took in the cell’s appearance, keeping his grip on the gun tight even after deeming the room safe enough the enter further. He peered into the coffin, examining the spotless linen for any telling creases or stains, but there was nothing. Even the wood was nicely polished and cleaned so that it shone in the muted light coming from the vent. Sherlock could hear his brother, Mycroft, entering the cell at a weary pace behind him while the metal door slid closed with a metallic screech that set their teeth on edge.
"Alright, let’s get you home then, hm?" John said standing and pulling Sherlock to his feet along with him. His legs buzzed with pins and needles and his head swam slightly, the quick recession of his fear and anxiety leaving him with something akin to vertigo. Sherlock seemed a little worse off than him as he stumbled and gripped John’s shoulders for balance. It hurt to see the usually cool and composed detective so vulnerable and clumsy, but John swallowed the lump that rose in his throat and instead guided Sherlock over to his car.
"What are you two giggling about?" Sherlock asked when he entered, looking slightly ridiculous in one of John’s dressing gowns and with a baby batting at his chin. Rosie was cradled close to his chest and John almost forgot about all that had taken place yesterday at the sight of them both.
“I love you, so much, Sherlock” John repeated and Sherlock looked back up at the tv screen, a tiny, involuntary smile tugging at his lips in spite of the situation. It was like everything had stopped to accommodate for this little moment between the detective and his doctor, like they were standing right in front of each other, reading each other’s emotions through their silences.
"Mycroft will probably send a car, but I think we agreed on 3 pm," He said, hoisting himself back onto the counter again and crossing his ankles.
"Very" Sherlock replied, handing Rosie off to John so that he could mix the formula with the water. The little girl squealed happily when her father kissed her forehead and clutched at his shirt with tiny fists. John hugged her tight and refused to wonder if Sherlock’s we’ll rest was because of his presence in the bed.
Another chapter DONE
As he was pulling his clothes on, John noticed Sherlock’s coat hung up on the back of the door and grabbed it on his way out of the room. It was nearing May, which meant sunny days were becoming increasingly common, however, what with it being England, it never guaranteed a warm day. It was unlikely that Sherlock would care and John didn’t want him to catch a cold on top of whatever revelations he’d had last night that he still hadn’t told John about.
"Hi, John!" Molly’s voice crackled over the line, her voice far too cheerful for this time of night. "Sorry for calling so late, I couldn’t find a spare moment. I’m just checking in to see if everything’s alright?"
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirked up in that genuine half-smile John adored and the detective rose from the sofa. "Yes, I think a walk will do all three of us some good," he said, walking over to the two Watsons and reaching up to gently pull a bit of fuzz from Rosie’s hair.
John was entering a pleasant doze when his phone rang out and Rosie squealed in delight. He jolted awake, though his limbs didn’t seem to get the memo and were still heavy as lead when he tried to reach for his phone.
"So the line went dead and I panicked because he was being weird the whole time, so I called you to look after Rosie and went to Greg. I was lucky he was on duty at the time and we got a call from Mycroft not long after, telling us about what happened and that Sherlock was at Musgrave with Eurus, their sister" John looked down into his mug and twirled it around to create ripples in the beverage it held, "We went over there and I had to wait for Sherlock to be checked over and when I saw him…" he trailed off to drag his hand across his head, the image of Sherlock standing like he wasn’t sure his own feet could keep him upright and the darkened rings around his bloodshot eyes still branded in his vision whenever he closed his eyes. "He looked like hell"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I-...I meant i-it" Sherlock stuttered, voice nasally and broken by jumps in his breathing.
Eurus considered the detective with an expression close to pity, "Saved him? You think you saved him?" She asked and Mycroft bowed his head, already having predicted what his sister would say. "There were no bombs in John's house"
The tv screen burst into life and the slightly unsaturated image of their sister, Eurus, filled it. She looked delighted, her hands pressed together, palm to palm, in front of her face in a parody of Sherlock’s thinking pose. Her smile didn’t quite reach her sunken eyes despite the thinly veiled glee that swirled in their depths.
"Good. Now eat your food, you’ve barely touched it" John said, leaning back and nudging Sherlock’s plate closer to him, ignoring the eye roll it caused.
He glanced at the camera where he knew Eurus was watching him and answered quickly, “No, no, it’s nothing like that I just-… I need you to repeat these words exactly” He replied, wrangling his voice into some semblance of calm as he watched John return to the living room. He noted the very slow, reluctant tread as his friend rounded the sofa and dropped back onto the fluffy cushions, curling up in a corner and wrapping his free arm around himself. Was he cold? Why was he cold? His home almost always seemed to be warmer than Baker Street. Sherlock shook his head to clear it. He was getting off topic.
The dial up sound echoed in the room and Sherlock could hear John's phone ringing through the TV speakers.
"Are you two gonna tell me what happened now?" Molly asked, glancing between the two men and pausing her ministrations on Sherlock’s still ice cold hand. "You were really frantic when I came to watch Rosie" she settled her gaze on John and noted the minute flush of his cheeks. He sighed and shifted positions slightly, maintaining a respectable distance from Sherlock whilst still remaining a comforting presence.
After a while of weaving through police officers and paramedics, Sherlock found John at the sidelines of the crime scene, his hands buried in his coat pockets and his jaw clenched. He was looking around, probably for Sherlock, with his mouth pressed into a thin line and his brow furrowed into a worried expression that drew deep lines into his skin.
Sherlock sagged in defeat, his grip on the gun loosening to the point where it was dangerously close to falling from his trembling hand. Mycroft sighed like the weight of the world had pressed itself onto his shoulders and he slowly moved to stand beside his brother. He didn’t touch Sherlock, he wouldn’t dare in the state his little brother had been worked into, he just stood close by; a comforting presence that, while he would never admit it, Sherlock appreciated.
He looked up into the face of Greg Lestrade and something eased in the weight on his chest. The familiarity of the DI’s face was a clarity in the foggy maze of his mind and he clung to it like a lifeline.
He owed John an explanation. More than that. He owed years of unsaid words and sorrys that Sherlock's pride had cruelly withheld from his best friend. An explanation first, though, he'll get to the rest later, right now, he needed to find John and fucking talk to him.
John’s lips twitched at the image of Sherlock watching his brother get chewed out by their parents with amusement and knew the younger Holmes would wait a while before saving Mycroft from their wrath. "What time do you have to be there?" He asked, unable to keep the hint of laughter from his voice and Sherlock grinned.
"I’m so sorry, Sherlock" he breathed, adjusting Rosie and reaching across the table to pry Sherlock’s hand from his cup and lace it with his own. He squeezed gently and felt a small ounce of relief when there was a tiny squeeze in response.
John let out a long dramatic groan and let go of his newfound lover, "Fine, but you can’t bail the next time she starts screaming"  he said as Sherlock scrambled to the other side of the bed, sniggering.
Oh god....what have I done?
John smiled, "Me too" he whispered, searching Sherlock’s face and finding only contentment in the soft expression. He swallowed thickly before speaking again, now just above a whisper, "You said this morning that you meant it when you told me you loved me"
The inside of the coffin was filled with soft linen, snowy white and freshly cleaned, ready to be used.
"He really is fond of her, isn’t he?" Molly said when Sherlock’s soothing murmurs turned into a quiet lullaby and Rosie started to giggle instead of cry.
Sherlock's breathing grew sharp, panicked, and he glanced at Mycroft, who's face had gone ashen and ghostly, "Rosie...you can't-....she's a child" The detective choked out, his hands gripping the rim of the coffin so hard his knuckles began going white.
Unconvinced, she looked over at John, who offered a small smile, "What he said" he jerked his head in Sherlock’s direction.
Sherlock felt Mycroft brush past him to get a closer look at the coffin, his fingers drifting across the smooth surface in search of dust, of which there was none.
“His home is rigged to explode in approximately three minutes, unless I hear the release code from his lips.” Eurus continued; the enjoyment she was getting out of these tests evident in her voice. Sherlock rounded the coffin again to stand in front of the tv screen, staring in abject horror at the image of John so relaxed and unaware of the danger he was in. His sister’s words hadn’t even processed in his mind until he realized he didn’t know the release code. “I’m calling him on your phone, Sherlock. Make him say it” Eurus’ words came through the intercom and Sherlock looked up towards the camera in the corner, pointing straight towards the coffin.
Sherlock had set Rosie down on her mat with the toys dangling over her head. She giggled and raised her arms to bat at the colourful, plastic animals above her while Sherlock sat tentatively on the sofa. John joined him a moment later and they found themselves in that familiar charged silence that only seemed to encapsulate them. It was rare that their silences ever penetrated anyone nearby, even if they appeared aware of it's presence, and even more so Rosie, who continued to be blissfully unaware of the thick tension between the other two in the room.
The sky was moderately clear with a few snowy white clouds drifting lazily in the chilly breeze and blocking out the sun occasionally. John had Rosie in her carrier and she had her head tilted back towards the sky, staring at the shapeless fluffs that coiled in the endless blue with fascination. Sherlock walked beside them and had to bite his lip to stop the chuckles that threatened to bubble out of his throat, finding the image of Rosie looking at clouds open-mouthed and wide-eyed extremely amusing. John was grinning too, unable to wipe it from his face as he continued to walk down the street with his two favourite people in the whole world.
Lotta love
Rosie, intrigued by the noise, watched the children and their dog as they passed, watching as they disappeared momentarily before reappearing a couple of meters from where she lost sight of them.
I don’t think I’ll post before New Years (literally tomorrow where the hell does the time go!?) so in case I don’t emerge from my tiny fanfic hole, have a great New Year, stay safe and let’s hope for a better year <3
"BECAUSE IT'S TRUE!" John snapped, rocking forward and dragging a hand across his face, coming to cover his mouth while his eyes went shiny with unshed tears.
John laughed, though there was no humour behind it. It was far from his usual sunny laughter that bubbled out of him after a witty remark from Sherlock or whenever Rosie smiled or giggled at him. No, this was a cold and disquieted laugh that spoke of years of trauma left undealt with in a dusty box in the corner of his mind. “You fucking arse” He said, and Sherlock nodded minutely even though John couldn’t see him. John was smiling now, as he was known to do when he was extremely angry or frustrated. It wasn’t a happy smile by any means and it forced Sherlock to suppress a shudder. The waves raging in the howling winds outside of the cell were reflected in John’s eyes that had lost some of the vibrant ocean blue they’d had during the early years of their friendship.
Sherlock swallowed the growing lump in his throat and tried to clear his mind, rid himself of his emotions for a while. To save John. To save Rosie. God, Rosie. She wasn't even a full year old yet...
“Sherlock…” Mycroft whispered and Sherlock realized he’d come to stand closer to him. His voice was comforting in a way Sherlock hadn’t heard it in years and he felt suddenly calmer than before. Not at all relaxed, far from it, but his mind had cleared enough for the words to come out smoothly enough.
“It doesn’t work like that, Sherlock” He said quietly and he started to shake his leg irritably. Sherlock’s bottom lip trembled, and he knew John was right and that this was cruel, but one glance at the timer made him bite his lip to keep it still and avert his gaze back to John’s hunched image on the sofa.
Something about John’s presence around him broke the rest of the dam that had been blocking all of Sherlock’s pent up and repressed emotions. He wrapped his arms around John let out a shuddering sob, quiet but definitely there, and held him closer. "I’m sorry" He mumbled into the doctor’s shoulder, unable to stop the oncoming waves of tears, "I’m so sorry, John"
"What did you-...bring him back! Call him back! Now! I won, I saved him, you have to let me speak to him!" Sherlock cried, stepping away to pace the length of the room, his steps clumsy and not as measured as they typically were.
"Mycroft told my parents about Eurus. They thought she died years ago and now they’re pissed beyond reason with him. Of course, he won’t answer the phone so they come to me" Sherlock explained, dropping from the counter and wordlessly coming to stand beside John to dry the mugs he’d washed.
Molly’s eyes had slowly widened throughout John’s explanation and her hand slowly rose to cover her mouth seemingly of its own volition, "That’s awful"
John’s sigh crackled over the receiver and he paused before replying, the only sound being soft rustle of bedsheets as he gently lay Rosie in her cot. He was quiet for so long that Sherlock almost started to speak again.
John sighed, "I think so, but not so much about last night…" he chewed on his lip thoughtfully. "Obviously, I’m a bit peeved that you left me out of the loop" Sherlock shifted uncomfortably beside him and he resisted the urge to reach for him, "But the phone call was out of your control…I didn’t realise at the time that…well…I knew something was off about it, not that your raving lunatic of a sister was putting you up to it-"
"I…saved you to the trouble of having an unnecessarily long conversation with my father" His voice was only slightly uncertain and John raised an eyebrow, scrutinising him before letting it slide with a shrug.
"Why would I be so clumsy? No. You didn't save him, you hurt him, just like you always do. Emotional context, Sherlock, you didn't see logic" Eurus seemed to be getting annoyed now, her voice terse and unforgiving.
He answered.
Sherlock nodded again, "Good. Take care of him though, he’s not as strong as he likes to think" he shouldered his blanket higher and began to walk in the direction of the luminous police tape.
"Cheeky little minx" John teased and kissed the laugh from Sherlock’s lips before he left to tend to his daughter.
Sherlock nodded stiffly and, no sooner than he had, the monotonous dial up sound of the phone, accompanied by Moriarty imitating the ticking of a clock, filled the cell. He could hear the ringtone John had given specifically to his contact through the tv speakers and watched as his friend stirred from his position on the sofa. He made no move to reach for his phone that continued to ring on the coffee table, instead he settled further into the pillows, holding his daughter closer.
Sherlock was sitting on the living room floor (now with his jacket on, but unbuttoned) with Rosie in front of him when John walked in. Between them was a colourful plastic box with different shaped holes in the top and Sherlock was directing Rosie in putting the right shape in the right hole, pointing at whichever one correlated with the shape she had in her hand. He seemed to be having little success as Rosie was more interested in trying to eat the shapes rather than slot them into their proper place, giggling whenever he hurriedly pulled the shape from her mouth only for her to carry on her persistent chewing and for the cycle to continue.
" He mouthed to Sherlock and the detective squinted back. John huffed, "
"She didn’t- you don’t think that-" Sherlock groaned in frustration and buried his face in his hands. John watched him patiently, waiting for him to find the words and knowing that this wasn’t exactly his forte. Hell, it was hardly his speciality either. "When I told you that I-…that I love you, I meant it," Sherlock said after a deep breath, "You told me to give you a reason to say it and I gave you one. It’s true." He was still avoiding John’s gaze and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees.
It wasn’t long before Regents Park was in sight and they passed through the wrought iron gates onto the worn path that snaked between stretches of half-dead grass. With the swift approach of spring, the once yellowing and dry grass was returning to its former green glory as it often was in the summer. Very few parents with their children had decided to have a picnic on such a cool day, but there were still a couple dotted across some of the grassy areas. Their children ran through the tiny gathering of trees not too far from where their parents had set up and they ducked and weaved in an attempt to hide from one another. A tiny dog that would probably barely reach halfway up John’s shins was skittering around the children, it’s excited yaps mingling with the high pitched giggles and squeals.
When he got back downstairs, John paused outside the kitchen, listening to Sherlock’s voice.
The evening passed in a blur of takeaway and baby toys. Rosie had woken up halfway through their meal and was settled in a circle of her toys. Sherlock and John alternated between being sprawled out on the sofa and sitting beside Rosie to play with her. It had gotten dark outside and the little girl had yet to show signs of sleepiness, seemingly content to play way past her normal bedtime despite both her father and godfather fighting sleep.
“Bring him back” Sherlock sneered, anger bubbling under his skin and singing through his veins like poison, “Call him back! I won, I did what you said and saved him, you have to let me speak to him” his voice had risen and he spun on his heel to pace the length of the room in an attempt to diffuse some of the pent-up energy he’d built up.
"John..."
"She’s doing it on purpose, I swear," Sherlock said without looking away from his goddaughter. John chuckled and deposited Sherlock’s coat into his lap as he passed to pick Rosie up. She raised her arms to him but didn’t drop the shape she had been holding until John picked up the box and she clumsily shoved it into the right hole. Immediately she looked to Sherlock, who stared open-mouthed at the two of them, "You little minx!" He cried and now both Watsons were laughing.
John froze. He barely even blinked as he inhaled sharply, "Again....say it again..."
"Yeah, well…he had a proper cry while we were there, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him that upset before" John took another sip of his tea and grimaced when he found it to be cold. He opened his mouth to continue when they heard a thin, high pitched wail from upstairs. They both glanced at the door and made a move to get up to tend to Rosie when the gentle thump of feet crossed the landing upstairs and a low, soothing voice cooed to the whimpering baby. John looked over at Molly, who shared the same look of bemusement as Sherlock’s muffled voice carried over the tiny cries of John’s daughter.
"I've been waiting for this one" she said, her voice conveying her anticipation as she watched her brothers warily enter the room, "I feel it'll be the most....interesting, of all my tests"
Sherlock wandered out of the kitchen and into the living room while John went about making another two cups of tea. He took extra care into making the drinks and he knew he was stalling, though did nothing remedy it. Once the drinks were finished, he carefully trailed into the living room and gently set the mugs on the coffee table.
Silence on the other end.
“You didn’t win, you lost” Eurus continued to jibe and Sherlock just wanted her to shut up, “Look what you did to him. He doesn’t even know you meant it; he thinks this was all some silly little experiment to play with his emotions”
John didn't hesitate or stop to think before kissing back, sinking a hand into the sea of dark curls atop Sherlock's head and pulling the detective closer.
They stood and stared at each other for a long moment, John looking like he couldn’t quite believe his eyes while Sherlock looked closer to a deer caught in headlights. However, John was the first to break from the stupor and darted towards his friend. Sherlock didn’t have time to react when John collided with his chest and the two of them toppled over into the long grass. John giggled a little hysterically into the fabric of Sherlock’s shirt before sitting upright and pulling a slightly dazed detective up with him, gripping him in a tight embrace.
Sherlock's hands were beginning to shake, he could see John's phone just within arms reach of the man but he wasn't moving. The panic was rising in Sherlock, growing from a wave to tsunami as he wrapped his arms around himself and prayed, possibly for the first time in his life, that John would pick up.
He dropped his hand and closed his eyes with a tired sigh, "I love you too...."
Sherlock straightened at that, staring at John with a perplexed expression, "But I said I was sorry" He said, his voice rising into a question as if he couldn’t quite remember if he actually had.
"Oh Christ, good luck with that. It’s Sherlock’s first all-nighter with her isn’t it?" Molly chuckled and John snuck a peek at a virtually unconscious Sherlock.
The bedroom was as they’d left it; the bed still unmade with the duvet folded to one side, the jumper Sherlock had borrowed folded on the pillow, the wardrobe door slightly ajar and John’s phone perched on the bedside table. The only difference was the cardboard box by the side of the bed Sherlock had slept in that night. Opening it revealed his pyjamas folded on top of his dressing gown that hid the rest of his clothes; enough to last at least two weeks. He smiled slightly and quickly changed into his pyjamas, hooking his dressing gown on the back of the door and relishing in the worn softness of his bedclothes.
"Should we go to a café?" John asked and Sherlock glanced down at his watch before nodding.
"Sherlock?" Molly brushed past John and he walked further into the house, slipping into the kitchen whilst Molly spoke in a soft tone to a marginally unresponsive Sherlock. John went about making tea, the motions a comforting routine he’d learned from a young age. While he waited for the teas to steep, he quickly headed upstairs to check on Rosie and, finding her sound asleep in her cot, poked his head into the living room.  Sherlock was leaned back in the sofa with Molly beside him, murmuring softly to him and rubbing one of his hands between her own. Lips twitching fondly, John ducked back into the kitchen and finished making the teas, taking a deep breath to calm his still racing heart before taking the tray of mugs into the living room.
The Woman came to mind first, what with her bold forwardness, flirty texts and general love for the thrill that Sherlock seemed to ignite into the world. Though, that was impossible; she was halfway across the world by now, doing only God knows what with her time. She was out of the question.
When they pulled away for air, John kissed Sherlock's nose and the duo laughed softly, blinking back more oncoming tears in favour of embracing each other and savouring this moment. This beautiful, broken moment that encapsulated their entire relationship up until this point.
His heart ached as he reread those three simple, yet somehow terrifying, words. The words he’s thought to himself when his eyes caught John’s own ocean blues from across the room. Words he whispered into darkness when he was alone and John was safely away and asleep. Words he could never bring himself to say, even if the moment felt right. They’d clog in his throat and jostle and jumble around into something entirely different by the time they’d reached his tongue and fell past his lips. If John felt any small amount of what Sherlock felt for him, then he would not wish to force his friend to say it as though it meant nothing.
John’s smile returned and he nodded, bounding up the stairs before it could grow any larger.
"Yeah, definitely" John replied, enjoying the warmth radiating from Sherlock standing behind him. He wanted to lean back into the detective’s chest but the uncertainty of their situation made him keep himself upright.
Sherlock swallowed hard, straightening his jacket and closing his eyes for a second to collect his thoughts. He had to do this. Had to.
This time when the phone began ringing again, John visibly sighed a shifted carefully so as not to disturb Rosie. He lifted his legs from the coffee table and rose to his feet and, for one horrible second, Sherlock thought he might leave to escape the incessant ringing. But John leaned down and picked up his phone, answering the call as he left to the room to put Rosie in her bed.
