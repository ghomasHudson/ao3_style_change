“We left on our own,” Claire points out.
Dean isn’t even looking at Benny. He’s watching Cas, eyes serious.
“I never said that.” Castiel shifts under him, and Dean immediately tenses, face tightening Castiel frowns, then moves again. This time, he feels the press of Dean’s erection against his thigh.
“And where is the fun in that, Rowena?” The leader claps a jovial hand on her shoulder, and Castiel notes the way she flinches at the touch. “Come along, you two. You look as though you could entertain us for the evening.”
Cas has no idea what drives Dean to do what he does.
Donna glances at him, eyes wide. “That’s a good example. But how do you know Sam, Agent?”
“Not that I mind looking after your place, really, but I can only offer vague platitudes to your neighbours so many times,” Balthazar continues. “That nice Mildred two doors down wants to know when you’ll be back. Says she misses seeing you in the elevators.”
“Did you send for this?” Sam frowned, cutting off his impassioned speech. “Dean, you can’t just bring attendants in here. If she saw Prince Castiel, if she recognized him--”
He can see the desire to protest in their eyes, particularly Sam’s, but eventually they both nod. “We will await you here,” Rowena replies. “Go with my blessings, Emmanuel.”
She shakes her head. “
Charlie immediately leaned forward. “We ought to reintroduce the tournaments,” she suggested eagerly.
“Very fair.” Castiel gave an approving nod and lowered himself into the chair Dean pulled out for him. “Who are we to expect at this particular meeting? Anyone to be wary of?”
Nodding slowly, Dean tilted his face up in clear invitation, eyes fluttering closed. Leaning forward, Castiel dropped a soft kiss on his forehead, relishing the soft sigh that escaped Dean’s lips. He kissed each closed eyelid, both cheeks, and then finally, their lips met.
Dean lets out a bark of laughter. “Tough luck, man. I promise you, though, by the end of this thing, you’ll be charming your way into free milkshakes just like me.” He reaches out and taps his finger lightly against the tip of Cas’ nose. “Your time will come, my shy but devastatingly handsome friend.”
Cas doesn’t rise to the bait. “Can anyone verify your whereabouts that night?”
“Nor did I to you,” Castiel replied gravely. “I would shake your hand, but--”
“The old king loved archery. He used to organize yearly competitions and reward the victors richly, but those who were less successful were humiliated and ridiculed for their loss.” Castiel shakes his head, lips pressed tightly together. “Obviously, archery is much less frequently practiced in Dysland these days.” He sighs, and for a moment his eyes look so sad Dean almost reaches out to lay a hand on his shoulder in comfort. “Jack loves it, though he’s aware of the associations most of his people have with it.” Looking over at Dean, he inclines his head. “Thank you for this. It’s good to see him so happy.”
Rowena gives Castiel a sidelong look, as though gauging the likelihood of his lashing out again. “We will reach it soon.”
Milton gave a strangled laugh, covering his face with his hands. “That is what I meant to say from the beginning,” he admitted, words muffled. “I came all this way, rehearsing a speech in my mind, hoping you might feel the same, and now”-- he lifted his hands away from his face, revealing a hopeless expression-- “I’ve only alienated you further.”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel leaned down to kiss him. “You make a compelling argument. Very well, we shall do this properly.”
. My old buddy Garth is a werewolf, Kaia at the bakery is a dreamwalker, my best friend Charlie is an enchantress-- the list goes on.”
“Yes. Fuck my mouth.”
“I miss you so much.” There’s a great deal of noise in the background. It sounds like Dean is at a bar, or maybe at a party he’s working. “I shouldn’t have called. I’m sorry. I just really wanted to hear your voice.”
This time, when he walks away, he doesn’t look back.
Castiel waited patiently until Dean caught his breath, then rose to his feet, stripping off the gloves. “I’ll have to ask the tailors to make more of these,” he mused. “Perhaps in other colours.” He glanced down at Dean, who had stretched himself out full-length in front of the fire, his lower body shamelessly naked and a look of supreme satisfaction on his face. “Red, I think. Sapphire blue as well.”
“No,” Castiel agrees, leaning into the touch. “In this, we have always been right to trust.”
“Thank you.” Cas follows him into the house and shuts the door behind him. “How have you been?”
“Yes.” Castiel smirked down at him, shifting his hips forward so Dean could feel his erection pressing into his torso. “It is.”
“A fair question,” Dean replied. “But not, I think, one which I am qualified to answer.”
It was an uncomfortable look at what might lie ahead.
“But now you’re telling me, because you think a suspicious truth is more convincing than a suspicious lie?” Cas’ head hurts. He’s not really an FBI agent, he’s just playing one, and he’d really prefer if they could skip ahead to the part where he tracks and kills the monster instead of this endless interrogation. He thought he was long past having to patiently guide people through confessing their darkest secrets.
He pulled his phone out of his pocket, opened the photo from Sam, and passed it to Castiel. “Recognize this guy?”
Dean punches his brother in the arm, though there’s no real force behind it. “I am not a hooker.”
Castiel swallows around the lump that has risen in his throat. He didn’t think he needed to hear that kind of praise, especially not from Dean, but he can’t deny how good it feels. “So are you,” he whispers. He reaches up and lays his palm flat over Dean’s tattoo. “You’re beautiful, Dean. Inside and out.”
“I’m so sorry,” Cas repeats. He looks down at the table, embarrassment heating his face. He didn’t mean to imply anything other than partnership in a teammate sense, but knowing how careful Dean has to be to negotiate the boundaries of whatever this is between them, it’s hard to imagine a more awkward thing to say.
He’s allowed to have this. They both are. After dancing around each other for seven years, Dean isn’t going to waste another second of their time together.
They collapsed onto the bed together, limbs entwining naturally as their kisses deepened. Castiel surrendered himself to the feeling of Dean’s hands running up and down his back, occasionally darting lower to cup his backside before teasingly moving away. Over the past two weeks, Castiel had learned a great deal about what brought Dean pleasure, and a surprising amount about his own.
“I thought you would be older,” Castiel said frankly.
Cas reaches out and wraps an arm around Jimmy’s shoulders. They seem narrower than usual, a new frailty about him. “She knew,” he says quietly. “How could she not know? You lit up every time she came into the room, every time you heard her name. And she loved you just as much.” He pauses, shaking his head. “No one expected the two of you to make it work. Even Mom and Dad thought you were just getting married because of Claire, and that you’d drift apart eventually. But I knew, because I know you, Jimmy. Yours was the kind of love we all dream of.”
He wants company, but with Balthazar gone, there’s no one to provide it.
Something he needs to figure out, even if only for his own peace of mind.
“If the darkness came from here, it must be kept here, somehow.” Rowena looks around the library and gives a small shrug. “We must find it, before we can fight it.” She looks at Sam, considering. “You are best placed to find out. Ask your brother, ask your father if you can. Surely they must have noticed it. Surely they must know something.”
He’s about to turn away when he feels a warm hand close over his elbow. Castiel tugs him forward into a kiss, then pulls away to whisper, “See you at the ball.”
He didn’t have to consider his reply at all. “Years.”
Rowena was clad in a robe of pure gold cloth that shimmered in the sunlight that spilled into the temple’s central courtyard. Her bright red hair mimicked the colour of the flames as she lit the pile of wood beneath John’s body, relinquishing it to the fire. “The warmth of the sun sustains us in life,” she said, her voice ringing out through the open air. “But in death, it is to the fire that we turn, to burn away the flesh while igniting the memory of the spirit inside it.” She gazed out towards the crowd, and her eyes met Dean’s. “King John burned brightly in life, and brightly he will burn now. In the pain of his passing, may we find comfort in the knowledge that he will never truly leave us, just as the warmth from the fire lingers long after the flames have been extinguished.”
“I have my moments,” Castiel said. He brushed a light kiss across Dean’s lips and reached down to take his hand. “Let’s go get cleaned up.”
It would have been the perfect moment for Dean to step forward and take his hand. But they could not. So instead, Dean and Castiel turned to face one another and bowed deeply, the most respectful courtesy one could make. When they rose again, Dean looked into Castiel’s eyes and saw the same hesitation, the same apprehension, and the same thrilling excitement that he felt reflected in those blue depths.
He’s been asking persistently since then, but Castiel has remained close-lipped on the subject. Maybe now that he’s been kissed into a good mood--
Cas breathes a sigh of relief as they pull apart and Claire tugs Kaia forward. Jimmy has a hug for her too, his tall frame making her look even slighter in comparison. Cas smiles at all three of them as they pile into the car, Jimmy in the passenger seat and the girls in the back. “It couldn’t have been that great of a party if you were sitting outside,” he comments.
Dean gasped with pleasure, reaching up to grip Castiel’s arm. He dug his nails into his straining bicep as Castiel slowly withdrew his finger, then slid it forward again, watching his face all the while.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel turned to him, expectant, and Dean’s words died on his lips. He could not do this. He could not impose his feelings on Castiel, not when so much hung in the balance.
With a last dip of his head, he turned away and left the bakery, not stopping to look back. Dean gazed after him, mind racing, until he heard a giggle from behind him and turned to see Kevin, Krissy, and Kaia all watching him with identical grins on their faces.
Mary turned to him, eyes wide. “Dean, what in the world--”
Whether it’s the teasing words or the old childhood nickname, something flickers in Jimmy’s eyes, a spark of animation Cas had thought permanently extinguished. He pulls the covers down, revealing his sunken cheeks and week’s worth of stubble, his lips curling into a frown as he does.
Dean shakes his head, then sucks in a startled breath as Castiel reaches out and lays a hand on his arm. “I thought of how brave you were, coming here after all this time, and it gave me the strength I needed to confront her.”
He hadn’t really thought past this, but having Dean beneath him, pliant and trusting, provided him with a wild array of dazzling possibilities. He wasn’t the only one involved here, though.
It might even have been growing right where they camped that first night. Dean could have saved himself all this trouble, and never had the terrifying experience of almost being a hawk snack. Darting up a nearby tree, he scours the surrounding area, tail pointing straight up like a banner. He can distantly hear Castiel below, but his eyes catch on something off to the south, and he scrambles back down to investigate further.
Cas doesn’t hesitate to obey. He reaches between them and wraps his hand around Dean’s length, feeling him hiss with pleasure as he does. Dean is warm and heavy in his hand, his hips already moving as he thrusts forward into Cas’ grip.
“We?” She frowns. “Who’s we?”
“I just don’t want everyone walking on eggshells around me, you know, and--”
“With some hard work, a great deal of patience, and a not-insignificant amount of blind faith,” Dean replies. “And if you will have me still, I promise to offer you the same.”
There is a tense pause, during which Dean considers stepping forward, but then Naomi speaks again.
The tension leaves Benny’s shoulders as he looks back at Dean. “Yeah, brother. I do.”
Benny nods. “I do.”
This is not how it was meant to end. If there is to be no afterwards for them, it ought to have been because he was gone from this world, not Dean. Never Dean.
He wants to drift off, just like this, remembering the feeling of Dean’s fingertips brushing over his cheek.
“They likely would have come this way.” Castiel’s voice is pitched low, thoughtful. “They could have ridden further north or south to throw us off their trail, but if their main goal was to escape unnoticed, it would have wasted precious time. So if we assume they rode straight west along the road, but then left it at the edge of the forest like we did--”
Dean glances sidelong at Castiel, soft and fond. “We have. I didn’t even realize just how close until recently.”
Interesting. Sam had admitted that he and Dean don’t speak frequently, and yet he felt it necessary to warn his brother that Cas had paid him a visit.
Castiel angles his body ever so slightly, allowing Dean space to adjust his own position so he can see the dais. “Thank you,” Dean says with as much insincerity as he can manage, because Castiel might be an asshole but Dean’s mother raised him to be polite no matter what. Besides, he knows it winds Castiel up when Dean’s words and tone are so at odds with one another.
“Night, Cas.” Reluctantly, Dean steps back, leaning against Baby’s hood and grounding himself in her familiar presence. He raises one hand to wave as Cas steps through the glass door into the building’s lobby, and then he’s lost to sight.
“You are troubled.” Castiel started at the sound of the voice from the dark corner of the sanctuary. A shadowy form emerged, and he breathed a sigh of relief as he recognized Billie. “May I assist you, my king?”
He trailed off, searching for the right words. Jody leaned forward and laid a hand on his arm. “Like that, was it?” A soft smile stole over her face. “Just like your mother and I.”
He caught Mr. Lafitte’s eye and gave him an approving nod. “I look forward to seeing you at Rexford,” he said.
Balthazar’s head lolled to the side, but there was a trace of his usual mischief in his eyes as he answered, “Ancient.”
He doesn’t know how much time has passed, but his eyes are dry by the time the door creaks slowly open. Raising his head, he looks up to see Dean hovering in the doorway, a lantern clutched in one hand.
The geography of their land had always been simple: Calorna to the south, Hiemere to the north, and the mountains between them. There was nothing else. There was only the one pass through the mountains, the rest of the peaks impossible to negotiate. But this new information suggested that there might be something else there, a chance to finally venture beyond that one pass. It was both thrilling and disturbing to consider.
Dean reached out and brushed the tip of one finger across Castiel’s thumb.
“I do,” Cas agrees. “You’re well-known for not leaving your home often, Mr. Winchester. I should be flattered, I suppose, that you thought it important enough to drop by tonight.”
It all makes a terrible amount of sense. Cas shakes his head, not in disbelief but in wonder. “You took your pain and used it to help others. Dean, that’s remarkable.” He pauses, unsure how his words will be received, but then figures he may as well attempt to give back some of what Dean has given him. “In addition to being unfairly good-looking, you’re also charming, kind, endearingly goofy, and fiercely protective. Anyone who ever made you feel otherwise deserves to be thrown into a shark tank.”
There’s a weighty pause, and Cas knows Charlie is mentally calculating the distance between Minneapolis and Lebanon, wondering how he’s so close already. “Okay,” she says, the new softness in her tone confirming his suspicions. “We’ll see you soon.”
By the time the sun begins to peek over the horizon, his nerves have settled and his hands have loosened their grip on the steering wheel. He pulls into a gas station and fills the truck’s tank, exchanging a nod with the woman doing the same at the other pump. The coffee he buys inside the station is terrible, but at least it’s hot. It will keep him awake long enough to make it to the bunker, and then someone will take pity on him and make him a pot of the good stuff from Ellen’s stash.
“But you don’t want to use them.” Castiel’s voice is neutral.
Castiel wakes from troubled dreams, hearing the king’s heavy tread as he climbs the tower. Every morning, he considers following after him, and every morning, his courage fails him. He waits alone in his rooms until he can be sure the others have finished eating before descending to the kitchen, where breakfast is always left waiting for him. If he pauses at the door of the library on his way down, he sees Sam and Rowena poring over enormous stacks of books, voices low as they discuss things Castiel does not understand.
He looked up at the soft sound of Castiel’s footsteps. “Hey,” he said. “Is she--”
“I’m going to talk to the family later,” he says. “I need to know what Ryan was doing here.”
Judging by the shaky smile she offered, she did. “I could use a shower.”
Jody brings him to a table tucked into the corner and places a steaming plate before him. “You’ve earned it,” she says with a small smile. “I should know to trust Donna’s instincts by now.”
Dean’s grip tightens for a moment before relaxing again. “I would not wish that upon anyone.”
Dean is pleased to find that his irritation from the night before has faded. He has no doubt it will make a return appearance today, for some reason or another, but it’s good to start the day with a blank slate. He climbs to his feet and stretches his arms above his head, rolling his neck from side to side with a satisfying crack. By the time he’s done, Castiel is staring off into the trees as if bored with Dean’s display of discomfort after a night sleeping on hard, rough ground.
“I’m not--” Cas starts to protest, but Balthazar holds up a hand to stop him.
“Wretch,” Castiel murmured, grabbing Dean’s face and pulling him back into a deep, luxurious kiss.
He dreams of his forest, the familiar trees and the creatures that live among them. He wanders its paths, breathing in the fresh air, and trails his hands over the trunks of trees he has watched grow into the giants they now are. A squirrel chatters as it races through the branches and he laughs, stretching his hands up towards it, but it is already gone.
He looked so earnest, standing tall and proud in his simple garb, an expression of pure concern on his face. Castiel almost wished there was some simple request he could make, just to satisfy him. “No,” he said slowly. “Your visit has been comfort enough.”
A warm feeling spread through Castiel, knowing that Anna considered Rexford a place of safety and refuge. “I’m glad you came here,” he said softly. “To me.”
The poor child. Dean understands that fear all too well. He drops to his knees in front of Aliette and opens his arms to her, knowing gestures can speak just as loudly as words, if not more so. She does not hesitate before throwing herself into his embrace, pressing her face against his shoulder. “I’m sorry,” he says. “We should have told you we were going for a walk.”
They didn’t break up. There was nothing mutual about it. Cas was the one who made that call, and Dean wishes he could hate him for it, wishes he could be righteously furious like he’s been after some other break-ups in his past.
He didn’t pull or tug on Castiel’s hair, just wrapped his hands through its strands, fingers moving slightly in a sort of massage like he couldn’t possibly accept this without giving something in return. Encouraged, Castiel looked up at him from under lowered lashes as he took Dean as deep into his mouth as he could manage, which was admittedly quite deep. Dean’s hands tightened for a brief second before easing again, his lower lip caught between his teeth as he stared down at Castiel with a fierce combination of hunger and awe in his eyes.
Dean nearly drops the letter in his surprise. Michael had a daughter-- which means Castiel has a niece. A blood relation he never knew existed until this morning. To a man who has long been deprived of a family of blood though rich in one of bond, it must seem a miracle.
“Right,” Dean says gruffly. He never thought he’d seen Jack unhappy, but maybe there’s more beneath that cheerful exterior than Dean realized. “Of course.”
“It is if I’m going to have to go out there and rescue you,” Dean snaps. “Again.”
Dean moans as he wraps his legs around Castiel’s waist. He moves slowly, deliberately, controlled as ever, as though his single goal is to make Dean fall apart completely beneath him. Dean has been dreaming about this for years, but he’d never imagined it could feel this good. He wonders distantly what it would have been like, if Castiel had accepted his invitation all those years ago-- the sex would have been great, he’s sure, but without all the tangled history between them, it could never compare to this.
For the first time, he sees a hint of disapproval on Castiel’s face. “Surely you had a duty to your family as well.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas draws back to look into his eyes. He shouldn’t. He should be leaving for the bunker even now. It will only make it hurt more when he does leave. No. It will hurt either way. They’ve both been stripped bare in each other’s presence, in this place, and there’s no sense denying either of them what they want. They’ve both done enough of that.
After a few minutes of agonizing indecision, ignoring Balthazar’s more outrageous suggestions, Cas settles on a short, simple introduction. There’s no sense trying to establish a genuine connection. That isn’t what this is about.
Castiel could understand his disbelief. It did sound rather ridiculous, put so bluntly. “It is,” he said. “Not the way you might imagine it, with pistols at dawn. A vampire duel is a very different matter.”
“Righteous. Well, Cas, and whoever you are, here’s your prize.” Ash hands them the envelope with a flourish. “Twenty-five dollar gift card to this fine establishment. Use it tonight, or come back and join us another time.”
He straightens to his full height and attempts an expression of remorse. “I do not believe that would be wise, my lord,” he says, and before Dean can reply, he slips inside the chamber and closes the door behind him.
Mary raises an expectant eyebrow, but Naomi’s mouth tightens, and Castiel’s nerve fails him. Dean squares his shoulders and meet his mother’s gaze, his voice only trembling slightly on his next words. “We are in love.”
He leaves his cell on his desk, volume turned all the way up, but Cas doesn’t call back.
Some undefined emotion lodges uncomfortably in Castiel’s throat, and he clears it roughly. “Show me somewhere else?” he asks, and the way Dean’s shoulders relax proves it was the correct response.
“How fitting,” Castiel said. “I’ve been looking for you too.”
It’s a sensible plan, splitting them up, but Dean doesn’t know why Castiel has decided he needs to be out in front. For once in his life, though, he doesn’t argue. From the rear, he can observe Jack and Claire more carefully.
Chittering rapidly, he darts back towards the towering figure he now recognizes as Castiel. At least his human memories and instincts are still present, even if he can’t seem to communicate. He’s fairly certain Castiel is clever enough to make the connection between Dean’s disappearance and the extremely vocal rodent charging towards his boots.
“I’m sorry it took so long.” Cas takes a deep breath. “I know I have no right to ask you for anything, Dean, but I hate having this conversation over the phone. Will you come over? I’d like to make you dinner, and we can...talk.”
Sam and Kevin exchanged a long, wordless glance. “Very well,” Sam said. He gave Castiel a critical look, taking in the sweat-stained furs and heavy fabrics he wore. One corner of his mouth quirked up, revealing a good nature hidden behind his previous detachment. “But first, I think you may wish to freshen up.”
“What?” Dean leans across the table, eyes alight. “Who?”
Laughing, Dean kissed him again. “You leaving was the main reason I came back tonight. Not  just because I wanted to pick up where we left off, but because I knew it had to be a big deal. And I liked you better for dropping everything to help your friend.”
His words hit Castiel like a blow to the back, and all his worry turns to icy anger. He rises slowly and turns to face Dean, his dirty hands clenched into tight fists. “If you wanted to be waited upon,” he says, “perhaps you ought to have stayed in the palace.”
Heat rises in Cas’ cheeks, but he shrugs. “Something like that.” Winking, he heads up the stairs to Dean’s apartment, finding it unlocked as promised.
“Which only goes to show how deep your kindness runs, that it felt completely ordinary to you and so special to me.” Castiel continues to stare upwards, not meeting Dean’s gaze. “I couldn’t make sense of it. I couldn’t place it in a neat box, because it didn’t fit with the way I made myself see you, or with the way we interacted most of the time. And now, this week--” Finally, he glances over at Dean, eyes bright. “I was still trying to keep my walls up at first, but you have a way of sneaking past them. I did come to understand how complicated you are, when I’d always seen you as a generally simple person because that’s how you presented yourself. And I’m so sorry, Dean, for what I said to you that night. I didn’t know about your father, about how torn you were between your family here in the north and his legacy at the palace. I never should have said those things to you.”
Castiel gives a subtle shake of his head as he passes her a glass of wine. “Please, Anna. Don’t ask me any questions.”
“But I’m alone,” Mary finished quietly. “Oh, Dean.”
“On the subject of cunning--” Castiel twisted in his saddle to examine the faces of the riders behind them. “The Chief Strategist did not accompany you?”
Dean frowned, surprised at Benny’s line of questioning. “You’re not--” He hesitated, spreading his hands helplessly before him. “Benny, I’m sorry.”
He waits until Cas has set his beer back down before raising his own glass. “To trying new things?” he says.
It was only due to his nearness that Dean caught the first sign of impending victory: the gradual lowering of Marv’s back leg. Inhaling sharply, he looked up at Castiel’s face. It was tinged grey with exhaustion, but his eyes burned bright, his jaw fierce. He had one arm bent behind his back, a position that must have been horribly uncomfortable, but his feet were planted squarely and his legs were steady.
“It is.” Castiel helped himself to some bacon and eggs before pulling out a chair opposite Winchester. “If any of the others wake in time, I’m sure they would enjoy it as well.”
Castiel laughed. “And a new level of awareness of my responsibilities to those I care for,” he added. “Lord Winchester’s family is lovely, are they not? I was so pleased to see you all at ease with one another at the ball.”
He said as much to Anna one grey and drizzly morning. “How do you breathe here?” he asked, looking out the window. “The rain will clear the air, I suppose, but it’s never truly fresh.”
As far as cover stories go, it isn’t the worst Cas has heard. “Thank you,” he says again.
Pressing another firm kiss to his lips, Castiel reached across the bed and into the nightstand beside them. Dean’s eyes followed his movements, curious, and he let out a small sound as he saw Castiel close his hand around a tube of lubricant. Dean immediately shifted on the bed, legs opening, but Castiel smiled down at him and shook his head. “Not tonight.”
“And now you wish to see them serve in the temple instead?” he asked, raising one eyebrow at her.
“I’d want to know.” Dean pulls his hands back out his pocket, flexing them at his sides. He lowers his voice to match Cas’. “Tell me.”
“Thank you,” Cas says, and follows her into the house.
A slow flush crept over Castiel’s cheeks. “Yes.”
“I do respect you,” he says. “All of you. I’m grateful to you for taking me in, for teaching me everything I know. And you’re right, sometimes I can be reckless. It’s part of the job description. But I’m not going to stop going on hunts alone. If that bothers you, I suggest you ask me to leave now.”
At that, Charlie grinned. “Would you have it any other way?”
“You have a good team in there,” Cas comments as Donna leads them to her truck.
Dean lets out a low whistle as he guides the Impala into a parking spot. “Very nice,” he says. “It’s not going to be weird, all your co-workers seeing you here on a date?”
He refuses to say any more on the subject, though, instead going through their usual nighttime ritual of escorting Castiel to his rooms before turning back to his own humbler bed. Castiel watches from his doorway as Dean descends the stairs, the light from the torch he carries slowly fading as he rounds the corners of the twisting staircase. Unsettled for reasons he cannot explain, Castiel climbs into bed and is quick to fall asleep, tired from the long day.
Cas lets him go.
“Dean, I really don’t think--” Cas protests, but Dean has already slung his arm over his shoulders and pointed the phone towards them.
“No.” Sam came to join him, tipping his head back against the wall. “But I sense you’re about to remind me.”
Crossing the room, he extended a gallant hand to Mrs. Hanscum and pulled her to her feet, then leaned in to whisper something in her ear. A broad smile stretched across her face as he led her to stand at the pianoforte before bending to say something to Miss Turner. She let out a sharp laugh and nodded enthusiastically.
“You’re very persistent. I’m flattered.” Castiel smiled, but there was something bitter in it. “If we continue down this path, I’m sure you’ll meet plenty of other vampires who will be more than willing to satisfy your thwarted desire.”
Dean arches his lower body upwards in response, rubbing himself against Cas’ erection. He’s big even for an Alpha, and as much as Dean is enjoying the opening act, he’s more than ready for the main event.
Benny’s lips tightened, but he took the proffered arm and shot Dean a warning glance over his shoulder. Dean bit back the harsh reply that had been forming on his lips and fumed silently as Benny and Silverton exited the church, the well-wishers outside breaking into a chorus of congratulatory shouts.
“Do you, uh”-- he waves a hand at the bed-- “have a side you prefer?”
He touches his lips to the back of Castiel’s hand, and in that moment, everything changes.
“No,” Castiel told him gently. “He does not. He does not even have your best interests at heart, Gadreel. He is thinking only of our kind, but Lawrence is home to other forces as well.” He nodded at their surroundings. “The King of Hell has a special residence here. Do you think the demons will simply accept an ambitious vampire establishing himself as a lord here? And the police force-- they’re well-trained and well-prepared. They know who you are, Gadreel. If Marv needs a sacrificial offering, a scapegoat, where do you think he will look?”
He extends one hand and shakes Cas’, barely looking at his badge. “Sorry about all this,” he laughs, gesturing to his clothing. “I wasn’t expecting company.”
“I liked Billie,” Castiel replied mildly. “And Dean says she makes Mary happy.”
Farmers, for the most part. Labourers and artisans, perhaps a few merchants. The type of folk who travel widely, meaning they may have heard other whispers concerning angels. With that in mind, Castiel begins.
He had no weapons, his head throbbed with pain, and one leg was injured. Castiel had been accused of being many things in his life, but never unintelligent. He did as instructed, and the door slowly opened.
“You don’t need to thank me,” Dean told him, turning away, embarrassed at his own passionate declaration. “It’s just common decency.”
“You did,” Cas informs him. “It was perfect.”
Dean rose to his feet, the idea solidifying in his mind. “You’ve already announced it informally. We make the proper announcement, but say we wish to hold the wedding later for”-- he waved one hand in the air-- “whatever reason. Family travel, more time to plan, our shared desire not to steal the attention from our recently married friends.”
Castiel is good, there’s no doubt about it. He might even be better than Dean, though they’ve never tested their skills against one another. He’s both precise and graceful in his movements, making even the most complicated footwork look as easy as taking a single step forward.
“The king,” Rowena whispers, eyes wide. “But how--”
“We’re getting married,” Dean whispers. Despite the fact that they have been engaged for over a year, it has never felt as real as it does this morning. “After all this time-- Castiel, we’re getting married.”
Dean exhaled slowly, staring into the calm surface of the lake. “Well,” he said.
If he makes an incredibly undignified scramble to grab his phone the instant it lights up, well, there’s no around to witness it.
But the town already has been disturbed by Ryan Garland’s death. That’s why Cas is here, after all.
The locker room is empty.
“We must make an early start of it.” Rolling onto his side, Dean met Castiel’s smug look with a grin of his own. “Oh, very well.”
He reaches under the table and takes hold of Cas’ hand. “How about you?” He leans in closer so he won’t be overheard, and Cas shivers as his warm breath ghosts over his ear. “Are you good?”
“No,” Winchester admitted. “It still feels too grand for me, at times. Too unfamiliar. I’ve held the title for years now, and I’ve grown accustomed to much of what comes with it, but Lawrence Hall is the last step.”
In the five minutes he’d been gone, Castiel had slid onto the stool recently occupied by the winking blonde.
He closes his eyes as he takes the first sip, relishing the cold burst of liquid against his tongue. Christ, what a day. Registering someone coming to stand beside him, he opens his eyes to meet the sheepish smile of his coffee provider.
“Go,” he yelled, pushing Kaia forward. “Get them out of here.”
“Traffic,” Mary replied, reaching out to snag a can of beer. “Not everyone drives the way you do, honey.”
Rowena clasps her arms tightly around her middle, a distant sorrow in her eyes. “Perhaps, in the end, he remembered that he loved you.” Her eyes slide to Sam, and she offers a small shrug. “Both of you.”
Things move quickly after that. The guards assemble, the queen emerges from the castle with Billie and Rowena at her side, and though her voice trembles, she stands tall as she delivers the news. “I am asking every one of you, not as a queen but as a mother, to bring my daughter home,” she concludes. “I leave the organization of the search parties in the hands of the Royal Protector.” She glances at Dean and gives him a small nod. “Let it also be known that neither his competence nor his loyalty are in any way in doubt.”
“So there would be no broken hearts, nor broken word, if you were to end it?”
Castiel pulls his hand back as though he’s been scalded and clears his throat, taking a careful step away. “Tell me about the people who lived here,” he says. He hopes it will not be too painful a subject, but he needs something else to focus on, something other than the solidity of Dean’s body under his palm, the welcome warmth of him beneath the softness of his shirt.
Castiel slowly turned his back to the harsh light and opened his eyes again, taking in the room around him. The stone was soft gold in hue and warm to the touch. The floor was made of wood of a similar shade, making it feel as though he was enclosed in a drop of pure sunlight. There was a narrow door at the opposite end of the room, with a barred window set at eye-level. He crossed towards it, pressing his face against the bars and craning his neck in an attempt to see out.
Dean makes a helpless gesture, spreading his hands before himself. His lips are dry with nerves, fearful of what Castiel will say. His husband holds his gaze, those beloved blue eyes steady, and then turns back to Naomi.
Dean can’t help it. He laughs, pressing his face into the silky fur on the top of the puppy’s head. It’s damn cute, he has to admit.
He offers his arm to Rowena, and she takes it with the grand manners of one accustomed to such courtesies. They pass through the door, leaving Dean and Castiel alone.
“Thank you,” he said to her, then lowered his voice as though confiding a secret. “I do not wish to make your work more difficult, but there is one matter I must discuss with you.”
She headed in the direction of the kitchen, leaving Dean and Castiel alone in the wreck of the living room. Dean hobbled over to the couch and dropped heavily onto it with a deep exhale, trying to find a position that didn’t make his ribs hurt even more than they already did.
He had waited long enough. He would not torment either of them any more.
He felt Dean come to stand beside him, heard the muffled curse he let out. “I’m sorry,” Dean murmured, but Castiel barely heard him.
Looking down, Cas stirs the last of his milkshake with his straw. In some ways, it’s the simplest question in the world, and in others, it’s more complicated than he can possibly wrap his head around.
His barb strikes home. Castiel’s garden is his pride and his joy, and to hear Dean dismiss it so easily hurts far more than he would care to admit. Head held high, he brushes past Dean and makes his way back to the well, his efforts to find his ring abandoned. Right now, it would only mock him, their promises to each other so distant, remnants of another life entirely.
Sam made a sympathetic face. “That sucks. I hoped you guys could have stayed friends.”
“I’ll tell you.” Castiel smiles, meeting his eyes. “I know, Dean.”
“You know I cannot let you pass,” Castiel said grimly. Protective barrier or not, he was the first line of defense, and he would not falter.
Dean glanced at Castiel, who nodded. It was time to show their full hand.
“Yes.” Cas shakes his head, eyes clearing. “That’s quite the hidden talent. But really, Dean, dancing is basically sex anyway, so I’m not sure you’re really branching out there.”
Dean took a deep breath, then let it out in a noisy exhale. “Have you heard about anything weird going on with the vampires lately?”
“That’s different.” Castiel glares at him. “It’s private, it’s personal. It’s not information that could affect the mission.”
“If it was a wild animal that killed Ryan,” he says, “you should be careful out here all by yourself.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Donna.”
Castiel leans back, breaking the kiss, and meets Dean’s eyes briefly before moving to trail his lips over his cheek and down the curve of his neck. Dean shudders, eyes fluttering closed, and Castiel smiles into the soft skin behind his ear. It’s satisfying, knowing Dean is enjoying this as well, that he’s getting something out of the experience just as Castiel is.
“It is not your fault.” Sam’s voice is quiet but vehement. “It is his. Always, it is his.”
Dean grins easily at him, shrugging. “It’s all just in fun,” he replies. “No promises made, no hearts bruised.”
Milton frowned. “Well, yes. That is what tends to follow a betrothal.”
“Change is never easy,” Cas says with a wry smile. He raises his hand and wipes away the last traces of Dean’s tears. “It was a part of you. There’s no shame in grieving its loss.”
“It is,” Castiel insists. “It is a gilded cage, one I long to lose myself in. Today, I hardly spared a thought for my brothers and sisters and whatever end they met. All I could think about was Dean, his smile and his voice and his steadfast loyalty to a father who shows him none of the love he deserves. I have a purpose here, a mission. I did not come here to be caught in the snare of Dean’s affection. It will only distract me from what must be done.”
“Oh.” A warm feeling settles in Dean’s chest, knowing Castiel wants this as much as he does. “Clever of you.”
Castiel toyed with the hem of Dean’s shirt, a silent question in his eyes. Dean nodded, and torturously slow, Castiel pulled it up over his head and tossed it carelessly aside.
For a brief moment, he thought he saw something change in those blue eyes, so close to his own. It was as if a curtain had been drawn back, and the spark of intelligence and warmth had returned to them before vanishing again. But it was enough, enough to give Dean the strength to make one last attempt as he struggled in Void’s hold.
The creak from the trapdoor warns him just in time, and Castiel whirls to face the emerging figure. His foolish heart leaps in his chest, wondering if Dean has followed him here, but as the starlight reflects off the silver strands in the figure’s hair and beard, his joy is quickly extinguished.
Castiel supposes he ought to express some gratitude in this moment. “Thank you,” he says, the words stiff and unfamiliar. An angel thanking a human, what a novel thing. He casts a sidelong look at Sam, noting the set of his shoulders and the shadows behind his eyes, and softens his voice. “And I am sorry. About your mother.”
Sam sighed, taking off his glasses to rub his eyes. “There was a bit of a scuffle earlier today. One of the regulars threw a fit because we ran out of O-Negative, complaining that she should get her choice since she pays for it, unlike the ones on the subsidized program. The volunteers were understandably freaked out, so they called us in.” He grimaced. “It was-- unpleasant, to say the least.”
She lifts a hand to quiet the excited noises from the crowd. “Castiel’s great-grandfather was our dearly respected King Cain, who fathered a child before his marriage to Queen Susan.” Her voice turns steely, and Dean grins to himself at the fierce look on her face. “If any among you have doubts as to his lineage, I suggest you look closely at him, and at the portrait of my father that hangs in this hall.”
Castiel opens his mouth to protest, to say they are not his friends, then closes it again. He does not feel he has done much to deserve that title in relation to them, but Donna and Jody certainly greeted him as an old friend. He ought not diminish the generosity of their spirit by claiming otherwise.
Truly, it was so absurd as to be almost comical. And yet Dean was not laughing. Grumbling to himself, he stepped into the bath, the cool water a relief on his heated flesh.
Castiel shook his head, some instinct telling him this was not the way forward. “Dean,” he said slowly. “Do you remember what I-- what Void-- said? About Plenty being selfish?”
But he already did. The longer he looks at Dean now, the more he lets himself adjust his memories of that night at the restaurant in light of this new information, the more that voice fades. In spite of his own insecurities, he knows: there’s something solid here, and he would be a fool to let it slip through his fingers.
A sick feeling rises in Castiel’s stomach. He glances at Dean, whose eyes are slightly narrowed as he looks at his mother. Castiel reaches out to him, but Dean just straightens his back, clicking his heels together and striding jauntily towards the center of the room and making a low bow in Anna’s direction.
Neither of them moves.
Pulling out his phone, Dean is slightly disappointed to see he has no new messages. Sam’s out of town for a conference, and while Dean has been enjoying the steady stream of updates about the talks and the other attendees, he does miss having his brother around.
, the French. It was the only death Castiel would encourage them towards. “Now, Dean.”
Dean takes it, tucking the knife into his waistband as he does. The messenger’s eyes follow his movement, and she takes a slight step back, swallowing visibly. Dean spares a moment to offer her an apologetic grimace before tearing open the scroll and beginning to read.
“We did.” Hannah gives him a gentle smile. “We went out for coffee afterwards. Decaf for me. I have an early shift at the hospital tomorrow.”
“Mmn?” Cas lifts his head to look up at him, tilting it to the side in that familiar, endearing way. “Yeah?”
“White for the shirt,” Donna explained. “With silver embroidery to match the buttons on the boots. Black leather for the gloves.” She looked down at Castiel’s hand, examining the ring he wore there. “And if I can find such a thing in the royal treasury, a silver and sapphire pendant of some sort, to match this.”
He follows Cas’ directions back into the city centre, turning the radio on low just to fill the silence. It’s comfortable, surprisingly-- Dean might have expected some awkwardness after that interrupted embrace, but Cas doesn’t seem bothered, his dark head tipped back against the headrest and his expression relaxed. The summer breeze blows in through the open windows, ruffling his hair and carrying the scent of flowers as they pass by a city park.
He supposed he could simply ask Dean. Confronting their issues had, after some initial twists and turns, worked out well for them the last time. He was unsure, however, if he had the courage to raise the matter. Unlike before, when they had been apart and miserable, they were now together and happy-- did he dare risk upsetting the wonderful new rapport between them?
Guilt crashes over Cas, an apology springing to his lips, but Balthazar cuts him off. “Stop that. I didn’t mean to say I’m tired of having you here. Quite the opposite, really.” He smiles, the crooked little quirk of his lips that Cas knows means he’s being sincere. “But you don’t go out to trivia anymore, and you refuse every time I invite you anywhere. You’re in danger of becoming a hermit, Cas, and I’ve left you to it because I thought it best, at first.” He reaches out and pokes Cas in the shoulder, earning him a startled yelp and a glare. “I’m not going to tell you how to live your life. As your best friend, and a wise elder, however, I do recommend that you find something else to think about, whether it’s a new hobby or a new partner.”
“I like this house,” Dean declares as he finishes the last of his tea. “Even if it is a lot of work.”
Sam’s eyes narrowed, but he did as instructed. “I see the market. I see people selling their wares, trading goods and services, conversing with friends and strangers alike.”
“Would you stop being so goddamn composed for one minute--”
She takes a deep breath and shakes her head. “It’s alright. It’s important.”
“She works with me at the store,” Dean says. “Big Xena fan, if you know what I mean.” He winks, and Cas grins in understanding.
He hadn’t said it out loud in years. Something that was once such a large part of his identity now felt clumsy on his tongue. “Castiel Novak.”
She’s right. Maybe in the movies, the grand gesture always works. The frantic chase through the airport or standing outside someone’s house in the pouring rain, the passionate speech and the eventual reunion. Dean loves a good rom-com as much as anyone, but he’s pretty sure they’re the last place he should be looking for advice on how to proceed.
Not lonely. He ignores the tiny voice in the back of his head that suggests it isn’t just boredom he’s experiencing. He is alone, in several senses of the word, but that doesn’t mean he’s lonely. He’s just…
The last Castiel had seen them, they had been lying in the grass in a field that may not even have existed in the strictest sense of the word. He opened his mouth, then shut it again.
So on top of everything else, he’s also observant. This is definitely a trap. Dean shrugs and spreads his hands before him, not answering Cas’ question. After another moment of silence, Cas sighs and starts talking.
“Around there,” Donna says with a nod. “All the older ladies in town shook their heads and said what a shame it was, the way he refused any of their offers to help. Honestly, I think more than a few of them still hold grudges from back then.”
Weaving the net is a good distraction. His hands move quickly through the patterns, using trailing vines from the trees to craft a clumsy but functional trap. Just on the other side of the rise in the ground, where the water moves more slowly, several decent-sized rocks jut up from its surface. Carefully, Dean balances himself on one of them, net at the ready.
“I have nothing to offer her,” Dean says flatly. “I am as dependent on you as she will be, my lord.”
Cas doesn’t need him to clarify. He knows, in the way he knows Dean down to his very bones, down to his very soul. “I did.”
Dean glances over at him. “Nervous?”
Cas drains the last of his beer and sets it down with a jarring thud. “If I had listened to it, I would have broken. I would have called you back.”
“Yeah.” Dean shrugs, looking apologetic. “I know it’s a dumb distinction, but--”
Dean stares at him, a muscle jumping in his jaw. “No,” he says eventually. “No, I don’t have anything else to say.”
But Claire squares her shoulders and holds her head proudly high as she looks over at Kaia, seated just to her left. “Mother, I’d like to introduce you to Kaia. Properly, not just in a dream. She is”-- she falters for a moment, but at Kaia’s brief nod, continues-- “an enchantress of great power, but more than that”-- a small smile-- “she is my chosen companion.”
Hael sputters with disbelief as Ash walks away, the rest of the table breaking into laughter. “Am I going to have to play the menacing older brother?” Balthazar asks, looking far too excited at the prospect. “You’re a grown woman, Hael, I know, but seeing as my own extracurricular activities have been sadly limited as of late, I need something to distract me.”
Cas takes a moment to answer. “Yeah,” he says eventually. “It is. Maybe I can call up someone at the power station and have them flip a few switches every few months.”
“I can see that.” Dean turned to the other man. “Balthazar, is it? You must be the friend who needed Castiel’s help the other night. You’re looking okay to me now.”
The door finally swings open, and they’re crashing through it, hands scrabbling at coat buttons and lips seeking each other as Dean kicks the door shut behind them. He’s already backing away down the hallway, outer layers falling to the floor as they stumble together towards Dean’s bedroom.
Sheriff Hanscum raises a hand to shield her eyes from the sun as she looks at him. “Do you want me to come with you? Might be easier, having someone they know there.”
Despite himself, Castiel smiles. He pours himself a cup of tea from the pot on the table and ladles himself a bowl of porridge. “Did you make this?” he asks as he sits across from her.
“Christ.” Dean laughs, but there’s no humour in it. “You really were determined to cut me out completely, weren’t you?” He stands, buttoning his coat. “Well, sorry to mess that up for you, I guess. I won’t bother you again.”
“Of course,” Winchester said, biting back a smile. “I’m shocked she’s ever forgiven you for that.”
Dean would come for dinner, and likely other activities. Castiel would fulfill his wildest fantasies, all the things humans expected of encounters with vampires. They were never looking for genuine connection, just the thrill of something dangerous. Dean would be satisfied, Castiel would be satisfied, and then he could focus his attention on other things.
It feels strange walking through the tunnel under the stadium on his own. Usually, he’s surrounded by his teammates, their energy feeding his. Dean draws in a deep breath, letting it out slowly, his footsteps echoing down the long hall. He and his team are about to enter the playoffs for the second time in two years, and if Dean has anything to say about it, this time they’re not going to get knocked out in the first round.
“Is there anything strange happening among our kind in Seattle?” he asked. Better to be vague and let her offer information than ask pointed questions she might dodge anyway.
“Do you spend a great deal of time there?” Castiel asked. Casting his mind back over their previous conversations, he could not recall Winchester mentioning his estate. Only his childhood at the inn, his school days, and his current life in London.
. Not my title.”
“I’m sorry we had to receive so many visitors,” Dean says, grimacing. “The banns and the newspaper announcements certainly did their work. I believe we had more than half of London society pass through our parlour in the past weeks.”
The messenger nods again, and is half-sunk into a curtsey before she stops herself, eyes wide. Dean flinches and offers a tight smile as she rises, then closes the door firmly behind her.
Dean’s voice is quiet when he replies. “People don’t like what they don’t understand.” He looks away from Cas as he speaks, but there’s a world of sadness under his simple words, and weariness as well. It strikes a chord within Cas, and he almost reaches out, but restrains himself at the last minute.
“What? No,” Dean protests, holding his hands up in front of himself. “I’m sorry. I’ll behave, I promise.”
“That’s bullshit,” Sam says. “You don’t really believe that, do you?”
Cas’ eyes flutter shut as he chews, and Dean grins in satisfaction. “Good, right?”
“Dean--” Castiel protested, but at Dean’s impatient gesture, he did as instructed.
“It may not be the match they expected,” he says, beaming up at Dean. “But the outcome will be the same, and it will be our choice. One of the few we have in this life.”
“How convenient,” Cas comments.
“Yes.” Castiel still looked distant. “Which is how I know she isn’t behind this.”
Slowly, a smile breaks across Dean’s face. “Alright,” he says. “I, Dean Winchester, will have sex with you, Castiel Novak.”
“Everything’s fine,” he assures her. “I stopped for the night at a motel in-- I’m not even entirely sure where, to be honest. I’m just checking in.”
Glancing down at his phone, Dean sighed as he remembered there would be no texts from Castiel. Because he didn’t own a cell phone. Maybe Dean could convince him that it was time, that the situation called for an easier way for them to keep in touch. He had a feeling Castiel’s texts would be hilarious, and God knew they could use some laughs right about now.
Dean drew in a steadying breath. He wished he could tell Jody the truth, tell her he didn’t deserve this gift. But instead, he leaned forward and kissed her cheek and simply said, “Thank you.”
“She chose you for a reason,” Castiel replies. He draws nearer, circling playfully around Dean’s head. “As did I.”
But even human killers follow patterns sometimes. If he pulls back the veil just the slightest inch, she might be able to see something he’s been missing.
“Of course,” Jody echoed. “You would settle for nothing less.”
Eyes wide, Winchester let out a slow whistle. “I am mightily rebuked,” he said, dipping his chin.
The next time they see the world outside the four walls of the church, it will be as a wedded pair.
Obligingly, Castiel slid a second finger inside him, nudging Dean into a kiss as he did.
“It’s not dumb,” Cas says quickly. He takes a deep breath, nudging Dean’s foot under the table. “I’m grateful for your help. It means a lot to me, that you’re willing to spend time with me and work on my confidence. So if you need to have some ground rules, no matter how strange they might seem, please just tell me.”
Swallowing back a bitter reply, Castiel does as instructed. He leans out the carriage window beside Anna and offers a limp wave. A roar rises from the crowd, and a yellow rose comes soaring through the sky. With instincts honed by years of sword practice, Castiel catches it, and the crowd cheers again.
Dean manages to keep his promise to Jack within the first week of his visit. It’s a beautiful sunny day, and the young royals have spent most of their time within the palace grounds. When Claire emerges from her chambers with a particular gleam in her eyes, Dean knows exactly what she’s about to ask.
“Then why didn’t you listen to my message? Why didn’t you call me back?” Dean doesn’t sound angry anymore, just hurt. It’s far worse. His pain burrows inside Cas’ chest and lodges there, guilt tearing him to shreds.
He’s at the coffee shop a few blocks down from his apartment. He’s only been gone three months, but he doesn’t recognize any of the baristas. His visions of being welcomed back with smiles and his regular order rung through without question die a swift and sudden death. Cas sighs and places his order, summoning a polite smile for the barista. It’s not her fault he had such high expectations.
At some point, maybe around one o’clock, Dean rouses himself from a doze at the sound of a light knock on his door just as his phone chimes with a new text.
A lump rises in Castiel’s throat, and he swallows roughly. “You’re my best friend too, Dean.”
Balthazar drew himself up stiffly. “Your pet is presumptuous, Castiel.”
It’s soft at first, another question in the form of a kiss. Dean answers eagerly, and Castiel lets out a groan as he deepens the kiss, one hand still braced on the ground as the other cradles Dean’s face. He tastes like sunshine and the salt of the sea, and Dean is swept away on the tide of years of unspoken longing. Castiel kisses like a promise and an apology all in one, and that last icy shard of fear melts from Dean’s heart at the warmth of it.
And in the next, a figure robed in black sits cross-legged, head rising in defiance as Magnus approaches with Castiel in tow.
There’s a local paper on the counter beside him, left behind by another guest. Cas picks it up and flicks idly through it, past the news about the high school sports teams and the upcoming craft fair. In the middle of the paper, a headline catches his eye:
“Charlie,” he says slowly, “what if there is an affair?”
Dean shrugged, still looking somewhat embarrassed. “I played the part of an overly protective, possessive new husband. Insisted you would be nursed back to health by no one but me.” He laughed. “I must have been convincing.”
With one last wave, Dean and Benny are out the door. Castiel locks it behind them, a soft smile on his face as Cersei twines around his ankles.
“So if we checked footage from the night Ryan was killed, we might be able to see when he left, and if he left with anyone?”
“I do,” Dean answers, voice shaking. Those words-- two simple words he wishes so desperately to say in a far different context. “Transactional, you called it, if I recall correctly. Did it never occur to you that I know a great deal about
“We knew Sam had inherited the gift by the time he was three. He could open the jars of his favourite jam without touching it, or make his toy dog chase him around the room. Small, simple, silly things. Mom was so proud.”
The disembodied voice over the speakers informs them that the aquarium will be closing in fifteen minutes, catching Cas off guard. He hadn’t realized how much time had passed. “Is there anything else in particular you wanted to see?” he asks, glancing between Sam and Dean.
He was the owner of several properties of varying degrees of grandness, and thought himself above being awed by the sprawling estates of his peers. But Rexford quite simply glowed in the late afternoon sun, the gates glinting as they swung open to admit the carriage, a smoothly paved path leading up to loop in front of the house around a merrily splashing fountain. The hedges were perfectly trimmed, the lawn brilliantly green, and off to the side of the house, he could see what appeared to be a sprawling garden.
“No.” Sam shakes his head, his grin widening. “I just have a good therapist. But you get it now, right?”
Cas springs into action, dashing immediately towards them. The eyes disappear, but the thrill of knowing he was right, knowing these woods were more than they seemed, carries him forward. He crashes through the trees, no longer caring how much noise he makes.
Something hovers in the back of Dean’s mind, a memory that flashes through his brain like the last bursts of lightning in the sky above. Something his mother mentioned, long ago, but the details escape him.
Quietly, they push further into the woods until the sun has disappeared completely and the trees surround them once more. Castiel finds another sheltered nook to turn into a campsite, and they set up even more efficiently than they did the night before.
he writes.
“Not really.” Benny shakes his head fondly. “Getting answers out of Dean is like pulling teeth sometimes, especially when it’s anything remotely personal.”
He heard the catch in Winchester’s breath. “You are marvelous when you’re on your dignity,” he said, heading for the flight of steps that led down into the garden, “but you’re an utter delight when you let it slip.”
But he must also have been paying attention, that night they first touched themselves in each other’s presence, because he smirked as he dropped his hands to rove over Dean’s chest, barely brushing against his nipples. Dean let out a cry of his own, leaning into the touch, as Castiel followed the path of his hands with his lips and tongue. Throwing his head back, Dean groaned as Castiel’s teeth scraped ever so lightly over his nipple, jolts of pleasure coursing through his entire body.
Cas laughs, hoisting a bright blue ball in an easy one-handed grip. “I hadn’t considered that. But yes, I suppose it would provide a certain sense of satisfaction.”
Dean lets out a noise that might be a laugh if it weren’t so bitter. “You may have heard, Agent, that I’m not the most social person. Yes, all night. There’s nothing unusual about that.”
He takes a deep breath before continuing. “We’re about as far away from home as we can be. For me, at least.” A strange smile hovers around his lips. “You asked me if I grew up near the forest. I did. At the southwestern corner, in a small house just at the edge of the woods. I was wandering through the trees and fishing in its streams as far back as I can remember.”
Laughing, Castiel spins him out, then reels him back in so their chests are pressed flush together. He’s gorgeous like this, face free and open, and Dean really, really wants to kiss him in front of all these people.
Going about his daily routines was strange in light of the threat looming over all of them. The blood bank was busy, but a nervous silence hung over the large room as Castiel waited in the long line. The nurse who helped him met his eyes without any of the warmth he was accustomed to finding here, and didn’t reply to his polite farewell as he thanked her for her assistance. There were police officers wearing the logo of the Paranormal Investigations department posted at all the entrances, watching the vampires with wary eyes. He wondered if Sam was one of them, but none of the officers bore any resemblance to Dean. Castiel nodded cordially at them, feeling their wary gaze on his back as he exited.
At that, Dean smiled. “Oh?” he said, trailing his lips along the sharp cut of Castiel’s jaw and watching it move under his kiss. “Good dreams, I hope?”
Still frowning, Naomi nods. Beside her, Anna watches him with narrowed eyes, but takes his proffered arm and allows herself to be guided towards the long tables at the other side of the ballroom. “What are you up to?” she asks, keeping her voice low.
Krissy gave him a lopsided smile. “You got it, boss.”
Abruptly, Billie stood from her seat and began to pace the room. “Your food, our water. Void strikes at us from both angles. And according to King Castiel, the earth itself has been damaged in your home as well?”
“No.” Cas shakes his head. “Don’t, Dean. I don’t begrudge you your happiness. It’s all I want for you.” His hand creeps up to toy with the rosary around his neck. “If there’s one thing I know, it’s that life is too short. I’m glad you and Sam are going to be present in each other’s lives again.”
Which is how Dean ends up calling in every employee he has and then throwing on an apron himself, dashing around the kitchen like a contestant on one of those cooking competition shows, except without the benefit of editing. Under the pressure, tempers flare as quickly as the gas range, so Dean spends half his time playing peacemaker while also ensuring everything gets finished on time.
So Cas does. He and Cesar join Dean, Charlie, and Dorothy, then Jesse wanders over to stand with his husband, chiming in to their conversation about the potential existence of unicorns. Charlie is firmly in favour of the possibility, while the others aren’t so convinced. But before the discussion can get really heated, Ellen bangs her hand on the flat wooden top of the bar, silencing the room.
Gently, he let his hand drift lower, barely brushing over his entrance. “May I?” he asked.
An unreadable expression crosses Castiel’s face, but it is quickly replaced by a smile as he steps forward into the space Dean has cleared for him.
“Fashionably so.” Castiel waved him him into his seat with a shrug. “I won’t hold it against you.”
“Dean--”
“You all did wonderfully tonight,” he tells the interns. “I’m so proud of each and every one of you.”
Charlie doesn’t break stride, but she does give Cas a broad grin. “Alrighty then. Let’s get you settled in, then we’ll get everyone together for introductions and a thrilling rundown of the last month.”
With his self-righteous indignation burning brightly in his chest, Dean set out to have the most perfect day a young, wealthy gentleman of London could have.
Dean watches them as well, a wistful smile playing about his lips. “He’s grown up,” he says, quiet enough to not be overheard. “And I missed so much of it.”
“Didn’t believe me, did you?” Dean grins. “I prefer the slower dances, but I don’t mind this either.”
The rain continues to fall steadily as they move further north, but the air is growing even thicker, and the patches of sky Dean can see between the trees are a dark, threatening grey. Every instinct in his body tells him to seek shelter, but he pushes those thoughts aside and attempts to focus on his surroundings.
“Sir?” Garth has come up beside Castiel, looking at him with something like awe in his eyes. “A suggestion?”
It isn’t entirely surprising, considering what he’s learned about the young people in this town. But it does add a new layer to Cas’ understanding of the circumstances, and opens up an entirely new avenue of inquiry. “Did Ryan talk about this with many other people?”
Once it reached full dark, he took to the streets. After Dean and Claire had left the other night, he had visited a small shop he knew of, run by a family of ghouls. With a few strategically raised eyebrows and careful negotiations, he had acquired a small vial of dead blood, which he now carried in a syringe in his pocket.
Stifling a laugh, Dean combed his fingers through Castiel’s hair, half expecting him to start purring. He let his own eyes slip closed, the aftershocks of pleasure still coursing through his body, and listened to the rain beat against the windows as his heart rate slowly settled.
Dean huffs a laugh of his own. It is an understatement, to be sure, but those memories cannot hurt him, not today. There are times he still wakes in a cold sweat, phantom figures crowding his mind, but with Castiel’s arms around him and Castiel’s low voice in his ear, they are quickly banished to the past where they belong.
There’s no sign of acknowledgement.
“I can’t toast to myself,” she protests.
She mutters something under her breath, something that sounds suspiciously like
The long hours of the day pass in lazy, indulgent pleasure. After a shared shower, they eat lunch pressed close together at the kitchen table. Dean slides his foot up Cas’ leg and Cas stands so abruptly he knocks his chair over and drags Dean back to bed, then has to dash back out to his truck in only his jeans because all the condoms in Dean’s nightstand have long since passed their expiry date. He comes back to find Dean naked on the bed, hands stroking between his own legs, and the world narrows to just the two of them again. Later, they make dinner wearing only their underwear and the aprons Dean insists on, not wanting either of their chests to get burned. They curl up together on the couch, kissing for the simple pleasure of it, until the desire between them burns as brightly as the flames in the fireplace and Cas pulls Dean down onto the rug before the hearth and rides him into exhaustion.
He’s being unreasonable. And rude. Charlie’s words rattle in his head, a sick feeling rising in his throat. Is he being arrogant? Is he being selfish? He’s had a fairly impressive career as a hunter, but a relatively short one. If someone more experienced-- Jesse, or Tracy, or even Jo-- were to come to join him here, would they see things he had missed?
Gasping for breath, he forces his eyes to focus on the scene before him. He recognizes Castiel by the shine of his blade as he swings it toward the dragon. Dean should have known he would never run from a fight. The dragon roars, and Dean closes his eyes, knowing the end is near. He can’t bring himself to watch.
Turning his head slightly, Dean presses a kiss to the centre of Castiel’s palm. Castiel’s breath catches in his throat, and he holds himself perfectly still, heart racing. But Dean only smiles softly at him and nuzzles into his chest, eyes slipping closed, and Castiel lies awake through the night, an unfamiliar longing coursing through his veins.
He shifts slightly, trying not to press up into Cas too much. He’s hard in his sweatpants and he knows the cotton won’t do a thing to hide the effect Cas is having on him. But Cas follows him, kissing his way across Dean’s collarbone, and suddenly his own hardness is pressing against Dean’s thigh. Dean lets out a muffled curse and drops his hands from Cas’ hips to his ass. Cas lets out a groan and thrusts himself forward, bringing them into even closer contact. “Dean,” he mumbles, words spoken right into the soft skin at the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder. “Dean, I need--”
With a shaky sigh, Dean continued along the corridor. Two unfamiliar guards watched over a doorway surrounded by gorgeous tilework, and they both bowed low at Dean and Castiel’s approach. Dean nodded at them, then pushed open the door and ushered Castiel inside.
She smiles. “I’m happy to see Claire happy,” she says. “I’m not used to being the centre of attention the way she is.”
Dean looked at him for a moment, then nodded. “Not because you think something might happen to us. But because you think Crowley will tell us something. Some bad news.”
Beside him, Castiel was looking in the same direction. Dean suspected his thoughts were following a similar path. He drew his horse abreast and leaned over to say, “When all this is done, I want to go sledding again.”
“Will your other friends be as kind as Monsieur Dupont?” Aliette asks, looking up at Castiel. She pulls her lower lip between her teeth, eyes wide and fearful. “Will they like me?”
Rather than replying, Benny just tightens his embrace. Castiel relaxes into his hold, enjoying the feeling of being held against such a broad chest, the security and comfort it brings. Dean has always waxed poetic about the way Benny holds him, and Castiel finally understands why.
“Not like there was anything better to do.” Dean stands and collects their empty coffee cups. “I’ll leave you to it, then.”
“Yes, please.” He turns his head and smiles. “But there’s no rush.”
“Damn it,” Cas curses. He disentangles himself from Dean’s arms and sits up to grab his phone off the side table. “Hello?”
Never one to back down, Dean favoured him with a slow, smouldering glance, taking in every inch of Castiel’s exposed skin. “Alright, then. I want to lay you down on one of these ridiculous chaises and trace the line of your spine with my lips. I want to set that cold skin of yours on fire with my tongue.” He let one hand drift downward, just barely brushing between Castiel’s cheeks. “Then I want to taste you here. Make you fall apart, make you beg for me to fuck you, to let you come. I want to keep you on edge for what seems like hours, until you can’t say anything but my name, and then finally, slide my fingers inside and give you what you need.”
The small smile that curls up the corner of Dean’s mouth is a beautiful reward for that trust. “If you have to go to Chicago again, or even if you just want to-- will you let me go with you next time?”
The silence stretches between them, uncomfortable until it isn’t. They both face forward, and while Cas is aware of Dean’s presence, he isn’t threatened by it. He darts an occasional glance across the aisle and sees that Dean’s eyes are closed. He almost looks like he’s sleeping.
With the way this case is going, he might be here until spring.
Even a few days ago, he would never have thought to dream of such a thing. To imagine free travel across the mountains without threat of discovery and death. For all that he missed his home and his family and friends there, Castiel knew he and Dean were doing the right thing.
“Yes.” Castiel gestured a bend in the path just ahead, where a stone bench was tucked. “It was his first success, and he planned to add more to it, but I confess I’m quite happy with where he left off.”
“Thank you,” Hannah manages between fits of coughing. “I’ll owe you one.”
She narrowed her eyes at him. “I suppose. Though so far all the attention has been on me, and in the spirit of equality and true sibling support, let’s talk about you before we declare ourselves truly close once again.”
Cas’ smile doesn’t fade, but it does turn softer, sweeter. He reaches for Dean’s hand and kisses the strip of pale skin on his ring finger, visible since Dean’s wedding ring is currently sitting safe and secure in his locker.  “I could say the exact same thing.”
“This way,” Jack says, tearing Dean’s gaze away from the dark sea and off to their left.
With a pained sigh, Castiel turns back to the dais, effectively blocking Dean’s line of sight. “Excuse me,” Dean says. “I know you think I’m a miserable excuse for a guard, but at least give me a chance. I’d like to be able to keep an eye on my charge, please.”
“Oh, shit.” Dean winces as Cas looks over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised in displeasure. “Sorry?” he says weakly.
“If you say so,” Dean mutters. Face clearing, he pulls the question sheet towards himself, tucking the pencil behind his ear. “Picture round,” he reads. “Name the artist associated with these famous outfits.”
The creak of the door doesn’t surprise him. He knew someone would come find him. The only question is whether it’s Sam or Cas. Dean rolls his head to the side, and in the narrow line of light from the hallway, makes out Cas’ familiar form.
Dean gives him a reassuring smile and lowers his voice. “He may be gruff, but he has a good heart. He married his wife when they were very young, you know, and they were happy together until she died a few years ago.”
He gets to his feet and crosses the room to greet Hannah, who has walked to the door with Jimmy. “Good to see you,” he tells them. “I hope you had a pleasant evening.”
At that, Castiel grinned. “No. But they may have been implied.”
“I thought it was time.” Cas looks down at the bar, drawing in a deep breath. “You look well.”
Dean shrugged, attempting a nonchalance he did not truly feel. “I am tired of tiptoeing around these matters. I wish to meet Void head-on, or at least witness its effects here.”
“I am not laughing,” Castiel replied. He stood straight and tall, though he gripped the back of his chair tightly. “As King Dean just said, it is difficult to adjust to a new pattern of life. Those who are accustomed to physical regimens will find it hard to abandon them easily, just as those accustomed to planning stealth attacks will find it hard to stop themselves from imagining new plans.” He looked at Sam as he spoke, and Sam acknowledged his words with a dip of his head but did not interject. “Perhaps those among us who represent the guards might have some ideas for how to shift their focus away from combative arts into something less martial but still challenging.”
“Do you know him well?” he asks Donna as they move farther away from the Winchester house.
Gadreel froze, his impassive face finally showing a trace of emotion. “You know about Metatron?”
“You found me.” Dean turns his head to the side, eyes warm and welcoming. “I hoped you would.”
“I don’t like this,” he said, frowning. “You’re a problem we have to solve, and quickly. Unfortunately, there are a number of other problems we have to solve, and your presence here complicates matters.”
Claire grins at him over her shoulder as she plucks more of the small purple blooms. “Are you saying you want one?”
As the spring came into view, Castiel raised his hand, signalling the others to halt. “Allow me,” he said, swinging down from the saddle.
“Yes,” Dean admitted. “Somehow, I doubt that is the test that lies before us.”
Castiel shook his head. “Only you,” he said hoarsely. “Dean--” he let his hands drift downward until they rested lightly on Dean’s head-- “you’re certain?”
After that first day, Castiel slowly becomes accustomed to life in Carlisse. As promised, their days are full of activities, all those Dean listed and more. They also find time to simply relax, to sit in the palace gardens with a picnic and watch the clouds streak across the sky, shouting out the figures they can discern in the whisps of white. Anna tends to interpret them as animals, Sam as figures from the books he is always reading, while Castiel sees patterns from nature like trees or mountains. Dean seems to take it as his personal mission to make them laugh harder with every wild statement, going so far as to claim that one particularly large cloud perfectly resembles the outrageous hat one of the elderly court ladies has taken to wearing.
“Our killer was also involved with her?” Charlie interrupts. “It’s possible. She could have turned them on purpose, or they could have fought and got bitten by accident. It doesn’t really narrow down a list of suspects, though. Probably male, based on the prior victims, but not necessarily. I don’t assume. And probably in their mid-thirties to late-forties, but again, that’s just based on the earlier patterns. It’s an interesting avenue, Cas, but I don’t know that it will lead anywhere.”
Dean’s hand brushes against his under the table, and Castiel takes a deep breath, drawing courage from his nearness. “Dean and I have something to tell you,” he says.
“Indeed.” Cas tries to think of some clever reply, but comes up short. Instead, he looks over at Sam and holds out his hand. “Cas Novak. Nice to meet you.”
He almost does it. But then Dean draws in a shuddering breath and lowers his hand from his face. “I’m sorry,” he says. “You didn’t come here to hear all this, I’m sure.”
Thunder rumbles again, but closer this time. A tree branch groans as it shakes in the wind, and Dean raises his hand to brush rainwater away from his eyes. His boots are starting to slide on the uneven ground, and he guesses Castiel’s are as well, because he slows his pace, taking more careful steps than before.
Rowena raises a hand, and Castiel falls silent. Despite the tension, a small smile springs to Dean’s lips. He’s never seen Castiel silenced so effectively.
“He did!”
Winchester burst into laughter, shoulders relaxing. “Oh, well done, Milton. Very well done indeed.” He edged closer on the seat, the strong muscles of his thigh not quite touching Castiel’s but close enough to feel the warmth that radiated from his body. “It was the conversation you objected to, then?”
Dean’s mouth went dry. “You are correct,” he managed. “I misspoke.”
“What have you done to him?” Dean demanded. He ought to have been frightened, ought to have been fleeing in terror. But his concern for Castiel eclipsed any instinct he had for self-preservation, and though his hands shook, he held his ground.
“I made you a pie,” Cas says abruptly, and while the words serve to break the strange tension between them, they also only increase Dean’s desire to close the distance between them and put their lips to other uses than talking. “It was in the oven when the power went out, but it only needed a few more minutes, so I think it should still be edible.” He takes a few steps towards the foyer and comes back with a plastic bag Dean hadn’t noticed before, thrusting it out at him. “I got the recipe from Gabriel. He assured me it was their most popular flavour, but I’ve never heard you talk about pecan pie before, only apple and cherry.” He pauses for a moment, his eyes widening, and says, “You don’t have a nut allergy, do you?”
“I’ve done plenty of giving for the day,” Dean points out. “Or taking. Depends on how you look at it, I guess. Either way.” He points at the stoplight ahead of them. “Left up there.”
“Attacked.” A groan, then a cough. “The park by City Hall. Cas--”
“It might only be a stream.”
Cas matches his expression. “My job.”
She squeezes his hand lightly and summons a small smile. “Thank you, Agent. I hope you find what you’re looking for.”
Castiel bowed politely over her hand and managed what he hoped was a gracious smile. “The honour is mine, Lady Talbot.”
A smile breaks across Dean’s face, and Castiel draws in a quiet breath at the way it transforms him entirely. “That at least we can provide,” he replies. “My chambers are available to you, as are Sam’s.”
“And I bet you and Cas are all too happy to play taste-tester,” Bess teases.
To his credit, Dean does look somewhat embarrassed. “What was I supposed to do? I was a bit busy trying to defend myself from you and your accusations.”
When someone knocks on his door just after nine, horrifying images of one of his elderly neighbours in distress flash through Dean’s mind. He should have checked in with them earlier instead of lying around feeling sorry for himself. He’s up off the couch in an instant, stumbling down the hall and throwing the open the front door. But instead of Missouri or Mildred or Frank standing there, it’s Cas.
His mother and sisters were still asleep, unaccustomed to Castiel’s country habit of rising so early, so he breakfasted alone. Afterward, he passed a few hours writing to his neighbours at Rexford, informing them of the change in his plans and suggesting they might reach him here in London for the foreseeable future. He also drafted a letter to his steward, ensuring the house and park would be well-kept in his absence.
Dean almost choked at the way the blonde’s eyes widened, her mouth falling open in shock. “Keep the beer,” she said to Dean, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “This place sucks.”
At that, Sam exhales noisily. “Perhaps,” he admits. “It is difficult to put into words.” Stretching his hands in front of himself, he summons a small ball of light and tosses it gently from hand to hand. “Small tricks, illusions, quick workings-- these come to me easily, with little effort. Anything larger-- I might be able to do it, but it is unpredictable. There is no guarantee of its success. You saw how many attempts I went through before I was able to secure your release.”
“King Lucien was prince of Nofenne before he married Queen Kelly.”
Somehow, the idea hadn’t even occurred to Dean-- how many people they would be required to lie to. His hesitation must have shown in his face, because Milton’s eyes softened and he said, “Only if you wish. If you trust him to keep our secret--”
“Yeah.” Dean’s eyes go soft, almost fond, and the wave of jealousy rises in Cas’ chest once more. “We keep each other’s secrets.”
More than anything else, more than the kissing or the sex or the minimal cuddling afterward, that small statement leaves a pleasant warmth in Castiel’s chest. Knowing that Dean and Benny discussed this down to the last detail, to having Benny at the ready should any of them change their minds, demonstrates how much care and consideration they put into this night. All because he asked it of them.
Castiel watched him with equal interest. Most of his human guests were impressed with his home decor, but in a very different way. They always seemed pleased, triumphant, like they had been hoping to find a lair exactly like this, and Castiel was content enough to cater to their perceived notions of vampirehood. But Dean-- he seemed amused rather than impressed. Not in a scornful way, but in a way that invited Castiel to be in on the joke.
“Make your reports, then.” Castiel walks slowly around the table, trailing his fingers through the thick coat of dust across its surface. “What would have been discussed here?”
“The honour is mine,” Milton replied, but his eyes were fixed on Dean’s. “If I might beg a private word with your brother?”
They joined the other members of their families for the meal, and Dean was impressed at how easily conversation flowed between them. Lady Hael, of course, was utterly fascinated by Jody, monopolizing much of her attention with questions about running an inn. The Dowager Duchess looked equally intrigued, but her interest was tempered with wariness as she watched her daughter’s face, clearly hoping she would not lose Hael to the romantic notion of a countryside inn.
“You don’t have to explain.” There’s an unusual softness in Castiel’s eyes, or maybe it’s just the effect of the setting sun. “Come on.”
“A cruel but cunning strike,” Rowena murmured. “We must be cunning ourselves, if we are to win this fight.”
As they finish eating, people begin to drift away, some of them to the pool table in the corner, some of them out to their cars. Jesse and Cesar are just passing through on their way back to their ranch in New Mexico, and Cas shakes their hands firmly as they say their goodbyes. Tracy, Max, and Alicia are all at the bar, doing shots of what Cas suspects is tequila, and Ash has disappeared into his lair at the back of the building.
“Cas,” Dean repeats. It sounds even better than Cas imagined it would, coming from his lips. “Thank you for trusting me, Cas.”
“Something like that.” Ellen gives him her patented no-nonsense look. “Tell us about the hunt.”
“Thank you.” Dean props himself back up on one elbow. Castiel is still sitting with his hands clasped around his knees, but the lines of his back and shoulders look significantly less stiff than they did earlier, and Dean counts that as a victory. “What about you? Do you have any siblings?”
Letting out a relieved sigh, Dean’s smile returned in full force. “So?” He leaned back slightly, one eyebrow raising.
He sounded more awed than afraid, so Castiel relaxed his grip on his knife as he nudged his horse forward. A few steps ahead, the path widened enough for him to draw up beside Dean, and so they rounded the corner and took in the scene before them at the very same moment.
Theo has the good grace to laugh. “Yeah, I did, but then stuff piled up while I was waiting for you to call me back. Ah, here we go!” He brandishes a ordinary-looking piece of paper at Cas, an expectant look on his face.
She accepts it with the graciousness of a lady born and raised, then dutifully follows Sidonie out of the room, throwing one longing look over her shoulder as she does.
Climbing inside, Dean pressed himself tightly against the curved wooden back of the sled and looked up at Castiel, a curious light in his eyes. “Please?” he said softly, gesturing to the space he had made in front of himself.
The betrothal of the Earl of Silverton to Mr. Benjamin Lafitte had caused quite the stir among the ton. Silverton’s title was well-respected, but it was widely known that much of the money had run out due to the excesses of its previous holder. In his youth, Silverton had sown his own fair share of wild oats, but now approaching his mid-thirties and recently risen to the rank of earl, responsibility could no longer be ignored. He needed a spouse, and a rich one at that.
“Oh.” The line goes quiet for a moment. “May I speak with Jimmy, please?”
Castiel sucked in a quick breath, eyes flaring wide. Dean just stared at Kevin, uncomprehending. “What do you mean?”
In this, as in most things, they were well-matched, both taking great pleasure in any and all types of lovemaking. Dean shrugged, less interested in the fairness of it than in the sheer enjoyment, and passed the jar to Castiel.
“Emmanuel,” Castiel answers. It is safer this way. Even if Samuel knows his true nature, he will not know his true name. There is too much power in it.
Charlie lets out a pleased gasp, Benny raises one eyebrow, and Cas just shakes his head, eyes soft and fond. “That was a terrible line,” he informs Dean, but he doesn’t pull his hand out of Dean’s grasp.
“Nah, you’re doing pretty well.” Dean winked at him, then smoothly took the bill out of their server’s hands before Castiel could grab it. “My treat,” he said firmly. “You cooked for me last time.”
Not for the first time, he wishes Charlie were here. She would drag them both onto the couch and shamelessly plop herself right in between them. Aiming for casual and probably missing by a mile, Dean strolls over to the couch and sits down at a respectable distance from Cas without squishing himself right against the arm. They have god knows how many days of this, he should probably get used to Cas being at close quarters sooner rather than later.
Sighing, Dean waves him towards the door. “Fine,” he says. “See you at the ball.”
Dean raises one eyebrow at him. “So you want me to stop?”
Castiel nodded gravely, even as his eyes swept leisurely over Dean from head to foot, lingering appreciatively over his shoulders and calves. “Shall we rectify that situation?”
Inwardly, Dean rolls his eyes. What a cliché. But he doesn’t stop his passionate speech to comment on the predictability of it. “Right. Rachel. But sometimes, life takes you by surprise. That’s what I want you to remember, Cas. Just because Inias changed his mind, or his heart, or however you want to think about it, doesn’t mean that there’s anything fundamentally wrong or lacking with you. Whatever he found with her, somebody else is going to find with you, I guarantee it.”
Dean is looking forward to meeting this guy, whose words are so at odds with his profile picture. And based on that, he doesn’t think he’s going to have any trouble finding things to compliment Cas on. He’s about ten times hotter than any other guy Dean has ever dated, with those big blue eyes and messy dark hair and intriguing tattoo across his collarbone.
He spits on the ground before Castiel’s cage and heads off towards the fire glowing at the other side of the camp. It is only once he is out of sight that Castiel allows himself a satisfied smile.
“Upstairs.” Theo jerks his head towards the apartment above. “Chloe!”
It’s Cas’ hand, reaching out for his, that brings him back to reality. Dean shudders, his heart rate settling, and turns onto his side, tucking his head into the crook of Cas’ shoulder. Cas doesn’t care if he makes a mess. He can just wave his hand, and they’ll be neat and tidy again.
“You aren’t old,” he replied automatically.
“Fuck.” Dean drags himself out of bed and presses his body up alongside the door. He can smell Cas’ steadying Alpha scent, and he gulps it in, letting it flow through his body and calm his racing heart. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bother you, I just--”
But right now, it isn’t even about the desire or the pursuit of pleasure. Dean’s hands trace patterns over his bare chest, skimming lightly across his stomach, and in them Cas finds comfort, a deep peace he hadn’t realized he was missing. Dean’s hands are calloused, but they run over Cas’ skin with something like reverence. Simply for the joy of touch, he runs his hands up the back of Dean’s thighs, feeling them tremble as he does.
At the sound of Dean’s voice, Castiel turned slowly on his stool, smiling up at him. Dean had his forearms braced on the surface of the bar, a towel slung over one shoulder and a pleased look on his face.
“I received your note,” Sam said briskly, striding into Dean’s chambers the next morning. “You wished to speak to me?”
Dean was not entirely sure how to answer that. He was set to marry a stranger, someone who by all rights should have been his enemy. Someone, as it turned out, he could not even touch without excruciating pain. And yet he did not view the upcoming marriage with resentment, or even nervousness. Despite their brief acquaintance, he was assured that he and Castiel had a great deal in common. Besides, it would be a mere formality, and it would not be long before Castiel returned to his own kingdom. Even if they could only manage to tolerate one another, it would be enough to secure the treaty and to build a new relationship between their kingdoms.
The combination of the whiskey and the darkness is starting to make Dean sleepy despite the fact that it’s only just after midnight. He drains the last few sips from his glass and places it on the table with a gentle thud. “Man, we should do this more often,” he says, head lolling back onto the couch cushions. “This is nice.”
It’s several minutes before either of them has the breath to form words. “Well,” Dean says thoughtfully. “I don’t think I would call your performance unsatisfactory.”
“Your Majesty.” Hael, one of the palace attendants, bobbed a brief curtsey as she reached him. “The messenger from Calorna has returned and requests your presence.”
Castiel meets his eyes, and there’s a new spark of determination in his gaze. “It means our search begins right here.”
“I don’t want you to be inspired, I want you to fuck me,” Dean shot back, shifting his hips restlessly.
“Are you a doctor now?” Dean’s tone remained light, but there was an edge of something sharper to it.
The boxers clung enticingly to Castiel’s ass as he led Dean inside. Dean’s hands itched to reach out and see if they felt as smooth as they looked, but just because he was raring to go didn’t mean that Castiel was. He had just woken up, after all.
“And I love Castiel,” Dean finishes smoothly. Castiel lets out a sigh of relief, his happiness at hearing those words only slightly diminished by the circumstances. “How can you ask us to find other partners when that is true and always will be?”
He really should just leave it at that. But whether it’s plain curiosity or some weird way of punishing himself (Sam would say it’s the latter), Dean adds,
It’s the wrong response. Benny arches an eyebrow and straightens up to his full height, crossing his arms over his threateningly broad chest. “Is that going to be a problem, Agent?”
He gave one last wave as he descended to the lower level, leaving Castiel silent and thoughtful in his wake. Tonight’s attack had rattled him far more than he had allowed Balthazar to see. Without him to focus on, all of Castiel’s jumbled thoughts crowded his mind, leading him down paths he would rather not take. If Balthazar-- a well-liked, powerful vampire who never showed allegiance to any particular group-- could be attacked so boldly, what did it mean for the rest of them?
It dawns on Castiel, then, and he cannot believe it took him so long to realize. “You have waited for this day for a long time, have you not? Having people here once more.”
“Not to say that I don’t--” Dean made a frustrated sound.
Benny was silent for a long moment, and then he asked, “At what cost?”
“Actually, he said he wanted to see if you were as good-looking in person as you were in your profile,” Cas interjects.
Finally, Cas broke the silence. “When we get to the top,” he said. His voice was low, even rougher than usual, and Dean shivered at the sound of it.
Dean freezes, eyes flaring wide with surprise, and if Cas isn’t mistaken, also with desire. “Whatever you want,” he murmurs. “After all, we’re dating now, right?”
As he dodges the burst of fire, throwing himself behind one of the rocks at the cave’s entrance, Dean’s only hysterical thought is
He takes his time with it, slowly stripping off each layer of clothing and tossing it to the ground. The window is still open a crack, and the cool breeze wafts his ocean smell all around the room. There’s an edge to it now, a hint of lightning over open water that isn’t normally present, and Dean knows it’s the scent of pure desire.
“Well, find out!” Castiel snaps.
“I’m sure,” Missouri agrees. “I’ll send my granddaughter back to the palace with you, shall I? She can make a list of volunteers.”
“They’re probably losing without you,” Dean says.
Donna darted to the other side of the room, rummaged through a chest of drawers, and emerged with a pair of satin gloves and a triumphant smile. “Will this do?” she asked.
He feels a gentle hand on his arm and looks down to see Sarah giving him a wry smile. “Let’s give them a moment. I’ll put the coffee on.”
“We are,” Dean and Castiel say in unison.
“Sorry, was I not supposed to?” Balthazar doesn’t look sorry at all. “He did ask me to check in on his place after he unceremoniously booted you from the role.”
By midday, they are ready to depart. Castiel embraces both Donna and Jody, and Dean does the same. “You come back and see us again,” Donna commands, and Dean grins as he bows to her.
“Of course,” he lies. “I thought we might like some refreshment, that’s all.”
The bald statement settles warmly into Cas’ chest, and he returns the smile. “It isn’t easy, though, is it? Opening yourself up to others.”
Castiel shuddered. “Well, then, I thank the fates that I am indeed here. While you will see traces of my character here, I might also remind you that it is a vast and ancient family home, and one cannot ever escape the generations that came before them, not fully.”
Castiel traced a slow pattern onto the floor, not meeting her eyes. “Dean is falling ill,” he said quietly. “Merely a cough, for now, but it will worsen before long.” He looked up and twisted his mouth into a smile that was more of a grimace. “It has not even been a full week.”
Uneasy, he backs out of the room, closing the door quietly behind himself.
The room is comfortably furnished, but in no way lavish in its decor. A set of crossed swords hang above the fireplace, while a lighter weapon, most likely used for practice, rests in one corner. There are books scattered on the low table in front of the window, and Castiel examines them with interest: adventure stories, mostly, but a few volumes of poetry and a natural history as well.
Dean turns in his arms, grinning up at him. “I suppose we ought to take advantage of that, then?” He lowers his voice, looking up at Castiel from under long lashes that gleam gold in the late afternoon sun. “Husband?”
He had often heard Milton described as a serious man, as befitted someone of his rank. Watching him now, Dean understood why that might be the impression he gave, but it did not entirely match the warm, amused grin that Milton had given him during their earlier conversation. More intrigued than ever, Dean caught Milton’s gaze and held it, then threw him a swift wink.
Pausing, Cas taps on the picture and is redirected to the user’s profile. His name is Carlos, he’s an artist, and he’s attractive in a quiet, unassuming manner. On his profile, he lists an interest in live music, fashion, and gardening.
Castiel forced a smile to his face. “It’s forgotten,” he said, possibly the least truthful statement he had ever made in his life. “Perhaps on the way back to the house, we can take a tour through the gardens here and you can find some inspiration for your own. I refuse to lend you my gardener, though. He’s a marvel, and I will not share him.”
“Well, now it’s time.” Dean notes that Cas’ glass is empty, and waves to Jamie. “Do you want another beer?”
“He wanted me to co-sign his loan,” Tom says. He shakes his head, a sharp, violent gesture. “I told him no. I didn’t want him to leave.”
“Agent.” Donna’s eyes are wide, one hand pressed to her chest. “You don’t think Dean had anything to do with this?”
The soft fabric of Dean’s shirt rustles as he mimics Castiel’s position. “I do too,” he says quietly. “I am ready to be king. I want to be a good king, and my mother has prepared me well for it. But there are times I wish I could have chosen it, rather than being marked for it just because of the circumstances of my birth.”
“You should. You’ll be a regular Julia Child in no time.” Dean salutes him with his beer bottle, which is also now empty. “You want another one?”
Apparently, it’s the wrong question. Dean’s eyes go cold, and his lips tighten. “I don’t think that’s relevant, Agent.”
Balthazar cleared his throat, glancing down at the picture on the screen. “I do find it difficult to be frightened of this face,” he said slowly, “but--”
Tentatively, Castiel raises his hand and strokes one finger down Dean’s back. “It’s alright,” he says, his deep voice rumbling soothingly in Dean’s ears. “You’re safe now.”
Dean draws in a startled breath. He rarely spares a though for Castiel’s long-absent brother, likely because Castiel rarely mentions him. By his calculations, it has been eighteen years since they saw one another. Intrigued, Dean continues to read.
Castiel passed a hand over his forehead, grimacing at the dampness of it. The heat of this place was intolerable. “Let me see Prince Dean,” he said. “Let me speak with him. Surely we will be able to come to some sort of agreement.”
Dean closes his eyes on a shuddering exhale, then opens them again, frowning. “Fuck,” he says. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I didn’t even think about how hard this might be for you, seeing me and Sam getting another chance when--”
“I’m sorry,” Dean tells her softly. “But they can.”
When Dean begins to move, Castiel groans and tips his head back against the pillow, hands clutching at the sheets beneath him. It’s not an exaggeration to say he’s never felt anything like this before. Dean rides him in practiced movements, hips and thighs working furiously as he rises and falls above him, an easy grin on his face the entire time.
Anna rolled her eyes in a most unladylike fashion. “Of course you invite him. And his brother, and a few select friends. A small gathering, so you won’t feel overwhelmed. You’ll have everyone desperate for an invitation, but it will give you some time away from London.” She grinned, then, looking ten years younger and a thousand times more mischievous. “And I will have the chance to be approached on my own merits again, rather than as a source of gossip about my brother, the ever so mysterious Duke of Milton.”
It’s enough to grant him the best sleep he’s had in six weeks.
“Yeah, well, so is the fact that one of us has to remain alert,” Dean points out. “So until such time as we’re both off duty, this is the best we get.” Stretching out on the ground, he arranges himself with his head pillowed on Castiel’s lap and closes his eyes. “Tell me a story?”
“Oh yeah?” Dean raised a challenging eyebrow, a wicked gleam in his eyes. “You sure about that,
“I understand,” Castiel repeats. He is still holding Dean’s hand, and when he shifts slightly on the bench, for a brief, soaring moment, Dean thinks he is about to drop to one knee and propose there and then. But instead, he just slides closer he can wrap his arm about Dean’s shoulders, holding him tightly.
“I won’t book the flight, okay? If that’s what you really want. You take care of your family, and you call me when you can.” It will hurt, not being able to be there for Cas, but Dean will do it.
“Don’t you worry about me, Agent,” Dean says. “I can take care of myself.”
Thirty-five minutes later, he’s sliding into a booth at Lou’s, smiling nervously at Dean. “Hi,” he says, proud of the way his voice doesn’t squeak or shake or in any way reveal his mental state.
He isn’t announced, of course. Technically, he’s not here a guest, but in his official capacity of bodyguard. So as Claire and Kaia walk proudly towards the dais at the other end of the room, he slides off to the side, melting into the crowd while keeping his line of sight unobstructed.
“Just so we’re clear,” he says, “we’re talking about a one-time thing?”
Dean lets out a bitter laugh, and Castiel winces at the harsh sound. “Don’t you understand? Any match that is not with Castiel will be distasteful to me.”
No, he didn’t, and Dean cursed himself for it. “Get back to work,” he said, scowling fiercely at them. “I may not be the boss yet, but I can still fire you.”
“You got it.” Dean climbs off the bed, legs slightly unsteady, and pulls Cas up after him. He hesitates, giving him a sidelong look, then says, “Will you stay?”
Footsteps sounded on the stairs once more, and Dean frowned, wondering who else might be coming here at this hour. Benny took a step forward, hand straying to the sword at his hip, deliberately placing himself between Dean and whoever was approaching. From behind his imposing bulk, Dean could not see anything but the flickering light of another lantern growing gradually brighter. Then Benny’s shoulders relaxed, his hand hanging freely at his side as he stepped back.
“Christ.” Dean shook his head. “Can’t believe you’re still hanging around my sorry ass after all this time.”
Dean lets out a surprised sound. More than ever, he’s convinced this is all a product of his imagination, the result of hitting his head against the tree. But Castiel’s lips are warm and soft, slightly chapped as they move over Dean’s, and his heart is pounding loudly enough for Dean to hear it thumping in the scant space between their bodies.
Donna narrows her eyes at him, clearly not fooled by this blatant lie, but then shrugs. “I’ll take all the help we can get.”
. The French word for werewolf, but also more than that.” Dean reaches behind him to close the door, and Cas tightens his grip on the gun. “Like you saw, we transform into actual wolves. And most importantly, we don’t eat hearts, human or animal.”
“You can come with us,” Lafitte offered.
He looks puzzled at the question, but Theo answers readily enough. “Yeah. It’s bigger than this little slice of the middle of nowhere. More bars, more people to meet.”
Dean ends the call, and Cas closes his eyes, bracing his arms on the kitchen counter and folding forward, head down. He gives himself a minute to let the violent storm of his emotions settle, then straightens up, squaring his shoulders. Dean accepted his invitation. The first step of his plan was a success. Now, on to the much harder part.
Castiel frowned, eyes wandering to the ice sculptures lining the sides of the room. Plenty, for all they knew, was everywhere and nowhere at once. How could they summon it to them now?
Castiel grimaced, pushing a hand through his hair. “Yes,” was all he said, confirming Dean’s unspoken suspicions. Two very different kingdoms, two very different kings, and two very different deaths.
“It’s late now.” Castiel glanced at the clock on the wall. “Perhaps tomorrow?”
“It’s perfect,” Dean says quietly. “Thank you, Rufus.”
She really was lovely when she smiled, and a faint flush stained her fair skin as she accepted. After a few more polite remarks, Dean moved away to allow the ladies to converse with some of their acquaintances. As much as he did not wish to think of Milton, he would keep an eye on his sisters in the duke’s absence. They were bright, charming young ladies, and while his betrothal to Milton might be fake, his fondness for them was not.
“That’s good.” Dean nods, taking a sip of his beer. He puts it down, then picks it right back up again. “I mean, I sort of knew you wouldn’t leave if they were still having a really rough time, but--”
Cas nods, then follows Hannah out of the classroom and into the office to grab their things before leaving the building. They nod goodnight to the security guards roaming the halls and emerge into the late-summer night. Cas breathes in deeply, his own adrenaline levels slowly settling. His body is tired from the long night running around the aquarium, ensuring everything was going smoothly, but his mind is wide-awake.
Dean can’t deny that he’s tired, but the tent seems so far away, and Castiel’s arms are warm and strong around him. “I’m good here,” he says.
“How do you plan to dress King Dean?” he asked, hoping the conversation would distract him from his discomfort.
“Come in,” he called out. It was likely Charlie or Victor, who had been assigned to watch over him in rotating shifts. He appreciated their visits even if they did serve to remind him of the strange position he occupied here, neither welcome guest nor total prisoner.
The door groans open, revealing a surprisingly spacious interior. To their left is an open kitchen and dining area, and to their right, a parlour furnished with plush chairs that will probably be quite comfortable once they’ve been aired out. Towards the back of the house is a door that Dean assumes leads to a bedchamber, and a shiver of anticipation runs down his spine at the sight of it.
Dean laughs, and strangely, Castiel finds himself wishing he had been the one to provoke that response from him. “It’s never boring here,” he boasts. “Archery, riding, singing, dancing-- we will have the most glorious summer ever.”
Another pause. “Identify confirmed. Please hold.”
A small frown crossed Hannah’s face, but she nodded. “You make a solid argument, Lord Winchester.”
“Goodnight, Dean,” Castiel says pointedly.
“Who was?” Castiel mumbles, having drifted into a sort of semi-conscious state himself.
There was no mistaking the hurt that flashed across Milton’s features, but he composed himself swiftly. In truth, it was an error on Dean’s part. Milton owed him nothing. This betrothal was a sham he had committed to for a certain length of time, and if Dean happened to have made a muddle of himself over it, that was his problem alone. Milton had been nothing but friendly and cordial and generous with him. It was not his fault Dean was tortured by thoughts of what it might be like to kiss him again, to sing him to sleep at night, to spend long lazy days swimming in the lake and making love on the shore.
Dean’s incredulous expression only deepens as he watches Ash saunter over to the next table. “You get used to him,” Cas assures him.
Cas rubs at his forehead and pulls his notes closer to himself. “If this is connected to those earlier deaths, we’re looking at two possible scenarios. One, the werewolf from Caribou is here now, and suddenly started killing again after years of silence. Or they managed to bite someone else, who lives here now and killed Ryan Garland.”
It’s going to be torture, holding him so close and being forced to keep his hands in respectable places, but Dean will survive. Bowing, he holds out his hand, and with a fond shake of his head, Castiel takes it.
So Dean just holds Cas’ gaze and nods, a brief dip of his head. An acknowledgment, and maybe a goodbye. Then, with a deep inhale, he turns and leaves the restaurant.
A second later, Cas’ hands close around his, guiding him to place the candle back on the table. “You didn’t say what you wished for.”
“I am sorry,” he says. The words are inadequate, he knows, but he offers them regardless. “Dean--”
“Yes.” Cas doesn’t look up.
He turns away, and Castiel takes a step backwards, nearly tripping over the trapdoor. He climbs down the ladder with measured steps, but the instant he reaches the stairs, he breaks. Heart racing, he flees back to his chambers, locking the door tightly behind himself.
Laughing, Dean reaches out for his hand, and Cas meets him halfway. “Probably,” Dean agrees. “But that’s not my point. My point is, we can’t control the way we feel, no matter how damn hard we might try. The only thing we can control is what we do about it.”
“You couldn’t have just broken the curse? Gone to confession?”
“Elizabeth. She owns the diner in town, and she was out for a run early in the morning before work. His phone was ringing, and she followed the sound.”
“Surely you would have preferred that,” Castiel replied.
“I know.” Castiel pressed another kiss to his lips. “I find myself reluctant to let you do so.”
“To new friends,” Dean echoed, a slight stress on the last word. His eyes met Castiel’s across the distance between them, the candlelight reflected in their depths. “To late nights, and to early mornings.”
“I was just out, walking. I do that sometimes. And before you ask, no, I was in the opposite direction of the main road. I didn’t hear or see anyone else.”
“Who am I to stand between a lady and her chocolate?” Dean grins and waves their server over to request the fudge cheesecake he noticed on the menu earlier. As she smiles and turns away, moving out of Dean’s direct line of sight, he looks across the room and meets a very familiar pair of eyes.
“Right?” Dean takes another sip of his beer, relaxing against the back of his chair. “He’s a good kid, though. Bounced around a few different jobs, and now he’s finishing up vet school.”
“Crowley.” She dipped her head in acknowledgement. “What game are you playing?”
“Sure.” Dean nods. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone, but it’s dead. Without Cas around to text all the time, he’s been lazy about keeping it charged. “Wait. Can I borrow your phone?”
“As were our kingdoms,” Dean pointed out. “Just because something has always been one way does not mean it must remain so.”
“Step back,” the voice instructed. “Hands on the wall behind you. If you make any move, you will be dead before you have a chance to attempt escape.”
His fingers hover over the button, unsure. He could just change the description in his profile, leave the account open, maybe start talking to people in earnest. But for all his soul-searching tonight, he knows he isn’t ready for that. He’s still hung up on Cas, and Cas has moved on.
He breaks off, remembering how proud his father had been, telling all their friends that his youngest son was going to join the priesthood. “I loved it,” he says softly. “I was assigned a position at a small church only a few hours away from where I grew up. The congregation wasn’t large, but it was faithful, and I enjoyed getting to know them. I felt helpful, and I felt needed, and I felt I was doing God’s work.”
“I know, I was just”-- Castiel clenches his jaw-- “distracted.” He looks around the room, his posture radiating tension. “Have you seen Jack?”
He lowers his voice and bends down to whisper into Rowena’s ear, “Most of it, at least. Why we are here, but not who-- or what-- I am.”
“Do you ever take anything seriously?” Castiel burst out. “Good God, man, you are going to find yourself slapped with a glove one of these days. You may be an excellent shot, but so might your opponent. You’re going to get yourself killed with this reckless attitude, and then I’ll be out of this mess.”
“That sounds wonderful.” Dean had forgotten how different Castiel sounds when he’s talking to Jack, how soft and amused his voice can go without losing any of its authority. “But for now, let’s begin with how you all ended up here.”
He ushered the three girls towards the stairs, placing himself at their backs as they crept out. Risking one glance to see if Krissy had made it down, he felt a solid weight connect with his back and let out a surprised grunt as he crashed to his knees, hands scraping against the wooden floor.
Kevin made a non-committal noise in reply. “I fear it won’t be that simple. Despite my proven record, there are some at court who disagree with everything I propose on mere principle. And currently, there are many who would like nothing better than to see your head separated from your body.”
The voice revealed itself to belong to a slight young woman, her red hair glinting like fire in the bright light. In one hand, she carried a flask of water, and in the other, a wickedly sharp blade pointed directly at him. Castiel held himself still, eyes locked on hers. Apparently satisfied with his cooperation, she placed the flask on the ground and beat a hasty retreat.
Milton smiled. “You charm them without them even being present.”
“The kissing, though.” Alicia raised an eyebrow and gave a nod of what might have been respect. “That’s new.”
“Good, because I’m betting you’ve got one hell of a long memory.” Dean pulled the menu towards himself and examined it. “I’m also guessing you have no preferences about what I order.”
“Both.” Castiel passes Dean and pushes open the heavy door leading out into the courtyard. “But there aren’t many of them, and no particularly skilled trackers. If I send a rider back to Dysland--”
They’re quiet as they set up their camp, but they move around each other with practiced ease. It’s only been a handful of days, somehow, but Dean feels like he and Castiel have been wandering these woods for a lifetime.
Castiel crashes through the forest, calling out for him, and Dean spares one glance his way before continuing his search. He wishes he could explain so Castiel could help him look, but communication isn’t exactly his forte at the moment. Speed and dexterity are reasonably high on his list of skills, though, and he puts them both to good use as he darts through the trees, hoping the early morning sun will glint off the small, distinctively-coloured berries.
“No, man, you don’t have to--”
“Very well.” With a sharp nod, the queen sits up straight on her throne. “You will go to the barracks and assemble the full force of the guard. I will make the announcement to those assembled here, and the guards off-duty will join us there presently.” Her voice turns to pure steel. “We will not rest until my daughter and the prince are safely home.”
Charlie shook her head, the sunlight glinting off her red hair. “It isn’t so simple anymore, my lord. The world itself is changing. Calorna and Hiemere are not the only two lands, and they are no longer enemies. What happens there is happening to us as well, just taking different forms. For better or for worse, we’re all in this together.”
Puppies of assorted sizes and shapes, barking and tumbling all over themselves as they dodge and weave around the ankles of Dean’s teammates. Dean blinks and rubs his hand roughly over his eyes, but the scene doesn’t change.
A slow, teasing smirk spread across Benny’s face. “That handsome, is he?”
Dean doesn’t bother to dignify that with a reply, arching an eloquent eyebrow at Cas instead. Both of them are trespassing here, and they both know it.
Castiel laughs, as he is clearly expected to do, but there is no humour in it. He is not human, and if Dean knew that, knew why he wanted this tour of the castle’s hidden places, he would likely be far less warm towards him.
“Probably,” Benny agrees. “So don’t tell him I said that, alright?”
“Sorry, Agent,” Kevin offers with a grimace. “All we can tell you is that Ryan made calls to that number before. Not often, but seven times over the past two years. And now, suspiciously, that number is no longer in use.”
“This is as far as I came,” he said, voice pitched low. Craning his neck to the side, Castiel could see the trail bending around a large cluster of stone, but could not determine how much further it went. “Do we proceed?”
“Hmn.” Dean still looked rather suspicious. “Am I to assume there were threats made against your own safety, should mine be compromised in any way?”
By the time they’ve packed up and are headed back to the office, Dean is running on adrenaline. The second he’s in the van, he removes his bowtie and throws it aside, ignoring the strange look Max gives him.
She shrugs helplessly. “Not that I can recall.”
“That’s much less entertaining, as far as personal trivia goes.”
“Let me--” he said instead, gesturing down towards Dean’s hands. Catching his meaning, Dean stripped the gloves from his hands, shifting his weight as he did. Castiel could see the bulge of his erection under his trousers, and Dean lost no time pulling them down over his hips and baring himself to Castiel’s gaze.
“Yes,” Castiel whispered. “Just like that. You are so gorgeous, I--”
Dean opened his mouth, then thought better of it. If they were going to do this, then they might as well do it properly. He found Sam in the crowd and raised his eyebrows meaningfully, watching as comprehension dawned on Sam’s face and he made a quick gesture with his left hand, the sunlight gleaming off the gold-and-topaz ring he wore there.
Dean wanted nothing more than to swing down from his horse, take two steps forward, and pull Milton into a kiss. From the look on his face, Milton was considering the exact same thing. If they both wanted it, surely, it couldn’t be a bad thing?
It isn’t Balthazar. It’s Hannah, though she sounds wretched, her voice weak and rough. “Cas? I’m so sorry, I know it’s your day off. But would you be able to cover me today? I woke up feeling awful.”
A faint flush appears in Dean’s cheeks. “And you say I’m the charming one.”
Dean points a finger in her direction. “I always knew you were a smart woman. Yes, Prince Jack and Castiel are on their way here. Once we’re all together, we need a discreet way to bring the prince and princess home.”
“How did you know?” Castiel asked quietly.
“I am,” Castiel assured him. “It’s simply--” He shrugged, unsure how to explain himself.
Dean remembered the look of shock on Castiel’s face, the way his eyes had widened as the ledge crumbled beneath them. The sound of Castiel shouting his name as they fell, and the sudden stop to their descent, the landing knocking the breath from his body. Castiel had been right beside him, but now--
“Yes.”
Dull pain radiated from the centre of Dean’s body, spreading outwards through his limbs. He winced as he attempted to pull himself upright, hands scrabbling on the hard ground. A jagged piece of rock sliced into his palm and he hissed, drawing back in on himself. Inhaling slowly, he rose to his feet, peering into the darkness that enveloped him.
Dean was well aware of that. He sighed, fighting to keep his own smile in check. “Whatever. Just clean up after yourselves, alright?”
“What is your real name?”
“Of course.” Elizabeth stands and walks him to the door. He’s already on the porch when she calls after him. “It was an animal attack, though, wasn’t it? What else could you have questions about?”
Reluctantly, Castiel looks back over his shoulder.
“Trying something new,” Cas answers.
Dean gives him a wry look. There are hazards to working with people who know you so well. “Yeah, I’m fine. Well. Not really. Cas’ sister-in-law died last night, and I dropped him off the airport for the first flight to Chicago this morning.”
“Awesome.” Dean gets to his feet and gently pushes Cas back down when he moves to follow. “Nah, you stay here. Relax. I’m going to get us a refill, and the rest of that pie, and then we’re just going to hang out.”
He laughs, but the high of the makeover is already wearing off. He almost doesn’t recognize himself in that picture, or in the boldness of the caption. Social media always casts an aspirational lens on your life, he knows, but it’s never left him with this hollow ache in his chest, wondering how he can make the attitude he sees in that photograph both real and lasting.
He does another circuit of the house and the clearing around it just to be sure, peering in the garage windows and listening intently for any hint of activity. He hears nothing, so he picks the padlock on the garage door and eases it open as quietly as he can.
With a slight smile, Anna nodded. “True.”
Once Castiel adjusted, he began to move his own hand again, their gazes locked as they twisted and crooked and brought each other wicked, delicious delights. Sweat ran in beads down Castiel’s temples, a flush starting at his cheeks and running all the way down his chest. He looked decadent, debauched, and decidedly un-ducal. This was Castiel, stripped bare. And all for Dean.
“I’m no good for anything long-term,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice light. “That point has been driven home loud and clear.”
He looks at Sam until his gaze is reluctantly drawn back. “You must change me back.”
“You would,” Cas agrees.
“There’s no way this isn’t related to Ryan’s death, is there?” he asks.
His reaction made little sense to Castiel, but then again, Dean had an endless capacity for surprising him. “I resisted purchasing an automobile for a long time,” he explained as he opened the door for Ruby. “Balthazar finally convinced me, and this was what was popular at the time. I’ve never needed to replace it, so I haven’t.”
Cas settles back in his seat with a small smile. “The aquarium.”
“But it was no prince, no knight, no bold adventurer come to her aid. It was a old woman, in dusty robes, riding a broken-down mare. The princess was disappointed, and though she was bitter, she invited the woman inside and offered her shelter, for she would appreciate any company, no matter how poor. The old woman accepted, and once inside, she transformed herself into an equally beautiful young woman, smiling at the princess with pride and satisfaction. ‘You have proven true, despite the bitterness in your heart,’ she said. ‘And for this, you will be rewarded.’ Stooping, she placed a kiss upon the princess’ brow, and her power flowed between them. With a trembling hand, the princess brought the walls of her prison crumbling down around her, and she walked free, never to look back.”
“Someone who’s probably regretting it,” Jamie says philosophically, finishing her drink. “Excuse me a moment, will you?”
“Nonsense,” Donna says cheerfully as she comes to collect their mugs. “You always have a place here, Bobby, but as your friend, I say you should go.” She rests her hand on Bobby’s shoulder and gives it an encouraging squeeze.
Dean’s knees nearly gave out on him. Clutching at the back of a chair for support, he made a strangled noise of surprise. “What did it say?”
“Ask her to dance,” he whispers.
Guilt flashes across Claire’s face. “Kaia says she’s been dreaming about me. She can feel it, because she’s so connected to me.”
“Demonstrating what, exactly?” Dean reached out and righted the leaning tower of muffin tins.
Castiel huffs a laugh. “We finally have proper tents and bedrolls, and you want to sleep on the rough ground again?”
And Castiel does.
That small slip must have renewed Marv’s commitment, because he didn’t move again for another ten minutes. Castiel’s hand flexed at his side, opening and closing a rhythmic motion. Suddenly, his shoulders spasmed as he bent forward at the waist, and Marv let out a triumphant sound.
so until much later tonight.”
“But it was just the icing on the cake?” Cas’ tone is light, but there’s still a hint of wariness in his eyes.
“Good evening,” he said.
“My niece.” A brief smile lights up Cas’ face. “My twin brother’s daughter.”
“Let’s go tell them the good news,” he says.
“Something like that.” Castiel pressed himself closer, feeling Dean’s heart beating thunderously in his chest. “May I kiss you, Dean?”
Dean nodded. It was a common predicament for those who had served under Sam’s command, cast adrift by the peace treaty with Hiemere. Many of them had found new livelihoods, but others-- “She has a place among the Royal Guard, if she wishes it.”
Billie raised one eyebrow, her look suddenly stern. “And do not forget that you are not the only one who is suffering,” she added. At Castiel’s frown of incomprehension, she sighed and waved in the direction of the palace. “Go to him. Care for him while you can. We both know you will have to let him go, and soon.”
“Yes.” Winchester nodded, then made an aborted move forward. “At Rexford.”
“It is not only me they are looking at.” Castiel takes this opportunity to allow his own eyes to travel slowly down Dean’s body, clothed in borrowed finery from Balthazar’s vast wardrobe. “You do look rather splendid, you know.”
As he seals up the deposit bag, Dean catches sight of the white bakery box Charlie brought back from Benny’s earlier in the afternoon. Grinning, Dean composes a quick text.
Their sighs of relief are quickly drowned out in cheers. Cas exchanges a smile with Hannah, who shakes her head at his tactics but joins in the applause anyway.
It’s difficult to argue with that, and Cas can’t deny that he would welcome Dean’s presence today of all days. Within fifteen minutes, they’re headed into town.
Jimmy shifts his weight from side to side. “Maybe--” he hesitates, looking unusually shy. “Maybe we could watch a movie?”
“Absolutely not.” Dean rises from the table, scowling. “You expect me to sit behind a closed door with several flights of stairs between us and wait for it all to be over?”
“We shouldn’t have to,” Dean replies. His shoulders are set in stubborn lines, his jaw tight. “I can’t do it, Cas. I can’t marry someone else.”
“I know.” Cas swallows roughly. “I thought, if anyone, it was Camille. She was the one who left town, and I thought it was a sign of her guilt.”
“Jack.” His cousin stepped forward immediately, youthful face creased in concern. “Your teachers at the academy, might they be able to fashion some sort of purification system? A filter, perhaps?”
“Perhaps the occasional visit for appearance’s sake.” Castiel gave a bitter little laugh. “A marriage in name only.”
“Now that will be an adventure,” Castiel comments. “I’ve never met Queen Amara, but I hear she’s rather intimidating.”
After the initial flurry of surprise had passed, he and Milton had returned to the ballroom and danced the next set together. There was a polite smile on Milton’s face, but his shoulders were stiff under Dean’s hands, and they hadn’t spoken a single word to one another. The instant the music stopped, Milton had made him a perfectly correct bow and passed him to his next partner. By the time Dean was free, Milton had left.
“Those forty minutes will feel like an eternity.” Castiel swallowed his sip of wine deliberately slowly, watching Dean’s eyes darken with desire and feeling his own body stir in response.
The moment Winchester started singing, he understood.
“Fine.” The tension drains from Castiel’s body as he sighs. “Clearly, you know something that I don’t.” Adjusting the strap on his satchel, he takes a decisive step towards Dean, then another. “Lead the way, Winchester.”
“All of us.” Dean tosses a casual arm around Castiel’s shoulder, squeezing him close. “For the whole summer, just like you’ve spent this one here.”
He cleared his throat and said, “We need to talk further. But not here.”
Cas sits up straighter on his stool, the second whiskey forgotten. “What?”
Dean shakes his head and uses one finger to tilt Cas’ chin up. His eyes are bright, sparkling with amusement, and Cas can’t help smiling in response. “If I wanted to make a point,” Dean murmurs, “I’d do this.”
“I know.” Charlie shrugged moodily. “She says she means no offense to what I do, but that the Guard simply isn’t for her. All I’ve ever wanted was for her to be safe and happy, and while she’s certainly a great deal safer now that we’re no longer at war, sometimes I worry she’s far less happy.” She shook her head. “How odd, to be discontent in a time of peace. But I understand it, and I do not know how to help her.”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
He can see Dean struggling to make sense of it, and he doesn’t fault him for it. Dean was the first person Castiel told about being ace, way back in college. For almost as long as they’ve known each other, Dean has seen him a certain way, and now Castiel is complicating that.
With a sigh, he turns to head back into the protection of the forest. Just as he does, he catches a glimpse of glowing eyes, peering out from the trees.
Cas looks around the room, all the familiar faces lit up with the simple comfort of a shared meal and shared memories in the making. It’s strange, seeing everything from the centre of the table rather than the far end where he would normally seat himself. Strange, but kind of nice. He’s grown so accustomed to thinking of change as a negative thing, associating it with the darkness of his past, that he’s forgotten how untrue that really is. Just as the moon waxes and wanes, his life has changed and will continue to change both for better and for worse, and it’s the balance that makes it beautiful.
“Please.” Castiel sank into a seated position, heedless of the cold stone below him. It grounded him, kept him focused and alert. Billie did the same, arranging her robes around her and gazing at him with wide, untroubled eyes.
King James lived another five years before a winter chill stole his life. Even if he had survived the boar’s attack, John Winchester wouldn’t have been able to save him from that.
The attendants brought in more wood, adding it to the roaring fire. Dean passed a hand over his sweating face and wiped it on his thin silk shirt, already ruined by the heat. Heat was what they knew in the eternally warm land of Calorna, but not like this. This was not natural for them, but neither was the wound that was slowly leaching the warmth and the life from King John’s body.
Cas pulls his lower lip between his teeth, considering. Bowling was much more fun than he had anticipated, not only because of Dean’s company but because of the familiarity of it. He hadn’t realized just how much he missed it until he was there, the familiar sound of the pins crashing and the cheesy graphics on the screen every time he bowled a strike.
“I hope you’re doing well,” he continues. “And Jimmy and Claire. I mean that, really. That’s the reason you ended things, right? So I hope it was all worth it.” He takes a deep breath, fighting down the urge to yell, to rant. Cas isn’t even on the other end of the line, so what good would it possibly do? “Anyway. The girl I borrowed this phone from is coming back.” There. Let Cas make of that what he will. “Call me if you’re back in town, okay?” He almost says
The light behind Dean’s eyes dims slightly, but he nods. “I understand. After all”-- he grins, mischievous again-- “it is human nature to be curious.”
He doesn’t really know what he’s looking for. Another bloody shirt? Other abandoned pieces of clothing? Some sort of evidence that can be used to persuade Dean to talk, at least. But he finds nothing. There’s a trail of sorts, or at least some ground that is more packed down than the rest, and he follows it for a while, heading deeper and deeper into the woods. Eventually, he gives up and turns back the way he came, pushing branches out of his way with bad-tempered force.
“The first round is always on me, since you’re always late,” Castiel points out.
“And you’ve lived here alone for the past ten.”
Krissy watched them go, an unreadable look on her face. Wincing, Dean took two steps closer to her, one hand on the wall for support. “Hey,” he said. “You okay?”
Only then does Dean drop his gaze, eyes sweeping slowly from the top of Castiel’s head all the way to his feet and then back up. “I’m one hell of a lucky guy,” he murmurs with a crooked smile.
It is with some relief, then, that they depart for the country in the first week of June. The stress melts away from Castiel’s face with every mile they put between themselves and London, and Dean rejoices to see it. The entire purpose of holding the wedding outside London was to make Castiel more comfortable, and though Dean knows he would never voice a complaint out loud, the past few weeks have taken a toll on him.
But Dean was right about one thing. If there are answers to be found about why Ryan was in the woods that night, Dean isn’t the one to provide them.
There’s nothing suggestive in his tone, but Dean shivers regardless. Involuntarily, he glances down, relieved to note the absence of a ring on Cas’ left hand. It doesn’t mean he’s single, or that he’s interested, but it’s a good thing to check.
Smiling to himself at the memory, Dean said, “It would not be polite for me to monopolize all your time, would it? You have guests to greet.”
“Yes,” he says.
Dean turned and looked at him, eyes wide. Castiel shrugged and said, “We’ve come this far already. We may as well proceed. But cautiously.”
“I don’t understand--”
Dean honestly wasn’t sure how to answer that. But his mom was whispering softly to Billie, her eyes alight in a way Dean hadn’t seen them in years. Claire had slipped back over to stand beside Kaia, reaching down to take her hand. Sam and Ruby were laughing about something Dean didn’t catch, and Naomi was talking to the official in white, throwing proud glances over her shoulder at Castiel. Castiel, who was here, a little worse for wear but
Donna stares at it for a moment, then slowly shakes her head. “No. He was still fully clothed when we found him, though it was all torn up. This--” she indicates the shirt dangling loosely in one of her hands-- “this came off somebody else.”
Keeping a hand on him, Castiel leaned down to press a kiss right above the base of his cock. Dean’s hips rose sharply off the bed, and Castiel soothed him with a soft hand down his flank. Instinctively, Dean’s legs spread wider, and Castiel swallowed roughly at the image he presented, so impatient and inviting.
She lets out a delicate snort, and before Dean can draw back, her fiery hot tongue sweeps over his face in what is clearly a gesture of both affection and forgiveness.
Jo shrugs. “Steady. Nothing major.”
“Thank you,” she replied, eyes dancing. “In truth, I had admired the instrument when you first showed us this room, and I’m honoured to have been granted the opportunity to play on it.”
“You do plenty,” Benny says firmly. “I know for a fact Cas is going to need you to lean on, and you’re going to be right there for him, just like you’re right there for everyone else. And you don’t love the rest of us the way you love that boy.”
“The other day, at the coffee shop.” His voice is thick with emotion, and it’s difficult to speak under the burning intensity of Dean’s gaze, but he does his best. “You said I should ask you what it was that you wanted.” He takes a deep breath and spreads his hand in front of him on the table. “I’m asking you now, Dean. What do you want?”
“I hate that we had to ask Dean to give up his promise to Benny, or any possible future with anyone else. I hate that we couldn’t speak of it without being accused of seeking to supplant my father.” He spread his hands before Castiel in a gesture of helplessness. “But if it means an end to this blasted war, I would do it all again. Without hesitation.”
The wind hits him with the force of a blow, and Castiel staggers under its insistence. Wiping rain from his face, he squints upwards into the sky, where the occasional flash of lightning illuminates the top of the tower around him. It looks exactly the same as it has the two previous times Castiel has stood here, except--
The reaper smiles. “My name is Billie,” she says. “I wondered if we would meet again, little angel. I did not think it would be as part of my usual duties.”
“Thank god for that,” Hannah says fervently. “We’ll discuss it with Joshua tomorrow. He always has a different perspective.”
A reckless, foolish hope.
It was not enough-- far from it-- but it was what they had, and the now-steady stream of messengers and traders who crossed the mountains allowed them to maintain a lively correspondence even when they could not be in each other’s physical presence.
The warm water feels wonderful on his aching body. He wonders how long he was out in the snow before Dean found him. Despite the temperature, he shivers. Cas doesn’t pray anymore, but he does take a moment to direct his gratitude out into the universe. He’s having a hard time properly showing it to Dean, so he hopes this makes up for it.
“Really?” Castiel’s heart leaps in his chest at the thought. “Just the queen, or--”
Right into Milton, whose firm hand on his arm was the only thing that kept Dean from stumbling. His tea, however, had no such support, and a few drops sloshed dangerously close to the perfect white of Milton’s shirt.
“Make the suggestion to the council. They may have reservations about it, but they cannot prevent us from issuing the invitation.” Dean grinned at him and was pleased to see an answering smile spread across Castiel’s face. “It is, in some ways, good to be king.”
Rowena’s smile widens. “A pretty speech,” she says approvingly. “I will be sure to remember your generous offer.”
He sounds satisfied, just shy of smug, and turns back to Dean to wave him forward. “Your bath.”
With a firm nod, she rises from the table. “Alright, Cas. Does it seem a little too quiet to you? Maybe we should go check on them.”
Shaking his head, he gently places the cover back over the car and turns away. The rest of the garage appears to be devoted to storage, assorted tools and outdoor gear neatly arranged on shelves. Cas pokes around a bit but finds nothing to suggest any nefarious purpose.
Cas hesitates. As tempting as it sounds, he’s reluctant to step aside even for an afternoon. “I’m not sure--”
“Didn’t want to be presumptuous,” Dean says with a shrug. “Phone calls are a big deal these days.”
The neat rows of wooden pews, the wide processional aisle between them. The confessional booths tucked into the back corner, one door sagging off its hinges. At the opposite end, the altar, with the crucifix hanging above it.
Somewhat to his surprise, Dean doesn’t physically try to prevent him from leaving. He just watches, mouth set in a tight line, as Cas makes his way to the front door and struggles to pull it open. When he does, a pile of fluffy snow comes tumbling in, along with a rush of wind that sends Cas staggering back a step, his ankle turning painfully under him.
