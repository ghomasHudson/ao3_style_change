After some time, Sherlock was safely on the sofa. John started to go to work on the laceration after sterilizing the sewing needle on the stove.
I'm glad John didn't ask why I had to go in such an rush. I'd rather not tell him I don't go to this university.
His mom stood in the door way to ask if he wanted coffee, but stopped when she saw John cover Sherlock with a blanket. John smiled quietly to himself and tiptoed out of the sitting room.
Jim and the bartender half carried and half walked Sherlock to an office in the back of the club, where they sat him in an upholstered chair. It was a small dark office, crowded with a desk and supplies for the club. An outside door was marked "Exit". After the bartender made sure Sherlock was still breathing, he walked out of the room.
After an hour of trying, he gave up and sat down on a worn sofa in the lobby. Weary, he stared out the large windows that looked out on the empty street in front of the hospital, it was starting to snow. The street lamps were shining and made the snow flakes look like tiny glass crystals falling from the sky.
I got comfortable on the bed. The hash was in block form, wrapped in aluminium foil, brown. It crumbled a little when I broke a small piece off. I fitted it into the pipe and lighted it.
Wednesday night. My last night studying at John's before the hearing. The hearing--scheduled for Friday.
I wanted to memorize every inch of John- his muscles, his scars. I wanted to take my time, tracing every tan line with my tongue, but John was impatient. He's playful in bed, he tossed me on my back a few times, getting me laughing so hard my sides ached.
They walked into the hallway, John realized that there was yet another room, behind the first. He walked over and stood in the doorway dumbfounded.
Spent some time just walking the street, just gave a guess as to the direction they could have gone. It's cold, I can't imagine he'd be outside. There are several pubs near uni, they could be at any of them. I went into a few, nothing.
I was quiet, standing there with my arms crossed in front of me, angry. At this point, in my life, I could not articulate my thoughts and feelings. I looked over at John, who I'm sure could not imagine what I was playing at.
Sherlock wasn't in the flat and he wasn't with Lestrade. John hoped like hell Sherlock was with Mike Stamford. John didn't want to panic, perhaps he innocently went to Tescos.
"Yes, Mrs. H." Sherlock swung the door open wide and took John upstairs. He followed behind to steady him and make sure John didn't fall.
I'm almost back at school. I can make it to supper if I speed up a bit. I guess I better eat something. I can't remember the last time I ate.
I was busy regretting my bad decisions when Sherlock walked over with that inspector, getting me out of the handcuffs.
“A piece of shrapnel. Lately of Mike Stamford’s head and your kitchen floor.” Answered Sherlock quietly, thoughtfully.
Laying in pile of rubble with John on top of him, he never wanted to leave. Sherlock thought it couldn't get any hotter.
"John, wait up!" It was Molly--she ran to catch up with me. "How are you?" she said out of breath, smiling.
John could not quite lock onto Sherlock's words. He did not finish his dinner. He got up abruptly from the table and cleared his throat. "Sherlock, I need to sleep. I think I'll be better in the morning. I'm sorry."
When he could not get more depressed about this lack of self control, there was a knock at the door.
Still terrified, a suspicion started to dawn on John just at that moment. Sherlock fast asleep. Curtains moving, but no open window. He looked more critically at the kid standing before him. He wasn't dressed like the kids today, but a little more old fashioned. Short hair, patches on the knees of his trousers. No coat. A kid from the past. At that exact moment, John knew he was dreaming. OK, this made much better sense. No it didn't, not really.
"You haven't a friendly bone in your entire body." Sherlock, never a big drinker, was starting to feel the second pint. /p>
After Jim left, Irene turned on Sherlock. Eyeing the door nervously, she leaned over Sherlock with her hands on each arm of the chair and looked into his face. "I know your pretending, Sherlock."
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Get on with it, Mycroft, what do you really want?" Sherlock sat sideways in a sitting room chair, his back against he one arm and his legs draped over the other, gracefully eating with chopsticks.
"Look here," and he uses tweezers to extract the tiniest pink feather from the cut in the man's wrist and places it in a plasticine bag.
Finally at the flat, John took the steps two at a time to the top and stopped. He was out of breath, his heart hammering away in his chest. He would have to recover for quite a few minutes before being able to have a sensible conversation with Sherlock.
"Sorry Molly, I actually don't know a lot about Sherlock, really." I said (which was perfectly true) as we sat on the very duvet that Sherlock and I slept on the night before.
Once inside, I toss my books onto Victor's bed, still freshly made. After all, he won't be using it, he's not here this year and won't be coming back. Not after what happened.
He took a good look at himself in the mirror while he washed his hands. The tops of his cheeks were a high pink from drinking and his black curls were an unruly mess. The top few buttons of his shirt were open and there was a slight sheen of sweat on his neck and collarbones, the club was stifling.  He buttoned a few buttons, there--that was better.
Ordinarily, he tried his best to avoid Jim Moriarty because he just couldn't fathom what his motivation was. Jim made his skin crawl. Last year, he spent far more time with Jim than he should have, but he had no other dealer so accessible.  Sherlock was quite aware that drugs were a pretty poor coping mechanism, but here he was.
Mike became quiet when asked about Sherlock. He looked down at his shoes, hesitating. But Liz jumped in before he could formulate a reply.
he stood up, walked away from me and tossed the gloves in the bin. "You could go to hospital for something like that."
On a particularly cold night, John slipped away from Mary to ring the flat, if Sherlock answered, John could just hang up, but he never did. Mary got a glimpse of John coming in the front door of the pub, eyes watery and nose red from the cold.  "John were you outside? You’re freezing! Whatever were you doing?"
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I'm sure this wont last, either. I consider myself lucky it happened at all. I doubt it will be repeated.
He glanced at John under his lashes over the rim of the teacup. The boy sitting across was young--about 19, Sherlock thought, but had a few worry lines on his face that should not be there. He could've avoided this scenario entirely, not offered to meet, but John did barge in to the safe house to track him down. Sherlock assumed, rather correctly, that a bloke like John would not give up too easily.
It was a big thing, too. Maybe enormous. Not something that's easy to say. He might take it as an accusation. But I'm not wrong, I'm sure of it.
When the boys got back to the flat, they had a visitor. Opening the door, they saw a large amount of packages filling the flat. Who had been there while they were out? The kitchen was full of food in take out boxes and bags of groceries. In the sitting room was an impeccably dressed young man who stood up as they entered. John wondered how he had gotten in.  Especially with all those packages.
Mary and Sherlock seemed to get along. Mary was asking him questions about what residence hall he lived in and he was being dodgy, like usual. I laughed to myself, I knew he wasn't gong to answer her.
I closed the door and out of absolutely nowhere, started to have a panic attack. My heart started to beat hard and the floor was uneven under my feet. I sat back down on the bed and put my head in my hands. I needed to eat, maybe my blood glucose was low after drinking so much last night.
At this point John was close to tears, he thought again of going back into the hospital lobby to warm up and try to call again. Leaning back against he bench, he looked at the sky. This was a monumentally stupid idea. Just to think that anyone would see him was ridiculous. And who? How could he communicate?     Why wouldn't Sherlock answer the phone back at the flat? Where could he be?
He failed to realize Sherlock had woken up, and next thing he knows, his newspaper is snatched from his hands, and a grown man is straddling his lap.
The doctor nodded and said "I saw him, and I thought it was perfect. Detective Pusheen, working hand in hand, solving crimes with the worlds greatest and only consulting detective, the ever so brilliant, my Baby Boy, Mister Sherlock Holmes...You really like it?"
The younger man nodded and said "I'll save it for Sherlock then. Speaking of which, where is my little brother?"
Mycroft nodded and said "Gladly. Actually, I was looking to speak with you John, if you don't mind."
He paused, watching for any reaction from his baby boy, since he loves his growing collection of stuffies, before adding "Or...Would he rather come back and sit on Daddy's lap and tell him all about his little conclusion and be spared of any punishment, since Daddy loves his Little One very much?"
He chuckled and turned in his chair to look at Sherlock, who was looking through their fridge. He stood up and asked "What was that, Young man?" His tone playful but stern.
He's heard a lot about some Japanese cartoon cat called Pusheen. He's looked it up, and Pusheen is adorable. Cutest little cartoon fat cat the Doctor has ever seen.
The doctor nodded and smiled. "They do, Baby, they have plenty more. And I shall not rest until my Bug has all the Pusheen merchandise, the world has to offer. If that's what it takes."
When he got home from the office, he greeted Mrs. Hudson before going upstairs to his bug. When he walked in, he called out. "Sherlock? Sherlock, Love, I'm home! Sherlock?"
Mycroft turned and John smiled. He stepped forward and said "I uh...I'm going to ask him to marry me."
Mycroft smiled a little and shrugged. "That isn't up to me, Doctor Watson...But I believe he would say yes." Before heading downstairs.
The consulting detective examined the cat, and John became nervous. He prays he doesn't think it's stupid. But his nerves disappeared when a huge grin slowly spread across his face. Sherlock's smile is the world, but only when he genuinely smiles. This smile is one of those smiles.
The genius didn't answer, so John urged him by tickling at his sides, making him laugh and squirm. "Come on, come on gorgeous, whose Daddy's Little Bug? Whose his Baby Boy, huh?"
John sat down next to me and Mycroft turned to him. He said "You of all people would know that my dear brother can be...Difficult. Ridiculous, and so forth."
Sherlock smiled and continued drawing, even as the older man started kissing him. He kissed the top of Sherlocks hair, on his cheeks, on his neck, and the younger man chuckled. He shrugged away and said "Stop it!"
The doctor nodded and said "Noted. Is there anything else? Any other threat? I'm open for suggestions."
Now don't tell me the ever so brilliant Sherlock Holmes, Daddy's very good boy has forgotten something like that, now has he?"
John could see that. He fears that too, but ever since they became friends, and started dating, his worries are all but gone. He loves Sherlock, no one will ever have a greater place on John's heart than Sherlock. He nodded and quietly said "I know...He isn't the only one."
The younger man's lips went down into a small frown, and narrowed his eyes at him. He was quiet for a brief moment before he groaned and got off the older mans lap. "Damn you." Was muttered from the kitchen, and it almost missed John's ears.
The doctor stopped and smiled. "That's right...And he loves his little future overlord...With all his heart." Leaning in and stealing a kiss from Sherlocks lips. "I love you." Another kiss.
Sherlock pecked him back and said "I love you too. Would you like to color with me, Daddy? We could move to the kitchen, there's plenty of uncolored pages, and I could help you with what colors to put for everything, if you'd like."
, I have seen a great change in him. And you would know I have seen Sherlock before and after you came into the picture."
He looked up at the doctor and said "Aww, Daddy...He's adorable!...Wait a minute...Oh dear Lord, he's got that stupid hat! Now I'm not the only one, I hate that God awful thing."
The consulting detective poured himself some juice in his favorite little cup with an elephant decal on it, ignoring the older man. But before he could repeat his request, the younger man turned to face him and asked "Yes?" Before taking a sip.
Sherlock was asleep in their bedroom, while John was in the kitchen. He heard someone coming up the stairs and when he looked, he saw Mrs. Hudson. She smiled and said "John, Dear. You have a visitor." They turned and looked to see Mycroft behind her.
John held back a laugh and said "I'd be careful if I were you, she might spit in yours." Knowing she isn't too fond of him, especially with the way he's treated her.
John pretended to think for a moment. "Hmmm...That's strange, because I could've sworn I just heard my Baby Boy use a naughty word."
The doctor smiled and said "Your welcome, my Love." He leaned down and pecked him on the lips. "I love you."
The consulting detective smiled and said "And I love you." Kissing him back when he went for a third. They spent the next few minutes kissing and giggling before John pulled away, kissing Sherlocks forehead and doing the same for Reginald, before holding his bug close once again.
When he looked up Pusheen stuffies, there were so many that he would get for his Little Bug in a heartbeat. But out of all the ones he saw, there was one that truly stood out. Every single one he's seen were all equally adorable, but when he laid eyes on Detective Pusheen, he knew. It was perfect. He's never ordered anything online so fast in his life.
Sherlocks smile grew and said "Yes, I know. Before, I despised the idea of marriage, but I am a believer in "the one", and if I ever found my "one", then I would marry them...And you, John Hamish Watson, are, and always have been, my "one"."
He chuckled and said "Actually, yes, I can imagine it...And I know you could do it someday, you're brilliant enough to, and I'd root for you, Love." And he means it. He could see the hope get brighter and seeing coming from the younger man, makes him so happy.
The consulting detecting smiled a little and said "Of course I'll marry you. It took you long enough. And before you ask, I haven't been listening the whole time...I came in when I heard you say you were gonna ask for my hand."
She nodded, and Mycroft said "I'd like one too, if you don't mind., Mrs. Hudson" She turned and scowled at the older Holmes brother, before going back downstairs.
The doctor smiled a little and said "I thank God every day that I'm friends with Mike Stamford. If it hadn't been for him introducing me to Sherlock, I'd be hobbling about London at various speeds with my psychosomatic limp, and would've ended up offing myself...Sherlock changed everything for me, and I love him."
I was allowed to see him the day before discharge. He was going to a rehab right here in London and I was hoping to visit, but still wasn't sure I'd be welcome.
I feel somewhat responsible having dragged Sherlock to the pub when he didn't want to go.   But I didn't know. I was operating on faulty information. I don't hold it against Sherlock at all. It's not something that you tell just anyone, really.
He's settled a bit. I take this chance to sit up and pull his jersey over his head. His father's metal tags clink and fall back against his chest.  Sitting up and facing him, I kiss him and caress his chest and nipples, working my way back up his neck. I trace my tongue just under the metal chain he wears, on the delicate skin of his neck. He gives out a small gasp. Time to take track pants off. I stand up and get rid of them, so does he. We are standing up, face to face and I reach for him. I take his face in my hands and kiss him. He reaches behind me and runs his hands over my arse. I place my hands on his shoulders and gently push him down on the bed. Neither of us has any clothes on. I pull the duvet over the both of us and lay to side of him and reach between his legs.
"Hey look, what I found for you!" John presented a brown paper sack to Harry. It was not pretty, but it'd do the trick, he knew.
"Pastime." added Sherlock, smacking both of the arms of the chair for emphasis and launching himself out of the chair. "I know." he said, into her ear and walking past her briskly, almost knocking her off her feet.
"I never find you alone, Sherlock. Until tonight. What happened to your boyfriend, John"? he opened the bottle and passed the opener to me.
Sherlock came back. Mary suddenly let go of me. There was a cold place on my bicep where her warm hand had been.
Flying down the steps, Sherlock ran out to the street. The sun was setting. In a few blocks he was at Tesco’s, where he could get what he wanted. In ten minutes, he was at university and in another five he was inside the locked university building.
A familiar buzz started in John's brain and  he roughly pulled Sherlock's shirttails out from his trousers. He lifted Sherlock's shirt up and grabbed him 'round the waist and pulled him closer.  Sherlock let out another a small, appreciative grunt as he ground himself against John and and playfully bit John's bottom lip.
John stared at the front of the hospital. The windows bright as the sun moved lower in the late April sky.
Listening quietly, he heard Sherlock walk into the loo and retch into the toilet. He let it go on for a minute or two, then got up to check.
There were no more sounds coming from Sherlock’s room. Mike did not provide John with any details of Sherlock's past nighttime excursions. John sat there, his mind reeling with questions that he was afraid to ask.
This is the final chapter. I'd like to thank everyone for reading this story and for the kind comments and advice in case I was going off the rails a bit. Please comment if you liked it and what you liked best.   I am a writer and I spend inordinate amounts of my time writing and plan to continue. Because it is problem I have, have always had.
Anytime they were together it was quick and hurried, always in fear of someone coming in. Today they could take their time, but right now no one wanted that.
I looked down at the old file, rifling through the old tattered pages, doubtful that I can find a solution to the critical mysteries of my life.
I was happy to help, although I thought it wasn't possible, really. Scratch that. Possible maybe, but not
His head and heart are aching. He ignores his growling stomach— no time for dinner, but thinks of his parents, keeping vigil at Harry’s bedside. Anger is a companion to his sorrow. He is angry both at Harry and himself.
I took the tube back to  Baker Street and walked the few blocks to the flat. I never let myself consider a relationship with John in any way but friendship--and even that was a reach. I'm not friendship material. I'm not even flat mate material. I toss my clothes on the floor, I do messy experiments on the kitchen table. I don't put the bins out.
“John!” She shouted running up to him. “Alright? You look like you didn’t sleep at all last night, mums gonna’ worry----you look like shite!” She laughed and slapped him on the shoulder.
"You know that I don't have friends." Sherlock mumbled into the pint that was third of the way gone./p>
Stamford was twitchy, looking around nervously, "John, this neighborhood is sketchy, probably smack heads and..."
I could hear John's footsteps out side the door. I also heard his metal key miss the lock a few times, drinking-obviously.
But Sherlock was positively lighthearted and in the best mood that I've seen him in, ever. He ordered a bottle of red wine.
the bloke from the A & E, wearing the same clothes, feet up on an ottoman. He looked up languidly from the book he was reading to address John.
"No." I closed the file, and stood. It was time to go, I wasn't going to get anywhere today. I reached for my coat.
As suddenly as it started, the wind stops and all is quiet. He takes his arms down and is surprised at the blinding sun. Moving his shoes against the ground, he can feel the crunch of sand underneath his feet. He knows this place. He is back in Kandahar.
I'm trying to answer his questions in that flirty manner that he has, but I'm abysmal at it. Do I have something else
I did see him on the one night that I accepted an offer to go to the pub with Seb and people from my floor, whose names I don't know.  I saw him before he saw me. I was halfway to pissed and couldn't feel my toes. I don't know how much alcohol I had that night, but I had been drinking pretty heavily. He was sitting with Mary. She always had her eye on him, I know. I wanted to go right on up to him and ask him to talk to me.  He looked happy, I thought, sitting there with Mary. That is, until he saw me--then he looked angry. John's pretty frightening when he's angry and not afraid to confront or hit someone in public. I've seen it.
"No, you're not sure." he says, staring down at me, eyes dark, serious. He's in my lap properly now and reaches around the small of my back to pull my shirttails out of my trousers. I'm sweating and my mind goes blank. He's rocking against me now. "All I'm sure of is that you are the most gorgeous fucking thing I've ever laid eyes on and I've never wanted anything the way I want you." By then, he had both of his hands working on the belt of my trousers.
Running into John in person just made me feel sadder. I watched him as he sat down in the booth with Mary. The pub lights shone on his blond hair, I couldn't miss him sitting there. He had on those blue jeans that I like on him, that make his arse look tight. But his broad shoulders were not defined at all in that shapeless beige jumper. That jumper has to go--
John had never seen him like this and did not get any suspicion from Mike that Sherlock went out at all. John had not seen him drink.
Sherlock gave John a good laugh--implying that he was holding onto an important piece of evidence because Scotland  Yard would 'muck up' an investigation.
John gave a small laugh.  “Can you tell me where the hell you were last night?? and--what you took. Were you drinking?”
The music was loud. Laser lights in every direction. I couldn't see the floor. I'm actually glad I had a few drinks before we got here. My headache was better.
John realizes now that Mary is in some kind of residential treatment facility, where she is being monitored and medicated. More of a half way house rather than a proper jail, he realizes.
"Never got a chance to talk to you." Shook his head. "Tried and tried, but--always thwarted." He squinted at me.  "You don't need protecting, do you?"
For one blessed moment John stopped laughing and looked up at Sherlock. He could see that John's pupils were enormous and completely obliterated the color of his iris. Beads of sweat covered his forehead. "God, we've got to get you..." Sherlock stopped when he realized he actually had no idea what to do. He hadn't planned for this.
"Sure," I said, confused. Having no idea what was going on, I followed him out the door, leaving three quarters of my pint on the table.
It was difficult. John had the same amount of alcohol that I had, but he was much more irrational. The bloke was on his back with John sat on top of him, beating him bloody. I recognized him from the loo. I was shouting, everyone was shouting. John wasn't budging. Maybe this bloke deserved the pounding, but didn't want John to kill him.
John sighed. It was pretty surreal, sitting here calmly discussing his sister's overdose with a complete stranger. At this point, he was trying to balance his anger with his need to get more information about what his sister was involved in. He tried not to speak through clenched teeth, "I'm worried," he put his tea cup in the saucer.
I ventured. He shrugged and looked away, staring into the fire.   I didn't ask him where he went or who he was with, because I didn't care. He's an adult.
“This is getting old. I know he had it. He showed it to me. I know he put it in your pocket. I was there, Sherlock, I have eyes.”
"So! This is the famous Sherlock Holmes!!" Mikes girlfriend, Liz said with am impish grin. With short dark hair and way too much makeup, Sherlock didn't think she really looked like Mike's type, but then he never paid attention before and didn't know what Mike's type was.
I'll have to come up with a better strategy than the one I have now to get away from school for so long without being missed.
"Well," Sherlock began, but was uncharacteristically unable to finish, as she guided him to a plush, curved booth and they sat down.
Sherlock stood directly in front of him. He looked pretty disheveled. Shirt pulled out from his trousers, halfway unbuttoned, face flushed and sweaty. John looked at his beautiful white throat and his mouth got dry again and he felt flushed.
There was an uncomfortable silence in the room just then, but I wasn't sure if I said something to accidently offend him. So, I tried to offer an observation of my own.
The Dove and Eagle Pub was crowded and loud. They found a booth in the back when another group was leaving. Sherlock sprung for the first round of pints and was halfway done with his beer, when he looked up to see Jim Moriarty at the next table.   Mary sat next to him, sending glaring looks Sherlock's way.
"Oh, but he didn't." Sherlock smiled, shuffling hurriedly through files and folders, quite satisfied with himself.
“I don’t know--he just got here!” said a blond guy, who was wearing a black and white football jersey and taking Mike’s pulse.
I can't help seeing things, I see loads of things others just don't see. I hate to admit it, but alcohol helps me calm down. Alcohol and other things.
But there he was, sitting at a table with his casted foot up on a chair, a sea of books all around him. You could still see fading bruises on his face and neck. The papers did say the that there was only one serious injury requiring hospitalization. Was that him? The hospitalization? Or someone else?
"Sorry, what?" I looked at her. I could feel my heart starting to speed up and rage creeping up the back of my neck. I didn't want to lose control of myself.
"Nah, I don't think that'd work. Molly's already been helping me. There's nothing for it. I'm hopeless."
I'm only a few blocks away from school. I spend lots of time alone now. Lost in thoughts that usually take me down some dark avenues.
John was momentarily at a loss for words. Did Sherlock live here? After this morning, was he at the wrong flat? His heart sank.
I inch closer and slip my right hand into his jacket and feel his waist 'round the side. He makes a tiny smirk.
-Walk or run away quickly. No, they’d be too temped to run after him, he knew blokes like this back home.
He was sitting next to me, smiling. He leaned in to talk to me. "So, how do you do it?" he asked with a conspiratorial whisper. He looked at me, right into my eyes. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. His eyes were a clear blue and pupils were very large. I could see a band of sweat across his brow.
John looked up at the poker and stopped, mentally calculating how to get it from him. They were both out of breath now, staring at each other.
"Lot of bloody help you were the night of the club riot." I snapped. Why was I angry? Angry at my situation. Not angry at him. OK, maybe, angry at him. A little.
Mary, at John’s side, was shrill and gaping. “John! Whatever are you doing?” she crouched down and bent over Jim. “Jim, Jim are you alright? I’m so, so sorry. I have no idea what came over John--you better have a good reason for this!! Although I can’t imagine why!”
So far, Nothing out of the ordinary. He made a neat pile of the clothes. There was a little mud on the boots, he noted with a rueful smile. What Sherlock would think of the mud, he wondered….it was brown and ordinary as far as John was concerned. The mud from her boots did not scream out any information to him.
I walked along with them to the residence hall. And that's how I found out where John and Molly lived.
The beach ball went overhead again, Sherlock jumped up and smacked it and it went sailing far into the other room, “Good one, mate!” he heard someone call out.
She started to speak through the crying. "I didn't know who to ask, I just thought...maybe." she pulled back and looked at me, her nose red. She tried to smile, a bit.
John almost ventured to call Mycroft twice, but what would be say? "Hi Mycroft, I'm not sure you remember me, but um..it's John Watson and...I live with your bother and…sometimes he just disappears, and well, yeah... he comes back, but um…" not sure how that’d go over.
John steadily made his way to Baker Street. He stood on the pavement deliberating. The lights were off and the windows were dark. John walked back and forth a few times. Should he do this now? he wondered.
He caught John’s lower lip in his teeth, tugging gently, wanting more, sucking on John's bottom lip. Sherlock wanted to tease and encourage John.  He wanted to promise John more.
I climbed out of bed and padded around the flat wrapped in my sheet. Grabbing a glass of cold water I saw a note on the kitchen table. Written in red ink on the back of an envelope. "Gone to work--John."
He usually looks insufferably posh in what's left of his school uniform (the jacket he usually stuffs in his bookbag).  Today he wore jeans. I didn't know he owned jeans. The afternoons were getting chilly in London, the wind blowing his hair off his face.
Sherlock was fully aware that John had some concerns about his behavior. He just did not care. John was not responsible for him in any way. Sherlock could take care of himself.
"No, you didn't." She had that amused expression on her face that she often has when she looks at me. Like I am her little brother and she is minding me while our parents are out.   "Goodnight, John."
The cold air on the walk home brought John back a bit and Sherlock was happy he didn’t have to carry him. He would have done it of course, but it would have been terribly awkward.
When Mike came in the boys were sitting on the floor on either side of the game board—which was precariously atop a pile of books. The boys were involved in a heated argument about the game but invited Mike to play.
The rest of the week went by uneventfully, but the scrape on the side of my leg was driving me crazy.  I was pacing in John's room and constantly scratching. I couldn't  hide it anymore.
They don't even realize they're doing it. But, you don't always look back." He cleared his throat and looked down at the chemistry notes.
"Right." he put his finger up to his lips. "Sshhh. Don't tell him I was here, Molly don't." John looked guilty. "He doesn't like pubs, really. Not his thing. Not his area. "
The pretty lady walks up to Mrs. Holmes and hands her the baby. Mrs. Holmes hands her drink to Mycroft to turn and take the baby. The pretty lady kisses Mycroft on the cheek.
The party was hot. Very, very hot. A few flakes of snow were falling outside, but inside the large flat it was summer in December.  The house was packed with sweaty uni students drinking cheap beer out of those red American party cups. Looking around only briefly, Sherlock took note of the striking black and white uniforms of the football team and realized that the entire team must be here.
John got out of the hot bath and walked back into Sherlock’s bedroom, drying himself off with a flannel. Sherlock was awake. John didn’t have a change of clothes with him, he sat on the edge of the bed and started putting on his pants and socks from earlier today.
Struggling with his books, bag, crutches and the chair that may just topple over. Yet he was confronting me--
John, feeling more and more helpless as the events of the evening unraveled before him, looked on with widened eyes, wordless.
He awoke confused, finding him self on a strange sofa in a strange place. He was aware that a blanket was placed over him sometime during the night. Sitting bolt upright, and whipping his head all ‘round he saw Sherlock sitting at the kitchen table looking into a microscope. Oh yeah right--
John walked over to my chair, standing in front of me. I took a sip of whiskey and looked up at him, not anticipating what he had in mind until he planted his left knee against my thigh in the chair, not quite sitting in my lap.
"Oh no, I can't Mary. I have...Sherlock...tonight." John gestures with his thumb over his shoulder, indicating I'm somewhere behind him.
Believing that this wasn't just some pleasant fantasy that I had cooked up in my addled brain. It might just be real.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
John sighed, cheeks pink. Sherlock leaned against the door frame with his left hand and reached up to touch John's arm with his right hand. He could feel John's hard muscled bicep through the thin material of his new football jersey.
John was confused about this entire night, and wondered what Mrs. Hudson's relation to Sherlock was. "Does he live here,--is he your son...or?" John asked.
Then Sherlock walking down the hallway to the bedroom, lingering in the doorway, watching John asleep in bed. And then Sherlock getting ready for bed, changing into track pants, brushing his teeth then coming back into the bedroom.
"Right, you’ll have to explain yourself further, please." The Department Head hoped this did not take long, it was almost lunch.
"How would you know? Being friends with me has it's advantages, Sherlock, if you remember correctly." Jim smiled, a mean, crooked smile.
Mike wanted to come to this party and told Sherlock in no uncertain terms that before he’d unlock the lab he was stopping by this flat. Sherlock had to relent.
We all had our red wristbands on, ready to get into the pre-paid parties. The wristband was a little dear on my part, but my sister told me to do it, it'd be worth it.
Sherlock stares at the ceiling and explains fully what happened the night before, including how much he misjudged the situation and how Irene came to his aid.
Sherlock looked at John with fear and apology. He looked backwards toward he door of the flat, frowning. "Mrs. Hudson-- she bursts in here all the time without asking."
And that's just what happened. We walked over the the school, signed Sherlock back in and I left, meeting him down the block in about ten minutes.
Sherlock chatted quite happily en route to Anqelo’s and John tried valiantly to listen, but had a nagging feeling he forgot something. He just couldn’t remember what it was. It was so nice to see Sherlock again. John was so excited and hung on Sherlock’s every word. He wanted to keep up his end of the conversation and ask questions about what he was working on with Scotland Yard.
and as I try exceedingly hard to avoid spending time with my brother--we're headed to John's first."
John hurried through the streets at more than a bit of a run. From uni to the flat was about 10 minutes at a leisurely stroll.  Now though, he felt some urgency to get home. Fast.
John's jeans fell open and slid slightly down his hips. His legs started to shake slightly and his head swam as he pulled Sherlock closer.
The party got crowded quickly. The beer flowed, John kept a look out for Sherlock, but it seemed as though he wasn’t going to make it.  Just as well,  John couldn't relax knowing he still had to talk to Mary.
Over John's shoulder, I can see a relieved look on Mary's face. At least one of us is on the right track.
But I wasn't a uni student was I? I wasn't due to go to uni until next year. I was just an interloper. Still, I went along with John and his friends to the pub. I don't even like beer.
So I'm stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I opened my mouth. I knew right away I was fuckin' done for. It was
As they helped Mike to sit up, John glanced at the floor behind him and saw more than a bit of bright red blood on the white kitchen tile. “Oi, where’d the blood come from? Wait, Mike let me…” he placed a hand on the back of Mike’s head and looked at it…blood.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I'm slowing down. Dancing, ball pits, clubbing. It's too much--I have bruises from the mechanical bull riding.
He turned to pick up something from the desk, his body as lean and muscular as any dancer. He handed me a small item. "Jim Moriarty gave me this."
"No." says the supervisor slowly, scratching his head. He decides quickly that this one won't be recorded. He puts the clipboard down on the desk./p>
People walked in and out of my room all the time--Molly, Mary, Mike.  I had more traffic than the library. It didn't bother me, but it bothered him. He said it distracted him and he couldn't concentrate with them in the room.
"She's very lucky. " the doctor said gently. John looked up at him to see a small smile. "They got her here just in time, really."
"I also took the liberty of calling John's parents to let them know that their son was unharmed in the explosion."
The librarian and staff got used to seeing me there every day. They saved me my favorite table with a place to put my foot up on a nearby chair.
Sherlock walked over to the sofa and sat down near John, placing his head in his hands. After a minute, John slid closer to him and just sat quietly. He took his left hand and ran it over Sherlock's shoulders, the material of his shirt warming up now that he'd been inside a while.
"Yeah, mostly." I sighed. "God Mary, I've never felt better. I mean, this term. I was feeling pretty hopeless."
"To be perfectly honest, I wanted to. Jim had cocaine with him--he always does." Sherlock clenched his jaw.
John laughed when he saw me jump, "God Sherlock, are you going to tell me what's wrong? You're not still thinking about Jim Moriarty are you?" He walked over to me.
The doctor stepped to the side, out of the doorway and gestured back over his shoulder with his thumb. "The lad who brought her here, I....." but the doctor did not get to finish his explanation.
Sherlock's parents are long gone. All he has is his brother. He didn't quite fill me in on the entire situation, but I do feel like I have a better sense of what's going on. I feel guilty for keeping it from Sherlock, though. So, I'm going to tell him, first chance I get.
John's heart felt like there was no room in his chest for it to beat. He pointed to the door of the house. “I’m locked out. I guess I have to walk to the rental office. I don’t know how…’
“Mike, oh my God! Mike!” A girl shouted as a group of kids ran to his aid, Sherlock among them, crouching down to try to help him up. But to no avail, he was out. Unconscious.
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
“It’s a disguise John. If I can fool you, I can fool anyone. It was an experiment.” Sherlock didn't sound too confident in his explanation.
"Sure. Come in." I opened the door and ushered her in. "I just want to tell you... I was out last night...drinking and I have a hangover. So I...." I know I was squinting and holding my head. The sun in my room was too bright.
Sherlock can remember Mycroft lecturing him about a year ago, “Sherlock, you have a tendency to think with your heart on these matters. Just don’t bother, it’s better that way.”
He sat up with a start when I inadvertently stepped on a creaky floorboard. The sitting room was dim, faint light from the street illuminating the windows.  John sat up rubbing his eyes and I immediately felt a pang of regret about my previous behavior.
He had been a bit quiet all night. But after the loo, he was just staring down into his pint, serious. It worried me. "Alright?" I asked.
It was just not possible to see Sherlock over the summer. John's days slogged on and ran into one another, sunny days, working, dinners with family, John even saw some mates from primary school.
Jim's voice was loud outside the door. They both froze, looking at each other, then ran for the exit door that led to an alley between the buildings.
For now, Sherlock was just going to have to accept it. Since the boys met last year at university, they spent nary a moment apart, the 3 months of summer holiday being the first time they had been separated since they met.
A small paper origami envelope, slightly bigger than a postage stamp, folded out a glossy fashion magazine. John’s heart stopped and he got a cold icy feeling in the pit of his stomach. It was shockingly familiar in his hand.  He knew exactly where he’d seen one of those before.
come any closer," he said carefully, not surprised to see them. He rose from the chair and gently placed his book on a side table that held a lone teacup.
She looked up at me with a watery smile and blew her nose. "Thanks John. I just figured that maybe you knew him better than anyone else. And...maybe you knew what...he was...up to."
Sherlock took exception to the way the game was played and argued the logic of some of the rules. John spent a good portion of the game talking Sherlock out of changing the rules ad hoc.
Then I leant in even closer; in fact, I had to stand up a bit.  He didn’t move away, even as my lips touched his temple.  I kept them there for longer than I’d intended, and when I knew it had to end, I rested my forehead against his and let out a breath.  “It’s all fine now,” I repeated.
“Why the dismembered foot,” Sherlock murmured, mimicking my thoughts.  He looked at me now, a knowing smirk on his face.
He sat at a stool, Rosie on his knee gazing curiously at a foot.  Not her own foot.   A detached foot.  A fucking detached foot, sitting there on the table top.  Her arms are reaching out for it.  My daughter wants to grab the
“We can’t keep doing this,” I said from where I sit on a criminally uncomfortable hard plastic chair.  I’ve dragged it closer to the bed, just a hair closer and only so I could rest my feet on the bed whilst I'm obliged to be stationed here all night.  My leg twinged.  My shoulder ached.  Mycroft's orders, I told myself.  I wouldn't be here otherwise, would I?  Being Sherlock's minder is something that seems to come naturally to me, but it's gotten harder, I'll admit.
Sherlock was pretending to listen to the story of how he and John walked Mike out of the flat before the bomb went off. A story of parties, footballers, bombs, ambulances and Scotland Yard, he guessed it sounded exciting to Liz. Sherlock nodded, not really listening to Liz gush about a story she knew nothing about and wasn't there for.
The rest of the term flew by. John's bed became a storage area. He piled clean laundry on it. He organized his books on it. He occasionally sat on it.
I stood up suddenly, with my casted leg still on the chair. I almost fell over, 'Oi,"  I said, not wanting to yell in the library.
Hash pipes are very tiny, almost cute, if I said such things, this one is white, ceramic and made in Turkey. Don't ask where I got it.
I pulled on track pants and walked through the lounge to the loo. Should've got an ensuite. Too much money, though.
While Mike and John regaled the girls with the story of the daring escape, Molly kept trying to steal a look at Sherlock without anyone noticing. He was in the kitchen, staring into his microscope. Molly was smiling and nodding but found it difficult to follow the questions that Mary was asking. As she sat there, Molly started to sweat, trying to think of a way to get Sherlock into the conversation so she should talk to him.
"Ok, well, now I'm here."  John tried a more even tone of voice as he set the flask in the sink. There was no need for anger, migraine or no. He was just glad to be home,  right?
On the table, he spread things out for me to see. A mirror, a few plastic drinking straws wrapped in paper, small sewing scissors.
Standing across from Mycroft was Sherlock. As John burst into the flat, he had obviously interrupted a conversation between the brothers, but now they are silent. Sherlock lowered his head, staring at his feet maybe or the patterns of the carpet.  Mycroft turned to look at John, but Sherlock did not look up.
John was reluctant to press Sherlock for information about his night out. He let the subject drop but kept his eyes and ears open. After all, it was his life, John reckoned. He did well otherwise, and didn’t seem to keep late hours, as a rule. Still, John was uneasy. When the weekends came, he would get nervous--Sherlock would just walk out of the flat, not a word said to anybody. Sherlock never came home as late as the first night, nor in such a state as before, but often his eyes were glazed over, pupils small and he would not talk at all, even when questioned. He went straight to bed.
“Right, what are you, then?” John took Sherlock’s hand and led him to the sofa where the boys both sat down.
“Shall I check your pockets, Sherlock?” Lestrade asked with a smile, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
They got out the Cluedo board and created a makeshift table out of a small pile of books, with the game board on top, they started to play.
John peeked out of the door of Sherlock’s room. It was morning and he had to use the loo, there was nothing for it. The flat was quiet. Stamford’s door was closed, he must’ve already left for the lab. Giving a sigh of relief, John was in the hall and closing the door of Sherlock’s room just as Stamford came out of the loo.
"Sherlock...I thought you had given up...drugs." Now he looked up. Right at me.  In his eyes was a little cold fear. Why did I feel guilty? I didn't do anything.
The doctor smiled and headed towards their bedroom and when he entered, he discovered the consulting detective was lying on his stomach, on their bed, coloring. His smile grew when he saw Sherlock was wearing one of his dress shirts, underwear, and his plush shark slippers that made it look like the sharks were eating at his feet.
It was perfect. It was absolutely perfect. John couldn't help but grin while he sat in his office at work. He was looking up stuffies online to see if he could possibly find something new for his Little Bug that he couldn't find at a store.
John smiled saying "There he is, there's my bug. Come here sweetheart, come back and tell Daddy about your conclusion." The younger man looking down at the floor as he quietly padded over to the other man, getting back onto his lap not quite like before, after John sat back down.
The Doctor smiled and said "Well at the moment, I am witnessing the most gorgeous thing on God's green earth, lying partially dressed, and coloring in my bed.." He set the package down on the nightstand and crawled onto the bed, straddling the younger man from behind.
Sherlock popped his head up and looked him dead in the eye with those gorgeous eyes of his and said "I was lying in bed and thinking, what else is new?, but then I was struck by realization...With my superior intellect, I have the potential to rule the country, or perhaps, even the world!" A grin quickly spread across his face, hope in his eyes, and he leaned in closer. "Can you imagine it??"
He nodded and said "I do, and I am grateful for that. But I have seen him get hurt...So badly, and watched him pit his walls up. He was a loner, bored, a junkie, and well...I feared he would've taken his life, it had hadn't been for you."
Sherlock smiled a little and when he opened the box, he pulled the stuffie out and raised an eyebrow. John smiled and said "Sherlock, meet Pusheen. Pusheen is a Japanese cartoon cat that is becoming more and more popular...Correction, Bug, meet
Mycroft stood and dusted himself off before straightening his clothes. He said "No, I believe that is all...But do continue to look after him, John...His loss would truly break my heart."
The younger man paused, blinking a few times before setting his cup down on their kitchen table, and the doctor watched as the brilliance, and slight insanity that is Sherlock Holmes, the worlds greatest detective, fall prey to his little space.
The older man stepped forward again, asking "Does Baby need his little bum spanked for his attitude? Sit in the corner perhaps, without one of his stuffies?"
The younger man sat down, lying his umbrella across his lap and said "Sit down, Doctor Watson. I wish to speak about Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock looked back at him confused and moved until he was sitting on his knees. "A package? I didn't order anything."
Sherlock curled up in a ball against him, and John smiled, arms wrapping around his bug in a protective, loving hold. He handed Reginald back to him, realizing Sherlock had left it there when he got up, leaning in and kissing the genius' cheek a few times.
Even now, ever since he deduced John since the day they met, but didn't realize that John was a Daddy Dom until they were in private, he's still the same Sherlock, but different. He's more open with the older man, trusts him with his life, and loves being his Little Boy most of all. He'll deny liking being a Little till the day he dies, but John knows he loves it. He's the love of the doctors life and he knows he's the same for the genius and consulting detective. The doctor cleared his throat and crossed his arms over his chest. He said "Sherlock...Look at Daddy, Baby Boy."
John had the package sent to his office and a week later, it came. He was so excited for Sherlock to see it, hopefully he'll love it. There are very few things the great and brilliant Sherlock Holmes, loves in this universe, and one of the things put at the top of the list, are stuffies.
The doctor nodded and said "Yep. I've got a ring and everything. Why, is that not good? Will he say no?"
The younger man nodded and said "I hope so...And if you ever hurt or betray him, I will make it appear as if John Hamish Watson never walked the face of this earth."
The older man smiled. He knows Sherlock has always been a little bit of a grump, and he sugar coats nothing. He says exactly how he feels and isn't afraid to say it.
John could. He could see Sherlock on the throne in Buckingham Palace, ruling all of England or the whole United Kingdom, demanding everyone has their own Reginald, and for all the stupid people, especially Anderson, to not speak in fear of lowering IQ's, and God knows what else.
"Sherlock--I have to tell you. I think, in my fervor...last night...that I may have given you..." I cleared my throat. "...a love bite." my face flushed.
I tossed my coat over John's on the chair. When he left, I pulled the item out of my shirt pocket and turned it over in my hands. A small folded envelope, white. Of course, I know what this is.
"Uh..no. If if you think I should stay...I can stay." John said in a low voice, looking at the pale teen with closed eyes on the sofa.
Sherlock didn’t answer. John stepped tentatively into the loo and touched him on the arm. “Sherlock, let me get you to your room.”
“Oi there, lads! Just keep sitting where you are.” Detective Lestrade of Scotland Yard got out of a car and ran up to them.  “You boys need to be checked out by the medical team.”
"I'm sorry, I just thought of something." he looked back and forth between his parents frowns.  John lowered his head, fighting to calm himself, in order to make sense to his parents. "I'ts, I--I know someone--back in London. Who may be able to help. Help us--help Harry."
"Sherlock, I don't know how you know that and I don't think I want to know."  Lestrade held the bag up to the light were it could just be made out, the tiniest pink feather, the size of a piece a confetti.
I filled Mycroft in on what happened over the last few weeks. Turns out, he knew Sherlock and I had a row. "John, I wanted to tell you that I think you have been a good influence on my brother. Sherlock is extremely sensitive and has a difficult time accepting criticism. But whatever happens, I want to thank you."
“Well, how are you? Uh…also… no Mike—he went to work.” John shrugs and looks at his feet, cheeks pink and smiling slightly.
John sighed and followed. It was now or never. “Sherlock…wait please, I would like to….can I, can I…are you hungry? Would you like to get something to eat? With me?”
Everyone thought that John and Mary made a cute couple. Sherlock got tired of hearing about how cute and happy and 'made for each other' they were. Weeks flew by and one Friday night after their date, John didn’t come back to the flat. Mike fully expected this. Mike watched them and could tell that they got on very well and maybe things would get more serious between them.
His father nodded and took his mother’s hand. She stood and patted John on the shoulder and they walked quietly into the hallway.
He dragged me to student health. We made up a story about scraping my leg, to avoid the real story that it was from prolonged contact with an electronic monitoring tag. They put me on pills and cream for a skin infection
"Hey," John said, reaching out to tousle Sherlock’s unruly hair, “I’m about to go back to my flat, I never did unpack.” He said chuckling.
This caused Sherlock to stir. He sat up slightly, got on his knees and lifting up John's jersey, started kissing his way up John side, with no protests from John.
I drained my bottle of beer. My cheeks felt pink and I was afraid I do something that would further complicate my life, so I stood up to leave. So did the rest of the group.  My panic passed and I regained my composure.
John looked at his flatmate in almost horror as he was laughing quite uncontrollably on the floor. Sherlock on the floor, John on top of him and the coat in between.
And just like that he was gone, leaving Sherlock still wondering why it was so bloody important for John to have a flat of his own.
Frantically trying to assess just the amount of danger he was facing he balled his hands into fists and took an almost blind swing, but Sherlock ducked just in time.
They got on reasonably well, Mary was cute, perky, determined, reliable. It was just natural wasn't it? And maybe she
“It’s for shock, Sherlock. You were just in an explosion. Take it off if you like.” Lestrade said, in a gentle, fatherly manner.
Eventually, Sherlock found himself in front of the mirror fretting about what he was wearing to the party. His curiosity about what could go wrong or right got the best of his anxiety.  Sherlock did not realize that he was good looking, he just didn't see it. Women tried to flirt with him all the time, but he found it annoying. He didn't understand that he should be flattered.
John crawled slowly up to the top of the bed and sat with his back against the headboard and sighed. It would be great to stay with Sherlock. Just the two of them, all day, every day. It was so hard to walk away--he was wrapped around Sherlock’s little finger.
I was struggling in all of my classes. I had doctor's appointments. I has tests of my memory: short term recall, long term recall. They told me I probably had a worse concussion than they had thought earlier. I had terrible headaches. I had nightmares.
Inspector Lestrade here is trying to determine if he was wrong in granting me bail the first time 'round and wondering now if I should be taken to jail expeditiously to await my court hearing."
Luckily for the university, he didn’t have anything more on his mind besides dropping off a term paper.
Sherlock whispered again, still kissing him, breaking them apart briefly and looking him in the eyes. It was much darker in the kitchen now, with just a small light on in the sitting room, far away.
Sherlock was quiet at dinner, he ate little and had half a glass if wine.  He and John sat in the sitting room to have pudding with Harry while his parents did the washing up.
“He asked for a piece of paper and proceeded write a full account of all the experiments, numbers- equations- results so complete that I had to ask him to stop because I had seen enough.”
Angelo came over to the table, placing a candle in the middle. Sherlock snickered, and John turned red as they ordered the food and wine.
But he had something to say about all of them. when they left, he'd look up from his notes to offer an opinion about them: Mary--
"Well, you know John, I have just the thing that fights fatigue." Jim pushed a tiny white envelope towards John on the table.
It was Friday. I took Mary back to her room, kissed her on the cheek and thanked her for all of her help.
“Oh, and by the way, I have some great blow, if you are in the need. Unless, your new boyfriend won’t let you play with me anymore.”
His girlfriend was irate about last night, his ‘violent’ behavior and the fact that he ran out of the pub, leaving her.
We're taking our time now, no alcohol, no headaches, no hurry. My bed is big, my sheets are soft, my duvet crumpled at the end of the bed.
And performance anxiety? Well, I have the Prosecco to thank for pushing that well into the back of my mind.
"No, everything's fine. Yes, everything's happened. Nothing's fine. Sorry Molly, I have to go. I think I've made a terrible mistake. " John got up abruptly and left the pub. The footballers called after him but he didn't hear them.
Anomaly. I decided to put it out of my mind. I locked it up in an old sea chest in a locked attic of the mind palace and laughed at myself again.
As Mary gets up from the breakfast table, John Watson, ever the physician, makes a mental note of her slowed gait and a bit of weight gain. Antipsychotics, he realizes. Side effects would cause motor slowing and weight gain. As Mary gets up from the table, she turns her head and looks up at John, meeting his eyes. John freezes. He knows Mary can’t see him, or can she? John thinks she looks at him briefly with some kind of recognition, and then she looks away, no I guess not.
and if you hang around with me often enough, others will think you are....." Sherlock barely contains the anger in his voice.
p>Sherlock woke with a clanging headache. The clock on his nightstand read that it was 3:30 pm. Saturday after noon he wondered? He hoped it wasn’t Sunday.
But Lestrade was grilling Sherlock on how he was getting 'round the electronic tag on his ankle. Initially Sherlock was unwilling, but Lestrade led him to believe the more he cooperated, the easier they could go on him, because of his age.
I did mention that he looked awful. I could still see fading bruises. There were healing abrasions, too. Face, neck, arms.
"Sometimes, yeah." John answered with a sigh, glancing at all the chaos of footballers drinking, laughing and singing.
Of course, I was just going to let this play out because I had felt I had no other choice than to let things unravel for themselves.
He smiled anyway, "Good," he reached up and started to unbutton my shirt. My legs were spread for balance and he stood right between them. He kissed me again, the tip of his hot tongue ghosting my bottom lip.
I can't help caring really, but I think most of it is because I don't want to get hurt or to have you hurt. I'd shout it from the rooftops if I didn't think it'd make us targets for something or somebody---"
“I guess I fooled you.” Sherlock responded, recovering very calmly, but John could see a thin film of sweat across his brow.
Unexpected. Anyone who suffered such a viscous beat-down from John would definitely want to retaliate.
He sighed. "Fine. I'm sorry that I don't understand. I'll ask her to go." he shrugged and walked away. I shut the door, curled up into a ball and fell asleep with my clothes on.
"He's not currently enrolled in any university in London or in the UK, for that matter. Looks like he is a distant relative to a student at your school, Sebastian Moran."
Sherlock was quiet for a minute, "Sorry, I suppose I shouldn't have done that, with all you've been through tonight." He looked into John eyes, pupils the proper size now. Sherlock bit his own lip.
He knew he was taking a chance that he’d run into Jim Moriarty-he was often out late- and that didn’t bother him.
John was next to take a spin. As he ducked under her arm, he could see Sherlock talking to Molly from across the room.
Sherlock looked down at John, serious, “I’ll leave tomorrow morning early. I was going to leave tonight but something told me not to. I’m glad I stayed, John. Very glad. And I don’t expect anything really, if… if you think this is not a good idea. It’s fine.”
If John got home before Sherlock, he’d pace the floor until his flat mate got home. If he was out with Mary, he kept checking his watch and would occasionally excuse himself and use the red telephone box outside to call the flat to check. Both Mary and Mike noticed. Other people noticed, too.
"What did he do to me that wasn't fair?" Sherlock asked--walking over to the desk that was piled with papers. His voice was soft, as if he was asking himself.
We could hear the sirens coming down the street in 10 minutes. They placed Sherlock on the stretcher and took him. I wasn't sure where exactly they were going but I wasn't allowed to go with him.
"I'm leaving before the sun comes up. It's best." he looks down at me, glint in his eyes. His hands are on my hips. He leans down to kiss me, just briefly.
Jim has his hand on my knee. "Sherlock," he whispers in my ear, voice so soft, so close to me, as I'm bent over the mirror.  The back of my shirt is wet with sweat.
Sherlock spoke slowly and measured his words. “Because when they are out of their depth they consult…me.”
"Just because---you are so resistant!" Jim was smiling widely.  "Stop being such a good boy, Sherlock. Honestly, you are hanging out with John Watson so much, you're turning into a veritable goody-two-shoes. And," he patted the upper pocket of his coat. "I have what you really want, right here," he leaned closer to Sherlock and whispered.
It's been a year of settling in. John comes along with me sometimes to the Yard or on cases, a great assistant,
I lifted my trouser leg and he was promptly horrified. "Why did  you keep this quiet? Why didn't you tell anyone?"
He went to the kitchen, where there were loads of people arguing about which batch of cider was dosed. He couldn't remember which one he took his drink from. The fog was less dense in the kitchen and the walls were white, making it a bit easier to see. Trying to find an exit, he opened a fair few doors.
"Mycroft." Sherlock was not at all surprised to see the visitor and he was not at all in awe of the packages. Not as much as John was.
Sherlock wasn’t sure where this was going…the ramblings of a madman, no doubt. But it made him smile into the darkness.
"I think you can let John out of the cuffs too, Lestrade. I think he will come along quietly to the station, won't you, John?" I put a hand on John's shoulder and nodded.
We set up a somewhat comfortable study station at John's. It was best to move elsewhere than the library, but John's room was Paddington Station. If his door had a lock, it was rarely used. From my observations, John is a pretty popular fellow.
"Well yeah, but this isn't what I thought...?" I opened the menu, but couldn't think straight. What am I doing here?
you can get in." I threw my hands in the air.  "I guess this is just how it's going to go then, right?"
"I could ask the same of you. You said you knew the address!" John said sharply, still angry as he followed behind Sherlock.
John, he thought, had a reputation to uphold. And there was Mary, of course, his current girlfriend. Sherlock was pretty certain that tonight’s behavior was a one off for John and would not be repeated. Blame it on alcohol,  blame it on the physical proximity—he would not hold John to anything.
We sat silently for awhile in the office before Inspector Lestrade walked in. I think Sherlock and I had pretty much sobered up by then.
“Come on, Johnny boy! You can’t be an old man tonight!! You don’t want to go home now! Even Mary wants to stay up! What say you all come back to mine and we can party until dawn!” Jim offered, eyes wild with plans for more fun.
“And by all means, we’ll clean up the mess.” Sherlock spoke calmly from the floor, still laying  on his back, coat covering his waist and part of one leg.
"Why are you doing this?" Sherlock asked, uncharacteristically shoveling food into this mouth one evening as they sat in the kitchen eating Thai take a away. The windows were open in the flat and a warm breeze wafted into the sitting room and blew the curtains around.
"John I..." he reached in to the pocket and pulled out a small carefully folded origami envelope and handed it to John.
John almost spat out his tea, he started to cough and choke. He was fine really and put his hand up to let Sherlock know he didn't need the Heimlich.
Luckily, I could look at Sherlock over Mary's shoulder. But she wasn't happy about it and kept moving her head to block my view.
“Yeah, sure.” Came Sherlock’s distracted reply, as he opened the curtains of the kitchen window and peered at the sill.
