He adjusted his collar where it clung to his skin. Beads of sweat trickled down the back of his neck as he struggled to remain still.
Later, Mrs. Hudson sat on the stair. The sweet strains of music had ceased and shadows began to shroud the dusty corners of 221B.
John stood, clunking the glass down. He shook his head again and stumbled around the square table. Sherlock came to meet him. John's hands grasped the musician's upper arms. His eyes beseeching. His voice strangely dry and hoarse.
"And you came to that yourself, my dear," he said as he set her back down. "Now, you have your lists. But I have one more question to ask you before we move on. This will require to you to consult your own experience again. And I’m happy to provide supporting information if you’d like. The question is: can your Dada read music?"
"Sherlock, you've got to be kidding! We've already been talking about doing a bit less with her around." As if knowing she was being spoken of, Rosie whimpered in her sleep. Eyes fluttering beneath her eyelids. John stood and shifted from foot to foot, rhythmically rocking his daughter. She relaxed again.
It was simple, really. There was never anyone, Rosie aside, who could compete with what he felt for Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, Only One in the World. Only one in John Watson's heart. His only.
Being out walking had oddly cheered him. He looked up at the light of the moon and smiled to feel the sharp bite of the wind. He was out on this dark night, but even for such an unwanted trip as this, he couldn't stay angry long. Not when he had his child and family (y
Golden points twinkled, reflected in the lustrous wood. Lamps lit as the day dimmed to dusk and darkness. Eager hands had transformed the reception hall. Rolling aside tables where the guests had sat, first in delight, then suspense and on through deep embarrassment as he'd wrested control of the narrative to navigate through the fatefully eventful day.
A group of four taller children standing towards the back lead the group with an easy pulse. Smaller children including the honey haired girl smile and laugh at each other, half getting-half ignoring the beat. Two girls have made a patty-cake like game out of clapping each others' hands to rhythm.
Motes of dust swirled in the bright sunlight spilling in through the window, but just a few. He heard the sound of stringed instruments being played together quietly from beyond and found himself calculating how long it had been since his husband and daughter had risen together. Some hours he would say.
of water from branches and leaves continued. A large drop hit Sherlock on the neck and rolled down below his collar, setting him to shiver. He hugged the bottles he held closer and concentrated on slowing his breath, observing the leaves and flowers he passed. A spray of green and gold magnified by brimful water droplets. The mottled purplish-green of blackberry bracken rambling across sun filled slots in the woods.
A knocking at the window startled him. Wild black curls, wide bright eyes. His limber flatmate leaned palms against the car, bowing his height to peer in at John.
but please come back. really. i don't want to start my life tomorrow with the last thing i remember is us with blood on the ground between us and then you playing that honey gold song for us and telling us THAT and then just disappearng.
Rising to straddle John's lap, Sherlock opened the shirt. He took his time to appreciate the chest revealed beneath.  Ghosting across as John watched through lowered eyelashes. The cratered scar, a constellation of pain. Sherlock's fingers read a passage of the life that had brought this man into his arms.  He dipped his head to trace the line of John's clavicle with his tongue and lips. John gasped, his hands coming around Sherlock, roaming across his back. Sherlock moved his hips close and reveled in the whimpers he elicited. The contact between them was a glorious tease. Relieving some of the tense ardor consuming the dark haired man, even as the slow movements inflamed him further. His already snug trousers grew tighter.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but accepted her words. He tugged John bodily out of her hold and dragged him out the door with a parting shot to his land lady. "There's no curse on that gem not put there by the greed of humanity."  John threw her a grateful look. The door closed, and they were gone.
John spoke to Sherlock, supported by his touch and the circle of trust they were building. He told Sherlock about his childhood. Much of what the detective had deduced was correct. About his sister's struggle to come out. The layers of pain, physical and mental that had sculpted his family and basic experience of the world.
John had enjoyed a long quiet time watching her from his place lying on the blanket. His latest novel cracked open in his hands, husband tucked into the crook of his arm, long forgotten phone slipped down on the sleeping man's chest. The puffs of breath from that beautiful mouth proof of life, like their child's happy cries beneath a wide open sky. John breathed it in again in memory. Deep and solid and his.
"Sherlock, you don't have to like it. But I need to unwind. Do what you want, but I'm entitled to use this space, too."
She heard footsteps from John’s room above. She recognized the light rapid patter of Sherlock’s footfall. Moving swiftly from her place, she avoided him as he came down the stairs. Didn’t know exactly what would happen if one of the living walked right through her. She did not want to find out.
He was now working on gaining an adequate handle on a portion of one of the fundamental South Indian ragas
The sounds of gunfire intensified. He gave a last glance and dashed along the zig zag route he had charted in his mind. The figure above the wounded man spotted him and waved unobtrusively. Watson picked up his pace but agonizingly found himself slowing down. Feet sunk and ankles mired in fine sand. Impossible details came clear to him: a hand holding pressure to a chest, a whispered prayer.
Mrs. Hudson had hosted the winter holidays with the tree, lights and all. Her memories of them singing carols were priceless. The sweet little four-year-old’s voice piping high over the rolling baritone and steady tenor of her fathers.
Tonight, John was still. Many colleagues were away for the Yule week. John had signed up for more than his fair share of shifts, opting to take time off later.
Will is surprised to find himself nodding. He ignores the new rosin. He gets his violin ready rather numbly. Not thinking about what this could mean. What he had let go.  Mr Shadid checks his posture, corrects him slightly. Adjusts his elbow. They stand together next to the piano and Mr Shadid asks Will what he would like them to play.
John looked up bemused, recalling a nighttime swim in his youth. Sherlock’s mind leapt more quickly to assess the children’s peril.
She is smiling at him. John's back to the camera. The next was a sharper image of John standing in front of Sherlock's neatly groomed grave and headstone. Sherlock could clearly read the anguished tension in John's shoulders, jaw and clenched hand.
and I apprec that. really do. you are the most aggravating friend a man could have, and you've endangred my life as many tmes as saved.  srry fingres getting crmped
John stood. His face was flushed and he set the cup down on the table. "Well I didn't get to the important bits yet."
Now he just had to make it through this one more song and his duty would be done. It had been the first thing his heart had leapt to when he'd witnessed their engagement. He had written countless songs for John during their acquaintance. Songs about John that John had never heard, or had heard never knowing they were about and for him. But this would be that step beyond. Something for the new chapter of life John was now beginning.
Every sign pointed to him correctly understanding John's feelings now. It had been a month since he had the flash that stilled him, quivering with the effort to not throw himself into the other man's arms.
"And then, maybe he could learn more, too? Do you think he'd like to learn an instrument to play with us?"
Sherlock’s eyes lingered on the dear girl. “And she’s lost her Nanna.” Sherlock looked up at John with fresh heartbreak in his eyes. “Having you move back in was selfish. You’ve both already lost so much.”
Deep night had settled in at Baker Street. A wind teased the drifts of snow along sidewalk and rooftop. The moon was canting low, casting long dark shadows across the quiet streets. Rosie was nestled in down at 221A. She stirred briefly. A small hand stretched out, mouth smacking in contentment. After a slight huff of air out from her tiny lungs, she was tranquil again. Mrs Hudson, sitting in a comfortable over-stuffed chair next to the portable crib, looked up from her book and smiled at the child. Her thoughts went to her tenants above and a more wicked grin lit her face.
Sherlock ran through the piece once again, going on memory. He had yet to find the name of the song the Roma musician had taught him, much less an arrangement of it. He considered once again what it would involve to return to Romania.
"Are you unhinged!?" He saw Sherlock standing in the center of the room, one of his dressing gowns modestly drawn around him. Sherlock folded his hands neatly on a broom held before him. John had the momentary wild thought that Sherlock had been counting how long it had taken for John to come yell at him. "You woke me up!"
He filled his mug with coffee and skimmed the paper for traces of some shrouded malfeasance or wrongdoing he could uncover. But his thoughts kept drifting. He watched the rain drip forlornly off leaves of a sprawling maple as his gaze was tugged back yet again to the direction of John's house. Tantalizingly close, the brief distance mocked him.
Will runs out of the car, throws the door open to the house and tosses the violin case forcefully onto the bench in the mudroom.
Lestrade stood slouched against the wall, a self-satisfied smile on his face and the glass necks of his homebrew peeking out from a bag on his arm. "No, not that kind of news." Sherlock huffed in frustration, making to close the door, but Greg wedged it open with his foot. "Trust me you'll want to hear this."
John and Sherlock spent some quiet time beside the shifting cove after the ambulance left and the drama ended. The glowing jellies were undisturbed. They’d surely seen this untold times, John reflected. Humans stumbling in where they weren’t wanted and didn’t belong.
It is several weeks later. The violin has lain on the bench long enough to get in Mycroft's way. When Will sullenly refuses to answer questions about whether he is going to use it again, it is placed in the hall closet along with skis, a fishing pole and a set of jigsaw puzzles that only appear during the most rainy of summer days.
"Will Holmes?" says the instructor to an answering nod. He smiles at the young serious face. "You've come just in time. We'll do a few exercises first, so just leave your instrument for now and come find a place to stand." On a marker board behind him the name 'Mr Shadid' is written in bold red letters.
They were not shagging. Not even snogging. But they were sitting on the bed together. Quite close together. And Sherlock was talking. And..
"You wanted to play something tonight. I'm sorry I scuppered your plans," the doctor said, helping his daughter get a good grip on the bottle.
Sherlock moved closer to his flatmate. His shoulders tensed. He'd been expecting something else. He nodded. "A ruse. I apologize." He made to lift the bag out of John' hands, but it was moved out of his reach.
“No, Rosie. She did try, when she was at Uni. She was actually in a punk band, singing. She tried to pick up the bass, but it just didn’t take. Why?”
Will's father wrinkled his brow at the instructor, trying to take in what he'd said. It made him re-consider his own assessments so far.
"I realized that night I was attracted to you. The following months were agonizing, realizing how much more I wanted but thinking the line had been drawn."
“Let’s not debate this Watson. You said that Molly read music because she played the guitar. So by that logic, Uncle Geoffrey would as well.”
He took her hand in his. He sat in the chair they kept near her bedside. He said nothing at first, simply bowed his head over where their two hands were joined.
Young Will lets his father take the black case from him and hurries over. He bumps into a younger girl with honey brown hair who wobbles a bit but smiles at him. He stares intently at her for a moment but does not smile back or apologize. Will tries to discern individual voices in the mass of sounds swirling around him. A voice behind him mutters, "...can't wait until we can break off from these idiotic little kids..." He glances behind him and sees a tall girl with dark brown braids speaking to a neighbor.
They had never, ever, admitted their feelings for one another. After approximately one million hints, parables and blunt recommendations, John had still held true to that godawful engagement, married the woman who would try to kill Sherlock, again.
She just smiled up at him, then resumed her course. Walking on toward memories and sunlight and new adventures undreamt.
Sherlock didn't smile, but his eyes looked amused. "The circuit seems to be quite short between your mouth and that little brain of yours."
His gut churned with distress and guilt. Turning over onto his belly, he covered his head with a pillow, willing the image of John's luminous smile dissolving into confusion and regret to disappear.
"Oh God, Sherlock." John's own desire was evident. He shifted, increasing the contact between them. His eyes opening wide in appreciation as he found Sherlock in a similar state. Their kisses became more urgent and Sherlock maneuvered John's body to lay back against the arm of the couch. He tugged impatiently at the burgundy jumper John was wearing. He looked a question and John struggled to rid himself of the garment.
With some notable exceptions I have endeavored to act like a human being today. For you, John. Duty served. Leave me be. - SH
she'd seen arrive seeking to capitalize on the cities swelling in the wake of Romania's acceptance into the European Union. After his misfortune, he was lucky to be alive, to have a chance to end his family's long exile from the
Affectionate glances. A brush of the arm. A warm solid side leaned into another. At five minutes to midnight they sat close on the couch. John's face was flushed from the heat he felt at the steady contact he was enjoying from hip to ankle with the detective. He soldiered on through his anecdote of the many spectacularly failed, then finally successful attempts at learning to properly behead a champagne bottle after a Rugby league match. "Learned at University, I'll have you know." "There's always something."
Some time later found John clutching the leg of the couch with one hand and clenching a fistful of Sherlock's night black curls with the other. His litany of ecstasy and appreciation rose in volume as Sherlock brought him closer to release. Hating the necessity, Sherlock eased his tempo and shifted his hand to apply attentive pressure where his mouth had just been.
"Oh? That's good to hear. It's just a little hobby he's taken up recently. Since the winter holidays. He's been taught the piano and can read music of course, already. But last year he was obsessed with dinosaurs and greek myth. He wouldn't stop talking about the constellations for a whole month. Now he's on about pirates and violin music. Next month it's as likely to be race cars and parakeets as anything else. He just seems to dabble. It would be fine if he picked an instrument but we don't expect much to come of this, really. We're trying to get him a grounding in math. He's got a good mind for it and we think he'd be suited to the sciences."
Sherlock, scratched his nose to hide a smile. He stood, hefted his violin and began to play the wedding waltz again quietly.
As they ready to play again the teacher asks, “What did you notice about playing this way, Will? Or do you prefer William?”
He spoke of his explorations of sexuality and pleasure with girls in his circuit. The tentative flowering of attraction for boys, squelched and hidden despite his staunch defense of his sister. Until reaching the army relaxed those bounds. With his father's death and his reaching the majority age he became an independent agent in the world. Blazed through lovers and gained a moniker to prove his prowess in three corners of the world.
The tension slips back into the small frame. He had forgotten it was over. "You should give it to someone in your class then."
Sherlock said, "One of them talked about being attracted to different qualities of people. For their body, their minds. And I realized what I'd been feeling for certain individuals."
“Hypocrite,” she chided Sherlock lovingly when he insisted, remembering the many times he’d fought them bringing him to proper care.
Sherlock had jumped at the first crash. He was now kneeling on the bed, his face ashen. By the time the books hit the floor, John had called out and was running towards the door. After he stepped through, Mrs. Hudson left the teetering frame and hurried to the door.
Sherlock's eyes were full of pride, but he said, "Careful, Bee. Watch the assumptions. I played violin for you at night, but my mother never did that."
Dada read music, but now I know that he made blocks for me that helped me learn." She broke off from her soliloquy to give her father a hug. "Thanks, Dada," she said softly. John squeezed her back wordlessly.
Will's father brings his instrument over. Will grabs at the cloth and wipes down the gleaming chestnut body of the violin, cleaning the strings of excess rosin and attending to his bow.
Will's playing is halting at times. Coordinating reading the notes with the bulk of the violin and the movements of the bow sometimes escapes him. Playing with someone else is intriguing and exciting, but off-putting and confusing at the same time. Will grits his teeth each time they must grind to a stop over his limitations. Mr Shadid is uniformly patient and encouraging.
Sherlock smiled back at John. Then he reached out and put out his hand to Rosie as well, just touching a lock of her amber hair.  He ran the tip of his middle finger across her brow. As though feeling finest silk, or searching for a secret message.
John looked about to ask for more details, but stopped at the slight shake of the head Sherlock gave him. Instead the doctor launched into a tale of skinny dipping in the reservoir near his secondary school, which involved an enthusiastic German shepherd and an explanation of the dangers of climbing pine trees while naked. John enjoyed the laughter of his friends as well as the pleased and grateful glance his lover shot him for changing the subject.
“Thank you, Little Bee. And you as well, though it is still developing. I can add information that is not available to you. I know for a fact that Chief Inspector Lestrade cannot read music.”
She leaned back and looked up at her silver-haired parent. "You cannot read music. But you wanted to help me learn. And so you learned enough to make those blocks. And now, you don't play, or sing with music, but you remember what you learned. Like
Tonight he learned that love could taste of whiskey and champagne and anise. And a flavor wholly, uniquely of John. One which nourished. He could feed that void. Where hope had failed, trust delivered. Saved.
A sense memory unfurled in his brain. The phantom scent of the balm Sherlock stroked on his wounded hands that first day they spent together. The many long warm sessions of massage since then that had helped his gnarled fibers relax and stretch. He rubbed his long-since healed hand on Sherlock's belly. Gently luxuriating in the play of flesh beneath the soft cotton, and in the richness of life that had followed the fitful start of their relationship.
Auld lang syne flooded the airways. The song drifted out on the roadway, stuttering in and out of sync as they heard it from kitchen windows and car radios driving past. The sound of cheering and fireworks exploded in the distance. John and Sherlock shifted their bodies to fit together. Awkwardly trying to jostle spaces carefully misaligned for so long, to come into contact and merge. Geometries of emotion embattled with long practiced distance, and fear.
"Only some things. There is so much more I need to learn." She pulled her notebook out of a backpack they'd brought and she found the charts she'd been reviewing in the morning. Various hands offered bottles, palm sized stones and other items to anchor the corners of the loose pages.  She recognized one object proffered in particular. "My music blocks!" That corner tucked beneath it was instead weighted with a small shoe. The box was opened and swiftly upended.
She put her hand on his arm, stilling his efforts to wrap her in a shawl on top of the thick fluffy coat she was bundled into for travel. “You must say something. If anything happens, it will make me happy to know you’ve got each other.”
Moving Rosie carefully and deliberately, they re-occupied the couch. She rested between them. Sherlock's arm went up along the couch back, around John.
His sleeping brain tried to calm his racing nerves and parentally charged limbic system, til he heard the haunting sound of a violin. The tension slipped from his body, and a smile curled his lips. The whisper sweet sound of those strings had eased him from nightmares more times than he could count and they were inextricably linked with a sense of peace and being cared for, to John. Then he recognized the song itself, and he scrambled out of bed.
But somehow, they do. A stack of tiny, proto moon jellies form on the aunty midwife polyp. Expand and grow and one day burst away from their tether. A pile, like puppies erupting, wild and wheeling. Eyeless and silent, sensing the light, their prey, the cold all in one. And eat, and grow and touch and shudder muted in the coursing mother sea.
Martha checked the cupboards to see if she had the fixings for Rosie's favorite home-made ginger apricot scones. Plenty of flour, butter and apricots, but no ginger. She brewed a quick cup of coffee and thought about which shop was likely to carry enough of the candied rhizome at a reasonable rate. She settled on making a visit to the nearby natural foods shop. Not her first choice. It was just a hair too self-improvement obsessed for her to truly feel comfortable, but they always carried both Sherlock's favorite body powder and John's go-to nappie rash cream for Rosie. Add in the mint, coriander, green apple cold-pressed juice she'd become addicted to, and the four birds killed with this one stone made it worth braving the invariable lecture on longevity diets and negativity purge retreats. She was happy with her current level of negativity, thank you very much.
It all became more than John could process. He closed his eyes and leaned in to the hand that Sherlock had left resting on his upper arm. The burden of the past came rushing in. The relief so strong. Sherlock continued talking, reassuring John, explaining himself. John couldn't open his eyes or make the effort to speak. He just felt the warm hand on his arm and felt whole for the first time in forever.
John hurriedly finished stuffing the car full of crates and bags bearing oddments he and Sherlock had been too exhausted to pack up the weekend before. They'd moved his boxed things already, and all the largest pieces that John was keeping: book shelves, changing table, a lovely maple rocker that Harry and Clara had bought them. Rosie had just grown out of both the bed extender and bassinet she'd been sleeping in. So a crib had been ordered and should be waiting at 221B to be put together fresh. Rosie might spend a night or two in the portable baby carrier turned car seat, or the foldable play pen which was her favorite place for a nap.
John had fielded enough questions out of the blue both from his detective and now his daughter--whose apprenticeship had seemed to start shortly after birth--that he took this query in stride.
Sherlock resumed his narrative. "It didn't matter by that time, of course. I didn't need him to mislead me. That monkey was on my back indefinitely, and travels with me still." Sherlock looking at John saw a question in his face. "What?"
Humor lit Sherlock's eye. He put on a standoffish air. "About time, John." Rolled his eyes. "Could have done that a few years ago and saved us all some trouble."
John chuckled, "I'll be on the lookout for those. An old..associate of Sherlock's, from harder days, is working security--"
“And what about the class compared to practicing on your own?” Will’s whole body changes. The guards he had relaxed jump back into place. He looks at Mr Shadid with suspicion and pain.
There had always been something else behind John Watson's eyes. A fear or a longing. A searching for something that seemed near and yet far. For the first year of their friendship, it had been the goal of Sherlock's quiet musings to find ways to provoke the look of enrapture that he saw in John when they were fast in pursuit of a perpetrator. Or when the deductions brought them round to the ineluctable truth.
Sherlock's hand moved away, and he turned his shoulders to lay on his back again. Staring up at the ceiling. "What were you saying, John?"
Sherlock leaned against a poster-littered wall of the small post office in the determinedly bustling center of the small town in western Romania that had become his unlikely sanctuary. He opened the secure phone Mycroft had sent to him, hoping that the wavering cell signal would be stronger here.
She watched John’s body lean towards Sherlock. She saw the detective not notice as he looked away, attempting to stifle the emotions surging to the surface.
He scoffs. "I'm just thinking of the child, John. And as for caring for her at night, it's simply logical. As you noted, my needs for sleep are minimal. I'm confident that I could provide some distraction and feeding. It would surely improve your efficiency during the day. Both for caring for her, and for assisting me in the Work."
Intense blue-green eyes meet the older man's at last. "But they were so good!" he bursts out. "They could just play, and I screeched horribly." He reaches out and grabs the teacher's sleeve, bow still in hand. "I can do much better than that. I practiced so hard to get ready for that class. But then I was so bad, and none of it made sense. And you said I should go away."
Harry didn't have anyone to teach you. You were so happy to help me that you learned, too." She picked up a block. "Did your mother sing to you, Dada?"
To give some space to John, she pulled the bottle out of the heating water and tested the temperature on her wrist. "So, did he have a case for you? You'd think it would come from the former client."
After the kiss, John rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Nuzzling an ear he ghosted his lips across Sherlock's neck and delighted in the shiver that went through the man he held. "Thank you for this surprise." Sherlock's arms tightened in response.
His breath stuttered as he caught sight of John, sitting on the porch with an empty chair beside him. His eyes were closed with his head leaned back, bathing in the daylight.
John's eyes leapt up to meet Sherlock's. Such an admission was not strictly unprecedented, but was passing rare. John looked bowled over by the words, but seemed to be willing to press his luck.
The instrument retrieved, Sherlock left the bow aside. He plucked quietly at the strings. Rosie's eyes focused on him and her body calmed. John's forehead smoothed out.
John scooped up handfuls of the popcorn from the bowl. Dropped kernels littered his lap and tumbled onto the floor as he shifted, trying to get comfortable. He rolled his neck and shoulders, wincing at the sharp pain that lanced through him.
Martha put a pot of water on to warm up a bottle for Rosie and absentmindedly tied a bib around the young girl's neck. "You're not serious! What was it, a run-away from the zoo? A kidnapped police horse?"
John was still chuckling as he put one arm around Sherlock. Beneath his hip, the blanket slid deeper into the sand. Splayed at an awkward angle across the plaid, his bare foot stuck into the cool layers. The familiar feel was colored by memories and the flavor of nightmare that haunted him still. But in this moment, no hint of the past tugged his awareness away. The solidity of the man beside him and a year on in this new life anchored him.
, licorice. As in many things, John, you are drawn to that which may harm you. These are flavored with anise."
Sherlock smiled. He unfolded upwards and kissed John, a sweet possession of his lips. Then settled back down again, placing both hands and his chin on John's leg now. He said, shrugging, "Oh, like someone gave me the keys to a place I'd never been before. But it turned out to be my home."
He didn’t respond to the pressure of her phantom touch. But when she moved away, she saw his hand twitch, and a frown creep back onto his face. A heaviness invaded his shoulders. She moved back and clasped his hand in hers again, and saw the signs of stress recede.
"I'm sorry my prediction proved to be true," Sherlock said consolingly to his husband and child as they came back later, deflated, with kite and string in hand. "I rather wish I had been wrong."
Back to the inventory. Second, John Watson took up space. Despite arriving first to the flat and intentionally spreading his belongings as far and as wide as he could manage, Sherlock had still left corners and places where John made his presence felt.
They seemed to need a bit of a nudge though. Can't have them squabbling over Sherlock's mess already. Hmm. How about this crime here. A string of suicides. Horrific. Distressing. Just her Sherlock's thing.
By habit, he counted John's footsteps sounding a path with Watson up to their room. The tread was a bit slow. At least he knew John was as reluctant to let the night end as he was.
Waking by the time they returned to 221B, Watson was hungry for milk and attention. The child burbled and chattered happily to the two adoring men from her seat on John's lap by the fire.
“Of course,” John said quietly but firmly. Rosie shifted, and he began running his hand down her back in slow, reassuring strokes.
Straightening up and wiping his eyes, he said, “I could swear I can hear you telling me I’m being a right git.”
The music in this chapter was inspired by the Romanian band Taraf de Haïdouks. This whole story was basically inspired by a scene from the French film Latcho Drom, about the immigration of Romani people from India to Europe over many centuries. The film consists of musical vignettes, including this heart wrenching song about the dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu by the world renowned violinist Nicolae Neacșu:
"Yes, all I'd done to him. And it nearly broke him." His voice was quiet. Martha saw his usual guards shifting back into place. She came to sit next to them on the couch and placed her hand on his where it lay on his lap. But she said nothing.
"But I don't want to be treated like a child. Playing stupid games because I don't know any better."
An hour on found the group by the northern tip of the cove dispersing. The excitement had shaken many out of the spell of the glow. The sound of voices disappearing in the distance and the occasional closing of a car door broke the still of the night. John and Sherlock stood in a circle with their friends. Warm mugs of tea in their hands, having been conjured out of the night air by Mrs Hudson’s swift dispatch of Billy.
She began walking down the steps, feeling that tug again to head back downstairs, back to her home, and then on somewhere else.
But Sherlock wasn't done. "John..." John stopped on the stair and turned to face Sherlock. The detective stood, looking grave, hands clasped. Looking down at her, John judged that Rosie was well out on his shoulder already. This was as good a time for them to get some discussion in as any. There was still so much more to work out.
Leaving was easier than she'd thought it might be. But there was just one more thing that needed doing.
John looked away. Shifted the protective screen to poke the fire. He leaned back and shut his eyes against the pain and the pleasure.
Sherlock paused in his regimen with the instrument. Checking the tuning (A-string had dropped a hair less than a quarter tone since he'd tuned it while the caterers were arriving), tightening the bow (a new wooden bow he was still adjusting to, not one soul had thought to check the tension during the almost two years he was gone, another reminder that some things could not be repaired once broken), stretching and loosening his own sinews, and bringing himself to the centering of body and mind that would allow the music to flow (utterly impossible).
Sherlock smiled slightly, his eyes lidding heavy. "Gay. Sexually speaking. I have also been brought into awareness of other types of attraction that helped me better understand myself."
The look Sherlock gave to Rosie at this moment made John rethink all his assumptions about Sherlock and expression of feeling. A spectrum of love and fear and tenderness and determination were all on display. John closed his own eyes momentarily at the well of feeling this brought up in him in return. Sherlock took a breath and his face cleared. If he'd not seen it himself, John would never have guessed this was more than an idle conversation.
Sherlock squeezed John gently at every point of contact then determinedly disengaged, laying a firm, chaste kiss to John's lips. John finally acceded and settled himself to see what came next. He lifted one of the champagne flutes and sipped at the sweet liquid. The fizz felt alive. His pulse blazed.
A very sharp look from Mr. Shadid. "No most definitely not. No one is stupid here, but yes we have students at many ages. We can all do this together." He then addresses the room as a whole, "Speaking of which, good job everyone. We can move on now. Please get your bows and we'll work on your strokes."
John woke with a start. Watson--Rosie was gone from the crib. He blinked his eyes, adrenaline pulsing through his veins.
It's the pause between Christmas and New Years. Martha Hudson was looking forward to a quiet day on her own.
Mary came into sight. A circle of guests had formed and expectant eyes were on them. A final look between the partners. Sherlock gave him a wink. Then John was stepping out into the center of the circle, taking Mary's hands in his own, and Sherlock began to
So why on earth was he introducing an unknown variable into this intricately constructed life he'd made for himself?
He runs on, entering the woods. Crisp leaves crunch underfoot. The rich smell of humus enters his nose. The sound of water rushing comes to him and his footsteps lead unthinking and unerringly to the streamside. Not breaking his stride he leaps, his hands catching hold on a branch.  He pulls himself upwards, wriggling first one leg then both and then his whole body up onto the sturdy branch. The tree shakes as he clambers higher. He settles on a wide level bough. A black and white flag crossed with skull and bones hangs from a branch beside him. It flutters in a light breeze that tagged along with him beneath the canopy.
A roll of the eyes. "Do you think I am an idiot? Of course we won't give her a violin today. And she certainly won't be playing mine any time soon. There are suitably sized ones, that are appropriate for a child."
Sherlock was telling the story of how he and Mrs. Hudson had met. His voice was tense, his storytelling rushed. John watched him with warm, care-filled eyes.
“Oh, she looked fine to me. I think I was able to get all the stingers out. They took her over to hospital for observation. If she has an allergic reaction it can be quite dangerous.” Sherlock’s arm tightened briefly around his waist. “There were no signs of it I could see. But I encouraged the parents to be cautious.” He took a sip of tea, then rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Is this common?”
"He thought you sent him away," Greg said, then sipped his tea, grimacing at the bitterness. "No sugar?" He rose to add his own, leaving Sherlock to slump down on a chair, wondering if he was brave enough to face hope after all.
. Sherlock supported him, but he could see the pride the detective felt in Rosie’s independence and ambitious planning. John had to laugh thinking of his own slapdash relationship with school until he found medicine, and his sister Harriet’s disastrous career in academia.
Sherlock stilled. John felt his own heart beat rapidly. His hand tightened where it lay on Sherlock's hip, until John realized what he was doing. He loosened his grip and retracted his arm, laying it stiffly along his own side. His body an awkward burden of a sudden.
The group reaches a pause. Some stragglers clap a few beats behind. Others not following the written pattern continue until they realize the class has stopped. Will's hand shoots up into the air.
Sherlock stood, holding Rosie. Taking the bag from Mrs Hudson he said, "On New Year's Eve, I want to play for John. I want to let him know how I feel." She nodded up at him in response and he continued. "Would you mind watching Watson that night, down here?"
Sherlock followed. For the first time since stepping out onto the rooftop of St Bartholomew's Hospital, he felt a shard of peace. Sustained applause filled the room once the band brought the number to a close. Beneath the roar of laughter and chatter that followed, Sherlock breathed the feeling in. In his mind, John stood next to him with that half smile and crinkle of the eyes that told Sherlock he was understood.
Nuzzling into his lover, John said, “That explains it, then. Between peers and parents and tempers high because of the stings, the last thing anybody needed was to be outed in the middle of that mess.”
Sherlock shuddered. "The worst of it was in what she didn't say. How she looked at me."  John ran his thumb over the back of Sherlock's hand. He remembered the track marks lining the inner skin of Sherlock's arms. The places he'd looked away from so many times when he'd cared for his friend. A no man's land they'd both avoided. He'd left him there alone.
"No, I mean Watson may be nonbinary, or transgender, or something else. Or 'she' may be appropriate. It's just not for us to say."
Sherlock's grumbling subsided to rolled eyes by the time John McClane left the airplane. He shoved his cold toes beneath John's thigh. John glared at him but anchoring his feet seemed to calm Sherlock's fidgety energy, so he didn't object.
Violet Holmes brings them lemonade. Mr Shadid thanks her, Will remains silent. She gives the teacher a gracious but noncommittal smile, then leaves them.
"Oh, yes. Please." John's hands went to the buttons to help, but Sherlock swatted them away playfully.
Abandoning his task with Rosie’s clothing, John watched the play of emotion wash across his friend’s body. As Sherlock mastered himself John rose, hoisting Rosie into the air.
"Of course I'll watch Rosie. You've got a case then?" She pulled a few items from the fridge and cupboard: bottle, apple sauce, juice, a hard boiled egg, teething biscuits. "Has she eaten?"
“Little Bee, very good reflection. But within your question there are some assumptions you may benefit from letting us examine. Let’s think about this. Who else can read music?”
Not long after, John came down the stairs, his steps slow and deliberate. As he reached the bottom of the stair, she saw him hesitate. The unlit rooms of the house telling him the tale of where Sherlock lay.
"Being Sherlock Holmes was no picnic." They exchanged glances. Sherlock looked away first, drawn inward to another time. John  looked down at Sherlock's ankle again. This time he gave in to temptation. Settled his hand on the cool, pale skin.
country house before returning to her classes. She had worked with her musical father to create a slate of pieces and schedule for practice. Early morning hours allowed for family time that included John during the day. One wall of Rosie’s room was slowly being consumed with charts and plans for this and her other objectives. It had been an actual fight for John to insist on her blocking out--at minimum--two days per week where there was no scheduled activity, not even outings with her
"Much better. And in a moment, it will be even better still." Sherlock scrabbled at John's buttons, until a memory occurred to John.
“See? Genius,” said John. “Shall we make a list for Mycroft to tell him how wrong he was, starting with that item?”
"Yes," John thought he understood. "Oh, of course, we haven't talked about the noise. You'll have thought of getting ear plugs, I'm sure? For those few precious moments you do sleep of a night, the last thing we need is for Rosie to wake you up." Sherlock had a non-plussed look on his face. "You, know I actually have some. Mar--we sometimes would use them when the other was up with her." He made to stand again, "I'll be right back."
John huffed out a gasp. He was so used to seeing Sherlock sharpen his blade on others, he forgot sometimes how it pierced when the man took aim at him. John paused the film and looked down at his lap, emotions churning.
Sherlock? I'm sorry. I know you hate sentiment. And I told you that already. Repeated myself. Horrors. I'm sorry. I'll never say it again if you don't want. But give me this moment. I
Mycroft would have seen his brother's grief in a heartbeat. Sherlock was spared the burden seeing that knowledge reflected in his brother's eye would have been to him. Sufficient to let the assembled host believe he was angry to be inconvenienced by the loss of a helper and dab hand at tea. The real depth of the loss was his to bear privately. Alone would do quite well in this instance. To help protect against the disaster his choice to let go of his defenses had wrought in his heart. He would come to forget what John's presence had once meant. In time. He was certain.
“Excellent, Watson. That place of unknowing may be uncomfortable, but it is actually an important place to come to. You have a solid understanding of the limits of your knowledge. Rather than making an uninformed guess based on incomplete information, you can make a judicious decision about what you ascertain to be true, and how much trust to place in that conclusion.
Swabians are historical German inhabitants of Eastern Europe who were recruited to colonize the region during the 17th century to strengthen Austrian foothold in war-torn former Turkish-held regions. Variously fought for both sides in the WWII, with communities and individuals participating in as well as objecting to atrocities. Expelled from Romania under Communist rule. Descendants return to this region as economic factors allow. Fluent in German, Sherlock is using this background as a plausible cover. [
He saw the woodpecker-sculpted snag that announced the line of John's land. Newly hewn trees were piled in neatly, beside a towering pile of slash he'd not seen before. He emerged into tentative sunshine sooner than he'd expected. Vulnerable and visible in a stretch of meadow John's hands had reclaimed.
“In this case, your experience is that he does not read music, but you cannot make a conclusion based on the evidence. Now, you could ask your Dada (or I could tell you for that matter), but for the purposes of your education, I hope you won’t mind if we let you figure this out. I have full confidence that you can, Watson. Or at the minimum, you can learn a great deal about the process of inquiry by trying.”
Sherlock grasped both of John's wrists tightly and pulled them to his chest. "You can now. You can do anything you'd like."
"Dada sings, but doesn't play. We can ignore this. It doesn't tell us at all whether he can read music, since people can do both or one or neither. I've never
What she saw inside made her pause: Sherlock, still dressed as he had been, lying on top of his duvet, staring up at the ceiling, tears wet on his cheeks.
Violet doesn't feel strongly about it one way or the other. Will is doing fine with the piano, and she understands the demands of mastering an instrument. She had had some pretentions to the flute as a young girl, but mathematics had become her whole life soon enough.
The detective, unmoving, shed that cloak of disdain he'd donned. The inner aspect of disguise which had served him so long. Both for investigation and in keeping distance from others. Until the virtue of holding the world at arms length imploded, with the appearance of one soldier/doctor in his life. He saw his own shift reflected in John's eyes and reveled in the relief that acknowledging his own vulnerability brought with it. He felt buoyant. He also suddenly felt the feet like miles between himself and John.
"Don't! I want to figure it out. I didn't have enough information, but I think I do now." He nodded and she removed her hands. Sherlock looked on, his hand steepled before his chin and a twinkle in his eyes.
“Many of my relatives do play. But some don’t. And all of them may sing even if they don’t play an instrument.”
"I brought you something." A flat, round palm-sized object wrapped in tissue paper is placed in Will's hands. He knows what it is, knows he can't keep it, but he opens it up anyway. The deep amber cake is translucent.
Sherlock's hand alighted on John's aching shoulder. Clever fingers started sliding softly over knotted muscle, digging in.
Sherlock could take no more. He took John's face in his hands and kissed him until John responded. It was a tender connection, the presence of Watson between them keeping them physically apart and their movements calm. Sherlock kissed and kissed, licking gently, then nibbling sweetly on John's lips and chin until John's breathing was easier and the look in his eyes lost the desolation that had invaded them.
Sherlock steepled his hands beneath his chin. He glanced to the clock and neatly flipped his phone out of a pocket. Flicking the screen several times he typed furiously and then manipulated the buttons on the side. John watched befuddled, feeling his breath and heartbeat return to normal once more.  Sherlock placed the phone on the mantle place, facing outwards. An image of Big Ben came into view and John heard the too cheery voices of commentators float over popular music and the murmur of crowds.
"I thought I was doing what you wanted me to do. To protect our friendship. I never once thought of asking for what I really wanted."
"Here." The man shoved the bottles of homebrew toward him. "Don't overthink it. Just go visit him. He wants to see you."
"Yes! Exactly." Putting his arms around her, he gave the girl a hug and lifted her off her feet, swinging her in a circle gently. Rosie laughed in delight.
They play the Schubert together. Then a piece by Bach. Will asks Mr Shadid to teach him a song from his home. The cadence is different than what he's played before. There is a longing in the music that speaks to the young man.
. Neacșu is accompanied by a Cimbalom player. See this video of Taraf de Haïdouks performing that inspired the descriptions of the concert in this chapter:
Sherlock leaned his head back again, closing his eyes. "The feeling of my feet on the pavement, with the criminal unmasked. Your footsteps right behind--"
He slammed the mug down in front of Lestrade. "Tell me your news, and then please let me be. I'm very busy and I've no time for your nonsense." His eyes hard, his heart breaking.
John closed his eyes, shaking his head in regret and shame. "So much time wasted." He felt Sherlock's finger on his lips. Capturing it and biting gently, he opened his eyes to see Sherlock's eyelids lower full and sated.  John ran his mouth down the line of the index finger and planted a kiss on the center of his detective's palm. He felt Sherlock's limbs melt against his own.
John had no idea where he stood, no precedent to help him navigate this relationship, no map to help him have any idea where crossing this boundary might land him. Back in the trash heap of abandonment and despair he'd been in before he met Sherlock. A bare year separated the energized, challenged, typically overwhelmed but always fascinated self that now walked the streets of London, from the husk of a man he'd been. Clutching his anger in one hand and his revolver in the other. Each day a question not even so much of how he would make it, but more when would his tenuous hold break. When would he let it go?
"Tell me what it was again? I'm afraid I was a bit too desperate to know some other things at the time for me to take it in."
Christmas Eve had been perfect. So perfect Martha poked at the memory as she moved through her daily breathing and stretching exercises, just to be sure she hadn't dreamed it. Little Rosie looking like an angel in her gold and silver dress.  A crackling fire lit as the first snow of the season started to fall. The scents of chocolate and orange and cinnamon making everyone drool a bit. And much appreciation that the toothsome treats awaiting them were courtesy of kitchen 221A. Stealing John's chair for a comfortable seat by the hearth. Listening to Sherlock play 'O Holy Night,' always one of her favorite moments of the season. Rosie's laughter threading the hearts of the household together with joy. And most surprising, the delight of witnessing her adoptive tenants' burgeoning flirtation unfurl before her eyes.
John began a quick list of the toxins, chemicals, weapons, diseases, body parts and highly breakable equipment which had graced the Baker Street flat during his various tenures. He got distracted musing on how many human bodies could have been constructed from the contents of morgue take-away bags Molly had sent home with Sherlock over the years. If his unfettered partner had fallen a hair more on the Victor Frankenstein side of things. His daughter gave a sigh, and he felt his own tense muscles ease slightly.
"About to fulfill a variant of one of my oldest fantasies about you, I think." John sighed happily as the detective moved back to his prior position.
He paused, sheltered by the remains of a shattered building. Close now. He broke cover to make the last dash to reach them and felt an impact like a jolt. His dreaming mind recognized the moment and he suddenly saw the scene as from two vantages. His own body dropping, eternally falling to the ground. A view from above: the enemy forces converging on the ISAF troops, then receding as the thundering force of air fire and pelting winds from rotors sent them scattering.
Watson was sleepily pleased to be brought back upstairs by her Dada. They thanked an extremely smug looking Mrs Hudson for her care and toasted the New Year with her. They suffered through the implicit 'I told you so' laughing on her lips as she saluted their little family, along with "better sound insulation for the flats" in the coming year.  John left pleased but flushed with embarrassment, clutching his daughter like a shield to his chest. Sherlock exchanged winks with Mrs Hudson, then tried to shake off the feeling of unreality as he climbed the stairs in the wake of the Watsons.
"Perhaps. But I am stronger than when I met your Dada, because I am willing to accept more now that I can be wrong. And can listen to others who try to correct me out of love. Your father taught me that."
The violin was soft to his gentle touch. Seeking permission he put it beneath his chin and plucked the strings. He tried to remember a part of the melody from the song just played. A bright smile from his companion told him he'd gained point. He was handed the bow and they spent the next little while over the strings together. One sipping warming beer and humming loud enough to be heard over a fast lubricating room; the other trying hard to hear and replicating what he could from memory of that hallowed song. Laughter over mistakes warmed Sherlock as much as moments of triumph when he found the trail of the melody.
A lightning strike of adrenaline pulsed through the ex-soldier. He scrambled to his feet, grabbing at his sandals and pulling Sherlock up behind him. They hurled themselves at the water’s edge, just in time to see the group meet the line where the seamless inky water became dappled with spots of light. Ghostly blue tumbling and floating beyond. The night illumined by a galaxy of submerged silver-teal stars. Piers limned by bobbing lanterns of gold. John and Sherlock called out, but their words were drowned by the splashing of their footsteps in the deepening flow.
"What am I missing out on, little one?" John asked his daughter. She reached out to touch her father's nose. He steadied the bottle for her.
Sherlock had escaped the affluent suffocation of his parents' country home only to get mired with a parade of antagonists and bystanders at University.  Strangely the active abuses he'd suffered at the hands of his peers had mellowed in memory to a wan scar, visible but painless. Lessons learned. But recollections of passive witness to his repeated humiliations continued to rankle. From pitying to blase to gleeful, but free from guilt or blame in their own minds. Infuriating. Chance contact with these wounds burned still.
John shuddered, "You are merciless." Then he pulled his friend into a fierce kiss. "Don't you dare stop."
It was New Year's Eve. John was returning from the shops bearing the toilet roll and milk he'd practically been shoved out into the snow to retrieve. Luckily he had found one place still open. Still time to go before midnight.
"Good night, John. Watson." John stepped away from the quiet of the living room to bring Rosie up to his room. He felt calm and peaceful. It had been a joy of a day.
He'd deflected their concern with contempt and even made it through the harrowing process of making the Best Man's Speech by a mixture of speaking the plain truth as he saw it and dipping into unvarnished sentiment. He'd fulfilled their inexplicable desire to feel sad at what they all went to such pains to say was a happy occasion. None had seen the true depths of his fear and anxiety.
"Papa, I'd like to start by memorizing all the pauses. Dada can help me find clever ways to draw them so they are easier to remember."
"He can sing, dear. Perhaps we can come to him. Let's think about a piece we could play to accompany his voice." She nodded sleepily. John beside them smiled, the warmth in his heart slowing his steps to encourage this moment to last.
Lifting the instrument he placed it on his shoulder. With a gentle, professional grip, Sherlock clung to the life raft that was the neck of his violin.
His living space invaded, freedom to indulge in the concerns of his research constrained, and flexibility of his schedule compromised by taking on not just a boarder, but a..companion. Of sorts. What Sherlock could not yet understand was why rather than a burden this new state of affairs felt so impossibly right?
making assumptions, make yourself aware of them as much as you can be—accept help doing so—and then critically examine those assumptions. Find external counsel you trust to help you. And you will be right much more than you would be otherwise. And perhaps much more than you are wrong."
His time with Victor tested then cemented this belief. His descent into addiction placing the final seal, goaded by the acrid debasement of accepting Mycroft's assistance to get clean. All his struggles, all his brilliance yet he collapsed into dysfunction over something so trivial as a passing taste of bliss in another being's arms. Soon replaced by the soul-gutting want of chemicals. It was comical. He could recite the formulae, the chain of processes affecting his exceptional mind. But knowledge this time was no shield, provided no defense. If anything it plunged him deeper into a spiral of self-deprecation at his inability to logic himself out of the trap of his senses.
He ached for an opportunity to correct some misapprehensions, while trying desperately not to think about more.
"I have something else planned." The detective started pulling away from John, who resisted, pressing closer as his friend tried to disengage.
“Papa why can’t Dada read music? I can, and I’m only six.” Inquisitive young eyes narrowed and soft eyebrows quirked.
"Hudders has Rosie. So she was in on this, huh?" John spoke hazily, preoccupied. "Did she tell you--" Sherlock took the last of the biscuit with his teeth gently from John's hand. Calloused fingers darted out, clasping John's wrist. John lost all sense of what his next word would have been as Sherlock's tongue licked sugar from John's thumb and forefinger. John forgot how to breath as the sensitive pad of his middle finger was briefly engulfed by Sherlock's glossy lips and massaged by his tongue.
John snorted with laughter. Sherlock shushed him with a gesture but smiled as well. "Don't distract her. Keep going, Bee. What did you have that has allowed you to learn?"
Half an hour later, John and Sherlock tiptoed down the stairs. Cheeks and lips pink and bruised. Hair half-tamed on both, but neither cared. They took a moment at the top of the stair to take a final taste. John could not resist worshiping Sherlock's neck a little more. "John, that's how we got side tracked last time we decided to go get her."
two musical staves, the five lines with notes used in modern staff notation to represent music. The grand stave has both
Martha slowly pushed her head through the door again. Going slow, it was an odd sensation. She closed her eyes the better to ignore what her mind told her could not be breached.
“Good remembering, Watson! You have more hands-on information than do I in that area. It’s important to always search your own knowledge when investigating. And also to not neglect other, reliable sources of intelligence which you have available to you. Our information is incomplete about our relatives in Leeds. Whom could we consult?”
is not here." He came close and laid a gentle hand on John's arm. John could only imagine what expression must be on his own face.
Her eyes went wide. "You. And Dada." She looked at John, her eyes taking on the thousand mile stare he'd seen so many times on his husband's face. "You and
“Yes, but that may help us here. Let’s return to our earlier question, with this information at hand. Who can we add to your list of those whom we have seen read music?
The instrument sat on the table, artless and worn in its untransfigured state of stillness. The earth dark wood of the sides transitioned to a stormy black on top and bottom. Sherlock's near-healed hand shook slightly as he reached to pick it up. It was a key to bring him one step closer to home. It also was home in a fundamental way.
"Really, John, no time to muck about and bury the lede. Mrs Hudson, we've stumbled upon the whereabouts of the recently stolen Blue Carbuncle, a rare diamond of repute and ill omen. It belongs to the Countess of Morcar and for some godforsaken reason turned up in the giblets of an upmarket holiday fowl."
"Oh, my god. He thinks I've been ignoring him, all this time..." Sherlock leapt to his feet, crossing the living room lightning fast to pick up his phone where it sat abandoned next to a half-full beaker and black feathers haphazardly set on the coffee table. He pulled up the messaging app, but then his fingers lingered over the screen, unsure of what to say or how to communicate all he'd been thinking in this long, anxious, too-empty week. He walked back to the table and sat down across from Lestrade, defeated by his own uncertainty.
A group of adults hovered at the water’s edge. John’s captain’s voice rang out. Calling for space, calling for clean water, a blanket, first aid. Sherlock asked if an ambulance had been summoned and conferred with a panicked parent, keeping him at some small space from John who treated the young patient. Another parent, this one calm and attentive, sat by the side of the girl under John’s care. Holding her hand and speaking soothingly. Several adults lectured the two other shamefaced youths. Those had who lingered to see how their friend might be helped receiving the lecture the absent third likely deserved most richly.
But then they brought up the loads from the car to his and Rosie's room.  John laid eyes on the gleaming, newly assembled crib. Sherlock's vulnerable apologies about taking liberties with setting up and assurances that all could be re-arranged made the source of the effort all too clear. It pushed the new father far over the line into sentiment.
She recalled the pungent scent of fir as she listened to Sherlock's violin, circling every moment with a promise of magic. Like a green refrain to a song punctuated by verses of pain and misery, lumbering into notes of redemption but settled now into an air of courage and hope. One that beckoned the singer forward into a different world where they could finally breathe free.
The morning it happened, she woke easily. A warm feeling spread through her chest. Her breathing had been more labored of late. Her creaks and aches made the prospect of waking less and less tempting in the face of the sweet embrace of sleep.
What on earth is going on?! This holiday party was having just the opposite effect she'd been hoping for. The girl John brought was lovely, literally. But really, another, John? Aren't you doing a bit of overcompensating here since his lordship gave you the let down?
A blissful scene of domestic tranquility greeted him. Rosie was awake, grasping a bottle in her hands. Gazing, eyes half-lidded, at his detective who stood in a deep blue dressing gown. He was playing a private concert to the just past nine-month-old in her high chair. Lights reflected in on them from the street, glowing gold and shining black.
Oh, Sherlock's not done yet, it seems? Well, he's being true to form. Busting up John's prospects with each new lady friend. Ah, John's helping out this time. Well, he always is the one that does it. Taking off on them for Sherlock's sake. Taking them on cases! Hope he's done with that now.
Scraping a raw nerve was so much more likely then. When John's very self was shattered and worn from wounds of battle. And his spirit was still seeking firm ground on which to stand.
He stomped a bit going up the stairs, wanting his housemate to know his ego was still smarting from the tongue lashing he'd been given by Sherlock for apparently using up the last of both household items. John was sure he'd done nothing of the sort. But in the interests of keeping their voices low and his child sleeping, and in the face of one of the very worst strops John had seen his flatmate in since he'd returned home from perdition, John had bowed to necessity. He made the trip out into the cold.
The bar was brightly lit in the deepening twilight. Music and laughter rang out into the street. All seats were taken inside, so Sherlock leaned against the bar. He paid the bartender for a foaming glass of the ubiquitous local draft and exchanged polite nods with a couple he'd worked with to bale straw a few days prior. All hands were needed on Mrs Radu's farm and he'd been judged fit enough to render service until his departure. Looking around he saw other familiar figures. Unconsciously plucking details from the worn shoes
"I don't remember anything about what led to it. The first time I overdosed. I woke up in hospital. My mother was there."
John froze. Well, he hadn't been moving, technically, but his breath halted and his limbs tensed. Adler's words pounded through his mind, echoing the thrum of his pulse.
The detective gestured dismissively, but John's loving, stern head shake gave him pause. "Alright. I grant that." A raised eyebrow from John. "And some. Both of us have suffered. But why then do we keep coming back?"
"Exaggerating then. I'm sure Watson has made good progress." He stood up to move closer to the two of them, and a glimmer of the love he'd shown earlier echoed on his features as he looked down at the young girl. If John hadn't seen the unshuttered version of that look, he might have missed or dismissed this slight display of fondness. Sherlock looked up at John and the expression lingered. Some energy in the man settled. "But it's been far too long that you've taken care of others." He went on even more quietly, "Accept some help, John. Please."
"Yes." The love in his eyes shifted to a fondness she realized was for her alone. "You certainly are. I.." His voice roughened and he looked back at Rosie. "I'm not certain I can ever repay you for all you've done for me. For us, really." The glow in his eyes spilled away. A darkness took away the light.
From the beach beyond, a call went out. Figures reclining or leaning against the rail pointed across the jelly-spangled cove. A few muffled voices called names. Feet pounded across the ground. Phones lit.
No, we didn't. You left before the slow songs were done. You bloody dance with Janine and you won't come back to me.
"And you can join a smaller group of students if you'd like. Find learners at your level so you can look to them for support and you can help them. Being there with little kids and big kids seemed to confuse you. You weren't sure quite how to interact with either group."
"Mate, you realize she's having trouble holding the bits of cheese we give her to eat, right? I don't think she could handle your violin just yet."
"Yes, you bloody well must. Now you were going to tell me when you realized you were in love with me, right?"
John rolled his eyes. "Can you not allow her to have a moment of triumph? That was fantastic, Sherlock. Sure you must admit."
John's absence from his side had been a continual ache.  Scrubbing his lab equipment and beekeeping supplies while pondering the stochastic pattern of the break-ins, he'd imagined he could hear the snip of John's cutters or thwack of his axe. When he wrapped Lestrade's bleeding hand in a tea towel and sent him packing off to the clinic, his heart had skipped across the lanes to contemplate jumper-clad, hunched shoulders and stress tousled silver-gold hair.
Sherlock hooded his eyes in a curiously feline gesture of satisfaction. "What did she tell me, John?" he rumbled.
Slipping into the driver's seat, he leaned into the back seat and put a warm, reassuring hand on Rosie. Her sounds quieted as he whispered loving nonsense and rubbed her belly soothingly. She calmed further as he put the car into gear and set off. The immediate task was near completion: moving back to Baker Street. The next paired set of concerns took its place in John's mind: making 221B safe for Rosie and finding a way for her to fit into life there without intruding unduly on Sherlock. Problem solving steadied him just as the movement of the car lulled the frayed nerves of his daughter.
He adjusted his sunglasses as he slid down in one of the low folding chairs they'd brought. He was settled in amongst the extra clothes, food hamper, and their stack of books: John's omnipresent novel, the monographs currently obsessing Sherlock, and the pile Watson had insisted they bring along despite all her active plans for the day. Bottom-most was a large volume with hand drawn mountains and runes gracing the cover. They were reading the Hobbit out loud as a family, though Rosie was reading ahead as well.
Sherlock continued to observe. He felt the texture of John's chest against his cheek. Watson was quiet in the monitor. But from the quality of the light in the window and the movements the child was beginning to make, Sherlock knew soon they would need to rise and attend. He welcomed it all.
"My friend? Oh, you mean Peterson. What has John been saying? My--" he blinked thinking, "fellow former addict acquaintance, was properly rewarded for his honesty in coming forward about the bird and the stone. We saw to that." His eyes flashed with righteous anger, then the expression on his face mellowed. "And at John's timely suggestion, the proceeds from the birds, and half of the reward money are being donated to charity." His smile expressed all the fondness his words avoided. "And," he tapped his chest, indicating the contents of an inner pocket. "We claimed the other half of the reward money. Which should be quite adequate to take care of several of this one's needs in the New Year." He looked down at the child in his lap not bothering to censor the feelings showing on his face. Martha warmed herself at the sight.
What noxious impulse had set him to play something now? When what he wanted to was to weep with his bow. To be home, alone and defended in his sanctuary to mourn in peace. The admonishments by friends of John's inevitable drift away, helpful salt for the wound, were nothing to the reassurances he'd received from the man himself. They had the Work. Nothing would change. He'd come over all the time. They'd keep on with cases.
"Who cares what they think. I still think you should eliminate that job and work full time with me."
Doctor Bogdan had brought the limp figure to her early one morning. Dark, curly hair matted and body laced with wounds. He had been robbed and beaten in Serbia, needed a place to recover. A shed on her land gave him some shelter and her the prospect of some extra income. He wasn't the first
Twin furrowed brows and expressive frowns told John he might have made a mistake.  The affronted cry of his child and an aggressive lean out of his arms in the direction of his flatmate made sure he understood the degree of his crime. He attempted to juggle Rosie for a moment, shushing her and trying to comfort. Then he realized it was a lost cause and surrendered her to the now ever so slightly smirking detective.
