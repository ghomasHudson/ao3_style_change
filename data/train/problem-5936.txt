Tony hold’s Steve’s gaze for a few moments. ‘You really don’t ever stop with those goddamn speeches do you?’
‘I’ll go,’ Steve says, standing up. ‘It might give us chance to…’ He doesn’t finish, he doesn’t need to. Everyone in the room knows that he and Tony need to talk. No one knows the true extent of why.
Seriously thank you so much to everyone who is reading this story, everyone who has left kudos, and especially everyone who is continuing, and starting, to leave comments. I cannot thank you enough!
Sam sighs and goes to the same side as the dark haired man, incidentally where he can also keep an eye on the rest of the team, and starts his sanding down again. ‘You know I don’t know why Tony doesn’t just give us a robot to do this,’ he says to start up the conversation again.
‘I’m on it,’ Bucky cuts Natasha off, grabbing an alien’s discarded sword in his metal arm and running full speed towards the beast. ‘Pete? When I say I need you to get it to rear up alright? Or at least get its head up.’
‘Thought I’d give you a hand and bring at least one over for you. Though seeing the mess you made of it, I’m surprised they keep you around, Penis Parker. Maybe they just feel sorry for you. I know I would.’
‘Over there,’ Wong points to the junction. The four of them hurry along the street, Steve and Tony moving people out of the way of flying debris. As they turn the corner what they see grips Tony’s heart with the kind of fear he hasn’t felt since he was flying above these very skies with a bomb above him. There’s a spaceship spinning in the air above the street, slowly coming to rest on the ground.
‘You are awake,’ the woman has a frankly creepy voice, but it’s not bad to listen to exactly. Just something about it that makes me nervous. ‘I was wondering if you would wake up any time soon. But then using Infinity Stones does take a phenomenal amount of energy.’
Tony takes advantage of the betting in how long it’s going to take for Peter to get knocked out by one of Wanda’s flying possessions to get Steve to join him in his workshop for his dancing lesson.
Clint has an arrow to his bow faster than Steve can blink, and Natasha has her guns up. Immediately the former spy lowers them when she sees the newcomer. ‘Daredevil.’
‘Can we please get back to the topic of impending doom?’ Tony asks, then sighs. ‘There’s something else I need to tell you about…’
‘What kind of fucked up question is that?’ Bucky growls. ‘She was being manipulated by HYDRA, and she helped the team, she saved countless lives and she’s lost so much, of course she deserves-’
‘Yes, Colonel Killjoy,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘We promise not to misbehave, now put the kiddie reins away.’
Tony shrugs, wishing even more that he’d allowed himself that drink. When he dares to look up, he sees a patient face and eyes asking him to explain. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that, before he became a sentient being, Vision was JARVIS. Vision knows him better than anyone, even Pepper; which meant he was the most patient with him.
‘We’re going home,’ he replies. ‘In more ways than one,’ he mutters to himself, raising a hand in farewell to T’Challa as they lift off from the rooftop of the Wakandan Embassy. ‘Sam? Can you check on Steve for me?’
‘The possibilities are endless,’ Bruce enters the discussion. ‘I mean let’s just take Steve for example, there could easily be realities where he never became Captain America and wasn’t accepted for the serum program and it was given to someone else. Or realities where Erskine wasn’t killed and so Steve wasn’t the only one they gave it to. Or even a reality where he didn’t crash the plane in the war and came home at the end. Or one where he even joined HYDRA. Or even-’
The rest of the team turn up in pairs or threes. Steve and Scott have made sure Hammer is secured and are doing their best to patch up Tony. Rhodes is the first to arrive, bringing an injured Clint who is clutching an arm with a grimace of pain; the military man replaces Scott at the inventor’s side and, with their basic military training, he and Steve do what they can to get Tony stable. Scott sees to Clint in the meantime and by the time Natasha arrives, supporting an exhausted Wanda, Clint is heading to the controls at the front of the ship ready to take off when everyone is back.
‘Alright?’ Peter can feel his stomach sinking. He knows he messed up badly with Beck, and he’s been hoping to put off this conversation as long as possible.
Tony feels his heart ache a little and pulls her into a hug. ‘Well,’ he says after a couple of seconds, ‘sounds like we’ve got our work cut out for us.’ He pulls away and smiles at her. ‘We’ve got a lot of Christmases to make up for you, and don’t even get me started on the amount the two old men who decided napping in ice is a good idea managed to miss between them. At this rate we’ll still be celebrating by the time next Christmas comes around.’ Wanda laughs, and Sam and Rhodes snigger behind him.
‘Because he started throwing dough in an attempt to start a food fight,’ Sam answers from the other end of the counter where he’s still got a little bit of flour stuck to one eyebrow.
‘It wasn’t all bad,’ Tony says into the quiet that follows, walking half in a trance through the room towards the piano. The last time he’d seen his mother she’d been playing it. ‘It was just…’ he struggles to find the right word. ‘It was
‘Wanda, darling, are we really going to keep on with this or are you going to come back to good ol’ Agatha?’
‘He’s right,’ Wanda says from his other side. ‘It’s really not. I mean after the initial surprise of course.’
‘Pepper asked me to look through some things for SI. A couple of projects that we’ve been funding and are up for review. She wants to know what my opinion is on them all and then she can make final calls.’
Rumlow glares at him. Technically Steve is the same rank as Rumlow, but as he and Bucky are currently on forced medical absence he has to defer to Rumlow while they work towards getting back into active service. Not that Bucky will ever be able to get back into active service if they can’t solve the problem with his arm.
Natasha laughs and waves him off, watching as he joins the other two, slinging an arm around both of them.
‘This kid seemed to think he was one of your interns,’ the terrorist says, Tony can’t make out any features other than dark eyes, most of his face covered by a woollen mask. Man these guys really need to find some originality.
‘This is true,’ he sighs, ‘I suppose that is what has been holding me back about deciding: that I am scared I will be trapped in a single place. Whereas I know that in reality they will encourage and help with any travels I do decide I want to go on.’
‘Tony could you at least turn and look at me? Please?’ he tries to keep the frustration out of his voice and sighs when Tony’s shoulders tense up but he doesn’t turn around. ‘Alright, well, just listen then. I-’ Steve pauses, thinking that starting this conversation about him was not the best way to do things. ‘No, first: thank you, Tony. For everything you’ve done to get the team back together, for what you’re doing for us now, not just with being a buffer for the media, and for trying to keep us together in the first place. And for everything you did even before that. I don’t think we’ve said thank you enough.’
Thank you so much to everyone who is continuing to read my inane ramblings. Do let me know if there is anything in the future you'd like to see!
‘Well I better get back to Elsa before he and Rhodes plot my downfall. Introducing those two was the biggest mistake of my life, and it’ll only get worse when Pepper comes round,’ he says, standing quickly before he makes an idiot of himself.
Opening his eyes he moves just enough to be able to look at the soldier. ‘Good morning,’ he presses a kiss to the man’s lips, slipping an arm out from between them to keep his head close.
Cardy sits back and speaks with the people either side of him. Ross isn’t given much input and this gives Tony a rather smug feeling which he tries to keep off his face. He’s not sure he succeeds.
Feeling her panic ebb away, she opens her eyes again and looks over at the man next to her, brow furrowed in thought.
‘We’re facing the biggest threat any of us could imagine, Barton,’ Nick interrupts, ‘we need to make friends where we can.’
‘Hang on do we all have different coffee blends?’ he asks, Natasha walks in at that moment and shoots him a worried glance.
‘You’ve been listening to me too well,’ she grumbles, turning to look out over the training room and letting one of the grenades go, deciding to spend some time moving it around and looking at the changes Tony has made to her glove rather than setting it off straight away.
‘And most importantly I want to say sorry for everything that happened around the Accords. I should have taken you aside and spoken to you properly about them instead of getting on my high horse,’ at this Tony lets out a snort, and then quiets down again. ‘I was the one who caused the team to pick sides, and didn’t even consider seeing if we could change them until it was too late. And all the time you were trying to get me to see there was more than one way out of the situation.’
knows how to find a way to control either of them it’s HYDRA. Let’s not forget that Francis, also working for them, now knows it’s possible to cross dimensions. We don’t know if he’s worked out how to do it, and if he has, they could have more than one Wanda with them. And the other Wanda might not be sunshine and rainbows like our one is. Point is we don’t
Peter holds Weasel’s gaze for a couple of moments, then looks down at the bar and just nods before pushing away, pulling Wanda with him.
Eventually they manage to take out Wanda by Peter waiting on the wall of one of the hangers and pelting her when she comes into view. Vision gets him with one before Wade takes him out of the game. FRIDAY also lets them know that Sam is out of the game too.  He drops to the floor and high fives Wade, grinning hugely as they look around for their next targets.
‘Clint’s next,’ Bruce says as the mercenary takes his seat again, ‘idiot wasn’t pacing himself earlier.’
The others laugh at Steve as he blushes bright red and buries his head into Tony’s hair to hide it. ‘You’re impossible,’ he mutters into his ear.
‘Wanda? I think she’s trying to make me her little brother or something. But she’s really cool, and her powers are awesome.’
‘My team,’ Tony answers quietly. ‘I suspected they went with you to Wakanda. I never asked because if I had it confirmed and Ross found out I’d never have been able to keep the changes made to the Accords. At least I knew they were safe.’
‘It’s one of the few potential leads we have,’ the teenager’s tone is firm, ‘and if it can get you back I’m doing it.’
‘Yes,’ Tony says, hating the heaviness in his heart as he says that and leads his secretary back into the party.
Tony chuckles and gestures for him to enter the Quinjet that’s resting on the rooftop just behind him. ‘Let’s go Spider-Man.’
‘And then,’ Tony says, ‘then there was the warrior known as the Honeybear, a brave and noble warrior who stood in the middle of the walkway and wouldn’t let anyone past. It is said that he once fought off an entire army of monsters, and didn’t even break a sweat.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Thought I'd start the new story with a double update, so I hope you enjoy. Please let me know what you think so far.
‘Well…that was kind of anti-climatic,’ Tony says. Wanda makes a sound that’s half sob and half laugh, and he reaches out to steady her. ‘Alright you two I’m getting you back up to Shuri. Get that stone
Red light as bright as the smile she gives him wraps around the ornament and it steadily glides to the top of the tree, resting firmly on the top.
‘Buzz off bird brain,’ he smacks the arm away. ‘Besides I say Wakanda tech is advanced all the time!’
‘Try it again and I’ll put you through the window,’ Peter’s arm are crossed over his chest. ‘Now is anyone else going to try and kill someone or can we get back to working out how to save the universe?’
Loki nods and looks behind him, to where Tony can now see a group of five other Jotun, one of whom he recognises as Lorena who they had met in Norway. ‘I need two of you to help take him back to the facility. Don’t let anything stop you.’ Two of them bow their heads and then rush forwards to help Wanda carry Vision. Then Loki turns back to Tony, gesturing to the alien at their feet. ‘Is he the only one?’
The mercenary frowns and glares at the vigilante. ‘Because he’s my friend you cock-sucking mother fucker. And strangely enough I do actually care about my friends.’
for something,’ he explains, refilling the glasses with the last of the scotch in the bottle. ‘For a long time I thought it was my fault that I had killed people with the weapons I created, and for not realising Stane was dealing under the table. But what I came to realise was that the blame was not solely on my shoulders. Yes I
‘Alright,’ he nods, knowing when not to push his best friend, ‘but I want Nat to go with you both and be extraction.’
‘Mr Stark, as much as I appreciate you wanting to support your protégé,’ the doctor says, ‘if you over-exert yourself you’ll set back your recovery. And I’m pretty sure you don’t want
‘Wait… I know that voice,’ Tony sees the moment the penny drops on Clint’s face and the archer’s expression turns dangerous. ‘Deadpool,’ he growls out.
There’s a few cheers from the class as they pack away their books. Peter smiles at Ned as his friend comes over, he’s still not able to stop talking about how awesome the weekend was, and Peter can’t find it in him to disagree. It has to have been his best birthday ever.
‘I’ll message Wade and get him to join us here once they’ve finished clearing up and debriefing with Fury,’ Steve’s voice is quiet and strained.
Steve doesn’t reply, just follows his friend back inside and up to the briefing room. Despite everything he feels a little lighter, and much more determined. Just like Bucky says: he’s going to get his fella back, and anyone who gets in the way was going to get hurt.
New Year arrives, complete with 'Dance Off' and a drinking contest. And there's a surprising winner of both
‘And why the fuck are they going to stop there? They’ve got our strongest team member; let’s be honest Wanda is our big gun. She’s the girl with all the fire power. None of us come close to her. I hate to tell you this as well Cap, but we’ve got to be honest: Barnes can take you out in a fight too. He’s the stronger of the super soldiers on our team, you just often get smarter than him. Pete, Thor and Hulk are the only ones with the strength to go up against that metal arm of his. And the worst bit? They’ve
‘Yeah how about no?’ Bruce says. ‘I just want to be left alone to do what I do best and not upset Hulk any more than I already have.’
To his event greater surprise, Clint looks a little ashamed as he shakes his head. ‘Avengers’ honour it’s safe.’
‘Peter why are you attacking a blind person?’ Steve demands as he comes over, having obviously seen the previous interaction.
He sighs, takes hold of the man’s wrist and, in a move Natasha had got him to perfect a couple of weeks ago, has the burly man pinned down against the bar with his arm twisted up behind him. ‘Don’t even try it,’ he says, releasing the man and hopping back up on the stool. He turns back to Weasel. ‘Believe me when I say you’re not going to get me to leave?’
‘Now, now children,’ Tony says, ‘that’s not in the spirit of the game. But let’s add the rule you have to catch someone unawares just to make it easier. And no bodily harm if you are caught please.’
‘Tell me we have the ones responsible,’ the king looks up at him with tear filled angry eyes. ‘Tell me we have the ones responsible for her death.’
Peter watches her enter an old warehouse. ‘Alright Karen, send a message to the team and activate the tracking beacon.’
‘Yeah cause those legal guardian forms I found printed are not just in case May ever lets you have joint custody,’ Steve chuckles.
Peter smiles. ‘Good, because I’ve wanted to call you that for a long time. You’re basically the dad I never even knew I wanted but you just came and filled this space I didn’t even realise was there. And with Thanos…with nearly losing you,’ he tightens his hold on Tony, ‘I just wanted you to know that.’
‘Do you all carry guns with you all the time or am I just lucky?’ Tony asks. He raises an eyebrow at Luke and Blake. ‘Well who are you two going to point yours at?’
‘You’re the Spider-Man right?’ the man’s head tilts to one side, as if he’s looking towards Peter but not at the same time. ‘You’re supposed to be protecting this city but you let a madman like him run around?’
‘Stand down, Stark, or we put a bullet through the kid’s head.’ Around them the remnants of the force gather, guns pointing forwards. ‘We’re taking him back to the boss, it’s up to you if he’s alive or dead.’
So that’s why Captain America is currently standing next to wall, holding a glass of champagne and really wishing he could get drunk whilst trying desperately to hold off a panic attack. Because in about ten minutes he was going to have to dance. In front of people.
‘Pepper if they start misbehaving just glare at them and you’ll have them cowering in the corner. Ow!’ he rubs his arm. ‘What was that for?’
‘And he came from the mind stone that was inside of Loki’s sceptre, or at least in some way he did? Well the sceptre had been owned by HYDRA, Loki
‘Mr Stark?’ he can hear the tears in the teenager’s voice, then his brown head is in his vision. ‘Mr Stark why did you do that?’
‘Well…each of those futures could end up being real, just in another part of the multi-verse.’ Peter shrugs. ‘Like I said we’d need to ask Doctor Strange.’
Tony shakes his head and folds the letter up, putting it back in the envelope and looks over at the small bear sitting on the table a fond smile on his face. He remembers playing with Edward, and being devastated every time he had to leave it behind, the fact that his Aunt Peggy remembered made him happier than he could say.
‘And the Avengers will host it? So it’ll be us raising the money for charities?’ Sam asks. ‘What charity is it for?’
The soldier smiles and nods, stepping out onto the ice before he can second guess himself. Tony gently leads him around the rink, giving his hand a squeeze every so often, and never once letting go. Even when the other start to race up and down the centre, the two of them stay in their own little world.
‘Earth had three stones before and it was manageable,’ the Jotun king replies. ‘But I do not think we should test it by adding more.’
‘Wanda,’ gentle fingers under her chin make her face him, ‘I do not believe for one second that you would hurt anyone with your powers, intentional or otherwise. Everyone has a stumbling point with their abilities, and this is yours, and you
‘What the hell is he doing here?’ Clint demands, grabbing a knife from the breakfast bar and pointing the tip towards Loki.
‘Parker, Leeds, is there something you’d like to share with the rest of us?’ their teacher’s voice cuts right to the back of the classroom.
to launch his attack. Right when Tony’s caught up in his trial and the rest of the team is caught up with the UN. SHIELD was just damn lucky they could go to Pete for help. Where do you think Beck got the funding for all of his work? Because even if Tony was
‘Nope. I never met the guy before personally, and I haven’t mentioned to him how well I used to know his grandfather. But yeah, small world right?’
‘It’s better if you see for yourself,’ Vision replies, and pushes open the door, gesturing for Steve to go first.
Bucky pauses halfway to the door and sighs, feeling some of the fight leave his body. He hates talking about that time, hates remembering what he was forced to do for the very people he had tried to take down. He’d been wary of Vision before coming back, knowing what he did about his abilities and worrying the android would try and take over his mind; it was only Steve’s assurances that had meant he was willing to try and come back at all. If Wanda hadn’t been fighting on their side when he first met her he imagines he would have felt the same way about her. ‘They brainwashed me,’ he replies after a few moments of silence, not turning to face the god however. ‘They took away my memories, took away who I was. I was just a machine to be used as they wanted. I was their Fist.’ He looks down at his clenched metal hand. ‘They turned me into the thing I had started fighting against, and they nearly succeeded in making me kill Steve. If Thanos has people that can use mind control I want to know that what they did to me isn’t going to make it easier for him to turn me against my friends.’
‘That’s the best you can come up with? Care to explain why Spider-Man is walking around as an intern?’ the man growls. ‘You trying to sell me out to the Avengers? Was our invite just some elaborate plan to track me down? Because I told you before I’ve no interest in joining the superhero squad.’
A/N: Hi everyone. Sorry I'm late with this week's chapter, and I'm extra sorry that I still haven't had time to reply to all the wonderful comments that are being left. I'm hoping to catch up this week.
Bucky’s about to retort and then he pauses. Usually he gets nothing through their link from Loki except the words that the trickster is using, Bucky himself is still getting used to not letting his emotions come through the link at the same time, but this time he can
‘Because basically everyone knows who you are,’ Peter rolls his eyes. ‘Take it as a compliment.’ He turns back to Matt. ‘How’ve you been?’
The Yule Feast begins; the team decide on a new Christmas Eve tradition; and Valkyrie bonds with Nebula
‘Only because of what you taught me Mama Rhodes,’ he laughs, helping his friend settle his mother into her room.
When the knock comes at his door less than twenty minutes later Peter isn’t sure whether to ignore it, tell the person to come in, or tell them to fuck off again. He decides the last option is possibly the worst one, and the door opens before he can choose between the first two.
‘You get away from him you son of a bitch,’ the soldier growls, moving towards Thanos, hammer spinning at his side and the broken shield in his other hand. Tony can only kneel there and watch as Steve quite literally hands Thanos’ ass to him. When he sends the Titan flying through the trees he rushes over to Tony. ‘Here. The last stone,’ he rips it from his armour and holds it out to Tony, then seems to notice what kind of state he’s in. ‘Tony…you can’t do this.’
‘Why does no one believe I can be nice?’ he grumbles under his breath as he finally reaches the portal and steps through. As soon as he does he is nearly knocked off of his feet by Strange’s Cloak. ‘What are you doing you ridiculous creation?’
Peter takes it hesitantly. ‘Yeah you too, Captain, Sir.’ He still looks like he wants to high tail it out of this situation.
‘Oh don’t worry,’ he laughs, ‘they were always full of praise for the amazing Captain America and Sergeant Barnes the best sniper the US army ever saw.’
‘I’ll get someone on it,’ Tony says, typing some commands into his watch. ‘Is there anything we can do while you go off on your epic quest?’
‘You think you can keep up fly boy? Let’s have a competition. Winner gets their next turn to cook done by the losers,’ Bucky suggests.
‘Well they’d better believe it if we go through all this trouble to get them translated,’ Tony quips.
Sam had never found training to be the most interesting of activities when he was in the military, it was born out of necessity and only had brief moments of comradery. Training as part of the Avengers is very different. It’s still done out of necessity, but with the wide variety of gear and abilities available in the team it’s never boring and usually has more laughter than frustration.
Deadpool is quiet for a moment, then he sighs. ‘I’ve got to leave town tomorrow, Baby Boy. I’ve got a job.’
Tony’s not a huge fan of the training room. Oh sure he understands the importance of keeping up with training, he
‘I don’t want to walk into your workshop and find you with another puzzle on your neck,’ Rhodey’s soft voice adds and Tony has to fight the rising guilt at the memories that raises.
‘Right, yeah, sorry,’ Wade’s definitely spooked, Bucky realises, ‘it’s just…I shot the motherfucker in the head. He died. He
‘Let me get Tony onto it,’ Sam offers, ‘he can be discreet when he wants to be I promise. Or Natasha.’
‘I don’t think anyone expected it to last this long in fairness,’ Bucky says, ‘and we’ve had a couple of years to catch up on.’
‘Apparently it’s not sulking,’ Sam rolls his eyes, ‘he’s, and I quote, “processing to see how he can improve”.’
Bucky makes short work of the rest of the guards, then turns his gun on Hammer. ‘Did you seriously think that shit would work on me?’ the man demands, his Brooklyn accent thick.
Then, OF COURSE, Peter and Tin Can have an argument, Tin Can gets captured and we spend ages trying to find him. Oh and by the way? Peter knows who Daredevil is. Still hasn’t told me when that happened or how. Oh wait! But me and Petey Pie actually get together as well! Although he’s not happy I’m all responsible adult about it.
‘I take it you’ve had some not so friendly ones then?’ Steve asks as he deals out the cards for the three of them.
Okoye shouts a warning as a black van arrives on the scene, and it’s only Bucky’s reactions that save Steve and Wanda from being flattened.
‘Well that’s what happens when you take on the dream team,’ Peter laughs. When Wade finally sets him down he grins up at the man. ‘Tacos or chimichangas?’
‘Ok you’re rude but I like you,’ Shuri says and T’Challa groans. ‘And what are you talking about controlling the stone?’
‘We got back and had an argument,’ he chokes out between his sobs. ‘Then they turned up. He managed to deal with most of the helicopters, but I got one down to the ground and he said to check everyone was out the fight. Then I got hit by a rotor and one of them grabbed me and said they were taking me to their boss. Tony,’ he broke off with another sob, then took a deep breath. ‘He told them to leave me and he’d go with them.’ Steve feels like someone’s grabbing onto his lungs. ‘Nat? Please tell me he’s here. He didn’t go right? He’s still here? Nat, please. Please, he has to be.’ Natasha shushes him and pulls him back into a hug, rocking him backwards and forwards.
‘You think the Soul stone is the key to getting back the person you lost?’ Clint looks at the Guardians.
‘You need anything, Baby Boy,’ Wade says quietly as he places one last kiss to his mouth, ‘you tell me and I’ll be there.’
‘You don’t seem to have done as well as you thought, little spider,’ Francis crows from over Bucky’s shoulder. ‘So, I think we’ll be taking you to add to our little collection. How I am going to love breaking Wade by having him fight you.’
‘I’ll go over the footage we have of all the encounters with Beck and run diagnostics on EDITH and see what I can come up with,’ Tony says. ‘Peter you feeling up for helping?’
‘My mother passed away,’ she explains, and Tony sees a muscle in her jaw tick as she holds back her emotions, ‘the new director of SWORD seemed to think I should be grounded for a period of grief.’
Natasha raises an eyebrow and gives him a quick glance before focussing back on the road. ‘I looked up the police report afterwards by the way.’
‘We’re just leaving,’ Rumlow says, as if he’d never spoken. ‘So sorry you won’t be joining us at the ball, Cinderella.’
‘The only one you may have to protect me from is Pepper,’ he gives his friend a smirk. ‘Think you can get me into Tony’s workshop?’
‘I’ve latched onto your memory so we can watch it together,’ Strange explains, appearing as a ghostly figure next to him. ‘This will enable me to find the Symbiote’s signature in your mind and then allow me to search for any other trace of it. The longer we watch the better of an idea of its signature I will have. Do you mind?’
‘Sounds like a proper superhero holiday,’ the merc offers him the box of tacos that’s been waiting for his arrival. ‘Should I be warning the fire department? Or will it more likely be a horror film scenario that goes down? Ooo maybe I should start placing bets on who’d be the first to be killed.’
‘Hey, Captain sir, can I have a boost?’ Peter asks. Steve looks a little wary but nods and cups his hands as the kid runs at his, boosting him so high that he sails over the top of Sam. ‘Wow this is awesome!’ he shouts, then shoots webs at Sam’s back, effectively dragging himself through the air to land between his shoulders.
‘Settle down, kid,’ the man who has him says as he starts to struggle. The man manages to get his mask off and shoves the end of the gun into his face.
‘Since when has that ever stopped Tony?’ she asks, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to the door. ‘Off you go, soldier.’
‘Seriously?’ Natasha raises an eyebrow. ‘Because I’d say you would be pretty good considering your abilities.’
Thank you so much to everyone who is reading this story, who has left kudos and comments. I'm so sorry I haven't got around to replying to comments yet. Dad's been in hospital for surgery this month, so I've only just been getting the opportunity to write this story. I'm hoping to catch up with all my replies between Christmas and New Year, so keep your eyes peeled for those.
The leader shrugs. ‘Well if he doesn’t mean anything to you, then he’s not any use to me,’ he holds the gun a little straighter and turns to Peter. ‘Any last words, kid?’
did you not notice that Beck was insane? And how did you fall for all that alternate reality crap he pulled?’
‘I imagine you’re going to anyway.’ He does. ‘What the fuck do you want, Stark? I’ve got a bottle of whiskey to get through and Die Hard to watch and I know you’ve got better plans than spending Christmas Eve with me.’
It turns out Peter is a good source of information and suggestions, and when they’d told him what they needed his help on he’d been so enthusiastic that Wanda had given up trying to write everything down and Tony had to ask FRIDAY to make notes for them. Granted not all of his ideas were gold, but his suggestion that they try and do school visits has Tony’s mind racing with possibilities.
‘What? No!’ Peter says, eyes widening even further as he looks between all the occupants of the room. The giveaway that he’s lying comes from the panicked look of help he gives Wanda.
Steve’s about to ask something else when he notices a group of small portraits on the opposite wall. He feels tears burning at his eyes as he walks past the other two and takes in the familiar faces of his first team. Each of them has their name underneath, then a larger plaque beneath them all:
‘You let us all walk out of here unharmed, and take Dr Monroe to a little house party we have planned. The rest are yours.’
‘Well I take it I should join the other team to make things even?’ Vision says, returning from where he’s been helping Rhodes to set up the goals.
‘Now I know why the team comments on me talking so much,’ he mutters to himself. ‘Second floor,’ he tells the merc. ‘We need to get close so I can record the meeting and we can alert the police.’
‘If he did, he would not be able to use his sorceries for other means,’ Loki answers from behind Sam and Strange.
Peter shrugs. ‘My guess would be Redwing, but I’ve not found any proof yet. Hey Shuri? Can you keep my new project quiet for now please? Just until I’ve worked out what I want to take to Miss Potts.’
‘Shall I tell you what I think then?’ Steve says, trying to find a way past the wall the dark haired man has insisted on putting up. ‘I think that there’s something more to you liking Tony than you first let me believe isn’t there? Was it actually reciprocated at one stage?’
‘Yes, but I don’t want to get there too quickly. We’ll just be sitting ducks if we do; plus if the Jotuns are able to sense us somehow we’ll just be drawing them closer to where Loki and Tony are going to be, and I’d rather see if we can take one or two of them out before they reach their intended targets.’
Tony shakes his head. ‘That’s what some of the calls are I need to make. Just- just trust me on this ok? The less anyone else knows the more you can deny if it goes wrong.’
Tony doesn’t get a lot of sleep so he gets to breakfast a lot earlier than normal; he says a brief hello to Steve, Bucky and Natasha who are all sat finishing off their own meals.
‘I wouldn’t have called it ‘begging’ exactly. And you needed the help in the end!’ Rhodes replies, offering Bucky a drink.
‘It is indeed,’ he replies, ‘in fact I can do two brands of magic: Asgardian and Jotun. Though some would argue that the Jotun one is not really magic, and more abilities inherent to the race.’
‘Just get Captain Rogers to speak to him,’ Loki opens a book and goes back to reading. ‘He’ll get Tony to change his mind.’
-Must you think so loudly?- a familiar voice demands. –My headache is bad enough as it is without you contributing as well.-
‘What are you not telling me?’ Fury asks when Steve finishes updating him on his conversation with Wade.
‘One more move, Captain, and this whole place goes up. Now give me back Anthony, or all of you are paying the price for trying to save him.’ Steve pauses at Hammer’s words.
‘Well this is going to be fun,’ Wade mumbles, pressing a quick kiss to Peter’s cheek. ‘I love you,’ he mumbles in his ear, ‘I’m sorry I didn’t tell you before.’
‘Come on, Cap, everyone knows how much you love to dance it seems,’ Tony laughs, swapping with his partner.
‘He’s not even going to be able to get close enough to Pete to see him,’ Bucky growls, then goes to the front of the jet. ‘If we’re all going in I’m going to find somewhere else for us to put this jet down. I think Stevie might actually kill me if someone stole our quinjet.’
Peter feels his heart break at the words, seeing the vulnerability in the brown eyes. ‘Oh Wade. I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have made you feel like that.’
‘My revealing your secret, Wade,’ Loki says, standing up and pulling his own sweater on, ‘was merely so that proper gratitude can be expressed. Thank you for creating this. I believe these are supposed to “ugly” but I will admit to enjoying wearing mine.’
‘I’m not sure what I’ve done to deserve you,’ Tony replies as he feels sleep creeping up on him. ‘Trust me I’ll tell you if I don’t want you here for some reason. Not that I can think of a possible one right now.’
Tony nods. ‘I had a little heart to heart with our spider earlier. Seems he wasn’t too keen on you spending Christmas alone.’
‘No because…’ he sighs and then continues. ‘I don’t know if he’ll be wearing his mask or not and he… well he has a lot of scars from the bit of skin I’ve seen when we’ve been eating and he’s really self-conscious about them. I don’t think he’d be comfortable if there was someone he doesn’t know there.’
‘It also means he gets first choice in partner for the snowball fight tomorrow,’ Steve reminds them over Sam’s cheers and Valkyrie’s complaints.
‘What are you two doing up so late?’ Tony asks as he steps into the common area, Natasha next to him. They’d been to see the Council and were obviously just getting back.
The team launch a raid to get Tony back, everything seems to be going well until they run into a familiar face.
It’s true, the dark blue dress she has on makes her look stunning. ‘Thank you,’ she says, smiling widely. ‘You don’t scrub up too bad yourself, little brother. Should I be coming to your school dance to keep all the girls off?’
‘And secondly so I know I can do this,’ he grabs the man’s arm and gives him a strong tug towards him, ‘before doing this.’ He presses a kiss to Wade’s lips, feeling himself relax as the man’s arms go around him. ‘I’m not exactly able to do that in front of people that think I’d struggle to arm wrestle MJ can I?’
Tony can feel the headache pressing against the back of his eyes by the time he finally makes it to his room and has to resist the urge to fall face first onto his bed, knowing it would only make his chest hurt. Instead he settles for sitting down and then laying on his side, staring out of his window at the night sky and wondering if it could give him any answers.
The atmosphere in the room gets tense. ‘I’ll go get him,’ Peter says, hopping down from his stool at the breakfast bar.
It’s not a question. He and the mercenary hold each other’s gaze for a few moments before the other man sighs and, looking back at the plates stacked on the side, just nods.
Loki opens the basket and is greeted by a cold nose and a pair of blue eyes. ‘What-’ the occupant of the basket cuts him off by jumping out into his lap, and only being saved from falling to the floor by Loki’s swift reactions.
‘But he didn’t do anything,’ Peter protests, ‘I just forgot to eat extra when I was in the lab. I just need to remember everything I do when I’m not
‘Oh sorry, of course,’ Peter moves along and the blind man slides in next to him; he notices Loki giving the two of them interested glances and wonders how he’s going to keep the man’s other identity a secret from the trickster. Loki was very good at hiding what he knew when he wanted to be, and also very good at reading other people. ‘Loki this is Matt Murdoch, from the law firm in town; Matt this is Loki.’
‘You promised you wouldn’t say anything,’ Tony reminds him. ‘Now why don’t you go be a gentleman and help bring the things up from the car? I’ll find a way to torment Bucky and then come help.’
‘Scott’s here?’ Tony frowns. ‘Alright tell them we’ll be up in a minute. Come on, kid, let’s get you out your mad scientist gear. Try not to eat him.’
Baby Boy, you trying to get me put in prison? There’s only so much self-control I have. Look,’ he holds up his hands to stop whatever Peter is about to say, ‘I’m not saying I don’t want this but… Peter you’re still in school and you have a lot going on and I don’t want something with us to screw it up for you. I’m assuming Tin Can wants you staying in school and getting a degree and all that and, honestly, I agree with him. You need some normality in your life, and a crazy mercenary for a boyfriend doesn’t fit in that.’
‘That makes two of you then,’ she says through a small laugh. ‘You’ll be best friends again in no time, Steve. You work too well together not to. Just be patient with him, you know how much he hates heart-to-heart conversations.’
‘Here we are,’ August says, gesturing with outstretched arms. ‘The markings are over here.’ He leads them to the far wall where Steve can see there are some markings carved into the wall.
Valkyrie laughs, grabbing hold of the youngster’s shoulder and dragging him up to his feet. ‘Oh stop whining. You guys are just handling him the wrong way.’
‘I’m sorry, I know,’ she says, pulling away and drying her eyes, trying to slip on her pristine mask once more. ‘I just- he’s been worse than when he got back from Afghanistan, Rhodey, and I’ve not been able to help him. I’ve not been able to
‘No,’ the leader responds. ‘We wait for the pick up. They need her,’ he gestures towards Dr Monroe. There’s a few moments quiet while everyone, terrorist and hostage alike, are focussed on the leader. Peter wonders if now would be a good time to make a move, but before he can make a decision the leader turns to look at him with a slight smile. Suddenly he wishes he could relive Homecoming night. ‘The kid said he was a Stark intern right? Put your vest on him Carl. We’re paying a little visit to Iron Man.’
‘But she doesn’t blame Bucky for that. I know her well enough to know she wouldn’t blame someone else for her actions without
time and you never let me live it down. It’s not like I could do what you did to help her anyway. And it’s not like science was
Peter and Steve tackle the end of the obstacle course; and Peter goes to train in his suit with Wade.
‘Why don’t we take a break?’ Steve suggests. ‘We’ve been walking for a couple of hours, it might be a good idea to check in with the other two.’
‘Apologies,’ Loki groans from where he’s holding his head in his hands. ‘I didn’t mean to be quite so forceful. Your mind was so loud it was causing my headache to get worse so I formed a barrier between your mind and my own to block out your thoughts. In my haste I was more forceful than intended, hence why it caused you pain. When this headache has subsided I shall teach you how to do it so you can shut me out should you wish to for the duration of this bond.’
‘Sore. Like I’m getting a sensory-overload headache. I got them loads when I first got my powers, but I’ve managed the sensory input since so that doesn’t happen anymore.’
as well as Tony,’ she snaps. ‘I couldn’t live with myself if you got hurt whilst we were trying to save him. And you can bet anything that Tony would have my hide if I let you come along. If you’re there Pete he’ll be too distracted keeping you safe to focus on getting out. We can’t risk that. Understand?’ He frowns but nods. She stands up to leave and he scrambles to his feet. ‘Don’t stop what you’re doing now though, you’ve made more progress than we have. Seems you’ve got some good contacts, Spider-Man.’
Everyone had been so drained from the past couple of days that they called it an early night at the facility. Tony smiles as Steve returns to their bedroom, the last of his possessions from his old room in his arms.
‘Yes. Incidentally my aforementioned former partner also apparently organised a hit on that date. A hit he contacted an accomplished army sniper about who just so happened to be on leave. Care to guess who the intended target was?’
Wanda’s smile seems to come a little easier this time. ‘Right,’ she nods. ‘This isn’t as carefree as that gala we did before with Stark Industries is it?’
Tony laughs. ‘Good point. Alright let’s see what Cap thinks about checking these out; it won’t need many of us to go. Could use it as an excuse to have a quick holiday.’
‘We lost contact with the group in Norway,’ she tells them both. ‘FRIDAY said she lost contact after Tony’s suit was activated. They went to visit a dig where there were signs of Frost Giant activity.’
Steve sighs, letting Tony’s hand fall from his. ‘Alright. Long story short, something seems to have gone wrong when the arm was being attached to his brain and now it only works intermittently, it’s causing him huge amounts of pain that even the strongest painkillers can only take the edge off, and there’s an infection set in that the doctors can’t get under control.’
‘Only a little, Vis,’ Wanda laughs, then takes him over to where Sam, Bucky and Rhodes are sat with Peter and Natasha.
‘There’s a sofa over there we can put him on,’ he tells Steve, pointing to a space behind him and walking over to grab a pillow and blankets. ‘He has it here for power naps.’
Tony waves him off. ‘Honestly I should be thanking you. The fact that it’s been so successful has meant the board is happy to give me the go ahead to put more focus into it.’
‘Just…with Nebula having lost Gamora, got me realising how lucky we were we didn’t lose anyone else. I’m not sure what I’d do without you Nat, you’re my best friend and a sister to me, and it’d break the kids to lose-’
‘There’s nothing here I can’t do back at the house now. Is there anything you want to grab while we’re here?’ he shuts down the screens, unable to look at any more information. Unable to face their failure for the moment.
He watches the trucks pull away, first Natasha’s and then his, then turns and starts running steadily down the road back towards the lab.
‘You should have learned never turn your back on an opponent unless they’re dead. Especially if they’re one renowned for pulling tricks,’ Loki growls and shoves his brother’s body off of the ice sword and watches it fall to the ground. ‘And I do not take well to people threatening my friends.’
‘My king,’ Lorena walks back into the common area and addresses Loki. ‘The bodies have been recovered and I have told Dagr to ready the army. Are there any more instructions?’
He takes a few steps back, blinking his eyes against the material of his mask and trying not to focus on the fact he can’t see. His hip catches one of the benches and he stumbles to the side. ‘I’m not sure about this,’ he says as he catches his balance.
‘Right,’ Natasha says, coming into the kitchen and putting her phone back in her pocket, ‘T’Challa’s confirmed that he and Shuri will be here for Yule, then they’ll go back to Wakanda for Christmas there and come back for New Year with Okoye, Nakia and W’Kabi.’
‘Alright stop!’ Tony cuts them all off, then moves to one of the sofas, patting the seat next to him. ‘Tell me what happened, kid.’
Steve laughs, standing up and bringing the inventor into a hug, pressing sloppy kisses all over the other man’s face. ‘I love you.’
‘What?’ Before he can process what Clint has said the archer points above his head, then darts in and presses a quick kiss to his lips. Loki barks out a laugh. ‘You tricked me, Barton, I’m impressed.’
‘Just wanted to check you weren’t going to work through the night and have an irate Captain to deal with tomorrow morning,’ he chuckles.
‘That’s for behaving way too much like Tin Can. Come on Lightning Bolt lets go find something fun to do.’
‘You mean you weren’t born in your tribe?’ Wanda asks, her voice is a lot quieter now than it ever was before, and Peter has to resist the urge to pull her into a hug.
‘I know, it’s just…it’s hard you know? He’s basically my brother, we’ve been through a lot together, and I can’t do anything to help him. And this party…it would have been the chance to speak to the people that have caused all this new set of problems and try to get it sorted, and Rumlow won’t let me go,’ he fists his hair in his frustration.
in this wardrobe and half of it he’s never worn in the first place. If he does decide he wants to complain after
‘Mistletoe!!!’ Wade shouts excitedly, before running off, grabbing Peter’s hand and dragging him towards the forest. ‘We’ll go get everyone Cap-e-tan!’
made attached to you, and I’ll be coming to help him with that so there’s no more chance of a screw up.’
‘The less you knew the less you could be accused of,’ Tony explains, finally looking away from his screen. ‘This way the only person who could be held accountable for planning Bucky’s escape was me.’ After a brief pause he adds. ‘Now how about we stop wasting time talking and actually get on with doing something?’
Steve pauses before replying, caught off guard with the topic of the conversation. ‘I don’t hold anything against you for it,’ he says carefully, ‘not anymore, not after you got everyone back together.’
There wasn’t a more fitting phrase ever said about Peggy, Steve muses as he looks up at the woman’s face, with the small smile he knew so well.
It seems Bucky’s discomfort is similar to his own, and not due to his lack of skill, as by the time Tony coaxes him halfway around the man is gliding fairly smoothly along the ice. Though he sees he keeps shooting glances at the exit near where Steve is sitting. As they come around to complete the lap Peter skates up alongside them.
Tony considers his next words before answering. ‘Bringing two back who are not going to be going into active duty gives us the opportunity to show those that will be that we can keep our side of any terms as long as they stick to theirs. It also gives all of us the opportunity to test how easy it will be to find mutually agreeable terms.’
‘Perhaps when you’re older,’ Strange says, catching Scott’s panicked expression over the top of the girl’s head, ‘and with
‘They’re friends, my king,’ she explains to him, ‘they are the ones Doctor Strange sent me to find.’
‘I’ll let you know when the team plans to move against them. If you want to take off one of the heads, feel free.’
‘No thanks,’ he says, straightening up and getting a chopping board out. ‘You mind going and telling the others it’ll be ready in about thirty minutes? Oh and tell Bucky it’s his turn to lay the table, since he’s managed to worm his way out of it the last three times.’
‘Outside, I got clear. But…Cap we need to leave,’ there’s a strange tone to Clint’s voice that Steve can’t place.
‘It’s my favourite,’ Natasha admits with a smile. When they are making their way through the rush hour traffic she adds: ‘So we saw in the news about you helping the police take out some gunmen.’
A/N: Hello everyone! I hope you've all had a good week and you enjoy this chapter, thank you for sticking with the story. Up next: the Battle of Wakanda begins.
He’s due to be picked up by the team on their way to the UN, Valkyrie is taking charge of the Asgardians and continuing to oversee the construction of New Asgard.
‘No they aren’t, you’re supposed to let us go to the common area until our time is up and we can return,’ Sam protests as he turns in a circle.
‘I see,’ Loki says, and Bucky feels the mental barrier between them strengthen and tries not to visibly wince. ‘I suppose you will want to do so first thing in the morning.’
‘Ok well let me tell you what the school told me then, shall I? That for a week you were either late with, or didn’t actually complete your homework assignments. And you missed half a day of school just before this all started.’
‘This is hardly scary,’ Loki rolls his eyes. ‘And if you think it is then I seriously doubt your abilities as a so-called superhero.’
‘But I don’t feel cold. Besides it’s too hot inside and makes me feel sick. Out here I feel better.’
It’s now four days before the Yule feast. Some of the team are in the city getting last minute presents, while the rest of them are decorating the outside and focussing on getting the tree carved into a table. Currently it’s Sam and Bucky on carving duty, which surprisingly the team were a little anxious about. They weren’t
‘So they should be back by the end of the week,’ Peter nods, then he sighs. ‘I don’t like everyone being in different places when we’re waiting for an enemy to turn up at our door. Seems like every episode of Scooby Doo where the gang splits up.’
Peter looks at her nervously for a moment, then nods. ‘There’s a screen along the back, if we can get through the door it’ll provide cover before we hit the aisle. At least two of the terrorists will be guarding it as it’s the main way in and out of the auditorium apart from the stage doors.’
‘Mask stays on,’ Wade’s tone is final as he looks down, then picks up one of his own tacos and realises his issue. ‘Well, mostly on.’
‘I’m an idiot,’ he grunts to himself. As Bucky heads towards him he raises his hand, praying that this is going to work, and lets a web fly, pulling himself up and out of reach of the dark-haired soldier.
‘I’ve got an idea,’ she says, and sends a small ball with images into his mind. She sees him processing the plan and then he nods.
‘I have FRIDAY recording everything from the minute I leave the facility,’ he explains. ‘You can do the same if you want, but I thought this would save some of your privacy.’
‘Steven Grant Rogers I swear to God if you say you are not going to fuck me through that mattress because I’m still recovering I am going to-’
Okoye appears at his side. ‘Thank you,’ she tells him, ‘I can protect them from here. You find out where they are coming from.’
‘I don’t see why not if you feel more comfortable doing it that way,’ the trickster responds, and Stephen breathes a quiet sigh of relief. Despite a large amount of the pain disappearing from his hands and them being much steadier than before, he’s positive that moulding the clay by hand would have been beyond him. Now all he has to do is decide what he’s going to make with it.
‘Woah. Hold on a second there, kid,’ Tony smiles at him. ‘Before we talk about that I want to talk about Beck.’
‘I can never make it right, Tony,’ Steve takes a few steps towards him, ‘I know I can’t. I’m not asking to. I’m not asking for you to take me back, not when you’re building a new life with Pepper, not when you’ve got everything you deserve within your grasp. I just…when you came off that ship and I saw you alive I just wanted to hold you again, and…’
It feels like it takes an hour, but it can’t be much more than ten minutes, before the debris are safely deposited in the park and she is sitting on a bench trying to catch her breath when the emergency services arrive. Pedestrians they managed to get out of the way of the falling building are coming over to thank them, some have brought them both food and drink to try and help give them back some energy. Vision diverts the police from asking her questions, sensing her tiredness, and fields all the questions himself.
Tony barely has time to return the hug before Peter’s running back to the car to open the trunk and collect the bags. ‘Merry Christmas, Pete,’ he replies, a little dazed. He looks at May’s harried expression and raises an eyebrow. ‘I’m guessing he’s been this excitable for a while?’
Valkyrie puts her hand on Nebula’s shoulder. ‘I am the last of the Valkyries; all the others were killed by Hela during our battle to contain her. My lover was killed protecting me. Ever since then I wandered around the galaxy, not wanting to put down roots anywhere because it was too painful to consider losing it all again. So I lost myself to drink and put up walls and pushed away the memories of any companionship I’d had with my battle-sisters and my lover.’
‘Bring up Bucky’s arm schematics, FRIDAY,’ Tony chokes out in response to his AI’s question. ‘It’s time I actually did some work on it.’
‘No that was me,’ Peter reappears in front of Steve, making him jump back in fright, he’s dangling upside down from the ceiling from one of his webs. ‘Mr Loki was explaining how he keeps the Tesseract hidden and I asked if it was possible to make someone invisible and then… well, I may have got a little carried away. But you’ve got to hear some of the stuff he can do, it’s amazing! And have you heard the story about when he turned Mr Thor into a toad?’
‘The trail is very faint. They are certainly not in the city. I’d be surprised if they are even in the country,’ the other sorcerer adds.
‘You cannot just walk in here and demand to see my patients!’ Doctor Blane is shouting as they approach Bucky’s door.
Agatha raises her hands, ready to cast her spell and Wanda can see her own power reflected in Agatha’s eyes.
‘Yeah,’ the man shoots him a small smile that warms his eyes, ‘what you surprised I got the brains to work on something as complex as a fully functioning replica of a human arm?’
‘Damn it,’ Quill curses, finishing lacing his boots. ‘I’m more worried about who is going to be helping Drax though.’
Unclipping her seat belt, she rolls to protect her head and then reaches up to check he’s breathing. She feels warm air coming from his nose and sags in relief.
‘You know if you don’t make an appearance soon Thor is literally going to come and break your door down right?’ Bucky says as he closes the door behind him.
‘You seem very keen to get rid of us for someone who doesn’t know the people we’re after,’ the first man says.
‘In the meantime,’ Natasha says from her spot on her sofa surrounded by Clint’s children, ‘we better update you on the Capture the Flag.’
‘Seriously?’ Valkyrie looks at her king as if he’s grown an extra head. ‘You were a prince and you never learnt the dances?’
Tony just laughs and pulls Steve closer, making sure the man’s hands mirrored his own. ‘A woman will usually put her hand on your shoulder,’ he explains, ‘but as we’ll be swapping who is leading it’ll be easier to have both of us have another hand on the waist.’
The alien wraps it’s fist around the chain and yanks, sending the teenager flying over Tony’s head and it’s only quick reflexes which enable him to dart up and back to be able to catch him before he hits the tree he’d previously tied the alien to.
times. Trust me when you’ve seen the Winter Soldier before coffee in the morning nothing scares you anymore.’
‘Plus if someone comes to attack you, you have two weapons attached to the bottom of your feet,’ she grins.
‘Yeah right,’ he replies, a small smirk on his face. ‘And you’ll stop with all the mouthy comments.’
‘We’ve got big trouble heading our way,’ Tony explains before he can get a word in, ‘of the universe ending kind by the sounds of it. Peter here seems to think you may be of some help; and considering you helped save my life, I might be inclined to agree if you manage to behave yourself.’
‘I haven’t actually said much to you at all this evening,’ Tony quips as he opens the door and walks through, taking a seat at one of the chairs in the double room.
Tony groans. ‘Uh, yeah it was Peggy’s nickname for me. My middle is Edward and she gave it to me, so she used to call me Teddy when I was little. I’m so glad she stopped it as I grew up. Uncle Gabe died before she stopped so he rarely called me Tony.
A/N: I'm a terrible human being I totally forgot I hadn't updated this week! I'm so sorry! I hope you enjoyed this chapter, although it is a little bit of character bonding rather than pushing the story forwards.
he looks up from the solid pillow he’s made use of during the night to remember Steve had stayed. Propping himself up on his elbow he takes advantage of the rare opportunity to properly look at the soldier at ease; one of Steve’s arms is wrapped around his waist and it tightens a little in his sleep as Tony moves, and the inventor can’t help but smile when he settles again, face turning to him in his sleep.
‘Don’t you start going paranoid on me, Pool, or I swear you won’t be able to talk for webbing for a year,’ he growls.
‘You’re getting it, Hermione, stop beating yourself up,’ Tony says, voice calm. ‘Now let’s try something different.’
‘I don’t know if I should be offended or not,’ Thor admits to Natasha as they bid Valkyrie farewell and head back to the Quinjet.
Peter cuts him off by reaching up, using his wall climbing ability to grab onto the merc’s shoulders and levering himself up to press a kiss to the merc’s mouth. He can tell the man’s surprised as it takes him a couple of moments to think to wrap his arms around his waist.
‘One thing at a time, Cap,’ Tony says gently, putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder. ‘How about you three go and debrief with Fury? We’ll get hold of Strange and see if we can get some of this multi-verse stuff cleared up. Then we can discuss more about it later. Like after dinner when everyone is rested and fed.’
Matt seems to study him for a few moments, and Peter is beginning to wonder if the man actually can see, when the tension releases from his shoulders and he nods, gripping his cane in both hands. ‘Alright, Peter. And thank you.’
‘Cap!’ Sam leans out the door and shouts down the corridor. ‘Your boyfriend’s finally lost it and he’s taken Nat with him on the crazy train!’
what you’re calling it these days?’ she raises an eyebrow with a slight smirk. ‘Looks like much more than a conversation if you ask me.’
‘Just about,’ comes the reply, ‘we’ve got three people stuck in here with us. Hulk came out and managed to catch the roof, but I don’t think he can move it without anything coming down and crushing the rest of us.’
‘I love you, Spidey!’ he hears the merc shout as he drops from the side of the building, firing a web and heading back towards home.
‘Aright, Pete you take your group up to their rooms, we’ll get everyone else settled in. Meet in Briefing Room Five in thirty minutes. Don’t be late!’
dancer- and she makes the most amazing stew I have ever tasted in the world. Then she’ll turn round and teach you how to take someone out with a napkin. Honestly? Best piece of advice I’ve ever been given was how to knock someone out with a napkin. One day I’ll teach you. Just…don’t tell your Mom alright?’
‘Well we’ve got ours, there’s the Iron Man and Winter Soldier ones,’ Sam reaches into the box, then laughs as he pulls out a green one with a santa hat wearing Hulk on the front. ‘There’s Bruce’s; Steve’s and Wanda’s; Rhodey, Clint, Thor, even a Loki one.’
‘I’m so going to enjoy putting you on your ass again,’ he grunts as he dodges a flurry of attacks from the ex-assassin.
‘Well everyone can agree you’ve definitely improved me,’ Tony says quietly, pressing a kiss to the spot between his shoulder blades and continuing his ministrations. Steve’s happy to just relax into his partner’s touch and their quiet conversation for the rest of the evening.
‘Thanos is after the Infinity Stones,’ Bruce explains, ‘currently we have the three stones on Earth all in this room at once. At least,’ he looks to Loki, ‘I assume we do?’
Really it’s sickening how much Steve has him wrapped around his finger. He really should do something about that.
As always do let me know what you think and if there is anything in particular you'd like to see. I hope you're still enjoying the story.
Steve fumbles with the tie at his neck, his fingers shaking with thoughts on what he's about to do. 'Dammit!' he curses as the material once again slips through his fingers.
‘We shall continue to do what we can for the situation in the UN,’ T’Challa agrees. ‘Though I can’t yet say if this situation will help or hinder our cause.’
He tries not to grin at the confused look on the mercenary’s scarred face as he opens the pack of paper. ‘Well I mean it might but you know I’m not the best at focussing and there’s a
‘Yeah,’ he admits, feeling another wave of dizziness and closing his eyes, fighting back the need to shiver as his stomach turns. They sit in silence until Tony puts a platter in front of him.
The coffee pot is just finishing as he reaches it. He smiles to himself and reaches into one of the cupboards to find a mug. ‘Thanks, FRIDAY. I appreciate you having it ready for me,’ he tells the AI as he starts to pour the hot liquid.
