Dean breathed a laugh, the last of his nerves leaving him. What indeed? Honestly, he hadn’t thought he’d even get this far. He looked at their hands again. “Promise you’ll stay.”
Sam watched him go and sighed. He looked up and shook his head. "Alright Cas, I don't know where you ended up, but I need you to come back here. Something's really wrong with Dean. I'm on the first floor of the house at 472 Main Street in a town fifty miles west of Oklahoma City."
Beckett seemed to be a little more worried about going into a building they thought housed werewolves than Sam was, but the inside of the house was relatively normal, as far as he could tell. The walls were bright and there was a general feeling of home in the air. The sounds of children playing came down from upstairs. There were scratches on the banister, but the house was old, so Beckett didn't think that was too strange.
Cas was already there by the time Dean and Miracle reached the hill from the day before; Dean could see him from down the path, silhouetted in the dim morning light. How early did this guy get there? On a whim, Dean took his phone out and took a picture. On the phone screen, it was impossible to tell who it really was, and besides, it was a nice shot, if Dean did say so himself.
“Yeah. I’ve seen him a couple of days this week,” Dean replied. Then he figured he might as well say something, since if he didn’t Cas probably would. “He came over for breakfast yesterday.”
Cas nods and glances over at Dean. “Thank you.” He smiles when Dean pats him on the shoulder as he stands. Cas pauses in his work, removes his gloves, and sits back to watch Dean walk back inside. He waves when Dean pauses at the door to look back. He smiles wider at the goofy grin Dean gives him.
After the light dissipated, Beckett found himself on a cot in a familiar room. It had been so long since he'd been there that he'd almost forgotten what it looked like.
With that, Cas turned his attention to Dean. He wanted to help Dean stand, wanted to heal his wounds and hold him and tell him that everything would be okay now, but he was stopped by the look on Dean’s face. It was hard to describe, hard to process. He was surprised, that was for sure, but he also looked lost, and hopeful, and terrified, and relieved, and, and, and… And Cas simply couldn’t make a move to him. All he could manage was a quiet, “Dean.”
"So this is what you do for a living," Beckett said, checking to make sure the bandage on his arm was snug.
This early on a Saturday, there wasn’t much traffic. The drive was easy, and thankfully the rain had let up a little by the time they pulled into Dean’s driveway.
They sat in silence while Dean ate, and Dean didn’t seem to be in any hurry for Cas to leave. “Can’t believe we’re both alive eight years later,” Dean said.
If nothing else, Cas was there. Cas would make sure nothing went wrong. Or at least, Dean hoped he could.
Dean made a face. He didn’t like the thought of having a wet dog in his car. And he figured Cas probably didn’t take his camera out in the rain. He pocketed his phone and watched Miracle in front of him, pensive. He had the wild idea to invite Cas over for breakfast instead. Tomorrow was Saturday, and inviting a friend over for
And now, Dean was sitting up in the waiting room, rubbing his head. He looked around at the blank walls, studying everything silently. It was a little rectangular room with a door on one of the shorter sides. Dean was sitting on a padded bench that seemed more like a cot the more he thought about it. There was a single chair on the other side.
"No, I'm not," Dean admitted, though he doubted he was hiding it very well at the moment. "My brother's life is in the hands of an amateur. I need to get back there before he screws it up."
"You know, Sammy, my brother, and I- we were on a case to save people. We always are. Your friend is a little late to the game."
Cas tilts his head to one side, but he’s caught on the sound of Dean’s footsteps, and the memory of Jack’s. Dean should be just a few feet outside the doorway. Five steps now. Four. Cas’ heart picks up when he thinks about what will happen when Dean’s footsteps never quite reach the doorway.
Jack knew Dean and Cas were answering phones every so often for now, but he also had a feeling they would bow out sooner or later. He had picked up on Dean talking more and more about Harvelle’s, and he had a feeling Dean wanted to go find it again and restore it. He knew that Sam and Eileen weren’t going out on as many hunts, were starting to prioritize the work they did at the bunker, though they were always ready to set out again if something came up close by.
“Don’t want to stop,” Dean said, his jaw set. It had been just about a full day since he’d had any sleep, and while he could feel it getting to him, he really just wanted to be home.
His snack barely took the edge off his hunger, but he figured he was going for lunch anyway, so it was fine. At least it gave him something else to think about on his way to the park.
“Maybe Eileen’s right,” Sam’s voice answers. He sounds tired. “Maybe it’s just the combination of coming back and losing his grace. Or Jack says it could just be the whole” – a brief pause, and Cas can almost see Sam gesturing as he searches for the words – “Empty experience.”
Cas had to agree. There were fewer hard lines on this map, larger tracts of connected space. “What now?”
Cas considered, then shrugged. “There are a few annual contests I like to enter. Some I’ll post for free use. I have a niece who likes to try to paint the landscapes.”
“You were under a spell,” Dean said. He managed to drag his face up to Cas’ level. “Don’t apologize for that. It wasn’t your fault.”
Cas manages to smile at him. “Better,” he says. Maybe lies. He holds tight when Jack hugs him. He can feel Jack testing him with his powers, making sure everything is as it should be.
Dean closed the distance between their lips carefully, not wanting to mess this up. He felt Cas’ hand gently touch the side of his face as their lips moved together, and tension seemed to melt out of his body. He managed to scoot himself closer to Cas without breaking their kiss too much, and he melted against Cas’ side when he felt Cas’ other hand snake around his waist.
Another step then. And another. He called out again. There was still no answer, so he kept calling. Every few steps. He prayed, as if Cas might be able to hear him that way instead.
They started in silence. The air still had a golden hue to it, but the temperature was slowly starting to drop.
In the moment of tense silence that followed, Dean wasn't sure if Sam was finished or not. Sam and Beckett looked around the room, still alert and waiting for a threat.
relieved to be asked. “I don’t want this,” he said, looking around the bunker. “I want to be home. I want to
The shaking stops after a time. Cas still isn’t sure what to make of what everyone is saying to him, but he allows himself to be pulled to his feet. Dean leads him down the hall, and he follows.
Dean eyed Cas suspiciously, but he crossed to a nearby tree and sank down to the base of the trunk and leaned against it. Then he held an arm out to Cas. “Come here,” he said.
Cas looks up at Dean, at the concern etched into every feature of that face. Something in him cracks wider. “I’ve got it.”
"No offense," Dean said, half-turning around, "but if I couldn't stop it, and Sammy couldn't stop it, and
She had a charger in the kitchen, so she plugged the phone in and while she waited for it to come back to life, she dug around for something to eat.
Cas pressed a button on the camera, made a show of inspecting the picture in the camera’s screen. “I don’t think you can photograph badly,” he said simply, turning the camera around so Dean could inspect the photograph.
"I only came to explain," Al said, turning to leave. "I need to get through to Sam so he can get out of your time as quickly as possible."
It was Cas’ turn to narrow his eyes suspiciously. He’d never quite had a choice in the matter, whether he was or not. “What do you mean?”
All that happens is Dean chokes on his next breath and wipes at his face with one hand. “Cas, what did the Empty
Cas’ stomach growls. “Thank you.” He takes a seat and stares at the table as he eats, despite the fact that Dean sits down right across from him. He smiles despite himself at the peanut butter that sticks to the roof of his mouth. The pb&j tastes almost as good as he remembers.
“Don’t be,” Dean said, grabbing Cas’ arm so he couldn’t go anywhere. He leaned forward ever so slightly. They’d had something for a long time – he knew that. It had been something else entirely once or twice – in purgatory, when Cas was working at that awful gas station – but there had never been any consistency to it. But now it had been eight years since Cas raised him from hell. This seemed as good a time as any.
Cas was staring back at him, bewildered. The hand he had on Dean’s waist moved to Dean’s back and held him tighter. “You came to get me.”
They’re still talking. Why are they still talking? Why won’t the Empty put him out of his misery? Why is Dean’s pained and confused face still in front of him? “My punishment.”
Dean wasn’t sure he believed him, but he nodded anyway. Sam seemed sure. “Well, call if you need backup.”
Dean would have done it for free, honestly. Sam was his brother and he loved him. More than enough to take care of his dog for the week.
“Good morning,” Dean said as Cas slid into the seat and pulled the door closed behind him. “Probably a good idea to skip the park this morning.”
“Sometimes.” Castiel checked the images in the display. He looked around. Took a few shots of a bird that was hopping on the ground nearby.
Cas approached Bobby cautiously, not sure how his presence here in Bobby’s heaven would be received. He needn’t have worried. “Good morning, Bobby,” he said politely. It seemed to be morning here, anyway.
was important? That was a stupid question. Of course he remembered. They’d talked about it the year before, and purgatory was hard to forget.
Dean sat quietly for a moment, trying to get his mind back in working order. This future was too bizarre, almost like the when Zachariah had sent him ahead as some kind of sick warning. But that future hadn't come to pass, and neither would this one. He stood and walked out of the room, which wasn't hard considering the door was still broken. He made the right and found the room that had had the "IN USE" sign lit up last time he had gone by. He was sure that was the room Al used to get to Beckett.
“You’re okay,” Dean says, the words coming out more as part of an exhale than as actual words. “I was worried about you. We all were.”
“Coming back,” Dean says, not unkindly. He rubs Cas’ leg, just a little. “I’m not trying to rush you. I just want to know how you are.”
They don’t live in the bunker much longer after that. Dean wants to retire, and Cas has never felt so long overdue for a break. They get a house, and it’s not so far from the bunker that Sam and Eileen can’t come over at least once a week when they aren’t busy helping other hunters. Jack comes with them, more than happy to try out a normal life for a while.
But he’d never touched a soul before, not in this state. The angels weren’t to disturb the souls in heaven, and the souls on earth were living and breathing in their bodies and difficult to access. So as Castiel cradled this soul in his arms, he was overwhelmed by what he heard. It sang, as they all did, but Castiel could feel what made it sing. He felt joy and anger and sadness and envy and giddiness and contentment and
"There's this guy who travels through time and takes over people's bodies, putting right what once went wrong, as his friend put it. He jumped into my body on that hunt, supposedly to stop whatever happened to Sammy, and that landed me here in this forsaken place," Dean explained. "But you could see him, so I guess he hasn't done his job yet."
The woman looked between the two men sitting in her kitchen. "Funny," she said. "I heard your brother was the one who did all the talking."
But those words were always too hard to say out loud. He could have said them in the barn yesterday. He could have taken Sam up on his offer to stop and figured a way to eek out a few minutes alone with Cas. He could have just gone to Cas’ room this morning.
Cas thinks there might be tears in his eyes, but he's too happy to tell. “I love you too, Dean.” And when Dean kisses him, he’s sure Dean’s wrong about how much sugar is in the lemonade, because his mouth is plenty sweet.
"Dean, what are talking about, Sam is-" Cas started when he appeared. But then he stopped, narrowing his eyes as he got a better look at Dean. "You aren't this Dean, are you?"
“He’s just tired,” he said, as much to himself as to Cas. “It’s been a long couple of weeks, you know?”
tells Dean that he doesn’t need to sleep. It seems that in this fantasy, he does. Or at least he feels like he does. “A break would be nice.”
There was one thing Sam had to give Cas, and that was that Cas was far more intuitive than he let on. “Someone didn’t come back.” It wasn’t a question.
Cas blinks several times. He looks to either side of Dean, looking for the puppet master. “I don’t sleep,” he says, almost automatically.
it is enough. But the thing is, I never got the chance.” Dean pauses, but Cas doesn’t dare fill the silence. Dean smiles at him, small and warm and sad and nervous and sure and a million other things. “If the Empty made me say that we’re family, and that I love you, and that I need you, then fine. I won’t say those things. They’re true, but I won’t say them. Not unless you believe it’s me.” Dean moves his hands, catches Cas’ with them. His grip is callused and rough and gentle and reassuring, all at once. “I
"Everything's fine," Sam said, with conviction, he hoped. "I just need a minute." He made his way to the bathroom and locked the door. "Alright Al," he said quietly, "now would be a really good time for you to show up and tell me what I'm supposed to do."
Cas tilts his head to one side and considers. He recognizes hunger pangs in his stomach. He also feels sticky in his clothes and the sensation makes his skin crawl. “Yes,” he says.
Sam Beckett had no idea what year it was, and when he looked down at himself, he never thought he looked any older. Al looked older, but Al didn't usually say what year it was, just popped in to offer his assistance and let Sam know what Ziggy thought of the situation.
want to be safe. Maybe I want out of… all of this.” He gestured around, indicating everything about the bunker. “But what I really want right now, is to know what
There was a hole in her memory, but something about it felt tangible, like lying in bed with her eyes closed and letting her mind wander. Nothing was happening, certainly nothing worth remembering, but it was still
. Maybe take a break for a while. That sounded better. Maybe help other hunters when they needed it. He remembered when Bobby used to do that, used to take calls and pretend to be their superior officer, used to call other hunters he knew in the area and find backup, and he smiled. Maybe there was something to that. Maybe he could try that for a while instead.
Dean stood abruptly and rounded the table. Cas stood as he approached, and Dean wrapped his arms around him, just as tightly as he had before, but more solid this time, less desperate. “I’m not going anywhere, Cas, not anymore.”
"Oh, you know what?" Sam said, feeling his pockets. "Do you have something to write with? I'm afraid I'll forget the way again if I don't write it down."
Sam nodded like this was perfectly reasonable. “Speaking of which,” he asked, “since you were an angel, do you know anything about what Chuck did to everyone, when people were… disappearing?”
“Not today,” Dean said. He reached behind him blindly and grabbed an instrument without thinking, swinging as hard as he could and relishing the feeling of impact. “Why are you here?” he demanded.
On a whim, Dean took Miracle back to the park later that day for her evening walk. Since Cas hadn’t been around the afternoon before, Dean wasn’t really convinced he’d be there today, but he figured he’d never see the guy again if he just never went back to the park.
Sam just smiled at her, set her gently on her feet but didn’t release her. “I’m so happy you’re okay,” he said. And the way she smiled at him, he felt all the tension he’d felt for the last several days just melt away. He knew he should test her somehow, make sure this was really
Dean considered. He felt like he might lose his breakfast, but that was secondary. He was a little sore, but honestly he hadn't really noticed. “Just fine.” He crossed to one of the tables and took a seat. “How about you? What’s your story?”
A glance in the mirror revealed that Sam was in the body of a man in his late twenties or early thirties, sandy blonde hair and green eyes. He was tall too, a bit more than six feet. Sam couldn't quite place why this guy would need a knife as evil looking as the one sheathed in his pocket.
It seems to take a moment for the words to process in Dean’s mind, but he stands eventually and walks out with Cas, just a step behind him.
, when he woke up, that he was home. Over breakfast he had insisted, weakly as always, that Dean didn’t need to help with the flowers if he didn’t want to; Dean had insisted, as always, that he didn’t mind, that he
Once Dean has disappeared around the corner, Cas turns to the bathroom door and pushes it open. Every moment, he expects to step, once again, into darkness. He expects it as he strips his layers off, as he adjusts the water temperature in the shower, as he relieves himself and remembers why he’d thought it was such a nuisance the last time. As he towels off and slips into his borrowed clothing; the t-shirt is faded and just a little narrow in the shoulders, the sweats are comfortably stretched so they’re even a little baggy. Every time he blinks he expects to open his eyes to darkness.
“What if we didn’t hunt anymore?” Dean asked. He didn’t know who he was talking to, but he figured he might as well try the words out. He didn’t like how they tasted. He’d hunted his whole life, and for better or worse, he couldn’t just
“I need you to believe me. We used a spell to open a portal and I went through to get you. I had the ingredients on me. I lit the fuse and you added your grace. Then we both came back through the portal.
Dean shook his head. “I’m sorry. For everything.” He wasn’t sure what he was referring to, but he was sure it had something to do with the Mark, and with Cas going through all he’d gone through.
Dean hoped he was making it up to Sam, but he had a feeling he wasn’t. Last he’d known Cas was off with Hannah doing some angel business or other.
When they were ready to leave, Sam grabbed the keys to the Impala, trying to gauge Dean's reaction. Or lack thereof. Dean didn't react in the slightest to Sam just assuming he could drive.
Dean was about to say something else when the alarm on his phone went off. He groaned and fumbled it out of his pocket.
Sam didn’t look like he bought it, and Dean could feel Cas’ eyes boring into the back of his head, but he elected to ignore them. “We’ll be home soon.”
The barriers came down easily. Some remained, of course; people with no real connection to each other would remain separated, but otherwise the walls between them either became permeable or dissolved entirely, depending on the wants of the soul in question.
They stared at each other for some time before Cas finally looked away, shaking his head almost imperceptibly.
Oddly enough, the kitchen smelled faintly of breakfast. This wasn’t so odd when he found Dean’s note on the counter. He wondered what time Dean had left, and whether he should be worried. A small part of him worried that Dean might do something stupid, but he decided to leave it for now.
Cas nodded. “You said you were going to be walking Miracle through here. And you asked if I would be around. So I figured I could make another trip out.”
They continued their wandering until they finally found Cas, and despite himself, Dean couldn’t keep the relief off his face. He insisted Cas come with them. He promised to get everyone out. He didn’t know if he could actually follow through with that, but he did know that he’d die trying if he couldn’t.
Cas looks around the rest of the room. There’s Sam at a table, the ingredients to a spell laid out in front of him, looking exhausted but pleased. Eileen is asleep in a chair in a position that can’t possibly be comfortable. There are footsteps coming down the hall, and they sound like Jack’s.
try. What was the worst that could happen? It couldn’t be much worse than everything else he’d gone through in the last… decade? More? Anyway, he was fairly certain that if anyone could get away with disrespecting the delicate balance of life and death some more, it would be him and Dean. He resolved to ask for Dean’s help the next day.
And when Dean returns with two glasses of lemonade and hands one to Cas, the look is there too. Dean sits in the dirt and takes a sip, and Cas watches him, and something clicks into place.
Sam shrugs. “Maybe.” He considers. “Probably.” That smirk changes to something more playful, more conspiratorial. “But it hasn’t disappeared yet.”
“Please.” Cas might say the word out loud, or he might just make the attempt. Either way, he thinks Dean understands.
“I don’t have any other clothes,” Cas says. The last time he had changed clothes, they’d been borrowed anyway. A full wardrobe hadn’t been high on his priority list when he could just use his powers to tidy his appearance.
Cas just nods. He manages a tentative smile in return, and now Dean is grinning back at him in earnest. Cas reaches forward with his free hand, but he sees Dean’s gaze shift for just a moment. He turns to see what’s behind him, and, finding nothing, he turns back, only to find empty space once more.
Whenever Sam made a leap into another person's existence, that person was sent to a waiting room of sorts. This room was in the present, wherever that was. The person would stay in the waiting room for however long it took Sam to fix whatever had gone wrong in their time. Often they were just as confused as the people working the Project, since Sam looked, to an observer, like the person he had leaped into, while the displaced person in the waiting room looked like Sam.
Cas blinks. He stares at the hand. At Dean offering his hand. Belatedly, he reaches out to take it. He watches Dean’s thumb trace a circle across the back of it. Dean’s hand is calloused and rough, but the touch is gentle. “Home.”
"Is everything okay? Like, are you two...good? You seemed okay last night when I headed out to the bar," the other man said, his voice worried.
"I don't know that I can do this though," Beckett said. "This is way out of the realm of anything I've done."
Cas was quiet, scanning the list. So many names were missing, but there, near the top, his own name. Heading the list was a new symbol - Cas had never seen it before, but he knew instinctively that this was Jack’s name on the list.
One night, not long after they’d found him, Cas asked to speak with Dean in private. Benny gave them a weird look, but wandered a little ways into the woods, saying he’d be back in a little bit with more firewood.
“I apologize for that,” Cas said. “But it was significantly worse than just a handprint when I put your soul back.”
Cas shrugged. “I had already carried you from the depths of hell,” he said simply. “Besides, it was easier for the garrison to get away unnoticed if you weren’t ‘topside.’ We didn’t have vessels then, and if you had seen us, we’d have had to bring you back again.”
The pictures of the stars were the biggest difference. The originals had been dark, but with a sort of blue tint. The stars had been small, visible but not brilliant. In the edited pictures, it was almost like the atmosphere wasn’t there at all, like the stars had come out just for Cas and his camera.
When the descent finally halted, Dean felt himself thrown forcibly against a rack, his injuries flaring painfully. Somehow he was in a body that must still be his, and he could see light reflected from him. No, not reflected. He had to be the source of the light, because no other source was anywhere near him.
"You have got to be kidding me," Dean said, sitting down and rubbing his forehead. "I have had enough time travel for one lifetime, thanks."
“Me too, Cas,” Dean said. Home. With Cas. Dean’s grin widened. He held tight to Cas’ lapels, refusing to consider the possibility that the spell had worn off.
When he comes to, it’s to a dark expanse of nothing. He sits up, but there isn’t the soft give of a mattress, no hum of old electricity in the light fixtures that should be in the hall. Instead, there’s hard ground and absolutely nothing to see.
"That's my understanding, yes," Al said. "You'll have to forgive me, this whole thing doesn't make sense."
Castiel broke through the ceiling of the room, and there was chaos. Dean felt a scorching heat against his back from Castiel’s body as the thing fought off demons and hellhounds, sometimes with a blade and sometimes just using its wings as shields, and he felt Castiel’s hand searing his shoulder. He tried to fight out of the grip, but with nothing to get leverage on, Dean couldn’t free himself.
So maybe taking a risk was worth it. Dean would just have to play it a little differently. “Can I… keep… flirting with you?”
“Any time, Cas,” Dean says, and he sounds like he means it. He briefly tightens his grip around Cas’ shoulders.
Dr. Samuel Beckett had been leaping for quite some time. He never really knew how much time was passing on a regular timeline, since he was always jumping from year to year, and sometimes he would stay there for a few days, while other times he would stay in the other person's body for weeks. However, he never leaped to a time that was outside his own lifetime, so generally any leap to a time prior to 1953 was impossible. He could remember one or two exceptions, but he'd been doing this so long he couldn't be sure.
“I have to be into the office early,” Sam had explained when Dean had complained about the early hour. “And it’s only for a week.”
"Hopefully it isn't all human," Sam said as he closed the door. He was about to pull out his gun when he heard footsteps approaching the kitchen and he quickly retook his seat.
"So sometime between then and when I got back at around eight, something happened to him," Sam said.
When Dean got back down to the basement, he found Sam and Beckett sitting in their chairs, rubbing their wrists where the ropes had been tied. Standing beside them was Al, who looked pissed off.
Bobby grinned when he looked up and saw his visitor. “Well I’ll be damned,” he said. “How are you, Cas?”
Sam ran his hand over his neck, where the wolf's jaw had been. The skin was smooth. A grin spread across his face. "I'm fine," he said with relief.
Cas is panting now, less from a need to fill his lungs and more from panic. His mind turns itself over, searching for possibilities. Dean wouldn’t leave him. Not Dean who was so sure he’d lost his grip when Cas had shoved him out of purgatory, who trusted Cas even when Cas didn’t think he deserved it.
Jack barrels into him and Cas is so relieved at being able to hold his son again that he even briefly forgets how this routine is supposed to go. He wants to say something, to let Jack know he’s sorry for what happened, to get the words out even to this illusion before the darkness swallows him up again. He can’t form the words, but Jack isn’t saying anything either, so that must be okay.
“I always come back to you,” Cas managed. He returned the hug tentatively, and his embrace only made Dean’s arms tighten further around him.
“After the cage,” Cas starts, “when you weren’t sure what was real.” He pauses and takes a deep breath. He focuses on the warmth of the mug between his hands. “How long did it take until you knew you were back?”
Jack straightened. He studied Cas. His face was inexpressive, but it was clear the wheels in his mind were turning. “I want heaven to be like that,” he finally said.
Dean looked toward the horizon. The pinks were really starting to come through now, the pastel shades making the park look soft and almost blurry. “You like to watch it?”
They sat looking at the pictures all through breakfast. Dean liked the raw files just fine, if he was being honest. They were certainly better than his phone pictures. And if he had questions about them, Cas was more than willing to answer.
“I couldn’t leave you there,” Cas said. “Even when Alastair put you in that room and the fighting got worse. I had to make sure you were safe.”
dead. Though, truth be told, he can’t quite remember what that was supposed to feel like anyway. With nothing in particular to focus on, time simply passes, and Cas doesn’t register the length. The only difference is that his entire internal clock has stopped ticking; even if he wanted to know how long he’d been there, he couldn’t hazard a guess.
Something was definitely different about the emptiness around him now. Dean had thought it might just be the silence getting to him, but he was sure. There was something, just out of sight. Just out of reach.
Castiel was not built to feel such things. Each new feeling was overwhelming, and yet Castiel couldn’t bring himself to let go, even as he rebuilt the righteous man’s body around his soul. Castiel couldn’t help himself, and even as he tried to focus on what he needed to do, on completing his mission and returning to heaven, he found he held on too long as he finished his work, and his hand burned the righteous man’s arm, leaving a hand print that Castiel didn’t have time to fix, for the righteous man was waking up, and Castiel didn’t have a vessel.
It takes a moment for Cas to make up his mind. He holds on to Dean’s voice telling him he’s home, but he can’t shake the goosebumps on his back that tell him that as soon as he drops his hands, he’ll be right back where he started.
But now Cas was gone, probably for good. Cas had already died on him twice, but he’d kept coming back. He was a constant, along with Sam. Dean had known he could count on them to be there. Thankfully Sam was still alive and kicking, and for now he had a handle on how to control his Lucifer hallucinations.
Cas isn’t surprised to see the look. He commits it to memory anyway. He holds on to it when Dean wraps him in another hug and he buries his face against Dean’s shoulder. He tries to hide in that space for a while, to avoid the inevitable conclusion, but Dean pulls back, steps back, and he has to open his eyes again-
“I might have to take you up on that,” Jack replied, his voice muffled slightly from Cas’ suit jacket. After a moment, he pulled back and shook himself back to the task at hand. “Follow me.”
Cas’ brain short circuits, and this can’t be real. It can’t be. There’s no way this is happening. He remembers all the times this has been fake, all the Deans that have disappeared in front of him. He needs to make it last as long as possible. “Dean.”
Cas smiled, but didn’t say anything at first. Moving up in the world. That was certainly one way to put it. “I should go.”
The picture on the screen was in a forest, aimed up at the sky over the trees. It was the dead of night in the picture, and the colors were dark but visible enough to know that this picture wasn’t in black and white. The sky above the trees was clear, and in the black canopy were thousands if tiny pinpricks of light – more than Dean could remember seeing in real life, save for a camping trip his dad had taken him on when he was a kid.
"If they're awake, they don't change," Sam said. "Not in our experience anyway. Unless they're angry."
different they looked. And it wasn’t like the originals were bad – these were just more vibrant, more alive. The pastels of early morning looked softer, the details of the world a little more defined but still with that glowing ease of not being quite awake.
that she was back. That this wasn’t a dream. Whatever had happened to her was over, and Sam was here, and she knew he was saying something because his words were rumbling through her chest.
"What, you think I'm gonna sit on my ass and twiddle my thumbs while you get my brother killed? No thanks dude."
They talked for a while after that. Jack gave them as many details of his work as he was comfortable sharing. They joked and made references he remembered but didn’t understand the weight of, but he didn’t mind. They were living their lives, and that was all he wanted.
"Why don't you have a seat?" the woman offered when they entered the kitchen. "I'll go write the directions for you."
Cas just keeps watching Dean. He looks away briefly when he needs another bite of his food, but for the most part, his eyes stay trained on Dean’s face. “What happened?”
“You saved me four years ago,” Dean said. He noticed the small smile on Cas’ face, even if Cas hadn’t meant for him to see it. “You know, give or take. I don’t exactly have a calendar out here.”
But Dean steps through with a smiling, “Good morning.” He taps on the table in front of Eileen and waves when she looks up at him. “Any exciting plans for today?” he asks and signs.
When the little flame reaches the bundle, it grows brighter. Cas exhales. He lets his grace flow down his fingers. The flame changes, sparking so hot as to be almost white. The thin line of a portal appears in the darkness, the dim orange light almost too bright to look at after so much nothingness. Cas lets himself be tugged through the opening. He grabs Dean’s arm in spite of himself.
They asked how his work was going, and Jack kept it as short as possible. It had been a few months since he’d taken over, but he didn’t want to get his family involved anymore. They’d earned that much.
But now there were more growls and snarls, and the shelves were being thrown aside so roughly that Sam had to back away to avoid being hit by debris. There were six wolves left; both of the children were already dead. Three leaped at Sam while the other three went for Beckett.
Cas smiles, because he can’t help himself. And at the way Dean lights up in return, his smile only grows. And he laughs. And he isn’t sure if it’s because he’s happy or if it’s because he’s terrified, but he laughs until Dean’s laughing too and they’re out of breath and all Cas can do is giggle into the quiet room.
"Of course. I need to be able to communicate with Doctor Beckett from here, and I can't do that without a transmitter."
Dean counted to ten to make sure he’d be able to get his words out correctly. “Cas. How do you do that?”
“And the first thing on the agenda after that was to get you back.” Dean’s face is so open now. Cas can’t remember ever seeing it look like that. “I couldn’t let you leave without telling you I love you too.”
The fridge was filled with Tupperware containers, all containing raw meat. Beckett thought he was going to be sick. "What exactly is that?"
Dean’s smile shrinks, but doesn’t vanish. There’s something quietly fond in his eyes as he reaches up and touches Cas’ shoulder, feather-light. “You didn’t have to wait up for me.”
"That's how it goes," Beckett said. "Al will be back to get you, since you need Ziggy to open the door."
Dean didn’t know much about photography, but the camera looked fancy. Expensive. And so did the lens that Castiel twisted onto it. “For fun?”
There’s a light so bright as to override his vision entirely, and when the afterimage has vanished, it’s still just as dark as before.
Dean looked shocked, but it was Sam who said, "Cas, I don't know what you're talking about. He looks like Dean."
Dean patted Miracle and looked back to the water. He wasn’t good at analyzing dreams, but the reasoning for this one seemed fairly straightforward. He’d nearly died, and Cas had come back to life in probably the most dramatic way possible, and so he supposed it made sense for his mind to fixate on
Eileen smiled. She’d been so worried that Sam would want out of the life. She knew he’d tried before and she said as much.
“Anything.” Dean leaned forward in his seat slightly, and knew it was true - he’d promise anything to Cas. He’d do it all over if it meant he could end up here again.
Cas isn’t sure how he’s feeling. Mostly he feels like his insides were ripped out, rearranged, and stuck back in haphazardly. “I don’t…”
Cas thinks to answer, but decides against it. Dean will find him, because the Empty says that Dean will find him. For now, there isn’t even a Dean to look at. A shadow, recognizable only because its silhouette is a different kind of dark than its surroundings, moves a little way to Cas’ right.
“The usual.” Dean offers a hand and hoists Cas up when he takes it. “That’s what happens when you come to save your best friend.”
Cas’ confusion melted into a small smile. He stepped aside. “You can bring it in if you want,” he said.
The mission was uncomplicated. Castiel and his garrison were to infiltrate hell, locate the righteous man, and return him to earth. They knew where the weak points were. They knew how to fight demons. And once the righteous man was delivered from hell, they knew that the next mission would be averting the apocalypse.
Dean saved the picture with no hesitation. He moved the silhouette picture to his home screen and changed his lock screen to this one, so he’d see it every time his phone lit up.
He thought it was odd that Cas hadn’t said anything, and when he looked up, he found Cas looking at him with a small fond smile. “Don’t move,” Dean said. To his credit, Cas didn’t budge as Dean brought the camera back up, adjusted the zoom, and pressed the shutter. He inspected the photo before looking up at Cas.
“Yeah, you said this is where angels and demons go to sleep for eternity or some shit,” Dean says. His creased brow smooths and one side of his mouth turns up. “Not that I’m complaining. You’re a lot easier to find when you’re awake.”
“Fancy name,” Dean said, swinging again. He didn’t make as much headway that time, and grabbed a new instrument.
“You saying you think I’m pretty?” Dean asked. He stepped forward, and okay, he had to admit it was a nice picture. It made his eyes look very green, and did he really have that many freckles? He’d never really noticed in the mirror.
“I like being up high,” Cas replied. He scrolled back through the pictures as he stepped up to Dean, briefly leaning down to scratch Miracle’s ears. He held the camera out to Dean without removing the strap from around his neck, so when Dean took it, he took the liberty of pulling Cas a little closer under the guise of getting a better look at the pictures.
Sure, they still had a lot to overcome. All four of them still had nightmares. Sometimes they would get a faraway look in their eyes and one of the others would come and provide whatever comfort they needed. It would be a long time before they were able to recover from everything that had happened to them, but they had each other, and they were trying.
She couldn’t think of anything that would just make her vanish from existence. Even as she felt her mind sharpen up with food in her belly, she couldn’t come up with a reasonable explanation. She thought harder, carefully going over what she remembered from before everything went dark to what she could think of now.
“I was,” Cas starts, then pauses. Sam and Dean are watching him. Those footsteps keep drawing nearer. “I was dead.”
The tumblers turned over in the lock and the door opened. It was Al, a tray of food and water in his hand.
Cas didn’t know. He feels it though, that speaking will break the illusion. He thinks that he’d rather it end now, than drag on further. “Will you stay?”
He could see the faces of the hellhounds, and if he’d thought they were terrifying on the mortal plane, then they were infinitely worse here; they were the size of horses, their thick bodies made of nothing but solid muscle, their teeth long and sharp and bared and sparkling in the white-blue light, each with several pairs of red eyes that watched him as the hounds circled his rack, their ears flattened back threateningly.
Further down the hall there was a humming sound. Curious, Dean made his way toward the sound. It was coming from a room at the end of the hall on the left, and when Dean peered through the door, he saw the biggest computer he had seen in his life. It looked like something out of the fifties and took up the entire room, with a keyboard and monitor in the center, just a few feet in the door. After taking a cautious look around, Dean stepped inside and pressed the enter key, just to see what would happen.
When Cas opens his eyes, he stumbles back into darkness. He looks around, but he’s still alone. He turns one way and then the other, but the feeling of being watched doesn’t let up for lack of audience. He might as well have a spotlight on him with how on display he feels. “Please.” He nearly chokes on the word. “Please stop.”
The other werewolves had either been hiding in the wings or had done an excellent job of sneaking up on the three of them in the kitchen. But Sam was very hard to sneak up on at this point, so it was much more likely that they'd been waiting from the time the Impala had parked in front of the house. They were suddenly on the two men in the chairs, holding them down and tying them.
"Yeah, sure," the officer said, opening the door for them. "If it is a serial killer though, he's a weird son of a bitch."
Meanwhile, back at Project Quantum Leap, Dean was pacing the waiting room. He couldn't stop moving. Something bad was going to happen. That Al guy had said so. Except this Doctor guy was supposed to stop it. But if he was supposed to stop bad things that had happened before, how was he supposed to stop it? If Dean hadn't been able to stop it, how was some guy without any experience doing this supposed to stop it?
Beckett nodded. "I take over a person in a certain time period, to change things that went wrong before. When whatever it is is put right, I leap out and go to someone else."
It could have been hours, but was probably only minutes, later when Sam’s voice approached the barn again. Dean quickly released his grip on Cas, rubbing the tears from his face as he did so.
“Can I ask you a… personal… question?” Cas asks, making sure Eileen can see him ask. She politely pulls out her phone and starts scrolling.
Cas checks in with his body, but all it does is yawn again. He shakes his head. He keeps his eyes forward.
"I'm glad you're okay kid," Al said to Sam. Sam nodded his thanks and Al took Dean's arm, leading him through a door back to Project Quantum Leap.
The picture on the display was clearly from earlier that afternoon. There were close-ups of flowers near the entrance to the park, one with a bee hovering over it, pollen stuck in the fuzz on its legs. There was a picture of a bird in its nest in one of the trees on the walk to the lake.
Beckett furrowed his brow, studying Cas. Before he could make any kind of comment, Al stepped in. "Are we all acquainted now?" he asked.
They sit like that for a time, on the floor in the bunker’s kitchen. Cas remembers how to breathe, and he inhales and exhales to the rhythm of Dean’s hands slowly rubbing up and down his back. They don’t say anything until finally,
That was a fair question. How did he know someone wasn’t just using her phone? He started to type out a response, but then hesitated. “It could be her.” Another message came in, asking if he was there. She must have seen his typing indicator appear and disappear again.
Meanwhile, back at the headquarters of Project Quantum Leap, Dean Winchester came to in the waiting room.
“I don’t know, half an hour at a time? The time I saw him in the afternoon was a little longer. Probably more than an hour. Yesterday he was probably here for two hours. Why?”
“Sam doesn’t like it when I call him my little brother,” Dean said. “Gets all huffy about it. I think it’s partly an act, but when your younger brother is taller than you, you have to call him your little brother. Just to keep him in his place.” He stood as Cas zipped his laptop case closed. “Do you want a ride?”
Cas chokes on a sob. He looks down at where their hands are still joined, and he tries in vain to use that point of contact to heal Dean’s injuries. Nothing happens. There’s no rush of grace, no feeling of repair in Dean’s body. He swallows thickly. “I can’t.”
He still regretted the whole demon business. He’d managed in hell without totally becoming a demon (though he wasn’t about to go claiming that it was because of his own willpower), but
couldn't stop it, then your guy doesn't have a prayer. And he needs to find a way to get out of my body. If anyone's going to be there with Sammy when this happens, it's going to be me."
Tentatively, Dean stepped out, expecting some kind of alarm. When none came, he turned right and started walking. There seemed to be more activity this way. Which is to say that slightly more than nothing was happening. There was a room just a few doors down from the waiting room that had a lit sign above it that read, "IN USE." Dean pressed his ear to the door, but heard nothing on the other side, which he found weird. Though not weirder than anything else that had gone on, he supposed.
Cas was taken aback, but he stopped himself from denying it outright. Did he want to stay? He didn’t know. He’d planned on dying in the empty, dying
But… then what? What was supposed to come after? Sam had a full-on roadblock in his mind when he tried to think of what he was supposed to do now. Doing nothing didn’t feel right, even though he’d left the life before.
anymore, but Sam’s goals hadn’t changed too much - he wanted to have family and friends he loved, and he wanted to be able to take a vacation and go to the movies and have his morning jog. He’d just gotten a little more okay with haunted objects still turning up occasionally.
Dean jumps away from the wall, looking ready for a fight. When he recognizes Cas, his posture loosens. “You’re awake,” he says. He glances at Sam’s door, seems to weigh his options. He visibly comes to a conclusion and steps toward Cas. “I know it’s late, but are you hungry? Need anything?”
“It’s…” Sam didn’t think he could finish. Mostly because he was sure he was seeing things. “It’s Eileen?”
"There's something that's been bothering me about it. The house, not the scarecrow. The paint was peeling on the house, and I thought that was normal, but I've been thinking that it looked like there were claw marks on the house."
Alastair was quiet a moment. He stepped over to Dean, leaning close so he could better inspect Dean’s features. Dean turned his face away, but kept his eyes trained on Alastair’s face.
Dean hadn’t been properly prepared to hear Cas’ voice so close to his ear, but he managed not to shiver. “They’re at home then?”
Al furrowed his brow, confused, but he continued, "Our funding was being threatened, so my friend stepping into the Accelerator before we were sure it would work. He's been taking little leaps through history since then. Currently, he's leaped to you."
"But...? The world goes on? Just like that?" Becket asked, having trouble wrapping his mind around it.
Cas laughed again. Hadn’t he said as much to Bobby? “Okay,” he said, wiping his face. He took a breath to steady himself. “No, I don’t want to be an angel anymore.” And what a relief, to say that out loud.
At some point, Cas realizes the surface he’s laying on isn’t hard and immovable – there’s some give. He’s sunk an inch or two. The silence around him isn’t the dead silence he’d been listening to, and is instead the sort of living silence that comes from humming electricity, people down the hall, an old structure settling and creaking.
Whether it was strength or beginner’s luck, Dean didn’t know. He didn’t care either, because he had this
Jack smiled at him. “If I need help, I’ll know where to find you,” he said. “I don’t have a reason to think you wouldn’t help me.”
pulling on him as they walked out, even when Dean slowed to look at the names carved into the desk in the main room.
Dean’s brow is furrowed in concern, but it eases when Cas meets his gaze. He turns, his hand dropping down Cas’ arm to fasten around the wrist.
Dean watched Cas out of the corner of his eye for a moment before he handed the camera back. “I don’t mind.”
Sam still looked mystified. “And I don’t talk to him that long,” he continued. “Maybe five or ten minutes at a time.”
And Jack also knew that, even though this was his first visit home since everything had happened, he would be back to see them again. It wasn’t something he could help; they had raised him and loved him. And he loved them.
Dean laughed. He couldn’t help himself. With all the nerves and the kiss and, yeah - having was a helluva lot better.
He reaches for that feeling of happiness that summoned the Empty. It’s there, even now, but Cas is sure it’s been just about flayed open. He doesn’t trust it. He knows he felt it, but he isn’t sure anymore just how good it felt.
“Can’t really complain,” Dean said with a lopsided smile. He pulled his phone out and opened to his pictures. He had only taken two pictures since the silhouette (one was a picture of Miracle at the park early in the morning, so Dean could prove to Sammy that he had, in fact, stuck to the dog’s schedule, and the other was of Miracle on his couch, which he had officially taken to send to Sam to complain about the dog’s manners, but which he had really taken because she
Dean finally looked away from the screen and out toward the horizon. “Did you get any good ones this morning?”
“Let’s go.” Without thinking about it, he put a hand on Cas’ shoulder to guide him to the barn doors.
The door stood open and when Dean stepped in and closed it behind him, he saw a flash of bright white light and then he was standing in a basement. Or he assumed it was a basement from the total lack of windows and the staircase that led up.
Then there was the lack of excitement over the pie. Dean would have snatched it at the first opportunity, but this morning he had politely taken a slice, even looking mildly confused as to why eating pie with breakfast was an okay thing to do.
Miracle didn’t answer. Her head was tilted slightly and her eyes were closed, clearly enjoying having Dean scratch her.
"Hey now, my friend Sam is there. He'll set it right. He always does," Al said, trying to comfort Dean.
Cas seemed like he wanted to say more, but he didn't say anything before he vanished in a flutter of wings.
“I don’t know.” He really didn’t. The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea of a happy medium - a sort of work-life balance he hadn’t ever thought would work. But maybe he could make it work. He could find the line between working cases and having time to just
Dean did chuckle at that. He climbed around Cas to stretch out on the bed, and held an arm out for Cas. Cas didn’t hesitate to shed his shoes and his coat and lie next to Dean.
to go toward the light; Dean was headed toward darkness, and the light was with his body, and his brother. Maybe something better was above that, but he never even got a glimpse.
They stayed like that, kissing and holding each other, for a long time, until Dean finally pulled back, resting his forehead against Cas’. “I want this,” he said, so softly he almost couldn’t hear himself.
He and Beckett began to make their way to the door, but Cas was standing in the middle of the room, staring off into space.
“I don’t want you to leave again.” Cas almost chokes on the words, but he manages to swallow down the emotion.
“Made it,” Dean said quietly. He knew he should wake them, let them know everything had worked. But he couldn’t help wanting to put it off another few minutes.
Cas shook his head again. He looked like there was something else he wanted to say, but he held his tongue.
“You’re bringing your computer?” Dean asked. He had to turn the wipers up when he pulled out onto the main road.
“Probably not,” Dean said, trying to keep the fear out of his voice. His old bravado was nowhere to be found. “If you ask him at least.”
"I'd better go make sure he gets back to that waiting room," Al said, stepping through his door to his own time.
“Okay, I’m up,” Dean muttered. He rubbed Miracle’s head when the dog’s tail wagged at the sound of his voice.
Dean knew he was right, but he didn’t want to risk Cas running off before Benny got back. “Only if you stay here,” he said.
"That's more important than the Apocalypse?" Beckett was a little confused by this. "This Dean guy is that special?"
"I have your directions," the woman said as she returned, smiling sweetly. She held a folded piece of paper out to Sam.
There was a terrifying moment of stillness, where Cas might have disappeared entirely, and then he felt solid again. Dean felt Cas’ hands move to his neck and his waist, felt Cas’ mouth move against his. He took his now-free hand and wound it through Cas’ hair. He thought he could live in this moment forever and not think about where he was or what was going on around them or what was about to happen to Cas.
It was over in a second. Cas hadn’t even broken a sweat. But now he was faced with Sam and Dean, who were both staring at him. He looked between the two of them, suddenly unsure where he should focus his attention; they both looked a little banged up, but neither seemed to notice at the moment.
“Awesome,” Dean says, his face lit with joy. He stands and holds out a hand, ready to help if Cas isn’t as steady as he says he is. “We just finished breakfast. Everyone else is out on a supply run, but I wanted to see if you wanted some pancakes.”
Dean laughs. A relieved and delighted sound. The tension drains from around his eyes. “Good to see you buddy.”
“Well come on, Sammy’s hosting in the other room,” Dean said. He had a hand between Jack’s shoulder blades and guided him down the hall, Cas close behind.
Sam didn’t look like he bought it, but he let it drop for the time being. “Happy birthday,” he said instead.
taken that picture the other day of Cas’ silhouette against the sunrise. “You can keep it,” he said, “as long as it’s a good picture.”
“Well look who it is,” Dean said. He was grinning, and Jack noticed that he looked lighter, somehow. Like a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. “Nice of you to stop by.”
It’s been five years since Cas raised Dean from hell, and Dean was really getting tired of all the bullshit that was going on. At least for the first two anniversaries, Cas was still an angel. Then he was dead (or not, Dean’s still not sure when exactly Cas was brought back). Then they were in purgatory. Now Cas wasn’t an angel. Sam and Dean had found him only a day or so after the fall, but Gadreel had given Dean a choice between saving Sam and keeping Cas around. And honestly, as long as Cas was safe, Dean needed to make sure Sam was totally healed before he let Gadreel leave.
“I had to, Cas. Whatever was going to come next. It wasn’t going to be the same without you,” Dean said. He tentatively reached out, as Cas had just a moment before, and rested his hands over Cas’. He felt sturdier when Cas took his hands and squeezed them reassuringly. “I can’t do it without you. Every time you’ve been gone before, it was the same. I would get stuck. Without you, it was always… just, empty.” Maybe this was how Cas had done it. Maybe it was just a matter of momentum. “And now, we get to write our own ending, right? That’s what all this was about. This whole thing, from the very beginning. And since, I don’t know… For a long time, I knew that whatever future I was running towards, it wasn’t going to be enough - it wouldn’t be what I
"Wha-No. Must have been a trick of the light," Beckett said as Al said his good luck before stepping through his door and back to his own time.
“And if she just… vanished. Then she isn’t in heaven or hell or anywhere else. And I can’t get her back.” Sam was surprised to find how easily the words came out, despite the fact he felt like he might choke on them.
There was a click as one of the werewolves locked the door at the top of the stairs. "See you in a while boys," he said as he joined the others in a section of the basement that was partially hidden from view by shelves laden with various odds and ends.
The drive to Cas’ apartment was simple, and it was easy enough to retrace his route from the other day. Cas was waiting in the doorway to his building when Dean pulled up. Dean reached over to unlock the door as Cas jogged over, a hoodie pulled tight in front of him.
