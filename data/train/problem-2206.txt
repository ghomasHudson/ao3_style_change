"No," he murmured. "I have plans."
Sherlock paced the flat again, mind and nerves flaring, until the impatience was like an itch crawling over his skin. With a growled curse, he stalked into the living room and liberated his violin from its case.
fine, he told himself again, somehow managing a shaky, baffled laugh because it so clearly wasn’t and if Sherlock were there, he’d point out how ridiculous conclusion was, based entirely on false premises, and Sherlock
"You said it yourself yesterday, it's one thing when I don't need the sleep."
Satisfied that he was appropriately masked, John set to work.
They ambled through the park in the sunshine and cool air. The breeze swirled leaves around them, scattering a flurry of yellow across the path and the drying grass. It was chilly but not unpleasantly so and the park was well populated. Sam wondered at his actions again – he hadn't been out on his own since the flashback at all, especially not so far from home, especially not surrounded by this many strangers.
John was obviously Sherlock's single most prized possession.
"You kept glancing towards the cool storage without trying to be obvious about it," Sherlock said, redirecting his comments to Molly. "You were clearly agitated by my presence there, and not simply because you were unhappy that I'd come down on my own, despite your protests otherwise. You didn't want me to be there because there's something you don't want me to see." He turned to John, grey eyes icy. "I've been here a week, Molly's been up to visit several times. If she's spoken to me, she's spoken to you about me. Whatever she's trying to keep from me, you're well aware of it, and you don't want me to know."
"No, you said he'd get bored and murder someone! I don't see any bloody bodies here, do you? What I see is a sodding stupid git who calls himself a genius and who can't help but get himself into trouble at every bloody opportunity!"
"This is Bridget's number," Sherlock said, pulling John to his feet and crossing the office in one long stride to yank the door open. The security guards Mycroft had insisted upon look startled, but Sherlock brushed right past them, John in his wake, leaving them scrambling to catch up.
"What now?" Sherlock hissed.
John nodded.
"There was one thing... It can't have been too long after he started coming here, so I don't know, late September? We used to have this painting on the wall, it was for sale. Right over there. Someone bought it a couple of weeks ago." She pointed behind him and John twisted, unable to make out any discolouration on the walls that would indicate where a painting had been.
"This is
"Sit. Stay still."
"Yeah, tell me what it means, Sherlock," Lestrade ordered.
His mind back under his control, Sherlock tested his hands, the sharp pull of adhesive against the fine hairs of his arm smarting. Hands bound behind his back made it impossible to remove the tape from his mouth, and his tongue and lips tasted of glue. He might be able to moisten it enough with saliva to get it to dissolve, but there was no point.
"If you wish to offer my brother's services to Lestrade, feel free," Sherlock sniffed. "I am not being dragged into that. Any contact with Mycroft before Christmas always results in him insisting we celebrate the holidays together."
"John."
They lay down together, Sherlock removing the sling and adjusting the pillows as the doctor's eyes drifted shut, expression sated and blissful. Sherlock waited until John was asleep before pressing a light kiss between his partner's eyebrows, where the two deep lines he often wore were erased by sleep.
"It's all right," John said and Doe sucked in a deep breath, then let it out slowly before giving a faint nod. John poured him some water and the injured man accepted it with a look of thanks. John gave him a few minutes to refocus, to get used to the idea that he had a known name, that there were people out there who recognized him.
"That's true."
He eased up, feeling the shudder that ran through Sherlock's body in response, and let his fingers drop back down, passing teasingly over Sherlock's balls. A deeper shudder made John smile, and he kissed Sherlock again, using the touch to keep his partner quiet as he tickled and scratched his nails lightly over the fabric of Sherlock's trousers.
"Not yet," Sherlock growled.
"Does it really?" Sherlock was suddenly in his space, close enough that John could feel the heat radiating from him, and the way he dipped his voice chipped at John's resolve.
Moriarty would never really be gone. His body had tumbled into the water and then been pulled out. He had been cremated at the expense of the taxpayers, without fuss, without ceremony. Sam knew it would never leave him. Not completely. And it would be bad again – just hopefully not as bad as it had just been. He thought perhaps he'd passed through the worst of it and that gave him hope. He knew how he felt now wouldn't last, not entirely, not so soon. But he felt like himself for the first time in two weeks. He felt like he could see a way out and hoped he'd remember it when things felt dark again.
"I don't want to go through it," Sherlock said before he could stop himself.
"He's been expecting us for five months," Sherlock murmured, waving a hand vaguely.
Even when he heard Sherlock's hurried tread on the stairs and the sound of the door being pushed all the way open.
, when he began to cry.
, Sherlock thought with an inward scowl but John asked he could check the old injury anyway. Sherlock closed his eyes, refusing to be put off. He heard John pulling back the blankets and shot his eyes open, sitting up and refocusing quickly. He was not about to let John undress a strange man in his bed without supervision.
Aaron was a perfect reason for Charles and Dominique to stay even longer; no one could argue with their genuine desire to spend time with their son, and it was useful to have Charles to bounce ideas off of regarding Jennifer and Jim.
"Yes. Because you don't call your mum Sibyl. You call her Mum."
He was still sitting there, staring at the tree, when Sherlock whirled in through the door, coming in halfway through a sentence that trailed and billowed behind him with his coat, flitting into the kitchen and out again, into the bedroom and out again, lights turning on around him, his voice a steady stream of chatter. He kept talking, spinning off in new directions as his mind switched from high speed track to high speed track, asking questions that he answered himself half a breath later, nattering about details that sailed right past, over and around John.
He couldn't even remember what had been so funny, but he could remember they'd ended up leaning against each other, gasping against the laughter, trying to reassert some semblance of dignity, but failing each time.
"Yes," Alexandre said. "I'm sorry."
"I thought you were my uncle?" she asked. "You aren't related to Daddy, and Uncle Lock isn't related to Mummy or Daddy, but I thought you and Mummy were brother and sister. You were in the army together and you're both doctors and you're always together and you love each other but not the way you love Uncle Lock or Mummy loves Daddy."
"You could get treatment," Sherlock pointed out. John only nodded; that was true, he could.
John headed back upstairs and ordered the food before hanging the mistletoe where he wanted it. He thought he'd get another sprig for above the door to their flat – and maybe the bathroom door as well. He grinned at the idea of not being able to pass through any door without claiming a kiss. Not that he couldn't anyway – Sherlock was happy to oblige.
"Sherlock thinks he had a flashback to Waterloo Bridge." The words were delivered in a rush and Veronique didn't miss the tremor in Sandra's voice.
"Because he looked around for you, then gave me a good Sherlock scowl when he realized you weren't here. Then went back to sleep – pretty deliberately, I think."
"Uh – yeah. She asked if I could remember going anywhere else, other shops, galleries, that sort of thing. Why?"
"It's not very festive," John pointed out.
He shook his head, pursing his lips.
"I'd say it works just fine," John replied. He saw Sherlock attempt a scornful expression but the light in his eyes gave him away.
He pushed himself to his feet and cleared some space on the mantle for the small frame, dusting it off quickly on his shirt first, then dislodging some of Sherlock's junk to make room for it.
The detective raised his head, glancing over his shoulder with a mild scowl.
It didn't feel untrue.
"Not unusual for you," John commented, arms crossing in that infuriating and endearing way that meant he knew something Sherlock didn't want him to know.
The young woman shrugged, then shook her head.
"Thought you could have expertly undone it."
In the seven days they'd been in Frontignan, Sherlock had put back another pound and a half, bringing his total to three. John liked to track the progress by the fit of Sherlock's wedding band. It was still loose but less so now and he was in no real danger of losing it, although he took it off if he went into the water. In bed – or on the divan or in the cabana or in the shower or anywhere else – John liked to chart the progress by how easily his hand fit around the detective's waist. Sherlock would always be thin but John had grown used to him not being quite so bony. He was starting to get a bit of his scant padding back and John was grateful. He didn't like the vague but unshakeable worry that he might hurt his husband. He didn't say this out loud, because he was certain the only thing Sherlock would hear in that was "fragile" – which he'd hate – but he also knew the detective understood the unspoken concern.
"Second-in-command, really. And has the dubious honour of being Sherlock's best friend, which, right now, I am more than happy to give to him."
"Come on, Mozart," he said. "Let's go home."
When he opened them, John had changed again.
"Play it," Sam said suddenly, softly.
"Bollocks," John said with a grin. "You don't need any of this rubbish, and you knew full well Harry was at the flat. Consulting detective and matchmaker? Bit of an odd combination."
“Nope. Hand to heart.”
"Yes, of course we have, Sherlock. Give us some credit, please. It's currently occupied, and
Sherlock leaned against the closed door to his office, head tipped back, eyes screwed shut as he breathed slowly, waiting for the sensation to wane.
"Yes fine, thank you. Gabriel received a reply to one of the wedding invitations. It appears Victor Trevor is coming."
He'd managed to get out of the bloody knighthood it had almost earned him, too, but it had been a near miss.
It was for Adler, though. Just another means to an end, to get Sherlock interested, to get him to do her dirty work. Find out why Alexandre mattered enough to make it into some information Mycroft must have had about Mary.
But if Mycroft knew, he was either choosing to let them get away with it, or was waiting to see where this went. Knowing the elder Holmes, it was probably the latter. Spontaneous generosity wasn't particularly his style, especially with his baby brother. If he could leverage this for something in the future, John knew full well that he would.
"You've been here before, but I never have," John replied.
"I did," Sherlock agreed. "I never make the same mistake twice."
"Do you think we could take the tube?" David asked. Sherlock baulked instinctively, knowing his reaction would mirror Mycroft's, but for slightly different reasons. His brother would worry about his children's safety; Sherlock was immediately concerned for John's. Underground, John's ability to contact him in an emergency would be limited, and although the other figures of note in London's underworld knew enough not to so much as glance threateningly at John, Sherlock couldn't be assured that their underlings wouldn't see this as an opportunity.
(See the end of the chapter for
She set her jaw, eyes bright, then shook her head.
But David smiled, shaking his head.
Sherlock took the coffee readily, but John didn’t miss the way his partner’s hands trembled, ever so slightly, as he closed his fingers around the cup.
"I took care of that personally, Sherlock. I would have obtained weapons permission for you if you'd asked, but I was content to leave it until you did so. I was somewhat surprised you didn't demand them but I was quite happy to let it go."
Before Wales, he hadn't given Sherlock's thoughts or feelings about her any consideration, and wouldn't have worried about it if anyone else had brought it up.
city, from his
But perhaps that was simply a way of keeping her family at bay, making it seem like she cared enough to do reach out if only to avoid further contact.
William had simply gone to bed one night and not risen the next morning.
John raised his head again, giving Sherlock a sharp nod.
"Why shouldn't I?" he asked.
"It's a little funny."
He just wished Adler would stop providing it.
From the man who always did his best to provide them.
John loved it, every chaotic minute of it, and it was more than enough to offset the increasingly rarer moments when Sherlock's memory failed him. Even those faded to habitual tasks like making tea or moving from one room to another in search of something. John guided him through it at first, but backed off more and more as time wore on, letting Sherlock work through it, intervening only when absolutely necessary.
John coated his hands, before sliding his right hand up Sherlock’s spine to his neck to pull him into another kiss, letting his left hand drift down to tease and fondle Sherlock’s balls. Sherlock made an impatient sound into their kiss, the sound sending John’s blood south. His partner shifted closer, and John took the hint, wrapping his slicked hand around Sherlock’s cock, stroking slowly.
"Maybe he was kept in something?" Molly suggested.
John didn't comment and, despite himself, was surprised when Sherlock did his own washing up, even if it was just a plate and a coffee mug.
"No."
"Then you need to tell him that. Straight out. You can't just let him assume it, especially not now."
Sherlock gave an inward sigh of relief when the door was unlocked and John came back in with Sandra. He had realized when John had left that they should have told Lestrade to wait. John's trip had taken fifty-seven minutes in total, including the time required to fetch Sandra from the hospital. The nurse met his eyes – she was obviously experiencing high levels of anxiety. She would not panic, however; her profession had trained that out of her and she was able to maintain some composure despite the personal nature of this incident. But her blue eyes were wider and brighter than normal, her cheeks were flushed and her expression drawn. She glanced at Sam's figure on the couch and then back at Sherlock who held a finger to his lips. Sandra nodded, licking her lips and tossing her handbag carelessly on the floor.
"Sam, can you give me one of your arms? I need to take your pulse."
He did not have enough information. Sam was providing none now – neither physical nor verbal. No motions, no words, only uneven, wavering gasps. Sherlock shifted, grimacing, and felt John move against him, pressing into his side. It gave him better balance and he nodded his thanks.
"Just think," he mused, "of all the things I could do to you like this. And I haven't even watched the video."
do this.
"They can transfer him to a private hospital after. But we need to
"No, not for a few days now," John replied. "Go to sleep, it will help."
Sherlock slipped his keys from a hook near the front door and stepped outside, crossing the silent street in the mid-winter darkness.
Somewhere in the midst of that was his partner and best friend, lost and alone.
He served them each a plate of roasted chicken with gravy, rosemary roasted potatoes, and roasted green beans and cherry tomatoes. Sandra pushed herself from her chair, leaning across the table to kiss him. Sam hesitated in surprise for a moment, then kissed her back.
John felt a cold shock and swallowed on it, nodding numbly.
"Then John had Lestrade clear the corridor and he and I sat with you until you had fully regained consciousness."
Suddenly she wanted nothing more than to have her sister there. The desire was so sharp it burned in her lungs and she nodded even though John couldn't see her. She trusted her sister with her life. Joanna would come without question. She'd been wary of Sam's past initially but she knew him now. He was family. And for all their sisterly bickering, Sandra knew she could count on Joanna when she needed to.
Sherlock huffed and bent down, brushing his lips over John's in a light kiss. John returned it, eyes dropping shut.
There was blood on John's face. A smear like the one left behind them. And on his hand.
"Mm," Sherlock hummed, stretching languidly beneath him, and John bit the insides of his cheeks.
"What, all two and a half of them? Not enough, Sherlock. What do you want?"
John hummed in agreement, dipping his head to mouth Sherlock through his trousers. The detective gave a sharp cry, arching up, twisting slightly for better contact. John obliged him, opening his mouth, letting his teeth drag across the heavy fabric as Sherlock whimpered and thrust. He kept up the teasing touch on Sherlock's balls, using both hands now, body weight preventing Sherlock from sliding down to a position that would give him more leverage.
He thought of William in Buckinghamshire – his first Christmas without his wife. But Mycroft was there with Angela and David. Mrs. Hudson had her niece, John had Sherlock.
"I won't get bored," Sherlock replied. "I want to be here."
“Yes,” Dominique said, but there was an undercurrent of confusion that said otherwise, one that sent a mild warning chill down John’s spine. “I just thought– no, it was nothing, I’m sure.”
"Exactly!"
He might have escaped John's judgment or his mother's individually, but when Sibyl agreed with John, Sherlock had learned that he was beaten.
"It wasn't meant to be, not this late anyway. We were delayed leaving Austria because of the weather here. Heavy rains, they said. And then the traffic was slow going because of the rain. I remember– I remember being surprised when I landed that we actually made it in one piece, that we hadn't skidded off the runway, because it was absolutely pouring."
"You don't know who you are?"
Occasionally he found himself in other rooms in the flat without really remembering how he got there and forgetting what he was meant to be doing. Once he realized he was on the kitchen floor, sitting against the cupboards, and Marian was holding his hand, talking him gently out of a panic attack.
John stared at the image again for a moment, then pressed a hand over his eyes.
John fixed Sherlock a cup of coffee and shook his head.
Sherlock and John
It was nothing he could put his finger on, but Gabriel had long ago learned to pay attention to that instinct. He wasn't entirely sure he liked her, and he wasn't entirely sure he trusted her.
It smacked of domesticity, and if he weren't careful it would be him and John soon, with little versions of themselves running around, messing up the flat, and demanding to be fed at all hours.
“Mm,” Sherlock sighed, stretching again, hooking his leg over John’s opposite knee, coaxing him – willingly – onto his side. “So it is.”
"Everything okay?" Harry asked.
known it would happen, because it always did, but somewhere deep in the part of his heart that was miraculously untainted by years’ worth of police cynicism, he also always hoped that it wouldn’t.
"You can yell at him all you want – I can't stop you. But you can't smoke in here."
She examined herself critically in the mirror of the small compact, smoothing strands of hair here and there until it was perfectly coifed, creating the image she wanted.
"Bad enough they're actually going through with it," Sherlock complained. "But requiring me to make a speech?"
"Sweetheart."
He pushed Sherlock backwards, and the detective felt his heart stutter before slamming back into action, acutely aware of their positions and of the refrigerator right behind them; if John off-balanced them enough to push Sherlock beneath him, he’d hit his head–
"Sherlock–" he said and his husband stopped and turned back, his expression unreadable, his eyes bright. John cast around for something to say, realising suddenly that he didn't know what to do. "Maybe we should leave it until tomorrow?"
save him and you
Not entirely dark; shadows delineated by the faint lines of light around the edges of the boot. The smell of petrol clung to him now, reinforced by the hum of a motor and the purr of tires over uneven road surfaces. Each jarring movement made him wince, but it wasn't the worst he'd ever suffered, and refocusing was a matter of moments.
"Stop what?" John asked.
“Right now we do, yeah. We have the bodies.”
He'd been right; there was a theme. Not all of them involved light bondage, but enough of them that even he, without a genius' brain, could see an obvious pattern.
Douglas had been found at his desk, and the imposter corpse the same. A focal point – chair dislodged, of course, to move the body. Faint impression of gurney wheels on the carpet (expensive but industrial, recently replaced, well-maintained). Sherlock circled behind the L-shape slowly, eyes alighting on the organized chaos. Not a mess, not like John described Sherlock's work areas (John and Lestrade watching now, DI with arms folded, John unable to do so, flexing the fingers of his right hand against impatience).
"He's killing members of a Parliamentary committee, Lestrade, and the less you know about that, the better. The men he's killed so far – there may be a reason he's choosing them in this particular order. You can stand here arguing with me or you can tidy this up and let me find him! I don't need to waste my time answering your questions – just do your job."
Every nerve screamed to get John out, to get him away, let no one else near him.
Just the idea was terrible. But he knew, he
"Which is why we're being more cautious this time. And the evidence–"
When the server had taken her order and vanished, her contact gave her a name, mobile number, and address. No paper or text trail – Mary memorized the information, repeated it back to ensure it was accurate.
"And your kids? Oh– wait– do you have kids?"
"I remember," Sherlock sighed, plunking himself back down into the chair in front of the monitor. "She should count herself lucky it isn't the one we're currently looking for."
Sherlock was silent for a long moment, looking down at his phone, then he raised his grey eyes and met John's gaze.
She returned home, sated and energized, the ever-present hum along her nerves dampened to comfortable levels. Charles and Dominique were still awake, in quiet conversation accompanied by good champagne and a baby monitor, when she returned.
"Coffee?" he asked, lifting the mug ever so slightly. Sam swallowed, suddenly aware that his mouth was very dry. He nodded and John crossed the room, handing him the hot drink carefully.
“I want to see it.”
"You know her," Mary commented. "I don't."
Sherlock circled the desk to stand behind him, leaning over John's bad shoulder, holding himself far enough away that John wasn't worried about being jostled. A hand came to rest on the back of his neck, thumb tracing the ridge of his vertebrae, and John glanced up, balanced between amused and surprised.
"What?" John asked.
and you need to get him out of there immediately. Right now!"
"I want to go on holiday in France! Please, Mummy?"
“He always was,” Irene replied. “Always slightly less so with you.” She didn’t bother reminding Sherlock that he’d chosen her as his Irish lieutenant for a reason. She didn’t need to.
, when Lestrade had to leave early, shortly before John returned from work, Sherlock had a temporary reprieve in which he was by himself, was
"What do you mean, John left?" he demanded.
"Six months, then," John sighed. "But it was never really that serious."
He didn't want the satisfaction, the feeling of triumph.
It was easy to be careful around John Watson, who was nowhere near as suspicious as he should be, for a former soldier and Sherlock Holmes’ romantic partner. It had made Mary particularly cautious at first – initially she suspected it might be an act, designed to catch out the unwary, but as she worked with him and got to know him, she’d realized he was genuinely trusting of her.
As if to balance out that lack of emotion, he felt a sudden rush now, anger, grief, terror, regret. John bit his lower lip hard, squeezing his eyes shut momentarily until the world threaten to tilt and spin again.
"All right," she said.
He was hardly one to hold with the law, but this was different.
A startled cry escaped him, one hand closing convulsively over the tube, the other digging into the wall, fingernails scrapping the patterned paper. Sherlock pressed harder, focusing on the tiny gland; John felt his knees buckle and locked them hard, pushing back and whimpering, breath coming in desperate gasps.
It probably seemed like simple arithmetic to her.
The shock on John's face almost made him lose that tenuous restraint.
in there, they owed it to him to find out – and John was acutely aware that they might not have another chance if they passed this one up.
“Nope,” Bill agreed. “We did have our fair share of the fun stuff. Remember the prince?”
"There's a very irate Frenchwoman at our door."
want it – good god, did he want it. "It's just– if you–"
"Yesterday," Marian said. He looked up to see her beaming at him, her hazel eyes bright with pride. She and her partner, Peter, had tried for years to have a baby and had eventually given up, resigning themselves to the fact that they could not. That had been two years ago. Five months ago, Sam had been almost as stunned as his sister to find out that she was expecting.
"Perhaps not as much as you might think. Getting personally involved might be… beneficial. To an extent."
"Not Bond then," he agreed. "We'll find something. But first, we need to shower. And I think we'll have to make use of that spare set of sheets I saw in the closet."
"John."
breathing."
Still, he doubted Adler would leave any entrance uncovered if she wanted to catch them immediately. Best to take the most obvious entrance. It was clear enough on this side for him to feel confident that no one was waiting to catch them up before they got inside.
. Whatever Mycroft had lost probably wasn't inconsequential – but neither was it important enough to him to have noticed, not immediately, and Sherlock knew full well his brother still hadn't identified the information.
John glanced at Sherlock, who didn't meet his eyes, gaze still trained intently on his brother.
"And it ends in death," Morgan replied. "At least for Sergeant Healy and Neil Hayes. It should have for Riley and it could easily have for you. They left you alive because they wanted to, Doctor. Not because they couldn't carry it through."
"Sorry about this, Mister Holmes," another familiar voice said next to his ear as the sound of his gun clattering, uselessly, to the concrete floor reached him from across a great distance, as his knees gave way, his body folding in on itself, "but I did promise you that you wouldn't ever see me again."
They'd been remiss about changing much of anything down here, and it certainly couldn't be rented the way it was. A few things had gone up to their flat, but a few things had come down, too. Out of necessity, they'd cleared the fridge early on and had taken whatever food they wanted, binning what was open and unusable and donating the rest. Sherlock had moved some of his experiments down to the empty fridge, which gave John no end of relief when he opened theirs and wasn't presented with half-decayed body parts next to the leftovers.
Sherlock tried to stifle a groan, the sound dampened by the tape covering his mouth. Pain flared across the back of his head, bright agony in the darkness. He drew a deep breath, and another, letting the worst of the ache subside as his eyes adjusted.
He'd left his laptop where Sherlock would see it, trusting in the detective's inherent inability to understand the term 'privacy'.
Sherlock scoffed.
"So, what's all this about then?" he asked. Sherlock and Mycroft met each other's gaze, both of them sighing softly, and John couldn't resist a grin, seeing a similar smile twitch on Irene's lips as she adjusted her hold on her sleeping son.
The sound of sirens and yelling voices hit him as if someone had unmuted the universe, hammering his eardrums. John tried to see around the smoke-sting in his eyes, the blurred images around him resolving slowly into emergency vehicles – police cars and ambulances with their lights flashing, fire engines swarming with firefighters trying to tackle the blaze. The tell-tale
John was the only one with any right.
"Actually, we do. On both counts."
He checked outside and was not really surprised see Sherlock sitting on the divan, looking out toward the sea. John found some socks in his bag and then padded outside to join his husband. Sherlock's eyes flickered towards John when the doctor sat down on his right, keeping some space between them. Sherlock had his legs drawn up but not in his classic Sherlock sulk pose. He had his left leg curled up toward his chest with his left arm wrapped loosely around it and his right leg bent, resting on the cushion, so that the sole of his right foot pressed against the instep of his left. His right hand was settled lightly on his right knee.
to make it out of here alive."
"You mean hiring an international criminal organization to do your dirty work for you," Sherlock said, swirling his glass with what John knew was feigned indifference.
Sam kept waiting for something to crop up and surprise him. Maybe he was forgetting something hugely important? Richards had told him not to worry about it too much, that Sam would know if she needed something. But how? She couldn't exactly speak to him.
"I remember standing by the doors, inside. Then your brother shouting something, telling everyone to get out, I think. I didn't think about it. Just ran."
, behind everything else, full of expectation for all the things that he shouldn’t have known about, that he’d buried so deeply no one should have seen the impressions, caught a trace scent on the wind, but Sherlock
But he would want the pictures of their family. He hadn't bothered contacting Clara to see if she wanted anything at all – she hadn't come to the funeral, so she wasn't likely to be sentimental about Harry's things. John hadn't spoken to her since inviting her to the funeral. It seemed like a lifetime ago.
"What?" John asked. "Why? Anything you've forgotten Molly will have at the morgue."
"Get up and get dressed, John. There's another victim."
"Here, if you're so eager to know," Sherlock snapped, extending a flash drive to him. John took it, raising his eyebrows questioningly.
He considered joining John and Bill briefly, but John had been right – Sherlock
Mycroft wondered if Sherlock knew.
"No," he managed, fingers splaying to push John away. "No, John, I won't be able to–
"A pressure point.
"We're checking into that, too," Hassard said, and John felt a moment of pity for her and Lestrade – the net seemed cast so wide, especially now.
He was dragging two men with him, both of them in much rougher shape than he was – and by the looks of it, they were keeping their feet only because of his grip on their collars and the speed of his pace.
Torch light glanced over the "way out" sign before swinging toward the garage's exit, automated arm down, holding them in.
John jerked so badly he stopped working, eyes frantically searching his husband's face. There was no hint of movement, but it had been his voice.
Sherlock drew back slightly but looked alarmed. John realised he was still holding the detective's wedding band and opened his hand. Sherlock snatched it from him but kept hold of it in his fist rather than putting it back on.
Not again.
John felt an unease coil in his stomach, dampening his appetite.
"It's more fun if we go out. Means you have to behave."
When Aaron began to fuss and rub his eyes, John scooped him up and prepared a bottle, bouncing the baby carefully in his free arm. It would be nice, he thought, to be so easily satisfied with such simple comforts: a bit of food and a cozy place to sleep. He tucked the baby on the sofa next to him, enjoying the tiny patch of warmth and the infant smell.
She hadn’t made the same mistake ten years ago, but now she’d caught herself discounting the two women she’d seen on the street, concealed by their clothing and the darkness, hurrying somewhere together. Back then, everyone Irene had seen had been a potential opponent, no matter how innocuous they seemed. Now, with hindsight, she could safely ignore the passersby – but she’d only been ignoring the women.
"Depends," John said. "How long are you planning on sulking?"
"Back in the kitchen!" he barked at her, swinging his gun up to the door, aiming it with practiced ease. Sandra hesitated, watching him, startled.
The engine was idling, the underlying petrol smell slightly stronger now. Tinted windows refracted interest but didn't eliminate visibility altogether; Sherlock could make out the shape of someone in the driver's seat. Ostensibly waiting on Sarraf's imposter. The train station was a ruse – with a touch of desperation but not without merit. The man the Met was looking for had no intentions of getting on a train. There was no security in leaving the city, at least not that way.
It bothered him that her wilderness training had prepared her for this; it was nearly as bad as learning John could drive well in London, too – that still annoyed Sherlock, who considered that driving in a war zone was no preparation for driving in one of the most civilized cities in the world.
"Where is this?"
He went downstairs to open the door, feeling an uncomfortable flash of familiarity at the action. He had been burdened with a case he did not want but felt unable to simply dismiss; an unwelcome sensation, yet not as annoying as it perhaps should have been. John would have pointed out that this was because Sam was Sherlock's friend and he cared about the agent. Sherlock acknowledged this was true, but it was best not to let these sort of things get around.
"I'm going to call an ambulance," she said. "If you don't want to be here when they arrive, I think I'd understand."
With a sigh, he steeled himself, and rung Lestrade's number.
John just wasn't feeling very reasonable at the moment.
They found a small table near the back where John could rest his bad arm, and Sherlock lingered at the bar, waiting on their drinks. John took the opportunity to appreciate the view, entirely unsurprised when his glance was returned by hooded grey eyes. He grinned, shaking his head, earning a cocked eyebrow in return; it was far too early – they hadn't even had one drink – but it wouldn't stop Sherlock from starting to wear him down.
When Mycroft and Sherlock’s worlds collided, things became… complicated.
"Am I completely in the wrong then, John?" Sherlock demanded. "You apologized, but did you do so simply because you think it's easier? Is this all my fault?"
"Sherlock, John," she greeted them.
He eased the soiled blanket from Charles' shoulder without jostling Aaron and tossed it into an ubiquitous laundry hamper. With a repressed sigh, Charles abandoned all hope of giving up the baby when Dominique returned to the food, clearly unwilling to be dissuade from it.
Sherlock snorted.
a terrorist. And then he decided this was objectionable and began assisting the police, a decision which led to him being removed from his home, his own identity, and moved to England. But you're angry with him."
"How very observant of you," Sherlock replied, and felt the quirk of John's lips against his skin. John moved to sit up, but a hand resting against his head prevented it, and he settled again, the smile growing as he tipped his head back to meet Sherlock's gaze.
It was personal, but he would have done it regardless.
"Christ," Sherlock managed, feeling John's grin against his lips when he was pulled into another hard kiss. The shirt and the lube weren't the only preparation John had done – Sherlock was dimly grateful, aware he wasn't going to last as long as he'd like as it was.
"Baker Street," Sherlock ordered, each word dropped like a ton of bricks, leaving no room for argument. "
It almost felt like a normal evening – what passed as normal for them – with Sherlock picking apart the plot of the programme on the telly as he picked at his food, occasionally jabbing his fork toward the screen to emphasize a point. With the light and the warmth in the flat, it would have been easy to overlook the things just beneath the surface, but John could feel them creeping up on him, a chill seeping through the cracks.
"Can I have ten minutes?" he asked. "Shoulder." The white lie made him feel somewhat guilty, especially at the warm concern on her face.
He knew that was fairly useless – and he knew that the detective was banking on being right. But he couldn't bring himself to want Sherlock's deductions to work out, not this time. It was too grim.
John tossed it on the bed with its companions and put the chair back, settling himself on top of the dark blue duvet. He scanned through the photo albums, picking out several pictures of his family from when he'd been a child and a teenager, and some of him from when he'd been in university, his graduation, a formal army photo. Harry had probably got most of the later ones from his parents, he supposed, since by the time John had gone to uni, they hadn't really been on speaking terms anymore. It seemed sad now – so much wasted time. So much wasted life.
"What's the message?" John asked at the same time.
Tricia smiled again and shifted so that she was sitting cross-legged, leaning forward with her elbows propped on her knees. John met her gaze with some effort – the alcohol was making it hard to focus so directly. She smiled slightly at him and John let out a sigh, running through everything he thought he'd been thinking in the privacy of his own mind. He must have sounded like a rambling madman.
"Enough bloody hospitals," he said. "It's not as if I'm in danger of throwing myself from a bridge."
"No need," Sherlock replied, stepping into the lift as it opened smoothly for him. "I'm not going far."
"Adair was selling information on Mary," he began, marshalling the events and information into some kind of order – there
"I've been known to have good ideas," John joked.
"No, I don't have any," Sherlock snapped. "Feel free to check when this is all over."
He snagged the flashlight and pushed himself away from her legs, chastising himself for the moment's hesitation.
"Then we increase the guards and don't allow them to go anywhere public where there's any possibility that they can be caught on their own," he snapped. "Would you like to stand here and complain to me about his capabilities, John? I know what he's done!"
But there were other things to worry about, and he helped Sherlock sit up enough to drink some water. The glass against his lips was obviously uncomfortable, but John didn't think a straw – if they had any that weren't toxic from experiments – would be any easier.
He was enough of a complication, one she couldn't simply get rid of – and, much to her surprise, one she didn't
Sherlock exhaled hard against John's skin and felt the doctor's fingers weave into his hair, tugging lightly to het him to raise his head. Sherlock ignored the sensation and stayed where he was.
He braced her against his right arm, getting her to lean back as much as she was able, which wasn't much given the post against her back to which she'd been secured. That was going to make it tricky to pull her back from the edge, but John set his jaw, refusing to think about it.
John would be fine.
Sherlock swallowed hard, eyes returning reluctantly to the screen. John leaned back a bit, letting his hand trail back up, moving closer with each pass, until he skimmed across Sherlock's balls, earning a quiet gasp. Grey eyes fluttered shut; Sherlock tipped his head back as John stroked him lightly, fingertips playing over the swollen sacks.
, especially from this particular picture (but she's a fictional character, so you're free to picture her however you choose).
"Besides–"
And Sherlock liked the sensation of silk against sensitive skin; the quiet groan he gave as his head dropped back loosely was proof enough of that. John kept his touch just light enough to cause a reaction, feeling a similar tightening in his groin in response.
"Let me get out and come round to help you," John said gently and waited for a sharp nod before he moved. Sherlock was already out and hovering behind John, waiting for some kind of direction.
, John thought, but had to admit to himself that it wasn't the most irresponsible thing he'd done since he'd met Sherlock.
," John repeated.
John frowned slightly, resisting the urge to shift in his chair. Even though it wasn't an interrogation room, he still felt like he was being questioned by the police. Which, point of fact, he was.
But this
Removing them had drawn Mycroft's gaze away from London.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John; use Mycroft’s card for that, too.”
"You don't have to remind me!" John snapped, curt tone unable to complete repress the memory of confusion, of fear. The way each step had brought him closer to home, but also closer to knowing that the tenuous, almost suffocating, hope could be broken. That he might really have been alone this time. Knowing that he couldn't have face it. Not again. Not without spending each day after that half convinced it was a lie.
"No, you shut up!" John snapped, jabbing a finger at Sherlock's chest. "You're the one who ran off and got himself caught by a psychopathic driver –
Donovan nodded. She'd seen a lot worse in her time in assault victims. She wondered who had gone after their mystery man and why. Even after all this time on the job, it appalled her what people could do to one another.
all of your facts and we didn't find anything either. Someone knows who murdered Healy, but it isn't me."
"It's on here, but it's not marked."
He cut himself off at the sound of a perfunctory knock and the door to the ground floor flat being pushed open. Bridget came in, phone in hand, looking mildly displeased.
"Not much," she replied, shrugging. "Watched the quizzes, like I said. Sometime he'd read, other times he'd just sit and have his drink."
Sherlock took the proffered box, feeling somewhat curious. It was light and rattled slightly, a gentle clinking sound, as he pulled the lid off carefully. It was a pale box, shoe-box sized, but the kind designed for storage, with the corners reinforced by small brass clasps.
John swallowed hard, still staring at the full glass of gin.
Lestrade scanned through one report from a woman convinced Mitchell had communed with her from the afterlife and had told her he’d been murdered by Russian mobsters working for NASA. It gave Lestrade a brief moment’s pleasure to imagine an American space exploration organization sending Russian gangsters after a low-level London street thug. Perhaps the moon landing had been faked, after all. And Richard Mitchell had been the one person with proof.
"I wish we did," he replied. "The case went cold because there were no prints on the knife used to kill the victim, nor anywhere around him. But there were a number of prints in the office that didn't belong to anyone who worked there. At least five different people. One of them may have been John Doe."
"Bored with everything else," John said. "You need London, Sherlock. You need the cases and Lestrade and Sam to harass about the cases and Anderson to torment and your brother to face off against and criminals to chase around madly. If that was all gone, I don't think I could keep up with the shagging required to keep you occupied."
"Well then."
you. You're not a game piece, you're the opponent. Moriarty, even Mycroft..."
Veronique had told him to stop fighting it, but he couldn't. He couldn't let the memories in all the time – they were jumbled and nonsensical, but still terrifying. It was so much easier to do nothing, to let the images on the telly shut out the images in his mind. Marian was good company because she was willing to sit in silence with him and not press the issue. She wasn't as relentless as Veronique. Deep down, Sam knew this was not what he needed, but he liked it more. It was simpler.
"His clothes?" she asked.
He hoped she hadn't been injured, or at least not too badly.
worry that I'll have a breakdown!"
in time, because John's eyes warned him very clearly that this was neither the time nor the place.
"What have you got there?" he asked.
"Didn't know you had a type."
"No," he admitted, angry at the hint of unsteadiness in his voice.
Bemused, Doe held up both hands and John took them carefully, feeling a bit like a fortune teller. He could almost hear Sherlock snickering in his head.
"But Riley came here!" John protested. "If the man who lived here was following him, had recognized him– why would he put himself in danger like that?"
"What?" Sherlock managed, aware of how thick he sounded, unable to mount a more articulate argument.
He nodded. The world shifted again, light-to-dark-to-light.
I think I'm going to keep this up until it's all grown back.
A strangled cry escaped Sherlock's lips and John kept his hand moving, stopping his aching hips to let Sherlock come – weakly and shuddering, gasping small, broken sobs. He picked up his pace again immediately, any ounce of self-control gone, the sounds of Sherlock's desperate whimpers of relief and anguish spurring him to move even harder until the edges of his vision went dark and he came, sinking his teeth into Sherlock's shoulder blade. John's hips twitched hard, his groan echoed by a fainter one from Sherlock. He thrust a couple more times, emptying himself completely, and collapsed onto his partner's back, unable to support himself on shaking arms.
"Take those off," John ordered, nodding once, briefly, at the silk pyjama bottoms Sherlock was still wearing. Sherlock raised his eyebrows, but John only folded his arms over his chest – somehow, naked, John could still manage that disarming military authority.
"Shh," he whispered, breath warm against the hot skin of Sherlock's hip. "Relax." Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, and John let his tongue dart out, drawing a quick stripe up Sherlock's cock before closing his lips around his partner.
Liam felt his own lips twitch but repressed it because it hurt too much to let himself smile fully. He felt a wave of relief and leaned back against his pillows, a chuckle escaping his lips. It turned into a coughing fit and he tried to double over, one of John's hands on his shoulder lightly to keep him upright, the other passing him a glass of water. He sipped it, coughed some more, then leaned back again with a groan.
He faltered again, re-steadied himself.
"What about the ones that make up Sherlock's cases?"
Or close enough as made no difference.
"What if we're just chasing ghosts? What if it
, John reminded himself sternly as he forced his concentration to untying their overnight bags and following his partner into the hotel. The lobby itself distracted him, if only briefly, as he drank in what Mycroft was unwittingly paying for and listened to Sherlock negotiate for their room key, all while certain the reservation would have been cancelled and they'd be evicted unceremoniously.
dog, because, when it came down to it, there was no pulling apart their lives that much, no delineating themselves that sharply.
on you–"
He didn't want to trust it, not yet, but Mary had sent that text. She would cover all of her bases and John knew her well enough to know that when she wanted something done, she did it right.
"I don't see why not. It's done on a fairly consistent basis and involves high levels of cardiovascular exertion and endurance and flexibility when it comes to dodging obstacles and bullets. Not to mention that I have a very active sex life, and medical experts have noted the cardiovascular benefits of that."
It was maddening and terrifying. When he was uncertain about how to approach some problem that involved the tricky and sometimes tiresome puzzle that was human interaction, he asked John for advice. On those rare instances when he needed to know something about John he couldn't deduce on his own, he asked Tricia.
"This kind of puzzle is right up your street, Sherlock."
John sat at Tricia's kitchen table, holding a seven-month-old Josephine on his lap. She was standing on her small legs, unsteady, and he had his strong hands wrapped securely about her waist to keep her up and to keep her from throwing herself to one side and falling. She was distracting herself with a plushy toy, but John wasn't paying as much attention to her, other than ensuring she was safe in his grasp.
John shrugged his right shoulder slightly, reclaiming his seat.
If John hadn't know what had happened, he would never have suspected that Alexandre had been the victim of an abduction by an international criminal who had snatched him from his home country and smuggled into another to use him as a game piece against yet another international criminal. He was back to the cheery self John remembered from Paris – even as the doctor scrutinized Alexandre's face (hopefully discreetly), he couldn't see any tension or reluctance hovering just below the surface.
"Why? Why would he do this? He killed three people – that we know of – cleanly, without witnesses. He made sure they were dead. This doesn't fit his pattern. Two at once? And why Mycroft and McKinney at the same time? Why not any of the others? Is he working his way through the men first? But that makes no sense either! We
"What more would you like it to be?" Sherlock demanded.
"I'll, uh, leave you to it," John said, dropping a kiss into Sherlock's dark hair. He went into the bedroom to change, and spent ten calculated minutes puttering around the flat, trying not to be distracted by the sounds of moans and curses, before vanishing back into the bedroom to liberate Sherlock's handcuffs. John slipped them into the back pocket of his jeans were even an observational genius hopefully wouldn't notice them.
A short-lived flicker of surprise crossed the guard's face but he nodded.
he felt as they were engulfed first by the suburbs, then by London itself, was somewhat clouded by the worry that John wouldn't be as enthusiastic. That he would have preferred to remain on their impromptu holiday.
"Euros then," Sherlock sighed.
He unlaced Sherlock's shoes, letting the detective kick them aside, skimming his fingers upward again. Sherlock met his eyes, pupils dilating even more, shifting slightly to let the cane take part of his weight. John smiled; Sherlock worried his lower lip with a hurried nod.
She'd put herself on display the first time, too – all of herself, using her body as a weapon to throw him off.
Crossing the bridge in the other direction, John checked his phone again and was suddenly concerned that he hadn't heard from Sherlock. He had texted to say he was going to the hospital again and hadn't thought much of it when there had been no reply, but that had been a couple of hours ago. He chewed on his lip, picking up his pace, feeling a subtle guilt settle into his stomach. Maybe he shouldn't have done that – after last night, maybe he should have gone straight home to spend some time with Sherlock.
“Sherlock–” John fumbled, for words and for a towel; Sherlock managed to snag the tea towel from the stove, passing it to the doctor who wiped them both down before pitching the towel away and tucking himself back into his clothing. Sherlock straightened himself back up as well, kneeling between John’s legs, uncertain and despising that uncertainty, trying to cajole his mind into understanding but failing.
"Have you been?" Irene asked.
This was better footage, clearer picture, better angles, early morning, three days after the previous video. The entrance to a construction site. Some kind of multi-story complex, John thought – flats or offices maybe. The surrounding street wasn't visible beyond glimpses of parked cars and pavement, but the workers coming in, having their IDs checked, were in plain view. Most of them were men, coming in ones and twos, congregating into slightly larger groups as they passed through the gate. John scanned the faces, tensing slightly when he saw a now familiar face. Riley, dressed in work clothing, a hard hat tucked under his arm, presented his identification. He spent a minute conversing with the guard and then was waved through.
Without her, there was more to manage on his own – and, Sherlock had to admit, she very rarely had the inclination to stop his other employees from taking up his time.
Sherlock ignored him – no surprise there – to fold himself down onto his knees and elbows, dislodging a puff of dust when he dragged a flat box out from underneath Mrs. Hudson's old sofa.
"You do know your uncles have a washer and a dryer and the capacity to use them?" Mycroft enquired.
A deliberate misdirection then, a poem that appeared romantic or yearning but was nothing of the sort.
He'd barely been able to eat, doing so only when John was watching and then only in small quantities. He knew he'd lost weight but John had said nothing and no one else had seen Sherlock to comment on it. He hadn't left the house and had ignored all phone calls from anyone who wasn't John – and John hadn't called him while at work. This wasn't entirely unheard of, but he would usually send a text on his way home regarding take away or enquiring as to where Sherlock was. Now it was just silence, both in the flat and electronically. John hadn't posted anything on his blog either, which may not strike anyone else as odd. He did often went days between entries, especially if they were working a case.
He couldn't imagine feeling anything but tired.
There was none of that here; her appearance was all business, the white dress and heels impractical for a construction site but ideal for suggesting authority, hair swept up, posture poised and confident.
"Don't worry about Sam," Sandra replied, her voice slightly muffled by the cupboards and the counter that separated the small kitchen from the rest of the flat. Then she leaned down, propping her weight on her arms on the countertop so that he could see her. "He's grown man and he'll be all right – let me take care of him. I'm good at it. He's very low on sleep right now and not at his best. None of us are when we're too tired. When was the last time you slept, Sherlock?"
, he thought. It was all down to maps of the city, knowing its ins and outs, its secret places, its thoroughfares. Knowing how to traverse it in plain sight or by stealth, hidden underground. He wondered, passingly, how well Douglas had known London, how detailed and accurate his mental maps had been, how easily he'd held such information in his head.
"He didn't," John replied and there was a pause before their gazes swung around to him, making him aware that he was suddenly the subject of intense scrutiny by three high ranking police officers.
"Possibly," the detective said. "But unlikely. He would have known her name if that were the case."
"With whom I'd rather be."
“Not entirely,” his partner replied. “Your greed is just more confined to certain aspects of your life. And less public than mine.”
He'd rarely seen Sherlock acting not like Sherlock, and during those times, John had kept an even sharper eye on the situation, ensuring his husband didn't turn to anything he really didn't need. Sherlock back on drugs was too frightening a prospect.
He gave her a smile.
, he thought. Then he looked back at Sam, who was watching Sherlock stonily. The Interpol agent met his eyes, but only briefly.
"Yes," he muttered. "That is what I want. But you're right: it doesn't make much sense, does it?"
"Very kind of you, I'm sure," he replied.
He was used to exasperation from the Met when it came to Sherlock, but there was none of that captured in her expression. It struck him that while this might be a game for the people behind it – and even to some extent to Sherlock, despite everything – this wasn't for her.
It was all John could do to stay standing, one hand curled around the bedframe, as Sherlock divested him of his jeans. He let go when his jumper was tugged upwards, freeing himself quickly as long fingers undid the buttons of his shirt.
Hands skimmed under his t-shirt, pushing it up, and John hunched his shoulders enough to pull it off.
"Please tell me Sherlock did
The streets were always cautious, even more so when it came to Jim.
There was one thing that always helped anyway. John stepped toward the bed and Sherlock spread his knees again so that John could stand between them. He raised his left hand and wove it into the detective's dark hair, settling it on the back of Sherlock's head and rubbed his thumb in slow circles against his skin.
"Oh," Sherlock said without hearing himself, aware that he must have spoken only by the shift in John's stance, the slight change in pressure of fingertips on his skin.
taken him three days to figure out that she'd behind it, after all. John doubted it would have taken so long if she'd been involved in the faked suicide.
Mycroft led them down a wide corridor with a Persian rug running its length then stopped in front of a door that was being guarded by another Redcap corporal. He gestured for John and Sherlock to go inside and John stepped hesitantly into the study and library, looking around, then turned back.
asked me to take this case because he could not make any progress! Like dozens of cases before and dozens of cases to come!
John grinned.
watching – doubtless there were internal cameras he wasn't aware of, that he couldn't see. How much they could record in the darkness hardly mattered. The light from one flashlight was telling enough. Even if John had been with him, it would have been too dangerous for one of them to move without a light.
What he’s not telling you is that he got stuck in a window trying to prove to a PC how the burglars got in in the first place.
"Of course not," Sherlock sniffed. "At least, it shouldn't." John rolled his eyes and didn't miss when Sherlock deliberately changed the subject. "How is your new friend? Still not himself?"
"All right, Sergeant?" he asked Donovan.
“Aliens.”
"John," he said again, somewhat louder this time. "John, wake up."
Sherlock nodded, aware of the way John tracked the motion. Such a military response. It rarely made him so uncomfortable.
"What?" John asked. "Who's Sergeant Healy?"
He rode the tube back to Baker Street in silence, oblivious to the conversations around him, and climbed back up to street level wearily, tired of arguing with himself. John Riley could wait until the next day – there was nothing he could for the injured man when he was fast asleep anyway. John was going home, back to his life, back to someone who loved him – even if there was the very real possibility that said person might have accidentally set fire to something in his absence.
is spoilt for choice. But he never bothered with anything more personal. Then, all of a sudden…"
"It's really not–" John began, interrupted when Sherlock spoke over him as though he hadn't said anything at all.
He'd hidden her somewhere. And the best place to hide something was in plain sight.
Right now, it was not just the weather that was making him restive, it was also the prospect of returning to London. John was enjoying their time here and worried that the ease they'd found with one another again would vanish when they both returned to work. Sherlock had initially been concerned about this, too. But they were both more cognisant of one another now. This would help. He did not wish to fight or have to face the prospect of John leaving him again. Never again. Not if he could help it.
"Following the events in April leading to James Murray's absence from the vote and the recovery of Kelsi Murray's body, a committee was formed to investigate both the initial crime and the more recent circumstances in hopes of identifying why Murray was being targeted and to identify the responsible party. This sort of thing is not treated lightly, Sherlock. An MP has been harassed, threatened and a member of his family has been murdered in an attempt to bully him into compliance. This goes beyond pressure or even simple intimidation and has no place in a civilised society or in our government. Benjamin Laurence sat on this committee, as did Arthur Kenton. As do I."
"Well, I'll just move with you," he said and she rolled her eyes.
He followed John around, pestering, needling, getting under his skin, nearly tasting the exasperation growing until John's patience snapped, dragging Sherlock down with it. The exquisite torture lasted ages, until Sherlock could feel nothing but the burn of pleasure down every nerve, see nothing but blackness, the bite of the cuffs on his wrists the only thing grounding him as his breath caught in his chest and his body screamed.
“Before my time,” John said firmly. “I was in Iraq. I would remember having one of the princes in my hospital.”
"I can hire my own nurse, Sherlock."
"Yeah, good point," he said, giving an irate nod.
"And it's not at all possible that he has good reason to travel to London on a regular basis? It's hardly a suspicious activity."
Sandra took a deep breath and nodded.
"Then five days, one hour, and twenty-two minutes," Sherlock replied. Josephine scrunched her nose up at him again.
"Yes, I'm here," Sherlock snapped. "What is it?"
"We were hardly stranded, John. The very word implies we were physically unable to leave–"
"Give it time," John advised. "These things tend to come back."
In a way, he supposed it was. Sherlock had turned his life upside down so entirely it still took him by surprise, and it was difficult – some days – to reconcile Bastion or the bedsit with the sprawling flat in the City that had so easily become home.
"Have you already told me who did this?" he muttered, and John didn't have to be an observational genius to hear the trepidation in that question.
"Lestrade, I have a website and a memorable name. John has a blog with a very active readership – you should know, you read it religiously. Anyone with access to the internet could find me."
Sandra searched his face again then nodded.
McKinney stirred, blinking himself awake. He turned his head slightly, squinting in the low light, trying to focus on Sherlock's shadowed figure at the end of his bed.
John nodded.
with you!" Lestrade snapped.
"What–" John started.
we don't know! If she were accessible, I could get the information needed to make an informed conclusion but I can't, because she doesn't have the consideration to exist
"I came home," John corrected. "Not back."
Allowed her driver to do the same.
"Hang on," he snapped as John turned to look over his good shoulder, dizzying relief coursing through him at the sudden sight of flashing lights gaining on them. The burst of speed made him grip the upholstery, white-knuckled, a wave of disorientation clutching his stomach when he turned back to the road ahead. The black car flashed past on the right, behind them suddenly as the constable cut back part way into the lane and slowed sharply.
Sam pushed himself to his feet without thinking and crossed the flat as she stepped inside and opened her arms, catching him in a tight hug. A rush of relief swept through him. Sandra must have called her, and astonishment replaced the relief momentarily – how did she know him so well that she knew precisely whom he needed to see right now?
It had to be Georges himself. There had to be something in his past, some overlooked detail that would mark him out as a target.
"Everything on the desk has meaning. Family, travels, past or present career. Not the mug. Black, no insignia, no patterns. Impersonal. And clean."
John pressed a bottle of water into his hands and Sherlock moved to throw it aside, but John's fingers closed over his wrist and hand, keeping it there. He had one of his own, Sherlock noted, as did the other rescue workers. Someone was talking to the woman in charge, something about the temperature outside and paramedics. Irrelevant.
"I lie all the time, John! I'm a
"I'm having tea at an old friend's."
John met Sherlock's gaze and nodded again, gesturing quickly in the direction the scuff marks had most likely gone. The trail was fairly indistinct, and any shoe size or type was masked by scuffing, but his own good sense of direction was backed up by Sherlock, who gave him a quick nod in return.
"He's improving exactly as he should be," John replied.
Gabriel stared absently at himself in the mirror as he finished adjusting his tie – he could have done it completely blind if necessary and did so on a regular basis to keep himself sharp. It had been one of the seemingly random lessons Sherlock had imposed on him just over a decade ago, one that Gabriel had thought pointlessly frustrating at first but understood perfectly now.
He was fairly certain Sherlock would let him know if the air in the flat was toxic, even if it meant copping to mucking up.
Sherlock took himself downstairs, entrenching himself in the ground floor flat, where he had more room for his experiments, and could create caustic fumes without (too much) complaint. John had repeatedly mentioned the need to get a proper fume hood, although Sherlock hardly saw the point.
"Yes, of course," she replied. "Unobtrusively. And I'll remind you that she's a sixty-two year old woman."
He sucked in a sharp breath, feeling the silence of the flat pressing in on him, suddenly aware that he was alone, aware of the guards Mycroft must have posted. Acutely aware that the killer and his employer had been leading them every step of the way and that they both knew about the committee.
"Douglas drove himself?" John asked.
"No, this one," Sherlock said, opening a drawer and pulling out a box of candles and a package of matches. John closed the drawer he'd been working on and took one of the candles, holding it steady as Sherlock struck a match and held it to the wick. It caught after a moment and a tiny orange flame sprung up.
"Blunt force trauma to the skull," John replied. "An hour, an hour and a half ago. Looks like four or five good blows – whoever did this didn't pull back, didn't hesitate."
Parts of his own online life were private, or as private as they could be under the circumstances. Mary flicked through photographs only select friends and family had access to, noting with some curiosity that there were few pictures of John and Sherlock together. It wasn't entirely surprising; Holmes wasn't a man who liked to put himself in the spotlight, nor did he strike her as the type of feel at ease with a quick, impromptu shot.
There were more of those now, and time was eaten up by lengthy visits to lawyers and banks and signing papers and reading through contracts and clauses and agreements, all of which had to be done with Mycroft, which was the most tiresome part, but at least John came along, so Mycroft couldn't be entirely overbearing.
"Not enough to do any damage," John said, closing the short distance between them to take Hassard's place supporting the nearly unconscious detective. "Get me some gauze!" he snapped, snagging the handful that was thrust at him by the paramedic and pressing it against the back of his partner's head.
"I will."
"And we're speaking of Mycroft, are we?" Irene murmured, the glare Sherlock shot her sliding right by. "Besides," she continued, setting her tea cup aside with a smooth movement, "you've already declined to pursue it. Why does it matter now?"
"But what if–" John started, momentarily silenced when Sherlock held up a hand, but refusing to back down altogether. "No, Sherlock, what if that
"He lived here?" Irene asked, raising her eyebrows.
"There's little of that to go around as it is," Irene said. "Our man of the hour has something sensitive regarding members of the highest level of government."
"And she's giving him illegal drugs?" Mary asked, raising her eyebrows.
"Time was, he'd have blown you to bits. Better times, those."
during the tedious stay, especially when his parents and Mycroft insisted on imposing themselves on him.
Sherlock nodded as John binned the two needles and the vials, as well as the rubber strip. He stretched out, feeling old twinges in his left shoulder and more recent twinges from his back and hips. The shoulder was like an old friend, or old enemy, so familiar it was impossible to remember a time when he hadn't felt it, although there had once been a John without this old injury. And even a John for whom it was a new injury.
Mary, on the other hand… Sherlock understood the practicality, the necessary mathematics. John did, too, in his own way – he was a trained surgeon and a former soldier. The decisions that had to be made in hard, bloody moments were as calculated as those Sherlock made, the ones that made him seem cold to people who operated entirely on sentiment, but that were balanced, considered, logical.
"Does it really matter what Kate is wearing?"
"All right," John said.
Molly wondered if he was even aware of that.
The small smile on Sherlock's lips lit his eyes with a gleam.
"You won't shoot me," the Woman continued. "Oh, don't look like that," she continued, taking another slow, casual step toward the door before stopping. She couldn't see him, he knew, but he felt the flash of alarm and irritation all the same. "It's not just sentiment, you know. I haven't come completely unprepared."
"You almost always make me breakfast," John replied easily. "Just make enough for one more."
"It's– no. I don't think so, no."
"Does that mean I shouldn't go?" Riley asked simply, meeting his gaze with his good eye. John fought the urge to fidget and shrugged, shaking his head.
told me what it said,
The hint of fresh air as he slipped from the cab was short lived; the sensation broadened as other scents were identified – dust, petrol, rubbish, the general pollution of the city. The cabbie pulled away, unconcerned, and Sherlock hovered, pretending to check his phone, drawing the illusion of boredom and normality around him. Any eyes watching – real eyes – would pass him by, disregarding, giving him the opportunity to slip away unremarked.
– tense muscles, rapid breathing, unconscious pulling away. His name spoken in a low, soft tone. It could have been a murmur but it was a plea, the word echoed by the nervous twitch of Sherlock's fingers.
"And make sure I never see them again," he added, his voice suddenly like ice. "Because if I do, I promise you, no one else ever will."
"Do you have some fascination with asking useless questions?" Sherlock snapped. "Would you like to give our killer more time to plan his next assault? I'm sure no one will mind that, particularly as his attacks have become steadily more violent."
"Jim Moriarty isn't the only one who can buy off a cabbie to do what he wants," Bridget said. "Mary wants us all alive, and I intend to stay that way. I
Terrified.
"Sally."
"He knows more than you think he does," John replied. Donovan shot him a sharp, mistrustful look and he shook his head hastily. "I don't mean that – he's not lying to you or anything. Just – if you took the time to really talk to him, you'd see."
"It was seven years ago, but thanks," John replied. "It happens in war sometimes. Too often."
"My blog?"
She'd met them only once before. Granted, she'd saved their lives, but that should by no means have made her an expert in his operations, let alone given her any authority over his actions.
"I think you owe me dinner," Sherlock commented when they pulled apart, foreheads resting together.
"Right, good," he said automatically, passing his good hand over his eyes to the protest of weary muscles.
The closeness of Sherlock's voice matched his sudden presence; John had been alone then immediately hadn't been, the detective towering over him, expression verging on a glare.
Sherlock would have felt better if John had come home drunk on that ghastly gin he and Tricia drank even now because it was what they'd drunk in Afghanistan. But he hadn't been drinking. That made the situation somewhat worse. He'd been sober and talking to Tricia. Sober and disappointed.
Sherlock met his gaze, surprise flickering through tired grey eyes, and John nodded, running a thumb over his partner’s knuckles.
"And I was about to head over there," John added.
He rolled his eyes and added that note to the pile then read the next one on the arm of the chair.
"I have a finite supply. Presumably," Sherlock sniffed.
"Hello, Mr. Holmes," she said pleasantly, apparently unfazed by Sherlock's glare. "How are you feeling?"
After Alexandre had left, Sherlock carefully catalogued all of the new contact information into his phone, deliberately ignoring John, who watched with an amused smirk. Maybe – just maybe – if he played it right, there could be another trip to Paris in their future. He'd certainly enjoyed the first one.
“Jesus,” John muttered, pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “Sherlock, this is
"Six months afterwards," Sherlock said sternly. "She sought out our assistance, I needed a new Irish lieutenant. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement. Not dissimilar to a young man who was being watched by Interpol when I met him, but who had no desire to join their ranks."
"What are we going to do with my blog, Sherlock? Should I write up a post asking Mary to call us?"
, she thought. Five years Sam had been dealing with his memories, making progress. Being permanently reassigned to London – being allowed to live his life as himself again, not as an alias – had been the best thing for him. That had been nearly three years ago now. Within a month of returning home, he'd made more progress than he had in the entire two years prior to that. Most of that was because of Sandra. Veronique often had her suspicions about Sherlock's purported genius but she would admit the man was capable of reading people. Even when concussed, apparently. And while most of Sam's close friends would have baulked at introducing him to a woman who was interested in him, Sherlock had disregarded all common sense in the matter and simply done it.
"Why now?" Sherlock growled.
he needed like breathing. Around whom everything revolved, like the earth apparently did around the sun.
He saw John tense a bit then force himself to relax.
narcotics," Sherlock snapped.
"Morgan," John supplied. He wasn't happy that Riley was struggling with that but wasn't surprised, either.
"Well then," he told his niece, "I'm going to eat all of it."
"Plus I'm really bloody pissed about this," John said, gesturing vaguely to his injured shoulder with his good hand. "Once was more than enough for a lifetime."
"Yes, I know," Sherlock said. "Although you've clearly demonstrated your willingness to kill when the situation required it."
She shook her head, the light from John's torch moving slightly across the page as if searching for an answer.
"Hmm…" John considered. "
"No," Sherlock said as Mycroft stepped out of the kitchen. "We most certainly will not."
He'd moved his laptop and John's to the coffee table and spread out the files on the desk before deciding there wasn't enough room and clearing some space on the kitchen table as well. He'd taken the basic facts sheet for each committee member and fixed them on and around the doors between the kitchen and the living room so he did not have to move back and forth between the rooms on a regular basis. He'd also spread out a map of London on the floor and circled the residences they maintained when they were in the city. Not all of them represented constituencies in London, of course. One of them wasn't an MP but sat in the House of Lords, and Sherlock was unsurprised to learn that his primary residence was in Buckinghamshire, not far from where Sherlock himself had grown up. Another was from Wales, representing part of Cardiff. The other four were MPs for various areas in England. He'd dug out his map of Britain as well and circled their permanent homes for completeness' sake, although he strongly suspected that there would be no connection to places this time. The link lay in their participation on the committee that was investigating the threat against James Murray.
"I wouldn't want to deprive of you of your raspberries," he said, the words sounding weak to him, a white lie to smooth over a situation neither child was even aware of.
John pulled out his phone, called up a map of the UK and positioned himself next to the bed so that he could hold it and Doe could see it.
"Nursery rhymes again, Mycroft; he's communicating to us in stories. He has been this entire time and this is no different. It's raining, it's pouring, yes?"
"Not good enough, Sherlock," John said. "Not this time. You tell me. Right now."
John sighed silently, flipping the first file open, unsurprised by the mess of papers within. Sherlock had probably rammed the contents of several files into one before returning the rest to his brother's aide. He might have had some kind of system for determining what to keep and what to send back, but John suspected part of it had been haphazard, born of a need to annoy Mycroft.
Nor was it particularly surprising that Georges was younger than the sister by nearly three years. The emotional complications that other people heaped upon themselves were always tedious and very often ridiculous, but Sherlock had to admit – privately, because doing so out loud would only have it repeated back to him at inopportune moments – that it did help sustain his career.
"I thought you said it was the Military Police," John protested.
, he typed. He passed the phone to his partner, who looked caught between irritation and shock. Sherlock scowled and John kissed the twin lines between his eyebrows.
"Did you?" John asked.
let you and David stay overnight, so we can build a cushion fort and do finger painting. What do you think?"
," John said. "We'd know."
When Sandra was seven, it was a prince. It didn't matter which prince; any prince would do. As long as he was rich and handsome. And had a palace with servants and horses and hosted balls and took her on expensive holidays. She watched and re-watched
He growled, dipping his head into his hands, then recomposed himself the moment before the door swung open.
"Is he a cricket player then?" John asked. "Those blows were certain – he'd have to be familiar with using it."
"No, John, I don't know. I meant there was nothing else that I was keeping from you."
Probably best not to say that online, especially since there are police officers who read this.
Their lives had been so separate for so long that John had felt vaguely as though he'd been invading a stranger's privacy by looking through her photos.
But no one ever let him.
When the video had run its course, Sherlock closed the browser and clicked the laptop shut definitively.
"If I'd known this before today, I wouldn't have," Sherlock replied crisply. "I'm not talking about myself. Look."
Sherlock nodded but there was a flicker in his features – that anger again. John wondered what would happen after he did go to sleep. Sherlock had eyes all over the city, and no one noticed the homeless, he said. They blended in with the background.
"This pub, you used to go there on a fairly regular basis. I was just there this afternoon talking to one of the waitresses who remembers you."
Home.
“Through your solicitor then,” Lestrade agreed shortly. “And if you see Richard again – if
Sherlock withheld a small sigh; that was actually true. He rarely took refuge in sleep – or pretending to sleep – but it was often an effective weapon with John, when he needed one.
"I understand the bloody sentence, Sherlock! But we've been dealing with murders for the past two weeks! You called me out of the blue and insist I come home – what else was I supposed to think?"
"What
"Your firm, Sherlock. And, as a matter of fact, we do. This needs to be dealt with discreetly. Without any ties back to the government."
It might have been a simple statement, an observation of the obvious, but something in it, some tiny emphasis, perhaps, or an underlying coolness to the tone, suggested a threat.
"You wear too many bloody layers," Sherlock muttered, and John grinned, tossing the shirt aside as his husband scrambled backwards, stretching his lanky body across the mattress. John followed, reaching past him for the lube, heart suddenly thudding hard, almost painfully, in his chest.
Some things were important.
“But what
"I remember the date
It was almost worse when John was there. Almost. When Sherlock was alone, the silence was his. When John was there, the silence was unnatural because it was
She was an unknown quantity. Perhaps a threat. Perhaps under threat.
Lestrade peered over Sherlock's shoulder, aware that his own confusion was mirrored by Hassard's and was only compounding Sherlock's impatience.
"Yes!" Sherlock retorted. "Yes, I have, John! I spent twenty minutes looking at myself in the mirror before deciding that I would be better off not leaving the flat! I look like– I look repulsive."
The first one was enough. It was a picture of a wall on which someone had drawn a crude message in permanent marker. Below the word "hello" were two childish houses, all boxes and triangles, complete with chimneys with squiggles of smoke. It took John less than half a second to work out the message.
"Please don't, John," Sherlock sighed. John hesitated, biting his lower lip. If Sherlock had moved at all, curled up on his side facing away from him, sat up against the headboard and sulked, John would have reconsidered. The softness in his voice and his stillness made the doctor nod. Sherlock needed to be alone now.
"I know you have a badge," John said, stretching out in the office chair, privately enjoying the show, "but it isn't actually
It certainly would for how Sherlock felt him about him – and his things, and his time, and his personal space. The smile was back on the detective's lips; John traced it with a thumb, watching a shadow of desire flicker for a moment. Amazed that it was his, telling himself not to be so stupid about it ever again.
"Good," he said, forcing the thoughts down, refusing to let them take hold. "You're doing great, Sherlock. Not much longer now. We're almost there."
And Irene knew full well he hadn’t had that chance lately.
Mycroft only nodded.
"Maybe, although potentially difficult for a cabbie to take that much time between fares that consistently."
"Anytime you need something, they told me to tell you to call," Alexandre said. "Anything at all."
It had felt like a lie then, a buried uncertainty as to whom Sherlock would actually choose.
"I want to," Sherlock replied levelly and saw the smile that twitched on John's lips and touched his eyes. The doctor reached down and snagged Sherlock's hands. A subtle movement of John's thumb pushed Sherlock's wedding band a bit higher up on his finger, away from his middle knuckle.
"It has to stay on for a bit. Just a bit longer, okay?"
"I'll get a forensics unit back," Lestrade sighed. "See if we can't get anything off of it."
probably is this time! I mean all of this!" He gestured to the room, then jabbed a finger at Mycroft. "Mary is still bloody
"For dropping the case," John said, splaying his left hand so that his fingers rested on Sherlock's ribs and his thumb just against his abdomen. "And not just for me. I mean that. For you, too. I don't want to lose you."
“Jesus Christ,” John muttered. “Sherlock?”
Yes, the bed. He thought about it again with a sleepy smile. He could just get up and go to bed. Sherlock didn't need him. He was talking to the skull, something about McKinney and Canadians and the army and poppies and the inadvisability of buying Chinese take away from hospital vending machines…
He had on his fatigues, his pack strapped to his back, his helmet resting heavily on his head. He could almost feel the red cross patches stitched to his sleeves.
"Give me a few minutes and I'll see you."
"Absolutely not," Sherlock snarled.
The car he was expecting was there. Black, sleek, tinted windows. Not the car he would have associated with Douglas' wife. Purchased for her by her husband. Privacy and anonymity allowed her to vanish in the sea of similar cars that plagued the city, to move across London unremarked.
"Yes. Obvious."
being pulled down with you, Mycroft!"
Stepping into the house was like a cool breeze on a sweltering day; the world seemed to right itself a bit, tension he hadn’t been aware of and didn’t want seeping away. Once inside, he allowed John to help him up the stairs; there had been no question of walking from the cab to the door on his own. One never knew who was watching (probably Mycroft), and it was bad enough he still had a lighter bandage wrapped around his head and these persistent black eyes.
"No," he said flatly.
, on the other hand… There is something to be said about being in business for yourself, I suppose. Your people are remarkably adept at maintaining a healthy distance between your company and the law."
"Home late every night this week," his husband murmured in reply, flipping a page. "Visiting a stranger in the hospital? Or are you having an affair with your secretary?"
"How much do you remember?" he asked. No need to ask what events he remembered – he'd been correct in his initial assessment at the Yard. Veronique had told him as much when she'd come by three days ago, apparently for the sole purpose of making him feel guiltier. Sherlock despised guilt – although it was a useful emotion in criminals – and did not understand the need for it. It distracted him and wasted time. And it was not as though he had intended for Sam to recall the events on the bridge.
"Evidently," Mycroft replied.
to me, John. Mary knows who he is because she follows the news and she follows us. Yes, yes she does." He tightened his grip on John's wrist slightly, not enough to be threatening but enough to stop his partner from pulling away. There was no time for the finesse the situation needed, no time to spare John's feelings or indulge the doctor's anger on his sister's behalf.
It still might not have been real, it still might have changed.
He thought it might be nice to have someone who wasn't demanding answers, either legal or medical.
"Don't tilt your head back," he warned as Sherlock tried to accommodate him. The detective settled, blinking his good eye; John wet another flannel, with cold water this time, and pressed it carefully against Sherlock's left eye. It was already swollen, and would probably be useless for a day or two come morning. The bruise had blossomed out to reach the faint mark left on his cheek from where Lestrade had punched him months ago.
“This,” John continued, “is the tunnel from the parking garage, and it goes down here where we found the ladder. It looks like there’s a bunch of other structures in this area, including tube lines and access tunnels, and this one may connect to those, but it also connects here,” he drew a line quickly, zig-zagging slightly, to match with another circle, “here, and here.” He repeated the process twice more.
"Don't make me cut it into small pieces and feed you," Sam said in a dark voice. "Because I will. You want to act like you're three and having a tantrum, I can treat you like that."
"I thought Douglas helped her get access to those tunnels," Bridget said. "What?" she asked when two surprises gazes swung her way. "You know Mary reads John's blog. Why shouldn't I?"
John nodded mechanically, searching Sherlock's features – dark and shuttered – for some hint as to what was going on, trying to keep up with someone who was, as always, five steps ahead.
3 July
"I understand," he replied. "He may be feeling the same thing about you."
The same way he'd been before meeting John Watson.
John froze when Sherlock's eyebrow twitched upward and he gave John a long, piercing look. The doctor waited for the word "Afghanistan" to come out of the detective's mouth. His breath caught in his chest and his hands curled into fists again.
"Bit risky, don't you think?"
want."
That wasn't unexpected, he told himself.
5 July
Sherlock gave him another puzzled glare, as if trying to figure out whether John was having him on.
"Why would you say that?" she asked quietly.
"It most certainly is," Sherlock agreed.
He became abruptly aware that he was holding his breath, willing John to say no, but the doctor merely shrugged and smiled, to David and Olivia's utter delight.
John came back down the stairs and Sherlock exhaled in a rush, relief so strong washing through him that he felt light-headed and faint. He closed his eyes, feeling the muscles around his eyes and lips tighten, pulling slightly.
"She's not on shift right now, Sherlock," Lestrade sighed.
was all business – same as the suit – and she supposed she should be used to it, but undressing was often easier. Especially when she could simply cut the clothing off. She hadn't this time. Not for cases like these. Not when it might be important.
, he sent to Sherlock. There was no immediate reply; John waited another minute, then two, lips pursed, gaze fixed on his phone.
He drew back slightly, involuntary surprise, lips parting with a reply that died at the dark, frustrated glint in Sherlock's eyes.
A well-considered position was always a position of power, and he had no desire to be caught floundering or to simply see where circumstances took him. Far better to be the one directing those circumstances. It was much more likely to end agreeably for him.
"I wouldn't," Donovan agreed. She sighed again, breath hanging in front of her face, a tiny white cloud that vanished slowly. "God, Greg, whoever did this to him – I don't want them coming back for him. All it would take is a phone call pretending to be a panicked family member."
He held onto himself, also wanting Sherlock to enjoy it, to hear the small whimpers that slipped from his partner's lips, nearly buried in the pillows. John was rewarded by a faint gasp when he drew out enough to slide a second finger in; the sound deepened to a cut off moan when he skimmed Sherlock's prostate, tickling and teasing.
"I might," Harry replied, pushing her food around vaguely on her plate. "Might be nice to get away, have some time to myself. Not that I don't have that anyway– Jesus that sounds so self-pitying."
There was another pause, an uncertain hesitation.
those bodies! I saw Kelsi Murray's little skeleton come out of the ground! I saw Laurence and Kenton dead in their homes and Brace all over the road! I saw all of that! But that isn't why you're doing this! You're doing this because he's playing a clever little game!"
Crawling into bed with him, wrapping him in her arms again, Sandra felt a flash of anger so strong it physically hurt. She bit her lip against a gasp and tried to keep herself from tensing. The last thing Sam needed was to feel her distress, but it was bright and raw; anger at the world, at James Moriarty, long dead, at Interpol, at Sherlock for calling him to that murder in August. Without that, would this have happened? Sandra drew in a deep breath. She knew Sherlock hadn't thought of it, but he should have. Then she remembered Sam saying once that he preferred it if other people didn't think of it all the time so that he didn't feel like he had to, either. That he didn't want to be treated like he might break at the slightest touch.
I reckoned whatever he'd done had actually driven him out for some air (that'd be a first) and that he'd get home eventually. He always does.
3 July
"You'll get yourself arrested, looking like that."
Her phone rang, startling her, and Donovan took a steadying breath before reaching for the receiver.
The detective's lips traced up John's neck, fluttering over his pulse and John sighed again, a touch more sharply this time. He felt Sherlock's mouth whisper over his jaw and turned his head a bit more, meeting his husband's lips. Sherlock pushed himself up a bit, his hand moving farther up the inside of John's thigh and John spread his legs more in response. He shifted, trying to draw Sherlock's fingers up and in more, but Sherlock moved his hand maddening to the top of John's thigh, splaying his fingers across the denim.
to do it in London.
. He should be grateful we're bothering to come at all."
"That's your handwriting," Sherlock said, nodding to the notes John had jotted down after the fact.
He knew that name – it was him, beneath all the masks he'd donned when he was someone else, all the other identities that could be removed like coats until he was left only with the one that fit and it was still who he was, even here in the darkness that wasn't always dark–
"I'm doing the best I can right now," he said. "This will help. Even if it doesn't seem like that right now."

didn't need anyone making worse at the moment, either.
He stopped in front of John, swallowing almost nervously as the doctor glared at him. John huffed, the sound somewhere between annoyance and approval, and moved to circle behind Sherlock.
"Right, that's it," John snapped. "Out. Get out of my house.
With a sigh, Sherlock plucked the letter off the floor.
He'd had Harry bring some of Sherlock's things as well and was glad for it – he couldn't wash Sherlock's hair, not with the bandages still on, but he could shave him and bundle him into his own pyjamas after drying him off.
"Oh my god," he moaned, shaking his head.
She hesitated, then gave a slight nod.
He searched for the feeling but his body seemed shut off. John pressed his eyes closed a bit more tightly, putting his own hands on Sherlock's hips, hoping that would help.
"Don't," Sherlock said softly, snapping the word like a whip, keeping John from saying something in anger that he
"What?" the DIs asked in unison.
Like he was.
He asked himself why – for the thousandth time – and wondered what Sherlock would make of all of this. If he'd go talk to the family and strip away that veneer immediately. Or if it went further than that, if Sherlock would have to push for more information, dig deeper to find the cracks.
He wondered if he could pretend he wasn't home. The light was on in the kitchen, but it might not be visible through the living room windows. He pursed his lips in displeasure – it wouldn't matter. Sam had managed to get Mrs. Hudson to let him in once before, there was no reason he would not do so now. But perhaps his landlady was home, though? No, Sam could have Interpol trace the location of his mobile. Sherlock supposed he could shut it off, but Sam could also just call John and find out where he was.
"Get out your phone."
"Is it?" John asked, playing idly with a curl. "I'll try to make it more interesting for you then. How about that?"
"And that, of course, isn't him," Mycroft said. "Oh, it looks like him, superficially, but, it's not. Close enough that the altered identification photo would draw no suspicion."
"Oh that's good then," John spat. "I need to know
"It's blue," John said.
"He came down to visit me," she replied. "But don't ask me how he got there, because he doesn't remember."
"What?"
John nodded.
"Do you feel safe, Sherlock?" John asked softly.
John knew Sherlock well enough to know that it hadn't been pleasurable enough to warrant trying again soon.
"It hasn't yet," he said, his own voice taking on that curiously dull tone. He felt suddenly numb inside, as if none of this mattered any longer. He hadn't wanted the atmosphere in their flat to be permeated by Sibyl's death. He wanted things to be normal again, to be the way they had been before. He didn't want John watching him carefully, evaluating his words and actions and expressions.
to be something there. Some reason he'd been chosen. Something he knew, or ought to know.
"It's because you were bored out of your tree and Greg's probably sick of answering your whiny texts."
"I can't–" he said. His voice wasn't his own. Hoarse. Raw.
He tried to pull away from that too, euphoric with relief as he sank away, separating himself from the pain. It hovered above him; he tried to cut it off, a small groan escaping, unnoticed from his lips.
"Good-bye, Doctor Watson," she said.
The building was modern, all smooth, sleek lines rising up at least a dozen storeys above street level. Just far enough outside the city's centre that they'd lost the tourists and the area had taken on a residential feel – it was a touch too suburban for John's taste, which make him smirk at himself. Baker Street had spoiled him.
John clambered somewhat awkwardly out of the cab, leaving Sherlock fumbling for his wallet, uncomfortably aware of all the times he'd left John to settle the bill. The sound of the front door closing behind them echoed with an odd, lonely harmonic, only accentuating the glowering silence John had imposed on them and Mrs. Hudson's absence. The unnatural quiet felt almost physical. Cold and hollow.
Sherlock sat back, drawing his hands down John's sides, over his hips, along his thighs. The doctor gave a quiet whimper and Sherlock pulled away, picking up the candle and the matches. He struck a match and smiled at the way John's whole body shuddered at the sound. He lit the candle and shook out the match, the tiny flame vanishing with the smell of sulphur and a crack of thunder outside.
"What did he order?"
walking distance," he added, aware that Sherlock considered the entire city to be walkable, given the right amount of time.
“It’s all thanks to my blog,” John murmured in reply, dotting kisses along Sherlock’s jaw, shifting when the detective did, giving him enough space to open the nightstand drawer. The lube was passed to him; John dropped it within easy reach.
