“Don't think he took to kindly to that idea” Steve tried, all the while thinking that it used to be so much easier talking to Péter. How was it so easy for Tony?
Artur looked up at him with round hopeful eyes and Tony didn’t bother trying to resist the curious melting sensation in his chest. He wasn’t made of stone for pity’s sake.
Péter's insides went cold, shock numbing him for a second before he sputtered, "They c-cant! Tony won't let them do that to us."
Natacha’s quiet voice when it came startled him. The young girl stood in front of his desk, blue eyes boring down into him with censure.
if you wanted Ian to ever get in the water, giving him the memory of his brother nearly drowning probably wasn’t the way to go.”
"It's productive. We'll always need things to keep warm. New clothes can be made from scraps" she said with a hint of defensiveness and Péter shrank with renewed guilt. She was right. It was smart to have ways of keeping warm.
His instincts hadn’t failed him before. Maybe it was time to go underground. He could get in touch with Jann and she’d spread the word to the others. Something wasn’t right. Something was about to happen.
Despite his loose-limbed posture Steve wasn’t fool enough to think Tony was in any way relaxed. A bottle of Genever (most likely pinched from Bucky’s room) rested open on the table, no glass in sight. Steve approached Tony carefully, eyeing the nearly empty bottle. For once he actually hoped that Bucky’s efforts had gone into draining the bottle as much as Tony’s.
“My train leaves before yours,” Bruce noted when they had their tickets and had worked their way away from the crush at the booth.
“No, Nonna, I’m safe. He wouldn't...” He let out a rush of air. Anxiety and defensiveness building in his chest and said slowly. “He wouldn't do anything to hurt me.”
"However, as a devoted man of the cloth so driven by compassion, I am confident you will find it within you somehow." Stefen far too confidently returned. He motioned toward Pepper who nodded a quick acknowledgment before sheparding Péter and Anya away. They still looked frightened but this time both followed without complaint.
James sat back in his chair with a sullen pout. And true to form, Ian pushed his untouched roll to the side of his brother’s plate.
"Are you going somewhere?” she asked, eyes flicking to the coat slung over his arm. "I have a letter I need dropped off at the post office if you're willing."
Meanwhile the children blinked back at her, silent and waiting, and Charlotte pulled back her lips into what she hoped was a smile and not the snarl of irritation she wanted to send their father.
Pietro narrowed his eyes at Bucky and in Romany muttered lowly, "Wanda won't eat. She thinks you're trying to poison us like they did."
An espresso machine? Tony gaped after them, well and utterly speechless for once. It must be some sort of mistake. Stefen would not have spent so much money on something so nonsensical as an espresso machine, from Italy, no matter how often Tony complained about the superiority or his longing for proper cappuccino. Maybe he had meant to order Tony some expensive beans and the shop had gotten it wrong? Tony mused as he tore open Stefen’s letter.
Her eyes widened as Stefen brushed past her, forcing her to turn swiftly lest he knock her aside. The breath caught in Tony’s throat as Stefen strode up to the banner with purpose and wordlessly yanked the thing down with one purposeful violent tug.
“My point is Captain,” Tony sighed. “Your children want nothing more than to know the world and their place in it… and that starts at home. Don’t think that they don’t need you to be there, to take an active role, just because you put clothes on their back and keep a roof over their head. They could do without those things in a pinch… but they can’t do without their father. This I know for a fact.”
Ned frowned. If there is one thing that could get him out of a panicked slump it was righteous fury. (He and Peter are kind of similar in that regard)
"I said I am Pan" he confirmed. She smirked at him like she was trying to hide the vicious look on her face.
he was not fine he wanted to go to his room, maybe cuddle up with Wade or make some updates with his dad, work out with pops. But no, he was stuck on this stupid field trip with a taunting Flash and Ms. Terry who has not stopped giving him the evil eye after setting foot in the building.
"Good, you two are meeting me in a training room after this, I finished making them, and I need to test it out."
"But the shot hit his buddy beside me and hit his thigh.  Before he could do anything else, I grabbed the gun, but I kinda overestimated how strong he was holding the gun so I kinda hit the driver on the head with the gun with the force I was using and the dude passed out- "
She and Betty thought it was because Flash wanted the Job so much. Anyway, they had no intention of being in the receiving end of Flash Thompson Bully extrodinare, so they decided to keep things on the downlow.
"Really guys?" Peter questioned. Because what else did you do when your aunt and uncles and older sister figure decides to embarrass you. "Pete!" Rhody exclaimed as though they weren't waiting for them to get there. Wade snorts.
I feel like I wrote this one and the reset better than the ones before, so, yeah, this is one of the better ones.... Which says a lot about how I write
"Well, you have my blessings Steve, I  know I knew you first, but Tony......  Is my nephew,  even though I'm at odds with his father right now. "
Peggy noticed the miniscule flinch that came from Tony. A look around told her that the rest noticed it too.
"Alois I swear to fuck, one more stunt like that and you're going to the mail room." she kept pointing and saying as she walked in.
"He lives here, and don't change the subject, what were you doing?" Tony cuts in. This.... Is gonna end badly.
"Apparently he was supposed to go to this big field trip, and Tony  signed the permission slip. His teacher didn't believe him, and now he has detention for forgery."
"Well, you’ll be glad to know he did once upon a time intern here, my personal intern in fact-" he rest a hand on Peter's back
He ate quietly, and ignored his classmates stares. He was glad For Wade though, he warned his classmates not to overwhelm Peter, his class and Mr. Warren seemed plenty intimidated by his boyfriend.
"It's OK, Alice, take as long as you need, give her a hug... Or a stern talking about safety whichever you prefer." Peter waved her off.
"Peter's bully, the kid he never tells any of you about." MJ said calmly as though they were talking about the weather. Peter looked at he betrayed.
"Are you saying that you've been hitting babyboy? because it sounds an awful lot like that." Wade had a Katana in a hand, If he wasn't hugging Peter from behind, Peter was sure he'd get to know what minced Flash looked like by now.
: so you can imagine how mad Tony Rogers-Stark was to hear what made his personal intern panic this much.
: there was a homophobic dude making comments so they made everything as gay as they could think to make it.
"Would you guys like to meet them? I think you have been given access for a while." Scott decides to break the silence. the class merely nodded dumbly and followed Scott inside the training room.
His fathers were in the kitchen together, Steve drawing something and Tony nursing what looked like his first mug of coffee of the day. Wanda was munching on an apple. Clint was having a discussion with Bucky and Rhody.
Ned stepped up because as much as he wanted to see Flash pounded to a fine pulp, he was sure Peter would not be impressed, and he was also sure Flash would bug them even more, and also because he was sure that whenever making a decision, MJ thinks "what would Peter do" and then proceeds to do the exact opposite. So she's obviously not going to help.
He smiles again as the plane crashes, "I'll be with you soon my Star." he murmurs as the water drowns the Valkyrie.
"Probably the school smoozing up to some capitalist asshole or something. I heard they're only staying for a month." MJ said nonchalantly.
"No, no you should not. Wade, come on it’s been three months since your last kill, don't you wanna keep going?" Peter says frantically.
"Come on sleepyhead, spiders don't hibernate. Get up." Peter was tempted to try to convince Wade that spiders do actually hibernate, but decided it not worth the effort.
a dangerous person, and chances are he's more capable of killing them than them adding a scar or two.
"Tony stop using that kind of language in front of Peter. " he says calmly as though his husband wont throw their son's boyfriend from the top floor.
Flash spoke up before Eleanor could say anything , "YEAH! ELEANOR'S RIGHT! THERE’S NO WAY PENIS PARKER CAN GET AN INTERNSHIP HERE ON HIS OWN."
"How..... How did you know that?" Betty asks and Wade laughs but doesn’t answer. Cindy thinks it would be best if they just..... Don't ask about his stalker tendencies.  At least he didn’t look inside the school, or the records.
The woman looked terrified when he was peeling her skin off. She hurt a lot too if her screams were anything to go by. He couldn't remember her name, Crissy? Kaitlyn? Cristene? That must be it.
"Yes, whoever it was, it has come to speculations that Mr. Parker may or may not be involved in selling or buying illegal substances. " Mr. Stewart said and waited as though he expected  Steve to start screaming.
Cindy knew Ned has two moms, but Cindy has a dad, and she is absolutely familiar with that glint in Dr. Odinson-Banner's eyes. That's the face her dad makes when he teases her about her crush on that one girl on TV. She winces on Ned's behalf.
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE PENIS?" Flash hollers. Peter rolls his eyes. And makes his way towards the rest of the class.
Flash looked dumbfounded for a moment, as though he hadn't thought of that then shook his head and sneered at Peter again.
Oh, alright he supposed that's probably how others felt huh. For Wade, the fact that Peter lives there had always been more important than the avengers. Not to say Avengers had no significance of course not. He had to figure out how to get past all of their security for like more than half a year.
"If you say so..." Alice looked unsure, but ultimately, left and now Peter was left in front of his peers... Oh boy.
No she does not need a tour here thank you very much! Wha? -why?-how did they even manage to get a trip here?  Sure SI does allow  field trips, but those were ellucive as all hell.
"Of course," Bucky agreed as he silently watched Steve put away the drawings and lock the codebook in the bottom drawer of his desk.
"And according to the statement I have here, your father didn't have time to teach you much before he was killed, and you were an undisciplined student at the university."
She'd laughed at him, but not in a mean way, and honestly Péter was okay with her laughing however she wanted to because she had just about the nicest laugh he'd ever heard.
The cook clucked her tongue sympathetically, and the request kicked her into gear like a soldier given orders.
Dvořák didn’t miss the way Lt. Becker stressed Rogers rank, a subtle reminder that Rogers was still Lt. Becker’s superior, and a Major by his own right. Dvořák ignored him, he wasn’t saying anything their own Commanding Officer didn’t say and certainly none of it was new to Rogers. Dvořák didn’t care what fancy new rank they’d shoved on him.
“I know, ‘vengeance is mine sayeth the lord’.” Tony quoted with a smile that might have been apologetic if it hadn’t had so many teeth. “He was taking his time. I kept thinking about all those people, about Péter, and how he might have been…
They all clasped tightly to their treasures, holding their breath, prepared to be ran through. What was death anyway if you let go of what made life worth living? Bucky grinned slightly at the morbid thought. You could dress a Rom up, but you couldn’t make them stop being Rom.
Tony might touch his face, the way he’d so gently touched his arm earlier in the garden… might pull Steve down and kiss him. Press that sweetly smiling mouth to his like he’d been waiting his whole life for it.
Steve flung the blanket out. It opened in a wide whoosh, momentarily blocking Steve from view. He used the moment to surge forward, clumsily, intent on grabbing the weapon. But Magda reached the man first.
He supposed being the oldest girl and reminding them the most of Margrit she was acceptable to them.
“The boys were sweaty.” She said by way of explanation and Péter nodded. Knowing their cook Willamina, she would have taken one look at the haggard state of them and starting putting together enough comfort food to feed an army.
"I'll go down to distract guests if you help Tony wrangle James," Natacha suggested to Péter and then to Ian, "You go and get Artur and Maria. Tell Artur he and Maria will miss Uncle Bucky coming back if they don’t start behaving. That ought to convince him."
“There you go sparrow.” Willamina appeared beside him with a mug of warmed cider and Ian accepted it gratefully with a smile. The tangy flavor washed over his tongue as the scents of cinnamon and nutmeg tickled his nose. Willamina’s cider had always been his favorite but it was especially good with her spiced rum. When his Ma had been alive she used to let him sit on her lap and sip from her cup, but now he was big enough to have a cup of his own.
As if he had heard Steve’s thoughts, Tony sighed, lowering the crust of bread he had barely taken more than a bite from and pinned Steve with a familiar look of exasperation.
“He is not German and he has lost his home and half his family. How warm would you be Grig?” Tony shot back at the other man, who shrugged his broad shoulders. Grigur Carboni was a handsome man, blessed with his maternal grandmother’s fair hair, and his father’s warm brown eyes. It was disconcerting how comforting
Natacha swatted Péter away and took another sip of her drink. Snuggled comfortably next to Péter she flipped the pages off her magazine and for a time they sat in silence.
A solid strategy only foiled by how distasteful he found the idea. What good would he be to a wife? If by some miracle he survived the war he could hardly imagine what happiness he would bring her chained to half a man with half a mind who couldn’t love her, forced to live under the shadow of his shame.
"Captain Rogers. If there is still some confusion over my loyalties I would be happy to restate my case."
"I think it is an excellent idea to hold the concert here. People are shaken true enough, but that just means they need it now more than ever. Christmas is a time when people should come together is it not?" he asked the table, receiving several nods, none more eager than little Maria's. Tony didn’t look at him but Stefen could see it in the tension around his mouth. He was thinking that having the winter concert here would draw a crowd big enough to fill the ballroom and provide Coulson ample cover.
“I thought you said this was urgent?” Kirk asked after Hedy had left once more and Bucky sneered at him. He gestured toward Kirk’s companion who was sitting at the bar, making no secret of watching them.
Uncle Bucky went straight away to father's office. Ian could hear the door slam even from down the hall. He could hear his father speaking, his voice gone brittle and clipped as he tried to explain again to James, who’d latched onto his arm, why he was leaving.
It was clear by the plainness of her clothes and the rough twang in her speech that she did not come from a family of means like they did, which Johann spent most the afternoon sneering not so subtly about, but she gave as good as she got and didn’t seem to think highly of his intelligence.  Harry seemed to find her and her antics with Johann humorous but Péter wondered if that wasn’t just because Gwen looked very pretty that day and was allowing him to hold her hand.
He heard Natacha murmur to Péter, “Isn’t that Robert and Johann?” and Tony realized that these boys were two of the same ones they’d spotted earlier on their way in. Swallowing past the tightness gripping his throat Tony pushed forward, urging the children silently on
Once Tony and Harold had managed to get the children and their trunks unloaded and a bell hop had come to assist them with their luggage they’d been met by a Herr Shultz in the lobby, who had seemed amused by the children’s gasps of awe at all the gleaming marble and the grand staircase spilling out into the center of the floor like the very stairway to heaven, rails a brilliant shining gold.
“We are engineering boats, steam powered boats.” Stark explained, though it was no real explanation at all. “And not to worry Captain, the crew has been warned to only use the steam power in controlled settings such as the bathtub, as unfortunately the steering will be limited.”
Ian didn’t want to... he didn’t want to expose himself in front of these people, but he didn’t know what they would do if he didn’t. Hurt him, chase him away... kill him? They could. There was no one who would stop them if they wanted to. They could kill him so easily and no one would ever know.
The screaming woke him first. Steve wasn't sure if that was a bad sign or not. Usually it was the cold that gripped his lungs and forced his eyes open with sharp fingers. Artificial light flicked through his cell bars from the hall, illuminating the marked walls of his cell. Other prisoners, other days spent endlessly waiting for interrogation, execution or freedom. All were granted on a whim, or so it seemed.
As the talk dissolved into Lila Boehringer’s assets Steve felt his interest in the conversation slipping. Why couldn’t he be more like Bucky, and put the stress and the worry neatly away, meeting the world with a confidant smile that women would flock to and other men admire? Why weren’t a pretty young woman’s plump body parts enough to soothe away all of his worries? Even with Margrit he’d never been able to lose himself completely in the softness of someone elses flesh. His demons always seemed to follow him wherever he went.
He had a hunch they’d really meant it for Bucky, who was rushing toward black out drunk with a dopey grin smeared across his face. Turning in was the last thing Steve wanted to do but Bucky had been vocal enough about Steve's irregular sleeping habits in the past that he was hesitant to prove him right now.
"Well, considering I'm taking care of the people you are the king of and this concerns everyone in the room, maybe It would go better if you didn't complain and finish this quickly so that Bruce gets his rest"
Ned and Peter both felt awkward when the other interns, or in some cases employees act like they need to be shown that they're respected. MJ took to it well enough, but even after a year Ned still gets antsy if people talk to him like he's a boss.
The boy in question froze.  "Wait..... really? I can talk openly about you guys now?" he asks in wonder.
Peggy frowned she didn't know robots could be this advanced, or swear for that matter, but then the rest of them looked towards her and her eyebrows shot up.
"You know, you're probably the only one who'd end up with your problems kid." Clint shook his head, "Well gotta get going, I'm gonna have a meet up with Nat." He paused then glanced at Flash before turning to him again, "Don't think the paternal units aren't going to here about this."
It was all aunt Natasha and aunt Pepper's fault. Really, Peter has had his fair share of messing things up in his life and he is considered one of the troublemakers in the family (never mind that every single person in his family is a troublemaker in one way or another)
So, here she was without her friends and going towards a trip even her prents were prohibited to tell her from where. From the looks she got in the morning, she wasn’t going to like it.
"WHAT THE FUCK PARKER?!?!" Flash screamed. That seemed to snap his attention towards the group standing at the training room entrance. The boy's eyes bugged out.
"Well, don't you need a crapton of snacks anyway?" Tony says and Peter grinned, his father got like this when he was really close to finishing a project, he most likely is finishing one now, which means extra time with him when he does.
Peter could feel everyone turn their eyes towards him, well, since they probably would gather enough crap on him anyway,
"Well, that's well and all but it'd be pretty awkward if the future head of R&D of Stark industries and mine and Steve's sole heir lives on the streets though." Tony says with a pleasant tone, but if Ned squints, he could see a vein pound on the side of Tony's head.
East-West high was a fine example of American education system. Or well, the heavily embellished media version of it. There are 'jocks' who are dating 'cheerleaders' and bullying 'nerds' and asking for lunch money. Fucking Cliché is what it should have been called but some old dead fuck decided on East-West.
"Absolutely. Remember your no kill streak? Mr. Rogers-Stark says that he wont let you in the tower if you break it. And well, Peter would miss you man." Ned shrugged. He was spouting a great load of bullshit, but he figures Peter would forgive him for that.
" Hello, we're here for the tour from Midtown high?" He prompted as the young woman looked up from her computer with a marketing smile.
The avengers that are present didn't make much fanfare of it after that. As soon as Wade came back the class was excused to be bearded towards the food court. The glasses and year plugs did marvels for his headache. He kissed Wades mask covered cheeks. And if he heard one of his classmates mumble "holy shit he looks hot in glasses" just before he plugged his ears, well... He chose to graciously ignore that comment.
He's strong. Or at least the Hulk is. The two of them are a mesmerizing process of hiding raw power in such a delicate looking person and it leaves Thor breathless sometimes.
"Some things just has to be said" then she threw a glare at Peter to assure him he crush on Shuri did not fall in that category.
"Your crush on Peter......  I Don't think It's gonna go anywhere." Flash reeled back, he didnt think he was that obvious.
Peter let out a breath before taking a hold of Mr. Yelli's hand yanking him forward and taking the gun from him. He fell to the ground face first.
Secondly,  weren’t you supposed to be a playboy? I'm pretty sure you have lines better than that."  he types in and pushes the formula through for simulation.
"Mr. Parker, I must insist that you leave the premises immediately, you were not allowed on the field trip and should not be here." Mr. Tritter said and proceeded to walk towards Peter to deliver what was likely to be a very stern lecture.
"BABY BOY!!" Wade jumps for him and tackles him into a hug. Tony, to his credit lowers the gauntlets when Peter gets in the hit zone and grumbles about sons with terrible choice in romantic partner.
When the group got down from the bus Peter Was actively panicking, with Ned trying to provide comfort (which didn't help nearly as much as it should have helped) as the rest of the class looked on at awe at the Avengers Tower. Even MJ looked awed, for a moment then she caught herself, and went back to ignoring everyone by looking at her book.
Ned rolled his eyes, alright dude, he got it after the first ten time, they had to behave wherever they're going.
"Mr. Wilson, pay attention if you don't want to fail. Circuits are hard enough when you do pay attention" Mr. Jean-Jaques  huffs at him like he's not learning the entire syllabus from his boyfriend anyway. Study dates are fun.
"Hello children of Midtown high" Natasha welcomed, and nobody seemed to be offended, but then again it is entirely possible that they were too starstruck to actually hear what she told them.
"Tony look at me, I get turned into a giant rage monster when my heart beat elevates. You know how dangerous that is why the heck would he go for me. " Bruce says and left his cup on the table between them.
"Wait your turn нарушитель спокойствия" Natasha says lowly playing with her knife. (Google said it meant troublemaker. But if it's wrong, can some one who speaks Russian help me out?)
"There are a lot of people? And I think this event's one of the big ones so they need more time in organising. " Steve says as he immediately grabs Thor in a chokehold.
He laughed at Tony's exaggerated pout. Laughing came easier knowing He would be at Italy when he makes Howard Flatline.
"Wha- excuse - Mom??!! Why am I mom? How am I conceivabley mom? I'm vodka aunt, or at the very least weird uncle since I quit drinking" Tony looked high key faux offended.
"I could be a squad Leader!” Péter groused and Steve ground to a halt. There was an unfamiliar challenge gleaming in Péter's eyes, but the defiant set of his jaw was all too easy to recognize.
Slowly Magda tore her eyes away from the injured man and looked back at her sister. “We’ll get...we’ll get some blankets and then we will call the police.”
“No.” Steve answered tersely, anger simmering deep in his chest. There were a lot of things he would have gladly said to Captain Altera in that moment, but he bit his tongue. “He says after Pisani came out of the pub, that he was approached by a woman.”
“Nonsense. There’s no age requirement for a scientific mind Péter” Tony's response might have come a bit too boisterous (judging by the anxious way Maria jumped in her seat) but he couldn't help the grin that was spreading over his face. “Perfect, Peter!”
Tony, leaning against the side of the pen, laughing as if the question were stupid. Eyes narrowing on Steve now, accusing.
“Have lunch delivered to Herr Stark’s room.” Eyes still on Tony he added with a mischievous twinkle, “She’s not to leave until you’ve eaten every bite and I’d not like to be you if you hold up Virginia’s head house maid from her regular duties.”
If anything happened...Steve let out a little moan. If anything happened to them, he’d... He moved his hand over the older bruises on his forearm, squeezing until the pain sliced through his thoughts.
Benjamino had said that night in December, Tony, Stefen, the Rabbi and the men of Tony’s family clustered around the little table in the back of the kitchen.
He looked young, standing there with his cheeks red, dwarfed by the heavy blanket and still in the robes of a novice.  It didn't help that for the first time he looked uncertain, as if he were contemplating leaping out of the boat after Tony and shouting he was just kidding about continuing toward the waiting ship.
“Hard to keep track when you have fifteen of them.” Kroger chuckled, the tension easing a little in his shoulders. “Isn’t that the way daughters are? One minute they’re in white dresses and sashes, the next you’ve blinked and she’s picking out rings and telling you about the state of the Reich.”
At Baroness Shrader's instruction the housekeeper had led them upstairs to the Major's room. She'd opened the door and Dvorak knew instantly that he’d made a gross miscalculation. Rogers was every bit as sick as had been reported.
"I know this fools limits better than he does, Stark." Bucky replied with a roll of his eyes, taking a bite out of the end of his licorice. "If he looks like somethin’ the cat dragged in its cause I'm pushin him. We don't have time to be skirts about this."
“Germany? Germany?!” an incensed voice called from the mouth of the now open bedroom door. Steve’s old comrade Lucan Parodi fisted his hands at his sides and glared out at Zimmerman.
She waved at Natacha and Steve slowed, gritting his teeth, scrutinizing the stranger in their midst carefully while he weighed his options. It was just a child but that didn’t mean she could be trusted. Who was she? Steve wondered. Who were her parents? What had Natacha told her?
“Ah, there we are.” She murmured a moment later, withdrawing with a clean sheath of paper and envelope in hand. Turning she flashed triumphant smile. “A house this large you’d think it would be easier to find good paper.”
Steve was unusually quiet even for Steve as they ventured into town. There was a storm in his head again, and he carried a tension with him as he walked that was at odds with the beautiful crisp October day.  Even when they got to Lou’s repair shop and got a good look at Péter’s gift – an old camera that had belonged to Peggy that had been growing dust in the attic – he didn’t seem quite there to Bucky, his thoughts miles away and some demon dogging his tail.
And she was wrong about Stefen, wrong about the children. Wasn’t she? Or was he just like her, hanging onto his hopes waiting on some miraculous sign that would vindicate his faith and show him all would be well?
Steve slumped against the door like a puppet with cut strings. He braced a hand against the wood to hold himself up. Tony was here. But he wasn’t safe. Not yet. Grinding his teeth together Steve pushed himself back up.
There was no understanding the rush of nostalgia for those days unless one had lived them. Back when it was him, the other boys, and the goulash rat who had found himself in their midst. No one knew what the next day would bring, but everyone knew their place, who they were and where they had to go. How to survive together.
“I must take it for myself. But the trouble is fear. I’m afraid to go and afraid to stay and afraid either way that I’m too addled to know which way is up. I don’t know whether I want a quiet life with a family I’m proud to call mine, or if I want simply to be left alone to create something that will stop an army. Something that would make even ‘His Excellency’ tremble at the idea of considering any alternative but peace, or risk the war that ends all wars. Sometimes I even think I could really do it, if given half an opportunity. It’s a hunger inside of me I can’t stifle and I can’t sleep for the fear that eats at me, telling me to get up and do something for all our sakes.”
Tony nodded, saying nothing, thinking that was the first time he’d ever heard Natacha voluntarily speak on their mother.
He could not allow Péter to go to public school and had never intended to allow it. Especially not now that Schmidt was closing in and Steve was scrambling to come up with some new way to keep Péter out of the General's hands; but of course Tony had not liked to hear his protests, going on about how smart the boy was (as if Steve did not know).
Tony jumped as a door to the music room slammed shut and a tiny girl ran out, scuttling into line with her siblings. Captain Rogers frowned at her as she took her place. Where had she come from? The music room had been empty while he was in there. Apparently not.
“You’re really not,” Tony snapped, finally lifted his head. It felt like he was lifting bricks. “Sit down.”
"Herr Stark. How wonderful it is to finally meet you. I saw the show you did in Munich. I must say, what you’ve done with your pupils is quite marvelous. They were simply sublime.”
“No thank you, Kurt. Forgive James his crass nature. I'd say he was raised in a barn but you know that already.”
Tony finished with a shrug, as if the admission didn’t hurt, as if there was no old wound in danger of seeping with every poke and prod. He bit his lip, fingers clenching around the pen, wondering why he’d even brought it up in the first place. What possessed him to tell Stefen something like that?
He heard the sound of rushing footsteps and a moment later Luzzato came through the damaged door, the expression on his face silencing the entire room but for the crying of the small boy.
The headlights from the town car flickered as Harold eased his way out of the garage. From the window Tony could see the way the light flared and then faded as it spilled across the wall of Stefen’s bedroom. A hazy glow, casting tall wavering shadows that reminded him of when he was small and he liked to watch the way the shadows danced after his Nonno lit his candle set.
“Meanwhile I’m practically Olympic gold at your disposal, Ian really. Have I taught you nothing about being an opportunist?”
Steve could tell the moment they arrived at the inn that he was not going to get the quiet night he’d been yearning for all evening. Bucky was sitting on the front steps, back from his travels and his face was telling Steve that he had news.
Fire flashed through the Warden’s eyes and he opened his mouth – but at that moment, a harsh siren began to wail outside the single window, echoing like a distant shriek throughout the camp.
“Yes he seemed a very capable sort. I’m sorry he did not stay longer. Is he really Hughard Stark’s son? How delightfully curious. He must have been very young when he chose the cloth, for no one to have heard a peep about him in all this time. A strange choice for the heir to a fortune.” Frauline Werner hummed thoughtfully.
When his breathing had mostly steadied and he felt he could, Tony straightened, and Bucky let his hand fall, returning it to the steering wheel. He had to be stronger than this. They were lucky they hadn’t gone off the road.
Which was what made it easy for Péter to make his way unquestioned. His uniform made him an authority.
“What does Karachonya mean?” James asked looking curiously between the two of them, licking his fingers free of dark jam. Stefen tilted his head in consideration before he replied.
Perhaps it wasn’t acceptable by any true moral standards. But war had a way of making sure it didn’t matter.
“Master Ian,” She greeted him fondly already turning toward the cupboard as she said, “I bet I know what you want. I put the cider away this morning, but it won’t take long to warm up. I’ll even add a dollop of my spiced rum if you’d be kind enough to fetch more wood from the pile. I don’t know where Hortense has gotten off to. Probably off somewhere gossiping with Julia.”
The atmosphere intensified as their vessel drew closer to the dock and the man waiting there. As Bucky slowed them down and they pulled adjacent to it, Bruce cleared his throat. Brother Simone stared back at him, widening his eyes at the discovery of the boats other occupants.
“Power. Glory. Infamy.” Tony ticked them off on his fingers with a smile. “You want to wipe away my father’s legacy and replace it with your own. I’ll help you. I will write down the exact composition of the metal
He drifted in and out after that, running from night terrors until finally, blessedly, he sank into unconsciousness. Just before his eyes closed the final time he caught sight of a figure sitting at his desk table watching him, the dim light shifting on red braids.
He was holding Tony too tightly, though Tony didn’t protest. He did jerk back with a hiss of pain when Steve shifted, inadvertently rolling his forehead against the swollen tissue around his cut.
Damn it! It was locked, its deadbolt clicking angrily as Steve’s weight beat against it. He twisted, looking around the room and yes, there, a window. It was high up, only really meant to bring in some light and a bit of decoration to the small area. It would have to do, he thought as he snatched up a boom laying discarded in corner.
Tony strode the rest of the way across the room and thrust the journal toward Steve and Steve stared down at where it pressed against his chest, jaw ticking. He was tempted to slap the damn thing away and grab Tony by his lapels. Tony was standing so close Steve could smell the wine on his breath as well as feel his body heat. If Steve kissed him now he bet he could make Tony go weak at the knees again. The bed was right there, and once he had Tony in it, the reckless fool wouldn’t be able to talk anymore.
“I’ll help Tony pull you up,” he decided firmly before Steve could finish reassuring him.  Steve doubted they would be able to, had known it was a possibility the moment he’d spotted the window, but he simply nodded and hoisted Ian up by the waist until he could reach the sill and Tony could get a grip on him. Ian squeezed through the opening in one fluid motion of pale limbs and disappeared from view. Tony repapered a moment later.
A gust of wind chilled the exposed areas of his skin and he brought his arms around his chest and closer to his body for warmth.
Ha! Well of course Steve hadn’t told him. Bucky would have told Stefen were the fuck to go had he bothered to reveal this beforehand. Christ! Bucky should have known.
Tony was leaning into Stefen’s space and for one reason or another the captain hadn’t moved. They were standing close enough for Tony to feel the puff of his breath against the skin of his cheeks and suddenly he had to fight down a blush of his own.
“What if I told you one of our operatives had managed to steal the Führer’s strategy book.” He asked slowly, waiting silently as the words sank in. It was so quiet within the room you could have heard a pin drop.
Péter sniffed wetly and buried his face against his arms, glad for a moment that he was alone and nobody could see him. They were all wrong. In a minute he was going to get up and go back down the hall to his father's room, because if his father was going to die then he was going to be there. He was going to get to say goodbye this time.
One. Two. Natacha and Ian were visible by the floor to ceiling windows and overstuffed chairs, mingling with Emile and a group of other children.
She held Tony’s stare, only looking away when the girl who always sat beside her, kicked her under the table. Caterina shook her head, the bow in her hair which had been perfect that morning, but was now unraveling, flopping around her ears. She had a bad habit of swirling the ends of her ribbons around her fingers when she was bored and pulling them loose.
“Shall I still set a separate table for the staff in here Captain?” The cook asked, shooting a quick glance at Charlotte. Stefen grit his teeth.
"I just got off the phone with Jann, she's heard from Susann." Bucky announced as soon as they were cloistered in the privacy of Steve's room and Steve's breath hitched.
Tony knew orders when he heard them. He nodded and the housekeeper left him with a swirl of skirts, her smart heels clicking on the floor.
Magda’s eyes were wide with horror, but it was the man beside her who held Steve’s gaze, the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face. Steve knew that look. He’d seen it thousands of times from men who killed and didn't want to kill but did it anyway. They never looked at the target in the face.
“Is she… I mean will she be alright?” Stefen asked in a hushed tone, tense as if he feared the girl might explode and Tony rolled his eyes.
As the hour grew later and later most of the plates had similarly emptied, but Tony noticed that Bucky’s remained largely untouched. Tony watched him get up from the table and fetch an empty bowl from the cupboard and surreptitiously fill it from the food left on his plate. He went and set the little bowl on the window sill that looked out into the back garden. He stood there staring out into the snow for a long drawn out moment, that made Tony feel as if he wasn’t there in the room with them any longer but somewhere far away. When Bucky finally moved away from the window, he caught Tony staring at him and raised his ever-full mug of wine in mock salute.
The thought didn’t sit well. But then again, Tony thought as he glanced out over the double row of small heads bent over their notebooks. Rogers had entrusted him already with far more. Perhaps it was as simple as that.
Steve pulled back, the barest inch, and Tony took a deep shaky breath, visibly fighting back the sudden prick of tears. Steve held him, cradling his head, sinking his hands into his soft dark hair and rubbing his scalp.
His three-year-old knew better than to make a mess while she ate… or draw more attention to herself than was necessary, because her father found it hard to hear her whines or her cries… or sometimes even to look at her.
Hammer jerked at the unexpected sound of Steve’s voice, but pretended as if he hadn’t. He made a point of finishing the place setting he was working on, even as Virginia and Julia both paused to great him with brief respectful nods. When he was satisfied with his work the butler finally turned to look at him.
We really hope you enjoyed this installment and hope you'll tell us what you think. So much going on! This is an Avengers story, remember we promised that? BWAHAHA well, this is the part where singing nuns and prancing children meet Avengers levels of drama and angst I'm afraid, so buckle up gang! Thoughts? Worries? Questions, predictions? You know I love to hear them all.
“Good.” Coulson said, a wealth of meaning in the utterance as he rose from his chair. Tony had the unsettling impression that the man had read his mind. “I’m taking a new assignment, so regrettably the party is the last time we’ll see each other. I don’t imagine we’ll get a chance to talk on the day so I’ll say my goodbyes now.”
of him, just so. Tony blinked before smiling back at him, unusually shy. A little color had returned to his cheeks.
If anyone came in that wasn't the woman...If he woke up screaming...if she or her sister suddenly decided it wasn't worth it to keep a wanted man in their care. If she decided he was healed enough and called the police before he got away…If he managed to make it to the cabin and the children weren't there... oh god.
"Tony," Stefen said his name again, even gentler and reached slowly for his hands. This time Tony didn't make any move to stop him.
Word spread quickly that Major Rogers, local hero and national icon, was being accused of treason. It dominated every broadcast and Tony didn’t doubt that outside the walls of the villa it dominated the conversation in every living room as the public waited for more details to emerge. The police had combed through the house following Stefen’s extraction. Tony knew that Stefen did not keep much physical evidence of his involvement in the resistance, but it was impossible to get rid of everything. There was the radio in the attic for starters.
“All over Salzburg” the mayor confirmed in a weak, defeated tone, and Steve cursed, unclenching his grip on the window sill. He glanced at the clock and cursed again. The children where likely still at their rehearsal. They might have wrapped up early, might even now be safely on their way home but Steve couldn’t take the chance.
“You were always the one to bite the hand that fed you. Like a little rat.” The general crossed his legs, one booted heel over the other with a sharp clink.
Steve pushes back into him instinctively and Tony murmurs something soft and maybe obscene. It is hard for Steve to focus over the burning sensation overtaking his body. Just like that day in Berlin. It’s strange to know that he is dreaming even as he dreams. It is dawn somewhere out there. He didn’t have to open his eyes to know, could feel it in his bones, but he didn’t want to open them anyway. He wanted to stay there in the room with Tony just a while longer.
James flinched, his small slightly round face clouding with shame that quickly gave way to temper. Thankfully Pepper intervened, clapping her hands together lightly and gesturing rapidly for the children to gather their things.
It was the way that Bucky spat the word gestapo, with such raw ache behind it, that finally convinced Tony that for once, it was better to do as he was told.
That guilt, and the fact that May and her husband had neither the space nor the means to care for seven children were big reasons Steve had never considered sending the children to her.
When she acted, it was with purpose. When she powdered her hair to disguise it, it was with purpose. She’d kept a man’s name alive even when he himself barely seemed to recall it, and now the purpose seemed painfully obvious it was a wonder they had all missed it. His heart ached for her. First love no matter how impossible was precious. To have it end this way was cruel. He couldn’t help but think of the last time he’d seen Rhodey, boarding a ship that would take him to the warfront. Tony didn’t know where he was or if he even lived.
“Calling the Gestapo is the only thing that will save us now!” Franz was saying. Steve kept the pair in the corner of his eye as he continued his slow search, trying not to draw their attention. And there! There it was. The rifle, resting on a small mound of hay, partially buried where Patroche had kicked some over it in his distress.
“Because he’s a traitor!” Franz jabbed her roughly in the stomach, pulling away as her grip slackened. But she was quick thinking, and quicker on her feet as she threw herself against the door and spread her arms out to black his reaching hands, her chest heaving from exertion.
Steve meandered over to his dresser, adjusting his suspenders and leaning over too look in the mirror. The room had been put back, every last surface immaculate, scrubbed clean of the night before.
“What a face. Are they not to your liking?” Charlotte murmured beside him, drawing Tony’s glare. She was staring at him with a glint of amusement in her deceptively soft blue eyes, and not for the first time Tony felt an intense stab of dislike for the woman.
“Children! Good morn and good traveling to you all.” Bucky greeted the table as he entered the dining room. The children echoed a chorus of hellos between bites of their- was that müesli? Praise the gods! Müesli, sausage and ham, three plates of fruit and of course coffee specifically made. He might marry Williamina, never mind the fact she was fifteen years his senior.
“I was walking in the garden and got caught in the storm,” the boy explained through chattering teeth. His skinny frame was practically vibrating with chills and Tony immediately thought of his heart condition.
The girl nodded eagerly and snatched the coins so fast from Tony’s extended hand Steve felt a whisper of an urge. He thought it was the sort of thing he would have smiled at once, so he made the gesture.
Tony didn’t know what he found more alarming at first, the rapid succession in which the late Mrs. Rogers appeared to have bred them all (god rest her poor saintly soul) or the completely assured and serious manner in which Ian had just announced he was due a grim fate (as if nothing had ever been more certain). Tony decided on the latter.
The child was nodding emphatically as another round of thunder boomed. Tony was just extending a hand toward her when she squealed with fright and dove toward him like a missile. Quite without knowing how Tony found himself with an arm full of terrified little girl, Maria’s slight form trembling against his as she buried her face against him. Tony had looked up to call Péter for help, hoping the child’s brother would have some idea of how to handle this, when he noticed that now Natacha was standing in the doorway with little Sara in her arms. The toddler’s face was red and blotchy with tears.
Ian eyed his father’s jacket lying over the dresser as if it were going to take life in the mirror's reflection. He straightened up and checked himself in the mirror again, smoothing his dress blouse meticulously, for the fifth time. It was perfect. Which was good. They needed to be perfect today.
“His excellency doesn’t give a ripe shit about the Germans in the borderlands. It’s the Czech army, their cannon factories and iron mines. That’s what’s he’s got his eye on, you twat!” Kroger spat.
“Finding trouble.” She winked at him and when his face flushed hot once more she rolled her shoulders and leaned forward, like she was about to whisper something intimately into his ear. “You were easy. There’s a show going on but you were looking at the stars, wanting to be anywhere but where you are.”
"I don't pretend to know anything, least of all what your agenda is, Stark!" Steve turned to snarl in reply, the sense of numb calm that he’d previously felt going up in flames. Tony flinched and lowered his gaze and Steve hated the guilt that wriggled in his gut as a result. Tony swallowed and cleared his throat.
Maria Rogers stood in the middle of the room, shivering in her pale blue night gown with a stuffed toy clutched desperately to her chest.
Christ. What was he complaining about really? Forced to simple sit with his daughter in his lap and already his skin was crawling. If Stark would just let him row he would have something to do, a purpose to fulfil.
In a perfect world scarlet fever wouldn't have killed her mother and there would be no such thing as Nazis. There would have still been music and dancing and Natasha would have continued to beat all the boys at their own games. She'd turn eighteen and fight with her parents about her scandalous hopes of becoming a dancer and running off with a real slick musician a good decade older than her.Peggy would try and talk sense into her (because she's a lame mom who just can't understand what it's like to want to follow your own path according to Natasha's infinite teenaged wisdom) while Steve was still trying to scrape his exploded brain off the walls and find a shot gun; and of course Bucky kept the guns well out of reach and his body a safe distance until Steve had enough time to mellow and think about this logically.
The words poured from him before he had a chance to push them back in, slot them back into the folds of himself where they belonged. He wanted to choke them back but what would be the point? It was just a fact. It shouldn’t be so terrifying.
. We’d nearly died a dozen times by then, and we thought we lost Bucky. When da told us that MI9 was going to find us safe houses we knew it was for the best and got on with it.
Péter made it out of the dining room and out through the kitchen door without much notice – minus a wink from Sam the gardener as he scurried past him and the chatting cook- and breathed a sigh of relief once he’d slipped out into the muggy night air. Though wind from the lake brought cooler temperatures, and the onset of burgeoning clouds, the summer night was warm as Péter hurried through the gardens toward the spot by the lake where he knew Harry would be waiting.
“James!” She called with a wave. He waved back to her, grinning around the cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth. With his hair slicked back and still dressed for work she thought he looked just like Clark Gabel, only better because she knew how he liked to joke, and what made him laugh. He was still a mystery in some ways but a good one. That she was sure of. She liked being sure of something.
would happen?” Péter sneered, suddenly irritated with her presence and all her stupid page turning. “He’s a monk, Tacha, not a seer and you wanted to go into town as much as anyone!”
Péter saw red and had to clench his fists tightly and bite his lip not to take a swing at the man. Turning to the rest of their squad Bannführer Lehmann began to give a familiar speech.
When Tony entered, Steve looked up from where he and Péter were hammering plugs into the floor. Tony was glad to see that the others had been able to follow his instructions and muck through well enough without him. Even James was holding down a plank, leaning into it with all his body weight, trying to keep water from seeping between the boards while Ian hammered in nails with a pot. Tony shot them a reassuring smile before his attention was caught by Natacha, who had obviously found the chests with the emergency supplies. She waved a heavy iron and brass pump in her hand, the long stretchy hose line coiled in the other, her eyebrows quirked upward in question.
A few yards away Péter and Artur had paused to watch fearfully and even though he couldn’t pause to look he just knew the captain and Bakhuizen had come running.
“Yes. I don’t know what it is about you and your father that you think you have to throw yourself in front of the guns because you’ve been given a few blessings here or there, but you’re fourteen. You’ve your whole life ahead to worry and sacrifice.”
“Dr. Leshnerr and Dr. Richter are good men.” Bruce explained simply and some of the tension in Tony’s shoulders eased. They had everyone they needed. All they were waiting for was -
His naval uniform traded in for plain clothes and his cap pulled down low over his eyes, he was just one of many indistinct laborers. Tony had joined their ranks in the early hours of morning, the Forman barely looking at the papers Scott had secured him before barking instructions for Tony to join the water rotation. The back of the truck had been loaded high with water barrels and the day had begun, an endless cycle of back and forth, watering the poor wretches they had digging the trenches for track in the frozen ground.
When Steve failed to muster up some sort of reply to whatever it was he was nattering on about Artur clutched his leg with even more force and turned large pleading eyes on him.
“And doesn’t the Book say, ‘when a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt’?” Nonno added. The tension in the room began to ease as the rest of Tony’s family began to smile and nod their agreement. Ian smiled back at Tony’s uncle and resumed eating. Steve could not let himself relax, his focus returning to the danger at hand. Antonia thankfully was thinking along the same lines, musing, “There have been roundups on the peninsula, but none here. Why now?”
“I’ve been here the entire time.” Charlotte had gone to speak to Captain Pavlovic’s wife about...something or another, and had left him to mingle on his own.
He admonished himself. One thing was clear. The most important job he had in this moment was not punishing Natacha but preparing her.  Tony must make sure the children had everything they needed to face whatever the future held for them, and Natacha had undressed wounds. Of
Beside him Stefen released a frustrated breath, his hands clenching tightly on the table.  “This isn’t a game, Tony!”
“My name is, Aleksy I am Poland.” Aleksy still spoke hesitantly, as if she were frightened the words would do something that she didn’t want them to. Tony smiled encouragingly at her, holding her eyes. He pitched his voice to be sure the rest of the class heard as well. “Very good pronunciation but remember your prepositions.”
“We can be very persuasive Herr Stark,” Neuman threatened with an ice in his tone and Tony fought back a shiver, not needing to be told all the ways they might use to persuade him to build for them.
“Stark I’ve worked in the factories.” Stefen replied with a grim sigh, but he was sitting forward in his chair leaning toward Tony now, rebuttal practically leaping off his tongue which was all that Tony could really ask for even if they were in disagreement. “I’ve seen their conditions. We can’t keep allowing the wealthy to horde gains and squandering the rest. It’s a recipe for disaster every time.”
For a few heart pounding moments as Tony adjusted the dials all he heard was dead air and an occasional burst of static as he searched for the right channel.
Who she wanted to fight was harder to distinguish as the threats multiplied and the faces of her enemies melded together with friends and her own reflection. She wanted to fight them all. Everyone and anything that threatened her and her family.
They’d left Steve alone locked in a cold dirty room with only his thoughts for comfort. But his thoughts were far from comforting. His body – whatever they’d left him with after the beating – was a mess but his mind was worse.  All those weeks of pills and drugs, surgeries and tests had left his mind as scarred as a war zone and just as upheaveled.
“We heard the maid Bergita saying that it’s good we’re all going to Vienna because Father’s always working, and she’s right Tony. I helped Maria squeeze her teddy in his suitcase and there was nothing fun in there.” Arturbabbled, only pausing briefly to bend over when a brightly painted block fell from his arms and clattered to the floor. “Do you think he likes blocks?”
"The Christ child knows your father hasn't been well James. She won't skip you." Charlotte tried to sooth his rumpled feathers. Tony leaned toward Virginia who was plucking another roll from the tray in front of her and faux whispered loud enough for the entire table to hear, "We’re referring to the pretty woman with long blond hair and wings yes? I haven’t seen her around Pep have you? "
"Alright, I'll spar with Bucky first, then.... Peter and Clint and Sam will be testing out Peter's reflexes again with NON lethal arrows.  and then....." Steve finished listing off sparring partners.
"Not at all, let the kids have some fun and meet the Avengers! " he says as he waved the starstruck class in.
He doesn't mean to push his friends away, but he should be able to do this himself. He's Spiderman for crying out loud. he should be able to handle one transphobe of a teacher. He lifted an entire building, why is this harder?
"Ned has most definitely shown capability when it comes to coding, and I like working with him, so why not?" he shrugged.
"You know I can help you with that? If you can't put the moves on them, I'd make a great wingman~ " Tony cajoled.
The rest of the meet and greet went somewhat smoothly. Flash didn't make a single peep, Ned and MJ stayed back saying that they have work to do, but really they're just getting some stuff done while Peter sleeps so they could hang out when he wakes.
"Au contrare, I'm but a humble guardian. The judges are gonna be from outside sources so no one can accuse you of nepotism "
:this mission actually sucks. I'm gonna head straight to the tower the moment i get back in NY to see your beautiful face.
"I am the God of mischief. Who do you take me for? There is thousands of years worth of blackmail I have on him. " Loki says with a cocky smile.
They sort of move to a corner and huddle as much as a no homo strictly homophobic bro and oh mah gawd get away from me losers teenagers can huddle. Wade, who has been shoved in the cornerist of the corner daydreams about his usual brand of babyboy.
"Isn't Mary a little too advanced to be the project of a science fair?" Tony asks as he lazyly observes Peter writing  cards about his Robot.
But of course no one could actually know that he got adopted by Iron-man and Captain America, at least not yet, until Pepper handled the press.
The angelic smile turned to a smirk, "I know what you seek human, you wish for prosperity. Did you never hear that you shouldn't make a deal with the devil?"
Just as he thought he was out of the woods, two arguing  voices coming towards them made Peter want to groan, why them? Why now? He almost made it out without spilling his secrets!
She has a little bit of a vendetta against his star it looks like. Some of the reports she wrote really pissed Steve off.
"Miss Jones is coming" someone yelps out and Betty is surprised by the absolute flurry of movement that passes the entire office.
"Yeah, man I get that he has a crush he's trying to get over, but why brag to us?" Ned groused leaning on his desk. Peter raised an eyebrow incredulously.
"Listen man, I don't care that you can't die, but if Peter gets hurt under your watch, I will make you dead" MJ threatened.
"Why not?  you have enough shit to deal with as it is, why not just stop him?" Natasha says in a menacing tone.
Flash had his mouth open before anyone could say anything, a man wearing a pare of metal wings dived at him. Peter dodged, the next time the man dived at him he caught the man, the class then saw an arrow fly straight at Peters heart only for him to anticipate it and dodge, the arrow hit the man who was trying to hold him down.
"And what do we have here?" an old man whit long white  beard asked genially. He had a badge that declared him as a judge. His companions had one of those too, one of the man had a shrewd look to him, dressed in all black. The other looked happy to be there, excited even. The last man had red hair and an encouraging smile that pulled Peter out of his usual mindset of stranger-anxiety-foot meet mouth
Anyway, he missed the last weekend at the tower for a mission and was missing his babyboy like some people miss an arm or a leg. Not that he would know what that feels like, but the point still stands. Luckily the field trip's the next day. A Friday. So if he asks really nicely he could probably spend the night. He wonders if he can bribe his father in law with pancakes.
“ALRIGHT BUCKLE UP WE'RE HERE-” …..why teach? “- I expect each and every one of you little shits to be on best behaviour, no yelling, no shoving, and no destruction of property.”
"Sure there is, dad's Bi, and he didn’t exactly hide it" Peter says as he comes in he goes up to the treadmill next to Nat and starts running.
She looked towards Ms. Trinket to realise the constipated look on her face for the last week was because she was trying not to grin in glee, which she was doing right now by the way. It was creepy, if she didn’t know the safety protocols of this place, she'd be terrified of being a part of the saw franchise.
"So.... You think..... Peter is.......  Selling drugs?" Steve asks slowly. Peter groans and hides his face in his hands.
"Bet you thought about it, since you lie about knowing people anyway" Flash was very unsubtly taking a dig at his "internship" (OK, fine he's not an intern. he's in training to take over his dad's job, which is a a lot level higher than an intern but Flash doesn't need to know that)
"How do you know him loser? Don't say now that you have an internship here too?" Flash mocked, and he didn't notice their tour guide's eyes flash darkly. The man recovered quickly enough.
"That's logical. No one would want a repeat of this, especially since a teacher thought he could just harass you in the middle of class. " She said thoughtfully and Ned nodded in agreement.
The students make their way to the conference hall and Peter was surprised to see that Flash isn’t in a stall. He expected the boy to show off his project since he has been bragging, but it looked like he was pretty happy to not have a project so Peter didn’t take more notice.
"Wait, I didn’t know they came looking for you, why the hell didn't you tell me you came looking for him? Are you trying to get killed?" Bob asks Mr. Yelli
When they were boarding the bus to leave, Ned couldn't keep a smile off his face, so maybe the trip wasn't so bad after all, besides his friends were there anyway, for however a small amount of time.
"I- I'm sorry " Flash stutters and practically runs like a bat out of hell from Peter. Peter frowns, what was that about.
The receptionist was not as inpressed with him as Officer Pennington was, but didn’t show it very much. She handed him the phone looking at him like he could drop it.
Tony huffed, "come on freezer pop, it's not interesting, I want to see Howard's face when he hears about the future."
It all starts when, He returned to his school after two days of excused day off, which is to say, he got so badly injured fighting doc oc, his fathers made up an excuse for him to stay home and got Natasha to call them and use her super spy skills to make the school believe that he had the flu for exactly two days.
His dad probably just wanted to arrived fashionably late, in Tony Rogers-Stark language,  it could mean after the judges enter.
There was another man who had his legs in some sort of braces. He looked more well..... mature. He sat next to a man who's face was... red and he had some sort of stone on his forehead.
Living in the avengers compound was great, he got his own lab, a father to geek out with, heck he could call Captain America  pops, not to mention the rest of the Avengers told (demanded of) him to call them aunt or uncle, he was practically living any 16 year old's dream.
"Girls?" Ms. Trinket broke in, "I'm glad to hear about the internship Ms. Brant,  congratulations on the achievement,  but we do need to get on with the tour. "
From his position on the back stage he couldn't see how many people there was but he could hear them filling in, Peter tuned out the sounds coming from the front of the stage in favour of his phone.
He grabbed the guy by his wrists and keeps pressure until he drops the chair and Peter kicks it away.
Howard was looking at an important lead when the news that some people he would want to meet came to him. he didn't want to go, but he figured might as well.
He has been pretty light since the spider bite. Tony once said he didn't weight more than a back pack. That worked well in his case because Peter was currently hugging a mercenary from the behind hanging quite like a backpack would.
‘You are being ridiculous’ he thought to himself as he followed Stefen and Bucky into the cozy little room that served as a study for the inn. It was right off the parlor, with a set of wide doors that opened out and made the whole space seem inviting and bigger than it actually was.
"Alright Lang. Go fill her up." The man replied briskly, jerking his blunt nose in the direction of the station. Tony didn't waste time wrapping up the back of the truck, doing his very best to ignore the disappointed groans of the men. His heart squeezed in his chest when he had to collect the heat lamp a group of prisoners had collected around. A few of them were just boys, barely twenty by Tony's reckoning, though it was hard to tell with their shaved heads and thinness. He was tempted to leave it with them, but it would only be taken away by one of the Gestapo, and it was a long drive up to the cabin. Tony couldn't leave the children with only damp blankets and burlap sacks to keep warm.
The woman hastily backed away from him, like he might have been carrying some disease, muttering her own quick apology as she righted the shawl that had slipped down her shoulders and hurried from the shop.
go hungry. He'd have fed Steve from his own plate, but it wouldn’t have been enough. Not for either of them.
"You'd have a hard time of it even if you wanted to." The one he thought was called Elizabeth remarked. "You look just like him."
“I want to hear about your work with the Munster orphans, Dr. Ehrhandt. It’s bound to be more thrilling than whatever our gentlemen get up to without us.” She playfully swatted at the arm she still held captive, but when her blues eyes met his they were as hard as stone.  They commanded him to behave.
“Again, I’m sorry. And as someone who always hopes to keep you from making his mistakes, I hope you will consider making up with your brother. This is all very trying on everybody and he’s not as mature as you are. It’s not always fair having to be the bigger person, but if it means being there when your brother needs you I think it may be worth it.”
The baroness served them in the garden. Her home was along the lines of what Tony had expected. Larger than what many could afford but quaint in its own way, filled with old furnishings and family heirlooms. The garden was well kept if somewhat unimaginative and Tony knew she didn’t spend any great deal of thought on it, leaving it to some likely overpaid Gardner.
“I’m their father. I need to know when things like that happen.” Tony nodded, conceding that point and Stefen finished with, “I’ll be cross if you keep something like that from me in the future.”
His beedy gaze flitted around the room like a fly before he homed in on Steve. He ran a hand through his slightly unkept hair and said hurriedly, “There you are Major. Hurry, we’ve not a moment to lose.”
Ian had decided to fuss over him it seemed, and Tony didn't have the heart to tell him he'd chosen the worst day to start. It was still hours to sundown... but oh well.
Tony could admit that, but only in the privacy of his mind in the dark of the attic while he worked. The supplies had come only a day or so after he’d returned home, and he could only cringe at what Stefen must have paid to arrange that. His mission must truly be vital then, and Tony was determined not only to meet Stefen’s expectations but to exceed them.
If he married Charlotte, a little voice reasoned, they’d have a mother and the protection of her name. They could go with her to the family estate in Switzerland and wait out the war.
To stand above the others was the honor that all the boys in the program were grappling for. The local boys in Péter's unit would all be starting secondary school in the fall but no one wanted to settle for going to the local college when they could be one of the special ones selected to go to Vienna and study at one of Hitler's elite schools.
“It’s a beautiful gift, Stefen, but you need to keep them.” Tony said quietly against his ear, squeezing his hand gently once more. When Stefen drew in a breath to protest, Tony shook his head. “I can’t take this from you-” but Stefen interjected, twisting his torso until they were eye to eye once more, and dropping the compass Tony had gifted him into his lap to catch Tony by the wrist with both hands.
"Oh fucking hell-" Bucky groaned, because he was doing it. Steve was digging his heels in and refusing to hear any sense but his own. Over
That had always been a funny concept to him, especially when "everyone" had always excluded him and his people.
“Now I’m intrigued. Is it a garter? I’ve worn one before, but I’ll admit I never expected you to partake in such delights.”
“Thank you, Captain, for the thought, truly, but I… I’m afraid I have nothing to wear.” Tony cringed at the words. He had nothing to
“Again, I must apologize for not being here to greet you when you met the children,” She began as she walked back toward him. “How did you find them?”  Tony only deliberated for half a second on how to reply, but some instinct told him that Frau Hogan would see through any pandering and would appreciate frankness much more.
He turned his weary head just enough to note that while Steve looked as wrecked as Tony felt, he wasn’t coughing or choking and didn’t appear to be in any undue amount of pain. Like Tony, he panted for breath like an old dog after a race, his eyes drooping with exhaustion.
It was still dark in the kitchen, and Péter took a moment to light the lanterns before he went to the pantry, rubbing his aching eyes as they adjusted to the light. He hadn't slept much the past few days. Truthfully, not since the night of the riots. Maybe Frau Hogan had a point about him getting some rest, but Péter knew he wouldn't be able to sleep with his father's condition so unstable.
"It's time now Darlings," the Baroness leaned forward, pausing just long enough to be sure she had all of their attention. "Quickly now. Don't forget your tags, and remember you mustn't speak to anyone and you must get off at the station in Worgl Bahnof." She looked directly at Péter as she stood from the table and Péter nodded solemnly, promising that he'd remember.
“Something’s happened to Cameron,” Hortense filled him in with an anxious whisper, eyes flickering fearfully to the backdoor.
"He'd want us alive more." Natacha shot back, giving him a hard stare. The hand she laid on his leg was soft at first, but her fingers twisted up in the fabric of his trousers. Clinging. "Péter, there are worse things than saying the things that people want to hear."
"There she goes." Richter called from the deck when the last bit of resistance suddenly gave way and nearly sent Tony and Lucas toppling.  They caught each other before they could fall over and get swept away by the current.
Steve’s hands clenched on the steering wheel in a white knuckled grip, his eyes stuck on the road and the familiar scenery. They were close now. So close to home. Steve just wanted to see the children, his eyes suddenly hungry for them, the impulse to gather them close and run away from this madness stronger than he’d ever felt it. But it was a dangerous whim. They were being watched. Schmidt would not simply just let him leave the country.
He didn’t agree with Susann, that he was a good man. He’d known better. Men who hadn’t had half his chances and who had died before they ever got even close to what they’d deserved. Then there was Steve, who got everything and didn’t deserve half of it.
“Sun makes everybody dark,” Bucky replied with a shrug. Pressing his wrist up against her arm he said, “See. I don’t let it ruin my day.”
“Tony taught us to sing that song,” one of the little girls piped up, obviously forgetting the golden rule when attending adult parties that children should do their very best to be seen and not heard. Frauline Van Dyne smiled sweetly at her however and her eyes flickered to Herr Stark who was standing beside the captain. She did not seem at all shocked to hear this child address an adult by his first name but perhaps she was just good at hiding it.
Remembering the contents of the flask, Bucky fumbled for it with one hand. He unscrewed the top with gritted teeth and swigged back a few deep swallows of the brew inside, bracing himself for the sharp taste of horseradish and pepper.
“You know what they’re saying don’t you? That the reason the execution was held off – they’re saying the Lion escaped. That is why all these police are out here looking for vagrants and runaways.”
Steve didn’t even bother trying to refute the voice inside. It was unimportant how she felt, just that she was alive.
Tony opened his mouth intending to reassure him that it was okay to be excited and that his wants and wishes weren’t going to be rejected when James surprised them all. It wasn't so much his interrupting that was the surprise but the quiet volume at which he did it.
But she believed herself to be right and on the side of the angels. How did you convince someone who believed themselves impervious to harm with the protection of God?
His breathing came harsh and scraped through his chest. He squeezed his eyes shut, gasping hard for breath through sore lungs.
“Where are your Ukrainian singers?” Tony asked Bakhuizen as a way to divert the topic, surprised that they had not woken to join the table yet. He was not expecting the odd tension that had crept into the captain’s tone as he replied.
Truthfully, the hardest part about their new circumstances wasn't the spartan comforts, or even the long hours between sun up and sundown with no freedom to move beyond the four walls of the cabin. It was the endless sense of waiting hanging over each of them. Long hours parked in front of the radio waiting for the next news update and dreading it all the while.
"I've been busy with the HJ." he mumbled, looking away when that disappointment Tony couldn't quite hide became too much.
either. What do you really know about him? Nothing, clearly, cuss he's a spy!" Bucky spat. "Christ, Steve. Focus on the plan, not on his cock-"
“I don’t have a book…” Stefen hedged and Tony rolled his eyes, grateful that the captain was preoccupied with looking at the children. Thankfully Bakhuizen wasn’t keen on letting him off the hook that easily.
“Do you want to be excused?” It wasn't a question. Steve didn't tolerate bullying among his children and Péter knew that. A hard bit of morality to install when the outside world had decided to sanction it.
“Norway is not inevitable, Stefen, it is a choice. You want to lead this mission. Do you deny that?” Tony turned to pin him with a direct stare.
“But where will you sit?” the girl asked, but not before hiding her clenched fist with the coins behind her back as if Tony might try to take them.
been doing all day? And why was his work more important than what Tony was doing?! For Stefen, no less!
“I'm only saying,” Bucky droned on in the background. “If you were going to order for just me, I drink espresso now.
Steve shuddered, closing his eyes against the image of his children trapped in the middle of that madness. Good licks gotten or otherwise.
All Dvořák’s own years of hard work had amounted to shit, when in the blink of an eye they’d just handed Rogers the title with barely any effort attached. But of course Dvořák wasn’t Austria's favored son, or Himmler's little pet, so of course he had to work for his gains.
Péter watched in amazement as slowly she dragged his finger through the dirt and etched the symbol of an oval with a dot in the center.
"They planned this. Bakhuizen was here. A distraction. They must have slipped out while I wasn't watching." Deiter voiced the realization as it came to him, a junior officer pushing passed him to collect the children's jackets from the table. Clever. They weren't as recognizable without their expensive outer garments. Captain Arnold gestured aggressively and barked for two of the men to search every inch of the establishment and two others the premises.
“Come again?” Tony blinked at the man in befuddlement. “Did I just hear you say that you want me to take a child on my treasonous mission to jail break a Nazi prison?
Step by step, he reminded himself as he diligently plodded through each moment, on hyper alert, ready at a moment’s notice for anything. His family had dressed for dinner and made their way past the sobering honor guard, lined like emotionless black beetles on either side of the stairs leading into the great hall, to mingle with the other guest before dinner. It was a ritual Steve wanted no piece of and he had dawdled as long as Charlotte would allow it, which meant the hall was already full of party guests when they arrived.
“I should help Charlotte get the children to bed. Artur and James never sleep well on Christmas Eve.” Stefen grunted as Tony eased him down onto the bed. The captain released a soft groan as his rear sank into the mattress, his sore muscles increasing the volume of their protest. He’d overdone it again. Tony had done his best to keep him from exhausting himself, but Stefen had seemed determined to be everywhere and do everything; even things he’d scarcely done before he’d taken ill.
He had never understood why his father had married his mother. He did not beat her like some husbands but he was far from a kind man. Hughard’s old friend and business partner Obadiah Stanislav had never understood it either. Though he was always courteous enough to Maria he’d also always been very forthcoming with the fact that he was against the marriage.
Because as much as Tony's continual chatter irritated him, as much as his smart talk and sarcasm could sandpaper at his soul, the evidence would suggest that he loved the sound of Antony Stark's voice.
“Why do I have to carry Artur? Why can't I help carry the supplies with Ian and Péter? I'm old enough.” James whined from behind them, not yet tired of the argument they had started a half hour ago. “I'm just as big as Ian!” he added, hobbling to gain enough speed to pull himself and Artur. His younger brother bobbed back and forth from their unsteady gait. Tony winced, seeing them spread eagle on the road in his mind's eye.
James launched off of Tony before he could finish, nearly throwing Tony backwards as he landed in the water with a great splash. He reemerged spluttering and reaching for his father who obliged by scooped him up.
God, but he could see it. A life where he was there present with his family, where his children did not always have to wonder where he was and whether or not he would return to them. Where he wasn’t in the Wehrmacht, wasn’t a soldier, didn’t have to sacrifice so much for others and could focus on the things that made him happy for once.
“You found him! He came back!” the little boy shouted excitedly, rushing up to Tony with hands extended eagerly. Tony held the habitat out of reach and made a shushing sound.
There was a long silence, then a gruff hiss of irritation followed by more steps, this time heading away from Steve. He swallowed, the itching in his throat worsening and his chest beginning to burn with the urge to cough.
A tour? Tony thought. Right in the middle of everything? But he supposed Hitler couldn’t let the so-called victory in Czechoslovakia pass without making the most of it.
In the front of the house young Henry Osborn was ringing the doorbell, an official letter from the German Army in his hands, stamped with the Führer’s seel.
remembered Steve’s when a moment allowed, and these were not Tony’s children or Tony’s burdens. Someone should have cared to know the day and mark it. Steve should have.
“I don’t know what you think happened ‘Highness, but Schmidt beat him within an inch of his life the trouble of taking that thing. He’s had plenty of opportunities to take Steve out of the picture but he hasn’t, because he can’t prove shit and they want to keep the people pacified while Germany swallows their country.” Turning an angry gaze on Thor Bucky continued. “And that letter makes it clear that their not stopping with Austria. They’re coming for everyone Thorson, and Norway sooner than most. You’re a fool if you ignore it.”
“Yes,” Natacha agreed immediately. Her smile was pleasant and conspiratorial as she kissed the baby’s plump cheek once more. “Out of kindness I think I shall spare him for a few years more.”
“And truth be told, your being too ill to join your friends might be more of a blessing than you yet realize. There are worse things that you could be too.”
Any hope that Tony had of sticking to a normal schedule for the children went out the window as soon as the news spread that they were to leave for Vienna the following day. But it was just as well, because Tony might have underestimated the work involved with packing for himself as well as seven excitable small people for an indefinite amount of time.  There were trunks to haul out from storage, clothing to launder and press, and evenWillamina was kept on her feet boxing snacks and other small treats for their travels (because apparently you just couldn’t trust the food that came out of these big cities).
rung loudly in Tony’s ears, along with the splunk and crash of bullets tearing through the sides of the boat.
“You know, in my family when someone dies we make a point to sit together and think about them. Sometimes, just having someone sitting beside you when you feel loss like that can make all the difference. But talking can be good too.” Tony explained slowly, looking up as if pulled by some magnet to find Stefen watching them. “Remembering them is how we show that their soul touched ours. By sharing our stories and memories of them, whether good or bad, we soothe the souls of the living.”
The house was in a flurry to be ready for the arrival of the first guests. Herr Hammer and Pepper were dashing about like racing hounds, snapping orders at the poor house maids who were scurrying about the house like mice.
This felt like another one of Tony’s strange tests. Péter was supposed to have grasped something, but once again he’d missed the important details, failed to ask the right questions.
“Baxt.” Tony said to his retreating back, the sound carrying over the sniffles of the children. “E grazie.”
The wardrobe in the bathroom connected to her parents’ room had always been one of Natacha’s favorite places for hiding. It was large enough for a small girl to use the drawers as a ladder and settle inside the cupboard, and full of soft things like towels and clean linens for cushion. She was on the older side of twelve now and the fit was tighter, but thankfully she was still slight enough to manage it – though it would have been painfully embarrassing to be discovered that way.
,” Tony’s grandfather immediately tried to reassure him, though he could have no idea how much he failed at that. “The gypsies steal and cause all sorts of problems. I heard they even steal children. So, to control the crime, the Ministry declared that all gypsies must be confined to police zones. It’s not like in Germany, where they round up good people.”
He could no more stop Péter Rogers from becoming a man too quickly than he could preserve the fat on his bones. Both were outside his control, but preserving his life – Tony would do whatever it cost.
Two of the dicks laugh like it was a challenge instead of a warning. Wade, who has been banned from many many labs, knows the warning.
"He could be doing some stuff he's not supposed to do?" Betty looked like she was actually about to rip out Eleanor's throat. Cindy would say it was because she has a crush the size of Jupiter on the boy, but Cindy kinda wants murder too. She just accused Ned of corporate espionage.
Everyone turned to Ned and MJ. The latter scoffed and turned back to her book, and Ned raised an eyebrow, " you guys didn't believe us about the internship. Why the heck would we tell you people about the adoption?"
"I mean, Anthony is not smart enough to be a meaningful member to any team Steve is in." he waves a hand towards the Super solder in question.
Which is whatever. Really. Who cares if Jessie said she feels like vomiting when she looks at him? He feels the same way about her cheers attempts.
