“‘Kay,” he said, and some of the tension bled out of him. He felt drunk without the buzz. Just out of his element and sloppy and embarrassing. Steve settled his hand on the back of Tony’s neck and squeezed, just enough pressure to be comforting and grounding.
“Obviously, you were the worst off,” Rhodey says eventually. “And then Clint, ruptured spleen, some fucked up ribs, and other internal damage, but his surgery went well. He’s mobile but benched for the time being. Scott’s going to be out for a few weeks too, popped his shoulder clean out of the socket, and then back in and kept going. Sam sprained his ankle pretty good and Wanda got a bump on the head.” Tony nods. “Other than that it was all cuts and bruises, mostly.”
And he thinks of Steve driving them home from the Accords gala early, of standing in the dark kitchen, both of them weighed down and at a loss, of Steve choking on root beer, of waking up next to him. Of the steadiness of his heart when he knows Steve’s well and truly with him, on his side.
He’s gone, then, and Tony’s nose burns with tears he absolutely refuses to cry. It’s been so long since he’s seen Bruce, but it’s not like Tony didn’t know how the big guy would feel about the Accords. It seems that he’d stubbornly held out hope though. He'd been hoping he would still have Bruce as a friend at the end of this, like maybe he could understand the horror they kept leaving in their wake, that they needed to stop, they needed to be stopped.
“Stark?” he calls out. Tony’s near the back of the lab, off to the side where he’s been keeping Bucky’s arm as it’s been slowly assembled. He spins around in his chair, leaving the screens up to backlight him as he stands and spreads his arms.
The list feels like something final. Here’s Tony, after advocating for the Accords for a year now, after vying for the belief that the most powerful don’t get to decide what’s right and who they help, and now this list, this list ranking the value of human life. He knows it’s a decision he makes in the field every time he goes out, but it’s never felt so clinical.
“Who told on me?” Tony asks, doing a barrel roll over a couple bots as they charge up and take aim. He breaks when he hears the fire go off and mentally cheers when the laser beam sails by him into the sky, not hitting a building or the armor to bounce around. “Brucie?”
They seem frozen, and Tony feels another flash of the impossibility of the divide between them, the one he felt in Steve’s office. He tries to smile back at Steve, feeling dumb and unsure of literally everything. Steve’s smile doesn’t disappear, exactly, but his gaze flicks over Tony’s face, assessing, calculating, before he turns just long enough to shut off the lamp.
Besides, he doesn’t want to accidentally kill anyone. Even if they aren’t a lovey-dovey group of friends, he still needs to protect them, because that is how things are.
“Yeah,” Steve says, one shoulder ticking up in a lazy shrug. “We could…watch a movie. Or something.”
“Would you like me to lie to you, Boss?” FRIDAY says; she sounds bored. Tony takes a half-deep breath, careful of the way he feels like he’s been stabbed between the ribs. The joke feels normal, brings a false sense of control he desperately needs, but it costs him, just talking, being awake, breathing.
“Enough!” Thor says from Tony’s right. The boom, the sheer command in his voice, is enough to startle Tony. He’s been quiet so far, but now his back is straight and he’s looking around in disappointment
“So,” Tony says eventually. His arms are folded on the table, his head resting on top of them. Bruce is fiddling with his phone, waiting for the hour mark to make his next observations. “How’re things going with you and Natasha?”
He’s warm and heavy. Safe. Surrounded in a glorious nothingness he’s been missing for a long time, somehow. If he had to equate the feeling to a place, it would be the mansion on Fifth Avenue, the one he hasn’t been to in—years. Tony holds the feeling so close that he almost loses it completely.
He hates this—hates it with a passion. He doesn’t know how to react around people who are suffering when he can’t fix it. A wild fantasy comes to him, unbidden, of offering to pay the EMT’s student loans off, buy them a vacation home in Hawaii, anything they want if they could just get Steve to the hospital instantaneously, stop moving him around so much. Instead of doing any of that, he settles for telling Steve he’s going to be okay, that he’s not alone, and negotiating a tone that keeps his voice light and calm but leaves no room for argument as they slosh their way through the midafternoon traffic.
Eventually, the doctor nods to Bucky and exits the room. Bucky inclines his head at the doctor in response, but leaves his chin down when he rotates to glare at Steve.
“I’ve been sitting in my office for days,” Tony says, “and even then, Wilson’s the only one who comes to see me.”
Steve’s turned and thrown his shield before Tony’s completely done talking. The alien staggers back, but isn’t down for the count. Tough little fuckers.
“I’m not sure I am entirely on board with the notion of moving Barnes while he’s unaware,” he admits. His face on the video feed doesn’t look tired, but Tony thinks the king is radiating the kind of long-suffering exhaustion that Tony uniquely inspires.
It’s just—Barnes was there, Barnes is living here, in the compound, and. And, and, and. And it’s not Barnes’s fault. And it’s no good to offer someone a place to live if you make it clear you don’t want them there. And he’s not even mad at Barnes, not really, hasn’t been for a long time now. And he can’t stop waiting for Steve to forget about his existence entirely. And he’s worried he’s going to turn into the Winter Soldier 2.0 and kill the last people he ever wants to hurt, the people he’s already hurt anyway. And—
“Where’d you learn so much about the stars anyway, Captain City Boy?” Tony says, trying to regain control of the situation.
“So Clint, Thor, and Dr. Banner all jump up from where they’re sitting and start screaming at one another and at Tony, and Clint’s calling Nat a traitor, and they all run out of the room like their asses are on fire, and I had no idea.”
The sun is setting over…Kansas? The sun is setting over Kansas as Tony flies east, and it’s going to be dark in Illinois by the time they start the battle. Battles take either half the time or triple the time in the dark. Tony knows this, and Steve knows this, and Tony knows Steve knows this, and Steve knows that Tony knows that Steve knows this.
“God, you sound like Ms. Potts—fine, fine, I’ll come hang out more. If you bring the fingernail polish, I’ll bring the popcorn machine. We can braid each other’s hair and gossip.”
“Shouldn’t Extremis be fixing his heart?” Steve asks. He doesn’t understand. If Bruce and Tony really did fix the process, then Tony shouldn’t blow up, and his heart definitely shouldn’t stop.
Socially awkward has next to nothing to do with it. Tony knows the man’s working on not getting into situations where he’s tempted to start a fight these days. He just brings his coffee to his lips to hide his smile—it does nothing good to encourage Clint—when a drawn-out grunt comes from the bed. Clint steps close enough to perch, lightly sitting on the very edge of the mattress, and crosses his arms. Tony, slightly boxed in by his tablets and not wanting to crowd, stays put.
“Leave,” Tony says, pointing down the hall. “Go, really, I mean it. That was terrible, Rhodes, deplorable.”
“Yeah,” Steve says. They don’t have as much food as Steve could eat, as they always had at the tower or the compound, but it’s enough to keep him healthy. He thinks he might’ve lost some weight, but he doesn’t know how much of that is due to their lack of resources and how much is because he keeps forgetting to eat. “I’m okay. Sam’s with me, it’s just the two of us.”
Tony’s throat feels stuck when he opens his mouth. He can almost hear the ghosts of Obie telling him to buck up, Dad’s audible glare stuck over smiling teeth. He even imagines Pepper’s terse smile, though that one’s probably nonsensical.
“Total breech of trust, I hear ya, I do,” Tony says. “Moving an unconscious man without his permission while he’s in what amounts to a medically induced coma. Barnes has had more than his fair share of decisions forced on him.”
“Yeah.” Clint scoffs, runs a hand through his hair. Tony takes a sip from his coffee and burns the tip of his tongue. “What about you? Sticking around for a while?”
There’s a murmur in the crowd, and another reporter asks how the Avengers are to be trusted with snap decisions if they take months to agree on anything. Thankfully, though, Natasha steps in to answer.
There are timestamped pictures of him before the Avengers reunited (mostly headed to and from meetings, a couple shots of him walking into the hospital Rhodey was staying at), and they’re side by side with photographs from the second signing of the Accords and the beginning of the gala that night, along with explanations as to why that second row can’t be real. In the first photos it points out his injuries, one of which may have, the author reasons, been responsible for his demise. Even his body shape is compared; in the first row of pictures, he looks ill but also like he’d been stress eating, he’s got a bit of a belly and hollows under his eyes. In the second, he looks like a manic version of his younger self, a bit of a slimmer waist and more color, hair carefully styled (but that last part’s all Natasha). Tony figures the physical renovation he did to the Malibu house was good for something, and getting rid of the alcohol didn’t hurt either.
“Okay,” Tony says, and he can feel his brow scrunch up in confusion. “We feel what we feel, I guess. That’s—uh. Valid?”
Steve hummed and it took over Tony’s senses again. He snuggled into the man. He was aware enough to notice when Natasha arrived, draping his blanket over the both of them. She took the plate of food and disposed of it and then sat in Tony’s spot on the couch.
Tony’s up close and personal with one of the bots—he's found that his repulsors can at least reliably weaken the joints if the shot is point-blank—when he’s suddenly being blown back, down, and into the ground. As he stands from the crater he’s apparently made, he looks up to see another explode in the sky, and he understands.
“It’s nice out here,” Tony says aloud, giving a voice to the tranquility settling over his mind, casting his eyes over the orchard. The trees are shorter than Tony expected for apple trees, but sturdy looking. He doesn’t doubt they can hold their own in the wicked upstate winters. Steve looking at him in a way Tony can’t immediately identify.
Steve’s lying, twisted, legs mostly out straight, but torso slumped to the side in a way that looks like it should be uncomfortable. He’s out cold, his face ultra-calm in a way that speaks of oblivion. For a blinding, stomach-turning moment, Tony sees the War Machine armor, Rhodey’s blank face still in the helmet.
He steps forward, doing what felt impossible just seconds ago, and it’s like miniaturizing the arc reactor all over again, the feeling he gets putting his palm flat to Steve’s sternum. He keeps his elbow bent only slightly, connecting with Steve in a way that makes him real, human, warm—
Bucky falls asleep eventually, but Tony’s on a bit of a roll by then so he turns the volume down a little bit, gets another cup of coffee and a tablet, and sets up camp on the armchair while
Thor laughs, a low, calming rumble. “You’re quite welcome.” And his grin grows. “Honestly, I’m surprised you managed so long without me.”
“Professionally, anyway,” he says. “Personally, the two of us were never really close, and he’s been nice enough about the whole me-disappearing-for-a-couple-years-unexplained thing. But the way he conducted himself as a leader of this team? Deplorable.”
“Cap, I’m fine.” He makes sure it’s a drawl and not a snap, and Steve emerges from the fridge frowning, carrying half an onion, a carton of eggs, and a mango. Tony almost wants to ask what the hell he’s planning on making with that.
Eventually, he opens his eyes, feeling truly rested. They’ve shifted around in the night, a little farther apart than they were, and Tony’s ended up on his stomach (even though he doesn’t have the arc reactor anymore, he still rolls onto his stomach a lot in his sleep, a remembered weight on his chest sometimes present when he lies on his back), his arm flung haphazardly across Steve’s abs. Steve himself is on his back, face slack and so beautiful the force of it hits Tony like a truck.
Maybe he's being a little dramatic—it sure as hell wouldn’t be the first time he’d been accused of theatricality—but he has to wait for this new version of reality to settle around him. In this version, Steve cares about him, and lets Tony seek out contact, which Steve then adds to. It’s a reality where the team might be real, might work and not even kill him in the process. In this reality—wonder of wonders—Steve wants to work with him to fix the issues with the team.
“Oh, don’t give me that,” Tony laughed. He actually liked Bucky, it turned out. And all of that murderous rage Tony felt in Siberia washed away when Steve wasn’t talking in his ear about how innocent his friend was. “He probably learned that from you, back in the day.”
“Honestly?” Tony says, and he sounds amused. Steve’s eyes start welling up at the same moment Sam comes to stand in his doorway, arms crossed and eyebrows up. “Nothing. I’m sitting at home and have the holiday off for some reason, it’s probably a fluke with the calendar and I’ll get hell for it tomorrow, but Pep’s gotta actually talk to me to yell at me so I figure it won’t be too bad, either way.”
“There are multiple super soldiers in this building,” Tony says, turning back to Steve. “And besides them, others with mega-metabolisms. Even the baseline humans here eat more than
Clint fires off a shot from the sky, and Wanda comes flying down of her own power, Redwing and Sam hot on her heels, and Thor waits for them to be clear before falling mightily from the sky and scorching the ground with lightning. They’re up to 35 bots if Tony had to guess, something he failed to mention over the comm.
And Steve’s standing bare meters away. Tony watches in slow motion as Steve’s eyes widen and he starts to put up the shield like that’s going to help at all. Too slow, Tony thinks, but fires up the repulsors anyway.
While Steve seems to be dead to the world, Tony finds himself excruciatingly awake. They all have nightmares, of course. Not even Thor, who’s been alive for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, is totally immune to the grislier things he’s seen. Even Natasha, as elusive and preternatural as she normally is, will openly admit to having nightmares regularly. There’s really no point in denying it when it affects them all (save for Vision, if only because the weirdo doesn’t sleep). So it’s not the knowledge that Steve has nightmares that has Tony’s stomach in knots, not even close. But something about Steve trusting him so implicitly, letting Tony see the nightmare and accepting the comfort.
“Debatable.” Tony stood, stretched. He felt more like himself than he had all night. “Technically it’s Sensory Processing Disorder, and it’s often a symptom of something else. In casual conversation you can just call it being overwhelmed or sensory overload.”
Rhodey doesn’t answer for a minute, instead walking laboriously over to a chair and using his arms to help lower himself into it. He starts unhooking the braces and is halfway done before he speaks.
“Getting acquainted with the compound’s Hulk room,” she says, and Steve would be curious, really, if curiosity didn’t take so much energy.
Steve comes out of the bathroom and Tony tracks him by sound, to the dresser, the bedside table to click the lamp on, to the wall to turn the overhead light off, and to the side of the bed closest to the door.
“You’re Iron Man!” she screams, and Tony doesn’t know if it’s the last thing she screams, but it’s the last he hears. He doesn’t know if it’s panic-in-response-to-Wanda or magic-induced panic, but time halts for the briefest expanse of time and he swears he can feel his pupils dilate, and then the moment shatters.
They’ve all paired off, more or less. Steve’s with Wanda, chatting with whoever comes up to them and glowering at anyone who makes a less-than-kind remark; Natasha’s with Scott, and the both of them seem to be mingling fluidly through the crowd, and Tony assumes Natasha’s steering the conversation and letting Scott charm the masses; Clint, strangely enough, is in the corner with Vision, and the both of them seem to be outside the circle of the party, watching and occasionally talking to each other; and Tony’s floating through the room, being passed around and, somehow, Sam’s managed to keep up with him. He’s a calming presence in the familiar dance of schmoozing and laughing. Not only does Sam keep up, but he inserts himself into conversations in ways that sound natural, and not totally like he’s on Tony-babysitting duty.
He thinks of his teammates, too, once he’s desperate and melancholy enough. Of Nat, while she was undercover as Natalie Rushman, how she always seemed to know which times of night were the worst for the pain, when he would slump onto the couch in the workshop and feel it in every inch of his blood, heavy, like his bone marrow had made a deal with gravity for some extra attention, when it felt like a million tiny anchors were tied to his blood vessels dragging him deeper and deeper into his own head with the knowledge that one night, it would take him all the way down, until he’d drown for real, until the night when he suddenly wouldn’t make it till morning—and Natasha would come in wearing something tight and low cut, brandishing tea, and she’d stare at him and say slightly unnerving things until Tony took it and drained the entire mug.
“I’ll call it in and make my way over. You fly,” Clint says. His eyes are dark and solemn, his chin lowered.
They lay there afterwards, and Tony shucks the rest of his clothes while Steve uses a few tissues to sort of clean up, and tosses them onto the floor even though the garbage can is right there under the desk—it’s delightful how messy Steve can be when he finally lets go.
“What was that?” Steve says, sounding pissed. Part of Tony rejoices at breaking through some of Steve’s shell of control; the rest of him rails against it and reminds Tony that Steve has to be careful for a reason. Where Tony’s frustration might one day break someone’s nose, Steve’s might punch a hole in someone’s skull (or chest).
Her response takes longer this time, almost fifteen minutes and Tony doesn’t have a clue what he’ll do if she says no, but he suspects the ground would shake apart underneath him and deposit him straight into hell.
“Steve,” Tony says, and turns finally. He makes sure he has eye contact, locked and loaded, before he continues. “What we’re doing, you and me, is all fine and dandy. Maybe even good.” Steve’s lips curl up at one side, an unwilling smile. “It doesn’t change me, though. And it doesn’t change you. Whatever’s about to come out of your mouth sounds like it’s gonna be at least slightly hypocritical, so maybe—don’t.”
They end up on the common floor couch, watching a movie about paintings in the 1950’s with Amy Adams because apparently they’re becoming the kind of friends who watch movies alone together in the dead of night. He doesn’t even have to bully Steve into physical contact this time around. In fact, when Tony rests his head on Steve’s shoulder, Steve rolls with it, tossing an arm over Tony’s shoulders, grounding him.
And it’s always like this, isn’t it? Always Tony reaching out first with an olive branch Steve’s so ready to smack away or dismiss as showing off. Always Tony offering Steve a place to live, or throwing a birthday party, or making updates to his equipment so he doesn’t die of a malfunction in the field.
Tony reaches up and—yeah, he’s definitely still wearing the tinted HUD glasses. Effectively: sunglasses inside at 7:30AM. Patented asshole look. He’s worked with worse before. And, luckily, he can hear the elevator on its way.
There are things that need to be dealt with. The others need to sign the Accords or there are going to be problems. He should tell them that their rooms are still intact. He should ask T’Challa if he can stay until tomorrow or if he needs to get back to running his country. He should call to tell Rhodey he’s okay. He should sit Steve down and explain the changes in the Accords, the safeguards in place. But, for God’s sake, he’s still in the suit sans the helmet, and there are a couple of plates bent inwards and jabbing at his fucked ribs, so he turns on his heel as smoothly as he can and gets in the elevator.
“I guess,” Rhodey says. “Look, at least he gave himself an out this time, an out with a viable probability of success.”
What Howard never told him (though, perhaps he hadn’t known, or it was different for him) was the paralytic effects of anxiety, the spiraling thoughts leading nowhere but brain gridlock. At MIT, there were weeks at a time where Tony would skip class and wander campus like a ghost, oscillating between obsessively thinking about things beyond his control and altering his brain chemistry beyond the ability to obsess. He’d come back to himself one day, one hour, one minute, having picked up a tool, or idly turning over ideas get through a homework assignment he’d left lying out, or with someone else’s walkman deconstructed and laid out on a coffee table that wasn’t in his dorm, and he’d begin the arduous task of working his way back to himself.
They’re all standing around the compound because there’s no SHIELD to report to anymore and there’s available medical for anyone who needs to be looked over. Everyone’s here from the rogue crew: Clint, Wanda, Scott, Steve, Sam, T’Challa (who never was one of the rogue Avengers, but Tony’s not an idiot and it takes someone rich as Tony or T’Challa to feed a super soldier). Everyone but Bucky. But, to be frank, Tony’s tired. He has bruised ribs and he’s exhausted physically and emotionally, and he’s not going to ask where Barnes is. Vision’s here too, but he never left, and so is Natasha. Rhodes is doing better but nowhere cleared for active duty yet.
Scott makes that sound significant, but Tony has no idea why. He’s right, though. The bug things have jaws that open up and down instead of the sideways jaws of ants.
“Okay,” Tony says, “I was kind of an asshole when he came to my home unannounced and acted like I was the one being unreasonable but to be fair he came to my home unannounced and acted like I was the one being unreasonable.”
“You know…What the fuck, Barton, you know Nat and I got the pardons pushed through a month ago. We were planning on bringing you back.”
“I shall return,” FRIDAY says, voice inflected with more warmth that usual. Air forces its way out of Tony’s throat, and he makes it into a sob instead of a scream.
Mostly, Steve is glad that Tony seems to have winded down. There’s been less noise less frequently from the hall in front of them, and Steve feels unwillingly hopeful about that. It’s unpleasant. He’s been here before, and it’s not a place he likes to go. It’s like the sinking feeling people get when they know something’s wrong, that gut instinct that drags you down without a bit of consent from reason, except where that’s a feeling that other people sometimes get, it’s more like a place Steve lives. But the mirror feeling, that awful lightness that pulls him to the surface when he
“And to be entirely honest with you?” Rhodey says, ignoring Tony entirely in a way that makes Tony smile into his phone. “I’m pretty sure that if I tried to kick Steve’s ass you’d just end up kicking mine. Then I’d have to kick your ass, and that’s just embarrassing for everyone involved.”
“Yeah,” Bucky says, like he caught all that. He purses his lips. “One thing at a time. Let’s get someone to look at your back.”
Tony doesn’t reply because there’s really nothing else he can say over text in the middle of the night that won’t make her hate him all over again, but something unclenches in his chest. He thinks he should be anxious, or try planning what he’s going to say to her, but instead he feels heavy, like a tension that was holding him up, holding him together, has slackened if not been untangled yet.
“Er,” Scott says, obviously still working to keep the conversation light, “yes? Since when does telling some asshat in glasses
He’s almost got the new voice-command system mapped out by the time Sam and Steve step out of the elevator in workout clothes, looking bright eyed and bushy tailed.
If he’s being honest, he could argue the point. Tony drove him away, the Accords made it impossible to stay. They could’ve run together or found a solution that works for everyone, but in reality it was Steve’s black-and-white stubbornness and his lie of omission about Bucky that lead them here. And yet here Tony is, calling on Steve’s birthday, because he’s always been the bigger person, the first to admit when he fucks up, and the one to try the hardest to correct his past mistakes. And Steve, like everyone else, fed on the image of Tony-fucking-Stark and used that reputation against Tony.
“Or, I mean, at least the prototype for it. But this is about as far as I can get without you trying it on and answering some questions about it. Got the scans from T'Challa and some input from Shuri, so everything should be pretty up-to-date, but obviously neither one of them can tell me whether it'll be comfortable or shift your center of balance, and so.”
“I’m definitely offended,” Steve says, though his growing grin says otherwise. “And I’d argue if it were any less true. Man, I used to drive my ma up the wall. Bucky, too.”
It takes a few minutes for Wanda to pull back. In that time, Steve’s taken a slight blow to the head but swears he’s fine, and Redwing’s found an injured woman in a stairwell, so Natasha takes off to retrieve her. Sam starts flying lower after that, firing on the aliens in clever little dive-bombs.
Tony’s never felt more like he belonged somewhere, like he was wanted and not just tolerated. (Valued. The word for this: valued.)
“Tony.” A voice from the other direction. Wait, Tony thinks. That’s not right. “Can you open your eyes?”
There are people sitting on every surface available. Natasha and Bucky are on the loveseat along the far wall; Wanda, Scott, and Sam are on the first couch, and Clint’s sitting on the arm, leaning against Wanda; Vision and Bruce are on one of the loveseats, heads bent close together and absorbed in conversation, though Vis looks up and smiles briefly at Tony; Thor’s on the floor next to Bruce’s feet, his back leaning against the arm of the loveseat.
“No,” Clint says in exasperation. Stops himself. Starts again, only slightly more reigned in, “That’s not the point.”
It’s just before 5 AM, and Tony feels good. He wants to chase the feeling, though he’s not entirely sure of the most effective way to do that. Brain still half remembering the old days, he recalls the benders, just one more drink, another line just to hold him over when everything got overwhelming or the people seemed vicious. Chasing the incredible, ultimate freedom with reckless abandon. And later, chasing that feeling of worth every time he destroyed another stash of the weaponry designed by his own hands, chasing Yinsen’s ghost. After the Battle of New York, chasing the feeling of a full breath, the actual lungful he could only manage when a new suit was assembled and powering on in front of him, or some other new precaution put into place against the looming threat of vengeful aliens.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says softly. Tony opens his eyes to see Steve smiling in the soft light from the lamp. He has a corner of the comforter in his hand and flaps it demonstratively when Tony looks over. “Scoot over.”
They’ve done a pretty good job of keeping up with the new ones, but at some point they started showing up five at a time instead of two, so it’s still going to take them a while.
“Jesus Christ,” Clint says, hushed but not a whisper. Annoyed? Exasperated. And then, as an afterthought, “Hey.”
His skin tingles, when he gets close enough to feel it. It’s…abnormal, possibly even concerning, and he lets himself be swept out with the current as soon as he can, just to escape it.
“A vacation with no lab?” Tony says, taking great care to sound aghast and an appropriate level of horrified by the very idea. “That’s what you get for not letting me help with the itinerary.”
Steve sweeps his gaze around the small balcony and his eyes end up back on Tony’s face. He’s not sure what Steve finds there, but a moment later he slides his back against the door and ends up sitting criss-cross opposite Tony.
The helmet rotates so the eyes are staring right at Steve, and his gut lurches. It’s that same unfamiliar, too-graceful movement Iron Man had when landing.
“Yes,” Steve said, and then Tony could hear the laughter in his voice, all bright and happy. The great Captain America was struggling to keep his voice even and Tony felt like he’d won a prize. “You can’t sleep on the chair all night, you’ll hurt your neck.”
“So,” Clint says, “they happen to find inoperable brain cancer while looking in his skull, or what?”
“Nice,” Tony echoes, and quirks his lips back. “Make sure you mention that when everyone else is at the table, Sammy-boy.”
When he’s not wearing safety goggles, he’s got the HUD glasses on, and everything is so much better. There’s less light stimulation from the tint of the lenses, and, strangely enough, the supplementary info from the mini HUD seems to help too. There’s finally enough right in front of him, enough relevant data, to occupy at least most of the corners of his brain. Between the HUD glasses and his music, and knowing that his team is safe and accounted for, he feels clearer than he has in months. He is, effectively, in the zone. Breathes in, feeling his lungs fill to the brim with air in that entirely satisfying way he hasn’t been able to do since Afghanistan, holds it.
“But then who would spread the gospel!” Tony shouts back, holding up his own phone displaying the picture of Bucky that is, on closer inspection, actually pretty funny. FRIDAY’s got an eye for angles, go figure.
“Always,” he says easily, knowing it’s a bit of a dick move. Thankfully, Steve barrels on like he hasn’t heard Tony at all.
“You’re in the hospital,” the doctor says patiently. “We’re gonna go upstairs real quick and take a scan of your brain, if that sounds alright with you.”
“You come in to my lab, just to disrespect me like this?” he says dramatically, so Tony thinks he must not be too mad. Bruce shakes his head and says, “Ridiculous. Hand me that solution. No, not—the one marked with red tape.
“This isn’t a lecture,” Tony says, motioning for them to put their hand down, “please, God, don’t do that.”
“Yeah but her perspective might be a little skewed, don’t you think?” Rhodey glances toward one of FRIDAY’s sensors. “No offense, Fri.”
Tony sways, even with Steve holding him, and Steve ushers him to the couch and sits him down before turning towards the kitchen.
“That’s BS and you know it,” Sam says, but his tone is much kinder than Bruce’s. “Not every job that involves regular near-death has mental safety nets in place, but they all should and a lot of them do.”
He’s fine up until the moment he decides he needs a shower (his entire body feels greasy and stale, and his hair is downright disgusting). When he undresses, his fingers and toes are all warm—he’s had poor circulation since before Iron Man, uncovered extremities always means numbly cold. It’s enough to throw him off balance, but not exactly bad.
“Oh, Jesus fuck,” Tony hisses. This is not what he came here for. He didn’t even mean to come here. What happened to that resolution he made about thinking things through? He was supposed to go to his ’shop, to run some more tests on himself or distract himself until he restored some kind of equilibrium.
Tony scrunches his nose successfully and thinks, wrong direction. Pulling his muscles the other way, he cracks his eyes open. Rhodey’s there, wearing something close to the expression he had when they reunited in the desert: stressed, relieved, and dizzy with all of it.
(Sue him, it’s the Fourth of July, okay?) In his head, a voice that sounds like both Tony and Bucky laughs at him, and isn’t that just depressing.
“No, no, no,” Clint’s voice carries up to Tony. “Oh, my God, Vis, come on. No, wait, don’t use those!”
“You’re waiting for the early bird joke, right?” Tony says. Clint quirks a grin at him. “‘Cause I wasn’t actually gonna go for it. Too obvious.”
There’s a certain stillness: Bruce, Wanda, Scott, and Bucky, quiet and watchful, distrustful almost. Surprisingly, it’s Scott who speaks up first.
Tony still can’t understand how he doesn’t create a black hole when he does the whole shrinking thing, but Scott won’t tell them and Bruce just sighs the weary sigh of someone who can’t figure out his own messed up physiology and has come to accept that some things will forever be mysteries. (Tony hates it, even if he concedes defeat for now.) They spitball a few ideas over Scott’s head while he smiles a shit-eating, superior smile—and, God, wouldn’t Pym be proud if he could see the guy now—but all to no avail.
“You’re just a cheap date, Wilson,” Tony will say, and the nameless man will have either left or gotten brushed to the back of everyone’s minds.
“Any idea what happened?” Clint asks, and Steve can already hear feet pounding on the street, getting closer. Steve realizes belatedly that FRIDAY must not be transmitting through the comms, just the suit’s speakers.
“That is,” Rhodey pauses, blows out a breath, “not what I meant at all, and you know it. And, to be entirely honest with you? I think you’re severely overlooking the part of this scenario where you have just as much power to hurt him as he does to hurt you.”
The suit opens then, and she catches him before he can smack his face on the ground, though he’s not even opposed to it at this point. He writhes where she sets him, propped up against the back wall of a building. Suddenly free, his body doesn’t know what to do, but it’s desperately searching for a position that’s more comfortable. His hands press into his closed eyes, one of his legs kicks out, he twists.
“Within the next day, Bruce thinks,” Rhodey says. It’s quiet, then, except for the sounds of the exoskeleton’s clasps being undone. Steve slides down the wall and lets his head thump back. The position pulls at his hip, but he doesn’t get up.
It earns him a sleepy snort, but Bruce’s eyes are drooping again so Tony doesn’t even have to hide his responding grin.
The pizza’s still warm when they get back to the compound. With the preliminary debrief Clint mentioned, the others didn’t beat them back by more than an hour. Noticing the boxes upon boxes upon boxes, some with strange topping combinations—the pizzeria's even gone to the trouble of learning a pared down Mockba recipe because Nat once mentioned in a BuzzFeed interview she missed it sometimes—Tony decides that whatever they tipped wasn’t enough and he’ll write them another check for the hell of it. It’s a little local pizzeria that drives way out of their way to deliver to the compound, and have learned how to make a very many pizzas very quickly since the Avengers moved upstate.
“Let’s have a Hawaiian pizza waiting at the house when I get there.” He picks up a tablet and starts looking around at the in-progress projects and which ones he can work on in the Malibu workshop. “And some soda.”
“Steve.” And Tony wasn’t smiling, but it sounded like he was anyway. Steve heaved a sigh and his shoulders drooped. Tony sent a prayer of thanks to Odin. He wasn’t in the mood for Steve-Rogers-gearin’-up-for-a-fight.
“Tony,” Steve murmurs, and Tony can feel the word across his scalp, a warm breath of air from where Steve has his nose buried in Tony’s hair.
“I am,” Tony whispers. Then, louder, angrier, “I’m trying. You know I’m not just being difficult for the sake of it, right? I was there and I was trying. Hell, I still am, Rogers, I just needed to breathe.”
“Anyway!” he says and, shit, all this awareness is going to be really bad for him when it’s not saving his life, he’s pretty sure. He can sense Thor’s tenseness, Clint’s wariness, Sam’s pinched expression, Vision’s steady, imposing presence, Bucky’s eyes tracking him expertly. Tony gathers his dishes, tosses his plate in the sink, refills the mug.
This went on until he found himself in a cave in Afghanistan and sort of had to confront some of the truths of his life.
“Mostly of turning into a braindead monster and killing everyone,” Tony says. “Or of slowly going insane and dropping dead from some bullshit inability to reach REM sleep. But…” Steve’s nose nudges against Tony’s head, and Tony breathes deeply again. “I was scared of it being Ultron all over again. Of not saying anything and being blamed when shit hits the fan.”
This is good, a step in the right direction, and Tony wills himself to believe it. It’s ridiculous to feel like he’s unwanted because Steve didn’t email him personally. This is what Tony asked for, explicitly. The fact that Steve finally seems to be showing the barest hint of respect for Tony shouldn’t feel like this, but it’s only highlighting how much Steve would trust literally anyone over Tony—whether it be a team of lawyers, a stranger he met on a morning run (yes, he means Wilson; he’s a good man, but Tony can admit to still being hurt he didn’t even get a call during DC), the girl who willingly joined HYDRA and volunteered for experimentation on the off chance she’d get revenge on Tony.
It’s gotten particularly bad since Siberia. He doesn’t feel like he’s seated in his own skin properly, and there’s an aching in his chest even though he knows better than to think it’s his old asthma, but damn if it doesn’t hurt just the same.
is. His fingernails scratch lightly over the t-shirt there, Steve’s breath catching at the movement. Tony files the sound away, using it to fortify his confidence. “I liked waking up on the couch this morning. I liked that it was
"Wish I coulda met him,” Steve says, and he presses his cheek against Tony’s hair. “It would’ve been nice to punch him hard enough to shatter his jaw.”
“We won’t let it get that far,” Steve says. “And even if something did happen, it wouldn’t be your fault.”
By the time they get Steve settled into a bed, he seems a little better. He’s just exhausted, and drops off into a doze the second he knows they’re done with him for the time being. The nurse who sets them up says they’ll probably only hold Steve until they look through the scans. She doesn’t say so, but Tony’s pretty sure they don’t expect to find anything troubling.
“Goodnight!” Steve calls after them, to which Bruce mumbles some very unkind and downright obscene words into Tony’s shoulder. Tony laughs a laugh that is pure delight. Just as Tony calls the elevator, Sam comes out of the stairwell off to the side, takes one look at them standing there, and grins.
A laugh catches Steve so off-guard it comes out as a snort and his hand flies up to his face (Tony guesses he’s making sure he didn’t just spray snot everywhere). He lowers his hand a couple cautious seconds later, smirking.
But now Tony has a plan. This is a good way to chase contentment, he decides, and hell if Steve’s going to stop him. In fact, they’re a team now. Steve’s going to help.
He and Scott get to talking after that, and it’s so easy. The guy has some ideas for new training simulators that sound fun. They shit talk each other’s sports teams with all the heat of people who love where they’re from but don’t give a shit about sports, laughing at themselves more than each other.
Tony goes down his mental checklist of Checking In With Peter (which, as it turns out, is marginally different from his original list of Checking In With Teenagers as procured from internet research): greeting (which they kind of skipped over, but he properly introduced Peter to Steve, so he’ll check the box anyway), reassurance, showing interest—ah. Showing interest.
“I never said I’d keep you from fighting killer robots in the future,” Tony reminds him. “In fact—enabling. The suit upgrades count as me helping you do exactly that. You can’t work against me here, Cap, you gotta work with me.”
“Right,” he says, eyeing the non-effect. The woman with the dog is dragging it away by the collar, and the only other stragglers are idiots pointing their iPhones at the danger.
It’s been almost half an hour since he and Tony were freed from the rubble. Steve has some awful road rash and more than a couple broken bones, but he’s alive thanks to Tony, there’s no doubt in his mind. He can throw the shield still, but he’s not good for much else at this point. His dodges are getting sluggish; he can’t roll out of the way anymore because of his back, and his ankle protests any sharp sideways movements.
“Where’s Mr. Stark?” she asks Iron Man. No response comes from the suit, and a ball of dread settles heavily in Steve’s gut. “Open the armor!”
Halfway across the room, Natasha loses her shit. Not like—she doesn’t make a scene, or make a big deal out of it. The elevator doors close, and then open a few seconds later, and when Steve comes out, she starts laughing at him and can’t seem to stop.
Rhodey seems to have caught on that Tony’s not answering the phone, but that texts are fine. That’s a godsend because Rhodey doesn’t even require word-based texts. So Rhodey sends out a text every once in a while (every couple of days?) and all Tony has to do is send an emoji or two his way and they’re good. The purpose of Rhodey’s texts aren’t for information. If they spoke at all it would be comforting-if-ultimately-meaningless banter. It’s all just leftover guilt from the palladium thing and the Mandarin thing, so Rhodey has a habit of making sure Tony’s still alive, especially if Tony’s not around anyone else. Now that he’s given himself away by sending parts of the braces up to NYC instead of just dropping by himself, Rhodey’s either figured out that Tony’s gone AWOL or he’s spoken to someone up at the compound. If Tony had to guess, he’d say that either Sam or Vision tattled on him. But that’s fine, because this is Rhodey, and if Rhodey tore the earth apart and lost his mind every time Tony was acting strangely, the man wouldn’t have made it out of MIT in one piece. They have an
“And what did Shuri do?” Steve asks, much less suspicious than he probably should be, mostly seeming fond.
Tony shoves at Steve’s shoulder and rolls his eyes. They’re suddenly very close to each other and Tony hasn’t exactly been this close to someone, facing them and lending them his full attention, since he got control (more or less) of the way his senses work now. Steve has a distinct smell Tony’s brain immediately classifies as familiar and—somewhat surprisingly, especially since he at least smells partly like SHIELD agent—safe. SHIELD and the balm he uses on the leather straps of his shield. His hair is golden and thick, and Tony can see now where Steve styles it to hide a cowlick on the right side. His eyebrows taper off almost awkwardly, meaning it’s been just a couple weeks too long since he let Nat shape them up. One of his ears is just ever-so-slightly smaller than the other, but Tony really doesn’t think a human without enhanced senses would ever be able to tell without the help of a computer program.
“I have a headache,” he says, enunciating each word clearly. “I think I’ll live.” After a couple seconds he adds, “I could use some water, though.”
Steve sniggers because he’s unhelpful and an asshole and Tony tries to recall if they’ve ever had the “humans age like
“I don’t care if he thinks it looks clunky and ‘retro.’ That helmet is going to be thicker or—there is no ‘or.’ I’m the only one making uniforms these days. You’re all gonna be so safe you’ll have to actively try to get hurt—do
“Hi,” he says, and he sounds breathless and a little gruff, but not like he hasn’t spoken in however long it’s been now.
“Queens,” Tony says, watching Steve’s balance carefully as he gets in the passenger seat, though he really does look okay.
Steve gives him a look, a twist of the mouth and a lift of an eyebrow. He picks up Tony’s hand from where it’s still flung across his torso and starts manipulating Tony’s fingers, playing with them, running a fingertip back and forth across the calluses he finds. Tony, aware again of his position, turns onto his side, carefully not dislodging the hand in Steve’s grip.
His hesitance to leave is the only reason he’s even still there when the call comes in. He’s sitting in Bryant Park, being invisible, sipping from a paper cup of coffee, and people watching when his phone trills. Not a ring, or a ping, or a vibration. A trill, which only happens when it’s urgent Avengers business. He digs it out quickly and presses it to his ear.
The brief also says that once the embryos grow, the host will become “effectively dead.” Tony doesn’t want to find out what that means, but he has a feeling he won’t be so lucky.
And Tony is, quite frankly, sick of this. Frustrated and angry, even if he gets it a little bit. This is not a logical argument from Bruce, and it’s barely masquerading as one. His anger is probably just overlaying fear. There’s a lot Bruce does to cope with the reality of his life, and a lot of it would be deemed terrifying by a mental health professional.
Tony says, so loudly and suddenly that Steve pulls back in shock, eyes widening, even as Tony leans in and says, “Hold still.”
. It’s just enough of a shock to make the spark of anger flicker—right into a blaze. Like one of Pavlov’s fucking dogs, he’s hungry and a little anxious. Like clockwork. He raises an eyebrow down at his stomach.
The armor catches up with him then, and he gets away from his table to let it wrap around him. So much for invisibility, but it never lasts anyway.
FRIDAY would be okay with this too, Tony’s sure. She’ll have to know—there are things here that she’s going to have to help him with. They might even need to design a smarter armor if they want to pull this off, one that can not only analyze his fighting style but emulate it against hostiles. That’s the second step after he figures out the code and sets the parameters.
With one last, forlorn look at the clock, Steve flings the blankets off his legs, gets out of bed, and stretches.
So Tony hides out there for the next few hours, pestering Bruce while genuinely observing his experiments, and texting Steve off and on, coordinating their plans so they can have their shit together for the meeting they have planned with the rest of the team.
“Well I won’t say we shouldn’t accept temporary help in the middle of a crisis,” Tony says. “That would be—naive, to say the least. Shit happens, very unpredictable shit. But—no, I also don’t think every person we fight alongside should immediately get thrown on the roster.”
“You’re a little shit, you know that?” Bucky asks, but he’s smiling, kind of. Steve can’t help the grin in response, even if it turns into a grimace as a pair of tweezers dig in deep. They’ve developed a rudimentary analgesic for Steve’s metabolism, but it’s not perfect. Partially numbing at best, and it wears off fast.
“Yeah,” Tony says, which—eloquent. When he speaks again, his voice comes out soft, only loud enough to travel the distance it needs to go to get to Steve’s ears. “Don’t think we’d get much say, anyway. There’s a lot we can do, but biblical locales might be the hard limit there.”
“Fuck,” he says, flying up and away, twisting at the same time to look behind him. Two more, bringing the count up to twenty.
“He—” Tony takes a deep breath, shrugs helplessly. “Has a nasty headache. But he’ll definitely live and is probably fine. He’s only here so they can review the scans.”
“I shouldn’t have bothered you,” Tony says, pressing a hand over his eyes, briefly, and he feels downright miserable, but turns away anyway. What did he honestly think was going to happen? Rogers isn’t some magical creature who can fix Tony at will. He’s human, Tony reminds himself.
“They are,” Tony says quickly. “So was I. Just needed a moment to myself, or whatever. Collecting my thoughts.”
There. Casual as can be. He feels like maybe he should be panicking about this, but he doesn’t want to. He wants a beer, and to keep chatting with Scott, and to watch Vision kick Clint’s ass at darts.
“Sorry I’m late,” she says. “Conference call with London went longer than I strictly wanted. They keep thinking they can wait us out and that we’ll donate the reactor.”
“Never,” Steve says, and his voice is still hard, but every part of his expression that was mocking is gone, crumpled very slightly. His voice is softer this time when he says, “Tony.”
“I know,” Tony says calmly, because he does, and he did. That’s why he took on all the stuff he did for the Avengers. Or, it’s at least part of the reason, a part he never thought he would be admitting to. Another part of it was that after New York he needed to keep busy with as much as possible, to stay awake, to keep working, to keep from spiraling down with his thoughts of how hopeless it was going to be to try and go up against an army like the one he’d seen through the wormhole. Another part was the ever-present guilt, the need to make it up to Yinsen, to make himself worthy of Iron Man and the second chance he was rewarded. The last part was the one aware of Nat’s preliminary report, the one that said he wasn’t worthy of being an Avenger, the part of him that was afraid they were going to kick him off the team for just—how he was.
Despite all jokes to the contrary, Tony’s not that small of a man. He’s not super tall, true, but he’s got enough bulk to him that he’s never worried much about it. And he’s been in a bed with men before, of course, but Steve is—different. Rather large, solidly built, exceptionally powerful, even in rest. Tony feels downright wrapped up. Held.
“Aren’t you gonna tuck me in, Tony?” he says, teasing and lighthearted and sleepy, and Tony calls his bluff, stepping forward and floofing the blankets until they sit just right, and then he pats Bruce’s sternum twice. He’s a little softer than Tony remembers him being, time has passed, and neither of them are as young as they were when they faced the Battle of New York.
“Breakfast?” Clint laughs and holds out his box of cereal, gives it a good shake. “It’s only breakfast if you eat something.”
Steve sends back eventually. It’s taken him almost ten minutes to reply even though he read the message right away; he’s guessing Steve spent the time staring at the article and checking to see if it was a satirical website. (Tony suspects Steve doesn’t know his read receipts are on, but Tony’s sure not going to be the one to tell him that.)
“Captain Rogers,” T’Challa says through the comm, “I suggest you take your injured to safety. I can transport the rest to the Avengers compound when this task is complete.”
Tony brings his hands up to cover his eyes, just for a moment as he tells himself to get a fucking grip. This isn’t the kind of fight he’d wanted. It’s all wrong. This isn’t some random asshole in a bar, it’s not even Rhodey. It’s Steve with all twelve shades of blue in his eyes, and Tony wanting to make everyone hurt just as much as he hurts, just like always.
There are a million and a half hospital noises around them, the beeping from hundreds of machines, the dripping of half as many IVs, heels clicking, rubber skidding, wheels turning, every channel of daytime TV, people whispering-talking-crying-laughing. The smells are their own kind of overwhelming, all the sickness and sourness of infection and the worst parts of the human body, overlaid with chemicals and disinfectant and Tony would swear the same exact laundry detergent his first boarding school used.
“Sweet dreams,” Steve says into the skin behind his ear. Tony grips Steve’s hand harder for a moment, fighting off a second shiver, and feels Steve’s mouth curl into a smug smile. (Okay, so he can’t see the smile, but he doesn’t have to be able to see it to know it’s self-satisfied. Because Steve’s an asshole like that.)
“I know,” Tony says instead. “We’ll work it out. I’ll start coming down to the city once or twice a week to the office. Or for board meetings. And you know you’re welcome upstate anytime, right? Because you have probably more security clearance than even I do, y’know.”
By the time Tony’s done with that, there’s half of a pot of coffee, and he snags a quick mugful before replacing the carafe. He slides the mug to Steve, so it sits right in front of his nose, and notes the surprise on Steve’s face as he moves back to stand in front of his collected pile of food with his hands on his hips.
“You stretch yourself too thin,” Steve tells him. Tony’s almost amused by the sentiment, even though he knows he should be annoyed with Steve for thinking he knows anything about Tony’s life. Actually, he is sort of annoyed. The smell of the coffee is starting to reach his brain.
‘Flustered’ isn’t quite right though. Steve looks like someone just kicked a puppy, or like he’s watching someone open fire into a group of grade school kids. It reminds him of the way Steve used to look when talking about Barnes, back before any of them knew he was still alive. And, hey, there’s an idea.
“Okay but why does it sound like you’re about to ask me to murder a man?” Sam says, and he still sounds lighthearted about it, but suspicious, and rightfully so.
It’s bad. It does indeed look like one of the aliens put on a human as a second skin, but it’s worse than that. Effectively dead, Tony thinks, and shudders behind the steady facade of his armor. His working theory is that one of the embryos grew inside its human host and sort of…exploded outwards. The tentacles grew through the human’s arms, and the bug legs are protruding from the person’s flanks. The face still looks more like a hybrid, though, alien eyes and a jaw that opens too wide, a blue-grey tint to the whole thing, but still human enough to make his stomach roll.
Tony doesn’t realize his cup’s tilting until he starts pouring coffee on the ground and it splashes onto his own socks and Steve’s pants. They both jump, and then stare at the ground even after Tony’s stopped spilling.
“I try not to,” Tony says wryly. When he opens his mouth again, he hopes he’s striking a good balance between honesty and not-cruelty. “A few times I did, after that first try with the Accords, but it wasn’t usually the fun or relaxing kind.”
“I started fucking up the vector calculations, Steve,” he says insistently. “JARVIS locked everything down? He said it was a protocol for when I’m mentally impaired, but this is just mutiny—I’m not done yet—”
Steve raises his hands like he’s surrendering and Tony thinks, no, that’s not right. Steve doesn’t do that, doesn’t back down, especially not from Tony.
Tony Stark is a man of forward momentum, a self-proclaimed futurist. At the same time that he’s telling himself to suck it up and get on with his life, to accept this for what it is so he can move on to whatever shitshow is inevitably next, this feels like going backwards. This looks like the Merchant of Death staring back at him, feels like he’s lost something precious. Dark hair, dark eyes, smooth skin. He looks
“Come on,” Steve says again, eyes half open, voice kind but low. His breath feels so very heated where it brushes Tony’s spit-wet lips.
That feels like an invasion of privacy. Tony knows any messages were meant for him, but considering how desperate Steve seemed for a hot minute there, it doesn’t feel right to review the buildup.
thank you guys for all the wonderful, productive conversations in the comments! i really enjoyed hearing from everyone last week. i'm going to try to keep to a monday update schedule, loosely.
“Hey,” Tony says mildly, “he’s been working on it. Using language to communicate instead of his fists and everything. Speaking of—”
“Since immediately after being released from the rubble,” she says. Steve’s eyes slip shut. Too long, much too long. Then again, five seconds would be too long in this hell.
“Listen, man, Captain America is a lotta things, but stupid isn’t one of them.” Tony opens his mouth, but Rhodey continues before he can say a word, “And neither is cruel, Tones. He’s not gonna repeat history if he can help it.”
There’s the prick of a needle, four of them, and Tony grits his teeth. Ideally, there would be a dozen or more needles; it would be safer that way, to spread the dose out through his body, but Tony never knows how much damage the suit will take or which parts will get knocked out of commission. (Also, Tony dislikes needles, so sue him.) They hold for a moment, and then retreat.
“I’m not opposed,” Thor says. “I’ve often wished for such a thing while preparing to become a ruler.”
Wanda’s terrifyingly powerful and also out of control. Tony’s opinion is that she’s not equipped emotionally to be on this team, but he knows that’s a fight he can’t win. There aren’t many fights he can seem to win lately (against the Avengers, that is; he can win fights against Ross and the UN and the entirety of the United States, but the Avengers are a different story). He can foresee the defenses, or at least some of them; she’s part of this team too, Tony; she doesn’t have anywhere else to go, Tony; if she’s not on the team they’ll try to hold her responsible for Lagos, Tony; you killed her parents, Tony, she didn’t mean it. Each and every one punctuated by a disappointed sigh, all in Rogers’ impatient voice or snapped out in Barton’s, sharp as ice.
Steve to come in, more than almost anything. He wants it with the same corner of his brain that asked for Steve at the gala, but the rest of him, the part of him that feels like he’s vibrating out of his skin, that feels on edge and wrong, recognizes that it probably wouldn’t end well. He wants contact, wants to be anchored, but doesn’t know where he stands with Steve right now, in the light of day, and Steve looks just as unsure as Tony feels. Besides, it’s a tossup of whether Tony would actually feel anchored or if it would feel more like held down, trapped.
“Baby steps,” Tony says, praying to God it’s not offensive in some way. The weirdest things piss off parents, and even weirder things seem to get under Clint’s skin.
“Believe me when I say I’m trying,” Tony says. He gives in then, because it looks like this is going to be a Conversation, so he swings his legs up onto the bed and leans back so the footboard digs into the small of his back.
“Where to?” Tony sniffs. Rhodey dips his head to the side like he’s trying to pour water out of his ear.
The plan Steve lays out isn’t perfect—Tony’s pretty sure a perfect plan doesn’t exist for this situation—but it’s pretty good. He suggests team forums and a more democratic process for deciding on new team members in which everyone at least gets to be heard. The core members should get veto power, or weighted votes somehow, Steve reasons, because they, after all, have been around from the start and all passed Fury’s and (more stringent still) Coulson’s screenings for the original Initiative. Of course, emergencies are still emergencies, and they both acknowledge that things will happen. Temporary alliances and team-ups are par for the course at this point, the difference now being that, after the crisis has been averted, there will be a process to instate members officially.
“And what is the point, then?” Steve says, but he looks encouraged by Tony’s statement for some reason. Tony has no idea how Steve is interpreting his words, vague as they are.
“The trial where we’re alone and emotionally vulnerable has been—overdone,” Tony says slowly, more carefully.
He really is burning from the inside out, hot and blistering, and he can’t help but remember Pepper’s face when she’d cried out for him, glowing and hurt and strapped to a table.
“Did I die?” Tony asks. He means it as a joke, but, “Sorry, that’s not funny. But seriously, you look like you’re planning a funeral all the way over there.”
Steve leads them to Tony’s room where he crowds Tony against the dresser to kiss him. One of the knobs presses into the small of his back, but he pulls Steve against him harder anyway. Even that goes on for a while before Tony remembers himself and nudges until Steve lets himself be manhandled to the bed, and then Tony’s straddling his hips, hovering over Steve, and that’s amazing, that’s
It lunges. Tony tilt his wrists just enough to fire the repulsors, more out of reflex than anything. It only burns some of the human skin over the thing’s armored chest, but otherwise glances off. The alien collides with Tony, then, sending him back into and halfway through the wall of the office. He shakes his head to clear it, but then the alien’s on him, screaming and gripping the shoulders of the armor. His shoulder screams and he feels something deep inside him grind at the rough movement.
“Yeah, well.” Tony holds his mug close to his chest. It’s too hot to drink, but he breathes in deep to ground himself in the familiar smell. “I do. I mind it.” Tony thinks he should sound more bitter, but he doesn’t have the energy for it yet today. “Here’s the compromise: no more broken bones and let’s keep it off national news.”
“Tony,” he says. Tony stumbles out into the penthouse, eyes glassy, no evidence that he’s heard Steve at all. Steve’s smile softens and he steps forward to get in Tony’s path. It’s ridiculously adorable, really, the way Tony’s hair stands up like a sleepy mad scientist and the smudge of whatever-that-is high on his cheekbone. Tony blinks at Steve’s mouth a couple times—not suggestively, that’s just eye-level for Tony—before looking up to meet Steve’s eyes.
hellO! i know it's been forever (again) but listen: i quit my job, broke up w/ my SO, moved halfway across the country, and got a new job since i last updated this fic. finally settling in, thank the gods.
Tony’s there long enough that others start filtering through for coffee and food. Thor comes through first, and is endlessly courteous to Vision even as he accepts the offer of french toast. He grabs some of his own coffee and comes to sit at the table. Clint’s calmed down a bit by that point (or, at least, Vision seems to have gotten the hang of french toast and doesn’t need the constant supervision anymore) and is doing a Q&A on Twitter. In Tony’s absence, they’ve all been given PR Bootcamp packets and at least Clint seems to be taking it seriously. Tony assumes it’s part of his agreement with Laura, but it’s nice, either way, to have someone else care about this sort of thing.
“Happened to me a lot right after Rebirth,” Steve said eventually. “One of the only physical downsides to the serum.” Tony picked up a banana from the bowl behind Steve and started to peel it. “Really thought I was dying the first time, like maybe my senses would keep enhancing right up until they killed me.”
“Good morning, Tony,” Vision says. Tony jerks back to reality to find that—no time has passed. Vision is still mid-pour at the sink, sharing a look with Tony.
“At the Malibu house,” he amends before Steve can get sarcastic again. His speech is halting, even to his own ears, and he pauses to click his teeth together and swallow. “Even to FRIDAY, for almost a month? I didn’t talk until yesterday.”
“Thanks,” Steve says, and he rolls his eyes for good measure because Tony can probably hear those kinds of things through the receiver too (and Sam’s still standing int he doorway, but he’s backing away now that he knows the world isn’t ending).
Anyway, only Sam actually comes by; Steve seems intent to suffer through the reams of legal jargon on his own, Wanda’s got Natasha, Scott flew the coop the morning after
That still leaves Aquila a huge question mark, though. (God, he doesn’t know; this is why he wasn’t a lit major.)
Then he catches sight of Pepper. She’s pale, rigid against the wall, staring at some place right over Tony’s bed, and he replays what Bruce just said in his head.
“Buck,” he says. He wants to crouch on the floor and cry like he’s five again. He wants to punch Bruce a little bit, and fight his way back into Tony’s room so he’s not alone anymore.
“Nice look,” Rhodey says, and Tony remembers he’s wearing two t-shirts, his boxers, and mismatched socks.
“Oh,” Tony says again, and turns on his rock-stool so he can replace his elbow with his forehead on Steve’s shoulder, willing his tears to evaporate before they spill over.
The CPD have more lights set up now, but there’s thunder rolling in the distance and clouds blocking the light from the moon.
“You know what that was.” Tony raised an eyebrow and Steve looked like he had half a lemon in his mouth.
“This part’s beyond me,” Bruce says. “I’ve told them everything they’ll need for the Extremis. All I’m doing is making the doctors nervous.”
Deciding he’s adequately bolstered, Tony straightens and goes to his dresser, throwing on sweats and changing into one of his baggier t-shirts, washed-out black with a string of tiny holes near the collar. It doesn’t exactly hang on him, but it doesn’t fit either, per se.
“Suddenly?” Tony laughs like he's drowning and the armor bursts into the room. He doesn’t assemble the armor around him, just has it stand sentry beyond his right shoulder and stare Steve in the face. Steve’s eyes flicker from man to machine and back again.
“Every kind,” Tony says. In that moment Steve looks like he needs a minute to absorb that information despite being the more caffeinated of the two of them, and Tony turns his back and fixes his own cup of coffee. Stirring in sugar, he’s hit with the mental image of a hot tub full of coffee, smelling rich and dark but being sweet to the taste. It’s a stupid detail, not something he thinks is really worth remembering, but it brings with it the memory of being trapped in the locked up suit, hovering over Steve after having tackled him to the ground, being stuck with him.
“What do you need?” Steve asks, and now he’s talking slowly too, hesitantly, like he’s wading into water he knows is piranha infested.
Steve and Vis greet him, Bruce grumbles something from his spot at the counter, but Tony knows not to be offended; that’s just how Bruce is in the mornings.
Tony does, the hand already on Steve going around his waist to lay flat against his shoulder blade, his forehead curling down to Steve’s chest. Steve’s hand slips up to Tony’s bicep, thumb brushing back and forth soothingly. Steve’s breaths don’t move him, but they do press them together more firmly. Outwardly, Tony knows he’s coming across as less feral than in Steve’s office, and he wills himself to settle. Deliberately, he matches their breathing, following Steve’s example, and waits as patiently as he can for his heart to fall for the trick, relaxing and slowing.
“Scratch that,” Tony says. Steve’s hand comes up to rest over Tony’s, though he looks wary. “The last couple minutes, just, cross that out. Temporary insanity or—something.”
“Jacket off,” Tony says as an afterthought. Bucky reaches for the zipper immediately, eyes on the bot.
“We’re right here,” he said slowly. Tony was almost afraid someone was going to call him out for being rude, but Sam looked just as put out by it.
Bucky starts hovering from half a room away the second they enter, and Tony gently pushes Steve off toward the couch Bucky’s sitting on, remembering himself and Rhodey, the blood-crystalizing fear Tony gets when he wakes from a nightmare of Rhodey falling, falling,
“A natural leader,” Steve says again, quietly. There’s less acid in the words, but he still looks mad, just—deflated too.
“And I know,” Tony continues quickly, seeing the storm in Steve’s eyes, the tightening of his bottom lip, “you weren’t having fun in Siberia. I know you didn’t ask me to build the arm. I
“She gave me ideas,” Tony says, declares, and Bruce buries his head in his arms on the counter with an appropriate level of suspicion and resignation, thank you, Bruce.
And he remembers, with a jolt. The woman being worn as a second skin, fighting next to Wanda, Thor’s new haircut, Steve under a building, a stinging, burning horror in his leg, FRIDAY
“You know you’ll still have to do a writeup,” Steve points out, sounding only a little like a tired parent. Clint flaps a hand dismissively.
It takes a while to find his body, and when he does he spends some time convincing it that he’s alive. He clenches the muscles in one shoulder, releases, and then the other. Then the same thing with his legs, until he’s almost rocking side to side in micro movements. He scrunches his nose, too. That tingling is still there. Numbness, kind of. A form of numbness.
“I need to go home,” Tony says, feeling immeasurably tired, and sad and angry and hurt and grateful, but mostly tired. He smiles over at Steve and lets his head roll against the short wall behind him. Steve nods, a crease between his eyebrows. He nods, but he doesn’t get up. Instead, he pulls out his phone and taps on it for a few seconds. When he sets his cell down on the ground by his hip, he looks up at Tony and gives the smallest smile.
“How’s our little band of misfits doing?” he asks, going for chipper. Thankfully, FRIDAY’s never known him as anything other than a glorified hot mess, so she rolls with it.
The man's smiling down at the arm, inspecting it more closely now, touching, checking the finger joints and the range of motion, looking pleased if a little tense.
“Yeah, no,” Tony says. “Far as I know, Jesus never ripped a man’s arm off.” Bucky snorts and Tony feels something in the atmosphere relax. “But what do I know; it’s been a while since I sat down with a Bible.”
Phone in hand, he eases the bathroom door open and slips back into Steve’s room, drawn to the bed—drawn to Steve—like someone’s magnetized the iron in their blood. Having taken in most of what Steve’s wall and desk have to offer in the way of scenery, Tony crawls back into bed, burying his face in Steve’s shoulder, one arm tucked under his head and the other around Steve’s ribs so his hand rests on the man’s shoulder blade. Steve shuffles around to accommodate, though he never opens his eyes.
No medication allergies. Yes, he does have a history of head trauma (they all do at this point). He’s not on any medications. No pre-existing conditions.
“Everyone seems to be having a genuinely good time," Steve says, a little unsure or defensive or—something.
“Elated,” Tony says. She doesn’t even pretend to look at Sam this time. There’s a pressure building around Tony’s head like a vice. He swallows. The girl’s eyes squint she’s beaming so hard.
“Stark.” He nods and doesn’t say anything scathing, which is actually a huge improvement over the harshness of the civil war and the cold quiet of this last mishap.
There, in the middle of what used to be a Chicago street, is Thor and the Hulk. Thor’s in a defensive stance, legs spread wide, center of gravity low, Mjölnir in hand, and the Hulk’s breathing heavily, hands curled into fists as his head swivels around to take in the situation.
He does neither. He moves back half a step to let her in, she doesn’t apologize but she does enter, and they dance around each other for four days before Natasha decides enough is enough. It’s well after midnight and well before dawn when she shows up in the workshop, eyes growing wide when her old codes still get her in (Tony knows, there’s video proof, he’s seen it). Tony turns to meet her and she’s brought coffee, doesn’t even try to hand it to him, just sets it on the nearest workbench, and Tony’s heart warms despite himself. Probably because he’s had no other human interaction in those four days, but still.
It won’t be like that, he thinks firmly. He’s already got people on his side, Sam and Steve and Rhodey. And even if Steve’s being guided by some guilt-fueled martyrdom (this is a morning for worst-case scenarios), Sam and Rhodey are both solidly sensible and eloquent people. They should be able to assuage some fears. The doubt persists, though.
He tries to roll out from under it, but he’s still in the middle of a half-demolished wall. Bits of the hybrid fall onto him, and he has to use both arms to push the bulk of it off, yelling as he does so. He uses the repulsors to propel himself to standing again, instead of putting any more weight on his arms.
“Just a few, ’kay?” Tony said. Steve and Natasha, surprised he was awake, or listening, or something, paused.
“My poor mom juggled me and Howard best she could,” Tony says and, in retrospect, it is kind of funny. “But, y’know, she only really signed up to raise one kid, not the two she ended up with.”
Taking a moment to parse how he feels, he dips to almost the speed limit as he considers. His feet still feel pretty firmly planted on the ground. Maybe he’s a little fuzzier—pun intended—and a little less put-together, but. He figures he’ll live.
But the important part of that sentence is that Tony’s alone with one James Buchanan Barnes in the dead of night and he’d be on edge if he hadn’t been on edge all damn day. As it is, he stops dead in his tracks makes eye contact with the man, who’s sitting on the big couch and staring at the TV that’s not on.
how come no one thought of them? Why wouldn’t Sam himself bring them up? “You remember having any turns in the rota? On
“How long has he been back here?” Steve asks, methodically moving his eyes over the rest of Tony’s body, cataloging the small cuts and abrasions.
Tony grabs onto Steve’s forearm, and then slowly lowers back down, Steve flat on his back, Tony curled over him. Steve’s back arched, Tony pressing down.
“Morning, Thor,” Steve says, and smiles back, though he’s shuffling his feet and generally being sleepy all over the place, radiating—not quite resignation, but the vibe of being just along for the ride on this one.
“That should do it,” Tony says, and he steps closer to help Bucky out of the arm. “Give me—a couple days? Then we can do a more thorough check of fine motor skills and proprioception when the thing actually fits.”
It’s just after 5 PM when a doctor comes in to give Steve the all-clear and raise his eyebrows disapprovingly at Tony’s choice of seat, and about 6 when the last of the paperwork has been signed.
Slowly, beside him, Steve settles, slows down, and starts brushing his thumb across Tony’s hand. Tony gives him a couple minutes more after that.
Scott got to the scene first, and then Tony only seconds later.  The rest of the Avengers are still a few minutes out, so Scott and Tony do a flyover and start relaying observations to everyone. They look frankly disgusting, but that information isn’t particularly helpful. He sees what looks like a National Guard member caught in an alien’s grip, trashing and struggling, and Tony’s about to swoop in when the man goes still and limp—only for the alien to go down, hard, loosening its grip as it starts to writhe in pain. There, across the street, the cop that just shot the thing cleanly in the eye. The National Guard officer rolls swiftly away from the dying alien.
“Of course you do,” she says, smiling again, but it’s weaker this time, doesn’t get rid of the crease in her brow.
Natasha doesn’t say anything for a moment, just searches his face with a few quick flicks of her eyes. She clenches her jaw when she’s done and walks towards him, long strides and swinging arms. Tony takes an aborted step back before he can stop himself.
“Reality TV’s fuckin’ crazy,” Bucky says in conclusion. On screen, a blonde woman just showed up uninvited to the brunette’s lunch gathering. Tony can feel the tension from his chair and he makes note of which women at the table make meaningful eye contact with one another like ‘oh Jesus, not again’ and which look like they want to start chanting for a fight. Tony’s been to his fair share of these kinds of get togethers, but this is normally the point he starts drinking seriously, with intent, or otherwise finds a way to excuse himself. It’s admittedly much more amusing with the screen in between him and the drama. Natasha breezes through sometime during the second episode to make herself some tea.
“Language,” Tony says, and it’s hard to breathe all over again. It takes a little longer to get under control this time.
“Stop,” Tony says, orders. It’s too loud, it echoes, but he can’t go in circles forever. “Cap, I’m tired.”
“Maximoff,” he says sharply. Her eyes close tightly and she lets out a pained noise on the exhale. He shouts when the rerebrace folds in over his bicep. The pauldron goes a few seconds later, and he doesn’t scream this time; the air feels like it’s been sucked from his lungs. That’s my collarbone, he thinks helplessly.
Tony swallows and grits his teeth. Wanda’s not a kid, but she’s young. Tony thinks he knows how this has to play out, whether there’s someone still in there or not.
“I’m—eh—excited isn’t the right word,” Sam says. “But I’m relieved we’re finally having a real meeting, if those notes say anything I think they do.”
Clint holds up his coffee and his free hand in surrender, but there’s that smile on his face that means he’s going to do the exact opposite of what Tony says.
And, okay, maybe Steve’s just that fucking incredible, but maybe Tony regrew most of his body and these cells have never been turned on before (sue him, he’s been a little busy). He feels every square inch of his body light up, spark, focal points on anything touching Steve, but aware of the rest ,too.
Fuck, Tony thinks. He’s been here for not quite an entire hour, and knows at least another hour’s expected of him. It’s not a hard thing; he can do this in his sleep, with his hands tied behind his back, blind drunk—and, hey, maybe that’s the problem here. He takes a deep breath in and tells himself to hold it until he comes to his senses.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony says, and notices that Steve and Rhodey are the only ones who look relaxed. “The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated. Again. What’s new.”
“Here I am,” Tony agrees. Steve’s already in casual clothes, out of the sweats he wears for his morning workouts. He’s smiling too, so Tony smiles back in the hazy, honest way he can before he’s caffeinated. These are the easiest times between them since Steve’s come back, Tony’s found, when it’s too late or too early, and reality’s warped.
“But nothing,” Tony says firmly. “There is no ‘but.’ I’m trying to—not overthink. To just have a good time and not be a bitter bitch about it all and wonder why this was so impossible before, or assume they only like me right now because you visibly like me right now. I’m being
“It’s a work in progress,” Tony admits, thinking of the haunted look on Steve’s face when he thinks Tony isn’t watching, the way he
He thinks of Rhodey at MIT and the way-too-fun mutual destruction that was their college years, partying hard and propping each other up on the way back to the dorms, making each other drink water and puking at the sight of each other’s puke. He thinks of Jarvis—human Jarvis, Edwin—who had the most solid presence Tony’s ever experienced, the perfect way he knew how to tuck Tony in as a kid, something his mom could never even do quite right. He thinks of her, too, and he misses her, and it stings, but not as much as it has lately when he thinks of her carrying him to his room, sick with a fever but stubbornly refusing to go to bed before his bedtime, the way she checked his temperature with forehead kisses.
(life update in case anyone's keeping up: i drove halfway across the country, moved in, and had my first day of classes today. i'm currently at work, but it's 9pm and there's hardly anybody at the library, so here i am)
“What do you want?” she demands, wild-eyed and the air around her is more obviously snapping with energy now.
a longer chapter finally! i meant to get this up last night but instead i slept for about 13 hours after being awake for 32, so whatever.
He has FRIDAY call for his private jet instead of just taking the suit; the gash in his side is still healing and sustained flight isn’t going to help right now. The crew even has time to file a flight plan. Pepper used to give him shit about that a lot, especially between Afghanistan and their breakup. She’d point out how often he seems to go missing, and at least he could fly IFR and give them a viable starting point when he inevitably drops off the face of the planet again.
“After Loki,” Steve says, “I thought I finally had you nailed down, but I honestly. I really don’t know how I came to the conclusion that your weight was so much more than anyone else’s. Than mine, even when I thought I was the natural leader of the group.”
“I can tell just by looking at you that you’re dehydrated,” Steve says, eyes lingering on her fluttering eyelids and chapped lips. He runs a hand down his face. “And you’ve been awake for at least twenty-four hours by this point.” And that gives Steve pause. He looks up at Sam, who’s now snoring lightly, head tipped back at an odd angle. They’ve all been up for too long, they’ve all dealt with too much in the past twelve hours.
“Um,” Peter says, after another short lapse of silence. His voice is pitched higher than normal, reminding Tony of the first time they met. “How would that work with—how would I—”
Despite just having been asleep (more or less) for days, Tony’s tired. At least emotionally, he’s wrung out. And he wants to ask Bruce’s advice on a couple points, but he really doesn’t think either of them are ready for that at the moment.
“Yep,” Tony says, and he would be amused by just how flustered Steve looks if he wasn’t so off-balance already.
“—not even Rhodey knew until pretty recently, so I hardly think I can be blamed for not knowing, because Rhodey always catches on before me somehow—”
is what Thor calls bacon when he’s trying to be charming. Rolling his eyes, Tony moves past the living room to the kitchen. He starts a pot of coffee and sets to piling breakfast ingredients onto the island, pulling out anything he can find that even slightly plays into the meal as far as he can recall. Steve sits at one of the barstools, leaning on his elbows on the countertop, though he’s smiling just the slightest bit, just enough that Tony thinks he’s not doing it on purpose.
He’s five minutes late getting to Marcel’s, though he still seems to have beaten Pepper there. After surveying the place, he grabs a coffee from the counter and picks the most inconspicuous table in the corner to sit at.
The question comes to Tony’s mind, unbidden, unhelpful: what side would Thor have picked? He could be as hotheaded as Steve sometimes, hated to be controlled—hell, the man had refused the throne on Asgard a couple times to maintain his freedom. On the other hand, though, Thor has always tried to respect Earth’s customs, and his journey to being a hero had a lot to do with cooling that hot head of his, learning diplomacy and when to use it over his hammer.
This was not the conversation Tony’d been gearing himself up for. He came ready to talk about the issue of the people-wanting-him-dead circle and the people-who-are-Avengers circle overlapping just a little too much for his liking, and he was prepared to fight for his assertion that they all desperately need an outside mental health professional keeping tabs on them—not whatever the hell this is.
He goes up to his room and wonders after his freakout in the shop the day before. Things are better now, or at least pointed in the right direction, but there’s still a disconnect buried in there somewhere for Tony, an uncertainty lurking around, nipping at his ankles. He doesn’t know if there’s anything he can do to get it to go away entirely, but he’s tired of the way it keeps knocking him on his ass.
“Did you say Spider-Man?” Sam says, sitting up a little straighter in his seat. “Where the hell’s he been? I need a rematch.”
“Come on, lay down, close your eyes,” Tony says. Bruce shuffles down on the bed, still in his lab clothes, and wiggles around enough to get the covers out from underneath him.
The doctor comes back eventually, when Tony’s head is buzzing and his skin is full of static. He stands aside as the doctor rouses Steve, who knows his own name, what year it is (after a flash of panic that has Tony stepping forward into plain view), though not exactly where he is.
“Yes, okay, I was a teenager, what do you expect from me? No,” Tony says immediately. “Don’t answer that. Just come look at your new arm.”
Steve guides them all the way back to the living quarters. Tony turns instinctually when they’re next to his door and Steve, who was making a beeline for his own room, pauses, looking mildly alarmed. His eyes flicker from Tony to Tony’s door to Steve’s own door and back to Tony. It’s so ridiculous Tony thinks it might be cute and holy actual fuck Rhodey was right. Tony’s fucked.
“Hill was right,” Tony says, and hates himself for making this call because there’s a chance, there’s a chance someone was still in there, still trapped. But he remembers the skin torn to shreds, how pained Wanda sounded when she was in its head. And this way, nobody else has to make the call. “Once a person’s infected they’re effectively dead.”
They’d worked for a couple hours more before Howard had sent Tony, yawning and clumsy fingered, up to bed with a bid not to tell Maria they’d stayed up so late. He’d smiled halfway as he’d said it, and Tony had grinned back conspiratorially, and negotiated successfully: his silence for a late-night Dr. Pepper.
(And then, of course, there’s the tiny faction of old-SHIELD still following legally-dead-Nick-Fury around, but that’s another problem entirely.)
They could probably say that about any of us, Steve decides. That they’re unstable, just a bunch of suicidal assholes. That thought, strangely, doesn’t make him feel any better.
“You think?” Steve asks, head cocked to the side and tone a match for Tony’s. His smile is less smug now and more joy—the kind that makes his eyes sparkle even though he’s not really about to cry. Relief and lightness and curiosity.
Clint’s moved back onto a rooftop, lower to the street this time, a perfunctory precaution against the lightning lighting up the sky, but things go smoother with his voice in their ears. He catches patterns first and describes them best. Tony thinks he might’ve broken a couple ribs, too, but nobody says it outright.
Tony laughs, and it’s only a small huff of air but it’s a genuine laugh; no one’s watching, and it feels good.
“Just keep him calm and resting,” the nurse says to him as she pulls a privacy curtain around Steve’s bed in the ER. “With the accelerated healing, this is all just precautionary, but with the vomiting and how long he was unconscious, a CT is just standard procedure. Right now, we’re just waiting for a machine to free up.”
“Oh, fuck off.” Tony drains the second half of his mug and lets it hit the counter like a shot glass.
So he snaps his fingers and makes a super swaggy exit from the bedroom to go find himself some dinner while pointedly not making it weird.
“Well, if you’re sure.” To Tony’s relief, Steve sounds lighter, amused. Maybe it’s a little forced, but Tony doesn’t even give a shit. Forced ease is better than panic as far as he’s concerned.
When Tony starts walking between two rows of apple trees, Steve follows, even though Tony’s never been to this part of the compound before.
Except they hadn’t quite grasped what “emergency” meant, though. Steve kept breaking in, sometimes to drag Tony upstairs for bonding time, sometimes to make sure he was taking care of himself, sometimes just to sit quietly while Tony worked. Tony had stopped being so suspicious of it (especially since all the dragging Steve had been doing was more metaphorical than physical) and had mostly accepted it as guilt-driven care on Steve’s part, but that didn’t mean he liked it.
Everything feels surreal, a little far away. He doesn’t know if it’s due to the anticlimactic ending to the fight, the pain pushing out a wave of endorphins, the exhaustion soaking in the last of his adrenaline, or all of the above. He’s guessing all of the above. Overall, Thor’s group looks stressed and exhausted, but no worse than when they went underground.
“Forget about who’s responsible for it!” Steve says, and his voice is raised to match Tony’s. “What if I just don’t want you to feel like that?”
“The guy with seemingly endless money and just as much power. If there’s a problem, why haven’t you fixed it already?”
“Nope,” he says. “We talk about things, though. Problem solve. And—some of the feelings, anyway. I don’t know if we talk about all of them, or just around some of them.”
to escape the reality of fighting all around him. He narrowed his field of vision down to the circuits in front of his face and distracted himself with beautiful people and beautiful things and beautiful code and substances that make all of those beautiful things downright heavenly. He did this for years, and only allowed Pepper and Obie to pull his attention away for as long as it took to find the answer to the problem he was given, and not a second more.
“I’ll walk with you,” Tony says. She doesn’t object and it’s only a few blocks back to the main SI offices. Tony revels in the feeling of the city; he’s been a rather impressive hermit this year. Probably not good for the company image that he’s been MIA. Pepper must really have been worried about him to not have brought it up at all. He resolves to do better, now that he’s not afraid in his own home and doesn’t think he’s going to drop dead or lose his mind.
“No,” Tony says, “there’s no green. Just blue, I swear to God. And my vision has recently improved by a factor of about ten. I’m a color
“I never knew,” he says slowly, thinking of how much he shouldn’t be confessing this, “how much pain I was in until I wasn’t.”
“It’s not like Sam or Scott ever volunteered for Nazi experimentation specifically as part of a ploy to exact revenge on an existing member of the team.”
He sees his opening to leave and takes it, striding toward the elevator only to be stopped by Steve’s hand on his shoulder. Or, Steve’s hand in front of his shoulder. Tony more runs into the flat of Steve’s palm than he’s actually grabbed by the man. It knocks the breath out of him ever-so-slightly, but it gets his attention.
Steve crosses his arms and leans against the doorframe. Tony should invite him in, but he’s not sure if he wants to. Oh, in an abstract, fantastical and frantic way, he
Steve’s reality swoops again. He might be crashing, finally. Bruce is right, though. Bruce is right, and Tony would’ve died, should’ve died, but he didn’t, and he’s right beyond that door, probably still fading in and out of consciousness, afraid and hurt and he probably thought he was dying alone next to that broken beer bottle, and why the hell does Steve even remember the beer bottle, it doesn’t matter.
“Guys,” Clint says, right as the thunder sounds, just about drowning him out. Tony tunes in, though. There’s something about Clint’s tone, something different. Still cautious and weary and pained, but there’s an urgency to it, a hope they haven’t heard in hours. Clint doesn’t say anything else, though.
And that’s about the last thing he wants, so he turns on his heel and continues along. Natasha, out of either mercy or apathy (and, really, Tony’s occupying two realities right now; either one is just as likely as the other), doesn’t say a word as he turns to leave.
“Any second,” Clint says. He crouches down on Tony’s other side, falling heavily to his knees and swaying worryingly when he gets there. “They were on standby. We’re gonna load ‘im into the Quinjet. They’re lending us a pilot and some medical personnel to get back to the compound.”
“He hasn’t been down yet, at least,” Steve says. Tony hums from behind his mug. “It’s a little early,” he says pointedly.
“No entry beyond this point, Captain,” the woman says. She’s dressed unassumingly but Steve can see the outline of her tac-gear under her civvies. “The doctors need to run some tests.”
“And Rogers?” he says. “I don’t give a shit how he wakes up as long as he wakes up. I’ve been disobeying direct orders to protect my friend for just as long as you have.”
His statement rings heavily in the air, long enough for the bird Tony’s watching to get bored and fly away. It’s Tony laying out what he needs, his conditions. He thinks it’s completely fair to say they can’t continue on the way they have been. They’re doomed to fail—a time bomb, like Bruce foresaw years ago at the very beginning.
hope it was a chapter worth waiting for! and thank you to everyone reading, i appreciate you all so much<3
Tony unfolds himself from the chair, stands with his fingers hooked into Steve’s belt loops. When he exhales, it feels like relief. When Steve’s hands slide down from Tony neck, over his shoulders to his arms, his wrists, his hands, and untangles them from his pants, when his smirk turns more playful, more mischievous than tender, and that—it takes some of the pressure off the situation, just a bit, so Tony doesn’t feel like he’s quite so exposed. Steve walks backward the entire way to the elevator, only turning slightly and freeing one of his hands to call it, moving the other to the small of Tony’s back.
“So it’s visible to Richards,” Clint says, because SHIELD ‘monitors potential threats,’ and the rivalry between Doom and Richards counts, childish as they both are. Probably because of how childish they both are.
“Mr. Stark?” Peter says, and he sounds downright out of breath. Alarm sparks all the way down Tony’s spine. He puts the flat of his hand on the island and wills it to ground him.
“My sweet little what now?” Sam says, but he’s already heading in that direction, so Tony just laughs. He feels high on adrenaline, and like he’s home, like he’s alive and engaged in the world, like the gang’s back together. And he just might commission a massive, renaissance-esque painting of a cherub rodeo for Clint’s birthday.
The sink turns off and his stomach swoops in response. He rolls fully onto his back, closes his eyes, and takes a careful breath. Slowly in, in, in, and past the point that used to stretch his lungs. There’s so much room there now, he can breathe so deeply it’s astonishing, and still surprising somehow if he pays attention to it.
“Just me,” Tony calls softly in the direction of the ensuite, pulling the door shut behind him. That door’s open, too, the sounds of the sink and a toothbrush floating out. Tony forgot to brush his own teeth, but it’s too late now. He’s here and he needs to stay here or he really might bolt.
All-in-all, Steve is a whole and complete person in Tony’s eyes-ears-nose-brain now, maybe for the first time ever. He’s not an old war story from Howard, or Fury’s lapdog, or even Cap. He’s Steve, with all that could possibly mean, and Tony wishes he’d brought the HUD glasses with him after all. He wants to catalogue all of this, feels it desperately, this needs to be saved. (And, truth be told, Tony could do with the extra wall between him and Steve; he fears he might’ve gotten rid of one too many defenses.)
Steve’s bed smells like him, vaguely like his shampoo, earthy and light. Tony imagines never smelling it again, of having gotten to this point and then leaving it behind. Moreover, Steve’s right to ask. He’s being fair and opening yet another channel of communication between them in the process, or trying to. Uncomfortable though it may be, Tony knows talking—and being honest about it—is the thing that needs to be done here.
“Why do you want to know?” Tony asks eventually. There’s another beat of silence, and Tony thinks this isn’t how their conversations used to be, filled with so much dead air, but maybe it’s for the best.
“Are we?” Tony asks, half bitter and half curious. He takes a deep breath, feels like he’s burning from the inside out. Steve huffs and his eyelids flutter.
The air isn’t cold, but it is on the cooler side, which he finds strange. He would have thought Steve would keep his room warm; the man really does hate being cold, this is something Tony knows to be true, has seen in action. He is a living furnace, though. It must make it hard to sleep in a warm environment. Plus, the cool air makes it easier to be pressed together like this.
that. There’s a crease between Steve’s eyebrows but not in same way as when he’s angry or disappointed. It’s frustration, Tony thinks, and something else.
“FRIDAY,” Tony says, staring down at Steve, the way his eyes are scrunched up and the way his nose is wrinkled against the dust he’s breathing in, “lock the joints.”
“I do,” Sam says, holding his hands up in admittance. “And for that, you got thrown in the RAFT and spent how long on the run, away from your daughter?”
Vision doesn’t answer and if there’s one trait he got from JARVIS it’s that they can insert smugness into silence so that even Tony can hear it, so he lifts his head and finally notices that they’re in his bedroom, Vision’s floated them across the floor and through the walls like the world’s sneakiest air hockey puck. Tony huffs a laugh that ends in a yawn.
“Hold up,” Tony says, because Sam seems honest most of the time and open right now. Sam looks back at him, head tilted, and he leans in the elevator’s doorway so it doesn’t close him in or out. (It wouldn’t anyway, because FRIDAY’s running it, but the habit’s familiar to most people and hard to break.)
“Why?” Clint throws back incredulously. “So he—so you can all use her as an excuse? There’s no need to single her out like that! She—”
“Tony injected himself with a dose,” Steve says. “It’s—hard to explain. There's a file I can get you, though. I think it’s the only thing keeping him alive.”
Steve is an adult, his own person, and—Tony knows—would be throwing himself in danger’s way no matter his affiliation with Tony. Not that Happy and Rhodey aren’t their own willful creatures too, but Tony’s always felt like he dragged them into this nonsense at least a little. With Steve he has to admit the situation’s different.
He must’ve fallen asleep at some point because the next thing he knew, there were fingers combing through his hair (which was frankly gross with dried sweat) and a soft voice in his ear.
Tony almost wants to argue that he’s a heavy hitter here, alright, he doesn’t need to be in the outfield, but he also figures he did most of the legwork before they showed up so he can take a least a minute.
The pot doesn’t explode for three and a half minutes, so he pours himself a cup, which he then carries to the dining table with a StarkPad.
“You never just lay in bed for a while for the hell of it, do you?” Steve says. “Would it actually kill you?”
“FRIDAY, reroute power to reactor.” He stops, listens for the whine of it powering up. Then he fires when the thing’s face is aligned.
Steve nodded, eyes wandering and expression thoughtful. Tony made his way into the kitchen and Steve followed. Steve ended up leaning against the counter while Tony rummaged idly through the fridge. Hot chocolate sounded good but also like a lot of work. He also knew from experience that if he didn’t eat something sugary now he’d feel hungover in the morning.
Tony moves around the perimeter of the room to stand behind the thing. The only sounds are his heavy, clanking footsteps and the infected’s struggling hisses. He sets his feet wide, brings his arms up, and takes a deep breath.
“Make thicker helmets?” Tony guesses, because as much as he’s pretty sure at this point that the conversation has nothing to do with the helmets, he kind of wishes it did.
The issue is—what, exactly? The fact that Steve needed months and hundreds of thousands of miles between them and the Accords to admit he might not have handled it perfectly? Does Tony really think Steve’s going to default back to cruelty and secrets the second that’s more convenient?
“Off and on,” Tony answers vaguely. “And I can’t disappear altogether. No offense, Wilson, but the UN doesn’t trust a single one of you besides T’Challa, and the man has responsibilities beyond…this.”
Wanda looks anxious as a nurse fixes a butterfly bandage to her cheek. Steve knows how close she and Clint are, and he’s seen her protective streak when it comes to Hawkeye.
“What,” Steve says, a more normal volume, something light and teasing, “there’s something the great Tony Stark doesn’t know about space?”
And then Tony gets the tablet back in hand and pulls up some of the specs he’s worked out based on Shuri’s notes. Even though Bruce looks exhausted and doesn’t pick his head up all the way, he does roll it on his neck until his cheek is smushed against one of his arms and at least one eye is free to look at the screen as Tony explains it to him.
