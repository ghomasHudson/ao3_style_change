“I didn’t know he was fifteen! He was huge!” Dean turned to Cas. “I thought he was at least twenty-five. The kid had a beard, I swear.”
Castiel’s musing was interrupted by the sound of quiet footsteps slowly making their way down the hall outside the door. It was only his angelic hearing and military training that helped him pick out the slight tap of a low heeled shoe on the carpet. The heavy gait told him whoever was coming was a male human, and still twenty to thirty feet away by his estimation. He approached his door and waited, sure that the only reason someone would be walking past his room past nine would be for him, and sure enough, the steps paused outside his door, and after a pause and long sigh, they knocked.
He threw himself into his work and hobbies, filling his time with reading and sewing Claire little dresses so he wouldn’t have to think about how lonely he was. Before his eyes, she was growing from a baby who scooted along the floor, to a toddler that scampered naked through the house, shrieking in laughter as her flustered dad chased her around with a diaper.
He nodded and walked with Charlie to the changing rooms to get back into their street clothes. If there was one thing that had been drilled into their heads, it was that they couldn’t be seen in their uniforms in either of the parks. Changed and freshened up, they were finally able to clock out. When they left the building, Charlie ran to give Gilda a big hug and flood her cheek with wet kisses. He rolled his eyes at the display but was too happy for his friend to give them any grief. “Come on, I’m starving.”
Dean’s office faded back into view and he was left staring at his laptop and blinking away the strange feeling of coming back into his body. His heart was still beating loudly in his chest, a residual effect of the annoyance his soulmate had felt when he saw the car cutting in front of the traffic. Dean didn’t blame him since it was an asshole move, but he hated the emotional runoff that happened every so often. His soulmate must have been
“I have the same feeling, I assure you. To be honest, this was the last thing I expected you to bring up when you said you wanted to talk. I thought you were going to complain about me claiming part of the garage to store my camping supplies.”
for his heroic deed on that day, and to his extreme embarrassment, his stunt earned him a substantial reputation. Humans wrote
This is a good thing, love. You’re not exactly the belle of the ball. Better to let him see you once it's too late for them to back out of it.”
Sure, they had tons of lakes in rivers in Lawrence, but nothing beat the silky feeling of warm sand under your feet, the salty breeze, and the hot sun beating down on you. He loved it so much that after he finished his week at Sam’s studio apartment, he was planning on driving the thirty minutes to San Jose for an interview, and if all went well, to apartment hunt. Not that he was going to tell his brother any of that. He’d wait until the last second or maybe just show up to his apartment out of the blue. The bitchface Sam was guaranteed to give him would be worth it.
Dean grinned and dipped his finger in the jam once more before replacing the lid. “It's good public relations too. When I’m King, they’ll be more comfortable with me, right? They’ll come to me with their problems and since I know them better, I can
That boosted his confidence enough to make him a little reckless. “You’re my husband. You are allowed to touch my wings. In time, I’ll teach you to groom them if you wish. It’s an integral part of courtship for angels.”
It felt like years since he and Cas started the process, although it had only been months, and his brain was sluggish in believing that they were finally approved. They applied, had their interviews, attended training, had their home inspection, provided a handful of reference letters, answered invasive questions, filled out financial information, and all but gave them blood samples…and now?
“Yeah. I’ve heard stories about him from the soldiers. He’s amazing—I mean, I've heard he’s amazing. So, did you ever meet him?” When Cas just continued to stare, he got even redder. “He’s not a myth, right? He’s done some unbelievable shit, but my men swear they saw him. One guy even said he broke bread with him.”
Dean typed a quick message to his brother, checking in and giving him a brief rundown of today’s plan. Sam had been super invested once he learned of the scheme, although he wasn’t a fan of Dean’s methods. According to him, just waiting and hoping to see a car he
Why had he been so fixated on Jack being the one to help? He knew the answer, but admitting it out loud would almost make it worse. Thank god Claire was too young to realize her daddy Dee was an asshole…
“So…” Dean began slowly, his fingers tapping against the counter. “I have a fifteen-minute break. Were you planning on drinking that here?”
Dean snorted to himself. Pot, kettle. Dean wasn’t exactly the life of the party these days, either. Not that he ever was. When his mother died and his dad made himself scarce, Dean took on the role of breadwinner. At the tender age of seventeen, he earned his GED and got his first job at a machining manufacturer. He got up at the ass crack of dawn and worked until three in the afternoon, just in time to pick Sammy up for school. He was in bed by eight pm and woke at four in the morning to do it all again. Now in his thirties, his job title has changed, but he still worked at the same plant he did all of those years ago. He hated it. Everyday, he needed to remind himself that a job was a job. He would be looking for another one if it didn’t take so much effort, but he felt guilty complaining when so many people in the world were unemployed.
As he turned to leave, she stopped with a soft hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry about that boy, ya hear me? Consider it one of my ‘educated guesses.’”
Cas didn’t know where to keep his hands. They went from his hair to his shoulders, both hands doing most of the work as they gripped him hard and shoved Dean back onto his dick, but they soon started drifting down his chest, over his stomach, gripping his hips. It felt like Cas couldn’t get enough of Dean, so his hands continued to wander, leaving shivers in their wake. Dean was on fire, it seemed. Sensations were coming at him from everywhere. Pebbled nipples rubbing against the cold desk, the warmth of Cas’s hands where he gripped Dean, and the catch of Cas’s cock as it pulled nearly all the way out before slamming in mercilessly. Already, his dick was dripping with arousal.
Dean huffed at Cas’s bluntness. “Well, Cas… I can do you one better. How about you give me your phone number. I wouldn’t want to drop by while
When dinner was finally over, Dean cleared his throat. “I think they’re waiting for us to dance. What do you think?”
“It’s just you, I promise! I don’t normally—” He cut himself off. Everything he said would just make things worse.
She clicked away on her computer while he waited, hoping she could give him anything. For the first time in his life, he was feeling hopeful.
The room felt stifling, and before he could think better of it, he was unclasping the two-hundred-year-old ceremonial robe and letting it slide off his back into a heap on the floor. He took a few deep breaths, knowing that his fiancé—no, husband—was watching him. His wings fluttered nervously, pulling at the ribbons and flicking a few pearls across the room.
“Well, you can at the beach we’re going to. No one swims there because of the tide pools. One big wave and you’re, well….”
Cas was willing to do almost anything to finally get Dean inside him, so he put his hand at the base of his trembling wing and gathered some of his oils. When his hand was finally slick enough, he reached down to grab Dean’s cock, immediately beginning to stroke him. He was uncoordinated and jerky in his movements, but the way Dean curled over Cas and gasped led him to believe that Dean didn’t care at all.
Softer this time, Cas braced his forearms on either side of Dean’s head and joined their mouths again. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s waist and pulled him in, holding him in place as they pressed together. Dean wormed a hand between them, dipping his fingers behind the belt of his slacks and pulling out the tails of Cas’s shirt so he could stroke the skin over his hips and stomach.
He wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. “Because you signed a contract? Because King John is a man of his word? Perhaps Prince Dean liked the look of Cassie’s ass?”
He smiled widely and knelt next to Claire. “Do you mind if I take a picture of him to show everyone?”
Claire took his distraction for the opportunity it was and jumped onto Dean, latching onto his middle with her arms and legs, and pushing him over onto the couch. He yelped in surprise, laying there in shock as her seventy-pound frame landed on him. Jack piled on too, always ready to follow the lead of his big sister, his sharp elbows and knees digging into Dean’s muscles like the worst massage in the world.
On the last day of his vacation before he had to go on his secret apartment hunt, Sammy shook his shoulder at 6:30 in the morning, already in his board shorts with a stuffed tote bag thrown over his shoulder. Dean sat up from the couch and put up his usual protest at being woken for all of thirty seconds before Sam placed a steaming mug of coffee on the table in front of him and looked at him expectantly. “I’ll go without you if you want to watch Netflix all morning.”
gone to snooze. His clumsy hand had overshot the snooze button and shut the alarm off altogether. He woke up again thirty minutes later, groggy and more than a little confused, only to have the last bit of sleep forced away by a spike of anxiety straight through his belly. Work started in less than thirty minutes.
He rushed home and parked in the garage, rushing through his usual routine of slipping out of his grease-stained jumpsuit and marching straight through the door and into the kitchen. Cas was nowhere to be seen. The office was empty, no one was in the backyard, the only thing that indicated Cas was even home was his bookbag resting against the coffee table in the living room.
Cas’s face was flushed with embarrassment as he made his way back to his brother. Balthazar was waiting expectantly, already eyeing Cas’s approach nervously. “So? What is it?”
“Come on, Cas. You dress her up like a little lady and take her to reenacting events. How many other kids get that kind of experience?”
Except, it wasn’t a manifesto. It wasn’t a plan. It wasn’t even a law school paper. It was… fanfiction? He frowned and leaned closer, as if the pixels would grant him clarity. As he read the document, a few things became clear. First, this was indeed fanfiction. Second, it was fanfiction for D. Winchester's most recent novel, the very one Cas had been talking about nonstop since he read it. And third, it was good. Very good. The characterization, the dialogue… It was almost like Winchester himself was writing it.
His morning shower flew out the window, and even his usual breakfast of egg whites on toast had to be skipped. Cas slid into his slacks and t-shirt, pulled his wrinkled white button-down out of the dryer, and only spent a few seconds swishing mouthwash around his mouth before bolting through the door and to his car.
Cas was covered in his husband's cum from his bellybutton to his collarbone, and his cock was still slick with lube. While morning sex seemed to energize Dean, Cas wasn’t even close to getting ready for the day. He was sure that if he
Dean held his hand away from himself, clearly disgusted with the cum drying between his fingers. Cas couldn’t keep the grin off his face as he held his own hand in the sameway. “There’s paper towels in the bathroom.”
His cock was hard between his legs, and he ached to touch it, but Cas was the one who made the rules, and he hadn’t told Dean to touch himself yet.
Cas’s lips pursed and Dean was starting to think he was missing something important. “Do you need a helper?”
Dean knew that never in a million years would Cas be this much of an asshole to his students, but oh my god, was it turning him on like nothing else. “I’m sorry Professor Novak. I tried.”
before taking Claire’s hand and leading her to the garage. Already, he was making plans to buy her a child’s set of coveralls and little work boots. It went a long way in smoothing over the sinking feeling in his gut.
He internally cringed at her promise of subtlety, but forced himself into the restaurant and to the small table where Gilda was waiting with a stack of menus. His heart pounded in his chest as he pretended to read the menu while they waited for Charlie and Dean. Cas couldn’t believe that not only was he willingly going on a double date with Dean, but he was actively encouraging Charlie in her little matchmaking game. Sensing his discomfort, Gilda reached across the table and put a comforting hand on his. He let his shoulders relax a little and let out a breath. He could do this.
Cas thrust harder, his hands tightening their hold on Dean’s hips and all but slamming him back down. He could feel his orgasm building, and with Dean cursing and moaning above him and his nails leaving raised tracks all over his chest, he wasn’t going to last much longer. He moved one of his hands to grasp Dean’s cock, jerking it roughly and throwing off the man’s rhythm. Dean looked pained, but he knew it was all pleasure, the same pleasure that was driving Cas. Using his wings, he forced himself to sit and wrapped his arms around Dean, holding his husband to his chest so he could thrust his cock as deep as possible. Dean’s cock rubbed wetly into Cas’s stomach, and it drove him to clutch Dean tighter, leaving no gap between their bodies and surrounding them with his wings.
Dean spent the next few minutes strapping Jack into the baby carrier, frowning at the way his son was beginning to outgrow the contraption. It seemed like just yesterday they had to use the little booster insert because he was too small, and now the chest support was getting a little snug around his twenty-two-pound frame. Next thing he knew, Jack would be fourteen and too old to hand out with his dads. He shuddered at the thought. “Come on, little man… let's show you how to swap out some spark plugs and do an oil change.”
A knuckle rapped on his window, startling him out of his spiral. The eyes that met his were deep blue and narrowed in righteous fury. He gulped as he continued to stare, unable to look away as the man seemed to be working himself into a fit.
“The one I sent you?” His lips were pressed into a grimace. “Come on, man. I tried to introduce myself and get to know you a little.”
Cas watched Dean as he continued to talk about his favorite interactions of the day, unable to believe he ever thought Dean was anything like Gaston. Sure, he smirked and swaggered around, loving the attention, but he was quickly learning that Dean was just a confident guy. Of course, it helped that he was incredibly handsome.
He lingered, wanting nothing more than to join Cas and play robot invaders with the kids. Dean must have hesitated just a minute too long because Cas cleared his throat and addressed him again. “Want to join us?”
A delicate throat clearing interrupted their staring. Anna looked between the two men, her lips pressed together to prevent the laugh that she was clearly holding in. “We need to lock up.”
Since Dean already started off with morning wood, he was already too close to coming for comfort. It had to have been what, three or four days since they last had sex? Maybe even five? Too long in Dean’s opinion, and he was going to remedy that immediately. The only question was, hands or mouth? It took him two seconds to decide he’d rather die than go another second without his mouth on his husbands’ cock.
Castiel had only been married for three weeks, but he was sure that the sight of Dean stretching the kinks out of his muscles, back arched and miles of glorious skin glowing in the morning sun, would never get old. He didn’t know where to look first: the roundness of his ass, the freckles that dotted his entire body, the dark marks Cas had left on his neck, his broad shoulders, the crease of his ass above his thigh, his narrow hips… or his cock that was just barely beginning to soften from their lovemaking.
His eyes were dark and he was standing far too close. All Cas had to do was move an inch or two and they would be touching. Heat shot through his body and Anna’s parting words rushed back to the forefront of his mind. Dean flicks his tongue out, wetting his bottom lip, and clears his throat. “If I was reading things wrong, tell me now. I’ll just—”
I wanted to see him, but I could also make the argument that I very much need to see him in order to help you…”
“I can take care of my own problems.” He busied himself with sorting his garment rack. “His flirting really doesn’t bother you?”
Castiel didn’t like the calculation in his eyes and attempted to change the subject. “Are you engaged, Samuel?”
“A few minutes, five at the most.” Sam, unable to let a subject drop, plowed on. “Why do people say to pee on it? This seems like important information!”
He applied later that week, using Charlie as a reference, and had his interview a few days later. All said and done, it took him under two weeks to get hired into the costume department. It wasn’t his dream job, but it was a start.
Cas couldn’t help but smile back. “So, is it—” he glanced at the man’s chest, only to have his hand whip up to cover it. He looked up askance and was met with a red-faced barista. They stared at each other, the man wide-eyed with shock while Castiel’s head tilted in confusion before he cleared his throat. “I take it you’re wearing the correct name tag?”
“It’s not simple, it’s refreshing. The plot is the main feature, not how many big words the writer can fit into the text.”
It only took him a few years to give up completely. The next time Christmas came around, he parked himself on their loveseat with a glass of wine and turned on the tv. The Hallmark movie playing was so bad that Cas was enthralled by the couple’s ridiculous misunderstanding, not even caring when Michael walked by and gave the tv a dismissive look. The next year, Cas started watching the movies even earlier in December, and the year after that, he started on Thanksgiving.
“No. I wasn’t kidding when I said it wasn’t a good idea to ask out anyone working in customer service, and I meant it. I think you should encourage that man to do it himself. And for the love of God, get his real name somehow.”
“I wasn’t aware you wanted another child. This seems like something we should have discussed before marriage. In fact, we definitely should have.”
to be nerves. All anxiety left his body and suddenly, he wanted to laugh at the thought that he was making the other man nervous… that Dean Winchester was
Cas narrowed his eyes at the man, and it only seemed to make the man smile wider. “I’ll find out what your name is.”
She squeaked loudly in excitement. “Oh my god. Yes! Ok, get inside and I’ll talk to him. I’ll be subtle, I promise!”
“Yeah, the fanfiction comment gave that away. The girl at the front desk knew, so I thought she told you.”
“What, Dad? You’re telling me I can’t drag my husband back to our room? Would you prefer we choose a tapestry to hide behind instead?”
“A fucking ten!” he yelled at his brother, extremely thankful that the morning’s crowd was so spread out. Any other beach would have had them packed next to each other like sardines. The last thing he wanted was to draw a crowd. If he was going to die, at least it was going to be without an audience.
The man stared at him for a moment before he seemed to come to a decision. He sat in an empty chair and leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees as he gave Cas his full attention. “Are you a fan of this Winchester guy?”
Despite having been to Starbucks nearly every day for a month, he had never been inside. The wall of coffee-scented air that hit him as he walked through the doors had him closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. Cas let out a little sigh of pleasure and joined the short queue, glancing around the large coffee shop as discreetly as he could.
Dean put his things down and walked back into the house to grab him applesauce from the fridge, hoping the snack would be just the thing that calmed him. He unhooked the baby carrier and let it fall to the tile floor, hoping that not being held down would calm him, and he handed the snack to his son. Jack calmed and sat quietly on Dean’s hip, watching the applesauce curiously, and in the next second, he clenched the packet tightly and it squirted up Dean’s neck and dripped into his shirt.
didn’t want to explain how horrible it had gone. “I think I’ll have to wait another year or two for that.”
He set Jack down then used the edge of his shirt to wipe the spot of applesauce off his neck. Jack was already crawling to Claire’s toy box, ten times happier than he was when he was out with Dean. “He had an applesauce accident.”
“And he just stared at me, as if he’d never considered that he might have to go through torture training. Who does he think we're going up against? What does he think the demons will do if they catch him? Pat him on the back and send him off with some bread and cheese? Ridiculous. I don’t know who you and the King have out there recruiting, but I’m going to have to have a conversation with them about their tactics. What am I supposed to do with someone who—”
It could have been minutes or hours, but Dean eventually pulled off with a ragged gasp, his forehead resting against Cas’s hip as he tried to catch his breath. He was a second away from suggesting they switch positions, or even suck each other at the same time, but then Dean’s head popped up with determination in his eyes. Without any warning, Dean climbed to straddle Cas’s hips and gripped his cock. It only took him a few seconds to dip his fingers into the already-open container of lube and slickly stroke his husband’s cock. Cas watched Dean work in stunned silence, knowing he should tell him to stop, that they didn’t need to do this a
He watched as Cas walked around his desk and began rifling through his drawers, searching for something. The longer he stood there, ass in the air and bent over the desk, the more he felt like he was at Cas’s mercy. It made him want to do whatever Cas told him to do, to obey him so that Cas would have his way with him. A little bottle of lube was pulled from the bottom drawer, and finally, he was moving back to stand behind him.
So on their anniversary, instead of spending time with his husband, Dean was at the shop doing oil changes and other menial tasks. Cas wasn’t faring any better. Since they decided not to celebrate until the weekend, Cas somehow thought it would be a good idea to schedule a quiz this morning. That meant a day full of grading only to come home burnt out and annoyed with his students. Dean would tell him to blow grading off, but Cas was known for having a quick turn-around for posting grades and he would never tarnish his good name like that.
Dean moved to open the door and step outside, hoping the guy would give him a few seconds to explain before he punched him. His soulmate took a step back, fists clenching and unclenching rhythmically, poised for a fight. Dean understood. He obviously messed up and now he wanted to kick his own ass for being so stupid. If some asshole honked and tailgated him all the way to work, he’d want to kick the guy's ass too.
At last the door was opened and Balthazar burst out in an explosion of feathers. Castiel heard his older brother’s voice, already tied into a conversation with someone, and if their tone was anything to go by, he was not making a good impression. Castiel took a deep breath, unwrapped himself from the comfort of his wings, and exited the carriage. They were met by household staff and the king’s right hand, an older man named Bobby, and after a few moments of introduction, their party was led to their quarters.
“You got mad at some asshole driver and memorized their plate. I had a friend help me find the plate, and since this is the only stretch of highway in Illinois that had an accident that bad, and at that exact time...”
” the king shuddered at the word, “you must remember where you’ve come from. I will not have our kingdom shamed by your bad manners.”
With a grin on his face, Cas got up and made his way to the washstand for the discarded cloth. “Need I remind you that the tour was your idea?”
That night, as he cuddled Claire on his twin-sized cot and listened to her blabber on about how her day had gone, he couldn’t get Dean out of his mind. He’s spent so long coming to terms with the idea he was going to spend the rest of his life alone, that he never considered what he would do if someone actually showed interest in him. Cas kept telling himself that nothing would come from it, that a man as charismatic as Dean would probably lose interest in him soon enough, but he couldn’t help the small spark of hope that was warming his chest.
Too soon he was driving up to the drive-thru and his heartbeat quickened with anticipation. Thankfully, Balthazar sat quietly in the back, not a peep coming from his lips as Cas made his order. The silence lasted while they waited their turn until finally, Cas was pulling up to the window.  For once, Cas was hoping it wouldn’t be his barista at the window, that it would be the peppy brunette or the kind redhead, but as he turned to stare through the glass, the man stared back.
Dean cleared his throat, but the ball of nervous excitement stayed thick in his throat. “Uh, yeah… sorry.”
“You should be grateful, son,” King Zachariah informed him in place of a greeting. “I thought we’d never find you a match.”
Dean nodded in agreement and pried his eyes open to watch the lifeguard. “I think I love you.” The lifeguard frowned and Sam bit back a laugh, letting Dean know that he said that outloud. “Shit, sorry. I mean, it still hurts, but it’s getting a little better.”
“It’s the ‘I’m going to murder you if you don’t stop asking dumb questions’ kind of pain. Now quit making me talk or I might throw up on you.”
Impatient thumbs were tapping on the steering wheel as he drove a little too close to the car in front of him for Dean’s comfort. He flicked on the blinker, checked his blind spot, and changed lanes so he could move around the slow driver. His soulmate let out a relieved sigh as he was able to accelerate to match the other vehicles.
Cas sighed, steepling his fingers and readying himself to deliver the news. “Even if you get an A on the final, you won’t be passing my class. If you had come to me at the beginning of the semester, after your first F, I might have been able to help. Now, it’s simply too late.”
Dean quickly found out Interstate 55 was one hundred and ninety-four miles. Sixty-six of which ran through Illinois. As he sat in his hotel room in Chenoa, he made his plan of attack. The accident had been on the southbound side of the freeway, so he knew that his soulmate was heading
Suddenly, the rhythm to his strokes was gone and Cas was jacking him off furiously, proving just how close to the edge he was. He threw his head back and panted for breath, feeling lightheaded and like he was about to fly out of his skin. “Cas!”
His brother carefully lowered the silver circlet onto his head, placing it just at his hairline. Castiel looked at himself in the mirror and it felt like he was looking at a stranger. He’d never cared for his appearance and the only times he even glanced into a mirror was to shave, so to see himself done up like an actual royal was jarring.
“So, do you know…” his hand slid up Cas’s back, drawing him even closer and dipping his voice down to a husky whisper. “The Angel of Thursday?”
Dean led him to nearly every stall, introducing Cas as his husband, and people fell over themselves to offer him their wares despite his polite refusal. He walked away with pieces of silk, food, a new ring, and a dagger, all of which the villagers refused to accept his money for while Dean just laughed at him and his discomfort.
He glanced up at Cas nervously, ready to be told to get the hell out of his office, but Cas just stared at him blankly, that damn eyebrow cocked. “Considering your performance in class so far, how can I be sure what you’re offering will be any better?”
, and if Castiel had answers that didn’t involve his brother peeing on him, he sure as hell was going to listen!
When Castiel was approached and told his marriage was in talks, he accepted it without comment and flew to the palace within the hour, to the deep displeasure of his commander. When he landed in the courtyard, still in his uniform and exhausted from the flight, he was rushed to his rooms by the servants, eager to get him out of his armor before his audience with the king. Instead of his plate and chainmail, he was stuffed into a fine silk shirt, with a waistcoat and matching breeches. His comfortable leather shoes were replaced by long, gartered socks and low heeled shoes. By the time a servant fit him with a matching embroidered coat, he was ready to jump out the window and fly back into battle.
His soulmate was still glaring. “What is the meaning of this? If you are attempting some sort of insurance scam, I’ll have you know that—”
The solution, when it finally came to him, was simple. Pulling out of the drive and turning towards work, he gave his friend a call, launching immediately into his question before Balthazar could even say hello. “I’m going to Starbucks before work, would you like anything?”
He placed him in the crook of her arms and stepped back, watching as she looked him over. Kelly brushed her hand over the dark tuft of hair, stroked his chubby cheeks, and smiled when he yawned widely. “He looks like a Jack, to me.”
Cas’s tie brushed lightly down his back, sending goosebumps everywhere as he bent over and fucked Dean in earnest. He was letting out small huffs of breath and low moans now. The sounds did amazing things to Dean’s dick, and he ached to reach down to stroke himself but to do that he’d have to let go of the desk, and that solid piece of wood was the only thing that was keeping him from falling apart.
He couldn’t blame them. Jack was fully embracing the terrible twos and Claire was getting increasingly harder to put to bed. Not to mention, someone would have to take care of the chickens, Cas would have to plan a week of at-home study for multiple classes, and Dean would have to convince his boss they could do without him for a week. It was a lot.
Shit…did Cas know? Cas had always been the primary contact for any information they sent out. If Dean was called at all, it was after they tried and failed to reach his husband. He glanced at the clock and tried to figure out what time they would have called Cas. If his guess was correct, it would have been sometime during his 2 pm class. Cas’s class was over by now and he had probably been home for the last thirty minutes. Plenty of time to check his phone and find a message.
“Mr. Winchester…” Cas rumbled, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest. “You’re cutting it close. My office hours are almost over.”
Dean was flushed and sweaty from his orgasm, and he knew the sight he made. Mouth stretched around his cock, lips glistening with spit, bare ass in the air as he knelt between his legs. He winked at Cas and pulled off, licking around his tip for show, and teasing the edge of his foreskin. He played with it a bit, enjoying the slide if gave his hand while he pumped him.
She shook her head. “He’s not flirting with me, Cas. The idiot is just getting into character. He heard Christian Bale was a method actor and he’s been insufferable ever since.”
Dean yawned, already starting to drift into a sleepy daze. He let his eyes close and he snuggled further into Cas’s thigh, throwing a knee over his calf. “It was my pleasure.”
Dean smiled and sent a quick text to Cas. “Sure, kid. Let's go before it gets too late. Daddy will kill us if we eat dessert too close to dinner.”
Having caught his breath, he dove back in, knowing by the way Cas’s hands trembled in his hair that the brief respite he gave Cas was the only thing that kept him from coming the moment Dean did. He smirked knowing that his own orgasm pushed his husband so close to the edge. Mouth back on Cas’s cock, he bobbed his head, sucking on every pull and flicking his tongue across his shaft on every push.
Dean rolled into Cas so they were chest to chest. “Give me fifteen minutes and I can make that happen.”
Dean snorted. “They kind of are. It’s ok, though. You were right. Adam is pretty stubborn and I think he would appreciate a little groveling from David.”
Dean grabbed a few more drinks for them and attempted to get the job done, but they ended up talking more than wrapping. By the time they were on their last few items, they had somehow gone through another round of buttered rum (that Dean had added a few extra ounces of rum to), and two spiked hot chocolates.
He was staring at Cas, green eyes wide with surprise. “No one’s ever said that before. Thanks for the feedback. I wish my editor was as honest as you.”
It only took him a few minutes to have everything ready for his tune-up, and already, Jack was showing signs of boredom. He started with the babbling, growing louder and louder by the minute, then the squirming started followed by little grunts as he struggled against the baby carrier. The grand finale was a well-aimed pinch to the tender skin of Dean’s inner elbow. He flinched and let out a grunt of pain, before pulling Jack’s fingers away from his arm. “No, Jack. No pinching.”
“No, thank you.” Cas squeezed her closer, giving her the comfort her own family wasn’t willing to give. Looking at them, Dean felt the emotion building in his chest. As gently as possible, he put little Jack back into the bassinet, draped the blanket over him, and settled in beside his husband.
“You’re impossible, there is absolutely no evidence. Besides, I saw you staring at him earlier, what does that say about you? Even though you think he’s a murderer, you still think he’s hot.”
Unlike what King Zachariah said, Winchester Capitol wasn’t rundown and teeming with filth. The people looked clean, well-fed, and their clothes were well taken care of. This was nothing like the shabby picture his father had painted. These were not people begging for scraps and starving to death under an unjust ruler, as King Zachariah often announced. This was just a normal city with houses and markets teeming with life. He could see children playing, running through the stalls and alleys without care. The people looked happy, and some even followed the carriage in an attempt to get a look inside. Balthazar smiled and waved, enjoying the attention as Castiel sank into the shadows, grateful that his dark wings didn’t invite scrutiny and helped him blend into the interior of the carriage.
The more he thought about it, the better it sounded. Sam was off living life in California with his soulmate, so it wasn’t like he’d be leaving him behind, and Charlie preferred to be in front of a computer anyway, so it would be no skin off her back to switch to skype calls. His boss could go fuck himself, and that was all he thought on that matter. With more than fifteen years of experience, ten of those being a manager, he’d have no problem finding a job. Hell, he’d be a barista at Starbucks if it meant he could leave the machine shop. Maybe Cas would be his sugar daddy for a little while.
“Well, not if you don’t want it,” he hedged. Fuck, the last thing he wanted was for Cas to agree just because it was something Dean wanted. A child wasn’t something you could return just because you changed your mind. If Cas agreed and then regretted it… “Listen, maybe we should talk about this another time. Do you want a drink or something? I could really use a whiskey.”
Dean held back his sigh of relief. He’d been trying to give Cas time, to let him get his feet under him before he brought up the possibility of Cas getting back on the field. That was part of the reason Dean wanted to give him a tour of the training grounds in the first place, to test the waters. It couldn’t be full-time, since he had new responsibilities now, but he had seen the look on Cas’s face when he looked around the training grounds. He missed it, and Dean knew Cas wasn’t going to say anything.
Cas did as he was asked, placing Jack into a seated position facing out. With sure hands, he wrapped his forearm around the baby and gripped his jaw, offering support for his chest and easily holding the child in place. With one firm stroke, he whacked the baby’s upper back. “Like this.”
He wanted to shake his hand. He wanted to pull him into a hug and thank him for writing some of his favorite books. But he also wanted to run into the nearest bathroom and throw up. “Oh, god…”
He did as he was told, scooping the smelly powder into a bottle and giving it a good shake. Like he’s seen Sam do before, he let the milk drip onto his inner wrist and tested the temp. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for, but since it felt lukewarm, he figured it was good enough. He handed Cas the bottle and watched as he teased the baby’s lips, wetting them with the milk, before slipping the bottle between Jack’s smacking lips.
He fought back the ‘Yes, ma’am’ that was on the tip of his tongue and paid the woman before shoving his change into the tip jar. “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
“Very good. This line here, where David is reunited with Adam,” he pointed to the document, indicating the paragraph. “Considering how the book ended, this is perfect. It captures the ambiguity of the future of their friendship. But a few paragraphs down, you have Adam forgiving David. I don’t think it should happen like that.”
Cas scowled at him and went back to his search, eventually choosing a lavender and blue pair. He wandered back to the bed and sat, pulling up his slacks and working a sock onto his foot. Dean took the opportunity to slide up behind him, draping himself over Cas’s back. He took an earlobe between his teeth and gently nibbled. To his satisfaction, Cas let out a long breath and tilted his head, giving him even more room. “Dean, you’re being very rude.”
“It's all I’ve known. I’ve been there since I was sixteen. I never learned politics or diplomacy. I can’t tell you the names of important people, or hold a conversation about anything other than war tactics. I’m a strategist, nothing else. I’m sorry if you were expecting—”
“Shh... I got you.” He withdrew his finger and added more oil. When the touch returned, he finally began easing it in. He tensed at the intrusion and Dean paused to give him a moment to relax, leaving the thick digit inside. Dean placed his hand on his trembling thigh and rubbed his thumb comfortingly across the silky skin, offering a soothing point of focus. Cas took a few deep breaths and then shifted his ass, permitting him to continue. He went slowly, taking it to the first knuckle, then the second. When Dean’s finger had been fully engulfed by his slick heat, Cas was already panting harshly and covered in a thin sheen of sweat from the strain. Dean gripped his cock, giving it a swift stroke and filling his body with fire.
With a bright smile, the man retreated through the window and it closed between them. Shaking himself out of it, he put the coffee into his drink holder and pulled forward.
“You have no right to lecture me about overconsumption of coffee. I know for a fact that you have at least two cups before noon.”
“That’s awesome.” There were a few moments of silence between them before Sam cleared his throat. “So the urine thing… It doesn’t work?”
He followed him off the freeway, through a turn, then another, and finally into the parking lot of a business building. His soulmate parked, and so did he. Suddenly, he wasn’t ready to get out of the car and meet the man. What if he didn’t like Dean? What if he was one of the people who shunned the idea of soulmates? What if he purposefully wasn’t trying to find him and Dean just hadn’t taken the hint. What if—
Cas continued shuffling around the kitchen, ignoring him. “Ok, fine. It looks like I’m on my own. I’ll have to fight dirty.”
“Fucking angels, man. Insatiable,” Dean groaned, rubbing his fingers through his tousled hair, dampening the tips into spikes. He glanced down at his still soft cock with an expression of betrayal. “Come on, man. Throw me a bone.”
The fact that they knew so little about him, that Dean could look him in the eye and talk about him without even a glint of recognition, was reassuring. “That’s it?”
for him, about his uniquely dark wings and ability to wield two blades. He became so well known on the battlefield that just the sight of his charcoal wings would give humans the courage they needed to continue in battle. The fact that he looked more like a human than an angel worked to his advantage, and he was invited to their campfires to break bread, where he learned far more about their species from their own mouths than he ever did in the palace.
was here. As a prince, he would have met enough angels to know that Castiel wasn’t normal. “That’s not necessary. I was able to see the portrait painted for his coming of age.”
power! Before, you actually stood a chance if our peace devolved into war. Without my strategist...” She paused and took a calming breath. “You’ve given them even
By the time they had been served the fish course, he had moved on to talking about himself, recounting the tale of how he got his horse, a mare named Impala.
“I’ve wanted to adopt Claire for a long time, so I never even considered asking you to change your last name.”
After a very sleepless night, at precisely one minute before he’d be a day old, everyone stood by to see if he would have a sighting.  Dean slept deeply, unaware that his life was about to change forever. 3…2…1… A few things happened at once. Dean’s eyes snapped open and he looked straight ahead with his grey-blue eyes, blinking once or twice, his lips parting in surprise. The nurse began counting to herself, her voice a soft murmur in the background.
Cas tapped his finger on the mouse, internally debating what he should do, when Anna made her way over and sat in the chair next to his. “What is it today?”
Slowly, he stroked the globes of Cas’s ass, easing him into the touch and inching carefully closer to the furled muscle. The first bush of Dean’s finger over his hole was electricity, and all the breath escaped Cas, leaving him light-headed and eager for more. Dean’s touch came again and again as his finger teased at his hole, rounding around the furled opening and adding just enough pressure to drive him crazy. “Dean!”
He inched his way in, trying to calm himself. Did babies smell fear? Dean shook the thought out of his head and forced himself to walk up to the bassinet and peer inside. His son’s face was pinched and red, eyes closed tightly and eyebrows furrowed. He looked mad, and after what he just went through, Dean couldn’t blame him.
He took out his phone and aimed it at the baby, taking a few snapshots before putting his phone away. “I have to head back, but let me know when I can bring the girls over. We’ll bring dinner for you guys.”
“Well, I was smart enough to—” Sam trailed off and glanced towards the tower. “Oh, good… he’s coming!”
“We figured it was the least we could do. You’ve given us a great gift.” Cas went back to stroking the baby’s head. “He’s beautiful.”
Balthazar rolled his eyes, but the teasing seemed to be over. “It’s a hard question to answer. These people are being paid to be nice to you, so it’s hard to tell whether or not it’s part of them just being good employees or if they genuinely are attracted to you. As a rule, I don’t ask out anyone who is getting paid to talk to me.”
They say together, watching the baby as he sucked down the contents of the bottle, pausing every few seconds to breathe before drinking some more. When the bottle was finally empty and Jack had settled into a food-coma like doze, Cas handed him over. “Have you burped a baby before?”
Dean let out a sigh. “Yeah, but it's never led to anything. There are a surprising amount of angels with dark hair and blue eyes. I mean, look at
Thankfully, the staff was discrete, and the king’s hate towards humans remained within the palace walls. King John stayed blissfully ignorant of the angel king’s extreme dislike towards his species, and the two kingdoms continued to send flowery missives and well-written updates back and forth. Trade between the two had never been better, and the angelic public viewed their neighboring kingdom favorably, to the frustration of their king. They even had a small population of humans living among them.
Not used to people bowing to him, he could feel the skin of his face heating to a deep blush. “Please,” he began, keeping his voice low so as to not draw even more attention to himself. He glanced at Dean, but he was turned away, still deep in conversation with Charlie. “Please rise.”
Claire had a smile on her face the entire time, babbling about everything from her favorite tv show to the dog she saw on their walk last night. She was having so much fun that when Dean finally put in the new oil filter and called the job done, she actually complained.
Dean tapped the horn a little harder, and this time, his soulmate glanced around to check his blind spots. Again, he honked lightly, tapping out a pattern of beeps for the car in front of him. He could feel the confused stares coming from the cars around him, but they weren’t who he was concerned with.
Cas started laughing, and once Dean joined in, they couldn’t stop for quite a while. Dean had never been a fan of Thursdays, seeing them only as a prelude to Friday, but today was easily the best Thursday he’s ever had.
“Are you ok?” he asked breathlessly, still cognizant enough that he knew this was the second time Dean’s been fucked this morning and if he wasn’t sore now, he would definitely feel it later. “We could— Ah! We could do something else.”
Castiel snorted. “Please don’t, because then I’ll have to jump in and save you. We both know you can’t throw a punch.”
He was beautiful, and once he laid eyes on Castiel, all of Winchester would see the marriage for what it was: an insult. Angels were known for their otherworldly beauty, and marrying one was often seen as the pinnacle of accomplishment. So, to send someone as strange looking as Castiel, a man with no real royal influence and nothing to offer the kingdom of Winchester… He shuddered to know where that would leave him. There was no way Prince Dean would actually go through with the union, playing right into his father’s hands. With a broken marriage alliance, his father would finally have an excuse to start the war he’d been itching for, one that even the other kingdoms couldn’t oppose.
“Yeah… You never wrote back to me so I thought you were going to be just like him, but you’re not, obviously. I get it, we didn’t ask for this, but I figured you coulda at least sent a note back.”
He had a redheaded sister named Anna who talked his ear off about boys, and Dean knew from the minute he saw her that she would grow up to be a heartbreaker.
Cas straightened his back, giving up on deciding which card to use, and looked up to the smiling face of the barista. His eyes were just as green and vibrant, and his lovely freckles stood out against his tan skin. “Hello.”
They stood outside the hospital room, straining to hear past the noises of the hospital and the soft cries of Kelly coming from inside. Her nurses were her only company as she birthed the baby, and the two of them could do nothing but stand by and listen helplessly as the brave young woman brought their child into the world.
Her shriek filled the air and he cringed at the sound. He could only imagine how his father had fared at the onslaught. “I can’t believe you—”
“Michael and Anna are your siblings. I used to see you guys eat breakfast in the mornings before school. Anna would always complain that your parents bought plain cheerios and not the honey nut ones.”
“No, it’s not that, I—” he let out a long sigh and his shoulders drooped. Green eyes met blue as he dropped his hand, revealing his name tag. “I was having fun with it, and I didn’t want it to end…”
Without any input from him, his body was turning to face Dean, and their lips joined. Prince Dean’s were warm and shaking in a surprising show of nerves. Before he could even register how Dean’s lips felt against his, the kiss ended, and both men turned back to the priest to receive their final blessings.
“It didn’t use to be. Five years ago, people were dropping to their knees and bowing in the middle of the street, but I’m here so often now that they barely even notice me. Most of the time people let me pay, but Molly never will. She provides all the preserves for the palace and we pay well, so she’s always trying to give me stuff.” He took two of the jars, popped one open, and dipped his fighter inside before bringing it to his mouth with a moan. “God, her stuff is the best. Makes for a good midnight snack, too.”
He hoped the letter contained news of the marriage, and if it didn’t it was no trouble for him to be the one to deliver the happy news. When he was finally allowed to enter his father’s council room, he found the king and his Right Hand pouring over a map. It was such a familiar sight that he stilled for a moment to take it in. As a child, he begged to be a part of council meetings, but his father had never allowed it. When he was finally old enough, it was the
“Oh, come on. Get up.” Cas pushed himself up and extended a helping hand. Dean took it grudgingly and let Cas hoist him back on the couch. “Let’s watch A Christmas Carol. I’m feeling nostalgic.”
“Of course.” She grabbed the tongs and bagged his muffin before turning to pour him a to-go cup of coffee. “My pastries are much better than the frozen stuff that Starbucks sells, and don’t you forget it.”
With Cas’s help, Dean replicated the hold. It took him a few hits to get it right, and Dean still felt that he was hitting too hard, but after a few hits Jack released a large burp and Dean relaxed a fraction. “Ok, this isn’t too bad.”
Unfortunately for him, his council didn’t agree. While Zachariah sat on his throne and disparaged his closest human allies, the Kingdom of Winchester had sent envoys and ambassadors to the other kingdoms, assimilating themselves into their courts and gaining favor. While Zachariah was the closest neighbor, he was far from their only ally, and if Zachariah even hinted at war, the other kingdoms would turn on him before he could blink.
“Missouri didn’t say anything, ok?” he lied, not wanting to put too much stock in her predictions. They were correct often enough, but he couldn't take the chance. “And if you aren’t liking the coffee I've been bringing you, I can stop.”
Soon, there were too many people talking to be able to understand it all. Cas hadn’t even noticed his approach, focusing all of his attention on his feeble attempt to get them to stop, but it was no use. Everyone was talking over each other, and as the situation sunk in, Dean had to hold back his smile. Of course his husband would have found himself a fan club. And now, once word got out who exactly Dean was married to, it was only a matter of time before Cas would be getting letters in the post. Dean couldn’t wait.
He accepted the prince's hand and was led to the dance floor. Immediately, the music was switched to a slow waltz, and a crowd converged around the floor to watch the couple dance.
She remained as still as Dean had ever seen her, just watching and making little baby noises at her brother, cooing softly to him as he slept. Dean’s heart clenched in his chest at the clear love she already had for her little brother. Dean pulled his gaze to Cas, who had leaned back on his heels and was watching Claire with the same expression.
On the third day, Dean woke with a stress headache and as the hours stretched, it didn’t get any better. He scowled through his breakfast and his drive to the highway, cursing the fact that it would be another few hours before he could take another dose of Tylenol. The Target sign loomed in the distance, mocking him as he pulled onto the shoulder and practically punched his hazards lights on. He swore at himself and gave Baby a pat on her dash in apology. The last thing he needed was for Baby to get offended and give him problems when he was so far from home. She was a sensitive woman and deserved only gentle touches.
Dean shook his head. “Don’t sell yourself short. He musta seen something in you. Maybe it was the military thing. We could always use a strategist in the castle.”
“Hello,” he heard himself say, and suddenly the woman beside him was talking a mile a minute, complimenting his daughter and putting Cas at ease.
“Gaston.” He took Cas’s hand, but instead of shaking it, he brought it up for a feathery soft kiss. “But you can call me Dean.”
Eventually, they were able to put her into bed and have a moment to themselves. Back on the couch, Cas turned off the tv and leaned back with a sigh. Dean gave him a moment, knowing that Cas’s job could be stressful, and watched him relax into the couch.
Castiel already knew that there was no way Prince Dean could know what he looked like, but it still put him at ease to hear it confirmed. “I’ve never sat for a portrait. I was already in the military when I came of age.”
“Oh, thank god…” His idiot of a brother turned to the lifeguard. “You gotta help me. We need to pee on Dean’s foot!”
Finally—agonizingly slow—Dean began to move, taking as much of him into his mouth as he could, while his hand took care of the rest. It was loose,
“There’s no man,” he grumbled, taking a sip of coffee. God, it was good. He couldn’t believe he stayed away for so long.
Cas rotated the present, examining it closely. The whole thing was a mess of crinkled paper, sloppily wrapped around a sturdy Pokeball that he just knew Claire would love. Sure, he probably should have just put the damn thing in a bag as Cas suggested, but Dean had insisted he could do it. Technically, he did.
“Fuck.” He opened the lid and dipped two fingers into the thick liquid. Cas was already grabbing at his knees, pulling his legs apart and exposing himself to Dean. “Cas…”
“Don’t be an old man. Why don’t we get these presents under the tree and watch a movie? Let’s watch Die Hard!”
She only wanted what was best for her son. John had been born a few months before her, so there was never a day that she didn’t have a connection to the love of her life. She wanted that for Dean. Wanted it desperately.
He shook his head. “I’ll let her know.” He forced himself to walk casually to the desk. “Anna, you can get my keys from the breakroom and head out. I’ll take care of things here.”
“Oh, man…” A slow smile appeared on his face, and Castiel had never had such brilliance directed at him before. “You’re gonna love them.”
She nodded and turned to the couch to sit, lowering herself slowly onto the gray cushions. They followed suit, squeezing themselves into the love seat and lapsing into silence.
Castiel continued soaping himself and scrubbing at his hair, finishing his bath in record time so he could get dressed and the servants could be dismissed. Balthazar was about to get an ear full, and he didn’t want the servants to witness it. The moment a servant poured the last pitcher of warm water over his head, he stood and a servant helped him into a banyan.
“Yes, your majesty,” Metatron simpered. “It shall be taken first. Perhaps I can draw your attention to this field? Our scouts have tested the soil, and—"
Dean grinned and began stripping out of his gym shorts and t-shirt, his mind was already coming up with ways to make it more than worth his while.
He gulped and stayed still as a rock as Cas shifted around behind him and lined himself up. “Perhaps I need to rethink my policy on extra credit...” Without waiting for a response, he pushed into Dean, slowly but without respite. Dean let out a loud groan scrambled to grip the edge of the desk, scattering Cas’s neatly stacked quizzes.
“I think I might like Dean a little bit more than Gaston,” he admitted, loving the pink flush on Dean’s cheeks.
“Dean!” A young redhead came running out of the barracks, headed straight for them. “I can't believe you didn’t tell me you were coming.”
“It’s my big day, cut me some slack.” Dean said nothing for a moment, then began again even quieter. “Do you think they’ll miss us if we cut out a little early?”
“Dangit!” She huffed in annoyance and made a frustrated face. “I was trying to stay up, but I fell asleep. I didn’t even get to hear the bells…”
On either side of the priest stood Balthazar and King John. His brother looked at him with solemn satisfaction, eyes glinting with pride. The king stood to the right, head held high and looking every inch the royal he was. To Cas’s astonishment, he could see the same pride in the king’s eyes as Castiel approached, as if he was exactly the man he wanted Dean to marry. As if Castiel hadn’t been his fifth choice and last attempt to unite their kingdoms.
He gave up his attempt to find something to hold on to, and instead grasped Dean’s pistoning hips with one hand, while the other grabbed at his own cock. He began a ruthless pace, his ass clenching even harder in response to the added stimulation. His pleasure climbed higher and higher, and he no longer had control over the sounds coming from him. He didn’t spare a moment to be self-conscious and only continued in his mad race to the finish line. There would be time for slow lovemaking later, right now he wanted to feel Dean come deep in his ass.
Cas was silent the rest of the ride, only clearing his throat as they both got out of the car and began the walk into their building. “So, you think I should ask him out?”
“Balthazar!” his father shouted in warning. “This wasn’t supposed to happen!” He turned to Metatron. “You assured me—”
It amused Cas at first. It just figured that they would hire a real-life Gaston to play the role. He had seen Dean's work and he was
His friend just scoffed. “You can always pass a few my way. I know you’re a bit of a snob, but I don’t mind their coffee.”
Dean yelped loudly and staggered. Fuck, it felt like he stepped right onto broken glass. With trepidation, he took a deep breath and brought his foot out of the water to take a peek, expecting a lot of gore. There was no blood, no glass, and no outward show of injury, but still, the pain radiated up his foot, throbbing and stinging with every beat of his heart. He bent at the waist, attempting to even out his breathing and get through the shock of such sudden and intense pain. He waited, hoping that the pain would fade, but it stayed steady.
Too quickly, they were in front of the large door and Balthazar squeezed his hand before walking through it. Despite being surrounded by servants, Castiel felt incredibly alone. It was only minutes, but it felt like hours before the door was being opened once more for him to enter.
He handed it to the man, speechless, and waited for him to make change. When he turned back to Cas and gave him a nice customer service smile, Cas finally snapped out of it, responding with a quirk of his lips.
On paper, it was nothing but a common political marriage. A way to finally placate King John and maintain the peace that they both strove to keep. Officially uniting their kingdoms would benefit the two politically, in trade, and in the war against demons. But to send Castiel, the fifth son and King Zachariah’s ugliest child, was an insult to the kingdom of Winchester and the gravity of the situation. Castiel had been far removed from palace politics, but even
It was on the tip of his tongue to tell his brother about the job offer that he’d already accepted, but everytime he opened his mouth his stomach clenched. “Can you just shut up for ten seconds so I can die in peace? Maybe if I’m lucky he’ll give me mouth to mouth.”
When he pushed it open, he was greeted by a man in fine clothing: a heavily embroidered blue silk vest and matching breeches, very unlike the uniform of the palace staff. He was tall for a human, matching the height of Balthazar, with hazel eyes and chestnut brown hair long enough to graze his chin. The man was staring, mouth parted as he took Castiel in. “You’re Prince Castiel.”
Castiel almost jumped in surprise as he was suddenly reminded of his friend’s presence. He covered it by reaching behind him, coffee in hand. “Just take it.”
“Hello?” he grunted into the phone, already heading back into the kitchen. He still had another layer of meat sauce to put on, another layer of the cheese mixture, even more cheese, and then he had to figure out how long the garlic bread was going to—
Cas shook his head. “The syllabus clearly states that I don’t. As I said, there’s nothing I can do for you.”
Dean smiled widely and gestured to the much smaller man beside him. “This is Garth. Don’t let his size fool you. He’s a scrappy guy. Then we have Lee and Jesse, with Gordon and Adam bringing up the rear.”
Balthazar had been his friend since his first day at the company. Castiel was in finance, and the other was in sales. Their departments typically fought like cats and dogs, but Balthazar had taken one look at him after the morning rundown, loudly announced that his suit was terrible, and then invited him for coffee during their lunch break. He was confused and a little alarmed at the invitation—especially after the declaration that his ill-fitted suit was such an eyesore to the man, but Cas quickly realized that Balthazar hadn’t meant it as a personal attack, simply an observation.
Dean smiled wickedly and used his other hand to push the loose shirt up, exposing Cas’s nipples. “Sensitive, are you?”
The movement caught Dean’s attention. “Calm down, Cas. You gotta give me at least fifteen more minutes.”
time Cas had shattered Dean’s crystal decanter of whisky. Now, his wings could flap and flare as much as they wanted, and Dean loved to watch the normally controlled angel absolutely lose it.
But his father was barely listening, and instead reached out a bejeweled finger to point to one of King John’s numerous coal mines. “This one too. See how close it is to the border?”
His shoulders relaxed and he went back to glaring daggers at King John’s letter. “How would I know where your strategist is? Perhaps you should keep better track of your subordinates. Now, leave me be. I need to—”
He frowned to himself, taking a moment to guess why the hell Cas wouldn’t have called him as soon as he checked his messages—which Dean knew for a fact he always did after classes. The answer his mind eventually came up with didn’t sit well with him. If Cas hadn’t called him to share the good news himself, and Dean had known Cas long enough to make an educated guess, then that only meant one thing… Cas was panicking.
“Not with that attitude,” he muttered, and Cas, not wanting to argue, just shrugged and dug through his wardrobe for his most unassuming outfit. A pair of brown wool breeches, a mismatched vest to go over his shirt, and his plainest jacket. He turned towards Dean and gestured to himself. “Will this do?” Dean smirked and looked him up and down, a comment poised on his lips. “Nevermind.”
She glanced at him, eyes roving up and down his body as she wrote a woman’s order on her cup. “Are you sure? You said he had blue eyes and bed head, and this guy—”
Both Cas and Dean ignored ger request, and started making their own burgers. An avocado burger for Cas and a bacon, barbeque one for himself. They ate mostly in silence, even Claire was too busy picking the cheese off her burger to fill the silence with conversation.
Dean hummed around him, sending vibrations echoing throughout his body and made even the tips of his fingers tingle. His wings thrashed, threatening to upend furniture, but they had carefully removed anything that could fall after the
As much as it pained him to admit, he couldn’t get through the day without a cup of coffee. He envied the coworkers that didn’t need it to function and marveled at their inner strength, but for him, that wasn’t in the cards. He briefly contemplated taking a trip to the breakroom after he clocked in and grabbing a cup from the communal coffee pot, but there was no way he was in the mood to insult his taste buds with that sludge. Which meant he only had one option: the Starbucks drive-thru. With an annoyed grumble, he backed out of his driveway and tried to remember how to order a simple coffee.
He bypassed Anna’s room and made the short trek down the hallway to the bedroom his two sons shared. He was greeted with the sign of a bleary-eyed Michael staring at a sobbing Castiel.  He crouched at Castiel’s bedside, opening his arms and allowing Castiel to fall into them.
He was left to his own devices, only interrupted once by a servant delivering a late dinner. He only picked at his meal, too tired and anxious to feel hungry. With more than half left on his plate, he went to the wide window and opened it as far as it would go. Castiel looked in the direction of his palace, the place he had called home for the first half of his life, and felt only frustration. If he had been born a commoner, he could have lived his entire life in the army and never been sent away as a pawn in his father’s stupid game.
Dean reached out to flick his brother’s forehead, but Sam deftly avoided the move. “You’re an ass, Sammy. The sun isn’t even out yet.”
He tapped on his horn gently, giving his soulmate a quiet little beep. He could see the man’s head incline towards the rearview mirror and pause. Dean knew he was being stared at, probably
Once Dean’s phone was back in his hand, Sam grabbed his shoulder and spun him to face the car with more force than necessary, and practically shoved him in. Normally Sam would have gotten a swift kick to the shin for the treatment, but he was still riding the high from the new number in his contacts, and was already planning what he would be texting the man.
But he was too far gone to care. When Cas’s finger hit Dean’s prostate dead-on, he let out a loud shout and jerked forward, pushing his hips into the desk and finally giving his dick something to rub against. All this and Cas was still only using a single finger.
Dean stuck his tongue out at Benny, sucking it back in before Cas could see him. “So… What do you think?”
Dean’s eyes widened, and he was suddenly 100% sure he was going to lose his breakfast. “Oh, no. Fuck, no. Get the hell away from me!”
“The bean says hi. Actually—” she pressed the palm of her hand into her stomach and shifted uncomfortably. “He’s getting me in the ribs pretty good, right now. I think he likes you.”
Cas clenched around him and Dean hissed, but it did the job, and he pulled out just a bit before slowly thrusting back in. They groaned in unison, both overwhelmed at the sensation. He pulled out again, this time a little further, and slid back in, not even bothering to pause before he began a series of shallow thrusts. Cas let out a long keen and let his knees go so he could wrap his legs around Dean’s thrusting hips. His pleasure was growing with every thrust, slowly overtaking the burning stretch of Dean’s thick cock. He could feel his wings twitching from the pleasure, leaking his oils onto the sheets and sending gusts of air that cooled their sweat-slick skin.
“I suppose I’ll think of something…” he replied, at a loss. It seems to satisfy the man if his smirk was anything to go by.
“The weekend away in La Jolla? Ok, that one was pretty awesome. Well, this one is definitely in the top three.”
Cas tightened his arm around Dean’s shoulder. “Even if it’s not painful, it’s very hard to push a baby out of your body, or so I’ve been told.”
He took a shuffling step towards the shore, still hunched over in pain as he held onto his fishing pole like a walking stick. With his eyes on the water, he could see a small ray shoot out from the sand in front of him, zipping away to safety, then another, and another. Sam’s words came crashing back into his head. ‘
Cas just shook his head. “Where was this motivation all semester? Do you do this to all your professors? Flunk the class and offer them sex?”
Dean waited two painful weeks for Cas to finally sit him down and bring up the topic again. In true Cas fashion, they talked for an hour after Claire went to bed, discussing cost, if their home was big enough for four, if they wanted a baby or someone a little older, whether or not they were capable of taking care of an extra kid with their schedules, and so many other things that Dean’s head was spinning.
“No thank you!” She yelled back, never breaking her focus as she climbed onto his chest and plopped down onto him. “Just cheese.”
He turned to his sister with wide eyes. “Why, so I can get murdered? You’re aware that you’re not the beneficiary of my life insurance policy, right? You won’t see a cent of it.”
With gentle hands, the lifeguard cupped his heel and slowly picked his foot up. Dean tensed as his foot was lowered into the bucket, unsure what, if anything, would happen. Warmth met his foot, and— “Oh. Oh, god.”
With the most satisfied smirk Cas had ever seen, the man held out his hand to shake. “Dean Winchester.”
“You won’t be hitting him.” He passed Jack to Dean and sat back. “There are a few ways you can burp him. Over the shoulder, or my favorite, sit him on your lap. That way if he spits up, it’s not on your shirt.”
Despite his statement that things would take a while to come together and they had plenty of time to prepare, things did not go slowly. It was only two days later that they got a phone call that had them set up a handful of appointments and create a family profile that prospective mothers could look at. Once the profile had been completed and a short video had been made, their information was officially in the system. From then on, they had to be prepared to be contacted at any moment by a mother at any stage in her pregnancy.
He soon learned that he wouldn’t be able to watch him all day like he’d hoped. He had tasks to do, emails to check, a boss to report to, and breaks to take. It was an hour before the library was supposed to close that he was finally able to begin his observations again, and just like earlier, the man was doing nothing suspicious, just typing in his document, and taking a moment to stretch his back every so often.
After twenty seconds, the breath Mary had been holding slowly released. John grabbed her shoulder and squeezed, almost to the point of pain. After forty seconds, Mary let out a laugh of joy. John let out a sniffle. After sixty seconds, Dean’s tiny body shuddered and he let out a loud wail, tears streaming down his face.
“No one cares about your time playing soldier, Cassie,” he interrupted with a sigh. “Give it a rest. And please, for the love of God, don’t mention it to the poor humans. I can only imagine what they’ll think of you when they find out you’re merely a commander.”
Vision’s of Balthazar embarrassing him flooded his head. He turned the full force of his glare onto his friend. “No.”
Cas glanced up at her and she watched him back, unimpressed. “What’s this I hear about you getting coffee elsewhere?”
“You little fuckers!” He hissed at the water. With more care, he let his feet drag through the sand, not once lifting them his entire way to the shore. The process was slow and painful, but in less than a minute, he let himself collapse onto his knees and roll to his back.
Balthazar sat in silence as he waited for Cas to finish explaining exactly what he needed help with. When he was done, Balthazar continued to stare at him from his place on Cas’s couch. “So, you’ve been getting me coffee for a couple of weeks just so you can visit your boy toy?”
Finally, it was Dean’s turn. With no hesitation, Dean’s surprisingly gruff voice told the priest “I do,” and to Castiel’s utter surprise, they were married.
, that it would be very bad. He pushed that idea out of the way and thought about their more recent interactions, ignoring that horrible first week on the job where Dean did nothing but poke at him. The man was able to take a hint, he’d give Dean that. Once Cas’s blushes turned to glares, the flirtations softened to nothing more than the occasional smirk and wink. He’d dated men who had treated him worse, he supposed. Besides, one date didn’t mean
“And ruin the surprise?” King John let out a laugh. “We’ve known about your little crush for years.”
He scribbled a set of letters onto the cup, face flushed pink, and glanced up to him. “Name for the order?”
Balthazar's expression was a kaleidoscope of emotion. “I see. Well, good for you Cassie. I’d give you a quick explanation but I see him coming and he looks determined, so it appears I won’t have the time.”
It took every ounce of control to keep his wings still so his brother wouldn't see how the dismissal affected him. His family had little interest in their military, they had no clue of his accomplishments, and he had to remind himself to let it go. He didn't care about their good opinion. “I suppose it doesn't matter.”
got old. Sometimes, he would let Dean drag him into bed and make him a lot less early than he usually was. Other times, Cas hurried out the door despite Dean’s shameless begging, and he touched himself to the thought of Cas watching him impassively from behind his podium while Dean begged for a passing grade.
getting around to fucking him, but Cas had told him not to move and he was going to try his darndest to listen.
The double door slammed open, both sides nearly upending the priceless vases that bordered the room. Everyone jumped as Commander Naomi stormed into the room, her dove gray wings poised to kill. With murder in her eyes, she zeroed in on her brother, the King, and marched to the large desk. As if all attention hadn’t already been on her, she slammed her fists onto the wood for effect. “Where is he?”
“Oh man, that’s…” he bit his lip and looked away with a chuckle. “You gotta watch it, ok? Promise me. Batman is the coolest.”
Cas listened to him enthusiastically recount the angel’s many accomplishments, getting a surprising amount of the facts correct. He didn’t know whether he wanted to admit it was him or deny it to his dying breath. He
He shrugged and passed Cas his card back, his finger ghosting along Cas’s palm. “Yeah, you’re probably right. I could be a Bruce, though.” His voice dropped an octave and gained a rasp. “You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.”
“God above, I hate this blasted carriage. Can the footman possibly be any slower? If this is the kind of service you have to look forward to, I pity you.”
He turned from Balthazar, again focusing on the rumble of the carriage. That was the point, he thought to himself. His father was hoping that Prince Dean would take one look at him and run, abandoning him at the altar and insulting King Zachariah. Balthazar couldn’t be ignorant of that.
He eyed his mostly eaten breakfast and sighed. Despite his growing hunger, it was custom to fast in the morning to bring yourself closer to God. “No. I won’t be eating this morning.”
From the moment he was old enough for his mom and dad to sit him down and explain what a soulmate was, he started obsessing over his sightings. He just
Looking at the wrapped presents placed carefully under the tree and the only slightly smaller pile of presents that still needed to be taken care of, Dean could admit they might have gone a little too far this year. It wasn't like the kids didn't deserve it, though. They had been angels all year and Dean couldn’t bring himself to regret buying so many gifts. What he did regret, was deciding to wrap them all on Christmas eve.
But it was more than his wings that set him apart. His cheekbones were not high enough, his brow too heavy and nothing like the delicately arched features of his kind. He wasn’t lithe and tall like his brother Balthazar, and his looks would never stand up next to the near-textbook beauty Michael possessed. He was short for an angel and stocky. He was too thick, and his gait too heavy and nothing like the graceful walk of their kind. He didn’t have Prince Gabriel’s delicate cupid's bow lips, his were wide and plump. His expression was too intense, and not at all pleasing like Raphael’s. His eyes were too downturned and tired looking from his years at war. He had too many scars, too much muscle.
Ignoring his breakfast, Castiel stood up and allowed himself to be stripped out of his sleep shirt and led to the tub by a red-faced servant. He shook his head at the servant's reaction, nudity having long ago lost its meaning. It was hard to keep a sense of modesty when you were on the battlefield for months at a time with only a shallow river to see to your needs and a group of equally naked men by your side. Or, perhaps it wasn’t his nudity, but
He unclipped the seat easily and put it on his lap while he waited for Dean. When he was done, Cas slid it back into place and let go of Jack’s forehead nervously. Thankfully, the baby remained asleep through the jostling. “Thanks.”
Dean burst into laughter at his words, the situation, his joy, he didn’t know. The laughter just bubbled out until his eyes were wet with tears. He took a moment to wipe them away and just smiled at Cas. He knew he looked like an idiot, but god, he was just so happy to have finally found him. “I live in Kansas, Cas. I’ve been trying all week. The only reason I knew where to look was because of that accident a week and a half ago.”
Right when he was about to get up and retreat to the breakroom to lick his metaphorical wounds, he noticed that not only had the internet browser been minimized, but the word document he had been working on was open on the taskbar as well. He sat straighter in his chair, and with shaking hands, he clicked on it.
“Dean?” his brother’s voice broke through the pain, and he groaned loudly in response. “Shit, are you ok? I saw you bent over and I got worried.”
Cas and Dean weren’t heavy drinkers, but they did have a small stash of their favorite liquors on the top shelf of the pantry. Dean pushed around the hard ciders and simple syrups to reveal their collection of fancy whisky and rum. “Did you want another buttered rum, or should I spice up one of those hot chocolates? I think there’s still some vanilla vodka in here somewhere…”
He gulped, trying to comply, but Cas chose that moment to push back into him, crooking his finger and brushing against his prostate. He hissed at the sensation, strange and always a little sensitive until he was more warmed up, but the hints of pleasure lurking beneath the surface were undeniable. Cas started a random pattern of brushing over that spot, driving him crazy with sensation, and by the time pleasure was coursing through his body like lightning, he was tense and whimpering like a two-dollar whore.
“Charlie!” Dean groaned, snatching the packet of sugar up so he could toss it at her head. She ducked out of the way with a smile, snatching a coaster and tossing it like a frisbee. Cas leaned away from them and met Gilda’s eye. She glanced once to Dean and then back at Cas, giving him an exaggerated eye roll.
Cas almost glanced behind himself to see who caught the man's attention so fully, but it was clearly him, and the man was now heading over. He had the urge to reach for his angel blade, but it was packed away with his sword. Regardless, he could sense no ill intent from this man, and he had always trusted his instincts. His guards stepped in front of him, ready to draw their swords, but he put his hands on their shoulders, forcing them aside. They were no match for his strength, and could only move where he made them. When the man was close enough to reach out and touch, he fell to his knees in the dirt, drawing attention from most of the courtyard.
Just like he promised himself, he went to Missouri’s first, grabbing an old fashioned doughnut and coffee for himself—and enduring her knowing smiles—before heading to Starbucks. At first, he considered ordering himself a pastry and skipping the mediocre coffee altogether, but the only food he liked from Starbucks was their peanut butter cookies, and he wouldn’t sit in the drive-thru for a single cookie, especially not this early in the morning. He also considered ordering something simple like oatmeal, but his waistline didn’t need the second breakfast.
“I don’t want to perpetuate the behavior.” He cringed at his own excuse. Giving them to Meg actually wasn’t a bad idea, but without the gift cards, he wouldn’t have an excuse to see the man at the drive-thru.
That was his main concern, right up until he learned that he was betrothed to none other than Prince Dean of Winchester.
“Balthazar, do shut up.” He crossed the room to his brother and pinned him with an impressive glare. “I’ll not have you scaring off the servants.”
Dean held the sloppily wrapped present in front of himself like an offering to a god… a god who was looking at him like him like he was an absolute idiot. Cas’s reaction did nothing more than make Dean bite his lip in an attempt to stop laughing. They continued their stare-off for half a minute more before Cas let out a long-suffering sigh. “Dean…”
