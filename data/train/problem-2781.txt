Castiel (or Steve as he’s locally known) was having a slow day at work. Some might consider it boring, but he considered it a quiet time to complete several manageable sized tasks. Castiel gathered some paper towels and a spray bottle of cleaner to wipe the counter. He spritzed the counter next to the cash register, swiped with his paper towels once, then froze. He stood still and listened.
Dean shrugged a little and gave his first hint of a smile.
“It IS good! We ARE happy! We don’t really have problems. I honestly don’t know what to tell you.”
“Gladiator Man Camp? Huh. You’re kidding.”
His time as a human had helped, a sort of immersion course. It certainly helped him gain a sense of perspective. He’d known these humans a fraction of a moment from his vantage point. They had known him a meaningful percent of their existence. It was touching that they had this little blip in time and they wanted to make space for him in it. Whenever he considered what time meant to them and then remembered that they chose him for that moment he would feel a deep sense of gratitude and awe. Humans may still often be cumbersome, but the time they share with others is a gift they have to give. It was overwhelming that they would choose to share that gift with Castiel.
It is clear that The Empty is becoming quite upset. Jack obliges and puts him into a deep sleep.  The copy of Jack that is The Empty crumples to the floor and rests. Jack regards his sleeping form.
Cas was wandering the property marveling at all of the life. He was developing something of a fascination with desert life. Each adaption to the inhospitable climate was a miracle of life’s determined flexibility. He stood at the edge of the ocean observing the life that chose to stay in the ocean rather than reach for the shore like some of the more ambitious species had. The original launching place of life, the ocean, meeting one of the most difficult places to build a life, the desert, moved him.
Jody slowly puts the plate down in front of him. She should be calling her son in for breakfast, but he will be happy to watch another round of cartoons before eating. Her husband doesn’t respond to the intruder at all. Jack looks down at the eggs in front of him a little sadly.
Oh, my crazy baby
Becky’s hands are shaking. The fear feels unfamiliar. Her racing heart beat feels unfamiliar.
“And if you think that sounds bad I have worse news for you. You are probably going to need help doing it. I know those are the hardest words for any hunter to hear. You are going to need to talk to other hunters trying to find that balance in their lives. Compare notes, see what feels right to you. Remind each other you aren’t alone, and you aren’t the only ones. Every hunter I’ve met with so far has one theme running through their stories, they all think they’re the only ones having the thoughts and feelings and struggles that they are having, and they are all telling me the same damn things.They all think they’ve gotta do it all alone, and they’re all so tired of feeling so darn lonely.”
Jody is dead. Jody is dead and in Heaven and positively ecstatic to be leaving.
“Huh, I’m out of tea. I guess I can’t help you out if I don’t make myself more tea first.”
The lyrics of the music playing catches Castiel’s ear and he tunes into the sound of the music over the speakers and listens intently to those lyrics
“It took a little work, I’ll admit. Sam managed to get me a number, and some matching drivers license/social security cards. Sam told me, but I didn’t exactly pay attention to the details.”
“Speaking of living, how is domestic life?”
Again, this is me being presumptuous, but you have a very real problem that is also a good problem to have. You have to learn to be safe and happy, and you are way way out of your depth here. The restlessness, and the stress, and the anxiety you are feeling makes total sense. It sucks, it’s uncomfortable, but it does make a good kind of sense. It does mean though that you need to learn a new set of skills for approaching life now, and that’s no small task. Luckily, as we already know, you are a stubborn sonofabitch and a survivor.”
“Pecos invented the rodeo. There’s a rodeo every night. Everyone in town has been to a rodeo.”
It’s the shame, Castiel realizes. The shame that Dean carries on himself always, like a beloved family heirloom. It is after all a gift from his family. Dean’s sense of being unworthy, Dean’s feelings of being a grunt unsuited for academic places, his feeling of responsibility for every mess the brothers are ever in. All gifts from his father that he holds onto dearly without any sense of how they weigh him down.
There had been a handful of nephilim before the flood, and the rumor was that Angel/human relationships were part of the reason God had smote the earth and started humans again. This was the first one Castiel had ever met. The creature had grown away from Angels and from humans, mostly alone, and word was it had made him a little crazy. The word from On High was that his unchecked powers had made him crave destruction. This very strange monologue was confirming this word.
“He has these two teenage boys that alternate a few hours after school Monday through Thursday. The local high school has an automotive program and he sponsors 2 kids a year for a sort of internship. Matt and Mark. Good kids. They like Emmett and he’s really patient with them. Also there’s Casey, Emmett’s daughter. She’s about 40. She keeps his records, does his taxes and such. She’s got a 10 year old son, Greg, who comes around sometimes, but I wouldn’t really call him an employee.”
“You know for the first time I have no idea what happens next. Is this where you kill me? I mean, I could never think of an ending where I lose. But this… After everything that I’ve done for you… To die at the hands of Sam Winchester.” He looked up at Sam. “Of Dean Winchester.” He looked at Dean. “The ultimate killer…” He laughed again. “It's kind of glorious.”
A feeling of defeat settled in Dean’s stomach once again.
There were bottles littered about him, most of them empty. Dean grabbed the neck of one bottle, only a few sips left in the bottom. Sam frowned as he lifted the bottle and downed the last of it, but he didn’t move to stop him.
Along with dragging him from the world, it had taken Death with it too. She had been thrown somewhere so far into the black that Castiel knew he'd never see her again. She was screaming. He couldn't hear it per say but it was there. And it was always going to be there.
He left his bedroom, walking into the bunker library.
The empty paused, narrowing its eyes, suspicious.
Cas looked up, where a tiny plant hung.
“This is something I have to do on my own.”
Standing behind them was Michael, still wearing the face of their half brother Adam.
Dean gave Sam a look. “Dude, a reaper can’t open the book, only Death can.”
In a matter of seconds, the grass in the cup before him began to shrivel up. It turned a dry brown color, withered and died.
"Nah, I love these two with my whole heart, and Eileen, you're wonderful for him." Dean took a breath. "I'm sad Mom and... Dad... and everyone that we've lost, that they couldn't be here to see this, cause I know that they would be so proud. And Sam, I am so proud of you," Dean turned facing Sam. "You are the bravest, smartest, kindest, most compassionate person I know, and I wouldn't be here without you. Had you not stood by my side, all these years, I don't think I would have lasted this long to see you get to have... this. So thanks, Sammy, for always being there for me."
“Woah, woah, woah, look at you!” Dean said, kneeling next to the dog, his heart completely melting at this tiny bit of joy.
He slid his hand down to Cas's arm, and raised it in horror as his hand came up with a handful of black, sticky sludge.
“The one in the World War Two submarine and Cas was… possessed by Lucifer? Yeah I remember.”
The empty must have been reading his mind, unnerving Dean even more, because as soon as the thoughts had entered his head, the empty's eyes lit up.
“Alright.” Sam faced Chuck. “Well… One for the road.” He took a swing, smacking Chuck hard in the jaw.
Thick black tar oozes around Dean’s feet. He steps forward, the sludge slowly rising around his legs, pushing against him, holding him in place. He was so close, if only he could just reach a little further.
The angels were not expecting him, and Dean, catching them by surprise, barreled into the large group, slashing and stabbing at everyone in front of him.
“What will you do now?”
Inside were rows of hard wooden pews. Candles were lit, and a large crucifix hung above the door.
Cas furrowed his brow, clearly confused.
As soon as Michael saw him he was filled with a great, red, boiling, anger … and a tiny bit of fear.
"Uh, okay... we're gonna talk about this... eventually, but I gotta go call like 20 people because I am owed roughly $10,000 in cash." He started heading away from the door.
In his other hand he carried a leather sheath, which he lifted to show them. "From what I understand about hands of god is you're not supposed to touch em, and I had this on hand so..."
But Dean didn’t respond, he barely even registered that Sam was there. His breathing hiccuped and his face was red and swollen, like he’d been crying for a long time.
Dean turned with mounting fear. He could hear wailing, screaming.
Dean laid a hand on Sam's shoulder. "And I'm not gonna be that far, anyways. The house is literally just on the other side of Lebanon, by this little clump of trees. You can send your kids over if you need me to babysit. Also Miracle is getting older and I think he'd like to have some outside space to run around."
Cas curled in on himself, tears starting to stream down his face. He clutched at his chest, wishing for everything to stop.
Then he was gone. Sam and Dean looked around in utter shock, the horror dawning on them that they were truly and forever, alone.
Christmas rolled around, and true to his word Sam had set up the Christmas tree, though it was a little more 'Charlie brown' looking then expected.
Jack looked around and realized with a start that every bit of plant life within a five foot radius was completely dead.
"It'll be lonely without you..."
"Oh don't be do dramatic," a sharp point nudged into Castiel's side, the anticipation of further pain making him gasp. "You're boyfriend is fine. Though, considering, that God's plan involved giving you to me, I don't think whatever he has in mind for Dean will be as... pleasant."
It had been days. One day since Cas woke up and then four more after that. Nearly a week.
He just needed to think! Think about.. think.. Cas. Think about Cas!
"Frankly, it's a wonder Sam has lasted this long without her." Sam rolled his eyes and there was a rumble of chuckles from the crowd.
Dean nodded. "Yeah!"
Cas gasped, doubling over, his breath knocked out of him.
The towns were empty.
"What could you possibly give to me?"
Jack made, or at least tried to make cookies. He burned half of them.
Dean glanced up from his own studies. “Uh, yeah?”
'Family vacation,
"I KNOW who you are..." It interrupted, which threw Dean off rather abruptly. It didn't help that the empty looked so much like Cas.
“What is this?” Dean asked upon entering.
Sam and Dean looked down at Chuck, who was taking it all in as he realized he had walked right into their plan, their trap. He laughed.
Sam snorted. "You literally just pulled that out of your ass, didn't you?"
"My name is Dea-"
Sam and Dean stood by the Impala. It was night around them, and the large, bright city around them was completely silent, adding new weight to the loss of every single human on earth.
"Not even Billie could put me back to sleep. What makes you think you can?"
“Dean?”
"I was so stupid. Death, I cut her, she would have died on her own, he could've been fine, he wouldn't have had to... he wouldn't have... he didn't need to die!! He would still be... he... he..." Dean broke, his breathing dissolving into heavy panicky sobs, and tears started to stream down his face.
Michael smiled. “And you would know, would you not?”
Dean shuffled his feet outside the door.
"They'll miss you... the kids I mean."
Michael breathed hard. “I’m sorry.” He spoke.
Dean sat up in his bed. He groaned as a headache started to settle in, but that didn’t stop him from reaching over and grabbing a half-empty bottle of whiskey, downing a large swig. He looked forward, his eyes staring at nothing, his whole body feeling tired and dead.
A shadow crossed the empty’s face. It’s expression changed, bitter, furious, seething as it took in breaths. With each breath the wails seemed to pulse.
"Cas?"
The blade emitted a faint golden shimmer, one Dean recognized from the last hand of god he encountered, though that one had just been a chunk of wood.
He came upon a set of roadside plants growing out of the concrete.
“Ah, no, see, I’m the almighty.” He said, confident and assured in his holiness. “I really can.”
“There’s no one to save… It's just us.”
Then, on the far end of the table, a rather notable stack of bottles rested. Sam circled around the table and saw Dean trembling on the floor.
“When the rapture began I took refuge here, it is Saint Michael’s, you may have noticed.” Michael shot a subtle glare at one of the angel statues, no doubt supposed to depict his own image.
By the time the music started up, the sun was setting. The fairy lights hung around the tents and trees glowed, showering everything in a golden light.
“Yeah, but if you kill a reaper you get Death. So…”
What was happening?
The cries were almost deafening, pounding through Cas’s head. He barely restrained from bringing hands to cover his ears, suspecting it wouldn’t do any good if he did.
"You've been avoiding me..."
The demons ripped at Dean, scratched at his face, kicked his side, clawed and pulled at his arms. But one thought raged through his mind... Cas... Cas...
There were tears in his eyes.
"Now, let's see where we can get started." It said, a certain smugness in its expression. It had taken his own form again, the voice spilling out the nose, and ringing in his ears, so much unlike his own.
Coming up the road behind him, Michael heard the subtle rumble of the Impala engine. The car doors opened and he could hear the crunch of gravel underfoot.
But Dean's heart thudded when he looked at the empty, who stared at Cas with a full expression of satisfied hatred on its face.
“That’s a page turner.” Chuck gave them one last smile.
“CHUCK, YOU ASS!” Dean shouted. Chuck rolled his eyes.
"I sure hope so, kid." Dean put his hand over Jack's. "God I sure hope so."
"So..." He started. "As best man and brother of the groom, it falls on me to give a speech," he paused, everyone looking up at him expectantly.
Jack turned, reaching out another hand. Flowing from the tips of his fingers was a trail of black smoke. It piled, forming the shape and body of Amara. She looked around, confused and bewildered.
Sam and Dean lay there, face in the sand, spitting blood from their teeth.
Sam had worried at first.
Jack stood there, unmoving. Chuck stopped, threw up a hand and snapped. Nothing happened. Chuck tried again, he snapped. Jack didn’t even flinch. He just stared at Chuck, a new resolve in his face. He began to step closer to Chuck.
“Find anything, Sam?”
"You're not Cas." He said.
Sam had told Cas, about what Dean had done. About how he had ripped his grace from his body and how it was now gone forever. Cas had said he needed little time, so they hadn't exactly talked.
He was lying on the floor of what he assumed was the empty. Of course it was the empty, he’d just been taken by it, where else would he be? Though he had expected to go to sleep….
“So where does this leave us…” Sam spoke. “We need that book open and we’re out of options.”
Castiel cried out as his head was swept with another load of painful memories and emotions.
His veins still glowing with power, Jack snapped, and Sam and Dean looked down at themselves, blood gone, injuries healed.
“Alright. We should get out stuff together.” Dean turned to Michael, motioning his head towards the portal. “Head out.”
“Thats right.” Dean stepped forward, continuing Sam's speech. “The whole Cain and Abel thing. Us dead, whatever. Sam kills me, I kill Sam, we kill each other, but first you gotta put everything back the way it was.”
He was proved right when they looked at Dean, varying amounts of recognition and hatred in their faces. Dean noticed with a nasty feeling that Uriel stood at the front of the crowd, long dead but still an asshole.
“That was then.” Something akin to rage stood in Michael’s features. “This is now.”
Dean released a shuddering breath, reminding himself that the empty was just trying to get under his skin, which sucked because the empty was very good at it.
Sam stared at Dean, a surprised silence hanging over them.
They were demons. It was an instinctive thought, but Dean felt as though he knew them. Something inside them was so familiar and so very wrong at the same time.
"How long?" Dean asked. Cas made a noise that signaled confusion. "How long since... since you fell for me?"
“Apparently, your old man has a sense of humor.” Dean said with a scoff, “He thought it’d be hilarious to watch the three of us on an empty planet.”
There were tears in Sam's eyes, and he was smiling, trying to hold it together. He stood up, wrapping his arms around Dean who hugged him back, crying a little with him.
“Hey Jack,” Chuck took cautious steps towards him, making his way across the dirt and gravel.
“I don’t know.”
It didn't matter if he had poured his heart out, it didn't matter if he could never have him, it didn't matter if it felt like his whole body surged with terror at the thought of never seeing him again. He would go out with a smile, his purpose complete.
Sam rose, looking hurt and angry. “How could you SAY THAT? I LOST THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!”
Sam put the phone to his ear. “Donna? Oh my God you’re ok! Yeah we’re fine. We’ve got a lot to tell you…”
"SHUT! UP!" The empty roared. It quickly threw a hand at Castiel's throat and all at once Castiel felt a horrible tearing. There was no blood, no sudden hole or wound, just immense pain.
It was as though the volume of the world had been suddenly turned down. There were no more screams, no more claws. Dean breathed easy, staring up into nothing but dark.
Dean shrugged and laughed. "It's ok, I've never really danced either..." Cas turned, staring into those still beautiful green eyes. "We'll learn together, alright?" The hand  was still offered.
Jack placed another plant in front him and did the same thing. The plant shriveled up.
As the shapes came close, they became more distinct and Dean realized with alarm  that he recognized what they were. Black eyes, dark smoky wisps trailing off them, something that was once, in the vague sense, human.
Tents and tables had been set up. Wooden platforms were laid out on the grass, which would be used later as a dance floor.
[Ok first of all, accompanying the recap, Carry on My Wayward Son plays cause the Cw are a bunch of pussies and I can't believe they didn't do that, come on guys it's like tradition]
Sam looked confused. "Why not?"
Before he could wonder about it further they were upon him.
All was right with the world. The people were back, Michael and Amara began to head off to go fix Heaven but… something was missing. Something painfully apparent.
“WAIT! WAIT! WAIT PLEASE WAIT! GUYS!”
“Dean! Why the hell didn’t you answer my calls? I thought you were dead!” Sam yelled. It had been just like Eileen. Sam hadn’t known what to think and for all he knew Dean might have been gone just like the rest of them.
“What are you sensing? Like, people?” Sam asked, a slight tremble in his voice, almost daring not to hope.
Jack stared at them, not really thinking of anything. All of a sudden the plants crackled, turning brown and dead, withering into nothing.
“It’s ok Jack.” Sam stepped towards the table, and towards Jack. “We’ll figure this out.”
But as long as Dean was there to tell him its alright, to light the lights in the dark, to be there right beside him in the night when Castiel would wake up in a panic, he knew that everything was ok.
"Yes I know, I'm supposed to be dead. Funny thing about that, I am, only now I'm awake. Awake in the empty."
The entire rest of the room groaned.
Like a prickle on the back of his neck, he had the awful feeling that there was something behind him. Dean shivered and slowly turned around.
Dean tried to grab the hand, to pull him out, he couldn’t lose him. Not again. Not again.
He looked around. Over in the far corner he saw a crowd. They had someone pinned against the wall and that's when he saw it. The glimpse of the trench coat.
“Don’t worry, he’ll warm up to you.” He opened the back door with one hand. “Maybe I’ll let you sleep in his room.”  Dean laughed quietly and placed the dog in the back seat, rubbing his head.
Dean got up, making his way out. "We'll be packing for the next couple days. You'll help us with the move?"
Dean Winchester was saved.
"Just tell me where he is."
How were they awake?
Then there was of course his greatest regret. Why hadn't he told him sooner?
They took the ride silently, only Jack speaking up once in a while to give occasional directions, based on where his soul was telling him to go.
Jack looked down at Chuck, then back up at Sam and Dean, still bloody and holding each other.
Sam shook his head, standing up, and putting the blankets back on his bed. Then he went to the closet, opening it and gazing at the black tailored suit, which stood at the front of all his clothes.
Sam looked over, eyes hidden behind his sunglasses.
"You can't kill me. I'm human, you have no jurisdiction."
Michael blinked at the sudden change. The sun was bright in the sky, and it took him a few moments to get used to it and notice the trees around him.
“So…”
"Yeah ok."
"What are you talking about?" Dean said, a hint of fear in his voice.
Yeah anyways hope you had fun reading that.
"Hey!" Dean shouted. They wouldn't hurt him. Not on his watch.
Pulled into nothing for eternity.
The empty had chosen Dean's form again. Castiel began mentally preparing himself for the worst today.
"Alright. How do we get him back?"
Jack walked out of the gas station convenience store. He hadn’t really been looking for anything, just sort of… wandering.
“Michael?” Sam asked, just to confirm it was him.
"Oh and just if you wanted to know." It whispered. "You're whole 'unrequited love'
"I'll go open a portal." Jack said, excited. He bounded away from the table heading towards the far end of the room where he reached out, the air sparkling as a thin crackling golden tear in reality came into being. He turned around, a hopeful expression with the promise of getting Cas back.
“.... knowing human behaviors and this human world lets us live in it, till then we live in hell till we have learned enough not to stand out..” The demon spoke turning the gas on the stove, it clicked loudly. “Despite it pissing off a lot of people, our deal will better help me do that-”
“In your head maybe!” Castiel scoffed checking him over for injuries. “Jesus, you scared me.”
“Like sell the company?” Castiel looked offended.
Gabriel wiped his mouth after he vomited, using the sink to cover the throwing up as he turned off the water. Feeling gross he left the master bathroom walking towards the kitchen. Dean was sitting rocking Atlas smiling at him as Atlas blinked up at him with his big doe eyes.
“Yeah, it’s not that deep across and isn’t moving so fast,” Anna stated walking a bit in. “See? He easily could carry him across.” Lucifer eyed the blood spot where Castiel’s body must have been at rest.
“We can’t just let him out on his own…he doesn’t even know who he is,” Dean spoke reaching to undo the armor on the man’s chest. Sliding him out of the unbelievably heavy armor, it was so heavy Dean had to push with all his might just to push it off of the Fae. Dean panted once the armor was off.
___________________________________________________________________________
“Yeah, his name is Sam,” Dean admitted with a smile. “He’s a lawyer. He’s my family’s golden child. He deserves to be. I mean. He’s mine for sure.”
“Yes, sir?” Charlie asked eyeing Lucifer, seeing Lucifer out and about wasn’t a good sign.
“Sometimes,” Dean commented as he glanced up at him.
“That’s where Joshua is. He’s in a place where it’s so dark you can’t see but he makes the light.” Jack whispered as Castiel blinked trying to understand.
“C-Cas.” Dean touched his face with love as his tears mixed with the rainwater.
?” Dean smirked innocently before he walked out of the barn. Castiel smiled to himself moving to touch his lips glancing back to where Dean had gone. Castiel waited for his heart to stop pounding before going back into the house with the others.
I’m so quiet during sex,” Dean asked like it was silly as he went for another sip before returning to his side.
“Five or six months.” The man shrugged. “Kinda lost track.”
.” Gabriel huffed wagging his little tail and walked out with Castiel to get the supplies.
“I’m...team vampire?” Benny mumbled blinking, which he didn’t understand. Dean snorted at the joke but said nothing. “Thank you for the human hat...but why do you guys have teams for vampires?”
_______________________________________________________________________
“Tell them no.” Castiel choked.
Gordon mentally moaned as he decided to try to see if he could slip out a side door in the garage. Gordon walked to the open door leading to the garage. Walking in he grabbed his phone to make light when he noticed a shadow rising on the wall of the garage. A large looking beast of a shadow grew up the entire length of a wall. Gordon looked at the wall in fear, taking in what looked like a giant monkey shadow. Gordon looked on, if they had a talking evil dog...what ELSE did these guys have?!
Sure, they were dating.
“Dean?” Castiel spoke as Dean backed away. “Dean-” Castiel reached for him but Dean bolted out the front door. “DEAN!” Castiel panicked following him sliding on his sandals.
“What is all this?” Gabriel asked as Castiel finished the last flower in a flower crown he was making and put it on Gabriel’s head.
“...but I was in a maze…” Dean started looking around as Castiel sighed.
“That was stupid, Cas. So stupid.” Dean breathed as Castiel laughed as their lips met again.
“I changed the license plates. It should buy us time. Besides, people rarely know their license plates. They might not report the change.” Castiel stated.
Dean...was good for him.
“I was a cop, remember. These things take time and it won’t change anything for you.” Dean stated leaning against the fence next to the curb. A car pulled up to Castiel’s house as Castiel stood cursing as the owner of the car pulled up moving to rush towards the house but was stopped.
“Like it? It took me months to get it this nice.” The dog spoke.
Dean carried in rainwater from his bucket for his spells, Dean had been throwing himself into his work lately. Slowly going back to his life...before Castiel. The boys glanced up from working on their school work before bed, seeing a soaked Dean come in. Dean ran his fingers through his wet hair as he glanced over at the boys.
love you, Dean. So much…” Castiel paused sadly. “...but I’m nowhere near my heat...and you had your rut the week before he left. I can’t get pregnant if neither of us is mated or in our mating weeks.”
.caught me coming out of the bedroom this morning.”
Castiel on the other hand never was recognizable. Castiel always wore heavy black eyeliner and had piercings he kept in when performing. The change was night and day to normal Castiel. Normal Castiel never had his hair slicked back, he had his one ear pierced but the rest were fake. That includes his eyebrow piercing, nose piercing, and multiple ear piercings. Castiel also had glasses which kept his Clark Kent powers of hiding up a lot. Singer Castiel was night and day compared to Normal Castiel.
Michael leaned down looking down Castiel’s running path, Michael kneeled near the beginning of the path near the ravine.
Castiel shot up looking at Dean in surprise as Dean opened his door.
“I try not to be,” Benny stated as Crowley noticed a large gash on his chest.
“Am I hungry?” Castiel scoffed as he followed after him.
“Think he will wake up?” Sam asked.
“Cas! Wow!” Charlie beamed gasping. “This is gorgeous! I can’t believe when I set you up this is where you two would end up!”
Dean sucked in air at the soft touch of his lips, the touch was so soft he almost thought he had dreamed it till Castiel pulled back. He seemed almost as surprised as Dean, slowly taking his hands off him.
“Yes, please.” Dean nodded as he walked over to the counter.
“Sam made a collar to translate barks into words. Unfortunately, Lucy is a sarcastic asshole.” Gabriel pet the dog as the dog panted.
“Hello, kids,” Castiel spoke.
“And them?” Castiel stated looking at their reflections. “...What’s their story?”
“Will you sit beside me?” Castiel asked as Dean pushed off the tree untying his belt laying it on the ground beside Castiel, he sat beside Castiel taking off his shoes.
“...Yeah.” Dean softly breathed his fingers, his face blushed red despite himself. Dean forgot to breathe. “...What about you? Do you love being here?” Castiel nodded softly looking away at that. Neither said anything for a long time unable to look at each other before Dean broke the tension.
“Is he safe?” Castiel spoke as Mary moved to rub his arms.
“Are you okay?” Benny whispered as Crowley nodded softly. Benny kissed Crowley’s forehead with care. Crowley nodded as Benny started following Castiel back to the car. Castiel laid Dean in the passenger seat as he ushered the beaten up Benny and Crowley to relax in the back. Benny gratefully took it, closing his eyes to rest and heal as Crowley pet his hair with love.
“How?” Dean asked him kissing his tears sorry he made Castiel so upset, he was just so angry at Castiel’s innocent ignorance.
“That’s not a love I want.” Castiel sank back into his seat crossing his arms.
“I don’t know...I have never been in love before.” Gabriel stated holding himself. “Sam’s the first person…”
“...It was a punishment,” Dean stated. “I broke the law and got thrown into a group home. Sonny’s place. He...He was good to me. I enjoyed my time there but it wasn’t meant to be.”
“Oh? What would you like to talk about?” Castiel asked with a loving sigh as Dean smiled softly leaning down to kiss him. Castiel moaned into the kiss which Dean smiled hearing that loving moan Castiel did involuntarily when they kissed. The kiss grew more heated, as Castiel’s hands moved to Dean’s ass. Castiel’s hands moving Dean to grind him on his hardened cock, Dean broke the kisses to moan and pant at the rubbing. Castiel’s hands moving to pull Dean’s sweats and underwear away from his body touching his bare skin. Dean shuddered at the touch moving his hips to help Castiel force his sweats and underwear off in one go. Castiel smirked in satisfaction seeing how desperately hard Dean was before he picking Dean up sitting him in the table desperately.
“...Mom...Dad...I...I think I’m gay.” Dean spoke, John who was drinking some water spit water onto the windshield. Dean tensed as Mary went to speak when she felt...a harsh pain on her stomach.
“This is far from where we were. We can stay for a bit.” Castiel commented. “It’s hidden in the woods, away from people. It seems safe to me.”
“It’s always winter.” Dean breathed.
“I-I...didn’t spill any water on me,” Castiel started looking down at the water as Dean looked worried.
“A man?!” Castiel snarled. “I asked for someone to love, not a man.”
___________________________________________________________________
“N-No.” Castiel tried to argue but he was in too much pain.
So sure, The Hunters were booked. The most popular punk bands were. Except for the fact, there was a huge rivalry with the current band on stage. Dean watched the blue-eyed singer singing his heart out as Dean put a cigarette to his lips. Honestly, Dean didn’t remember why they supposedly hated each other. Started with the lead singer dating Dean’s girlfriend at the time, then supposedly started a love triangle in the media. That turned into songs people assumed was about the girl. Dean supposedly still loved her, yada yada. Years later, now everyone expected a heated confrontation when the singers were even in the same building.
“It did till Sam pointed out I was wearing the same clothes as yesterday.” Castiel blushed.
“...You can have your human. Fuck him. Love him. But...I love you, Castiel...let me be your queen. Dean will never be accepted by our world...I can be your cover-” Crowley tried to kiss him but Castiel shoved him back again.
“No. You proved to me you aren’t that selfish cold person you believe yourself to be.” Benny touched his face with care.
“Sam.” The leader spoke as Sam protectively placed himself between Gabriel and the pack. “I wondered where you ran off too...but now I see where you have been. Playing slave to angels.”
Dean could hear an electronic female robot voice repeat as Dean’s eyes slid towards the sink and broken mirror. Next to the mirror, was a small machine that had read medications. Dean’s pain medications. Dean forced himself up, ignoring the broken glass that pressed into his hand using the sink for support to stand. Dean cried out in pain as his hip refused to allow him to stand and he barely had a moment to catch himself with the sink before he fell back into the broken glass just sitting in it.
“Hey!” Castiel called to Sam as Dean moved to quickly follow them laughing harder. “You idiots are HUMAN! Stop jumping off dangerous places!”
“...I don’t remember dying.” Castiel admitted as the man relaxed leaning back on his arms watching the house.
“I am so sorry, why didn’t you tell me?” Castiel scooped Dean up before he moved Dean into the tent lowering him to the bed.

“What’s the point? If you publish or say anything no one will believe you.” The demon spoke. “Is it worth it?”
“How do you...know so much about witches?” Castiel asked curiously.
Dean was right. They do strike up a conversation first. Was it his aura? What was it that made them want to speak to them? Castiel had lived here a couple of years now and this man never talked to him.
Dean breathed realizing Castiel pulled his underwear off with his pants, not caring for the fabric separating them from his naked body. Dean blushed at his hardened cock springing out at its release. Castiel’s eyes fell to it immediately as he tossed the pants away. Looking at Dean like he was starving he pulled Dean’s hips forward before Dean could react. Dean found himself straddling Castiel’s face, Dean blushing worried he was too heavy. Even this god-like being had a face limit?
Dean got to Sam’s house, Castiel eyeing the windows. It was a small cottage-like house, with white painted wood and a red door. It was cute and small. No one was inside. Castiel frowned only seeing a dog whose nose was pressed against the glass at the attention.
Sam laid Dean on the stone floor, covering him with a blanket he managed to keep dry. Lucifer placed Castiel in the middle of the room on a large boulder that was flat enough to use as a table. Castiel breathed in relief at the cold slab. It was so dark in there. He barely could make out the room in the lightning that flashed in the cave entrance. Gabriel and Balthazar attempted to light lanterns they brought for light casting the cave in some sort of light.
“Are you nervous?” Dean asked as Gabriel nodded holding the bottom of his shirt nervously. Dean sat down next to him. Gabriel moved to climb into his lap as Dean held the small angel close. Rubbing his back as Gabriel nuzzling into the crook of Dean’s neck.
“Thank you.” John breathed pretty happily with himself. “I only get one shot with this, so I hope it looks great.”
“I promised my wife I would come home early.” Benny beamed. “Lilith is teething and it’s driving her nuts.”
“I vaguely remember you saying that.” Castiel hummed, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck, Castiel just happy to kiss his lover.
“Let us get him cleaned up while you rest.” Michael breathed as Castiel hesitantly handed over his baby that Gabriel cooed to the baby that the omegas gushed over. Castiel laid back on the stone, he winced seeing a blinding light from a small crack in the cave. The sun peeking in from outside, Castiel breathed in its warmth glow before he glanced forward to see Gabriel and Michael with his son. Castiel sighed happily when he noticed...something odd. Outside, it was still roughly storming, Castiel had missed this during his birth...so why was their sunlight poking in.
“They are going to be okay. I promise.” Dean panted as he cupped Castiel’s face. “Come on, we need to zipline to the other side. Can you hold onto me? This isn’t going to hold.” Castiel blinked out of it as he looked where Sam and Gabriel fell. “Shit. You’re in shock.”
“I would do it again in a heartbeat-” Castiel waved him off when Dean pulled him into a loving kiss. Castiel moaned lovingly kissed back feeling himself desperately move to pull off Dean’s shirt as Dean picked him up carrying him to the bedroom with a door slammed.
“Easy,” Castiel spoke as Dean tensed. “He can sense your nervousness.”
“Yeah. He ran the same path every day.” Gabriel explained blowing out smoke. “This is the house we grew up in, We inherited it when my parents died. I wanted nothing to do with it. Said the place must have been cursed or something to have both our parents die in it...but he said it had good memories. So I let him have it.”
“Boys!” A voice called happily. Dean turned seeing a red-headed witch Dean recognized.
_________________________________________________________________________
“How about who are you? What are you doing in my house?” Castiel tried.
“I’m Maggie. I’m a ghost.” She spoke as she disappeared for a second and appeared next to Dean who jumped.
“-I don’t even REMEMBER the last time I got laid.” The maintenance man laughed bitterly as he finished the window. “...Man, I wish-” Dean got up at the word, slamming his hand on the table as he stood. Castiel jumped at Dean’s action, watching Dean as he moved to him.
“Your heat is soon.” The leader smirked with malice. “I wouldn’t mind teaching you what a true alpha can make you feel like.” Gabriel backed away. “What do you say, my little spitfire? How about I make you mine-?”
“I figured.” Castiel touched it as Dean reached back grabbing a towel from the back.
“John, Dean and his cute boyfriend are here,” Mary called as John turned to him pulling the magnifier off his face smiling. Castiel couldn’t help but smile back as John stood moving to take his hand and shake it. Castiel took in John’s scrappy appearance of a beard and tanned skin. His black hair was very short compared to his beard. Castiel could see Dean got his smile from John, as well as his handshake.
“Morning,” John whispered licking her fur as she stretched.
“I will take him,” Castiel spoke simply. “Can you have him come straight here when he starts work today.”
“That’s because you missed the other seasons.” Sam sighed sadly.
“...You could have lied to me.” Dean chuckled as Castiel shook his head no. “But you didn’t even try to hide it.”
“Yes! I see!” Gabriel giggled as Dean pulled his face close smothering it with kisses as Gabriel playfully giggled loudly before Dean pulled back.
“I’m surprised your wound didn’t heal.” Castiel commented. “It’s almost like-”
“Why wouldn’t he? If...he knows how much I love you...how could he say no?” Sam asked as tears filled Gabriel’s eyes as he moved to hug him tightly. Sam held him close, nuzzling him when Gabriel felt a lurch to his stomach. Gabriel yanked away moving out of the cave before vomiting into a bush. Sam looked concerned getting up to follow him, Gabriel caught his breath panting as he tried not to be sick again. “There must be something wrong. I never have seen you sick like this.”
“T-Thank-!” Crowley called as the door closed without care, the two boys exchanged looks as Benny quickly got up helping Crowley up.
“I can’t deny love,” Castiel mumbled.
“Excuse me, where are we?” Dean asked the driver who held the door open.
Dean got into their Summer home angrily shaking his hand which stung from the hit to his husband’s face as Castiel came in after him holding ice to his nose as Michael and lucifer put the kids down for the nap. Castiel tried to put ice on his mate’s hand which bled from the hit but Dean kept shaking his hand from the pain moving away from him. Their summer home was in the countryside of Kansas, a city away from Lawerence. Normally they would avoid Lawerence, Driving the long way around to get to their summer home in Topeka but still close give Dean a feeling of home. The fact that Castiel brought them through Lawerence, Dean knew.
“I hate you!” Dean laughed throwing the ice cream cone at his dumb head. Castiel kept snickering as he pulled Dean close wrapping his arms around him and rubbing the baby bump. “Cas, pick up your ice cream before it melts.” Dean laughed pulling away from Castiel as Castiel kneeled down to grab his ice cream. Dean opened his own drumstick, which he had been craving. The baby loved the ice cream and the frozen chocolate on the bottom. Dean loved it too. Castiel watched Dean chewing hungrily on his ice cream. Castiel leaned against the counter watching his mate with love hesitating to say what he wanted to say. Dean paused his chewing, eyeing him.
“What are you sorry for?” Sam breathed.
“...I thought it would be okay to watch them from afar. My first den was close to here...but then they got a fucking puppy. I couldn’t stomach seeing them after that. I left far into the forest until I could no longer hear them. That’s where I’ve been ever since.” John confessed as Sarah nuzzled into him. John closed his eyes softly taking her comfort when another child’s laughter made John flinch. “Come on. We went too far.”
,” Sarah spoke with her head held high. “Except I’m
Besides, no one was trusted to change the prince besides another omega, in case beta had some ideas. It was only a bonus that Gabriel also happened to be a boy. Gabriel was a servant so he was less sought after, but still very wanted. It just shocked him that...Gabriel had agreed to Sam. Despite his father believing in this match. It was Gabriel who made the ultimate decision. Gabriel said yes.
Castiel patted his person before he gave up turning to run when something like a big stick came at his face knocking him out.
“What about a censor for his mouth?” Dean asked.
Castiel had a list of things he needed to do today, the first thing being Dean needed necessities if he was going to live here for ten years. Castiel jumped feeling something brush against his ass, making Castiel turn to swat off whatever it was only to see Dean touching the boxers curiously.
“They are lucky to have you.” The fae spoke, Dean whimpered slightly in pain as the fae slowed his hands. “Just as I was lucky to have been found by you. I thank you for keeping me till I get well. You didn’t have to risk you and your family, but I appreciate it.” Dean said nothing eyeing his face.
Castiel jumped into his arms wrapping his legs around his waist as he kissed him desperately. Dean barely had time to catch him stumbling back into his bed. They fell onto the bed as Castiel cupped Dean’s bulge with lust.
...this was one of the best ones.
“Hey...It’s okay.” The man’s voice startled him back to reality. The man kneeling in front of him, touching his shoulder. “...It’s going to be okay. I’m here.” Castiel choked out a harsh sob moving to hold the man in the tight hug. A sobbing mess of tears, snot, and salvia in his mess of a break down in the middle of the street. The man held him throughout his whole breakdown. Letting Castiel cry it out.
“I would be honored,” Dean admitted as he held out his arm for Castiel to take. Castiel smiled softly before he took it, walking down to the party. The party was already under full swing, admittedly the pair fashionably late. Castiel was glad it wasn’t a sit-down dinner, but more of a buffet snack as you go party. No one really noticed them in the crowd of so many others.
“He’s obvious.” Sam sighed. “He loves Castiel as a childhood hero, but I don’t think love is on his mind.”
“...Will you stay?” Castiel asked. “...I’m going to need my right hand.” Gabriel smiled at that softly leaning back in the tub. “Especially when the baby comes.”
“This is your old village,” Castiel spoke as Dean nodded. Dean lit up as he started to speak.
“The light place?” Castiel asked, Jack leaned in like it was a secret.
“Rebels?” Crowley asked as Castiel nodded.
“A dog?!” Bobby hissed embarrassed. “A stupid slaved dog?!”
“Okay.” Castiel cleared his throat. “That’s excellent. Wonderful news.” Dean nodded before he stood.
Dean kneeled to rub Colonel’s face as Castiel walked towards the house. Stopping when he noticed the back door was open. Castiel tilted his head confused as he turned to Dean.
“So, what do we do if he doesn’t wake up?” Sam asked as Dean cleaned the cloth in the watering bowl and moved to clean up the dried blood off the man’s face.
“...Look, what’s going to happen to us?” Eve asked as Crowley smiled at her stubbornness.
“He...didn’t go to the crossroads,” Castiel whispered as he slowly moved to grab his notebook sitting at the table as Dean moved to sit in front of his curiously eyeing the human food he had.
Castiel pulled open the folder looking at the papers inside, Birth certificates, large papers dedicated to Mary and John. Full of their crimes and things they had done. He bypassed them though, going to the children’s files. Each had one page, though Dean did have two due to some past trouble with his drug selling, Dean’s photo attached was a mug shot. Dean was a teen in it with the cutest annoyed look and a black eye. Caused after Dean got into a fight which was the reason he was arrested and had to spend the night in a cell. Till their caregiver, Missouri, convinced the man to drop the charges against Dean. Besides that though, They were both perfect children. It was such a shock to see his mate’s life able to fit on a couple of pieces of paper.
________________________________________________________________________
“I-I love you too, Dean.” Castiel honestly didn’t understand, tears filled his eyes and Dean sighed. Understanding there was a culture thing, Dean was failing to grasp. Dean pulled the upset Castiel closer as Castiel immediately busted into tears.
“Just because I just know how it feels.” The man explained looking at her, exposing the glowing brown eyes behind the sunglasses.
“Get your hands OFF my knight!” Castiel hissed getting in the face of the men beating Dean. “Unless you want to call off the mating! I recommend you stop!” Alastair looked annoyed but waved them off.
“So unless you get married, you lose everything?” Dean asked as Castiel nodded.
“You guys! You’re going to get in trouble! You aren’t supposed to be up there! What if you bother the king?” Joanna asked.
“T-There’s smoke! In the direction of Sarah’s cave! I-I just got a horrible feeling!” Jody choked as Bobby stood with worry.
“Good.” Castiel pulled back wiping his tears. “I would be so mad if you did!” Castiel playfully slapped him. Dean chuckled rubbing his back with care letting Castiel breathe and calm down from his tears. “...Are you sure you are okay?”
“...Do they know?” Castiel asked so softly that Dean turned to look at him.
“Are you trying to kill us?” Castiel coughed.
“Q-Queen?!” Eve choked in surprise looking at Dean before moving to bow. “I-I’m sorry!”
“Well, why I work on the spell to send you back, why don’t you and master Castiel enjoy a meal,” Rowena explained. “Food should be ready.”
“Be good,” Dean spoke as he kissed his brothers before they headed out towards the town. They were always safe. Dean performing magic to keep them safe. Even having one of the stray cats follow behind them, Castiel noticed the cats were protective of the boys. He could feel the magic on them that they could use to protect the boys if necessary but it never was. Castiel watched the fat orange and white striped cat follow after them.
The boys moved to catch up as Castiel and Gabriel climbed into the back seat of the impala, so confused and startled by the new world. But they followed orders as they asked questions stripping into the strange clothes Rowena had brought them.
“Just observing.” The man panted for a moment before taking a deep breath and standing straight. “I notice you run at the same time every morning, sounds...fun.” He started making a face to show he did not like that idea. “But wouldn’t you like to do something fun with your time?”
“...I think we failed already.” Gabriel sighed. “We were supposed to bring back the angels.”
“You need my blood,” Dean argued back.
When they broke the kiss, they panted against their lips holding him close. Both opening their eyes to glance at each other, eyeing each other. Dean swallowed as they continued to breathe against each other lips.
“No, you are pregnant,” Sam stated.
Gordon cursed before he looked around before walking to the front door. He peered out the peephole seeing security hanging out near the front door, talking to the other security guard who was about to take over for the late shift.
“I thought I was his baby.” Dean teased half-listening as Castiel smiled with love at him.
“Sorry, I hope you don’t mind keeping me longer,” Castiel stated as Dean eyed him.
“Hello? Mom?... What’s wrong?” Dean commented suddenly worried by his mother’s frantic talking before Dean grabbed the remote and turned on the tv.
“You’re going to regret this day.” Sarah breathed. “I don’t know how, or when...but when you think back to this moment...you’ll remember it’s your fault...If you change your mind I will be up the mountain, near a river and a field of flowers. There you can find your daughter and grandchild when you’re ready.” Sarah transformed leaving the cave, leaving the rest to remember her words.
“He locks it when he knows company is coming,” Ellen stated as Castiel frowned softly before he walked up to Dean’s apartment.
“Come on, eat up,” Dean stated. “I got somewhere to take you.”
“Um, I’m a singer,” Castiel spoke hesitating, man, he was always bad at talking about himself.
Sam nodded picking up the first paper, he read the note which talked about making a battery they were designing to last over eight hours. They said the battery seemed to die at exactly eight hours. Their issue was they didn’t want people who traveled by bus or lived far away to not be able to use the product after working eight hours. Sam eyed the semantics looking at what their problem was.
Gabriel sat on the bench at the entrance nervously as Dean kneeled down to the shy angel, Dean had gone out of his way to make Gabriel’s birthday the best, he had gotten him brand new clothes. The house was decorated wonderfully by everyone. Castiel even managed to have rent build-a-bear stuff to be delivered so the kids could make their own toy. Dean didn’t know how he managed that, but humans came in that morning and set it up. Jo was left instructions on how to make the bears and stuff like that, so she would fluff them up.
“Come sit.” Castiel cooed softly as he moved into the bathroom to grab some pills, he placed two into Dean’s hand holding a cup of water. “Take this. Just put the pills in your mouth and swallow with water. It will help you sleep.”
“It’s always the same. They take our baby. They always take him-” Dean panted as Castiel kissed his forehead just rocking Dean. Dean took a slow calming breath.
“Don’t worry, Master. Your baby won’t be able to catch a human illness.” Gabriel spoke as Castiel turned to him.
. A noise he couldn’t describe more than an empty plastic water bottle being stepped on.
“Thank you, Anna.” Castiel beamed as Charlie took his hand leading him towards the house.
“T….Then what?” Castiel swallowed as Dean blinked as though stepping out of his head realizing this was still instructional.
“Are you hungry?” Sam asked as Gabriel made a face covering his mouth like he would vomit.
“So you were close with your dad?” Castiel asked as the whale moved up to the surface, they laughed at it expelling water from its blowhole as Dean took the opportunity to get off and back onto the surface of the water to walk back to the shore. Castiel was helped up.
“...What if they don’t like me?” Gabriel asked as Dean tensed at the thought, tears filling his eyes. “...I’m scared what if they pull out my feathers again?”
Ok, so this was going to be an honest conversation. Sam would definitely have to be breaking them out tonight.
Donna is dead, and she knows this is her eternity. She knows it’s better than Hell, The Empty, or Purgatory but she can’t let it go. She can’t stop trying. Logically she knows that nothing will ever come of it, nothing will change, and what she is attempting is impossible, but deep down in some part of her she can’t help Donna believes that if she can just convince one person, if only for an instant, that she can change things. She was a police officer. She is used to being able to plug away at a task, stick with it, and get the result she’s looking for. If she can just ask the right question… If she can just make the right point…
“I think he does” Dean murmured almost to himself.
There would be a new town, a new society, a new way of being human. The village of Pembrokeshire, in the county of Mersey, lies on a wide, happy plain, which, in a few years, was to become known as the “Land of the Endless Mountains.” And sometime after that “Nepal”. Once all other humans were dead, in the desert and in the plain, the mountains would be pulled from the ground, Noah would land, and humans would begin again.
Oh, my crazy baby
Dean grabs the sides of Castiel’s face and kisses him roughly. He pulls away from the kiss, looks as though he is going to say something, shakes his head and kisses Cas again, before pulling away and shoving Cas back hard. Cas stumbles a little step backwards. Dean’s face is set with stubborn fury. No one notices Jack de-materialize and sneak out. He has other jobs to do.
Through force of will Castiel was able to retain an appreciation of music after the return of his grace that he could not retain for food. Where he could not move beyond the feeling of each molecule pressing on his tongue, he could put aside the logic of sound waves and retain some of the human emotion of music. It was a little more work as an Angel than as a human, but he felt it was worth it.
“Mostly. I also want to talk to you about your future too.”
----------------------
Cas stood frozen. Dean wanted him for something… more. Something different. Dean spoke of love, and of partnership while speaking of Cas. Castiel felt a strange giddy sensation in his body as he watched two ants carry a fallen comrade away from the waves and toward their nest. Cas’s body felt puzzlingly warm, and he felt like running, and yelling, and laughing, and singing all at once, but he could only manage to hold himself perfectly still. He was happy, he realized. Really, truly, deeply happy!
Garth’s expression didn’t change, but Dean looked confused. “I mean, I’ve been friendly, maybe a little flirty, but not seriously. I haven’t made a pass at her or anything.”
The Barista calls Cas’s name and redirects his focus. He sees the slight moment of surprise and registers that the barista had been expecting a woman from the name. He gathers the three coffees and heads back to the table to help.
“Will that help you focus?”
Dean was grinning. He’d been having fun apparently. Sam was already getting a little impatient. He’d better talk to the voice of reason here.
Donna never was one to hold on to cynicism very long, and when she looks at Jack she feels a trust and an earnestness in him that she can't imagine feeling from Chuck. She believes him, she believes he can make it better.
“Well I hate to break it to you sweetie, but you aren’t exactly describing Hell.”
As Jesse, Cesar, Sam, Castiel, and Dean sat in chairs on the beach drinking small glasses of local spirits they had to agree that this was paradise. Each felt the heavy burdens of memory that they carried lighten a little as the heat from the sand mingled with the cool sea breeze and gently brushed away their stress. They listened half attending as Jesse and Cesar described the job.
“So for the first time in your entire life you have reason to believe that ultimately, it’s going to be ok. Excuse me for assuming your feelings, but that must be really weird.”
“Sonny, down here I’m a Queen. Why would I help you take away my throne? What could possibly be in it for me?”
“Dean, you spent the majority of your life looking out for the people you care about and saving as many people as you could. You still won’t fully let go of hunting because you know you can save people still. Now you have a civilian job, and what do you do? You save cars! Hell, you’re in this domestic bliss situation because you saved your boyfriend from death. Again.
Rowena’s smile and energy snap off like a light switch as the door shuts behind the demons. She sits alone on the throne deflated and despondent. She rubs her face, and when she looks up Jack is standing in front of the door watching her. Seeing him jolts her with a fresh force of pain and longing. Hundreds of years of instinct kick in to override her shock and turn the charm back on.
“Never again” Castiel almost whispers. “I will never leave you again. That was the last time.”
“Yeah, how the hell did you get anyone to give you a degree in Hunter Therapy?”
“I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Castiel listened with his sensitive Angelic hearing to the sound of Sam’s retreating footsteps. He listened as Sam walked to his bedroom, sat on the edge of the bed and cried.
“Hello Jack, you look well”
“Well, have you had these behaviors in the past? What was going on between you two when you’ve acted like this before.”
Dean smiled into the fire despite himself.
We snuck up on them about an hour before sunset. Found all three of them still sleeping. We took all three heads off in about 5 minutes. I guess being buff doesn’t help you when you get your head cut off mid nap. After that we hung around until sunset to make sure no one else was coming home. Then we dragged all three bodies out into the desert and buried them the best we could in the sand. It took a couple hours to do a passable job, but we weren’t near anyone and we had all night.”
“That’s your fight or flight right there. Your digestion slows down, your heart speeds up. Your blood flows out to your limbs to prep your muscles. Your vision may narrow, your memory can be too fuzzy, or too clear. You might have trouble listening to what people are saying to you. It’s a biological response to your environment that is designed to run for short periods in times of danger. And I would bet it feels very very familiar to you.”
“So we managed to search all three of their belongings and they each had a business card from something called Gladiator Man Camp. Obviously we were going to check that out.”
“My ankle is swollen but...it’s feeling better to keep off of it.” She admitted laying her head on her good paw.
“Fuck no!” The collar sounded. “You fetch, I no go.” Gabriel glanced up at Castiel amused.
“He has her spirit most of all, in the shape of his expressions. It’s like I see a ghost.” Bobby leaned down to nuzzle the pup to walk when he fell. Booker licked bobby’s snout as Bobby walked with them. Most of the wolves were asleep. Except for the night patrol wolves that guarded the den.
“I can’t
“I guess not.” Jess couldn’t argue with that, Jess wouldn’t have believed even she would eat in a fancy place like that. Charlie locked up the van like normal, making it seem like Jess was inside for the night.
Dean nodded before he closed the door and chewed on his snack. Castiel changed their license plates, stealing it from another car. When he finished, he got back into the car seeing Dean snacking. Castiel softly patted Dean’s belly as he started the car.
“Sure.” Castiel smiled nervously which made Dean beam happily.
“What are you hoping to see?” Dean eyed him.
“...I...I didn’t.” Crowley admitted holding himself.
“...I just-...” Dean glanced around seeing Gabriel was gone as he heard Gabriel’s truck driving down the driveway leaving him alone.
“...I wish this could be forever.” Castiel’s voice made Dean turn to him. “...You, me...getting fat.”
“Come omega.” Alastair wrapped an arm around him tightly. He stank of booze and Castiel had to keep from vomiting again. Dean tensed following after them as they walked towards the boat. “To feast and be merry! For tonight we start our kingdom!”
“I’m lucky, there were still some chickens who lived here, and there were still some fishing nets,” Dean commented happily. Castiel paused slightly, when...he remembered where they were…
Michael watched crime scene investigators walking around, taking photos of blood splatters on the tree or ground. Michael sat a bit back taking their first break since he started the case. Watching as a large heavy bloody branch was bagged and walked past them.
“Cas,” Sam spoke getting his attention, Castiel turned to face Sam ignoring the omega snuggled in his lap. “What if...I start taking over your responsibilities?” Castiel eyes widen in surprise. Sam slightly coward under his gaze. Was that too much to offer? He didn’t want to seem like he was using his brother’s husband. “Think of me as your apprentice. I can slowly start taking over the responsibilities, we can be partners in crime.”
“I think it is just muscle memories,” Dean admitted as he petted Castiel’s hair. “...and Well, I got some other stuff to try.”
Jess sucked in air tears filled her eyes as Charlie eyed her face with care slowly before moving to walk past her towards the restaurant. However, Jess grabbed her wrist turning her back into her. Charlie sucked in the air in Jess’s arms as Jess looked into her eyes. Charlie watched Jess lean in which Charlie slowly moved towards her.
“Dean?!” Castiel sat up turning to look out the back of the carriage seeing Dean go back into his tent as the camp disappeared from his view. Castiel’s heart was racing with worry, Dean was staying back?! “Dean!”

“Hey, come on, he’s going to see our pups and accept us with open arms.” John beamed as Sarah laughed loudly wagging her tail as they moved to walk back down the mountainside back to their home. John dramatically acting out her father finding out about his future grandkids.
“...We can’t be too sure. There is blood across the other side of the river, and the river took a lot of blood as well.” Anna stated but Michael looked at her. She got the hint. “I don’t think we are looking for a kidnapping, this is definitely a murder. A brutal one. If he’s still alive, I would be impressed.”
“He’s so handsome!” Crowley blushed holding his face as Benny’s smile fell.
_________________________________________________________________________
“God, at this point, it was so redundant now I don’t even remember,” Dean stated. “We just never really got along well, Always clashed...I think he always saw my mother in me.”
“Slept...like for a long time?” Castiel whispered, wanting to ask more but the door rang. Castiel moved to open it seeing the maintenance man. The maintenance man was an older gentleman, he lived somewhere on the first floor if Castiel remembered correctly. He was a little older than sixty, Castiel figured. Potbelly, balding on top and always a bit dirty from his daily job.
“I brought you some dinner, I figured we can watch a Christmas prince and pig out,” Castiel spoke as Dean just stared at him staring at the man he loved.
“Stupid snitching bitch, I won't let you testify against me.” Alastair angrily getting up he pulled a gun from pocket pointing it at Claire. Claire glanced back with a gasp, as Dean turned only quickly barely blocking Claire with his body as three gunshots sounded. The sound of Police sirens coming. Dean barely registered the pain as he heard Alastair curse and run away. Claire looked at him in tears as Dean slowly looked down at his chest seeing two bullet holes in his chest. Dean slowly fell backward as Claire screamed coming down to kneel next to him. Holding his hand as blood pooled under Dean. Dean wheezed and choked blood coming from his mouth as Meg came up to her.
“Jimmy and Cain are in the guest house. I can text them if I need to get up.” Dean commented as Castiel leaned down and kissed him.
“A witch knows the bible?” The fae asked amused as Dean gave him an amused look back.
“Charlie.” A voice spoke as Charlie turned to notice her boss coming.
“We are going somewhere. Anywhere.” Dean commented worried as he moved to grab stuff from their drawers. “Just till this blows over.”
“Do you love having me around?” Castiel chuckled as Dean eyed his face.
“Did you know anyone who would want to hurt him?” Michael asked.
“No, I was...the youngest angel. I never had the opportunity to mate.” Castiel stated. “Besides, I wouldn’t have a wife.”
“You really love the horses,” Castiel commented.
“I can see what I can do.” Castiel nodded as Dean smiled leaning in cupping his face and kissing him. “Go eat.”
“MY TURN!” Dean yelled. Castiel glanced up at a sound and cursed reaching up to catch Dean who had jumped off spinning him again at the momentum.
“I like that.” Adam beamed.
“-Why you came.” Dean looked away softly opening a secret compartment on the floor. Castiel blinked in surprise as Dean slowly pulled out different parts of silver and gold armor. Castiel slowly moved to it as Dean continued to sob and pull out heavier and heavier armor till he was struggling to lift the breastplate. Castiel watched Dean breaking into a million pieces as he took these pieces out. A hand on Dean’s hand stopped Dean’s attempts to lift it. Castiel slowly took the last piece out holding the armor in his hands.
“Thank you.” Castiel blushed as Dean took his hand.
“Good idea,” Castiel spoke taken back. “Um…”
“Don’t be so modest.” Castiel cooed as Dean eyed him, it had been a couple of weeks since they...had sex. Dean kept a close eye on him to see if there were signs...of pregnancy. Even Castiel found himself keeping an eye on himself. Looking to signs of a child. Though...he couldn’t remember the life of angels and procreation. It had been so long since he had even heard of an angel pregnancy, he didn’t know what signs to watch out for.
“Even with the smell,” Castiel stated as Castiel held him tight. “Thank you for being mine and giving me a family.” Tears filled Castiel’s eyes as Dean cupped his face kissing him. “I’m sorry...I’m sorry this is happening. I’m sorry we have to live in hiding, I’m sorry you gave birth without me-”
“Uh, huh.” Dean agreed mocking as Castiel laughed at his mocking.
“So-” Castiel started awkwardly as Dean leaned into him.
“I-I should go feed my water.” Dean lied horribly standing, Castiel watched him go, Dean lightly bumping into a wall trying for his smooth exit but failed. Dean moved around the corner covering his face in embarrassment leaving Castiel alone.
“You…don’t know who I am?” Dean asked as the Fae shook his head weakly before noticing the smaller children, he eyed them confused before he returned his eyes to Dean.
“...We’re friends now?” Sam asked touching Gabriel’s hand pressing it against his face. Gabriel rolled his eyes amused.
“I got to work now that I came down here.” Castiel snorted as Dean smiled at him.
“Then...how would you-?” Dean asked confused as Castiel walked over to him not saying anything.
“Put your glasses on,” Dean commented protectively turning Castiel towards him shielding his face which Castiel understood meant that there was someone taking photos. Castiel shielded his face as Dean led him through the crowd of people who were flashing photos at them.
“Normally, they call you pup till after their first deal.” The demon explained as he picked up some glass in his hand. “...You’re my first deal. Normally we take their names in honor of our first deal...but since I’m stuck with you for ten years that might be a little awkward…”
“Run!” Dean laughed as Castiel bolted with him. They ran out of the secret night club and towards the night air. They ran till they couldn’t run anymore, Dean and Castiel collapsing in a park as they were silent catching their breath before they busted up laughing.
“I went early and bought some before the curfew closing time.” Castiel beamed as Dean reached for his fries and burgers.
“I-I’ll keep my clothes on.” Castiel choked as Dean raised an eyebrow.
“Yeah. I woke up with it the morning after we had sex.” Castiel stated as Dean glanced up in shock. “I-I was going to tell you-”
Sam called as Dean nodded covering his ears and burying his face into Sam’s shirt. He heard someone bolting into their house. Checking the rooms, Sam pulled the trigger when he heard someone coming in.
“We have different means of transportation,” Dean explained. “Horses...Horses are a real treat. You gotta be rich to have one.” Dean brushed the horse’s hair cleaning it of dust.
John yelled as he grunted in pain moving to fire again. “
Dean shook his head no, eating it with his hands as Castiel grabbed his own slice deciding to join him. Dean eyed him amused as they silently ate. Enjoying themselves just stuffing their faces with all the sweets they could eat. It felt like the good old times, Dean and Castiel enjoying life in the castle. Enjoying their own world away from reality...where it was just them. They placed the trays to the side tables once finished just laying beside each other in bed.
Castiel’s eyes softened at the drawing as he kneeled to be at height level and touched the carved wood under his fingers. It looked like he was just drawn seconds ago like this little girl felt so alive even now. All of her that remained was her drawing. Dean noticed Castiel lost in thought at the drawing.
"Sometime before coming into the restaurant, where they were gonna have their date, Sam had dropped the ring, right in the middle of the sidewalk. Now, lucky for him, Eileen saw him drop it. She'd actually been watching him fidget with the ring the entire night, so kinda guessed what was coming. So, when the ring fell from Sam, Eileen picked it up, pocketed it, didn't say a thing. So Sam's at the restaurant, frantically searching his pockets," Dean started acting the motions out bringing laughter from the tables. "'Where's the ring oh god I've lost the ring I've ruined everything.' It's like that scene in the Hobbit, when Gollum's lost the ring," Dean spoke, imitating a Gollum voice "'where's the precious, where is it-'" The audience laughed louder and Dean paused, waiting for them to calm down.
Dean faltered for a moment, then he remembered what Amara had said.
Sam walked into the bunker library, having done nothing but sit in his room for two whole days. Not a lot else to do anyways.
Sam Winchester, lay in his room, still half asleep. He curled further into his covers, trying his best to ignore the music drift back off.
“So what,” Dean gestured to all the books around them, and sat across the table from Sam. “Did you happen to find anything?”
His hand shook with the effort. As his eyes glowed brighter, the cover of the book began to light up as well. There was a slight whine in the air as the grace worked to open the book.
Dean shook his head. “Sorry Chuck.”
"Please stay..." He said quietly. Cas paused for a moment then sat back down.
“You’re gonna let a dog sit in the impala?” Sam looked skeptical, the ‘No dogs in the impala’ rule Dean had placed a few years ago still fresh in his mind.
They reached out their hands, as though they knew what to do almost on instinct.
~Inherit the Earth~
They both melted into it, feeling the warmth of each other, secure in the knowledge that both of them were loved.
Michael looked between Jack and the dead plant. “What happened to you?”
Dean nodded. "You just need to let us go."
"Cas- Cas? Hey buddy you with me?" Cas slumped weakly against the wall. His eyes fluttered open, out of focus, dazed and in pain. Dean couldn't see anything hurt, but he guessed that whatever injuries came the empty were not exactly physical ones.
“Ok,” Jack began. “This started happening a bit ago, but at the time I didn’t tell you guys cause we were so busy with everything else but… well… anyways…” Jack grabbed a plant and placed it in front of him.
"I didn't-"
“The people, the birds, Cas,” Dean growled. “You gotta bring him back.”
With another swish he sent Sam and Dean hurling towards the beach. They crashed into the sand and logs, feeling the wind getting knocked out of them.
“Because,” Sam began to say, breathless. “You lose.” They laughed again, and glanced beyond Chuck.
There was a moment of silence, Dean still staring into his coffee, feeling Cas's eyes on him. Then Cas sighed.
—[4 days earlier]—
Dean watched the people pass by, basking in the knowledge that they had won. Surrounded by the lives of a billion other humans, reminding him over and over again that they had won.
“Well that would mean either or both of us dead, Jack’d be probably dead too. Cas would…. Cas would probably still be alive….”
“I’m sure he’s aware I took your side against him.” He started walking towards them down the aisle. “I’ve avoided using any powers that might attract his attention.”
"They're with Cas. I think he's trying to teach them mini-golf."
"Dean, my wedding is like in..." Sam leaned over looking at his alarm clock. It was 8 in the morning. "... seven hours."
“You got what you wanted from me.” Cas spoke in a low voice. “You stole my chance at happiness, but that doesn't matter. I saved Dean Winchester, my purpose has been fulfilled.” Cas stood up, facing it. “Nothing you can say or do will make me regret my sacrifice for him.”
Dean felt his stomach twist up in knots. There really were no other options.
"Hmm?"
"And we will be here for Christmas. I expect to see a big tree, lots of decorations, Home Alone set up, ready to watch..."
"Cas? Cas!"
“Wait a minute, how are you sensing anything? I thought you were powered down.” Dean closed his computer, posing a reasonable question.
A hand suddenly reached out of the darkness and gripped Castiel’s throat, choking him. He was slammed against an invisible wall and another hand reached to cover his mouth.
“I feel something…” He didn’t know how to describe it. “…Weird.”
"Stop it. I said stop it. Just... stop."
“Guys…” Chuck called after them. “Guys wait!”
“Alright,” Sam said, sitting in the library and tapping God’s death book. “We need this book open for this plan right?”
“So… take care of the bunker while we’re gone okay?” He turned to go, and made it halfway down the hall when he heard the creak of Jack’s door open.
"There's a bit of a problem with that." Michael started to explain. "The empty doesn't care about me. I'm simply another celestial passing through the abyss with an eventual resurrection, while Castiel, I'm sorry to say, made a deal. I doubt the empty would give him up willingly."
Dean and Cas spun, looking like they'd been caught with both hands in the cookie jar.
Cheers erupted from the crowd as Sam leaned in, kissing Eileen. There were smiles, laughter, bells rang. The ceremony had been set up outside on the grass where a small set of trees sat by a sparkling lake, a park picked out by Eileen herself.
Betty began reading. “Behold, In the end, there is an ending of he who created the beginning. And thus it will be-“
Chuck stared in confused horror. The pages were blank, nothing written. Chuck reached out, grabbing the pages and turning them over, flipping through them in a desperate attempt to find something, anything.
Dean looked around, horror in his expression.
“Just-“ Sam opened his coat, taking an angel blade out from the inside. “Take this with you.”
“Come on guys…” Chuck slowly walked around them. “Just stay down.”
“You’re…. efforts?” Sam said, a bit confused.
He approached the map table, book in hand and placed it with a thump on the table.
Jack shook his head. "The empty is the embodiment of nothing. I exploded with enough energy to kill two gods," He gave an uncomfortable glance at Amara. "It barely did anything besides shake it."
Cas stood stunned, face completely red. Dean grinned.
“Yeah, and why does that something always seem to be you.”)
"Yeah?" Cas said, still quite.
Michael laughed. “I believe I share that sentiment. Life may finally be settling down for once.”
“We have no time to lose, lets go!!” Sam said. He rounded the table, grabbing his discarded coat off a chair and running full pelt toward the bunker garage, Dean and Jack right behind him.
“There’s nothing there.” Chuck’s voice quivered at the edge of being unnerved.
“You exploded in the Empty…” he repeated, “You exploded…. Oh.”
"Castiel is reliving every worst moment caused by you. Watching himself murder a million copies of you. Forced to kill you over and over and over again getting him ready for the big one."
— (Roll opening credits)—
“He sacrificed his life for me, Sam! ME! I gotta be the one that rescue’s him!”
The following years were some of the best of their lives. Jack stuck around for the first few years, but ultimately went up to work in heaven. He came around for the holidays of course, sent in messages, visited. It was nice to know that the current surrogate god was just a phone call away.
Michael hummed in response.
Dean sat in the bunker kitchen, cup of coffee in hand. The coffee was getting cold but Dean didn't care. He still sipped it anyways.
It was Uriel, a hateful malicious smile spread across his face. Castiel shook his head under Uriel's grip, wondering if this was another painful memory, somehow more real than the others.
Chuck looked between them.
“You ok?” Sam asked, clearly reading that his brother was not ok, but he asked nonetheless.
Michael looked at him. “How did the three of you manage?”
It put its hands in its pockets and sneered at Dean.
Dean strolled in the main room of the bunker, headache still strong, the now empty bottle of whiskey still in his hand. He looked across the room and his eyes landed on the far table.
Jack sat in the back of the car, asleep, while Sam and Dean groused about Chuck in the front.
Shock surged through Dean, the distinct memory of stabbing this guy up through the head came forward in the mind.
"Hey, hey hey." Dean was straining. Cas was being pulled into the darkness below him. It was already up to his waist now.
Dean rose with a now bloody face, trying to hit Chuck. Chuck just pushed him away, beating him back down. He kicked Dean in the side, then turned and sent his foot straight into Sam’s nose.
"You may now kiss the bride."
Jack frowned. “Wait… won’t God be alerted by your pow-…” With a subtle flapping sound, Michael disappeared. “…ers.”
"Dean!" There were running feet, and Sam knelt beside Dean. "You're okay!"
Dean came through the portal and was immediately staggered by how completely devoid of everything familiar it was.
It couldn't be Uriel. He couldn't be here!
It was late, and while everyone gradually made their way to their beds, Dean beckoned Cas to the hallway.
“That’s enough guys.” Chuck warned. But they pushed themselves to their knees. “Guys, come on, that’s enough, I said that's enough!”
It was like every worry had suddenly left him, all that mattered was that he could take care of this dog, a last hope that they weren’t the only ones left.
He passed Dean as Dean turned and put Miracle in the car.
Castiel tried to close his eyes and cover his head, but through the forms of the angels around him he saw two figures standing behind everyone else. He sobbed, immediately knowing their faces.
Dean snapped and pointed at him. “That could work.”
All of them he recognized. Every single one.
Uriel was particularly satisfying to end, wiping that cruel and spiteful smile off his face.
Cas still didn't wake, but he would, in time.
She looked down. “… I’m sorry.”
“And I don’t think Jack should either.”
Sam sat stunned, the sudden absence of Castiel obvious and apparent. Sam’s eyes drifted to Dean’s shoulder, gaze lingering on the new bloody handprint on his coat.
Jack slumped, disappointment written all over his face.
Oh Cas couldn't stand it. He grabbed Dean by the lapels, pouring everything into it as he slammed every desperate feeling of pure unending love into this kiss.
"What are you doing here?" Castiel's voice could barely create the words between the sobs and the rawness of his throat, but Dean seemed to get the meaning.
They stood and faced Chuck, laughing.
Black sludge had spilled from the walls, wrapped around his throat, and pulled him into darkness, but the fact of the matter remained the same.
He felt the sudden pressure of paws jumping on his bed and a big wet tongue that searched under his pillow to meet Sam's face.
“Rotting on a lifeless planet, knowing it's this way because you wouldn’t take a knee.” Chuck spat at them. “Eternal shame, suffering, and loneliness. Woo, that's deep. That's sophisticated.”
Michael blinked. “You exploded in the Empty?” Jack nodded.
“It’s in here.” She said quietly. “All that you want. I know how God ends.”
"An item touched with cosmic power..." Amara mused. "Endowed with our combined forces, it could put the empty to sleep."
It gave him a malicious smile.
He turned around, facing the portal. He reached out a hand and with a flash of light, he was gone from the bunker.
Dean had tried to find something. He looked through books, reviewed magical items in the back, poured over Kevin’s notes, but other than an old bottle that could capture the powers of djinn, he came up with nothing even remotely close to holding the powers of god. Dean had avoided any files in the dungeon. He still couldn't… not after what happened.
Michael looked to the sky. “I think it would be good of me to return to Heaven. See what’s become of the angels, and help to rebuild.” He said.
He had done it. He had left this world, a smile on his face, fully content in the fact that he had done it.
Eileen smiled warmly at Dean, who winked at her. Sam knew that Eileen could read every word on Dean's lips, but he would still at occasions when Dean faced more towards the crowd, translate the speech with his hands for her.
“All is forgiven.” Michael came up beside Amara and put a hand on her shoulder. “I think we’ve all been deceived by God’s charismatic words at some point or another.”
Dean, wary yet willing, placed the purgatory blade in the empty's hand.
The brothers nodded, Sam standing up.
Chuck whimpered, and cowered on the ground. But Sam and Dean just walked right past him followed by Jack.
Castiel's heart shuddered as he suddenly had the horrible feeling that they weren't alone.
Dean stood, a little stunned, but hugged Jack’s shoulders just as tightly.
A black puddle formed on the floor. It oozed its way into existence, slowly molding itself to look like Cas again. Black trickled from its eyes.
They stepped up to the church, entering the large wooden doors.
Jack looked up and everyone around the table had a look of pure unsettled shock.
Preparing himself, heaving with the effort to keep Cas from sinking, he reached with the blade, holding it against Cas's throat and in one quick motion he cut a long slit.
“Ah, and now back to you guys.” He swished his hand, flinging Jack off to the side. With a yelp, he dropped the book and hit a tree a loud thunk.
Dean placed a small kiss on Castiel's forehead and Cas shivered. Not because he was uncomfortable, it was just all so... new.
They only had to wait a few minutes when Michael popped back into the room holding  what looked like a woman, bound and gagged.
His mind was hit with another painful stab and he knew what was coming a split second before it happened.
"Actually... we were thinking of naming it after you… Dean."
But they left him behind, never to be heard from again.
There was nothing.
But after about a minute of struggling, Michael relented. The book ceased its glow, unopened.
Sam and Dean nodded. “That’s actually really smart.” Dean said, a sense of pride washed over the brothers.
They softly laughed together then stopped, something of a silent tension settling over them.
Another build up of pain shot through Castiel's head, worsened by pain Uriel had already inflicted.
Cas breathed. Then he broke. He rushed into Deans arms, pulling him closer, like he couldn't quite fully believe he was there. Like he would disappear at a moment notice. But he was here and he was real.
Sam and Dean looked up, their full attention directed at Jack now.
Jack stared in confusion. “I’m sorry?”
Castiel swallowed, a dry sob escaping his raw throat. His whole chest hurt, not just from whatever the empty was serving but from the knowledge. About how it might have been easier if he hadn't been so oblivious. If he'd just taken the time to say something sooner. And now Dean was alone, and blaming himself, and Chuck would destroy them.
"Well I was worried ok? Cause well-... you did once."
“Jack?” Dean knocked on the bedroom door. No one came, but Dean could hear sniffling from inside the room.
“JUST HOLD ON!” The pitch black was up to Dean’s chest now. “I’M ALMOST THERE, HOLD ON!”
"Piss off." He flipped the angel blade into his other hand and thrust it into Zachariah's chest. The angel shrieked, turning into a formless black blob, flecked with grace.
