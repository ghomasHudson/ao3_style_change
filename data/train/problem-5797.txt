“Are you going to just stand there?” Tony asks Steve, eyes still trained on his own reflection in the mirror.
“M-my e-eyes. My head-d” Tony stutters. Internally cringing at the sound of his own voice. It sounded as if he’s been gargling sand and glass. His voice rough and damaged sounding.
“But, you did” Stane reminds him, leaning back in his leather armchair a small smirk on his lips.
“Yes quite unfortunate” Rhodey responds out of the corner of his mouth, eyes still trained forward and watching Tony’s small figure lean over his fathers, taking the hand of the alpha in his smaller omega one.
Steves breath hitches after Tony says those words, realization hitting him as well. Though he’s sure he already knows the answer but he feels like he has to ask anyway, because its too soon, they just got married.
Releasing a deep drag he begins “I’ve always liked Stane. A good Alpha, good during the war as well”
After Tony is sufficiently dressed in black trousers and a light grey blouse, he sits down at his vanity to fix his hair into something presentable.
Tony rushed down the Hall, Rhodey right on his heels half a step behind him. When he made it to his father's chambers he is greeted by two guards bowing to him.
“But what does that mean Tony?” Steve cuts him off, his voice rising a little in volume.
“How is he?” Tony asks one of the guards, Quill he tries to recall his first name, looks at Tony with a sullen expression
“I-, Yes I did,” he says a little defeated
His breathing starts to become more laborious. Quick and frantic, Almost as if he was going to have a heart attack. The hand tightens considerably. Panic. Tony thinks. Suddenly the hand leaves his arm and is replaced with two on either side of his shoulders. They are holding him down slightly.
It's Winter.
“Tony, what's happening?” Steve asks, voice low
Pain starts to shoot through Tony’s head, landing somewhere behind his eye socket. He wants to scream out. But he can’t. All he can do is breathe.
“Brilliant,” Howard smiles as he settles into the tub, gesturing silently for a maid to get him a cigar.
Steve was gorgeous when he slept, he looked years younger, his fine lines and wrinkles smoothing out in a look of blissful unawareness. Totally blacked out to the world. Steve slept on his stomach, hands tucked underneath his pillow and legs spread wide. His bareback was exposed to the world and Tony while the lower half of his body was barely covered with the grey silk sheet from the bed.
“Your Highnesses!” Yelled the maid, she sounded scared and frantic. She begins knocking again.
Steve quickly stumbled out of his chair and went to shake her hand, still not used to all the royal etiquette.
“And He’s dying Steve”
“Might I speak to you alone Mr. Rogers?” she asks in a delicate tone. Blue Eyes nods wordlessly and then follows Dr. Young as well as the other nurses out of the room.
He can see, he can move. Tony thinks hastily. Tony jerks up and headbutts the person holding him down. Crying out in pain Tony’s head flies back to the pillow he was previously lying on. He faintly hears a grunt over his cry. He looks over and sees a large blond man holding his head in his hands. Not looking directly at Tony.
“You want to take my name, right?” Steve asks out of nowhere. Tony stops scenting him and pulls back in shock.
Carol observes their ministrations by the door.
“What is it?” Asks Steve, gaging the maid's state and trying to read if she was going to faint or not.
They both sit in silence, the jovial spirit suddenly dissipated to one of anticipation and the realization of a somber reality.
“Did the council agree with this? I mean you’ll be changing the name of the whole monarchy” Natasha asks in a serious tone.
“I trust you are treating my cousin well?” She asks, focusing her attention on fixing Natasha’s dress.
The room falls deathly silent after Sam utters those words. Carol is the first to move, she straightens up and strides towards the door and whispers something to the guards. They then hear the shuffling of footsteps away from the door.
Pepper gave a knowing glance at Natasha then turned her attention to Steve.
Tony then suddenly straightened up in Rhodey’s arms and wiped the tears from his face, even though more threatened to fall down.
“That's right, your sweet omega is married to a, what was he, Captain from that brash, freeloading nation, Reanel?” Stane laughs through the smoke of his cigarette
“Come on your Majesty,” Sam says loudly, everyone in the room was on edge and Tony was very clearly on the verge of panicking.
(See the end of the chapter for
-------
Rhodey clears his throat and glances a look at Carol, the alpha looked tired, her hair was in all sorts of directions and her button down shirt was half untucked in the front. The sleeves were rolled up to her elbows and if it wasn't for the circumstances he would maybe ask if she was alright.
“Alright, and can you tell me the date Mr. Stark?” she asks next
Winter.
“They were helpful during the war, can’t say so much about after” he continues
"He was hurting his majesty, I meant no disrespect to the Prince" Dr. Banner responded carefully, the Alpha put up his arms in placating way.
“I will be in the car, you are free to get dressed and come now or you may come later after you’ve bathed properly.”
Howard then looks up and past Stane, slowly pulling out the bloodied handkerchief he keeps in his pocket and sets it on his desk
“I wasn’t going to let that filthy Reanelian dirty up our bloodline”
The room remains silent until they hear the bells ring outside, Three solid rings.
They don’t speak after that, just Howard smoking his cigar and Carol standing guard over him.
The pain is getting more intense.
“Stane, by 15 points” She responds curtly.
“Carol, may I?” Tony asks, gesturing past her into the room. She nods quickly and moves out of the way so Tony can enter. Both Tony and Rhodey enter the room. Howard is surrounded by his royal physician and some doctors from the city. Rhodey stayed to the back of the room with Carol, watching carefully as Tony slowly approached his father's immobile figure on the large bed.
Natasha laughs at that, loud and hardy.
“Thank you, mam, for having me over”
"It was-, I was-, He was-” Steve rushes out, cutting himself off with a groan, thinking about Tony during those two weeks was dangerous.
“Why are you running to his side? He’s a terrible man, He-,” Steve cuts himself off, taking a deep breath. He slowly backs up and sits on their bed, running his hands frustratingly through his blonde hair.
Tony felt the sun on his face as he shifted in bed. The silk sheets feel cool on his naked body, especially after the fever he felt the night before. Tony slowly stretched, eyes still closed, and started to whine softly. He felt the soreness of his muscles in a newly familiar ache.
“Tell me about the Honeymoon,” She said without missing a beat, causing Steve to choke on his saliva.
“Steve, thank you for caring about me,” Tony responds in a soft voice
Steve took a sip of his tea and gently set the cup back down on the saucer, trying his hardest to avoid Natasha knowing stare.
“Like you and Tony don’t gossip about us?” Natasha rebuttals
“Yeah. Yeah, I am” Howard responds, sounding unsure of it all.
This time Tony gets to scream out, and lord does he scream. He screams his lungs out, probably scaring the living shit outta Blue Eyes because his hands are suddenly off of Tony. He hears the chair Blue Eyes was sitting in slam to the floor as he stands. Nurses rush into the room moments later. Surrounding Tony as he screams his head off.
It’s one of the worst he’s ever felt in his life. And that's saying something considering what he’s lived through. Tony wants to sob. Cry out for help. For something, for anyone to help stop the pain.
Hell, maybe he was. Tony doesn’t know. He doesn’t know who this Mr. Blue Eyes is, but Tony’s sure as hell that he knows Tony. If his current hand placements are anything to go by.
“I see,” she says in a clipped tone. She then turns to Blue Eyes
With everyone gone from the room. Tony suddenly feels very alone.
“Father, FATHER!” Tony is shaking his father's shoulders with extreme force. One of the doctors from the city, Dr. Banner, grabbed Tony’s arms quickly taking them from the king's shoulders. Rhodey launches forward and grabs Dr. Banner's hands away from Tony
“He has not woken up yet, his majesty was plagued with an awful cough last night. I heard it while I stood guard at the door”
“I’m confused,” Tony responds, eyebrows raising as he stares at Steve
“Mr. Stark. Mr. Stark, please tell us what hurts so we can help you. MR. STARK!” a nurse is yelling at Tony over his screaming.
Pulling away from Rhodey’s grip he turns his gaze toward Carol, who promptly gets on one knee, head bowed and arm across her chest. The four doctors in the room quickly follow suit, getting on their knees to bow to Tony. Once Rhodey realizes what was happening he joins them, in the same position as Carol.
“Where is he, Gwen?”
-----
“An-Anthony Edward S-Stark” he fumbles through his name. Almost as if he was a toddler who hadn’t yet mastered speech. Dr. Young nods and hums affirmatively
“Okay” she nods and begins reading off of her clipboard ”Firstly, can you tell me your full name?”. Tony clears his throat.
‘Breath Rogers’ he chanted to himself before got he too worked up, thinking about his omega husband, things like how flexible he was-
‘God, these people had a lot of money’ Steve thought as he thanked Natasha.
After about a minute, it seemed Natasha’s patience had run thin.
Howard drop his hands suddenly and he slumps over in his seat,
“Amen”
“Just tell me what happened, I know you’re dying to talk about it. Alpha to Alpha” she says, wiggling her eyebrows, a ghost of a smile on her lips.
Tony nods, placing a hand on her shoulder firmly.
“Oh yes, I believe he was telling you how much he
“Imagine my shock when he brought the boy home, saying he was in love and this Alpha from Reanel” Howard laughs bitterly
“Tony put on your robe” Steve commanded before he opens the door. Tony nods, getting up from the bed and putting on his red silk robe quickly.
Deep breathes. That’s all Tony can will his body to do right now. He can’t open his eyes, can’t move his arms or legs. Hell, he isn’t even sure he wants to at this point. Breathing. It's simple and repetitive.
Gwen looks up at the sound of her name and tries to call herself down and responds
Steve stands quickly, grabbing a pair of his discarded pants from the floor and strides toward the door.
“I love you too, But he’s my father and” Tony pauses for a moment the realization hitting him like a truck.
“Well God help us all”
“Steve, I know exactly how you feel, when Pep and I got married I didn’t think I was gonna ever be able to leave our bedroom. She was all long legs and-”
I can't believe y'all actually liked this. I'll try to update a little later this week (as I'm using this as a coping mechanism during finals) Please comment and kudos!! Thank you <3
Tony sits up on the bed, climbing over to wrap his arms around Steves sitting figure. Steve turned his head slightly to try to look at Tony who was nuzzling his head into Steves' neck. Steve began to growl, low and pleased at his Omega scenting him.
“And what, dear?” came Pepper’s melodic voice cutting Natasha off as she walked into the room.
When Tony finally opens his eyes he pears around his and Steves room. They had just gotten back from their honeymoon the week prior and were promptly moved into one of the large houses owned by his family. Steve was adamant after they got married that they lived off of the castle grounds and in their own home.
“Pretty special, huh?” Natasha asks, now full on smiling at Steve.
Tony reached a hand out a softly and traced his fingers down Steve’s back. After a few minutes of his ministrations, Steve groans softly and opens his eyes.
Trying to search is mind for a name, or maybe a memory of this man that wasn’t from a few moments ago. After about a minute Tony shakes his head ‘No’. He watches Blue Eye’s face fall. His eyes filled with the same pain as earlier. But this time it seemed almost worse because this time Tony is sure he caused it.
The response caused Steve to turn pale while it caused a bark of laughter to erupt from Natasha.
“What about my father?”
“But I don’t seem to see his Alpha husband, was he not as stricken as our Prince?” Carol hums in an observational tone. Rhodey turns to look at Carol in shock, his mouth dropping open slightly. Before Rhodey could muster a response Tony begins to scream.
“He is Prince Anthony Stark, whether you’d like him to be or not”
“How’s that boy of yours?” Prime Minister, Obadiah Stane asks as he and Howard settle into their seats in Howard's office.
Then one of the nurses hits the button for his morphine drip. Within seconds a cool rush of relief comes. Tony sighs. The whole room seemed to relax with him.
“Hello Steve, a pleasure to have you here,” She said holding out her hand for Steve to take.
“If Howard dies, I become King” Tony responds in a firm tone that betrayed none of the anxiety he was feeling in that moment.
“Stop this modesty bullshit, tell me how it went down” Natasha laughs leaning forward, placing her elbows on the table and leaning her head on her hands.
When Tony opens his eyes and peers at Blue Eyes again. He looks worried to all hell. That wrinkle is deeper and more pronounced as he watches Tony from the corner of the hospital room. It seemed as though he was giving the nurses room to work around Tony. One of the nurses offers Tony water and he nods his head weakly in acceptance. The tepid water feels heavenly on his dry throat. He greedily drinks as much water as he can before the nurse gently takes the cup away from his lips. Tony lays back and starts taking deep breaths again. A woman then comes in with a clipboard and introduces herself.
She nodded in acknowledgment as she took her place across from Steve at the large wood dining table.
(See the end of the chapter for
“His majesty is in his chambers”
“Just after 11 sir, then he’ll be here after lunch”
Steve sniggered at Natasha’s alarmed face, the only person who could ever sneak up on Natasha was her wife.
Tony doesn’t look back at Steve, just nods and responds in a forced, clipped tone
“Hm?” Tony responded without stopping his scenting. He couldn’t explain why but scenting the alpha was comforting to the young Omega, made him feel safe.
“Yes, yes, What time will that be?”
“Terrible seeing you under these circumstances,” Carol says under her breath at Rhodey
Tony shakes his head ‘no’ because he honestly couldn’t tell her. She writes something on her clipboard. She then looks up at Tony and schools a very serious look on her face.
“I thought I lost you. I-” Blue Eyes clears his throat. “We can’t lose you Tony.” he finishes.
“Howard-”
I also edited this chapter cause I was not happy with where it was before, I am more happy with this one but that means I will be editing the next couple chapters as well.
“Mr. Stark. Can you tell me who this man is?” She asks, turning her body and pointing at Blue Eyes who was still standing in the back of the room. Hearing this question he perks up and is now staring at Tony more intently than before. If that was even possible
“Yes, sir. He’ll be over later today to officially greet you, after he is sworn in of course,” Carol remarks.
Dr. Young nods and sets her clipboard down.
Once Tony has covered Steve opens the door, suddenly stopping the knocking. He is faced with a panicked maid who was shaking badly.
The smirk then disappears from Stane’s face
Steve just stands unmoving in the middle of the room, eyes watching Tony running around getting ready.
Still patting Tony’s head, his other hand reaches for Tony’s hand which was closest to him. Holding it in his grasp, Blue Eyes starts rubbing his thumb in soothing circles on top of it. Tony assess the man in front of him.
“He’s fallen ill, his Majesty won’t wake up”
Once he has it in his mouth and it's lit, he dismisses all the maids, leaving only him and Carol in the bathroom.
Tony stands silently, taking in the words he had just heard. The only sounds in the hallway are the sounds of the maids crying and Steve’s deep breathing. Tony then nods his head affirmatively and straightens his stance, trying to channel his best commanding royal voice.
Okay, he thinks. I can do simple.
“It's the King” She cries loudly. At hearing this, Tony strides forward and steps around Steve to stand face to face with the maid.
“So you’re leaving it all to him?” he asks in a deep gravelly voice, thickened from years of smoking and yelling.
“Always Tony, I love you” the way that Steve so easily says he loves Tony makes his heart pound. Tony finds himself smiling even with the situation at hand.
Her powerful red hair was tied back in an intricate bun, decorated with large and small braids alike. She was dressed in a lilac gown, the light color making her hair look even brighter. Natasha leaned back, in a very ‘unroyal’ like way, and gazed at Steve with a small, knowing smirk on her face.
It was 9 o’clock in the morning and he was being fretted on by many handmaid's as they try to get him ready for the day.
“His Highness seems stricken with the news of his Majesty, he seems to have rushed over” Carol observes lightly in a conversational tone, as if they were discussing the weather and not the relationship between Tony and Howard.
The King was Dead. Those rings told the kingdom that their monarch had died.
“No we don’t,” she says, a soft blush making itself present on her freckled cheeks. Steve sensing that the atmosphere had changed to a less hostile one, retakes his seat across from the couple.
how the Prince behaved in bed” Pepper responded finally looking up from her wife’s dress, apparently deciding it was a lost cause, and looking up unimpressed at Steve.
“I’ll Try” before pulling open the large wooden door and striding out unto the hallway and shutting it behind him, leaving Steve alone in the large room.
Blue Eyes suddenly softens and a small sad smile presents itself on his lips. His eyes flash with a multitude of emotions so quick Tony couldn’t decipher them properly.
-----
Stane is the first to break the silence
But It's comforting in a way. Grounding. Letting Tony know he is apart of the outside world, even if he can’t directly interact with it.
“Send a message that I will be there within the hour, and call Colonel Rhodes and tell him to have a car ready in fifteen minutes.”
“It was amazing Nat.” he says, recalling the blissful two weeks he and Tony had spent in the countryside together.
“Morning” Tony says softly, a smile finding itself on his lips. Steve groans loudly as he moves to sit up on the bed. Stretching his long muscular arms over his head, giving Tony a perfect view of his flexing back.
Pepper clears her throat and looks Steve in the eyes with so much ferocity that I’d make him back down, if he wasn’t so stubborn.
“Where did this come from?” Tony asks in an incredulous voice, concern, and confusion flashing across his face.
“I am sorry, It seems as though the King has passed away”
Steve is an Alpha from a neighboring nation called "Reanel" and his people are called "Reanalians". It will be mentioned in passing in the chapter.
Blue Eyes leans closer and begins raking his eyes all over Tony’s face. Searching. Tony doesn’t know what for, and he really doesn’t want to ask.
When Steve doesn’t move to get dressed immediately Tony takes his choice as the latter option and finishes getting ready himself. Once finished he heads to the bedroom door, hand stopping on the nob when Steve calls out
“Steve, you heard the maid. My father is sick-”
A loud knock and the maid Gwen's high pitched voice breaks the tension in the room.
“Uh-” Tony begins.
“Oh my god, Nat you can’t just ask me like that” Steve reprimands, trying to fight the blush that was creeping up his neck.
I am so sorry this took so long!!! However, I am done with school now so I will be updating more often :D please kudos and comment It really keeps me going
“I’m going to die.” He finishes more surely.
Pepper hums in agreeance, letting go of Steve's hand and sauntering over to sit beside her wife.
Steve finally gives in dramatically with a loud sigh. He pretends to wistfully look off, looking towards the great window in Natasha’s dining room.
In the bakery, there was nothing left but sesame seed bagels. No one else seems to like that but you. I forced myself to swallow it down. Don’t know how you did it, Steve. Maybe I’ll always wonder.
“Oh,” was all Tony said.
Steve picked Morgan up and walked to where Peter was leaning over the counter.
“It wouldn't bother me. I'm an asshole. I wouldn't give a fuck. I'd walk away. I don't give a shit, you hear that? I live my life every goddamn day without him. He's buried. Six feet under. So what do I give a shit about you, the person I’ve been fucking for three months? Nothing.” Aisha shook her head.
Natasha shakes her head. “No, there’s still
Tony had so many things he wanted to tell Steve.
Always,
Tony, Tony, Tony.
“Steve. I’m— I’m happy. It’s been good. I’ve had a good life with you, but I’m tired.”
“I know, Nat. I know. God, believe me when I say that I’m here for them. Because I am— I won’t leave them. I’m here. I’ll be a goddamn father. A better one. I promise. I’m just—” He turned over, finally opening his eyes to catch a photograph of their little family. Tony and Steve were sitting under a tree in Central Park with Morgan between them, and Peter and Harley on their sides. Tony had his classic peace sign up and the boys were grinning. Morgan was still a toddler, cooing and sucking on her pacifier.
paper on Wednesday morning, replacing the slotted headline on a Congressional scandal. The world cared more about Tony Stark’s life and eventual downfall than they did about the allegations of money laundering in Congress.
“Stop. Don’t talk about him. You don’t have the right.”
Steve,
She snorts. “No shit.”
He wiped his tears with the heel of his hand, irritated that he was here at all. He didn’t want to draw attention to himself, yet here he was, uttering these words and wondering where they were all coming from. He thought he was fine, doing well, given everything—he worked, he cared for his children, listened to them attentively, and ate healthy.
Steve walked over to the wall on the east side of the room. It was a mix of Steve’s paintings, portraits of the kids, photos of him and Tony. In the middle was their marriage certificate and a copy of the frontpage newspaper from the 2012 Chitauri battle.
Bill Foster’s body flashed over his eyes. He waved it away, tired of looking at Bill’s dead body, betrayal evident on his face.
“You know, these last couple of years, it seems like I’ve been everywhere and nowhere at once.” He crosses his arms and takes in the lines on her face. She’s thinner now, but he has no doubt she could easily punch his throat and kick him until he’s down on the floor. Steve sighs. “Some people move on. Three years ago, I didn’t think we’d lose, but now, I’ve had the time to turn over the events, again and again. We weren’t prepared. We were fragmented. We weren’t a team.”
He shakes himself and works on the task of making Tony come. Steve shifts down, removing the cock ring—gentle and slow—watching the swell and bob of his cock, rock hard. For him. For
“Then, I’ll be happy to take it off your hands.” Steve opens the driver’s door and examines the interior. It smelled like stale cigarettes, but it was clean, nearly spotless minus the fading stickers on the dashboard.
There’s no floral arch or any massive wedding decor, but the docks are lined with hummingbird feeders, and Steve almost cries again. It’s just him and Tony, at home with their family. Their friends all sit on the wooden benches Steve crafted over the summer with matching grins on their faces.
“Right,” Steve says, throat suddenly parched, recalling how he took a bus into the nearest town, boarded the Amtrak, and left the country just days before Thor and the rest of the Asgardian refugees were sent off to the new territory Tony secured for them.
Tony fights a sigh, when Steve circles his rim and sucks his cock. Tony’s up on his elbows watching his cock get swallowed by perfect lips and blue eyes. Always blue.
The days since HYDRA’s defeat have blurred together. But Steve always kept track of Tuesday.
Morgan received her presents from the Bartons and the Langs. Then from Steve, a set of professional paints and a large canvas. She thanked him with a grin and a promise to paint on the terrace tomorrow.
“You pick where to go,” Tony used to say when Steve asked where they should have dinner.
Steve looks up and shrugs, trying to steer the conversation into something easier. He’s not good at talking, much less comforting. “Riri and Kate? You both are training them?”
Steve stands outside the Compound with a straight back, face free of bitterness. At least, he’s trying to school his expression into aloofness. He’d rather be expressionless than reflect the turmoil of departure again.
But Tony knows they have just the night.
Bruce and Nat both arrive and sit beside Riri and Kate respectively. There’s no doubt that this is their regular placement. Steve takes the remaining set on the other end of the table.
The silver badge shines on Steve’s chest. It’s new.
Steve pressed him deeper into the mattress, and glided between his legs. Breathing hard, he ran a hand on Steve's chests, tracing the valleys of his collarbones before lifting up to kissing his cheek. Steve choked, a quiet sound in the dead of the night, and offered him a shaky smile.
Sometimes, he pictured Tony’s mocking smirk before he brought a cigar to his lips. He wondered how Tony coped with the smell of ash and tar. Every time Steve went for business at the Stark Tower with Natasha and Maria in tow, Tony’s office smelled of whiskey and his heavy cologne. There was the underlying scent of cigars, too, but they weren’t like the ones Dum Dum used to smoke. The stench of the cigar was so strong, and again, he mused if Tony liked it.
“I’ll presume a dear friend of mine provided you those orders.” Tony clenched his jaw, wondering what Carol threatened the hotel staff with. “Bring me the bottles and you’ll get a two-thousand dollar tip.”
He had only been awake for 14 months, but he was ready to fall back into the ocean and get this life over with.
“Tony.”
“I’ve stopped asking why. I know how it happened. Biologically, I can explain it to myself. To Harley. To Morgan. But dad’s gone. I might never fully understand that. Ever.”
“Because?”
obvious. There’s a sad look on her face that he doesn’t recognize.
Steve repeated to himself.
When they reach the hall, Tony says, “All I was trying to say is that I think Peter would have liked you. In another life. If you met him.”
And he would have to leave the kids then.
“You should have finished it,” Tony mumbled. Everything hurt. There were endless images slotting into their rightful places. But it wasn’t just snapshots; the memories were calibrated with context and emotions, reminding Tony exactly what he felt.
Tony hums, rising up on one arm to finger her. Steve shouldn’t look. He shouldn’t. But what if that were him instead? Tony eating his ass, fingering him open, telling Steve that he’s lovely and how he’s always wanted Steve like this, flushed and panting, just for Tony.
Steve feels seen. He didn’t think it would be like this. Steve really imagined their first meeting to be much more romantic, not trying to stop some guy from drugging Tony.
The world he left behind
Melancholia was different from mourning. In grieving, there was a process of denial, then somehow, acceptance. But Steve wouldn’t ever accept a life without Tony in it. Melancholia was mourning without an end.
The words are spiky and true. It’s like how Tony chases at awful things because he doesn’t know what else to do.
“Tony? Steve?” Natasha called out into the empty hall, looking for the two lovers. She adjusted her blue dress, the tight fabric constricting her. “Where the hell are you two? Everyone is waiting!” she called out, louder this time. “We’re coming, we’re coming.” Tony muttered, a fussy Steve following behind him. “Steve, stop touching my damn hair.” he growled, causing the blond to smile. “You want to look good don’t you?” He tried to fix a strand that hung in the man’s beautiful face, but Tony swatted him away.
Tony laughed out of his own embarrassment, rubbing his eyes. "You didn't try to stop me did you Cap?" Steve looked out across the room, and smiled. "Hey, I figured it'd teach you a lesson. You should know never to get into a drinking competition with a super soldier." The brunette stretched, careful not to spill any more of his coffee. "I need to get working on my projects. Pepper needs them by the end of this week." He got up, but the sudden movement mixed with a hangover caused him to fall back down.
Steve yelled at himself as they sat down, and browsed over their menus.
“Ah, I’m off to dance, anyone want to join?” Tony asked, wiggling his eyebrows in Steve’s direction. “You go ahead. I need a bit of a break.” Steve said, waving his hand. Clint grabbed Natasha’s hand, and asked her for a dance. She nodded, placing her shot down, and the three headed for the dance floor.
"I've been practicing. Anyone asks, we were just putting on a show." Steve didn't wait for Tony's reply; he simply grabbed the shorter man’s hand, and pulled him onto the dance floor. "You know this is a tango right?" Tony muttered as he and the man began to circle each other. "Yep." The violins began, and Steve placed a hand on Tony's shoulder, turning him so they now faced each other. Tony was surprised by the soldier's sudden grace, but he wasn't one to be out shone.
"God, so either you tell the world yourself, and lose Steve and Pepper... Or you hide from the world, dealing with the pain of seeing Steve with a woman, and suffer in silence until Christine decides she's done with you?" Bruce sighed, and looked up at his friend. "I'm so sorry Tony...." Tony laughed sadly. "I don't know what to do Bruce, I mean; she told me she'd call me when she knew what she wanted from me... But it's been a few months since then... What if she just wanted Steve? What if that's how she plans to get back at me?" "I think it'd be the easiest thing she could do." Bruce said quietly.
"Like that?" Steve asked, his voice strong, but his body growing weaker with lust by the second. Tony didn't respond with words, he simply arched his back, pressing himself into the sheets as Steve pressed his fingers deeper inside of him. When the blond finally had his fill, he grabbed a condom, struggling with the packaging, his fingers were shaking so bad.
Hi guys! So, I'm still new to this thing and I have no idea what this is gonna do to the chapter but whatever. I hope you're all enjoying the story so far, again no idea how many of you are reading this but I already got 4 kudos... yay me. Alright, anyways, I already have the whole story completed on another site, but because I'm a jerkbutt I'm going to take my sweet time uploading on here. But really, I will try to update. Anyways, that's enough from me, I hope you all stick around!
Steve rolled his eyes and laughed lightly, before removing his arms from around the other man's waist. Tony shifted away, but didn't get up. He looked back at the blond, whose eyes watched the brunet's every move with such, amazement.
And with that, the video stopped, and Steve was left alone, a sobbing mess
"No reason to be so defensive, Miss Rogers. If that is your real name!"
“Natasha? Where the hell have you been?” Clint asked as he made his way out the door. Natasha turned around, the smile still on her face. “Out here, I have to do something real quick. Would you mind helping me out?” she asked, gripping his hand tightly. Clint nodded, and the two headed back indoors.
About a month had passed since Steve's death. Tony had nightmares almost every night, and they would always end the same. With Steve screaming Tony's name as he was blasted apart. Tony began to hallucinate. He thought he saw Steve's face everywhere he went. In a store window, sitting on a bench, driving a car, or walking in the streets. But it never was. Tony refused to get help, being as stubborn as he was before Steve's death. He turned to drinking and sleeping pills, anything to make the pain go away. Even if it killed him. He just wanted to forget.
"Why aren't you out there mingling?" Steve asked, knowing it was a stupid question. Everyone knew how Bruce was, how he never really liked talking to anyone. The man shrugged. "No one to really talk to but you guys, and you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves." Steve gave him a sympathetic look, but quickly corrected it. "Don't be that way Bruce, we all really like you." he told him, patting him softly on the back. Bruce grinned, and sipped at his drink. For some reason, Bruce always had the feeling that Cap hated him, he just kept it hidden.
"It's a date." Steve said nonchalantly, not really paying attention to his word choice. The three men laughed, but an uncomfortable feeling passed over the table, and Tony and Bruce went to talking about their project while Steve finished eating, and went back to his room to read.
"You too Pepper." He hung up without saying goodbye, and ran out to his car; he needed to get away for a little bit. He didn't want to think about how Steve wouldn't be sleeping beside him tonight, or any night. Tony got into his car, pulling out into traffic without looking and almost hitting a cab driver. He drove to the tower, deciding some flight practice wouldn't be such a bad idea.
Steve chuckled a bit, remembering Tony's past comments on his shirts. The blond shook his head slowly, those days were over now, he wasn't going to get those back, even after Christine was done with him and finally got rid of the pictures forever. He and Tony saw what they would be like together, and sometimes, enough times, it wasn't pretty.
He sighed. "Fine. I'll do it." he muttered, closing his eyes. "Great. I'll see you later then." She smiled, and walked out alone. Steve's phone buzzed, and he pulled it out to see who it was.
Tony stayed locked away in his lab for most of the day, until JARVIS notified him that dinner was ready. His stomach growled, and he decided to grab something and just bring it back downstairs. He stopped in the doorway of the kitchen, locking eyes with Steve. The blond kept a cool expression. "Mr. Stark," he snarled, before turning away and finishing setting up his plate. "Captain." Tony said, matching the man's tone, and retrieving a plate for his own food. Steve quickly finished putting his food on his plate before going back into his room. He couldn't be around Tony right then, it hurt him far too much.
And, this is it. The final chapter of the Iron Captain. It was fun while it lasted.
"You know what I'm talking about Steve. You guys don't realize how easy you are to read."
Bruce walked in, tablet in hand. He was scrolling through some type of blue print, his face twisted in deep concentration. "Hey Tony, so I was thinking about that project that you wanted to start and I-" He stopped himself when he noticed Steve was in the room, and smiled. "Hey Steve, am I- uh-am I interrupting something?" Bruce asked, moving his hands in an awkward gesture.
"No, you're just another hallucination. Now leave me alone." Tony snapped, glaring at Steve's chest. He couldn't look him in the eyes. He just couldn't. It would cause him too much pain. "Tony, how can I prove it to you? I'm not a hallucination, I swear." Steve asked, begging really.
Tony lifted his head to see Natasha giving him a smug look. "Romanoff! How long have you been here?" Tony squeaked, not expecting a visitor. "Oh, not long." she smiled coolly, sipping at a cup of coffee. The brunette stood there, still in his boxers, dumbstruck. "So, you and Steve huh?" Natasha placed her coffee down, and stood. Tony rubbed the back of his neck, and finally met her eyes. "Yeah, me and Steve."
"We have more than that Steve!" The brunette defended, blinking back his tears. "We- we've been through all this shit together! I was there when you cried, I held you through your nightmares, you've seen my ugly side, you know what I'm like but you still love-"
Tony moved in front of the emblem, blocking the man's view, the arc reactor glowing. Bruce backed up, a shocked look on his face. "What's wrong Stark? Something you don't want me to see?" Bruce snickered, and Tony rolled his eyes. "Come on Bruce, I got our project over here." He pushed the other man slightly, and the two headed over to a small compact item.
"Oh, that? You're right Steve, we did have a deal, but I figured if you can't keep up with your end, why should I?" Christine said, shrugging a bit. "What the hell are you talking about?" he growled. "You and I both know you and Tony reconciled last night." she smirked. "Have you been spying on me?" The soldier asked, a bit creeped out. "Me specifically no. But I have my spies sweetheart. And even they aren't aware. You remember Ashley don't you?" The woman cackled. "You hurt her pretty bad there Steve, she needed a shoulder to cry on. And she told me all about how she saw you last night at the bar, with a Mr. Tony Stark."
The man sniffed himself, and immediately was overtaken with the smell of strong alcohol.
Steve kept a cool expression. "I don't think that subject is really one for such an open area, do you?" The soldier saw right through her little trick. Christine's lips set into a pout as she leaned back in her chair. "Well then, why don't we talk about what we're both doing here." she said, trying to regain control of the situation. "We're here because you called me and told me you would like to speak to me over a cup of coffee. When I politely declined, you told me that if I didn't you would tell the whole country about the kiss you witnessed between Tony and myself." He leaned over the table glaring at her. "Which, may I just point out, you have no proof of."
"Damn, look at those two go." Clint said, turning away from the bar to watch the spectacle on the dance floor. "You would never guess that they hated each other by the way they look right now." Natasha turned and held her breath for a moment. She watched as the two lovers danced passionately, capturing everyone's attention.
Load bullet number one.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest. "Make me." Steve accepted the challenge, annoyed and wanting to get some long awaited sleep. He pinned the brunette up against the wall with his body, and covered Tony's mouth with his hand to keep the man from yelling. He bit down, but Steve refused to remove his hand until he found the key. He did, and but his hand stayed on the other man's mouth, just in case he decided to be a smart-ass and scream rape.
"I had a great time with you Steve." Ashley said, standing in her doorway. Steve smiled politely, hoping she didn't invite him in. Slowly, snow began to fall, causing Steve to look up. The girl giggled as she watched the snowflakes melt on his eyelashes, making little paths down his face. She had no idea he was crying.
He walked around the granite island and shoved purposefully into Tony, causing steaming black coffee to splash and burn his hand. “God dammit!” The brunette yelped, shaking his hand in pain as the coffee continued to burn him. “Funny thing for an atheist to say don’t you think?” Steve smiled, scooping Folgers into the coffee maker. Tony stared daggers into Steve’s back. “Dumb Christian.” he mumbled under his breath.
The Captain America symbol had been drawn on it, and a picture of a young Steve sat in the middle where the star would usually be. "Where'd you guys find this?" he questioned, a tear trying to escape his eye. It really meant a lot to him that they had done this. "Natasha found it of course." Bruce laughed, and received a playful punch from the red head. Bruce tried to look amused, but when everyone had focused on Thor, he gently rubbed his arm.
“No, no Steve. I need you, but I need to tell her.”
He pushed the brunette down onto the bed, and began to pull off his own pants while the other did the same. Tony maneuvered himself onto his knees, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck and pulling him down on top of him, their cocks brushing against one another through Steve's boxers.
Steve watched as the two walked out the door, and Tony entered the room, looking as if nothing had happened. "Enjoy the show Captain?" he asked nonchalantly, and the blond glared at him. "Next time, how bout a little warning that you like to do your puking naked." retorted Steve. Tony laughed, taking a cup of coffee off the counter.
"Excuse me?" She scoffed. "What the hell do you mean neither?"
"Well, I should be going." Steve was about to turn away, but Ashley caught his arm. Before the man could protest, he felt her lips meet his, and she wrapped her arms around his neck. He let her do the work, as he had only kissed two women in his whole life, and only one had given him a real rush. But he didn't want to feel that again, not with Ashley.
Steve smiled at him. "Hey Tony, sorry about that, I wasn't watching where I was going, damn shirt's got me all confused." He chuckled low, and Tony looked at his chest to see undone buttons, a few in the wrong holes. The man rolled his eyes, and swatted Steve's hands away. "Here, let me help you out a bit." He muttered, and began to undo the blond's button down, exposing his broad chest, the one that Tony had missed laying his head against, listening to Steve's heartbeat.
"Don't you dare try to bring her into this." Tony growled between clenched teeth. "Why shouldn't I? You're her boyfriend after all; she has the right to know the truth." Christine taunted. "What the hell do you want Christine?" the brunette asked, leaning up against the wall, defeated. "Ooh, and they say you can't take the fight out of the kid." she laughed, and Tony clenched his fist. "Let me think about it, if I can get something good out of this, I want it to be special." she giggled again before hanging up.
"Get some sleep Stark." Steve laughed, pulling the other man close.
Steve laughed, and the two headed their separate ways to get ready. The soldier looked back at him, watching Tony's limp grow with each step he took towards the door.
"Why?"
“Praise the universe!” Tony called out, and everyone laughed. “Alright, now who wants some ham, and who wants turkey?”
"Why the hell are we meeting Fury here?" Tony asked as he walked out to the open area. The place resembled a park, with couples with their children, some musicians, and the usual homeless person begging for change. The brunette scowled, and Steve nudged him with his elbow. "Wipe that look off your face. Show a little respect would you?" The blond growled.
He sighed, and picked her up. She nestled her head against his chest, the soft silk robe rubbing against her smooth skin. Tony placed her gently in their bed, and kissed her forehead. A knock at the door grabbed his attention, and he had to slow his pace he was so excited.
Both men were silent for most of the ride, but it wasn't an uncomfortable one. They didn't mind, it was something they had gotten used to. They finally arrived at the bar, and already the place was packed with other people. "Only nine, and people are already getting drunk." Steve chuckled. "My kind of people." Tony laughed, and they headed inside. It was an older crowd, Tony recognized a few people, giving them a small wave. Steve spotted Ashley, but they simply avoided looking at each other for the duration of the evening.
Was it, happiness?
"Damn, look at those two go." Clint said, turning away from the bar to watch the spectacle on the dance floor. "You would never guess that they hated each other by the way they look right now." Natasha turned and held her breath for a moment. She watched as the two lovers danced passionately, capturing everyone's attention.
The audience cheered, and Steve and Tony looked up, panting for breath. They looked at each other, and began to laugh. Steve pulled Tony up, and the two took a bow. Clint and Natasha waved them over, and they made their way towards them. “Where did you learn to dance like that Cap?” Tony panted, still a bit exasperated from the display.
Their kisses became even more passionate, their breathing even harder. "Tony..." Steve gasped, and Tony pushed himself off the door, causing their bodies to fly forward. Steve caught his balance, and they just stood there for a moment, panting, but not moving back from the kiss
"What? You've never seen two men dance before?" Tony snapped, and the group put their heads down, muttering under their breaths. He turned his attention back to Steve, who was blushing furiously, "Relax Steve. Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now." The blond let out a breath, and the two began to dance, keeping the beat of the song.
After his little episode, Tony went to the medicine cabinet to get some aspirin, and heard a knock at the door. He grabbed the whole bottle and stepped out of the bathroom, attempting to open the bottle with one hand. By the time he reached the door, the bottle remained closed, and some coffee had spilled onto the carpet. He put the item in his mouth and opened the door.
Steve placed Tony back on solid ground, and the genius went through the machine, showing the different settings, the different training modes, and the built in coffee machine. "Also, I hope you don't mind but I bought you your own gym- this machine is pretty big, and I didn't want it getting damaged by some rookie." Tony explained, dusting off a smudge on the paint.
"What's so funny?" Steve's face set into a serious look, causing Tony to laugh even harder. "Nothing. Don't worry about it." He waved his hand dismissively, trying to stifle his laughter. "No, tell me." the blond said, not understanding why Tony was laughing. Then again, it
"Tony!" he cried, watching the sky as he fell backwards towards the snow covered ground. Tony ran towards the edge, and slipped, just as he had in his nightmare. "No!" he cried, he watched Steve come closer to the ground, and boosted himself off the roof, diving after his falling lover. They were coming precariously close, and Tony stepped up the boosters. Steve reached for the man's hand, and Tony reached for his. Just a few feet away from the ground....
Tony was caught off guard, and landed to the floor with a loud
Tony watched as he left, sighing softly. "So he doesn't love you?" Bruce asked, and the brunette looked at his smirking friend. "No, he doesn't. He may have once, but not anymore." He muttered, looking at his food, with a sudden loss in appetite. "The guy froze up when I said the word 'love'," The scientist argued, and Tony looked up at him, glaring. "Probably because he knows I'm still head over heels in love with him, and he doesn't want to be reminded of it. It's not hard to fall out of love with someone Bruce; I've done it plenty of times before." he growled, standing, and beginning to move towards the door.
"I've been practicing. Anyone asks, we were just putting on a show." Steve didn't wait for Tony's reply; he simply grabbed the shorter man’s hand, and pulled him onto the dance floor. "You know this is a tango right?" Tony muttered as he and the man began to circle each other. "Yep." The violins began, and Steve placed a hand on Tony's shoulder, turning him so they now faced each other. Tony was surprised by the soldier's sudden grace, but he wasn't one to be out shone.
"See? We can still be lovers." Tony whispered, keeping a bored look on his face. “I know Tony, but I-" Steve began, but stopped when he heard the soft music beginning to play. A slow smile spread across his face. "You want to dance Mr. Stark?" he asked, releasing Tony's hand and beginning to stand. The brunette looked up in shock. "Do you think you can?" he asked, looking the soldier up and down.
"Yes sir." Both said, still glaring at one another. "Come on Christine." Steve growled, not taking his eyes off Tony's. The brunette watched them leave, and glared after them. "Get moving Stark." Fury ordered, and Tony nodded. "On it." he growled, and went back to take off his suit. It was only until he was sure no one would see him did he let himself cry.
Yeah, this was definitely good.
"There you two are! What were you doing? It's a freaking blizzard out there!" Natasha exclaimed as the two men walked back in the tower, covered head to toe in snow, noses running. "Sorry Tash, went for a bit of a walk." Steve explained, and Natasha looked him over, sighing. "Just come inside before you catch pneumonia. Lunch is ready, since you already missed breakfast." she muttered, walking away, and back towards the kitchen.
"Stark, hurry up would you?" Steve called out to him, and Tony snapped out of his little fantasy. "Don't tell me what to do Cap!" He yelled back, and his arrogant attitude replaced his recent, dreamy one.
Dinner went by smoothly, and the time passed by so quickly that by the time they finished eating, it was already nine o' clock. They had begun at six. An annoying buzz snapped the two out of their fantastic mood, and they looked to the counter to see Tony's phone buzzing across the counter. Tony sighed, and got up from his comfortable seat.
Tony looked away, unsure of what to tell the super soldier. "What are you so afraid to say?" Steve's voice was soothing, but a sudden anger swept over the man, his defenses quickly building up once more. Tony's head snapped up, and a scowl found its way up onto his handsome face. "What am
Steve smiled back, rolling fully onto his side. Tony rolled over as well, staring at the blond with a goofy smile on his face. "Cap?"
He heard Steve sniffle, and the blue-eyed man turned around to meet his gaze. "Have you been crying?" Tony groaned, not in the mood to deal with an upset super soldier. "What if I have been? Why are you even up here Stark?" The blond snapped; turning his head back towards the city.
Tony didn’t respond. He simply looked up, and stared into Steve’s blue eyes. And in them, Steve found the answer.
"I used to make weapons, but now, I'm sort of retired. I have enough money saved up in my bank to keep me living fancy for two lifetimes." Toni leaned on the table, tapping a manicured finger on the table as she dragged it over the table cloth. "What about you?"
"What? What makes you think I need-"
"Natasha wasn't feeling well, so I offered to drive her back to the hotel. I figured I should stop by, make sure you were okay." Steve said as he stepped into the lab, his usually cold stare replaced by one of worry and a bit of guilt. "I'm fine. Get out." Tony said angrily, not taking his eyes off the other man. "I think I should apologize first. What I said earlier, it was way out of line," Steve said gently, walking slowly towards the brunette, whose expression only hardened. "Yeah. It was. Now get out. I don't need your stupid apology." The man said through clenched teeth, anger rising with each step that the soldier took.
Steve’s lips twitched; and he looked down at his hands. “I hate this.” He muttered to himself. “What?” Tony asked, focusing his attention on Steve. “This. I finally find the love of my life, and I don’t even get to hold his damn hand.” Tony pursed his lips, and placed his hand beneath the table, placing it on Steve's knee. The blond smiled, and placed one of his hands beneath the table as well.
He ran a hand over his face, trying to hold back tears. His phone rang, and he answered without seeing who it was. "Hey handsome, you think you're up for dinner tonight? I'm coming back to New York for a few days, and figured we could celebrate." Pepper offered happily. "Hey, yeah. Sounds great. I'll talk to you later Pep." Tony said, hiding the shaking in his voice.
"Sure." Steve says with no hesitation, and the brunette can't help but be caught off guard. He won't let that show, though.
"Night guys!" The assassin yelled. The two men waved to him, watching as Bruce quickly ran to catch the almost falling Clint. As soon as they were out of the bar, Tony turned to Steve, a fun thought on his mind. "What do ya say Capsicle? Feeling dangerous?" Tony smiled, his teeth shining in the dim light. Steve would normally have turned him down. He normally would've called Tony an idiot. But tonight, he was up for it.
"What's up with you today? Why did you take off like that?" Tony didn't answer; he just ran a hand over his face, trying to keep calm. "Sorry Bruce. I didn't mean to freak out like that." he sighed, and hopped into the back seat. "Can you drive? I'm not exactly at my most stable point right now."
And they just kept walking, the November winds nipping at their faces, numbing their noses. Tony spotted a Starbucks, and tapped Steve's arm. The other man nodded, wanting some coffee to help warm his numbs hands. They entered, and Ed Sheeran's
"Alright Tash, you ready?" Clint asked, stretching his arms behind his head. Natasha cast one last look back at the laughing couple, and shook her head. "As ready as I'll ever be." she smiled, and pounced.
He walked over to his large stereo, popped in a Black Sabbath CD, and turned the volume on high. Ozzy's voice vibrated the whole room, and a loud yell emanated from the room next to his.
The soldier didn't answer. He simply headed for the stairs, heading up them with ease. Tony rested his head against Steve's chest, eyes closing slowly. He napped for a bit, and before he knew what was happening, he felt himself being placed down on his bed, and a pair of warm, familiar lips on his own.
"Capscle! I see you're enjoying yourself." Tony smiles through hazy eyes at the supersoldier, and Steve can practically taste the liquor that his friend currently sweats. He could probaby get a buzz from just one lick of that man's sweet skin.
When Steve asks Morgan what her father is up to, she just grins and says, “Pops, pops, pops, dad made me promise not to tell, so please don’t ask me because I might slip and I don’t want to upset him.”
57 suits with no man to pilot them.
Steve opens his eyes, catching sight of the stupid blindfold. He can’t see Tony’s eyes. But he imagines them wide, surprised and elated, like he’s always wanted Steve to kiss him.
“Yeah?” Steve caught Tony’s mouth, biting down on his lower lip,  before inching a hand between them. He grasped Tony’s cock, squeezing at the base. “You’ll think of me today?”
There was this one afternoon when Tony had come to the Mansion with a story of a woman he met.
Blue Eyes suddenly asks “Are-are you in any pain? God, I’m sorry Tony I should’ve asked earlier.” Regret and slight panic slipping into his tone. Tony opens his mouth to speak, to tell Blue Eyes that he’s alright when suddenly pain starts to shoot through his head and right behind his eyes again.
Steve sighs “It's none of the councils damn business. Monarchy or not, he’s my omega. In my eyes he’s Tony before he’s ‘Prince Anthony Stark’” Steve says doing air quotes with his fingers.
“But he is” Pepper mutters under her breathe, probably thinking that Steve wouldn’t catch it.
“I see” Pepper responds in a curt tone, eyebrows furring slightly.
“Still a brat, but now he’s a married brat” Howard admonishes as offers Stane a cigarette.
“I don’t know if this is apropr-” He gets cut off by Natasha
Howard stands from the bed and starts shedding his pajamas as he makes his way towards the already warm bathtub awaiting him in his royal suite, Carol and the maids following closely behind.
The large four post bed was white and matched the bulky dated furniture in the room. Sighing loudly Tony turns to his side to gaze upon the sleeping figure next to him.
“G’ morning beautiful,” Steve says in his deep gravely morning voice. His reanelian accent was thick in the mornings.
Steve was left standing in the middle of the room, alone. He eyed the Christmas tree one more time, before heading towards the bathroom. He locked the door behind him, splashing some cool water on his face. “Relax Steve; you can make it through a simple dinner. Just,” He paused, thinking he heard footsteps.  “Just fake it.” He turned off the water, and dried his face with a towel.  He came out of the bathroom, and the smell of a Christmas ham wafted over to him.
. Steve ran a hand through his blond hair, and decided to change out of his sweats. He had just come back from a long needed work out, and his body was unwound. His nerves felt relaxed.
“They're outta coffee.” The man mumbled, rubbing his tired eyes. He had stayed up late, working on one of his projects for Pepper to show off in whatever country she would be in. Steve clenched his fists, trying to keep calm. “Typical Tony.” he growled. The brunette swept a hand through his dark hair and turned around slowly. “Good morning to you too sunshine.” He smirked, but the soldier wasn’t in the mood for his jokes. He had more important things on his mind that he would rather try to ignore.
"So what makes you think Tony and I hooked up?" Steve growled. "Oh please Steven, I may be blond, but I'm not an idiot. You love Tony, and you know you can't go through your life without him with you. And I know you'd do anything to keep him by your side." Christine said, crossing her arms over her chest as she leaned back on her desk. "So, what's it going to be Steve? Are you going to sleep with me, and I'll destroy the pictures, or are you going to go back to Tony, and let the whole world know your secret?" The soldier looked down, sighing. "Neither." He muttered, and the reporter was caught off guard.
Tony and Steve groaned in unison, not happy to be getting up at such an early hour after a late night. Steve pushed himself off the couch, and walked to the coffee maker. "Ugh, you want a cup Stark?" he asked as he filled the pot. "When do I not?" Tony muttered, hiding behind the half wall that separated him from the burning sun, and the handsome soldier.
"Yeah, why, was it not for you?" Steve sat up a bit, glad for the dark lighting of the room to hide the blush.
Tony stood before them, shirt un-tucked, tie loosened, and the strong smell of alcohol wafting off of him. "Excuse us, for a moment." Steve murmured to Ashley, who simply nodded as she watched the man get up. "Tony, I need to speak with you." he wore a serious look, but the brunette simply stared at him, looking bored. "What is it Capsicle? You lookin to go back to my place?" Tony's eyes flickered over to Ashley, who looked just about ready to die of embarrassment.
Steve wanted him, oh, how he had wanted him. He wanted to feel his touch; he wanted to feel their bodies colliding, free of all things that held them back. Tony tried to bring their bodies closer, wanting to feel the heat. He wanted Steve to warm his icy heart, to make a fool out of him,
Christine texted him, asking him if he wanted to get together and have lunch. He didn't answer, and left his phone at his apartment. He wasn't going to be answering to her today.
"We're welcome to bring guests, so if you wanted to..." the quiet man hinted and Tony nodded to show he understood. He would ask Steve later, after what happened that morning; he knew the blond wasn't up for questions. Steve was quiet for most of the meal, and finally Tony couldn't take it anymore. He leaned in to whisper in Steve's ear, muttering low so no one else heard. "What's wrong?" Steve simply pulled away, and gave Tony a dirty look. "I told you I didn't want to talk about it, now would you please drop it?" he hissed. Tony lips turned up in a snarl. "Well it's pretty hard to do that when you look like you just got his by a train!" Steve shoved the table back so hard drinks spilled onto the table top. He stormed out, and Clint went to get up to see what the hell was wrong, but Natasha stopped him.
"Keep up Mr. Stark."
"Fine." he said, and stuck out a hand. As he thought, Tony quickly pulled him into the pool, and he landed on top of the small brunette. They raced to the surface, laughing. "I would kill you if this water didn't feel so nice." Steve said, wiping water off his face. "But it does. You're welcome." Tony chuckled as he began to swim towards the edge of the pool. Steve pulled him back by his swim trunks. "Where do you think you're going?" Steve purred, pulling him back and against his chest. He nibbled gently on his ear, and Tony bit back a moan.
Tony sat next to him, and put his arm around the blond. The brunette looked up at the city sky, the stars being outshone by the lights below them. Steve picked his head up and tried to blink back his tears, not wanting the other to see him cry, but wanting to know what his intentions were. Tony looked over to him and smiled, seeing right through the man's serious mask. "You can't fool me Steve. I know you're upset, and I know you want to talk about it." He wiped away a tear that rolled down the blond’s cheek, causing him to flinch at the cold touch of the metal.
Tony looked at a nearby pillar, covered in mirrors, and gasped. Two blue eyes stared back at him, full of recognition. He quickly looked over to Pepper, who gave him a confused look. "Alright, which ex did you see?" She joked. Tony laughed with her, trying to avoid looking at the mirrors. "No, it was nothing. Thought I saw someone, probably just a figment of my imagination." A waiter walked over to their table, holding a tray of drinks. "Here you are. Compliments of the couple at table twenty three." The waiter set down two glasses and a note.
"Bartender! Another round please!" Tony called across the room, his words slurring. Clint, Bruce, Tony, and Steve had gathered at their regular bar, The Silver Celtics. The bar played good music, and wasn't filled with loud and rowdy teens. It was a good place for drinking games, such as tonight.
"You and Steve always get into fights, why is this one bothering you so much?" Pepper was a bit worried, Tony looked tired, broken. "It's nothing. Just said some crap I didn't mean, feeling guilty." he sighed. "Not in the mood to talk about it." Pepper nodded, understanding. "Okay. I get it." She reached a hand across the table, taking Tony's and lacing their fingers. "We can talk about something else. Anything you want."
Steve walked into his bedroom and removed his shirt, then his pants. He could have sworn he heard a giggle. He looked up, ears perked to any noise. "Calm yourself Steve, you’re getting yourself worked up for nothing." the man told himself, and he slipped on a pair of jeans and one of his plaid shirts. He walked out of the room and was immediately started by a bright flash.
Steve looked up, a confused look on his handsome face. "Sure, what's wrong babe?" he asked as he wiped his hands on his jeans, moving to where his husband sat at the table. "Sit." Tony muttered, not meeting Steve's eyes.
Steve growled against Tony's skin, causing the other man to shiver, and buck his hips into the blond's.
Tony pumped himself a few more times, hips bucking furiously and fingers moving fast as he finally released, coming finally. Only moments later, Steve did as well. The soldier stood there with his pants around his ankles and his hand on his dick, trying to wrap his hand around what had just occured. He watched as Tony kicked off the messy sheets and shut off the light. For some reason, Steve just couldn't wait for this to happen again. The blond went off to bed, falling asleep rather quickly, and dreaming of nothing.
"Coming at you!" Bruce yelled, and jumped on top of the other three. "How did I end up on the bottom?" Steve giggled, and Tony gave him a playful look. "Aren't you always?" he joked, and received a playful shove from Steve that sent them all flying off the super soldier. "Sorry guys!" he chuckled, and helped them up. "Natasha sent me out here to tell you guys dinner is ready." Bruce announced, brushing snow out of his hair. The three nodded, and began to head inside. Tony quickly pulled Steve aside, and whispered, "You know you're going to have to finish what you started later." he purred, and Steve smirked. "And you know that I'll show you who's bottom." Steve muttered back, stealing a quick kiss before the two men headed inside.
"Steve! Get in here!" Tony cried out. "What is it?" Steve called back. "Just get in here!" The hung-over man retched again, causing Steve's stomach to churn. He never did do well with puke. "Alright, I'm coming." The soldier sighed as he began walking towards the door, preparing himself for the worst. As he reached the door, he breathed in, and out.
He paused a moment, and a silence passed between the two. "Tony?" The blond practically whispered, and the smaller man looked up, a blush flooding his face. He noticed the red tint to Steve's cheeks, and the way his lips were slightly parted, like he was going to say something, or better yet, do something....
I’ve told you about my five nightmares. Everything is changing. All things change, that’s why we couldn’t play by the same rules.
It swallows. Tony follows the movement of Its throat. It’s all Steve, from the mole on the column of its neck to the sharp collarbones. It feels too much like goodbye.
“You always make it difficult.”
Pepper arrived at the brownstone the day the kids went back to school. Steve let them have two weeks off so the press wouldn’t maul them in the streets with Tony’s death still so fresh in their minds.
Across the hall, Natasha’s door remained open. Her face was impassive. Steve considered this as her worried look. She raised an eyebrow.
He’d see Tony, get lost in the environment as if it was real.
There is the faint smell of the sea.
“I think you’re onto something, Rogers.” Tony drawls the words out and offers him a smile.
, and Steve trusts him with his life.
Ru lived in the space of his breastbone, a tiny thing that spun around his ribs, making his heart stutter anytime he saw someone with a red dress. It was always hurting. Always there, reminding  him what it’s like to grieve.
“You’re still as handsome as the first day I laid eyes on you,” Steve said, squeezing Tony’s calves. He loved quiet mornings like these, when they were all lazy together. It was domestic. There would be more meals in bed, just like this. Steve wasn’t giving up. Everything was fine.
“No hard feelings?”
But they always come back.
He wiped his forehead, standing to give them all a brief one-armed hug. He went to the kitchen and fixed them drinks, movements mechanic. Get the glasses. Pour the drinks. Put them in the tray. An easy task. He could do that.
he hears Tony’s voice once again.
It’s better not to think.
“You’ll heal just fine.”
Steve pays in cash and signs the paperwork, then he’s promptly handed a set of car keys.The salesman pulls away at the last minute. Then, with a small smile, he places the keys on Steve’s open palms. “It was my father’s, you know. He liked camping. We used to put a cot in the back when we’d go across the country. That’s why the seats are missing.”
“Oh. I. I didn’t know.”
He flashes a smile at Steve, trying to center himself.
Steve was irritated. He didn’t want to sit on the rooftop, but Pepper insisted. They sat with cups of coffee between them and matching frowns on their faces.
“You got it, Cap.” Then, they were flying out again.
He understand the appeal now.
Carol flew them towards the bathroom. Tony broke away from her grip and threw himself against the floor.
“Fuck me, Tony, sweetheart, darling, please.” Steve bucked up on Tony’s fingers.
“Yeah, we’re here, Steve.” Carol twisted down to grab a bottle of beer. She clicked it with Steve’s empty one and nodded.
Steve hides his face in Tony’s shoulder, breathing him in and gripping him hard. Steve’s fingers shake. He fucks Tony deeper, harder. He wants to hurt Tony, bruise him, slap him around. Steve is sick of controlling his strength. He wants to hurt himself.
Steve didn’t want that. He could do this, dammit. Hadn’t he been doing well? He cooked for his kids every fucking morning after running ten miles. He doted on them, reminded them they were loved, and that their parents loved them. Told them stories, wished them goodnight and sweet dreams, and promised them that they’ll be alright.
“It was the right call, Cap.”
The ground is where they kick him until he can't even wrap his arms around his belly to protect his spleen.
Steve doesn’t say anything and they remain there, in the quiet of the room, with just the flashing maps in the holo-screen to distract them from the things they refuse to say.
He clicks the send button and breathes out a sigh. When he glances to the left, the child from earlier is pulling at his mother’s hair, and she allows the soft tug with a laugh.
“Thor flew in along with Valkyrie. They brought way too much mead, and Carole got into a shouting match trying to pry the barrel from Rhodey.”
No, not Steve, It.
“Fuck off.” He wanted to scream but his throat was raw from crying, and all he could do was wonder what Ru would think if she was still alive.
He licks at Tony’s ass, and a very far away part of him thinks it feels good. He’s grateful, because this is a different type of punishment. Steve isn’t fucking into him without prep, or working his hole without lube. Isn’t making his fucktoy of a hole bleed anymore.
She frowned, her lips pressing into a thin line. “It wasn’t meant to be rude, Steve.”
