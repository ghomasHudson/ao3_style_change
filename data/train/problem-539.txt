After all, people were, as a general rule, a little strange, and this wouldn’t be the weirdest thing he’d dealt with. It probably couldn’t even squeeze in a spot on the list.
So, breaking and checking the eggs, he decided on some French toast, to get both egg and toast into the lanky git in one go. He put the biscuits on the table to eat while he cooked, raising an eyebrow and crossing his arms when Sherlock didn’t immediately start on them.
Service records. Of course. Probably given to him by Mycroft, if he hadn’t unearthed them himself somehow. Gave him an idea of who his new bond mate would be, John supposed, which really was more than fair of him, all things considered.
If he was going to do this, he might as well lay it all out. For his own benefit as much as the dragon’s. It was good to say it out loud to himself, both for confirmation and as a reminder.
But even without the smell, it was not a sight that said much of anything good about dragons in general or Sherlock in particular.
One difference was how close Moriarty was compared to earlier, particularly his eyes, and for all that he tried, the blond couldn’t wrest his gaze away from them, the amber drawing him in as he went gradually but quickly limp and pliable on top of the other man, despite his very best efforts.
“Manslaughter is still murder, and the end result would’ve been the same. Even if I’d only claimed you, I would’ve killed
He would propose to John and, given the way he would do it, there was no chance that the doctor would say anything but yes.
The other hand was on his shoulder, the claws also pushing in there, making more wounds to rival the ones in the dragon’s own back as well as effectively holding the doctor down.
So, Sherlock had a point, even if the doctor wasn’t entirely sure he was thinking about that. Exclusively, anyway.
For a moment, Sherlock didn’t understand. Then it clicked and he felt simultaneously confused, concerned and just a little bit annoyed.
“If Sherlock has selected your watch rather than any of the other possessions of yours, all of which he will have had free access to whenever he wanted it, regardless of what you might have said and where it will have been put, then that is for a reason, difficult or impossible though it may be for anyone else to comprehend. Possibly it is for Sherlock, too, given how little of what he was taught he has decided to learn, let alone keep in his mind.”
The reality, however, was that there was a world of difference between the tiny portholes of an aeroplane or even the roaring fish-tank view of a helicopter to the relatively silent glide through the air, the wind ambling rather than rushing past his face and only the beating of powerful wings making the occasional boom in the airspace around them, allowing him to fully enjoy the jewellery that was the city at night, even though the dragon was keeping them away, both in distance and height, from the most brightly lit areas, for obvious reasons.
Why else would they be running around a whole board in order to get to safety? Safety which, incidentally, was right behind the starting point so if it was about efficiency, then there was no need for the entire board.
“Don’t you want to wait until you can give it to her yourself, then? I can always find something in the airport.”
A hand landed on his shoulder as Sherlock moved the last bit between them. The kiss he landed on the blond’s forehead was hardly sexually charged, as in it was mostly not. Mostly.
When he managed to get himself back and push the thought of never getting Tessa back – if she was adopted into a loving family, who was he to abruptly pull her from that just because he’d birthed her? That wasn’t what being a good parent ought to be about – Mycroft was in the process of answering. Sort of.
As he had been with other small things, really. That they stemmed from a desire to make things like they ought to be rather than purely something that Sherlock felt was right.
“My very first experience was when I was a teenager,” Sherlock said, obviously attempting to sidestep the issue. John made a mental note of it and let it slide for the moment.
Since it was late, that wasn’t a given. On the other hand, if Mycroft knew that she was awake, someone must’ve informed him, and it was hardly likely to have been any of the nurses that made the call, their authority not stretching that far. So, someone of sufficient standing would’ve looked at her, especially likely given the observation she’d been under since her admission.
Even so, John wasn’t so sure. Not because he didn’t want to – the mood might have been shot rather effectively earlier but that could be rebuilt again – but he wasn’t sure Sherlock was actually ready for it, whatever his body could manage.
The only thing he did know for certain was that he would have to be a whole lot more careful, with John and with his reactions to him, if he was to get through the practice and performance of the song without embarrassing himself completely.
In fact, it almost felt…well, not quite normal but something approaching it. A point where the abovementioned hope could flourish.
Then he realised that the main purpose wasn’t to make John uncomfortable, though that was unquestionably a bonus. It was a display intended for Sherlock,
“How can you know that?” the Omega asked, and his voice came out a little strangled. It didn’t sound helpless, though, or pitiful, which he was absurdly and irrationally grateful for.
the time.” There was….it wasn’t quite an urgency in his tone but something along those lines, as well as a note of steel a little uncharacteristic of Mycroft. It was certainly enough to make the younger Alpha shut up and, it seemed, listen to what his brother said.
When he looked back up into those familiar eyes – the threat of hypnosis was no longer one he thought he needed to worry about – they were not only ready to meet his, there was heat in them that had nothing to do with the dragon.
John might still have something on his mind. Something that this news didn’t alter one way or another.
“I do,” Mycroft interrupted, voice soft and warm. He stepped close to Sherlock, who allowed it, and said something to him, so quietly that John had no chance of hearing, even not being very far away.
Kidnapped or not, bound tight or not, criminal genius in front of him and calling the shots or not, he was not going to back down or roll over like some good little puppy.
...and yes, we're still going. I am even going somewhere with all of this, believe it or not, and I still feel like I ought to apologise to you all for this. I know character stuff can be the interesting bit but...
Even if he could accomplish that, though, there was not only Moran to think of, but there was Tessa, though in a different context than that of the thug.
John felt a strange pang of…not exactly pity – the day he pitied one of the most dangerous and influential men in Britain if not the entire world, never mind his draconian attributes, was the day he signed his own death warrant, he was sure, and even he wasn’t quite
Once again, Sherlock ruthlessly pushed the instincts down. This time, however, they fought back, arguing, if such it could be called, that he needed them. If he was going up against another Alpha in defence of his Omega, then he –
That said, Sherlock wasn’t too keen on still being interesting to the other, even though the degree of interest had thankfully lessened considerably in the intervening years.
The pupils had momentarily also turned to slits before returning to their previous roundness. That he only registered they had now he found puzzling. But that wasn’t the issue that needed dealing with right now.
Mr. Duffy looked at him for a few moments without saying anything and the brunet wasn’t inclined to assist by volunteering any information. John wasn’t here, he didn’t know why, he could still perform the piece, thus fulfilling the agreement, to the best possible degree in the circumstances.
No, of course he did; he had as much right to be there as anybody else, he wasn’t less worthy than them just because of his time in the harem. But like it or not, it set him apart, and not in the positive sense of the phrase, like his time and experience as a soldier had set him apart, like his lack of Heat and proper sent did. All of them things that proved that he didn’t belong, that he would, just like before, be on the outside looking in, with no real hope that it’d be otherwise.
Then again, Sherlock was hardly an expert on children, let alone their psychology. Perhaps it was better that she knew all.
There might be other state school students who’d take offense at that comment. John, however, just snorted a laugh.
“You thought so earlier,” Sherlock pointed out, voice gone quiet and more sincere. “When we got back here, after…you thought what I claimed was people, just like Moriarty does, albeit without eventually killing them. If you thought that, you would’ve walked out there and then. You were rather…adamant as well as angry that I only seemed to value you as a possession.”
Was that worth the wait? I have no idea. Nor whether it was a satisfactory resolution, if you can call it that. I only know that I'm glad I took those two months to do it because otherwise, it wouldn't have been done at all. Apologies if it's a let-down, though. I have tried, at least.
She turned her head to look at the Alpha woman, her adoptive mother, but then almost immediately turned back, almost as though she couldn’t bear to look at what she saw. Her little hand found John’s free one and grabbed as best she could.
When he did notice, his eyes flickered down the length of the lanky body then snapped back up again.
It wouldn’t even have been with a thought to, if the person in question was the victim, how it would help them as well. Justifying it that way, even though it couldn’t really do that, in any case, not if you put any kind of proper thought into it.
Despite the fact that he was looking at himself, in a form that he had been familiar with since birth, possibly more so than his human one for the first many ears, to be faced with it like this, without the barriers of physical limits, regardless of the magic, the sheer
“And that is why we’ll do this together! You have your genetic knowledge, as it were, and I have my medical expertise.”
Or it was just John’s mind playing with him, which didn’t honestly bode too well – and nope, not going to think about that.
Then again, it would be something that could have more than dire consequences if he’d miscalculated. He couldn’t afford to have gotten it wrong.
Only, it wasn’t enough. His mind kept circling it, like you might trace around a constant itch that you need to scratch but don’t dare to in case you break something. Like a case he couldn’t get to the root of or even to a thread of that he could start to tug at.
Besides, he’d just had him say that he wanted to keep talking, that ought to count for something, right?
Given that he, to the best of John’s knowledge, hadn’t in all the time they’d lived together, it must be quite the severe shock.
“None of it, do you hear me? I am not having a gun about the flat. Not with three little ones about to enter it, two of them bound to inherit your blooming curiosity, if nothing else.”
At the last comment, however, the other end of the line fell silent, and when Mycroft’s voice returned, it was quiet and far more solemn, to the point that it was almost worse than the shouting.
Of course, it could be argued that people were also something of an insubstantial thing to collect as well, unless you were physically holding them down or otherwise restraining them within your lair. You could do that, once you’d successfully claimed them, as evidenced by Moriarty’s control over the snipers, but to have that as your primary hoard, living, breathing things that needed care and attention to continue to function…it took a special kind of mind to not go absolutely round the bend doing that.
Sherlock would have to, provided this didn’t go entirely tits up, do something to say thank you to John for being willing to throw himself out there in the first place. Not just that, either, but do so when the recipient was Sherlock himself, an unknown quantity in many ways for John still, that was –
No, that was true…but it was still a little bit of a something. Something he could work with, apart from the peck he’d just given.
Only play-acting, like an actor or possibly sometimes that of a child, however real they looked at the moment. Often, something fake can be made to look like the real thing far better than the real thing itself, after all.
The Alpha lost his smile somewhat but otherwise seemed unfazed. “Oh, yeah? Figured that out, did you? Quite the little apprentice, aren’t you?”
Thankfully, he seemed to manage it, propping himself up on one hand while remaining in the other’s embrace, though that might be more to do with how deep the other slept rather than any skill of John’s. Still, he was glad that he managed to not do something that might trigger a reaction.
Which would be…fine, really. Truly. It would. If it turned out to be something entirely off the mark, then all he had to do was ignore it. Ignore it without destroying it, either, of course, which would be the greater challenge.
It then hit him that he could’ve asked some of the other students from John’s school that himself. They didn’t know him, there was no reason they’d choose to refuse to help.
“About time, too, I’d say, but then, with how long the two of you spent dancing around each other, it’s probably a wonder it hasn’t taken longer than this to go from starting a relationship, excuse me, a romantic relationship, to proposing. I had money on it coinciding with the first hospital visit that would be down to age rather than you managing to get the poor doctor into trouble through some hare-brained scheme or case or whatever.”
most, then one of the most inconvenient moments possible to stick his toffee nose in where it most definitely neither belonged nor was an any way wanted.
The unexpectedly uncomfortable spectacle – the reverse, the growing, had been more odd than downright uncomfortable, for whatever reason – was alleviated mainly by what it signified.
John saw Sherlock open his mouth, undoubtedly in order to make another jab, and nudged him, a little sharply. Sibling bickering was fine, but Mycroft had been instrumental in the rescue of the harem and would be vital to keep the freed people out of there, too. What was more, he had treated John well every time they’d met. More than well, really, and his brother, too. In the circumstances, jabs and barbs were uncalled for.
“You could have fooled me, when you’re being this, no, it’s not even being persistent. By this point is obstinate to the point of pig-headed.”
It looked a perfectly ordinary house, but then again, why wouldn’t it? By all accounts, the couple were a perfectly ordinary couple.
There was a tight silence at that, one which went on for long enough that John began to wonder if Mycroft had any intention of answering.
right, to go in and disrupt her life. Rip her from the parents and the only world she knew, just because he was her biological parent.
John tries to make it up to Sherlock for bailing and ends up being his normal, friendly self and Sherlock, torn between wanting to know John and wanting to stay safe and alone, is warming to the other boy and his friendship.
Watson,” Sherlock corrected. The distinction and emphasis were important because they gave John a further legitimacy to be there, not to mention some levity against the nurse in light of the ingrained medical hierarchy still present and enforced in many hospitals.
That was far longer than most of John’s girlfriends had lasted, that was true, but even with the ones who’d stuck it out for a relative long haul, there hadn’t been any indication that John had wanted to, as the colloquial term went, ‘pop the question’ to any of them. Not even if things had been allowed to develop without interferences, such as Sherlock.
What was the matter with his brain? This went beyond his claim that sleeping and eating and such slowed him down, this was…
“I can. Because while I don’t know everything about this whole dragon business – hell, I probably know almost nothing, comparatively speaking – I do know you.”
The face falling was because John was hurt but it went beyond the hurt of a friend, didn’t it? Because he had said something, hadn’t he?
Either way, he’d be beyond angry, and he was. He was practically vibrating with it, even if the vibrations were small.
“No, he was genuinely not expecting the two people he knew, and has known for a long time, too, to do this. Especially not to harm his wife and himself.”
“I’m not,” John replied, though he did shift his voice back, not quite to his normal voice but at least to the one he employed to talk to his patients. “I’m trying to find a method that will allow me to take that gold from you that won’t result in me being gutted or having my throat cut.”
It was therefore with great force and sheer tenacious determination that he forced the thought of it, and the rest of them that sprung up and shot across his mind like a falling star across the night sky the moment he had the first. He knew it to be relevant and maybe even crucial but even so, he couldn’t afford to think on it now and lose focus.
John didn’t know what he was hoping for. For Sherlock to shift? Or just give him some sort of indication that he was still there? Anything more than breathing, really, that would be nice.
It was overwritten, however, by the interest in continuing the eye contact he had with John. Probably it oughtn’t matter whether he did or not, but it did. In fact, it felt reminiscent of their practices, the room around them as well as the people in it fading somewhat in favour of their shared bubble.
But he’d thought that a reaction to somebody else trying to play with your possession, hadn’t he? Then again, it had, and to some extent still did, sounded like the most logical, in-character explanation.
But it couldn’t have him. Not because Sherlock was jealous or possessive, though he wasn’t going to deny there’d doubtlessly be parts of such things intertwined with it all, but because John hadn’t…if John wanted to have anything to do with the dragon, then that was his decision. On his own. Uninfluenced in any way.
Would he make it up? In his own mind, shielded from any and all prying eyes other than his own, why would he make something like that up? It wasn’t to have a replica of the SIG-Sauer in his Mind Palace, that was for sure. What would be the point?
If he had fallen asleep in their bed, intentionally or not, then calling for him would be…well, John wouldn’t do it, at any rate.
The other teen looked at him askance. “Seriously, it’s okay to say no. If you didn’t agree, and why else would you look confused like that, then you don’t have to do it. I understand.”
to touch someone or have someone touch you but if you wanted it, you should be able…you shouldn’t be cut off from it!”
He was stubborn like anything and could be just as pig-headed as Sherlock – there, he could admit that he was pig-headed, too – about what he could and couldn’t do when he felt like it. It was just that John tended to express it differently from Sherlock and often for other reasons, as well, even though one was perfectly capable of driving the other to pig-headed stubbornness they hadn’t planned on.
He bent a little to press their foreheads together, looking intently at the other. “Just because I would rather have endured being without cases for a year than have a mate and offspring when we first met doesn’t translate into that being the case now, does it?”
But they didn’t look as though they didn’t care at all, either. Just let him have some space to wander around for a little while, take in what was there.
It probably wasn’t hard to work out who John had been speaking to, even muddled by sleep as he undoubtedly were. John certainly still was, and he’d been awake for longer than the other.
At another time, he might’ve credited his dragon with more intelligence than that but right now, he knew that it was true.
“Hang on,” John interrupted, voice unexpectedly sharp. “Just wait one damn minute. I’m not having you whittling my feelings and reactions down to having been mostly amplified instincts caused by a bond neither of us understands and certainly not fully.”
Against the things pressing into him, less visible and immediately threatening but seemingly no less capable of and willing to mess with his mind, it was both a comfort and an unexpected anchor.
Moving carefully so as not to dislodge the hand, he got to his feet. “I promise I’ll tell you the moment I can feel them, okay? You’re not the only one who’s excited about all of this.”
Since when had he gone around in circles in his head on something like that? Not just re-examining a thought or observation to make certain that he had it right and it was indeed useful either, but a full-on spiral or at least a back-n-forth at rapid speed?
A crystal clear image of Sherlock as a much older man flashed, unbidden and entirely unexpected, through his mind at that; his hair gone silver except for a few curls of dark brown stubbornly hanging on, his face softened with annoyingly attractive wrinkles, especially around his eyes, his fingers almost spindly and his frame thin but wiry, in that special way some people got.
He had known that she knew him, of course, but to get confirmation of it like this was something else entirely.
“You gonna stand there all day, are you?” he asked, then patted the ground. Sherlock didn’t move. “Come on, sit down. Bloody beanpole.”
Which, honestly, wasn’t much. The last few scales were growing in, as it were, to meet up with the edge of the nail, completing the shift of the one finger into a full claw, the keratin stretched across the entire tip of the finger, the scales shiny in their diminished size.
“Because that’s what I do, isn’t it?” the doctor continued, either not hearing or otherwise completely ignoring his name being said. “No matter what you throw at me, you expect to have me standing beside you for your jabs and taunts and disregard of me, until you need me for something.”
“I’m…I want to keep that, too. All of it and so much more,” he said, feeling exposed but pressing on. “Everything that we do, that you do. I never would have thought it before I met you but I…I don’t ever want to be without you in my life again, and I…”
“Bit late to claim ownership now, isn’t it?” Though the voice was still dripping amusement, John could see as he turned that it was confined to the voice, the amber of the eyes not having returned to brown.
explanation from the older Holmes brother but then, he never really expected that from him, as much as it could annoy him.
In case someone like them showed up, too, Sherlock supposed, at least from the point of view of her…her
“Yeah. So? Oh. If he was liable to throw that out the window, which you might expect from a stereotypical Alpha like that in the face of an insubordinate Omega, then he wouldn’t have been used. But at the same time, someone like that would be able to subdue me if I did decide to attack him instead, without causing unnecessary…no, not unnecessary. Un
“And yet you came all this way to see me, breaking in and everything. I’m not sure I believe you, Johnnie. Doesn’t seem very…convincing, gotta say. I think you’re lying, in fact.”
“I was merely making a point that you might want to curtail or at the very least postpone your…intimacies,” and despite Mycroft’s clear support to their relationship otherwise, there was a distinct sense of something slightly distasteful being picked up in a pair of tongs, though John could understand why a brother would see it like that, “for a little while.”
‘Always, huh?’ Even though it was only text, without smileys or any other mood indicator, the raised eyebrow and amused smile was palpable.
The far more likely scenario was that John would try to keep it going but would drift away and end up leaving, sooner or later, and the absolute worst of them would be if he refused to even talk to –
would I know?” he managed to quietly hiss. “I can’t magic understanding out of thin air, whatever the pair of you might think, and it’s not like either of you has told me what the difference is or even really that there were two different ways of doing it. You at most alluded to something or other, to Sherlock, not me, just before you left earlier. So, what the hell is it and why does it matter whether he has or not?”
No, that was hardly fair. He did, and not just when he behaved like a five-year-old. Just look at how he’d behaved ever since he’d entered the building, that was hardly calm and collected, to say the least, was it?
That and spewing flame, from a human throat, before he’d caught hold of his flatmate would run the risk of incinerating John as well. Though he couldn’t entirely discount it – ever since this whole ordeal started, he hadn’t been able to discount much of anything – the likelihood that a pile of cinders would be able to count as treasure for a dragon was slim, to say the least.
John stared again, blinking at the sudden moistness visible in his eyes in the morning light. “I…that’s…you idiot, you shouldn’t say something like that!”
All of sudden, out of the blue, he seemed to be braving those last few steps and stepping out onto the decking area.
Beta couples fell somewhere between those parameters. A primary gender female could as easily take on the role of the Alpha in the relationship and subsequent parenthood as the primary gender male could and vice versa with the role of the Omega, being not as encumbered by the whole scent-reliance as the other two secondary genders. It lent them a freedom to pick partners for their personality, though of course many were picked for their looks instead, rather than their biological compatibility and instincts.
That left only the issue of how to enact the plan. Well, no, it wasn’t the only issue. Far from it, in fact, but it was the main one and the one that had least to do with getting stuck within his own head in an unhelpful, tiring mental spiral.
“I – yeah, alright, there’s…nothing’s wrong with my passengers, I promise you, just like I said, but I feel…this here – “he pointed not to the bruise on his jaw but something behind his ear which Sherlock hadn’t spotted – “keeps not just throbbing but burning. Or maybe those are the scratches. It’s hard to tell right now, everything’s sort of blending together a little.”
in control during not just a moment of emotion, a spike of it as jealousy provided, but also through something as otherwise difficult to control as sleep. For a long time, too, and a properly deep sleep, on top of all that.
And so, John told Mycroft of what had occurred, in as much detail as he could remember, between the elder Holmes had left and now. There weren’t a lot, honestly, but there was more than the doctor had thought. Mostly, that was because whenever he fell silent, Mycroft would prod into one point or another.
‘John’ continued to pull at him to get further away, just in case. At the same time, however, he was grinning broadly, in that special, warm way that only John seemed capable of producing, at least to Sherlock’s mind, one that brightened up the entire world and yet was reserved just for the two of them.
But this? All of this…madness, for lack of a better word that sufficiently encapsulated everything that had happened in the last however many hours had passed since he’d stormed out, that had most certainly everything to do with the Irish madman.
If you had not built up anything substantial, any proper foundation, in the time of the bubble, found joy in the small things that would occur far more often than the sweeping gestures and amazing moments, then it would be so much harder for you to maintain a relationship, especially a romantic one. That wasn’t to say it was impossible, of course, but it is always harder
Sherlock didn’t deny it. “No. I don’t believe he will, but that is not at all a certainty and I think he could, if he wanted to. Moriarty isn’t a madman, but neither is he entirely sane. He may tip one way, or he might tip the other. He is brilliant, though.”
Though he still kept an eye out for reactions, he didn’t stall to see whether one would come. It was probably bad enough that he’d waited to see it react, quite apart from having to also keep an eye on the older brother to make sure he didn’t do anything stupid. Instead, he immediately moved the box onto the next wound that he could reach easily.
And it was Sherlock’s handwriting, too. The blond had lived with him for too long not to recognise it as his and nobody else’s.
much of a danger junkie – but certainly some genuine and deep-reaching sympathy, seeing the man like this.
A huff of more genuinely amused laughter, though still with something of a brittle edge to it. “Still not entirely there, are you? Because that deduction even I worked out first try.”
The older brother could undoubtedly extrapolate a lot, nevertheless. He always could, and this was something that he must have quite a bit of personal connection to and understanding of.
It all made the desire, the urge stronger than before. At the very least, he wanted to push his nose into their bond bite and just inhale for a few seconds. Minutes.
“She’s your child,” Sherlock said, speaking so soon after his brother that John had to blink and concentrate to discern which was which.
That surprised John enough to almost ask ‘are you serious?’ but he managed to bite down on it and keep it from passing his lips.
They were both shouting now, Sherlock a full-blown one whereas Mycroft was shouting through a hissed whisper, somehow managing to make it sound just as emphatic as his brother.
“Then again, they also diagnosed you with a limp, which has miraculously disappeared,” Mycroft continued as though John hadn’t spoken. Ironically, that bit of familiar behaviour felt just a little comforting. “And I am helping, Doctor Watson. I have contacted quite a few medical professionals with enough knowledge and skill in regard to our…species to be capable of helping.”
For the same reason it might seem an odd cut here but otherwise it'd be a long and somewhat rambling chapter. I do at least feel like we're progressing, which is something :) I might be wrong but lemme have my illusion.
There could be no doubt about it, utterly ludicrous though it sounded – and it did sound beyond ludicrous. There was no such thing as a
He got another squeeze of his hand for that from Sherlock, though he suspected that was more to do with scoring a point, somehow, than anything actually constructive. It’d fit, after all.
When Sherlock noticed it, part of him wanted to groan in frustration, while another part of him wanted to pretend he’d never done it. The majority took the lead, however, and offered a half-smile of recognition and just a slight hint of embarrassment. Something which only John got to see, he knew, but he was fine with keeping it that way.
In reality, while multiples were not exactly rare, they did not constitute quite that huge a percentage of pregnancies. Around a third of pregnancies had two or more, especially if the one pregnant had carried more than one before, and of that third, triplets counted for a third of that. Twins were a quarter of what was left, and the rest was divided fairly equally between the various larger litters.
Then again, why would they? It wasn’t as though he’d just been turned into a dragon – was that even possible? It sounded absurd but then, so did the concept of dragons in the physical world to begin with – and his outlook had changed according to his new body and subsequent mindset. This wasn’t a vampire or a werewolf movie.
Yes, okay, so he might have taken a few extra moments to appreciate the way fabric pulled and strained over the body that should’ve been lanky but was more athletically wiry and the way his face softened when a genuine smile graced it. He wasn’t blind, after all, and okay, he might also have found his fingers itching to touch from time to time, but he’d kept it contained within himself, knowing that it wouldn’t be appreciated.
He experienced a surge of anger at his English teacher for dragging this all back up to the surface when he only wanted to forget, in the process showing him that he had a long way to go yet to perfect his skills at deleting things, which only exacerbated the matter.
Did he consider it a failure on Sherlock’s part that he’d gone out for food and that Alpha thug had used the window to drop in to try to mess with John on a psychological level, something which he’d succeeded with to an extent, even if the blond didn’t let him see?
He made a face. “Creepy, to say the least. Been hunting this little thing, in fact,” and here he held up the watch, “for most of the time I’ve been awake. That and talking to your brother.”
It didn’t sound as his normal inner voice, not quite. It was, for lack of a less fanciful term, nastier.
No, no. Calm down. He didn’t know whether Moriarty had laid any claim on him, had added him to his hoard –
“So that he can pump you full of another round of bullets coated in bone dust?” John asked, the exhaustion he felt keeping the anger on a low flame. “I don’t think so.”
He didn’t need to do it on their anniversary, of course, and it was sentimental to a ludicrous degree that he felt he had to, and yet…
He had the word; he was sure of it. It had been said shortly after he’d resurfaced, he knew that, but when he tried to focus on it, it slipped away. It couldn’t be that hard, though, to work out, given the limited number of things that could hurt a dragon.
The jade statue had at least had an aesthetic appeal. Even if he couldn’t see the appeal of it himself, he could at least recognise why other people might want to have it in their homes, silly though he thought it.
The Omega reached out, quickly, and touched the shoulder that he could just about touch. “Don’t you dare sound apologetic, alright? I just wasn’t prepared for it, that’s all.”
Interestingly, it was Sherlock more than John himself who was worked up about it. Not because John didn’t care – to be honest, he’d rather have the tension released, one way or the other – but there were other things to occupy his time and mind with.
Before he went, though, he paused, then dug into his jacket pocket and pulled out what he had left in there. Without looking back, he threw it over his shoulder. Then he was gone.
He hadn’t ever wanted a mate, that was true, but neither would anyone ever have wanted him, beyond the instinctual. It would never have been an issue, or so he’d always thought.
was going to lick his blood off the claw flitted through his mind and while not as horrible or life-terminating as the other thought, it still filled his mouth with bile.
“I’ve sat in much more uncomfortable positions before when my transport has given out on me. It’s not as though it’s something that is irreparable or even that damaging.”
For now, it didn’t matter. So long as he stood still, he could look at either of them. It could even be beneficial if things worked out right. They would hold his attention, and that was the crucial part.
He shook his head. “For a moment, I thought you had gathered everyone and brought them up here to celebrate Christmas with us and you’d made me go pick these up to make it a little bit more special for us as well.”
That and, for all Sherlock’s cases and other adventures over the years, John was the one with the more practical approach to physical altercations, not to mention the training and experience.
“Why?” he repeated, voice remaining gentle but now with an added minute crack in it. “Of course, you, of all people would – Why do people usually kiss someone, Sherlock?”
“Why did you pick up?” He shouldn’t sound accusatory and he thought that for the most part, he managed not to.
Somehow, possibly driven by his instinct and the urgency of the situation, his mind managed to push through enough to register not only that John’s heartbeat was swift and erratic, showing no signs of slowing down as he still perceived danger, but that Moriarty was rising from the ground, his wings rising along with him as he did so. The rest of him remained mostly human but the wings themselves were unquestionably real as they rose upwards, resembling the closed wings of a butterfly, even if the wings themselves brought more bats and pterodactyls to mind.
Mycroft’s counter-comment to that was it was an abundantly evident necessity for him to go over Sherlock’s head, as he hadn’t even got as far as looking at engagement rings, let alone having bought one. If he was truly serious about his intentions, then he would have to work a whole lot harder on it because as it was, the ginger was anything but convinced.
Taking a deep breath and flexing his wings one last time, he took off. To his mild surprise, he rose through the air much faster and easier than he would’ve anticipated.
The murmur died quickly after that. As it did, pride swelled in Sherlock on behalf of his friend, whether it was his place to do so or not.
‘But of course. However, I still do not quite see how I am to help with its whereabouts, as I assume that was why you contacted me.’
Or maybe there was nothing wrong with the book and it was all on him. Most probably, as his mind kept superimposing the people he knew and cared about onto the various victims of the plants described.
A lock wouldn’t be sufficient to hold them out for long, if they were determined to get in. Dragging the sofa over would be the most efficient way of blocking the door but it was not the lightest or most easily movable item in the room. Nor could he drag it onehanded, and his left arm, though the blood was no longer oozing out, felt heavy and lethargic. Certainly not up to the task of pulling a sofa over.
It wasn’t even as though the previous behaviour from Sherlock gave him much to go on, either, was it? Hell, that had been some of the argument that had prompted the whole thing, hadn’t it? And what had led up to it, with the watch and everything.
Besides, Sherlock could handle this on his own. Now the beast was named, and he knew what it would throw at him, so it’d be easy enough to shake it off. He knew better, after all.
Was there something else in the Alpha’s scent beyond normal musk and traces of pheromones? Why would there be, and why would it affect him like that? No, the idea was stupid. But why else?
It’s not as though we go around dropping appendages like some sort of lizard, whatever the physical similarities.”
The words, audible mainly because of the quietness around them, came from Mycroft. John’s eyes darted to him, to acknowledge that he’d heard and understood, noting in the back of his mind that for all the evident dragon’s healing capabilities, both brothers looked as though they’d been in the wars, then back to see what reaction Sherlock might have to that, whether it was positive or negative.
How did that mean that he wasn’t comfortable with…with intimacy? It surely only showed that he was just rather selective.
Tessa was his and he loved her so very dearly, with every fibre of his being, but he also loved his mate just as much. He wasn’t going to let him down by dismissing a concern.
“Rich of you to call me petty when you drag John into the argument, even though it’s abundantly evident he’s embarrassed at having listened in and is trying to escape the situation.”
The other reason was that while he probably still had a bank account and likely also money, he hadn’t used it in the time he’d been in the harem and his credit card had consequently expired. Possibly his account had been closed due to inactivity, too, if the harem owners hadn’t put things into his account. Had they? Money had become something of a background thing in a place where you were sequestered from the world and everything, though really only the bare necessities, was provided for you in order to keep that sequestering complete.
At the same time, the weight and movement of the knife, hanging from his belt, as he walked was inescapable. He was grateful to have it but even so, it was a reminder that he wasn’t normal. Not in the regularly accepted sense, anyway.
John pulled back, enough to be able to look the other in the eye. The worried panic on his face, after the younger Holmes had tried so hard and done so well on keeping calm and controlled for John’s sake, cracked something in his heart.
“Don’t know,” he answered, which was true enough. He hadn’t heard from John at all, so far all he knew, he could be anywhere.
Which was where the ‘chore’ had come from, too, after all, and why it had irked John so much. Not that Sherlock didn’t understand that. However he had reacted at the time, in a less wound up and strung-out frame of mind, he could more easily see and understand that viewpoint.
Not that Sherlock would think that of John. It wasn’t even because he couldn’t see the point in what he meant. Assumptions and stereotypes aside, the secondary genders did have different priorities and interpretations of the same issues, even if they were then further modified and nuanced by the factor of the individual person who saw them.
“The point isn’t to relay a detailed account of my sexual debut, whatever you might think.” John opened his mouth to correct him, but a raised eyebrow snapped it shut again. “The point is that when I had that experience, it didn’t get very far and that wasn’t due to me being sex-averse. It didn’t get very far simply because when I tried, I felt a growing hunger in me in relation to the person I was with.”
“What, you were expecting it not to?” Sherlock replied with a haughtily indignant expression on his face. The blond frowned for a moment, until he saw the light in pale eyes.
Silence ruled between them for a bit afterwards. Then Sherlock settled his violin case on top of an abandoned crate, opened it, and brought out his instrument. Without a word, he settled it, closed his eyes and began to play the first piece that came to mind.
“I know I was out of order, Sherlock,” he’d said, a little sheepish, hand rubbing at the back of his neck, “and I apologise, but I didn’t see your name anywhere on the list.”
So, he concentrated instead on getting undressed as quickly and efficiently as he could. This wasn’t the time for teasing or even alluring reveals, and to be honest, he didn’t so much as look at the Alpha as he got undressed, too, the dressing gown thrown on over black slacks and a dark blue shirt.
decided to get in on the action. Then it got all muddled and foggy and Sherlock was bound to trip and fall in that fog.
It was more than tempting to do the same for the entire suggestion that Moriarty could ever possibly be Tessa’s…father and he had to wonder why he had even let it finish formulating.
“Now, according to the experts,” he said once he was upright, “we first of all wait, to see whether the removal on its own will prove enough to allow his body to at least shift back into either full dragon or full human, whichever it will feel the safest in. To be stuck in a halfway state like this while invaded, as it were, has left him far more vulnerable than if he’d been fully in either.”
John inhaled in the nasal way people used when they were either waking up or preventing themselves from falling further asleep than they already were. To accomplish that, the body effectively jerked itself awake, with the resultant inhalation.
All in all, it felt as though he had lost more energy than he’d gained, somehow, and he was only an actual headache and a horrible inside of his mouth from a hangover. Well, that, and vomiting straight onto the airplane carpet, of course.
He didn’t hold it aloft or even say something to mark it. Not that he needed to; Sherlock was certain he’d recognise it just about everywhere, ridiculous and overblown as that sounded. Especially considering just how small, relatively speaking, it was. How ordinary it looked, too.
But given what they…what had been brought on her, and her daughter, whatever else she was and had done, they owed her, not to mention Tessa.
Then the silence was broken by the joyous cry of a little girl who had, in the absence of attention, worked out what she needed to do in order to win the game.
That he’d crept up into John’s old bedroom in order to think was a small, irrelevant matter. It certainly had nothing to do with comfort or that John wouldn’t think to look for him here first thing.
There was silence for a moment, two, three. Just long enough for Sherlock to think that John continuing to hold out the watch like that was just a tiny bit silly-looking, however much he understood the reasoning behind it.
That wasn’t to say that was all that was going on in his head. His thoughts had become coherent enough to not only register and understand what was being said but form understandable and logical comments.
A few steps further down the road and John had added, “I’d better not reach for it and find that it’s gone AWOL because you wanted to try something.”
“Thank you,” John said, his voice getting a little bit strangled and his eyes shining brighter still in the light that managed to slip into the room. “Can you accept that I feel the same?”
They stayed like that for a long time, long enough for John to start shivering in the relative cool of the room and his lack of clothes. But it didn’t matter. Nor did it matter when the hands changed to clutch at his shoulders from behind and the nails dug in hard enough that he momentarily feared they’d become claws. They hadn’t; they were just digging in very hard.
Instead of nodding or something similar, though, the doctor frowned a little as he…well, he didn’t quite pull away, but he was at what you might call a pre-stage to it.
John took a deep but quick breath, tamping down to the best of his abilities at the moment on his anger. He didn’t try to reach out for his friend again, worried of what the reaction to that would be.
“It’s abundantly evident that it isn’t, and I’d thank you not to try to pretend things are fine when I can clearly sense they’re not.”
The Omega blinked puzzled. “What for? Oh. You don’t need to thank me for that.” He paused, then added, “kettle.”
Someone who seemingly took no notice of her apparently unconscious form but was instead entirely focused on the other Alpha and, somewhat, on the Beta, too.
His expressive eyes, the way the corner of his eyes crinkled when he was smiling. The fierceness of his glare.
There was still so much to sort through and work out, but far too much had happened already, and they weren’t going to get much further right now. Even if they were, Sherlock ought to put a stop to it and focus on protecting his friend. No, more than that. His…his romantic partner.
The dragon might have gone with brute strength before but not now. Now it was scratching and tugging at every possible strand in every conceivable direction and equal angle, so as to discover a weak spot. It had almost undoubtedly done that before this point as well, but that said, Sherlock was in no doubt that it was perfectly aware of what he was doing, even if it pretended not to be, and had redoubled its efforts.
Knowing that he was being utterly stupid didn’t alleviate it nor did applying intellect and logic to the situation. The reassurances he’d been given by John
Then his gaze fell on something, which Sherlock couldn’t see from where he stood, and the blond almost fell with it as he slipped into a kneeling position in front of the bed.
“I’ve got it perfectly under control,” he snapped, “and I don’t see the problem, in any case. You’ve been doing it for years.”
Hoping it was a case to take his mind off John, he picked it up, only to snarl when he saw the sender. Nevertheless, he opened it.
She was one little girl in a sea of millions of lost people, special and precious to nobody but him.
The doctor didn’t speak at that, didn’t move. But the corner of his mouth turned up, just enough for Sherlock to see, which made him smile in turn.
Mycroft blinked at that, though only the once. “My word, there’s a turn-up for the books. If I had known your apparent animosity hid something like that, then I should’ve had – “
Oh, bugger it all to hell! One moment of inattention, of letting his mouth run off without guidance, and all that he had carefully worked on fell down around him.
Now, though, there was no denying that even though it wasn’t visible or audible, there was a definite though insidious feeling that something was off about him.
Whatever the case, a hand came down on her shoulder. Quite honestly, it was as much on her neck as on her shoulder, though, and the reason why was not hard to work out.
There was nothing there to indicate anything that would take him from them, either. Which admittedly wasn’t the only necessary qualification to say something like that, let alone definitively, but it was
For his part, John had something of a tense wait on the other side of the fence, as it were. Of course, what felt like ages inside a mind doesn’t have to take more than a few minutes in the outside world. But even so, and this had taken considerably longer than a few minutes, the wait felt incredibly long and all the time, he was waiting with somewhat bated breath and tensed muscles, needing to be mentally and physically for the moment he saw the eyes shift and become the tell-tale greenish white.
Well, for a lot of things, really, small but coming together to fit and show a different picture, though mainly it was because he could recognise it. Could see it for what it was and see where he had done the exact same thing to get through some kind of otherwise impenetrable barrier. It was effective, too. Usually, at least.
John blinked, thrown by his own thought. He looked down at their ‘joined’ hands. Was that it? Could that be the reason Sherlock had chosen John’s wrist rather than Mycroft’s to clamp onto like this?
In a way, it was almost funny. Especially in hindsight, seeing how John had called him a machine earlier because of his lack of care about another human being, and here he was, desperately trying to care for one human being, to protect him at all costs and to not lose him and his companionship.
For a moment, he had no idea who said it or even where it had come from. Then he thought it might’ve come from someone down on the street but that wasn’t the case.
Minutes ticked by, without anything other than the outside noises of normal city life. It seemed almost absurd, that life ticked on like ever before just outside their own windows.
In the ensuing laughter and…check for other drops of toffee in inconvenient places when they came home, Sherlock forgot Mycroft’s attempt altogether.
Moriarty’s grin only broadened as he focused on John, and he pulled harder on Tessa’s arm. Hard enough to dislodge John’s grip which had become momentarily more tenuous as he had stood up.
“What kind of…” No, not game. Don’t say ‘game’, that’s not what this is, and you know it. Not to Sherlock, in any case, and you don’t need to accuse him like that, even indirectly, “…clues are you picking up by going back and forth like this? Does it have anything to do with the wedding venue or educational opportunities or was that just to…I don’t even know, really.”
“Possibly. Or rather, possibly hoping for it.” He looked away a little at that, seeming annoyed, though likely with himself. There was something else in that expression, too, though, something more than annoyance or even hurt.
“Are you…?” How did he finish that sentence? He could see that he wasn’t fine or even okay, far from it. ‘Going to survive’ seemed somewhat overly dramatic. Change of question, then. “What do you need?”
Of course, that still had a limit so all that he had to do was to make it beyond its reach and he would be safe to surface the rest of the way, safe in, not to mention comforted by, the knowledge that he could shift one part of him without risk. That he would, as long as he kept that leash, he would never not be in control again. Not in control of a sleeping entity, though, waiting to erupt, but one which was already awake, fiery and dangerous –
Then Sherlock moved forward to ring it, though he ended up pressing the index finger of the blond rather than the bell itself. The doorbell still rang, though, and seemed to toll inside the building as well as outside.
“Then what need did you have of a backdoor?” Sherlock interrupted, judging that enough time would’ve passed now for things to have…eventuated, and so he’d had enough of this. “What could they have possibly done for you that you couldn’t have achieved on your own? If you are that powerful, I mean.”
Which was easy for him to say, he knew, given that he had gained children and mate in one go, but that didn’t negate its truth.
“Happy anniversary, Sherlock, and merry Christmas, too.” He leaned up and kissed the brunet’s cheek.
He took a step forward, ignoring the way he could, by the brunet’s estimation, see the amber eyes gleam out of the corner of his eye and the cry of his name from Sherlock himself.
The eyes seemed to finally…well, properly focus on him, as though what he’d been looking at up until this point wasn’t exactly John, not quite.
And he really did need to focus on the task ahead of them rather than let himself get side-tracked mentally by things that he could do nothing about, at that moment.
John looked at his scared expression, his anger tempered. “I’m not leaving. But do you understand me? It’s my body and I have all say over it. I’ll go a long way for your experiments and curiosity, even when you don’t tell me the reason or lie to me, but not here. If I
“Well, yes, technically, I suppose.” John paused, then decided to take advantage of Sherlock’s momentary distraction and nudged him again.
There was silence for a moment after that, a moment that seemed to stretch far beyond the time it lasted.
“Sherlock, what’s…what’s wrong?” John asked as he turned around to face his bond mate. He did his best to make sure his voice was gentle and non-judgmental because his intention was not to be that or even come close to it. His intention was merely to understand.
“Sorry,” he said almost immediately, trying to stifle it and not having a whole lot of luck. “Sorry, I can’t – “
If the bastard wanted to try anything more physical, more violent here, in his home territory…well, he’d been warned, hadn’t he?
John kissed…it wasn’t fair to say he kissed passively or hesitantly. There was real passion there, it would be difficult if not downright impossible to deny it, but it was cushioned with a care that Sherlock wouldn’t have expected. As though he was afraid to break something or…or scare Sherlock off.
The noise that threatened to shatter the windows then might have been a laugh. To untrained ears, it would’ve been, a shriek of laughter uncontrollable by the person uttering, so deeply felt was it.
It was anything but easy; not only his fear working against him, scattering his thoughts at every attempt to piece something together, but there was the exhaustion and general fallout from this whole mess.
“I know,” he said, in a quiet voice that bordered on small. He could mess things up perfectly well on his own. “I know that, and I should’ve thought before that came out of my mouth in the first place. Please go on, I’ll shut up.”
Thinking out loud was one thing. Speaking without thinking was quite another and did not tally with what he knew of his mate.
“A theory, tight or loose, or even a fully formed thought about it is better than nothing or unsubstantiated inklings, which is all I have. Please, Sherlock. Tell me.”
“I…” How to phrase it? It didn’t quite feel as though his friend was completely there just yet and he didn’t want to somehow tip the scales back towards the dragon being in charge. John had no idea whether he could do that, but he’d rather not risk it. “I don’t want to, either. Believe me. But I don’t…I don’t want to be nothing more than a part of your hoard, either.”
“Well, no,” Sherlock agreed, surprisingly easily and genuinely, too, it seemed. “But apart from the fact that it’s a bag from an incredibly well-known - I looked that up - high-end baby and children’s store that prefers understatement in its decoration and marketing to appeal to customers and will therefore in all probability contain something relevant to both of us rather than just you, it was an effective way to break the tension a little – and make you more amenable to agreeing.”
Sherlock considered him, then nodded. “They are tangentially related, through you and the harem, but the linking factor doesn’t solely consist of you.”
All Sherlock cared about was getting through the next 24 hours as painlessly as possible. Then he could move on. He would’ve fulfilled his blackmailed obligations to Mr. Duffy – though it was in the nature of blackmail that paying them off, whether in money or in kind, would never be the end of the matter, he knew the English teacher didn’t have the right kind of mind for the thought, at least not yet – and he could ask his parents, or Mycroft, to send him to university a year early. Whoever was easier to…persuade.
But it wasn’t cumbersome, and if he wasn’t focused most on getting them home as quickly and safely as he could, he might take some enjoyment in the exhilaration that was a constant partner of flying, no matter how often one did it.
Oh, there was stuff littered around their flat, that was true, but that hardly constituted the same thing. To be honest, John had a semi-serious thought that a lot of it just…appeared. He certainly couldn’t remember buying some of the things they owned, and they were not things that Sherlock would’ve ever considered buying, either, and yet…there they were, indisputable in their place around the flat.
Which was why, as he inched himself closer, he also angled his body, ostensibly towards John for protection and blocking. Tessa had not looked back at him and neither Moriarty or John seemed to have noticed anything, either. It was only a matter of time but the further he got in that time, the better.
“Specify? That was barely a broad overview.” John smiled a little into the long neck before he pressed on, interested in seeing how the other would react. “Would you want me to open you with my fingers or my tongue? Both? How slow is slow, exactly? Would it be one digit at a time until you’re begging me to push another into your widening hole? Is it only my fingers you want or is it my cock as well? With or without a condom? Would it be with you on your back like this, legs spread or possibly around my waist, or would it rather be you on all fours?”
Another part was hurt for much the same reasons. He was laying his world and himself bare like this and John refused to see past his…
John sighed then shook his head with a small smile of his own. “So…I’m a berk for thinking I’m being a berk, is that about right?”
The point was that the experience was new but rather wonderful, really. Especially since Sherlock had tucked his chin to rest on the outer edge of John’s clavicle, which meant that he wasn’t breathing right into his ear.
Now, John could say that he at least meant the gesture and that he genuinely respected the man. What was more, he thought he might actually have seen the man rather than the Alpha or even the institution in the form of the government.
That was the reason it was scared and why it was trying as furiously and tenaciously as it was, with various method to find the one that worked. Not because it was fed up or angry or even plotting a greater revenge against him for what he had done to it and how he had treated it. Well, it might be, but the underlying reason for them all was that it was running out of time and consequently was losing its grip as well.
What struck John as odd was that carried between them, John taking the torso due to the grip on his hand, which complicated matters but with some painful twists was manageable, Sherlock’s head immediately, almost automatically slumped against John, nose close to his throat, clearly inhaling deeply, as though that would somehow help.
“I’m not dangerous.” It was whispered and ever so slightly cracking, the sleepiness in it somehow only making it sound more vulnerable.
“Yeah. I’m not that daft, ta, I could see that, even if it wasn’t what you always do. What you were thinking about, was what I was asking – and don’t fob me off with ‘nothing’ or similar.”
“I do,” the consulting detective protested, though slightly weakly. “I…I touch you, for instance.” He meant to imply that he touched others, too, even if he couldn’t think of them, but he wasn’t sure he succeeded.
There was no way that he wouldn’t be feeling all of the things he had since…well, at least since finding out about the paper on his daughter. Further than that, honestly, but it had certainly escalated at that point. Sherlock would defy almost anybody else to not react emotionally after everything John had been through.
“Hi,” John answered, his voice a little hoarse. He tried for a smile, but it sat awkwardly on his face, wobbling like a leaf in a drain and just as likely to sink.
Well...that got long, didn't it? And loaded with stuff, too, but I couldn't find where I could reasonably end it before then. I hope it's been worth the wait and been interesting, it was to write. But we are moving along, at least.
A louder bang than before, which was accompanied by a clearly audible shriek, jolted him out of his thoughts.
He hoped he would answer, because the uncertainty in the wording, the question marks, had lodged something small but strange and not entirely, if even at all, pleasant inside his ribcage.
“Which is rather shaky, to say the least, as the records for her are almost non-existent after she leaves the orphanage. If they had a legitimate legal claim that they weren’t afraid of, there would’ve been far more legal documents to be found on her.”
“Then you do what you think is necessary. Like with the locks you’ve put on. Or whatever else you need or think we need for what’s happened. It’s okay not to tell me – “
And it was rather unfair of him to assume that just because Sherlock hadn’t shown any interest in sex or anything related to it in the time in which they’d known each other, that he was completely inexperienced or just unaware. Their first kiss, with both of them mentally present, had been somewhat passive on Sherlock’s part but the second one definitely hadn’t been.
It shook him more to realise that the thought didn’t shock or horrify him anymore, and even then, it probably didn’t shake him as much as it ought to do.
“When it happens in the dragon’s own bones, no, it is not. That is not always but often a sign of overindulgence for too long or simply old age. But when it is an invasive body, much like the wrong antigens, yes, well done, there is something that can be done. However, for that to work, the source of the infection needs to be removed entirely. Hence, why you have been removing the dust from the wounds.”
Along with forming his new identity, really, which was a work in progress like nobody’s business. But though the road ahead was long, whichever aspect of it he concentrated on, and it seemed to go on and on without an end in sight, he was at least walking it now.
What the Omegas and Betas had responded to when he had brought them out of the harem had been the voice of command and the authority of an Alpha, yes. But just as much, if not more, it was the factor of his affiliation with John and that Ben had vouched for him through his presence and behaviour, too.
That had been part of the reason why he’d sent him around the city like that in the first place, after all. Even when he’d stepped out onto the decking, Sherlock could’ve pretended not to be there or, if he wanted to be seen or it was later, he could’ve called it wanting to make sure their first anniversary was remembered and duly celebrated.
To be honest, he didn’t want to wait but at the same time, he didn’t want John to have his phone confiscated either, and so he’d play nice.
But where to go? They obviously each hair their own bedroom they could go to but that felt incredibly and entirely wrong, after they both had admitted that they loved each other. After they’d
Well, obviously, he would be. That was part of the whole point, after all, wasn’t it? For him, at least. If he’d had any interest in child-rearing – and that was a thought too spine-chilling and gag-inducing to even contemplate – he wouldn’t have waited until now, and certainly not to kidnap one. This particular one, and all.
At least they moved in time and space here, and a bit in interpersonal relationship, too, I think, even if it's not fast progress. Don't know but I don't feel quite as apologetic as normal, so that's...good. Possibly this means it's rubbish X) :S
He fought against the darkness of the room as he sought to check on whether any part of the brunet had shifted while he was asleep. The danger wasn’t the issue but more to see whether it was something they would need to keep in mind. For Sherlock’s peace of mind.
It felt uncomfortable and slightly disconcerting to think about. Especially if he hadn’t been aware of it, at least not in the sense of cutting off access to his emotions like that. Yet, he could, now that he thought about it, not deny that he had, and possibly had more fully than he would’ve ever expected.
“What would…what would you do if I said ‘no’ instead…of the expected reply?” Sherlock asked, cracking one eye open just a sliver to look at the doctor.
I didn't mean to disappear for over a month but things have been...you know when a kid has that one teddy that's holding together by the very strings? Yeah, meet teddy.
Possibly, yes, but it could be true going forward, because he needed to find some way in which he could make sure John wouldn’t come to any, further, harm without having to move out permanently.
Looking at Sherlock, though, he wasn’t exactly sure he’d said the right thing; the look on his face didn’t abate and the hands John was holding were trembling slightly.
“But I love my Mama,” she whispered, in what seemed almost an apologetic voice. That couldn’t quite be right, though. Not at that age. Confused, yes. Frustrated, likewise. But outright apologetic? That didn’t sound right.
What Sherlock actually did was slip behind John and, though he didn’t exactly loom over him or put his hands on him, the Omega got the distinct sense of being surrounded but in a protective way rather than domineering.
“I believe that you love me,” John said in answer to his unspoken question, confirming at least some of it. “Genuinely, or why would you have waited to this point? If you just wanted to claim me, there’s been plenty of opportunity for that during our friendship. Hell, you could’ve just done it when you were wrapped around me back at the pool, if that was all that you wanted. You were certainly agitated enough about someone else having a go at it, what with the blood and everything. Is that what you bond with, by the way? Must be, since you mentioned arteries earlier.”
the object, he closed his eyes again and, with the red thread of his presence, he searched for the counterpoint, its parent, as it were.
Sherlock blinked as he frowned. “You’re the younger brother, same as me, don’t start. Even if there isn’t the same age gap between you and your sister as with me and Mycroft – “
Because…because for all of his problems, for his lack of understanding and general behaviour as though he hadn’t matured beyond five, there was a depth to him that had nothing to do with the size or capabilities of his brain nor with the mythological beast down at his core.
He blinked rapidly and stifled a yawn. There wasn’t time for him to be tired now, he needed to pull himself together and stay alert.
Some part of him was actually surprised that he managed to do so with relative ease, considering everything, but right now, what had held such sway over him before had little if any appeal now.
What struck him the most wasn’t the clearly aged face, in comparison to the last passport he’d had which had expired hell knew how long ago, staring back at him. Nor was it his status as ‘Bonded’ – they’d got rid of the practice of writing in the Alpha’s name as well around a decade ago, at last.
Considering his fears, it would only make sense for him not to be overly keen on sleeping. Yes, he said he’d got the dragon under control, and John believed him. The problem was that Sherlock didn’t seem to believe himself.
So, he merely smiled when the cab driver looked at him and then down at his stomach. Told him it was twins when he was asked how far along that he was and accepted the congratulations and the wishes for a problem-free delivery.
“If there is any damage to them caused by the deterioration that isn’t immediately visible, it can be detected before…in time?” he asked, matter-of-factly, only slipping a little at the end.
“Perhaps a boyfriend would do the trick,” John said, calmly and reasonably as though it was the most logical suggestion in existence.a
“I’m trying to do it all correctly, to…” It came out a hesitant whisper, as though it was despite himself that he was speaking.
No, that wasn’t…okay, perhaps it was a little bit like that, too. Especially seeing as this wasn’t the first instance of it, either.
Well, that was something. And he’d made it through the…day? Day. He’d made it through the day sleeping without being eaten or claimed. Right?
So, then, the coast was clear, as it were, for Sherlock to spin the Frenchman a story about how they were in fact a part of a new branch of the police force that had only just started up but which dealt specifically with the trafficking of children and young people.
It was stupid. He was helping no one by remembering them, especially not when his mind changed the faces of them like that.
Moving faster, lest it be Moriarty and the shit-heel thought of another method of getting through to him if he still didn’t pick up, one that would be far less pleasant than this.
When he was far surer to have confirmation Sherlock was in it for the long haul, too, and was entirely, thoroughly sincere in his actions and intentions.
Apart from the hand still gripping his in a vice-grip. Well, in a sense it was almost as unresponsive as the rest of the body, it had just become hard instead of limp.
There was a vibrato to the voice like the aftermath of the strings of a piano being plucked, one which echoed inside John.
He stared at John, at a loss at what he should do or what he should say now that they were alone. Not only that, he was also scared that coming close to John again would set something off, something which he couldn’t then rein back in.
He’d even heard of a commune, which wasn’t a harem, somewhere up in Sweden, where only Omegas and their children lived. No Alphas were allowed, a rule which was quite heavily enforced, according to records and accounts, and all Omegas were part of the raising and mothering of the young ones, including breastfeeding.
It did put them at a disadvantage in terms of instinctual closeness with their children, of course, but that could be compensated for, if so desired and given enough time. It didn’t mean they were loved less or wrongly, in any sense. That said, they were still derided in a lot of media for lacking that ‘innate connection’ that traditionalists tended to bang on about.
“Second aspect is appealing,” Sherlock admitted, a smile forming. “But I don’t think he’d burn very well.”
Thankfully, Mrs. Hudson had had mercy on him, probably mostly because she’d been charmed by John when they’d been to visit; she’d provided a tray of teatime sandwiches for them which was in the fridge along with some juice.
Ah, yes. One of the things that made it a bit ridiculous he was scared of losing himself to be nothing more than a possession for the brunet, if you looked at it at a certain angle; that he was already defined not by himself but by his relation to Sherlock.
Bugger what he was allowed – if John was alive, then he was taking him home, regardless of what the slimy eel had or hadn’t done to the doctor. John wasn’t Moriarty’s!
Especially not when you again took the possibility of possessions being dead bodies as likely as being living, breathing people into account. When your neck was snapped and left you a lifeless doll, it didn’t much matter for what reason you were killed, did it? At least, it didn’t to you.
“Who, then?” he asked, speaking softly. He moved a hand up to cup the back of Sherlock’s head, guiding him wordlessly towards his bond bite.
But John only smiled at him and quickly made his way through the toast he’d tried to push at the Alpha. He then leaned forward until he could reach a cheek and planted a kiss there. His lips left a slightly sticky mark as they pulled away.
“I – no.” Fuck, that came out all wrong. Why had he – “I’m sorry I said that. I didn’t…I know you wouldn’t. I just…no, there’s no excuse, is there?”
“This is far too much,” he said, his voice a little odd because his throat constricted on him despite his best efforts. “Honestly, I can’t – “
He was glad, not to mention relieved, to see that the Omega could put what had just happened behind him, for lack of a better term, enough to not just make the little non-joke but also register the reply and snort at it.
Instead, for Mycroft, it was ‘to be found’, which meant that they weren’t there to be found. I.e., they didn’t exist
That was also why Sherlock getting his wires mixed on what was friendship and what was courtship seemed the only possible explanation if there was more, or something else, to it than pure possessive behaviour.
The important part to consider was that now that he knew, he should have an easier time than before of untangling what the other was weaving.
John smiled. Even with his hair a mess, indents on his face, his skin sleep-blotchy and his mouth open in a surprisingly nasal snore, he was in no doubt as to why he had fallen for Sherlock. Not because of his looks alone, mind, but…
That they had apparently decided to cram as much crisis into their supposed ‘honeymoon’ phase as possible was another matter entirely.
“Yes, he has,” Sherlock said, openly and loud, staring back at the enormous eye. He even raised his chin a little, taking care to mimic the way John did it, just to prove a point, knowing that the dragon would see and would know, too. “A far better one than I deserve, without question, and you won’t get me to think otherwise or think less of him in general. But then, I’m not the only one to be affected by him, am I?”
John couldn’t help wondering, even knowing it was completely irrelevant. So was the small amount of admiration for being able to apparently coherently type something on a phone keyboard while simultaneously delivering a lengthy explanation. Then again, he was Sherlock’s brother, wasn’t he?
Which was where the panic he was trying hard to suppress was coming from, too. What had he done while he’d been asleep? He had not meant to disobey John but at the same time, he had not intended to sleep deeply in any way.
“You make it sound as though I’m a character in a fairy tale, returning across the threshold after his adventure.”
“You are, don’t even try it, and so am I. But the important point right now is that he needs us to be there for him. Call help, if you need it, but as it is, he’s mostly human and he is in no fit state to be moved.”
It was that time of year again. Not only was it the time of fairy lights and horrible decorations, people peddling God only knew what in the name of the season, get-togethers everywhere and the quality of the crime dropping to something horribly pedestrian.
“I never said otherwise,” Sherlock replied, unable to keep his lips from quirking any longer. “An it does have the benefit of creativity and accuracy.”
But given that, they were damned regardless and as such…no, that wasn’t it. That wasn’t the truth. The truth was that he’d give Sherlock the moment and the reassurance he needed, regardless of whether there was time for it or not.
He took a deep and slightly wobbly breath before he continued. “Anyway, the point is that I’m not afraid to say it out loud as I have been. If you don’t want to hear it, that’s fine, we can work around it, or you can delete it, if you prefer. But I wanted you to know. That’s probably incredibly selfish, just dumping that on you, come to think of it. Twice, too. Three times, really, but this time, you did ask, so – “
So, no, it wasn’t that he was scared that this applied to them as well, even though he technically didn’t know how their relationship would change with the addition of a child. Three children, all things willing.
“Please refrain from making any more comments like that,” came Sherlock’s voice from beside him and there was a low-grade disgust running through his voice. “That is revolting on too many levels to count without being physically ill. It is bad enough that I have to sit next to him for an entire car ride.”
The other aspects had been greater factors, though, but there was a reason that, despite being an Omega, he’d gone to join the military in the first place and why he’d managed to rise to the rank of Captain in an establishment that talked far more of equality and opportunities for all than they ever practiced it.
Finding at least one curtain that didn’t swing back quite fast enough for him not to catch it and another that wasn’t closed at all, not even when the person caught the eyes of the Alpha, Sherlock filed it away as a possible avenue, if they didn’t get enough information from the Beta.
Sherlock could see the anger lurking at the bottom of those blue eyes and was just about to brace for it, wrong though that sounded, when it sank beneath visibility again. More importantly, it fled from the rest of the body too, proving that it wasn’t just a case of John hiding it.
He walked back up close to John and placed a finger, which still felt tipped with an absurdly sharp claw, gently on the underside of the blond’s chin.
“Come on,” he urged. “You’re going to give me that explanation but I’m not going to stand here to be ogled and gossiped about to my face.”
“It wasn’t that. I – I wanted to do it and honestly, it’s also a bit anchoring.” It was his turn to colour, though for a completely different reason.
“I’ve already got one. A very important one that I’m afraid will take all my attention for its duration.”
“Yes. It is. A very big thing. But that’s the point, John. I need to know before we go any further if you’d be okay with…well, what it entails.”
Would she know? Would she be able to scent something in John’s scent that she recognised from her daughter? Her husband hadn’t but then again, he was a Beta while she was an Alpha.
Though he could feel the claws on the bony fingers as they circled and tightened around his ankle, it was only around the one, which left his other foot free. It wasn’t the best or safest way to do it, but he estimated that he’d have about enough leverage, and he sure as hell wasn’t going to allow the dragon to just pull him back in like it pleased.
That was Sherlock’s fear, at any rate, and even though he now knew that John would roll with the punches, much as he always did when the chips were down, he couldn’t let go of the fear that there’d come a point where it’d be too much for the doctor.
“If that’s the case,” he said out loud, still with an ear on both directions where trouble could potentially lurk, “then I don’t see any reason to continue talking to you, either.”
And John himself, he had to admit; the images he created in his own mind of doing that was certainly doing the job of bringing his erection into full…vigour, as it were, though it hadn’t exactly only been at half-mast before.
Still, right to the end, she had fought, hadn’t she? In fact, without her, he wasn’t at all sure things would’ve worked out…as they had. He wasn’t going to say that they’d worked out fine as he didn’t know that yet. Far from it, in fact. Things could change so rapidly, after all. Just take the –
One part of his mind was still doing its job and informed him that for all the pride and smugness, a Moriarty denied of something he was expecting to have was almost as dangerous as a bored Moriarty.
The clerk readily agreed, the process smoothed by people’s tendency to easily believe in slightly ditzy Omega behaviour, conditioned to through years of indoctrination and media portrayals.
Sherlock turned his head so that his mouth was close to John’s ear in turn, his breath blowing across it and sending a small shiver up the blond’s spine.
When the brunet pulled back again, it was with a look not of triumph but of tentative hopefulness in his eyes.
He wasn’t going to banish it, as he had thought before and semi-tried, as well. It wouldn’t work, as the dragon was indeed part of him, and he could no more banish it than he could cut his heart out and expect to live. Though nor would he allow it to take him over or remain dormant, lying in wait for when it thought it could seep back in and take over.
“Sherlock,” the brunet replied, taking the hand and shaking it. Normally, he wouldn’t bother, but he did this time. It certainly didn’t have anything to do with the feeling in his chest or his stomach. Not at all.
, wasn’t it? Perhaps not in so many words, and not purely because it hadn’t been spoken out loud, but the essence was there, and that essence wasn’t exactly pleasant.
Sherlock nodded and let himself be led out of the building. He ignored the eyes that followed them, more focused on the fairground ride his head and heart were currently experiencing.
Though those were the only overt signs, there was something about the entirety of his bearing that had…shifted, for lack of a more accurate term, to something that was more tense. That was, tense not in the way of someone worried or scared but of someone who was being wound up and it was only a matter of time before something, again, snapped.
He felt John tense immediately and cursed himself for the slip of the tongue. He meant them but in the context of being a dragon, it could come off the wrong way, and it would just figure that Moriarty would’ve used the word in front of John previously, just because.
“He does give me more than what I had. What I could possibly gain on my own and far more than I have ever given him,” Sherlock said, his voice as calm as anything while his chin was still raised and his beam of a smile was still intact.
The fact that it now saw the threat wasn’t the same as saying it was going to back down, which was only fitting, considering. That would mean it conceded defeat, after all, and while Sherlock was an entity of his own, for the most part, his pride wasn’t wholly disconnected from that of the dragon’s.
That said, the blond could empathise. He certainly could do without knowing any details about Harry’s sexual exploits, much less the result of it, regardless of what secondary gender she’d presented as. It wasn’t gender issues, it was simply the fact that they were siblings and there were some things you’d rather not know. Or imagine.
John turned himself to see that the door had a few more adornments than when he’d gone out. They were of good quality, too, and fitted on properly, it seemed. Which, of course, was rather crucial if you decided to put on extra locks like that, but even so, he was surprised by…the whole package, as it were.
“No, of course – ah. Yeah. Hell, I need some more sleep. That or a drink. Neither of which is a good idea right now.” He drew a hand through his hair. “Look, I’ll – I know where his clothes will be and if the watch isn’t in there, then…”
He tried to shift again, on the chance that being home, being safely back in his territory, with his treasures around him, would convince his body to let him go all the way back to human. Or human-shaped, in any case.
Sherlock wouldn’t have cared a jot about it, as you had to sign up for it. Or, so he’d thought, until he’d head his name mentioned as he passed through the throng of students. As it wasn’t exactly a common name, there was no mistaking it for someone else. Worse, it was mentioned in relation to the talent showcase.
“I’ve been in a harem, not a vacuum.” He managed to say it without any infliction. It wasn’t a defensive bristling, not any longer. It was just a counterpoint.
He didn’t need to glance in John’s direction for that. “It’s all about who you choose to share it all with, isn’t it?”
The first class of the day had begun by that point but as it was only History, he sat himself at his desk at the back and kept quiet. If somebody caught him out, it’d be no different than everyone else stuck ‘learning’ about some lousy battle or other, and normally nobody bothered with him.
He ignored the points that it’d been gradual convincing rather than an immediate and complete severance, that it’d only convinced his brain, not his heart, and not fully so, and that he’d given in and written to John once between the Monday and now.
And yes, part of him just didn’t want it to be her because he wanted his Omega happy and wanted his little girl home safe, too. That was hardly an unreasonable way of thinking, was it?
“John…” Sherlock breathed, incredulity and joy, disbelief and relief, hope and worry all rolled into that one single syllable, somehow.
These were not the only ones, though, that was evident, and if that was the case…then he was spreading himself quite thin. Almost dangerously so.
To assume so would be unfair of him. Seriously unfair. He took a deep breath, then other to be sure that he was calm.
“Claimed you. Or attempted to. But recently, as otherwise there’d…” He trailed off, his focus on the wounds as he bent over to examine them more closely. Interestingly, he was very careful that he didn’t touch the wounds, though to the doctor, it didn’t seem born out of a fear of infecting
Once he stopped typing, he turned to his mate and answered that he’d been asking someone where they held the most weddings in the area, another for the nearest school with a particular set of grounds, and then he’d written Mycroft to keep him abreast of the situation.
It was a lingering kiss, though, and when he realised what he was doing, he found an urge to slide his lips a little to the side and down.
Doctor first, before the Omega. Instincts either thrown into the discipline and compassion of the doctor or suppressed so as not to hinder the practical approach of the medical way.
“Is this meant to celebrate our anniversary, love? If it is, then…well, I’m grateful, of course I am, and it’s truly sweet and thoughtful.” Still no answer. “But you didn’t have to go to these lengths to prove that you can remember it or be thoughtful about it without needing to be prompted about it, you know.”
But luck only ran so far, even his, and he didn’t want to run the risk. So, much as he didn’t want to listen to his baser needs, he had given in to the bare minimum he could give away with.
“They’re not coming here.” Though he knew it was stupid, because they would be far better qualified to help Sherlock than John could hope to, there was something inside of him that rebelled at the thought of having strangers poking and prodding at Sherlock in this state.
“Sherlock. Sherlock, please. Stop. Please stop. Sherlock!” he cried as he writhed and buckled, with no discernible effect.
He found himself wishing, and wishing fervently, that he knew what to tell her. In a way, he did, but that wasn’t actually helpful. But looking at her helpless and frustrated expression made him want to tell her anything, promise her anything if that could make it better.
Oh, not that he was going to leave actual breadcrumbs…though come to think of it, he might in fact put down physical breadcrumbs, either to play or because there was some other caveat or twist to it that would benefit him, if only through entertainment value.
It wasn’t long after that that John started asking about the papers on Ruby. Sherlock produced them without fuss and admitted that he had only gone over them the once, while they’d been in the cab home.
He wasn’t exactly an expert in what you might call the practical application of kissing techniques. In his youth, when he’d been trying to satiate the hunger that materialised at the start at puberty as part of the hoarding tendencies, he’d been trying to get close to people in a way that he would never have thought he’d want to when he was younger and he’d deny when older.
“And what, exactly, would you have done?” Sherlock asked, bluntly. “Fought the owners single-handedly? Bought them all out? Smuggled them through tunnels dug with a spoon?”
Once they were in the air – whoever had arranged this flight had thankfully reasoned that both passengers knew the safety precautions – John tried again.
angry. Nor had he pulled his hands away from Sherlock’s grip, a fact which the consulting detective used to pull them closer to himself, even though there wasn’t much space separating in the first place.
At ‘this’, he made a sweeping motion with his arm to indicate the room but more than that, the whole situation. It wasn’t going to go away, that much was evident, and exposure would help him deal with it, surely.
“Not necessarily but that’s another discussion. But if you are ace, then that’s fine, and it’s fine if you’re not ready yet or are scared or similar. If, however, it’s because you think I don’t want to have sex with you because you’re male…we already discussed that, and if it’s because you think that you will screw it up one way or another, then – “
Well, that would’ve been wonderful, wouldn’t it? Even considering the moral quandary that would still then loom over him of taking his daughter back, it would mean there was no Moriarty to contend with.
Someone was definitely going to hear and come running – or alert the police. Did Lestrade know about their nature? John wouldn’t have thought so, or he wouldn’t have had such a disregard for overturning the flat, the den of a sodding dragon, like that in a drug’s bust. The man had never struck the doctor as suicidal.
The other man didn’t leave, though, but leaned forward, presumably to scent him properly. Whatever else was going through the doctor’s mind, he wasn’t having anyone that close without express permission and so he reached out and pushed the side of his hand into the throat of the other, hard. Not enough to cut off his air but certainly enough that it would prevent him from moving further forward, in case that made up the difference.
Unfortunately, that also meant a rather unsavoury one, in terms of smell, which John came home and yelled about for a while. The resultant argument and make-up cuddles on the sofa afterwards pushed the thought from his mind completely, at least for the time being.
He didn’t question that it was Sherlock that had taken it, quite apart from his not even very creative bullshittery with the sewer rats – it couldn’t even fit down the pipes, if it
Now they only had to clear the last few impossible hurdles in their way, somehow, and they’d be home and dry and free to live their life as a couple.
On a positive note, the keening wasn’t the only thing that had quietened; the shudders were now small and much more minute than they’d been since they started. He took that as a good sign. It was one of the few he had, wasn’t it?
This wasn’t that. John wasn’t looking up at Sherlock at all, his grip on the guitar was to keep it in his grasp and playable where he stood rather than for visibility, and as his fingers moved on the strings, shifting and changing as needed.
Speaking of thrown, the next thing the doctor knew, his lips was more or less attacked by cupid bow ones, pressing against his hard and if not outright demanding that he should part his, at least asking very, very intently.
He just about got a look at the expression on the other’s face before he was once again more or less attacked with a kiss.
Not that he didn’t enjoy it or kiss back with as much fervour as he could possibly give. As much as he was given, in fact.
, had they? What they’d seen, what they’d expected and wanted, that had been the unassuming yet charming doctor, who wore comfortable clothes, was safe and could be brought home to the parents for Christmas dinner.
He couldn’t help it, he stared. It wasn’t entirely with disbelief or shock, either. Some of it was fascination, some was childlike joy, and just a smidgeon of it was admiration, despite his best efforts.
Sherlock did know that this was their milestone, right? He hadn’t deleted – no, he hadn’t. John knew he hadn’t. There were a lot of things he could believe about Sherlock Holmes and forgetting things he didn’t deem important, however the rest of the world or specific persons felt about it, but…
Perhaps that was the reason. It could easily be contaminated by being handled and it was imperative that it wasn’t contaminated. Well, he could get Mycroft to fetch him a pair of gloves – again, between a former doctor and a chemist, there were a few odd things that just came standard – that would take care of that.
Once outside, he stopped. John, who had protested loudly through the trip of being dragged along, looked at him, eyes narrowed as the penny dropped all the way and was about as well-received as the proverbial bad one.
Moriarty blinked at that, a shadow passing briefly over his features before disappearing as though it’d never been.
But what could he do, then? What could he say? He couldn’t think of anything that wouldn’t come off as trite and useless, unless of course he – but perhaps he ought to wait with that. He had yet to meet someone who reacted with positive interest to details of how he solved things.
Sherlock raised his head a little, just enough so that he could look the other in the eye. “You’re clearly thinking because what’s coming out of your mouth isn’t pure automatic – “
At first, Sherlock didn’t even notice. Then the lack of hand in his, something which had become not only a comfort but a staple, a craving and an expectation to at the very least happen often, slammed into him and he turned around as though he was practicing for a pirouette.
That said, it didn’t mean he didn’t watch for it, since the risk was very real. It just wasn’t why he said what he did.
Mycroft returned from his quest for items, somewhat loaded down with them, the large pair of scissors clear among them. He passed those onto John without a word after having deposited the rest on the bed that wasn’t occupied by the lanky body.
Annoyed and embarrassed – wasn’t this exactly what he’d been trying to avoid? Now John’s last memory of him would be a snivelling, pathetic, overly attached wreck – with himself, he started to bring his hands up to wipe them away.
It wasn’t anything special, to look at. Just another men’s watch, with wear and tear and a little crack in the glass but still of some sturdiness, which it would have to have been to survive two tours in a warzone owned by a doctor, a
“You obviously knew him before…before we met,” John argued back, “and you’ve enough of a history for you to have clear and deep disdain for him, which I can hardly see you develop for someone just because you’ve met them.  Not to that extent. Especially not one who seems as clever as you and can give Mycroft the run-around. But he was pleased to see you, I think – and come to think of it, he could smell you when I met him earlier. On me, I mean. The scent bond, presumably. All of which points to a stronger connection and interest in you than in me.”
Such as the things, some of them almost humanoid in their shapes while others resembled the merest sketch, crude and unfinished, of something human and still others had not even concept in common with humanity, that had broken free from their restraints and were creeping up on him.
So, John was now carrying a few things. Sherlock hadn’t been so cruel as to make him outright laden or the like – he could learn his lesson, couldn’t he, even if it had taken him a lot longer than it ought to in order to properly understand? – but still, it had ended up being more than a few different things and this building’s elevator only went up so far.
And John was full of little tics and gestures, normally, in terms of his face but also his body, giving himself away in all sorts of ways, small and big, without the smallest need to rely on his scent to get there.
“We’re going to take her from a madman who wants to,” and there was just the tiniest pause to the voice that spoke of the Alpha carefully exchanging the intended word for another, possibly better or more suited word, “to get to her mother through her and might even want the child himself. I don’t see how that could possibly be a bad thing.”
He felt the warmth of the body next to his bed but didn’t look up, even though he’d turned the display off the phone. There was an evident twitch of hands, but he didn’t follow through on manhandling the now taller and, thankfully, stronger teen. He’d lose.
Sherlock meanwhile looked about him, trying to ascertain whether anyone had seen or heard anything, now or earlier. Everything seemed normal or at least quiet, as it ought to, given the fact that people shouldn’t have been home at this time of day.
The rest of him was…a mess, really. He told himself he’d known about it and shouldn’t be surprised or hurt, another part was hurt and sought for some meaning, and a third just wanted to push the whole thing away.
“What I think?” he echoed, as calm as he possibly could, which verged on bored or possibly just on no inflection at all.
“It’s okay,” he heard himself saying, voice quiet but cracking slightly even as he tried to sound reassuring. “I know you didn’t, it’s okay.”
It finally made contact at that, pressing part of itself against his back, the touch of it like the tip of a needle before it was pushed through skin and the softest, warmest of blankets.
That had been the intention but despite his best efforts to stay awake – he remembered quite distinctly John’s tone changing at some point and had known it’d been him who’d been addressed – he had fallen into not only a sleep but a deep one at that.
“Not just because of your association with Sherlock?” The implications ‘wanting to screw with you to get to Sherlock’ didn’t need to be said to be heard.
The problem was that however successful the brain might be at convincing itself, it did not actually solve the big thing.
‘Yeah, thanks, thought of that. There isn’t anything else that fits the criteria. That was what he took without my consent, that I know of, and it’s what fits in the timeline of all this, too. If it’s any object at all, it’s the watch, and so I need to find it.’
Asking Sherlock why he had it was both pointless and a bit irrelevant. What was relevant was the length of the knife. Which thankfully was reasonable and not the overly large blades some hunting knives were, particularly those of macho Alphas that were dying to communicate just how large their dicks were, or they wished them to be, and the Betas who tried to compete with them.
Sherlock didn’t notice it but the sigh was outwardly as well as inwardly and it was only sheer luck that it didn’t carry enough that John was alerted to his presence. His precise whereabouts, at any rate, because it was clear that John knew Sherlock was around here somewhere. Which was good. He just didn’t need him to spot him immediately, that was all.
“Ah, yes. The inestimable Doctor Watson.” He leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers in front of his face.
Why had he done that? This wasn’t his conversation to barge in on or take charge of. John didn’t need someone to take over for him, in the slightest, nor was it likely he would welcome it, for all that he’d momentarily stiffened at Moriarty’s comment, so what exactly was he doing?
He knew it. Had known it since they had taken off and before. On top of that, they neither could, nor should, influence her or try to, more than they were with their sheer presence, of course.
He didn’t want to let John know that he was struggling with that, but he probably ought to. If they were indeed in this together, it would be beyond stupid to keep that to himself, even if he very much wanted to. He knew they had just discussed the notion of him becoming a bad father, which John had adamantly refused, but that didn’t mean it couldn’t be brought up, now did it?
It was said, slightly surprisingly, gently, without a hint of a snap or any archness. But even so, it managed to catch John off-guard. Mainly because it was something that he had said himself, had
To his brother, he’d maintained that he had no interest in it and no need for it. John stayed as it was, went on cases with him and even cared for him, as much as he was allowed.
It could therefore be that what Mycroft had seen as a claim that wasn’t a possession marker had to do with friendship rather than romance. That Sherlock’s brain, massive though it was, had somehow conflated the seemingly confusing feelings associated with being someone’s friend, being liked for who they were rather than what they could do, with romantic feelings and the instinctual behaviour associated with courtship had kicked in on their own.
He was jolted back into the here and now by the car coming to a halt that was likely considerably less abrupt than it felt.
Nor was he terribly concerned if it cut him off from aspects of his nature that would prove useful. If this was what it would take to have John stay with him and, just as importantly, make it possible for Sherlock to ensure his safety while he stayed, then that was what he’d do.
And, when he took a moment to look a little closer, particularly at those multicoloured eyes, the feelings were there, clear to see, especially when he focused on John for a moment.
That was – surely, John didn’t expect him to…to be unfaithful, did he? Was that something that Omegas expected of their Alphas? Surely not, that would…that would violate the point of…
The likelihood of there being a favourable outcome to such a revelation was zero, he knew that, and as he’d had no desire to leave 221b or have Sherlock pull away from him, he had no reason to.
Which was a potentially good sign; it might mean that just John being in the bed had been enough to assuage Sherlock’s dragon side. Of course, you could argue that had already been proven when the blond had sat outside the bedroom where he couldn’t be seen and couldn’t be touched. John didn’t know whether the brunet had been asleep then, however, which changed the situation somewhat.
It wasn’t really that she leaned up and sniffed at John’s bitten scent gland again, though it did slightly surprise him. Rather, it was that she then looked down and put her hands on the curve of John’s stomach, more prominent with the way he sat. More awkward to reach, too, unless you were a little girl with equally small hands.
John snorted despite himself, which earned him a disapproving look. “Sorry. I know it’s not the time, but I just had the mental image of you in lab garb, holding up a test tube. It was – “
What stood out clearest in his mind and what made him absolutely, utterly certain he’d be able to know it was her when they did find her, that was her scent.
“Regardless of how intimately familiar you are with your partner’s scent, it’s not a given you can pick up on such minute differences and indicators,” the midwife said, “but it might be that Mr. Holmes is possessed of better olfactory capabilities than most. There’s been a few studies done on that topic, at both Cambridge and Paris Sciences et Lettres, I believe, but I’m not up on their findings, so I’ll spare you my speculations.”
The hurt had taken a backseat to the feeling of joy again; John knew the value Sherlock placed on the garment, and had only done it because of lack of options, to save Sherlock.
Luckily for him, Sherlock had, it seemed, been as deeply or almost as deeply, asleep himself. Of course, you could never a hundred percent know with the consulting detective, but with the look that he gave the doctor when he woke, John thought it a safe bet that his friend had in fact been asleep the entire time.
No matter. Well, no, actually, it did matter, but it could wait. Wait for when he had a brain not about to be highjacked by anything and nothing else breathing down his neck, including his own idiocy.
He’d known that without needing to see it, he suddenly realised. The moment it had caught, that he had managed to get his will to bend it and break through the energy to make that connection and make it spread, he’d known that he had the upper hand. That he was in control, the master.
He could of course ask Sherlock for help. They were bonded now, after all, it would not be an unreasonable thing to ask for, clothes for him and essentials for the child. If it came to that, it was Sherlock’s flat and his food, if you could call what was in that fridge food, and he was happy enough to sponge off of that, so why not the other things?
“It is,” Mycroft interrupted to confirm. Judging by his voice, it sounded as though there was something more to it than that but right now, John wasn’t too focused on the minutia of dragon behaviour, at least not what wasn’t immediately relevant to the current situation.
Well, that wasn’t entirely true, was it? Mr. Duffy, it turned out, hadn’t just been hired to be the English teacher for the sixth form. He’d also taken on helping the pregnant and soon-to-be-on-maternity-leave Miss Wilkins with her music classes and had been delighted to discover Sherlock’s proficiency on the violin.
What made him less than horrified that Moriarty was playing with them like that wasn’t even that he’d had dealings with the Alpha before and might therefore expect it. It was that, too, but not exclusively that.
As Sherlock tensed up even further at that, John realised what he’d said. But that was the fact of the matter and while he’d go a long way to help his friend and partner deal with things, he didn’t see why he should be the one to traipse around the topic. Not when it was him who’d been affected by it, not Sherlock.
When he was at the fourth piece, the crystals happily dissolving and being absorbed by the wound, something happened. Something major.
Though he hadn’t technically been her doctor, the more accurate term of keeper was distinct enough to be instantly recognisable, with all the negative connotations and prejudices that might entail. Of course, he knew that there would hardly be likely to be positive connotations. Even so, if anyone knew he had been the keeper of a harem, he could be facing repercussions, and not necessarily of a purely social kind.
The doctor looked at him at that, long and steady, or at least it felt like a long time. It was long enough for Sherlock to feel scrutinised, which was something of a novel experience in itself. Then he cleared his throat.
Mood well and truly killed, and frankly he couldn’t care a whit about it in the wave of concern, John settled himself into Sherlock’s lap. But only so he had more of a ballast to be able to wrap his arms around the taller man, slightly cumbersome as it was due to the hands still clinging hard to his shoulders.
Sherlock then added that his partner was a doctor and could administer aid to both the man and whoever else might be hurt within the household.
That Sherlock might, at another point, have called it a scavenger hunt himself, had it not been for Mycroft’s use of the phrase, was an entirely irrelevant point.
But exactly because of the situation they were in, it had felt rather cathartic to laugh. He did manage to hold it in, though. Somehow.
I hope this doesn't feel as though we're right back where we started or that nothing's happened, though I fear it might. If so, I really apologise. We'll get somewhere, I promise. This just keeps on ballooning, I'm sorry.
The Alpha reached out a hand, taking John’s in his, slowly enough that John had time to pull away if he wanted, and the blond let him.
I am incredibly sorry for making you all wait even longer than normal on this chapter. Have a semi-long chapter in compensation.
“Clearly there isn’t, or you wouldn’t be holding the watch as if you’re about to show me just how it’s going to save me hundreds of pounds, if only I buy this once in a lifetime opportunity timekeeper.”
In any case, that he so staunchly refused seemed to pull Sherlock up short, at least enough to open his eyes and look at John, a frown of confusion creasing his brow again.
Often enough, it seemed those Omegas, when they had offspring, treated all the children as their own and were all ‘mother’ to them all, with relatively, surprisingly little issue. At least, no more so than sprung up in all relationships.
John gave him a sidelong look at that, even though they were facing each other. “I suppose I shouldn’t ask just how old you are, then. Asking a lady her age is probably the safer alternative there.”
It might be that they bickered, fought and engaged in other petty sibling concerns, more strongly and more dysfunctional in their roots than most, admittedly, but beneath and around it all, like a border that you might not notice but which was essential to the perception of the picture in question, was the care that only…only love could bring.
When at last the doctor pulled back, it was with a beam of a smile that could’ve powered the entire borough around them for the rest of the year, if not well into the new one.
The frown cleared as it clicked. John smiled softly and let the hand he’d used to brush away the curl trail down Sherlock’s cheek.
As far as Moriarty went, though, there was both the risk that he’d never stop and the unlikelihood that he’d restrict himself, either to only targeting John while he was out or while on his own. To look for rhyme or reason was to blind yourself when it came to that Alpha.
And yay...more talking...at this point, it feels redundant and like too little to apologise. Still, I do - and for probably the next chapter, too, just in advance.
“No, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have a right to be,” Sherlock all but shouted, though his still somewhat raspy voice made it somewhat weaker. Quieter, at any rate.
Sherlock frowned, not understanding the comment or its implications and admittedly couldn’t help but worry just a little bit about it as a result.
Funny, really. That what he got upset about, or had to force himself not to get upset about, was whether or not a stuffed animal was smudged and grimed by some security oink and not whether they’d get detained for something as stupid, in context, as suspicion of drugs.
He wrenched open the door to come face to face with his flatmate, who had his hand out to, judging by the height and angle of it, grab the door handle.
“Working through the stock of patisseries around Whitehall again? I’m surprised they don’t ban you, your gut must be putting off the other customers.”
That way, he couldn’t see John’s reaction. Couldn’t see the could but wouldn’t have to face the bad, either. It would be up to John to decide what to do, then. Whether he wanted to see Sherlock or not.
But that did tie into why he had trouble believing Mycroft that the issue was rooted in something before all of this. If it did, why hadn’t Sherlock spoken up about it? Or at least shown signs? Any kind of signs, really. John felt sure that if he had, he would’ve picked up on them at some point.
The dragon must’ve found out he’d not only spotted the jealousy and grabbed it but that it was melting away as he held it.
Which wouldn’t do. Sherlock couldn’t risk John working out the smallest bit of this. That he’d gone back and forth and even had a small breakdown – alright, so perhaps a bigger breakdown – was no indicator. His doctor would just ascribe that to Sherlock being Sherlock.
Of all the peculiarities of Sherlock Holmes, one wouldn’t have thought that the acquiring of things would be one of them.
By the time he reached Baker Street, though the other end of it, he was simultaneously tired enough to have his arms and shoulders ache to sag, tense enough to serve as a bowstring for Sherlock’s violin and frustrated enough to be about this close to kicking at whatever came to foot at whoever it was managing to stay just out of sight except for the shortest of glances every now and again.
In that light, it was probably for the best that he didn’t do or say anything at all. When he was out of his depth in situations like this, it was almost inevitable that whichever action he tried to take, it would turn out to be the wrong choice and end him in a worse situation than he was already in.
The first kind of pride he would’ve understood, Sherlock’s Alpha tendencies coming to the fore, despite his best efforts, now that he was bonded to someone and had a child on the way. This second one that he was in fact exhibiting was surprising in its earnestness, its innocence and not least of all, its strength.
So, yes, it was definitely okay, and he could say with honesty that it wasn’t to appease the dragon or prevent him regressing back into whatever had been going on.
So far, there was no luck, and he could feel time bearing down on him, but he had to finish this conversation first. Otherwise, he was sure to wake Sherlock, thus if not ruining the whole thing then at least making it far more difficult for him to pull off.
“Thank you,” he said. He was quiet for a moment while his expression, still soft and warm with that something Sherlock couldn’t identify, slowly gained a hopeful nervousness as he moved closer still until his face became disjointed features.
Mostly, however, it was a written account of what they’d managed to observe for themselves. John took some further comfort in the observation that the few areas that weren’t covered by that descriptor, Sherlock seemed either knowledgeable about or could research further.
But no. He felt clearheaded enough, able to form a complete sentence in his mind without issue and with none of the foggy pleasure he’d experienced twice now.
So long as he accepted and did it genuinely, as it were, then everything else could’ve gone to hell and it wouldn’t have mattered.
It pushed the feeling of intimacy up a notch or two, but it was a different kind of intimacy than something carnal. To be honest, it was a bit of a balm after their arguments and bickering. Not that this was alone in being that, of course, but as they kept reopening the wounds, so to speak, it was good to be able to apply some balm to it more regularly.
Inside was a…actually, there were quite a few things in there. He recognised a rattle, a plush toy, a lovey, what might be a hooded bath towel, judging by the look of the cloth, and cotton baby booties. They were all in soft material, the plushie and the lovey in that special fuzzy-soft fabric, and the colours were a gender-neutral white and yellow. In fact…was that a bee attached to both the lovey and the rattle? Seemed to be, though the plush toy was unquestionably that of an otter.
“I think I liked you better in the other clothes. Not that that’s saying much,” Sherlock said, and his voice was disdainful and calm. One might say slightly suspiciously so, as though he was keeping a very tight rein on it.
A part of John was offended, another was touched, and yet another lauded Sherlock for thinking of it and offering to help, again. A small part of him, which might be proof that he was indeed tired, found the last sentence oddly amusing.
By the time he’d gone over each and every wound, big, small or tiny, Sherlock was in the peculiarly situation of polar opposite feelings running through him simultaneously; he was aroused by the touches but more by the fact that it was John doing the touching, and he was nervous and apprehensive, bordering on scared, of just what would be in store when the examination was over and John laid aside his doctor persona.
That only lasted until that night when his brother called to inform him that he wouldn’t be doing that again. After retreating to somewhere John wouldn’t hear him, Sherlock shot back that yes, he would, so long as Mycroft went over his head and decided on his own what was the best approach to this without taking either Sherlock or John into account, let alone letting it be his younger brother who did the deed, as it was
Even so, they must have registered that he looked, as the curtain tweaked to look swung back just as he looked up.
Not that that didn’t work, of course. His infiltration of the harem was…actually, that was an example both of it working and it very much falling apart on him.
That seemed far more likely, even if it made John’s heart ache. To be honest, it ached in simultaneously both a good and an unpleasant way. Unpleasant because, well, though he’d known it to be unrequited, his feelings hadn’t gone away, and good because it put an intrinsic and significant value on their friendship, even if a subconscious one on Sherlock’s part.
“Hackett sounds about right, too, right now. Butchered, more like, but…” Focus. “What if it’s not there, either? What if it’s broken or it doesn’t work? What do we do, then?”
“Mama,” she called to the woman, reaching her own arms out in that very particular way of small children.
No, but there was no reason for him to let her drag him back down. Okay, that wasn’t fair, either. Even so, the thought of contacting her to tell her that he’d found an Alpha to bond with – he hadn’t informed her he’d gone to work in the harem, partly because it was none of her business but mostly because they actually hadn’t been in touch for a while even then – made the bile rise in his throat, and even more so that they were scent bonded and he was carrying that Alpha’s child. Children. Child.
Though it could be argued that breaking and entering, going into a territory that was neither his nor somewhere he’d been invited into, like the Alpha had was provoking an Omega, a pregnant one, and there had been made further laws to protect Omegas in such situations, a lot of judges were old-fashioned, to put it very diplomatically, and leaned towards sympathy for the Alpha instead.
It ought to have been John who went there, but he was the doctor of the scenario, not the detective, and so it wouldn’t make sense for him to go. Not when there was a patient, at least. That was apart from the fact that it might be a bit too much for John to see right now.
As long as Sherlock wasn’t home and he didn’t know where he was or why he was out, though, he wouldn’t be able to go sleep, let alone sleep soundly. Then he would merely lie awake, waiting for some clue as he tried to work out what had happened. He wouldn’t be angry, but it would end up with him getting fed up and throwing the covers off to go and find Sherlock.
If I'm missing some tags, could you possibly let me know? My brain's a little fried and I can't think of any.
To find John looking up at him, smiling. The smile was sat in an otherwise slightly grim, tired, and determined face. One which had scratches down the side of it, two bloodied welts that started just around his eye and trailed off down his cheek, and a bruise that had bloomed rapidly as it spread dark-purple across his jaw.
As for the question of whether they would be walking the entire way, John could see the shape of a somewhat familiar car coming closer and closer and soon enough, an equally familiar head stuck out of a window.
That was part of the reason why he hadn’t claimed John for himself. Mycroft was of the opinion that he had in all but the formal steps and had more than once tried to make Sherlock take their connection the rest of the way for both their sakes, as he called it, but Sherlock had adamantly refused to.
Looking out, he saw that he’d have to squeeze out between the window and the ornate railings more than he thought he would have but on the other hand, he could use the railing to pull himself out instead and swing other onto the other side, climbing down it enough that he’d be able to touch the canopied awning on Speedy’s with his feet. It wouldn’t break his fall, of course, but it’d help him make sure he didn’t land on the spiked railings at the front door of 223. Small mercies and all.
Possibly aware of this, or perhaps he just had other things to be getting on with, despite the hour, Mycroft didn’t waste time being offended at John’s words or his tone of voice, audible though he was still whispering.
It didn’t make it easier that, with only a quick glance at his face and other exposed bits, it was clear to see that he’d been standing there for a bit, if not an outright while.
Of all things, the elder Holmes hummed a smile. “I would almost be disappointed if you didn’t.” A moment’s pause, then, oddly quietly, he said, “I shall endeavour to make it right, John.”
His previous life, and not necessarily purely in relation to the drugs, seemed like something that had happened to someone else, and when he looked back on it, he couldn’t seem to find much, if anything from it that he missed.
John moved to sit more upright in the chair, the Alpha’s broad hand following the movement to keep touching the Omega’s belly. “And we’re not even at that point quite yet, are we? The normal span is between 16 and 25 weeks, and even if there will be movement at 16 weeks or before, it’ll not be enough for you to be able to feel them.”
It should be odd and maybe off-putting. Instead, the thought that John on a subconscious, though granted not necessarily instinctual, level had known something was wrong even before he’d woken up to know the scent was off, and had sought to remedy the situation without grovelling or catering to the Alpha’s wants rather than his actual needs…that thought filled Sherlock with pride and the warmth of deep affection.
“You certainly don’t keep your light under a bushel, do you? But if you really are all that universal, that integral to the very existence of humanity, why are you contained in vessels in the first place? Surely, you would have no need of puny bodies or their accompanying brains if that was entirely the case, never mind the fact that it is actually possible to push you away and have control over you. You’ve been shackled and suppressed for a long time, so excuse me if I fail to be all that intimidated by you.”
All of that was bad enough and could be a genuine problem, granted, he wasn’t going to dismiss or demean that or the Omegas who had to suffer through that kind of behaviour. There was almost never any point where it was trifling in such cases because everyone was different and so were their thresholds.
“Mycroft, I…we need that,” John said, trying to keep his voice gentle and soothing, much in the way one would a skittish but dangerous animal, which wasn’t that far wrong, in a way. “I know why you don’t want me to have it, I do, and it’s perfectly understandable…”
“All those opportunities to do so and you only make a stab at it,” the clawed fingers which had blood on them moved for emphasis, “when someone else decides to play with your toy. Really, Johnny, how can you stand to be treated such?”
That was…rather endearingly in-character, wasn’t it? Sherlock felt his heart swell in response to that even as he also felt a stab of guilt and unease at having caused it. More so when he knew that the fear and worry were entirely justified and had harmed him earlier.
He did need to get Mycroft off his back, however. Or possibly even working with him, genuinely so, but that was possibly expecting miracles and although it was apparently the time of year for miracles, he preferred not to rely on them.
He paused to take another deep breath, one which a bit shakier, and carried on. “If you don’t want to stay, though, that’s entirely up you. I would never blame you. Whatever you want, I won’t stop you. Whatever it takes.”
Did that rankle just a little bit, too? That they were this easy to blow apart? No, that wasn’t it, because they weren’t. The way they’d handled all of this showed that, didn’t it? When Sherlock had his faculties back, he was trying to protect John at the same time as he was trying to keep him.
As he closed his eyes, he thought he heard the faintest and strangest of small noises, one which he couldn’t identify but which seemed to come from the dragon. Was it surprised at his action? Annoyed? Amused? Enraged? All of them? He couldn’t tell but whatever it was, he didn’t want to hang around to find out what the further reaction would be.
“You’d be going out of your mind within an hour or two at most,” he pointed out, though the effect was lost a little in his slightly breathless tone.
“If you do indeed know who John is, then you should also know that he is the last person who would try to harm her,” Sherlock snapped, recognising the hesitation for the protection it was and commending it, but also irked by the implication that his Omega would ever molest someone. “Or in any way interfere with her. Now
. The voice was quiet but clearly audible for that, giving away its proximity, and superiorly mocking in its tone.
The fact that he had John by his side in both the physical and the metaphorical sense didn’t just help centre him and lend him strength, though it unquestionably did that. It also…
He’d been tempted to rub it off on his trouser leg immediately and though he’d refrained from that, he was deliberately using that hand to hold his cigarette, the automatic folding of his hand obscuring the numbers.
But even Sherlock didn’t have that depth in both his eyes and voice, however much of a baritone it might be, something on the edge of awareness that spoke of things in dark recesses, caves and the bottoms of wells. Waiting to pull you in or down with it and never release you.
Just take the watch as an example. He’d reacted far more strongly to that than predicted, and he had kept the anger up afterwards, too.
Now, though, with Moriarty having made a move by kidnapping and shielding him, it was quite the different picture, and he could no longer afford to sit on the fence. If he didn’t do something, Moriarty would claim John and he’d become part of the spider’s web, whether he wanted to or not.
If that didn’t utterly incapsulate John, he didn’t know what did. All that he could think to add would be something like an asklepian and that ran the risk of being a bit too clear in design and on the nose, to boot. You didn’t try to tinker with perfection either, of course.
Apropos that, did – no. If they did know, it would have been taken off him. That or they’d have mocked them for it, with the Alpha thug’s gun pointing at both of them. Unless, of course, the dark-haired man had only just noticed and therefore intended to take it off John right now, which –!
Sherlock reminded himself to breathe and that said breathing ought to be calm so that he didn’t hyperventilate or otherwise embarrass himself.
To say that there was a very great risk that he’d be dropped, or the brunet would collapse with John on top of him. Neither scenario was appealing, obviously, and the likelihood of that happening should he attempt seemed assured. For crying out loud, the man was swaying where he stood.
Not just in this situation, either, though he would admit that it’d make locating the jealousy, should there be any, which he still wasn’t convinced of, far easier and more accurate, not to mention the rest of them.
John had been introduced to the owner of the building the day after he’d first arrived; Sherlock had more or less dragged him down the stairs to meet her shortly after they’d gotten dressed, explaining that she was renting to him with a considerable discount because he was a far quieter Alpha to rent to than most – and of course, he’d helped her with her Alpha husband, who was in jail.
The recriminations towards himself queued but couldn’t get through. Not in the clamour of panic and fear that battered through him at that.
“It’s a simple question, Mycroft. Have you seen my watch? I cannot find it anywhere, but I know it has come back to the flat after…after the pool. He tried to give it back to me and I didn’t take it but after he fell unconscious, I have no idea where it went.”
John turned his hands around underneath Sherlock’s, so that he could grab them. It was Sherlock who interlaced them, however, and it was the brunet, too, who tugged, gently, in an effort to help the other up.
“I do, and that wasn’t what I was saying. I was just pointing out the expediency of doing it the other way.”
might know what John’s friend wouldn’t, and because the blond had told him, not because of what he’d deduced, made him oddly a little happy.
There was no use beating around the bush at this point, was there? Not as if that normally stopped anyone, even him, but at the same time, it was no excuse not to allow it. Especially not when it wouldn’t help anyone, not even himself.
That particular phrasing was carefully chosen to mimic John’s. She likely wasn’t going to notice whether it was one or the other, but they would, and it was important that they got it right from the start when thinking and talking about it.
All of those counted as strong points that if Sherlock was given a chance, then he could do all that he needed to so that John didn’t need to fear for his safety or for his personhood.
“No, it does –!” John barely managed to stop himself before his voice rose again. Fuck’s sake, he just wanted to go to bed. He sighed heavily instead. “It doesn’t. He is scared that he will lose control, even though he…how do I convince him that control doesn’t need a vicelike iron-grip on the thing at all times? It was difficult enough to get him to agree to sleep just now, and I’m not sure he is in fact sleeping.”
At this point in the proceedings, he could hardly pull the plug on the operation. He had tried to specifically design the plan so that he could back out at any stage should he get cold feet or the various stopping points had reported an angry or otherwise negative John Watson when he came to visit them.
Firstly, he’d grown quite a few inches in the last year and now stood taller than most of the other pupils – to call them peers would indicate that he was at their level, which was a horrible thought – which made it significantly harder to remain unnoticed, much to his annoyance. Worse, a few other pupils seemed to have noticed, too. They certainly kept sending glances his way, which he didn’t understand. He wasn’t that gangly and ungainly.
The printed text seemed to be a page of details on some baby, which was being made ready for adoption after spending the first few weeks of its life in a children’s home. The date on the paper indicated that this wasn’t a recent event and some rather crucial details were missing, such as the exact date of birth, any name of a parent or whether it had been brought to the home or born there.
“Yeah, saw that one coming. You aren’t jealous of him romantically, that’s not what I’m saying. At least, not in the way you understand it. Romance, that is, though, come to think of it, jealousy, too.”
