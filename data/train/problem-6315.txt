“That could have been me,” Tony said truthfully, and there was a quiet tremble of hesitation in his voice that gave Steve pause. He blinked his eyes open, and despite the crazy headache that really insisted he not move, he looked up to try and understand Tony’s expression. To his surprise, all he found was genuine gratitude. “I mean it, Steve. Thank you.”
The donkey’s name turned out to be Clint. Clint had been a man, until he escaped the bed of a Woman more powerful than he had thought possible.
” Steve asked, as if this was a new terrifying trait for horses to have.
Tony frowned a little to himself. Steve was being too vague, and it was difficult to pinpoint where Steve’s fear came from. “Do you think I’ll judge you?”
” Tony muttered, and he shoved off of Bruce’s desk to toss the donuts and start putting his jacket back on. “Jane,” he reminded Bruce, who immediately winced in sympathy. “Dollars to donuts, he’s still wallowing. You’ll get the coffee?”
His body arches into each caress. He finds pleasure in giving pleasure as well. Steve is a giving lover, but also one who enjoys his own pleasures and blissfully and completely falls into them with unabashed enthusiasm. Knowing that Steve’s never done anything like this before, Tony’s especially careful. He explains how he’ll prepare Steve, asking him questions, getting permissions. As Steve’s legs fall apart, he pants open and wanting for Tony. It would be a power rush for anyone else to have Captain America under their thrall, but Tony sees it as a humbling moment. That Steve trusts him so completely, that they’ve come to this end instead of any other end – it prejudices Tony against ever wanting to hurt him, ever wanting to be hurt by him. It’s a dangerous path he’s trekking, and he knows it.
The water rushes around him, drowning out his calls, and pushing him farther away from where Tony went down. Frigid waters crest over him and he fights against the force to stay upright. He allows his body to fall into the current, trying to find a way to follow Tony.
“Everyone knows the blind guy is acting like a child,” Steve retorts and then cringes. When is he going to learn to watch his mouth.
Sam bowed his head; arms crossed over his chest. Tony did not like the judgement in the man’s eyes. “So the prodigal son returns. You drop him and then decide to come back?”
Darcy blows a bubble with her gum and nods. “Go on back. She’s waiting for you.” She winks at him as he rounds the counter and enters the main work area.
“I wanted to die.”
Still slightly angry and doubting his motives, Pepper closes her arms around herself as she studies the schedule. She pages through the different days, expanding out hours and closing down others. She makes a few changes, but generally accepts all his changes. “This is good, actually Steve. Really good.”
It’s exactly a week later when Tony announces that he needs to go to the doctor and that Steve has to assist him. Jarvis glares at Steve over the breakfast of croissant egg sandwiches he’s made (Steve hasn’t eaten this good since his mother died).
Steve follows Tony’s lead, he doesn’t have any choice and he clears his mind, sinks into the emotions, the heat, and promise of what Tony’s doing to his body. To have another man touch him thrills and scares him. He’s only touched himself, ever. The slightest touch by Tony causes him to groan.
“Tony?”
“Got it all?” Steve says.
Steve looks down at his own plate and frowns. The wait staff are standing in the wings. Tony will give his short speech first before they come and serve dinner. The sheer wealth in the room overshadows everything else and Steve is just a particle of sand amongst the diamonds. Rhodes is wrong – Steve shouldn’t stay. He should get up, leave. If he ends up back in New York, it will be with Asgardian comics, not with Tony. He just doesn’t fit in. He starts to stand, but Tony is speaking and something in his tone, captures Steve, keeps him perched between remaining and leaving.
“I don’t – I calculated it. Figured it out. Sure,” he says and recognizes the doubt in his own tone. “You pulled me out twice. We didn’t need the exit Door – not really.” That’s not true. Not if they wanted a fully successful mission. The exit Door needs to be used to pass through and lock Ultron – his essence away from the internet and humanity. The exit Door serves both as a passage and a cage. “Steve protected me while I did the calculations. The Hub wasn’t a virtual reality that had the same character as the rest. The rest of them were like a video game- setting, place-.” He gets nauseous, closes his eyes. He puts a hand over his face. “Crap.”
Steve stands up, his legs wobble a bit. Steadying his breathing, he looks Obie straight in the eyes and says, “Why don’t you ask the Agent what he wanted me to do for him?”
“He doesn’t,” Coulson said. “But he needs to, we need him.”
And Tony hates it. He wants Steven to like this – at least a little bit. Part of him understands nature and how it rules them, but he wonders how much has been layered on by nurture and the rule of law? He doesn’t wait for Steven to join him. Instead he steps over to him, grasps his arm, and then guides him to the bathroom.
“And you believe it?”
“It’s your father’s fault,” Steve replies.
Sam tweets twice behind him and Redwing flies past Bucky’s head to land on his master’s shoulder. Bucky peers over his shoulder to find out if Sam has any intel. The bird does a little bob or two and Sam holds up his open hand twice to Bucky. Sam gestures outward and Redwing squaws once and then takes off to perch in a tree not a dozen meters from their position. Sam taps his face and then points to the tree.
He stumbles to the beach, letting the waters crash against his ankles. He wonders if he could drown with the weight of his wings. Tony stops him, holds him back.
“We are not going to fit. We’re two grown ass men!” Tony stands his ground.
Tony brought his arms around Steve and held him close. The heat from his chest replaced the beat of a heart and filled Steve with such pain mixed with hope that he couldn’t parse his emotions, so the tears streaked down his cheeks. He knew what had happened to Tony. He’d witnessed it enough to understand the horror and the pain in the eyes of the vampires on the rooftop. He fumbled for Tony’s hand only to pull it away and stare at the scar that now shined with light. Steve had no words for its beauty other than otherworldly, supernatural energy. A celestial light embedded within Tony, so deep and enthralling that it must come from the stars, from the very depths of the cosmos.
The audience chuckles in response. Steve surveys the crowd, all high hitters, movers and shakers of industry and government. He notices that most of the invited attendees are the people reportedly known for their generosity and their philanthropic motivations. There aren’t many of the superficial showy ones here, the rich who donate to get accolades. These are the wealthy who care – most of them. Steve suspects that Pepper only includes some of the rest including Von Doom simply to milk them for their money. It is thousands per plate.
Steve glances at the cash scattered on the floor and then back at the drawing. He licks his lips before he answers, “He just wanted to help people. He never felt helpless though lots of people considered him helpless, weak.”
"Plan?" Steve scrapes the fork along the plate as he eats. His appetite back, along with his curiosity, he enjoys the food again. It's too good to waste.
“He already is,” Natasha says. “He’s willing.”
He flops over and crawls up to the pillows. Tony doesn’t deny there are tears in his eyes. The stress. He blames it on all of the stress. The tears turn into true weeping, but it’s quiet and dignified – if crying can ever be dignified. Why can’t he let himself love? Why did he keep Steve at arm’s length while all the time flirting and playing with him? How come he didn’t know his time with Steve might be abruptly cut off.
“Yeah,” Steve said and looked down at the papers. “People keep telling me that.” He glanced back up at Bruce. “Thank you, Bruce. I’ll keep in touch.”
“Ready?” Steve asks.
“A plan?”
“What do you say, Blu? What were you doing? Who were you looking for?” Tony whispered to the little toy. Maybe the lion wanted someone to help him. Maybe Tony could be that person. Maybe he could be someone’s hero.
“And that’s my point, you’re missing some numbers.”
“You want me to fix your nose?” Tony says as he sheds the armor. It’s a miracle to behold how it literally drops away into the small metal pouch on his chest.
“The serum makes him the Perfect Seed, right?” Bruce asks. Logan only nods in response. “But the question is how he is – the other Steve, the other Tony – linked to our Steve, and our Tony.”
“Stay with me, sunshine,” Tony whispered and then fell silent as the darkness swallowed Steve once again…
“That’s not the end of the story, but the coffee is in that one,” Steve says and points. “Give me a cup, please. So, how’d you get back here so soon? Did you have to go through all the rims? How’d you bring my backpack with you?”
Tony ties it off and Steve clicks at Shield. Hopefully, the horse is done being frightened and they can get across the river without incident. He draws the horses to the edge of the river, to the banks where the rocky shore falls into the mud. In the height of summer, passage over the river is more like jumping a stream since it dries out to a trickle. But as the rains come in September and load up the river, it grows and swells into a wide and meandering waterway. Schmidt intends to divert the water up in the mountains to use in his mines, but Steve’s still fighting that battle with the Territory’s governor Pierce.
“You remember when I hacked SHIELD all those years ago?” Tony says and chews a bit on his lower lip. He doesn’t wait for Steve to answer. He paces the length of the kitchen island. “Well, it kind of took a backseat for years after the whole Mandarin that wasn’t thing. I focused on my relationship with Pepper, but then me, being me, I couldn’t leave well enough alone when you, being you, went ahead and, you know, damaged D.C. and destroyed SHIELD in the process. Well, when that happened, I started to look into things, because I knew Howard, my dad, had dealings with SHIELD. He and your Peggy set SHIELD up after all.” He takes a deep breath. “Long story short, I found out about it and didn’t know how to tell you that your buddy was implicated in some pretty nasty stuff, including the death of my parents.”
“Hmm, what?” Steve says.
“This isn’t a Cinderella story, Steve.”
“Yeah we can have tea.” Tony grabs the kettle. “I’ll make it!” He fills the kettle and then goes to the cupboard he’s seen Steve retrieve some of their dry good. The only tea he finds is herbal. “Is this okay?”
“It’s nothing.”
She offers him that half knowing smile. “Now, I never said that.”
“I don’t know if I can do this,” Steve said again.
“Keep comms open,” Steve said. “I don’t want anyone armed. I want us to go in as a pack, as a family. This is one of our members who is upset.”
Steve swallows thickly and pours the soup into one small tin cup and moves it over to Tony. Steve drinks right from the pot. “Thank you, Tony. That means a lot.”
The doctors – all wide eyed and huddling together – nodded and scurried away from Steve, not looking at him as they escaped. He watched them go as Fury stalked off and Natasha helped Steve out of his bindings. She kept her eyes focused on unclipping the bindings and then stepped away as he stood up from the chair.
The neighbors.
“Visual.” Tony did say not to leave.
“Now don’t give me that shit,” Sam said. “We can all feel that you’re hiding from something. I just can’t figure out what.”
Searching, he scans the rapids, and the froth of the waves. Dead branches lead him astray several times; the snow flurrying around him diminishes his ability to see clearly. Any hope quickly dwindles and he starts to turn, using a powerful breast stroke toward the opposite shore and the horses as he loses his footing on the slippery rocks and sand beneath the surface. Even as he ducks toward shore, he sees it.
“Gee, thanks.” He forces himself back up and then starts a fire. The idea of skinning the animals grosses out Tony. “You can have them if you want. I’m not hungry.” His stomach rumbles just to be a dick and betray him. “Not that hungry.”
“We don’t play with it.”
Even with the hot water cascading over him, he still shook like he was standing outside in the chilled and sleeting rain. God, what a fuck up he’d become. He scrubbed at his face, cleaned his hair, his entire body. Once he was done, he turned off the faucets and pulled a towel from the rack. He stood there, in the marble shower with the towel pressed to his face. He pushed it into his eyes until stars burst. He wanted that reality or whatever the hell it was. He wanted it to be real – somehow. He wished for Steve to want him like that and not see him as some deviant or perversion of normal – whatever the hell normal was.
“But you love me as a sister, not as a lover or a wife. You can’t stop being Iron Man for me. You never could,” Pepper said. “And I can’t stop asking you to not be Iron Man. What does that mean to me? I can’t do this to you.”
“Just be quick,” Steve says, muffled by the swelling and the pain.
“Okay?” The steep descending slope would give the most skillful horseman a test; Steve worries about Tony. He’d like to lead the horses down but with the storm pounding and increasing in intensity, they don’t have that luxury.
“You, too, then. You’re keeping me awake with all that racket.” Pepper shifted away from his embrace, separating them. The cool air invaded the sheets and reminded him of the cold of space.
It doesn’t matter then what unspoken fear lurk, Steve’s bending down and Tony’s moving forward, closing the gap between them. The thud of Steve heart then turns to a distant din and the wash of the ocean not so far away floods over him. When their mouths brush a tingle of sensation and then a full-blown explosion of everything he’s denied in the past few weeks. How much he’s wanted this; how much he’s dreamed of it. It resolves into the moment.
Steve tightened his grasp. “You’re not the only one. I think about Bucky falling, about how he took up the shield and tried to protect me. What did he get for it? Seventy years of torture and being forced to be an assassin for Hydra. Hydra, an enemy we both fought. It was our mission.”
“I’m going to touch you, now.”
She nodded. “Yeah.”
He skims through the rest of the paragraph and ends up reading about alpha physiology.
“I asked what school you went to,” Tony snaps. He is an alpha, a prime alpha at that – he shouldn’t have to deal with such insolence. Even though they stand only meters apart, Tony feels the cold, the drift between them.
In an icy voice because he despises when someone tries too hard, too phony, too shallowly to show him deference, he says, “I’m obviously in the market for a suitable omega. What do you have?”
“Not really.” Steve barely remembers the conclusion of the novel. He read it when he was just a boy. “He’s in the arctic. I don’t know, Tony.”
Tony thinks the doctors won’t allow Steve out of the hospital bay but then he finds Steve in the kitchen the next morning, making coffee, a gloomy look casting shadows over his face.
“You’re suit is going to be trashed,” Steve warns as he touches the helmet to Tony’s hand. He accepts it with a smile. “White and motorcycles don’t really go together.”
Through the trauma’s haze, the bonds sang out to him from all of the team members of the pack. Rain poured down as Thor tried to stop him from his position above the fortress. There was no way for Thor to join them since Hydra forces still attacked and he kept them at bay. Part of Tony knew he needed to focus on the task at hand, but every wound leaking through the bonds from Barnes tore apart his soul.
It occurs to Steve as he scrubs the shampoo into his hair and uses his nails to clean away the grim that Mer Stane may be right. That thought jars him like a punch to the chest. What if the only way to get the disparate factions of the Conclave united would be to install someone like a king or leader? Steve never followed politics too closely but if he had to vote, he’d pick Tony. While he is one of the wealthiest Inners, Tony also happened to be one of the humblest. Having someone who believes he’s not the end all be all in charge might be the best way to go, the only way to go.
He scans the area – he swore Tony left it here, but Steve cut him off. Maybe he’d moved it to somewhere on the porch or near the picnic table or target or even in the house. His own arrogance would be his undoing.
When he looked up, he half hoped he would be back in his Tower, but he wasn’t. The low weeping broke the otherwise quietude of the ward. Tony inhaled, held it, and then walked toward the bed with Sara Rogers in it. Her son looked like wire bent at odd angles. Tony swore he could count every single vertebra sticking up through his too thin shirt.
“The pack has grown too large for him to completely control by himself. The pack has too many members that haven’t been unified within the whole. Your pack is in danger of failing. If it fails.” Strange stopped.
Steve toys with his food. “Then I’m grateful to him for taking care of you.”
“Happy is waiting outside with the car. The hospital policy says you have to take a wheelchair, but before they bring it in, I need you to do something for me,” Tony says. He pulls out a slim long jewelry box from his inner jacket pocket. “Please wear it.”
“Lot more money, more stability.”
“Yeah, my daughter loves the story,” Scott chimes in but Steve can’t see him. In fact he can’t see any of them anymore. “The one Prime and one Omega are destined for one another. Their fate is tied to the fate of the world. They’ve always been together. One generation after another.”
When Tony examined Natasha’s and Sam’s faces, he discovered the same dismay and discomfort there that holed up in his own soul.
Instead, he salutes the older man. “Be right there. I have to change out of my street clothes.”
“I am not subservient to you,” Steve says through clenched teeth; his hands opening and closing itching for that shield that he will never hold again.
Of course the Elders of Shield might want to off him, but he doubts it. They have their own little piece of the pie. They control a huge portion of the economy of the Council of Worlds.
When the horses rush down the narrow way, Steve crouches against the rocks as the wind through the cavern hits. Shield nearly hits Steve but he’s able to avoid a direct strike to the spine. It only hits his shoulder, and he huffs in response. Steve wants to get up and calm the horse, but it’s impossible in the small space. Shield nays and leaps downward toward the water – and Steve cringes, hoping his horse doesn’t break a leg as she catapults down the wicked way.
“Yeah. No idea why. It’s Soviet for sure.”
“I will, will I?” Steve asks as he climbs to his feet. He still has the cuff for the shield Tony made him.
His mouth is dry. His tongue feels like a wad of cotton in his mouth while his throat closes around barbed wire. He clears his throat; it does nothing. “I’ll have my stuff out by the end of the day, sir.” Pushing the chair back, Steve goes to stand but Tony grasps his hand.
“So, all we need to do is climb a mountain without any gear?” Steve asks.
“Don’t worry. That’s not metal fatigue. It’s the metal stretching. Adamantium does that as does vibranium. It allows ships to deal with the stress of different gravities without transferring it to the occupants.” Tony goes through a few final docking procedures before he adds, “It’s one of the reasons we’re at war with the Kree. One of their earliest incursions happened to be on a base rich with adamantium.”
Shaking off Tony’s negativity, Steve faced Bruce and said, “What do you want me to do?”
“From the dregs,” she mutters and then with a sharp gesture waves for him to lead the way.
Down.
“Maybe, I don’t know.” Steve shrugged. He’d spoken a little about this with Natasha, trying to feel his way around the issue. All of his friends accepted him. Why couldn’t he accept himself? “I mean, Bucky set me up all the time, but it never clicked. I blamed it on being small and sickly. Then I got – well – you know this. And I ended up on tour with the USO girls.” He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes. The explosion of light reminded him of the flash bulbs from all the cameras going off when he was on tour. He looked at Sam again. “I always felt like an idiot around those girls. Never really knew what to say.”
“Good. It’s a date,” Tony says and smooths a hand over Steve’s bare shoulder under his robe.
Tony turned his focus to the large picturesque windows where he could see the city and how it seemed to go on forever. “Yeah. I hoped it was just that stupid boyhood crush, but it isn’t. There’s a genuineness about Steve that it’s hard to find these days. We might not have shared life experiences, but we do- we do. In some convoluted way we do.”
“Well, I saw a motel, if you don’t mind a one star motel that is, a ways back,” Steve replies.
The training surprises Steve. Frigga leads them to a secluded spot behind the cottage. Vines form an archway with heavy flowers trailing along the branches. Frigga gestures for them to enter the small sanctuary. Some where in the distance Steve hears the gurgle of a stream or creek. This is the Soul Realm, none of this is real, he reminds himself, but at the same time he can’t help but feel the peacefulness of the small refuge.
“You bet it is,” she says and then reaches up and touches his face. She cups her hand on his cheek. “I can get you some pain meds, if you need them.”
The information pinged about in his head like an errant ball and he tried to catch it. “I don’t know what you mean. I’m sorry? I’m not human?” Steve recalled the story Tony told him, but he had a heartbeat. He was alive. They’d thrown out the term Divini. He knew Tony had given him blood to revive him, but all of the information went together as well as oil and water in his head. He couldn’t get anything to mix.
“Good evening, my prince.” Obie does a short bow and then his image dissipates.
“Yeah. In the garage. It’s an oldie of a goodie. Classic. 1942 Harley-Davidson WLA. Got some nice additions I designed myself.” He’s enjoying the reveal himself.
There’s not a lot of time, especially if Steve heard them talking, especially if Tony has worn out Raza’s patience.  Steve grabs parts of the armor and points to the staging area they’ve set up.
“No, I’m not moving on this one, Buck. We just settled down. This is a good town for us.” He shifts and tries to get off the cot, but Bucky pushes him back and sits on a stool next to the bed.
“I like to think of you as Captain.”
“Try it, just try it.” Steven’s eyes spark with rage. “I’ve learned one thing as your omega, and that is you, Tony Stark, are an ass. You pretend to be the enlightened elite, but when push comes to shove you enjoy your privilege along with the rest of the upper caste. I thought you would be different, that -.” He swallows the words back but it looks like he gulps down poison as he does. “I thought time would – I thought things would change. But you are just you. You aren’t anyone I ever wanted to know or be with. You aren’t who you pretend to be. You’re a demon.”
Tony bops his head as he picks through the salad. “Kind of. Dad had a palace on York-1, but I never liked it there. It was high up on the hill, no one else actually lived on the planet. It was like his little playground. Yet it had no one else around. My mother was terribly lonely there. She eventually had a new place built – this one – on Carbonelli. That’s the name of the planet. Also happened to be in her family’s name. I liked it here. More people around, less drunks.”
“I’m not
“Think about it, Stark,” Steve said as Bruce caught up to them, huffing and puffing out of breath. “Why haven’t we found Rumlow yet? How did he get away from us at the museum? Where is the only place Pierce’s surveillance doesn’t reach? And, where else will he find people desperate enough to overthrow New Yorseylvania?”
“You’re an editor. You can’t hear the difference?” Tony asked, and as angry as he was, there was a pitying weight to his words. “There is a difference between ‘give me another chance,’ and ‘could you give me another chance.’”
Steve laughed and whined on the same breath. “I’m still recovering, where’s your compassion?” he moaned, and he got no farther than the living room. He rolled into his big, blue velvet sofa like a well-dressed rag doll and waited for Tony to find him.
Still, Tony wouldn’t look up at him. Steve pressed a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s neck, letting his lips linger over Tony’s skin. “I care about
Stephanie huffed a quiet laugh and smacked Clint lightly upside the head. “I talked to Talia,” she said then, rushing to say everything she needed to say before dawn. “She has promised that you and Tony will be spared: you will be released, and allowed to go wherever you want to go. She will never bother you again. And, as soon as I can,” she promised, “I will keep the rest of my promise. I will peacefully unite men with the tribes.“
“A hundred percent?” Sam whistled to himself when Steve sat the canister down on the side table. “On all hormones? Man, that’s why you’re in the lead.”
“Is it though?” Bruce pointed out, tilting his head back to look up at Tony curiously. “You put it on pretty thick today. You think you’re gonna get a reaction out of him worth writing about if you keep going like this?”
“Sure, you’re welcome. Who’re you?”
“You okay?” he asked, absently pulling at the laces of his chosen boots.
“Maybe Justin can be that guy for you,” she said softly, “you won’t know unless you give him a chance. One date won’t hurt. We could even do a double—”
So when by chance their helicopters intercepted a small aircraft traveling to Machtberg at high speed, they took notice. After a failed attempt to make contact with the private passenger jet, the helicopters turned formation and opened fire. The jet was still too far to fall in the line of fire, but the hostile reception was enough for the plane to change its course and avoid Machtberg altogether.
“Nobody likes a naysayer, Barton,” Tony hissed in alarm, “you’re wasting valuable time and oxygen.”
“You get huffy and short-tempered when you’re sleep deprived, check,” Steve said with a teasing lilt in his voice. Tony could just feel the pleasant amusement radiating off of him even from the polite distance Steve kept, and if he didn’t know any better, he’d be convinced Steve’s charm was feeding off of his stamina like some predatory energy vacuum.
He could feel someone staring at him, and instinctively looked up at Steve again. Steve was watching him with such clear, focused intent that Tony was sure he was about to tell him something really important any second.
“You guess? Oh,” Steve realized just as he said it. “Your jet.”
Steve looked at the offered seat and back at Tony without moving.
But when Tony opened the door and the low thrum of noise suddenly turned into an excited ruckus, Steve’s guilt about leaving early evaporated. He was already grateful to leave. After the unnerving silence of a remote, rural farm, the sound of a drunk, excitable crowd packed into a small space hit him like a kick in the gut. If they stayed here ten minutes, it would be ten minutes too long.
,” Steve tried to explain in a perfectly reasonable tone of voice, but when Tony gave him a sly look and rocked his hips, Steve found himself breathless for more than one reason. “Why, is sex only a nighttime activity in your life? I wanted to take my time with you, undress you in daylight. Look at you, Tony,” he whispered, skimming his palms over Tony’s thighs to frame his hips. “Can you blame me?”
Steve closed his eyes and pretended not to pay attention, but without the sound of traffic or talking neighbors, there was nothing for him to hear but the sounds Tony made. Steve heard his careful footsteps and the shuffle of linens as he retrieved a spare blanket from the closet. With his eyes faithfully closed, Steve laid perfectly still and listened to Tony climbing into bed, clearly making every effort not to disturb Steve as he settled down to sleep.
With a great effort, Steve rose to his feet. His injuries prevented him from sprinting at top speed, but even at a fast jog, Steve zipped past most baseline humans. Through the impressed applause of his fellow officers who were comfortably lounging in the gardens with civilian bystanders, Steve ran after the criminal on foot with Tony sprinting after him, struggling to keep up.
..............That shouldn’t be as hot as it is.
“More than Helen Mirren?” Tony gasped in feigned shock, but he grinned back almost immediately, reaching for Steve’s hands and hauling himself up against the counterbalance of Steve’s weight.
Not two minutes later, Tony had shrugged out of his jackets and had stretched out face-down on the floor. Steve straddled Tony’s hips and splayed his hands open on either side of Tony’s spine. It was easier to crack Tony’s upper back first, so they agreed to begin there, and with a short, quick burst of pressure, Steve rocked forward.
“Steve, stop me if this is irresponsible for the sake of the case,” Tony said in a softer tone of voice that had Steve’s eager heart pumping blood in the wrong direction. “But if you’re interested, there is a scene in Overdue Ritual where I could use your help.”
feel with how he felt. A man he’d admired all of his adult life had traded sexual favors for drugs?
“Your repeated violation of the verbal morality statute in a public space is a danger to the emotional sanctity of women and children and therefore I am required to notify the New Yorseylvanian Police Department of your actions. Please remain patient for your reprimand.”
Two men were immobilized and he was grappling a third into submission when two jumped on him from behind. He was too heavy for them to control, but together they were able to free Steve’s captive until more of them arrived. For a moment, Steve almost rocked back on his heels to see dozens of these figures dressed in black rushing at the truck.
“Below the neck.”
“Tony?”
Steve fell in step beside him as Tony led the way, happy to just take in the sights and otherwise unbothered with where they ended up. He had never spent any time in London before, so he was happy to get any time roaming the city before the afternoon junket and TV spot later that night. He was taking in the fun shop signs and little specialty stores when he nearly walked into Tony.
“So what does it mean?” Steve said and moved to get out of the bed that seemed to double as an exam table. Tony stopped him but Shuri assured them it was fine. “You said the Divini are vampire’s next step, not a human’s?”
“No, no,” Steve hisses as the pain and heat rise. “The transformation stage, needs to be cooled. The final step.” He rocks into the bed, hiding his face. His wings feel like flames devour them. “Please, Tony, please. Went through several cycles before- at least they threw buckets of water at me. Please.”
“I need your opinion about Steve. I think- I think he left for some reason and I can’t figure out why,” Tony says.
Thank you all for reading this story. I will post the next chapter around July 8th. Sorry for the delay but I will be going out of town for the next few weekends with the family. I hope you enjoyed it...
“I know. Like I said I find it relaxing.”
In only a few minutes the door sweeps open and Happy enters. “Mer Rogers, you wanted to go and see Prince Anthony.”
Steve places a hand over his eyes and twists his mouth. “I do have feelings for you Tony.” He drops his hand; his eyes are glistening. Tony’s not sure if it’s tears or mania. “I remember things, places, events, times that aren’t real. Not for us. But that doesn’t mean I don’t know you. I saw you fly a nuke into a whole in the sky. It was a one-way trip. I saw that. I know who you are. You’re the guy who invented nanites to save the world, but you’re also that guy who thinks you can’t make a move on me because I’m too innocent even though I’ve been around the world with the guy you call a bear for a year.” He sighs, hard and heavy. “I know who you are, Tony. I came to be with you.”
“Not precisely. But I do know that this complex is a ruse, a maze with no way out.”
“You, a blacksmith. One of the richest men in the country wants to hang out in our little nowhere town and be our blacksmith?” Steve bites back anymore of the sarcasm. It’s dripping down the walls as it is.
“Yes? Where are the presentation rooms?” He wants to start and just get this over with. She reads him well but doesn’t question him. Instead, she leads him out of the room and they walk down a long hallway.
“Oh,” Steve said and squinted. “Oh.” The implications reached farther and wider than Steve could fathom. “I didn’t know I could do that.”
Releasing the log, he thrusts through the waves and tries to find Tony. A wall of water washes over him, forcing him down and he struggles to get back up to the surface, gurgling for air as he fights to get back to his search. Even though the water isn’t deep, it’s barely enough to swim in, the current is fierce like a mighty god throwing him around as if he is a doll. He spits out water before he calls for Tony again.
They took turns driving, never stopping for more than fuel and a quick bite to eat. Keeping to the back roads added a good six hours to their drive. Steve steered clear of asking Clint about his situation again. He didn’t want to accidentally bring up the idea that Natasha had ensnared him. Maybe Clint realized it and didn’t want to face it. It wasn’t Steve’s business. But then again, he circled back to his own situation with Tony.
“You gotta deal with this Tones. This isn’t right. You’re hating on yourself.”
JARVIS lifts the armor off the ground and sends it on a trajectory toward the designated hideaway. When he circles he sees several men come out of caves near the edge of the hilly crags. They have assault rifles and target him. Their aim is generally lousy and Tony picks them off easily – it’s almost sport and that turns Tony’s stomach and he tastes bile.
“Maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m just the soul or the astral projection of Tony. Do you think astral projections are confined by time and space? Maybe not, maybe I’m a Tony from the future.” Tony placed his hand on Steve’s bare chest. “Now, shh, I want to listen to your heart.”
Rumlow gawked at him like he’d grown a second head. His demeanor didn’t change. He never looked ashamed at the fact they held a human being as their prisoner. For experiments. For daily punishments. They called the man it: they called him by a freaking number. Next to him Tony heard Pepper chanting over and over again, “I don’t understand. I don’t understand…”
zings through his brain like an electric shock. He squeezes his eyes closed and tells himself to remember this feeling. He needs to translate stuff like this into his comic book. He’s great at art, but not so much at writing.
Often, a faraway look crossed over Steve’s features and seconds later he would excuse himself and disappear. Later Tony would find him staring blankly out into the middle distance. None of it made sense until now. Logan had said Steve was suffering from seizures. Tony missed it. How the fuck did he miss it?
“No, but he will,” Natasha said. She hesitated but stood up and lightly grasped his hand. “I don’t want to upset you. But things are different now with Tony. What he went through, what you went through, changes everything.”
Steve shivered in his chains, his body wanting to rebel. He swallowed compulsively. The taste of blood and bile mixed in his throat until he retched. Blood dribbled out of his mouth as he tried to hold his body still.
Tony’s low moan turned into a quiet, throaty laugh. He combed his fingers through Steve’s hair, then gave it a tug at the end to make him look up. “Is that what you want, Sparky? Want me to ride you like a bull? Turn you into a boneless mess?”
“I come with news, Tony Stark,” she said in a secretive undertone, and offered Tony a tablet where several crime scene photos were already pulled up. “A most egregious crime occurred right after dawn, sir. I thought you might want to be informed.”
at top volume.
For the US Men's National Soccer Team, qualifying for the 2022 World Cup was the easy part. They lost their Captain to a bad injury in a friendly against Uruguay, and now the best man to take on the armband is the only out player of the tournament. Tony is a sports journalist assigned to cover the US team through the tournament, but his first order of business in Qatar is stopping by Steve's room to clear the air.
“You can do it, you’ve seen me do it a dozen times,” Sam assured him in a gentling tone. “They flirt with everything, so don’t take anything personally. Especially 008,” he added with a tone of caution, because nobody was ever going to let Tony live that incident down. “I’ve seen 007 flirt with elevators, okay? So long as you never give in and slip them anything under the table, you’re fine. They’re predators: they will exploit any sign of weakness.”
Steve gave Tony a book of centuries old folk stories that his parents told him before bed when he was a young boy. In return, Tony gave him Dag Hammarskjöld’s
For reasons Steve couldn’t begin to guess at, Tony’s face had grown pale, and he fidgeted in his discomfort. He nodded in the affirmative.
The donkey blinked big, brown eyes at him. Human eyes. “I’ve eaten grass for seven days and eight nights,” he said. “You give me two turnips, and I’ll tell you anything.”
“No, you don’t.”
Tony snatched up his phone and turned his back to the mirror, giving himself enough distance to catch the top of his thighs in the photo so that Steve wouldn’t miss the full view of his ass in his navy blue tights. He snapped the first few as he tried to assess the right over-the shoulder angle. On impulse, he gathered a fistfull of his top and pushed it down over his crotch until the fabric clung to his back like a second skin. Pulling it down drew the attention down to his hips, and he spread his stance incrementally with a small arch in his back to really make Steve’s mouth water. With a sly smirk over his shoulder, he took the last picture through the mirror and sent it to Steve with a simple caption that read,
Then, just as quickly as she’d weighed and judged him with a look, she turned her attention to address the class.
He was thumbing through the bills in his wallet for a tip when there was a knock at his door.
Tony’s relief was twisted in his confusion, but before he had a chance to make further guesses, Steve carried him back to the machine where he lowered Tony down on a narrow padded bench. It was longer than it was wide, with just enough real estate to balance on, but as Steve adjusted the frame Tony was strapped down by his wrists and thighs that held him firmly in place.
“Oh, Tony—”
“Is it your first time dining with us, sir?” the valet asked with a kind smile. When Steve confirmed her suspicion, the young woman pointed to another woman in the same valet uniform red kimono. “Mina will help you, she has the list of all parties invited for the evening.”
“I, alone, am going to go to his lab and talk to him,” Steve said as calmly as he could. Except, his friends weren’t going to let him get away with it.
“Hey, buck up, handsome,” he said as he sat up straighter in his seat. “This is it. We’re here.”
Tony had found Steve’s bedside lamp and left that on as the only light in the room. Steve picked his way through the obstacle course that was his room, then crawled under the sheets where Tony was still awake, waiting for him. While the double bed was bigger than his twin back in their dorms, they shared it with a large stack of clothes Steve hadn’t known what to do with after his move. There were only so many free t-shirts and sweats a man could use in a lifetime. And what was he ever supposed to do with graduation robes? A Halloween costume?
“Tuesday has no right being this fucking long,” Tony huffed, but his argument deflated after that. He nuzzled in closer, resting his cheek on Steve’s shoulder.
There were too many bodies crowding around him, helping him and moving him. He wanted to reach for Steve, to hold his hand and to know he was safe, but the next time Tony opened his eyes, Steve was gone.
For a long, unbearable second, it was absolutely quiet.
“What’s wrong, darling?” Maria asked in genuine concern as she came over to check on them. Tony turned them enough to stop her from touching Steve, shaking his head in a silent bid for her to keep her hands to herself. Reluctantly, she stepped back, but she couldn’t help but repeat her question. “Talk to us, sweetheart, what’s the matter?”
“Tony, you’re sick. Would you let me out of the palace if it was me?”
Steve?
Steve was a model patient. He didn’t fuss, he did everything Tony asked him to, and even after the first week, Tony could comfort himself with Steve’s clear signs of improvement. Every day that passed, Tony left for work knowing Steve breathed more easily, and would come home in the afternoons to bigger, more brilliant smiles.
It wasn’t until weeks later in Berlin when Bucky broke down the door to the bathroom Steve had been in for too long that their staff caught on to them. There simply was no other way to explain why they were both in there, tangled in each other’s arms with their shirts undone and their pants around their knees. Bucky stood sentry at the broken door and made sure they were decent before allowing Tony back to his table.
“No way,” he heard a voice gasp at a distance, and Tony laughed.
Seconding this motion!
“…there is so much wrong with that statement,” Clint finally said, keeping his voice low since Steve already seemed agitated enough. “You realize that whether you’re a man or a Woman, and whether he agrees to the mating or not, he will never see the child? It will be the Chief’s daughter, or the Chief’s servant if he is a boy, until he is abandoned to the wild. But if you are a man, you could choose to be with him instead of with the Chief.”
“Mom!” he called, “mom?”
“We need help with our communication,” Tony started, and Steve turned to watch him talk and shift uneasily on the couch as calmly as he could manage.
“Stop right there, Steve,” his mom interrupted him again, this time more firmly. “No more calling it a compromise, and stop using ‘I’. Compromise means giving up on something. Think of your relationship as a collaboration: you’re building something new together with your partner. So, no more ‘I’: you need to talk to him,” Sarah added more gently. “You’re my son, baby. I will always be here. But this is between you and him.”
Only twenty hours separated Tony from his long-awaited race. Twenty hours before he pretended he could watch Steve hurtle (frankly alarming) weights in the hammer throw without getting hot under the collar. Twenty hours before Steve excitedly gorged himself on half a dozen pies alongside a handful of their nuttiest citizens. The first year Steve volunteered for the pie eating contest, Tony had wanted to cry. A monarch gorging himself
mad, it won’t exactly get any better but maybe it’ll be easier; actually, you know what? I can just leave—”
“Okay,” Tony said. He placed his tumbler filled with an amber liquid on the coffee table. “Let’s start. When Bruce taught me it was just kind of a chant. I talked with Strange a little too. He was unbearable and not helpful much at all.”
“God damn it! I’m right here. Where are you?” Tony yelled, and the words echoed back to him.
“Hmm. I’m not sure that would be advisable for you,” Steve says.
“Tell me. Tell me what to do,” Steve said. “I had these dreams, you know.” He spoke between kisses and licks. He traveled down Tony’s body, worshiping it. He nibbled at nipples and tongued them until Tony hitched his breath and arched with desire. “I had these dreams and we did so much. I want to do that now.”
“No. This is good.”
Before he scuttled away, Tony caught him and said, “I want you to know, I remember everything from the dreamscape. I know who you are. I meant what I said.”
“Yeah, yeah. Pepper updated me. That reporter is not letting go. She’s making a big stink about this gala and how it will show the real Tony Stark,” Rhodes says. “He has to be ready for this. So, what’s the problem? I mean he’s working on the upgrade, right?”
“It means that I need you to throw us a line,” Bruce said and then closed off Tony’s protests by focusing back on Steve again. “Let’s try this. Follow my lead.” He bobbed his shoulders up and down, as if he was loosening up before a big sporting event.
Lightly his fingers trace lines down Steve’s abdomen and he speaks in low tones. “I want this to be special Steve. If you only want to touch and explore then that’s fine with me. I don’t want you to feel pressured.”
A man in a purple shirt and tight leather pants greets him. He has a bow strapped to his back. “What can I do for you?”
“And what are your rates?” He’s curious to see what a rich man would regard as a fair price.
Moving on Tony, Steve cups his face in his hands and presses lips, tenderly and softly just in case he wants to move away. Tony startles at first but then relaxes into the kiss. His hands come up and scrap across the back of Steve’s neck. It sends thrills down his spine and he shivers. It’s enough to move him away from Tony to gaze into his eyes.
“Sometimes that woman defeats me. I don’t know how Thor grew up with her. Half of her words of wisdom are puzzles.”
He marches forward; the heat of the flames causing the sweat to drip down his face, run rivers down his chest and back. It’s hot, there’s no ventilation system in the armor. He blinks away the sweat. The heat of the torches burns bright, but he stays the course, yelling for Steve as he tramps through the twists and turns of the tunnel. He meets resistance, but easily and, without mercy, blows it away. Briefly he worries about the woman, Natasha, but quickly casts the concern aside. He only has one purpose – get Steve and get out.
The brush of Tony’s hot skin next to his, the taste of his tongue and mouth, the caress of callused hands down his flank shifted through Steve’s consciousness. Every moment of the dreams felt only seconds away as if he’d only just experienced them. “Some.”
“No need, Captain.”
The voice continues as the blurry face moves out of Tony’s line of sight. “I have some broth for you. It has a little some rice in it, believe it or not. Some kind of rice anyhow. I convinced them to give me some bread, too. It isn’t much, but I think if you eat it you might feel stronger.”
“Yes, sir.”
Ross barked out a laugh and clapped his hands. “You sound like a sympathizer, Captain. You’re a member of the V-Corps. You’re a leader here, and what I see and hear now makes me doubt your position.”
“O4 – your owner is talking to you!” Rumlow said.
Tony’s body quivers in the cold. His skin looks gray and hollowed out.  They need a fire fast. When they get to the one room cabin, Steve hops down from Shield and nearly topples over – his body is so cold it doesn’t listen to his commands.  He gets Shield to the side shed and unties the other horse, leaving him in the enclosure near the shed to feed. Luckily, Tony seems to have come to a little more sense of himself and he doesn’t fall off Shield as Steve unloads some of the supplies. When he returns he helps Tony down to the ground. Tony nearly goes to his knees but Steve stops him, guiding him to the door. The snow flurries around them – it is turning into snow showers now. The worst of the storm is nearly upon them.
“You won’t,” Steve says and clutches Tony’s shoulder, steering him out of the apartment and back into his tiny room.
“Yeah.” Steve cringes. “Sorry, it’s gross.”
“Things are. We’re a pack. A soul pack,” Tony emphasized it. “Being part of a pack that’s the Avengers has to count for something.”
“No, of course not, I wouldn’t want you to – if you don’t feel comfortable,” Tony says and he cannot help it, but it hurts. He deserves it, though, the way he must treat Steven – to train him to accept his place. He curses under his breath. “Perhaps, after our meeting today we might enjoy a dinner.”
“So the FLOTUS was the leader,” Tony said. “Interesting. Is there more?”
Clint shoves an arm in front of him to halt his progress. He stumbles and whizzes around to face his former navigator. “Nat sent me.”
“Yes, then. Okay.” Jarvis studies him like he’s a pinned insect under a dissecting microscope. “You see, Captain Rogers, you must pledge the same.” He waves away Steve’s response. “Yes, yes. He had you sign a non-disclosure form. He had you go ahead and sign the contract. But you must know the enormity of what’s happened. Master Tony doesn’t allow anyone to know of his state. Not for years.”
That brings a smile to Tony’s face. “Really? Captain America fainting?”
Sam cocked an eyebrow at Steve. “I know it’s not what your 40s mentality says should happen, but it’s what happened. It has to mean something.”
“We’d better head out. There's an old miner’s cabin across the river we can set down in before night fall.”
Division.
“Tony,” Steve says and puts his hands on his hips. “You have glasses in there, don’t you?”
It didn’t work. When he opened his eyes again, Steve glanced around, and he sat in the bed in the tenement’s bedroom. His chest was bare, and he hated to think about what he might be wearing – or not wearing- under the thin sheet laying over his legs. Tony stood to the side of the bed, thankfully donned sleeping pants but not much else. Steve glimpsed the arc reactor scar on his chest which wove into the brand from the soul mark. The scar became the focal point like the sun radiating out within the brand. Like Steve’s the brand covered his whole chest and down his torso.
He pauses the playback and frowns. Bucky would flip a lid if he knew what Steve signed up to be a whore. How many times did Bucky find him trying to sneak into recruitment centers and hack the computer systems to be accepted into the fleet? Too many to count. Bucky even told him to stay home, take care of the settlement, maybe flirt a little with Peggy.
He needs to focus on his work; the Peace Conference opens in three standard days. The attendees are already arriving and his plate is full ensuring their security and evaluating what will be the best way to get these disparate fractions talking to one another. Loosely tied together colonies and systems hasn’t worked. Steve’s spent an inordinate amount of time reading over the earliest and ancient histories of the revolutions on Earth. Trying to understand the psychology of the human race seems pointless and futile at times.
“Hm, Ton- my lord, I was Master of Security as Omega to the Carbonelli Family.”
“Oh that won’t be pleasant.”
The guy rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “At least one of you is sane.” He waves for Tony to follow him.
“I’m going to slip my fingers out now. I think you’re ready. Are you ready, sweet one? Are you?”
“I don’t know. You’re not even giving him the chance.”
Tony jolts and realizes he’s still standing at Steve’s hospital bedside. He hasn’t moved, but the nurse with the kindle is next to him, keeping him on his feet with one hand on his upper arm and another on his abdomen. He jerks away from her and focuses on Steve. She doesn’t react – thank god- but does step away. When he looks at Steve, nothing is amiss. In his mind he can still feel Steve’s touch, he can still experience every subtle beauty, but the echoes of horror whisper over the vision.
Tony smiles at him when he catches Steve’s stare. He reaches across the space between them. “We’re going to do this.”
Tony jerked out of his reverie and smiled. He stood up. He looked good. Strong. Whole. Ethereal. An otherness radiated from him like the corona of the sun. The aura was unmistakable, though it disappeared as Tony gathered himself and stepped over to Steve’s bedside. Closer, Steve studied the changes in his love. His eyes – the irises were gold flecked with reds. His hands and chest shimmered with a low light as if he held the flames of the dawn in the palms of his hands and within the cage of his breast.
Bruce rolls his eyes. “Don’t mess with me. Or Big Green. What were we just talking about? Steve spent the last year with his old flame, Logan. They went around the country, went around the world. They lived together in Japan. I literally just said this Tony. I mean are you listening to me? They were living the life, happily ever after until – well, who knows what happened.” Bruce’s brows furrow together. “Did you ever find out what happened?”
Tony hid away in his workshop and tried to pretend it didn’t matter to him at all. He felt the searching of Steve along the bonds, a slight prickle every night and every morning to check in and ensure he was okay. Most of the time he batted it away only to be left bereft of that minor touch. It had only been a few weeks. Steve would learn to leave him alone –eventually.
Steve doesn’t reply right away. Instead, the swirls of colors mesmerize him, and he centers himself. He lived many long lives. Now, he’s ready to rest. Looking at Tony, he sees the same wish in his eyes. Steve reaches out his hand. Tony grasps it.
For someone else.
“I’m you, Daddy!” Tony had said. The captain’s hat he’d stolen from Howard’s closet. It blocked part of his view as it slipped down his face and covered his eyes. He was only five years old and his father defined the moon and the stars for Tony. “Going to rescue Captain America!” He smiled and then took out a toy horn to toot it.
“What the bond actually is? Will we communicate through it? Or just feel each other as team mates? What is it?” Bruce maneuvered the broom under the lab bench and swept up the shattered glass.
The next day, Tony and Steve are scheduled to work on the codes again and test the upgrades. Yet, Tony hates the idea of being hidden away in the ground floor of the house for another long irritating day. When Steve meets him for breakfast, Tony smiles and says, “Do you want to play hooky today?”
“Yeah. Don’t worry. Go to sleep, old man.”
He finds Wanda and Vision in the kitchen, thankfully just working. He smiles at them and Vision starts to apologize but Steve raises his hand. “Let’s just say we don’t talk about it and hope it never happens again.”
“Yes, sir The serum will protect me.” Steve didn’t venture into the darker thoughts, the fears.
Nodding, he clasps the bowl and brings it to his lips, and it reminds him of a broth his mother made when he was sick as a boy – these forgotten images come unbidden to his mind. He sips the soup and it’s painful to swallow.
“No deal, Cap. It’s Natasha. And she knows a great deal about this soul pack stuff. It’s part of her job to know. I didn’t want to tell you this, but part of Natasha’s assignment includes keeping you and your pack safe. Not only from the outside, but from the inside.” Fury passed right over what exactly that meant; pursuit of the subject obviously off limits by his demeanor. “Plus, lucky for you, she brought in one of the world’s experts in soul packs.”
“There hasn’t be a proper kiss. So, I’m not really sure.” He looks at the kitchen. “Why don’t we have fries. I need fries.”
“No,” Tony said, and he sat up. “It doesn’t matter. Don’t you get it?” He yanked his hand away from Steve’s and that sliced into his heart. Tony pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes. When he dropped them, tears leaked down his cheeks and he did nothing to hide them. “It’s all a fucking mess.”
Strength, power. Running through its veins.
“You don’t get to do this. Not this. You’re cutting yourself away. Again. You can’t do this every time. I can’t be part of this without you.” Tony held on as if a tsunami battered them.
“So much wealth and so much suffering,” Steven said and Tony watched him as he hung his head and closed his eyes. “I never thought it would be like this. I hoped for better. I thought things would change.”
Tony sniffles and, for the first time, realizes he’s crying. He nods. “Yes.” The words barely get out. “Yes, it is.” The serum isn’t working for part of Steve’s body. It’s rejecting part of who Steve is. What the fuck does that mean? “It’s bad, Nat. Really bad.”
Clint tightened his mouth and nodded. “Give me a day or so, I can arrange it.”
Tony leans toward Steve. “Ana is Jarvis’ one and only. They love to travel so sometimes you’ll need to fill in for him. Not with the cooking and all, but with other duties.”
Love.
The argument is sound. Steve isn’t one to believe in fairy tales. He grew up in the Great Depression. “I know that.” But what does he feel about reality verses the fairy tale? His stomach knots and the idea of eating curdles. His throat thickens; he swallows compulsively.
If they do, Tony doesn't pursue it. “We’ll find a way to save him from the poison. I promise that.”
“JARVIS, can you give me a light?”
At this, Tony thins his lips in a tight line, then he snorts and drops his head. Pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes, his wet hair dripping onto the soft carpet of grass, Tony says, “Because I have dossiers.” He meets Steve’s gaze. “On all the Avengers. I have dossiers that contain everything I know about the team members, and probably a little I don’t know, not aware of that is.”
“The upgrade, you mean,” Tony chimes in. He hates it when they talk about him like he’s not in the room, he exponentially hates it when they make assumptions about his work without consulting him at all. “It’s the upgrade. The previous program only caused migraines. The upgrade probably initiated a catastrophic failure of the implant systems and therefore led to electrical discharge that ended with a seizure. Easy peasy.”
But the truth hurt. It tempted him. The truth. It asked him to believe in fairy tales. He didn’t start it, not knowingly. He didn’t even accept that he was doing it. But his hand like a teenager’s crept down to his flaccid penis and began a long slow stroke. He told himself he was doing it to see if he could get himself to respond. He worked it slow and easy. Lying to himself. Pretending he wasn’t thinking of the strings of his soul that were disconnected and needy, yearning. Telling himself that he didn’t think about broad shoulders and thick arms around him. Even as the thought materialized he grew hard. His breath gasped and he thrust into his hand. The calluses on his palms, on his fingertips sent sharp shivers through him and he played with it a little. Edging his one callus on his thumb along the tip of his erect cock, sliding a fingernail along the slit until he hissed in respond and felt a little precome spill out. He held back, letting the sweet anticipation and hunger eat away at him. He squeezed his cock, tormenting himself with need.
“What does that mean exactly?” Tony says and pulls the blankets off, sliding to the floor. He’s only wearing a tunic and nothing more. They spent the evening together. The scraps from the dinner they shared is still in the lounge area of the suite. No servant would dare enter the presentation suite while it is occupied.
Steven only shook his head. “Just listen. For once in your life, Tony, listen to me.”
Steve only shakes his head. “I don’t know about that- I know that I’m not allowed to be with you like this. I’m not allowed to touch you like this.” He strokes his hands down Tony’s chest, along the ridges of scar tissue to the tender muscles of his belly, and then to his groin. He licks his lips and then swallows as he touches Tony’s erection.  “I want to taste you, can I taste you, please?”
And so over the long days and through the summer to the winter, Tony promised himself not to look back, not to let the longing emptying out his core drag him down. Promises ended up only being broken wishes. How could the vacuous place inside him have weight? Like the gravity well of a black hole, it pulled him down and only the events of his life happening around him seemed to have any glimmer of light. He watched as if he was an outside observer as the ragged edges continued to unravel and sink into the depression of the hole inside of him. He pretended it didn’t matter. As he built and worked and discovered and invented, Tony Stark fooled himself that it didn’t matter that the events in New York became strangely distant and those people that were, for a moment, the most important in his life were only a dream or a figment of a yesteryear life. He faked that his trembling hands had nothing to do with the fears growing through him. Instead it was because of his drinking or not drinking – whichever it happened to be at that moment. He closed himself away from it all.
“The barn?” Tony screwed up his face.
“It?” Bruce asked.
“Hurry up, she’s not a woman to be dallied with,” Sam replied and then they heard him head back to the house.
“Eyes open,” the alpha says and continues to slowly thrust two of his thick fingers into Steve. “Easy, listen to my voice omega. You will listen.”
“No. No. It’s today,” Steve hisses at the end of his sentence. Before Tony can bark out any laughter at the unfortunate day Steve decided to make his entrance into the world, Steve rushes to say, “Really no big deal. The job, sir?” He points at the documents and, for all the world, looks like he might salivate to just sign them in his own blood.
The music continues in the background, the wistful Auld Lang Syne plays. It seems appropriate to Tony. His mother used to love this song, but he steps away from that memory in his head – he can’t think of her and his guilt that she died that night.
“Ma used to tell me all kinds of Irish stories from the old country,” Steve smiles as he thinks about her. “She was such a little woman but everyone in the neighborhood always listened to her. Kids would always say, Yes, ma’am. No, ma’am. Very respectful.”
“Surely, my lord.”
With renewed energy, Steve zeroes in on Tony and swims across the rapids. The water pulls and tugs, yanks and shoves. He nearly goes under twice and a downed tree branch bashes him in the side of the head, knocking him off course. It takes a moment for him to come back to himself, to blink away the pain. He clings to offending log as he tries to right himself, as his vision solidifies again, and he remembers that Tony is in dire straits.
“Thor?”
Steve halts his admiration of the bike. “What? Tony, what?”
As he’s weighing his next move, Stark, Banner, and a young woman enter the room from the other entrance through the parlor.
“Coming, yep that’s what you’ve done. A lot of it as I recall,” Tony said and slapped his knee. “You wanna kiss?” He made smoochie face at Steve.
“Wow, that’s a surprise.”
“Those open cars that anyone and everyone can see into?”
“Could you at least attend a session I set up with Strange and Wong? They’re coming to talk to us about the chaos of our pack and to help us order it.”
Steve starts to search for another condom but Tony strips him of his robe and he’s ass end up on the piano bare as the day he was born. Tony runs rough hands along the swell of Steve’s ass and then leans over him, supplying Steve with the weight he longs for. Most people are too careful with Steve, too considerate of his size when he wants to feel it, the physicality of being together.
Tony yawns. He cannot believe how much the seizure and the stupid meds took out of him. He still hasn’t eaten, and he has no appetite. He itches to have his glasses, to have Steve here, something to get work done, but at the same time the fatigue drains his drive to work. It’s a strange dichotomy that he had gotten used to after the traumatic brain injury but hasn’t had to deal with in many years.
“I don’t know, Anthony. People have lots of motives for what they do. I don’t think that Captain Rogers would have done it maliciously. Perhaps he felt guilt, or he felt that he couldn’t fill the role adequately.”
Desperate, Bucky latches onto him again. “Please, Steve, this guy – he’s famous. Word gets out even out here in the boonies. I don’t want happening to you, what happened in that place.”
Before the woman answers, she sizes them up. Her breathing huffs and her footsteps are heavy on the broken hard wood floors. “Look like you ran away from a wedding. He the groom?”
“That was months ago, years ago really,” Tony jumped in. He hated to think about getting rejected. Talking about it was off the table.
“He’s been better, but that doctor of Mister Stark’s been by to see him. He’s stronger and that’s good.” She pats the quilt. “Now, off with you, I need to finish up my stitching on this other one I’m sewing.”
Steve looks straight ahead, watching the twinkling lights of the insects in the branches of the trees.
“Why? Why tell me this now?”
“And you are cruel and indecent to a blind man.”
“It kind of was for a lot of my life.” Probably still is, but Steve keeps mum about that little fact. Pre-empting Tony’s analysis of the sonnet’s meaning, he jumps in and says, “You let the cat out of the bag with that one, didn’t you? Now I know you secretly want to have sex in public.”
He surrenders to it.
Steven licked his lips. His voice came out soft but wanting. “Yes.” The last sound lingered. A soft s.
Tony’s never known Strange to be tender. He’s one of those brilliant doctors that has the worst bedside manners but at the same time he trusts implicitly. Now, Strange shows his softer side and Tony doesn’t know if he should rail against it, or accept the kindness at face value. “I’ve been fighting this for a long time, Strange. It’s in my nature.”
The dawning of her warning came to him late and he figured it was because he was so numb from everything that happened. When he went to find her again, he couldn’t and no one could tell him who she was. No one but T’Challa who only laughed and said that he’d spoken to the ghost of the founder of the Dora Milaje. Steve wanted to find out more, to discover what she meant and why she said it. He might not believe she was a phantom but her words still haunted him. Of course, everything went off the rails when he realized he was approaching heat.
“Does it matter?” Pep says. “Do you want him to love you or to be loyal to you?” Pep stops and then adds, “From what I’ve learned, what the society says love between an alpha and an omega is doomed. Loyalty is what you’re after.”
“Captain?” Steve asks and then sees the military pants he’s wearing – and nothing else.
“Oh,” Tony says. He wants to say – when did we start counting? The day Steve returned to the Tower? The next day? When they went out the first time. Tony clamps his mouth shut.
Tony liked Sam more and more each day. Mister Wizard frowned at Sam’s characterization and Tony loved it.
Fear rolls over him. He hasn’t felt this terrified since he saw Tony gunned down, since he watched Tony blow off Bucky’s arm. He grabs the edge of the sink and rides through the agony of terror. Closing his eyes, he tries to center himself. This is the right thing to do. Clear away the problem, the issue. How can two alphas fight over him if he’s not an omega anymore? Steve knows that Tony can see himself clear of what Hydra did to Bucky and possibly even forgive him for his parents’ death. But the battle between the two for dominance over Steve, for possession of Steve as their omega warrior… This is the only way out of that mess.  For everyone concerned. He inhales deeply, exhales. He tries not to remember, but how can he not? How can he not remember the anger and the frustration and the sorrow all mixed into one horrible barbed ball in his gut?
“I just,” he tried to explain, though he failed to find words that could be both honest and respectful of Tony’s past. “I don’t get it.”
“What—
“God bless you, boy,” Maria grinned down at him, giving him his glass of water and ruffling his hair. Like he was just another kid in the house.
Tony thought about it. He stared at the beige-colored food on the flat stone he used as a plate, and he wondered just how bad it would be to be as dead as that water-snake instead. What did the water-snake have to worry about anymore, in the grand scheme of things?
A Nobel laureate.
Steve visibly bit down on a smug smirk, then prompted Tony along. “And you made me a…”
He hadn’t experienced hunger since his Captain Abs-for-days training began, and it was a bitter irony to miss the feeling of hunger. Anything, but the constant feeling that you had eaten too much.
“Really?” Steve asked after a beat, and Tony might have enjoyed the look of naked confusion on his otherwise composed, professional face, but he found he genuinely liked the question.
Steve might have said something embarrassing - like
Tony looked up, surprised, but smiling to see the younger officer. Fortunately, Bruce wasn’t there yet to witness Jane’s unusual show of immaturity. Tony was still getting himself settled in for the day at his desk, and he gestured for Jane to come in between starting up his computer terminal and organizing his pencils.
“And why would I do that?”
“That’s something only rich people say.”
“You,” Tony whispered, clearly a little surprised. “We’re doing brunch tomorrow, you won’t… won’t you get ...you know. Get tired?”
Tony didn’t ask if he was still in touch with his friends and neighbors, because for many, it was impossible to know. Some had been forcibly relocated by the war, some had been injured and withdrawn from their former lives. Many others simply didn’t survive.
“My medical records, my tax returns. Banner’s grandma’s family recipe for the best homemade pizza dough that even I can make. Really important and personal information, Steve,” Tony finally admitted, lying through his teeth. Sure, those things
“As do you,” Steve replied, then after some thought found it to be true. They fell into a companionable silence after that, making their way to the theater arm in arm.
“It sounds like things are going well, then, so… can we assume these rumors that you’re engaged might be real?” Stephen prompted mildly, and Tony’s grin softened into a private smile, which he smoothly covered with a smiling facade.
They talked briefly about the possibility of bringing a decorator in to re-do the bedroom until they came to the front doors of the building where a car and driver were already waiting to take Steve to the airport.
“So long as she doesn’t scare you into putting any clothes on,” Tony half-joked, and found himself endlessly relieved when Steve genuinely smiled back at him. He pressed a little kiss to Steve’s shoulder before shuffling out of bed to see what his mom had gotten for him.
A creature not unlike Steve was the first to approach, and all Tony could process at the time was his gratitude that it was humanoid and reasonably handsome like Steve, and not something spikey or insane. There was even a gloss to his skin that Tony silently envied. He watched over his shoulder as the creature and Steve both pulled cards from their respective pockets and touched them for a second before getting on with business.
Tony was so lost in the hypothetical paradise Steve was painting for him that he took a wrong turn somewhere. He was quiet for a while, thinking over Steve’s words a few times before leaning back and giving him a weird look. “Brooklyn—your
“Did he have any defensive wounds?” Steve asked as he decided underwear were overrated and pulled on his jeans anyway.
“I thought I heard your voice,” Tony said as if recalling some wistful dream with an exaggerated air of nostalgia. “I couldn’t hear what you were saying, but I could tell that you missed me. So, naturally, I took the day, hopped in my car, and drove all the way to Brooklyn to surprise you and the kids.”
“It’s engraved,” Hawley observed, a little taken aback.
“I want to fuck you, Tony,” Steve said softly against Tony’s lips, a touch more seriously than before. “But if you’re tired, if you’re sore—”
As soon as the warriors were out of sight, Clint turned to Tony with a frown. “So, what was it about my plan you didn’t like? I thought it was pretty good, myself.”
He whipped around as it occurred to him how they had arrived to Lumine.
“Hey, hey sweetheart?” Steve tried in a low, gentle voice, trying to soothe Tony’s minor outrage despite the quiet laugh still lifting his voice. “Something is warming in the oven for you. Why don’t we take a look?”
“Stop—stop that, Steve! Steve, lie down!” Tony told him through the laughter, pushing Steve back into his sweet, fluffy nest and tucking him back into his cocoon. “Cotton candy is magical, yes, but you need to rest, okay?”
“I’ll pass your message on to him,” Tony said after a beat. “Steve Rogers, right?”
Steve couldn’t go rogue, he just couldn’t. Pissed as he was, the thought of one double-oh pitted against another made Tony want to tie Steve down and never let him leave. He wasn’t ready to give up the privilege of shouting at Steve for being an asshole yet.
From the far back, Steve 2.0 Odinson gave them a wink and a big thumbs up. Steve and Bucky muttered ‘got it’ when they meant ‘suck a bag of dicks’ and marched out of the conference room occupied by the FBI before Hammer changed his mind.
“Mein Schafes, you’re not leaving this bed,” Steve told him in a steady, patient tone.
Steve smiled back at him, but left it at that. He had work to do. His phone was already ringing in his hand as he made his way out of Caffe Italia and turned in the direction of the nearest tube station.
“Tomorrow?” Tony eventually asked in a whisper. “Or, uh. Saturday?”
“Sweetheart?” Steve whispered, cupping Tony’s cheek to gently encourage him to meet Steve’s eyes. “Sweetheart, look at me. I couldn’t care less about the shirt. Is something going on with your committee?” Steve guessed suddenly, frowning at the possibility. “What hoops are they making you—”
“I have fire in my loins!” Bruce shouted back in his own defense, and all Tony could do in for the next ninety seconds was regret his relative sobriety.
Steve pressed closer as he chased Tony’s lips for another kiss, this one more eager than the first. When they eventually parted, Steve could only nod his head in agreement.
Steve took a slow, steadying breath that seemed to have no effect on his heightened stress level.
Clark picked out another band-aid and with careful, patient hands got his son’s finger wrapped up.
From behind him, he heard Steve whisper, “Tony?” but all that mattered was that he sounded untroubled and unharmed. Tony spun low, sweeping another Scrap off his feet, spun around to palm-fist him in the nose, then leaping to his feet to leave that Scrap to splutter and weep in his blood before attacking the next. Knee to the liver, punch to the throat, fingers in the eyes, and by the time he turned to take on the next Scrap, the Scraps were backing away from him.
Steve didn’t budge. “If only one of us gets caught, the other can still write the story!”
“Your Majesty,” the chopper pilot said a few minutes into their journey, speaking at a comfortable volume thanks to the Starktech noise insulation of their headsets. “The attack targeted the adjoining library and police station in Lumine. Ninety-two injured and fifty-seven fatalities, including one pilot. General Ira Arionne has personally relayed messages ahead of us to inform His Majesty, King Anthony, of Your Majesty’s arrival. All he has been able to share with me is that His Majesty, King Anthony, and the Iron Legion are currently serving as part of the relief and are unavailable for comment. Edelfrau Potts has been reached and awaits Your Majesty at camp.”
“Same difference,” Tony sniffed before taking a long sip of his drink to hide his horrendously pleased smirk.
“He is real,” Tony interjected firmly, clasping his hands behind his back before anyone noticed how his fingers curled into agitated fists. “Captain America is legendary, but he is no legend. He is flesh and blood, a mortal man like you and me. He is currently in Cryo, where he is serving 10 consecutive lifetimes for involuntary manslaughter he most regrettably was responsible for in the events leading to his capture of Brock Rumlow. However,” he added as concerned murmurs spread around the room, “there is no man better suited to apprehending this vile criminal. Chief, it is within your power to reinstate the good Captain. We cannot overlook this advantage, sir. I implore you to give Captain America a chance.”
For the first time that morning, shame washed over Steve’s back like ice-cold rain. In a voice smaller than he’d ever felt, he whispered, “What?”
With his arms casually crossed in front of him, Brock watched as another car pulled up and two more cops stepped out with two more batons.
“You thought it was okay if I shared my problems with you when I needed help, but you couldn’t do the same for me,” Steve finished for him. “That’s what you’re saying, Tony.”
Polpetto = "Meatball" (affectionately)
His intentions did not go unnoticed. By the second throw, Tony made a point to twist in his seat when possible to meet Steve’s wide-eyed, hungry gaze. His hips undulated with enviable ease, elegant and strong. Every time Tony rolled his body forward, he rose in his seat to follow through with this whole body, until his back bowed in a smooth backbend. Every time the bull spun so Tony faced away, Steve threw the bull back to personally indulge in seeing Tony’s firm, round ass rise and flex as he squeezed his thighs around the girth of the rearing bull.
“Sorry! Shit, sorry,” Tony rushed to say while Bruce plastered himself to Tony’s back and giggled madly into his shoulder. “It’s only water, it shouldn’t stain or—damn,” he muttered when he couldn’t even find a packet of tissues in his jacket pockets. “I’m sorry, man.”
“I fear how easily you inspire me,” Tony muttered petulantly. “You make it seem effortless. And now the world knows my pain… you are impossible to resist. Finish your job, make Coulson happy. Then come back home, my love. Come back, and I will be a most grateful husband.”
Maybe I just miss you
“Bed bugs have penis spears!”
Tony’s frown of concern started to look more like confusion, and Steve allowed himself a quiet breath of relief. He could work with confusion.
Steve couldn’t think—he could hardly
They’d intentionally tried to maintain the everyday norms of their relationship even in the White House. Much of it had been an easy transition, but some change was inevitable. Before Tony became the 46th President to move into the Residence, Steve coveted the role of big spoon. Back then, the idea that one of the wealthiest, most intelligent men on the planet deferred to him for anything was overwhelming and deeply romantic. That was a responsibility he thought he couldn’t live without, being the man who Tony Stark trusted to keep him safe and cherished through the night.
Steve led them to the top of the marble stairs where Tony could get a full view of the villa with its classic symmetric design to his right, and the clear, peaceful pool to his left. If he said anything those first few minutes, Tony didn’t hear him. All he could think about was the house and how the new perspective showed the gardens behind it stretching out into the treeline of the park beyond. It was a mansion, a sprawling, timeless country estate, but part of its charm was how little it interfered with the beauty of the world around it. In the distance the ocean reached out past the trees, dark, endless, and full of mysterious life, a stark contrast to the sun-warm water in the pool that was so clear Tony could make out every glass tile in the vibrant blue-green mosaic lining the sides and bottom.
“Ha ha,” Steve muttered dryly. “Joke all you like, but you wish your lunch was that tasty.”
Tony’s mom’s words pulled Steve from the safe space he had only just discovered, and he braced himself before turning to face her with a smile. He was ready to offer some polite greeting, some appropriate comment about her beautiful home, but whatever he had meant to say fell away.
The question caught Steve by surprise. He hadn’t seen Bucky in over two decades; who was to say Bucky even wanted to see him?
Steve scrubbed his hands over his face, then with a heavy sigh he raised his gaze to look Tony in his eyes. He looked so tired. “It’s just work, one of my clients. She’s an exceptional scientist, a leader in her field, but no-one has gotten her to do any kind of promotion for her work—it screws with our marketing, and this is our first manuscript with her. If she doesn’t get good sales, a second manuscript would be a liability, and that’s—her work is great, I don’t want to lose her as a client.”
Tony stared at the woman he’d been fighting for quite a while who now lay across the floor boards like soiled laundry. His legs ached and his body was bruised; he may have several fractured bones, and someone had pulled on his hair really hard—
“Tony?” he murmured, pushing himself up. He rubbed at his chest, pressing the heel of his palm against the mounting pressure choking him.
“Trust me and enjoy the scenery for twenty more minutes, Tony. Please? We can fight in thirty minutes, but we’ll be there in twenty.”
“Steve, I love you so much I’m living in Boston. In
what to tell him, which meant Tony wasn’t likely to hear the truth yet again. Quickly, he got to his feet and returned to fix them tea; he couldn't stand to see that calculating look on Steve’s face again. Every time he brought up the ring Steve either evaded or gave him a general answer, and Tony couldn’t take it anymore. Who was so important to Steve that he always had to keep their ring warm against his skin? Nothing was that precious to Tony except for Steve’s old dog tags; he never left the house without them. Was there anything of Tony’s that was even half as important to Steve as that insufferable ring?
“A little louder, please, I don’t think the Prime Minister heard you,” Steve muttered. “Look, I don’t have anything against Harry Potter, Tony, I just don’t want to spend our two and a half hours in the city stopping off at movie locations. We’re in one of the most historic and exciting cities in the world, there is so much else we could be spending our time doing.”
Tony snickered quietly, but he didn’t bother answering. Instead, he reached to fix Clint’s tie. “There,” he said when he’d smoothed it out and slid it into place. “I hope Laura at least knows how to tie a tie.”
The first thing she did was to run into Tony’s cell and to see how he was.
Tony eyed the detonators and random bits of recovered tech. The lunatic behind the bombings was responsible for nearly turning his Steve into a statistic. They should have brought it all to Tony from the start, nothing would satisfy him more than personally nailing the bastard.
There was a momentary interruption to the otherwise smooth operation, and without anything in front of him to sign, Tony Stark looked up. Steve tried to keep a cool head about him, but he couldn’t quite get the words out.
Steve put his phone away once he sent his last message, happy to avoid the whirlwind of Tony’s last minute guessing spree. He pulled his boots on, then straightened to adjust his thong.
“‘As a wedding present to Captain America and Iron Man, stand up to bullies. Stand up for freedom. Captain’s orders.’”
“Tony is safe,” Jim promised. He didn’t only sound calm, he gentled his tone as if he had anticipated Steve’s distress. “The palace is secure, Steve. I’m calling to tell you Tony is resting. I assigned Natasha to him until you return.”
Either way, Steve couldn’t wait to hear everything. More importantly, Steve couldn’t wait to get his hands on Tony and tell him how wonderful these surprises were, and show him how much Steve appreciated Tony’s efforts to be his attentive and doting partner from thousands of miles away.
Eleven years in the business, and Steve was still making rookie mistakes. Did he communicate openly about his insecurities? No. Did he reach out for help from friends and trusted allies? No.
Steve skidded to a halt when he heard the elevator ping from a distance. Bucky was retreating to their apartment.
He could have sworn he recognized the green eyes staring back at him.
The Cryo-Prison parking structure was unusually empty for a Monday afternoon, and Bruce tried not to think about the senseless MDK of Dr. Helen Cho in the same structure that they had collectively witnessed from the station.
Steve’s assurance never failed to calm Tony’s worst fears. They had had this conversation many times before, and Tony had heard variations of the same answer so many times he could practically recite Steve’s answer from memory. But whatever the reason - the light from sunset reaching their kitchen just right, Steve’s crossed arms in his unbuttoned Henley - the ring around Steve’s neck caught the light just right and caught his attention.
“Alright, alright, no need to get nasty, Romanov,” Sam muttered, but he folded in a heartbeat. “So what’re you after, man? You wanna know the spots he’s been wanting to try, or just the food he loves so you can get some good reservations?”
Soon, every breath Tony could spare slipped away in short, gusting moans. A strong hand pushed against his right thigh, spreading his legs further apart, while another scraped insistent, blunt fingernails down his upper thigh, the first hint of Steve’s desire. Between his rough hands, and the fleeting tickle of the silk robe brushing over his skin, Tony shuddered and groaned into Steve’s mouth, and when Steve wrapped one hand around Tony’s hard cock to stroke him, firm and fast, through his briefs, the contrast of his touch to his tender, languid kisses had Tony’s eyes rolling back with pleasure and whimpering with need.
All the way in LA, Tony snickered to himself knowingly, and hearing his gentle laugh soothed the last of Steve’s fears.
“If ever I doubted you were your father’s son,” they heard her muttering from the kitchen, and Tony immediately made a beeline for her voice. “You’d think the sun rises every morning just to hear your voice.”
Steve swallowed quietly, but nodded. “Yes, ma’am.”
The first year Steve’s interest in the festival had taken Tony completely by surprise. There was nothing Steve didn’t want to try; from the caber toss and hammer throw, to single handedly taking on an entire class of elementary students in tug o’ war, he participated in everything. When he went as far as to volunteer them for the three-legged race, Tony openly balked. Walking in a crowd of thousands with bare minimum security was already shocking, but to let someone tie his leg to his fiance’s to run-hop-squirm against each other in public?
“I’m your housewife,” Steve murmured, his wet lips brushing over Tony’s bare skin as he spoke, though comparing himself to a housewife didn’t seem to bother him much.
It wasn’t long before law felt less like a foreign language and more like a puzzle with its four corners stitched together. All Steve had to do was take his time and fill in the middle, one jigsaw piece at a time.

For all the years he had been told never to go further than a handshake with a commoner, high-fiving the ten year old who had nearly dropped and then immediately caught his hot chocolate had been indescribable. Three young women had showed him the right way to eat a Trdelník without spilling, and it was a minor miracle his Steve had not come home with a sugar crash for all the rum hot cocoa he was drinking. But they had made it home without incident, and nothing worse than armfuls of presents and gift bags to carry back to the palace. Or, more specifically, for Bucky to carry back to the palace.
Now that stupid smile and that stupid face were on a weekend lock-down trying to get a group presentation put together for some dumb communications class. Tony had holed up in his workshop Friday through Saturday until he hit a wall, and even after an hour at the gym, he still felt bored and restless.
H sent him packing with a single mission directive: bring Scorpius down, by any means necessary.
please say more.
were never meant to be part of it.
“Why did you do that, I can’t believe you did—” Tony was sobbing into his shoulder in peals of breathless laughter as they stumbled along towards the exit on four legs that threatened to tangle together with every step. But instead of releasing Tony and letting them walk like grown, adult men, Steve only squeezed Tony closer and snickered shamelessly against his temple while Tony continued to deal with his momentary shock of incredulity.
Even with Steve’s help, Tony’s body only lasted two days before he felt the agony of desperation.
This time Steve immediately stopped them. Unlike his nipples, Tony’s come was valuable. Tony was still catching his breath and trying to pull himself together when Steve carried him away from the excitable masters and lifted him up onto the platform. The cushions were inviting and reminded Tony so much of their home that he immediately felt comforted, and he settled on his hands and knees patiently while Steve handled the contraption. Whatever Tony might have expected of the machine in front of him, he hadn’t been prepared for it to fold into itself gracefully and disappear into the platform.
Between one roll of Tony’s hips and the next, Steve slid a slippery wet cock sleeve over the length of Tony’s cock. That pulsing, wet suction on his cock was the final straw. From his neck to his toes he could feel his muscles seizing, his ass squeezing down on the canister and thrusting wildly into the heavenly suction of the cock sleeve. Long seconds passed before the student dislodged the canister in Tony’s ass and pulled it free from Tony’s limp, worn-out body.
“I will give you some time to collect yourself, Tony,” Dr. Odinson said in his low, soothing rumble, before turning to Steve. “You have already said that this is your first serious relationship, Steve. You care enough about Tony to attend couples therapy. Could you tell me what it is about Tony that made you interested in pursuing a relationship?”
“I hate him,” Bucky decided, just as Steve’s phone rang.
“I know, I know,” Steve said as he led the way out to the kitchen and checked on the pizza. It wasn’t ready yet, but instead of asking his dad to put his heat vision to use, he let it keep cooking at normal speed and made his way to the fridge instead. “Beer?”
“I said less complaining more—”
Tony would have been grateful for anything: a supply closet, a meeting place for naughty librarians, or a holding cell for the dimwits who never pay their library fines. Instead, he found a man and
So he would be the first of the pets exposed. The girls didn’t look away as Steve guided Tony out from under his arm to face the other masters. Without a word of warning, Steve undid the toggles down the back of Tony’s robe, Tony’s only item of clothing, and stripped him where he stood.
Steve had only meant to briefly thank the volunteers, but instead he spent hours with them, thanking the local volunteers and helping to receive their donations while patiently answering the same questions over and over again. He didn’t know much, nobody did, but he could promise that their people’s security was their priority.
letting Bucky forget about this, ever.
“You’re right, it will be different,” Tony admitted softly, scraping his blunt nails slowly up and down the curve of his neck. “But may I introduce a different frame? Just for the sake of argument?”
It wasn’t until Steve finally pushed his way to the front that he understood.
Tony pursed his lips in frustration, glanced down at his own shoes for some time. When he looked up at Dr. Odinson again, he quietly said, “My ex. Eight years ago.”
Steve took Tony by the hand and led him to northern wing of the palace where the main kitchens were. It was too late in the day for the kitchen staff to be in attendance, but after enough clanging around, a handful of the nighttime household staff joined them to help Steve raid the pantry and find the tools he needed.
“Alright, looks like there’s a tie here, guys, so it’s going to go to the tie breaker. Do you think you’re ready?”
“Answer the phone, please,” Steve said, doing his best to sound reasonably patient. The muffed noise grew a little louder, and Steve could imagine Tony digging through his bag for the phone. He didn’t give Tony a chance to interrupt. “There were two packages left at our office and now there’s a crazy person on the phone threatening the building with something he’s calling long-range electric detonators, do you know about them?”
A little collective of third-graders came charging around the corner and ran straight for their teacher, crowding around his legs and beaming with such excitement that they were fit to burst at the seams.
omFG if this is what it sounds like HOW COULD HE NOT TELL US HWAT HAPPENED
“Where’s that rat bastard?” Sam announced to the public at large in the bar, some of whom had paused what they were doing to peek at the thirty-some odd men who filed in to hover and glower. “I will smack the white privilege out of that boy.”
As the alcohol had faded from his system the night before, so had Tony’s insecurities about their relationship. This morning, brunch had been a laid back, unhurried affair, an opportunity to indulge. They had very quickly become the obnoxious couple who could enjoy each other’s quiet company as easily as they could fold into passionate arguments about the use of modern CGI and green screen, or the pros and cons of having a global food basket that gives some access to fresh strawberries every day of the year, while others can’t afford to eat local crops.
“But,” Stephanie continued, albeit uncomfortably. “She wants me to bear her a child as soon as possible, a daughter. She suggested I consider one of you as the man, but she has accepted that I will only ask you and give you the choice. If you do not wish to make me with child, you will be released and be free, unharmed.”
penises!”
“Hey, Mr. Rogers!”
“A fire in Albuquerque,” Clark answered from the balcony through the closed doors and across the living room, because he heard everything. He patted at himself then, and Steve’s enhanced sight allowed him to see how the soot and charred ash came off his suit in thick little clouds. By some minor miracle his dad had avoided the bright red and blue of his favorite uniform and worn one of his black suits, one without a cape and with a silver family crest on his chest.
“Does Preston’s account keep a record of his matches?” Bucky wondered, “or maybe their conversations?”
Tony was just beginning to question his own priorities in life for leaving Steve’s skin perfectly unblemished when a quick flash from the TV screen reflected in the gold ring dangling on a chain around Steve’s neck.
Steve kept his thoughts to himself, and instead tried to focus on Tony in the moment. With the advantage of the warm water around them to help Tony’s body relax, Steve smoothed his hands down Tony’s back more firmly, rubbing gentle circles down his spine. Even with a superficial touch, Steve could feel the knots of tension all across Tony’s back, and especially over his mid to lower back from the constant strain of sitting at his desk.
Bundled up as he was, Steve couldn’t see much of Tony besides the thick, dark brown hair, and a small glimpse of his face where he had stuck his nose out from between the blankets to breathe. How similar they were to their targets, Steve mused to himself as he concentrated his efforts into warming up the space around them. While he waited, he tore open a fresh pack of protective gloves and rolled them down over his hands with care. If he played it right, this one would be a walk in the park.
“I did,” he said eventually. “I do.”
Tony already knew that look. It was Steve’s argumentative face, which he was brazenly (though probably not successfully) trying to resist. Except, the sun was already getting high, and the last thing Tony needed was to leave the hard labor for the hottest hours of the day.
“I don’t like where this is going,” Steve observed, to Bucky’s obvious disappointment.
“Well, aren’t you efficient? Tax dollars at work here, clearly. Odinson, be a dear and take that, it looks heavy. Oh, didn’t see that coming, didya?” he smirked at Steve while gesturing at the enormous, muscular blond instructed to carry away the box with all their evidence. “I got one bigger and better. It’s been a pleasure, gentlemen.”
My only lingering frustration with Portugal design choices so far is that whole mess of tearing up the stunning cobblestones in Porto's big square and replacing it all with asphalt. ASPHALT. What were you thinking, assholes?
“Listen. I’m not your captain, I’m not sweet on you like she is. I don’t sugarcoat the truth for your innocent little ears. It’s been two days and you’ve got nothing to show for it. That, boys, is what we at the FBI call a classic dead-end situation.”
Steve frowned to himself, giving Tony a skeptical look. “She’s insecure? She has four PhDs.”
The moment Steve gave his name to the spa greeter he was whisked away to a private lounge and invited to every fruit, tea, and drink imaginable. Another young woman came to talk to him and see if he had any concerns or preferences they should be aware of, and it was only then that Steve learned that Tony had arranged their most indulgent package for him. This wasn’t a facial or a massage like usual, but a three hour face and body treatment and four hand massage. Steve hadn’t known what to say, and to her credit, the young woman met his stumped expression with genuine amusement. Even in his shock Steve recognized that being blindsided by an anti-aging treatment sounded ungrateful, but by the time they led him away and he was half asleep on a wide set heated massage table, Steve couldn’t remember what part of it was upsetting. Hell, he couldn’t even remember the last time he had a massage of any kind, let alone one with two therapists that lasted three hours.
He felt more than heard Steve’s soft chuckle, and he nestled in closer. Tony might as well be asleep on his feet, but he was no fool - he wasn’t letting any of this go to waste. After all, Tony had insisted on a schedule that got them back to the Residence for the night just for this: to be with his husband and recharge in his company.
“I was just,” Tony said instead, searching for words, “surprised. Is this—are you alright with this?”
“Love where your head’s at,” Tony had to point out, “but that’s only—”
All this time that he’d been so stubbornly against marriage, Steve silently kept his ring. He had wanted to marry him, but he’d respected Tony’s decision - Steve had denied himself something that clearly meant a lot to him out of respect for Tony’s opinion, and here Tony had strong-armed him into sharing something private and sensitive out of misdirected jealousy.
“Yes!” Tony cried with the ecstasy of a man who had been reminded of his will to live. After 276 minutes of shitty, repetitive conversations, that was arguably the most satisfying sentence Tony had heard in the history of his thirty-year-old life. In the history
Tony was snooping through Steve’s bathroom when Thor finally picked up the phone.
“Where else would I be?” Tony wondered, but he seemed more concerned with pulling down the blankets closest to Steve than hearing an answer to his rhetorical question. “Come on, Sparky, get in. Are you going to make me beg?”
“Then my dad said,” Steve continued more quietly, nuzzling into Tony’s hair. “‘What’s he going to do with a ring? Get him something he can use.’”
“About that, ma, I need to tell you something,” he told her as the tension in her arms eased into a gentle, rocking hug. “It’s good news and bad news.”
“For the record,” Steve murmured softly, sarcastic at first but soon gentling his voice. “Even if I was into that, you’re the one I can’t stop thinking about, Tony. Not Thor, or anyone else.”
With a quick pivot and a firm push, Steve switched their positions so that he would stand between Tony and the oncoming threat. The thundering sound of feet rolled towards them through, casting against the tunnel walls echoing and surrounding them until Tony was sure it was his own heartbeat rattling in his ears drowning out the world.
“Just because it’s unfair doesn’t mean it’s not also unreasonable,” Tony pointed out. “Besides my books, the longest interaction you’ve had with me has been about three homicides. It’s not exactly the classic recipe for ...well, for anything.”
Steve wanted Tony in a way he had never imagined wanting someone else. He felt like he could fly. He was in love, he was so happy in love, but dear god. His mother had been right.
Steve scoffed in the middle of nuzzling Violet’s forehead as she tried to hide against his cheek. “What a silly little man he is, Violet, don’t you think?” he cooed at her, only audible thanks to the microphone clipped to his shirt. “He is, isn’t he? I wish I spoke French, it is a beautiful language, but nope, he is a silly, silly goose. I only speak English.”
“I care deeply for you, and I have only ever been faithful, but do not call this a relationship,” Steve told him, lowering his voice as a counterpoint to Tony’s visceral anger. “A relationship has potential, a future. We can’t marry, Tony. I would abdicate in a heartbeat if it was that easy.”
Despite the obvious interest pressing against Tony’s inner thigh and the blush coloring Steve’s cheeks, Steve still had the gall to smirk up at Tony like he held all the cards. “Oh, wow… you’ll let me play with your treasure chest?”
