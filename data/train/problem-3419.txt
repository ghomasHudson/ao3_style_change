“Strange. This is the same slide we left off the first time,” Cas mused. He clicked over to the first image Dean had seen, of him about to stab the monster of the day, whatever it was.
“The shift will go much easer if all the opening preparations are done beforehand,” Castiel reminded her.
“I wouldn’t beat yourself up too badly for the misconception,” Castiel said. “You had no way of knowing that Jimmy had a twin. It would be more logical to assume that he was simply having a bad day if he was a little less friendly than I have been.”
Monday afternoon, Dean was late again. As the minutes ticked by, Sam got more and more nervous. What if Dean had said something really stupid and Castiel had punched him again? What if he was lying unconscious somewhere and bleeding out?
He waited until Dean was enjoying his after dinner pie so Dean would have comfort food to cushion the blow. “I still don’t think Castiel meant you to take the whole thing this well. I’ve never heard anyone say ‘eat a bag of dicks’ and mean it as a compliment.”
“I understand,” Castiel said. “You have nice nips.” He made an awkward attempt at a wink and then looked to Dean for approval.
“Don’t worry so much, Sammy. I’ll tell him how much I enjoyed the dicks when I see him Monday and clear things up. Now are you going to quit motherhenning me or are you actually going to finish your pie?”
“Very.” Sam took a moment to look at them, with their flushed cheeks and stupid grins. He was happy to see them happy. “Okay, you two have fun and be safe. I don’t want to hear any details tomorrow.”
Dean was still confused and a little angry about whatever game Jimmy was playing, but he found he couldn’t resist the earnestness in those bright blue eyes. Damn his good looks.
“Yes way. And lucky for you, he just so happens to be gay. So you’ll get to date someone just as pretty as I am, but in the gay version.” Jimmy was practically beaming.
“Hell yeah. Man after my own heart. It’s a shame I’ve had sex before so you can’t pop my cherry, but there’s plenty of things I haven’t tried yet and I want to try them all with you.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. It wasn’t like he could tell, with the red flannel shirt tied around his waist. “What does it matter anyway, Meg? He’s a client and we treat all clients with the same respect, regardless of their appearance.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Yes, he looks very athletic. But there’s something a little wrong with you if you enjoyed getting punched. I’m kind of concerned you’re antagonizing Castiel on purpose.”
Dean swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry. “I, uh...you haven’t finished your first presentation yet. Might want to get through talking about my body before we move on to the rest of it.”
“He’s a lot less scary than he looks. It’s all resting bitch face.” But Dean’s smile faltered just a little.
“I’ll get out of your hair.” He backed away, almost stumbling over his own feet in his haste to escape.
Castiel was impressed. “You’ve done your research, Mr. Winchester. Lucifer has a clean bill of health. I hope you’ll bring him back next year for his yearly check-up, but if any issues arise before then, don’t hesitate to call.”
Becky was a great receptionist in most respects. She was friendly and enthusiastic. The clients loved her. But she tended to focus on unimportant details so sometimes instead of noting what species of pet or what ailment the animal was suffering, she left notes about what kind of person the owner was or what color the creature’s coat was.
John nodded and took another bite of his pork. “You’re free to go, boys. Work quick, Sam. Dean will probably need your help with his homework after.”
He actually had to duck down to fit through the door. Not because he was extremely tall. He was just over average height. But his dark spiky hair was done up into a huge mohawk.
The man standing in front of him was almost a mirror image of Jimmy. Same dark, scruffy hair, same bright blue eyes, same height, same muscular build. Hell, they were even wearing the same clothes.
Castiel peered at the picture on Dean’s phone. “Oh yes,” he said. “That’s a very good size for a rabbit.” The cage was nice and spacious with three different levels with ramps leading up to each one. At the bottom floor was a large feeding trough filled to the brim with hay. Next to it was a very small bowl of pellets. A few inches down, a water bottle was attached to the cage. It all looked very good.
Milton Family Veterinary Clinic was a small family practice. Castiel and his brothers had inherited it from their parents. Castiel specialized in mammals, Gabriel handled reptiles and amphibians, and Balthazar worked with birds. The practice was doing okay for itself. They had also inherited their parents’ loyal customer base when they retired, but they weren’t established enough to begin attracting many new clients.
Dean blinked in surprise. It was a picture of him sitting on a plastic chair at some kind of party. He was obviously very drunk in the picture. He had a beer bottle in one hand, his shirt rucked up to his neck, and a cheesy smirk on his face.
Sam rarely saw his brother this happy so he felt bad about being the voice of reason, but someone had to be.
”- “-one is Dean. They’re from America!”, she explained and now Castiel’s gaze fell on the brothers. When their eyes met, Dean’s mouth went dry. How could one’s eyes be
Now freshly cleaned he went back to the kitchen and his stomach growled even more at the smell. Sam was standing at the stove and was currently frying something. As he heard his brother’s steps he turned around and grinned. “Hey. I thought you might be hungry so I figured to cook you some burgers. You know. To not scare you away.”, he said mockingly and turned back to the deliciously smelling patties. Dean’s face lit up and he started to grin. “Awesome! I’m starving!”, he said and planted himself at the small table on the wall opposite of the stove. The kitchen was small, smaller than most kitchens Dean had ever seen, but to be fair, it was an apartment and not a white-picket-fence-house like in America. The brothers chatted casually while Sam was finishing the burgers, catching up on their lives each in Kansas and Germany. Dean told Sam about the one time he pissed Bobby off when one of his female visitors was strolling around naked in the house which made Sam laugh. In return Sam told him about his new life here in Berlin, how the school was going and of his friends. Dean was surprised and relieved to hear his little brother has adjusted so well. When Sam put the plate with a steaming hot burger in front of Dean, he dug in right away ignoring the mocking commentary of his brother that he really should take care of his cholesterol levels. “Dude, this is so good!”, Dean sighed with a full mouth which earned an exasperated look from Sam who’d stacked his burger with a ridiculous sum of vegetables. He finished his burger within a few minutes, making himself another one, despite the accusing looks he got from his younger brother. Dean had missed Sam’s cooking just too much and he wouldn’t waste the opportunity.
wasn't awake enough for. Sam laughed and he heard the door close. The steps neared the kitchen so Dean raised his head, trying to seem as the tough cool older brother he'd hoped Sam had painted him as. A smaller guy with nearly as long hair as Sam's and mischievous amber eyes entered the room, followed by his younger brother. The guy, Gabriel, grinned and waved at Dean. "Hiya, older brother of Sam! Hope that coffee is helping.", he said, pointing at Dean's still half full mug. Sam sighed behind him and sent Dean an apologetic look. The older Winchester just raised his eyebrows at Gabriel. "Dude, you need to lower your voice. It's still morning.", he grumbled, already being irritated by the attitude of that guy. Gabriel laughed and then clapped in his hands. "Well, are you both ready or do we need to wait for that princess to finish his coffee?", He said grinning which earned a warning look from Sam and a glare from Dean. He gulped down his coffee ignoring the burn in his throat and stood up. "C' mon, let's go.", he said, looking at the other two men expectantly. Despite Gabriel's annoying demands for some candy the brothers grabbed their bags and left the flat. When they exited the House Gabriel led them to a mini-bus which looked relatively new, but Dean could see that Gabriel didn't exactly take care of the car. It had smudges and some scratches and if Dean were the owner he'd already be working on it. As they walked to the bus Dean noticed two women standing beside it, apparently waiting for them. Typical Sammy. He's exactly the guy who'd be a woman's best friend, exchanging hair products or something.
His whole body was frozen, tensed, anxiety-filled, as he sat in this too new car, listening to Kansas, all alone. He never realized how big Baby actually was, how much space there was. It felt strange not to have Sam sitting next to him, pouting about Dean‘s choice of music, Cas in the back, squinting at Dean as he didn‘t get the reference.
Dean grinned broadly and pat Sam’s back as he nodded. “I could use a shower. Feelin’ really greasy after that flight.” Sam snorted in reply. “I can smell that, Dean.”, he said in a teasing tone as they walked towards the exit. Dean threw back his head and stared at his brother increduously. “Excuse me?!”, he said and they continued bickering the whole way to the subway. Dean didn’t even really notice much of his surroundings as he was much too focused on the sight of his brother.
After dinner they cleaned up the kitchen and moved to the living room to sit on the couch with a refreshing beer. Sam tried to teach him a bit German, but all Dean could manage was “Hello” and “Thanks”, despite Sam’s best efforts. “Dude, you really need to know a bit when you want to move around here.”,Sam said frustrated and Dean rolled his eyes. “Why do I need to learn it when you’re around anyway?”, he replied to which Sam didn’t find a logical answer. Dean marked this as one of the rare triumphs in his mental book and grinned. Sam scoffed and took another sip from his beer. Then he suddenly straightened himself and cleared his throat, looking at Dean. “You know, I forgot to ask you something.”, he began and Dean turned his head to look at this lanky brother in interest. “Well, I told you about some of my friends. You remember Gabriel? His parents have a second house at the Baltic Sea and he invited us all to spend a week there. You wanna come? They wont mind.”, Sam asked and his eyes went all big. Dean smiled at the typical puppy look only his brother excelled at. “Sure, man. I mean, a week? At the sea? Why do you even ask? Besides, I’m curious to meet your friends. I mean, that Jess girl you told me about? You sure there isn’t anything going on?”, he replied in a teasing tone, laughing as a blush crept over Sam’s cheeks. The younger cleared his throat before nodding. “Okay, then I’ll tell Gabriel. Actually, we wanted to depart soon - maybe day after tomorrow? We’re all on summer break anyway so we’re flexible.” - “Sure, man. You can show me around here then first!” Dean felt excitement about the plans now. First he’d discover an European capital with his favourite person in the world and then he’d get to see the sea for the first time close. He’d even meet Sammy’s friends! To be honest, he was quite curious about them, wanting to know if they are good enough for Sammy (which, to be fair, is quite an unreachable standard). They continued talking until late in the night. At some point around 3 am Sam kept yawning constantly and rubbing his eyes so Dean shooed him off to bed.
For a while they watched the dark waves crashing on the shore in comfortable silence. Dean couldn’t stop thinking about their previous short conversation and something inside him was curious about the guy sitting next to him.  After a while Dean cleared his throat and turned to Castiel. “So, Cas. What’s the deal with this house? Your brother hasn’t really said anything about it yet.”, he asked, watching the other’s reaction closely. He noticed how Castiel’s body froze and a frown wiped off the solemn look on his pretty face. “It is complicated.”, Castiel muttered. “Hey, you don’t have to answer that. That was a stupid question anyway.”, Dean immediately replied, feeling a bit guilty though he couldn’t exactly why. He didn’t even know the dude. “No, it’s alright, Dean. I understand why Gabriel hasn’t said anything. My family is not exactly something we are proud of.”, Castiel replied and turned to Dean, looking at him intently with a tint of sadness in his eyes. “My family is among the higher political ranks in the GDR. We moved here from Russia when I was a small child.”, he began and Dean nodded slowly. So that’s where his strange yet not unpleasant accent came from. Castiel didn’t lift his gaze from Dean and continued. “The reason my siblings and I speak English so well - My parents insisted we learn the language in order to become successful politicians.”. He furrowed his eyebrows as if he internally cringed at the thought. Dean couldn’t blame him. His family didn’t sound exactly like a perfect apple-pie family. “This house is actually theirs. They bought it for vacation but during my childhood it usually stood empty. After I graduated I decided to move in and live here. My parents weren’t exactly happy with it but decided to leave me alone.”, Castiel finished and Dean could see the tension falling from his shoulders. “Sucks, dude. But you made something really nice out of the place.”, Dean said, pointing at the terrace and the beautiful view to the sea. Cas began to smile and nodded. The moonlight was reflected in his eyes and made them shimmer. ”Yes. I like it here. It’s quiet.”, he only said. Not exactly knowing what to say to that, Dean just nodded and returned the smile, not tearing his gaze away from the silvery- blue eyes. He didn’t know how long they’ve been looking at each other when Cas turned and looked back to the sea, still with a smile on his face.
He had on a bright yellow t-shirt for some band Castiel had never heard of. Over that was  a studded black leather jacket with patches sewn onto it. Most of the patches were too small for Castiel to read, but the big one on his back proclaimed “It’s called anarchy, asshole.”
Jimmy snorted and the corners of his eyes crinkled with mirth. It was a beautiful sight. Jimmy sometimes seemed so serious and getting him to smile took a lot of effort. But Dean loved the big, gummy smiles he coaxed out of him every so often.
“Damn,” Jimmy said with an appreciative whistle. “You didn’t tell me that. You’ve been holding out on me, Winchester.”
The man flashed Becky a charming smile and a wink as he signed himself in on the clipboard. His eyes slid over to Castiel, but Castiel quickly made himself busy rummaging around in his lunch pail until the man’s footsteps had faded to a safe distance.
“God no,” Dean said with a laugh. “I told you I was never taking another physics class in my life and I’m a man of my word.”
“And what is this?” he asked. On the top level was a tiny round disk that looked like it was attached to the floor of the cage.
“Hey, eyes on the road,” Sam snapped. He held the bag tightly to his chest. “You can take a closer look once we’re parked.”
“Don’t worry. Your secret’s safe with me,” Dean said with a wink. “I’m sure if Sammy was actually my twin, I’d be making him take all the classes I hate too. Kid’s a freaking genius.”
“You have to just go for it sometimes. This way I’ll know for sure how he feels about me because there’s no way you could misinterpret that kind of advance.”
Castiel cleared his throat. “Let’s have a look at Lucifer then. Can you get him out of the carrier for me?”
And of course, Dean didn’t want to talk about it and he didn’t want Sam speaking up on his behalf. The last time Sam had pointed out John’s obvious favoritism, John had just laughed and mocked Dean the rest of the day for needing his little brother to fight his battles. And Dean had gotten mad at Sam, not John. It was a little sad. Even after all the shit John put him through, Dean still cared about his opinion.
Yes, they advertised that they treated exotic pets. But exotic was a veterinary term for pets that weren’t dogs or cats. It didn’t mean they treated every animal out there. Gabriel had already had to turn away a woman who wanted him to treat an octopus and Castiel had had to explain to a panicked vacationer that no, he was not an expert on deer and couldn’t tell him over the phone if the deer he had struck with his car was fatally injured.
“Ha, joke’s on them. This is far from the worst thing someone’s caught me doing.” He nudged Sam in the ribs. “This is what you’re freaking out about? It’s just a goofy picture.”
“I do not know,” Castiel said. “This photo was given to me by one of your friends. They said it would be effective blackmail material.”
“Thank you for your input,” Castiel said wearily. But he clutched the card a little tighter in his hands.
Sam rolled his eyes. “You’re disgusting. If this is your idea of flirting, I can see why he had to tell you to get lost in a card.”
Jimmy leaned across the table, his eyes narrowed. “I take my duties as the older brother very seriously. If you’re all talk and no substance, if this is all a meaningless surface-level attraction, if you break Castiel’s heart…” He made a slicing motion across his throat. “I have ways of making you disappear.”
With a squeal of the brakes, the car came to a stop on the side of the road. “There. We’re parked. Now gimme.” Dean held out his hands impatiently.
“Thanks for seeing me so early,” Charlie panted. “I was walking Dorothy and Gilda near the river and I ran across this little guy. He’s caught in fishing wire. I’d untangle him myself but the hook’s into his shoulder.”
Immediately the image changed to one of Dean after a hunt, covered in the blood and guts of some monster. But it had to have been an easy hunt because the Dean in the picture was grinning widely, an arm slung around Sam’s shoulder and even Sam was smiling a little.
“I still can’t believe I ever thought you two were both the same person,” Dean said. “You both have separate personalities. You don’t talk the same, you don’t have the same mannerisms. Hell, you two don’t even have the same experiences. I’m such an idiot.”
“Course not. I’m also a great ass and a hot bod,” Dean said with a teasing smile. “But hey, you could always do a written presentation on how charming and hilarious and totally sexy I am.”
“Well, maybe I’d tell you more personal things if you’d stop calling me by my last name,” Dean shot back.
“Let’s take a look.” Castiel said. He pulled on his thick anti-bite gloves and carefully lifted the lid.
He really didn’t want to have to take the bus, but he had a lot of homework and he couldn’t wait around forever.
Dean had never told Sam what the fight was about so it was probably over something stupid and trivial that gotten blown out of proportion.
It was usually a lot less traumatic for the animal if their own human removed them instead of a stranger reaching in for them.
Castiel was not a morning person. Unfortunately, there were certain days he had to be at the clinic by the ungodly hour of seven a.m. So he dragged himself out of bed, grabbed a cup of extra strong coffee and shrugged on his white lab coat
“Well, thanks anyway I suppose,” Charlie said. She clutched the box tightly to her chest and trudged out the door, her head down and shoulders slumped.
“Yup,” Dean said proudly. He fished his phone out of his back pocket and tapped at it. “Sammy and I put it together over a weekend.”
“Oh yes, I know Bones. He’s a very healthy and happy dog. Your brother and his wife are doing excellent with his care. I’ll make sure I apply the ten dollar referral credit to their account.”
“Fine. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Sam tugged his arm out of Dean’s grasp and headed in the direction of his bedroom.
“Okay, so maybe they have a few similarities. But Cas is a good guy. He’s not an annoying jokester asshole like his brother. I’m sure it’s just a very awkward attempt to tell me he knows I like dick and he likes dick too. He’d never do anything to be hurtful on purpose.”
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel took Dean’s hand in his and gazed into his eyes earnestly. “Your penis is perfectly proportionate.”
Reluctantly, Dean found himself talking about his stupid classes. How he couldn’t wait to get to his junior year when he would be taking all upper division classes in his major and no more boring general ed.
“Holy shit. I’ve had seven classes with Castiel.” He stared at Castiel, silently reevaluating all the interactions he had thought he had with Jimmy.
“You’ll get over that squeamishness soon enough,” John said, decisively cutting into his pork chop. “You’re too smart to let something as stupid as a dead frog get in your way.”
“It’s alright, Mr. Winchester. Most animals are frightened in new situations. Especially if they’ve had prior traumatic experiences. You say you’ve recently acquired Lucifer? Do you know his history.”
At 11:30, Kali, Gabriel’s assistant arrived to begin setting up for Gabriel’s patients and Meg went out to lunch. Castiel’s lunch period was an hour later, when Gabriel showed up for his half day. Balthazar, the lucky devil, didn’t have to be in until three so he was probably still sleeping off a hangover. But in just a few short days, their schedules would shift and Castiel would be able to savor the joy of sleeping in.
The next image was of Dean bending over to grab something from the bottom shelf in one of the bunker’s storage rooms.
He frowned at the image projected on the wall. It was obviously taken during one of their hunts. Dean had a blur of a monster pinned underneath him and a knife raised mid-stab. He looked pretty badass if he did say so himself.
“Well, I mean, yeah, I’ve told a couple chicks they have nice tits. But I don’t tell them they have aesthetically pleasing nipples. That’s just weird, man.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed. “This sounds way too convenient to be true. How come I’ve never met this twin of yours?"
“I appreciate the thought, but you don’t need to set me up with random strangers. I meant it when I said I’ll back off. I’ll move on. Im not going to be heartbroken just because you turned me down.”
“Nah, it’s all good. I’m an older brother too. I know what it’s like.” He held out his hand to shake Jimmy’s. “I’m going to treat your brother right. Don’t you worry about that.
Sam ate his dinner quickly and then pushed his plate aside. “May I be excused? I have a lot of homework tonight.”
“Fine by me,” Dean said with a grin. “Hey, Sammy, you wanna tell Dad I’m going to be late? Something about getting some personal tutoring.”
Castiel was too stunned to respond. He simply stared as Dean walked away, the red flannel swishing behind him.
Sam didn’t like it when Dean was quiet. He wasn’t Dean if he wasn’t loud, obnoxious, and ridiculous all the time. Sam even found himself missing Dean waxing poetic about Castiel’s messy hair and gummy smile.
“In his defense, I would have figured it out eventually,” Dean said. “After all, we’ve supposedly never had a class before and yet you walked right up to me.”
His combat boots thudded against the linoleum floor and the metal loops in his belt clinked as he walked up to the reception desk. From this closer vantage point, Castiel noticed eyeliner and a couple piercings in his left ear.
“No. You heard, Dad.” Dean’s hands tightened on the steering wheel. “Gotta keep my head down and keep my grades up.”
Charlie had to have had a menagerie by now. She was always finding and adopting stray animals. Castiel himself had treated two dogs, a cat, a guinea pig, and a chinchilla but he faintly remembered seeing her with a pair of cockatoos at some point.
“I see. Yes, I could offer you some assistance if you’re struggling. Let me know what your schedule is like and we can work out a time to meet.”
“Seriously,” Jimmy said. “Nobody suspects we’re twins until we tell them. You’re not dumb. It’s just statistical probability. Odds are against people having twins.”
Dean snorted. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Are you going to tell me I have an aesthetically appealing ass too?”
Dean nodded. “I got him some wooden blocks to chew on. They’re attached to his cage with some of the metal water bottle holders since he just chucks them around if they’re loose. But if they’re attached, he actually has to work at them.”
“Oh, new blood today,” Castiel said with surprise. “I don’t recall a Raccoon ever coming to our clinic.”
Two minutes before seven, Becky arrived. “Good morning, Doctor Novak, Miss Masters,” she said cheerfully. “We’re going to have a great day today, aren’t we? So many cute puppies and kittens.” She sank into her chair with a happy sigh. “I love my job.”
There were few things Dean loved more than a quiet day home in the bunker. There were no cases to work on and no apocalypse hanging over their heads. It was a nice reprieve.
He quickly crossed the cafeteria, just in case any of Jimmy’s friends were on the way over and nudged Jimmy’s table with one hip.
Before Dean could take a closer look, he heard Cas behind him closing the cabinet doors. “My siblings.”, he heard him say and turned around. “It’s the only photo I have of them.”, Cas continued and handed Dean a glass with a golden liquid. “Is whiskey alright? I don’t really have anything else -”, he tried to apologize but Dean interrupted him, taking the glass quickly. “Dude, I love whiskey!”,he said with a smile. “And your room is awesome! Did you move it all in by yourself?” Cas shook his head with a slight smile. “Most of the things were already here when I moved in. Apart from the books of course.”,  he replied and took a sip. Dean chuckled, taking a sip himself. The whiskey burned in his throat in a familiar way and he could taste an unmistakable tang of the sea mingling beautifully with peat smoke. His eyes widened and he met Cas’ curious gaze. “That’s some good stuff.”, he said and took another sip. “A friend of mine has some connections.”, Cas just replied with a smile. “You want to go to the beach? I always find it calming to take a walk in the night.”, he asked and Dean nodded enthusiastically. “Sure!”
There was this huge shopping street with an unpronounceable name (at least for Dean!) where a lot of rich shops were lined next to each other. Apart from that the city had several parks and cafes, people were sitting outside, eating ice-cream or they were taking a walk, playing with their children, cycling and so on. Dean liked the lively, easy-going atmosphere of the city and slowly he understood Sam’s decision to stay here for a while. What he didn’t like was the fact that the Germans apparently didn’t know pie - he found out when they were eating lunch at a cafe.  Sammy gave him an apologetic look as he grudgingly stabbed his strawberry cake with the fork. He would’ve never admitted it out loud, but the cake was pretty good. After their lunch they made their way to the Wall because Dean really wanted to see what it was like being so close to the border between the Eastern and the Western world. It’d be the closest he’s ever been to the Soviet Union. Sam wasn’t exactly comfortable with the idea but he would never deny his brother. When Dean saw the Wall for the first time, he at first felt a bit disappointed. He’d imagined it as a huge, thick concrete border guarded by soldiers. Instead the Wall was smaller, maybe 10 feet and no spot of concrete could be seen. It’d been sprayed on in so many colors showing paintings, signatures, powerful demands. On the other side though... he could see two watchtowers along the wall. Soldiers stood on there, carrying heavy guns. That was the moment Dean realized how different the West and East were. He wondered what life was like over there, if there are so many people guarding the Wall on that side. Did it feel like a prison?
Dean grins, "Either way, I'm not leaving here without you."  And, oh, that's familiar. This is something they've done before, the two of them - pulling each other out of impossible situations. Done it more than once, actually.
Dean, none of them lasting long enough to make much of an impact (some only lasting upwards of 5 minutes). Not-Dean's hands wander further.
Dean nods once, short, and starts, "One time, um, dad dumped us- me and Sam- in Connecticut for a few months. I think Sammy was maybe, I dunno, twelve? And we stayed at this hotel with a heater that kept breaking down and a bad lock on the door."
"Hey, hey, Cas, wait. Hold on a second," Dean asks, reaching out to pull on Cas' arm to get him to turn, but his hand stops short and only hovers. Somehow, that stings more than anything, the
Cas balks, and his fight-or-flight response immediately tells his arm that's holding the offending underwear to shoot behind his back, like the guy in front of him is some kind of toddler without object permanence and will just... forget they were even there to begin with. Or maybe even that Cas was there, or had an arm to be holding hot pink underwear in at all. Absolutely foolproof.
, it happens sometimes. Not a big deal. People are just, I dunno, they like to act like they know something about you when they really have no idea. Don't let it bother you."
"Dean, can you-" Cas cuts himself off, searching Dean's face for an answer. "Can you tell me what you're feeling?"
"I love you, you stupid son of a bitch, I love you." Maybe he can fix it if he says it enough, says those three words enough, repeats them like a mantra, like a fucking heartbeat in his head.
you more than I've ever wanted anything else, and I guess, hell, I guess you do too." Dean laughs a bit in disbelief, and reaches, timidly, for Cas' hand where it sits between them. Cas thinks,
Dean takes a long breath out, "And then we left the next day. Never came back and, I never saw that guy again. But dad, he looked at me different after that, treated me different. Worse. He sent me on my first solo case a few months later but I- I think he just wanted to get rid of me. Like he couldn't bear to look at me, look at what I
Cas doesn't look at him directly, but he can't stop the smile that pulls at his mouth when he hears Dean mutter under his breath: "Ugh, man, seriously? The raisin bran goes at the
Cas thinks, somehow, the way the "regular" Dean Winchester makes him feel is more cosmic and divine than anything he could feel looking at his soul - though he's still of the opinion that Dean's soul is one of the few truly beautiful ones his father created. Maybe he's biased, but he can't find it in himself to change his mind.
me. And it takes me a second and then I just, I push him off of me and I say 'what the hell do you think you're doing, you know I'm not that kinda guy I don't swing that way,' just all the- all the usual crap. And we just look at each other for a second before he pulls me in and kisses me again and I-" Dean balls his fists in the rough fabric of his jeans and doesn't even try to stop crying, doesn't think he could stop crying at this point. He takes a sharp, deep breath in because he knows the next few words are going to knock all the air out of his lungs.
"All of the dryers are broken!" Cas blurts out, making the man flinch and look back at him wide-eyed. "All the dryers are broken, except for this one, and I'm
Sam and Jack leave and turn in fairly soon after the movie ends, leaving both Dean and Cas finishing off the last of the small bits of popcorn collected at the bottom of the bowls. Dean yawns and presses more of his weight onto Cas' shoulder. Cas' ears burn for the 3rd time that night, but he's too busy trying to keep his heartbeat steady, so he lets them stay pink in the hopes it's too dark for Dean to notice.
"Right," Gorgeous Guy With Green Eyes Who Must Think Castiel is a Total Freak Now says. "Well, if you don't mind me-" he walks towards Cas, scooting past him to sweep his mountain of lumberjack clothing off of where Cas had piled it on top of the dryer, and bends down to grab the rest of them out as well.
Cas keeps his eyes locked with Dean's like he's done a million times before, and he realizes he's scared too. "Okay," he nods, "Okay, I'll stay."
Well, it’s not only Cas that noticed, it’s just that Cas is the only one who offered a suggestion to fix it. After an hour or two of Dean pacing around post-hunt and organizing, then re-organizing, then re-re-organizing the cupboard, Cas proposed they go out and find something to do. Dean lit up at that and said
Dean isn't meeting Cas' eye and is instead looking at the loose gravel beneath their feet. "Cas, can we- can we just forget tonight ever happened? Everything at the bar and everything just now, can we just forget it? Just get back and in the car and leave it all behind, please?"
Cas could swear Dean always hesitates before he clicks the door shut - but maybe that's still just wishful thinking.
with a woman who, looking over Dean's shoulder, seems to be mildly irritated at best at being ditched.
, Cas. Because it was the right thing to do. You always do the right thing, or-" and Dean cuts himself off with a shaky laugh, "you try to. And that's- that's the part that matters. You try."
wrong with you. And, Dean, even if there was, well," Cas' smile widens and he leans closer to Dean, "I'll still love you, always."
It's as Cas has his index and middle fingers poking the bulge in the satin up into a facsimile of what would
"Cas?" Dean shouts into the void. Which is ridiculous, shouting into a literal limitless nothing and hoping Cas hears him. But it's the only play he's got, so: "Cas! You out there? Come on, man, I'm praying, okay? Cas!"
say that, but I'm an angel. We're different from humans. I'm different from you." Cas says that last sentence in a way that suggests there's more wrapped up in it beyond angel vs. human perspectives on sexuality. But they don't really have time to get into all that at the moment.
Cas' hand stays balled in a tight fist behind his back, regardless of what his inner voice of reason tells him.
"Out? What do you mean "out"? Out whe-" Dean stops dead in the middle of his sentence and stares at something below Cas' eye line. "Wait. What is that?"
Dean grins, "Great, I'll just-" and he jabs a thumb over his shoulder in lieu of finishing the sentence before walking off towards the kitchen to make the "somewhat agreeable" popcorn he'd promised.
"I gotta tell you something, okay? And it might, it might not be exactly what you're expecting to hear but it's-" Dean cuts himself off and looks down at his shoes. "I gotta say it first, before I can say anything else, alright? I just, I gotta tell you
, but decides against it. He doesn’t feel like getting into an argument, but something about Dean wanting to pick up people at the bars they go to always makes him, well, Dean calls it “bitchy” but Cas feels he’s just “irritated”. They
Dean beams, "Yeah! I picked it up at the Goodwill last week. Figured we were all getting sick of the "which two of us is gonna sit on the floor tonight" game. This way we've got enough room for everyone plus extra leg room to spare."
In moments that last far too long to be considered fleeting - Cas imagines it's Dean's hands on him. Dean's hands in his hair, on his waist, pulling off his belt, tugging him onto the bed. He knows that's not the point of what the man offered him. This is supposed to help him get
This time, Cas does reach up and brush the tear from Dean's cheek. Dean pulls back on instinct, before leaning into the touch. "I know that
Any trace of friendliness drops from Dean's face. "Yeah, of course he can, and he wants to leave. Cas, let's go." Dean says, tugging on Cas' arm.
So maybe that was why Cas had been sitting in the kitchen for the last half hour audibly scraping his spoon on the bottom of a cereal bowl that's been empty for the past 5 minutes. Maybe he was waiting for Dean to come around and mumble something about how
Once he's checked no less than 3 times to make sure he hadn't missed a rouge sock at the bottom of the drum, he carries his load of wet clothes over the only dryer in the whole line of front-load dryers against the back wall without a printer-paper and sharpie
Popcorn bowls are distributed and they all get settled in. Dean claps his hands together. "Alright. Jack, you're picking tonight. What're we watching?"
he'd tell himself. A brush of Dean's shoulder every now and then to shift a freckle he realized he'd gotten an inch out of place, or a hand on his back to wipe away the last of the claw mark scars from a werewolf hunt gone bad when he was just a teenager. He'd check Dean's soul most often, make sure it was intact. Still bright, still Dean, still
Dean stammers, and before he can think of a good answer Cas storms off and leaves Dean still standing wrong-footed.
"I'll see you around, Cas." Dean says over his shoulder. "And, uh, keep the underwear. I got more pairs anyway." He says, then
Cas finally turns his eyes away from Dean, "No, Jack, stay," he says, both a question and an insistence, "Surely you can't be that busy?"
It's only been a few weeks since Dean pulled Cas out of the empty. Since they found the ultimate loophole and cut out his grace. Because after all, the empty's in the business of housing angels and demons - not humans. Cas is still getting the hang of it again, the brushing his teeth and needing to eat and needing to sleep and needing to change his clothes more than once every 4 years. Though on days like these,
A harsh look crosses Cas' face, and Dean's briefly reminded that, above all else, Cas is still a capital "a" Angel (and could totally drop kick his ass into next Thursday without breaking a sweat). Cas levels that look right at Dean and says, "And what if I did, Dean, why would it matter to you?"
They stop and look at each other rather than continue their litany of unnecessary apologies. One breath, two, three, four.
in dudes. Not that I've seen at least. I mean, Cas, if I would've known I wouldn't have been trying to set you up with chicks all these years. No wonder you didn't ever really seem into them," Dean lets out a small laugh, "thought you were just shy."
"What would you like me to say, Dean?" Cas says as he walks over to sit on the edge of his bed, nudging the clothes pile over. "That I'm gay? I
With that, the Winchesters start to walk out of the barn. Sam falls in step next to Jack, starting up a conversation about what could only be assumed to be either cosmic god stuff or the latest episode of Riverdale (that Sam 100% did not start watching after Jack left. 100% did not). As can be expected of them, Dean and Cas gravitate next to each other like they were built to walk shoulder to shoulder. Dean elbows Cas softly in the ribs and shoots him a smile. Cas smiles back, and threads his fingers through Dean's.
Cas relaxes and closes the heavy book in front of him with a reverberating thud - which is then accompanied by an insistent buzz.
Tug his hair, plant kisses to the hollow of his throat, run his hands over his chest. It was mesmerizing, and he wondered if now that he's had it he'd ever be able to get enough. Cas could touch every inch of Dean a hundred times over and still he would want to do it a hundred more times, and a hundred more after that.
Cas sobs louder, can't stop himself. Dean sees his face turn red, and he wonders, fleetingly, if Cas has ever cried like this before.
Dean doesn't stop to think before he's kissing Cas again. Afterall, they've got a lot of time to make up for.
Cas walks over to the washing machine he'd stuck his clothes in half an hour prior, and hoists them out and into his waiting laundry basket, humming absent-mindedly under his breath.
Dean pats Cas on the shoulder and plops down across from him with a bowl of one of the more brightly colored cereals, and grins at Cas over his spoon.
Great, so this guy's got a really cool girlfriend (or at the very least a very cool one night stand) who leaves her underwear laying around his place. If Cas didn't already hate the guy he certainly did now, how dare he not be chronically single like everyone else (or, more accurately, like Cas is)? And he's washing what looks like fairly high quality underwear in the same load as what seems to be an entire Sportsman's Warehouse?
how it could feel to have everything you could ever want standing right in front of you only for it to look back at you like you aren't anything, like you aren't fucking
Even if he's laughing at him, Cas thinks he's never heard something that makes his stomach flip as completely as this. He'd like to hear this man laugh again, even though he knows it's certainly not in the cards at this point.
It looks like he's standing on a whole lot of nothing, which gives him vertigo for a second before he remembers that nothing is really the whole point of this place. Still doesn't make him any less queasy, though.
Cas keeps staring at the text. He checks the time. It's late enough that if he left now he would get back around when everyone would be going to sleep, and could come up with a nonspecific excuse to avoid any questions as to his whereabouts. Honestly, that night had been fun. He understands now why Dean partakes in that particular past-time so often. Cas opens the keyboard to respond when - like he could read Cas' thoughts from across the bunker - Dean walks in.
. Cas looks from their loosely intertwined hands up to Dean's face, back to their hands, back up to Dean's face, back to their hands
Which is how Dean and Cas find themselves standing in a seedy motel lobby where the guy checking them in just had the
. "Thought we could make some popcorn. I know it doesn't taste like much to you but you said the texture was "somewhat agreeable", right?"
Cas sucks in a breath. He looks off towards the kitchen where he hears the echoes of faint pops and Dean's slightly off-tune rendition of
Dean says it softly, reverently. In a way that doesn't convey that it feels like the words tear out of him, rip from his throat- rip from his
Later, they lay wrapped around each other in the backseat, lit only faintly by the faded streetlights outside. Dean is already dozing off in Cas' arms. Cas knows it's considered rude to leave - and regardless, there's no place he'd rather be - so he lets himself fall asleep too.
"Alright." The word rolls off Cas' tongue before he can stop it, but he finds - surprisingly - he doesn't regret it.
Cas, nonplussed, "Oh, were we not going to tell Sam? I wish you would've told me that sooner than, Dean."
, grabbing Cas' phone off the nightstand as Cas shrugged on his trenchcoat and casually putting his number in.
"He looks at me and he says 'boy, I ain't gonna raise no queer son. You understand me?' and I said,'' Dean's posture straightens a bit, an echo from that moment, "'yes, sir, I understand' and he nodded at me and walked out of the room." Cas wants to reach out to comfort him, to
"Right and uh," Dean swallows hard, keeps his eyes trained on the floor, swallows again, and says, "There was this guy I knew that came around the room sometimes. He- you know I, I don't even remember his name." Dean huffs out a laugh over the lump in his throat to try and break the tension, but it just ends up making the tears he's been holding back for so,
Dean hears the heavy metallic thud of the bunker door opening and closing. At the sound, he sets down the two cereal boxes he was holding.
, I- um, I- no. No. We're not uh- we're not," Dean rapidly flaps one hand between the two of them, "we're just, just-"
Cas' eyes go wide for a half-second before going back to his ever-present semi-squint. Rubbing the side of his neck, Cas says, "What? Dean, no. It's just a bruise."
Dean slides his palm from Cas' cheek, down his arm, and twines their fingers together. "Cas, come on, we gotta go," and nods his head at the flickering yellow line of a portal a few paces behind him.
He looks around, like someone is going to magically appear out of nowhere in the middle of the room to take this pile of plaids and jeans off his hands.
They reach Dean's room and he pushes the door open and steps in. Dean turns to Cas, standing in his room with his hand on the door, and Cas could swear - he could
Cas stands to full height and looks like he's going to walk past Dean, until he stops parallel to him and drops his hand onto Dean's shoulder- digs his fingers in a bit for added effect. Cas leans down until his mouth is a few inches from Dean's ear, and he feels Dean's muscles tense at the sudden shift in energy.
with Cas' sexuality - but when he angles his head towards Dean he sees something in his eyes that makes him pause. Something that makes him think that maybe Dean hasn't been trying to affirm
Dean's not paying attention, so Cas lets himself look. Lets himself catalog Dean's features for the millionth time - the curve of his nose, the slant of his jawline, the hairs out of place, the freckles painted onto his skin. Cas has still never gotten tired of looking at Dean. He thought he would, at first. He figured it was just a holdover from knitting him back together.
straight." He winces slightly at the awkwardness of referring to himself in 3rd person, but that hardly cracks the top 10 most awkward moments of the whole last 15 minutes.
They're on a backroad in the middle of nowhere, because whenever Dean's behind the wheel it seems like they're always on a backroad in the middle of nowhere. Like he has every single one across the whole of America cataloged in his head. He's driving with both hands on the wheel and a face full of cuts and bruises, and Cas is sitting in the passenger's seat looking out the window with his arms firmly crossed - pissed.
"I didn't mean for it to come across like I was bothered by, well-" Dean waves his hand at Cas' neck, freshly healed of the hickey that had been there hours before. "It just caught me off guard. Casual hookups haven't really been your scene so it kinda surprised me. But I just wanted to say - I'm happy for you. Glad you're, gettin' out there, ya know?"
The door clicks shut behind them and Bar Guy (Chris? Mark? Usually Cas is better with names than this) pushes Cas up against the wall and kisses him. Cas lets himself get lost in kissing back. He can count on one hand the amount of people he's kissed, but that number zeroes out if he's asked to count how many
Dean stops in front of him, smiling as the girl laughs and curls further into his side. “Hey buddy, we’re gonna get outta here. You’ll be good finding your own way home tonight?”
and not for the first time Cas finds him so, so beautiful. Cas smiles too, and if he were in Dean's head he'd know that Dean finds
"I didn't mean it like that, I just- I know that kinda guy, alright? All he wanted was to get in your pants and then lose your number in the morning. You deserve better than that."
Searching for something to call him, Cas recalls he's often seen Claire refer to men she's met but doesn't care to remember the names of as [Blank] Guy - like Hardware Store Guy, or Walmart Guy, or Chinese Food Place Guy. Cas has unintentionally picked up the habit in his own internal monologue. Therefore, "Bar Guy" seems to be an apt name for now.
Dean looks genuinely excited, and Cas' heart skips at the sight. He wishes Dean got to be happy more often, after everything - he deserves it.
sign scotch-taped to the front. He opens it only to find it is full - completely full - of what looks like the wardrobe of someone with a lifetime's subscription to Lumberjack's Weekly, or something else equally drenched in flannel.
"Dean," Cas says, in a tone that should be accompanied by an eyeroll, but one look at his actual expression betrays a bone deep
. Where Cas would normally smile at this, he instead furrows his brows and flattens his mouth into a thin line.
"I'm not lying I-" Dean turns and scrubs a hand down his face, "What can I do to make you believe me?"
Cas is eyeing the off-white couch now situated in the middle of the "Dean Cave", flanked by the 2 leather recliners that previously made up the only sit-able furniture in the room. It's a bit small, potentially enough for 3 grown men, but it's more than likely Dean got it with the intention that it would be used 2 at a time, considering there were 2 other perfectly good chairs to sit in.
Cas sticks his hand out to meet Bar Guy's. "Castiel," and when he sees the furrow of Bar Guy's brow he adds, "but most people call me Cas."
Sam is still pointing and connecting the dots when Cas, still generally unbothered, says, "I see, my apologies. Do you want coffee, Dean?"
Sam bursts through the barn doors, "Okay, I'm back. I got the-" he looks up to take in the scene around him, eyes finally landing on Jack. "Jack, what-"
Cas comes back to the war room holding two cups of coffee just as Jack walks in. They both stop and take in the sight of two grown men chasing each other around the room like children.
If Dean tunes Sam out and thinks instead of the outline of the deep purple bruise half-hidden by Cas' half-buttoned collar and wonders, with a turn of his stomach, if there's ones that are more than half-hidden; then neither mention it.
Cas knew, also, in the back of his head, that Dean hadn't meant it like that. He was surprised, that's all. It's not like one night stands were something Cas did often. Or did ever, really.
The car ride over is strangely serene. It turns out Bar Guy doesn't live all that far from where the bar is, so it's a
Dean's heart aches again, practically just shatters into pieces. Because Cas is right. Dean can't promise he won't ever be mad at Cas ever again (even though he
"It's okay, it's okay, Cas. I'm right here. I'm here." And at that Dean's head drops forward, lands softly on Cas' shoulder. He doesn't have to check Dean's pulse to know.
“Ha, yeah, I think that’s kinda the point, Cas.” Dean counters, eyes still on the woman and not on Cas.
"Before that, when we got to school there the first day, I walked into whatever class I was stuck in at 8am and sat in the back because, ya know, we never hung around long so I didn't plan on learning much anyways. Didn't plan on making any friends either but, well," Dean actually smiles a bit at this. This part of the memory is fonder, afterall. "So I'm leaned back in my chair with my feet propped up on the desk getting the stink eye from the teacher already and this guy next to me he just, he just says hi to me, and he introduces himself and for some reason, I dunno I just- I just start talking to him. And he was nice and
"Hey," Dean elbows Cas and whispers low enough that Jack and Sam won't be able to hear. "Paul Rudd looks pretty good in this one, don't you think?"
Dean slams on the breaks and they both lurch forward. Cas' hands slam onto the dashboard to steady himself and Dean's staring wide-eyed at the road with both hands white-knuckling the steering wheel.
They both look at each other for a long second and then slowly they meet in the middle. And they're standing on a backroad in middle-of-nowhere Georgia and they're
Cas just nods in response, and the man indicates to the bartender they'll be needing two more drinks. Hat Trick turns to say something, but is promptly interrupted.
"Cas, wait. Wait," Cas meets Dean's eyes, and Cas feels like he's the one run through for a second. Looking at Dean, he's
Cas feels his blood run cold in a way it never quite had before, but it feels all too familiar just the same.
Cas smiles faintly, then elbows Dean right back. They go back to watching the movie in silence; shoulders pressed together.
Dean leads, hand reaching back and gripping Cas' so firmly he knows the skin's going paler where their hands link. Maybe it's the mythology reference Cas just made or maybe it's something else, but Dean doesn't let himself look back. They pause for a second when they reach the portal. If there was anyone to pray to Dean would pray with every part of himself that this works. Instead, he just hopes it does.
"That might be helpful, Dean. I understand quantum mechanics, but the intricacies of your cereal organizational system still baffles me."
you, do you hear me?" Dean's stepping into Cas' space, bringing both his hands up to either side of his face, like if he holds him there and makes him look and really listen that he'll hear it. That he'll understand it. That Dean’s right here and that he was always worth it, to Dean he was
, one on top of the other. They'd finally gotten Cas to start switching up his outfit every now and again, so at least he's stress unpacking his own clothes and not Dean's (which really isn't so far out of the realm of possibility for him).
But as his grace ebbed and waned, and in the times it's been gone altogether, he'd gotten the chance to look past Dean's soul and instead see Dean the way everyone else sees him. The Dean with the goofy smile and bow legs and "delicate features", as he was told by a slightly drunk Sam that their cousin once put it.
of his chest. He hopes there aren't any psychic Looney Tunes fans in a 15 miles radius, or this will be an embarrassing death experience to explain to Sam later.
And Cas is currently in baggy sweatpants and an old Spice Girls concert t-shirt with about 4 separate holes in the collar. Also, he's fondling a pair of clearly built-for-dicks pink lace panties. Fantastic.
Then, footsteps on hard concrete that stop abruptly near the door frame. Cas doesn't have to turn to know it's Dean, and to know Dean is weighing whether or not Cas still seems pissed enough to warrant heel turning and walking away. A breath, and footsteps down 3 stairs, and the image out of the corner of Cas' eye of a Dean who is
Dean turns to watch Cas rush off deeper into the bunker and sees Sam appear in the doorway in front of him. He almost gets body checked by the pissed-off angel headed in his direction, and Sam's head swivels to watch him go.
Cas uncrosses his arms and waves them in Dean's direction. He's raising his voice, because he still is firmly
Cas had already grabbed their bags from the trunk of the Impala and pushed into their room in the time it took Dean's brain to reboot enough to engage in higher functions such as "walking" and "breathing normally" and "not having a face comparable to an over-ripe tomato".
"Dean, that's the 6th time you've yawned in the past 10 minutes. I think it's safe to say you need to go to bed."
- and just like that, all would be forgiven. Maybe Cas was waiting for that, or maybe he was simply engrossed in his cereal bowl harmonics. Maybe, maybe, maybe.
Dean keeps grinning, though there's maybe a bit more... intent to it than before? Maybe Cas is just projecting, or hoping, but maybe not. "Lucky me."
He can say with certainty he liked it much better than when he'd had sex with April. Even before she'd tied him up and stabbed him, there was something about it that wasn't quite...right? Wasn't what he wanted, not really. It was something he felt obligated to do. Something he felt he should do as a newly minted red-blood (technically) American (technically) man. He doesn't like to admit it to himself, but even then he'd closed his eyes and pictured Dean instead too.
his brain unhelpfully adds. He settles on trying to sound casual, but the next part still comes out incredulous. "Did you
that's been between them for so long finally coming to the surface. It's entirely too much. It's entirely not enough. Dean unfists Cas' coat and smooths out the wrinkles, Cas lets the arm wrapped behind Dean's head fall and slip around his waist instead.
He leaves it half open because: benefit number one, no one is going to be down here with him anyway, so why worry about locking it behind him?
Cas answers with a kiss, one more firm than the last one they'd had, but free. With the knowledge they've got a lot more where that came from.
And, oh, that’s maybe…way more possessive than Cas thinks it should be. He tears his eyes away and focuses on nursing the cheap beer in front of him, the label almost completely ripped off.
But he sees the fraught expression Dean's wearing and decides that, whatever it is, Dean's got a damn good reason to make the connection. So, like he said he would, Cas listens.
And an added note, any sex scenes will be very very vaguely described since I don't want to write them lmao
asking him if he'd "hooked up" with someone made him angry in the "divine wrath of heaven will rain down upon you" sense - which is angrier than he has been in at least the last few decades.
"So he started coming around the room, right? And usually we'd just sit and watch old westerns or whatever crap was on public access and bitch about school or life or something, but um, one night-" Dean stops looking anywhere, and closes his eyes before he continues. "One night, Sam was at the library I think, doing nerd stuff and, and the guy was over and we just- we were just sitting at the end of the bed watching tv. And then he-" Dean screws his eyes shut tighter and hot tears spill out of the corners, "He just- he just leans over and
A step, a bright light, a dimmer light, the sound of shoes hitting reinforced concrete, a portal closing behind him, a hand still-
They lapse into staring at each other again, and something about isn't as uncomfortable as you'd think making prolonged uninterrupted eye contact with a total stranger (that you totally, completely embarrassed yourself in front of mere minutes prior) would be. Something about it just feels - right.
Dean narrows his eyes, grips Cas' shoulder tighter, and sets his jaw. "Oh, were you? Well, not anymore. We're leaving. Cas, come on."
Fourth: he's awake at this time every night anyway. Plus, it keeps his mind off how he's stuck working a dead-end job for a boss he hates and he's sure would just as soon put a drill through his head if it meant it'd increase his "productivity" or whatever company line is. It also keeps his mind off his string of exes, for Meg to Mick to 3 other more forgettable flings in a row - he hasn't been able to catch a break. He
Dean closes the door to the bunker, trying his best to make the sound not echo through the whole building. His best isn’t quite good enough, and a few moments later Sam pokes his head in from the library, still leafing through a book in his hand.
When they finally pull apart it's only slightly, still resting their foreheads together. Cas pulls back a little further and tilts his head a bit to the side. Slowly, he moves his hand up to push off Dean's jacket.
Cas opens his mouth but stops short and looks down, weaving his fingers together and focusing on his stretched palms in his lap.
Cas' head had started swimming halfway through Dean's speech. All this time, all these months, maybe
Dean stands, mouth open and staring at the spot where Cas just was. If this were a few years ago it would almost be reminiscent of the times Cas would fly away mid-conversation. But if this were a few years ago, Dean wouldn't have been flustered enough about it to even be
The bars blend together. The hunts, the restless nights, the restless mornings, the slow afternoons. Dean leaving with a girl (or recently, a few times, a guy) on his arm more often than not, Cas sometimes leaving after Dean - always after, never before - with a man's hand on the small of his back.
Dean claps Jack on the back, "Great, because I know the best burger joint about 15 miles from here, and you've earned one," Dean says, with his patented goofy smile plastered on his face, pointing a finger at Jack.
"Cas, wait," Dean grabs Cas' elbow when he tries to brush past him. Cas' hand stills outstretched on the doorknob in front of him, stopping at the touch even though he could easily shrug Dean off. That's become a staple of their relationship - Cas letting Dean do things to him he'd refuse outright on principle from anyone else. He angles his head at Dean but, uncharacteristically, doesn't meet his eye.
With a jolt, Dean feels Cas' hand tentatively brush his elbow, then reach up, up, and fit perfectly onto his left shoulder. And that's it. Cas moves his other arm and wraps it behind Dean's neck, pulling him in closer, kissing him deeper. One of Dean's hands trails from Cas' face and curls into the lapel of his too-heavy trench coat.
Cas turns them over in his hands, and the fabric almost looks like it melts around his fingers it's so smooth. The lace is also surprisingly intricate, with little pentagrams weaved into what looks like neverending figure-eights of flames. And all still a bright hot pink to boot.
"Hey, no need to explain. Like I said, I get it," he smiles, and, yeah, still fairly attractive. He slides off his lone seat at his table and into the spot Dean had been sitting earlier that night. Cas eyes him, but doesn't protest.
Dean takes a strangled breath out, but is still looking anywhere but Cas' face. "I never slept with any of those girls, or any of those guys. All the ones I've been picking up, I haven't actually slept with a
Cas doesn’t mind bars, really. They’re actually kind of entertaining once you get used to the drunken yelling and occasional uncoordinated fight. If he lets himself sink far enough back into his seat while watching the crowd it almost feels like the old days. The
Dean makes a small noise in the back of his throat that sounds halfway between choking and gasping. It seems like he's about to open his mouth to say something, but Cas is already on the other side of the room.
Cas has had time to consider this at length, and goes over it again as he carries his empty basket down the hallway and presses the down button on the creaky elevator.
They’re cut off by the sound of the bunker door opening and closing again, and they both look up to see Cas walking in with his trenchcoat off and folded over his arm.
"Right." Bar Guy slaps a few dollars down on the table. He leads Cas through the crowd, out the door into the crisp night air, and into the passenger's seat of his decidedly
that he isn't able to mask. "Do I really need to answer that question? Can't you figure that out for yourself?"
Dean shakes his head and finally looks at Sam. "No, no it's not a bad thing, Sammy. I just- I didn't know Cas did stuff like that. I mean, the guy didn't lose his millennias old v-card until what, a few years ago?"
When they pull apart it's not because they need to breathe, it's because they feel like if they kiss any more they'll shatter under the weight of it. This thing- this
"No, of course we were gonna tell Sam just- not 2 seconds after we walk in the door! And not through telling him you gave me a hickey!"
to get the words out because it feels like if he doesn't they'll rip through his chest like knives or like claws or like bullets. As it were, the next words weren't sharp or jagged, they were hollow and whispered, "
Dean leans down slightly until he's able to catch Cas' eye so he'll look at him again, "I promise not to be angry."
Cas gasps, then his own eyes go wide as he looks over at Dean. Dean's breathing hard, and he looks like he can't quite believe the words that just came out of his mouth. He stares at the road, glances at Cas, looks back at the road, then drops his eyes down to the door handle and gets out of the Impala - not bothering to shut it on the way out.
"Cas could you uh, could you come here?" Dean pats the space on the bed next to him and gives Cas a tight smile. Cas looks wary, but he still trusts Dean with anything,
"If it doesn't then I'll keep coming back here until it does work, or until the Empty gets so sick of me that it either kills me or tosses us both outta here on principle," Dean says. His brazen recklessness has Cas making a face that Dean knows means he's doing everything in his power not to roll his eyes. But it's fond, it's so,
Cas feels, only slightly, only barely, incandescent with pure irritation. He takes a steadying breath and weighs his options. After a few moments he's decided to just take this person's clothes out, dry his own, then hopefully have them be done early (or in this case, late) enough that he'll be able to put their clothes back into the machine without anyone ever knowing the difference. He nods to himself, then starts pulling shirts out of the machine and places them in a heap on top of it.
Cas half-smiles after him, turning back to the table to put the book away. Then he catches sight of his phone sitting next to it, and remembers what his plans for the night had been moments before.
mattered. And then he starts to take off my shirt and then, well, you can probably uh, see where that leads. But- but the thing is that, it
That is, he thinks that up until the moment Dean's fingers wrap around his palm and then all he can think is
It sucks. Fully, fully sucks. Dean didn't realize that there was this pit in his chest that only felt whole whenever Cas was looking at him, but he really gets that now. And Dean's heart beats a hard rhythm against that pit and it makes his breath come out stilted, makes it hardly come out at all. He wants to sob, or scream, or hit something or get hit. He feels likes everything's closing in around him and he never
The next day Sam showed him a few of his favorite places and of course, his university. They laughed and talked, ate at some restaurant and Dean teased him relentlessly for his nearly perfect German. Time went by so fast that Dean was surprised when it was already late in the evening when they returned to Sam’s apartment. The sun had almost sunk down and soaked the sky in hues of violet and orange. That’s one of the things I’ll miss, Dean thought. He’d never seen as beautiful sunsets as here in Berlin. The so-called Golden Hour left the whole city in a warm glow and softened the otherwise harsh edges of the buildings. The first time Dean saw the city like this he felt an ethereal atmosphere that gave him joy and peace.
It helped a little and as soon as he felt the plane landing ruggedly on the ground he opened his eyes and exhaled in relief. They’ve landed. The flight was over.
He had been broken and bruised and battered and only after Cas had died, something in him healed. The words Cas had said in that room had fueled this little voice inside him, whispering and screaming into his ear that maybe Dean wasn‘t Daddy‘s little soldier, a blunt instrument, a cold-blooded killer. He was stronger than this and only Cas made him realize that he deserved to be saved. But now Cas was gone and up with Jack somewhere, fixing things that could be fixed. A shuddering breath escaped Dean‘s throat as he realized that their bond couldn‘t be fixed anymore. Back then, he didn‘t have a moment to think, a chance to say anything when Cas was swallowed by the Empty. The words came after in these restless nights, in an endless stream, voices in his head that could only be quieted when he grabbed a pen and wrote the words down. Of course he hid them beneath his pillow, these pages full of apologies. Sam never knew.
The sun was bright and the sky blue. Dean Winchester stared out of the window of the roaring whirring airplane that currently flew him over the Atlantic ocean. He couldn’t hide his amazement at the view of the white clouds flying by in a blur. This is what the world looked like from above, this is what heaven would like if he were a believer. But he was not and so he just admired the beauty of nature. The machinery whirred around him and there were 7 hours left until they finally landed in West-Berlin. But Dean couldn’t sleep. First he was still mesmerized by the sight of the blue ocean beneath him, glittering in the sunlight, and second he was excited to see his little brother again. It’s been over 6 months since Sammy decided to study abroad for two semesters funded on a scholarship. When Dean first heard of his little, yet-too-tall-brother talking excitedly about his plans, his world broke down. Sammy was the only family he had left and now he was leaving him. But as the weeks went on and the date of Sammy’s departure neared, Dean slowly came to terms with it, even working part-time at Bobby’s to save up money for his brother’s stay. And now 6 months passed and despite his fear of heights, he was now sitting in an airplane, flying over the sea. Although he was a bit nervous and didn’t quite trust the machinery, the excitement was bigger.
Dean smiled. His eyes followed the racing clouds as he thought about Sammy and his short-term stay in a country that he knew nothing about except the fact that it is in Europe. The next hours passed by in a trance and suddenly Dean was jolted out of his thoughts by the rattling and shaking of the machine. A mechanic voice announced: “We are soon landing in Berlin-Tempelhof. Please fasten your seatbelts and remain in your seats.”
His whole body went rigid as he hit the cold salty water and immediately he shot up, gasping for air. “Finally!”, Dean heard Charlie say from further away and the others immediately cheered and clasped. Although his pride was a bit hurt, he couldn’t stop the grin that was spreading to both cheeks. “You’ll regret that now!”, he shouted back in mischief and dove into the waves again, swimming towards his friends. Now that he was completely drenched, it wasn’t that bad - actually the cold was quite welcoming after the heat of the sun. He decided that he really liked the feeling of the flowing and moving water against his body. The ocean carried his weight and it felt comforting. After a few powerful strokes Dean reached his friends and splashed them all in revenge. Sam looked like a wet puppy with all his long hair and not only once Dean had teased him about it which earned him a few splashes in return. The grin wouldn’t disappear from his face as he spent the next hours with his friends in the sea, playing around and laughing. When the sun went down the group decided to head back to the house and make themselves some dinner which Dean’s grumbling stomach was very grateful for.
Although Dean was in heaven, he wasn‘t happy. Even the car didn‘t feel right. Baby was too new, too smooth. The seats and windows were clean, there was no smell of stale beer, no tapes. It all seemed too perfect. Dean knew he should be content. He got Baby, Bobby, Ellen and Jo, his parents. But something was missing. He was torn out of life before he could even live. Leaving his brother alone, not being able to watch him grow. His hands clenched tighter around the wheel and Dean breathed out. He was shaking, tears burning in his eyes. One thought had entered his mind, the thought he‘d tried to banish and ignore and block out. Cas.
The sun shone brightly, not too hot, not too cold, but Dean didn‘t care. He tried to focus on the road before him, feeling Baby purr beneath him as if it was her first ride.
He discovered that Charlie was studying Engineering while Jess studied law just like Sam, which was no surprise to him. That girl could go big. But yet he mainly talked to Charlie since the two lovebirds were mainly focused on each other. During the drive he found out that Charlie was a huge nerd and liked all kinds of movies, especially Star Wars, which made Dean like her even more. They were discussing the rise and fall of the Jedi when the bus suddenly stopped. “We’ve arrived safe and sound kiddos!”, Gabriel shouted into the back and jumped out. The others followed him shortly after in excitement. While Dean picked up his duffle bag he looked around. They parked on an empty road in a forest full of conifers. He didn’t see much but he heard the sea. At least of what he thinks the sea sounded like.
Cas didn‘t move, just looking at him with these beautiful blue eyes. He looked just the way he was when he was swallowed by the empty. When he said those wor-
Cas doesn't have to ponder that very long, since Bar Guy's gotten the door open and is tugging him inside by the hand.
Dean looks relieved at that, like he'd been carrying a weight on his shoulders his whole life and only now did someone finally tell him
as hell so I decided 'yeah, yeah maybe I can have a friend. Just this once.'" Dean shakes his head, and Cas knows that's the head shake that means
Cas smiles at Dean softly. He can have this, he just has to say it. He reaches tentatively forward and slips an unsteady hand around Dean's, and Dean lets him. "I never wanted any of those men at any of the bars, I only ever wanted
Another bar, this time somewhere in northern Georgia, and it's a similar scene. Cas is sitting with his elbows resting on the bar (it reminds him of a different bar, a different state:
"Does it?" And Cas is actually asking in earnest, though he wonders what would constitute "better". He does know he'd like to find out.
He rolls his eyes and tries to flick them onto the pile with the rest of the clothes, but his fingers get caught up in the front, making him pause. There's definitely more material there than what's normal for traditional women's underwear. He raises his eyebrow and wiggles his fingers back and forth under the fabric.
“You probably have. I’m not proud of this, but we take advantage of being identical. I take all the classes in subjects I’m good at and he takes all the classes in subjects he’s good at. That way we both don’t have to suffer through classes we hate and we always get As. I’m the math and science guy and Castiel handles foreign languages, history, and stuff like that.”
Dean somehow managed to tear himself away from Castiel’s mouth for a moment. “What? No. I’m not letting you take Baby. Then how am I supposed to get home?”
He had honestly been expecting a cat. Gabriel had called his own beloved cat Honeybee a demon or the literal spawn of Satan so many times Castiel had lost count. And Bee was a perfect angel.
Meg gave him a quick once over with her eyes but her expression stayed professional. “Follow me to exam room three. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.”
But if Jimmy wasn’t interested in going out, Dean didn’t want an audience to watch him getting turned down.
Ah, so this was Castiel. The tall, dark and handsome Dean was always going on about. His eyes were definitely his most striking feature. He would give Dean that much.
“Smooth,” Jimmy said. “Real smooth. But I sure hope you’re a lot more than cheesy pick up lines. And I’m telling you that as his older brother.”
“But they are no less desirable qualities,” Castiel hastened to assure him.”You are not just a pretty face, as the saying goes.”
The kiss looked a little violent, but from the way Dean clutched at Castiel’s shoulders, he didn’t mind at all. Well, everyone had their own tastes Sam supposed. He was happy that the two of them somehow made it work.
Even though it was Dean’s fault that they were late getting home and had to really scramble to get dinner ready in time, Sam pitched in to help and between the two of them, they managed to finish making dinner shortly before their father was due home. Sam was just setting the the last plate on the table when the key turned in the lock
By the time Castiel worked up the courage for another peek, the man had plopped down onto the nearest free seat, the carrier tucked under his chair.
Castiel’s parents had been fairly conservative people and their clients were pretty much the same. Mostly middle-aged people with families, seniors, and the occasional student on a budget. They probably would have been horrified to have such an outlandish presence in their clinic. But Castiel could only stare in fascination.
“Don’t sell yourself short, Dean. You just needed a little nudge in the right direction. You got it all figured out eventually.”
The popularity was totally warranted, as far as Dan was concerned. Jimmy was not only ridiculously good looking, he was also incredibly smart. Maybe not quite as smart as Sam, but nobody really was. Still, Dean had never seen Jimmy struggle in any of the general ed classes they had shared. He seemed to be good at every subject and he could explain it all patiently in a way that anybody could understand. So yeah, Dean could see why so many people wanted to hang out with him.
“Oh man, this is awesome,” Dean said. He pawed through the bag. “I can’t wait to taste them.” He held a bright green dick aloft. “Thank you for this wonderful gift, Castiel. I’ll think of you while I eat every single one of these things.” He bit into the gummy and his eyes went wide. “Sammy! They’re cream-filled!”
“And if he’s not interested, you’re going to piss him off.” Sam reached across the table and put a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I don’t want to see you get hurt again.”
Three minutes later, Charlie burst in. She had a cardboard box tucked under her flannel jacket that she was barely holding onto. The whole box shook with movement and growling and hissing came from inside.
Castiel looked away. “I hope this doesn’t come as a shock to you, Dean, but I find you to be the most interesting example of humanity. I know my brethren have always found my interest unusual and even your brother cannot fathom what I see in you. I had hoped this would explain everything.”
Dean ruffled Sam’s hair. “So how were classes, Sammy? Not that you really need them. You probably know everything already, don’t you, smartypants?”
He whistled to himself as he puttered around in the kitchen. He was cooking tonight and it looked like he had everything he needed to put some burgers together. Everyone loved burgers, even Sam who put so much vegetables on his they were more salad than sandwich.
It was just what Sam had been afraid of. Dean was punishing himself by giving up his favorite eye candy.
Something about the importance of family, maybe, if he was lucky. If he was unlucky, probably something about showing vulnerability.
Dean elbowed him hard in the side. “You keep that up and I’m ditching you here. You’ll have to walk home.”
Sam wrinkled his nose. “Ugh. Would you just give me the damn keys? I don’t want to hear any of this.”
“What kind of crazy?” Dean demanded. If Cas was trying to destroy the world again, they were in serious trouble.
Sam had expected the conversation to mellow Dean out a little. The possibility of getting turned down and his heart broken would give normal people pause, at least briefly. But Dean’s excitement seemed to ratchet up as Monday approached and he was uncharacteristically eager to head to school Monday morning.
Cas stared at the image intently. “I find your nipples to be a very aesthetically pleasing shade of pink.”
Castiel shrugged. “I don’t watch a lot of TV. Working my way through veterinary school was very time-consuming.” He placed a gentle hand on Lucifer’s back. “His coat seems very healthy.” He moved up the rabbit’s body to his face. “Eyes are bright and clear. Let’s have a look at his teeth. Yes, they look good as well. It’s very important to keep a rabbit’s teeth a good length.”
Dean waved a hand dismissively. “All a big misunderstanding. But hot damn can he throw a punch. Did you see how ripped he is?”
“So, there’s your proof,” Jimmy said smugly. “You heard it with your own ears and you’ll see it with your own eyes soon enough.”
Castiel grasped Dean’s shirt by the collar and twisted it in his hands. “You are the bane of my existence. You are the single most infuriatingly, stupidly, stubbornly attractive man I’ve ever met.”
“In the meantime, how are you doing this semester? Any other math or science struggles I could help you with?”
Jimmy was a popular guy and he always seemed like he was surrounded with one group of friends or another, which made him hard to catch all by himself.
Dean checked his watch. Almost half an hour had gone by. “So, is this the part where you excuse yourself to go the bathroom so ‘Castiel’ can show up?”
Dean rubbed his hands together gleefully as he watched Jimmy Novak take a seat at an empty table in the middle of the food court. This was finally his chance to ask him out.
From the mischievous look on Dean’s face, Sam was sure Dean was going to disgust him with a very explicitly detailed play by play in the morning.
“Maybe so,” Dean said. “But I’m still grateful for the help. I’m not a big math guy, but you made everything make sense. And it would only make sense if I spent more time with you to see what else you could teach me.” He smiled winningly. “You want to go out for drinks sometime? It’ll be my treat.”
like these, the hardest adjustment for him is that he can't just press his fingertips to whatever monster of the day it is and be done with it. He takes the machete Dean offers him, and looks away awkwardly when his fingers brush Dean's.
Dean reaches forward and puts a hand on Cas' knee to stabilize himself, and Cas lifts his right hand up to fit against Dean's shoulder. They both fold hard into each other until the laughter dies down, and when it does Cas moves his free hand to cup the line of Dean's jaw. Dean closes his eyes and leans into it.
After a few minutes of companionable silence accompanied by intermittent crunching, Dean takes a long breath out. "Look, about earlier,"
For the next several days, that bled into a next few weeks, Dean had a harder and harder time finding completely reasonable reasons. But still, they hadn't talked.
They pull apart, only a few centimeters, only enough space to take a breath in. Cas feels it. He feels Dean start to slip away. Deep in his chest, where his soul would sit if he had it, and for a moment he thinks he must have one. Must have grown one for this moment, just to feel it hold onto Dean's. Cas blinks hard at the tears burning in his eyes to push them away, he wants to take it all in. He doesn't want to miss a second of looking at Dean, not if these are the last ones he'll get.
I'm adding this here to assuage any fear of sad foreshadowing that in my version of Supernatural they do get happy endings - and maybe even the other stuff too.
The elevator dings, and he trudges through the sepia lights of the lobby to the blonde wood-grained door of the laundry room. He balances his empty basket on his hip as he jams his key in the lock, turns it, and jostles it slightly to make the door nudge open.
. With a want. He realizes he likes it considerably better than all the other times he's been kissed, and wonders if that has to do with the situation or the gender. He thinks on it as he pushes Bar Guy's jacket from his shoulders, and figures the answer is probably both. Maybe-Chris or Maybe-Mark's hands wander to Cas' tie and pull it off.
Cas looks up, and makes direct eye contact with a man carrying a laundry hamper, who also happens to have just made it to the very
"Dean," Cas whispers, and takes Dean's face in his hands. Dean lets his arm fall away from Jack and drops it around Cas' hip.
The guy scoffs and turns to sip his drink. Then says, with a truly incredible amount of courage or idiocy, "Whatever. Know not to get involved with a jealous boyfriend when I see one."
Somewhere caught up in an epiphany and half Dean finds a second to register they should probably - very quickly - get the hell out of there.
Cas sighs and looks a bit forlorn at the reminder. "Yes, mostly, though some things are more agreeable than others."
“What do you think about her?” Dean asks, and that knocks Cas out of his reverie. He traces where Dean’s eyes are looking and they fall on a woman smiling and talking with her friends on the other side of the bar. Short, dark hair, light eyes, wearing a crop top and a tight skirt.
Cas nods again and gets a painfully soft look in his eyes that Dean can't look at, not quite yet. Cas wants to ask
The woman leans in and laughs at Dean’s pick up line. Cas lets out his breath and it turns into a sigh. He watches them chat for a few more minutes, and he’s fully
That makes Cas' ears burn, but he uses his grace to will the visual effects away. He figured Dean would have Sam or Jack share the couch with him, so he's surprised at Dean's off to "break it in'' with him. Cas feels a blush start to form again;
you- I'd never seen him so mad before. And he wasn't, um, he wasn't scream and throw things and throw
had long and tense arguments about it in the car before that Cas always feels a bit ashamed of post-fight. It’s not Dean’s fault, not like he
"No," Dean says firmly, he needs Cas to hear this, because it's feeling like it might be the last chance he gets to say it. "No, hey, you're not useless, Cas. And we don't keep you around- I don't keep you around to be useful anyways. I want you around because I want to be around you."
Cas' face heats, and he rubs an awkward (non-underwear-holding hand, thankfully) across the back of his neck. "Just, lucky you, I guess."
Cas had promptly forgotten about it, distracted by everything else that had happened in the past few days.
Still vulnerable, and back to looking worried too, Cas says, "I have shown interest in "dudes", as you put it, though you are right to say you haven't noticed it."
After a few more minutes of label ripping and dirty looks, Cas sees Dean start to walk toward him with his arm wrapped around the same woman from earlier.
"Just call the business number any time of day. I'm the one who gets the phones so," Dean shrugs again, "works for now, right?"
. He opens the door and is met with Cas standing next to one of the beds hastily taking his shirts out of his duffle bag and throwing them down with a rustle and a soft
"Come on, come here," Dean holds his hand up a bit, and when Cas steps close enough he lays it over his heart.
" And he buries his face into Dean's hair, grasping at him, like if he pulls hard enough he can put him back together like he did before. "God,
at the two of them over there now. Her hand is on Dean’s shoulder, which makes something raw and tangled spread through Cas' chest.
Dean trips slightly on the way out of the portal. That's probably because Sam sighed and pushed him in when he turned back and started to say something like
Now, he lays in the dark for a few dozen minutes. Not-Dean is already dozing off next to him. He knows it's considered rude to leave - and he is quite comfortable - so he lets himself fall asleep too.
Dean slips into the seat in front of him and slides one beer across the table, Cas catches it on instinct. "So," Dean starts, "What's the plan for tonight?"
Bar Guy laughs, "Yeah, maybe," he licks his lips and leans a few inches further into Cas' personal space than he's normally comfortable with (with people who aren't Winchester’s or Winchester adjacent). "But I was gonna say, the best way to get over someone is to find a
Dean holds up two beers in triumph as he weaves his way back to their booth, the smile on his face crinkling the corners of his eyes.
"Hey," Dean says. Cas startles, and quickly sets his phone face down on the table in front of him. Dean, blissfully, doesn't seem to notice.
Dean saunters over with bravado and false confidence. He obviously gives the woman some cheesy pick-up line. Cas holds his breath for a moment. It’s not like he wants Dean to get rejected, it’s just that he’d rather Dean would come home - back to the bunker - with
Cas brings his free hand up to rest on Dean's cheek, "I want to say, that despite what your father might have believed, there is absolutely
"So, Cas," Dean says, the nickname slipping out as easily as if he'd said it a million times before this - as easily as if they were already old friends. "You make a habit of perving on guy's underwear and then shouting at them at 3 in the morning, or am I just lucky?"
someone he'd developed since then that made this hit way too close to something he didn't want to think about). Dean blinks and looks over at the clerk, then immediately does a heel turn and marches off towards Cas, burying his red face in the collar of his jacket.
Cas opens his mouth to politely decline, but something stops him. Maybe it's the half a beer (unlikely), or the potential truth in the man's words (less unlikely), or the way he's thinking about how right now Dean is probably making out with that woman in the backseat of the Impala (much more likely), or the flecks of green he's just noticed in Bar Guy's eyes (very likely) but-
Dean waves him off. "Yeah, yeah, whatever." He sits down on one side of the new (old? New to them) couch.
Cas takes a few seconds and then he's opening his door, too, and standing behind it to shout after Dean who's walked a good few paces down the road and is holding a hand over his mouth.
"I love you too, Cas," Dean breathes, and leans forward to close a gap he hasn't closed since he was a teenager. Cas meets Dean in the middle and closes that same gap for the first time in his long, long life.
"You know," Cas says, when they pull apart and rest their foreheads together. "Sam and Jack don't expect us back until the afternoon."
But Dean's looking at Cas and Cas doesn't see him. Just looks right past him. No, not quite past him - just looks at him like he's not
"Dean's straight." Cas cuts in, pointedly, but with an edge to it that makes Dean's brow furrow and his head turn in Cas' direction. "Now can we get our keys or not?"
. Just, after. It's only Dean and Cas sitting at the bunker's kitchen table now, and Cas gets up to walk to his room without a word (because he thinks he's been playing it off pretty well but really he's scared out of his mind to be alone with Dean, scared for the other shoe to drop). Dean gets up too, and Cas' heart flips when he realizes Dean is
than his worst nightmare, actually, because nightmares and just bad dreams. This though? This is very, very, very real.
A matching smile spreads across Dean's face at hearing Cas' voice. "It's by flavor, dude, which is why you don't get it," Dean turns and reaches down to swipe the bowl out from under Cas, leaving him with just a sugar-crusted spoon to tap against the solid wood of the table. "Molecules, right?" Dean asks, as he drops the bowl in the skin.
Before Cas can finish he watches Jack reach his hand around Dean's back and pull him forward, putting two fingers to Dean's forehead at the same time.
Cas feels a tear roll down the side of his face, and he realizes he was so focused on hearing every word Dean was saying he didn't notice he had started crying too. He wipes his face with the back of his hand and says, "Dean, you know tha-"
That's it! This is definitely one of the longer things I've written and I ended up being mostly happy with how it turned out. Hope you guys enjoyed! (Or if you didn't I hope you find something else that you do). Thanks for reading!
Update 4/30/2021 - I reread this recently and I realized I forgot to add in that Dean also picked up a few guys post-clueless induced coming out like I wanted to so I went back and added it in. It's probably because I wrote this whole fic wildly out of order lmao. Anyways, epilouge next chapter!
It's unclear who moves first, how it happens, but in a moment they're pressing their lips together. It's a soft thing, anything more and they might break under the weight of it. The grief that this is all they'll get. All they were allowed to get.
Third: since all the machines are always open, that means he can dry his clothes without waiting for the
). He's partway through his third beer of the night and Dean is slamming down his second with a tall blonde woman a few tables down.
Dean just smiles over at Cas. For a moment it's just that. Just them smiling fondly at each other while white font ticks by on a black background and their pinkies brush at the bottom of the popcorn bowl. If real life were like the movies, they'd kiss right now and the credits would roll. Cas lets himself imagine it for a second - picture perfect and tastefully shot. Maybe Dean would cup his cheek or run his hand through his hair. Maybe they'd press their foreheads together after and breath each other's air until they kiss again. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Always maybe with him, with him and
Dean turns hard around and shrugs Cas' hand off his arm, marching back towards the man while pushing his sleeves up. "Okay, that's it."
"I thought that the more people I tried it with the easier it would be to get this picture of you out of my head, this picture of you where you were
to accept it. "Don't leave me, Dean. Please, I can't do this without you. Don't make me do this without you," and Dean moves his hand to wipe away the tears that track down Cas' face.
He quickly adds, "Even if it's Sam. Though, I'd probably question your taste in men. I know he's tall, Cas, but there's better fish in the sea, okay? Trust me."
Dean suddenly starts to pat his own pockets. "Look, I don't have a pen on me but..." Dean pulls out his wallet and rifles through it for a moment before pulling out an off-white business card. "Here," he says, holding it out to Cas between his middle and index fingers.
me the whole time. And I can't believe you didn't know that. I can't believe I never had the guts to tell you before. But-" And Dean's pacing, he's determined to lay it all out because he needs Cas to know this time. He needs him to really understand. Needs him. Fullstop, if he's being honest. And, right now, he is.
