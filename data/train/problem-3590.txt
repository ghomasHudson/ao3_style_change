Physically, the sensations were new, too. The wet feathers slipping through his fingers, the scent that numbed his brain, the pulsating suction around his erection… But Dean’s body felt strange, too. Out of control, predatory… base, driven by instinct alone. His dick was like a frigging steel rod, huge and heavy, and there was an odd pressure in the base of it. His vision whited out every time he pushed the spot inside Cas, like his prostate had moved to the base of his dick. It would have worried him if it didn’t feel so fucking good.
Cas was achingly hard, his erection red and bobbing under Dean’s gaze. His balls were smooth and lovely, drawn tight to his body. But Dean’s attention was drawn lower, to the tight globes of Cas’ ass, glistening with the slick substance, and to his entrance. While Dean watched, the opening fluttered and a trickle of the transparent liquid flowed out. The fresh scent of it hit Dean right in the face and his dick gave a painful throb.
The following day, they stayed focused on the case. It only took them a few hours and two terrified, embarrassed victims to find out that the ghost was the spirit of a woman, who had been cheated on by three different boyfriends. She had died in a car accident while running away after catching her latest boyfriend in bed with her own aunt. Her chosen victims were all unfaithful men, but luckily none of them had died yet.
Castiel tried to hold still under Dean’s voracious scrutiny, but he could not stop himself from shifting from foot to foot. The small movement was enough to startle Dean and pull him back from the strange stupor he had seemed to have fallen into. Redness spread over his face at an alarming rate, and he started to wave his hands in mid-air.
Somehow, he almost felt cheated; he hadn’t been allowed to make his own choices, only to copy Dean’s. His new toiletries and clothes felt depressing, dark and boring. Was this an omen of things to come? Would his entire mortal life be painted in hues of black and grey, dark blue and dark green? With the occasional spot of color in the form of blood stains?
Dean smiled back. His lips were trembling. “And I don’t find male bodies ‘distasteful’. Kinda the opposite, really. I mean, I don’t go around advertising it and I haven’t done much about it, but… yeah. Uh, equal opportunities and free love and all that,” Dean mumbled. Even though Castiel did not quite understand all he was saying, he did understand the meaning.
The way Dean touched him was nothing like Castiel had imagined. Instead of rough, impatient, cursory touches, Dean’s hands were timid, slow and careful in their movements. He caressed Castiel’s arms and sides, moved his fingertips over his clavicles and pectorals.
“This is hardly your fault. The town had a gas station. I can walk back there and be here with gas by morning.” Cas’ hand was already on the handle, when Dean finally had a presence of mind to yank it back.
Castiel was fairly sure he heard Dean whimper. Was he injured after all? The leather crinkled as Castiel watched Dean squirming on his seat.
Castiel did not think the words were meant for his ears. The tone was perhaps not the most loving, but the words still made Castiel’s heart leap and left him feeling warm and content inside.
Castiel watched as Sam smirked at his pancake tower.
It felt like hours before they were finally back at the car. At least Dean seemed to be back to normal, or close to it, now that the feminine clothes that bothered him so much had been packed away in plastic bags.
Castiel had eaten his Snickers bar and drunk one quarter of his water bottle by the time Dean emerged from the restroom. Dean’s face was still flushed and judging by the way the man walked, his legs were wobbly and weak. There was a small grin on his face that disappeared the second he saw Castiel, replaced by embarrassment and a hint of guilt.
A wet, frantic sound made him force his eyes open much sooner than he would have liked.  It was worth it when he saw the glorious sight of Dean leaning over him, face flushed and sweaty, pulling at his own erection with desperate, frantic movements.
“Dean… Dean, we shouldn’t…” Castiel mumbled. The words were cut off by a breathless moan as Dean’s hands brushed over two hard nubs located somewhere around the base of the wings. The feathers around them were sodden and Dean’s fingers became covered with slick, oily substance.
Cas’ fingers paused on the spot where the bite had been, deep in thought. “What about your penis?” he asked.
Dean pushed his boxers down to his knees. The sight of himself made him pause: he was bigger than he had ever been, his erection hard enough to hammer nails. He shuffled forward on his knees and slid his heated length through the warm slick substance still dripping out of Cas. He pushed against the fluttering entrance, testing it with a gentle thrust.
Dean snorted. “Fuck no. There’s a pile of hot wings calling my name in the fridge. I’m gonna find something on Netflix, stuff my face and veg out on my bed in my underwear,” Dean said, “Wanna join me? We have a metric ton of nachos, too.
There was a larger-than-life signpost about five meters ahead of Impala’s bumper, advertising a gas station about half a mile away.
Castiel sat down and took the remote, ignoring the way Dean was gaping at him, mouth open and the nacho still in mid-air.
They drove in silence for close to an hour, long enough to leave Lexington far behind. The original plan had been to return to the motel and check in for another night, but Dean had driven right past it without a comment. Guess they were driving through the night again.
“Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?” Dean asked.
“Okay. Okay? Good. Yeah,” Dean finally managed to mumble. Distantly, he wondered if this was the moment to kiss Cas.
“Cas, Cas, wait… what is…” Dean asked. He sounded panicked and confused, but for the life of him, Castiel could not look away from the tempting, twitching flesh in front of him. His hand hovered only inches away.
Dean let out a quiet groan and sunk back onto the chair. He groaned and winced again.
Castiel resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Dean had quite a few opinions on what “grown men” should and should not do. Or men, in general. They weren’t supposed to watch porn with other “dudes” in the room. They weren’t supposed to like caramel or pumpkin spice lattes. They weren’t supposed to eat fruit and salads. They weren’t supposed to enjoy watching romantic movies. It was, in fact, getting quite tiring.
Castiel blinked in surprise. He had not expected Dean to agree, and even less agree to continue so soon. Of course, Castiel was not going to say no. Maybe the next time, he would actually get to touch Dean. He swung his legs out of the bed to stand up.
_______________________________
Dean cocked his head towards Cas’ basket of fries and Castiel nodded. Dean finished the fries in a few minutes, and after that they were ready to start their misjudged mission. While Dean was driving towards the nearest Wal-Mart, Castiel fiddled with his phone and resented Sam who had managed to avoid this endeavor by faking a headache. Castiel was sure Sam had been faking, because he had overheard Sam and Dean earlier and no one with a headache could tease their brother as mercilessly about romantic Wal-Mart dates as Sam had teased Dean.
“And, uh, the orgasm was weird. Like, I couldn’t stop coming, and there was a lot of stuff. Like, a lot. And I wanted to bite you. I needed to bite you. I don’t usually do… that.” Dean swallowed the need to explain what a considerate and gentle lover he usually was. His eyes travelled over to Cas’ neck, where the bite had been, and his disappointment at seeing the skin unmarred again was both surprising and visceral.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said, hoping that the note of triumph could not be heard from his voice. Perhaps, after he proved to Dean that scents did not have a gender, the man would let him buy whatever he wanted.
“Oh. Oh! Uh, fuck, that’s…that’s just… great. Look, I’m gonna…” And then Sam was backing out of the room, his expression somewhere between horrified, nauseated and joyful.
At this point, it was a very familiar sound to Castiel, one that accompanied many of his morning showers. And that was why he backed out slowly on silent feet and took great care to close the door without a sound. In a daze, he walked over to a nearby crop of trees and pulled down his zipper to relieve himself there instead.
They did not want to risk opening the doors to the freezing wind, but crawled to the back one by one and sat close to each other, sides pressed together. It did not help much. Dean’s toes were starting to become numb again.
But Dean only saw Cas’ bared neck. Helpless to stop himself, he bent forward and clamped his teeth around the thick muscles and sinews, bit deeper and tasted blood.
“You should not have been able to smell me. Only alpha angels…”
“She is coming,” Castiel warned Dean only seconds before the ghost materialized on the other side of the grave. Castiel shot at the apparition and it disappeared, but he was sure that it would not stay gone for long. The woman had looked enraged.
Castiel could feel his lips stretching into a smile and turned away from Sam to hide it. It seemed like his hypothesis had been proven correct. Dean did find lingerie arousing enough to ignore Castiel’s male form… and closed garage doors, apparently.
Castiel squared his shoulders and walked closer. Finally, Dean noticed him. The man froze in the middle of pushing a salsa-covered nacho in his mouth, and a large glob of the red sauce fell off the nacho, splattering all over Dean’s chest.
“Jesus, it’s too fucking cold to think… Come on, backseat. At least we can huddle for warmth or something without the steering wheel in the way,” Dean mumbled. The suggestion made his face turn red.
“Dean, no! No! You did no such thing, I wanted it. If anything, I coerced you, although I did not intend to. Or perhaps we were both victims of our instincts. Instincts that you should not even have. I still don’t understand what happened. Did you really smell my scent?”
Finally, the pillow slipped free of Dean’s fingers and Castiel slid it over the man’s lap. Dean gasped and moved against the mattress restlessly. Castiel pushed the pillow aside and could not look away.
“Dean! Dean, I’m going to…” Castiel’s voice sounded strange, strangled and breathless, but Dean understood him.
“No, Cas, you can’t wear them. Men don’t wear those kinds of things, alright?” Dean said to him. His voice was angry, but curiously high-pitched, and his face was still very red. Castiel looked at the pile of colorful discounted underwear (Three for the price of two! declared the sign), and then back at Dean.
Castiel glared at him, but the soft fondness in Dean’s eyes gave him a pause and made his heart thump almost painfully.
“No, no, no, they don’t… they look stupid on men. They look much better on women,” Dean said. Amazingly, his ruby-red face turned a shade darker. Castiel was starting to get worried about his health. Dean also refused to meet his eyes and his Adam’s apple bounced up and down as he swallowed compulsively.
“Oops,” Castiel said, stood up, took a few steps into Dean’s direct line of sight and bent over to pick the nacho up.
“Yeah, those things are better than electronic blankets. Christ, Cas, they are massive…” Dean watched in wonder at the glossy feathers. Some were fluffier than others and Dean’s fingers itched to touch them. Many were also damaged: bent, twisted at odd angles. Dean wanted to soothe them, set them straight.
If he had been in full possession of all his mental capacities, Dean might have recoiled in disgust. But now, he only realized that the enticing scent had deepened further. He drew his hand back, watching at the substance in fascination.
“Can you stop that? I’m trying to sleep,” Castiel snapped. Part of him was ashamed of his irritated tone, but he could not help it. Ever since he had become human, Castiel had noticed that being tired often made him feel inexplicably angry.
“What happened?” Castiel’s voice was even rougher than usual and he was shivering, too.
Castiel narrowed his eyes and decided to ignore Dean. He sat down and pulled the closest newspaper over.
“Dean. Dean! Calm down.”
In the dim silence of the car, with the slight scent of Dean’s sweat and aftershave only inches away, there was nothing to occupy Castiel’s mind. Over and over again, his memory played the scene of him walking into the restroom and hearing all those quiet sounds of pleasure.
It worked. Dean let out a long-suffering sigh and allowed Castiel to drop the shirt in their cart. Castiel felt victorious. He stepped deeper into the wonderful jungle of colors and patterns, ignoring the way Dean called after him in a hushed whisper.
For an entire episode, Castiel watched the way Dean’s eyes flickered between the TV and Castiel’s lap. Then he leaned over and picked up a few nachos, purposefully jolting the pillow resting on Dean’s lap.
Dean started to hum some mediocre rock tune, and his off-key rendition and the resulting irritation helped tame Castiel’s arousal. As his blood returned to his head, he began to consider the strangeness of the past hours.
The thought alone made Castiel’s heart jump and his stomach contract in pleasant arousal. Dean was, without a doubt, the most beautiful man Castiel had ever seen, inside and out. Exploring his sexuality with Dean would be fulfilling both physically and mentally. It would save Castiel from the odd sense of emptiness and shame his encounter with the reaper April had left him with.
And then he did, back bowed and all muscles trembling. He released spurt after spurt inside his panties, already wet with Dean’s saliva. His orgasm seemed to last forever, and its intensity stole the last of his breath.
Dean was over forty years old, far past the age of unwarranted erections. He was fairly active, but his eating habits were very poor and he was, at best, a heavy drinker and, at worst, a functioning alcoholic. In short, he should have been suffering from the first signs of erectile dysfunction. And judging by the fact that Dean’s interest in one-night-stands had been decreasing at a rapid speed and that he tended to choose Netflix and a plate of nachos over hitting the bar more and more often, it was obvious that his sexual appetite was not what it used to be. Thus, Castiel found it quite implausible that the man had reached a stage of such intense sexual arousal without any kind of stimulation.
Cas handed Dean his clothes, now dry and even clean, but he did it without looking at Dean.
When they were down to their underwear, Cas wrapped his trench coat around them both and placed his suit jacket on their knees while they sat side by side. His slacks were wrapped around Dean’s feet.
“Yeah, but… I didn’t…” Dean stuttered.
Cas thrashed against him and cried out, bent his back and bared his neck as he came again, adding to the slickness between them. He pulsed and tightened around Dean, locking him in place, trying to milk him for all he was worth.
“Dean, we cannot stay like this. You will die of hypothermia. Your body temperature has already dropped dangerously low and I am worried about your extremities.” Cas reached for Dean again, but Dean swatted his hand away.
“Holy fucking hell you smell so fucking good,” Dean growled.
It took a while for Dean to find a good rhythm, the best way to move his talented fingers up and down the hard shaft while tonguing the sensitive head, but when he did, Castiel knew it would not be much longer. Still, orgasm built differently than when he was alone, in fits and starts, ebbing away only to come back a little later, stronger. And when Dean let out a moan loud enough to rattle the door and Castiel saw the way Dean’s hips were moving, fucking thin air in search of some relief, Castiel was suddenly there, on the brink of it.
“Ah, yes. Sharing body heat. I saw that in a documentary,” Castiel said.
“’m not looking,” Dean mumbled. Sam started to chuckle. Castiel stared Dean in silence and marveled at the deep red color on the man’s face.
It worked. Dean became more and more relaxed around Castiel until they were almost back to normal. Dean was able to look him in the eyes again and no longer blushed bright red if Castiel walked around without a shirt on.
Castiel was getting frustrated and tired of waiting for Dean to crack. It was obvious that the man had quite a bit more practice at ignoring his desires than Castiel himself. The thought that Dean may have been sitting right next to him with an erection was enough to make Castiel feel the first stirrings of arousal. He did not want Dean to notice his excitement, at least not until he was certain that Dean was aroused, too.
Dean did not want that. He pushed his hands into the sodden feathers and started to spread the oil on the wings. He ignored Cas’ strangled sounds and the fervent twitching of his wings. He spread the oil across the long, hard feathers and on the smaller, fluffier downy feathers below them. He dug his fingers in and rubbed the oil and the scent all over Cas’ wings. He wanted to rub that scent all over himself, too.
“Huh, always thought you were more of a shorts kinda guy,” Dean said. A small blush was onlymaking its way over his cheeks and Castiel could not help staring at it with fascination. Surely commenting on another man’s underwear was something “real men” weren’t supposed to do?
The back of Cas’ boxers was soaking wet.
Dean spluttered. “What the hell, man? You can’t just ask… and anyway, you know my penis, it was just inside you.”
“Explain why the hell you’ve spent over 200 dollars in Victoria’s Secret,” Sammy spat out and threw the receipt onto the table.
“Hey, nice shirt, Cas,” Sam said.
For several moments, they only stared at each other, eyes wide and with terrified half-smiles on their faces. Castiel was still unsure what was allowed and what was not; he only knew what he wanted the most.
“Actually, my wings are on the small side for an angel,” Castiel said. He sounded hesitant, even embarrassed, but Dean was too busy with admiring the iridescent play of colors on the wings to pay his tone any mind.
“As for the fit, it is quite obvious that I, uh, ‘pack something extra’, but it feels very comfortable. Fitting in my testicles is sometimes bit of a challenge, but they feel very well protected, cradled within the soft material.”
Cas was wet and warm like a woman, but now woman had ever smelled like this. No woman had even swallowed him down as greedily and hungrily as Cas’ body his fingers. The mere idea that Dean’s cock would be in there soon was almost too much.
“Can I see?” Dean asked. His voice came out low and husky, almost like a growl. His muscles were taut, every sense focused on the angel in front of him. Aggression and desire warred in Dean’s mind. He had never felt like this before, this powerful, determined, hungry.
“They are much more expensive, that’s what they are! And you sure as hell are not going to wear them outside the bunker,” Dean said.
Decades of hunting life had conditioned Dean to always be conscious of his surroundings the second he woke up. This time, though, consciousness came slow. First, he became aware of the smells of a car: leather, metal and gasoline. These were accompanied by a sweet, almost familiar scent that he could not place. It was fresh and pleasant and Dean inhaled deeper. His mouth watered and his dick gave an unexpected, interested little twitch.
They were on the road by midday.
Socks were easy enough: black and identical so that pairing them would not be a problem. Underwear was more challenging. Now that Castiel was human, the loose boxer shorts Jimmy had preferred had started to feel too… unsupportive. He chose a couple of pairs of tight-fitting boxer briefs, instead, after spending quite a while staring at the “novelty” briefs. The pink ones with the text “trouser snake” and a horrendous image of a vaguely penis-like anthropomorphic snake were disturbing, but Castiel quite liked the lime green ones with a bee and a text “I wanna bzzzz you”. However, they did not have his size, so he left them in the rack and went to drop his 5-pack of black and grey boxer briefs into the cart.
The whole night seemed unreal, like some fever dream. Without the tremble in his muscles and the highly vivid memories of the mind-blowing orgasms, backed up by the emptiness of his balls and the decidedly used feeling of his dick, Dean might have believed he had imagined the whole sordid thing.
The choked moan Castiel heard from behind him was very satisfying. He straightened his back and looked at Dean, fervently hoping that Dean could no longer control himself and his lingerie fetish.
“Dude, what the hell? Stop rubbing that shirt or we’ll get kicked out for being some kind of pervs,” Dean hissed at him. A hot flash of anger went through Cas and, for a second, he really wished he could still smite. He turned around to stare at Dean, who, to Cas’ surprise, took a hurried step backwards.
“Are these intended for women, too?” Castiel asked.
“You can’t go around smelling like… I don’t know, like fucking daisies and blueberry pie. That’s weird for a dude,” Dean said as he pulled out a black bottle of men’s body wash with the word’s Anti-Hangover on it. He dropped it into the cart.
“Dean!” he shouted and gripped at the edge of his seat.
Cas shifted and clenched around him again. To his horror, Dean felt his dick give another twitch, felt the heat pooling in his stomach again, felt his balls rising up.
Later on, Dean would blame his next words on the brain cell-frying orgasms and his uncomfortable arousal. He didn’t really even stop to think, before he opened his mouth.
Dean was staring straight forward with wide, glassy eyes. His posture was slumped. He had folded himself over the steering wheel, which he was gripping so hard his knuckles were white.
“Yes. I am,” Castiel said, decisive and firm, and took another bite of his apple. Dean took a deep breath.
“Yeah, he’s fine. Apparently, he forgot to lift the garage door and backed right into it. The car’s back bumper took most of the damage, so it’s not that bad. But I don’t get it. Dean’s not usually like that. Shit, it seemed like he was dreaming with his eyes wide open,” Sam said.
Castiel rolled his eyes at the dark window. Why could they not leave this topic behind them?
“These look very supportive. And the color is much nicer than in the ones I picked,” Castiel pointed out.
“Take your shoes off,” Castiel said. Dean didn’t argue. His numb fingers fumbled with the frozen shoelaces but he finally managed to get his shoes and socks off. Cas manhandled him with ease, pulling and twisting so that Dean’s back was against the Impala’s cold door and his legs were on Cas’s lap.
“Fuck, Cas, just like that…” Dean murmured in encouragement at Castiel’s unskilled movements. Dean’s breath sounded harsh, almost like panting, and he was rubbing his erection against Castiel’s hip. Suddenly, he shifted his position, rolled to sit up, and Castiel worried that he would leave. But instead, Dean shuffled over Castiel’s leg, pushed his thighs further apart and settled between them, leaning over Castiel’s lap.
Forty-five minutes later, Dean could no longer feel his toes and his fingers were getting pretty numb, too. That was not good. Very not good.
Towards the end of the first episode, Castiel leaned back. His t-shirt rode up and Dean’s eyes dropped down at his crotch and stayed there.
“Dude. No,” Dean said, and he sounded so strange that Castiel turned to look. Dean’s face was almost scarlet and his eyes were very wide as he stared at the piece of clothing in Castiel’s hands.
For a few, long seconds, Dean only stared at him and Castiel stared back. Dean was frowning.
“Uh, don’t go upstairs. Or into the garage. Dean crashed the Impala and he’s pretty… well, you can guess.”
Dean could feel his higher brain functions shutting down. “You have a self-lubricating ass? Wait. What? Penetration? You mean you’d be the one to…”
Sam let out a surprised laugh. “That you do,” he said and went back to his newspaper.
With slow, measured movements, Dean leaned to put the plate of nachos away. He picked up a pillow and placed it on his lap.
Castiel placed the pair of green underwear in front of his crotch and tilted his head to examine them. Dean let out a high, whimpering sound, which Castiel has never heard before. Perhaps his friend was coming down with a cold and had a sore throat.
Dean tried to go harder, slipping in the slick space between Castiel’s legs. Hands grappling for purchase, he pushed his hands behind Cas and buried his fingers deep into the sodden feathers.
“Christ, fuck, I’m gonna lick it all up, yeah,” Dean gritted out through clenched teeth. Then he let out a hoarse shout, and something warm splattered over Castiel’s thighs and stomach. Looking down, Castiel saw the stripes of white covering his skin and his panties, almost hiding the mess inside.
“Dunno. It kind of seems like she ran out of gas, but the meter is half full,” Dean said. He looked out of the window into the dark night. The nearby trees swung in the harsh wind and the windows were fogging up. Dean wrapped his arms around himself. He had no desire to go outside to pop the hood. Again, he tried to start the car. Nothing.
Dean pulled the zipper of his jacket shut and leaned his back against the seat, staring at nothing. Castiel had scooted as far away from him as possible, had pressed his side against the door, head hanging low. The sight made Dean’s insides squirm with terror and nausea.
“Dude, you can’t wear that,” he finally said.
Hope you enjoyed!
But everything else had sucked ass, big time: Sammy had stayed behind, because this was not a three man job and he wanted to spend more time with Jack. This would not have been a problem, but the ghost had thrown both Dean and Cas into a freezing lake. Their phones had been their pockets, and now they had no way of contacting Sam, since Dean had apparently become a lazy idiot and the batteries of all their back-up phones were dead and the chargers were at the bunker.
Castiel made to stand up, but Sam waved at him to stay seated.
“I would be the one to carry the fledgling, yes,” Cas said calmly.
All of a sudden, Cas pushed aside the cloth surrounding Dean’s feet and touched the skin there. His fingers felt like a burning brand against Dean’s skin and he jerked his foot away. Castiel let out a dissatisfied sound and before Dean even realized what was happening, the angel had pushed him down on his back on the seat. Between one blink and the next, Castiel covered Dean’s body with his own so that they were pressed together from head to toe.
Still, lives were at stake here, and Castiel was more than willing to push aside his discomfort to help others. They packed up and spent the whole day driving, arriving at Lexington a little before midnight. As Castiel had expected, the drive had been uncomfortable and they did not talk much. And when they arrived at a motel, Dean asked for two rooms without even looking at Castiel.
“Jesus, I haven’t come that hard since high-school,” he said, and instantly Castiel felt better. Granted, he had not done much besides lying still, but it seemed that Dean was pleased.
“Sometimes, I find it very hard to understand your brother,” Castiel muttered, petting the smooth surface of his shirt to calm himself down. He was tired, exhausted, although he had not been awake for more than an hour.
“Fine,” Castiel said. It seemed reasonable: wearing the “wrong kind” kind of clothes would draw attention, which they could not afford in their field of business. But if the women’s underwear, or “panties” as Dean called them, turned out to be comfortable, he would wear them whenever he wanted. After all, what Dean didn’t know, could not annoy him.
Cas was watching him worriedly. “Did you notice anything else that was different from your usual sexual encounters? Specifically about your own reactions, your body? Any… aggression, for example?”
Castiel put away the slippery piece of cloth he was holding and picked up another pair of underwear. They were forest green, with a beautiful lattice of ribbons on the sides and a small black bow at the front.
“Burgers it is. Buddy, you really need to start making decisions for yourself. Grown men don’t just let everyone else make their decisions for them,” Dean said.
Dean let out a weak chuckle and wiped his hand over his face. Had Castiel’s performance been so bad that it was laughable? Before Castiel had the time to fret too much, Dean turned to look at him with a lazy grin on his face.
Dean remained quiet for a long while. His eyes raked over Castiel’s body and he licked his lips before finally taking a deep breath. “Yeah. Yeah, alright. Get… get on the bed.”
“Not really. I mean, I’ve always been more than adequate, but I was really, really hard and eager this time around. And there was spot near the base that felt real sensitive, real good,” Dean said. He cleared his throat and crossed his legs, because the memories were arousing enough for his dick to try and get going again. It was a traitor and an insatiable freak.
“My penis?” Castiel asked. Dean closed his eyes and sighed, but he was smiling, so Castiel was not too worried.
“We don’t have a sleeping bag,” Dean pointed out because obviously that was the issue here. Still, Castiel was already slipping off his coat. Dean was starting to shiver even more violently than before, so he decided to stow his crap for once and shrugged out of his canvas jacket.
Castiel bit back a sigh. “Yes. Not only are they supportive, but the material also feels very pleasant against my skin. And I must inform you that you were wrong: they fit me very well.” He added the last bit out of spite, but Dean did not say anything. Castiel heard the dry click of Dean’s throat as the man swallowed. He looked over.
Dean groaned against the table, still hiding behind his hands. “Honestly? This? This is the man I choose to love?” he mumbled, sounding exasperated and mortified.
“Perhaps you should stop looking, then!” he shouted back. To his astonishment, it did shut Dean up – and also made him flush scarlet. Sam snorted.
For some time, they both lay there in silence, trying to catch their breath. Castiel was uncertain what to do. Should he leave? After his unfortunate “one-night stand” with April, the reaper had solved the issue by killing Castiel.
“Shut up, Cas,” he muttered and took Castiel’s mouth again, presumably to keep him from talking.
“You like wearing them, then?”
Sam had dug out a slip of paper from the trash and he was staring at Dean with an angry look on his face.
“My instincts were very much triggered, yes,” Cas sighed.
Dean took a few deep breaths and opened his eyes. He did not look very happy, and as Castiel continued to stare, his frown only grew deeper and deeper. He didn’t look angry, but confused. Castiel stood still, uncertain whether he should return on the bed or escape to his room.
It still didn’t help. Castiel’s clothes were drier than Dean’s own, but still damp and cold. Even though Dean’s right side was warm, pressed against Cas’ warmth, his left side felt even colder. His toes were completely numb again. Even the secret thrill of being practically naked and pressed against Cas did not manage to heat Dean up.
By the time Castiel became human, his wings had been useless for such a long time that he had been ecstatic to get rid of their weight. But maybe…
For some reason, this did help Cas to calm down and concentrate. Dean came back an hour later, sullen and quiet, and an hour after that they had two leads: a haunting in Denver and a possible werewolf in Oklahoma City.
“Yeah, that’s it,” Dean murmured as he twisted on his side to face Castiel. Castiel saw him looking down. Embarrassment seemed to color the man’s face when he saw his own state of arousal, which was confusing to Castiel. He, too, had become erect, but he much preferred seeing a hard cock over a flaccid one. It certainly looked more impressive.
Worriedly, Castiel contemplated his own need to urinate. These bodily functions were one of the most disgusting parts of humanity, and he usually ignored them for as long as he could. But Dean hated granting unnecessary toilet breaks and if he planned to drive through the night, perhaps it would be best if Castiel relieved himself now.
True enough, the ghost was back before Castiel could reload his shotgun, just as Dean flicked open his lighter, and it charged at Dean. Castiel didn’t even stop to think: he leapt forward to put himself between the ghost and Dean, and then he was suddenly flying through the air.
Castiel took his time with washing his hair with his new, unscented shampoo. He enjoyed the feeling of massaging his scalp. He enjoyed his new shower gel even more: the fresh scent of Springtime Birch did remind him of spring, the beginning of new life. He scrubbed generous amount of the liquid into his skin, and was happy to note that the scent lingered even after he rinsed off.
“Don’t stop, Dean, please don’t stop,” Cas gasped. His cock was still iron hard against Dean’s stomach. He was already pumping his hips again, sliding the hot length of his erection through the wet mess on their stomachs.
Castiel blinked. That was practically an invitation and Castiel would not hesitate to take the opportunity.
Dean reached out a hand to steady him. “You fucking idiot. No more using your grace, capiche?” he said sternly, squeezing Cas’ bicep hard enough to make the angel wince.
“Seriously, what the fuck, dude?” Dean asked in a vain attempt of distracting Castiel. It seemed to work; the angel blushed and the massive black wings shuddered and folded behind his back.
On a rainy Friday, Sam got a call from a hunter named Eileen. Castiel had never met her, but Sam and Dean had told him that she was a skilled hunter, and a MoL legacy, like them. She had run into a bit of trouble in Wyoming, her cover had been blown and she needed someone to come and pose as an FBI agent.
They drove in silence.
“Yeah, that too, I suppose. It is a really, really nice penis. But I was kind of referring to you in general.”
Castiel did not want to remove his underwear. That would mean that he would have to leave. Dean would not like to see the obvious reminder that Castiel was in a male body. Still, the feeling of semen cooling and drying on his skin was not a pleasant one, so Castiel slipped out of his panties. He discarded them on the floor while trying to hide his genitals from view.
His dick was definitely about to commit a serious faux pas. Dean grunted and shifted and managed to push his hips aside enough to prevent Cas noticing the growing situation in his pants.
“Oh god,” Dean blurted out, scrambled for the door handle and yanked the door open before escaping into the freezing morning air. He slipped on a patch of ice, fell on his knees with a grunt and tried to find his legs, sliding this way and that like a demented Bambi, before he finally managed to stand. By then, it was too late to flee; Cas had a firm grip of his bicep.
Castiel hit the ground several feet from the grave, face-down. The fall was hard enough to leave him winded and gasping for breath. His ribs felt bruised and tender against the ground. Behind him, Castiel could hear the whoosh of gasoline-induced flames and the screech of the ghost as she burned out of existence. Safe in the knowledge that Dean was fine, Castiel took a minute to gather himself, wheezing and panting.
First touch of skin against skin was a revelation. Castiel shuddered under Dean’s delightful weight and enjoyed the silky glide of Dean’s full lips against his own. He surrendered the reins to Dean, allowed him to decide the pace, because he was far more experienced in this sort of intimacy than Castiel himself.
The show started. Castiel pretended to watch. Dean shoveled nachos into his mouth like a starving man and kept his eyes away from Castiel.
Finally, it was over. Dean panted, eyes closed, every muscle trembling and weak. His heart raced like he had run for hours.
Castiel’s long, choked groan surprised him. The feeling of Dean’s warm, soft tongue against him was wonderful and overwhelming. Castiel’s hand flew to Dean’s neck, maybe to tear him away, maybe to push him closer.
Castiel was no longer an angel, but this was hardly the time to remind Dean of the fact. Castiel lifted a trembling hand to help Dean find his own release, but it was too late.
Still, Castiel was getting tired, the black pair seemed quite supportive and they were the right size. He threw them into the cart, ignored Dean’s quiet whimper and started to make his way over to the cash registers. He had to pause and wait for Dean a few times, since he was walking at a curiously slow pace, crouched low over their shopping cart. Once Castiel even had to redirect the cart, because Dean was staring into it with an intense look he usually reserved for baked goods and willing women and was about to crash into a mobility scooter and its irate, overflowing occupant.
Castiel finished his burger, but pushed aside most of the fries. His appetite was not as voracious as Dean’s and even Sam’s. Perhaps it was because he was slightly shorter. Or perhaps he had not yet built up his tolerance to overly greasy and salty diner food.
“I did not realize scents are gender-specific,” Castiel said, but Dean did not hear the dark note of sarcasm in his voice and only snorted at him. While Dean’s attention was diverted (a pretty brunette was walking by), Cas slipped the bottle of Springtime Birch into the cart. He would have gone with the Milk and Honey, but according to the list of ingredients, there was neither milk nor honey in it, which was highly suspicious.
Later, sitting on his own bed alone in the silent motel room, Castiel reflected on this new tension in Dean and his relationship. He was starting to suspect that perhaps Dean did not like him all that much. At least, not anymore, now that Castiel was human. The thought was rather devastating and kept him awake late into night.
Luckily, Dean solved his dilemma by reaching out one shaking finger and tracing the waistline of his panties, avoiding touching his erection.
Castiel watched him go and reached over and turned the key to switch off the engine. The car plinked quietly in the cool night air. Castiel frowned at the way Dean fumbled with the restroom doors. The man usually had an elephant’s bladder and they had not even drunk anything for hours.
“I am an omega. It means I am able to carry fledglings and give birth. This would require me to copulate with an alpha angel. But these designations are fundamentally redundant as god is not here to…” Cas was rambling, but Dean could hardly listen.
“You did say you wanted to watch Netflix in your underwear,” Castiel said and glanced down at himself. Sitting down, he could only see the old Led Zeppelin t-shirt he was wearing, not the sheer, black panties that covered his genitals. Or rather, failed to cover. Oh, but Dean had caught a good, hard, long look at the panties and was still trying to catch another, his eyes lingering on Castiel’s thighs.
This was, finally, disgusting enough to bring Dean back to himself. He jerked his hands away and scrambled back, throwing Cas off him in the process.
Cas narrowed his eyes in irritation. “You asked.” He turned around and started to march towards the front of the store, not waiting to see if Dean would follow. He only wanted this useless excursion to be finally over.
Dean did not answer him, just huffed to himself.
Castiel was looking at him with concern, the familiar look of guilt all over his face. Dean took his hand.
The wings ruffled again, sending another wave of the sweet scent towards Dean. He inhaled deeply and swallowed down the sudden flood of saliva. He wanted to say something about the delicious smell, but would commenting another dude’s wing scent be some kind of faux pas?
Castiel turned to look at his friend . Dean was decidedly, as they say, “out of it”.
“Well, let’s get walking, angel.”
“Well, that was nowhere near normal sex, you know that, right?” Dean said.
“May I… may I kiss you?” he asked, quiet enough that Dean could ignore it if he wanted. He could not look away from Dean’s plump lips and the tongue that swept over them, leaving them shiny and pink.
“Yeah. Look, do you… do you miss your wings, or something?” Dean asked him, his voice hushed. Castiel looked at him in confusion and then at the shirt in his hands. The wing pattern glittered beautifully under the spot lights.
He was quickly growing erect. Which was not surprising, considering that Dean, the imaginary star of many of Castiel’s morning showers, was masturbating furiously only a few short steps away. Keeping his mind carefully blank, Castiel managed to urinate despite the discomfort. Afterwards, he tugged his still half-hard member inside his satin panties, walked back to the Impala, filled her up and went to pay.
“Smells nice, dude. Uh, really nice, actually,” Dean said.
Cas met his eyes like he heard what Dean was thinking. A shadow of worry crossed Cas’ face, cleared up his lust-darkened eyes. Dean wiped the concern away with a quick roll of his hips, which made Cas groan, tremble and squeeze tighter around him.
“I don’t think you fully understand the seriousness of this situation, Dean. Your pulse and breathing have slowed down and your speech is very slurred. These are signs of hypothermia. I will not let you die of such a stupid, simple reason!”
Castiel readied himself for an argument about proper attire, but, to his surprise and relief, Dean remained silent. Quite obviously so, opening and closing his mouth like a fish wrenched away from its natural habitat.
Something seemed to change, then. The timid touches became more sure, purposeful and gravitated closer to Castiel’s crotch. Dean moved closer, threw a leg over Castiel’s legs and pushed his hips closer until Castiel could feel the hot hardness of Dean’s erection pressing against his hip. Castiel’s breath was growing shorter. He didn’t know what to do with his hands. The other lay limply on the bed while the other was trapped beneath Dean’s lovely, warm and freckled body. Castiel curled it up, brought his palm against the nape of Dean’s neck and left it there after he saw the pleased look on Dean’s face. Castiel carded his fingers through the short hairs and enjoyed Dean’s quiet, content hum.
Castiel felt annoyance bloom inside himself, hot and red. Dean could sometimes be so utterly irritating that it was ridiculous.
Castiel sighed and sat on the edge of the bed. “Some time ago, I realized that you find lingerie very stimulating. I have wanted to explore my sexuality with you for a long time, so I decided to see if your love for beautiful underwear could overcome your distaste for my male body." He didn’t dare to look at Dean, but in the end the silence became too much and he had to see the man’s reaction.
Dean stared at the sight, too, panting, and Castiel thought that he saw some embarrassment creeping in to replace the blissed out look on his face. But then Dean just sighed, gave a small, lopsided and slightly sheepish grin at Castiel and rolled over to lie beside Castiel on his back.
“Stop deflecting, Dean! Did you honestly spend over 200 dollars on some random chick? What, can’t get laid anymore without some serious bribes?”
“Holy shit,” he whispered, “your wings.”
Castiel smiled in satisfaction, confident that this was the end of the discussion about his clothing preferences.
It was clear and slick, felt like super high-quality lube, but it was also warm and smelled so good Dean had to swallow compulsively to keep from drooling.
“Here, let me…” Dean murmured and pushed at Castiel’s shoulder gently until he lay back against the headboard, all uncovered for Dean’s gaze. Castiel tried to shy away, but Dean would not let him and neither did he “freak out”. Instead, he used his own t-shirt to wipe Castiel’s stomach and thighs and crotch clean. His eyes did linger on Castiel’s now soft cock, but there was no disgust on his face, and his touches were soft and careful.
Things came back in bits and pieces. The hunt. The freezing, muddy lake. Impala’s broken gas meter. The all-consuming, numbing coldness. Worry and panic in Cas’ eyes.
Cas was staring at something behind them. Dean turned to look.
Dean blinked a few times, and the confusion slowly cleared from his face. “Are you… are you actually trying to seduce me?”
Dean thought back to that morning, realized that Cas was right and did a quick mental calculation. Shit.
“Dean? Are you awake?”
He wasn’t too happy with the jeans. After a few days of use, they had turned out a size too big and hung low on his hips, below his hipbones, as he had forgotten to buy a belt. The shirt, however, was his favorite. The material felt soft and silky against his skin, which was a blessing as it also clung to his shoulders and chest. The neckline was lower than in “men’s” shirts, low enough to reveal his collarbones. Castiel liked it, because he hated the feeling of something too close to his throat, choking him. The wings in the back were the best part: although Castiel could not see them, he knew that they glittered and sparkled as he walked.
Castiel bristled. He did not like Sam’s insinuations. Dean was a very desirable man, who did not need to bribe anyone to have sex with him. And there was no girlfriend, of that Castiel was sure.
Sam and Dean were already up. Sam was sitting by the table with a large stack of pancakes in front of him, and Dean was manning the stove, pouring the batter into the pan. Castiel stepped beside Dean to reach for an apple sitting in the fruit basket on the counter. From the corner of his eye, he noticed that Dean went still. Ignoring the man, Castiel grabbed the apple and turned around to lean on the counter next to Dean, who was still hovering in place, unmoving.
“I like this,” Cas stated and held the shirt in front of himself. It was supposedly the same size his previous t-shirts had been, but strangely enough it was a lot smaller. He went about looking for a larger size and found it.
With rough hands, Dean pushed Cas’ muscular thighs apart. He pulled Castiel closer, forcing the angel into a vulnerable position where his dick, balls and ass were revealed to Dean.
“And this didn’t strike you as strange?” Cas asked.
“As long as we keep our boxers on,” Dean said feebly in an attempt to maintain at least a shred of his dignity. His dick was about the size of a small shrimp by now.
“I have told you that angels do not have a gender,” Castiel said, looking out of the window, “This was not completely true. We are not male or female or anything in between, but we do have a designation. God gave it to us in case our numbers grew too small, but now that they have, he is not here to activate our breeding cycle.”
Cas frowned at him. “Of course not. As I keep saying, you are not an alpha and I am not in heat.”
“Hey, don’t mind him, Cas. Give him some space, alright? He’ll come around,” Sam said.
This time, Castiel followed Dean without a protest.
Sam was still recovering, when an old hunter friend of Dean’s called about a severe case of haunting in Lexington. No one had died yet, but two people had been hospitalized, and it was only a matter of time before something even more serious would occur. They could not afford to wait for Sam to get back to full health, and Castiel would have to accompany Dean on the hunt.
“Hey, I can get laid just fine!” Dean shouted as he shot up from his chair. He winced again.
“What?” Dean could not have heard that right.
“That’s not the point! I can see your hip bones, too!” Dean yelled. Castiel huffed in annoyance. It was far too early in the morning to get into a shouting match with an idiot who was far too set in his ways.
“Good. That’s good,” Dean breathed.
Cas gave him an irritated look. “I know that. I am not a child, Dean.”
“Dean bought them for us,” Castiel said calmly.
“What?”
“Is it working, Dean?” he asked and tugged gently. For a second, Dean held on tight, staring right at Castiel with wide, nervous eyes.
Obviously, that was not an option this time.
Impossibly, the thought of that, of Cas’ neck covered in his bites, amped his desire even higher, and suddenly his orgasm was right there, seconds away.
Even low on grace, Cas would probably be fine. Maybe.
“Crashed the Impala? Is he okay?” Castiel made an aborted movement towards the stairs. He decided against it. If Sam was telling the truth, Dean was probably a blubbering, screaming mess right now.
Dean swallowed.
“I capiche,” Cas said. Seconds later, his teeth started to clack together.
“I don’t find wearing them sexually arousing. I wore them for you.”
Dean’s mouth fell open and his eyes went wide. Castiel paused, thumb midway to his mouth.
“What the hell, man?” Dean squeaked and tried to push Cas away with hands that felt like noodles. “Get off me!” He tried to make his voice sound gruff and annoyed instead of confused and breathless, but it did not work very well. Cas’ thick thigh pressed between Dean’s own. Dean’s frozen shrimp made a valiant attempt at standing at attention, before giving up because Dean was still freezing.
“Like a cloud, Dean. I will never be able to touch the clouds again.”
“Yes,” he said firmly, “this shirt reminds me of flying through the night sky with wind beneath my wings.”
“Do you have any plans? It is Friday. Are you planning to, um, ‘hit the town’?” Castiel asked, his heart plummeting somewhere to the vicinity of his kidneys.
When it ended, Dean slumped forward, exhausted and delirious, and released Cas’ neck.
“Shit. Cas, that’s…” Dean swallowed audibly and squirmed on the bed. The movement brought him closer and the wet head of his erection touched Castiel’s thigh. He heard Dean sucking in a shuddering breath.
“Fine, but that’s the last one, buddy. That security guard is looking at us funny.”
This was one of the most humiliating things Dean had lived through. “Dunno, man. I guess it was kinda intense. Like, I was intense, really, uh, determined.”
“So, what, me touching your wings and stuff got you going?” Dean asked.
Dean drew back and slapped Cas’ hand away. “Yeah, yeah, only alpha angels are supposed to get with you, I get it,” he spat out. Then he paused and blinked in confusion. Jesus, what was wrong with him?
“Sorry! Sorry! Shit, I gotta…” Dean babbled in a voice so high Castiel wondered if he would wake the bats that lived in the top floors of the bunker. Dean backed out of the door, hitting his shin on the doorframe on his way out and, by the sound of it, slamming his body against the wall outside the door.
“I don’t like them,” Castiel said darkly.
“He… he… for you?” Sam stuttered. Castiel nodded and watched as Dean burrowed his face into his hands.
Fifteen minutes later, Dean forced the coffin lid open and started to sprinkle the salt. The temperature dropped below freezing and Castiel gripped his shotgun tighter.
Castiel already had a toothbrush, but Dean insisted buying a few spare ones. As Castiel’s hand hovered over the beautiful ones, the ones with glitter pink and violet handles, Dean tossed a few with black and blue handles into their cart. Castiel shrugged and trailed after Dean as he picked up toothpaste, a hairbrush, some toothpicks and dental floss.
He tried to go slow, but the second the swollen head of his cock slipped in, Cas let out a happy howl and the angel’s body sucked him in to the hilt. Dean’s balls slapped wetly against Cas’ ass. He nearly lost it there and then, only holding back by the sheer strength of his will. Cas was tight and wet and pulsing around him. Dean could not have pulled away even if he had wanted to. Cas’ body kept sucking him in, deeper still, even as Dean tried to pull back.
“Yeah. Yes. Cas, you can’t… they won’t fit you,” Dean said. He almost sounded like someone was strangling him.
Castiel did not understand why Dean seemed so interested in this particular pair of underwear, when the others had so many more different, beautiful details. The black ones were in fact quite boring: they had no decorations, aside from a tiny black bow and a small fake diamond in the front. Castiel also could not understand the point of the partly transparent material. In his understanding, the purpose of underwear was to cover his genitals. This material would cover nothing.
“I gotta… not really hungry,” Dean muttered and shuffled out of the kitchen.
“Yeah, gonna make it so good for you,” Dean whispered. He started to move his palm, slow strokes up and down, and the entire world seemed to melt away. Nothing mattered but the pleasure of Dean’s hands on Castiel. Not on his skin, of course, Castiel was fairly certain that touching a naked penis would be too much for Dean, but this, this was good, too. Better than good, amazing. Castiel tried to remain still, but he could not help squirming a little, pushing his hips up against that blessed hand.
“Need you now, Cas,” Dean panted, reaching down to get rid of his own boxers. Cas was writhing on the seat, fucking himself on Dean’s fingers and blabbering out a mix of pleas and orders.
“Dude, the weathercast said that the temperature is going to drop below freezing tonight. You can’t go out there, you’ll freeze to death.” Dead did not understand the truth of his words until he saw the worry on Cas’ face.
The warmth of Cas’ palms against the skin of Dean’s feet felt marvelous, but it was also starting to hurt. The deep, all-consuming ache was different to any pains Dean had experienced before. He did not want to think about how close he was to losing his toes.
Dean snorted. “I’m not making any sense? Yeah, right.”
They were both panting heavily. Dean swept his fingers over the hard oily nubs again and Cas let out a strangled sob. He wrenched himself away in an attempt to scramble up. Dean could not let him go, could not stand to be apart and, completely out of it, he grabbed Cas’ ass to pull him back on top of Dean.
When Castiel was still an angel, he was never this tired with Dean. Frustrated, yes, angry, definitely, but never tired of him.
Dean was staring at him with his mouth open. As Castiel looked back, he blinked a few times and rubbed his hand over his lips.
“Nah, not really, I just thought it was so good because I was with you. It’s always better with someone you love.”
Air outside his warm cocoon of feathers and tan skin was still freezing, so Dean allowed Cas and his wings to blanket him. To distract himself from the enticing smell and the increasingly insistent throbbing of his erection, he started to play with the feathers closest to him. It only occurred to him that perhaps he should have asked for permission, when Cas made a low sound and the wings jerked under Dean’s hands. Still, he did not pull away or tell Dean to stop. Dean grew bolder and started carding his fingers through the silkiness.
“Shit. The meter’s shot,” Dean groaned and slammed his fist against the steering wheel. Thinking back, he realized that the signs had been there for a few months now. A tank that was supposed to be half-full had taken in a lot more gas than usual. The meter’s needle had jumped oddly from almost empty to half full a couple of times.
Luckily Castiel has watched enough movies to have one more trick up his sleeve. He did not have a pen, but a nacho would do. He leaned over to grab a few of them and then threw one away, on the ground in front of the TV.
He would have never seen Cas’ wings. Never known the look on his face when he came.
“Oh fuck,” Dean whispered. He took a firmer hold of the feathers and started to move again, reveling in the way Cas was shuddering under him and around him. Dean was drowning in pleasure. Never before had it been this all-consuming, exhilarating, terrifying.
It kept trickling out, pooling into a puddle on the Impala’s vulnerable leather seat. More and more came out. It kept coming until the puddle finally reached the edge of the seat and dribbled over, dripping onto the plastic rug on Impala’s floor.
“Not gonna last much longer… fuck, never thought you’d be like this,” Dean babbled. He tried to tear his eyes away from the tempting flesh that he wanted to decorate with his teeth marks.
Finally, Sam had snapped and insisted that they start searching for a new case, yelling it through the closed door in the morning. So, Castiel pulled on his black shirt with the rhinestone wings and his casual pair of jeans.
“Somewhat different than on women, I suppose,” Castiel said. He felt at loss what to say. “I have taken to shaving off most of my pubic hair, because the slippery materials feel better that way. I also like how the lace looks against my skin, especially in white as my skin is so tanned,” Castiel paused and glanced at Dean suspiciously. Dean’s breathing sounded laborious and he was shifting around on his seat. But he didn’t tell Castiel to stop speaking, didn’t yell “Dude, cross” or “TMI, man, TMI”.
“Look, Cas,” Dean said as he pulled Castiel to lie back on the bed, “I’m not saying that the panties aren’t great. Fuck, they’re fantastic, they look frigging amazing on you. Hell, maybe I’ll even give them a try myself someday. But the thing is, I like what’s inside them even better.”
“Explain what, Sammy?” A few crumbs of toast sprayed out of Dean’s mouth. Castiel licked his thumb and cleaned them up.
Oh, and Dean was good. His mouth was soft and wet and careful, moving over Castiel’s lips. First feather light and then harder, more demanding and in control as he gained confidence. Castiel barely noticed when he started moving his hips, pushing them up and grinding them against Dean in little circles. He only stopped when he felt Dean starting to harden. His mind flashed back to their previous tryst and to the words Dean had spoken at the height of his passion, spurring on his own arousal.
They hadn’t been on a case for over two weeks, and they were all suffering from symptoms of becoming “stir-crazy”. For Castiel, this meant long hours at the firing range or in the gym room and restless pacing around the bunker. Sam often accompanied him when he exercised, and they sparred many hours in the gym. Dean, however, was cooking and cleaning obsessively and consumed copious amounts of alcohol and junk food.
“You’re practically naked in that! I can see your frigging treasure trail, that’s so not okay!” Dean hissed at him.
The car was cramped and their position far from ideal. If they had been on a bed, Dean would have buried his face between the angel’s ass cheeks and eaten him out until they were both sobbing with need. But there was no time for that here, no room either.
Shit, it was like heaven and hell combined. Like he was losing himself, willingly. He was so high on pleasure that it almost made him cry, so desperate to hold back that it hurt.
The feathers ruffled and Cas averted his eyes, which must have been a first. “It was the only way I could keep you warm. Are you warm?” he asked.
However, this time, everything that could have gone wrong, had gone horribly, terribly wrong. Not for the hunt itself: they had ganked the ghost in record time before anyone had died or suffered a severe injury. Even the ghost had seemed relieved to go.
A light blue hoodie made of something so very soft.
Dean dressed in silence. His fingers were trembling and all his muscles felt like goo. The Impala’s windows had fogged up, the steam so heavy that the rising sun outside barely made any difference.
Dean shivered, teeth chattering and all muscles trembling, for what felt like ages. He was exhausted. Keeping his eyes open was a battle he was about to lose.
Dean wanted to argue, but he felt kind of dizzy and his tongue was so heavy. Blackness was creeping into his eyes. He blinked and watched hazily at the concerned blue eyes above him. He blinked again and decided that reopening his eyes was way too much effort.
The relief was enough to make Dean’s tired muscles tremble again. He leaned against Cas’ warm palm. “Yeah, I smelled you. Not anymore. You smelled like pie. Like the best pie. And like good coffee. And sunshine,” he mumbled, closing his eyes.
Dean’s mouth was beautiful, almost indecent in its softness and plumpness. His lips were parted and trembling. As if in trance, Castiel cupped the back of Dean’s neck with his palm and pulled him closer, slow and careful.
“Fuck, Cas, fuck, yeah, come one, sweetheart.” Dean was just as breathless as Castiel, and sounded near delirious, but he still kept moving his hand, stroking his fingers up and down. “Are you gonna come in your pretty panties, soak them through with your cum?”
They ate their burgers in relative silence. Castiel had never quite grasped the purpose of small talk, and Dean seemed to be quite content with his burger, if the pleased, but still somehow annoying sounds he was making were any indication.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I… I needed to warm you up using any means necessary. It seems that bringing forth my wings in this dimension has manifested some other features of my true form.”
“You, uh, you using that Anti-Hangover shower gel I bought you?” Dean asked in a low voice.
A sudden, horrifying thought came to Dean, overshadowing everything else. “We’re not gonna have a baby, are we?” The words came out garbled and high with panic.
“You… you want to?” Dean asked breathlessly. His hips shifted on the mattress again and his erection twitched up, reaching towards Castiel’s hovering hand.
“Uh, you should take those off. Dried cum is a bitch, even if you don’t have pubes,” Dean said. A slight blush rose to his cheeks as he waved his hand towards Castiel’s crotch.
“Obviously,” Dean said with a leer, regretted it immediately and felt his face flushing with heat.
Castiel ignored him again. “Ah, Grimm. This should be amusing.” Castiel hit play.
“Umm, I don’t, uh, what?” Dean stuttered, but Castiel felt the way his swelling flesh twitched with eagerness against Castiel’s and became distinctively harder between one heartbeat and the next.
“I’d even say very good. Fantastic maybe,” Cas said, smiling the little half smile Dean fucking adored. “But Dean, I still don’t understand what is going on. All those things you described, they are alpha features. As a human you should not have any of those characteristics. We really need to get to the bottom of this.”
Still tired and disoriented, dressed only in his most comfortable sweatpants, Castiel made his way to the kitchen. Unlike Dean and Sam, he was not able to stomach a large breakfast and often only ate a piece of fruit or some yoghurt. Dean often nagged at him, but usually stopped when Castiel told him that he sounded like a hysterical housewife.
Dean grunted, desperately trying to hold off a few more moments. He pushed his cock into Cas to the hilt and ground his hips in urgent little circles, rubbing that odd spot of pleasure against the hot, tightening walls surrounding him. He buried his hands in Cas’ wings and sought out those two oily nubs. Dean brushed his slick fingers over them, again and again and again.
“That… that is my wing oil. It keeps my feathers in good condition. The… the production increases when my wings are stimulated,” Cas said. His voice wavered and he was shifting again, like he wanted to get up.
“Son of a bitch, I’m such a fucking idiot.” Dean rubbed his palms over his face. A mixture of shame and guilt made his cheeks heat up. He had been too preoccupied with all sorts of shit, both apocalyptic and personal, to pay any attention to his Baby.
Cas trembled and shook under him for a long while, almost silent in his pleasure. His feathers puffed up and the heady scent of him surrounded them. Dean wanted to swim in it.
“What would you like to watch?” Castiel asked as he navigated to Netflix.
But some things were much harder. As Steve, he had worn any clothes he could get his hands on, slept wherever he could, ate whatever he found or what he could afford. There was no room for hopes and desires, no choices to be made, no decisions.
Dean’s breath hitched and he seemed to shiver. He grabbed at the pillow and held it tighter.
However, Dean was not trying to interrupt him, this time; he wasn’t even looking at Castiel, but the black piece of cloth in his hands. His mouth hung open, which was a curiously becoming look on him.
Jeans were more difficult. Castiel chose a slim pair of dark blue ones and a more relaxed pair in a lighter color. A few pairs of sweatpants followed: he would need to start exercising now that he was human.
Dean put down his slice of toast. “Why the hell you are digging through the trash? You get turned into some raccoon-human hybrid while you were gone?” Dean asked. In Castiel’s opinion, it was rather good deflection, considering their line of business.
They made it ten miles out of the town, onto a comfy stretch of road in the middle of frigging nowhere, Kansas, before Impala started to splutter and cough. Dean just managed to steer her to a handy parking area before the car came to a full stop and refused to re-start. Dean stared at the wheel with his brows furrowed and started to shiver harder as the warmth of the car’s heating system died down.
The rest of him was not faring much better either. Shivers wracked his body every other second. His clothes had not gotten any drier and there was frost on the hems of his jeans. Cas was doing a little better: his clothes were almost fully dry. But his grace was not regenerating, as it was all consumed by trying to warm the angel up and dry his clothes.
“Care to explain, Dean?” Sam asked, waving the small slip of paper in the air. Castiel turned to look at his beloved, who was stuffing his face with bacon without even looking at his brother.
Impala lurched on the road. “Oh fuck. Shit, shit, shit.” Dean whispered the words so quietly that Castiel suspected he was not supposed to hear them. Dean floored the gas and the car surged forward on the abandoned highway. Dean hit the blinker to the right. He swerved into the next exit lane so fast that the car’s rear end veered to right and left with barely any control, nearly hitting a rail on the left. Castiel’s heart lurched in fright.
Usually, a successful hunt made Dean feel accomplished and even satisfied. For a hunter, there was nothing better than a job well done.
Come and say hi on
Dean’s eyes followed the pack and then darted away quickly. He swallowed loud enough for Castiel to hear it.
Of course, since Castiel became human, he had grown used to the many various, interesting, exciting and confusing sensations brought on by Dean’s closeness. But this infuriating itch, the tightness, irritation, tension, whatever it was, was new and only seemed to get worse by the day. It was also much harder to ignore or repress.
Cas threw his head back, baring the long line of his throat. Dean’s eyes zeroed in on it. God, he wanted to bite. He needed to bite. His teeth fucking ached with the need.
“Our clothes. They hinder us from sharing our body heat. In the documentary they took off their clothes and used the same sleeping bag.”
For once, Dean had zero regrets.
“You think that… You wanted… Um, distaste? Jesus…” Dean mumbled.
Dean cleared his throat. “What the hell happened?”
“I’m fine,” Castiel said and started to push himself on all fours, slow as not to hurt himself further. Everything seemed to be in working order. Except for his far too loose jeans, which had slipped midway down his buttocks, aided by the slippery material of his satin panties. Frowning in annoyance, Castiel pulled his jeans up. When he turned to Dean, he was dismayed to see that Dean was staring at his crotch level, obviously having caught sight of Castiel’s underwear.
Castiel had been human for approximately 1.5 days, when he had decided that mornings were one of the most despicable aspects of mortal life. Most humans seemed to be able to face them after copious amounts of caffeine. However, the taste of coffee disgusted him. As Steve, Castiel had had an unlimited access to Gas-and-Sip’s coffee. He had drunk gallons of it, dunking in packet after packet of sugar and cream, because it was often the only nourishment he could get, aside for a few stale nachos he could scavenge at the end of the day.
Castiel pulled away from the kiss, with some reluctance. “This time, when we make a mess, do you want me to make you lick it all up?” he asked.
That had all come from Dean. Fuck, he had literally come buckets. What the hell?
There was an odd, whooshing sound and the air moved, swirling coldly around them. Dean would have investigated more closely but he was too tired.
Now, Castiel was adamant that he would never touch the vile liquid ever again. He had found that a hot (scalding) shower was the only thing that could make the cold, unforgiving mornings seem more bearable. His showers were luxuriously long, left his skin pink, and usually ended with Dean banging on the door and shouting at him.
“Yeah right. Next you gonna tell me you bought some frigging expensive panties for a girlfriend you’ve been seeing for months. Probably works at the liquor store and takes shifts at the wings joint, right?” Sam asked snidely.
“I gotta have you, Cas. Fuck, please, gotta have you now,” Dean mumbled feverishly. Cas moaned again and his legs fell further apart in clear invitation. Dean wasted no time; he slid his finger through the slick mess and pushed it inside. It went in easily and Dean slipped in another. Cas shuddered and ground his hips against the intrusion.
Nothing as exhausting and mundane as this ill-advised shopping trip to “get him some clothes that don’t make him look like a hobo”.
“Dean? DEAN!”
Cas let him. Did not lift a finger to stop him. The thought was exhilarating. The mouthwatering scent only grew stronger the closer Dean got to his destination. His patience was waning quickly. With practiced ease, he tore the soaked boxer shorts off Cas, reveling in the angel’s quiet sound of surprise.
“Cas, I didn’t… did I… I didn’t even ask, did I? Did I… make you? Force you?”
However, Dean didn’t struggle, and when Castiel let go of his hand, his arm dropped and hung limply at his side. Dean looked down and then quickly shuffled behind their shopping cart, crouching down like he was trying to hide behind it. Castiel watched him for a while until he was satisfied that Dean would not try to stop him again. Then he finally started to peruse the discount pile with much more enthusiasm than he had expected from this trip.
Cas wailed, throwing his head back, and arched against Dean. Hot streaks of semen splattered the space between them and Cas tightened like a vice around Dean. Good thing, too, since without the added pressure Dean would have shot his load at the look of rapture on Cas’ face.
Two steps into the muggy warmth, Castiel stopped dead.
“I think we are supposed to take our clothes off,” Cas said.
Dean cleared his throat a few times.
Castiel put the pair into the cart. When Dean tried to reach in and throw them away again, Castiel gripped his wrist. “I don’t intend to show them around, so I don’t care what they look like on me. I like the color and the details. I want to buy them,” he said firmly. He held Dean’s eyes with his own gaze, and pulled Dean’s hand away from the cart, perhaps with a tad more force than he had intended.
Castiel waited for some time longer before he stood up and stretched his hands high above his head. He had his back to Dean so he could not know if the man was watching him. But Dean was certainly watching when Castiel came back from fetching them a couple of beers. Dean’s face looked feverish and he was jiggling his left leg, but he accepted the beer without comment and drank deep, pillow still held firmly in place.
Castiel was at a loss about what to do next. He wanted to touch Dean everywhere, but he did not want Dean to panic and leave. And he did not know the procedure in situations like this. Was he supposed to kiss Dean? Pull the man over himself? Take of his panties and allow Dean to play with them without forcing him to touch Castiel?
Cas was crouching on all fours at the other end of the seat. His face was red and there was a feverish shine to his eyes. He was staring right at Dean’s lap, mouth open and panting. A quick glance downwards confirmed what Dean already knew. He was still rock-hard, pitching a tent, and there was a wet spot the size of his fist on the front of his boxers. He crossed his legs.
Dean got in the car in silence and accepted the coffee Castiel handed to him with a grunt. Then they were on their way again.
Dean stared at the scene in front of him in disbelief. Castiel was a panting, slick mess of feathers and sweaty, cum-stained skin. His legs were still parted, the puffy, glistening opening was fluttering and clenching under Dean’s shocked gaze. As he stared, semen started to trickle out. Dean’s semen.
If they had just bothered to step out of the car last night, they could have been home in their safe, warm beds hours ago. He never would have needed to almost die of hypothermia. He never would have needed to go through the embarrassment and confusion of the past hours.
Castiel finished putting his clothes on, his movements slow and nervous. For some reason, his hands were trembling. Just as he did the final button on his jeans, he heard a loud crash. The walls seemed to tremble. Castiel hurried out of his room and ran along the corridors until he reached the war room.
He swallowed. “Shit.”
“You have a self-lubricating ass,” Dean said again, unable to move past the enticing concept. Cas flushed deeper and his wings fluttered, lowering as if they were shielding said backside. This revealed his flushed and aroused body even more fully to Dean’s hungry gaze. The last few synapses still sending somewhat reasonable messages to his brain (mostly consisting of “what the hell?”) fizzled and died.
Dean’s eyes went wide and the blush that had retreated returned.
Dean’s blush deepened further; he must have noticed his rising arousal, too.
“Um. Shit. Uh, we drove past the motel?” Dean asked.
“Dean, these remind me of how I was free like a tiger, a powerful predator, not bound to this weak mortal form.”
“They are much more beautiful than men’s clothes. Watch the road, Dean,” Castiel said, hiding his smug smirk by looking out of the side window.
“We have not refilled her since Lebanon,” Castiel pointed out.
Cas wandered around the section, feeling quite lost. The dark, boring hues did not attract his attention. He had grown used to the clothes the Winchesters usually wore, so he selected a few plaid shirts, some dark t-shirts and dull-colored Henleys in his size. Dean hummed in acceptance while playing with his phone.
“Sensitive, huh?” he murmured. Then his fingers moved again over the hardening flesh of his nipples, this time with more purpose. The sensation seemed to go straight to Castiel’s groin, and he felt his erection twitch eagerly with every pass of Dean’s fingers.
Dean had not touched himself, Castiel was sure of that. Nor had there been any women around for Dean to ogle, unless you counted the ghost, which Castiel did not. In conclusion, Castiel had to surmise that Dean had been thinking something very arousing.
Dean’s eyes were screwed shut and he was biting on his bottom lip, hands curled into tight fists resting on either side of his thighs. Castiel wasn’t certain if the look on Dean’s face was disgust and he hesitated and remained still, clutching the nacho in his hand.
For a while, Castiel stared after him and wondered if he should go after Dean and try to talk it through. Or maybe he should go and change. If he had known his clothing preferences would become such a major issue, perhaps he could have compromised his comfort…
But perhaps Dean found the idea of panties so exciting that his mind was willing to ignore Castiel’s wrongly-shaped body? Perhaps… perhaps, if Castiel wore lingerie, Dean would be willing to overlook his physical gender? Would he even be amenable to some form of sexual relations?
Only one of the cubicle doors was closed, and behind it, Castiel could hear soft, stifled grunts and choked, aborted moans. There was a definite slap of a palm against concrete wall, and the smooth, damp, flapping sound of skin moving against skin in rapid, firm movements.
A few weeks later, Castiel and Dean were having lunch in the kitchen, when Sam stumbled in, fresh from his shower. He had been back for nearly a week. He had returned from his hunt with Eileen in high spirits, but had soon become a “mope-y, whipped, sad excuse of a man”. Dean’s words, not Castiel’s. Suffice to say, Sam had not been pleasant company, which gave Castiel and Dean ample opportunity to spend some quality time together.
The thought was almost too exciting. Dean had sat there, as hard and desperate as Castiel was now, and Castiel had known nothing. Castiel was happy with his shapeless, dull-colored sweater now. It helped hide the obvious bulge in his jeans.
Castiel shifted around and tried to look for a better position to fall asleep in. A curious scratching sound made it impossible, though. He glanced at Dean with irritation: the man was rubbing his right palm up and down his thigh in an uncharacteristically nervous manner.
Comfortable, stretchy, tight pants with patterns like a tiger. Even Castiel had to admit that they were a bit of a stretch.
Castiel bit back the vehement denial on the tip of his tongue and gathered his courage. “Perhaps. Is it working?”
“Son of a bitch.”
They took care of the two leads quickly. The werewolf in Oklahoma City turned out to be a particularly vicious stray cat, which they took to a no-kill shelter, and then life returned to normal. Normal being insufferably calm and boring.
The final time Castiel became human, this time for good, came as a relief. Angelic powers had become a burden; what once had seemed like a great gift had become something with too much potential for destruction. Humanity suited him better: he could do less damage. And he could feel more.
Soap and shampoo were next. Castiel bought the cheapest unscented shampoo he could find. Most shampoo’s had too strong scents and he did not want them close to his nose. Body wash, however, was another matter entirely. Dean left him alone for a while (in search of condoms), and Cas could actually peruse the staggering selection available. By the time Dean was back, Cas had limited his options to three bottles: Milk and Honey, Springtime Birch, and Lemon Tart.
He marched into the bunker library, intent on finding a case to work on. Sam and Dean were already there, seated next to a table, newspapers spread in front of them. They both looked up as Cas entered the room.
They were full of color: red, light blue, violet, pink. Yellow. There were flower patterns and pictures of birds. Some of the shirts here had text and logos on them, too, but instead of beer and cars they were about love, music and joy.
Before Castiel had the time to process this new position, Dean was leaning forward. He slid his hand down to caress and cup Castiel’s testicles, and then Dean’s tongue was pressed against the crown of Castiel’s cock through the sheer cloth of his underwear.
Sam’s mouth was wide open. Castiel could see his tongue. It was an unattractive sight.
Castiel’s grace had been low since their last hunt. The fight with the ghost and curing Dean’s twisted ankle had drained the little he had left, so he was not able to dry them.
“What the hell?” Dean yelled. He brought his hands closer to his face but saw no trace of anything disgusting. They were still shiny and wet with Cas’ wing oil and it was the only scent he could detect. Fighting against the freaky urge to lick his fingers clean, Dean shoved his hands under his thighs. “Did you piss yourself or something, Cas? Why are you all wet?”
Oddly enough, Dean was not staring at Castiel’s panties, but his face. His lips. For a second, Castiel thought that Dean was going to kiss him, and his heart leapt in joy. But then Dean’s finger travelled over his pectorals and slid over his nipple, and Castiel could not stop the sudden sound that escaped his throat or the way his body shuddered at the touch.
“No wonder she’s pissed. People can be fucking nasty to each other,” Dean panted as he dug deeper into the woman’s grave. Castiel kept watch; luckily the cemetery seemed deserted this time of night.
Castiel drew in a deep, fortifying breath before he entered Dean’s room. Dean did not look up at first, too engrossed in wiping a dollop of cheese sauce off the hem of his ratty old t-shirt. True to his words, he was not wearing pants, just loose light blue boxer shorts that had seen better days.
“And is it… has it always been that big?” Cas finally asked, not quite meeting his eyes. With sudden clarity, Dean realized that Cas was embarrassed, too. It made everything easier.
At least, until they turned the corner into another underwear section.
Dean calmed down. They stared at each other with wide eyes.
“Are you… you gonna wear that?” Dean asked. His voice was breathless and strangled.
“Have you… have you worn the, uh, black ones yet?” Dean asked. His voice was even lower than Castiel’s own. Sudden bout of intense throat ache?
It took him a few seconds to understand his own words, and even then they didn’t really sink in until he saw Cas’ shocked, wide eyes.
Sam jumped at the chance with eagerness that confused Castiel and made Dean chuckle and tease his brother. Equally confusing was the way Sam insisted that this was a one-man job and Dean and Castiel would not be needed. But Dean did not seem worried, so Castiel finally acquiesced, and Sam drove away alone.
“Would you let me touch you, Dean?” Castiel asked, and was surprised to note that his voice was trembling.
They were silent for a long while, Cas frowning at his shoes and Dean stewing in quilt. At last, he could not take it any longer.
However, the final event that cemented Castiel’s theory on Dean’s lingerie fetish was a complete accident. Castiel was putting on clothes in his room after his morning shower, only dressed in black socks and the pair of mossy green panties, when Dean barged in without knocking. He did that sometimes, forgetting that the entire bunker was no longer at his disposal, but this time the intrusion worked in Castiel’s favor. Dean froze at the doorway, his mouth open but no sound escaping. His eyes raked over Castiel’s naked form and finally settled over his panty-covered crotch.
Sam looked up from his pancakes. Castiel looked at him and shook his head minutely. He had given the sharply-scented shower gel to Sam, who had seemed to like it much better. It only took a second for Castiel to decide that Dean did not need to know this. It was far too early to get into a fight with Dean over Castiel’s “weird, pervy” preferences in personal hygiene products.
“I don’t know,” Castiel said. He finally looked at Dean with his beautiful blue eyes, and Dean was hit with the realization that he had never even fucking kissed the angel.
Dean’s faded boxers were tented, the soft fabric drawn tight over the painfully erect shape of his shaft. A large wet spot had spread over the tip of his erection. Underneath Castiel’s gaze it only seemed to grow larger, the hard member inside the boxers twitching and moving with eagerness even without being touched.
Castiel did not know what to say to that. His heart leapt with joy and he could feel a smile forcing its way onto his face.
They both moaned. Castiel’s mouth flooded with saliva.
“Right. Basic toiletries first, they are easy,” Dean said and weaved his way through the confusing maze of shelves and aisles.
The angel inspected his feet closely and then wrapped his large, warm hands around them. “There is no permanent damage, not yet,” he said. “But there will be before this night is over unless we can come up with a solution.”
Castiel was going to, very, very soon.
But what? At what point did Dean have the time to fantasize? They had been fighting a ghost and then they had been driving and talking. Castiel replayed their conversation over in his mind and started to wonder. They had been talking about underwear. For Castiel, there was nothing sexually appealing about a few scraps of cloth, but perhaps Dean found lingerie arousing? Maybe he had what people called a “fetish”?
“Thank you, Sam. Look, I have wings,” Castiel said and turned around to show his back.
Cas reached to touch Dean’s forehead before Dean could stop him. A blessed rush of warmth went through him and some of the wetness dispersed, leaving his clothes just damp instead of dripping wet. But Castiel’s face went pale and he seemed to sway on his seat.
Dean let out a choked sound. “Jesus, man! TMI, TMI!” he hissed.
Stealthily, Castiel pulled out his phone and tapped “lingerie fetish” into the search engine. According to Wikipedia, lingerie indeed aroused many people. But the image search only had pictures of females in lingerie. Castiel’s form was undoubtedly male, holding no interest to Dean.
Other time, Castiel allowed his track pants to slip down so that Dean could get a glimpse of the white lace surrounding his waist. Dean could not tear his eyes away from the revealed strip of satin and lace. Castiel was fairly sure there was a suspicious bulge growing underneath Dean’s jeans before the man turned away.
“I’m not looking!” Dean shouted again. He slammed his newspaper down on the table hard enough to make Castiel jump and stalked out of the room like all the hounds of hell were on his heels.
“This reminds me of the rose bushes of my favorite heaven, which I will never see again.”
“You know, it’s actually nice to have Sam out of my hair for a while,” Dean said. He was going through the kitchen cupboards, probably looking for some kind of junk food.
“For, like, both of you, to use, like, together?” Sam asked feebly. Castiel nodded again and frowned. Sam was not usually this dimwitted.
Cas. That was Cas. What the hell was he doing in Dean’s bedroom?
Castiel had rather thought it was obvious. “To get another pair of panties to wear.”
“You are not making any sense,” he pointed out, not even trying to hide the aggravation in his voice.
“Are these… are these all intended for women?” Castiel asked. He reached a hand out and touched a violet blouse. It was very soft.
Castiel did not understand what was going on. Dean touched his jaw gently and tipped his head so that Castiel had to look him in the eyes.
Indeed, humans were sometimes very hard to understand. Himself included.
Dean had been about to say “get fucked”. Good thing he didn’t get the chance to say the words aloud. Just thinking about them gave him such a vivid mental image that he had to bury his nails into the soft flesh of his thighs to keep from moaning.
Cas was wringing his hands, which was an odd sight to see. He was usually so unmoving, so stoic.
Castiel did as he was told and took his former place on the bed, leaning his back against the headboard.
Dean barely registered the amazement in Cas voice. Working on instinct alone, he swiped his fingers through the slick liquid and shoved them in his mouth. The taste exploded on his tongue, better than any pie, better than anything he had ever tasted. Dean groaned at the flavor, and Cas moaned at the action.
Dean broke the silence so suddenly that it took Castiel a few seconds to understand that he had spoken and a few more to realize Dean was speaking to him. “Wearing what?” Castiel asked to buy himself some time. He knew very well what Dean was talking about. But he really was not feeling up to fighting, again.
“Huh? You tired?” Dean asked. He glanced at Castiel and then quickly looked away again, licking his lips.
“Your ass, Cas. Wanna see it,” Dean said patiently. He was already moving forward, reaching for Cas’ boxer shorts, pushing the angel backwards so that it was his turn to lie back on the seat.
“Dean, please, please, move, please,” Cas panted. He wrapped his arms around Dean, his large palms cupped Dean’s ass and he started to rock against Dean. Helped by Cas’ guiding hands, Dean was finally able to move.
“So what, your gender pisses their pants when someone touches their wings?” Dean asked. His mind was whirring. Cas was still not looking at him, giving Dean the opportunity to sneak a few glances at his almost naked body. Flushed chest. Peaked, dusky nipples. Flat, toned stomach. Tented boxer shorts.
Another t-shirt, this one dark purple with sweet pink rose patterns.
Dean shifted on his chair and winced. Castiel hid his undoubtedly smug smile behind his crisp apple. Sam was rustling something behind them in sullen silence. Castiel ignored him until sudden stillness made Castiel glance back.
“Man, I’m gonna need something to eat first. Pizza or burgers, Cas?” Dean asked. Castiel shrugged. The relative merits of one group of fast food versus another escaped him. Both were unhealthy but quite tasty. Dean had told him that he was supposed the pick the one Castiel had a “hankering for”. He had no hankerings. Food was food.
“I have tried them on. But I don’t understand their purpose,” Castiel said and turned his attention away from Dean. There was a sign advertising a 24/7 gas station that was coming up. Castiel wondered if he could convince Dean to stop there. He was hungry.
