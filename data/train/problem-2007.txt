to Jack?"
"Tell me," John purred as he brought his face closer, their noses almost touching, "what is it about the knife that you love so much?" The soldier's eyes followed the knife as he gently grazed the flat part of it down the younger man's jaw to his neck. It wasn't enough to break the skin, but it was the perfect amount of pressure for Sherlock to feel how cold the blade was.
"You're a good kisser," John said into the comfortable silence between them.
"And you don't care that your wife is shagging other men?" John asked.
Sherlock almost walked into three different people as he added John to his favourites list. Now he knows why this is the 'Happiest Place On Earth.'
John used two fingers on his left hand to lift Sherlock's face to look back at him. "Well, you are cute. Especially like this," he commented. The other man glared, even though he was blushing. "Can I kiss you?" John asked. Sherlock immediately became a stuttering mess. He shifted uncomfortably in John's lap. John removed his hand from his face and placed it lightly on his bare shoulder, "Hey, it's alright. I won't."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Come on, back to the flat. We have research to do." John just huffed as Sherlock signalled a cab, trying his best not to look south of the equator.
John bit his lip. He looked like he thought he did, but with the added bonus of the 'Owned by' statement. He gently brought his left hand to the mess on Sherlock's body. "My, my, my," he spoke, running his index finger through the white substance, smearing it to a perky nipple. He rubbed and twisted it, loving the sounds that fell from the brunet's mouth. "You just look," He leaned down and sucked the other nipple into his mouth, flicking it with the tip of his tongue, then looked back up to Sherlock's ecstasy painted face, "Delectable."
"Something that shows I'm yours," was the response that was whispered back. John smirked and leaned down to start writing.
"Yes, yes, no running off without permission. I'm not a child and he was getting away," Sherlock explained as he gestured to the man cowering against the wall to his right. "Anyway," he continued, "now that we are all here, let's have a chat. Starting with what your wife is planning."
Olivia nodded. "Yes, it started roughly a month ago. I'm a barista at the moment and I was working a late shift and had to close up," she told them as John took notes, "It was minimal at first, I felt like someone was following me, but I thought it was just me being paranoid. Then my friends began to say that they kept seeing someone near me. At restaurants, clubs, my work, the tube."
"Take one before I change my mind."
" Sherlock confirmed. John hummed thoughtfully. "That being said," Sherlock continued, "I don't know if I'm ready for it."
Sherlock
"No need to be embarrassed, John. It helped me realize something," Sherlock assured. John was eager - albeit scared - to hear what this
Sherlock walked up to the stationary line. As he got closer he saw a sign that said, 'Single Riders will be paired up.' He groaned slightly and looked behind him. No one else was in line at the moment, the little number of people there were in line for the swinging ones. Sherlock smirked as he waited for the cast member to signal the next go of the wheel. Teenagers poured out of the moving carts swaying and giggling, others, in the stationary carts, begged for another go as there was only one person in line. The worker nodded and moved the next, and only, open cart down to their level.
"I'm a good shot."
John did not like this plan at all. John would have to wait outside while Sherlock had to seduce
"Yes, it's a long process. Hand me the diffuser."
The Sherlock in his head whimpered John's name and came in his lap, his come painting streaks along his chest. John tightened his hand to mimic how he thought Sherlock's walls would pulse around him and that was all he needed before he came on the shower wall with a low groan. Once blood flow when back to his brain, John realized what he had just done. He also realized that wanking over your best friend who you just confessed love to was a bit.. weird. He quickly splashed water on the wall to clean it before going about washing his hair.
Sherlock thought for a second before saying, "Anywhere but my lips."
Sherlock began to blush and went to retreat back into John's neck. John simply put a hand to his chest. "Stop," Sherlock whined, dragging out the o. John laughed at the sight before him. How someone could be so angelic yet so childish was beyond him. "Why are you looking at me like that?" the angel asked.
"Hm, guess I'll have to keep a close eye on you then, yeah?" John smiled before lifting Sherlock's hand to place a small kiss on the back of it. Sherlock glared, but not his why-are-you-such-an-idiot face, it was his new how-dare-you-say-something-that-cute-I-am-trying-to-be-stoic-here face. Sherlock cleared his throat and walked over to grab his coat. "We're leaving now?" John questioned.
The door flew open to an annoyed Sherlock. He was wearing his purple shirt with the collar and top button undone, his hair was a tousled mess, and he was wearing skinny jeans that made his legs go on for miles. "Done. Happy, now?" he said as he rolled up his sleeves. John gaped at him. A groan came from the taller man as he walked away to put on his shoes. "Don't just stand there like a fish, John," Sherlock chimed, causing John to turn around, "go call a cab."
"And rinse," Sherlock interrupted, pulling back to run his head under the water once more. John groaned while Sherlock laughed.
"You didn't answer mine."
Lestrade nodded, "I'd assume so based on your kit." John looked down to see that he was still wearing the suit. He simply looked back up and shrugged. "Well," the inspector said as they both looked back at Sherlock, "you should probably take him home. You guys can give your statements tomorrow. He looks as if he's about to chin someone." John nodded and said a quick word of thanks before jogging over to his flatmate.
"I don't see you complaining about them."
"So, she's an evil sugar mama?" John clarified. Sherlock lifted his head to look at the doctor, who was still standing at the door. "You don't know wha - alright, a sugar mama or daddy is a person who pays for everything and buys their girlfriend or boyfriend, or sugar babies, expensive gifts, like cars, jewelry, and things like that." Sherlock raised an eyebrow. John waved his hand as he walked to the kitchen, "There were all sorts in the army."
"Oh god, John, yes," Sherlock whispered into John's ear. Listening to the detective moan his name always pushed him close to the edge. Then, when his orgasm was about to crash into him, he bit down on the junction between Sherlock's neck and shoulder. "Fuck, John!" was the response. The scream hit John like a rock as he started to shake, coming on Sherlock's stomach. When he could breathe again, he sat up an looked at the debauched man below him.
Yes, egg in the hole was one of Sherlock's favourites, but Johnny cakes were his number one. John started by reaching for a mixing bowl. Once he was absolutely positive that no remnants of experiments past were in the said bowl, he measured out the cornmeal and water and began to mix them together. The doctor turned chef then added some milk before placing a pan on the stove to preheat.
Tell him.
Sherlock took the paper and returned the smile. "Of course," he purred, "have a nice day, Ms. York." She bit her lip then turned and walked down the stairs. Sherlock shut the door softly. The second the door was closed, he proceeded to move towards the window. He shifted the curtains back to watch Baker Street.
"Don't touch me! Where is my coat? I want it back!" Sherlock spit.
"Remember how we were going to try new things?" He breathed, lips brushing softly over John's. The older man, already getting hard, just nodded and moved his chin up a bit for a kiss. Sherlock moved away slightly, "Well, we don't we try exhibitionism?" his eyes glanced over to the window, "There are still some people out, if they look, they will be able to see you taking me. They can hear me scream your name."
John rolled his eyes, though he started to feel embarrassed for letting his jealousy come through, " I said you seemed to like her at the pub."
they couldn't keep their hands off each other. And, yes, John knew about Sherlock's military kink. He didn't mind. In fact, John adored how he can make Sherlock crumble with a simple sentence in the right tone. The thing was, Sherlock was mostly submissive when it came to sex. His brain would shut off and John would take control. Afterwards, Sherlock would slowly come back online before passing out.
When the restaurant worker answered, he heard what he could only describe as 'the sound of a mobile being smacked out of someone's hand' and laughing.
It was their last day to go to California Adventure. Mummy and Daddy wanted to go on Toy Story Mania, so everyone went on Toy Story Mania. Mummy vs Daddy, and Sherlock vs Mycroft. Mycroft refused to put on the ridiculous glasses on. Sherlock just put the glasses in his lap and leaned back. Though, the idea to relax was immediately ruined when the cart moved and spun on the track.
John chuckled again, "I think you just fell for me. Twice."
Neither of them spoke as Sherlock migrated to the kitchen table without the laptop. Though, John did smirk.
"Before you say anything, yes, I did pay the waiter for the chips. Probably a bit more than needed, but he won't object, being a uni student," Sherlock said.
She gently brushed her girlfriend's soft brown hair behind her ear, "Yup. She seems edgy to everyone else but she's really sweet like sugar." Jade kissed Alina's forehead when she began to blush. John quickly looked at Sherlock. Sherlock scrunched his nose, trying to get the message of
- he made his way into the sitting room to find Sherlock sitting at his desk. He looked as prim and proper as always.
Jack gulped and pushed himself off the wall, "You're Sherlock Holmes," he whispered.
John's eyes widened a bit, "Ok, boyfriend then? Which is fine by the way." he quickly added.
"It's French for
Sherlock shows John (Part of) his hair routine.
John nodded and leaned back down. He gently wrapped his lips around the head of Sherlock's cock. Sherlock groaned as he fell back on the bed but he couldn’t stop his hips from thrusting up into that sweet mouth. John looked up at him and dipped the knife, breaking the skin. A sharp ah! radiated through the room but was immediately followed by a moan. Sherlock willed himself to stay still but another part of him wanted to shake, wanted to thrust harder, wanted to be covered in little marks so he could look down and remember this moment as they healed. "Oh,
. "I've got to go. Bye," He said, reluctantly slipping out from John's arms and playfully saluted him.
John nodded, "Alright, when do we go?" Sherlock took a swig of his tea and stood, heading to the door to grab his coat and scarf.
"Your cock. Fuck me from behind. God, I don't even want to walk tomorrow," He whimpered in response. He could feel the smirk against his throat. Then, he felt the bed shift as John stood and walked to their suitcases. Sherlock didn't even get to pout before John was already pulling off his jumper and vest then returning with a small thing of lube. He set it next to the man on the single queen bed then pulled off the rest of their clothes. Scrambling to help, the young man tugged his shirt off his shoulders and tossed it across the room. Once both were finally naked, John told the other to flip over. Sherlock obeyed immediately.
Sherlock whimpered as John trailed his lips down his body. The army doctor ran his hands up and down his lover's torso gently. He licked Sherlock's hard left nipple before sucking it into his mouth while he teased the neglected one with his hand. Sherlock bucked up as he reached back to pull at his hair. After dedicating a few more moments to Sherlock's sensitive nipples, John continued his trek south until he reached the other man's pants. He gently pulled them off and threw them across the room in the general direction of the hamper.
Caught off guard by the hope in the soldier's voice, Sherlock wasn't prepared for the lurch forward. He didn't have time to stop himself from falling from his seat. He closed his eyes and prepared to hit the wall. When he opened his eyes, he realized that John had caught him. John's face was a foot away from his, his hands were on his hips, and Sherlock's hands were braced above John's head. Both teens turned incredibly red. The cart swung again, and John reflexively pulled him in to keep him from falling backwards. Sherlock looked at John again. This time, instead of Sherlock standing above John, he was now sitting on his lap.
He ran a hand through his hair before heading to shower, willing his eyes to stay forward. John turned on the water to let it warm up as he undressed. He stepped in as soon as it wasn't freezing. The room still smelled like Sherlock's posh shampoo. It was a soft earthy smell, but not like dirt, it was like mint and olive oil. John loved it. He took a deep breath, imagining Sherlock's hair pressed into his face like it was moments before.
Sherlock sat at the bar, seemingly waiting for a drink he ordered. John went to the other side and got a pint, taking it with him to a booth in the back corner so he can see who comes in and out while he keeps an eye on his partner. The bartender gave the younger man a glass whiskey then went off to help the other customers. Just as John was about to look at his watch, Olivia walked in the door.
A few minutes later, John came out of the bar. Sherlock, the bloody magician, came out of seemingly nowhere and stepped in front of John. "How did they act?" Sherlock asked.
"I can bloody well see that!" Jade countered. She left the room to go to the back of the flat and then quickly returned, bracelet in hand. She gently placed it in Sherlock's left hand. Before Sherlock could pull away, she began to speak. "Please, take it back to the owner. Tell them that we are both so sorry. And please, please, please, ask them to not press charges. Alina may be a bit dull at times, but I can't live without her. I need my little sugar skull," she pleaded.
All the while, the little show in his mind didn't stop. The Sherlock in his head was moaning in his ear. John imagined the hands on him was Sherlock's. One of Sherlock's hands roaming around his chest while the other stroked his hard dick. He bit his lips to keep his moans from being too loud. His hand sped up as his mind changed directions. His Sherlock was no longer stroking him but was sinking down onto his lap. John imagined the tight warmth he would be in and slammed his right hand against the shower wall to brace himself.
John cleared his throat louder. "Here you go," he said as he handed the sketchbook back to the young woman. She thanked him but gave him a small glare for interrupting.
!" he yelled.
a person if it is required. And
He turned to see Olivia writing something on a piece of ripped paper, "Call me. If you find anything, of course."
Sherlock gave a mock smile, "Yes, well, that means you need to, well, freshen up, so to speak." John raised an eyebrow. "What is it
A minute had passed before the sound of a door opening and closing emanated from behind John, followed by feet shuffling to seat at the opposite end of the kitchen. John smirked as he platted the last Johnny cake. He grabbed two forks, two knives, and the plates then went to set the table. Sherlock was sitting at the seat he also sat at when he was eating - the one at the head of the table, back to the sitting room - and was wrapped in his sheet. His hair was standing up in all areas and pointing in all different directions.
The moment broke when the computer pinged, signalling a new email. The pair turned their heads to look at the laptop sitting in the black leather chair. The detective jumped from his seat and brought the laptop back to the kitchen table.
"Yes, but not right now."
"Excellent. Now, I trust you will not speak a word of this back to your wife. You wouldn't want her to know you let out her little secret, I don't believe she'll be very nice." Jack's brown eyes filled with fear as he shook his head. "Good, thank you for your help."
"I asked you first."
"Fair point."
Blue eyes squinted back at him. "
The soldier was back in the war, creeping around to save the hostage.
It was Sherlock's turn to roll his eyes, "Honestly, John, we can't show up together if I said I was going alone. Just get the next one." The door shut and the cab pulled away, leaving John on the sidewalk. Cursing under his breath, John hailed another cab and followed after Sherlock. Case or no, he was ordering a drink at the pub.
It was another person, about nineteen though he was slightly shorter than Sherlock, with dusky blonde hair. It was partly bleached from the California sun. His slightly tanned face turned red as he made eye contact with Sherlock then looked down. "Come on, I don't bite," Sherlock spoke. He turned back around and sat down on the right side of the cart. He heard a shuffle then felt the cart shift as the other teen climbed on. He sat across from Sherlock and looked out towards the water as the worker closed the door.
"Sorry! I had to get something cleared up," he said before sitting at his desk. The detective let out a groan and leaned back in his chair. Greg raised an eyebrow at John before he waved him off. "Alright then. Let's get your statements."
Sherlock put his notebook and pen back down on the desk, "John, I think I have our next kink planned."
Mummy skated over the comment, "I believe there were a few restaurants that way," she spoke as she pointed to the right. Sherlock looked back at the Ferris wheel. Mummy and Daddy hated heights, and Mycroft hated fun, so it would be a nice way to get away from them and have some more alone time.
"You want me to what?" Sherlock asked his boyfriend. It's 10:13 in the morning and the couple was still lying in bed. The younger man had his head propped up on the older man's chest.
-----
John turned the computer to himself so he could read it.
"Yes, yes, I will have her come here at once to talk more," Sherlock told him, immediately typing up a response. John gave a small smirk then stood to clean the dishes. At least Sherlock ate some of his food.
"Sherlock, we talked about thi-" John started as he glared at the taller man.
She let out a tiny gasp, "That's right. You two are," gripped Sherlock's curls and pulled his head back to expose his throat better, her lips ghosting over his cheek, "
John placed the kettle down on the stove, "That's ridiculous."
Sherlock texted her a few hours later saying he would take the case. She messaged back almost immediately saying how, um,
"Just, give me a second. I wanna try and save this little picture." He said, holding up his free right hand. The blonde's eyes scan the naked body.
"Mm, ask me again when I can move my limbs." Sherlock yawned. John pecked his lips then got up to get a wet flannel from the bathroom. When he came back, he stood there, just staring at the man almost asleep in the bed. "What is it?" the man asked, moving his head to the side to look.
"How did you do that, by the way? I mean, I know you just looked at me, but still, how did you narrow it down?" The future soldier asked.
A small tsk escaped the soldier, "Sherlock, seems like you're distracting a couple people. What'd you say we finished this little show for them?" Sherlock rapidly nodded his head in response as his precome made the pillow under him wet. He let out a hiss as the lovely fingers left him feeling empty. John coated his palm in a fresh layer of lube and grasped his hard cock. He moaned and pulled himself softly, staring at Sherlock's open and waiting hole. "I love fucking you, you know that? The sounds you make, the way you look, god, the feel of you wrapped around my prick is heaven." He said as he lifted the brunet's hips and lined himself up. "Ready?" He asked, rubbing the head again the waiting entrance.
Sherlock panted from his spot on the bed as he spread his legs. "Fuck, yes."
"How about your forehead?" John suggested. Sherlock looked up at him as if he had just cured cancer. Like he couldn't think of something as simple as that. His mind must be more out of control than normal, John wondered. The detective nodded. A smile spreading across his face, the doctor moved some stray curls from Sherlock's forehead and pulled him close. His chest began to ache from how gently the kiss was. His lips barely pressed against Sherlock's forehead once, twice, then lingered a third time.
But he looked so small and sad.
When he was done reading, John looked up at Sherlock. "Ok, email her to meet us-" He started, but Sherlock grabbed the computer away.
Sherlock cleared his throat, "I will act as if I really
With his eyes squeezed shut, Sherlock yelled out John's name as he came. John swallowed quickly but allowed some to drip from the corner of his mouth. He lifted his head and smirked."Now we're both marked, huh?" John chuckled, licking his lips. "You still with me, love?" he asked softly.
"It's being held as evidence," said a rookie cop off to the side.
John set his book down and placed his hands on Sherlock's hips, "Um, why? Are you not ok with the vanilla sex we have?"
Sherlock and John find a new case and John discovers a new nickname for his love.
"I have a sketch of him," She corrected as she reached into her white backpack and pulled out a sketchbook. Oliva opened to the correct page and handed it to Sherlock. He looked at the picture. Not much older than Olivia, squared chin, hair shaved on sides and spiked up in the center, thick eyebrows, plush lips, soft eyes. Objectively, one would find him attractive.
"Unlikely. Now, Olivia," he said.
John rolled his eyes and turned back to the box. Inside was a green hand-looking object. There was a nozzle at the end and small opening across the, well, fingers.
A smile stretched across Sherlock's face and he put on his gloves and scarf, "Of course!" John stood, snatched his coat from the hook, and followed his gorgeous man out to the street to get a cab. John sat back as Sherlock told the driver the address.
? "By the way," Sherlock interrupted, "this is a high-end restaurant-"
"Bed. Now," he ordered. Sherlock hurried to comply. John followed after him, watching as Sherlock dropped trou on his way to the bedroom. He couldn't stop looking at the perfect arse under those tight black pants. Once they got to the bedroom, John pushed Sherlock onto the bed and climbed over him. Sparks flew when they kissed. They had been together a while, but that didn't stop the fireworks from going off constantly. The younger man moaned loudly, prompting the older man to slip his tongue into the other's mouth. They began to slowly grind their hips together. John pulled back slowly.
. John gave a small nod and grabbed some bread, eggs, and butter.
After a cab pulled up to the curb, Sherlock opened to door for John to climb in. John looked up at him only to see Sherlock staring down the street. The older man got in and shifted to the other side of the car. Once the other man sat down, John said the address, and they were off. Back at the flat was no different than the silent car ride. When they made it to the top of the stairs, Sherlock immediately went to his room. He didn't even remove his coat or shoes.
The teen looked up at the brunet, "Pardon?"
. He opened it and tilted the gel to Sherlock. Sherlock scoop a bit of the product into his hand and, again, repeated the process of smoothing and scrunching the product. Standing up straight, his hair looked curly but still wet. The man grabbed the small grey towel from the box and leaned back over, "I can't use a regular towel. It causes frizz, so I use a microfiber towel." He gently squished his curls.
"What are you apologizing?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and passed the item to John. The detective looked her up and down. "This man, you are positive you have never seen or conversed with him?"
After their success with the first test, John and Sherlock decided to keep going forward with it, but small steps. Though fucking loudly in front of strangers isn't exactly baby steps but what's done is done. And, good god, was it done amazingly. They both agreed it was one of the best orgasms they've had together. They also agreed to only do that in places they were never going back to. Like Amsterdam. Now, for the next experiment.
"Do you like her?" John spoke before he ate the chip.
"Are you ready to g-," Sherlock started but once he looked up at John the sentence died on his lips. John only thought of one thing.
"Pardon?"
First off, her name was not Olivia York, it was Zoey Montenegro. She was a barista and an artist, so she didn't lie about everything. She had arrest warrants in Ireland, Scotland, and part of France. She seduces people, mostly men, then has her accomplice, who happened to be her husband, would steal the money from the victim's homes. Then out of nowhere, they began buying expansive items and staying in five-star hotels when they travelled.
"No thank you, Mummy, I'll stick with this," He spoke as he patted his chest, referring to his black Captain Jack Sparrow shirt with 'Rogue' printed across the bottom, carefully tucked into the top of his blue jeans, "Maybe Mycroft would like it,"
John pulled away till his lips were just brushing the soft skin beneath, "No shampoo?" Another hum, then Sherlock pulled away, grabbing something from under the sink and placing it on top of the closed toilet.
TW: Toxic Relationship
"A vague one, yes," Sherlock stated and he struck the keys of his laptop quickly, "she has informed me that she wants to go to a seafood restaurant called
"Pull over!" John yelled, already moving to get out of the vehicle. The cabbie slammed on the breaks before having an angry soldier yell at him to call New Scotland Yard and say
mould! - when Sherlock received a text from Mrs. Montenegro. She had stated that she wanted to go out for dinner but didn't feel safe unless Sherlock was there.
Tears were running down the right side of John's neck where Sherlock's head was buried. John immediately went into caretaker mode. He pulled the detective close, his right hand tangling into his hair as his left arm wrapped around his waist to hold him in place. "I love you. I love you so much. God, Sherlock, I adore you," he mumbled into his hair.
John walked over from the kitchen with two fresh cups of tea and placed one next to the computer as he sipped on his own. "What makes you think he'll talk to us? From the looks of it, she has him by the balls. He would be scared of us but he's probably petrified of her," John reasoned.
The younger, and more annoyed, Holmes rolled his eyes. Buzz Light-year waved his arms frantically, saying something about shooting the targets the aliens were holding up. The ride when on for a few more minutes then, thankfully, ended. The family of four walked up the staircase, deposited their glasses in the marked bins, then walked through the store.
Sherlock held up his hand, "And as I indicated then, there is no need. Just keep Jada safe."
"Yes. Yes, I did," Sherlock whispered. He shook his head, attempting to clear the fog from his mind. "You're calm as you play with a weapon. You're not worried about getting cut. It's just all around sexy." John bit his lip in response. Sherlock tugged John's jumper out from where it was tucked. John closed the knife and bit the handle to free his hands so he could undress. Sherlock groaned and started to suck on his neck. John pushed him away, causing Sherlock to pout.
He kissed along Sherlock's spine as he moved his finger in and out then added another. Sherlock bit the pillow to keep from being too loud. "No, love, none of that. I want to hear you. I want the town to hear you," John told him and pressed against his prostate. A loud yelp escaped from the detective and his cock twitched.
Curly hair is as much of a curse as a blessing. It takes a lot of products to keep it manageable. In a place like London where rain is very common, you need a lot of styler or gel. Sherlock used the more expensive products to keep his curls soft and pliable. Rain plus curls equal frizz which also equals a certain Sherlock hiding in his room until he can get someone from his network to pick up the necessary items.
John had to come up with a plan quick. "Alright," he whispered. They held eye contact as he released the magazine into his right hand. He kneeled down and placed it on the floor. He then uncocked the gun, letting the bullet clink against the ground. He hesitantly placed the gun down before standing again, raising his hands up above his head. Zoey looked pleased. John cast a glace at Sherlock. God, did that sight hurt him.
Sherlock, obviously a little shocked by the question, looked back at him, "That, uh, not really my area," he whispered.
John's face turned incredibly red at the comment. "Uh, t-thanks," he stuttered. Sherlock nodded happily. "One last kiss for the road?" John questioned. Sherlock smiled and stepped closer, wrapping his arms around the shorter boy's neck, and placing a soft kiss on his lips. Hands settled on Sherlock's hips once again and pulled him slightly closer. The sounds of screaming teens disappeared around them. They pulled apart gently.
The cast member, who had to be the same age as Sherlock, roughly seventeen, motioned him to enter the fixed cart. As he was stepping on, he heard the worker say, "You too, sir," to someone behind him. Sherlock turned as saw who he was talking to as no one had been behind him a moment ago.
He turned his attention back to his partner and the woman with him. The pair were laughing softly. Sherlock suddenly grabbed out his phone and made a face of annoyance. He looked as if he was explaining something to Olivia before standing and putting some money on the bar, probably paying for both drinks. She grabbed his hand and seemed to ask him to stay. He politely declined and moved to leave when she pulled his face close.
it?! Why?" Jade yelled.
"Bye, Sherlock," Was the last thing Sherlock heard before he turned and walked toward his family. He pulled out his mobile and looked at the message. He smiled at the small picture of him kissing John.
Sherlock scanned the message quickly, his eyebrows raising and wiggling at seemingly random points. John thought he looked so cute like this, like a child reading a book they've been waiting for. "Finally," Sherlock stated, shaking John from his stare, "a good client. This sounds like it's maybe a five, but it has potential."
The next day, John was pacing the sitting room while he waited for Sherlock to emerge from his bedroom. They're supposed to leave in two minutes and Sherlock wasn't even ready yet! The soldier stomped over and banged on the door, "Hurry up, you git!"
Sherlock glared at him, "Of course he cares, did you not see him wince? We need to work on your observation skills." John was about to yell at him when Sherlock turned back to the other man, "Do you still have the recordings?"
"Was that really necessary, Sherlock?" John asked as he approached him. Sherlock didn't acknowledge him, just waited for his coat. John rolled his eyes and waited with him. The officer came back with both Sherlock's suit jacket and Belstaff. The detective snatched it from his hands and began to walk towards the main road to catch a cab. John whispered a quick thanks to the young man before chasing after the Sherlock. "Not even going to talk to me?" John questioned. Again, Sherlock didn't look at him.
Sherlock chuckled darkly and looked out the window, "Oh, John. Just when I thought you were getting a bit better a deducing." John had no time to ask what Sherlock meant because he immediately was pulled away from the booth to follow the man who had just left the hotel.
"Don't. I know it looks terrible. I just ran out of-" the younger man started, but was interrupted by lips being pressed against his. The kiss was sweet and tasted like tea.
"It's your eyes. It's the same look others get when they want to baby something they think is -" Sherlock stopped short on his sentence. John raised his eyebrows, encouraging him to continue. Sherlock looked down and pulled his sheet tighter around himself before whispering, "something they think is cute."
"Uh, love, we already bite each other."
"Oh, struck a chord, did I?" She questioned as she moved the knife to open Sherlock's shirt more.
"This is a styler, it helps with curl definition and frizz," Sherlock explained as he pressed the nozzle. A white mousse came out and expanded in the palm of his hand. He sent the canister down and rubbed his hands together. He leaned forward until his hair stood on end. He smoothed his hands over sections then scrunched the rest of the product in. John moved down to watch as his boyfriend finessed his hair. "Can you hand me that jar in the box please, John?" he asked, still upside down.
John braced himself for the next swing, "I asked them if we could be alone together. I guess they took it wrong," He said, "Though, hopefully not, too wrong?" he asked softly.
Jack nodded quickly then brought his hand up to his mouth and made the motion of zipping his lips. John thought to himself for a quick moment then said, "Actually, I don't trust you," before punching him in the face twice, rendering him unconscious. After shaking his hand out, the doctor rose to his feet and walked over to the gun. John slid the tyre iron into his right trouser leg and picked up the gun. He checked how much ammo was in it - it was full - then turned off the safety. "Amateur."
, as most people put it, but I just care for my hair."
John nodded stiffly, "Alright, so why is she doing it?"
The pub was a little crowded for it being a Thursday night, but nothing too bad. John paid the driver and tipped him pretty well, seeing as John might have barked the address at him, and climbed out of the car. He watched as Sherlock walked into the pub. Sherlock had left his scarf and coat at the flat, so everyone, including John, had a view of that round arse in the tight denim. John cleared his throat and entered.
When they arrived at the diner, Sherlock paid the driver then walked inside. There was a small booth in the back corner with a window facing the hotel entrance. The taller man slipped into the booth gracefully while the other man scooted into the other side, back to the wall. A man with a lip ring and eyebrow piercing walked up to the pair. "Can I get you anything?" he asked, grabbing his notepad from the apron around his waist.
The man in the red chair looked up, "Oh? What will it be this time?"
," he whispered, looking at his boyfriend. Sherlock rolled his eyes and threw his right hand over his face.
"Good, but I was going to ask if we were going to contact Lestrade."
Sherlock gave a sigh and a small smile, "Fine." He climbed off his boyfriend and out of their shared bed. He was only wearing boxers, so John just stared at him, his left arm behind his head as he smirked. The detective put his hands on his hips, "Come on, the first step is a shower." He turned, swaying his hips a bit more than usual, and walked into the bathroom. Then John heard the sound of the boxers falling to the floor. He got up quickly after that.
Things get a bit steamy in the bathroom of 221B.
Sherlock gave out a small shudder at the contact. They leaned back and looked at each other. They could both get used to that.
"Why? Would you prefer they be yours?" She asked as she undid another button. "Don't you want to see him? You can have him any way you desire."
Heat rose to Sherlock's cheeks, both in embarrassment and arousal. "You put Captain," He whispered.
John propped himself up on his elbows, "What in the hell are you doing?" He stopped asking questions when the detective crawled on top of him.
John ran to the building and stopped right before a window. He quickly glanced inside but saw no one. He looked at the ground and saw a tyre iron. "Running into an abandoned building with a tyre iron to rescue Sherlock," he whispered to himself as he picked it up, "just like old times." He steeled himself from the memory before slowly opening the door. The only light in the room came from the street lamps outside and the light from under the door leading to the back room.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You heard me perfectly fine, John," Sherlock retorted as he plopped himself in the soldier's lap, "I want to experiment with kinks."
. What are you planning on doing?" He shifted slightly as he saw Sherlock smirk out of the corner of his eye.
John gave a small laugh. "Ok, then. Does this experiment still allow me to give you a kiss?" he asked hopefully. Unable to contain himself, he gave a small nod.
Seconds, minutes, maybe even hours had passed before John pulled back. "Hey, look at me," he spoke softly as he moved his hands to rest on Sherlock's waist. The detective slowly sat up, he picked at his fingernails, casting shy glances at the other man. John looked at Sherlock with nothing but fondness in his eyes. Sherlock's eyes were red, cheeks decorated with streaks from tears, and his sheet had fallen off his right shoulder. He looked ethereal and just - "Perfect," John whispered.
John scrambled for his phone in the pocket of his trousers, which were inconveniently across the room, then ran back. He opened the camera app and lined up the photo. A small click echoed through the room. He gave Sherlock a dopey smile, "Alright, now let's get you clean."
John looked through the container and found a large jar with a green label that read
It wasn't long before they had arrived at the client's house. It looked nice. It was a white two-story with plants on the patio. The two men walked up the large black door and rang the doorbell. "This is a nice place," John commented as he looked around. He reached out with his left hand to lift the green leaf of one of the plants. Sherlock hummed. "Ya know, I would like to have some plants around the flat. Nothing fancy, just a small one," he continued. Sherlock turned to him to say something but got interrupted.
"So, you've never had a proper kiss?"
Sherlock, who was still his bedclothes and blue dressing gown from when they finished a case two days ago, was sitting in his chair. He seemed to be reading something intently on John's laptop. Seeing as there was no longer a reason to yell at the younger man for touching his belongings, there was no stopping it, the doctor simply greeted him as he grabbed two mugs. A small grunt came from the sitting room. "Have you eaten something?" John asked, already knowing the answer. Sherlock looked at him with a face that said,
The man in question whipped his head back around to see Sherlock looking at him with red-rimmed eyes. The sight broke his heart. He lifted his left hand and gently cupped the younger man's cheek. "Don't cry, it's nothing bad. At least, I hope not," he attempted to joke.
"Easy. I have a special skill. Reading people."
"Brilliant." The boy whispered. Sherlock blushed again and looked out the window. He watched the water get farther away. "I'm sorry, I never got your name."
"I love you too," Sherlock said between sniffles. John felt his eyes begin to sting as he began to cry as well. They sat like that for a while, just crying into each other's arms. Nothing else mattered or even existed outside of the kitchen. Nothing but the sound of deep breaths, the smell of cold Johnny cakes and each other.
His phone read that it was four minutes after eight. After sending a quick text of confirmation, John rose from the bed. He pulled his dressing gown on and tied it close as he went down the stairs to make breakfast. John didn't acknowledge the frown that spread across his face when he saw that Sherlock wasn't in the sitting room. He padded across the room and looked in the fridge.
After a particularly bad case, Mycroft had taken their phones and added government grade tracking devices. You would have needed a laptop and three hours of time to kill to disable it. John quickly opened his phone to look up Sherlock's location. The small blue blip was already blocks away, heading towards Somers Town. John ran down the street and hailed a cab. Once he got in, he yelled directions from the GPS on his mobile.
John looked at Sherlock. He was staring out the window, completely focused.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, sending them both into laughing fits. The ride continued to move. The two boys held on as the cart attempted to move them across, laughing all the while. Slowly, the ride came to a stop, but the couple were still at the top. "I guess they're gonna take their time getting us down," Sherlock whispered. He placed his hands gently on John's shoulders.
Sherlock gained a bit of composure before saying, "Yes. I'm just a little hot." He lifted his hands delicately and unbuttoned his suit jacket, tossing it onto the sofa. The detective then decided to unbutton his shirt, saying "Did you happen to turn up the heat…
After hours of research, tea, some jealous glaring, and John taking countless walks so he doesn't strangle his flatmate, the pair found out that Ms. York had lied about more than just the case.
A few days had passed since Sherlock and John talked about the kissing thing. Because of that, things had changed a bit. Every morning John came down and immediately looked for Sherlock. He would kiss him every morning, depending on their moods. If both of them were happy, Sherlock would get a kiss on the forehead. If Sherlock was doing an experiment and John was happy or tired, Sherlock would get a quick kiss on the top of his head. When Sherlock was in a stope, John would place soft kisses on the tip of his nose. Every single time before John kissed Sherlock, John would ask.
"Another doctor asked to take my shift, they needed OT. Now you?"
John didn't pay attention to a word he said. He was surrounded by Sherlock's scent as was watching the man he loved close his eyes in relaxation. The older man set the other bottle next to the first then lifted his hands to meet his lover's, continuing the massage. Sherlock dropped his own and leaned into the touch. "You're gorgeous, love," John whispered. Blueish green eyes looked into his blue ones. John felt his heart skip. They began to close the gap between them, pleasure started to stir low in their bellies. Lips brushed against one another.
A lot of italics in this one. Sorry.

"He's not up for grabs," John said.
"I'm sleeping in tomorrow. Don't try to wake me in the morning unless you have coffee and or breakfast made," John spoke as he shifted, attempting to get comfortable.
If the situation was different, John would have comforted her, but he didn't have time. "Did you see the car?"
Sherlock pulled part of the sheet over his head as the door opened. "Sherlock?" John asked, "Why are you hiding under your sheet?"
John's stomach dropped as he shifted uncomfortably in his chair, "Sherlock, I know you think you're invincible, but you are not meeting up with a woman when we don't know what she is planning."
"Olivia, err, Zoey."
Sherlock fell back on the couch in his 'mind palace' pose, as John calls it, his hands coming up to rest under his chin. "If you're asking if she
John huffed in anger and looked back up. The man had joined Olivia and began talking to her. His posture became tense as she leaned forward, pointing at him accusingly. He seemed to have apologized, making them both calm down. Olivia finished her drink, looped her arm into her partner's, then left.
When Sherlock finally pulled away, you think they would at least pause to breath, he looked slightly flushed.
This is only part of the curly hair lifestyle. There's more, but I didn't want to bore you all.
Olivia's sweet face turned into a scowl, she puffed up her chest slightly.
"John, I don't see the point-" John raised his eyebrows at Sherlock. The man sighed, "Yes."
The man in his lap blushed again, "Like I'm," he whispered. He pressed his lips together like he was trying to find a way to explain it that would make sense to John.
John squeezed Sherlock's hand, "I don't want you to change. I love you just the way you are. But I won't object to you cleaning the flat more often." Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Can I kiss your forehead again?" John asked softly. Sherlock's face turned pink as he nodded. This time he leaned forward and closed his eyes, silently preening. John chuckled before pushing some stray curls to the side and placed two soft kisses on the oft skin before him. They both smiled when John pulled away.
Stake out and chips
Olivia shook her head hard, her hair swinging slightly, "God, no."
Impatient as ever, Sherlock ground back, "Yes! Please, John!" A soft chuckle echoed in the room, then John slid all the way in, short nails digging into those pale hips. Sherlock gasped and moaned so loud, a porn star would be jealous. They stopped for a moment to adjust, then the younger man pressed himself against the other. The bed springs started to creak as John thrust, not wasting a moment of the heat wrapped around him. Sherlock moaned and pressed his head deeper in the pillow.
"Then take one."
John tensed, "Who else has she done this to?"
Mycroft just groaned, "Patience, brother mine, this silly little game will be over soon enough then you can go back to judging all the people on the pier."
"So you can tongue a woman on command, is that it?"
This is where their characters change. I see Sherlock as a disaster gay and John as a soft but reluctant bi. If this isn't how you see them, sorry not sorry.
John's head popped up from the picture and looked between the woman and his flatmate. She pointed her chest closer to Sherlock, her voice slightly higher, and her face softer. Sherlock, on the other hand, made his expression and body language more open. Olivia gently pushed some hair behind her ear and looked down softly. The detective responded by flicking his eyes to her lips.
"Park's? I thought we were going to the hotel?" John asked.
The smell of the breakfast food filled the room when he flipped it. When it was done, he transferred the finished product to a plate, covering most of the dish. He had made enough batter to make two for each of them. While the second to last one cooked, John started the coffee. The aroma of it joined the Johnny cakes in the air.
"But," Sherlock started as John stepped closer, "you, you have to close your eyes." When John asked why, Sherlock didn't know how to answer.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked up at the doctor, "Yes, but we can tell him that he will be safe after his wife is arrested."
Mummy and Daddy exchanged looks. His father nodded, then they parted ways. Sherlock made his way to the wheel, listening to the other kids scream on the roller coaster above him. Now, did he want to go on the swinging or the stationary ones? He decided that if he went on the stationary, he could think better and not have to worry about being thrown around.
. I'm looking it up now to get an idea of the layout and see where the best vantage points are." A few moments later, Sherlock piped up again, saying, "There appears to be a bar in the center of the main dining room." He turned in his seat and faced John, "Alright. You will go in before us and sit at the bar. I'll wait outside for Mrs. Montenegro then head in with her. I will try to steer us to an area you can see. Based on what her husband has told us, she will try to seduce me and attempt to have me bring her here. You will follow us after we leave."
"I should say some-," Sherlock spoke. They both froze and looked at each other. "You go first," Sherlock insisted. John was about to fight it, but Sherlock just tightened his gaze.
The detective cleared his throat, "You heard me perfectly fine. Also, I'll have some tea as well," he said before he turned to go back to his desk. He stopped halfway and looked over his shoulder, "And you may want to calm down a bit before we meet her tonight." John nodded stiffly and when back to the tea.
"That's never happened before," Sherlock interrupted. John looked up at him with furrowed brows. The detective moved his hands to his sheet, pulling it tighter around his body. "No one, not even when I was.." he paused, he didn't want to speak of that time again, "I had never been offered up like that. I was beaten and tortured, but never.. that."
"Why are you home so early?"
The next day, Sherlock had found a case. A man's house had been robbed and only one thing had been taken - an old chain bracelet with an amethyst heart lined with silver hanging from the chain - a family heirloom. "That's all?" John asked as he played with Sherlock's hair on the couch after his boyfriend - boyfriend? Partner? They talked about kissing, not titles - had closed the laptop.
John wasn't the best at hiding how much he hated that she saw the detective as a pay raise. After Sherlock read the text out loud, he looked at John and told him to stop making
Sherlock's hair bounced as his head popped up a little, "Like I'm some kind of small animal." John laughed again, his shoulders shaking with it. Sherlock rolled his eyes, "What?"
"We'll shower in the morning, honey," John yawned in reply. His kissed the top of his boyfriend's head and smoothed down the reckless curls. Maybe this could be one of the experiments John would be willing to participate in. If he survives the embarrassment of having to deal with hotel management in the morning.
"No! Stop right there!" John yelled as he turned to glare at the man, "I am not your sugar baby. You pay for
The coffee was done the same time John finished up their food. He poured the coffee, adding sugar to Sherlock's, then grabbed the salt and pepper. John liked a little seasoning on his breakfast, but Sherlock liked a little salt and lots of pepper. Once their food was ready and plated, John set everything on the table. Sherlock sat at the head of the table, back to the sitting room, while John sat to his left so they didn't bump elbows.
John doesn't think he's ever seen Sherlock so offended. His mouth shaped a little o and his eyebrows scrunched together. He looked adorable, so John just smiled. Sherlock's lips tightened before he swallowed and stood, stuffing his hands into his trouser pockets. "Go shower. You reek of body odour," he spit back, the normal venom replaced with pouting. He then shouted that they would be leaving in an hour as he retreated to his room. John just chuckled, happy that the tone had shifted from work to friendliness, then rose to take a shower.
"We should get lunch," the older brother recommended.
A few weeks had passed since the couple agreed to try… different things. John insisted they set some ground rules and think of a safe word. "Something that doesn't come up in normal conversation. Short and quick," he suggested. Sherlock had just whined. "Alright, how about, uh, glow cloud?" John tried. Sherlock had looked at him like he had grown a third eye on his forehead, but soon agreed to just end the conversation to get to, uh, other things.
Sherlock looked the boy over. His spine was straight, his hands were resting on his knees, his chin up, feet forward. The sleeves of his Monsters University shirt was rolled up to his elbows. He was wearing black combat boots and blue jeans. Sherlock shifted slightly as the wheel started gently moving. "Where are you going?" he asked nonchalantly.
John soon returned to the sitting room and placed a cup next to Sherlock's computer then sat down in his chair to drink his own. "Do you have a plan yet?"
Jack, Zoey's husband, had walked out of Juliette Heights and began to walk down the street. Sherlock, the long-legged git, quickly caught up to him. After a lull in the crowd, Sherlock shouldered him into the nearby alley. Sherlock put up a hand before Jack could shout, "Please don't yell, this is already tedious enough without you making a scene."
The room fell silent, the food was forgotten, the coffee growing cold, everything was still apart from the breathing of the two men in the flat. This time it was Sherlock's turn to break it. Their eyes stayed locked as Sherlock whispered.
"No, thank you," John replied. Aaron sat in an armchair, leaving Sherlock and John to sit on the couch across from him. John sat on one end of the sofa and waited for Sherlock to sit next to him. He was surprised - and mildly disappointed - to see Sherlock sit at the other end.
"Alright," Sherlock said, then his whole attitude changed, "When did you start to worry about your safety?"
Sherlock waved his hand, "The face you make when something is bothering you."
"Oi, what's wrong with my normal kit?" John asked. Sherlock looked him up and down, then looked him in the eye with an eyebrow raised. "Shut up," said John, trying to hold back his laugh. They shared a smirk before Sherlock told John to get dressed. John nodded and walked up the stairs to his bedroom. When he opened the door, he noticed a black garment bag laying across his military made bed. On the floor were black dress shoes.
"No, no, what I mean is I've never had a kiss that wasn't for a case. It was always to get information, never recreational."
true. He was bi, just hated when people assumed that a bi person with someone of the same sex was automatically gay, and god knows whatever the hell Sherlock was. He assumed he was asexual, but with the case and a certain woman from the past, John didn't know what to believe. The cabbie seemed awkward from then on. When they arrived, John and Sherlock got out and stood to the side.
"I'm, I'm busy working something. I'll make up for it when you come back!" It hurt Sherlock to say that, but he could not let his boyfriend see him like such a mess. John gave a small hum of understanding and said bye. Sherlock waited to hear the door close before wrapping himself into a sheet and heading into the sitting room. John had opened the windows to air out the kitchen after Sherlock's latest experiment with rotting cow bones. The humidity caused the man's hair to become even more frizzy.
. The doctor smiled up at the young man standing at the end of the table, "Just a plate of chips, please." The waiter nodded, his brown curls bouncing slightly, and turned on his heel to get their food. If Sherlock was distracted enough, and you got one of his favourites, you can get the detective to eat. They sat in silence for a bit. "Do you think she's smart?" John asked out of nowhere. Sherlock looked at him.
across but he ended up just looking cuter.
"Sherlock, you silly bugger. It doesn't look terrible, it's adorable," John said, running his fingers through the soft hair. Sherlock looked at John, but John was too interested in playing with the curls. "I had no idea your hair was this," He paused and gently pulled on a strand, watching it spring back into its place, "fluffy."
John got out, wrapped his dressing gown around himself, picked up his bedclothes, and retreated up to his room to get dressed. He mentally scolded himself as he pulled on his oatmeal jumper.
"..Yes, I just said so. Also, you've already kissed me there."
harms him, no. She does care for him, but she doesn't show it correctly. She gives him luxury items, like the shoes he was wearing - easily a hundred pounds, but does threaten to take them away. They both most likely grew up in poverty, his situation more severe than hers, so he stays with her because he doesn't know if he can afford the lifestyle that he has become accustomed to without her."
Chase nodded and turned to look at the kitchen table where Jada was getting a checkup from John. "I know, but I must thank you somehow, so," He reached into the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out a silver butterfly knife with black wood panelling on the handles, "I got this knife when I turned sixteen, to protect Jada. Obviously, it didn't help but you did. It's only right that you have it to protect others."
"Doubtful. Reduced sentence probably."
"Oh, Sherlock," he breathed, making his hand speed up to match the pace of his mind Sherlock's bouncing. John's breathing came out in pants before he went back to gnawing on his bottom lip. The pain grounded him for a moment. He ran his thumb over the tip of his cock, making him whimper. Placing his forehead against the wall he brought his right hand down to fondle his balls. "Oh god," he whispered.
Sherlock smirked and sent the photo to himself. He passed the phone back to John, "There you go, now you have my number. Just in case you know of anything else you think I should.. ride."
, John thought.
The brunet chuckled again, "I know it's fine."
"I know that! Why the hell were

Though, John wasn't exactly going to complain about a having a consulting detective straddling his lap while throwing his shirt on the floor. John gently placed his hand on his lover's hip, "I guess I did." After placing his forgotten book on the table beside his chair, John threaded the fingers of his right hand into Sherlock's curls and pulled softly. Sherlock let out a small groan. John picked up the butterfly knife in the other hand. He waved it in front of Sherlock's face until he opened his eyes. He then flipped the knife open without blinking.
So far, the only ride Sherlock preferred was the Pirates of the Caribbean. The line went by quick and the ride itself was long. He loved how the robots moved and how the scenes played out. Sherlock was never going to admit it, but Captain Jack Sparrow was welcome to kidnap him anytime. Again, not that he would ever admit it.
a bloody lie."
At the words, Mycroft glared at Sherlock as he walked out of the store, leaving his brother to deal with their mother. Sherlock put his hands behind his back and looked over the pier. It was a nice afternoon. The sun was out, light clouds, cool breeze. Most people were heading to the other side of the park to get food. Sherlock looked to his left and saw Mickey's Fun Wheel. It looked slightly fun. There were two different types of carts on it. The ones on the outside were stationary, but the ones on the inside moved and swayed. Sherlock watched one cart slide to the other side of the wheel and wrinkled his nose.
John secretly loved taking care of Sherlock, even if it was as small as him consuming something John made. Sherlock's eyes no longer calculating, but warm and relaxed as he drank his coffee.
"Find her stalker," Sherlock said simply, "she must not find out that we know she's lying. We will treat this as a normal stalker case until I can figure out what she and her partner are planning. I'm scheduling a meet up for tomorrow night."
Making his way back to the door from where Jack entered, he pressed his back to the other side from where he was before. John gently opened the door. Peeking through the crack, John could see Zoey.
Sherlock just blinked. His face gave no indication he was scared, but his eyes were filled with fear and his right hand was shaking in John's. "Just tell me," he pleaded.
kissed
"Just get a flannel," he said as his face grew pink. John did as he was told, leaving to the bathroom. Sherlock heard the tap turn on then off a few moments later. He felt something warm on his thighs, as well as a pair of lips following each stroke. The sound of something opening cause Sherlock to look up. He groaned when he saw John had a box of bandages. "John, I am fine. They aren't that deep."
"It was very nice to meet you, John," Sherlock whispered. John shifted when he said his name.
John groaned as the sun poured into his room, waking him up from his deep sleep. He ran his fingers through his hair as he took a breath. A smile stretched across John's lips as he realized it was his day off. Coffee sounded great right about now. The doctor sat up and read the clock on his nightstand. 8:27. He had slept in for about an hour and a half. Not surprising as he had spent the day before trying to keep his eyes open at dinner. His body popped as he stood. After putting on his robe to make sure he was decent, he started the trek down the stairs to the kitchen.
that it almost pushed him over the edge. "I'm close. Fuck, I'm cl-" Sherlock groaned as he shifted his hip. John dipped the knife once more before fondling Sherlock's balls with his other hand. Sherlock shouted as he came, his hips thrusting wildly. John swallowed his release quickly.
John laughed. The whole cart seemed to get brighter at the sound. Sherlock let out a small chuckle of his own. They talked a bit more and realized they were both from London. Sherlock knew John was from the UK, but not London specifically. Sherlock slumped a little as he relaxed. "Hey," John started, "Do you want to go on the swinging carts after this? I kind of wanted to go on it first but there was a lot of people."
Hours had passed and Sherlock had found the culprit. It was a nineteen-year-old girl named Alina who had stolen the bracelet for her girlfriend for their second anniversary. Her reason was that her girlfriend loved purple and it was beautiful like her. Sherlock confronted the girl at her flat, but before he could say anything more than 'I know you stole this,' the girlfriend, twenty-one-year-old Jade, looked at Alina and scolded her for stealing. "You
Sherlock nodded.
, and you never buy me gifts."
, he thought. When he came back to the conversation a few seconds later, he heard, "-but I had responded to her flirting initially. Also, I am the one with the money."
"Alright, where are we meeting her?"
Sherlock connected the two items, "To make this faster, I diffuser. Air drying would take hours. Tedious." He turned on the item to the lowest settings. "Again," He started as he pressed the claw against his scalp, "no heat. Only cold." They stood together as Sherlock worked. He moved the diffuser repeatedly until his hair was dry, which took a good fifteen minutes. "Now, for the last thing," the curly haired man said happily, "is shaking it so it all falls into place."
Their statements had been recorded an hour later - Thanks to Sherlock, the pouty git - and they were once again entering 221b. "So," John began he sat down on the far end of the couch, "what were you trying to say at the Yard?" Sherlock looked at him after he hung up his coat and scarf, an uncertain look settled in his eyes. John's face softened as he patted the spot next to him.
Sherlock tilted his head, "I think I have an idea," he spoke as he leaned forward and brushed their noses together, "If you're amenable."
Sherlock sat at the other end of the sofa, putting as much space between them as possible. He started picking at the sleeve of his suit jacket. John gently placed his hand over Sherlock's causing the man to look up. "Sherlock. I know that neither of us are poster boys for having talks but," he moved closer to the brunet, "whatever this is, I want it to work and that requires communication."
Olivia kissed him. Olivia was kissing Sherlock Holmes. The man, much to John's rage, kissed back. The woman's partner seemed to clear his throat and look away. John took a long pull from his pint and tried his best not to slam the drink down.
"Be careful," John said then walked in. He sat at the bar and ordered a whiskey. It was going to be a long night. A few minutes passed, and Sherlock hadn't come in.
"Nothing of interest to me. Four teenagers stealing medications from their parents, three cheating spouses, two cases of forgery," Sherlock explained as he finished up one of the circles.
It's not uncommon for Sherlock and John to get gifts after solving a case. Tie pins, watches, books, sometimes food, all kinds of things. That being said, it wasn't a surprise when they had gotten a gift from a teenager after helping him find the boy who had abused his twin sister. It was a sad case, the girl had only just turned eighteen and was in a terrible relationship with a boy a year older named Tyler, or what the client called him, Shit Stain.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Safeword?"
"I wanted to ask you a few more questions about the bracelet," Sherlock stated. The client nodded and they began talking. John didn't pay attention that much.
The cab ride to the restaurant wasn't bad, well, it wasn't till the cab driver decided to ask, "Date night?" John couldn't really blame him for assuming that. Two men were dressed up and on their way to a snazzy restaurant on a Sunday night.
, he thought.
"Explain the suits then," John countered, grabbing the bottles to inspect as Sherlock started to wet his hair. Sherlock scowled at him, but it was hard to do when his head was under a stream of water.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and fell back into his sulking position on the sofa, "I know I am not invincible, John. I told her I would be coming alone so she thinks I'm there with a goal of sexual gratification," John began to grit his teeth, "you will be sitting at a booth while Ms. York and I at are the bar. You will need to keep an eye out for our stalker."
British, Sherlock thought. He crossed his arms, "Where are you going? You're sitting as a soldier would, you're wearing combat boots to an amusement park, which no one would do unless they were already used to them or practicing to be, and you're looking around as if you won't see this side of humanity for a while."
"Classy," Sherlock had murmured but accepted the case immediately. They found him three days later attempting to steal his sister away to go to Amsterdam.
"Well, I believe that's all I need," Sherlock said with a smirk. He stood to walk Olivia to the door. John heard the door creak open but looked when he didn't hear any steps down.
"Her husband's name is Jack Montenegro and, by your description of his actions at the pub, he seems to be Mrs. Montenegro's laky," Sherlock stated, still typing away on the computer. "We will go to their hotel today and find him. He will easily be threatened by us and will tell us everything we need to know about his wife."
, John thought. He felt something on his pinkie. The doctor looked down to see one leather-clad hand was slowly encasing his own. John leaned back a little, his face full of playfulness as he moved to hold Sherlock's pinkie with his own.
"You as well," Sherlock chuckled and ran a hand through his hair. They looked at each other and shared a smile. "May I see your phone?"
John glared at him, "Oh, yes, Ms. York. Well," he started as he crossed his arms, "after you two were done tongue wrestling, her partner came by. She seemed to have scolded him."
"Right now," he said and he ran down the stairs. John gulped the rest of his drink down and followed him. Once he was out of the flat, John hopped into the cab Sherlock had called over. "Park's Diner," Sherlock said to the cabbie. The man nodded and pulled into the street.
"Hey, love, I'm going to work, can I have a kiss goodbye?" John asked from behind the threshold.
Sherlock looked mock offended by the comment, "I beg your pardon." John simply kissed him again.
Sherlock has some questions for Mr. Montenegro.
Two days had passed without incident - if one doesn't count Sherlock and John fighting about which shelf in the fridge is for experiments and which is for
John threw the door open and walked in, holding up the gun. "Yes, he is," he commanded. Zoey slid behind Sherlock again, this time pulling out a pocket knife and holding it to his neck. She peeked her head out from behind Sherlock's right shoulder. "Let him go," John demanded as he moved to stand a meter or so in front of Sherlock.
"Fuck, yes! Oh, god, John, brilliant!" He screamed in response. John looked out the window again. The darkness outside made everyone look like dark figures, but he could see that three more people had appeared, staring directly at them.
. And by the look of them, John didn't know if they would fit. "Well," he whispered to himself, "let's give it a go."
"Tell us," he growled. John cleared his throat, jealousy and some arousal attempting to fight each other in his chest.
For John - lovely, beautiful, sexy John - was sitting quietly in his chair, reading a book and mindlessly doing tricks with the butterfly knife in his left hand. He turned and looked at Sherlock standing dumbfounded in the doorway. "Oh, hello there," he said nonchalantly, closing the knife without looking and setting it on the armrest. Sherlock swallowed and he toed off his shoes and shed his Belstaff to hang it.
Sherlock pondered the question for a bit. "On a basic level," he explained, "Yes. She seems to be more clever than most, but nothing worthy of note." The waiter came back and placed the chips on the table then disappeared again. The steam rose to Sherlock's face as he sniffed. He quietly took one, making John smile as he took one of his own.
"Hm, I don't think so," She hummed. She dragged the back of her left hand over Sherlock's cheek, "He's quite smart. I think I'll keep him."
John shoved the chair out of the way to catch Sherlock as he started to tumble. Sherlock fell into John's arms, letting him guide him gently to the floor. "Shh, Sherlock, it's alright. You're safe now. I promise," John whispered as he pulled the shaking man close. He continued to comfort the man as police sirens came closer.
. He picked it up and turned back to Sherlock. A hair dryer was in his hand. "Where have you been hiding-? You know what, never mind," John stated as he handed the tool over.
His hand moved to cup Sherlock's cheek and used his thumb to stroke his cheekbone, "Here?" Sherlock blushed and nodded. John ran a single finger across Sherlock's jawline, "Here?" Sherlock swallowed and nodded. The doctor moved his hand to rest it on the younger man's right shoulder, his thumb softly caressing the pale white skin of Sherlock's throat. John kept his eyes on the pale column of flesh before repeating the question. Sherlock tilted his head to the side and made a small noise. John stared at the skin for a few moments longer. "Last time," John started, his hand moving to run down Sherlock's chest.
Possessiveness coursed through John's veins, "Get your hands off of him."
"I'm not hungry," Sherlock protested. John cut a hole out of the center of the bread. He was making egg in the hole, which just so happens to be one of Sherlock's favourites. Not that anyone knows that. The sound of bread sizzling in the buttered skillet caused Sherlock's head to pop up.
"These are my tools," He said as he opened what looked like a makeup box. Only, there was no makeup. Hair products, a towel, a wide tooth comb, and even a weird claw thing rested inside. He grabbed two white and green bottles and stepped into the shower. John followed after him. "You might think I'm
John tried to think of a plan. He didn't have his gun on him, Sherlock's plan didn’t require a gun and there was no way he was going to get it into a fancy restaurant. Zoey wasn't stupid so she probably had a gun. Not exactly a fair fight. When he looked back at his phone, the blip had stopped moving. "Take a left here," John announced. The driver did as he was told.
"Like what?" John responded, his lips twitching from a smirk to a full smile.
"Flirting."
, makes me record it, then we blackmail them."
"When did you learn to do that?" was all Sherlock could ask.
Jack's eyes widened as he looked to the shorter man like he had forgotten he was there. "Uh, maybe six or seven men over the past two years or so?"
." Sherlock squirmed, attempting to get away from the contact. She pulled back and looked John in the eye. "You know, while he's here, you can do whatever you want to him," she commented. Zoey kept her grip on his hair as she used the blade to pop off the top button on Sherlock's shirt. The detective squeezed his eyes shut.
John just smiled fondly and said, "We did have some downtime in the army, love." Sherlock nodded and swallowed again. "Sherlock, are you alright?" John asked.
"Use your imagination, John. There is more to sexual marking than just that. Example, we can bite till we break the skin. Or you can write on me with a dry erase marker. Or, according to my research on the topic, some people prefer to smear one's sexual fluids on their partner to claim them." The doctor's eyes grew wide at the last two ideas. Though, Sherlock didn't seem to understand why. "What is it?"
Sherlock and John have a talk.
When the doctor was almost done washing himself, he heard someone stomp up the stairs, stay at the top for three seconds or so, then stomp back down. John quickly finished up and wrapped his robe around his body before walking out the door. Sherlock sat in his chair with his phone in hand. His curls falling delicately around his face. John looked his fill before asking what the noise was. "Your outfit for tonight," was all Sherlock had revealed.
"Stop right there," John spoke up. Sherlock looked at him, surprised. The doctor scooted his chair closer to the other man and grabbed his right hand from his lap, holding it in both of his own. "Sherlock Holmes, I will never ever do anything to hurt you. I have before and I hate that I did. But now, I will do everything in my power to protect you."
John released his grip on his boyfriend and leaned back into his chair. "But you called me Captain," He smirked, beginning to mess with the knife again.
"I like it. I'm John Watson," John said. He held out his hand. Nervously, he brunet shook it.
The worker had them stand to the side as they brought a swinging cart over. "Hop on," They said with a wink. The third blush of the day crawled up Sherlock's face. John shuffled on and sat down. Sherlock joined him shyly. Once the door shut, John whispered something along the lines of an apology.
"May I try?" John asked, kneeling so he was at the same level as Sherlock and held out his hands. Sherlock looked at him through the strands of hair.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "Obviously," then his hips against John's. John closed his eyes and gripped Sherlock harder. The brunet cupped the older man's cheek and leaned down the kiss his neck. "It's just that, I think it would interesting. You were my first sexual encounter, so I have no other basis for what my turn-ons are," he spoke between nibbles. John gave out a light hum and leaned his head back.
, not the other way around."
A smirk made its way onto John's mouth. He lifted his left pointer finger and placed it on Sherlock's forehead, "Here?"
"So," He started, crossing his legs and placing his arms on the armrests, "you have a stalker, correct?"
She nodded and swallowed, "Yes. It was a dark blue jeep." John was about to ask if she had noticed the license plate when he remembered something.
Sherlock's been taken. Now John has to get him back.
It's not a secret that John was protective of Sherlock, even more so after the whole Mary debacle. After his lying and cheating wife disappeared, with the baby no less, John started to keep his eye on the other man even more. John didn't want to admit it, but he was silently waiting for Sherlock to leave him for a final time. He didn't
Sherlock leaned back and stuttered, "Do you- Do you really think my deduction was brilliant?" John smiled and nodded. "Huh," Sherlock continued, "Most people just tell me to piss off."
John shuffled his hands, "Anyway, you didn't answer my question."
"I guess so," John responded. Sherlock looked at him through his eyelashes. "So, how should we spend these last few minutes?" The blonde boy asked, his left pointer finger drawing soft circles into the hip of the boy on top of him.
Hearing his boyfriend talk like that always got him riled up. He quickly flipped them over, "As you wish, love." John leaned down, licking his neck. "Be as loud as you want," he whispered then bit down. Sherlock moaned and slightly arched his back. John connected their lips while he got to work unbuttoning the purple shirt Sherlock was wearing. Sherlock panted and ran his fingers through John's golden grey hair. The soldier ground his erection into the man beneath him, being rewarded with another delicious moan. The sound of a belt buckle being removed joined the symphony of heavy breathing, then soon the sound of a belt hitting the floor.
John moved his finger down to the bridge of his nose, "Here?"
it, but it seemed to be a pattern.
"Shower is yours, now," he announced before walking into his bedroom. Only a towel was around his waist and John's eyes were glued to the piece of fabric.
John simply pecked him on the lips before whispering, "I love you but shut up." Sherlock pouted but allowed John to bandage him up. Once all the aftercare was finished, John undressed and climbed back into bed, pulling a certain consulting detective close to his chest before falling asleep with his head in a bunch of curls.
John closed his laptop and put it off to the side. "So," he questioned, "You want to give each other hickeys?"
The two sat in silence and watched the pier as the wheel moved. John shifted awkwardly, "Um, so, do you have a girlfriend?"
Sherlock looked into the boy's blue eyes. He would rather look at them than the water, "The name's Sherlock Holmes."
