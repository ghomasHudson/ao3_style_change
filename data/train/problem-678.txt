"Are you going to have to shave off some of my hair?" Sherlock asked. He sounded hopeful.
Mike nodded and gave it back to John, a calculating smile on his face.
"Of course not, your highness. All Shadowhunters know of the fey's inability to lie. We simply ask that you take care of the situation. More then one mundane has seen the loose troll, who is not bothering to use a glamour to hide himself. We simply do not have the resources to spare in london to track him down and prosecute him, what with the war in Alicante and the surge of demons in the north. He's killed and eaten a whole party of mundanes."
John finally snapped out of it when Marianne sat down behind him and began pulling his short blond hair into tiny ponytails.
"Walking in the rain?" she raised a brow.
John sighed and flopped backward, putting a pillow over his face.
"Now, throw it on top of me, then sit down," Sherlock demanded. John complied, shivering from more than the cold. After a minute or two of John sitting, anxiously listening to the sounds of chaos, about five boys rounded the corner. Random patches of their skin was dyed blue, one had his eyebrows missing, and nearly all of them seemed to be having a very adverse reaction to the dye, with red welts rising around the edges of the patches. They walk over to John, huffing angrily.
Sycthia did not scream, though she dearly wanted to. A tear ran down her face as she lifted her stele and marked her own skin with the mark of Astareal, a rune that throws any living being who is present during its creation into death, including the castor. The stars above twinkled merrily on as below, five lives were snuffed from the earth.
The reflection on the pond did not reflect the sky above. Where soft, needled branches waved gently in the wind there were instead the long strong branches of an elm seen upon the surface of the water. The knowing twinkle of the stars could not be seen in the mirrored heavens, and shadows seemed to shift within the depths.
"Fantastic job, John" Sherlock said, and John's pulse picked up. Sherlock wiggled out from underneath the bench, butt first. John told himself to not gape at Sherlock's wiggling butt, but he really couldn't help it. It was such a lovely bum, and it was right next to him. "Except for the kicking part."
Drawing Lestrade was easy, but John found that he couldn't keep Lestrade in the normal clothes he wore to school. He was simply to kingly. So, John drew him in square shouldered blazers with cross hatched shadows, trying to find a balance in the dramatic embellishments he wished to impose on Lestrade's physical reality.
Text me-SH
Sycthia nodded just as four horsemen burst from the shadows. The horses were interesting mounts, one white with sweat foam upon its hide, another  copper brown aggressively rolling its eyes at the dark forest and the dark horse next to it that disappeared into the shadows if it caught just the right angle.  The fourth horse and its rider clopped forward. They stopped in front of the women, a spot of moonlight twinkling greenly off the horses hide.
John swallows. "Well, I suppose." The image of actually kissing Sherlock flashes in his mind and John's heart stutters. "Yes, I do. But,uh, I know that you don't feel that way about things. It's, It's all fine."
heavenly metal that glowed silver white, and Sycthia gripped it tight.
John shrugged. "Well, I am soaking wet, aren't I?"
When John got home, he set his bag down on the counter and said hello to Harry, who was curled up on the sofa in a tank top and pink zebra printed pajama pants.
Capturing that personality with graphite took practice. At first it was just quick sketches that would invade the margins of John's notes, his meticulous bullet points being overtaken by twirled curls and the pinched pout of displeasure, morphing into entire days of study lost, with only a hand full of passable sketches that held Sherlock's essence within their lines.
Mrs.Hudson huffed, but Sherlock could tell it held notes of fondness in it, and when she walked by and ruffled his head of dark curls, he let his grin show a little bit.
The worse part about being Sherlock's friend was that he always knew where you were, and didn't seem to understand the concept of boundaries. John vividly remembers when he was in the bathroom stall at school, red pants around his ankles and his nose in a book, elbows leaving indents on his thighs, when Sherlock popped his head over the stall door (the tall bastard) and commanded John to hurry up because they had stuff to do. John still remembers the pain he felt when he smashed his book into his dick, trying for modesty, and how Sherlock had rolled his eyes.
The queen laughed at John's awkwardness. "Come. sit. We have much to discuss."
Really what? -J.W.
"Oi, i said suffocate not stab!"
Puzzled and most frustrated at this turn of events, Sherlock looked around for what could have caused such a large hole in the ground.
Sychia ran her fingers over her mouth and nodded, a slight flutter the only thing giving away what she felt inside, and nodded. "You must go now. They are only a few moments away."
It is a well known fact that Shadowhunters and Downworlders - that is to say, werewolves, vampires, the fey and warlocks - do not get along despite the Accords that dictate their peace. Shadowhunters are the supposed saviors of the world, and they take their jobs very seriously. While they are very good at killing demons and wielding angelic power, they are less great at diplomacy. In John's opinion, partly due to who his father figure is, the whole lot of them are arrogant sods, but still they fascinated John.
John really thought he could do it. He really thought he could be this close to Sherlock and not fall apart. John didn't think it would be too difficult, to push down the the awe-struck eyes and the maiden-like sighs, the warm-tummy desire and the daydreaming of plush lips. He thought he could be like Sherlock and just ignore things like emotions when it suited him to do so. He even thought he was succeeding.
"Sycthia, they are coming. Please, it is now, or not at all."
"Sherlock."
"-Your father," His mum interrupted, “used to paint. When we met he used to paint me little things on napkins and such. Did I ever tell you how we met? No? Well, at the time I was working as a nurse, healing up soldiers. Your father had gotten himself shot, and I was tending at his bedsit. I thought him charming, but I also thought he would never notice a plain girl like me."
Although what one perceives as pretty is heavily influenced by what one found comfortable and interesting as a child, and so is not at all an adequate or a concrete descriptive adjective. -SH
She paused for a second, then John took hold of her hand. "Don't say that, mum. You're beautiful." She smiled at him. "Oh, shush. Anyway, one day I went in to check on him and he was asleep. On the pull out meal desk attached to the bed lay a small rectangular piece of canvas. On it he had painted a portrait of me. That was when I knew he loved me."
Highly doubtful.-S.H.
"Yes." Sherlock's yes seemed potent, like the beginning of something, and John's adrenaline sat heavily in his veins
John huffed. It's weird. He didn't even think twice about pulling that trigger. The man's death hadn't even crossed his mind.
"What are you laughing about?" John's mum came in the door with a weary smile. John startled, almost dropping his sketch book.
Some way down the street, there was a huge monster with tusks and a pink snout. Thick brown hair protruded from the even thicker skin, and the giant beast snuffled about, his small beady eyes watering from the dim light.
"You boys having fun?" John whipped around. His mum was standing in the kitchen door, eyeing Sherlock with a small knowing smile.
Sherlock's eyes drift up and laughter bursts from him, mirth shaking his body.
John, you are murdering this joke. Goodnight.-SH
John made an indignant noise in the back of his throat. "What? I-there's-it's nobody!"
John decided not to question it. Instead he turned. Sherlock's face was inches away from his, and all John could see was acres of alabaster skin disappearing into expensive fabrics, an intoxicating jumble of body parts begging sensations from John's body. With a deep breathy shiver, John took a step back.
"Oh, look here. " Sherlock pointed to another page, mockery filling his voice. " You even quoted me here. This really is such a pretty picture book, John."
Get it? Sue-mor sounds like humor but its sue because it's crime and LAW? -J.W.
"So do you, Detective Inspector." Sherlock said with a raised eyebrow.
The man ripped a bit of cloth from his outfit and tied it tight around leg. Then, with a start, he whipped around to stare directly into Sherlock's eyes.
"John!" Sherlock's voice rumbled out of the depths of his throat. "Will you help me?"
Grand. Perhaps then I will be able to have a tolerable partner to study with for once, as apposed to the imbeciles that I generally get paired off with.-SH
"Marianne!"
Really?-SH
General James Sholto used to be a very beautiful, very rich faerie. He lost both in a great magick fire that also killed his whole family and his entire commanding unit. He has been trying to atone ever since, and the most note-worthy thing that he took upon himself was the raising of John.
The queen sat back. "That is of no concern of mine. But, if it is a deal that you desire..." The queen lifted her hand and an ornate dagger appeared, floating in front of the Shadowhunter pair. "All deals must be made in blood."
Sherlock was sitting on the edge of the bed, his eyes wide, his cheeks a fierce shade of pink. The fabric of his trousers was balled in his fists, and he was starring resolutely at the floor. His whole body seemed to quiver, even as he held himself still. John sat up, slightly mirroring Sherlock. He watched as Sherlock sucked on his bottom lip.
Sherlock spent the rest of the day sitting on the floor of the bookstore, shooting glares at the staff and any would be customers. He read book after book, and commandeered a computer to print a bunch of stuff from the internet as well but he wasn't finding anything that looked even remotely close to the scars on his arm and chest. In every mythology that existed, the only common thread was demons, monsters, things of that ilk.
As the silence dragged on, John felt certain that he could hear his heartstrings tearing. Then he felt the mattresses shift, and Sherlock was gone.
John always thought that never was the ancestry of the fey more undeniable than when one was confronted with one of the queens. The fey come from the coupling of angels and demons, and both of the faerie queens had an unnatural beauty that spoke of heaven and a disturbing quality about them that warned of greater danger.
John couldn't stand, so Sherlock impatiently held out a hand, and John took it, rejoicing at the slight touch, the feel of Sherlock's scars and calluses against his palm. As soon as he was standing, it seemed like time caught up with his hazed mind, and John began shrugging out of his poncho. Sherlock squirmed underneath the bench curling up into an impossibly small ball.
They left the house and called a cab, which magically appeared out of nowhere when Sherlock raised his hand. Sherlock paid the driver and John gave his address. Leading Sherlock up the creaky steps to his flat, John couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed to have this posher-then-posh young man seeing his not-posh-even-a-little flat. Looking back at Sherlock, who was looking around with a stark childlike curiosity, John felt affection for Sherlock bubble up in his chest.
Molly patted his arm."Of course,John." She shifted her weight."I have to go in an hour"
Sherlock stood on the sidewalk, seemingly watching the house in front of him. The wind was whipping his clothes and hair into streamers of color around him. John was up and halfway down the street with a sketch in mind before he relized what he was doing, and by then Sherlock had moved forward and jumped over the fence that surrounded the house. John's pace didn't even falter, he rushed forward, trying to keep Sherlock in his sight. His heart pounded in excitement and as he approached the fence his blood sang with his recklessness. John was not as tall as Sherlock, so he couldn't jump the fence, but eventually he got over, hitting the ground on his feet and a scrape stinging on his inner thigh. He couldn't see Sherlock, but he heard a shout from inside the house. John's heart picked up and he couldn't stop the smile that flashed over his face as he licked his lips and approached the door.
After the tea was cleaned and the queen served a portion of the meal, the queen reached across the table and took John's hand with a smile. "You are needed, John. You are one of my best warriors and so I am contractually obligated to send you on the troll hunt, but you are not of the fey bloodline. If you remember, the deal I made with the Shadowhunters dictates that only my fey need return after the troll is stopped. It is so rare that I have a chance to do something with out the careful eye of those damned demon hunters upon me. We must seize this lapse"
He sighed and rubbed his arms. The freezing fingertips of the night ran across his bare chest and his nipples peaked. The light of the streetlamps offered no comfort. John sighed and pulled out his phone, which somehow manged to not fall out of his waistband.
At this, the more timid Shadowhunter tinged green. John kept his chuckle to himself as he watched for the queens reaction.
John leaned against the doorframe of Sholto's living-turned-training room. "Well, you know, I had to see Molly off,sir, and it's a bit difficult to get around without wings."
Sherlock's sigh was loud enough to interupt her. "The rambling, Mrs.Hudson, we talked about it." Taking a custard cream and pulling it apart to lick the insides out, he continued "And, it wasn't 'all' those nasty kids, it was two children, bigger then the rest, who had there own issues and took them out on me because I radiate defiance of the social norm."
John didn't live on campus. He still lived with his mom and slightly younger sister, Harry. He didn't have the money for a cab, and he lived so close that it was unnecessary to take the tube, so John usually walked. He didn't mind the walk, and usually enjoyed the fresh air and the exercise. The forecast for today called for rain, so John had worn a plastic poncho that was a plaid green, and big knee high yellow rain boots. John tucked his khaki pants into the boots, bundled his red jumper into the poncho and hunched his head. The rain was hard and pelting, so John decided to wait underneath an overhang on a slightly damp wooden bench. He stared out at the green grey haze of the falling rain and inhaled, letting out his breath in a sigh. He closed his eyes and tilted his head back, listening to the hard rat-a-tat-tat of the rain. The mist rising off the pavement kissed his skin, and his hair felt heavy, so he ran his hair through it, coming away with a wet hand, and his hair spiking every which way. John was tempted to open his mouth and taste the air. He was about to, when he was slammed from the side by a dark blur. John's air huffed out from his cheeks, and the hard concrete came up to meet his side in a harsh embrace. A heavy panting pressure lay atop him, and when John shifted to look, the breath he had caught slipped through his lips again.
It was Sherlock. His hair soaking, inky strands dripping pearly dewdrops, his eyes mimicking the cacophony of colors present in the sky. His cheeks were reddened from the run, his lips pink, and breath swirling between them into smoky streamers of air. His focus was on John, and it felt like a fire on his skin, burning him so sweetly and softly, burning him alive, and John was revealing in it.
The sounds of nearby traffic. The clinks of a cafe getting ready for the morning rush. The chatter of the police detectives, which unfortunately drowned out most everything else. Sherlock debated snapping at them all to shut up, but with a sigh, he decided it wasn't worth it.
His Mum smiled. "I know, dear." She held out a spool of her medical-grade stich thread, the kind that dissolved as the wound healed. John smiled and took it from her.
"Hello." John said again, and tried to keep the butterfly kisses he felt in his stomach from escaping in the way he sighed. Sherlock took a step back and handed John his book. John took it. The cover art for "The Hobbit" stared back at him."Thanks"
Apologies for the ridiculous venue of communication, but I didn't have your mobile number and there is an absurd amount of Watson's in the phone book. As it is, I am a man of my word, and I told you I would deduce you. If you regret it, well, words don't refund. I'll begin-you're between eighteen and twenty years old, but no older. You are a rule follower, through it is not because you care for rules, or even because you think rules are all that important, you simply do what others expect of you. You play a rough contact sport, probably rugby. You have some artistic talent, and devote yourself to it. You carry a lot of responsibility but enjoy living in the moment. You hate dwelling in the past, though the events that affected you cause you to carry around defensiveness like a second skin. A bit hypocritical, that.  My guess is that someone close to you was taken from you, and you believe that it was a premature death. You have a few people in your life that you feel responsible for, which is why you came to university in the first place. You recently got over a bout of depression, only coming out of the gloomy melodramatic fog of your own pedestrian mind this year, most likely because of the change of setting and people. You are naturally inclined to accept whatever circumstances you find yourself in, and to act upon them. You're also a bit of an adrenaline junkie. You have tenancies to prefer male attention, but are unlikely to admit it. You are flattered by female attention and even find woman pretty enough to date, but that's about it. Your uncomfortable being in the spotlight, but enjoy private praise. You hate people who prosecute others for minor differences. You are a good student but have no joy for what you are studying. You live not far from campus, and don't have enough money for a taxi, which leads me to conclude that you don't have a job. So, you must be a scholarship student with you have at least some intelligence. If you now feel an overwhelming urge to hit me, please, rethink that decision and instead go to the library and learn something that is actually relevant.
I'm busy. -S.H.
"Don't make excuses. I get around fine on my own legs." Sholto flapped his undamaged wing, as if to scold John. "Come in here, boy."
John felt as if he had been hit over the head with a blunt instrument. There was a thrumming in his throat, and tension in his shoulders. He reread the note, licking his lips, trying to understand what emotion exactly was drowning him. It was a toxic and intoxicating mixture of admiration, unsettled rage, and laughter. After a moment, the rage faded and John smiled. The word Brilliant whispered past his lips and he folded the paper and tucked it into his sketchbook, right next to the beautiful silhouette he had done last night. By the end of the day, John had taken out the note and studied it a thousand times. He could now recognize Sherlock's scrawl adorning all manner of furniture and text booklets, correcting what they printed wrong, or simply dropping random bits of information. John was quite pleased with himself. Sherlock Holmes not only knew who he was, he really knew who he really was. There may not be much of a difference, but the small recognition of who John was inside-not the nice, docile simple man he showed to everyone but the mirror-but the true John, the John who bit first and asked questions later. It was a part of John that he pushed down, the part of him that loved standing too close to the edge, which loved the sing of adrenaline that craved raw honesty and the unspoken things of life that can only be settled with the action of his body. Floating in the enamor of his good humor, John found himself checking into the library. He perused the book aisles, picked out two Agatha Christie books he had yet to read. Spotting a particularly interesting looking book on the top shelf, John jumped, feeling put-out that even library shelves conspire against the vertically challenged. As John jumped, wiggled, and puffed in attempt to reach his book, a long thin arm reached out and plucked it from the shelf.
Yes. I am a consulting detective. Or, will be one, once I finish schooling, but I see no reason why I ought to wait, Scotland Yard needs all the assistance it can receive. I have to finish my science courses, and I signed up for a crime and law unit next semester.-SH
Mike raised a knowing eyebrow and took a seat next to John. "I'm good, mate. Am I not supposed to mention that you were just obsessively drawing a stunning portrait of everybody's favorite know-it-all?"
John ran a finger down the edge of his paper. "Yeah, well. It's nothing, I just cant sleep."
John's mind scrambled. He breathed a 'yes' and then Sherlock was smiling at him, brilliant teeth against perfect lips, that smart tongue telling him to take off his poncho.
For as long as John could remember he had lived in the Land of Faerie. It is an enchantingly beautiful place, so long as one is welcome there, and though the seasons and layout of the land have a tendency to be inconsistent, John loved this land. He knew that he was a mundane, a human, but plenty of changeling  mundanes lived here, and John figured that he was no different then any other.
John smiled, picking up his poncho and putting it on. Then something dawned on him.
Nothing at all. Oddly, I hadn't even thought about it. Him. Yeah. How's your head?-J.W.
John had a heart attack and died, right then and there.
Sherlock froze as if someone had pressed the pause button, mouth open, hands raised. He blinked, rapid-fire, eyelashes making an audible sound against the cream of his skin. His eyebrows turned up in puzzlement, and the corner of his mouth crinkled. His nose twitched and his hands dropped. His head tilted and he stared sat John. He sipped his tea and stood.
"Sherlock, I'm not good with this sort of stuff. I find it difficult, very difficult."
Sherlock frowned, a small line appearing between his eyebrows. "That was...unexpected."
"Well, they aren't dead." The man said, a small twinkle of awe held in his eye.
"Run!" Sherlock tugged on John's hand and then they were running, running through the rain, feet splashing, and shattering reflections over their shoes. Sherlock was a blur through the downpour and the cold, and John was smiling so hard his cheeks hurt, the humid air burning his lungs. Sherlock led him up and around, leading him through a labyrinth of streets and shadows. John's whole being felt alive, and when Sherlock turned into a small alcove, pulling John in beside him, John met Sherlock's eyes and Sherlock's irises were dancing, blue green oxygen flames. Breath came heavy and harsh, naked chests straining against cloying fabric, and John's laughter came, unbidden, high pitched and raspy. His giggles sounded down right girly and when Sherlock joined in with his chuckle, deep and creamy as chocolate mocha, John's knees went weak. A crack of lighting overhead made John's hair stand on end.
Sherlock stood and removed his rubber gloves, snapping them off his fingers with a semi-dramatic flourish.
Sherlock snatched the sketchbook up, and opened it to a random page. "It's Monday. Sherlock seems preoccupied today. I saw him in the library, where he surrounded himself with books about different fungal poisons and proceeded to ignore them, muttering nonsense and starring out the window."  With raised eyebrows, Sherlock turned the book around so John could see the picture (John remembered how he had sat there and drawn it, the rain hitting the roof a pleasant white noise to have in the background) of Sherlock, curled between two book shelves, pages open around him, squiggled lines holding the place of words on a page, and the tiniest tip of illustrated Sherlock's tongue poking from the corner of his granite mouth in concentration.
John felt that when people are as heartrendingly gorgeous as was Sherlock Holmes, their praises ought to be sung. However, John was never much of a poet. But John could draw, and Sherlock was a muse like no other.
Pulling on a pair of rubber gloves, Sherlock ran his hands over the little girl. Ignoring the disconcerting feeling of her stiff little limbs, he processed that her hair was damp. The stake that was holding her pinned to the wall, Sherlock realized with some shock, was made of bone. Her skin was also oddly hot, considering that her body held no blood and it hadn't been sitting in the sun.
"You have some authority, surely?"
Sycthia kneeled next to the children. The younger of the two, Sherlock, whimpered and rubbed at his tired eyes, wobbly legs forcing him to lean into John, who gripped him tight about the waist, and watched as his mother rolled up the sleeves of each of their pajamas.
Sherlock's life after he was taken from the clearing, but before he met John. and Warlocks.
I'm going to try to update at least once every week soooo ...enjoy chapter two ^w^
It's rather late, John. Besides the murder that you committed today, what is keeping you awake?-SH
"Is that Sherlock Holmes?" John startled. He turned, flipping his drawing upside down and leaning over it.
He breathed out a massive sigh. Oh god. He got up and left his phone on the bed. He paced along the walls of the room. Sherlock was probably sleeping. John studiously ignored the image of a sleep rumbled, hair tussled, pink skinned Sherlock that appeared in his head with half lidded eyes and a sleepy smile. John curled his fists. The thought wouldn't leave him alone. He sighed and gave into desire. He pulled out a clipboard and a piece of printer paper. Gathering up his colored pencils and switching on his light, John settled in with his back against the wall.
Sherlock was facing him across the room. A man who had his back to John was speaking German and was waving a gun wildly. Sherlock was focused on him, trying to speak a language close to German but utterly failing to calm the man. John registered that the man was rather suspiciously dressed, all in black and holding a rucksack. Another man was slowly coming up behind Sherlock. John registered the revolver in that mans hand. He nodded to himself once, scooped up a wooden chair and whacked the man in front of him, scooping up his gun, and pointing it at the man behind Sherlock.
"Have you ever...done this before? The drawing?" Sherlock's voice wavered into the air, unsure and wafer-thin.
“Everything." Sherlock affirms with a shake of his curls. John's lips curl into a smile.
Where are you? -J.W.
The odd thing is that despite the impact that Sherlock made on John, the world around John just absorbed him into it. John still went to rugby practice. He still had late dinners and worried over his future. Life went on, but somehow now it was different, as if John had been living a monochromatic existence until ink curls and ice eyes stained his universe in mystery and smirks, firing neurons and gun smoke.
The whole night Sherlock spent wandering the streets, thinking and rubbing his scars. At the first light of dawn, Sherlock was hit with just how cold he was and went into the nearest cafe, setting up shop next to a window and ordering a hot tea.
"You look like a bloody manic, scribbling stuff at 2 in the fucking morning."
Molly looked at him sympathetically.                        "I understand,John. But you know the rules just as well as I do. Until Sholto gives you permission, you can't visit the human world."
The fight went on for merely a moment. It did not take much to make the troll fall for it was already hurt and confused. Sarah, a member of John's unit, crushed a sleeping potion into the trolls face and he toppled backwards with barely any assistance from John's arrow in his knee. As the troll attempted to keep his balance however, he knocked one of the buzzing faeries near his ear unconscious with a swipe of his large hand. The faerie began to free-fall. None of the other fey seemed to notice, occupied with the troll.
"Thanks for the tea, Mrs.Hudson. Lestrade needs me, no doubt for something trivial and uninteresting. Have a good day."
When he woke up, he found himself handcuffed to the desk, and Sherlock looming over him with a terrifying expression on his face.
By the end of this lengthy paragraph, the Shadowhunter's face was quite red because the rules of making a deal with the fey state that it must be said within one breath and must be confirmed in the giving of blood. The fact that fey are known for being tricky business partners, however, explained away the precise language of the offer.
John was hunched over his phone, and so was entirely startled when a warm heavy Belstaff settled over his shoulders. He looked up in surprise to see Sherlock standing next to him. Sherlock smiled.
With that parting sneer, she strode off, rubbing at her eyes.
"Well,um,John it's difficult to enjoy my tea with your human genitals flopping all about." Molly's face was very red. John laughed at her embarrassment before going to his small wooden chest and pulling out pants,jeans,and a plaid button up and putting them on.
John jolted up with a squeal.
What were you doing? Today, earlier, breaking into that house?-J.W.
"Oh, hello mum. Working the midnight shift again?" His mum nodded, set her purse down, and plopped into the chair across from John. Without a word John stood and grabbed another mug from the cupboard. Mrs. Watson was a woman of middling height, with dirty blonde hair, laugh lines, and a smile like home. She had eyes the color of warm nutmeg and generally gave out hugs that had the same effect as warm tea. John and his mum had an interdependent relationship, and trust was a non-issue. Currently John could hear his mum pick up his book and rustle through it. He poured a generous amount of cream into the light golden green of the tea and turned around. His mum was sitting cross-legged in her hospital scrubs, biting her lip and a small worry line sat in between her eyebrows. John sat her tea by her and returned to his seat. He watched apprehensively. Eventually she sat the book down and picked up the mug. She sipped, the steam obscuring her twinkling eyes as she raised an eyebrow at John.
"Well, she was taken from her house last night, probably around midnight. She went with someone she knew and probably trusted, but they were in a rush because they forgot her shoes. There is a lot of satanic nonsense here, from the blood to the herbs to the candles, not to mention that this girl was chosen because she was 'pure of heart' or some such, judging from the unicorn imagery. The person that did this, a man by the cologne, had to be extremely strong in order to drive that stake through her stomach and spine and  the brick. The blood on the wall is the child's though there is no visible sign of any cuts. There is however the sweet smell of vomit, so I believe that she, improbably, threw up nearly all the blood in her body and her murderer took it and used it for fingerpaint. Judging from the scent of sulfur, Inspector, I would say that this was a demon summoning, which means that this is not my concern and you should charge the local Institute to arrest and punish the warlock responsible."
Sherlock led him to a bookstore called "Hudson's". He let them in at the back door and took John back to a room that was hidden behind multiple stacks of inventory. A curtain covered the door and warm peachy light leaked around it's gossamer edges.
**********************************************************************************
At dinner, He and Sholto had jut settled in for a meal of roasted acorn, whipped potatoes and creamed corn when a knock came upon the door. Sholto stood to answer, as it was his house, but as soon as he had opened the door he was bent over in a bow.
Oh. Well, yes. -J.W.
His field of vision narrowed down to just Sherlock's lips, slightly pursed in expectancy. His palms were sweaty, so he rubbed them on his pants and leaned in, the warmth from Sherlock's skin heating his own. Just as their lips were about to touch, Sherlock whimpered. "Wait"
"Sherlock! For Christ's sake, I'm not a bloody spy!"
"You need stitches." John said. Sherlock frowned and John held up a hand. "No buts. I can do them, if you would like, but you'll have to come back to my place" John felt a blush creeping over his face and into his ears.
The mothers nodded  frantically.
Sherlock had indeed completely chopped the back of his hair into an utter mess, and it probably looked insane and terrible, but as far as John was concerned it looked bloody fantastic, and loved seeing the uneven wreck of curls bobbing ahead of him as Sherlock ran off doing who-even-knows-what because it meant that Sherlock was there and bright and ,most importantly, around John.
Six of these seven shadows moved quiet and silver-quick.
"May we merry meet and blessed be in death."
"The Angel, John! Are you alright? That was quite a fall, although I'm sure you saved Billy's life." Sarah flew over to John and hovered over Billy, checking his head for wounds.
From among the trunks stepped out two forms. One, an older woman in a pink dress suit. Her eyes looked like an eagles and on her back there were two great grey-brown wings. The other, a man who looked fierce and other worldly, his ears pointed and face pale, except for a burn mark that crawled red over his chin and cheek.  He stood next to the woman and they both regarded the mothers and their children.
"And...you're sure that you..fancy me?"
I'm so so sorry that it's taken me so long. Thank you for reading, I know no one has really been into reading this, and it means a lot if you've come to the second chapter. You're the best.
Two runes, side by side, that he would have dismissed as nonsense runes had he not seen those very same markings every day when he got undressed.
"I need you to deliver something for me." The queen said, and reaching into her bag she pulled out a small, fidgety rabbit. It's eyes were lively and seemed filled with a quick intelligence,and its fur glowed a gentle, glimmering blue. "This is Bluebell. She is a very special rabbit. I chose and raised her myself. I need you to deliver her to the warlock Sebastian on 112 Basker Avenue. Can you do that for me?"
"You're late, John. Again."
John heaved a sigh and rubbed at the scar on his forearm. "I know."
Sherlock took John's mouth against his own.
Lestrade shook his head. "Only on the police force, and these people can't solve a case like this."
John handed it over with a doomed look on his face. Then he watched Mike turn the page. Mike pursed his lips and flipped the page again. Then his eyebrows shot up nearly to his hairline, "These drawings are marvelous, John...but except for one or two, they are all of Sherlock."
The thrill of warning that tingled down John's spine at that only made him grin.
"What?" John looked around.
"Shadowhunters" John whispered quietly to himself.
The blood was painted on the wall in a massive circular pattern. Gibberish runes and other cult-ish nonsense followed the curve of the pattern, and in the very middle, nailed through her stomach with a large white stake, was a little girl no more then eight years old.
The words are fragrant ones, tinging the air with sliced peaches and fresh cream, and John could taste them on the air, oxygen molecules mixed with hope and husk. They fill his lungs and stir the spark of fervor until it ignites across his neurons in a brilliant ark of desire.
John's life after being taken from the clearing, but before meeting Sherlock again. And faeries.
Goodnight, Sherlock. -J.W.
"You don't even know what I'm talking about!"
Sherlock blinked. "Are you...sure?"
Oh, you're no fun. -J.W.
John walked in with a smile and took a seat. "What's going on, sir? Everybody seems a bit harried today."
sorry for the delay in posting, but real life writing got in the way.
"Sycthia Holmes and Jenneth  Watson. By order of the Clave and Council, due to your transgression against the sacred city of Idris, and your betrayal of the vows you took when you joined the order of the Iron Sister, you are hereby condemned to execution. Do you wish to argue your case?" The woman on the horse stared out from beneath her caped hood, the supposed  righteousness of what she was doing evident in her eyes.
Jenneth handed over a rod of glowing
"Oh, isn't it?" She said innocently, going back to playing with John's hair. John grumbled. "So what happened?"
The Seelie Queen sat atop her throne, pale blonde hair billowing in the gentle breeze, slender nose and black orbish eyes doing all that was necessary to express her disdain at the intrusion of the Shadowhunters.
It was a blustery dawn, the sky still clasping to its navy shades although the night had already given up its clasp on the world. The tall metal buildings gathered the meager light of the awakening sun and turned it into sharp, earthbound stars on steel. Most of the living in the city were still wrapped in warm beds, drowsy dreams hanging over them. Those who walked the streets rubbed the tiredness from their eyes and left steamy streamers of coffee behind.
"Shut up, Sherlock! Just-just listen." John closed his eyes. It felt easier, to say the words when he was hiding behind his eyelids, so he kept them shut. "Sherlock, I, um, well. I know this is going to sound creepy, but its. Well. The truth.  I fancy you. A lot. God, Sherlock, I fancy the pants off of you. I have, for awhile now. A long while. I know you don't go for that sort of thing, but, God, how you could think that I'm a spy, you mad bastard? I'd never, I mean, I'd never do anything to hurt you. I....I bloody love you."
"Do me." John says, his breathe coming quickly.
John was awoken late in the night with a shiver. He was still in his damp clothes and his bed sheets seemed to have absorbed most of the wetness from his hair and skin. Sitting up, John debated on a shower, but upon standing, decided that he would get a nice hot cup of tea to ease the weariness in his bones. When he walked downstairs, he found his sister asleep on the sofa. She looked like an angel with the blue TV light acting as her halo. John smiled softly as he put the tea leafs in the pot, setting it on the gas stove to boil. While John was waiting, he retrieved the sketchbook from his satchel, along with a pencil. He leaned against the counter and began to loosely draw a silhouette of Sherlock in the rain. Water is always challenging, and before John knew it, he was being woken from the reverie of pencil lead scratching against paper by the whistle of the tea pot. Harry groaned loudly in the other room, and John pulled the pot off as quickly as he could. Pouring himself a cup, he sat down at the kitchen table and stared at the picture he had drawn. Unlike most of the other drawings in his notebook, this sketch took up a complete sheet of paper. It was a close up of Sherlock, his head tipped down, water cascading off the bridge of his nose and scattering in pearlescent dewdrops from his curls. His eyes where directed toward the ground and he looked thoughtful, somber, almost bashful. John laughed at to see the soft expression on the typically harsh face.
John scowled. "Look, I'm going to bed. You can stay the night, if you'd like."
Sherlock moved abruptly, turning to fold his legs beneath him, facing John on the bed. His eyes were still squeezed shut, his cheeks a sweet symphony of blooming capillaries and shyness. He took a deep breath. "I've never been kissed."
John took note of it all, filling a small hand held sketch book with image after image of Sherlock. Knowing Sherlock was nothing without his words, John had even scribbled in some of his most favorite phrases he had ever heard formed by Sherlock's perfect quip of a mouth. John's only regret was that he was unable to capture Sherlock's voice in his drawings.
"John" The queen said, standing in the doorway as if calling upon her subjects at dinnertime was something she was in the habit of doing.
John got out of bed, knowing that even though it was only early morning, and he had plenty of time to sleep in, that he would never be able to fall back asleep. He set his feet against the worn wood of the tree branch and stretched, his naked body curving as he raised his arms above his head. Wiggling his toes in pleasure at the sensation of the slightly humid forest air against his skin, John tried to forget his dream.
As John was clambering over yet another felled street lamp, the others in his unit buzzed ahead of him, where the troll could be seen slumped, with his giant hands over his eyes.
Setting a cup of tea down in front of him, Mrs.Hudson shook her head. "Not when you were younger. You were the sweetest child, always so curious, never crying over anything. You never did learn the skill of tact, though, darling, and I've had to bribe quite a few warlocks and other creatures besides to keep there mouths shut. Everybody was always wanting to report you to the Institute, you know."
I've cut off just a bit of hair around the stiches. You can't tell from the front, but the back looks hacked to death. I would much rather if you had simply shaved it, but the scandalized look on Mycroft's face was quite worth the ache in my shoulder and neck. -SH
A prologue where we learn a good bit about the events that take place when John and Sherlock are very young.
John licked his lips and nervous giggles danced in his throat. "Um, I'm glad? I think."
and with that, they were gone.
"John, this mission is of the utmost importance. You must not fail me."
"Oi, freak!"
John tugged at the steel bracelet that encircled his wrist. He tried to shift into a more upright position, but his whole body protested with a twinge of stiffness.
John stared at his phone. It was a little late at night, but John couldn't sleep. The neon night life of London kept creeping through his cream curtains, casting shadows and orange light along the walls of his room. His blankets felt thick and heated, and his skin felt raw. He had put Sherlock's number into his contacts and now his mobile felt as loaded as the gun had earlier. Nervous energy raced through his body, and his arms shook with it.
She cleared her throat, emotion suffocating her voice for a moment. "What we have done, we would do again. I feel no regret. Fuck the Clave and the Council! Down with the City! You have been corrupted by greed! The Shadowhunters have lost their purpose, and I do not wish to live to see their downfall. So kill me. I care not."
Beyond the flashing lights of the police cars and the flock of grey-clad detectives, there was what appeared to be graffiti. Upon closer inspection, Sherlock realized that the brick wall of the alley was, in fact, covered in blood.
"Hey, you don't have to be a git. Besides, where am I supposed to sleep if I can't get in?"
Sherlock puffed up his chest. "I notice everything." He says in a combative tone.
Around their wrists and necks glinted demon wire, and in the irises of their eyes burned a ring of heavenly fire. Jenneth, a stouter woman with long braided back hair of a mousy auburn colour and a smattering of soft freckles across her round face, was the one who had spoken. At her knee clutched a boy of four, who had tufts of blond hair sticking out of his small scalp that were so golden, they could be mistaken for waving stalks of ripened wheat. Her partner, Sycthia,  was a regal woman of considerable height, skin like cream stretched over a crystal bone frame, dark hair cut short to curl like a halo around her pretty face.
"Hey!" The shout came from behind John. Sherlock's eyes shifted and he grabbed John's hand. "There he is! Get them!"
Nightmares always hold similar themes, and for John, it was always that something precious and dear to him was being ripped away, leaving him all alone in a dark and dangerous world.
John looked at his wound again. "I don't think so. Why?"
"Wait, what just happened?" John said aloud to no one in particular."I'm sorry..did....did she just..?" John retracted his pointing finger once he realized that no one was paying him any mind. Scratching at his blond hair, John left the courts and went about the rest of the day with a furrowed brow and a preoccupied mind.
"I'm fine. Everything is fine." John smiled to cover his pain as he stood. "Now, the five of you had best get going. The day will be starting in earnest soon, and you don't have enough strength to cover that troll from direct sight and carry him all at once." Sarah nodded encouragingly.
But worse was it when the class was assigned its first working lab because then John got to see the bright fire lit within Sherlock's eyes as he worked with a feverish intensity, his sleeves rolled to reveal lovely forearms with two small moles near the wrist, his hair pushed back with plastic safety goggles.
So, what you're saying is that you want to be...Partners in Crime?-J.W.
Updated and changed as of 3-8-18
The boy, aged two, sat fat and sleepy in her arms, dark curls and long lashes inky drops upon skin, milk-white and translucent. He made a sleepy grumble and turned his face into his mother's neck. She shushed him and kissed his temple.
The back of a panting man, dressed in some kind of uniform, was pressed up against the window. Sherlock saw, with some surprise, that this man was covered in an invisibility glamour, and Sherlock carefully arranged his facial features so it looked as if he was simply staring out the window and daydreaming.
The DI moved close and gripped Sherlock's arm tight. "I already tried that, but those damn black-clad dickheads are 'too busy' for something as mundane as this."
Sherlock thought.
Sherlock closed his eyes in frustration.
John was, to say the least of him, handsome. He was unaware that his appearance was often likened to that of a god. Years of living in the enchanted wilderness had given John a hard muscled body, and though he was short and naturally petite, there was no denying the compact power that gave his movements a determined edge. His skin was darkened from long days in the sun, and the contrast of tan skin against golden hair would have made artists weep for the beauty of it. And his hair was considered golden. Blond was simply not an apt description for the honey-metallic colour of the short, tufted locks. His face was a kind one, red lips and eyes as blue as queens blood expressing every range and variance of emotion possible with the most subtle of quirks.
Regardless, John loves the madness that shrouds Sherlock like a cloak. He loves getting jolted awake at 3 in the morning, wondering how Sherlock got into his flat,and running into the night to chase down the evil of the world. He loves how Sherlock pushes him to study harder because really knowing how to doctor just might save a life one day. He loves the man he becomes around Sherlock, he loves how smiling with Sherlock feels like walking the edge of a knife, and how laughing with him feels like drowning in warm tea. He feels his heart skip a beat, knowing that he, and he alone, gets to see Sherlock in ratty t-shirts and silk robes, bare feet straining on the window seal as he taps on the glass. Only John gets to know that Mycroft-was-being-insufferable-no-he-couldn't-use-the-door-like-a-normal-person-John-normal-is-boring.
Sherlock's whole frame shutters. "I've never wanted something so much in my life."
"Mm." He said, and nodded, walking out the door of the cafe.
"No, Sherlock. I, no. I'm not a spy." John breathed heavily and tried to contain the constriction of his throat.
John responds with a whisper. "No"
The puzzlement that laces through the question picks at John's heart, the awe and self-doubt that the phonetic sounds are strung upon cut into John's soft sides.
He knew Mrs.Hudson held some of these answers, but despite all appearances, Mrs.Hudson wasn't a toddy old woman with a gossiping problem. Sherlock knew that his caretaker was one of the most feared and respected warlocks in all of London, perhaps in all the world, and that if something was being kept from him, it was undoubtedly because his ignorance was to play a part in some greater plan.
Eh?-J.W.
"Mike! Hey! You...ah…surprised me there. What's up?" John laughed nervously.
After the initial shock of seeing her wore off, Sherlock was able to swallow the stinging lump that had formed in his throat to take a closer look.
"I love you, Sycthia."
Coming upon her destination, the women pulled a set of keys from the pocket of her pink pencil skirt. She bustled herself and the toddler into the building of flats, and letting  the child go, she watched as he bobbed in midair with a very curious expression on his young face. Sighing, she went to make herself a hot cup of tea.
"Stupid" he said out loud. "He won't even remember you tomorrow."
The words whispered through the forest, the star- studded midnight above the groaning trees casting just enough light to see the speaker and her companions, two small children and one other woman, who huddled beneath the twisting gray branches of an old elm  tree. The wind slithered through the naked branches, dead wood and shriveled leaves scratching out warnings to all who choose to travel the treacherous path that winds around the falling, rotting trunks.
A moment later, he opened them, but now the world was sideways. John could feel his how sluggish his heartbeat was, and he would have laughed at the irony of dying from blood-loss, of all things, during his first outing into the mundane world, but he hadn't the breath for laughter. As his vision spotted out he saw a tall dark figure making its way towards him. He had time to think about how much his scars where hurting him, and then the world went dark.
Blood was rolling down his calf and being absorbed by his socks. The red wetness was surprising, but he hadn't the time or desire to find a place to remove his clothing and see what was going on, so John tore a strip of cloth from his shirt and tied it round the joint of his leg, praying that would slow the bleeding.
John squeezed his eyes shut as the overwhelming urge to cry seized him. Just as he was beginning to berate his foolishness, he heard a small metallic click, and the handcuff fell away. He could feel Sherlock's presence once again, so he opened his eyes.
John scrubbed his face with his hand. " I think Sherlock knows."
Interest undeniably peaked, Sherlock approached the crime scene with an equal mixture of caution and curiosity.
"I will accept the lack of prosecution, but I need more. I will take your dog, Simon." The queen smiled at the silent Shadowhunter.
"This is a risk."
John faltered for a moment, checking that his glamour was still up. It was and, reassured that the man couldn't see him, John took a moment to observe his features. It was an odd face, not immediately recognizable as beautiful, but after a moment it dawned upon the viewer that it held within its confines otherworldly allure .  He had high cheek bones and a delicate, hairless jaw. His bottom lip was full and plump, and the top lip was a strange pairing for the bottom because it was small and seemed to strain under the arc of a cupids bow. Both lips were pale, except for the parts of his lip that were closest to the opening of his mouth, where the softest and sweetest hue of pink was held. John tore his eyes away from staring at the man's lips, feeling awkward. The man's nose was an upturned snub with an adorable little dimple in it. John laughed at himself for thinking such a thing about a stranger, but even as he turned away he couldn't shake the feeling of familiarity he felt for the man. Rubbing at his scars, which had suddenly started to burn, John continued on his way.
The sword was drawn swiftly and brought down without second thought or threat, killing heavy and hot, and within a moment her head lay among the quiet, decomposing leaves, her hand ripped from Sycthia’s firm grasp as her body crumpled at Sycthia's feet.
John turns to face him, mirroring the way he has his legs folded. "Okay."
Or so he thought, anyway. What really happened was he stared ahead for a few minutes before pulling out his phone and calling up Mike's girlfriend, Marianne, who came and herded a very blank John back to his flat.
Sherlock was already walking away. He waved his hand. "Don't be grateful. It's my job." John felt oddly full. He walked away, but he didn't get any farther then the sunlight peeking into the doorway of the library before he had turned around and was running back in between the book stacks. By the time he found Sherlock again, he was panting. He put his hands on his knees and held up a finger. Sherlock looked at him with absolute puzzlement.
It was obvious from looking at the girl that the blood used to write on the wall around her was her own. She was shockingly pale, her small face frozen in a look of rage. She wore a pajama set covered in small unicorns, and her hair was pulled up in ponytails.
"Shadowhunters are coming to visit us. Some nonsense about a rouge fey loose in London." Sholto shook his head in annoyance.
"What, being found out as a -"
There was another thing, something that Sherlock never mentioned to Mrs.Hudson even when he was a little boy. Part of him was certain that it was a sign that he was just as mad as everybody accused him of being, and he feared it. Sherlock sometimes felt things, emotions and phantom pains that weren't his own. There were times when he needed to do something, such as shoot with accuracy or run for miles, things that Sherlock knew he couldn't do and yet. He could, but it also didn't feel like him doing these things. There was another presence inside his mind, one that prompted him to give to charity and use terse politeness at the grocery store. He couldn't shake it. It came from inside of him, but wasn't him.
"Oh, you don't have to do that, but thanks." John could feel the blush creeping over his face and his ears felt hot.
Stalking the streets as the sun set, Sherlock's eyes suddenly caught on the honey tipped clouds. An idea shot into his head.
John's home consisted of a hammock, a small wooden chest, a large mirror, and a basin from which water trickled in. The basin was built into the trunk of the gigantic elm, while the rest of the room was laid out across the flat surface of the branch. The branch itself was wide, John being able to stack four of himself and lay them perpendicular to the edges, and still have room to spare.
Sherlock nodded. They stood in silence for a while, the awkwardness tearing hooks into John's skin, reeling him ever closer to the enigma of Sherlock Holmes. "I did not expect you to take my advice to go to the library." Sherlock said.
Oh.-SH
Just then, John heard his phone buzz and just about dived across the room and hurriedly dug it from amongst his bed sheets. He nearly knocked Harry over in his haste. She snorted her amusement at him and left the room. John locked the door behind her and curled up with the comforter tossed over his head. He had one text message from Sherlock. His heart pounded as he clicked to read it.
He joined Molly on the floor, sipping at the cup of tea she had brought him, watching the sunrise.
Looking around the room, John pulled out his mobile to phone the cops. Sherlock placed his hand over John's and his gravelly voice was by John's ear. John tried not to shiver at his proximity.
Death by Popsicle-ization.-J.W.
"Oh! Hello mum." John cleared his throat. "This is Sherlock. He hurt his head a bit and I was just going to sew him up." John laughed nervously.
John swallowed. He could feel the dryness of his throat, of his tongue, feel the heaviness of his teeth as they were weighed down by the words he couldn't say.
Molly set the tray down on the floor, brushing her hands off on her jeans."It would be a better one if you were actually dressed for once when I showed up."
Sherlock looked to the side. That was when John noticed the blood soaking into Sherlock's raven curls.
"Set Sherlock down, there. John, come close."
Pretty soon, John began to take note of not just Sherlock (who by now had made a name for himself for being the biggest prick on campus) but of the people he surrounded himself with. There was a sweet girl john had rarely ever seen talk to anyone without stuttering (Molly was her name, John thought) who followed Sherlock around like he was a god. Sherlock and her seemed to get on well but seeing her stare at Sherlock always made John uncomfortable. It made him anxious, but the reason why was something he didn't know. John drew her into the book anyway, with a small smile that lifted her cheeks and her hair pulled to the side, an overlarge scarf wrapped around her neck.
John felt his heartbeat pick up. All fey make deals, but the deals made by the queens could be dimension altering.
If you are a Mortal Instruments fan, I'm sure you've noticed that I have taken a few liberties with some of the elements of magic and so on throughout this chapter. I own the Shadowhunters Codex, and while I am trying to stay as true as possible to the magic that exists within that universe, somethings need to be changed for plot reasons. Feel free to leave a comment or a kudos, bc thats what gives me actual life.
Puddles Out... Out~
Sherlock stared into the swirling brown of his tea, chewing on the inside of his lip. It has been a puzzle that has plagued him all of his life. Why is he able to see through magical shields of concealment? Where did the scars on his arm and chest come from? Why did they hold similarity to ancient runes? Why was he raised by a warlock?
The door swung open and Mrs.Hudson stood there with an alarmed expression on her face. "Sherlock! What are you doing, beating down my door? It's past three in the morning!!"
The uneasy Shadowhunter blanched, but before he could protest the one making the deal spoke. "I agree to these terms."
"So, it's true what everyone says then? That you can tell everything about a person with just a glance?" John's heart was pounding in his chest. He didn't want Sherlock to know how badly he wanted that sharp gaze piercing him, digging out his truth. He was also terrified as to what secrets he could be giving away. He tried to put on a neutral mask as Sherlock's eyes dragged slowly up his body.
"Are you suggesting that we had something to do with this rogue troll?"
"Where were you?" Harry scowls at him. Harry was a beautiful fifteen year old, with blond hair down to her hips, big brown eyes that glowed with whatever mood she was in, long legs and the curves of a woman ten years older than her. She was smart and wild, had a tendency to be blunt and get in your face, but was over all a sweet girl. She had a hard time fighting off the advances of other guys in her class, which wouldn't bother her so much if she wasn't a loud and proud lesbian.
A buzz from his mobile distracted Sherlock from his thoughts.
"Is it?" Sherlock looked around, a mock look of puzzlement on his face. "Gee, I hadn't noticed."
The winged woman smiled and lifted Sherlock into her arms. Sherlock let out a shrill cry and squirmed, his pale blue eyes locked onto John’s red face.
Instead, John  bent and took the pulse of the unconscious man. John figured he probably had a concussion. He looked up to see Sherlock was still staring at him, those cold eyes assessing.
"Bullshit, John. You've been acting really weird lately." Harry smiled and tilted her head, her blonde hair falling out of her braid. Her eyes sparkled. "So, tell me. Who's the lucky lady?"
As for himself, Sherlock thought that he had never seen a man so lovely in his life. He was a small man with a face that looked prone to quiet smiles and laughter. His eyes were so dark blue as to be mistaken for violet.
John stood with a laugh. " Unneeded? You could have been shot. Also, you're German is terrible."
"You remember the deal?" Jenneth said urgently, handing John over to the man. The man nodded and remained stoic even as John kicked his heels into his stomach  in an attempt to get back to Sherlock.
Sherlock tried very hard not to react as the man observed him, but he was hard pressed not to lick his lips as the man stared at them for a disconcertingly long amount of time.
A pond shimmers in the moonlight, stars twinkling above, the gentle hush of swaying pine scenting the air. A rabbit hops through the underbrush, pausing a moment at the edge of the water. If a thinking being would have been to pass by this particular pond, at this particular moment, they might have seen something very strange.
Sychia sniffled. “Oh, hes always been such a noisy fussy babe and it will only get worse from here, I fear.”
Finding the troll was easy enough, seeing that it left a path of destruction in its wake and brutalized any light source it found. Trolls were big, dumb creatures with weak eyes, strong jaws, and keen senses of smell. They generally stayed underground and were no harm to any one other then dwarfs and goblins.
Investigating?-J.W.
That's right, no heroic death for me.-J.W.
John raises an eyebrow. "Oh. Everything?"
John went to the sink to wash his hands. He heard a rustle, and turned. Sherlock was gone, but on the counter was a scrap of paper with a series of numbers on it and two words.
Mrs.Hudson clucked her tongue at him. "Oh, Sherlock, where are your trousers? You got nothing but pants on beneath that robe!"
Suddenly, a man burst through the line of pine trees. He was fierce of face and unearthly beautiful for all of his features seemed to be spun from fine glass. He was dressed in rich silks, long hair  seeming silver in the dark. In his hands he held a young boy, who was squalling and clutching his heart. The child's face was red, and his golden hair was in disarray.
~John,
She let him go roughly. "And for god's sake, try not to make it so obvious how much you get off on this sick stuff"
He was drinking his fourth cup and puzzling over the idea of a secret angelic runic system that he had read about on an online forum when the window next to him suddenly rattled. Sherlock startled, and looked out.
The taller woman, Sycthia, nodded. "The stele, Jenneth."
His hair is still in those ridiculous ponytails from the night before.
He could hear someone calling to him, but he was moving away and soon he was surrounded by a crowd of strangers. He blinked the blur away from his vision. Feeling a bit off balanced, he went to the nearest bookstore.
Sherlock Holmes was, in John's opinion, simply too lovely for words. It was not so much the unique structure of his face or the gangling eloquence of his limbs as it was the arrogant tilt to his head and the calculating disdain of his curled lip. Sherlock Holmes wasn't pretty, or at least John didn't think so. He simply was not soft enough. His face was more striking, the kind of face that one remembers, the sort of look that makes a person take up space and demand attention. A body brought to life from chipped marble, eyes carved from the quicksilver flash of a crystal lightning bolt, hair as wild as raised hell and dark as the inky shadows of the midnight chime. John loved him from the moment he walked in the door of John's Human Anatomy and Physiology class.
It is said that to this day, a white ash tree grows where those bodies lay, and that it stands defiantly against the rot.
It is of none of your concern.-S.H.
Well. Its supposed to be a laughing face, like an animated one, from a cartoon. I do wish you hadn't cut you hair though. I liked you hair. It was pretty.-J.W.
John fell asleep with a big smile on his face and his mobile held tightly against his heart.
John sprung off the bed and clutched his chest."Marianne!"
John turned back to Sherlock, rescued the sewing needle from the hot water, let it cool, and threaded it. Sherlock climbed off the counter, and sat in a chair. John pulled the chair up against the counter and sat behind Sherlock. It only took a eight neat little stiches to sew up the wound, and Sherlock didn't wince at all.
"At first I had thought that perhaps it was Mycroft, but then I realized that he wouldn't have hired someone so incompetent, especially to keep an eye on me. So I deduced that it must be a lessor organization that had it in their best interests to keep an eye on my activities. I must applaud your acting skills. Most convincingly friendly. I didn't even suspect anything until you accidentally handed over the book of notes you had been keeping on me. Initially, I was unsure what to make of your little book." Sherlock drummed his fingers on the cover, and John could feel each small fingertip beat a spear of ice into his heart. " But then, you rather gave yourself away with the bit where you saved me. It was so obvious that you had been following me, I was furious with myself for not catching it sooner. I quite enjoyed the time we have spent together, but some new personal  developments mean that I must put a stop to this little game."
Sherlock and John seemed to fade right into each other's life like it was always supposed to be this way. Sherlock had a very special ability to weave in and out of John's days like a cat would between a pair of legs, only unbalancing a week enough to leave John panting and red faced, smiling as he collapsed into his bed at night, almost content with calling Sherlock Holmes his best friend.
Jenneth stepped forward and tilted her chin up, defiance radiating from the squareness of her jaw. Her hand she kept clasped in Sycthia's.
In the distance, the panicked scream of a horse shattered the night, an alarm that let them know that their predators were close.  The blond boy stood up straighter next to his mother, young eyes turning distrustfully to glare into the shadows.
Sherlock awoke with his back on the floor and papers over his face. For a moment, his dream lingered with him and he believed that he was still in primary school, pushed flat on his back and his papers trod on, the resounding call of "freak" and "fag" echoing down the hallway driving him mad.
Sergeant Donovan marched up to Sherlock with a disturbed look on her pretty face. She grabbed onto the front of his jacket and pulled him down close.
"Tell, me, John." Sherlock raised a hand, and from it dropped John's sketchbook, the one he had lost all those days, months ago. He looked up at Sherlock. Sherlock looked furious. "How long did you think you could get away with spying on me, and who exactly do you work for?"
John stayed with Sholto long enough to grab a good breakfast and practice hitting the humanoid target with his arrows at a third of a league. As soon as he was finished, he took off towards the courts.
A sudden stab of fear shot through Sherlock's chest, and his head snapped up to look around the store. Softly floating dust motes and quickly fading sunlight and a single worker were all that shared the space with him. Frowning, Sherlock felt his fear turn to confusion. He had no time to sort through these tricky, uncalled for (and not to mention annoying) emotions. He huffed and shuffled his feet in front of him, causing a whole stack of his books to fall over. This called the attention of the store keep, who was quick to come over and shoo Sherlock out.
"You're bleeding!" John crossed to stand by Sherlock, grabbing Sherlock's jaw when he tried to jerk away. John gingerly brushed the hair away, ignoring how silky the strands were, ignoring the smell of Sherlock's shampoo and expensive cologne. The cut wasn't too terrible deep, but it was bleeding enough to cause concern, as head wounds tend to do. John decided that it needed stiches.
Although most changelings are eventually used for mating, John never questioned that he had yet to be taken even though he had come of age three years ago.

Hey! I signed up for the crime and law unit too! I thought it looked interesting. -J.W.
Marianne shrugged. "They both begin with s and I'm dyslexic, what do you want from me, John?"
A snort came from under his bench and with the smile still in place, John swung his heel back into the source of the noise. The boys seemed to waver slightly, confused, before one of them heard some imaginary noise in the distance.
"Basker Avenue, as quick as you can."
"Follow me."
Sherlock rolled over and felt the reassuring give of the carpet beneath him. Standing and stretching out his stiff muscles, digging his toes into the floor, Sherlock walked into the kitchen of his little flat. The table was covered with all manner of scientific equipment, and while surveying the mess, Sherlock caught a glimpse of himself in a reflection. Frowning at the odd, severe planes of his face, he let out a huff through his nose and, for a moment forgetting his modesty, clambered downstairs to Mrs. Hudson's flat.
They sit in the almost quite a bit longer, the gruff sounds of the waking city just beyond the walls rooting this shaky moment of possibility in something concrete.
Sherlock swirled away into the light-studded night time, and John followed.
The curser on the blank screen blinked at him. John tried to think of a clever opening. Something funny. Something witty? John rubbed his face and decided to go with something more simple.
Sherlock looked up. "It's getting late. You should probably be getting home." The words left his mouth in curls of breathy condensation.
Sherlock swallows and squeezes his eyes shut. When he speaks again, his words are deliberate, calculated. "John, I was very pissed at you for being a spy because you are one of the few people that I have come across who I not only found to be tolerable, but who I actually enjoyed spending time with. I am quite relieved that on this one occasion my deduction skills were lacking."
John could only nod, breathing heavily through his nose.
Before John could even see the courts, he could hear them. The very air hummed with the anger of the faeries. For Shadowhunters to come here, to be accusatory, and worse, for them to expect the  fey to take responsibility for another, well. It was simply not on .
