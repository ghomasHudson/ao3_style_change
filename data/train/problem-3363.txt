"Yes..." Castiel's voice was raucous and shaky. He was so lost in the feeling he was experiencing for the first time. With the sex he’d had with April, he was the one delivering it, but this time, he was the one receiving. The truth was, in Castiel's opinion, receiving was the better option. "I can feel you, Dean."
''Was.'' Dean looked over to Sam. ''He is no longer an angel, Sammy. That means all his magic and tricks are gone. He no longer can just zap out whenever he is in danger. He needs to learn how to fight monsters as we do. And I don't accept the old angelic fighting ways he knows. Sure he was a warrior back in Heaven but here, he is just like us. A human.''
"It is urgent, Dean. I need your assistance." Castiel pointed the tent between his legs, without waiting for Dean's answer.
"You like me?"
''In a lover's way, you know.''
''Good morning Sam.'' said Castiel when he saw the younger hunter.
It was the breaking point for Castiel. Dean's command for him, seeing his face right next to his junk, shining with sweat, eyes full of lust just like him. So Castiel did what Dean told him to do. He came so hard that some of his come splashed on Dean's face. His legs gave in, making him fall on his knees, right in front of Dean. He leaned on Dean, rested his face on Dean's shoulder. His face was hot.
''Something's wrong?'' Dean was on alert as soon as he heard Castiel's voice.
Dean's emerald eyes found Castiel's ocean blues.
Sam really wanted them to be together,
"First of all," Dean started softly. There was no need for speaking loudly since their faces were so close. "males tend to get boners in the morning even tho they do not do anything sexual." He took a breath. He was still damp due to not being able to dry properly, but being so close to Castiel made him feel so hot all over his body. "Second of all; stop suggesting sleeping with other women, with April even though she is dead! It pisses me off when you talk about her!"
Castiel didn't want to answer that at first, but he knew Dean was also getting worried. He didn't want to worry him.
Castiel's mouth was left open, his eyes closed, his toes curling behind Dean's head, his hands gripping both Dean's shoulders, like trying to leave his handprint once again.
"What?" That made Dean stop what was he doing.
Castiel's hands found their way down to Dean's hair. Pulling them, pushing Dean's head further without being aware of it. Dean liked that, he was always into the rough foreplay. He liked the way Castiel sounded. Murmuring, moaning, moaning Dean's name.
''Are you not well, Sam?'' Castiel asked with concern on his face. Sam smiled to himself. If Cas thinks he is sick, that means it will be easier to make Dean believe him.
"Dean, you do realize that I cannot heal them, right?" Castiel reasoned.
''Dean.'' Castiel managed to say, his hand on his heart.
"Ok, I'm starting to get this feeling you don't feel the pleasure as well, so I'm gonna skip this part."
"Woah, Cas! I'm still not done in here!"
When the sun rose, Sam was first to wake up. Opposite to his usual morning routine, he didn't wash his face, didn't go for a run, didn't brush his teeth. On the contrary, he even smelled the trash bin so he could throw up and look sicker. Dean has been so strict about his rest ever since he completed the trails so, he was going to use that for his plan. He was going to trick Dean into letting him stay in the bunker alone to rest so that he and Cas would be alone in the woods. Yeah, sure Wendigos are hard, but it is Dean Winchester and Castiel the Angel, once, we were talking about, they would be just fine on their own, Sam thought.
Just a few seconds later a deep voice sounded behind him ...
-Just because you said please, Baby.
"W-why ... what ...?"
-I will, but if you betray me there will be nowhere to hide.
"Calm down little Ken, I just wanted to say hi" Before Dean's incredulous look, Crowley decided to tell the truth ... "Okay ... I just wanted to say that I know about your little plan, and I want to help you, but in return I want something ..."
"Mmm, well ... I was born with her, she is from birth..."
Upon reaching "his" room from him, he was perplexed to see how luxurious it was, he really had to have something special to be given such a room.
-I love you, Cas. I said as he yawned and my eyes kept getting closed.
"..."
"What time is it?"
After getting out of there, Dean went to sort things out before starting his plans, just little things like IDs and some papers needed to go unnoticed for a while while he planned things well ...
"I wasn't spying on you." He said defensively.
"Interesting..."
"You are definitely special boy, and I assure you that with my help you will be great Dean." Then Lucifer got up "What are you waiting for? Let's go" Dean hesitated for a moment but there was something inside him, something that wasn't exactly human, that he said was for the best and that if something bad happened he could always take over, and It didn't matter if it was the damn Lucifer that he had to face one way or another he would win ... So he just got up and followed him outside where the man gave him his hand, which he grabbed while closing his eyes, the only thing What he could do was hear a flutter, by the time he opened his eyes he was in a large room decorated mostly in black and red colors, with a lot of men and women lined up to reveal a throne at the end of the room, when he saw Lucifer, he smiled at him as he said ...
"Yes, why?"
-So beautiful, everything ready for me, you even put your tampon on.
I quickly did what he told me, it wasn't long after that when Cas snapped his fingers and our clothes disappeared, and a harness tied me in return, revealing the tampon that I had put on that morning when I needed something inside me.
"Lucifer."
"No, it's not ... But that only means one thing"
"Well, now I have to leave you, I have a man to kill ..."
"I won't take you to hell, not exactly, but if I can help you improve your skills ..."
"Oh little one, happy birthday, I just came to give you a little birthday present, what do you think ...?" Then the boy nodded "But first I would like to tell you the story of your birth, have I already told you?" Then the boy nodded again. "Well it doesn't matter anyway I'll tell you about it ... It all started almost 10 years ago right here in Lawrence when a call came to me saying that I urgently needed to go to the hospital, when the doctor arrived he told me that it was found by a young man in a small alley next to a bar, with clear signs of rape, I was devastated by that, but although it took time she recovered, of course never totally, but she did. Just imagine when a few days after everything seemed normal we found out that all this brought with it something more than trauma, but also a small child, I did not care that you were not mine, if I still had Mary, well what problem was there, but you decided that the best thing you could do at birth was to kill her and you know me you have made quite unhappy little freak, but enough of me, it's your big day, so are you ready for me to give you your gift boy? "
"Yes, little squirrel, this is yours, the lord believes that it is better that you rest well, since tomorrow your training will begin to become a "Knight of Hell" his words not mine" Crowley said with clear hatred towards his boss, but Dean let it pass. "Rest squirrel that tomorrow will be a hard day ..."
"B-but don't you wonder why?"
So ... putting that aside, I wanted to say that I made it, we made it, anyone is fine, although I do firmly believe that I could not have made it without my little demon, with his eyes sometimes a green deeper than that of a jungle, but other times darker than coal ... Now, I was telling you that we managed to conquer everything, every plane that could exist, well all but one, but I am 100% that we will not have problems with it ...
"Cain"
"Those are just stories"
❣️🩸🩸🩸❣️
Okay, the reason is that even though I hate her, but I have to admit that she was one of the best stewards in heaven, and I think she's smart enough not to betray a hell knight with the mark.  The end.
Sam’s head snapped back and forth between the two men “I don’t get it. What’s the problem, Dean?”
“I would like us to be.”
The firefighter’s voice softened, “Oh Dean my beautiful man. I love it when you beg. I am feeling generous so I will give you what you want.” Cas hardened his features as he commanded, “Remove your clothes. Now!”
“They stay here.  It’s not ideal, but it’s the best option for now.”
A thought hit Cas, and he blurted, “Dean?”
“I’m thinking it’s almost like a treasure map.  Place all the pieces and x marks the spot.”
Just like that the dam burst and Charlie started to talk, rapid fire and never-ending. It ceased when the pulled up in front of an apartment building near the hospital. “So, this is it. Your home away from home for as long as Cas is at Grossman.” Dean must have made a face because suddenly Charlie said, “You agreed to this.”
“Then why are you crying.”
Cas reached out and took Dean’s hand, pulling him into the seat next to him.  “Of course, I am.  You are not a secret.”
“Fine, but we are talking about this tomorrow.” The blond left in a huff, hair swinging out behind her.
Ideas flew back and forth between Sam, Pamela, and Dean.  As they talked, Cas took a seat next to Charlie and watched her work.  She had multiple screens going and a multitude of pages open.  “Are you finding anything?”
Clearing his throat, Dean asked, “How long was I out?”
“This morning, I think.”
“THAT’s what’s keeping you up?”
Dean tried to cover the laugh which bubbled to the surface at the accuracy of the woman’s last name. For some reason, he managed to hold in the laugh, but couldn’t stop himself from blurting. “You have got to be kidding me.”
“Are you sure?”
Cas leaned against Dean and pulled his hand into his lap before returning to the earlier topic with Charlie.  “What is the timeline we’re looking at because I know Dean hates being stuck here?”
Dean lifted his head and stared intently at Cas.  “Damn right it does.”
“What the fuck was that?”
Cas quirked his lips and said, “I missed you, too.”
Finding Dean was not hard.  He had gone to what Cas thought of as their place.  Deep into the woods, isolated and quiet.  It offered a serenity they did not find in their daily lives, and when they were at the Inn, they took every chance they had to soak in it.  The set of Dean’s shoulders told Cas he had heard his approach.  His deep voice, filled with emotion, broke the silence.  “I want to be alone, Cas.”
So, it had been a few of hours of interrupted sleep.  No dreams, no aches.  And waking to Dean in the bed beside him felt especially incredible after the negative thoughts he’d had earlier.  “Did you eat dinner?”
“Dammit, Sammy, hurry up.”
“I’m always bossy.”
Beth left her seat and wrapped her arms around Castiel’s neck. “We got out,” she whispered, not for the first time and probably not the last.
Dean sat up slightly, dislodging Cas from his chest.  He leaned over Cas and bracketed his head with his arms.  “I’m thinking we use the vacation days as we planned.”
“No sirree, this is all you. Dr. Bevell is a huge fan of your work. She’s the reason your documentary got approved. The hospital lawyers were firmly against it, but she worked her superpowers and got the green light. Speaking of your documentary, I was expecting cameras.”
Cas smiled at the younger man before turning to face Sam again. “Dean’s right.”
“Cas, what’s the matter?”
Steeling himself, Cas forced out, “Okay.” Looking back to the doctor, Cas tried to convey his need for more information on his injuries. The doctor smiled and nodded.
A trickle of information leaked out from the task force, so Cas knew Sam Winchester was gone by the time the FBI arrived.  No trail was found.  As for Dean, his car had been caught on camera again, but he remained allusive.  Cas shared the only photo he had of Dean and sat with a sketch artist.  He thought he was already torn apart, but that process showed how much more he could shred.  It took hours to recover from the intense feelings of betrayal he directed at himself.  Guilt and shame combined to make an exhausting cocktail.  Victor escorted him out of the building and to the nearest bar where they proceeded to get properly drunk.  Charlie and Talia had joined them and the four of them stayed until closing.  The hangover the next day was well-earned and excruciating.  It took the entire weekend to recover.
Even though Cas still had questions, he was happy to comply with Dean’s request.  He kissed him and washed him, every move gentle and precise.  When they finally stepped out of the shower, Cas dried Dean and tended to his hand.  He used the same gentle touch.  As he finished with the bandage, Dean sighed, “I can finish up.  I just…would you mind going down without me?  I would feel better if you at least gave your parents a warning and can you make sure Meg is secured in the panic room.  I don’t want her there.”
Cas looked small on the stretcher as they brought him out of the building. A flurry of activity surrounded him. Words shouted back and forth between the firefighters and the EMTs. Dean knew he should be listening but all he could attune to was the body of his love strapped to the stretcher. “Oh God, Cas.” Dean took the last two steps to stand at his side.
A little glimpse from Sam's perspective.  Hope you enjoy.
“I never expected you to be so loose and giving.”
Sadness filled Charlie’s eyes. “Sounds lonely.”
“We have a place they could stay.”
“How did you find her?”
“I know,” Dean said as he straightened and looked Cas in the eye.  A small smile curled the corners of his mouth.  “I need sleep,” he breathed.
Cas chuckled at the disgusted expression.  “It’s not that bad, Dean.  You swallow it.”
“Hmmm…that but more the whole getting married thing?”
The blood drained from the hunter’s face as he blanched.  “Fuck.  I am so out of my depth here.”  There was defeat in his voice, yet he made his way over and sat down on the far end of the bed.  “You aren’t alone in that,” mumbled Cas.
The hunter stood and walked to the window, staring into the morning sunshine. “I am not afraid of anything. There is no need for me to be there. It’s as simple as that.”
“Yeah, lost my appetite.”
Sighing Cas said, “I should have known I couldn’t fool you.  Stupid bond.”
“Stop,” shouted Sam.  “None of this makes sense.  What kind of deal did she make with Crowley?  That is if one even exists.  If she made the deal to get away from the Campbell’s why was she targeted by Azazel.  Shouldn’t she have been hidden in some way, so people didn’t know of her connection to them?  And why are we suddenly believing a demon.  I mean this could all be an elaborate story Meg made up.  Besides, Bobby, you said you thought Mom’s deal had something to do with her death, but how does that fit with this new information.  And come on, do we seriously believe Dean is not John’s son.”  On the last point, Sam looked to Dean.  What he saw there must not have been what he expected because he reeled back.
“It’s fine, Dean.”
Dean took Cas’ hand and pulled him out the door. “It isn’t going anywhere. You will be sleeping here tonight.”
“Yes, you do.”
With one last look at Cas, Dean turned to face the new arrival.  “What are you the kissing police?” he asked.  Alex didn’t bother answering.  Instead, she gave them a shrug and a little wave before bounding off.
Cas’s eyes found Dean’s as his hand shot out and gripped Gabriel’s elbow.  Voice low and harsh, he said, “Don’t call him that.”
After a fitful few hours of rest, the group assembled for a quick bite to eat at the late-night diner down the road. After everyone had their fill, they divided up and set out. Traveling south from Nampa, they passed through small towns along the highway. About an hour into the drive, they left the highway and traveled the backroads until they pulled off onto an unpaved spur. From that location, the group branched off to find their assigned area. The mountainous region boasted vast arrays of terrain. Some sections offered little cover and needed to be searched before daylight. By the time each group reached its destination, they had about three hours before daybreak.
“What the fuck?  I don’t even know where to begin.”
Cas smiled down at Dean before placing a single kiss on his lips.  “Just lay back.  I’ll take care of you.”  Dean’s body went slack as he let go of the iron grip he had maintained since Cas was injured.  It was an amazing sight to witness, and it fueled Cas’s desire.  His already hard cock twitched, demanding attention.  Cas ignored it because tonight wasn’t about him.  It was about Dean.  He kissed his way down the column of Dean’s throat, moving his head back and forth until his mouth had been on every inch.  It was only then that he moved lower, spending time bringing Dean to the edge, sucking and biting each nipple until they were dark purple and hard.  By the end, Dean was panting and keening.  The quiet pleas went on as Cas slid his tongue over Dean’s ribs and sucked a mark above his belly button.  But when he bit at his hipbones, Deam arched, his hips lifting violently from the bed.  The quiet begging was gone.
Cas finally lifted his gaze to look at the man.  He tried to rein in his initial reaction, covering the hitch in his breath.  The smirk he got in return told him he had failed spectacularly.
“You won’t need it. Once you knock out some of that warding, I will be able to see the layout of the bunker.” Gabriel puffed up his chest. “I told you having an archangel on the team was a good idea.”
“God, yes, you sexy fucker.”
Gabriel chuckled, “Well good thing you have an archangel on the team then.” He looked at the people huddled on the bed. All three were glaring at him. “Come on. I can play nice.”
“Yes.”
“How did you know?”
“What?  Touch me?”  Dean nodded without lifting his head.  “The need for touch is not inherent in an angel, and I didn’t truly understand it at first.  When you would touch me, there was…is this feeling of peace.”
“All right, that's good,” said Charlie.  “I’ll get all I can on him.  You just get your ass home.”
The green-eyed man lifted his head nervously to find Cas staring at him with kindness in his blue eyes. “No. Cas, I do.” Steeling himself, Dean said, “I am in therapy for a variety of reasons. Not only because I needed to stop drinking. I needed to find a way to accept myself and to learn to talk about my issues. And I also needed help dealing with the loneliness I felt at losing all of you and losing the bond I shared with Cas.”
The moment was broken when Sam said, “So, Dean I was thinking you should come into the office for a few hours.”
Hannah’s shoulders drooped. “I didn’t lie.”
“You aren’t the first to say those exact words.” Naomi held out her hand to Dean. As they shook, she added, “I may be stern, but I am also exceptional at my job.”
He pulled his cock out of Dean’s mouth, trailing a finger along his lips. “Go lay down.” Dean didn’t move. “Dean?”
In the weeks following, something nagged at the back of Dean’s mind. Each time they were intimate, there was a moment in which Cas tensed. Whenever a hand came near his groin, whether Cas’ own hand or Dean’s, the angel tensed. Dean relived each moment, replayed the events, and tried to find a solution. After several agonizing days and sleepless nights, he decided he had to talk to someone. As he approached Sam’s house, he was overcome with apprehension. This was not a topic he wanted to talk about, much less talk about it with his brother. But he needed a man’s advice. Stepping through the door, he called out, “Everybody decent.”
Dean clapped him on the shoulder before taking off up the stairs yelling, “Sammy, guess what?”
“I…what?” said Cas, confused.
“Why did you brush it off?” Her eyes were earnest and kind when she asked the question.
Turning to the other occupant of the car, Gabriel said, “Got nothing to add?”
Welcome to all the new subscribers.  Hope you are enjoying the journey.  And as always thanks for the kudos and comments.
Stuttering to answer, Dean said, “Uh…ahhh…maybe.  A little bit, yeah.”
“I’m sure,” he said, even though he wasn’t sure at all.
Cas had to pull himself out of the drift in order to whisper, “Why do you think that is?”
“Still, I feel like I’m useless.  I could at least stay awake long enough to thank our friends and family.”
“He is. He told me himself.”
“It’s just strange to hear you swear. I’m not surprised by your candor, but that particular word…” Sam’s smile expanded and his strong arms engulfed Cas. “I’m so glad you’re here Cas.”
Sam stood in front of Charlie. “I don’t think we have a choice. If Cas needs this then we have to let him.”
“But…”
Cas shifted slightly so he could look at Dean’s face.  “What do you mean?”
“As I’ll ever be,” answered Sam.
Sorry for the late chapter, but I was finishing up my DCBB fic,
“Cas are you in here?” Sam’s voice bellowed from the front door.
With a sigh and a shrug of one shoulder, Dean responded, “That’s where this gets weird.  Usually sirens use the love their victims feel for them to make them commit violent crimes.  The worst part is those acts are usually against the people the victim loves.  The siren gets off on it and then they lose interest.  Leaving behind a giant clusterfuck.  But if Bobby’s right, the siren is only using its powers to lure the victim away.  Where’s the payoff for them?”
Cas touched her hand and put in his own request.  “Mom, please try to get some rest.”
As the words continued unbidden, he vaguely heard the conversation continue.
“We are,” Madilyn said.
Charlie groaned before saying, “I understand, but we have no idea what’s out there.”
“The list is damn long, Cas, and it will take more than one breakfast to go over.  Bobby, you should focus on the ones we encounter most often,” said Dean as he turned to face the table.  His eyes landed on Cas before he quickly diverted them to Bobby before turning back to his task.  “No sense overwhelming him with ones we have never seen.”
“No, that did not make it better you ass,” Dean pressed out between gasps for air.  When he got control of himself, he slipped off the bed and helped Cas into his wheelchair.  Meg did not bother trying to help anymore.  If Dean was in the room, everyone knew to let him handle moving Cas.  It was a routine now, and he appreciated that no one questioned it.  Not even Cas.  He let Dean care for him with only a few sarcastic marks slipped in when it got too suffocating.  Sam called it hovering, and Gabe called it smothering.  All three probably described his behavior at times, so Dean accepted the comments without argument.
Dean’s eyes snapped open, shock evident in his expression.  “Did you feel that?”  Cas didn’t respond.  “Cas, did you…” Dean said as he slid his hands up Cas’s thighs, adding pressure as he went.  Cas whimpered, not only from the feeling, but also from the intimacy of the touch.  “You did.  You felt that.”  Dean rocked back on his heels.  “Shit, I need to get Dr. Bevell.”
Dean held up his hand and grunted loudly, cutting Cas off.  “No buts, Cas.  I never had any of this shit growing up.  We got a few necessities and that was it, and I refuse to do the same thing to my kids.  I don’t want them to feel the way I did.  You don’t understand.  I know you try, but you can’t really get it.”  The deep seeded pain of Dean’s childhood was written across his face and in his eyes, and in the rigid posture of the full-length of his body.  There had been healing, but so much still lingered.  The revelations of the last year had brought it all back up and had accentuated just how much damage Dean’s upbringing had done.  Cas needed to do a better job of remembering that fact.  It was easy to forget when Dean smiled and laughed so freely.  But his childhood trauma remained hidden under his jovial demeanor, and Cas knew it.  As he dealt with his own issues, he needed to recognize Dean’s journey as well.  Dean had been his support through so much these last years, and Cas needed to do the same for him.
“Fine by me,” said Charlie.
“But you did remember, Cas.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” she said, jumping down from the bed.
This brought the angel up short and he lost his concentration. His eyes opened and he saw the room around him. The vision of his soul was gone. Hanging his head, he sighed heavily. The potential was there. He knew it, but after the attempt he was drained and bereft. The pain in his body was more noticeable and with each passing second it grew harder to ignore the newest pain. Each twinge brought unwanted images. Using what little strength he had left, he pushed those thoughts aside. Replacing them with thoughts of his family and his home. Easing himself back on the bed he laid down, shut his eyes and let his exhaustion sweep him away.
They moved together, slow and rhythmically.  The heat built with each deep thrust until Dean was practically keening.  Noises he never expected erupted from his body.  He couldn’t contain himself, and when he finally tipped over the edge, he lost all semblance of reality.  His clarity briefly came back when he felt Cas’s release deep inside of his body.  The new sensation sent a wave of belonging through Dean’s spent body, and it was that feeling which caused his tears to fall from his eyes.  Whatever remaining strength Dean had gave out.  A sharp whoosh of breath erupted from the man below him as he collapsed, flopping the full weight of his body onto Cas.
“Glad to hear it,” Jacob said, patting Cas on the arm.  “Now, what precisely do you think your mother and Dean are up to?”
“Maybe,” hedged Dean. “Don’t read anything into it. It’s only when I can’t sleep.”
“What the fuck, exactly?” said Victor.
“Maybe that’s the difference. You didn’t choose your sexuality.”
Not having noticed the exchange between Naomi and Cas, Gabriel flounced after her and yelled over his shoulder, “As much as I hate seeing you undress my nephew with your eyes, I love how you ruffle her feathers.  Keep it up, Deano.”
“I’m not trying to achieve any result. Once in a while I need to let go and this is what works.” He knew he failed to keep the sadness out of his voice, when she stepped in and put her arms around his waist.
Dean gasped and leapt off the bed. “Cas, no.” The angel waited until Dean stood toe to toe with him. “I assure you I will not make that choice because if I did, I would lose so much more.”
“Yeah, I do, but I thought you weren’t going to push me away anymore. I can’t handle seeing you hurt if I can’t be there to help you.” Dean stood up and sat down in Mildred’s vacated spot. He reached out and took Castiel’s hand. “You have to let me help you, Cas.”
“Feels like it.”
“You like hearing that.  Don’t you?  How much I want your cock inside me.  How needy I am for it?”
With a flat, deadpan delivery, Cas said, “When you say things like that, I wonder if I have changed too much and shouldn’t try harder to hold onto the angelic parts of myself. I don’t really want to spew all over the place.” He tried to keep his expression blank, but he realized he failed when Dean gave him a dazzling smile. “What gave me away that time?” asked a bewildered Cas.
“Dean,” scolded Cas, “I told you what I was planning on doing.”
Despite their whispered conversation, Dean obviously overheard them because he butted in with, “Damn right he is.”
“I have two missed calls and ten texts. He seems really concerned,” said Cas as he stared at his phone.
“It is your first time in some ways,” Cas said calmly.”
“That’s just it, Cas.  Nowhere.  There isn’t a single trail.  No credit cards, no bank records, no work records.  Nothing.  They simply vanished.”
“Yes, but…”
“Hello, Dean.”
A heavy sigh and then Cas spoke in a deep grit-filled voice. “He gives me glimpses of his desire for me. He shows me what we could have and every time I hope, he rips it away from me. When I saw him with those women as he prayed to me, I decided it was time to quit hoping. He will never allow himself to be with me. I see that now.”
“Not my first time here.  It’s across town.”  Exiting the parking lot, Dean bypassed the interstate and headed north, taking them towards the river.
“I know,” mumbled Dean into the crook of Cas’s neck. His lips barely grazing the skin.
“He’s only just woken up, so it’s normal for him to be a bit groggy,” said the nurse. “You might as well sit while you wait for him to become more coherent.” She gestured at the chair pushed in the corner. “I’ll bring another in for you,” she stated while gesturing toward Cas.
“So, I have no idea why I never told you this after everything we have said and done to each other, but…uh…I may have heard you one night.” Cas looked more perplexed, so Dean continued, “I heard you order Jamie to get on his knees and a few other things. And I may have envisioned myself in his position. It was the first time I gave in and jacked off thinking about you.”
Castiel indulged the hunter. “Yes, Dean. Our lovemaking is awesome.”
Within moments, the door opened, and the Director of the FBI walked through.  He immediately entered a room off to the left.  The group of secret service members assigned to their contingent directed them down the hall and into the same room.  The door shut behind them.
Time passed, and Cas did not emerge. Dean, unable to contain his worry, stepped back into the bathroom. “You almost done?  Mom’s got lunch ready for us.”
“If the demon is telling the truth, she's Azazel's kid which maker her the best chance we have of getting them, but she refuses to talk.”
“What she said,” agreed Charlie.  “And I’m sorry I should have led with where the info came from.  Ash stumbled on a legend about a Prince of Hell who up and left hell.  He came to earth and laid down some kind of chronicle.  Just like the Book of the Damned it vanished.  There is always a nugget of truth to each of these stories, so we kept digging.  I’m not going to go into detail about how we got our hands on a copy of parts of it.  Wouldn’t want to start an international incident but trust me the Vatican wouldn’t have buried the existence of it if it wasn’t authentic.”  Charlie had made eye contact with Dean as she spoke.  She was clearly trying to reassure him of the veracity of their conclusions.  Even as his jaw remained clenched, Dean nodded at her, showing his trust in her assessment.  With that she continued, turning her attention back to the room at large.  “We don’t know exactly what Crowley has achieved at this point, but we know for a fact that Lilith has succeeded to some degree.  We finally found the connection between the missing people.  First-born children of mother’s who sold their soul.  Once we knew what we were looking for it was easy to piece it all together.”
But at the same time it is so satisfying ...
"Sorry, bye, Mon Amour," Cass says, as he pulls out his angel sword and stabs it in Dean's chest, while the other could only see how everything started to blur before it got dark.
"Naomi"
... 🩸🩸❣️🩸🩸 ...
Opportunities should never be turned down, even if they come from a stranger with eyes that glow red who claims to be the devil.
"Crowley ..."
-Why what?
"You are calculating, organized and strategic ... I think you will take hell to a place that not even Lucifer himself achieved ... The glory, so yes, I try, it's yours ... But, if I find out that you tried something against me or you get to hinder me ... Believe me, there is no place where you can save yourself from me ..."
"See you later Crowley ...- He answered as the demon left there, and he kept looking for his sword ..."
I think i'm paranoid
"Not my father, not really, or at least I don't consider it, as I once told you, the damned one is just my sperm donor."
Sure with his consent, and supervision.
I have a question for you...
Even so Lucifer found a way to try to corrupt some, which managed to get Adam and Eve out of Eden, but he could not stop there so he began to try to corrupt Abel by telling him that he was God, for his bad or not so bad. Cain found out, and made a deal to save his brother ... Abel's soul in Heaven, while his would go to hell ... Lucifer accepted but with two conditions, the first would be that he would have to kill his brother with his own hands, and the second is that he would have to accept the mark for himself.  So he did and that same day Cain received the mark and that night he killed his brother ... But he could not bear it so he took his life, or at least he tried, since the mark did not let him die, but neither did he live, not completely, making him the first "Knight of Hell" followed by a few more.
-Please go back to my lover.
After the death of his beloved, he managed to live more than 150 years without killing a single person, until a little more than 22 years ago, he went crazy, after my brother sent demons, which only gave him the option to kill them. After its unleashing, they say crazy enough to rape a young woman, although they were only rumors, I think you prove it."
"I think it's your father, Dean."
"About me, I don't know, let's say I saw something special in you ... Something supernatural"
And like he said, he started to move faster and faster, making me run in no time, only to be quickly followed by Cas.
"That you're worth more than he originally thought ..."
I want to explain why I let Naomi take care of it ...
So I finally came out, aiming high ...
"Do you want something darling?" Then Dean raised his head to see the woman and shake his head, because no matter how hungry he was, he simply had no money, the woman was pretty although already somewhat big, maybe John's age, both her hair and her eyes were brown and she had a loving look on her, until a look of surprise filled her face, had she noticed? "Oh honey, you don't have to pay, do you?" *Oh God, she doesn't know what a relief* Dean thought, then he shook his head again "Well, you know what, the house invites this time" That's when the woman went to the kitchen.
"Well it all starts with two brothers, both older than the universe itself, known as "The Darkness" and "The Light" or "God" as it is known, both were very close but ... she was destructive and exterminated everything in his wake, that's why before creating humanity, with the help of his 4 archangels he locked her away, with the purpose of containing her, he succeeded but needed one to take care of her, like a guard at his prison, this task was left to him his favorite son, the brightest, his morning star, Lucifer himself...
He got out of me and put a new tampon in, bigger than the old one, in fact probably bigger than he ever put in me, not counting Cas, of course.
"Ha, normally they would say the devil, you know, most usually forget what it originally is, by the way I like you kid, now who did you see die or ...?"
"You really didn't think I was stupid enough to even investigate?"
-I am an angel of the Lord ...
So I gave her what she requested, putting the sword in her hand, to which it closed on her almost instantly, then I moved her hand to her chest, and seconds later I knew that it was the moment when the room got even colder, making it practically habitable for any human, quite visible breath came out of me ...
❣️🩸🩸🩸❣️
"I'm 10 years old and I killed a man in the basement of my house, and yes, you have magic eyes and maybe you are the devil, so what are you doing here? Are you going to take me to hell or what is your plan for me?"
And that's how Dean finally got out of Hell, hoping he wouldn't have any more distractions or obstacles along the way, but to his bad luck ... Fate was preparing one last (but great and sexy) distraction for him, more or less. ...
-I love you too, Dean, now sleep baby-At his word, I was quickly plunged into darkness.
A few hours later, the celebration began, and all those normal birthday celebration things were done ... Of course with certain differences, after all this was hell ... After a while Dean went to his room with the excuse that he had to go for something, which wasn't really a lie, since he was looking for the first sword ...
After a long time of walking without apparent direction, he managed to reach civilization, but not before washing his blood a little in a small coil that he found on the way. He walked the longest until he came to a small cafe called the Roadhouse, which was apparently also a bar in the evenings, then Dean entered the small establishment that was basically made up of drunken men. He went to a table and sat down, not long after a woman approached him.
I started dating, but first I had to do something ...
Knowing that I died at the hands of nothing more and nothing less than ...
After a few seconds, he recognized who it was ...
"Good luck, Squirrel"
Chapter inspired by the song "Traitor" from "Daughtry"
Leaving that aside, Dean and I got ourselves a not so small mansion, with some help from death, in an intermediate plane of all, with a ... Ahh !!
You know ... I never imagined that he was going to die like this ...
"Who?"
Looking back at Cass's face he noticed that a smile had been shown, and for some reason that made a chill and at the same time an excitement go through her body, which led him to unconsciously bite her lower lip. .
"What is it?"
-Yes, but ... What are you?
"See you soon ... Dad ..."
I am currently at this point in my life that I feel that everything is going well ... I have a stable relationship, I think, I have every existing place in my domain and I have fulfilled everything I want, but ...
"No, and I don't care, all I want is to get revenge, for letting me suffer.  Now I see that you are already turning off so not to make you suffer more ...-" Then I buried the sword again but this time in his heart, finally killing him.-"Goodbye, Mon Amour."
As Dean walked out of there, Crowley left and sat on the throne, only to yell at him as a last resort ...
After a few days he began to feel a presence, powerful ... You could say more than Lucifer, or at least in a different way.
"No, I ... I was born of what they call an abominable act ... A rape."
These last few days I have been feeling that something is wrong, as if someone is following me or watching me, probably both, but it is not only that, but I also have the feeling that something bad is going to happen to me or someone I care about.
❣️🩸🩸🩸❣️
"Very well, it's time to start" Then he approached Dean, the only thing that John did not know is that after a while the boy managed to cut the ropes that supported him, just waiting for the perfect moment to pounce on John, which by the surprise he could not even defend himself, since, although Dean was only a small boy of 10 years he was quite strong, before he knew it Dean already had the bat in his hands, then he gave him a strong blow that left him stunned, and Without even being able to defend himself he saw how Dean hit the bat against the wall only to break in two, at that moment Dean jumped on John leaving him on the floor, with Dean on him, and just the bat that was now in the middle and with large protruding chunks it pierced the chest, then left leaving the man bleeding on the floor. Finally he left the house that was apparently a bit in the middle of nowhere, but without caring it, he walked quietly, because despite being just a child, he already had that cold look with a bloody touch under that charming green . This is how our little brand bearer made the second murder of him at the age of only 10, and you wonder, second? Yes second, because even if no one believed it, John was right, Dean had killed his mother the day he was born, in fact here John's only big mistake had been, not using a stronger material to tie him. .
John Winchester, that man who nine years ago lost his wife to a child of whom he was not even a father, was already at his sixth bottle of alcohol, when he decided it was time, so he went to the basement where the boy was which was turning 9 years of what he called the "day my life was ruined by a child who is not even mine" then as every good father decided that he would give a small gift to the child tied to that post, which he called Dean. He finished going down the stairs to meet the little boy looking at the floor, on his orders a few years ago.
-My name is Castiel
-Why the question?
"Let's just say I'm the new God." Then it occurred to him that that kind of power would serve him well, at least for a while.
After Dean's rebirth we decided to keep traveling for a while, that time being used to plan, but you might wonder ... To plan what? Well that is quite simple, since after already having heaven and hell, what do we lack? ... Exactly, the earth, and if you were thinking about it, we will also take Purgatory, but for that it takes a lot more time, and a little meeting with Eve ...
"What do you want?"
" But ... And, W-who ... is going to h-make ... take care of ... here?"
-Dean, honey, turn around for me.
At that I followed him to the bed where he laid me down.
And then I look down and notice the blood dripping down my chest, as well as the stabbing pain in my lower back, so I turn my face to see who has done it, when I meet my lover's grim smile. ...
"Cass, you're scaring me"
Dean Winchester
But what poor little Cass didn't know is that he was only a means t o an end and all Dean could say was
It did not take me long to decipher it, it was the sword, his body although still lifeless, at least not completely, he managed to move enough to receive what was his, the first sword ...
-O my sweet Dean, so needy, come I'll give you what you want.
I wait 5 more minutes, when I decide that maybe I should leave it for a few moments. So I head to heaven to see how things are going ...
-You should be more careful Castiel, you never know who can betray you.
"Your father?"
After a few hours Dean woke up, as his head lay on Cass's chest, he opened his eyes and turned up only to find perfect sapphire eyes staring at him with the intensity of the sun.
-So ... another angel, I met your brother he was different, right?
Castiel listened in as Darla spoke with Pamela, figuring she left the door open on purpose. “There are some definite triggers concerning the accident and Dean. Also, I believe some research is in order on the topic of angel grace and souls. You mentioned some friends of his are hunters and something about the Men of Letters. Will they be able to help with that aspect of his care?”
“And I hate seeing you so sad and exhausted.”
Walking over and flopping down next to Cas, Gabriel sighed dramatically.  “It was a long-standing bet.  I held out for as long as I could, but…”
“Dean guess what?” Castiel ran into Dean’s bedroom with a huge grin on his face.
“Jesus, are you high?” asked Dean with a squeak, cheeks flushing.
“I’d love to,” said Cas as he turned off the shower.  They dried quickly, so they could place their order.  While Cas made the call, Dean flipped through the channels.  He was still flipping through them when Cas approached the bed.  “You should probably put some clothes on before the food arrives.”
“I’m not,” denied Dean, but there was uncertainty under the surface of the words. “I’m not,” he repeated even more tentatively. He turned to look at Sam, and his face dawned with realization. “Fuck. What the hell is wrong with me?” Sam stayed silent. His brother needed to find his own way to the truth. “Aren’t you going to say something?”
An idea finally struck, and Cas was quick to suggest it.  “How about we establish some parameters?  Possibly a weekly call or text.”
Cas shook his head and smiled when he realized Dean, despite his observations, refused to let go.  Within seconds, Dean retightened his grip.  “It’s not much different than when you wrap yourself around me and we’re both drenched in sweat.”
“I see what you’re doing Cas, and I want you to stop it,” stated Charlie.  Her tone was firm and brooked no argument.  “I was prepared for what happened.  We all were.  It was a risk that was weighed and measured.  You knew there was a chance this would happen and so did I.  I chose to be here, so let whatever you’re thinking go.  We survived it.”
Dean gaped at Cas before looking back at Gabriel who was rummaging through the fridge.  “Okay, I can see how Naomi is related to your mom, but how the hell is that related to your dad.  I mean, come on, they are polar opposites.  They don’t even look alike.”
“Likewise,” said Dean, leaning in and pecking Cas on the lips.
“I…I…” Cas stopped his attempts at speaking and dropped his head.
After several minutes and with some maneuvering, they managed to squeeze the couch next to Cas’s chair. With a huff, Dean sat down on it.  “You want to join me,” he said, smiling at Cas while patting the space next to him.  Cas smiled and nodded.  As Antonio approached, Dean said, “I got him.”
Cas thought about giving a long answer with several reasons, but since her assumption was basically correct, he responded, “It is,” just as Dean said, “It’s not that simple.”  Cas’s eyes snapped to Dean, seeing sincerity in his gaze.
“Love you,” whispered Dean.
Victor shook his head but did not comment.  “To explain his role, I will turn it over to Charlie Bradbury.”
Head still down, Dean saw Cas’s feet enter his field of vision. He felt the looming presence of his husband, and this time it did not bring arousal. This time it brought a wave of self-hatred and loss. “I want you to be happy Cas, even if it’s not with me.”
Sunshine glinted off the Colt as Crowley took a step back.  His movement was halted by the edge of the Devil’s trap they had ensnared him in.  Crowley stared at the gun, a dark laugh escaping his lips.  “I did not see that coming.  Well-played.”
“Because you are so sure I will fully recover.  I remember what it was like.  You believed Mary would go into remission, and when she didn’t and she deteriorated a little every day, it broke you piece by piece.  All I could do was watch it happen and hold you when you shattered.  I don’t want you to face that again.  I don’t think I would be strong enough to help you this time because I have my own broken pieces.”
Cas shrugged. Unsure if Dean could see the motion, he said, “You eventually saw me.”
“We are here now.”
Cas merely
“But Bobby..”
“Did you know Elkins was a descendant of Samuel Colt?  A descendant of one of the two original hunter families.  They were rivals and disagreed on almost every aspect of hunting.  Bobby said when the demons went after the families, members of the Colt family went into hiding.  Elkins, the Colt, disappeared overnight.  But it’s possible the timing was different.  Maybe Elkins disappeared earlier.”
It wasn’t that he needed the money. The studio was successful, and the sales of his works were extremely profitable. It was the fact the work failed at being challenging, and now that life at home had settled into a rhythm Cas missed the challenge. He stared at the computer screen, not really reading the email in front of him. After several seconds, he forced himself to concentrate on the words. The request before him fit his purview. Any issue that dealt with children peaked his interest. The logistics of this particular offer, however, would take him too far from home. The next few emails were similar. Frustrated he shut the laptop, deciding to table the idea for the moment. Needing a change of scenery, he picked up the car keys. He didn’t often go out, but he wanted a drink and to feel the press of a warm body.
She had tried to use an upbeat tone, but Dean heard the despair running through it.  Hopping up, he said, “Sounds like a great idea.”  He didn’t give Cas time to protest, making a beeline for the door.  Everyone else seemed to understand and followed him.  Cas, of course, was the last to move, but he did eventually join Dean at the door.  Cas’s nerves were palpable as they left the house and made for one of the outbuildings.  “You’ll do fine,” Dean said, leaning in to whisper as he rested his hands on Cas’s shoulders.  Once inside, Dean leaned against the wall by the door and let Benny take the lead.  His friend easily maneuvered around the room, introducing Cas to the other five people in the room, two in wheelchairs like Cas.  As they went, Sergeant Mills stayed close by their sides.  After the introductions, they gathered in a circle and started to talk.  Cas’s eyes found Dean’s.  It was as if a full conversation passed between in the few heartbeats their gazes remained locked on each other.  With a small smile, Dean nodded and backed out the door.  Unsurprisingly Bobby was waiting for him just outside.
A restless energy filled Dean, forcing him out of the chair.  “So, did I do the right thing?  Leaving the way I did?  Or did I make it worse?” he asked tentatively.
The three of them walked out to the car, and for some reason all of them turned to glance back at the house. Their home. With a smile and a shrug, Dean slipped into the driver’s seat. Cas joined him in the front as Sam continued to look at the house. A few heartbeats later the younger Winchester slid into the backseat. “This is not like when I was fourteen. I am not riding back here the whole time.”
“Why are you sorry Sammy?”
“They don’t, but they can slow ‘em down.  Jody’s a great shot.  Gave me time to take them both out.”
“You’re all sweaty,” said Lily with a grimace.
Taking a deep breath, Dean dropped his head.  “Cas, I’m not sure springing a bunch of people on her is a good idea.  And I don’t know if Jody would want Alex to be a part of this.”
“I know,” said Cas, “It just gets tiring sometimes.  The constant back and forth makes it feel like he doesn’t trust me.”
“What?” The younger man’s voice cracked as he stared open-mouthed.
“Well, you thought wrong.”  There was power in Castiel’s voice as he continued, “You, Dean Winchester, are astounding.”  Frozen under Cas’ intense gaze, Dean swallowed, but did not move.  “I love waking up with you.  There is this quiet moment when everything in the world seems right.  I hear you breathing and feel your warmth.  It soothes every ache I have inside.  Only you can do that.”
Castiel touched Dean’s hand lightly. “I am glad I know. I’m glad you felt you could tell me how your body reacts to me.”
The first thought Cas had was about his flight leaving in three hours.  His second was who cares.  He had the next two days off, and Victor could do the damn paperwork for once.  Without answering Dean, Cas rolled over, scrambling at the side of the bed as he searched for his pants.
“No more talking, Dean.  I want this.  I want you, and I’ve kept us waiting long enough.”  Cas moved swiftly, hands shifting behind Dean, untying the apron and lifting if off in one fluid movement.  Dean’s shirt followed, dropped to the floor without ceremony, forgotten, hands already moving to the button on Dean’s jeans.  A gasp drew Cas out of his singular focus to get Dean naked.  His eyes snapped up to the other man’s face.  All hesitation and concern were gone from Dean’s green eyes.  In their place was unabashed desire.  The look held Cas firmly, captivating him, making him stare intently, trying to relay he felt the same.
“Sam, we haven’t finished talking about the issues," said Cas, voice laced with concern.
Blushing, Dean whispered, “I aim to please.”
“You’re welcome. And I don’t want to pressure you, but Sam will understand. His opinion of you won’t change.”
“Hannah.”
“We know Sam.  We heard it all the time.” Kevin patted Sam’s arm and then pitched his voice higher.    “
Dean huffed a dark laugh.  “You wouldn’t if you knew what I’ve done.  Who I’ve been.”
, she told Cas the first time he came with Dean to visit. As she brought a glass to her lips, she spotted him. She nodded once and tipped her head to the right. His gaze shifted in that direction. Dean was seated on the top step of the porch, just barely in his line of sight. Something must have caught his attention, whether it was her reaction or the sound of his car mattered little. What mattered was the hard eyes settling first on the car and then on Cas’s face. In a flash, worry filled his bright green eyes. Before Cas even pulled to the curb to park, Dean was across the street and reaching for his door. He pounded on the window as soon as the car came to a stop. Cas almost didn’t open the door, but he had already played the coward the previous morning he didn’t want a repeat performance. He opened the door, and Dean lit into him.
“And I’m worried about you,” Dean said, cutting Cas off.  “I saw your face when we saw the armed men on our way here.”
“Thank you,” said Dean, relief and sincerity evident in his tone.  “I’ve got you,” he added as he guided Cas out to the car.  “We’ll call and update you as soon as we know anything.”  Cas turned to see who Dean was addressing.  Talia had her armed wrapped around Charlie’s waist.  Alex was standing directly in front of Jody and Mara was at her side.  Their expressions were grave as they looked at Cas.  Alex gave him a small wave and Cas attempted a smile.  He hoped it was enough to convey his appreciation for their concern.  “Come on, Cas,” said Dean, holding the passenger door open.  With a final nod at the group, Cas slid into the car.
“That is not what you were supposed to focus on in that stream of words, Cas.  But yeah, I cry.  Keeping it together is too damn hard sometimes.  It’s better now that we talked about not putting on a happy front, but it still happens.  I hate seeing you in pain.”
Still refusing to look at Dean, Cas shook his head.  “How about we talk about the last couple days?” suggested Naomi.  “I understand there was some difficulty.”
“Ah…there it is. I knew you had it in you.” The demon laughed and then disappeared.
Cas stopped, grateful for the command because his rambling was about to get out of control.  He clamped his mouth shut and closed his eyes, letting the quiet wash over him.  They remained silent the rest of the ride.  As they carried the groceries into the house, they discovered packed bags by the door.  “Going somewhere,” Dean yelled when he spotted Bobby.
“Jesus, Bobby,” Dean said as he pulled the older man into a hug.  Bobby patted his back, eyeing Cas over Dean’s shoulder.  He gave Cas a discerning look, posing a question with that singular look.  Cas nodded, assuring Bobby he was not going anywhere.
“We talked about having the reception in one, but the grand parlor, or whatever it’s called, is freaking huge and never gets used, so Madilyn suggested we hold the reception in there.  The tent would be for pre-wedding drinks and hors d’oeuvres.  That way everyone can keep warm until the ceremony.”
Shaking his head, Dean said, “I don’t get it. Why did he want you to know that?”
Dean sat up and pointed an accusatory finger at Claire.  “Hey, now.  I always treat Cas right on special occasions, but today is not our anniversary.”
“Me, too,” answered Dean with a mouthful of food.
“The Barrett’s.”
The backyard was crowded with their friends and family, and it was filled with love and laughter. Only four months ago the prospect of such a day was not even remotely on the horizon. Yet here they were, seven months since the fire which gutted them all, still standing and somehow smiling. Holding hands, Cas and Dean wandered among the people they love thinking about all the changes in their lives over the last year.
An hour later, Sam walked in carrying his hamper. Dean and Cas both tried to apologize, but Sam interrupted them. “Stop. I’ve heard it all before. And I do not want to hear the details. I repeat I DO NOT want to know the details.”
Dean’s shoulders shook with suppressed laughter. “He says he’s indifferent to sexual orientation.”
“I know.  But it still surprises me,” said Dean, punctuating his statement with a kiss.  “In a good way.”  Cas nodded in response, eliciting a wide grin from Dean.  “Now, you’ve been lazy for long enough.  Time to shower.”
Dean shook his head.  “We are not talking about either of those things now.  We are going to walk in that building and get to work.  No more stalling.”
“Hello to you too, Sammy.”
Looking down, Jensen saw Misha’s text.
Dean stared at the demon.  “And how do you know that.”
“Oh,” replied Cas. “I guess I was thinking about how similar we are.”
Pain flashed across Dean’s face and Cas wondered how an abstract conversation about myths could elicit such a reaction.  It prompted him to ask, “Why?”
“The only possible way you could be in Iowa is if you drove all damn night,” said Cas, anger simmering just under the surface.  “Dammit, Dean.”
It wasn’t sympathy or pity he had seen in her face. Charlie was scared.
“Yeah, it was,” whispered Dean as he encircled Cas in his arms.
“Not everything,” Dean said matter-of-factly.
“Wait, what?” asked Dean.
“That’s harsh,” muttered Dean under his breath.
“What am I doing exactly?”
“Makes sense, but what the hell is quinoa?” asked Dean.
Without acknowledging Dean’s comment, the angel walked over to Meg. “She’s right. He’s here. I felt his grace.” Gabriel explained his findings in more detail. As he spoke, Dean pulled out the map. He marked down the areas the angel searched and the warding found there. He did the same for the information provided by the demons. Having already marked what Pamela and he found, they had a pretty decent outline of the area and a potential location for the actual facility. There was little else they could do until Sam and the others arrived so once again the entire group piled into the car. After stopping for food, they arrived at the motel. Dean set about booking extra rooms while Pamela hauled the food into the room.
“I assume it’s sort of a soulmate thing.  Tied together for eternity or something like that.”  Dean’s tone was jovial, and his face was lit up with amusement.
“I assume you’ve met everyone,” said Cas.
“How so?”
The expression on Cas’s face softened, and his lips quirked up in a barely-there smile. “I love you, Dean.”
“Yeah, Bobby told me he drove you home, but that doesn’t explain your hasty exit.” Dean stopped and waved at the clock on the wall. “Or why it took you hours to shower and change. I needed you here.”
“Where indeed,” said Cas as he rounded the corner and pulled the cart to an abrupt stop.  “Sheriff?  Sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going.”
“Good,” Cas said as he untangled their fingers and pushed himself back.  Dean whined, but Cas shushed him by pressing his fingers into the small of his back.
“What?” Dean asked, nudging Cas’s shoulder.  Tipping his head to the side, Cas raised a questioning brow.  “You were all pensive, and then you got this weird little smile.”
“I am happy. So very happy. Loving Dean and being a part of my chosen family makes me happy.” The truth of the statement hit Cas square in the chest. He chose his family, and he could choose to expand it. He had the choice to open his heart and to forgive or to let past hurts linger. It was an easy decision. Hannah was here before him, apologizing and expecting nothing in return. That factor said a lot about the woman his sister had become. Maybe they both deserved a chance to get to know each other as adults. “Hannah, I want to thank you for your honesty. I also want to thank you for not pressuring me. And I think I’d be willing to spend some time with you.”
