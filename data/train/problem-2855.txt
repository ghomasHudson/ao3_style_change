As he looks around, his mind automatically trying to piece two and two together, he’s glad to see he doesn’t seem restrained in any way nor is he sharing the space with any guards, mafia bosses or other patients for that matter. In a split moment of what he assumes is a painkiller infused daze, Castiel does wonder where Mr. Winchester is, if the man is even there.
Castiel hands over his Visa with trembling hands, heart already sinking before even daring to confront the numbers on that paper. What he reads surpasses even his wildest expectations. One meal came down to a figure that exceeded half of his monthly income.
And just like that, Mr. Winchester up and leaves the room, leaves Cas wondering what in the hell just happened. What was up with the mild temper today? First there’s Dean declaring ‘I need you’, then there’s the understanding gestures and the seemingly nurturing attention. Now a man who’s been spoiled by servants all his life runs off to get food at the slightest hint of hunger?
Melissa ignores it all. She ignores the scars, the bruises, even the marks on his arms- still there years after they’d been punctured by needles over and over again- are equally treated, no part of him left abused. It’s almost as if she spoils him just
but before he can further tumble down a path of wondering if perhaps she’s held here against her will, Paula is nudging him with a bowl full of fresh fruit that just absolutely smell like heaven. It suddenly seems days since he’s last eaten.
It’s just a split second, but Cas finds himself skimming his eyes over the freshly baked and still warm assortment of croissants, muffins and various pastries. Not for himself, for Mr. Winchester. “Anything else?” Anna asks curiously. Her question startles him a bit, like a child getting caught in the act of doing something it shouldn’t, so he quickly shakes his head. “No, no, uh- thank you.”
“Oh. No, no, he’s got it.” Dean explains. “Don’t you, Mr. Novak?” But before Cas can utter another word, defend himself, anything, Dean has his back turned on him already, motioning to the valet to notify the personal driver.
This time, Castiel cocks the gun and nearly snaps out of his trance-like fright by how much louder it sounds now that it’s produced by his very own fingers. There’s purpose, no destination though a clear trajectory. It --no,
The woman introduces herself as Melissa while she’s already guiding him towards a massage table, her arm behind his back but not touching him, she even waits for Cas to make the first move in removing his bathrobe before she calmly extends her hands to take it from him and neatly hang the silk to avoid crinkling it.
“Cas-“ Gabriel whispers, his excited shatter coming to a shrieking halt just in time to notice his brother’s genuine distress. He takes Castiel’s hand gently. “Cas, does he hurt you? For real? Because if so; you can tell me, you
Castiel wants to run out the door just as Mr. Winchester had done but a bodyguard firmly pulls him away before he has a chance to do so. “No!” he screams, “Dean!”. He can only see blood, and then,
Dean Winchester wasn’t the kind of man you could quit, definitely not the type of person whose contract you could end. At least not without providing your very own death sentence. Overcoming addiction, for Castiel, had been characterized by a new breath of life blown directly into his still smouldering lungs which he accepted so eagerly, so desperately that he ran without ever looking back. And that was a privilege.
He’s been sitting on that chair for at least twelve hours, though his judgement could be off. After all, Cas’s only way of semi-telling the time is whenever Dean leaves the room and is too quick in opening another door in the adjacent corridor, giving way to distant light trickling in from somewhere Castiel cannot pinpoint.
“No,” Mr. Winchester says in the softest voice Castiel has ever heard from the man, “I didn’t do this, sweetheart. Are you going to tell me what happened?”
There isn’t even the need for words this time. When Dean’s eyes make contact with the driver, there’s enough momentum of anger behind it that it makes the car go silent promptly.
“No! Stop! Do you even fucking hear yourself? You murdered someone in cold blood without giving it a second thought. You probably went home after that, wiped off the blood with your fricking velvet towels or something and then got under your satin sheets as if nothing happened! You’re nothing more than a killer! How in the hell are you better than Ketch or any of those men you make deals with, huh?!”
And the bonds broken? Those will follow the traces of equally fractured bones, perhaps even growing within when the wounds heal but damage remains.
“Twenty years, Cas, twenty years! Every goddamn time my phone rings I still hold my breath in fear of it being someone telling me you’re dead, that you overdosed and wound up in a ditch somewhere! Do you know what that’s like? To constantly worry about your baby brother, not because he’s an idiot but because he’s an addict!”
That comment seems to hit Mr. Winchester somewhere deep inside. It’s not hurt, Castiel is still convinced this man is utterly incapable of actual emotions, so that’s impossible, but it does make something falter in the previously well kept together green eyes. It’s as if a realization set in, as if Dean only now noticed a detail he shouldn’t have overlooked in the first place.
Hours and hours of research and all Castiel got was a big fat nothing. Not a single mention of any kids named ‘Ben’, let alone helpful information on what in the hell Paula had been talking about. She wouldn’t discuss it anymore, no matter how sweetly Castiel asked her about it, so he was on his own on this. His days scanning the internet brought him to empty answers time after time to such an extend he actually started questioning whether he even heard her right or if it had been a fickle of his imagination.
He can only stare up at the furious green eyes in disbelief as his heart breaks impossibly further. All he wanted was to be held, to have someone hug him tightly while they whispered it was going to be alright, that it was just a nightmare.
, he was his usual, charming self: keeping one arm around Castiel’s waist and laughing ever so sweetly as they made their way through the almost impenetrable swarm of people suddenly overly interested in their private, pretend life.
When they do slow down, tires hitting a more uneven road, Castiel doesn’t recognize where they are. It almost looks as if they’re driving through a forest with how thick and unkept the trees are here, barely any light illuminating the path either so they’re definitely far out of any major city and therefore; a long way from home.
Cas can barely hear a thing over the club’s obnoxiously loud music. It’s perfect. Though he does wonder why the guy he face fucked in the bathroom only minutes ago (Darrick? Darion?
But Castiel clocks out somewhere in the middle of Gabriel’s rally about climate and how scandalous it is that big name brands get away with their dirt on the streets. Once upon a time this topic would have interested Cas and he would have jumped on the occasion to politely debate about it with someone, though right now he’s got bigger problems on his mind.
Castiel can hear the voice slowly, yet still all too rapidly counting down from five, each number almost coming as an unwelcome surprise to him despite knowing very well that four is undeniably followed by three and that there’s no way of stopping it.
“Ready?” he asks, meaning he’d like staff members to fuck off and leave them alone now. As soon as they leave, Dean can see some of that nervousness he’d gotten to know exceptionally well over the past few months find its way back into the man before him, though, Dean isn’t fazed by it. He knows Castiel will do well tonight and finally present how it’s always been expected of him.
But before Castiel can start negotiating with her, she takes an annoyed breath and gives one of those motherly scowls that equally fills him with guilt yet also with child-like excitement, much like someone who, in the end, got what he wanted. “Sinco minutos!”
“You,” Mr. Winchester growls, “this is all your fault. Do you even know what you have done?! We’re at war, you hear me? And all because you couldn’t keep your damn legs shut! You’re a fucking whore and you’re going to pay for it!”
“Don’t!” Dean snaps. It’s already too late when Castiel realizes it was directed at Teddy running up to the small puddle and not at him, but what difference does it make? He’s scared out of his mind for the punishment sure to come. A nearly one hundred pound dog having another go at pushing him into the corner isn’t exactly helping and Cas just loses it.
No further questions are asked, Melissa simply does exactly as she said she would: select beauty products yet Cas doesn’t know whether he should be relieved or anxious. These people are professionals, they’re trained to always be polite and keep comments to themselves, so what if she doesn’t believe him? What if she’s suspicious and starts interrogating him? What if-
The jokes and soft laughter do a good job at hiding the worry, they even almost masqueraded the pain in a confession though while it’s hurtful, it’s also a reassurance that Gabe is still Gabe and that the world still moves along.
“You know how I know you’re lying, Mr. Novak?” he asks after a tense few seconds. “You claim these people, these neighbors, called the cops because they were
“No, doctor” he manages to say, regardless of how much it pains him to lie his way through what could possibly have been his only way out.
Dean just takes a deep breath as he clenches his jaw and looks away for a second. He needed to tread lightly, this wasn’t a time for more drama than there already was so he finally walks into the room and crouches down. “What’s wrong?”
Dean sits down instead and takes a gulp of Scotch. “Anyway, as I was saying. You’re lucky. The doctor said you’ll be fine.”
Castiel waves the probing fingers away from his face and shakes his head when asked if it was Mr. Winchester’s pet who did that. “No, just some dog” he lies, no breaths left for further explanations.
Pondering didn’t do him much good. On the contrary. While his mind was racing, screaming hazy sentences at him, to the outside world –to Mr. Winchester- he was just being quiet. It could easily be mistaken for defiance, or in this case: ungratefulness.
One contract, now adorned by his signature, was indeed meant to resemble a marriage contract, binding them together in a hateful act of rivalry masked by a pretentious act of love. This was the base of it all for it held the financial end of the entanglement, so long as Castiel followed the rules, it would protect him against any money related issues he might encounter.
Castiel knows he’s right, knows he’d never win in court and that the best case scenario would be his career ruined with the possibility of a hefty, monetary fine on top.
But when Mr. Winchester cuts through the satin ribbon as effortlessly as the applause rolls over him, there’s only one place his mind drifts to. And that’s Castiel.
, time I’ve ever seen him cry. It wasn’t a father abandoning his child, it was a father trying to save his son.”
“And?” Oh, for fuck’s sake. He turns his head away in annoyance for a second before snapping his eyes back up to meet those resting amidst a thousand freckles. “And what?” The response comes out a little more agitated than he’d expected, apparently it was harder to contain your frustrations when there’s a power hungry shmuck trying to beat you into submission with nothing but a smooth tongue and a gaze that makes you squirm.
There’s another bout of silence between them and Castiel can clearly picture her apologetic smile in his head. At least over the phone she doesn’t get to see the tears running down his cold cheeks.
“It was nice meeting you. I’ll be sure to invite you over so we can all have dinner together. Of course it will have to be after this poor thing feels better, huh?”
Dean’s nasty gaze shuts him right up, arguments about it only being one minute past eight long forgotten under the sanguinary eyes laid upon his twitching body. Before he can even receive his first order of the day (if he won’t get completely ignored that is), an elegant lady clicks her way over to the CEO’s desk where she deposits what looks like a file, her movements unnecessarily slow and her chest so happens to be almost right in his face.
Dean’s fingers drag along the steel countertop Castiel can only imagine as being cold to the touch. It’s strange to watch, the sheer nonchalance portrayed, it almost resembles an out-of-body experience for him. He’s beyond terrified, so much so that the thought of urinating on himself from fear doesn’t seem too farfetched, or perhaps he’s done it already. There’s no telling anymore.
His heart feels like it’s about to stop, or maybe it has already, he can’t really feel it anymore. She’s getting too close. Too involved. Does she knows something he doesn’t?
Dean had seemed shaken, out of it even, something unseen for a man so occupied with remaining composed at any given moment, as if life’s only purpose is to serve up a flawless act of self-preservation. But then comes the big finale and the curtains close.
it rings in his head, reminding him of his slip up that might as well could have gotten him fired so he takes a deep breath in, lifts his chin, and puts on his best fake smile perfectly matching Mr. Winchester’s one as he approaches the gathering of chatters.
He’d been surprised at the kindness at first, wondering how in the Hell such nice people ended up being a part of Mr. Winchester’s staff. Ten seconds in, he noticed it: the logo on their all-black outfits, telling him that this was an outside business, probably only hired for this specific occasion. Too bad, really, he was rather enjoying the gentle attention and pampering for once.
The only reason Cas ends up jerking himself off is because he can’t exactly return to their guests with a boner straining in already tight suit pants. When he does enter the lobby again, Dean is nowhere to be found so the search for Gabriel begins again. Just as Mr. Winchester had said: Cas finds his brother surrounded by a group of young women who appear perfectly entertained, until he interrupts them, of course.
“Do you- fucking understand?!” Even with the fingers digging into his jaw, even with that gun carving threats into his chest, Castiel still shakes his head. No, no way was he going to murder someone.
They sleep in separate rooms that night. Not exactly the honeymoon Castiel had hoped for but in hindsight, he’s awfully grateful for their distance and is glad for the peace, that is, if you ignore the men posted at his door. At least this way he’s got time to think and it’s not like any aspect of their relationship was normal anyway.
Despite how hungry he is though, Castiel eats his food slowly. Painstakingly so and all with one purpose that unfortunately brings forth a haunting reminder with every bite because you see, his chest still aches, it pulls and twists every time burnt skin twitches against a satin-silk mix.
“How allergic?” Having a ginormous white dog seemingly consisting only of teeth, muscle and a hunger for human flesh yapping at you does not make it easy to concentrate on any questions whatsoever so it takes Castiel a moment, only managing to gasp out a one-word response. “Very!”
“Fuck, yes.” Ketch breathes out as he pushes further and further. “No wonder that American prick kept you as a play thing.” What is it with these men and relishing in another person’s suffering? Castiel had questioned if it was just Mr. Winchester who carried such cruel urges but as he lay there, being pounded between sobs and cries, hard thrusts slamming into him without stopping, the last of his hope for the world to carry goodness leaks out of him like the liquids trickling down his thighs.
So, here he is; watching his own tears drip into the cold coffee as he tries to let the scented drink clear his mind from remembering how it felt to consume lips almost seeming hungry for him. It hadn’t been the first time their skin had been pushed against each other in a wave of everything hot and heavy, but last night, Dean hadn’t forcefully taken him. It had been sweet, leaving Castiel feeling secure rather than petrified.
He’s pulled from his thoughts when Mr. Winchester darts back into the room, almost coming off as nervous. “It’s not much, uh- yeah, here.”
“If you say so.” Gabriel answers genuinely with a small smile. “I guess you just looked a little sad, is all. Maybe it’s that ugly face of yours.”
However, Gabriel is completely star-struck by the man because let’s be honest: who isn’t? But Cas couldn’t give two fucks. At least with his brother by his side, plus being in a relatively busy restaurant, meant he was undoubtedly going to be treated to another round of spectacular play-pretend.
“What’s wrong with you?” The harsh words startle him more than he’d care to admit but the way he’s unable to answer the question must give him away. The woman now notices him for the first time since she’d walked in and just like the initial time they met, she’s exactly as embarrassed by the moves she made on Castiel’s ‘husband’. “Anyway,” Mr. Winchester continues, slightly agitated, “this here is my new assistant. She's just so…
What the hell just happened? Did they really go from screaming their lungs out about murder to Dean acting like some sort of concerned husband in a perfectly domestic scenario? “Mr. Winchester-“ Castiel blurts out not knowing where to go from there.
He doesn’t remember being led into yet another different room, each door they pass making the music fade and the world quieter until there’s nothing but the sound of ragged breaths against his heaving chest. There’s fingers dipping themselves into his underwear and grabbing his flaccid cock, barely proving themselves enough to keep him grounded but in the end, he manages to push them away. “Fuck off” he hisses, “I’m- I’m too-“
Pitching the idea about a brand new factory on the banks of wealthy New Jersey had been a calculated risk, if they would indulge in this investment, it would be their most ambitious to date and it had left the attendees in the large meeting room quite breathless in all honesty.
“Now, I have another announcement for you.” Mr. Winchester smiles, looking right at the dozens of cameras, eyes twinkling whilst the crowd starts murmuring in excitement. “I’d finally like to introduce someone to the world, someone very dear to me.” The fucker even goes so far as to take in a deep breath, pretending to get a little overwhelmed before extending his hand towards where Castiel is standing between the hundreds of high society guests, staring up at him. “Mr. Novak.”
The anger he expected. But the fear? That was a rarity, though in that moment, as he looks up, straight into the face of the person who dragged him into this mess in the first place, it lay clear as day: fear. Raw, panicked, and present in abundance like no other emotion had ever shown itself within the cold,
Donna ends up breaking the heaviness between them first by whispering something to him, telling Cas she’d like to ask him something, to be precise. “Listen, this might sound weird but I need to know. Are you in any danger, Castiel?”
The blood dripping down on smooth wood holds his attention more than Mr. Winchester’s harsh commands, the instant throbbing sensation offering a distraction from his heart going a million miles a minute with all the adrenaline travelling through. “For fuck’s sake!” Dean screams angrily. Whether it’s at him or the dog, Castiel doesn’t know.
When they pull apart and turn around, an older woman is standing near the end of the driveway, just a few feet away from them. “I don’t mean to pry or anything, but I saw the cops and, you know.”
‘But why not go to the house?’ Castiel used to wonder. Not only because he longed to return home to some peace and quiet after another excruciating day, but also because he couldn’t simply pretend none of the suspicious activities weren’t happening right there under his nose either.
He can see them standing in the living room but beside the vague words here and there, Cas can’t make out what they’re saying. Judging by the occasional frowned glances, which he pretends to ignore, it’s about him. More specifically: his physical condition.
For the first time, a verbal outburst from Dean had actually been welcome, anything to have the man at least acknowledge the fact something happened between them that night that was more than a spur of the moment, lust induced, craving kind of connection.
Castiel is honestly losing his patience here, not due to his brother’s behavior -he’s used to it- but due to the unfortunate timing of it all. He’s already feeling unwell and downright jittery from the amount of anxiety waiting for him after every turn, being subjected to such a question is tricky enough as it is, he doesn’t need the added jokes and subtext. Not right now.
“Excuse me? That’s my company’s money you’d be throwing away. You know what?” Mr. Winchester squints at him. “Your lack of respect is baffling. You’re gonna eat the fricking donut, you understand me?”
“Well, Mr. Ketch, your beef with the Dominicans ain’t my problem, just keep your business up in Five Points next time, huh? But-“
“Don’t look so surprised,” groans Mr. Ketch, “you’re not here to act as a piece of decoration or something, you’re not
was putting it lightly when talking about how that very hand would gently rest against his side when they were facing yet another aristocrat of sorts, but held him with a grip capable of bruising whenever no onlooker was there to see, pinching painfully in-between friendly chatter and plastic smiles. If Castiel didn’t know better, the act was almost believable.
Not another second is lost on words when Cas gets pushed into the mattress face down and pinned under the weight of another man who’s currently riled up and fretful, rough hands yanking his pants down without a shred of compassion. It hurts beyond belief where his burned chest is pressed against the comforter, stealing away his breaths needed to get objections out in the first place, but that’s nothing compared to the excruciating pain of a cock entering him with nothing but a coated condom as lube.
When Castiel turned his head and sniffed him, sighing happily, Dean pretended that was a totally normal thing to do, and when Castiel shimmied his back across the bed to share Dean’s pillow, his head nestling in the crook of Dean’s arm, Dean went ahead and pretended that was fine, too, guiltily savoring the heat of Castiel’s body pressing against his side.
Dean watched Castiel carefully cut the pie into perfect eighths, plate three wedges with his only spatula, scoop out ice cream with what looked like a brand new ice cream scoop. Dean accepted his plate with a gracious smile, his fork poised to dive in, but he didn’t take a bite until he watched Castiel carefully cut a bite with his fork, spear a sliver of ice cream, pop it in his mouth. Castiel did not make a sound, but his eyes slipped closed and his eyelashes actually fluttered in pleasure, Dean’s entire body flushing with warmth to see it. Only then did Dean take a bite, nodding in satisfaction as the crust melted in his mouth. The fancy grass-fed organic butter Castiel had insisted on
“Regardless of your decision, I will keep your secret, Dean, you have my word. You don’t have to worry about that.”
“Cas, when you asked, I - I thought you meant the other way around. Y’know, me, under you. I mean, you’re right, we could die any minute, and if there’s really no one else you want, I don’t mind stepping up...“
Anna spilled his chips when she threw her arms around him, her cheeks wet, but Castiel didn’t mind, just hugged her as long as he wanted, refusing to let go until she giggled, kissing the top of her head as she laughed and finally releasing her, smiling at her fondly.
Castiel’s voice dropped to a barely audible murmur, but Dean heard every word as if he were shouting, holding his expression perfectly blank while the inexplicable thrill tickled up and down his spine.
to start stuff anytime you want. Even if I’m asleep, or - or drunk, okay?” Dean turned to do battle with the lettuce as he declared emphatically,  “I am
Castiel carried the hamper down to the laundry room to shove the sheets in the washer and to bring Dean’s duffel up to the bedroom. When he knocked on the bathroom door Dean was just climbing into the claw foot tub, and he yelled “Come in!” with far more ease than the last time he’d done the same, sighing into the stream of water, soaping his pits rapidly so he wouldn’t waste a drop of hot water.
Dean scrambled to his feet, laughing, clambered onto a dry section of the sticky sheets, and propped himself on his back on the covers and one of the thick white pillows, squirting lube into his palm urgently, like Castiel might change his mind. The reality of the situation only hit him as he wrapped his hand around his cock and looked up at Castiel’s gorgeous face, lips parted, his undivided attention curling around Dean’s awareness like a physical caress, heavy, and sensual.
“Har har,” Dean cut in, before Sam could ask for more details. “I doubt Jimi Hendrix meant basketball. Go shower Cas, the sweat in my ass crack is starting to dry up and itch.”
Dean fought sleep for as long as he could, relishing the feeling of Castiel’s heartbeat against his chest, until at last the gentle rhythm of Castiel’s breathing pulled him under and sleep took him, the weight he didn’t realize he was carrying around his eyes smoothing away and making him look just as peaceful as the man he loved, gently slumbering in his arms.
“I have found they are still perfectly edible at twelve hours and a few minutes, and no one notices if I eat them in the back room instead of putting them in the garbage can.”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean whispered over his shoulder, raising his machete theatrically towards the sky, “Let’s do this.”
Castiel grinned. “No onion. There’s a possibility my boyfriend might stay over after dinner and I have it on good authority onion breath can be off-putting.”
Castiel was the one to spit himself this time, horrified but laughing, and Dean held the door for him as they left his office, taking Castiel’s horrortainment firmly as a win.
Castiel smiled at him, his hand twitching as though he wanted to put it on Dean’s shoulder, but remaining resolutely at his side. Dean crossed the distance Castiel could not, reaching out to grasp Castiel’s shoulder, which was distractingly solid under his deceptively accountant-esque suit, and look him square in the eye.
Castiel ran a finger down Dean’s rib cage, trailing sparks, smirking at the difference in the way Dean’s hissed intake of breath sounded now.
, boy, Castiel is one of my best customers. It’s been a while since he came back from Afghanistan to pick up his girls though - I boarded them, you know, he paid for a whole new greenhouse just so I could - “
“Sammy! I’m moving up in the world,” Dean hollered, pressing the bottle into the ball of dough and grinning up at Sam as he wandered over to see what the fuss was all about.
Castiel obeyed as soon as Dean released him, but Dean shook his head in horror and Castiel laughed and course corrected to the other bed that
Castiel shook his head slowly, his face downcast.  “No, I’m sorry Dean, I don’t have one of those either.”
“I will not fuck you on the floor, Dean,” Castiel answered his unspoken inquiry. “I am a gentleman.” He grinned ferally as he continued talking, his hand stroking Dean’s cock far more gently than Dean would have expected from being shoved to the floor. “You have granted me permission without asking my intent. I will not continue this time without more explicit permission Dean, although I promise you those times will come, this time I need you to be certain. You may stop me at any time including right now without penalty or punishment. I will not be upset or disappointed and I will still give you an orgasm. I wish to give you pleasure. I wish to penetrate - “ Dean’s breath hissed as Castiel continued “ - your ‘butt’ Dean, just a tiny bit, yes, the dreaded ‘butt stuff’. One finger, no more, and not until your cock is in my throat. May I proceed?” Dean was smiling now, scared but laughing, and as Castiel finished speaking, he flushed and nodded.
“It’s okay. It’s a huge commission, it would have gotten you a laptop that can actually run the software you need.”
Castiel laughed out loud at that, shaking his head. He nodded towards Dean’s wastebasket. “There are kitchen trash bags in the cabinet in the breakroom.”
his smile so bright Dean’s chest hurt, and Dean slid out of their booth decisively, reaching for his wallet to pull out a wad of bills and drop them on the table.
Castiel’s breathless little groan as he wrapped his hand around his cock both thrilled and upset Dean, a sharp pang of dismay in the pit of his stomach as he heard himself beg, “No! It’s okay, uh, please... leave it,” and Castiel nodded and moved his fingers to roll and pinch his nipple instead, where Dean had left it damp, Dean frozen as he watched.
Dean demonstrated, gasping as his hand closed around the base of his cock, Castiel’s attention far more arousing than it had any right to be.
“Your brother is a really good salesman Sam. He’s helping our company succeed and that’s good for my job security…” Dean scoffed and shook his head while Sam rolled his eyes, a united front of completely unconned con men.
Time stuttered to a stop as Castiel lost his grip on it, Dean frozen, waiting at Castiel’s pleasure, Castiel staring down at him in awe. He distinctly remembered watched
“He’s pretty good at trash talk,” Sam allowed, “and so far he can back it up, which is the real kicker. Where’d you learn to play like that, Cas?”
“Anything yet on that search?” Dean asked, but Sam shook his head desultorily and blew out a breath.
“Let’s grab a six pack and an apple pie for dessert, and we can hang out in my motel room, if you want? It’s only got one bed, but it’s a king, and I’ve got HBO?”
Castiel didn’t pause this time, didn’t tease, firmly gripped Dean’s hip in one hand and cradled his balls in the other, one adept finger pressing firmly up into his perineum behind them. Castiel knelt between Dean’s thighs and gave him as much pleasure as he knew how, while Dean’s back arched off the carpet and he screamed and convulsed, spilling wave after wave of ecstasy into the heat of Castiel’s throat.
Dean laughed. “Ten minutes, Sam, fifteen tops. But you won’t have to wait for pie, we can just dig right in after we’ve eaten the mac and cheese.”
what to expect.  I figured worst case couple times a week, or hell even a month - that would’ve hurt but whatever, I was ready to, uh, deal with any... uh, overflow on my own time - I just wanted to
Castiel moved smoothly to press the thing Dean was indicating while Dean knelt, his nose an inch from the door, frowning at the inner workings of the machinery.
Dean abruptly let go as he got a little too close, leaning back on his elbows and trying to hide how heavily he was breathing, the sudden, burning question on his mind taking up every ounce of his concentration.
“Emily isn’t fragrant,” Castiel murmured, his voice shy, and closer than Dean expected. Dean looked up to see Castiel standing beside him, gently stroking a leaf of one of the paler pink flowers, but Castiel was watching him, his face timid. Dean wondered how many people had seen this garden - Cas seemed so shy he wondered if anyone ever had - and he took a deep breath and tried to be worthy of the honor.
The chairs emptied as employees eagerly got up to grab paper plates and pizza. Castiel wondered when was the last time the company had sprung for lunch. He had only been back to work a few months and the lavish Friday lunches he remembered fondly from before the downsizing were certainly a thing of the past.
“Yes, Miss Kittredge,” he said, hesitating, then he squared his shoulders and sat up straight, took a deep breath, and said the words out loud. “It was a very pleasant distraction indeed. I have entered into a new romantic relationship. For the first time in my life, I am
Castiel’s laugh was bright and pure, and Brandon smiled in pleased delight to have pulled it from him.
“Good. Start now.”  Castiel glanced at Dean’s cock meaningfully and Dean gaped at him, wrapped his hand around his cock, and managed half a stroke before he made a strangled noise and let go, his cock twitching dangerously.
Good god y'all spoiled me with love after I wailed at you. Thank youuuuuu I feel so much betterrrrrr. <3
Castiel didn’t let go, his entire body just went limp, panting, his cock still trapped between Dean’s thighs, and Dean laughed, breathless.
- and Dean was gasping, “Come In” and Castiel was opening the door, his eyes flaring in surprise to see Dean like this, wantonly on display, his hand wrapped around his own cock, Castiel’s hand flying to cover his mouth in a passable semblance of shock even as the weight of his attention affected Dean like a physical caress and Dean was howling, his back arching off the bed as he screamed, white hot pleasure so intense it stole his reason and left him lost, spinning out of control, tears streaming down his face as Castiel rushed to hold him, wrapping strong arms around him, heedless of the mess getting on his clothes, grounding him, pulling him slowly back to his body.
“I logged you out of your workstation and locked your office for you” Castiel offered, as he turned the key and the engine sputtered to life, doing a rousing impression of a bag of rocks in a washing machine.
Dean choked on his coffee and Castiel grinned wickedly, held up his hands. “Of course I kid, Dean, I would never raise a hand to anyone that hadn’t expressly begged me to.” Sam shook his head, grinning as Dean coughed, his ears turning a little pink, and Castiel continued. “But seriously Dean, would you like advil or tylenol? I found I needed some this morning and you imbibed a little more than I did…?”
Dean was so charmed his chest hurt and he whispered to the boys to keep their Dad good company until he could see him again, yawning more and more frequently as they just listened to each other breathe and the music of the fountain until Dean started to snore gently. Castiel whispered goodnight and hung up, trusting Sam to take care of Dean’s phone, which he could almost feel happening as Sam gently pried Dean’s phone from his hand, plugged it in, and pulled a blanket over his brother, still in his dress shirt and slacks.
tonight. He reeled them in with clueless white guy bravado, showing just enough chops to look like a proud weekend warrior. He lost and barely won and lost again, his drunken bravado increasing at a rate Castiel knew for a fact was not remotely commensurate with the rate at which he was ostentatiously drinking. He goaded the boys into double or nothing, nodding at the gorgeous - beefy -  bartender who stepped in to warn these boys that Dean here was not to be trifled with - he played pool here once a week for at
The sound that tore out of Dean’s throat raised every hair on Castiel’s vessel, and he paused, utterly delighted, letting the feeling wash over him, before lifting his eyes to admire Dean’s face, his pools of black meeting astonished rings of green, Dean’s pupils enormous, his whimper as Castiel lifted his mouth to demand Dean’s lips exactly the kind of thing Dean would have found mortifying moments ago but Dean entirely forgot to be embarrassed, incoherently begging to be kissed, his moans even more desperate when Castiel obliged, a keening cry starting low in his throat, and rising, as Castiel’s hands tightened around Dean’s waist and Castiel started to
The general hubbub had died down a bit when the quietest man in their group, a newcomer who never said anything more than the bare minimum to technically meet the requirements for participating, cleared his throat.
laugh, and another guy had sounded really bummed out about his ex and Dean had coaxed a better mood out of him before they’d even gotten started on an orgasm.
Dean pulled Baby off at the correct exit as Sam navigated, Sam’s laptop open in his lap to the directions on the mapquest page he’d saved offline before unplugging from the internet.
An hour later a rat was dead and in a dumpster, a sink was unclogged, a refrigerator was moved and then moved back after a rat nest was cleaned out from behind it, a burnt out light bulb replaced in a high fixture, and a diminutive gray-haired woman who spoke not a word of English was clasping Dean and Castiel’s hands goodbye. She pressed a greasy paper bag of something hot that smelled amazing from her tiny stovetop into Dean’s hands. He accepted the payment with a smile, bent down to kiss Mrs Rodrìguez’ cheeks and have his cheeks kissed in return, and they made their escape.
The timer chose that moment to go off, the noodles swollen now to very nearly the top of the water. Dean’s guess had been exactly correct, Castiel noted, any more and the pot would have overflowed.
Castiel’s hands were sliding down his back to hold his ass cheeks, and Dean admitted they felt really good, huge and searing hot, and now they were kind of kneading his ass, and that felt really good too, and the elephant in the room, so to speak, didn’t
gracias” to a chorus of enthusiastic encouragement each time, before taking their leave as the eating slowed and the kitchen table was wiped down for laptops and ethernet cables and extension cords.
that you want it.” Dean smiled encouragingly. “I trust you, Cas. You’ll figure out pretty quick if I’m not into something, and then you’ll do something different.”
Dean nodded, blowing out a huge breath. He shut his eyes and forced himself to relax, his forehead dropping its tension first, then his shoulders, then his back, the slow wave of deliberate calm traveling steadily down his body as Dean consciously forced himself past the fear, to nervously examine what his body was actually feeling, instead of what he was expecting to feel.
The car in question is a beautiful old-timer in peak condition, “a Chevrolet Impala,” Cas is informed by a staff member who seems specifically in charge of the garage and the cars within, “1967”. Despite having second to no knowledge on cars, Castiel can appreciate this one’s elegance which stands in strong contrast with the modern Porsche and Jaguar next to it.
“No, no!” Castiel nearly gasps, “it’s normal! I just- sometimes there’s guards, sometimes there’s not. You know how it is.”
!” Castiel spits. “Yeah, and Mr. Winchester with all his money and his ‘I will make you disappear if you don’t listen to me’ fuckery. Real scary. Why doesn’t he just kill me then, huh? Huh?!”
The bruises on her face from where Dean had hit her seem even more prominent in the low light but all of Castiel’s mustered up courage was quickly drowned out by the yelling reaching his bedroom. He was going to confront Mr. Winchester, even if it meant he’d get seriously injured -or worse- while doing so.
Would his authority work in a situation like this? Of course not, what was he thinking? It’s dead silent for only a split second this time before the raging argument continues with a “You don’t get to do this! You involve me, make me participate. And- and I can’t even go to the police, can I? You probably own them. You own
Hearing dress shoes click on designer marble is something he’ll never get used to. At least it means someone is coming back for him instead of leaving him to his own demises when he can’t possibly scrape together enough willpower to even get off of said floors. “Was I not clear?”
Castiel backs away as soon as the massive hound runs towards him at full speed with no intention of stopping. The beast barks and growls at him, occasionally shoves its incomparably strong muzzle into his abdomen which only sends him stumbling backwards even more. “Not afraid of dogs are you, Mr. Novak?” Dean watches from across the room but does nothing. If anything, the man looks amused, even more so when Cas stutters “no, no, just- allergic” in a slightly panicked voice.
“Take me home.” Dean snarls. “Take me home! Now!” That finally makes his bodyguards and driver scramble to their assigned positions, away from the scene they’d just witnessed.
He’s still panting as he picks up the phone, wiping tears from his eyes and pulling in his chest to avoid the soaking shirt sticking to his skin, it’s pure anguish.
It actually doesn't sound as bad as he initially thought. It sounds so much worse. But the one factor that really made this suck harder than Dean Winchester sucks dick for power, was Dean Winchester himself. Also, couldn’t he have gone for something more conventional like ‘personal assistant’ or ‘legal consultant’? Why did it have to be a marriage certificate?
If only he could explain but for now he’ll have to settle on lying through his rattling teeth as to why he showed up there, drenched in sweat, out of breath and probably looking two minutes away from death. If he isn’t already. Gabriel pulls him inside quickly.
Now, Teddy might not have even noticed him, too wrapped up in escaping whatever duties a dog could possibly have, but the lady Cas had currently only been introduced to via voice does. She stops dead in her tracks at the bottom of the stairs where Castiel is still glued into place.
For a lack of a better answer and for being completely dumbfounded, Mr. Winchester actually asks “what kind of drugs?”, perhaps hoping he understood it all wrong. But when the man before him begs ‘just get me anything, please!’, Dean knows he messed up. For real this time.
It’s dripping with sugariness when he shushes her. “No, no, no, sweetheart, it’s alright!” He even goes as far to slide one of his hands up and over her chest until it rests right below her jaw, tilting her head towards him a bit. “Mr. Novak is okay with this.” Dean keeps his eyes trained on Castiel, their Jade-like colour demanding to be looked at as he pushes his tongue back in the woman’s mouth and starts kissing her obscenely, dirty moans included, until they’re both gasping for air again.
The party broke up with laughter and arguments and demands for rematches, and Dean’s “little” brother Sam firmly assimilated into their midst as a kindred nerd spirit. Dean watched the animated conversations and the fond goodbyes and the glow on Castiel’s face with a soft smile on his lips, bending over to pull on his boots, and only when he straightened up again did he see that Anna had thrown her arms around Castiel and was squeezing him tight, her face pressed against his chest.
Dean crossed to the closet and Castiel just barely averted his eyes in time before Dean was naked again, this time pulling on boxer-briefs and worn jeans and a soft grey henley.  He grabbed a pair of socks and well-worn work boots, and plopped down on the couch to pull them on, waving at Castiel impatiently to sit. Castiel sat.
Cold beers were distributed, plates handed around, napalm was eagerly scooped onto them around Dean’s wincing that the dish was going to come apart, and three men valiantly tried not to burn their faces off, blowing on forkfuls and hissing as they scalded their tongues and quenched them with mouthfuls of beer. Soon enough the meal was edible and Dean and Castiel ate slowly, watching Sam eat as a spectator sport.
Sam leaned over to admire the one Castiel had called Emily, looking at the small copper label wired to one corner, but it was genus and species only, pressed into the copper in Castiel’s careful script. No ‘Emily’ to be seen anywhere. Sam turned to Castiel, watching with a soft smile and a twinkle in his eye, and hazarded a guess.
Dean’s hungry mind offered up an all-you-can-ask buffet of new questions to replace the amuse-bouche that was just served. He practically gaped at Castiel before catching himself and smoothing a neutral expression over his features.
“No.” he whispered. “Not since…” Dean faltered, searching Castiel’s face, but Castiel’s eyes held no judgement, none of the pity he was dreading. Dean found only kindness, concern, and he continued hoarsely, voice cracking, “not since the day my Dad passed and Sammy found me - “
Dean shoved his phone away again, gulping air and trying not to hyperventilate as he sweated through his second shirt of the day, his heart pounding in his ears. The rising adrenaline in his stomach twisted around his sandwich from an hour ago and he felt abruptly nauseous. He scrambled to reach for his wastebasket in time, but the wave passed as he got the basket between his knees, just a little bile in his mouth, no sandwich wasted. The second wave came just as he heard the quiet knock on his door, and he heaved his lunch into the metal basket as the door opened and Castiel let himself in, locked the door behind him, rushed to Dean’s side.
“You could pound it flat maybe,” Sam offered, grinning. He wandering over to see what Cas was doing. “Water’s boiling,” Sam observed, and Castiel looked up from his roux to glance into the small stock pot that was definitely at a rolling boil.
Dean’s joke fell flat, Castiel’s disappointment palpable as he shrugged and turned away towards his waiting clothes, tossing his towel over a chair, heedless of his nudity.
“It’s not a big deal, I just want…” He shrugged, unwilling to spoil the surprise. “Will you please wait in the bedroom once you’re dressed?”
He didn’t, settling into Baby’s upholstery with a soft sigh like Dean had done his entire life, and Dean nodded to himself in unconscious commiseration.
The next pool night Castiel did not work late. He arrived before the rest of his team for a change, to stake out his perch at
“When I panic. My palms sweat.” Castiel shrugged, half smiled. “It’s the weirdest thing, I’ve literally pissed myself in terror, but sweaty palms are still the thing I hate the most. Shall we?” He held his open hand towards the door, the question hanging in the air, and Dean couldn’t stop himself from staring at his hand, imagining it sweaty. Dean grinned guiltily as Castiel followed his glance and his eyes narrowed.
Castiel held the innocent straight face for several impressive seconds before he broke, his smile wide and bright. “Yes,” he admitted, looking
Time stood still. There was a complete absence of sound, like a vacuum had sucked all sound from the universe except for the rushing of blood in Castiel’s ears. There was nothing he could do now. This had been a safe space, but he had ruined it. He would have to find a new group and keep his mouth shut. Castiel’s tightly shut eyes stung with tears but he ignored them to breathe slowly; it wouldn’t be the first time he had wept in front of these men, but it would clearly be the last.
“Youthful vigor, Cas. You might remember it, it’s that thing you have to give up to get ‘years of practice with bourbon.’” Dean grinned, reaching into the carton for a jelly doughnut. To start.
push his aching cock into him - slow and easy until Dean was begging for more of course - and then not even a little bit slow
Castiel pulled in a long slow breath, relaxing his arms just enough to allow Dean to do the same, then exhaled steadily and audibly for several seconds, increasing the pressure of his arms to encourage Dean to follow his lead. Dean struggled to do as he was told, trembling violently for several minutes as his panting slowed to the occasional hiccup and he followed Castiel’s example, arms limp at his sides, Castiel’s vice grip on Dean’s chest the only thing keeping him from collapsing over the toilet again.
Castiel’s chest bloomed warmth at Dean’s reassurance, and Dean’s words wrapped around him like a blanket, soft and warm and…
Castiel spoke loftily as he stepped through the door Dean held open for him, his face straight but his eyes twinkling with mischief. “Not for lack of trying, Dean, I assure you.”
“You will still get to fuck my throat, Dean. You may also come right now, as a reward for pleasing me. Will you please do that for me?”
“Will… Will Castiel mind?” Dean finally asked, his face torn. Frank obviously cared about Cas, so he wouldn’t offer a Devil’s bargain, would he?
Dean cleared his throat pointedly, and Castiel instantly turned to meet his eyes, reaching for the last of his current beer, long fingers wrapping around the bottle in a way that Dean inexplicably had to tear his eyes away from watching.
“I am going to go wash my hands and brew a fresh pot of coffee, Dean. While I am gone, I want you to masturbate, but you must not give yourself an orgasm. Stop before you come, then start again when the urgency has passed. I am going to come back up here when I’m done starting the pot of coffee and doing a few things in the kitchen. I’m going to walk up the stairs and down the hallway and I am going to knock on this door, and you are going to say ‘Come in,’ and when I open this door, I expect to see you coming, do you understand?
“He flirted with Alex,” Sam countered, the discussion over as far as he was concerned. He turned his eyes back to his laptop.
compared to the inferno of desire he could feel welling up from wherever it lived inside him, so powerful he fought it back, struggling to keep it from stealing his reason. He laced a hand through Dean’s hair, gripping it between his fingers tightly enough to pull Dean’s head back so he could lean forward to bite his neck down low where a collar would hide, hard enough for Dean to cry out before he switched to licking and sucking, his other hand working Dean’s belt undone as his mouth found Dean’s and he growled and licked and sucked his way inside. Dean whimpered, melting under the onslaught, his breath coming hard and fast.
Dean smiled soothingly across the kitchen at his new friend. “That’s Okay Cas, I’ve never used one before anyway. We always used an empty forty ouncer, I just asked cuz you’re classy and shit.” Castiel snorted, staring down at the roux he was currently whisking without a whisk and making sure he was stirring all parts of the pan. “I don’t suppose you drink forties?” Dean asked hopefully, and Castiel snorted again, looking up at Dean this time.
Dean couldn’t feel guiltier, his face agonized. All that time he’d selfishly let Cas give him orgasm after orgasm… well,
Castiel was exploring, bouncing on the bed experimentally, his face filled with such pleasure Dean didn’t dare ask what he’d been sleeping on lately.  He’d automatically picked Sam’s side, which made Dean feel weird that Cas knew that much about him, but he didn’t say anything, popping the cap off one of the twist-offs and draining half of it in several long gulps, pulling it away from his lips to burp with great satisfaction, realizing belatedly that Castiel was watching him now, a soft smile playing over his lips.
and that felt nice, although he felt a little confused as to why, after all this time he’d have gone there.
“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.”  Castiel did not in any way indicate that this was exactly what he had asked for in the first place, but Dean was quietly astonished all the same to watch Castiel’s exact request fall from Zachariah’s lips as his own idea.
Frank laughed at Dean’s ignorance, but kindly. “Castiel hasn’t taught you a thing, has he?” he grinned as Dean looked crestfallen.
“It WILL,” Dean mumbled, and Sam and Castiel both grinned at him as Castiel contradicted him firmly.
“Yeah, I know, and logistically it was impossible, I get it, but when you shoved me against the car, I’ve never wanted anything more.” Dean shuddered, the sense memory of Castiel’s breath against his neck intoxicating, and Castiel glanced at him and then back at the road, his lips slowly curving into a smile.
, all pretense at alcohol-induced hand tremors or slurring magically gone, along with the frat boys’ chances of seeing their money again. Castiel was entranced, and he wasn’t the only one. His entire table and half the patrons in the bar watched Dean with their mouths practically hanging open as he expertly lined up shot after shot, calling them out one by one in his rich baritone and following through flawlessly.
It was Dean’s turn to choke, far worse than Castiel had, if the redness in his face was any indication when he was done coughing and he attempted to look Castiel in the eye. Castiel held his gaze calmly while the red in Dean’s face traveled to the tips of his ears and he stared at Castiel, speechless, until he couldn’t hold the eye contact and looked away again, his face crimson. A moment passed, and then another, with Dean refusing to meet Castiel’s eyes, chewing his bottom lip, his shoulders shaking a little, until Castiel began to worry he’d actually upset Dean, and his face fell. “I’m just teasing, Dean,” he apologized quietly. Dean looked at him then, lifting his head to meet Castiel’s eyes at last, and there was such mischief on his face, Castiel realized he wasn’t upset at all. If anything, he was delighted.
Dean bore down on Castiel’s invading finger, nerves he’d never even known could feel so good twitching and pulsing around Castiel’s finger and deep in his gut, the tension of his imminent orgasm spiraling higher than he’d ever felt it climb before. Dean’s eyes fluttered closed and his hips arched up, pressing harder and harder into Castiel’s face, his entire body convulsing as Castiel’s burning heat and rhythmic friction pulled him over that edge and his orgasm
Castiel’s eyes stung freshly now as he remembered how he’d felt, how he’d fought to turn around in Dean’s embrace, holding his face in both hands, kissing Dean’s beautiful mouth, and when his body responded with arousal, groaning and grinding against him in quiet desperation; Dean responding with soft kisses and then nothing soft at all, silent like teenagers with parents nearby, collapsing when they were spent to go back to holding each other just as they had started.
“Oh, right,” Dean said, “It was pretty much a done deal after that. The cops were satisfied and left. Big Man waited until they were gone, listened to José and Felipe’s explanation. Alex made a couple quick phone calls in Spanish, couldn’t catch it but it did not sound good. Big Man sent José and Felipe home.  Shook our hands, thanked us for helping his boys, asked us what con we were in town to run.“
By the third time going through the demo on his laptop under Castiel’s watchful eye Dean wanted to pull his hair out.
Sam and Manuel were facing each other down, Sam pouring sweat into his sleeveless tee, his hair soaking wet and dripping down his forehead. Sam was dribbling slowly in place, intent on finding a way past the wall of glistening, tattooed muscles and bright white grimace blocking his way. Sam and Manuel were several orders of magnitude larger than the next tallest person on the court, who happened to be Dean, apparently playing for team Skins. Dean’s freckled back rippled and shone with sweat as he grinned fiercely and guarded Diego from interfering with Big Man. Sam and Dean were conspicuously the only white men in the horseshoe, adrift in a sea of rippling brown muscles, half the men shirtless and dripping, the other half sweating into their tank tops and muscle tees. Castiel had eyes only for Dean, enchanted by the grace with which Dean moved over the court.
“Before you came on board, sir, we sent a software team member along to every sales meeting. When I was initially developing the platform I personally made it a point to meet with every new client for the first year to listen to their concerns and to design the platform with an eye towards future scaling and feature creep. We only stopped the practice when we got short-staffed as the bubble burst, sir.”
to think about.”  Castiel was still smiling, Dean could hear it, but his voice carried a note of shy uncertainty now, enough apology in his tone that Dean’s chest ached to hear it. “I
I will preface the next stretch only with the caveat that I am not in charge of what happens when I put these two in a room. I try to be, I had a nice long argument with Cas - don't you want to be easily categorized? Don't you know you won't tag well like this? - but he wants what he wants. I wrote an entire agonized essay to my poor Beta about how we set patterns early and maybe some things don't reset and she said, approximately, "Calm down, just let me take a look... GOOD GOD GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS CAITLIN."
"He quoted something I forget after,  that kind of sounded like he might be starting to feel better..." Sam looked worried as hell but Dean's face lit up a little.
” Dean’s voice was strained; Castiel could hear the sound of the car door slamming and feet on stairs. Castiel knew
myself to you, Cas.”  He gave up on attempting to spoon lettuce and picked up the serving dish to scoop half of it onto his plate, set it down and meet Castiel’s eyes again.
Castiel smirked against Dean’s neck. “You’re right. I wasn’t thinking that far ahead, I thought you might need more rest - “
The arms around him immediately relaxed their hold, caught him as he nearly pitched into the toilet, waited a beat as he got his bearings, and then released him for good. The wall of heat retreated, and Dean realized he was absolutely drenched in acrid flop sweat, and, now, freezing.
Dean fought to keep his fingers from shaking as they closed over Castiel’s hands, taking over tying his tie in reverse slow motion, unlooping and tugging, Castiel’s face coming forward instead of the tie slipping free a surprise, their foreheads touching another surprise, Castiel’s eyes flaring and his breath hitching the best surprise of all.
Warnings: Dream sequence includes sharp teeth and blood imagery. Real life includes some biting but never to blood.
Castiel’s laughter was no less magical than the first time he’d heard it, and Dean held his breath to savor every musical note until it was over.
“I do have a theory,” Anna nodded, “but I am gathering more data points for my hypothesis.” Castiel knew that look, she would say no more about it until she was ready. He didn’t even try to press her, just sighed and nodded. “Okay. Thank you.”
tion, Dean,” Castiel observed wryly, his voice deep and sonorous and giving a little extra emphasis each time his knuckles landed, “Your lubricant is com
Castiel’s chest hurt.  He had pored over every possibility he could imagine for what Dean might be up to, but this was off the map. The dissonance he’d been trying to decipher the whole time  - how Dean could seem to genuinely care about people yet throw so many false notes at work - rearranged itself in his mind and the reality was so much greater than the sum of the parts. Dean
“I know that humans feel terribly guilty about it, and waste a great deal of time praying for forgiveness afterwards. I know that - just like human sexual orientation - god has never cared about that
Dean’s face broke into delighted laughter just as Sam came out of the bathroom, towel wrapped around his waist, to look at the two of them and demand, “What’s so funny?”
“It’s okay,” Dean lied, putting the sum total of his entire career of professional lying to shame with the pure conviction he poured into the biggest whopper he’d ever told in his life.
These 3 chapters need to come out together, and then you miiight get a couple slightly thinner weeks. Reading is fast. Writing is slow. The agony of that ratio haunts me. ENJOY. :-D
simultaneously the most intimate and hottest sensation he’d ever felt in his life, his eyes rolling back in his head as he felt Castiel’s demand he follow and he obeyed instantly, the pleasure of obeying nearly rivaling the pleasure Castiel was coaxing from his body right now, so overwhelming that everything was kind of going white around the edges -
Castiel waited, only his hand in motion, sliding up Dean’s back and reaching over his shoulder to cradle Dean’s face, and Dean shuddered, lifting his panicked gaze to meet Castiel’s eyes, gentler than Dean expected, gray thunderclouds over silver seas.
It was a matter of a few minutes for Castiel to make good on his word, arriving with their coats and his laptop case slung over his arm just as Dean finished patting his face dry over the sink with paper towels, the cold water splash helping his frame of mind if not his body temperature.
On Tuesday, Castiel didn’t even check Dean’s office at lunch time. Instead, he went to lunch with Anna, to sit in her car on the street. He’d shaken his head when she tried to talk to him Monday, missed her attempt to pull him to lunch while he was sniffing around Dean’s office, rushed off to counseling, but she was literally vibrating every time she caught his eye and he didn’t actually want her to explode. He owed her an explanation, and his gratitude as well.
Dean’s urgent tone pulled Castiel out of his self-reflection and he scrambled to open the correct cabinet of his carefully organized garage workbench set, pulling a rag out of an unopened package. He crouched down readily to hand it under the car to Dean, who peered at it by flashlight and then - to Castiel’s horror - used it to wipe a couple drops of oil off his
Dean nodded, frowning ever-so-slightly as he collected his toolbox, stepped out of Castiel’s garage and unlocked Baby’s trunk to stow it. He pulled her trunk shut again with a satisfying clunk, chewing his bottom lip and avoiding eye contact as he contemplated.
Dean pulled his suit coat on gratefully and buttoned it over his disheveled dress shirt. There was nothing he could do about his soggy knees, but Castiel - first checking up and down the hall with the men’s room door barely cracked open - stepped out and motioned to him to follow and Dean fell in lockstep behind him without hesitation.
than usual he had to pause, almost whimpering, still staring at Castiel’s face, but his eyes falling, accidentally, to his mouth.
Dean bucked and moaned and tried desperately to grind up for friction, but he was held fast, and Castiel waited until the little twitches in Dean’s cock had stilled and he stopped fighting before breaching him just a tiny bit with his index finger, swallowing at the same time to give Dean plenty of sensation to process. Dean tensed and moaned, and Castiel pulled his finger back, slid his mouth slooowly off Dean’s cock, took a breath, and swallowed him back down while gently pushing his finger back in, a little further this time.
Dean’s eyes immediately sought Castiel’s, his brow furrowed, but Castiel was painstakingly stirring, his attention completely absorbed in watching the last of the cheese melt into the roux. Dean studied the side of Castiel’s face, observed the hint of a crease at the corner of his eye, watched the corner of his lip quirk just the tiniest bit then return to the straight line it was currently forming, and Dean’s eyes narrowed.
It was too late of course, Castiel already had Dean’s shirt pulled on over his arms and shoulders, was already struggling with the buttons, his tipsy fingers fumbling and clumsy, and he looked up at Dean after the third try, his face vaguely hopeful as he held out his wrists plaintively for help.
Dean paused at Castiel’s navel, the view impressively different now, and he lifted his eyes to Castiel’s face with a wry smile on his lips, expecting to find embarrassment, and finding instead only irritation.
“Scientifically speaking, we’re just walking bags of chemicals on legs. I see no shame in adjusting the mix when my body decides to misfire the wrong synapses and then manufacture a lifetime’s worth of adrenaline in one night. It’s hardly weakness to treat an injury, correct? When your arm was torn up and the medic put a cast on it, the guys in your unit drew phalluses on it and laughed, but no one called you a name, right?”
Castiel’s tone was eager, not embarrassed at all, and Dean decided not to tell him about cardinal rule number two, watching instead as Castiel wrapped his hand around his own cock and put his new skills to the test, slowly sliding up and down, Dean’s skin rippling with chills as Castiel groaned in surprised pleasure and redoubled his efforts, hiding neither his rapid breathing, nor his delicious little moans and groans and gasps, his face alternating between surprised delight and raw pleasure in a way that made Dean’s entire body hum with desperate arousal, tension simmering under his skin.
Dean could hear Castiel banging around in the kitchen, doing dishes maybe? But he wasn’t doing as Castiel had instructed and that felt bad, made his stomach twist in unpleasant ways, so he tried again, wrapping his hand around his cock slowly and -
“I waited for you, Dean, and I’m sorry to wake you, but I didn’t go for a run so I would be home when you woke up, and I fear I cannot wait any longer.”
he filed away, scrubbing at the wine bottle label under the stream of running water and coming to the realization it would have to be soaked off.
“It’s not too late, Dean. Whenever you get here, dinner will be waiting.” Castiel smiled to hear Dean smile, and a silence stretched between them as they listened to each other breathe.
The flush in his face felt hot, the moment awkward as hell, and Dean didn’t dare look up as Castiel lithely stepped out of bed to dress himself again, somehow fresh and sweatless and smelling of nothing at all, anymore.
“All set,” he promised. “Dunno if Diego wants his hose back, but I’ll take it back to him just in case, Okay?”
Both men jumped as Anna approached, Castiel’s tan coat over her shoulder and his suit jacket over her arm. She shoved both peremptorily into Castiel’s arms, shaking her head up at the two of them. “You idiots cannot come here this hungry for each other, people will notice. I ran interference to the best of my ability but
Several flights down Castiel pushed through another door and they were in the dim gray concrete of the company parking garage. He waved Dean to the passenger side of a true abomination of a vintage Lincoln Continental, shrugging noncommittally at Dean’s raised eyebrows.
a big deal. Castiel knew that even their best salespeople had been lucky to sign one new client in a month. San Francisco area restaurants had been closing left and right in the wake of the dot com bubble bursting and keeping their existing clients on board had taken most of their efforts for some time now. There just weren't as many hungry people looking to book a restaurant table as there had been two years ago and restaurants were harder to convince they needed the service. Six new clients to add to their database was going to mean a hell of a lot of work for his team but also maybe a turnaround for their slump. Maybe he’d get paid in actual dollars again someday.
“Only fair,” he added, giving Castiel a good-humored but still quite lecherous glance that swept up and down his body in slow-motion. Dean bristled but Castiel laughed, he liked Alex very much already, and
Next week you get 10k of Birthday Party, and then there's this glorious slow dance of discovery and testing waters and then a huge chunk you will get all at once of risk and misunderstanding and pain and rediscovery. Thank you for suffering though the /waiting/ with me. <3 <3 <3
Castiel pulled into his driveway with his heart aching and his cock aching in a completely different way. He parked his Old Lady, shut the garage door, and took the stairs two at a time, unlocked his door with unsteady hands so he could race upstairs, his first orgasm already cresting by the time he had his trousers down and his fingers wrapped around his cock. He groaned and added lubricant, kept stroking himself without pause, his second orgasm rapidly following the first, and he spent that refractory period languidly stroking himself thinking about Dean until he could take another, and another.
“Oh good. I thought you’d make me lie on the couch, since I made you uncomfortable, and I want to be comfortable while I wait. This body is sore, in the hips. From the floor.”
As Dean descended the stairs he saw that Castiel was waiting for him at the foot of the stairs and hadn’t gotten all the way to the kitchen yet, that was odd, and
We earn a number of the warning tags starting here, particularly glimpses into how Dean has been 'getting by', so brace yourselves, Best Beloveds. <3 :-D
Ash was all smiles, clapping Dean on the back and hollering “REMATCH, Dean! You were holding out on me! I took it EASY on you!!!” Dean assured him next time he’d go all in, promise. Dean smiled and glad-handed and let the small talk wash over him, but when it died down he finally turned to the face whose steady gaze had not left him once all night, and his smile was soft and shy. “Better?” he asked quietly.
Castiel came in seconds this time, collapsing onto his back so close to Dean their shoulders were touching, and Dean guiltily savored the touch, still panting, reaching for a pillow for himself so he could interlock his fingers behind his head, savoring this feeling and ignoring the real world threatening to encroach on this impossible moment.
“He made a stink about not wanting to deal with bats, and I called him the giant pussy that he is, and he told me to go fuck myself, and then neither of us felt like hunting together this weekend. I lost the rocks-paper-scissors, so here we are. Thanks for coming out to meet us and thanks for letting Sam take your car back -”
Dean woke with a start as Castiel slipped into bed beside him, warm and naked and, now, half hard as he slotted his body behind Dean and wrapped his arms around him, one around his chest, one caressing a thigh, leaned his head over Dean’s shoulder to whisper into his ear.
Dean couldn’t breathe, his chest rapidly heaving as he hyperventilated, staring up at the sheer menace on Castiel’s face, his body rippling with chills everywhere Castiel’s eyes happened to land.
, Cas. So I wouldn’t have to look at - “ Dean’s voice hitched and he squeezed Castiel tighter for a moment, gulping air, Castiel’s hands coming up to hold Dean’s hands over his chest.
Dean sobbed into Castiel’s shoulder as Castiel held him, cradling him in his arms, petting his hair, pressing soft lips to his face and showering him with whispered praise “
They got up, stopping by the men’s room to throw away their waste and wash up and smooth their hair. Castiel’s shirt was wrinkled and his suit jacket was unwearable, but Dean’s hair and clothes looked great, only his dreamy stare and complete absence of cognitive processes a giveaway for what they’d just been up to. He stood waiting for Castiel to finish rinsing his face and mouth and smoothing his hair and then just kept standing, staring blankly as Castiel headed for the door, turned to call him.
Dean looked crestfallen. “I mean, yes, I know I’m running a con Cas, but it wasn’t like that. I was just trying to be friendly.”
Castiel’s slick hand reaching down to cradle Dean’s balls, gently caressing, tickling back behind them, Dean’s tension rising suddenly, almost violently, and he tried to tap out with a warning cry, but Castiel only doubled down on his efforts, swallowing and swallowing as Dean bucked and twitched and
“In any case, I'm clearly incapable of communicating with other humans in that regard - as in so many others, I s'pose - but our waitress seems to like you, 'n if you need to leave me here to have intercourse with her I certainly unnerstan'."
him, sliding his mouth down over Dean’s cock in one smooth motion until Dean’s entire cock was buried in Castiel’s throat, much further than Castiel had fucked Dean only minutes before, Castiel’s nose buried in the dark hair curling over his pubic bone. Castiel pushed his finger into Dean’s body slowly, inexorably, curving back until he found the bundle of nerves he was looking for, and then he pressed against it in slow pulses while he fucked Dean’s cock with his throat.
The water started and Castiel did sit, pulling out the other kitchen chair and mulling over the mystery of Dean Winchester as he idly picked at the label on his beer bottle. Why did he live here? Why was he accepted here, safety that extended to a strange man he brought home, apparently. Most intriguing of all for Castiel’s puzzle-solving mind, who slept in that second bed?
"That's just cardio. I'll do some pushups later or something. Get out of here, wouldja?" Sam grinned and pulled on his headphones for emphasis, so Dean grabbed his jacket and the paper with the addresses and made his way out to Baby to check his map for the best way to hit all three.
Castiel leaned back to stare down at Dean’s face, his eyes pools of black as he pushed his finger forward, Dean’s breath rasping and shuddering as Castiel bottomed out at his knuckles and held it there, watching him.
“I masturbated until I chafed myself and my arm had cramps, imagining what else I would like to do to you.”
Castiel turned off the lights and raked the stones by the light of the real stars and the moon, brushed his teeth, and collapsed into bed with the twinkle of fairy lights and the sound of Dean's soft snoring replaying over and over in his mind. He could almost feel Dean's arms around him, and when sleep took him, it was with his hands crossed over his chest, cradling the empty space where Dean's hands belonged.
Castiel suffered Dean with the patience of more than one Saint he had personally had the honor of meeting over the years, methodically disrobing, stepping into the one-person shower beside Dean to perfunctorily shampoo and rinse his hair, and making a show of examining Dean.
Castiel struggled underneath him, and Dean reluctantly shifted his weight to release Cas from the cage of his arms, instead of giving in to the sudden urge to wrap his arms around him and kiss him again.
Sam picked up the thread after a beat. “Manuel listened to Dean spill our life story and looked at him reaaally carefully, then he looked at me - I’ve never felt more naked in my life Cas, not even when I was actually naked - and I guess he decided to let us live.”
“I have many shirts exactly like this one Dean,” Castiel rejoined in an affronted tone. “I happen to LIKE this shirt - “
There was a somewhat shocked silence, followed by a low whistle and then laughter and enthusiastic cheering as the ice broke. Dean Winchester surveyed the room with an easy grin, modestly waving his hand for the applause to simmer down, but basking in the approval all the same.
Today the glances felt different. Less covert, more eager maybe, and instead of preening a little to pay his share forward, his eyes snapped open to try to figure out what the hell was going on. A dozen men surreptitiously glanced away, except for one of the guys he’d seen around the longest. John? Joe? Jason? Something with a J, he couldn’t remember - they’d never spoken beyond a courteous greeting -  but maybe Jason’s eyes swept back up to his face, grinned at him, and indicated Castiel’s torso with raised eyebrows and a pointed glance; grinned even wider as Castiel’s glance followed where he’d been looking.
It made Castiel seriously consider terminating the contract. How bad could getting tortured really be? Was having his dead body dumped in a ditch really
It sounds miles away when there’s someone ringing his doorbell. To Castiel, it might as well be with how sore his entire body is. Every shift against the covers hurts as it pulls on his aching muscles and torn skin so even thinking about walking all the way to the front of his house makes him tense up.
happening, by clear-cut, distinct rejection currently staring him down. Castiel doesn’t know what hurts more; how Mr. Winchester instantly starts laughing at him in a sadistically amused and ominous kind of way or the disregard that follows after making it painfully clear this was nothing but a joke to the CEO, a game.
The pathetic excuse of a response doesn’t even come close to what he so desperately wanted to say but it will have to do. Explaining how he can feel the fever consuming him, how dull yet intense pain continues to spread through his exhausted body, how nauseousness threatens to take over… Even how frightened and emotionally hurt he feels are seeking an escape, despite who his opponent is right now.
’ Once Cas manages to meditate through rising heaps of nauseousness at seeing the formality and therefore lack of personal touches, his first thought goes to wondering how many of these pre-made cards Mr. Winchester has sent out over the years.
It was all downhill from there for Mary. Though still being relatively young, the loss of her husband slowed her down, it made her ill, turning her into a ghost long before she became one and Dean knew it somehow was his fault, denying it made no difference.
Isn’t it funny, how one’s mind -even in the face of disaster- every so often decides to focus on that one, insignificant thing amongst the misery surrounding it, and transforms it into some twisted lifeline to hold onto?
. Not love perhaps, not yet, but feelings at least. Were it how he tries to keep Teddy calm around Cas now, or how he showed such concern after Cas nearly drank alcohol and then made sure to lock up any liquor around the house, or how he’d kissed him, gently, as if he cared about him.
“I’ve got a job for you,” comes the lowly growled addition a few seconds later, “I’ll contact you once I know more but right now I have no further use of you.” Castiel would be confused, he feels like he should have a million questions right now but all he feels is throbbing pain throughout his body, the black spots dancing in front of his eyes aren’t helping either.
The blood will be washed away by falling rain, marks where bodies collided with the earth erased as breezes of wind sweep it all way in one motion of innocence by natural force. Words spoken, however, will forever linger there, their legacy carried on by the permanent memories now made.
As soon as the doors close behind them, Mr. Winchester breaks down in the much-anticipated but therefor not less frightening tirade. He starts yelling about how stupid it was of Cas to go out with a fever, how angry he is that his direct orders were ignored, how disappointed he is.
Of course she wouldn’t be able to reach him, the first and only time he’d called her was today, on a payphone no less, and then he hung up on her after basically avoiding her questions about the people he was potentially involved with.
Sensing the awkwardness in just sitting there as one of them eats, Dean takes off again, though this time he does so more casually, exclaiming he still has to ‘clean up the kitchen.’ He’s gone for a good few minutes, leaving Castiel plenty of time to wind down a bit. Man, is he tired.
“Oh, come on. You’re not getting all shy on me now are you, darling? I just wanted to check in on you. Seems like I made the right call.”
Something flashes across Mr. Winchester’s face, Castiel notices, a split moment of hurt but it’s enough to prove there’s at least
The dark chuckle flowing into the room makes both Castiel and the bodyguard freeze instantly. “Oh, the boss is already here” Dean all but growls. And just like that, shit went from harmless hysterics to instant dangerous debacle in the blink of an eye.
When he enters the office, he’s surprised to see Mr. Winchester isn’t there yet, though secretly, he’d half expected the man to be late or not show up at all after their late night activities anyway. Might as well get the usual cup of coffee then because he was
“I’d watch your back, Winchester” Mick had said before spitting in his face, “there’s a war coming.”
“Mr. Davies,” Dean grits out, his smile only for the cameras, “congrats on the shittiest part of town.”
“I know!” He glances around nervously before turning back towards his brother and continuing in an equally hushed tone. “Money’s not the reason, Gabe. I was more than happy at Wesson.”
That night, Dean goes to bed perfectly content after a quick session of jacking off, his power over the blue eyed man entrancingly intoxicating.
Gabriel sighs, realizing how wrong he’s been in flipping out like that, he even chuckles softly and it instantly makes Castiel relax. He, too, coming down from his high. “Can you forgive me, Cas? I was worried, is all.”
“Don’t sweat it. Just on edge” Cas manages to slur the half apology before completely sinking against the back of the couch. “Party sucks, huh?”
It takes him nearly two hours before he can sneak away to go check out the buffet. He was absolutely starving. But right as he’s about to put some bread in his mouth, a soft voice calls out to him. Castiel nearly drops his food when he turns around. “Hannah! Wow, I-“
“You fucker!” He screams at the phone, then sobs, immediately crumbling into a shattered mess because the one pillar that’d kept him standing had mercilessly been destroyed with a single blow directly to its weakest point.
Hearing Dean Winchester apologize has got to be the strangest thing he’s ever heard, it even almost sounded genuine. It couldn’t be though. How could a man who just took two lives in the span of twenty-four hours be sorry about something as unimportant as using a nickname when asked not to?
“Don’t-“ is his immediate, weak prayer. Cassie was a sweet and innocent child, before the drugs, before the hurt and the lies and the violence. It’s not who he is anymore. “Please.”
. In case it wasn’t clear, that means you’ll not only be closely observed by me, but also by my hoard of dedicated fans, and of course; by the general people of America. One slip up, one step out of line, and you’re dead meat, you disappear without a trace. Do you understand?” Castiel has to swallow thickly as he not only hears but also feels the gun pressed to his lower back cocking. “Yes, sir.”
The thoughts have him huff out a bitter chuckle, warm steam curling up against his cheeks when his soft breath hits the scalding cup of tea pressed against his lips. He gets lost in blowing cool air over the water, it being way too hot for consumption yet, when something loud startles him out of the blue.
Cas nearly panics at that. Was he asked out of habit, some kind of patient protocol, or was it a genuine offer coming from an honest, concerned member of the public? Fuck if he knows. Much as with Paula, he wonders if he can even trust anyone employed by husband dear.
It doesn’t take Cas a moment of hesitation today, he simply lays back down, listening to the low rumble of Dean’s voice when the man speaks up again.
What’s even more unsettling beside the homicidal vibe in the closed off space is how Mr. Winchester hasn’t said a single word about Castiel’s behaviour. Not about the dismissal at early hours, not about the vulgar language, not even about the liquid crime.
Castiel is in absolute agony for the fifteen minutes that follow. It’s not half as bad as when he had the wounds pinned down against a mattress while a stranger fucked into him but it’s no walk in the park either. Between gloved fingers inspecting the healing blisters, swabs drenched in disinfectant and new wound dressings being applied, Cas has to grit his teeth near the point of breaking them.
But there’s more to it; plans that are only within Dean’s knowledge and secretive in the strictest of ways. Which is exactly why Cas’ role will be of such importance.
. Before any of the cruel shit that went down between living a relatively mundane life and literally being a criminal’s throw-away accessory. A bruised and battered throw-away accessory. How was he supposed to go out in public like this? What if someone noticed?
“Just- just do it.” Cas exhales softly, closing his eyes and leaning against the wall a bit more when he feels how the new rush of anxiety makes already shaking legs edging closer to total failure. This isn’t a battle he can win.
He goes with “Muay Thai, combat sport”, and leaves out the part where he can still feel Mr. Winchester’s boots from where they made contact with his ribs. Purple strokes might have turned into soft yellow clouds, the memories still remain a dark red.
“Shut up!” Dean yells, this time yanking Castiel’s arm like one would do with a disobedient child. “I wasn’t done talking. I never would have traded you off to Mr. Ketch if I’d known you were sick.”
“You won, sweetheart,” Mary had said to him so gently. Though, the sadness when she continued? That will haunt him forever. “You won, sweetheart,
He, unfortunately, is well aware of how every little movement brings forth a range of pain that still holds power over his body. It concentrates itself around his chest and abdomen, his feet, and… his privates. Memories of painful penetration and violent harassment make him stop dead in his tracks.
“Everything in order, Mr. Winchester?” the waiter asks, then politely nods at Cas. “Sir.” After confirming that, yes, everything was ‘divine’ their plates and glasses are carefully being stacked and ready to be taken away when the waiter speaks up again, “Putting the bill on your tap, sir?” ,already slightly taking a step back because he probably gets the same answer every time.
, but what game is it that you’re playing here? I get it, you’re the boss, you hold all the power and you’ll ruin my life if I don’t obey. I know, but there’s no need for all this further degradation around it. Just give me whatever document I have to sign, whatever court date you’ve laid out for me, I don’t care, just get it over with!”
But Castiel never was the kind of person to give in to temptation -other than the drugs all these years ago- though this right here might be the best offer he’s ever had to turn down. The little nudge coming from someone he trusts making it that much harder to resist.
Not only tonight’s celebration, piled up efforts from previous months, too. Everything from the secrecy to the illegalities, and from the fights to the feelings. “I’m happy for you, Cassie, really, I am.”
They don’t care about the screams cutting through midnights, or about sweat-soaked sheets being picked up by staff every day. They don’t even bat an eye at the tears, nor the fights. Castiel is a liability and that’s that. Nothing more than a nuisance to be dealt with.
. I could have Paula make smoked salmon, we’ve got sirloin steaks, oh, she makes a mean truffle risotto or-“
For some reason, the thought of his brother being here, tonight, is such a relief to Castiel that his muscles eventually relax enough to make the blowjob he’s giving less strenuous and let him suck Dean’s cock more easily. He’s feeling quite hot himself, too.
Dean remains quiet for a moment after seeing Cas shake his head but then steps closer again, still no words yet his eyes are filled with emotions. And then comes the blow. Literally.
It’s a soft question, careful, as he removes himself from the table and approaches her while gently pushing past the barrier she tries to put between him and whatever truth she’s hiding. “It’s okay, you can tell me.”
Before Cas is even fully seated on the couch, body still swaying from the amount of alcohol rushing through it, there’s a pair of hands settling on his hips and a tongue pushing into his mouth. “Woah!” He shouts, pushing the guy away from him, “I’m not a faggot.”
There’s about a dozen of them as far as he’s aware, half of them clad in expensive suits accentuated by golden watches and extensive jewellery glistening in stray moonlight. The other half are attack dog looking killers, one for every menacing mobster so it seems.
Luckily for Cas, his brother is too busy taking care of him to even notice the dubious circumstances surrounding him and how badly the infection actually gripping him is. Gabriel even lets it slide when Castiel is unable to answer simple questions like why he ran all the way instead of taking the car. Again, he doesn’t know anymore.
“he said it was going to be alright but he’s not even here, is he? That fucking lying piece of shit!”
Or at least, that was the game Castiel thought he could play because a whole, generous ten minutes later, his phone rings again, this time dragging him up and into a fully awake state though none the less pissed off. “What?” he snaps, breathing hard as he waits for the response. “Not a morning person are we, Mr. Novak?” Even in words rumbled in a deep voice, Castiel could hear exactly what a tit-playing, cock-sucking, ass-licking twat this man exactly was. It almost makes him laugh.
When he finally calms down enough he’s quite surprised to realize none of the two men in front of him had tried to stop him, nor had they interrupted him. One was too shocked and the other, the other was just looking at him with a raised eyebrow and a pissed, though also slightly impressed look.
Mr. Winchester takes a step back after his outburst in order to put some space between them, Cas reckons. After all, they’re still in a quiet neighborhood with curious onlookers just one door away and strangling your fake husband in public probably isn’t very good for your image.
There’s sunken in structures, tired eyes, and fidgeting fingers. Arms are being scratched, legs are bouncing. It makes his own body twitch. But there’s also some hopeful gazes looking at him, encouraging him in a silent matter that tell him he’s not alone, so he speaks up.
, we’ll be out of here before the guy even arrives! So tell me, honestly, what’s going on between you two? Is he forcing you to do things you don’t want?”
Before his brains can catch up to him, Castiel starts yelling his defence. It’s not the punch that hurt most but the negligence behind such a request and he’s not having it. The entire contract, the deal, all of it, was a way for him to avoid being taken to court but it was meant to be him just acting as a P.A. or something, not to be treated like a worthless piece of nothing.
It’s a question he’s asked himself at least half a dozen times since being brought to the mansion. One he’s stashed at the back of his head because he doesn’t need to think far to know the answer. Even without any verbal agreements, he knows there’s an unspoken rule keeping him on Mr. Winchester’s property at all times. No way was Dean going to agree to dinner with Gabriel.
Before Castiel can even realize his mistake, taking back what he’d just said to save his own ass, his boss’s rough hands shove him against the elevator’s wall just a tad bit harder than strictly necessary which only adds to the severity of the threat that follows: “Don’t you dare fuck this up for us. I
The world around him appears deafeningly quiet, the phone booth’s walls seem to make up his entire existence and not stretch any further into the universe, but the cars speeding by right at the edge of his vision yank him down as if he’s some wave pulled back and forth by the moon.
humanity hidden within the monster pretending to come baring gifts. Whether it’s a blessing or a curse is yet to be uncovered. It’s just that bit easier to unleash raw rage upon someone who seems unaffected by your words, someone incapable of empathy.
but he considers it. He considers telling her everything down to the last gruesome detail through the sobs and the tears and the humiliation, even if he has to beg for it, even if it would mean life long under witness protection, he doesn’t care, Castiel just wants to go
bad sign and a clear indication his years of being clean got caught in the line of fire created by temptation. Relapsing would be about the worst thing that could possibly happen right now yet as he stares at the glass in his hands, Cas can’t find a solid reason not to drink its contents within.
Unsurprisingly, Mr. Winchester takes his sweet time to make his way over to the entrance hall once more, enjoying the sight of a terrified man in his house for just a while longer. “Alright, Teddy. Playtime’s over. Go in your room!” When Dean finally manages to drag the dog away, Cas can weakly inhale again even though his throat was already closing up a bit.
. “That’s why I couldn’t tell you earlier. It will be announced publicly so we’ve had to keep this secret until now. I hope you understand.” The words sound even more vile when their lying nature is being transferred from paper to his own untrustworthy voice, but he powers through. He has to.
Luxury comes at a prize apparently, that price being awkwardness and uncomfortable silence because you see, cars like these were specifically made to be quiet. Mr. Winchester might not care, he hadn’t said a word to Castiel all night anyway and probably doesn’t give a single fuck, but for Cas on the other hand, it brought along a great deal of anxiety.
“Exactly. We’ve been there before.” Castiel cuts him off, perhaps just a tad bit too defensive. “Sorry, it’s just, with our father and all… we grew up with paparazzi in our faces so that’s not the issue.”
But what do they know, right? The same boss they drool over and worship, has more blood on his hands than the murderers they read about in the papers and fear. They’re oblivious to what goes on in Mr. Winchester’s private life, to what he does to Castiel when no one’s watching.
“This,” Mr. Winchester grits out before aggressively grabbing Cas’s hand and pushing it right against the hardness clad in expensive, tight fabric, “you know what to do with it, don’t you?” But Castiel yanks his arm back as hard as he can, firmly shaking his head and watching the capitalist in fright as he tries to scoot away impossibly further. “No, no, please, don’t.”
“Talk to me.” Mr. Winchester says breaking the silence, then adding a growled ‘now’ accompanied by a painful squeeze to emphasise it wasn’t a request. After that, his thumb immediately falls back into the steady rhythm of brushing up and down along Cas’ sweater where it sticks to the clammy skin beneath.
He’d done his research, you know? Anything to understand dogs a little better. Not because he was ready to get over his phobia, but to avoid a repeat of getting bitten in the damn face for getting too close to the dog’s bowl. ‘Food aggression’ the site told him.
Castiel should have seen it coming, the look in Wesson’s eyes being a fair warning, but the punch still literally knocks the air out of him as it lands square against the side of his face where it immediately leaves a throbbing ache spreading through his skin. “You go after him right now! I don’t care if you have to beg him on your knees. You will take that deal or I’ll make sure the charges are being shifted from the company to you personally. I don’t have to explain what it will be like to try and defend yourself against Winchester International, do I?”
There’s a drawn out moment of silence between them after that as if both men are unsure of what the right path of action is here. Eventually Mr. Winchester takes a leap and places his hand on Castiel’s arm, too firm to be perceived as loving yet too careful to be considered a warning so after one slow exhale, they let some tension go.
His decision hadn’t been hidden in the words spoken, too fragile of a concept and too broken of a surrender to be laid barren. Rather, it had been enclosed in the words
The slight flinch when one of his hands shoots up is riveting but he holds back, grips the navy tie instead and pulls on it a bit. “It was crooked.” Is the only thing he says when looking back up. Seeing how unravelled those blue eyes are beneath his gaze is inexpressible and for the second time that evening, he has to really hold back to not take this man apart with irreversible damage.
One of them, the same man who’d dragged him out of his car before, pushes him down on one of three chairs in the dark space without speaking a single word to him, neither of them do, not even when he starts asking questions and demanding answers.
Cas turns around upon hearing the voice, trying to hide how startled he was by someone calling out to him in the empty hallway. It’s Benny, Dean’s personal bodyguard.
“I said you’re not special. It’s not because your boss was contracted by my legal team that you suddenly get any individual treatment or something because, well, I don’t care. You’re just another person who’s name I’ll never remember while mine will be up on the billboards again soon enough. So, like I said: don’t you have something better to do than waste my time here?”
“Shh,” Dean shushes instantly and tries to soothe the man in his arms by pressing soft kisses to the sweaty dark hair while quickly making his way to the set of waiting cars. “It’s okay, you’re going to be okay” he whispers over and over, and Cas believes him. “Let’s go, Benny. He's burning up.”
Sure, Sam Wesson was a strict boss who yelled at him more than once, who even grabbed or yanked him harshly on a number of occasions but it had never phased him, Castiel always felt like he’d done something to deserve it and he was more than clever enough to know that a still relatively young company needed to be at its best 24/7 to insure success, no room for errors.
Castiel has to close his eyes when a shaky sob reaches him through the phone. He stands there for a minute; holding on to the wall to keep himself from just sinking to the floor as warm tears travel down his cheeks, pooling around hesitant lips.
“Will you let me speak?!” Castiel snaps. Surprisingly, Dean does. “Neighbors got concerned because they hadn’t seen me in a long while and I wasn’t answering so they called the cops. End of story.”
When lunch time rolls around, Dean scatters out of the office again, this time taking his briefcase with him and Castiel panics for a second. Was he supposed to just wait there? But then the ginormous ass walks back in, seems to contemplate for a moment and then just grunts while vaguely motioning for Cas to follow him as he shoots through the doors again.
It all boils down to the same old shenanigans though: him being his brother’s wingman by tagging along, putting in some good words for Gabriel during the first few seconds and then being wholly forgotten for the rest of the evening as if he’s world’s most pathetic third wheel.
But Castiel is softer than he thought. If Mr. Novak had just been some woman to be seduced, fucked and discarded like all the others, Dean would have gotten rid of him already, thrown on the pile of forgotten garbage, skin touched by a king no longer of import.
There’s a moment of calmness before Mr. Winchester continues, voice sweet. “Listen to me, sugar. This man, he hurt you didn’t he? He hurt you. I just made sure he’ll never lay another hand on you nor will he ever yell at you again. I did it for you, to protect you.”
? Whatever shall he do with the first free afternoon in years? A shower first, for sure. That’d allow him to discard of the clothes that had gotten equally splattered with pink goo during his
Even as he makes his way through the immense building that is Winchester International Co., he can still feel how his legs complain with every little step he takes but he’s got to smile through it. And the reason behind that is how he suddenly gets noticed by people. Employees beam at him now, nodding politely as he passes them. Some even blush a little bit. Before this
The path to successful rehab had always been the promise of a better life but what promise was there when he could get out of Dean’s grip?
He wants to feel awkward with a stranger sitting next to him, especially with how weird the entire situation truly must be. No matter how nice Paula is to Castiel, there’s no forgetting that the only reason he’s there in the first place is because his fake fiancé’s abuse landed him in the hospital, and that’s a messed up thing to keep in mind.
Yet here he is, buzzing with anger as he reminisces about a day that was filled with nothing but involuntary capitulation like the coward he is. Dean Winchester might threaten him with a loaded weapon but surely the man couldn’t actually get away with murder, right?
Mr. Winchester could spend hours screaming into his phone as he walked around the office slamming doors and even smashing mugs to bits and pieces without a care in the world because no one was there to hear anyway. It was the perfect hideaway. A not-so-secret secret lair for a villain, one might say.
The actual medical exam takes no more than fifteen minutes. All Castiel was allowed to do was sit there and let Dean answer any possible questions, that’s what they’d discussed beforehand. Even now, as he’s still sitting on the couch, fidgeting with his glass of water to wish away some of the nerves, Mr. Winchester is doing the talking for him.
One thing led to another, up until the point where it came within inches of escalating into yet another war between gangs. The only thing stopping such bloodshed? The bullet in John’s brain.
