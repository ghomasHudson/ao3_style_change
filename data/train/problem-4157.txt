In Kermit, Texas there were lots of frogs. And if there weren't, there should've been. It's in the name.
Apparently, they waited 'till morning, 'cause it was light out when they finally got around to putting their stuff in the trunk of The  (TM). Sam tossed Dean the keys and they got in.
"Yeah, and Sasha Grey's gone legit," Dean said sarcastically. Sam made a face and Dean said, "What?"
It was daytime (the same day or a different day? Who knows). Dean watched two kids run around and shoot each other with  guns when BAM! Flashback!
Dean eventually managed to pin the dude against a tree with a  against his neck. The dude revealed his Sharp, Pointy Vampire  (TM).
"Michigan. Look, his high- girlfriend goes there," Sam said showing Dean the girl's Facebook page, probably.
It was night, and now it's day when Sam pulled up to a cabin. He went inside, only to have Dean dump Holy  on him.
Anyway, it was night and Dean had arrived at his destination. Turn he dug up a grave. When he was done, he rolled up his sleeve and his arm was all glowy and stuff.
"There was some stuff about closing the Gates of Hell. Forever," Kevin said, "That could be important, right."
Dean went to the refrigerator and got two beers (don't  kids) and handed one to Sam before sitting at the table.
Dean, still keeping his gun trained on the couple, slowly walked away. Then, he stole one of their bags and ran off.
"You're just helping me out of the goodness of your heart, huh?" Dean asked skeptically, "Why? What's in it for you?"
Dean was running around in Purgatory. Turns out, he was chasing somebody! D'you see how it ties in? (Supernatural's got a problem, okay).
Channing was dripping Black Tar and holding a bowl and a dagger. She slit Brenda's throat and caught the blood in the bowl. She said a few words and the blood started to boil. Then, she started talking to it. Demons are weird, okay.
Kevin explained to the bros. how he'd translated part of The Demon Tablet (TM) and escaped from Crowley.
"Oh yeah," Kevin said sarcastically, "The King of Hell snapped my girlfriend's neck. I'm awwwwwwesome."
Our story starts (or, I suppose, continues) in Maine's 100 Mile Wilderness. I wonder if. it's actually a hundered miles. Hmm.
Dean played another message. Then another, in which Kevin sounded drunk. Dean replayed the last part of that message, where Kevin said, "Eat me" for dramatic effect or something. Then he played the last message.
"Hello?" he called. After looking around for like five seconds, he said, "I think it was a  or something."
He cut his arm and held it over the bones in the grave. The glowy stuff dripped out of his arm while he said a few words.
Anyway, Sam was packaging a bag. He petted the doggy that was sleeping on his bed with his girlfriend. Then he petted her too, for good measure. Turn he went outside and got in The  (TM) and drove away (this was all at night, BTW).
The camp, their base, had been hit ten minutes after they’d left, several hours had passed since then. The only thing left of it was debris and smoking logs.
The ruins were amazing. This was Max’ favourite part of being friends with Cas and was Cas’ favourite thing to give his history-buff friend. Apart from the instant healing and the teleporting, Max always raved about the places he got to visit. When they’re were doing something ‘celestially oriented’ as Max put it, they always saw something human usually wouldn't. Going to ancient places, seeing the history that people didn’t know existed was amazing to him. This place was Angkorian, it was ancient, like 802 AD ancient. Humans hadn’t stepped foot in this place in a very long time.
“Cas!” Dean yelled and threw himself at the Angel. They embraced hard and Dean felt a wave of relief.
Cas turned and looked around. He hadn’t been here for several thousand years, it looked different. If he was correct, they were in the main chamber now and the spell would work. The words were in Enochian, Max knew what was being said and his eyes followed Cas’. A flashed blinded them both momentarily as light filled the ceiling of the rock cavern.
“Yeah, I think near the roof somewhere. There weren’t any windows but now and then I would here a chopper, it was close.”
“This is why we should have run the other way, but no, I followed your stupid ass,” Max hissed under his breath, “Sure, let's follow Cas on one of his mysterious walks through the jungle.”
“I don’t want their money,” he said, sipping his coke, “You know they feel obligated to send it, Anna makes them.”
“Hey,” Dean said as he walked towards him, closer than he should have. Closer than any normal human would have in any normal situation.
The city passed in a blur and Dean melted when Cas squeezed his hand three times. His body was aflame and this was the happiest he’d ever been, he hoped it was a sign. On leaving the taxi Dean paused, he’d left his jacket on the seat but once in his hand, they moved towards the hotel entrance. They didn’t notice the cab driver calling after them. They didn’t realise that on the seat lay a picture. A generally innocuous picture. One of people being immortalised in film without their knowledge, with a perfect couple dancing in the background.
Looking over at his little brother he frowned, “Don’t throw orders my way, Sammy. Have you forgotten who leads the resistance? I know what I’m doing.”
“No,” Dean said as his fingers ran across the screen. It was an absent-minded gesture that had Sam’s eyebrows hitting the roof.
“Hold him!” Naomi’s voice screamed as their hands gripped his arms and legs past the point of bruising. Sheer agony was all he could focus on, that and breathing. Then past the point of breaking. His bones snapped under the pressure of the assault, his soul started to waver, splinter. The part that was now Angel reached for the rest of its soul. Castiel…
Cas, yeah Cas… he liked that. The angel tilted his head, fuck that was cute. Right, said the part of him that had been hunted his whole life, let just stop that right here but the rest of him wasn’t listening. The Angel was hot and an Incubus, high up on the scale, he could feel it, exactly Dean’s type. Oh, that sucked because god only knew it would take hell freezing over for his people to be okay with him and an Angel. Was he really considering that as a possibility? Shit, no. He took that thought and slammed the mental door closed tight then focused on the enemy, yes the enemy. ‘…but it’s Cas’ a small voice whined and he batted it aside.
“Did you just compare an Angel of the lord, an ancient and complex wave of celestial intent, to a bird?” Cas glared, eyebrow raised.
“Rummaged through your brain for the location and then brought you home. That was three days ago and it won't leave.”
Dean hung up, thank god, the temptation to be inappropriate was overwhelming. He was likely in mission control back in Kansas and they would be recording everything. Dean couldn’t afford to be outed.
Meg’s laugh followed him across the room as strode towards the doors. Before he got there it flew open nearly striking his shoulder. As he froze, waiting for whoever had opened it to come in, a human, no, not human, a half breed fell through the opening. Whatever it had been through seemed to be too much because it passed out, nearly falling to the hard ground. Cas caught the bloody broken thing as it slid to the floor.
“Fine! I’ll call but I don’t know if we can trust her Cas,” she glanced at the ceiling, “I trusted her to find you but this, this is different.”
“Dean, Cas has just gone to heaven, he’ll be back. You’re being insane, is this something to do with that cupid case? Have you been cursed or something?” Sam frowned and started cleaning the bacon up.
They moved towards the pick-up location it was hard going due to the overgrowth and the encroaching dark. Turning on their flashlights as they trekked was necessary, keeping everything human was the only choice they had right now they'd taken a lot of risks today.
A loud whir that only Cas could hear interrupted their jokes, “Glory, Incoming,” he advised. The chopper eventually getting closer roaring as it set down in the only clearing for miles around. They ran for it and jumped in.
Three hours later they were in the empty lot next to the bunker with a boosting spell to point an arrow at their cupid. Dean hoped the witch was watching because they'd needed some weird ass ingredients from the gross stuff draw. It was annoying because he was going to have to make Sammy go and replace them. None liked the gross stuff draw, well except jack.
Nodding, Cas fell back into the memory as he spoke, “It was the day I left, only a few months before I met you. The fighting had been slowing down because of the peace talks because of the losses your side was taking. So I tried to talk to them again. I got in yet another argument with Anna about how we treated humans. There was no reason to use them any more, the Demons were outnumbered and victory was imminent. We couldn’t reach a compromise because she wanted to be sure we should win and would keep them until she was sure. As the fighting wined, my brethren became more and more vicious with the humans. They were treating them as pets to be played with. I couldn’t stomach it so I challenged them. Anna stepped in knowing they would lose against me. She knew it would escalate and result in deaths that we couldn't afford. She was my best friend but on this, we fought. To show weakness would have been her end and if there is one thing angels can't abide it's weakness. It took everything I had not to kill her, I didn’t want to kill her but I was always stronger.”
“I hope not, halo-boy because it’ll be a really big problem… you know, for me, the breathing human?”
The horror of possibly leading them here to their safe place consumed him, “Cas, can they follow me here?”
Jack nodded, “Sure, I could feel Dean’s pain when I first arrived through my wall. When Cas wasn’t here it was like he wasn’t whole. Then when he was back it was like… a puzzle.” The Nephilim tilted his head, “Like they just-fit.”
He sighed, a most unnecessary sigh and met her gaze, “I think… I think they used my grace to make Dean into whatever he is.”
“It’s not something I’d want to do,” Dean replied. “…but if it was me and you, well maybe I’d make an exception.”
“Okay,” he said, moving to embrace his friend, tightly, “Just don’t fucking scare me like that again, not this close to a refresh. You’re terrifying like that.”
Dean started to cry, sobbing, huge tears, “I can’t live like this… he’s my soul mate and now he’s gone.”
Cas glared at him, “We’ve supposedly been in the jungle for days. We’re in another country than only a few hours ago and you look like you just returned from a day spa. Yes, we’re walking the ten miles back unless you want to raise some eyebrows? Again.”
“Cool, so we’ll be disguised as angels and everything, we’ll look like we have an angel essence too?” Dean asked.
It must have been a comical sight for Dean to watch as they fought over this. Finally, she relented.
The gorgeous Angel slid out of him slowly. Dean clenched at the empty feeling which was doubled as Cas pulled his fingers from his mouth. His jaw hurt in a good way and he swallowed trying to get saliva in all the dry parts of his mouth.
Sam glanced at him intently and passed him a plate of bacon he had just finished frying, “Why do you look weird and why would he be dead?”
“It’s saved your butt more than once,” Cas replied, glancing up. That’s why they called him, Uri, he was their guard and their lucky charm, it became his call sign when they’d enlisted. When the others in their team had asked, Max had mentioned Ancient Mesopotamian religious studies. Everyone agreed with it rather than keep him talking. Going on about their years at Harvard typically got that response in their profession. They both dragged and rolled back into the hole he just crawled out of, Cas steadying Max as he rolled in.
The glass of whiskey was warm from where he held it and on adjusting his jacket he almost knocked it over. Cursing, he made sure the amber liquid was intact, the bar closed long ago and Dean wasn’t ready to leave quite yet. A Polaroid on the table caught his attention. It was generally innocuous. A table of people being immortalised in film without their knowledge. Mobile printers had been the favours on the tables. The focus of the picture wasn’t what intrigued him, it was the two men dancing in the background. The intrigued smile turned grim. Even though the memory was a happy one, it felt bittersweet remembering the moment.
“I told her no,” she sighed, “That it was too much of a risk, we’d have seconds to scout around and if we ever wanted to go back in?”
Max turned to him, expression serious, “I wouldn't out you. I know how hard it is for... I get it. I have your back.” Tugging Cas out of the ditch they’d been hiding in.
The rest of their team had left to scout, that was half an hour before the incursion. Cas was the ranking officer, the one keeping them alive out here in this mess. Max knew Cas was right which is why he was scowling so hard. At the moment he was, yet again, trying to figure out how Cas had known the camp was going to be hit. How he’d known which way to go. Max had been his friend forever and knew he could be, eccentric, sometimes… well psychic for lack of a better word. Military guys were superstitious and as long as he didn't acknowledge it outright Cas could keep saving their asses. Like right now. They crawled through the undergrowth and eventually after several minutes of wet muddy shit, he stood. Max followed and they hiked for a mile before either one spoke. The jungle was beautiful, Cas mused as they walked, it was just… wet.
“Holy fuck.” This was going to be better than he’d imagined. After two quick fucks with a finger, Cas took out his cock and rubbed it against Dean’s ass. It was huge, both long and wide. The thought of being that full was amazing and terrifying. As the angel lined up his dick with the tight hole Dean became a little pensive. Surely he wasn’t going to… yep, he was. The bulbous head pushed against the tiny orifice and Dean moaned. There was no way he was safewording out. Cas pushed and the slick opening accepted the first inch of his head. It was amazing and painful as the long-unused opening struggled to adapt to the enormous intruder. Another inch in and Dean was gasping for breath past the pain. “Apple-”, before he’d even finished the pain was gone. Cas was still inside him but the pain was simply gone. Dean froze as pleasure pulsed through his body. Holy shit, Cas’ cock was huge. It felt amazing now the pain had ebbed a little.
Sam sat on a fallen tree swinging his long legs back and forth. Rain fell from the makeshift shelter they had created from branches. A thunderous midday sky growled at them and Dean grimaced, why couldn’t they have started this on a warm summer day?
Their world was divided in many ways but at the core was the Incubi and Succubi genes. The Incubi, like Cas, were more dominant, sometimes it was their whole personality, sometimes only their bedroom persona was affected. The traits didn’t always manifest strictly and could vary though one fact was always the same when it came to sex, Incubi were dominant. Succubi, like the half breed in his arms, were usually passive and they were happy in secondary rather than leading roles. Again it wasn’t absolute and it varied but one rule held when it came to sex Succubi were submissive in bed, always. When the two met it was like a scent or an aura, you always knew who was who.
“I can’t explain it. I feel like I know this human. Dean,” he corrected because it felt wrong and impersonal to call him by his species. “I feel, more than I ever have Meg. The past three days waiting for him to wake was torture unlike any I've experienced. I can honestly say if he left, if I had to survive without him, I’d hunt him down simply to exist in his presence.”
Glancing over his shoulder he replied with a wry smile, “Nothing. You begged Mom to let you go out scouting and now you’re bored?”
Cas’ golden skin glinted with sweat as he wrestled with his pack. The jungle was green, so green and hot. Everything was wet from the humidity and Cas decided the jungle was not somewhere he wanted to come back to. Though he made that promise every time they were in a jungle. In fact, he preferred the desert missions. It was easier to pretend to be sweaty than it was to be completely soaked, he hated feeling damp.
“Hey, loser,” Meg’s now real voice called from behind him. She landed softly behind him, her calf-high biker boots were spotlessly clean with her plum torn jeans tucked inside. The matching leather jacket covered her ACDC faded T-shirt, the purple catching the moonlight ominously.
Max shoved his rifle behind him, knowing nothing in this place would be hurt by bullets. Nothing should be down here but if it was Max had to fully rely on Cas to protect him whatever nasties came along.
He grimaced at the thought of his mother's wrath but it would have to wait, he needed to figure out what was happening. Not just with the Angels but with his Angel. This connection was strange, maybe they could use it. They’d been hunting his people for a long time but if Dean was alive then maybe some of the others were? If they were they had to save them, he voiced this in hopes Sam would see reason. “Maybe some of the others are alive Sammy? Did you think about that? If I survived, maybe they did too?”
“Well, this is homey,” she commented as her foot touched the floor of the communications room, “They defiantly like the librarian meets military function chic.”
“Yes, but the block she used held the memories back and the ability for me to sense myself in you until we were… intimate.”
“I’m surprised you're still alive…” Max added suddenly. Cas’ confused expression prompted him, “It’s ninety-five degrees out here, it must be what, 150 in your closet?”
The kitchen was stocked for two, Sam and Ruby had been surviving on frozen essentials. Dean pointed to the high stools for them to sit as he raided the place for his ingredients. Cas paid little attention to food usually, only eating when Meg wanted to try a new restaurant but otherwise seeing no point to the extra expense or effort. Yet, the way Dean moved around the industrial-sized kitchen had him captivated. He watched as he placed the ingredients on the side and lit the grill, took note as Dean chopped onions, one of the only fresh ingredients, with care and skill.  He became absorbed in the micro-expressions on his face as he concentrated wholly on his task until Meg’s laughter broke his focus.
Dean frowned as Cas told him his side of things and Cas awaited the anger of the betrayal. But instead, Dean met his gaze and said, “Thanks… for Sammy…” he paused, “Then the hospital…”
The safe opened and Dean grabbed a necklace, they each wore one. Taking it, he secured the safe and then jogged to the door.
Dean smiled at him and Sam slammed his hand on the table, “Dean! Seriously, stop eye-fucking him okay. It’s disturbing as all Hell.”
“This way,” Cas said as he crossed the cavern to a set of stairs. It was pitch black and Max pulled his flashlight out now he knew they were not alone. Cas was vigilant, more so than before. The steps continued on the other side, then sloped upwards and to the right. It was an interesting design, there were small, hidden places where people could wait and attack. Thankfully, there was no one waiting for them in the wings. The steps were wide and made to keep you at an uncomfortable gait. Cas led while Max brought up the rear, they were silent as they walked. Several minutes passed and eventually the stairs levelled out onto a landing. Cas grabbing Max’s shoulder as he walked backwards. His friend looked over, eyes going wide, the drop was sheer and at least a hundred feet down.
Tearing himself from the bed, he dressed quickly. Once done he tucked the blanket around Dean’s exhausted form but as he moved towards the door Dean stirred. “It’s okay, I’ll be right back,” Cas whispered, unsure of where the soft platitude had emerged. Something strange was definitely happening. He vanished from the room and landed at the main door, opening it slowly. Caution was his new best friend as he crept into the very early morning darkness, the cool air caressing his bare arms, it was rare he didn’t have his trench coat on and the lack of it left arms bare by way of his rolled up shirt.
Dean watched as Cas reached out and held his hand just above Deans bare chest and said, “I feel it settling now. I think our intimacy released more than just your memories, it let me feel the wall she placed in my mind and between us so I wouldn’t feel you. When the essence was injected she underestimated your will to escape and my power.”
“Hey, no. Don't do that. We’re in a jungle for fuck's sake, all macho and shit. We have guns! Come on you’re ruining my strong hetero vibe here.”
Humans could be so pleasant when they were sleeping but not Dean. No, he had horrible nightmares that were relentless. It was understandable of course, the half breed had been tortured by Cas’ kind. He had lost time and woke up tainted with grace, it was a trauma that would take time to process. Cas embraced him to stop them and as soon as his arms touched Dean he began to settle. There was a childlike softness to the human as he settled into Cas’ embrace. Peacefulness fell over him, something he hadn’t felt since being in heaven itself. Whenever Dean twitched, Cas had to stroke him back to peace and he vowed that he would kill them all for harming this one human. For a long time, he’d ignored the atrocities of his family but for this one human, he would burn their evil empire to the ground and smile while it happened.
Dean was barely registering the conversation because all he could see was Cas big blue eyes. Before he knew what he was doing his lips were on the Angels. It was like bliss wrapped in honey, sprinkled with bacon cheeseburgers.
“Right, what are we doing?” Max asked, immediately on board with whatever it was. Cas missed him like this. Maybe he could leave it like this for a while? His brothers had backed off, it’d been a year since they’d checked in...maybe.
“Cas?” Max looked up, eyes filled with tears. Yeah, this was the worst, that sadness, it hurt Cas in his near-human places. Then Max threw his solid body into the Angel's arms. They hugged tight, feeling whole once again. They stayed like that for a full minute until the urgency of the mission took over. This was the joint-first most important person in Cas’ very long life. He always missed him when he didn’t remember, like he wasn’t here even though he was.
Meg considered it for a moment and then replied, “She vanished a few hundred years ago but I know of her, yes. Why?”
“So you have no issue with her letting murders run free but you are intimidated by how good she is at it?” Cas replied, shaking his head, “I will never understand demons.”
“It’s pitch black outside your light ball thing. Typical, I visit the oldest place on earth and I can’t even see it. I'm going to turn my torch-”
Clearly, the Angels had damaged more than his body, before they’d taken him, the thought of fucking an Angel would have made him want to blow chunks not his load. Now it seemed like all the good ideas, just all of them.
Dean watched his brother fidget. The tall young man was dishevelled, very unlike Sam. The beard took him from twenty-five and pushed him to closer to thirty.
The feeling was mutual, the enemy was everywhere and it made him twitchy. At one time the City was all Sam would talk about but something had changed. That day in the field, he wasn’t sure what, the memory was foggy but Sam got back to camp older than he’d left it, he was quiet and subdued.
Shaking his head he added, “Okay Meg. I, I think I healed his human side but I think he’s part something else and that… it feels broken, damaged but I can’t touch it.”
His friend had recovered her composure in the seconds it had taken to walk through the door. While demons didn’t tend to feel much of anything at all, Meg had always been a little different. Cas has deduced long ago that this was one of the reasons for their bond. They were both anomalies of their kind and it drew them to each other.
The pounding was relentless. Cas’ other hand supported some of his weight on the bed as he thrust all that length into Dean’s tight abused hole. The slick feeling kept coming. It allowed him to enjoy it fully with a touch of pain from the force. The Angel was holding back, he knew it because Cas could have torn his ass in two. It showed how submissive he was that the idea of being physically decimated turned him on. Dean's hands gripped the comforter as the ferociousness and speed increased. Cas was close, Dean could feel it. Shudders forced up from his groin, he was going to cum without ever being touched directly. Shit, this guy was good.
Cas nodded, a scowl quickly following, “They knew the land was here but not the tomb or what it contained because of warding. No one should care, it’s been lost for an age.”
Cas watched the canopy as the attack was called in and Max was brief so as not to draw more attention to their location. “That was close. They’re sending in air support but we have to get out of this hole.” Max grabbed his shoulder, “Uri?”
“I need to run an errand,” Cas replied, face unmoving, no trace of the casual, laughing person that had been there only moments ago.
Cas started to move and the pain returned but now he knew what was coming Dean could relax. He sighed as inch after inch of Cas’ monster dick filled him. Dean shuddered as Cas moaned his name, oh holy god this was amazing.
“Uri…” Max began but his friend was a million miles away, breaking protocol he used his name to grab his attention, “Cas?”
Cas’s finger curls under his chin then, and he lifts Dean’s face to bore into his eyes. Dean licks his lips as Cas’s thumb strokes his jaw. It’s a tenderness that makes his heart ache.
He tilts his head at Dean before speaking again, and in this moment, Dean thinks Jack looks just like his father.
Cas’s breath is shaky as his voice cracks on the last syllable. He lifts his head to press a warm, delicate kiss to Dean’s forehead before bending to knock them together again.
Dean nods once, straightening to rest back against his seat. The fire has died down to tiny flames licking the charred stacks of wood.
Cas tilts his head in that fucking adorable way he does, and Dean can feel something behind his ribs melt. He stops when they are a few inches apart.
Their mouths are inches apart, and Dean’s bowed legs go a little weak as he stares into Cas’s eyes. The lighting in the bar changes to ambient, almost candle-like glow.
Dean leans back into his chair, left hand draped over Cas’s knee, the other nursing a fresh beer.  He stares pensively into the flames, watching sparks from the air pockets float up and disappear.
Dean doesn’t even have it in himself to brush it off. So just rolls his eyes with a nod and drops his head into his hands. Silence settles between them, and Dean revels in it as he focuses on his breathing. He reaches to grab his bourbon and sips it.
Sam’s face is contorted into something pitiful and concerned, puppy dog eyes on full display. He moves the hand that was on his elbow to the side of Dean’s face, trying to help him focus.
Dean tugs him close before snaking his arms around Cas’s waist under his trench coat and hugs him close, face buried in the angel’s shoulder. He melts when Cas’s envelopes him, cheek resting against his crown, hands rubbing soothing patterns against Dean’s back.
Cas’s legs nearly give out then. He pulls Dean into his chest, cupping the back of his head to bury Dean’s face into his neck. Dean’s arms wrap around him like a vice, and he sobs quietly into his skin.
So he lets his hand fall against his thigh and sighs heavily. His breath comes out in tiny clouds as the wind gusts again.
“I’m going to bed,” she announces to both of them before stepping into Sam’s awaiting embrace. They kiss softly, and something inside Dean melts because he’s so happy to see them together again.
Dean nods around the neck of his beer as he takes a long swig. It’s cold and soothing down his throat, and closes his eyes to relish it.
Ragged breaths fill the kitchen as they both heave for air. Foreheads rest together as Cas drops the hand from Dean’s hair to rest it over his heart.
Dean lets his eyes flutter shut as Cas’s fingers continue to lull him to sleep. He shifts to pillow his head on the angel’s chest, and silence settles softly between them.
He looks at Sam questioningly. “What time is it?” he croaks as he cranes his aching neck back to rest his head back against the wall.
Dean reaches down between them, palming at Cas’s thinly-covered cock, hard and rigid beneath his fingers. Cas tears his mouth away to arch his back, grinding into Dean’s hand with a moan.
Dean freezes. His mouth goes dry, and his vision blurs out of focus as he stares unseeingly into his glass. He can’t move. The paralysis sits in almost instantly and his chest feels like it’s being crushed under concrete.
He can feel the heat creep up his neck and settle in his cheeks and in the tips of his ears. He’s not sure if he’s even allowed to show this kind of intimacy yet, and to spill his guts to Cas twice in the same night, it’s...well.
It’s a gentle, smoldering thing; not urgent or frenzied, neither panicked nor rushed. Something heavy and ethereal blooms behind Castiel’s ribs and spreads through his limbs, leaving sparks and tingles in its wake. He lets himself sink against the counter, and welcomes all of Dean’s weight as he presses into him.
It’s a devouring, all-consuming inferno, and it’s somehow the softest place Dean has ever known. Warm and safe and loved; somewhere Dean can lose all pieces of his armor and not worry about where they land. Dean reaches his free hand to cup Cas’s cheek, licking into his mouth with such wanton desire he doesn’t know how his knees don’t give out right then and there.
Castiel sighs heavily as he licks his lips and swallows. “And then with everything that happened in Purgatory...hearing your prayers every night, and needing to do everything in my power to keep you safe—”
They’re buried into the cocoon of Dean’s bed sometime later, cleaned and spent and boneless, Cas cradling Dean in the crook of his arm while running his fingers languidly through sandy brown hair.
Dean nods again, running his thumb over the ridges of his glass. He tumbles Sam’s words in his head, almost like he’s trying them on for size. He wishes. He really does. He hopes that wherever John Winchester is now, that he would want Dean to be happy. And that he really would be able to accept it.
Cas nods as he presses his lips to Dean’s forehead, drawing him to his chest as the last of Dean’s resolve crumbles like concrete.
Dean finally finds his voice, but it’s harsher than he meant for it to be. He gapes his mouth open, closes it again. He licks his lips. His heart is hammering against his ribs, and the ringing in his ears returns. He can feel his hands trembling.
“That’s a bit redundant,” Cas deadpans, and Dean can’t help the chuckle that escapes him as he half-nods.
“What did you say?” Dean asks in the stillness. Cas’s fingers stall in their movements as Dean peers up at him.
His eyes flit between Cas’s and his lips and back again, and he flattens his free palm on Cas’s chest, just over where his heart would be.
Dean steps back and claps Jack on the shoulder, eyes brimming with tears that he doesn’t let fall. Jack gives a small, proud smile as his eyes flicker ever so briefly above Dean’s right shoulder to the giant oak tree behind them. Dean doesn’t notice.
John and Mary are sitting at one of the candle-lit tables, holding hands and murmuring in each other’s ears that is always met with soft laughter.
How does he unlearn that? How does he essentially retrain or re-wire everything he’s ever known when it comes to this?
He doesn’t realize he’d been walking until he comes to a stop, dirt swirling around his legs. Nothing hurt: not his hip, not his knees, his back, or chest.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean whispers. It’s a broken, barely audible thing. But the angel must have heard, because then Cas grips him even tighter and presses his lips into Dean’s hair.
Sam’s face spreads into a grin and drops a hand to Dean’s shoulder. “Yeah. She’s good, man. She’s okay. She’ll be happy to see you.”
Dean’s eyes well up and his nose starts to tickle. He looks up to the sky and wets his lips in that way he does to hold tears at bay, before meeting blue again.
So he sees to it to check the wound every day, tracking the progress of its healing and closely monitoring Dean’s recovery. The pink, puckered skin is still raised slightly, promising a gruesome scar in the future. But it’s nearly fully closed up, and there’s no sign of infection.
“Did you hit your head?” And Sam’s reaching to pull Dean’s hand away to examine the bump himself in lieu of waiting for an answer.
“I never prayed before you.” he settles on hoarsely. His throat is sandpaper and his tongue feels like it’s wrapped in cotton.
Heaven is strange, he thinks. He feels no sense of unease here. No nerves, no jitters. He only feels contentment. Peace. Joy.
“No,” he murmurs gently as he kisses the bolt of Dean’s jaw, licking at the hollow beneath his ear. “Let me take care of you.”
Dean goes all in, and when his tongue brushes and rolls against Castiel’s, he feels another tear escape from his closed eyes.
Dean sits back in his chair, glass of wine in hand. They’re a bottle and a half in, celebrating Dean’s arrival, and his head is buzzing in the best possible way at the base of his skull.
“You look good,” Dean says wistfully before patting Jack’s cheek. His hand falls with a slap against his thigh.
Crickets start to chirp in the distance. Some breed of owl hoots, and the lake ripples gently against the shore.
“I love you too,” Dean chokes out around a muffled cry as one hand frames Cas’s jaw, the other falling to grasp against his ribs, fisting into his shirt.
“Cas, listen,” Dean breathes as he turns so that he’s standing in front of him now. Cas’s chin drops to his chest, avoiding his eyes, so Dean tries to reassure him by wrapping one hand around his wrist. And it seems to work, because Cas is looking up at him again.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas pants, his other hand coming to cup the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean’s tongue rolls over the angel’s slit and he moans at the taste.
It’s a small, quiet thing. Cas’s hand stills over the rim of the second glass before he glances over his shoulder at Dean.
“Mm,” Dean hums, head lolling back into the crook of Cas’s neck and captures his lips, licking into the hot, wet cavern of Castiel’s mouth.
,” Cas whispers into Dean’s ear. Something blooms in his chest at the sound of Cas’s native language on his tongue as he reaches for his face, plundering inside Cas’s mouth.
Dean picks up the guitar and returns to his seat, and he leans over to grab the last log off the ground and throws it into the fire.  Dean settles the instrument against his torso on his knee, letting one hand lean over the body, and wraps the other around the neck.
Now though, after Jack pulled him out of the Empty, grace left behind, he’s finding it exceedingly more difficult to hide behind a mask. Especially now that his built-in armor is gone.
“Of fuckin’ this up. Hurting you. Lettin’ you down. Losin’ you. Take your pick.” He draws his bottom lip between his teeth as he stares intensely at the flannel pattern of his sleep pants.
He leans into Cas’s space then, and wraps his arms around his waist, leaning his forehead into Cas’s shoulder as Cas’s arms encircle his back.
The ice cube has been reduced to a melted mess, with only a chip of it remaining. He reaches over to grab a bunch of napkins out of the dispenser and wipes his hands, then the table.
“Relax”, he whispers warmly in Dean’s ear, lips brushing the shell, causing Dean to shudder as goosebumps erupt everywhere. Cas slowly lifts Dean’s elbow to his head.
The voice in his head is cackling now, and Dean wishes he could throw something at it, punch it, cut it out of his mind but he can’t. So he grips his hair and pulls. His stomach rolls again, but he knows there’s nothing left to come up.
,” and all coherent thought leaves Dean’s mind as Cas angles his hips, guiding Dean inside until they’re flush pelvic bone to pelvic bone.
“Listen man,” Sam starts. He waits for Dean to meet his gaze before continuing. “I know how you felt about Dad, okay? I know how much you idolized him. But, Dean…he’s gone. And he has been for a long time. You can’t let him have this control over you, you know? I know he had some really shitty ideals when we were growin’ up, but...but I’d like to think he would have eventually come around to accept it. You know?”
Dean’s eyes go wide as his breath staunters in lungs, mouth going as dry as the Sahara in the dead of summer. His heart pounds as his ears ring, chest feeling like it’s cracking open; bursting and releasing the pressure that has been building and building there since that night. His legs turn into lead, and his feet feel like they somehow grew roots.
The defeat and hurt in Cas’s tone makes him feel like he’s been hit in the backs of his knees, because Dean knows he put it there. Just like he did before.
The door opens and closes. Dean keeps his eyes fixed to the floor until the devil’s trap comes into view, and then he lifts his head.
Dean nearly melts when Cas immediately reciprocates and envelopes him. He dips his nose into the crook of Cas’s neck and he’s finally, finally, able to breathe.
“You carry all of your tension here,” Cas muses, voice low. His thumbs rub circular patterns at the base of Dean’s neck, then reaches to lift Dean’s right arm outwards. Cas returns his hands to beneath Dean’s shoulder blade and rubs vigorously.
Eileen nods. “I’m fine,” she says while signing, then gives him a pointed look. “Are you? You were out there for a while,” and then she’s looking over Dean’s shoulder to Sam, apparently not trusting the answer Dean’s about to give.
“Thank you.” It’s a hoarse whisper, and Dean isn’t surprised at the watery gaze he sees when he lifts his chin.
He feels Dean shake his head as a finger curls underneath his chin, lifting it to meet their eyes again. Cas’s chest aches when Dean’s palm cups his cheek, grazing the stubble.
It doesn’t take long until Cas is ready and squirming beneath Dean’s fingers, and Dean reaches a hand beneath his back to flip them over, Cas settled on top of him. Dean swallows thickly, meeting midnight blue eyes.
He tries to pass it off nonchalantly. He really does. But Cas sees straight through him, just like always. The pressure in Dean’s chest releases when Cas smiles at him through fanned eyelashes.
Dean strums the guitar a couple of times, tuning the keys where needed and testing it again, alternating between picking and full strums. He glances at Cas through his eyelashes and throws a shy smile his way.
Ragged, panting breaths fill the air around them as Cas lowers his forehead to Dean’s, and Dean lifts his chin to kiss Cas’s mouth softly.
Dean grasps Cas’s chin and angles his mouth because the kiss is a little stiff at first, a little too much teeth, and when he moves just a fraction of an inch, it’s the free fall.
“Cas,” he breathes through a sniffle, his thumb swiping across Cas’s cheekbone to smooth out the lone tear track. His heart aches when Cas ever so slightly leans into his touch.
He walks the short distance before standing in front of the bar, and he’s smiling so wide and he can feel his laugh lines on his cheeks and the crinkles of his eyes.
Tears cascade down his face without a blink. There seems to be no shortage of them; they slide and slide and slide down his cheeks and he feels them drip down his chin onto his chest.
He lets his index finger trace the letters of her name. Grief, guilt, and loss unfurls from behind his rib cage and grips around his heart like tentacles.
Dean heaves a breath, letting his eyes wander back to the stars. They twinkle, almost like an encouragement. Dean has the corner of his beer label peeled off when he feels a hand cover his.
Dean goes to shrug off his jacket, hanging it on the back of the desk chair when he sees Cas removing his zip-up. The grey v neck looks sinister on him, hugging all of the muscles and curves at his biceps and pectorals. When he arches back to pull at the sleeves, Cas’s shirt rises up just an inch. Dean’s mouth goes dry at the swath of skin at his navel that shows between the hem of his shirt and the rise of his pants.
“Dean…” and Dean pulls back slightly at the crack in Cas’s voice. Tears spill over in those cobalt blues, and Dean’s thumbs are quick to catch them as he frames Cas’s face.
Dean makes a fist, and watches blood pool into his palm before pressing it against the cinder block.
Jack glances down to the dirt for a fleeting moment. “I would have brought him back sooner, but —“ he meets Dean’s eyes again “—I needed his help with some things.” And Jack’s eyes flick up to the sky before sheepishly meeting Dean’s gaze again.
Dean reaches between them and grips Cas’s always-crooked tie. Cas looks confused at first, maybe even a little scared. But when Dean’s free hand comes to cradle the side of Cas’s neck and lets his fingers brush the strands of thick hair at its nape, Cas’s face smooths out and he stands a little taller.
“C’mere,” he breathes, crushing their mouths together in a filthy, bruising kiss. The taste of himself on Castiel’s lips is spellbinding.
Dean can’t play anymore after Cas is gone. He can barely bring himself to look at it. He had so many dreams about playing it one day.
“No?” Dean questions, green eyes searching for blue. “Surprised you didn’t come lookin’ for me when I didn’t come inside.”
“When you...did what you did, an-and said what you said...” Dean shakes his head to try to clear his mind. “I could never wash that jacket. Your handprint, it...it was the only thing I had left of you.”
“Yes,” he says again for tenacity, and the gravity of its sincerity begins to lift the weight of the world off his shoulders. He falls back against his chair weightlessly and takes a quiet, cleansing breath.
Cas moans, deep and throaty into Dean’s mouth, and lets his weight settle on top of him. Dean can feel Cas’s cock twitching against his thigh, and his hands snake inside the back of Cas’s pants, cupping his ass. He arches his back to rut against him.
He scans his eyes around the room, searching and searching until he finds the bottle of Kentucky Bourbon high up on a shelf. He rises from his seat and grabs it, along with two glasses from the cabinet before slumping back down into his seat.
Dean just shakes his head, and makes no further effort to respond. His pace quickens, and Sam falls behind until the only footsteps Dean hears are his own.
Castiel turns his head to the source of the noise, and when he meets Dean’s gaze, he thins his lips in a sort of pained smile before turning his back to look at the sky again.
It’s only when Dean’s lungs begin to scream that he breaks, parting from Cas’s lips to press their foreheads together, both panting in unison.
His throat is constricted now. Nausea settles like a harsh weight in his stomach, and he can feel his chest aching and squeezing around his heart. His mind is racing, ruminating, and he’s driving down the interstate on autopilot. He feels dissociated, like he’s floating out-of-body above from where he sits.
Dean’s breath saunters, and Cas can feel a warm wetness trickle down the slope of his neck, seeping into his shirt.
In the days following Chuck’s demise and Jack’s ascension, Dean grabs a canvas drop cloth from the garage and takes the guitar from where it sits in the corner of his bedroom. A film of dust covers the instrument.
“And I don’t mean it in a dick way,” he amends, and Dean knows he doesn’t. But still. Sam’s quiet for a second before continuing. “This has to do with dad, right?”
Dean doesn’t stop the single tear that slips down his cheek. In lieu of words, Dean lets a shuddering sob speak for him. Cas’s grip tightens in response.
Cas’s white shirt is unbuttoned at the neck, and Dean’s mouth goes a little dry at the naked dip of his collar bone. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and Dean marvels at the ripples of muscle and bone in the angel’s forearms, his fingers itching to touch.
Dean sets his jaw and takes one step forward. His legs feel numb, like a shock of electricity has just bolted through them, and they suddenly shake under his weight.
“Thanks,” Dean mumbles softly, and presses the cool cloth to his aching eyes with a hum, sinking into it.
When a sob starts to claw its way out past his throat, he rests his forehead against the cold stone.
He huddles in closer with a yawn, and Cas’s fingers resume stroking his hair. His eyelids begin to feel heavy, and Cas leans over to turn the bedside lamp off.  They nestle close together in the dark, sinking deep down into the mattress and pillows.
“You okay?” he murmurs softly in the crackling space between them, thumb and forefinger coming to grasp his chin.
Dean shuts his eyes briefly before opening them with a silent chuckle. He knows who’s there. Even before he turns around.
He can’t really even call it a gate. It’s blue skies, sloping mountains, pine trees, and open fields.
Until then, he’ll take this. The life he’s always dreamed of but was too scared to hope for. A life of love, warmth, comfort, and peace.
Dean sighs with a shrug, and turns away from Jack to look at the moon as it begins its ascent into the ink-purple sky. The moon’s glow bouncing off the clouds makes it look like it’s surrounded by a halo.
Being human sucks sometimes. He used to be able to flip on a proverbial robotic switch whenever he needed to avoid feeling, to avoid emotion, because angels were soldiers first and foremost. And because emotions were always the doorway to doubt, it was important to be able to turn them off in order to preserve the objective of the mission at hand.
Cas can’t help the worry that cloaks him as he watches Dean move. Can’t help the guilt he feels at not being able to help. He drops his shoulders then as he turns around, pouring the amber liquid into the second glass before capping the bottle and placing it back on the shelf. He feels rooted to the counter, and so he sips his scotch in an elongated pull. Avoiding.
He turns on his heel, and standing under the giant oak tree in the moonlight, about twenty five yards away, is Castiel.
When he’s finished, he slides down the wall nearest him and collapses until he’s sitting with his knees bent so he can rest his elbows there. His eyes are red-rimmed and watery, and at this point he isn’t sure if it’s from the exertion or something else. His face is covered in a sheen of sweat and he wipes his brow, catching the beads trickling down his hairline into his sleeve before they reach his eyes.
Dean groans a primal, guttural sound, rolling his eyes into the back of his head at the feel of Cas’s mouth on him: warm and slick and velvet. And he swears he’s never been more aroused in his life.
Need claws in Dean’s gut, the need to be closer, the need to have, and he reaches his fingers around Cas’s neck to pull him up.
Cas’s legs soon begin to squirm on either side of Dean’s head and Dean reaches up his free hand to rest on Cas’s thigh, thumb brushing back and forth on his skin. Dean lets off with a wet pop, but continues to stroke Cas slowly.
“Look at me,” comes the soft plea. He hates how sad Dean’s voice sounds; how guilty and rough and burdened.
“Are you...real? How-” and Dean trails off. He somehow already knows the answer. Cas squeezes his shoulder and smiles.
“I have to go,” comes the voice from behind them, and Dean whirls around to face Jack, one hand falling to his thigh and the other resting on Cas’s shoulder.
They sway somewhat in tune with the rhythm, but Dean’s a little wine drunk and accidentally  steps on Cas’s toes. More than once.
Silence settles between them, and it’s not entirely uncomfortable. But it leaves Dean too alone with his thoughts, too alone with the demons lurking in the shadows of his consciousness, waiting and poised for an ambush.
ground him. Silence surrounds them for a few moments, or maybe a few minutes. Dean doesn’t know. But he needs to say something,
Cas gently presses his fingers into the muscles of Dean’s shoulder under the neck of his shirt to examine them. His fingertips are fire on his bare skin.
“What happened?” Sam says more than asks. It’s that no-bullshit tone that Dean’s familiar with when he’s about to be interrogated. His shoulders sag as he braces for it.
He considers how Cas was there when it was born. When they all were. It still throws him for a loop even after all these years.
Dean shoots him a pointed, questioning look. Cas’s voice is so bereaved and dejected, and the quality of it jerks him back into his memory.
When he feels the tightrope that he’s been treading is about to snap, Cas’s hands are suddenly there covering his. And those hands feel like a safety net amid the raging storm in his mind. Like a soft place to land.
“Or you didn’t want to see it...or you just weren’t ready to.” Sam offers, and there he goes, kids gloves ripped off. Dean rolls his eyes and is about to reach over and throttle the guy—
They find Eileen in the kitchen by the fridge after Dean stops in his bedroom to brush his teeth and change into his loungewear. Her smile lights up the whole room when she sees him. Dean grins wide.
“I prayed to you every night in Purgatory...because you’re the only thing I’ve ever believed in. ‘Cuz leavin’ without you wasn’t an option for me. It didn’t matter if it meant bein’ stuck there for another week, or another month or another year. I didn’t want to come back here without you.”
inside of you that I haven’t seen, Dean.” Cas chokes on a broken sound as the floodgates burst. Tear tracks glisten down his cheeks.
Dean drops his gaze again to the nephilim-turned-God, and he sniffs as he kicks the dirt with the toe of his boot.
Dean’s instinct is to brush him off, to try to worm his way out of this conversation that he is not ready to have. But his head throbs, his body aches, and he feels like he’s teetering on the proverbial cliff edge.
He grips his jacket and buries his head into the green fabric, right where Castiel’s bloody handprint lays. The gentle breeze of dusk sweeps through his hair and rustles the branches high above in the towering trees, the dead leaves catching a ride in its wake.
When he pulls into the garage and cuts the engine, the silence is deafening, making his ears ring once again. He can hear his heart pounding in his ears, and it’s racing with such an intensity that he feels like it might break out of his chest.
Cas slants his chin, lips trailing on the outer shell of Dean’s ear before pressing the softest of kisses there.
It’s a little dusty, probably been here for some time. Dean lifts the guitar so that it’s a few inches from his face and blows forcefully, flecks of dust catching in the stream of sunlight that cants through the window behind his shoulder.
Dean stretches out a hand, palm face down, almost like he’s trying to calm a traumatized victim, to show that he’s not a threat.
Cas takes Dean fully into his mouth then, sucking and hollowing his cheeks greedily as he bobs up and down. He licks a hot stripe down the sensitive vein underneath, and that same guttural sound tears itself from Dean’s throat again.
He lifts his head to the harsh fluorescent lights of the garage, and blindly gropes along the wall before finding the switch, and all the lights turn off with a resounding click.
“Goodnight, Dean,” he whispers, and then makes to head to his own room. Dean is quick to grab Cas’s wrist.
“‘s fine, Cas,” Dean says, but lets himself be moved so that he’s bracing against the island. Cas reaches for the hem of Dean’s black tee, lifting it up midway to inspect the once-gaping wound in the center of his back.
-” and he reaches a hand to find a goose egg there. He scrunches his eyes shut for a second to try to clear his vision, and thankfully, he sees a little clearer upon opening.
Cas seems to melt at the contact and grips Dean tighter. Dean feels fingers card through the short strands of hair and Cas’s other hand comes up to cup the back of Dean’s head.
Dean lifts his chin, a bashful smile tugging at the corners of his mouth and eyes. He places the guitar back on the ground, letting it rest against the patio table next to him.
At first, after the dust started to settle, he wasn’t sure if he had misunderstood. If what Cas felt for him was the same as humans being in love. If it was the same desperate, craving, all-consuming love or if it was a different thing altogether for a celestial being.
He tries to breathe. Tries to do that bullshit thing Sam taught him—in for four seconds, hold for seven, exhale for eight—-and he’s surprised that he feels somewhat more grounded after a few tries, and the crushing weight on his chest becomes bearable.
They stay like that a while: listening to each other’s breathing, the crackling of the fire, the wind blowing softly around them. Crickets chirp in the distance in tandem with the calls of mockingbirds.
“Well at least I made it to Heaven,” Dean murmurs to himself. In the next moment, a familiar structure appears a few yards away.
“Can you walk?” he asks, and Dean only half-rolls his eyes with a grunt, shrugging out of Sam’s offered grip. He cups the back of his head again as the throbbing turns into jackhammering, and all the lights are too bright and the nausea settles in again.
Dean’s arms grip him in a bruising, cocooning hug. He has one arm across the span of Cas’s back and the other is wrapped high and tight around his shoulders, hand cupping the angel’s head. Dean curls his fingers into the velvet muss of black hair.
He closes his eyes at the memory before shaking his head, willing it back into compartmentalization.
He’s thought about guys in the past, sure. He’s found them attractive, found himself curious about the potential of it. But he never allowed his mind to really go there. The only time it ever happened was when Sam was in college, and Dean was too shattered drunk to remember it the next day. It was always something that was kept out of reach, something completely forbidden like the fruit in Eden, and never acknowledged. He’s repressed and shut it down so many times—hell,
They lay flush together for a moment, skin to skin, until Cas starts grinding against Dean’s throbbing erection with his own. Dean smiles and pecks Cas’s lips before motioning him to move.
It takes some time, but after a while, Dean’s heart starts to slow. His eyes adjust. He can feel the pressure in his chest begin to ease, and he’s able to breathe.
“‘s how I feel about you, you know. I’m not good with words, but..,” Dean slurs and sucks a gentle kiss into Cas’s neck. “This could totally be our song.”
Most days, he finds himself practicing in the library, with his socked feet kicked up on the table, guitar cradled against his stomach and thighs, with a glass of whiskey nearby.
The cold water seeps into his eyelids, his pores, and it feels like rain soaking the desert after a drought. Dean breathes heavy and even, and he would be perfectly happy falling asleep like this.
Dean breaks from Cas’s mouth for air, gasping and panting as he turns to face him. Cas’s hands are around his back, and then he’s flipping Dean over onto the mattress beneath him.
Dean’s heart aches, a sharp stab from somewhere underneath his rib cage. He clenches his jaw and squeezes Cas’a hand.
And, yeah. Dean doesn’t blame him. He shoves his hands into his pockets and walks the distance until he’s at Cas’s side, and that’s when he notices.
Cas’s thumb traces the line of Dean’s chin before carding his hand through Dean’s disheveled hair. He rocks minutely into Dean’s belly as he bores into blown forest-green eyes.
He feels the stifled sob before he hears it, and he pulls back gently to search Dean’s eyes as they spill over freckled cheeks.
“Liar,” she says, eyes soft and knowing. She presses her lips together into a thin smile and pats his cheek gently before rounding the island.
“In the drawer,” he mumbles softly. Dean’s hands settle on the swell of Cas’s hips, grazing circles over the bones with his thumbs as he watches Cas reach into Dean’s bedside drawer for the bottle. Cas bends down to kiss Dean soundly, tongue grazing the roof of his mouth before he parts. Dean’s heart jackhammers in his chest, and he sucks in a breath, letting it out slowly in attempt to calm his nerves. His breath hitches when he feels Cas’s hand slicking him up, but relaxes again when both hands come to caress his face.
It’s mostly healed by now; Jack had gotten Dean through the worst of it, but Cas’s stomach churns at how close it could have been to a different outcome entirely.
“It’s healing well,” Cas confirms. He removes his hands and lets Dean’s shirt fall back down, smoothing the fabric down his sides. “How does it feel?”
Whatever Dean sees in Cas’s eyes must be distressing, because he’s looking at him with such pity and sympathy and Cas feels shame creeping up his neck. He looks down at the fabric of his navy blue t-shirt, picking at an invisible piece of lint by way of distracting himself from Dean’s stare. But then he hears soft footsteps before he sees Dean’s feet approaching into his space.
“I mean. Cas comes back from the Empty, and you camp out in the garage for a couple hours?” He sounds more concerned than disappointed.
“Those things I said? I...It kills me that I ever even said ‘em,” he says, green eyes pleading into blue. “You gotta know that.”
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. He’s not used to this. Not used to the complete adoration that Cas gives him, not used to the aftercare or anything resembling this.
Missouri and Pamela sit at the table nearest to Dean and Cas, talking about when Pamela séance’d Cas after Dean was rescued from Hell.
It’s irrational, Dean knows, all of it’s irrational because one, Dad is dead, and two, he wouldn’t care, right? All John ever cared about was that Dean got the job done. The last time Dean saw him, John told him that he wanted him to have a family, to be happy. Surely it wouldn’t matter if it wasn’t with a woman. Right?
His forefinger is tracing the ‘y’ when he tries to hold his stiff upper lip, tries to conceal the raging inner battle from Dean.
“I love you,” Cas says through unshed tears lodged in his throat. And there’s such a raw sincerity and tenacity in his voice that it makes Dean’s bottom lip tremble.
“I think he was just trying to show off in front of his boyfriend,” Pamela says with a laugh as Missouri drops her face in one hand.
Dean’s eyes burn for the umpteenth time that night. He doesn’t try to hold them back as they spill over. He never knew. God, he never—
Tears cascade down Dean cheeks as he lifts his gaze to search Cas’s. The unabashed adoration he finds there makes his heart plummet leagues inside his chest.
And that’s all it takes for the winds to leave his sails. Deflated. The memory is still fresh in his mind, even after all this time. And despite Cas’s best efforts, yeah. It still stings. He lets his eyes fall to the names scratched into the mahogany of the table. He stares at them, at their initials, at Jack’s name, at his and Mary’s.
“Hey, kiddo,” Dean says, and then he winces because it’s so easy to forget. He pulls away with a grimace on his face.
Dean’s hand comes to frame Cas’s face, curling the other into a fist against his chest, and he has his eyes closed as he lets out a whimper.
“I’m good,” is all he says, and Dean twists the cap back on and pushes it to the side before taking a sip, returning the bag of veggies to the back of his head.
Cas moans around him, and the vibration of Cas’s throat against him is exquisite. He begins to thrust slowly into Cas’s mouth, and Cas takes everything Dean gives, over and over again.
When he looks at Cas through his eyelashes, Dean has to stifle a moan at the sight. Castiel looks absolutely wrecked, neck arched back, black hair flat against the headrest, panting through parted lips.
Dean heaves a heavy sigh before turning to meet Cas’s eyes again. Moss green and ethereal blue. Both hands return to the angel’s cheeks, and Dean lets his fingers stroke the strands of hair below his ears.
Dean shakes his head as he leans further back, feeling the delicious hard line of Cas’s erection against his tailbone. Cas’s lips fall naturally to Dean’s neck, and he sucks a bruise into the pulse point, tongue lavishing at the salty, freckled skin.
Dean smiles and chuckles low in his throat. “Hey Sam,” he calls over, and his little brother spins around to face Dean from where he stands next to a rack of vinyls.
But then he thinks about blue eyes, and something inside him shifts. Because it truly would be as easy as breathing, being with him. They’ve always had that connection, that bond, since Cas pulled him out of hell. It didn’t really begin to click in his head how Dean felt until he lost Cas in that reservoir all those years ago, but still. Maybe it wouldn’t be so much about unlearning a paradigm as it would be about learning to trust the fall.
As the song ends, Dean thinks maybe this could be his forever. Surrounded by family, both given and chosen; blissful in his angel’s arms. The love of his life. The one who has saved him more times than Dean can count. At utter peace knowing that Eileen will take good care of Sam, and he looks forward to the day when they can all be together once again.
Cas’s eyes widen ever so slightly, flickering his gaze from one green eye to the other before he shakes his head minutely, causing one of Dean’s hands to fall. The sigh he gives sounds like defeat.
Dean smiles, shifting to press his nose against Cas’s jaw. He smells like woodsmoke and earth before a storm. “Thanks.”
His heart is hammering against his rib cage, and his hands begin to shake. Blood roars in his ears as he wraps his other arm around his middle and rocks back and forth.
The mahogany neck with an ebony fretboard is sturdy in his grip, and Dean runs his thumb along the strings. They squeak slightly at the friction against the callus. His other hand runs over the satin sunburst wood, and he lifts the instrument so that the sound hole is a few inches from his face. He bends down and inhales deeply.
Jack’s hands rest on Dean’s shoulder blades. “I’m just fixing the mess Chuck made. All is now as it should be.”
“Hmm,” Dean agrees, eyes searching the sky for constellations he recognizes. He smiles when he finds Delphinus.
“Earlier...it wasn’t because of you. Okay? I just...I kinda spun out. I freaked out. All of my shit just came running for me all at once in different directions. And I just didn’t know what to do or how to handle it, and I just...sorta lost it.“ he trails off then, but only for a moment.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean whispers against the shell of Cas’s ear, voice thick and gruff. The warm caress of Dean’s breath chases goosebumps across Cas’s skin. “God, I’m so sorry.”
They’re wrapping up a Wendigo case in a town somewhere in upper Wyoming — Dean can’t remember the name now— when they happen upon an abandoned music shop.
When Cas doesn’t respond (which is an answer in itself, Dean supposes) he licks his lips and wrings his hands. Something to do, something to
“It really is amazing how they’re able to combine so many different flavors in this,” he tries. Because he really is
“Well, that makes two of us then,” he says and grabs Cas’s hand and pulls him to his feet. “Come on. My ‘got-dead’ party, my rules.”
Tears slip out from behind closed eyes, trailing down his cheeks. The cool air of the bunker chills the warm rivulets on his face.
“You are?” Sam blinks. “I mean, Dean...it was kinda obvious to everybody for a long time.” It’s not accusatory: is that gentle, soft, ‘confidant’ tone he uses when shit gets serious. Dean can’t decide if he hates it or takes comfort in it.
Dean just shakes his head as he rolls his rotator cuff, trying to work out the crick. “Nah, nothin’. Just my shoulder. Gettin’ old.”
Cas’s hands slowly graze the expanse of Dean’s chest, brushing over his tattoo before swirling lopsided figure-eights around his nipples, thumbs caressing them to hardness.
“Cas,” he calls out, and Cas tries his best to steel himself against the ache in his chest as he continues walking.
He wishes he could meld Dean into him then, just to envelope him completely, to shield him from everything that could hurt him the way he once could.
Dean reaches out both hands, gripping the beige covered shoulders before pulling Cas into his chest.
“Jack,” he smiles. His boots hit the ground and Dean’s striding over to envelope him in a hug. Jack’s arms come to wrap around Dean’s back, and Dean squeezes his surrogate son tightly. It’s the first time he’s able to take a cleansing breath in weeks.
Cas knocks his head back against the finished wood and anchors a hand into Dean’s hair, gripping and releasing with stunted breaths.
A soft gust of wind caresses his skin as he lets out a yawn, exhaustion creeping in. His eyes fall to the dying fire before them.
Cas blinks quizzically. “Wha-” but he trails off when Dean grazes the stubble of his cheeks with the soft pads of his thumbs.
On the exhale, he scans his eyes across the rooftop until they land on a familiar silhouette standing by the ledge. He places the object in his hand against the brick wall and steps in the direction of the ledge, letting the door clang shut behind him.
As Dean struggles for air – the impact had completely knocked the wind out of him – he gets an idea. He shoves the vamp backwards with all of his strength, his sudden movement taking it off guard for only a second, but it’s long enough. Dean grips its shoulders and flips the pair of them so that its back is facing the wall. Dean rams his body against the vamp, pushing it backwards until it makes contact with the wall, right where the rebar is sticking out. By the terrible squelching sound, Dean knows that the metal has met its intended target. Now incapacitated, Dean easily finishes the vamp off – “Eighteen!” – before rejoining Cas and Sam.
In his head, he sees Cas’ earnest, tearful face, so vividly it feels like the image has been seared onto the backs of his eyelids. He hears
But now . . . now Dean is standing in a large, bright kitchen with miles of counter space, complete with a freakin’ island in the middle of it all. And the kicker is that it’s
“Oh, don’t get us started on the garden,” Florence says with a light laugh. “You’ll be here all day.”
The next nine months are hectic, filled with helping Sam and Eileen move into their house and prepare for the baby. Dean finds great enjoyment in whipping up all sorts of new recipes for Eileen to try when her pregnancy cravings hit, and Cas takes up crocheting, making adorable (if slightly misshapen) little hats and socks for when the baby arrives.
“Yeah, yeah. I know,” Dean says, trying to sound nonchalant. “But you’ll call me if you ever need help with anything, you hear? I don’t want to just drop everything completely. I can still help with research and stuff like that over the phone.”
kitchen, in his and Cas’ home in the Vermont countryside. (Dean supposes that it’s technically his and Cas’ kitchen, since it’s his and Cas’ house, but Cas is kind of hopeless at cooking and tends to avoid it unless he’s stealing bites of what Dean is making. So, really, it’s Dean’s kitchen.)
Dean opens his eyes slowly and meets Cas’ own, bright even in the darkness of the bedroom. There’s a small wrinkle in his brow; he looks hesitant, apprehensive, almost like he’s worried to hear Dean’s answer.
They come out pretty perfectly, if Dean does say so himself, and he feels a rare sense of accomplishment as he pulls them out of the oven.
Cas grumbles slightly in his sleep, the quiet noise pulling Dean from his musings. He turns and looks down at Cas, at his open, peaceful expression and his hopelessly rumpled bedhead, and Dean’s heart just about bursts in his chest. Cas reaches his hand out towards Dean’s side of the bed, seemingly searching for something. He eventually finds Dean’s pillow and pulls it closer to him, burying his face in it before falling back into deeper sleep. Dean thinks his heart may actually burst, then.
“Purple hyacinth,” Cas says quietly, though that doesn’t really explain anything. “It means ‘I am sorry, please forgive me.’”
“We left you both a little housewarming gift,” says Arthur with a warm smile. “It’s sitting right on the kitchen island.”
And that’s probably the crux of this whole thing, if Dean’s being honest with himself. He hates to see Cas hurt, of course, but it’s more than that. He wants Cas around
Dean’s body feels better than it has in years. He looks down at his hands and is amazed to see that they’re smooth and strong, no longer wrinkled. His knees don’t ache; his joints don’t hurt. He takes full advantage of it, jogging until he reaches the house.
It seems silly, but the one thing Cas isn’t able to grow is a sweet pea plant. Cas informs him (in a very frustrated tone of voice) that in all of the books he’s read, they say that it should be an easy flower to grow. Cas tries year after year, however, and it never sprouts. But Cas is nothing if not determined, and Dean knows that he’ll keep trying every year, tweaking the soil type and adjusting the watering schedule, until he gets it right.
, like he was meant to find his way here all along, like some wayward puzzle piece has finally been slotted into place.
Without breaking their hold on each other, he and Cas charge at it. It goes for Dean first, and Dean ducks out of the way, aiming a swipe at it and managing to graze its thigh. Cas takes the opportunity to come at it from the side, taking off its head in a single stroke.
Dean holds the notebook tightly against his chest, tears streaming down his face, and isn’t afraid to die.
“Thank you for coming to get me, Dean,” Cas says, sincerity dripping from his words, his chest rumbling as he speaks. Dean feels it all the way through his body and down to his toes.
That’s the thing though, Dean thinks, gazing out of the windshield at the familiar landscape that honestly hasn’t changed much since he left. It doesn’t feel like they’re driving
“Aren’t you guys supposed to be, like –” Sam says, shoving a vampire into the wall and swiftly decapitating it, “I don’t know – three! – holding hands or something?”
Sam just huffs a small laugh, like he knew Dean would react like this. “Look, I know you didn’t mean it literally, that it’s just something people say when they lose someone. I know. But that emptiness that you feel now that he’s gone, doesn’t that feel real?”
Dean feels his eyes widen. He pushes himself up onto his forearms, staring down at Cas incredulously. Cas simply folds his hands over his stomach and keeps his eyes on the stars.
Dean scoops out some of the batter with a ladle and carefully pours it into the pan, the batter spreading out slowly to form a circle. The sizzle of the batter when it makes contact with the hot butter in the pan sends a wave of nostalgia through Dean 𑁋 the sound feels as familiar as the feel of Cas’ hand in his own, as familiar as home. Dean grabs the bowl of blueberries and focuses on plopping them one at a time into the pancake, pushing them gently into the partially cooked batter with his finger.
“You may not have as much hair as you used to,” Cas says eventually, stroking Dean’s cheek with gentle fingers, “but to me, you are still the most splendid being I have ever laid my eyes on.” Cas smiles at him, his eyes crinkling in the outer corners, the way Dean has always been fond of.
Dean looks around him, taking in how the soft light that filters in through the window above the sink adds to the pleasant feeling of warmth and cheerfulness that always seems to permeate the home. He glances to his left at the stairs that lead up to his and Cas’ shared bedroom, unable to help the small smile that tugs on his lips as he thinks of Cas sleeping up there, safe and sound and content. He thinks about how they don’t have any plans for the rest of the day, no guests to host and certainly no monsters to fight, and they could damn well spend the entire day in bed together if they wanted to.
At the mention of food, Cas sits up, rubbing at his eyes and yawning. Something breaks in Dean’s chest a bit as he looks at Cas, all bleary-eyed and exhausted and perfect. He doesn’t know what emotion he’s broadcasting on his face, but Cas is gazing at him now with such a quiet, tender smile that he assumes he looks like a complete fool. A fool who’s ridiculously in love, that is. Dean feels his neck and cheeks heat and busies himself with the food.
Well, as properly as he can, given the fact that they’re currently fighting off a hoard of vampires.
Cas is still smiling at him, that wonderful, crinkly-eyed smile, when they pull apart. He says, “Even if we had been parted in death, I would have crossed the universe to find you.”
“Oh?” Cas says, setting a cup of coffee down in front of him with a raised eyebrow. Dean smiles his thanks, wrapping his cold hands gratefully around the warm mug.
“Dean!” Cas shouts in concern, but he’s currently occupied with his own vampire. Dean glances quickly over to Sam, who’s currently occupied with two. The vamp
He walks for hours – days? – months? – all of eternity? – before he finally finds him. He feels Cas rather than sees him, at first. Dean senses his presence all around him, he smells and hears and tastes him, before he blinks hard and then Cas has coalesced in front of him, seemingly out of nothing, trench coat and all. He is lying horizontally, his eyes closed as if in a deep sleep, and he looks so beautiful that Dean can’t breathe.
Cas’ face breaks into a smile that almost blinds Dean; it’s so bright. His watery eyes crinkle at the corners and all of his teeth are showing and he looks so happy that Dean has to lean in and kiss him again, just to know what that smile tastes like.
Cas presses a kiss to Dean’s forehead, and it is gentle, so gentle, and almost unbearably tender. He says, “Let’s eat, then.”
“I know my time is coming soon, Cas. But I’m –” Dean’s voice cuts out, his throat suddenly too tight to speak. He takes a deep breath, trying to gather himself.
Dean’s eyes find the antique vase sitting on Cas’ bedside table, a gift he had given Cas a few months back. (Cas had beamed when Dean had handed it over to him and immediately went out to clip a bundle of delicate pink flowers to fill it with. The memory is a fond one, and Dean keeps it close to his heart.) Now, the vase bursts with the vibrant purple of the violets that Cas had recently placed inside. It was yesterday afternoon, actually; Dean had wandered outside to let Cas know lunch was ready, and he had found Cas 𑁋 unsurprisingly 𑁋 in the front garden, a bunch of purple blossoms in his arms. He had told Dean over their lunch that they were violets, and that they are often said to symbolize devotion and peace.
“I had the weirdest dream last night,” Dean announces as he makes his way downstairs one winter morning, muffling a yawn with the back of his hand.
“Cas, behind you!” Sam calls, breaking the moment. Cas spins on the spot, swinging his knife out and decapitating the vamp in one clean, powerful stroke.
And, well, Dean isn’t going to complain if that’s the direction Cas wants to take their night in. It’s the direction
“Well,” Cas says after a few beats of silence, “should we head inside?” He beams at Dean with shining eyes, excitement practically radiating off of him.
“Please,” Florence says, stepping back and gesturing towards the door, “feel free to take a look around. Arthur and I’ll be right here if you have any questions about the house.”
Dean glances over at Cas. He’s leaning out of the window, head tilted up towards the sky, a small, content smile settled on his lips. In the moonlight, Dean can see the fading bruises along Cas’ jaw that he’d acquired during the very hunt that prompted this trip to Vermont in the first place.
