“Later,” Steve said, meaning to be self-conscious because they were talking about him masturbating—but flinching instead as Tony brushed over another ticklish area. He saw a flash of amusement in Tony’s expression. He
“Besides, I don’t know that I even want to be part of your secret society anymore.  Are there cool handshakes involved?  Do I get my own key to the clubhouse—”
, he wants to ask, but it’s not actually ludicrous that Steve would want to leave his room. The whole house reeks of the potential for sex, but Tony had eaten breakfast here this morning, so Steve can’t be too far along.
“Mr. Stark is ready for you now, Mr. Rogers,” JARVIS said, and Steve was out the door before he’d finished saying his name.
“I’m going to bring the car up,” Happy says, and Tony nods, signing the last of his discharge papers.
At the rate he was going before, most of his tentacles were lower than the Angel, his body at somewhat of an angle to the water line while the Angel’s floated. Going faster means he's flattened out a bit to make himself more streamlined, and his tentacles rub against his Angel’s legs over and over again.
,” he says, but it’s not, because there’s a sudden breeze against the wet skin on the back of Steve’s buttocks, and it only takes him a second to realize it’s because he’s drawn his legs up so far to hide his erection that he’s exposing his ass to the room. He hurriedly drops his knees back down to the leather, just barely managing to grab the sheet before it falls to the floor, and he clutches it protectively over his groin, looking anywhere but at Dr. Stark.
. The words were teasing and condescending, and why wouldn’t they be? They were given to Steve when he was dressed up like a dog for performing the trick of being still, and even as a wave of humiliation flooded through him, Steve wanted Tony to say them again. Again and again until they were true because it wasn’t enough that Steve was trying. He just wanted to
I feel so accomplished! Look how much writing I'm getting in! Hopefully, you guys like Tony a little better after this chapter. >_>
“Tony,” she said, covering his hand with her own. “I hate to tell you this, but you are not a subtle person. You’ve done everything but write it across the sky. If he doesn’t know, it’s because he’s purposefully being blind.”
Steve wasn’t up there with them, but he and the Avengers who were currently on Earth were all in the front row, and he knew that, like him, they were probably all wondering what the best way to handle this was because there was no way that could actually be Tony. It had to be a doppelganger of some kind, intent on using Tony’s memory to insinuate himself into their world and try to take over.
was a playboy? The last person Steve had kissed had been Sharon, and they hadn’t even gone on a date before deciding to end things because of everything that was going on.
He didn’t know what he would’ve done if Tony had tried, how he would’ve reacted, and Tony hadn’t actually done anything, so maybe it didn’t matter—but what if Tony wanted to?
He would’ve said as much, brought up once again that he’d intended it to be a reward as well but that that it’d seemed more like suffering from where he’d been standing … but the thought of putting together that many words was overwhelming. “You wanted to stop,” he said instead, forcing himself to make the effort.
Tony tilted his head, assessing. “This is what you’re going to do. I want you on your knees, head and chest on the ottoman, head pointed towards the door.”
“I’m sorry, I …” He trailed off, rubbing his hand over his face—dropping it when he realized how unsteady it was. “What did you say?”
He definitely hadn’t expected him to look calm, relaxed almost, a tightness gone from around his eyes and mouth.
Tony helped Steve roll on his left side, his insides churning, little shivers starting to run through his body by the time he was finally situated to Tony’s satisfaction.
Tony was already so cautious around him. He’d only just started initiating any kind of affectionate behavior in public instead of waiting for Steve to make the first move. Tony didn’t demand anything, rarely even asked, and Steve knew he was just trying to be considerate, but rather than reassure him, it had the opposite effect of making Steve feel like he was walking on eggshells.
Steve followed Tony, glad he was behind him. He hadn’t quite been able to look Tony in the eyes since he’d gotten out of the bathroom, wasn’t sure how long it’d be before he could without turning bright red all over.
Oh, alright, maybe not that bad, but stress could trigger a heat; too many Alpha pheromones could trigger a heat; not
“I can’t, Sweetheart, not with the blockers,” Tony moans, thrusting harder as if to make up for it, deep and punishing, and Steve cries out loudly at the change, his lower body aching and sore. He comes before the disappointment can fully hit, pleasure bursting through him and wiping his thoughts clean of anything that isn’t Tony’s cock and what it’s doing to him, and he shakes and jerks, unable to control his body as Tony takes him apart.
“Are you sure?  Because I wouldn’t want to do anything that hasn’t been backed up with thorough testing.”  He could just feel Tony’s earnest gaze on him.  “It’s my life we’re talking about here.  I’m rather attached to it.”
“Well, it’s—it’s not one of those things you keep a tally of,” he said, his back flexing as Tony went over the exact spot he’d found before. Was Tony doing that on purpose?
“When I first agreed to contract with you, being an Avenger was the carrot Fury dangled in front of me, but it wasn’t the reason I agreed. I’d grown up with you all my life,” he said, smiling weakly, “and I couldn’t let that go, no matter how much you hated me for it.”
for the beta! Cap went above and beyond the call of duty by reading all of Nostalgia first in order to beta this chapter. I know, wtf, she’s amazing.
(He wondered sometimes if Pepper ever suspected he had feelings for Tony, but she never brought it up and neither did he.)
“Go eat,” Tony said without looking away from what he was doing. Less than a week ago, he would’ve stopped, would’ve kept Steve company, because Tony believed they should eat their meals together when they were home, would’ve look at Steve with affection and told him funny stories to make him laugh, and Steve hadn’t considered any of it when he’d decided to not call Tony.
“No, wait. Just listen for a sec,” Tony said, as if he knew what Steve had been planning to say, which would’ve been impressive since
Nick had been so angry at the army-assigned Negotiator when he’d found out Steve had been told about Peggy before they’d even gotten her consent.  Nick had kicked him out and taken over the position personally, but by then, it had already been too late.
“Ah, ah, ah. If you can’t come like this, I don’t know that you really deserve to,” Tony said, his hand on Steve’s hip firm, and Steve let out a strangled sound when Tony started following the curve of where the shaft met the head of his cock, round and round, paying extra attention to the underside each time he passed until Steve thought he was going to go crazy.
Steve had assumed that since they weren’t going to be in Tony’s office that he wouldn’t need either a heat pad or the dance belt; take away the stimulus and he wouldn’t have a reaction, that just made sense, right?
He’d already had what felt like an eternity to figure out what he should’ve said, the things he should’ve done, and all the fear, all the what-ifs didn’t matter. There was just one answer.
Try as he might though, Steve couldn’t stop himself from eventually asking, “Stripper poles?  Really?”
But Tony wouldn’t, he knew. Tony never did, Steve realized. He always made excuses for Steve instead, because of his past maybe, or because of being Captain America, or perhaps just because he could see how broken Steve truly was.
an explanation, that he hadn’t taken one look and decided he couldn’t have a Dom who’d let himself be beaten—
“Great, thanks.” Dr. Stark gives him a smile that’s worth whatever embarrassment Steve has suffered up until this point and sends a pulse of arousal through his body, which, okay, damn it, that’s no good, and Steve’s just going to stare down at the buttons of his shirt—
Flying with Stark was chaos and cold, fear and exhilaration. It was seeing the blur of lights as they raced past and feeling the heavy push of air trying to tear him away. Stark had given him a helmet, saying he’d be grateful for it once they were up in the air. Steve did appreciate the protection from the wind, but he was still tempted to take it off, to feel the biting rush against his face.
Tony winces. “Um … well. Some omega-specific … procedures. Would you like another coffee? I’m going to get a—”
So he hadn’t been in love with Tony. But the possibility of it, the ache of wanting what Steve couldn’t have, had definitely been there.
, Steve has had a few … hazy … ish … thoughts about him since, but that couldn’t be enough to trigger anything.
He tried to control his breathing, chest heaving with effort, and wiped harshly at his eyes. He had to, had to do at least this much, had to be at least this good for Tony—even though he kept promising himself that he would be, even though the bar kept dropping lower and lower because he couldn’t be good, even for Tony, especially for Tony—when it was probably the last thing Tony would ever ask from him.
He’d never felt anything like it, and it was incredibly tempting to let himself get swept up by it all. He wanted to come so badly that the thought of stopping was maddening, but he had to be pragmatic. He knew intercourse was going to hurt, but it was a question of how much, and maybe being this excited when they started would make the rest of it go a little easier.
He cupped his hand, bringing it to his mouth and huffed into it, quickly breathing it in. He couldn’t actually tell if he had bad breath or not, but better to be safe than sorry, he thought, and hurried to his room.
him like he wasn’t even there. He was vaguely surprised by the irritation that crept up on him at the thought.
They decide to meet up for coffee not too far from Dr—er, Tony’s office. It’s a low-key first date, which Steve is grateful for considering the circumstances around all their previous interactions.
“I’d forgotten how much you need it,” Tony said in a tone Steve didn’t understand, but that wasn’t why—
“Maybe kinky is too mild a word,” says an unbearably cheerful voice, and Steve tilts his head toward the sound, whimpering when that sends fiery lances of pain through his brain.
Tony was facing the door when Steve entered the room, his tail wagging and ears perked up. He started bounding up to him, but as he got closer, he stopped, his ears going back, his lips curling in a way that conveyed more confusion than anger.
“Can we—” He turned slightly, pressing his back against the couch in order to focus. “I want to talk about this,” he said, struggling to get every word out, his voice sounding tinny to his own ears. “But I can’t. Right now. Can we—?”
Besides, it wasn’t as if he didn’t have anything to keep him occupied, he thought, looking at Tony. He’d never seen him naked before, which seemed like a shame now that he had the opportunity, because Tony was very handsome.
He shook his head rapidly, unable to talk, because if he let even so much as one sound past his lips, he wouldn’t be able to stop any of them. He didn’t want that. He didn’t.
And other than occasionally muttering at JARVIS and taking a couple of hours in the afternoon during which Steve would hear blasts of music or the odd crash from somewhere around the penthouse, Stark had taken a week away from everything in order to be available to Steve—a week, and Stark hadn’t indicated he expected anything to change in the near future.
His eyes skipped away for just a second, but inwardly he sighed; she’d probably caught that. “Sometimes.”
“It will. Dr. Strange is worried that being a wolf isn’t good for you, that if he spends too much time looking for an alternate cure, it’ll make things more difficult in the long run.”
—” The machine lurched as he jerked his body to the side to avoid Tony’s questing fingers, and while Steve hadn’t meant for that to happen, it at least made Tony stop trying to release him.
“Here, let me take that for you,” Dr. Stark says kindly, and Steve hands his shirt over to go with his other clothes in one of the two chairs in the room, nodding his thanks because his voice seems to have left him. “Actually, I’ve got a hanger in my office. I’ll be right back.”
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve said, and he wondered if Tony was smelling the lube Steve had used to get himself ready. His face burned at the thought, and he didn’t mean to clench up, but he could feel some leaking out in response. Fuck. He’d hurried the best he could since time was of the essence, and he probably hadn’t prepped enough for it to be comfortable, but it’d get the job done.
Except all Tony seemed to want was to use him like a human blanket. It took all of Steve’s willpower not to say something. He had to remind himself that the night wasn’t just about him. Tony wanted this; Tony had plans. And if he were being honest, he wanted to go along with Tony’s plans.
He didn’t like having to let go of one of Tony’s hands in order to walk, but he knew he was being ridiculous. He felt … clingy, which he obviously wasn’t going to mention to Tony, but it was true nonetheless. It was the second time he was going to be punished, and he was anxious about the discipline itself as well as the possibility of screwing it up again. Holding onto Tony and basking in his voice and smile was incredibly comforting, and while Steve knew he didn’t deserve it, he couldn’t help but want it all the same.
“Who wants to be normal?” Tony asked, taking a large drink of what Steve knew was not his first coffee of the morning.  He shuddered to think how much caffeine was flowing through his bloodstream.
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked, his tone becoming sharper, demanding, and that didn’t help things at all. “Are you hurt?” Tony asked, his fingers moving upward before Steve could say he was fine, that it was nothing—
Tony’s eyes searched his, and Steve didn’t know what he was looking for, what Tony thought he’d discover under all the layers of suspicion and guilt and faithlessness, but he knew Tony hadn’t found it when he sighed quietly, long and drawn out, the lines in his face deeper and more ragged than they’d been even an hour ago. Steve remembered being hopeful at how relaxed Tony had looked before Steve had fucked it up all over again, again and again and again, and he felt stupid and small and ignorant.
“Tony,” he whispered, and even though the bottoms of his arms were technically free, as were his legs, he felt weak, trapped, as if his body couldn’t move at all.
He speeds up just a little and changes the tempo of his alternating thrusts so there’s overlap now, moments when both hectocotyli are pushing into Steve and not just one, and he can tell Steve likes that, because his breath comes faster every time it happens, and he leaks more fluid around the tentacle in his cock.
“Please,” he says when Tony hesitates, his eyes searching Steve’s, and Steve doesn’t realize he’s holding his breath until it escapes in a rush as Tony begins to smile.
He didn’t know what had been going through Tony’s mind afterwards, but it hadn’t been good. Steve could imagine Tony doubting the sincerity of his feelings, seeing it as a last-ditch effort to keep Tony from kicking him out, both then and now.
Steve doesn’t mean to, but he does think about it, and it makes his heart start beating faster at the very possibility.
Steve felt as if he was coming out of a daze as he finished the letter.  He had the oddest sense of familiarity, as if he’d read these words before, time and time again.  It made no sense, but he couldn’t shake the feeling, nor the creeping certainty that Anthony Stark had never made it back home, his ship lost at sea while his lover waited for him.
“Pffft, you think they aren’t used to this by now?  Where do you think I got it from in the first place?”
It really was a lot. On a different day, Steve might have been embarrassed by the amount, but there was something fascinating about seeing how it coated Tony’s skin, the way it dripped between his fingers and down the back of his hand, and Steve stared as it began to slide along his wrist.
Every month, Tony pays an exorbitant fee to an extremely discrete company that makes sure he is never without companionship when he wants it.
He’d hoped to avoid doing it tonight, but he’d been a slave to his body’s demands his whole life, and that hadn’t changed even after the serum.
“I think we should get married,” Tony announced as he let himself into Steve’s apartment, plopping next to him on the couch.
He shrugged uncomfortably, wanting to pull away, wanting to shut his ears and ignore her, but it was like he was frozen to his seat.
“That’s—that’s fine,” Steve tells him, feeling embarrassed and inexplicably guilty that Dr. Stark felt the need to explain, as if he’d heard Steve’s thoughts, even though Steve hadn’t meant anything by them. He trusts Dr. Stark; of course he trusts him. He knows there’s a valid reason for everything Dr. Stark does. He wouldn’t be here if he didn’t.
“What are you doing?” Tony grits out as Steve kneels next to him, talking into a little radio that Tony really wants to get a closer look at, although maybe not right this second, the wound like another heartbeat in his shoulder, pulsing and pulsing.  He’s putting as much pressure on it as possible, and perhaps he’s biased against watching his blood run through his fingers, but it doesn’t look good.
considering Steve had gotten lost in X-rated fantasies instead of paying attention to what Dr. Stark had been doing, and he has no one to blame but himself that he’s in this situation.
thick. Tony doesn’t think he’s ever seen thighs this large, and they get quite a number of Human visitors that are part of their military.
that someone needs to have sex with Tony,” Dr. Strange told him, sounding annoyed that he had to repeat himself, as if Tony weren’t currently a wolf, standing six feet tall at the shoulder. A little bit of clarification wasn’t too much to ask for.
“C’mon, Pepper,” he said, widening his eyes pitifully. “I feel like I just had back-to-back scenes with three Doms and their pet gimp, and all I want is to have a warm washcloth for my head and the entire contents of that bottle of Advil, is that really too much to ask?”
And although Dick would never say this out loud, Bruce could also count on Clark not dying before him, and he thought that went a long way to helping Bruce lower all his carefully-erected walls.
She—well, Clint—shrugged.  “It’s not anything I haven’t seen before,” she said, making Thor (Steve) blush and Steve (Clint) grin in a way that just looked weird on Steve’s face.
Besides, Stark already knew everything he needed to know about Steve. His past was laid out in the file SHIELD had given Stark, reams of paper detailing his health pre- and post-Serum, the experiment itself, his capabilities, and everything that had happened to him during the war. And after as well. Stark probably even had access to the other file as well, the one that covered his mandatory meetings with therapist after therapist, that tossed around terms like “post-traumatic stress disorder” and “survivor’s guilt” like they were nothing. What could Steve possibly tell him that he didn’t already have at his fingertips?
When Tony had asked him to move in with him, he’d been so happy.  It was a big step, and they’d only known each other for three months, but it felt
“Excellent. And how are you adjusting to being in a contract? I know it can be stressful at first, being in a new situation.”
He let his arms curl around Bruce, pulling him close and cradling him like he’d wanted to for months, let his lips experience the lushness of Bruce’s, let his tongue taste and explore. He gave himself permission to feel what it would be like to have Bruce for real, and even knowing how much it’d hurt him afterwards, he couldn’t regret it.
“Just until tomorrow. I already have an idea that might work, but I need to think about it a little more, so if you don’t mind, I’m going to spend some time in my study to figure out the details. You can come get me if you need anything, anything at all, but it shouldn’t be more than a couple of hours, and I should be done in time for lunch.”
man, the edge of the sheet clinging to his lap in a way that should frankly be illegal.  Steve’s fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth thoughts are pretty much variations of the word “naked” over and over again.
He looked away, wishing he had an answer, but what was there to say? He’d do the best he could, even though he knew his best wouldn’t be good enough. It was what he was doing now, after all.
Tony had planned to say more, but he found the words frozen on his tongue as he watched Steve try to take what he wanted. He wondered if Steve was going to feel the burn from this later, or if Steve fucked himself enough in the privacy of his own room that he’d barely notice . . . and that thought was not very conducive to staying clear headed, fuck.
Steve forced away the memories and devoted himself to finding the right angle to make Tony shudder and gasp, to stroking him just the way Tony liked and bringing him so much pleasure that Tony could start to forget all the pain.
“Okay,” Tony said, and his mouth quirked at the corner, but it wasn’t happy, more resigned than anything, and Steve didn’t—what had he done? How had he managed to fuck it up all over again—
Steve had never been the type of guy to give up on something, even when it was a hopeless case.  So he took these stolen moments and savored them, even if they resembled something like torture, and he let himself get talked into doing one crazy stunt after another simply because Tony asked him to.  Because he always wanted to be the one Tony turned to, be the reason Tony lit up with happiness, and Steve couldn’t even bring himself to care that his heart ached that much more every time it happened.  Even a little bit was better than nothing at all.
“I didn’t say it did,” Steve said, and he swallowed, trying to clear his throat, trying to stop staring at Stark’s fingers around his wrist.
“What about you?” Steve asked, getting up off his stool. He took the rest of Tony’s sandwich and put it back on the plate, holding on to it while he reached out with his free hand, and when Tony only watched it, he carefully took hold of Tony’s wrist. “Shouldn’t you go to bed too?”
Steve had been ready to be beaten until he could barely walk, had considered the idea of falling at Tony’s feet from pain as something approaching justice. Acting like Tony’s pet was nowhere in the same ballpark and not something he would’ve ever thought of to make up for hurting Tony the way he had, but … Tony had obviously put a lot of thought into everything, and if this was what Tony wanted …
“Look, I’m sure you’re all familiar with Beauty and the Beast, right? The prince does something to offend the evil fairy—”
, to go back to the way he’d been a week ago when he’d see Steve and visibly brighten instead of tensing up the way he did now, as if he were preparing for a fight.
The smile on Tony’s face was the widest Steve had seen since before he’d left on his mission. It was obvious that Tony knew exactly what he was thinking, which probably should have mattered more to Steve, but how could it when Tony looked that happy? It left him dazed enough that he didn’t react when Tony moved behind him, but the click of what had to presumably be the lube bottle made him jump.
“Take everything off, and then get on the bed, face down,” Tony said, stepping back and intending to use the time it took for Steve to undress to dredge up some semblance of control—except Steve took all of ten seconds to get naked and climb on the bed, and there went that idea.
The subsequent wave of shame that crashes into him is immense, and Steve knows it’s not actually true, that he didn’t purposefully come to the office to fulfill some sordid fantasy, but that’s what it feels like when he’s this close. He can’t say anything, but he can’t let things keep going either, no matter that he doesn’t want to stop. He’s already been unwittingly edged once, and what he wants to do is pinch his nipples, which are still tingling, fuck, while Dr. Stark takes him apart.
Thus, Bonded Omegas were safe, because even Tony wasn’t vain enough to think a person would try to get out of a Bond just to be with him.  Now, they might fantasize about him in order to add some excitement into their hum-drum love lives, but well, who could blame them?
“No can do right now.  Big project, deadline, clock’s ticking and all that.  Just going to grab something and head back to my lab.”
No. That way lay madness, and Steve couldn’t let himself hope like that when he knew better. If anything, he should be furious like Peter was. There had to be a reason that it was here
Steve has to bite his lip when he hears the snap of a glove. “Mmhmm,” he murmurs, and he thinks he hates and loves the drape in equal measure because just the thought of Dr. Stark putting on the gloves is enough to get him breathing faster, but he doesn’t know if his self-control could have withstood the actual sight.
“You could’ve helped,” he said, dragging all four inside before going back for the patrol they’d taken out earlier. He piled them all together.
“Finished?” Tony asked, and the way he immediately abandoned his own plate told Steve he’d been eating mostly to keep him company rather than due to hunger.
“You want to put a stranger in a room with someone who’s just been transformed into a nearly 300 lb wolf and is probably scared and confused and turning more and more feral with each passing second?”
He doesn’t mean to stare up at Dr. Stark, but he can’t seem to tear his eyes away as Dr. Stark … as he … as his
Unfortunately, however, there was a reason he’d been holding his phone, and now that he’d been reminded, he couldn’t afford to stand around anymore. No matter how much he wanted to.
He honestly hadn’t thought about wearing Tony’s collar much, maybe once or twice the whole time he’d known him, and even then, only as an abstract, far-into-the-future type of thing. He’d never thought about it in terms of months or years even, just … one day. Maybe one day Tony would offer. And maybe one day Steve would accept.
But the larger part was resigned to hearing every one of his mistakes, his failings, knew that he’d dwell on them again and again in the days ahead, knew he owed Steve his pound of flesh.
It’s just incredibly intimate. And sure, so is sex of course, but scenting implies permanence to a certain extent, the desire to memorize how someone smells, to wear that scent on his own skin as a sign that he’s taken, and yes, Steve’s basically naked, but it’s somehow more revealing to let Tony know Steve’s dying to scent him than it is to remove the towel.
Shirokou on tumblr asked for: Good Morning! *wave* Um, if you’re looking for a prompt, maybe Steve/Tony with Steve as a florist. Tony goes to pick up a “Get Well” bouquet for Pepper or Rhodey, and he keeps going back for more flowers since Steve is cute.
Then the tentacles around his thighs throw being respectful to the wind, and they find another hole that’s not only slick with something that tastes even more delectable than Steve’s thighs but is also warm and snug and perfect, and they try to force each other out and cram as much of themselves inside as possible while Steve shakes and cries out against Tony’s lips, helpless little “uh, uh, uh” sounds that make Tony’s head spin.
At first, Steve wasn’t quite sure what he meant. Ask him to do what? Put him on his knees? Choke him? The thought of asking made him fidget—because he was uncomfortable with Tony’s request, he told himself—and he didn’t know if he could do it, even as a sharp ache of want started to build in his chest.
“Although you realize you’ve set my expectations incredibly high now, right? Hands and knees,” he told Steve, because the headboard definitely needed to be replaced. Tony moved with him so he wouldn’t accidentally pull out, and Steve shifting around him was already making things a lot firmer. “I’m going to be disappointed if you don’t come that fast every time.”
His fingers tightened around the gown, and he stared down at it, teeth gritting together, trying to ignore the betrayal that started building within him.
angry.  It’s not like it was ever real considering he’d been paying Steve to spend time with him, and in the end, Steve
Just like with all the other deaths, the feeling of connection between the two of them was there, but it was magnified somehow with this guy.  Like they were linked together.  Like it was meant to be.
“Too much?” Tony asked solicitously, and Steve shook his head, even though he couldn’t decide if it was the truth or not.
There was a brief silence. “Is he usually not polite? Because he’s always been polite whenever I’ve been around.”
“I mean, it wasn’t a bad ‘I see.’ More of a confused ‘I see,’ so really not an ‘I see’ so much as a ‘I don’t see at all.’”
“Thank you for having me. And please.” Dick could feel some of his nerves settle at how open and warm her smile was. “Call me Martha.”
As soon as the door closes, he gets undressed, hiding the dance belt he specifically bought for this in his jeans and then detaching his heat pad as quietly as possible before wrapping it in paper towels and throwing it into the biohazard waste. He can’t believe he has to wear a pad to his checkup, but he would literally leak through his clothes otherwise.
It had been so tempting to lie in that moment, to extend the truth just enough to push aside any new doubt … but then he’d come to his senses, shame filling him for even considering that as an option. It had been hard to be completely honest, but it would’ve been unforgiveable if he hadn’t.
sorry,” Steve says in the silence that follows because what else is there to say? Steve’s always been like this, but he’s never been like
Tony sighs again, and the annoyance on his face makes him almost unrecognizable. He’s never looked at Steve like that before, has always been sweet and kind, and Steve has the creeping thought that he wasn’t being kind to
He would, though, he thought, pulling ingredients out of the refrigerator. He’d show Tony that he could put his faith in him.
He very carefully doesn’t stare at what Dr. Stark’s hands are doing and takes a deep breath in through his nose—only to get a lungful of the heavy, sweet scent of his slick, which is drowning the room in his arousal.
It doesn’t help, though, not when as soon as Dr. Stark touches one, Steve nearly arches off the table and lets out a choked gasp. He’s always had sensitive nipples, but they’ve never been
Fandral referred to Loki as his “Blue Boy,” which, considering how long they’ve been at war with Jotunheim, was far kinder than Thor had any reason to expect.
“And as I’ve already said, it’s not uncommon for patients to exhibit signs of arousal during an exam. No one talks about it, but it happens a lot more frequently than you’d think. I personally know one couple that got together when the omega went into heat on the table, and I’ve heard of a half-dozen more. Alright, I’m not seeing any signs of discharge so far,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve wishes he’d looked away before Dr. Stark had turned his head, because meeting Dr. Stark’s eyes is a mistake.
Steve’s mouth tightened—no, Captain America, Captain America, damn it.  Steve was someone he’d consider taking home, but Captain America was an icon, a very non-geriatric icon even though he was like a gazillion years old and had pecs a man could bounce quarters off of, and shit, he was seriously considering this, wasn’t he?
He finished cleaning and woke up the computer Stark had given him access to. He’d already spent hours on it that day, but the whole past week, he and Stark had watched movies or played video games together after dinner, and he didn’t feel up to either activity at the moment.
“You always were my favorite,” Tony gasped, his lips twitching into a small smile as he reached up and touched Steve’s face.  Then Tony’s eyes closed, his hand falling away.
“I was thinking that I didn’t want to be shot or imprisoned while you guys conducted all sorts of invasive, illegal, and quite likely uncomfortable tests,” the thing that wore Tony’s face told her, but it didn’t look upset. The expression on hi—its face was soft. Amused. Affectionate almost, and Steve realized that he couldn’t look into its eyes and somehow just
Of course, he didn’t feeling quite so charitable about SHIELD a few days later when Steve told him he had a three-day mission less than a week into their arrangement.
“Yes, Sir,” JARVIS replied before Steve could gather his thoughts and tell him he’d gotten breakfast ready.
He quickly diverted his thoughts, because as he’d learned early on, thoughts of what had happened and walking around in public didn’t go well together.
“Neither does lying here on the ground with you pinning me down, because you’re stronger than I am. I don’t stop being who I am when I choose to submit to someone else, because that’s what my submission is: a choice,” he said, tightening his grip enough that Steve finally had to look up into his eyes. “You being able to force me to the ground doesn’t mean that I submit, and it sure as hell doesn’t mean—”
?” Tony demanded, wanting to reach out and shake Fury, although he wasn’t actually stupid enough to try.  “That’s
He knew that for Tony, flirting was like breathing, something done unthinkingly but necessary for survival.  He’d seen Tony flirt with people he’d just met, people he’d known since childhood, people he didn’t even particularly
“What are you—I don’t want your money!” Steve says, scrambling to follow along with what Tony’s saying and to keep himself together.
Steve knew that he needed to hurry, but he still hesitated and then leaned down to kiss Tony, once, then twice, wishing for impossible things, before donning the mantle of responsibility.
Okay, that’d been kind of foolish of him to assume Tony would be waiting in the living room just because he’d been there the last time he’d come back. Tony had a lot to do, and he wouldn’t put his life on hold simply because Steve had gone on a mission.
“I never hated you,” he said softly, and it was unnatural seeing Tony without his usual energy, weary and broken down. He’d done that, Steve knew, but instead of feeling proud that he could accomplish such a thing, he felt uneasy. Anxious.
Tony let out a silent whistle, stepping back to take in the view, the long, clean lines of him, the quite frankly amazing ass, his for the taking.
He flinches when he hears the knock on the door, his heart rate picking up, and when Dr. Stark enters the room, Steve feels another burst of wetness, his ass contracting helplessly.
Steve insists on paying for their coffees, a couple of bottles of water, and the two pastries he gets to share, since he was the one who asked Tony out. He hadn’t expected Tony to argue, but it’s still somewhat of a relief when Tony doesn’t make a big deal about it or act like his Alpha pride is insulted and just says, “Why, Mr. Rogers, tempting me with sugar and caffeine. How can I refuse? I hope you’ll let me pay next time then.”
I actually started writing chapter 8 and got about 2K into it when I realized I needed ANOTHER chapter to lead into the chapter I was writing. SIGH. So for anyone curious, I have 2K of chapter 9 written. Also, there might be some med kink coming up. *cough, cough* Maybe.
“Ow. Fuck. Ow!” Tony said as the most excruciating pain he’d ever experienced before in his life shot down his back.
Steve was ashamed to admit he was jealous, wished that he could hold on just as long and just as tightly, but when it was his turn, he kept it quick.
“Are they this sensitive during a heat?” Dr Stark asks, and it’s only then that Steve realizes his eyes have nearly closed.
“I think we’ve already proven the Time Stone should be a last resort and even then, only for something on the scale of universal salvation. As I said, someone needs to have sex with Tony. It doesn’t matter who since the curse isn’t bound to true love. But as I want to set realistic expectations, the person who volunteers will have to be in the receptive role. Let me know when you decide,” he told them, and with a snap of his cape, he left the room.
Steve’s eyes searched his, and whatever he saw there made him sigh and smile tiredly. “Alright,” Steve said, and he accepted the towel Tony handed him, his fingers brushing against Tony’s.
Oh, he’d rationalized it at first. Steve was on the run. Steve was finding out who the real traitor was. Steve was protecting him by keeping the spotlight off of him. Even as SHIELD had come in and ransacked his home, Tony had told himself that Steve hadn’t had any other option.
“No, no, just lay it on me. I don’t know which is worse: the suspense, or the pain from all this torture—or “exercise” as Steve likes to call it—but one of those at least I can get rid of immediately. Spill it.”
He tilts his head, wondering if the guy’s still alive. It’s pure luck that Tony found him, floating on a piece of driftwood in the middle of nowhere. He has no idea how he got out here, considering Humans say Angels always stay close to land.
Maybe there’s just something comforting about the motions, the rhythm of pouring and then tossing it back, as if he’s accomplishing something in the dead of night when everything around him is too quiet but still too loud. Maybe he just likes the bitter taste on his tongue that’s almost its own kind of punishment—at least until his taste buds go numb. Who knows?
So instead he asked, “What are you in the mood to drink?” and headed for the bar, because even if Steve didn’t want one, he sure as hell planned on having something.
He wasn’t surprised when Tony immediately whirled around—annoyed, yes, but not surprised—and he curled up behind the shield as Tony raised his arms, cursing under his breath.
“What if I am?” Steve asked, and Tony’s eyes narrowed at the tone which crept along the edge of belligerence.  It demanded a reaction.
What if Subs hadn’t left their Dom’s in Steve’s day, and all of this was Steve’s way of trying to force Tony to break things off?
Tony stared at the wall as Steve got dressed, giving him what privacy he could that didn’t entail turning his back to him or leaving the room. It was difficult knowing he’d done the right thing but also knowing that he’d hurt the both of them doing it.
“Some patients find they’re more comfortable when they don’t have to see what’s happening, so I thought we’d give this a try,” Dr. Stark says, coming around to Steve’s side. “What do you think?”
I just wanted to apologize to all my readers who left comments that I never responded to. I try, I try to write back to each and every one, but there was a period where I was really detached from fandom, and at this point, it feels ridiculous to respond to a comment from 5 months ago. I'm so sorry. I fail. *hangs head in shame*
“Please,” Steve whispered, because he wouldn’t have asked, had managed to claw up that much restraint, but if Tony were willing, he wanted to hold Tony in the minutes he had left.
Steve’s head snapped around to look at him.  “That’d be great,” Steve said smiling, surprised and hopeful, and Tony didn’t need his newfound telepathy to tell how happy Steve was at that moment.
He didn’t know when he’d wrapped his arms around Tony’s leg, but even knowing he was doing it didn’t mean that he could force himself to pull away.
It’s so intense that Steve doesn’t realize he’s whining until he starts getting louder, but by that point, he can’t hold any of it back anymore, too exhausted and overwhelmed to fight for control. Dr. Stark isn’t letting up, and Steve is almost hunched over his knees, his face lost in the drape as he grunts and shakes.
If only he’d realized it a few days ago, Steve thought, his stomach sinking, knowing it wasn’t the best time for his epiphany. Even if he had the courage to admit his feelings, there’d be next to no chance that Tony would believe—
He didn’t want to tell Steve that he was making sure that there wouldn’t be a second tomorrow that Steve wasn’t thinking about him, no matter who else was there, so instead he said, “I thought you’d like to give bondage a little try.”
So after all those lovely comments,  I was planning to update last week, but then the chapter fought me, so that didn't happen. Then I hit 4.3K, and I realized I was still only half-way finished (I have a feeling all these punishment days are going to be split into 2), but I didn't want to make you guys wait anymore, so here is the first half of Day 1.
Steve could swear that he heard Tony’s voice, but that made no sense.  Tony hadn’t been in the ice with him; he hadn’t even known Tony existed then.  He’d been alone, forgotten and unnecessary.
“Come on, Steve, you’ll love it,” Tony said, the wheedling full force in his voice.  “My parents are staying in LA for the winter, and it’s beautiful out there.  No black snow on the ground or people resembling the Michelin Man because of all the layers they’re wearing.  Just gorgeous beaches and gorgeous people with tons of food and a tub in your bathroom so big, you could swim in it.  I’ll even fly you first class.  You’ll be in the lap of luxury the whole time.”
He’d considered asking for more kisses, but now that he thought about it, that wasn’t really forward progress. They’d already kissed once, and if he asked, Tony would probably be willing to do it again, but wouldn’t Tony want more than that?
Steve gauged the distance as well as the number and location of the branches separating him and Tony, and he gave a quick prayer that the branch would hold his weight, before he ran along it’s length, leaping at Tony.
, and he was going to— “Assuming the two of you are compatible, of course,” Fury added, throwing Tony’s own words in his face, and he’d never liked Fury.  Not even once.
“As I understand it, she didn’t originally want you to know. I believe it was a fairly recent diagnosis.”
“Well . . . thanks,” Tony said after swallowing, and he sat down on a stool. It had to be a good sign that Steve was still willing to make him food, didn’t it?
“This wasn’t exactly in my calendar, you know.  Go for a morning run, hack into Reed Richards’ mainframe for the hell of it, meeting with Fury . . . nope, nope, I don’t recall ‘get a Sub’ anywhere in there, so excuse me if I need some time to plan out my next step.”
“It’s just … I’m at a point in my life now that I’d like to settle down, maybe start a family, if my partner is interested, and you’re … you know,” Tony said, doing some kind of complicated hand motion, and no, Steve did not know.
Tony runs his hands down the sides of Steve’s legs when the muscles start jumping, over and over again, presses his tongue even deeper into Steve to stifle the urge to smile.
He couldn’t think of any other reason Tony would ask him to go to his bedroom—although his imagination was suddenly coming up with all sorts of implausible scenarios—but no. After last night, it definitely had to be about sex.
“There you go,” Tony said as his fingers finally came to a stop. Steve whined when Tony pulled out, but Tony shushed him, wrapping both arms around Steve’s waist and tugging gently.
“Can I help you?” he asked, his eyebrows rising as he took in the view.  Tall, blond, handsome in that clean-cut, boy-next-door type of way with enough muscle to make the button-down shirt he was wearing stretch appealingly across his chest, why it had to be Tony’s lucky day.
“Oh for—” He stuck the bottle under his arm and snagged Tony’s wrist, gently pulling his hand up until Tony’s face followed and they were looking each other in the eye. “Tony, food.”
This chapter killed me, guys. I had so much trouble with it. I've been working on it for months, writing, getting stuck, coming back to it, deleting crap and then writing some more, etc., etc. but it just would. not. cooperate. I'm still not happy with it. Seriously. Months. Arghhhhhh. I've reached the point where I just decided to post it and then move forward from there. Wish me luck. This fic, I swear.
The crinkles around Tony’s eyes have no right to be half as endearing as they are. “Don’t worry about it; I know it’s what you’re used to.”
“I’m not saying it’d never happen, but Stark is a valuable commodity, and it’d be much more likely that someone would ransom him or try to leverage his intelligence than hurt him,” Natasha said delicately, and Steve stared at her. He’d never told her about Tony.
Steve didn’t push him away, though, and while he did drop his chin against his chest, hiding his face, he also turned into Tony—not much—but enough that Tony took hope from it, however unjustified that might be.
“I’m not the first Dom they’ve brought in, am I?” he asked, and he knew he was right from the way Steve’s face went carefully blank.  “I’m not the only one they’ve shopped you around to.  And maybe you managed to scare off the rest of them—uppity Sub you might be, but you’re still
TW: This chapter really has Steve in a bad headspace, and he agrees to things because he feels like he can't disagree, even though he really doesn't want to. Please be aware and read with caution.
Steve’s eyes closed tightly, and he took several slow breaths. But eventually he whispered, “Alright,” and when Tony started to climb to his feet, Steve joined him, staggering and gritting his teeth against the pain of having been in that position for so long.
“How’s that?” Tony asked, buckling it around Steve’s neck and testing the give. Steve was able to repress a shiver at the feel of Tony’s fingers against his throat, but he didn’t have the self-control to keep himself from pressing his cheek into the base of Tony’s palm—not much; just enough to feel the warmth of his skin and imagine for a second what it’d be like if Tony were putting a collar on Steve because he wanted to.
Steve felt the give in the metal of the utensils he was holding and hurriedly straightened them back up.
But he still dully accepted the comfort of Tony’s arms, too weak to refuse and desperate for whatever last touches he could hoard.
Not that he’d thought much of kindness in the beginning as he’d looked down at the blue, wrinkled infant, eyes the color of heart’s blood staring back at him.  Then, he’d been angry and bitter that duty required so much of him, certain that the marriage was a punishment for his father’s sins, for even if their union brought peace to their realms, it would mean ruin for him.
, Steve thought—hoped—the once firm foundation of his assumptions made shaky by the defeat on Tony’s face. But the turmoil and anger of the past few days were too great to ignore, and what he found himself saying was, “Yes.”
He hears a click and looks up to see Dr. Stark positioning one of the stirrups, and it’s like being punched in the gut, all the air deserting him, leaving him dizzy and disoriented. His ass clenches down so hard that he’s worried the sight alone is going to tip him over—
It made it so that he went to check in on Pepper and Morgan every week because it was all he could do for Tony now. He asked Pepper’s permission, of course, not wanting to add to her burden in case she didn’t want a reminder of the Avengers hanging around, but she seemed grateful for the company, for Morgan at least. He and she had never exactly been close, although they’d always been friendly with each other, and they would sit down to tea or coffee or share a meal together if he arrived late enough, but Morgan was always there, and they directed their questions more to her than to each other.
But if he had, would that have been the end? If he’d kept hiding how he felt, would Tony have already sent him on his way?
That wasn’t possible. But that didn’t change the fact that Tony was looking at Steve like he was … the word “precious” came to mind, but Steve discarded that thought almost immediately. “Cute” maybe. Although that still was hard to believe, and Steve was sure that if anyone else ever saw him, the kindest description they’d give would probably be “ridiculous.”
Steve didn’t feel right going into too much detail, even if he knew it was entirely possible Tony could hack into SHIELD’s databases and find out for himself. He shared the bits and pieces he could, however, as Tony finished the sandwiches in rapid succession, only slowing down near the end of last one when he started listing gently to the side.
Tony was the one who had safeworded, and a small but dark voice inside of him resented that he had to deal with Steve’s emotions on top of his own.
I apologize that we’re almost 10K in and there’s not even a hint of porn yet. No one is sadder about this than I am.
“Yes,” he said, wondering how Tony would do it. Would he do it himself? Or use a sex toy of some kind? Would he—
“What? Why not?” Steve asks, jumping over a rock in order to finish the guy before his health regenerates. Saturday mornings are for Trials.
“I’m on my way.” He turned back to the bed. The conversation had been so short that he hadn’t even made it out of the bedroom yet.
“Well, I’ll let Dr. Reynolds know you’re here,” Nurse Sara said at last, smiling back at him as she walked to a cupboard. “He’s going to want to examine you, so please get completely undressed, underwear too, and put this gown on with the opening in the back. You can use this sheet to cover your lap if you’d like.”
Steve starts smiling as soon as he sees IronMan’s already on. A second later, he’s joining Tony’s fireteam without even checking to see where he is and setting up a party chat.
Tony had caught him at it one time when he’d come over and woken Steve up with a blow job.  Steve had never let him spend the night or been willing to stay at his place, and Tony had been putting up a fight.  He didn’t know if the blow job had been an apology for the argument the night before or if it’d been a sneaky way of trying to further his case, but Tony had seen him at the mirror afterwards, touching his scars as he got ready for the day, and Tony had never brought up the subject again, something that Steve could only be grateful for.
“Until you tell me I can’t,” Steve said, an expression of petty triumph on his face as he looked at Tony, and that was it; he was done.  He was so fucking done.
He didn’t … okay, so he got a little flustered around Tony sometimes since they’d all moved back into the Tower, and he’d been dropping things, but—
They only talked for a few minutes longer, but he felt better afterward. Just hearing Tony’s voice made Steve feel more settled. It always did. Which was a startling revelation to have, especially at a moment like this, but it was true.
he was having strange thoughts when Stark had touched him more in the past thirty or so minutes than he’d been touched in months. Even with the Serum, he was only a man in the end, prone to the same failings, and he was lonely. He’d been lonely for a long time. And as a result, he’d let things go too far. They were training after all, and if touch wasn’t permitted here, then where was it? He shouldn’t have started grappling with Stark, though, should’ve stuck to throwing punches, even if the brushes of Stark hands and arms and legs had been like comfort almost, even if all Steve had wanted was to feel a little more contact for just a little bit longer.
“Because I left you!” Steve said, and Tony flinched, a sob trying to claw its way out as an abrupt tidal wave of emotion crashed down on him. He’d survived losing Steve once already. Twice, really, since he’d been so sure the second time that it was over. He knew he’d survive it the third time as well, no matter how long it took to drag himself back up. But knowing didn’t make the mourning any easier.
It couldn’t last this way forever, though. And even though Tony dreaded Steve leaving him, he could admit there was a tiny part of him—exhausted from all the stress and worry and hoping and all the ups and downs—that was looking forward to it as well.
Although Steve’s sure that if he were to turn his head, he’d see Dr. Stark staring at the screen or one of the posters on the wall, giving Steve whatever small scrap of privacy he can.
Sorry, guys. I've been sitting on this chapter for a few weeks, intending to write more, but life is working against me. So have this for now, I guess, and I'll try to write more soon. And by soon, I mean faster than 5 or 6 months, really. >_>
What if he went looking for someone who, months after they started dating, wouldn’t have such a hard time thinking of something he or she had done for Tony?
Steve had to deliberately loosen his hold on Tony’s fingers, worried that he was going to hurt him with how hard he was gripping.
He sat on the edge of the couch, still holding Steve’s wrist, and tugged gently. “Will you get on your knees for me?”
“Not subtle. But then, I’m not exactly a subtle kind of guy, so good for you. I can say honestly and with great vehemence that the way you fill out your jeans is a gift.”
Steve strokes Tony’s cheek, and he leans into his palm. There’s a cove that allows the two of them to be close without either of them having to be too uncomfortable, but it’s not ideal.
Tony tensed for a second and then sighed. “Of course you do.” He sat up, and Steve missed his weight as soon as it was gone. “Go shower. I’ll get your stuff.”
“But Steve,” Tony whispered, lifting his other hand so they both cradled his face. Steve barely kept from jumping when he felt pressure against his forehead, but he was glad he hadn’t when he realized Tony had lowered his face to his. “You can
They meet near the middle of the room, and Steve shakes his hand, letting go quickly and refusing to think about how warm and firm Dr. Stark’s grip had been.
“You really shouldn’t worry so much, Steve. As far as embarrassing behavior goes, you’re not even in the running for first place,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve’s grateful that Dr. Stark isn’t looking at his face, his gaze flickering between Steve’s nipples as he checks for any … lactation. He knows Dr. Stark is going to eventually see just how revealing his expression no doubt is, but he wants to put off that moment as long as possible.
“Okay,” Steve said and swallowed, eyes flitting up to meet Tony’s, just for a second, before he was staring at Tony’s jeans again.
He couldn’t read the expression on Tony’s face, however, and he had to swallow the lump that rose in his throat, his heart hurting worse than his arms had a minute before.
“I bet,” Tony murmured sympathetically, and it was just two words, but there was a wealth of warmth in his voice that had Steve closing his eyes.
“You do that,” he said, all false bravado, because he didn’t actually know if he’d survive Tony trying harder, but he was all for finding out.
“Okay, so it changes some things, but it still doesn’t change the fact that we’ve never seen each other, we live at opposite ends of the country, and our only interaction has revolved around a video game.”
“Thank you,” Steve gasped, his hips thrusting forward in order to chase a firmer grip—only for Tony to move away.
She smiled. “Good. You deserve it,” she said, and Steve found himself looking down at his plate. It wasn’t that he disagreed with her, but after everything that had happened, it was still a struggle to accept that good things
It bothered him almost as much as seeing the blank expression on Tony’s face as Tony closed down and knowing he’d been the one to put it there.  It was the reason he said, “If it turns out that you’re
“So,” Tony says.  He stares at the flowers in Steve’s hand, at the clothes he’s wearing that have spent more time on the floor of his house than on Steve whenever he’s come over, and he doesn’t know what any of it means.
Which was why he felt so shaky now, because Tony was taking something from then and using it as punishment. If Tony hadn’t talked about it like a good thing, like something he’d want to
Tony let Steve slip out from between nerveless fingers as Steve sat up, watching as his mouth moved but unable to hear much over the cacophony in his head, only catching bits and pieces of his words.
Tony’s hand came back then, carding through Steve’s hair, slowly and carefully, and he shivered, tilting his head to make it easier for Tony.
So it was with trembling fingers that Steve reached back, spreading his cheeks in order to be even better for Tony.
They were annoying. The weight, the distraction, the glimpses of fake fur out of the corner of his eyes. The thing that bothered him the most, however, the thing that made him want to yank them off before Tony could even finish adjusting them, was the fact that Steve knew he had to look comical with them on.
good to see Tony’s mouth fall open as Steve comes out, and he wishes he could watch Tony watching him, but he’d literally have to walk backwards in order to do it. So after giving Tony what feels like a stupidly bashful smile, he crosses the short distance to the bathroom, the weight of Tony’s eyes following his every step. He finds himself going a little slower than necessary in order to extend the time he can bask under Tony’s appreciative gaze—
Dr. Stark hangs his shirt on the coat hook on the back of the door and smiles at Steve as he goes to wash his hands again.
Drugs?  Too many side-effects.  He didn’t want to live a shorter life, or to spend all his time looking for the next hit or recovering from the last one.
The peace couldn’t last, though. Already thoughts of how tired Tony looked were starting to creep into his awareness, of how the angry lines on Tony’s back had curled around to his sides in places and that it couldn’t be comfortable for him to lie like that. Of how much better he’d rest and how much happier he’d be if Steve had never intruded on his life.
“I found you,” his Angel says, his voice rough but his eyes shining with triumph. And then he kisses Tony.
“I know you will,” Tony said softly, cupping Steve’s cheek. “Get your cock out, Sweetheart. Show me how much you like my fingers fucking your mouth.”
Somehow … somehow Tony had already forgiven him. Or was close enough that it made no difference. Steve had suspected as much, but he’d thought—had hoped—that he was wrong. But here was Tony, already willing to brush aside all of Steve’s sins like they’d never happened.
“Sorry!” Dr. Stark says, obviously surprised at Steve’s reaction (if only he knew), and he raises his hands, stepping back. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. I was just—”
"What's that?" Tony interrupts, putting a hand to where his ear would be if he weren't in full armor.  "There's a bat on my head?”
Dr. Stark tugs gently at Steve’s hips, and Steve’s glad for his hands over his face, because he’s just barely able to catch the gasp behind his palm, and he’s leaking worse than ever now. It’s as if hearing the splash against the step has encouraged his body to produce even more slick, needing to show Dr. Stark how much he affects him, rejecting even the possibility of denying it.
“Before I do that, however, there was one other thing I wanted to tell you. It’s about the phone call I got a few days ago. It was from Maria Hill. She’d called to apologize on behalf of SHIELD and let me know that they were going to release all my things back to me within the next couple of days. I meant to let you know sooner, but with everything that happened,” Tony said, his eyes falling before coming back up to meet Steve’s, “I got distracted, and I’m sorry that I let you go on thinking otherwise.”
Although … would he have recovered enough by tomorrow to hurt Steve the way he deserved? Should they wait even longer so Tony could—
Tony didn’t say anything for a long moment, but he ran his hand along Steve’s hair over and over again in a barely-there caress that Steve didn’t want to ever stop.
Nonetheless, he couldn’t stop from tensing up when he caught a glimpse of red and gold beneath and to the left of him. Tony hovered in the air as he looked around, his back to Steve, and it was as good as position as he could’ve hoped for, which automatically made him suspicious. Still, if Tony knew where he was, attacking was his best shot anyway, and if he didn’t know, waiting around for Tony to look up and behind him definitely wasn’t going to help.
Tony’s seen a lot of Humans, both from far away on passing ships and up close and personal when they’ve had representatives visit Atlantis, but he’s never spotted so much as a silhouette of a real Angel before.
“We’ll do a trial period.  Three months.  Things go well, Captain Rogers stays with you until you mutually agree to end your association.  Things don’t go well, he comes back, and you still get a spot on the team.”
“Steve,” Tony said once he was gone, the first word he’d uttered since Nick had begun explaining how their contract was over.
Tony froze, the line of his shoulders going rigid. His face was pointed away, so Steve couldn’t see his expression, but he desperately wanted to, wished … wished for so many fucking things, that he’d called Tony, that he’d talked about Project Insight with him, wished that he hadn’t made the same damn mistake that he’d already made over and over again and just fucking
He couldn’t even really say why exactly. Maybe because he didn’t want to embarrass himself with all of his inexperienced fumbling. In the weeks since they’d gotten together, he’d learned that Tony apparently didn’t have a gag reflex and could hold his breath for a dizzying amount of time, but when Steve had tried to practice alone with a banana, well, the end result had been him coughing on and off for almost five minutes, positive that there was still something lodged in his throat.
He would’ve liked to blame it on the dream, wished that being unsettled from thinking about Stark in that way, from calling him by his first name and imagining himself submit to Stark were valid excuses for his behavior, but they weren’t. None of the events from the previous day, from the visit to SHIELD to what had happened after he’d woken up, should’ve affected how he reacted to Stark’s suggestion.
Tony glared at Fury.  “I have seven doctorates to my name, but if I had the time right now, I would get another one in Genetics just to—”
He thought of his apartment, filled with more things than he’d ever owned before in this life but still empty all the same.
He refused to let himself get mired in his guilt yet again, however, knowing it wouldn’t help either of them, no matter how tempting the urge was to relive every horrible decision he’d made over the past few days. Steve hoarded blame almost as much as he did, and he knew Steve wouldn’t forgive himself if he could see Tony obsessing about his own mistakes every chance he got. There’d be time to go over everything later,
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony said, shrugging.  The movement made Steve realize to his horror that Tony’s buttons didn’t match up to the right holes.  How had he missed that?  No wonder she’d kept staring at Tony’s chest. “It’s an investment anyway.  We’re going to be breaking a lot more couches and tables and beds in the years to come,” he said, reaching out to hold Steve’s hand and giving it a quick squeeze.  “Might as well be prepared.”
. Steve gets it now. He’s finally loosening up, but Dr. Stark only has one finger inside of him. He still has to get another one in. He still has to get the
“You don’t have to worry about me. I’ve, uh, I’ve gotten myself ready, and I’m just going to … .” He looked around, but Dr. Strange had put Tony in a meditation room, so there wasn’t any furniture. “I’m just going to get on all fours, and you can—”
Fifteen minutes later, they stood outside the front doors, flushed and still sticky with sweat, and Steve moaned, covering his face with his hand, "I can't believe we got kicked out!"
Okay, so I apologize for the two week wait, but I got really sick last weekend, so I spent a few days being miserable and unable to write.
“What did you . . . ?” Steve began, raising up and letting Tony’s legs fall to the ground, and no matter how awkward the situation, the opportunity was too good to pass up.
to be with you so much,” he said, tears managing to well up without permission at the knowledge that it might be the very last time he was with Tony, and he wiped at his eyes roughly before they could fall. “I didn’t call, because I didn’t want to know what you’d say, and I’m sorry I doubted you, I’m so fucking sorry, but I’ve just lost so many people already,” he said, his voice cracking, “I couldn’t face the possibility of losing you too.”
.  He tries to remember what he’d done yesterday to end up this way, but all he gets are vague flashes of laughing and bright lights and strong arms holding him up, and that’s not helpful at all.  Had something happened?  A mission gone wrong maybe?  Is he dying?
“Yes,” Steve said, testing the net one more time. There wasn’t as much flex as he’d first thought. He wondered how long it’d take for him to get free.
Steve’s eyes popped open when he heard the first ring, and he reached out blindly, swiping at the screen before his phone could make any more noise. “Rogers,” he whispered as he got out of bed, trying to be as quiet and unobtrusive as possible. He could feel several small twinges down on his back as he moved—from Tony’s bites, he realized, a swell of contentment in his chest—but he couldn’t focus on them now.
“Oh fuck, oh, Steve,” he hears dimly, but he doesn’t really understand what Tony’s saying, his body jerking as wave after wave of sensation rolls through him, not even pleasure—or at least, not
want to,” Tony said, sharply enough that Steve flinched slightly, looking away, and he decided to continue on with the movement, climbing off the machine and heading for his clothes. The scene was over.
” right after and clutched onto the back of Tony’s shirt, keeping him in place as he started crying harder.
“I did not,” Dr. Reyolds snapped, but it was the voice of a man trying to salvage what little dignity he could.
bedroom, and shown him where he could unpack his things, where Tony had purposefully made space in his life that Steve had chosen to fill.  Tony probably would’ve fucked him up against the wall or down on the floor because they couldn’t make it to the bed, and Steve would’ve submitted so beautifully to him, on his knees and grateful because of it.  They would’ve spent the rest of the night in a flurry of friction burns, the floor littered with spilled bottles of lube to make things easier and half-empty tubes of salve for when they invariably got hard, and Tony would’ve kissed every inch of him afterwards, worshipping him with his tongue the way he’d worshipped him with his cock minutes before.
“What?” Tony said sharply, not even meaning to that time, but there was something in Steve’s tone that made it impossible to keep quiet, like
“Yeah, well, things in Botswana went a lot faster than expected, so I get to lounge around for a few weeks before I have to go out again,” she said, setting her tray down across from him.
He started walking around the lab as he waited for her to come to terms with the news. Maybe he should build another suit. Designing new suits was very calming.
For the prompts "coitus interruptus" (avengers_tables) and "kink: frottage" (cap_ironman bingo).  I went with the literal definitions of coitus interruptus and frottage, which are “sexual intercourse in which the penis is withdrawn before ejaculation” and “…in which sexual arousal or orgasm is achieved by actual or fantasized rubbing up against another person” respectively.  I seriously don’t know why I picked the Cliché table.  I should’ve picked the Kink one instead.  *headdesk*
“Well, it looks like I was worried for nothing. Everything looks good, Steve, and so we can go on to the next part of the examination.”
He cautiously pokes at one of the feet—weird, stubby things that don’t seem long enough to do anything useful but still successfully manage to hold Humans and Angels upright—and frowns when he doesn’t get a reaction. It’d be really disappointing if the first Angel he meets is a dead one.
, and Steve had spent most of the next few days in a sexual delirium. He’d finally had had to put a stop to it so he could function—he still didn’t know how he’d missed two calls from SHIELD, and it was lucky they hadn’t sent someone to check up on him—but the first chance they both had some guaranteed vacation time, he definitely wanted to do it again.
Like his whole life had been turned upside down. Like he’d been cast off. Like he didn’t have a safe place anymore, or even a place he could call his own. Tony could tell all too easily the thoughts that had to be going through Steve’s head.
“Do you have a minute?” Steve asked, hovering uncertainly at Tony’s door, and it was the first time he’d ever come to Tony’s bedroom.
“I just think it’d end up meaning a lot more to me than you’d want it to,” Tony said quietly, looking up at Steve through his eyelashes, and Steve heart thudded painfully in his chest.
“I’m in,” he said at long last, and why was it so hard to speak? He finally managed to force himself to look at Nick, because looking at Tony didn’t change anything.
He can’t even finish the sentence, can’t say “I’ve never orgasmed during an exam before,” even though it’s true. There have definitely been times when he’s been close in the past, and he’s learned to choose appointments that allow him to rush home and take care of himself after it’s all said and done, but he’s never come on an exam table before at the hands of another doctor.
“Of course not,” Tony said and made a noise that scoffed at the very idea of Steve doing anything like that for him.
“You know, the only person I want is you,” Tony said, wanting to cringe at the sappiness and the utter truth behind the words.  “The packaging aside, it was still you and me on the inside, and that was what mattered.”
It hadn’t been five minutes yet, he reminded himself, trying to stay calm and resisting the urge to look at the clock. And Tony was talking to him at least, asking him questions. That had to be a good thing, right?
He turns towards Tony’s voice without answering, and Tony takes one look at his expression and sighs, long and low.
He shouted when Tony finally locked inside of him, shouted in pain and shock and pleasure as he came all over himself, much earlier than he’d expected, as if Tony’s enormous knot had forced the come out of him, not enough room for the both of them in Steve’s body. Even then, Tony continued thrusting, harsh, stilted motions that tugged and stretched Steve’s hole as Tony rocked against his prostate and filled him with so much come that Steve could feel the pressure in his gut, and it made Steve’s orgasm last forever, tears welling in his eyes as he cried out from the overstimulation, come spurting from his cock in weak drizzles long after he was done.
Sorry for all the exposition, but I had to set the story up. Next chapter is already written, and I'll post it in a few days.
It had Steve meeting his eyes finally, some of the rigid tension seeping away, but it had the opposite effect on him, and he stared back, panic starting to well up.
“Please what?” he asked, squeezing harder with his fingers and then slowly licking his latest bite. It was more of a challenge to get a nice mouthful along the plains of Steve’s back—which was why it was all the more satisfying when Tony did it.
Tony looked up when the door opened, the little bell hanging from the handle jangling cheerfully, making him sigh.  Clara claimed the door needed a bell so she could know when people came in even if she was in the back room; he was just as insistent that it didn’t, especially since more often than not, whoever came in announced themselves with a “Hey, Clara!” anyway.  For each one he took down, however, Clara put another one up, and it’d somehow become a contest of wills between the two of them.  Of course, the fact that a bell had just announced a new customer even though he hadn’t seen Clara by the door all day indicated that—at least for the moment—he seemed to be losing.  Damn it.
Steve had been living with him for less than seven full days, and he was already going to be gone for that long? What if Fury were behind the timing? What if he’d been invested in getting them together before but had subsequently changed his mind? What if tried to convince Steve to go back? Or worse yet, what if Steve had decided he needed some time to think? What if he was reevaluating his decision?
“Here, sit down,” Tony said, gently directing Steve down onto a tiled bench—a heated tile bench, Steve discovered. As a matter of fact, the wall was also heated, probably all the walls were, and while it seemed like a waste of energy, Steve could admit he appreciated the indulgence as he let himself lean back, watching Tony adjust some of the shower heads so they were directed at Steve’s body. He sighed as Tony turned on the water, which came out already at the perfect temperature. He’d missed Tony a lot during his time in D.C., but if he’d had to name something to come in second place, the tankless water heater would’ve been it.
“All right, last thing.” Tony pulled what had to be the tail from the bag, the fur matching the color of—
Tony’s eyes were closed, but he could hear the change in Steve’s voice, hear the sudden and inexplicable interest.  There was something
He had no clue how much time had passed by the time he’d finally collected himself and was ready, and he refused to think about it, because he knew if he did, he’d just make himself worse.
He didn’t correct her assumption that he’d turned Tony down because he thought they weren’t contracted anymore—at least, that wasn’t the only reason. More important than their legal status was that he couldn’t stand to be around Tony, knowing that he didn’t belong to him anymore, that he didn’t
with us being wallflowers all week! We’ve been good, staying under the radar and taking time to bond and all that, but the honeymo—but that’s all over now!”
I've never written Bucky before, and I didn't know what to do with this prompt, so this is what happened. idk
“I know you will,” Tony said, and the certainty in his words helped Steve’s heart to calm down a little. “You’re going to be my good boy, aren’t you?” he said, more of a statement than a question, but Steve was nodding along before he’d even finished.
Except he wasn’t supposed to ask for things for the next three days. Not the way Tony had always encouraged him to ask in the past. As if there were nothing Tony wouldn’t give him.
He wasn’t thrilled about the hide-and-seek, but it gave him time to figure out a plan of attack. Repetition would only help Tony, so he was going to have to come up with several different methods to take him by surprise. He’d also have to be mindful of how hard he threw, since unlike Tony, he hadn’t had time to prepare any alternatives. Still, the armor should keep Tony safe as long as Steve was careful.
His Angel gets sweeter and sweeter the higher up his thighs Tony’s tentacles go, and his suckers are actually catching on his Angel’s skin from pressing so hard. It’s torture, but he wrenches his tentacles away before he does something he regrets.
He’s almost tempted to do it again since it’s the most his Angel has moved the entire time, but his tentacles have their own ideas and start crawling all over his Angel’s thighs. Tony’s always thought legs were kind of weird, but he has to admit that his Angel’s are nice. They’re thick and muscular and like, wow, okay, actually
Steve stares down at his phone. Bucky tends to be a lot more blunt than he is, which is saying something, but even he has to realize the absurdity of what he just suggested.
Steve shouldn’t be allowed within a fifty foot radius of Tony, but the thought of not seeing him again makes him want to curl up into a nest of blankets and grieve. He’d been so hopeful things would go well, and instead, he’s ruined everything.
Dr. Stark still doesn’t stop, and Steve can feel his face getting redder and his ass even wetter as Dr. Stark m—
Maybe if he’d stayed at SHIELD longer, he would’ve eventually approached one of the men or women there, although he doubted it. Before Stark had arrived, he’d always preferred to be by himself, needing the solitude to get his thoughts together, and it was unlikely that Nick would’ve let him engage with anyone while he was still unattached.
Not discussing it didn’t mean Steve didn’t think about it, however, because he did. All the time. He didn’t want to, but random bits of memory would pop into his head, the flex of muscle underneath his hand, the sound of Stark panting from exertion, the scent of cologne overlaid with sweat.
He can’t wear these jeans. What the hell had he been thinking? They’re—no. Just no. Why does he even own these?
“I couldn’t answer then. Not because I didn’t know! Maybe I didn’t realize it was love, but I’ve known that I wanted to stay with you for a long time. Almost since the day I left. I missed you so damn much, Tony,” Steve said, the last words almost a whisper, and fuck, Tony was trembling.
so much—he had to close his eyes for a second, tried to swallow down the grief—but he was back in his own time now, and it’d be easy to find Peggy, to hold her close and live out the rest of his days with her, to do all the things he’d hoped to do the first time around.
, or whatever it is you’re doing,” Tony said, rolling onto his side out of self-preservation. When Steve had offered to give him a massage, he’d been delighted and had already made plans on how things would segue into sexy times.
So, disclaimers. I have only been to see a psychologist once, so please take Steve's interactions with his psychologist with a grain of salt. Also, might as well throw this one in, I have never been in a BDSM relationship. I mean, I wouldn't mind having a sub on his knees at my feet, but as I don't want to leave my husband, that is probably never going to happen. I feel like I've warned about the BDSM thing before--if not in this fic, than in others--but for those of you who think I'm experienced in this, I'm really, really not. I am very interested in BDSM, however, but since I don't live the lifestyle, I will occasionally get things wrong. Hopefully that fact doesn't turn anyone off this fic, but if it does, then I understand.
Thankfully, he’s lying on his stomach, so at least he doesn’t have to reveal his inappropriate (appropriate?) reaction.  Considering the draft he can feel from the air conditioner, however, and especially
“Yes, but you weren’t—” Tony cut himself off, but Steve could fill in the rest of sentence himself. “Besides,” Tony said, squeezing gently, in apology perhaps for the words he hadn’t said, or in an effort to comfort Steve, “I like to perform my own experiments, especially when it’s this important.”
I have so many things I need to apologize for, Tony: my anger and frustration, my stubbornness, my pride.  For not being there when you needed me most.  For not going to find you in order to bring you back to me.  I hope that when we finally see each other again that you can somehow manage to forgive me.  If not, I understand.  I doubt that I’ll ever be able to forgive myself.
He’d known, of course, about their contract. He’d seen the way they acted around each other, the looks they’d exchanged, the small touches they’d shared. It was obvious how in love they were, and he never would have guessed they’d been through such a traumatic event together. And if whoever had captured them had known who they were, those few hours would’ve been a lot worse than Steve could probably imagine.
“I wasn’t—”  Steve’s jaw clenched, and Tony could see his finger tightening around the strap of his bag.  “Maybe to someone like
Everything had seemed so much clearer after he’d cried. He’d felt calmer for having done it, ready to cry again, yes, but strangely also more settled and less like he was holding himself together with spit and hope. He would’ve preferred that he hadn’t lost control so completely in front of Tony or put him into a position where Tony had had to take care of him when Tony had been the one who’d needed support, but it had helped ease the suffocating urge to run away, leaving him shaky in the aftermath but somehow giving him the strength to fight, to admit how he felt.
It took clinging to the “sweetheart” (How? How could Tony still be willing to call him that after everything?) to force himself to calm down, but even then, it was a near thing, and he couldn’t let himself think about anything other than obeying the “don’t cry, sweetheart,” because if he did, he knew he’d break down all over again.
He caught sight of the red stain on Tony’s shirt again, and he couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away from it. He knew Tony hadn’t slept with anyone. He knew it, and he wouldn’t let himself believe otherwise. The red was probably from a miscalculated hug.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers,” JARVIS said, and Steve found himself relaxing a little. So much had happened in the past few days that he’d half-expected JARVIS to have changed. The familiar greeting was reassuring.
“Oh crap,” he said, reaching down to pick it up, hoping it hadn’t fallen into a wet patch.  It hadn’t, but apparently the fall had knocked one of the pages loose so that it poked up above the rest.
Crap, he was getting a bad feeling about this. Why had he instituted this stupid rule in the first place?
The smart thing to do would be to have Happy put Steve on the private jet, ship him back to D.C. as fast as he could and forget the whole day had happened.
“Are you?” He’d had Steve stand next to a padded table and told him he could hold onto it, lean against it if he wanted, or bend over it for extra support. Tony could even adjust the legs with a press of a button so Steve could climb on top if his knees couldn’t hold him anymore.
“You don’t owe me anything,” he said as Tony’s hands drifted lower. Steve tensed in anticipation, but Tony changed direction before he even reached his belt. He didn’t know why it was alright that Tony was touching him, but he couldn’t convince himself to move his own hand on Tony’s chest. He wanted to explore Tony’s body. He just . . . wasn’t.
Apparently, he had been, however, and what had Steve expected? For Tony to drop everything now that he was back?
He half-expected Tony to tell him to stop at some point, he didn’t know why, but Tony didn’t, so Steve didn’t, and he was naked by the end, resisting the urge to shift from foot to foot.
Tony’s voice was amused, but the look on his face let Steve know how affected he was, and it gave him the courage to say, “Aren’t you?” to shift his hips closer, even if he wasn’t quite brave enough to rub against Tony, not yet anyway.
Fury sighed, rubbing his forehead, but it totally wasn’t Tony’s fault.  When he subbed, he could take or leave the sex, preferred to leave it most of the time, and surprise, surprise, there wasn’t a shortage of men and women who were willing to smack him around a little bit without a promise of orgasm afterward.  When he dommed though . . . what could he say?  It got the blood flowing.
It didn’t take long to clear everything, and the dishes could wait overnight, he decided. Tony watched him as he worked, exuding sex from where he was semi-sprawled in his chair—although Steve could admit that was perhaps due to his own fervid imagination rather than anything Tony was doing—and Steve could feel the tension ratcheting up with each passing second.
“Oh no,” Captain America groaned, and Tony didn’t think he’d ever get tired of saying his name in his head.  Captain America.
He flinched slightly as Tony pulled out the earbuds, but there was so much static in his head that even when Tony said something, he couldn’t really understand it. He registered how soft Tony’s voice was, though, and he didn’t know if the gentleness was easier or harder to take than anger, but it didn’t matter, and he let the thought go without focusing on it, because Steve couldn’t—
He’d known that like many mammals, wolves had a bone in their penis, but knowing was different from experiencing, and he sobbed as Tony’s unnaturally hard cock battered away at his insides, growing thicker and thicker. He’d been right that the stretching beforehand hadn’t been enough, and his hole
“Look,” he said, shutting the stall door closed and glaring at a mutinous Tony.  “If you didn’t want me to move in with you, why did you even ask—”
Tony pressed against his palm for a few seconds, and then he slowly began lowering his head in handfuls of inches, pausing in between as if he were waiting for Steve to tell him no.
But if the only alternative was to sit back and watch Steve hunched over in misery, then Tony would bear whatever the hell he had to and ten times more besides as long as there was even a chance of comforting him. So Tony slid off the couch clumsily, falling to his knees next to Steve and clenching his teeth against the resulting pain, and he wrapped his arms around him, desperately hoping his shakiness wasn’t obvious—his heart nearly freezing when Steve tensed.
She shrugged and nodded toward the access panel, letting him know she’d keep working while he took care of the guards.
It hadn’t been until Nick had shown him the studies and the statistics that Steve had reluctantly agreed that maybe it was necessary.  Even then, however, it’d been something for other Subs, not for him, and he’d fought against it, rejecting ten more Doms in the meantime.  The war he’d been in had been over a long time ago—even if it’d just been a matter of months for him—and he didn’t need anyone looking after him, especially someone who could barely understand what he’d experienced.
Steve knew what it was like to go, go, go, until he finally stopped, and he wasn’t surprised that Tony’s energy had finally run out now that he’d sat down and filled his stomach.
“Now this is the fun part,” Tony said, pasting a smile on his face, and Steve looked down at his bare lap, which did nothing to make him feel better. “The machine won’t turn on as long as you keep your legs together.”
him,” he said turning to glare at her, and she could claim to not read his mission reports, but there was no way that she didn’t know that much.
He went to his room to put his things away, hesitating in the bathroom before brushing his teeth again—he’d brushed them that morning, but he’d eaten and had a couple of cups of coffee since then—and then started his search for Tony.
“What were you thinking?” Hill demanded several hours later after they finally managed to drag him away from the crowd to SHIELD headquarters.
“See, there’s a remedy for that!  Steve, will you go out on a really long date with me that starts with dinner and ends in front of a judge—”
Tony know about it?  Steve had felt certain that he and Tony could move past this, but … had Tony been keeping it secret from Steve? Had he been hiding it? Or had he assumed Steve already knew? And if he did know, did he agree with Nick? Tony believed in having more firepower than anyone else as a means of solving problems, but that was a world away from being alright with threatening to assassinate anyone who posed a potential risk.
He’d had enemas before as part of medical procedures, but it’d be the first time he’d ever done it because of ...
“You apologized. Alright. Fine,” Tony said, rubbing his eyes with his fingers and then pinching the bridge of his nose. The dismissive tone hurt, but Steve reminded himself that it was no less than he deserved. “Now what?”
Was it any surprise though? He’d been drifting for weeks, stumbling through a half-life where he’d spent each day waiting for everything to crash down around his ears. And there was a large part of Tony that knew the reason he’d done it was because it was necessary, knew that every second that went by where he didn’t guard his emotions was going to make it that much harder to come back from it later, but it was impossible to shore up his defenses with Steve under him, with Tony’s marks covering his body, and he wanted—
He missed the first few times, and Steve winced with every rough jab, trying to angle himself better for penetration as Tony began to growl in frustration.
hoping happens now?” Tony said, curt and impatient, and Steve tried not to panic at the expression on his face. He hadn’t looked at Steve like that since the very beginning when they’d first been forced together, like Tony didn’t know why he was even there, like Steve was wasting his time.
It’d be even more of a statement if he asked for a collar, but that he was still unsure of. He and Tony weren’t in a contract, and collars were more for couples that were. He didn’t want to ask for one and thereby indirectly pressure Tony, and if he were being honest, he didn’t want to wear one either.
?”  He lightly smacked Tony on the head with his sketchpad and stood up, taking a few steps before turning around to face him.  He normally enjoyed Tony’s lack of respect for personal boundaries—too much sometimes—but at that moment, he needed some distance between them.  “There are so many reasons why I won’t marry you, Tony,
“Every day, you tell me one thing you want. Can be big, can be small, but it has to be something. For today,” Tony said, letting his exhaustion roll over him now that the conversation had been gotten out of the way, and hell, how was the day not over yet, “unless you already have something else in mind, you can tell me what you want to eat for lunch. I’m starving.”
“Look, it’s just a preference thing, alright?  I like my own space.  I like following my own rules.  I’m not the type of person who takes ‘you are now free to move around in the cabin’ and ‘turn off all cellular and portable devices’ well.  Do I seem like that type of person?  Because if you think I am, we really need to reconsider whether we can pull this off.”
“Steve!” he yelled, because Steve was a nice guy, right?  He liked kids and puppies and was liked in return.  He’d know what to do.  “
“Who keeps turning on the television for you?” Steve asks as he walks into the common room and sees Tony sitting in front of the huge screen, jumping and batting at the moving objects.  There’s no one else in the room besides the two of them.  “Sitting this close to the television can’t be good for you.  And what if it falls down?  You’d be squished,” he says and turns it off.
person.  He can't believe he's being so uncharitable as to jealous of—no, not jealous, he’s not—he’s—
Actually, it made total sense.  If all of Stark’s weapons and computer security had been easily circumnavigated, SHIELD wouldn’t have continued to hire him.
Steve’s cock, causing Steve to bite at Tony’s lips as he trembles all over, and the rest of his tentacles go crazy as a result. The ones on Steve’s chest increase their suction until Steve whimpers pleadingly and scratches at Tony’s back, and then and only then do they let go, just to latch onto his nipples and do it again.
What’s worse is that walking next to Tony, feeling the heat of him, seeing the way his muscles seemingly glisten under the sun, makes Steve leak all over again, his body calling out to Tony to touch and taste and devour, like Steve hasn’t permanently humiliated himself. He has to consciously keep his gaze directed forward, no matter how much it wants to drift, and he does multiplication tables in his head in a woefully unsuccessful attempt to keep his thoughts occupied.
He remembered what Pepper had told him when this had all started, that he’d have to scene with Steve because “...who better to be his first than someone who already loves him?”
There are so many things that Steve could say, too many really, and that’s his only excuse for ignoring Bucky’s machinations and the obvious white elephant in the room and saying weakly, “You have horrible gaydar.”  Like he’s tried to set Steve up with straight men and been totally oblivious when gay guys hit on him levels of horrible.
They went downstairs, and Steve wasn’t sure why they were stopping by Tony’s lab, but he stood quietly as Tony opened the door, knowing he’d find out soon enough.
from him and wasn’t just putting up with it to teach Steve a lesson, then … then Steve wanted to give it to him. He’d already decided that he’d do whatever he had to in order to make Tony smile. If this was all it took, if putting on a costume and pretending to be something else for a little while pleased Tony this much, then Steve would try his hardest to let go of his insecurities and be the best pet he could be.
Nearly a year later, Tony couldn’t remember each of their faces, not after so many deaths.  But this one . . . oh, there was something special about him.
Tony’s shower had ten shower heads. Ten. Two in each corner, one hanging from the ceiling, and a handheld one in the more customary position about three-quarters up the wall. And Steve had thought the two in his bathroom were excessive—although, admittedly wonderful, especially after a long workout.
“Yeah.” He could hear Tony swallow. “Of course.” Steve flinched when he felt Tony’s fingers touch his, but he grabbed onto them before Tony had a chance to draw them away and held onto him like a lifeline. “Okay. It’s okay, Steve.”
"Just peachy," he drawled, wincing as he adjusted his shoulders a little.  As he’d been doing each time he thought about that first training session, Tony tried to pretend the weird episode hadn’t happened. And just like every time before, he failed miserably.
The kind who lied, albeit with the best intentions. The kind who ignored their Dom when he said he wasn’t feeling well.
“I hope you don’t mind,” he says, sending a silent apology to his mother, who would be appalled to know he was planning on abandoning a first-time guest to his own devices, “but I’d like to shower—”
Steve sat on the couch and waited, standing several times just to have shame force him to sit back down. He wondered what was taking so long, and if he should check up on Tony, and whether he should just carry him to bed since Tony couldn’t get any more upset with him and what did Steve have to lose anyway?
“Oh!” he says, whirling around because he’s finally remembered his manners, and his mother is feeling the overwhelming urge to swat him right now, without knowing why. “Did you find everything alright? Do you need help with anything?”
“Yes, sir, he is, and Mr. Stark has requested your presence in his bedroom as soon as you’re available.”
Steve’s eyes fluttering like that were a work of art, and Tony didn’t look away as he heard Steve’s belt jingle, as Steve’s arm started moving rhythmically. Not that he didn’t love watching Steve masturbate, but the sight of his hollowed cheeks, flushed red with desire and a dose of humiliation … how could Tony possibly tear his eyes away?
What in the hell? he thought, staring after it. Which was when he noticed the people walking past the alley, the cars driving by--
He felt the softest of pressure against his lips, and then he was gasping, desperate for air, Tony’s face hovering inches above his.
Tony lost his chance to respond when Steve’s expression began to crumple.“I don’t—” He dug the heels of his palms into his eyes, and Tony could see the tremble in his lips when he whispered, “I don’t know how to be good for you, Tony.”
He’d been planning to ask Tony on a date. But wouldn’t this be better? Wouldn’t this convey his intentions as clear as he could make them?
“You becoming a part of the Avengers,” Steve told him, and Tony wasn’t the only one who could shout. “And getting rid of a Sub you never wanted.”
, Steve gets weirdly fascinated by celebrities and can spend hours on IMDb.  “How couples decide to make a—a sex tape, and then suddenly everyone in the world has seen them naked!"
Steve jumps and slaps one hand over his mouth, but it’s too late to fully catch the moan before it escapes, and no, oh no.
He puttered around the apartment for a while before going to the pool to swim. If Tony happened to come up, he didn’t want to be sweaty, and there was nothing wrong really with reminding Tony of what he looked like half-naked.
Knowing he was going to see Tony soon, it was a lot harder to not think about him or about what was going to happen when Steve got back to New York, but there was Bucky to focus on, Bucky who was alive and out there by himself, Bucky who’d been brainwashed and tortured by Hydra for years, and before Steve knew it, he was standing in front of Stark Tower.
“Okay. Then we’ll . . . try this out for a while. See if . . .” He trailed off. “Look, so I’ve got some things I was working on that I need to wrap up. You, uh, know where everything is, so I guess I’ll leave you to it.”
voice; he couldn’t let himself forget—starting to fade, drowned out by the sound of his own heartbeat, the steady, rhythmic,
“—eve? Are you sure you’re alright?” Tony asks, and Steve wishes he could appreciate the concern in his voice more. “You’re suddenly looking really flushed and like you’re in pain, and your breathing has gotten faster. Would you mind if I checked your—”
Of course, most of the time, people were commenting on how similar they were, or how completely dissimilar, or how Howard would be so disappointed, or proud, or impressed, or whatever else they could come up with to use against Tony.  Bringing up Captain America was a new one though, he had to admit.
There was a long moment where Tony didn’t say or do anything, and then Tony shifted back as he asked, “Do you want me to let you go?” his voice gentle and even, and Steve nearly slumped down in relief at the fact that Tony wasn’t angry.
“Good, then I’m going to get ready for tomorrow.” Tony reached out and trailed his fingers down Steve’s cheek and under his chin, lifting his head slightly, and Steve held his breath and stayed as still as possible until Tony pulled away. “I’ll have JARVIS order something for lunch, so if you’re in the mood for anything in particular, you should let him know.” He looked at Steve for a long moment, eyes seemingly searching for something.

If you’d like to win a fic from me—I’ll write either a new fic or expand on a drabble or promise to write Nostalgia only until it’s finished (and not like wander back into the ST fandom which I know is going to happen, ugh, Bones) or whatever—please bid.  <3
“Okay, I’m almost ready to start,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve can hear him sit down on the stool. “Now, I’m going to narrate as I go, so you know what to expect. Feel free to ask me anything, and if you need me to stop, just let me know.”
Tony enjoyed the stunned look on Steve’s face, probably a little too much really, but who could blame him? Steve and a fucking machine. A machine that Tony had built for him.
“I know that Ms. Romanov and Mr. Barton have come through the DC office,” she said, finally lowering the magazine. “I don’t know if you spoke with either of them, however.”
Of course, since Steve was blindfolded, it made him startle and tense up, and he moaned as the vibrator went faster in reaction.
Tony snuffled his hair in seeming apology, licking gently at the back of Steve’s neck and shoulders until he started to relax, and only then did he gradually begin sitting back, Steve groaning as he adjusted to a position they both could be comfortable in.
, was looking and not even making a pretense of watching the opening sequence, which Steve could hear faintly on his left. It was nowhere near the normal level of loudness that Tony preferred, which meant Tony had lowered the sound when he’d set everything up.
“You okay, Steve? You feel really tense,” Dr. Stark says, pulling out slightly before pressing back in, deeper this time, and Steve sucks in a hissing breath and grabs onto the blankets for something to hold onto, his ass clenching down like he can keep Dr. Stark out. He can’t, not like this. He doesn’t even want to, no matter how intense the stretch is. He doesn’t remember thinking Dr. Stark had exceptionally thick fingers, but he must because it feels like Dr. Stark skipped one finger and went straight to two or even three.
of being helpful, especially when it’s revealed that Tony’s wearing a tight, white tank top underneath, which does absolutely nothing to conceal his firm chest. Or trim waist. Or defined biceps. (Steve wants to object, because what the fuck are Tony’s biceps? He’s a
Thank you to MetaAllu who was so hopeful in getting this chapter to make sense and for all the cheerleading. *snuggles forever*
Steve rubbed his jaw, looking away from Tony.  He didn’t have much experience at being the breakup-er versus the breakup-ee, had a tendency to hold on to people long after he should’ve let them go, and the blank expression on Tony’s face wasn’t helping.  Like he didn’t know Tony’s tells by that point.  Like he couldn’t figure out he was hurting him.
He feels horrible, and he knows he’s a bad person for enjoying the situation, but it’s not like he has any other choice. He really did come in because he’s having problems, and he’s just trying to do as he’s told.
The blanket slid off at some point, and he’d mourn the loss of Dr. Stark’s scent, but he’s more worried about how hard and fast he’s breathing, how he’s advertising how close he is again. Once had been bad enough. He desperately wants to hold off from coming again, but as the seconds tick by, Dr. Stark doesn’t stop, and Steve’s starting to sound high and strained.
Except when he walks outside, it’s not Happy waiting for him, but Steve, standing in front of a Prius, and of course he drives a Prius.  Of course he does.
Tony’s parents are alive, so it’s not his father’s, and there’s the possibility that it could be one of his grandfathers’ rings maybe, or another relative’s, but Tony never talks about his family, so that seems unlikely.
It was … completely inappropriate and outrageous and painfully true to character, and Steve wasn’t surprised at all when what started as a hesitant chant of Tony’s name quickly became a roar.
As with everything Tony had ever done, it was a performance, Tony slowly and majestically descending from the heavens in the Iron Man suit, his face uncovered so people could see him with his arms outstretched at his side. The allusion to Jesus Christ couldn’t be more obvious, and Steve thought,
Tony’s jaw ached by the time he stopped, and his tongue was numb, and getting to his feet took a lot of willpower, luck, and holding onto the wall since his legs were half-asleep, but he managed it. He was still doing better than Steve, who was a shivery mess and looked dazed and like he would’ve fallen down if the wall weren’t holding him up.
“I believe you,” Steve said quietly, too late and to an empty room, but promising himself that this time, it’d be true.
He doesn’t know how long it lasts—a few seconds realistically, but it feels longer. It feels like an eternity that he’s splayed open and pitiful, his ass aching and covered in slick. He does know that it’s too quiet, though. Dr. Stark doesn’t say anything, and Steve can’t yet, too mortified to do anything except try and slow his heaving breaths, and he only accomplishes that much because the drape keeps him from seeing whatever expression is on Dr. Stark’s face.
Steve gave a quick inhale at his words, and when Tony would’ve moved away, Steve kept him there as if it were his right, which, that had been what Tony had been trying to teach him, so, fair.
If Steve had gotten caught up in the heat of the moment, however, maybe he’d conflated the desire for forgiveness with the desire for
,” Steve said, and even though he’d only heard it once before, Tony thought he could recognize the note in his voice that meant he was about to come, so he eased off a little. He honestly didn’t know if Steve’s leg would keep him upright if he orgasmed, and while Tony could catch him, it wouldn’t be without some collateral damage, which was the reason—the only reason, and not because Tony wanted Steve out of his mind, really—that made him keep winding Steve up, getting him close enough to orgasm that
“I know it seems like something … horrible has happened,” Tony said, trying to be gentle, although it was difficult for Steve to appreciate at the moment. “It’s never a good feeling when your partner tells you you’ve pushed them too hard somehow, and I’m sorry that—”
He didn’t have anything against them exactly—except for the four, no, five, that had managed to sneak into a public restroom, garage, Starbucks, hotel room and restaurant just before they were about to go into heat in the hopes of trapping him into a Bond—but he hated the assumption that just because he was an Alpha, that meant that he needed kids and a loving Omega to go home to.  Like the best thing for him was to find his “
Tony was quiet for a long time, and he rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You were so tense at the end,” he said finally.
I always like to post something around my birthday, and normally I’d post a chapter of Nostalgia, but I decided to go with Fever this year. Feel free to give me all the kudos and comments as a present … ;)
now. Maybe the spellcaster had done it to make him appear more monstrous and thus, less likely to find someone willing to sleep with him, but he was enormous. Steve was sure that if he’d been braced for it, he wouldn’t have fallen, but when was the last time he’d been on guard around Tony?
Dr. Stark is just so handsome. Gorgeous really. Panty-meltingly hot are the words Sam used, although Sam was mostly teasing, since he knows Steve has a type. It doesn’t make the description any less true, though, and Steve has the worst crush on him.
“Tony.” He was surprised at himself for interrupting, but he honestly couldn’t listen to Tony trying to make him
And to add insult to injury—seriously, he was going to have so many bruises tomorrow—Steve made it all look ridiculously easy. Like there was something wrong with
Maybe Tony had been taking things too fast. Or maybe he’d been taking them too slowly. Steve was in his early twenties—plus or minus seventy years—and what if he’d been assuming they were going to jump into sex? Tony knew he had a reputation, well-deserved at that, and it wouldn’t be the first time someone had been interested in him because of the things he could do for them. In Steve’s case, Tony had already figured out Steve was looking for someone to show him the ropes, and maybe he was getting frustrated by the speed they were going. Fuck, had he been worrying about getting Steve comfortable enough to hug him on his own when Steve had been hoping for a good beating and being thrown over the back of the couch?
The thing was, Tony got it.  He really did.  It was a fucked up situation for the both of them, and Steve was exerting his independence in whatever way he could.  Maybe it wasn’t the smartest move to pull on a new Dom, particularly since Steve had no way of knowing how he’d react, but then again, if Steve riled him up enough to make Tony lash out, well, that’d prove that Tony was a major fucking dick, just like everyone else, worse even, and at least Steve would know.
“Can you imagine how uncomfortable that’d be after a while? After the first orgasm even. You’re all finished and so, so sensitive, but it doesn’t stop. It doesn’t even slow down. It just keeps fucking you, over and over again, and you just have to lie there and take it, because there’s nothing you can do. And eventually it starts feeling good again, slowly but surely, but you know that it’s just going to be worse the next time,” Tony said, and Steve was barely able to hold back a shiver at his words, at the image they were painting in his mind. “So maybe you try to keep it together. As long as you don’t orgasm, it’ll still feel good, right? So maybe you squirm around a little so it’s not getting you just right, or you try to concentrate really hard on the itch on your foot in order to distract you, but eventually, you can’t fight it anymore, and that’s the second orgasm. But what about the third one, or the fourth? Because there’s going to be another one and another one after that; my design won’t get tired, after all, won’t get bored—although, who would in this case—so it doesn’t matter how long you can stand it. I would wreck you,” Tony said, his fingers brushing against Steve’s throat as Tony pulled his hand away, making Steve swallow convulsively.
He made a humiliatingly breathy sound as Tony’s touch turned slicker as it traveled up the back of thigh, and he couldn’t stop the shiver as Tony painted him in trails of come.
just from looking that something’s happening. Is that what you want, Steve? For someone to know what I’m doing to you?”
“I’m fine,” he said and stole one quick glance at the two of them, Mr. Martin’s head in his Domme’s lap. They’d been held captive for almost five months by a terrorist group called ARES, only allowed to see each other once a week as long as she continued to do work on the biological weapons ARES was interested in. She’d resisted initially. Her husband had paid the price.
“Get up on your feet now, but your head needs to stay on the ottoman,” Tony said after some interminable time, and Steve could hear how distracted he was, Steve just an afterthought, and he had to tell himself that it was because he was being punished, that Tony would want him otherwise.
Because Tony had never been able to do anything if it wasn’t over the top, he interrupted the mayor during his commemorative speech as thousands of people started to point and shout. The mayor unsuccessfully tried to push his bodyguards away as he joined in on the staring, but they ushered him off the stage quickly, and Steve didn’t bother keeping track of him after that.
with this guy, and Tony had the strongest urge to get away, to leave as fast as his truck could take him, no matter if it meant abandoning all his things and running off without even saying goodbye to the people who’d taken care of him when he’d stumbled into town, alone and penniless.
His eyes skittered to the side, for his sake or Steve’s, or maybe both. “I want you to know that I don’t expect anything . . .  sexual . . . from you,” he said, cringing internally but determined to get the words out, no matter how blunt and tactless they came across.
