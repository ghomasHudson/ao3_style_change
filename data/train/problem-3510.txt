Dean paused; his mind had gone blank. Cas was gazing at him intently. In the end Dean just shrugged his shoulders giving a hasty response, “So how long you willing to do this for?”
Dean stayed silent for a minute, not really responding to Sam’s words of comfort or the hug- though he did appreciate both.
Castiel blushed slightly at the compliment but took it with a nod. He leant on the door frame, resting his hand on the door in preparation to bid the elder goodbye but instead of departing the man reached into his basket. It took him a while to fumble through it but eventually he pulled something out. A bright red apple which he held out in the palm of his hand in Cas’s direction.
“Prince Castiel is not dead,” Crowley said, his voice low, “Through the woods and in a clearing, there stands the hunters house. Prince Castiel dwells there.”
Lucifer took another bite out of his apple, before slowly turning to face the mirror once more. His eyes focused on Crowley’s face, a clear build-up of rage within them.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, his words coming out as a choked sob. The colour drained from his face and tears he was trying ever so hard to hold back, pricking his eyes. “I’m so sorry, Cas.”
Cas instantly noticed Charlie due to her vibrant hair and wandered over to her, expecting her to be with the girl she was with earlier. Instead, he found her alone, cradling a shot glass in her hand.
So...Dean and Cas have started their act and are telling their friends, this can only go well right? And will Dean's comments finally push Sam and Eileen together?
Cas and Dean’s fingers brushed against each other when they both reached for the salt, earning a knowing glance from Eileen. The contact sent a shiver down Cas’s spine, the butterflies remained in the pit of his stomach. There was an awkwardness over the meal, everyone still in shock over Cas and Dean’s revelation. Cas’s doubt was beginning to set in once more.
Castiel whistled whilst he worked. Washing the pots and pans until they glimmered. Hanging the clothes up on pegs around the room and storing anything that seemed out of place in a grand wooden chest that sat by the door. By the time he was done he felt rather exhausted. Castiel fell back on a chair almost breathless. He pulled off his royal blue jacket and hung it on the back. It was quite dirty after his adventure and he’d have to clean it when he had the time. Castiel had positioned the small wooden chair he had sat on so that he could look out of the window. So, he could have an inkling of when Dean was back. The sky outside was almost pitch black and a few stars sparkled in the deep night. Stars were another thing Castiel had always been mesmerised by. The way they shone so brightly and lit up the night sky. Constellations making pretty patterns. He’d learnt that the stars could be used as a guide to lead someone home. He wondered if Dean was following them.
At that moment his phone began ringing. An upbeat remediation of 'Under Pressure' started playing and Dean’s photo was gazing at him through the screen. Cas sighed again, reluctantly answering the call.
It was too late when it dawned on him that he had been tricked. When he realised it wasn’t a lost, old beggar he had just helped out. The last thing Castiel’s mind went to was Dean. It always went back to Dean. And then everything went black.
Crowley trailed off as an image began to project itself onto the glass. The mirror displayed a view from outside the Castle, within the grounds, focusing on a small and rusty Well. The sun shone brightly in the sky and glimmered off the water from inside it. An array of colourful birds were perched on the roof of the well. They were singing a blissful song and attentively paying attention to someone. A figure of a young man now became visible on the mirror. He was knelt down, beside the well. Lucifer rolled his eyes already knowing who it was. Jealousy sieging control of him.
“I’m so sorry...are we supposed to bow, Your Highness?” A girl with bright red hair asked. She started to tilt her body slightly, as though she was already prepared to courtesy.
“Dean, we need to clear some things up first,” he replied, leaning forward. His voice almost becoming a whisper, “I mean have you even considered the fact we’ll have to fake it in front of our friends? Your brother?”
“When do you think he’ll be coming to inform me about how him and his friends little hunt went? I like to know about these things seen as I am the one that sanctions them and helps provide them with the resources...”
“About how it might be time for you to find someone? A princess perhaps to marry?” Lucifer pressed, “A true love?”
Cas was slightly lost in his thoughts when he felt a firm hand on his shoulder. He quickly turned his head to see Dean hovering next to him. His deep green eyes staring into Cas’s own blue eyes. There was a mild stench of alcohol coming off of Dean, and Cas was unsure about how much his friend had drunk.
“Now how I get rid of him...that is the pressing question,” Lucifer spun around once more and glanced at the array of objects on his desk. He let out a small hum as he lifted his hands up and began to tap his fingers together. His pupils darted back and forth around the table and he let out a cackle before fixating on one specific item. Lucifer stepped forward and reached out towards it.
Castiel lie asleep on the floor. To anyone who came across him, the young Prince would appear dead. His brother, Lucifer, stood cackling over his body.
It wasn’t long before something caught Castiel’s eye. A flash travelling across the sky. It was a shooting star.
"Hair as dark as ebony and lips like a pink rose. Eyes as blue as the ocean and a heart of angelic gold. Everybody in the land loves him, because he is the sweetest of all. The fairest. The most handsome in the land. It is Castiel...”
“Yes...he...I...” Dean stumbled over his words; he didn’t want to admit it but he also didn’t want to believe whatever lie Crowley was trying to tell, “Yes he is. I’ve seen him. I found him. I can’t get the image out of my head.”
Once upon a time, in a far away land, there lived a jealous King, a handsome Prince and the bravest hunter around.
“But after I’ve spoken to Sam, we can catch up...if you want?” Dean asked, rolling his shoulder. “Hopefully, uninterrupted this time.”
Charlie extravagantly pointed at Sam and Eileen who both raised a hand in greeting, as she continued to chatter away.  Castiel raised his eyebrows and smiled back but was unable to speak due to the amount of food in his mouth. Castiel found it funny how he’d thought Sam looked so familiar earlier but had failed to put two and two together. Sam really did remind him of Dean, mannerisms and all. Castiel couldn’t remember if Dean had ever mentioned having a brother before, even just in passing. He felt like a bad friend for not knowing and was beginning to realise he really didn’t know much about his best friend at all. Well, other than the fact he was a hunter and he had the most beautiful green eyes Castiel had ever seen. Eyes which sometimes he could just get lost in, staring into a virescent sea. Or the fact Castiel could always tell when Dean was nervous, as he’d run his hand through his silky brown hair and let out a small chuckle. So, maybe he did know some things about Dean, just not the most important things. Or maybe he just found his best friend mildly attractive.
“You actually did it,” Lucifer commented, observing the organ, “I didn’t believe you had it in you.”
Dean surveyed their surroundings once more; it was too busy here. Someone could overhear. Instead of replying, he carefully grabbed Castiel’s wrist and lead him down a path, away from the Castle. Dean walked at an increasingly fast pace, so much so that a confused Castiel struggled to keep up.
Dean ran down the corridor, towards the main castle gates, tumbling past a confused Charlie and Sam.
Hey! I hope you guys are enjoying this so far, this chapter is a bit longer than others and I hope it isn't too much!
“Sorry, I um...I didn’t mean to leave you...” Cas trailed off and noticed Sam and Eileen has stopped their conversation and were now watching himself and Charlie. Charlie was now stood with her arms folded, tapping her foot on the floor. She raised her eyebrow, seemingly waiting for more answers from Cas. Answers she was sure to get sooner or later. Charlie was about to speak up once more but was cut off by Sam.
“It’ll work, I’m sure of it,” Dean continued, slowly pulling the dagger out of his holster, “It has too.”
Castiel felt tears start to prick his eyes and rubbed them gently with his fingertips. Dean had noticed and carefully reached towards him, placing a consoling hand upon his leg.
Lucifer drummed his fingers against his arm, his grin ever growing as he was prepared to hear Crowley finally credit him.
“I just want to...I want to see Lucifer and know what he did,” Dean heaved out almost exasperated, “I don’t even want to kill him myself... I... just need to know.”
Dean closed his eyes and held the silver in his palm, squeezing it tightly. He took a second to gather his thoughts and project his wish before throwing his coin into the well and waited for the distinctive splash, as a signal to open his eyes again. Castiel did a similar routine, however he waited until he heard Dean’s coin land in the water before throwing his. After he had finished, he turned back towards Dean, who was already staring at him. Castiel pulled a face- eyebrows raised, cheesy grin, which Dean could already read.
“I never knew my parents. They died when I was young...or that’s what Lucifer always said,” Castiel paused, realising citing his untrustworthy brother wasn’t the best source, “Me and my brother is all it’s ever been, all I’ve ever known. I guess being Prince I never really thought there was anything else, I just assumed most people live this way. You never talked about your parents...I guess I thought everyone was in the same boat. Alone.”
“So, it was you guys following me?” he asked, letting out a relived sigh, “Well, whilst you’re all here...don't suppose any of you know where I can find a cottage?”
“I know,” Castiel said in an attempt to comfort Dean, before reaching back towards him to grab the sleeves of Dean’s shirt that he’d previously let go of. Dean exhaled once more, shaky and unsure.
The rest of the birds fluttered their wings and began to cheerfully tweet in response. Castiel raised his eyebrows slightly, flashing a shy smile back at the birds. He loved nature, it made him happy and almost saw it as a home. He felt safe around the animals, like they were the only things he could talk too. He liked their company and they seemed to adore his. Castiel began to hum along to the tune of the bird’s songs. Creating a relaxing atmosphere. Losing sense of where he was. Losing sense of time.
“It’s quite simple really, just keep going down that road,” Castiel said pointing towards the path he had once taken to get here, “Just stick on the path and don’t get distracted and you’ll find your way to the town.”
Lucifer and Castiel sat at opposite ends of the table for dinner, which they rarely even ate together. The long table had countless amounts of empty chairs, making the whole scenario seem daunting to an outsider. Lucifer usually sat on a throne at the head of the table, showing off his power and emphasising to his brother who is in charge. Castiel normally is seated as far away as possible, otherwise Lucifer feels threatened by his presence.
“Donna does make a mean pie,” Dean said, his voice cracking slightly. He awkwardly beckoned for Castiel to follow with his head and after a moment of consideration Cas decided he would. They both trudged over to the group and Charlie cheered when she saw them. Everyone was laughing at something dumb Sam had said. Dean instantly burst into hysterics and not long after Castiel ended up laughing too. Donna handed them both bowls with large helpings of the pie and Castiel watched as Dean’s face lit up. The rest of the night was a blur. Everyone exchanging stories. Sharing the love.
“And now, a special sort of death for one you say is so fair,” he trailed off, before placing the remnants of the apple in his cauldron, “A poisoned apple.”
Dean didn’t know what he had expected to hear, but that was certainly not it. He let out a sigh and decided to store it with the many other bizarre things that had happened today, then strode towards Castiel’s bed, expecting Crowley to leave the room. He didn’t.
Dean barrelled out of the Castle walls and made his way along the cobbled path towards the village. He could hear the footsteps of his friends behind him, trying to keep up. Night had crept upon them and their surroundings were dark and dimly lit, but the sky was clear. Cloudless. Dean looked up and noticed a dozen stars and constellations watching over. Glimmering in the darkness, like guiding lights. Dean wondered if there were any shooting stars, so he could make a wish. Not that he really believed in all that, his wish from the well hadn’t come true yet. But Castiel believed in the magic of wishing and that was enough for Dean. And if a true loves kiss turned out to be real and curse breaking, then Dean might just end up believing anything.
Dean zoned out for a moment, focusing more on Castiel’s appearance than the words that were tumbling from his mouth. There was an innocent glimmer in his eyes which Dean caught and it caused a twinge in his stomach.
“Your highness, your charms and wits are among the best in the land. There are very few who are fairer than you,” Crowley’s started to scramble his words, he began to speak in riddles in an attempt to avoid telling Lucifer the truth, “But there is one...one that I see...”
“I have to get rid of him,” he muttered under his breath, just loud enough for Crowley to hear. He was slowly rubbing his finger against his chin as he battled with countless ideas in his head.
Castiel slumped back in his chair and chuckled, his eyes exploring the concern etched on Dean’s face.
Dean stood outside the gigantic wooden Castle doors. He peered up at them, intimidated by the magnitude of the place, which he’d rarely seen up close. All he could focus on was the pounding of his heart and the rush of blood in his ears. There was blood splashed over the top of Dean’s dagger and some dried on his sleeves. His hands which were shaking as he held onto the box Lucifer had given to him. A few guards appeared to escort him inside and Dean did his best to hide the splattered mess, to not raise any suspicions.
“I will go myself and finish this,” he said, “I will disguise myself so no one will suspect a thing. Not a hunter. Not Dean. And definitely not Castiel.”
“I’ve also heard it is one of the sweetest apples around. Divine,” The man continued, “So why don’t you take a bite?”
Lucifer’s back was now arched and he slowly crept over to pick up his final ingredient. It was the green apple he had been eating the other day. It had remained on the floor. Battered, bruised and rotting. He held it up carefully, like it was the most delicate and priceless item in the world.
Castiel let out another long yawn and realised he was blinking hard to even keep his eyes open. He glanced around at the beds once more and noticed initials were carved into the headrests. One specifically stood out to him.
“You could’ve told me you were back. You’re my best friend and I was worried sick!” Castiel exclaimed, trying to catch Dean’s eye but Dean still refused to give him the contact.
“I’ve just lost the person I love,” Dean replied, fairly blunt. His voice void of any emotion, “I don’t think I’ll ever be alright again.”
He reached to his side and picked up Castiel’s pillow, brining it close to his chest. Dean hugged it tightly and started to close his eyes. He was tired and before long he was starting to drift off to sleep. A thousand thoughts raced around in his head, but the only one that mattered, the only thing he cared about, was that he knew Castiel was safe.
Dean pulled away from the hug and started to fiddle with the sleeves of his shirt. Sam looked down at his brother, he knew Dean was hurting and he wanted to help but nothing he could say or do would change the situation.
“I think you’re a good actor,” Dean observed in relation to the situation. Cas looked back puzzled. “Which...is a good thing if we want to make this seem real.”
“Thank you,” Castiel interjected, slowly pushing himself. He was slightly groggy and rubbed his forehead before bringing his arms back down beside himself. His hand brushed against Dean’s and both men blushed but instead of avoiding eye contact like usual, they turned to face each other.
“I wish you well, Mr Winchester,” Lucifer said, taking another sip from his wine glass. Dean stood up, out of the chair, and hastily made his way towards the door. He needed to get out of the room fast, any longer and it would start becoming hard to breathe. Dean lifted his hand towards the door handle.
“Where are you going?” Sam called out to him, almost uncertain whether he should follow his brother.
Charlie had leant forward resting her elbows on the table the wide grin plastered on her face. She eyed up Sam and Eileen before turning a new attention to Dean and Cas. “I mean, I’d presume you two are going together,” she said with a glimmer in her eye.
“I’m sorry, you know I’m not good at apologising,” Dean replied and Cas could almost hear the puppy dog eyes he was certain Dean was pulling on the other end of the phone. Imagining that made Cas blush and he knew he couldn't stay mad at his best friend for a second longer.
“I’m always here. You just don’t notice,” came Gabriel’s reply, he didn’t take his eyes off his laptop screen, “I told you I have no friends, apart from Anael, so I like to spend my time here. It’s peaceful, I can write and I’m helping out a local business.”
“Just one thing,” Dean uttered into Castiel’s hair, pressing a kiss against the top of his head. “You.”
Dean looked up, the sun was trying to peak out from behind the clouds but was trapped, causing the sky to be shrouded in a cape of darkness.
There was a bit of laughter from the end of the bed and Castiel shot his head in that direction. It was coming from the red-haired girl who was flashing him a cheesy grin.
Castiel examined the fruit. It was larger than most apples he’d seen before and had a shine to it that made it glimmer in the sun. Castiel noticed that it was the only red apple from the basket which contained a sea full of green ones. The old man had picked up on Castiel wandering eye as well.
“Of course, brother. He’s all yours,” Dean turned back towards Castiel and pulled a face full of confusion and distrust. “Just go with him,” Castiel whispered, just loud enough for Dean to hear.
“So why were you late?” She questioned again, sounding like the mother hen that they all knew she was. Cas sighed, and replied with what Dean had begged and begged for him to say on the way there. He didn’t even know how Dean had made him agree to this, but eventually he had. Albeit reluctantly.
The King ventured into his lair, speeding up the spiralled staircase, throwing open the door. He smiled to himself when he noticed the box was still sat on the table and then turned to face the mirror.
“Surprised you came back in one piece,” Castiel teased, before pausing, “Wait, how long have you been back?”
“Sorry if I’m slightly late,” Castiel exclaimed, slightly out of breath himself, but beaming warmly towards the hunter, “There was just this rabbit in the gardens and she was lost. You know me, I made it my mission to help find her mother. Oh, Dean you should’ve seen them when they were reunited...”
“I just want to say again how sorry I am...” Dean said, trailing off, “For leaving you to go talk to Lisa and for what I said to her, and probably for other things I can’t even remember.”
“One Coke coming up for the most boring person in the room. The most boring person I know,” Dean joked, quite loudly, stepping back from the table and almost tripping over his own feet.
Castiel leant forward and pushed the window open onto the latch. The cool summer breeze rushed inside and Castiel closed his eyes for a moment to take it all in. Letting it blow against his face. He smiled before opening his eyes again and glancing out of the window once more.
Crowley watched on as this continued for a few minutes, as Lucifer went from his pacing to flickering through the amass of books lying on his table top. He was focused and searching for something specific, Crowley daren’t ask a single question. He did not want to be involved in Lucifer’s plot, nor did he want to incriminate Castiel even more.
“I’m sure Cas will be fine, Dean,” he stated, a calming tone in his voice, “I know you worry about him, all the time. I do too, though I’m not sure it’s the same...but I am sure he can handle himself.”
“I know he can,” Dean heaved out, his voice cracking as he spoke, “I just feel helpless. I want to protect him from that son of a bitch and I know Cas is no damsel in distress but...I’d do anything for him...To keep him safe.”
Castiel now held the apple between both his hands and was staring at it with full intent. He was so focused on the apple that he didn’t notice the maniacal grin spreading across the senior’s face. The voice in Castiel’s head was now screaming at him to stop but before he even realised what he was doing he brought the apple closer to his lips. If the man was telling the truth all he had to do was make a simple wish. He knew what he wanted; it was something he also knew would never actually happen. Something he could never have. But if the apple was magic then maybe...maybe his wish could finally come true.
“Hello there, Dean,” he mused, rubbing his hands together slowly, “Did you see the nice surprise I left for you?”
The conversation died down a bit after that. Sam and Eileen were speaking to each other about some important private matters and Charlie was busy cleaning her knife collection. Castiel slowly finished his meal and then decided that he was once again going to clean up for these people. After all, it was the least he could do to show his gratitude.
Dean’s words were finally starting to sink in. He had to go for his safety, but he was having to leave his people behind. He was leaving them under his brother’s terrifying reign and without him being there to stop Lucifer, there were no limits to the harsh laws he could impose. It hurt Castiel to know he was leaving a town full of defenceless people under the rule of a tyrant and more so that they would be mourning him whilst he was still alive.
Castiel lifted another finger and began to delicately stroke the bird's chest, gently ruffling her feathers. The bird began to pleasantly coo in response, which made his smile grow even more.
“Oh hello, young man,” he said upon Castiel’s presence. The man looked Castiel up and down before speaking once more, “I’m awfully sorry to bother you but I seem to have gotten lost, I was wondering if you could direct me on my way.”
“Wow, I didn’t see that coming...I thought he’d...” she paused, “I thought he was over that and has moved on...”
Dean’s voice started to break and it was clear if he said anything else the barriers would break down completely and he couldn’t have that. He needed to put on a brave face for Castiel-he was the one in real danger. His life was more important. His life was on the line.
Sam and the others arrived shortly after to see the shocking sight on their doorstep. Everyone stayed back gaping in shock and sadness. Sam brought Eileen and Charlie into a close hug, looking on at his brother. Dean was broken. He no longer had any tears left to cry and rubbed his eyes. He gulped and slowly pushed himself up off the floor- avoiding eye contact with anyone.
“What a nice...box,” Crowley commented to try deviate the tension from the situation, “What exactly are you going to do?”
Dean fumbled around in his pockets, looking for his fake ID. It was cold outside and he’d rather be inside the bar with his friends than stuck outside in the dark, but the fairly impatient looking bouncer in front of him was certain on not letting Dean in without proof of identification.
Dean stormed down the hallways of the Castle. The past few days had been the only times he’d actually been inside and it seemed just as big and confusing as he imagined. He knew he was likely to end up getting lost as he trailed down one corridor and climbed up a set of stairs towards another. Dean wondered about Castiel’s opinion of the place, growing up trapped within the walls with only the guards and an evil brother for company. He told himself to ask the Prince if he saw him again.
“Hey,” Charlie responded, “I was beginning to think you were ignoring me or something. Where’d you go last night? You were there one second and the next you were gone!”
Lucifer turned away, without response, he was headed to the countless stairs that lead back up to his secret quarters.
“Yeah, you two can go together and then you can all finally help me find a girlfriend to go with!” Charlie exclaimed, clapping her hands with excitement. Everyone laughed at Charlie’s statement. It was a known fact that Charlie desperately wanted a girlfriend but no matter how hard they tried to find her the right person, something always seemed to fall in the way. Dean recounted the time he’d tried to get Charlie with one of his own exes, Anna Milton, and he was sure it would’ve been a great match until Anna spent more time talking about Dean and an apparent hatred, she now had for him, than paying any attention to Charlie. So maybe Dean wasn't the best match maker and maybe he and Anna had not ended on good terms.
Castiel lay in a glass coffin, in the centre of the village, where all his people could see and mourn him. The hunters had already brought him there, before Dean and Sam had arrived home from their encounter with Lucifer, so the two brothers had to trudge even further in their sodden clothes. Dean still didn’t really speak, no matter what Sam was saying to him. He was too shellshocked, too overwhelmed by everything. Dean just wanted to drink, just wanted to sleep and wake up to this whole week being a bad dream. But he knew it was real and there was nothing he could do.
Cas pushed open the door to the small coffee shop which Anael, a family friend, owned. It was a snug building, and wasn’t overly busy. He’d come here immediately after hanging up his phone, ignoring the ping of texts from Dean. Cas had decided he needed some advice and Anael always seemed to tell him exactly what he needed to hear.
“Are you find with PDA?” Dean asked. Cas nodded in response without looking up, barely even taking in Dean’s words. “Well, all we have to do really is hold hands but if that’s okay in your ‘ground work’ or whatever then...”
“Ouch,” he mumbled to himself, peering at the sleeves of his shirt which were now covered in dirt and small remnants of blood. He glanced around at his surroundings once more, slightly dazed.
Dean paused, before reaching into his holster and pulling out his dagger. Without hesitation or even much thought he threw it. The dagger tumbled from the sky down to the ground below where it landed on a heap of rocks with a metallic clash.
“Hey,” he said, reaching out towards Castiel and gently placing a hand of reassurance on his shoulder. Castiel flickered his attention between the hand and Dean’s face, softening up at just the mere touch.
They both looked around the space before their eyes landed on the bright red hair of Charlie. She was stood up and eagerly waved at them. Dean and Cas made their way over to the table and Cas sat himself down in a gap besides Sam and Eileen. Dean remained standing and put his hand on the table.
Castiel opened his mouth but before he could speak up the hunter had already disappeared, off into the distance. He had never seen Dean move so fast and Castiel found himself admiring the lean outline of the man. The way his shirt hung loosely off his back and how his...
Lisa would most likely being going too, so there they could carry out the reason why they had even agreed to do this in the first place. The reasons Cas believed they were doing this. And in this month, he could spend plenty of time with Cas, because after they inevitably pretend to break up from their fake relationship, it would seem weird if they hung out as much immediately after.
“I need a drink,” he uttered, bluntly. He wanted to look around see if any tavern was even open but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Castiel. He looked so peaceful, surrounded by a bed of colourful flowers-the nature that he so dearly loved.
Castiel ambled over to the bed and perched himself on the edge of the mattress. He carefully pulled off his boots, and placed them to the side before sliding his legs on top of the sheet. Then he reached forward and pulled the blanket over his body, wriggling downwards as he did so, snuggling up against it. He closed his eyes and started to drift off.
“I won’t fall in love with you if every time you drink...” he trailed off before pointing to Dean’s upper lip, “...you do that.” There sat a line of frothy foam from his drink, which looked like a creamy moustache. It took a moment for Dean to realise what Cas meant but then his eyes lit up when it hit him sending Cas into laughter once more.
Dean tilted his head. He didn’t know this man. Didn’t want to believe a word he was saying and yet something in his gut was telling him, he should listen.
Dean started to make his way over to the bed which was situated centrally. Trailing his fingers across the walls and a desk as he went. He almost fell onto Castiel’s bed when he reached it, his legs giving away from the stress that the day had brought him. He flopped back and gazed up at the ceiling that Castiel would’ve stared at so many times. A ray of sunlight peered through the window as the sun began to set upon the horizon. Dean was just going to lay here, and gather his thoughts together. Then he would find a way to sneak out of the castle so he could go back to his family.
The sun began to peer through a gap in the curtains and the birds were singing a cheery, early morning song. Castiel stretched his arms up above his head before slowly opening and rubbing his eyes. For a moment he had forgotten where he even was, until the memories of yesterday came crashing back too him. He groaned, realising he'd fallen asleep for longer than he had intended too, before opening his eyes.
“I’m not going to; I hope you know that. I’m not going to do what he says,” Dean finally said, immediately looking to reassure Castiel, “I have a plan and you’re going to be fine; I promise. You’re my best friend, just know that I could nev...”
Castiel reluctantly glanced around at where they were. Properly absorbing the surroundings for the first time. He had never been this far out of the Castle walls. He had never seen the forest this close up and never in his dreams had he imagined this would be the situation where he’d get a chance to. It hadn’t even happened in his worst nightmares.
“You do know nothing has changed,” Crowley replied, his tone turning snarky, almost pleased, “Why do you keep asking a question that you already know the answer too?”
Dean sighed and started to make his way over to Lucifer who stood there, pleased with himself. Dean raised a reluctant hand up to Castiel, to say bye, which he mimicked in response.
This startled the boys, who instantly tore their gazes away from each other. Castiel frantically trying to find another spot to stare at and Dean acting like nothing had just happened.
“Here’s my ID,” Cas said holding out his fake credentials to the bouncer, “And here’s his. He left it in my car.”
Dean wasn’t back after five minutes and he wasn’t back after ten either. Cas turned on his phone, assuming the queues for ordering must have been long and opened up a text conversation with his brother, Gabriel.
“I need your help. Yes, this is to do with Lisa but not how you think...I just...I... I wasn’t thinking and I wanted to make her jealous...” Cas groaned and felt like walking away. He didn’t want to have to deal with this today. Of course, Dean wanted Lisa back. Of course, he’d probably grovelled to her about how much he missed her forgetting the mess he was in after the break up. Cas began to twist his body away but before he could even move seven words left Dean’s mouth. Seven of the most unexpected words.
Castiel felt like a bit of an outsider, but as the night drew on he felt more involved and it seemed the hunters really did enjoy his presence. They didn't treat him specially because he was royalty, and it wasn't like they owed him. They treat him normally. He wasn't Prince Castiel, he was just Cas and he liked that. He thought back to Dean’s words, how he'd been certain this was now his family too and it was. He finally felt home.
A smirk began to form across Lucifer’s lips as he let go of the box and in turn pushed it across the table to the hunter. Dean looked at it for a second, before slowly picking it up and stashing it under his arm.
“I didn’t know myself, until today. I was as surprised as you,” he manged to choke out. Lucifer raised his eyebrows, not fully believing the words that had left his brother's mouth.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “Was it not you who suggested we catch up later? I must've been mistaken..”
“That’s no way to treat your king,” Lucifer replied, his smirk the only thing visible through the mist.
Re writing parts of this au that are in the forms of texts and social media interactions is something I'm really enjoying but there is most likely grammatical errors, so for that I apologise.
Castiel gazed at the birds for a moment and then back at the apple which was now being pushed even closer towards him. The faintest of alarm bells were ringing in the back of Castiel’s head but for some reason he ignored them. For whatever reason he followed his heart instead of his head. He felt like taking the apple off the old man was the right thing to do, the politest way to go. Castiel reached forward and carefully picked it up. He could use it to make an apple pie, to thank the hunters for their hospitality. Dean liked pies; he could make is specially for him as a gift.
“We should, Sammy,” Dean replied, his voice quiet and empty, “And we should take Castiel home to his people too...to say goodbye.”
Cas nodded, “Well, you did actually manage to have foam all over your face, but normally I wouldn’t even tell you until we’re out in public. I’d let you try flirt with someone attractive and embarrass yourself,” Cas shrugged, nonchalantly, seeming proud of himself. “You were taking this whole thing seriously so I decided to up my game too.”
Cas shrugged his shoulders, “Well it feels like he wants to use me, even though he probably doesn’t. I mean he hasn’t even said it’s to get Lisa back, he just said it’s because news travelled fast but I’m not stupid. I can put two and two together.”
“You ever seen something so beautiful?” Castiel asked, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder and pointing up at the star, as it shot across the night sky leaving a trail of sparkling silver in its wake.
Dean wanted to reply and tell Castiel 'he did' but instead Dean turned away awkwardly, blushing once more. He wasn’t very good at taking compliments and decided instead to have a drink and let the conversation topic mull over to something else.
The trees towered high above and the wind whistled through their branches, causing leaves to tumble to the ground. Dean had to avoid standing on the crumpled leaf litter that coated the forest floor, as he had to be as silent as possible when searching for his prey. His hand was tightly clasped around the handle of his dagger which was rested in the holster against his hip. Dean scanned his surroundings carefully, ready to pounce at a single sound but the area was mostly silent. It had been a bad day for hunting, they’d been out for a few hours and there was not a single creature to be found. The sky was turning grey as the minutes ticked by, filling up with rain clouds which would dampen any effort of a hunt when the precipitation fell, and Dean had a funny feeling in his stomach. A strange overarching instinct in his gut that something was wrong, he just couldn’t put his finger on what.
“I need to find it...I need to find the spell,” Lucifer began to mumble on his breath. The candles flame flickered in the tense air and the silence was jarring. Lucifer skewered through multiple books, loose pages flying everywhere and the useless books tumbled to the ground with a loud thud. Eventually, however, he came across what he was looking for. His eureka moment. Lucifer smirked at Crowley once more.
Carefully Lucifer picked the object up off his desk. He rubbed the top of it carefully and grinned to himself. Then he turned back to the mirror and presented the item to Crowley. The room was desolate and dark, dimly lit by a single flame but Crowley could just about make out the object Lucifer was holding in his direction.
“Goodbye Dean,” he mumbled to himself before turning to face the great abyss that lay ahead, ready to begin his own journey. One that was full of adrenaline. One that was full of fear. He was off into the unknown.
I really liked focusing on the found family aspect of this chapter especially since the show decided to ignore the 'family doesn't end in blood' motto in the finale that I pretend doesn't exist!
Dean folded his arms over his chest, so tightly that it was almost like he was suffocating himself. Lucifer noticed this and stopped drumming his fingers against the table.
Sam swallowed hard but took his brothers words in and turned back to go collect the others. Dean kept running, all he could hear was the sound of his heart pumping heavily in his chest. He hopped over tree roots and almost struggled to keep his balance over the slippery cobbled pathways throughout the woodland. He could see the clearing coming up ahead, but he was already struggling to breathe. There was a pain in his abdomen, but he pushed on-ignoring it. All he could focus on was getting to Castiel. Seeing that he was okay. Time felt like it was going slower the closer he got.
When they arrived at the market square it was as busy as ever, but it wasn’t at all the same. It was much quieter, everyone was talking in hushed whispers and avoiding eye contact with each other. There was almost complete silence when people started to notice Dean, it made him uncomfortable. People knew how close he and Castiel were, they’d probably caught drift of Lucifer’s original plan somehow and now they were gossiping and gawping at him when all he wanted was to be alone and mourn.
It was early morning and the sun lay low in the sky. The breeze outside was cool and the flowers in the Palace gardens swayed. It may’ve been early but Castiel had already completed all his chores for the day. He’d started on them almost as soon as he had awoke and was now staring into the well once more, surrounded by his feathery friends. He was waiting for Dean.
Dean and Sam watched on shell shocked, unsure how to comprehend what had just happened. Dean had wanted to see Lucifer suffer, at one point today he’d wanted to kill Lucifer himself, but not like this. Lucifer needed to suffer for eternity for what he’d done, rot in some dungeons somewhere. He had gotten away with this and now Dean had to live with the pain forever.
He’d also had the stupid idea of letting everyone arrive on their own, in their own time so he couldn’t ask any of his friends for help as he didn’t know if they were already inside or not. And Sam had arrived with Eileen, so even his own brother couldn’t help him out.
Sorry that this chapter is a bit shorter than others, I was trying to categorise into chapters what I'd already written and felt like this ending was a good cut off point/cliff hanger.
Whilst their three friends began debating about when ‘Dean and Cas had happened,’ Dean tapped Cas shin with his foot to get his attention. Cas turned to see a smile spread across Dean’s face. He mouthed ‘good job’ to him before winking and turning away. Dean seemed to be good at keeping his cool in this situation and seemed perfectly able to lie to their friends. Cas, on the other hand, didn’t and was worried about when he’d crack. He didn’t really like lying to them. He felt bad. The only weight off his shoulders was that they’d never have to know the truth because in a month it’d be over. Dean would have Lisa and they could both pretend it had never happened. Dean must’ve sensed that Cas was anxious, as he placed a supportive hand on the top of his thigh.
Castiel and Dean exchanged a look. A lingering look. Dean’s tongue wet the top of his lip whilst Castiel watched Dean’s evergreen eyes. Dean’s grip on Cas’s leg tightened as his eyes flickered down to Castiel’s mouth. Castiel tilted his head slightly and began to lean forward. They were mere inches apart.
Dean turned to face Cas, who was staring at his phone screen. Cas held his phone up to Dean’s eye line so he could see the plethora of texts that Charlie had sent him, asking where they both were and informing them that they were late. Very late. The last text was a bit of cry for help as she apparently starting to feel very much like a ‘third wheel’. Dean chuckled to himself, imagining Charlie stuck alone with Sam and Eileen. The pair were probably just staring at each other longingly like usual and Charlie, no matter how much she wanted them together, probably wanted the ground to swallow her whole.
It was then, that out of the bush rolled a fox cub. Castiel raised his eyebrows. And then another one followed, and another. Castiel slowly unclenched his hand and took a step towards them. The three cubs bundled together at Castiel’s sudden movement and were ready to back off at any given moment.
Cas glanced out of the window beside them. The sun shone through onto the side of his face. His ocean blue eyes glimmered as they reflected the light and Dean noticed one of Cas’s curls had fallen onto his forehead. Dean sat back admiring his friend. Watching as the thoughts whirred through Cas’s head. He’d often done this, just observed Cas from a far. He didn’t know why he did it but he could never stop himself from doing so, every now and then his eyes would just linger on his best friend for longer than they probably should. Dean kept his focus on him until Cas promptly turned his head back and Dean in turn had to awkwardly look away.
Lucifer led Dean into the Castle’s dinning court. He sat himself on his throne at the head of the table before beckoning at Dean to take the closest seat. Dean hesitantly pulled the chair out and sat down, avoiding eye contact with Lucifer at all costs. The surroundings in the room itself were enough to make Dean feel on edge.
“Yeah, of course,” Castiel replied, still distracted, “And you can tell me how exactly you’ve managed to trick my brother and fake my death.  Just so I know that he won’t come knocking at the door trying finish the job himself.”
Cas had been surprised to find Dean at his door when he was about to set off to Benny’s. They hadn’t planned on arriving together but Dean had leant against Cas’s porch and with a wink claimed he’d wanted to be ‘chivalrous.’ Cas was surprised Dean even knew what the word meant. But he had eventually agreed that Dean had the right idea. If they really wanted to make people believe that they’re together, they had to act like a couple. Plus, a lift to Benny’s with Dean was a much better prospect than having to walk there alone.  And secretly Cas always enjoyed rides in Dean’s impala. He likes how it smells.
“Dean?” he questioned, but Dean didn’t stop until they reached a specific spot. It was a fork in the road. If you went one way the path led you straight back to the Village and Castle, the other led you deep into the woods. It was a barren route, not often used by the villagers. The shrubs and trees nearby it had become overgrown and it wasn’t well lit or labelled. Take this path and you were more than likely to get lost-unless somehow you knew the way.
“Dean, I don’t know what to say. You save me, you’re giving me a home...a family, if they want me, …and I know it’s because I’m a Prince or whatever...”
He was yet to tell Crowley of the young Prince’s demise, and couldn’t wait to finally hear the words leave the man in the mirror’s mouth. That King Lucifer was finally the fairest in the land.
Crowley swallowed a lump in his throat. He so badly wanted to lie. He wanted to protect the young Prince. But as part of his curse, the wretched curse of the magic mirror, he was unable to lie. Hesitantly, he shook his head in defeat.
Castiel raised his eyebrows and pulled a face which read as ‘I know, I know,’ causing Dean to laugh even more. Dean stepped back and glanced at the birds on the roof, they were all staring at him attentively. Observing Dean from a distance to judge his character and make sure he was safe for Castiel to be hanging around with.
“My ‘ground work’,” he replied, using air quotations, “Isn’t much at all. In fact, it is just one rule.”
His optimistic thoughts should’ve made things better, taking the anxiety off his mind about the situation. But something still didn't feel quite right, he just couldn’t put his finger on it. The butterflies fluttered around in his stomach once more.
Lucifer impatiently prowled around his lair, walking back and forth and back and forth. The constant clicking of his heels against the marbled floor soon became too much for Crowley, who Lucifer had summoned for help.
At that moment a firm hand was pressed against Cas’s shoulder, a touch that he was so familiar with. One he could feel himself melting into. But at the same time everything felt so much different, the situation so different.
There were now more sounds coming from the surrounding area. Castiel smiled as he noticed the arrival of each creature and paid intricate attention to each specific sound. The flapping wings of birds who started to land in the trees nearby. The hoot of an owl, old and wise, peering down at Castiel from the safe realms of his nest. Then there was the scampering paws of a squirrel scurrying around on the tree trunk behind him. The final sound was the clicking of hooves from a deer, who looked on from a short distance away. Castiel spun around, noticing all the animals and grinned. He felt at ease once more.
Sorry for not updating yesterday! I had a busy day and didn't have time to post. I've also started the second fic of this series, which is going to be a tangled au and I'll hopefully start posting it once I've finished uploading all of this fic.
Crowely tried to hold back a laugh and instead scoffed upon his realisation that the huntsman had managed to trick the all-powerful King.
Castiel almost dropped the bowl he was washing. He took a double take. Blinking hard and shaking his head, assuming his mind was playing a cruel trick on him. Castiel closed his eyes and slowly reopened them.
“You need to run. You need to hide,” Dean finally announced. Castiel’s expression instantly changing to something between confusion and horror.
“If it’s a curse set by the king, why hasn’t he woken up?” Dean asked, “The King’s dead. Shouldn’t his curse have ended like yours?”
Dean shook his head, and took another step away, down the stairs. He pulled the box from under his arm and squeezed it tightly, letting out his anger.
“So, are you ready to tell them, about ‘us’?” Dean said using air quotations just like Cas had done previously. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing it backwards whilst waiting for Cas’s response.
The silence and emptiness in the room were making things worse for Dean and all he could focus on were the voices screaming inside his head, trying to form a decent plan to get out of this mess. To save Castiel, because if he didn’t go along with this-he knew someone else would. He let out a shallow shaky breath and suddenly an idea began to formulate in his mind.
“Oh, cool, cool,” she finally replied before changing the topic, “Right, so you know we spoke about getting Sam and Eileen together, well I have a plan.”
Lucifer’s hands began to tremble as he placed the ingredients into the pot. He raised his voice as he continued to repeat the spell. Slowly, things were starting to change. His hair began to turn grey, his skin wrinkled up and his voice started to croak. A cloak shrouded over his shoulders, hiding his face which Crowley was thankful for as he didn’t want to see the monstrosity that Lucifer was becoming. At least his looks would now match who he really was. Definitely not the most handsome in the land, but the perfect disguise.
Dean gestured up and down at his body to emphasise his point and highlight that he was absolutely fine. In one piece, as Castiel would often say to tease him. Castiel found his eyes lingering over Dean's body for longer than they should've and so he chuckled to cover it up. Castiel then nodded his head and awkwardly pointed behind them to the kitchen sink where he had spent most of his day.
“Let’s...” Dean started, before pulling his gaze away from Castiel and looking into the well, “Let’s see if this wishing works.”
“Well... not my real boyfriend...my fake one...because of you know what I said, I think it has travelled fast and... I don’t want Lisa to think I lied to her and now everyone probably thinks we are dating. So, please?”
“How did it end up being just you and the devil in that big scary Castle?” He asked and Castiel let out a heavy breath.
Lucifer slowly pulled open the lid of the box and his grin widened once he saw what lay inside. A red and bloody heart. One which he believed to be Castiel’s.
“No, it’s actually...fine you got me,” Dean said, “But we’ll cross that bridge when we get there, eh?”
Anael leant forward in her chair whilst taking a sip from her cup, “So, what’s playing on your mind today?”
So they're going to do it. They're going to try and date each other for one month, of course with their rule in place it should be easy.
Cas nodded, slightly uncertain, slumping back in his chair. He placed his hands back on the table and began to fidget with a few packets of sugar that were laid out in a line in front of him.
“Okay, I will,” Dean replied, pushing himself up. He reattached his holster to his belt and smoothed down his shirt and trousers, before running a hand through his hair to push it back. He was about to set off when he placed a hand back on the table and leant a tad closer to Charlie.
Dean kicked the floor in frustration when he arrived at Castiel’s coffin. It was his job to protect Castiel, to keep him safe, to keep him alive. Dean had promised Castiel he would be fine, yet here he lay. Dean had failed and he would never forgive himself for that. He took a deep breath and placed a hand on the top of the glass, right above Castiel’s heart.
The room began to darken and there was now a cool breeze circulating the space between them. The pages of the books flapped, and Crowley flinched backwards as though a chill had crept upon him through the reflective screen. Crowley took in a deep breath before giving in. He knew he had to answer the King's question.
Lucifer slowly nodded, “Yes. Though I could always ask another hunter to do this. If you don’t think that you’re up to it...though they may not be as gentle with poor Castiel. Oh, he won’t see a thing coming.”
Dean swallowed hard; his words harsh and loud. He was trying so hard to hold back any signs of emotions.
Lucifer continued, “It’s just I need to borrow Mr Winchester from you Castiel. We need to discuss the success of his recent trip.”
Lucifer ignored him, of course. He was too deep in his own thoughts, plotting and planning. Over the years he had become increasingly jealous of his younger brother, Castiel. Envious of his brothers looks, worried about how the townspeople seemed to be more appreciative of him and anxious, that one day Castiel would steal his crown and his power. Lucifer could not have Castiel be ‘the fairest in the land’ for much longer. It was driving him insane.
“And we can pretend that I’ve always been deeply and madly in love with you but I never had the courage to say it, until I saw you with Lisa and got jealous,” Cas chuckled slightly and gave Dean a knowing eye whilst mentioning Lisa. “And then like every fairy tale story we got together, but this one won’t have a happy ever after...”
Castiel and Dean had been friends since they were young. It was rare for a Prince and a hunter to be so close, and his brother Lucifer definitely frowned upon it, but Dean had been the only child Castiel had ever been in contact with at the time they met. He had found Dean interesting and mysterious. Someone who didn’t live in the village exactly but still worked for the King. A boy who would go missing for weeks on end, but then arrive at the castle covered in cuts and bruises with the most intriguing stories to tell him. Wild adventures that Castiel could only dream of. Dean had said one day he’d take Castiel with him, if he wanted to go. And he did. Castiel wanted to go on a hunt, an adventure with Dean and the other hunters more than anything, but he knew he couldn’t. It was too dangerous for a Prince. It wasn’t allowed. Castiel wasn’t allowed to leave the safe walls of the village. He could only imagine the meadows, rivers and forests that were out there. The blissful peace of nature.
“Well, I don’t think I’d be awake right now if I didn’t,” Castiel confessed, “I always have. I just thought I could never have you.”
It wasn’t like he was oblivious to the tiny little crush he had on Dean. He was attractive and had always been there for Cas, but that’s all it was a tiny crush. Not even that, it was just a few butterflies.
Dean scoffed. Surely, this man was speaking bullshit now. Maybe Dean was losing his mind and hallucinating all this. He pinched himself, but it was real and now his arm hurt.
“Tricking our friends is one thing but when are you going to be able to see Lisa so she knows it ‘is real?’ Cas asked, raising his eyebrows.
“Suit yourself,” Lucifer replied, screwing the cork back in place, “Though you may need it after this conversation.”
Dean was still speechless. His palms were beginning to sweat and hundreds of thoughts were racing around his head. He didn’t know what to do. What even could he do?
When it was time to leave, Sam and Eileen separated from each other instantly after getting up out of their seats. Clearly attempted to ignore each other's presence to move past the awkwardness from earlier. Cas noticed the sly glances that Eileen was sending Sam’s way when she thought no one was looking and how it was clear Sam was trying to look almost everywhere but where Eileen was. They’d been caught red handed. He was thankful he’d never been this open and easy to read with his thoughts and feelings, or at least he liked to think he was a much more closed off person. Cas was also kind of glad he had this fake relationship as a safety blanket so no one could try meddle with his love life. Cas looked up, drawn out of his thoughts when Charlie nudged him. He hadn’t realised he’d been staring at Dean almost the whole time.
“It was nice,” he stated bluntly, “I spent time with the birds and cleaned outside like you asked. Then I went to do the shopping and spent time with our people, who really are a lovely bunch...”
“I need you to kill Castiel,” Lucifer stated, “And so I know you’ve done it, I want you to bring me his heart. Inside this box.”
“You don’t need to worry about me, I’m the best hunter in the land,” Dean said, his tone almost making it sound like a joke. He turned back towards Castiel, this time he was trying to catch his attention, “Hey, look I’m fine- you don’t need to worry, I promise.”
Charlie noticed Dean’s demeanour and to stop him spiralling, she went over and attempted to console him.
The two brothers laughed at each other for a second and Sam held his hand out to help pull his brother up. Dean was ready to take his hand and follow Sam on a trail when he heard an ear-piercing cry, startling him. Both brothers looked around bewildered and that’s when they saw a group of birds flying their way. They were chirping loud and incessantly, and they were venturing closer and closer to the brothers. Some landed on the boulder Sam and Dean had just been sat on, whilst others began to swarm around them. They were trying to get their attention, trying to tell them something important. Sam watched them, puzzled and was about to swat them away when Dean spoke up.
“It must be nice to have these guys,” Castiel commented, pointing around at everyone. They were now all huddled near the fire. Talking, dancing, singing. “I’ve never really had anyone, well except the animals... but of course, that just sounds weird. And I thought if I loved the people in the kingdom and they loved me it’d fill the emptiness, but it’s not the same. To be loved and to have love, they're different feelings,” Castiel exhaled, “Besides, my brother’s taken that away from me now too anyway.”
Sam and Eileen replied almost in tandem. With Eileen explaining how she presumed she was going with Charlie, as friends, without a date and Sam saying he wasn’t even sure if he was going to go. Their hands almost moving in tandem. They both looked down instantly, embarrassed, when they noticed they’d answered so in sync.
At that moment his phone began to ring, it startled him and he frantically reached towards it. He was only a little bit disappointed to find Charlie was the one calling him. Cas had assumed it’d be Dean.
He turned his head in the direction of the busy bar, it was loud and he could see Charlie mingling in the middle of a bunch of people. Most of them were other students. Cas wasn’t surprised that Charlie was back on her quest to find a girlfriend. It was something she often did when they went out as a group and though she hadn’t had much luck yet, she was positive this method would help her find someone in the future. She caught Cas’s glance and beckoned him over to join her, but with a polite smile Cas shook his head. Charlie turned away, back towards a girl she’d been talking to with blonde hair and Cas watched as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ears. He found it quite strange that all of his friends were searching for relationships right now when they still had so much time for that. Cas wasn’t really interested in love or relationships and Charlie had always said it was because he
Castiel rolled his eyes, faintly remembering their past conversations on this topic and decided to re hash the phrase he always responded with.
“I’ve just remembered, I have errands I must run,” Castiel announced, tentatively glancing to the ground, “I’ll be back tomorrow friends.”
Cas nodded slowly, realising what Dean was talking about and instead of joking back, Cas decided it was time they spoke business about the whole situation.
Dean raised an eyebrow and looked over to see that, sure enough, Cas had hold of his ID. Dean took it off him and flashed Cas a smile. The bouncer sighed and lifted up the rope to let the two boys in.
“Hey, I...uh...missed you, Cas,” he replied, before carefully placing himself next to Castiel on the wall.
Dean had expected a coy answer like that and just nodded once more, before reaching into the pocket of his pants and pulling out two silver pieces. He placed one in the palm of his own hand whilst carefully reaching out to hand Castiel the other one. Castiel looked up at Dean, before reaching forwards and taking the coin from between his fingers. Their hands brushed against each other, though they maintained an intense eye contact.
Dean’s mind began to panic and tears began to form in his eyes. It wasn’t going to work, was it? He’d failed, again.
Cas twiddled with his thumbs, he was so angry last night he had just left without telling anyone and then he’d been so wrapped up in this Dean thing that he hadn’t replied to any of his other texts either.
“I have said many times, you can refer to me by name,” the face groaned, before grumbling on, “You have had me trapped in here for countless years now, just use my name, please!”
Cas tried to remain serious but couldn’t help chuckling. So basically, everyone could see that Eileen and Sam were in love with each other but them. They were so oblivious it was quite funny. Maybe Dean was right, maybe this would push them together like Cas was already planning to try do.
“No, no,” Lucifer cut in, slightly agitated, “I know the old answer...but not the new answer...Reveal the new answer!”
Dean nodded understanding what his friend was saying. He flashed a sympathetic look in Castiel’s direction.
“Cheers Cas,” Dean responded, fiddling with the straps on his bag, “I’m only looking out for you, man.”
“Why don’t we go back and see what the two love birds are up to?” she said, “If they still haven’t gotten their act together and announced their undying love for each other I’m going to have to lock them in a room or something soon.”
“Yes, you seem to have caught on,” Lucifer cackled, “A curse so strong everyone will think he’s dead and then I shall be finally free of the wretched boy.”
“I know, I know. Just stay in the house and I’ll be safe,” he replied, “You’re like some doting mother hen.”
Dean slouched against the tall, brick castle wall and yawned. He’d stayed up most of the night trying to sort out every little detail of his plan whilst overcoming the shock of what Lucifer had even asked him to do in the first place. Dean’s whole body ached and he could barely even stand. His eyes were red, puffy and blood shot. As he patiently waited, he twiddled with the handle of his dagger which was peeking out of from his holster. He was unsure and nervous; he didn’t even know if he could pull this off. If it didn’t work, somehow, both him and Castiel would be in danger. He couldn’t risk it, risk their lives. Though he didn’t hold his own life in as high regard as he held Castiel’s.
Dean awoke the next day with a pounding headache. He could feel the heavy rush of blood and groaned. He pulled the pillow over his head as though it would somehow stop  everything that was hurting. He had definitely drunk too much last night. After Cas had left, (because he had messed up) Dean hadn’t stopped drinking. Shots. Vodka. Whisky perhaps? Mixing drinks had to have been one of the worst ideas he’d ever had because now it felt like cement was being drilled inside his head. And yet, it hadn’t even been the worst idea he had had last night. That crown went to his stupid mouth telling Lisa that Cas was his boyfriend, all in a pitiful attempt to make her jealous- or at least he assumed it was that, the conversation itself was hazy.
Dean could’ve murdered him right there and then, his right hand tightly gripping the handle of the dagger. He was ready to lunge forward, give that son of a bitch what he deserved. But he stopped himself. He wasn’t like Lucifer. He wasn’t a murderer. Castiel wouldn’t want him to do that.
As time passed by, the forest began to creep into even more darkness and Cas realised he’d preferably like to get to his destination before full nightfall. He rose up once more and brushed down his clothes. The squirrel jumped up onto his shoulder and Castiel chuckled as the bushy tail tickled his skin as it moved.
“I’m probably the only boring person you know,” came Cas’s response, he had to speak up a little to make himself heard.
Dean blinked trying his best to keep his gaze focused upon the Prince. There was so much he wanted to say, so much he couldn’t. The pain and confusion spread across Castiel’s face hurt Dean and he wanted more than anything to be able to tell him everything was going to be okay. But he didn’t even know if it ever would be.
“Where’s Dean, by the way?” She pushed herself onto her tiptoes and began to crane her neck around the room.
Lucifer leant forward and picked up of a bottle of wine that was situated on the table in front of them. He carefully took the cork out and began to pour crimson liquid into a metallic golden goblet. Once had had finished filling up his cup, he turned his attention to Dean.
Dean had spoken to Sam, like he’d mentioned, but then had disappeared. Castiel had noticed him with Bobby at one point having some deep heated conversation and then he’d vanished for a bit again before popping back into the kitchen with a handful of recently rooted vegetables. Castiel guessed Dean had done some gardening to clear his head, though he’d never had him down as the gardening type of guy. Then Dean had slipped off for a second time, with Sam saying he’d gone for a shower and a nap to clear his mind. Castiel was worried about Dean. He seemed like he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. Dean was double crossing the King, lying, committing treason. Castiel sighed. Dean was doing all of it for him.
“Oh, I’m awfully sorry to interrupt this little gathering,” Lucifer said, signalling between Dean, Castiel and the crowd of birds near them. Lucifer took another step forward and without hesitation some of the birds flew away, sensing something not quite right.
There is definitely more angst to come in the coming chapters, but hopefully the pay off is worth it.
“My dear Crowley,” he said, reaching his hand out towards the glass, “Where would all the fun be in that?”
Dean tapped his foot against the wall as the seconds crawled by. He was on high alert, so wasn’t startled when the brunet with messy hair finally ventured towards him.
“I mean we can, but not right now. I’ve got to get these back to the castle or Lucifer will not be pleased,” Castiel said and before he could continue Dean cut in.
“So, then...has my acting improved. Do you think I make a good fake boyfriend?” Cas asked, clearly teasing. Dean had a strange sensation in his chest that he couldn’t quite put his finger on. His heart pounding much faster than normal. He put it down to being touch starved, he hadn’t been that intimate and close with anyone for a while.
“I’d ask you a question but I feel like I know everything about you already,” Sam stated, chuckling to himself, snapping Castiel out of his trance.
Dean leant forward and placed a kiss on Castiel’s rosy pink lips. It was soft and tender and Castiel’s lips were still warm, so at least he knew Crowley was telling the truth about the Prince just being asleep. He pulled back after a few seconds, opening his eyes to see if anything had happened.
Cas walked into the restaurant. He took a deep breath and he strolled towards the table where his friends were sat. He felt slightly apprehensive and it was only now dawning in him how difficult it’d be lying to them. To everyone. Charlie was anxiously drumming her fingers on the table, whilst Sam and Eileen were in some deep conversation. When Charlie noticed Cas approaching, she jumped up out of the booth and brought him into a brief embrace. When she pulled back it was clear to Cas that she was rather annoyed.
Dean stopped for a moment, unsure whether he should continue. These were feelings he'd held onto for so long and now it felt like they were just spilling out. He needed to admit them someone. Someone he trusted. Someone he felt could relate.
Lucifer started to turn red, Crowley couldn’t tell at first if it was through embarrassment or anger when suddenly Lucifer’s eyes opened wide, a clear fit of rage crossing his face. He slammed close the lid of the box, shoving it back down on the table. Fists clenched he stepped closer to the mirror; his anger now extremely visible.
Everything suddenly seemed to stop for Dean. His ears were ringing. His heart was racing. His breathing unsteady. Dean gripped his own wrist tightly, pinching himself at though this could be a bad dream that he could simply wake up from. He tried to open his mouth, tried to find the words to speak but all he could do was choke on his own breath.
They began to chirp, to jump, to sing harmoniously to him. Castiel watched on bemused, letting out a small chuckle, before stepping slightly closer to them and carefully holding out his index finger. The birds didn’t seem to be scared of him, in fact they seemed comfortable in his presence. Safe.
“Love you back? Does that mean...” Dean paused; it hadn’t yet fully hit him but Crowley had been right about everything. The kiss had woken Castiel up and in the euphoria, Dean had forgotten what that meant in the grand scheme of things, “...you love me too.”
Cas had been the one to tell Dean that his ex would be at the bar tonight, and he’d regretted doing so the moment the words left his mouth. Lisa was a nice girl; she was pretty and sweet but she hadn’t been right for Dean. Their break up had left Dean reeling for several weeks and Cas had been the one there for him. Cas was always the one there for Dean after his breakups. Dean hadn’t dated anyone for a while, not since Lisa.
“Then what did you want to talk about, Sir?” Dean asked swallowing hard. He had stopped tapping the table and was now pulling at the fabric on his shirt sleeves.
Suddenly, a bush just in front of Castiel began to rustle. He snapped his head around in the direction of the sound instantly, clenching his fist tightly in fear. He didn’t know what to expect, he wondered if somehow Dean had failed and Lucifer had already sent someone else after him.
“We should try to find something, before it gets too dark and we have to go back,” he paused for a second, watching his brother contemplate his words, “And you should tell Cas.”
“Wow,” he uttered, “I didn't...Thanks again. I honestly don’t think I can thank you enough... what you’re doing.... what you’ve done...You didn't have to.”
When he arrived in the courtyard, he slowed down once more. The place was ominous at night and empty. Everyone had gone home, Castiel was the only one left. He lay in his glass coffin, looking the same as he had before- the moon now glistening off the glass, reflecting back into the night sky. Dean approached cautiously, trailing his shaky hand over the coffin as he moved closer. Dean crouched down and unlocked the clasp to pull back the lid, carefully pushing it back, making sure he didn’t break it just in case....
He glanced back at Charlie and Sam, who watched on confused but a glimmer of hope in their eyes. Dean’s shoulders dropped and he let out a heavy exhale. His gaze fell on Castiel and the corner of his mouth upturned. Dean placed a hand beside Castiel’s head and closed his eyes.
When Castiel finally made his way down the stairs, most of the hunters had finished eating. The table was a scattered mess of bowls and pots once more, causing Castiel to jokingly roll his eyes. Three people were still sat at the table, the red head, shaggy hair and another girl who Castiel hadn’t noticed earlier. The three of them were huddled together. They were in deep conversation, talking intensely and signing to each other. He made his way over and perched himself on a chair nearby. He did it in an awkward manner in an attempt to not disturb them. He glanced over at the large pot sat in the middle of the table, still steaming, containing remnants of whatever the group had just eaten for what he assumed was breakfast.
“Sorry,” his brother said, sitting down beside him, “I’ve just been wanting to do that for so long.”
“I’ll try my best,” he replied, with a wave before stepping outside to join the others. Castiel watched as the door swung shut and shifted his focus to the small cottage window. He could see the group wander off through the field and into the deep woods. Castiel sat for a moment, contending with his own thoughts before deciding to go upstairs and take a nap to pass time.
Lucifer let out a loud laugh that seemed to echo off the walls of the castle for an age. Dean finally turned to face the king fully, awkwardly tapping his fingers against the table.
“I can’t believe I trusted that Winchester to do this...of course why was I so stupid...I guess some jobs I have to carry out myself.”
“Right, now that’s out of the way...I’m going to go and make myself some breakfast,” Cas said, “And because I know you won’t have yet, you should make yourself something too. Best cure for a hangover is food.”
“I should...” Dean coughed to cleared his throat, “I should go talk to Sammy. Show him that I’m fine.”
Lucifer was waiting for him in the dining hall once more. He was propped up on his throne, legs crossed and grinning.
“And Dean,” Lucifer added, his voice loud and though Dean refused to turn and face him, he could imagine the giddy expression across his face, “You know what will happen to both of you if you fail.”
“I’m going to wake Cas up,” Dean announced, optimism seeping through, “He’s not dead. Just asleep and I can wake him up...I think...I hope...”
The group burst into hysterics once more, and even though he felt awkward and bit uncertain, Castiel smiled along with them before pushing himself up and reaching down for his boots. He was leaning so far over the side of the bed, that he was conscious about how careful he’d have to be so he didn’t fall off the edge. The awkwardness that had just disappeared would certainly come back if he ended up in a heap on the floor.
Lucifer’s smile was nauseating and made Dean want to punch him. He would rather not stay in the Castle for the night, but he didn’t want to raise any suspicions. Dean just wanted to snatch at the opportunity to evade Lucifer’s presence.
Neither Dean nor Cas answered but Charlie took their silence as confirmation. Dean had just stared at Cas, biting his lip in a what Cas would probably describe as a flirtatious manner. Cas knew it wasn’t real and was all part of their act but having Dean act in such a seductive manner towards him was such an unknown concept and he didn’t know how to feel. Didn’t know to respond. Didn’t know how to deal with it. Cas had not noticed that his cheeks had tinged a dark red.
“Well, that’s great!” Dean announced, throwing his arms up exasperated, “Except I have no idea who Cas’s true love is.”
“We’re mates and this isn’t real, so I’m sure we’ll be fine,” Dean finally replied though there was a change in his tone. Harsh. Hurt? It was there for a split second but he was back to joking almost instantly. “But are you sure you won’t fall in love with me? I’m pretty irresistible.”
Charlie chuckled at his response, before taking a swig of her beer, which left foam around the rim of her mouth. It was Dean's turn to jokingly shake his head at Charlie, which he did before placing the dagger back into his holster and taking a drink of his own beer. Charlie was looking eagerly around the bustling market square as she savoured her drink, when she paused upon seeing a specific person. Instantly Charlie turned her attention to Dean, raising her eyebrows.
“It’s here somewhere,” Dean uttered, just loud enough to be heard, though even now he was losing hope of it being in his pocket.
Dean didn’t know how he managed to arrive where he did, but before he knew it, he was outside Castiel’s room. It was in an isolated part of the Castle, far away from any other company. A large ‘C’ was engraved on the door in a royal blue. Dean glanced around to make sure he was alone and once certain pushed open the door and entered the room. He carefully pulled the door shut behind him and then looked around. It was smaller than he’d assumed it would be and the only source of light came through a singular window. This wasn’t a room fit for a Prince.
“Who?” he asked, though he was already certain he knew the answer. He didn’t need to hear Dean say it and didn’t want to force it upon him either. He knew Dean had meant his brother. It was why Lucifer had wanted to talk to the hunter yesterday. Why Dean had been a shell of himself afterwards. It was clear this was taking a toll on Dean, who was usually so relaxed and cool headed. The Dean in front of him was a panicked erratic mess. Castiel wondered if Dean’s red, puffy eyes were from lack of sleep or something more. Dean usually kept his emotions buried, often built up a façade but this had shaken him and cracks were beginning to show from his emotional barriers.
Castiel let out a heavy sigh but a smile had formed across his lips. He looked down and began to draw a spiralled pattern upon the stone of the well with his fingers.
For a moment, the sensation was amazing. The man had been right it really was the best apple he had ever tasted. Castiel swallowed his first bite, smiling, and was ready to take another when the world started to go blurry. His head started to pound and he felt slightly dizzy. Things were spinning and his legs started to feel numb. Weak. He could no longer keep his balance. He tried to speak, say something, ask the man for help but the words wouldn’t come out.
“Who?” the mirror asked, but he already knew the answer, “Now, now Your Majesty, don’t you think this is all a bit drastic. I’m sure everyone loves you as much as they love Feathers.”
He leant forward towards Castiel and the wishing well once more, rolling up his sleeves and rubbing his hands together, getting himself prepared.
There was also the small matter of telling the town their king was also dead, though Dean didn’t feel up to that right now and Lucifer did not deserve the mention. This moment of reflection was for Castiel.
“You should go together,” Dean suddenly said in a blunt manner waving his finger between them both, before taking a sip of his coke. Sam and Eileen both turned to Dean, bewildered by his comment. Both of their cheeks started to turn rouge. Charlie also sharply turned her head to Dean, furious that he’d seemingly ruined her well thought out plan. Cas placed a hand on her arm to calm her down.
Dean shrunk back, biting his lips. He knew what Sam was insinuating, hell he knew what Sam was inferring was the truth. Castiel was his best friend; he was the prince who Dean felt he had a duty to protect and look after but it was so much more than that. Castiel made him laugh like no one else. He worried about Castiel’s life more than even his own sometimes. His heart would race anytime their fingers accidentally brushed or when they embraced, he wished they’d never let go. He didn’t need Sam to spell it out, but he was still too afraid to admit it because if Castiel didn’t feel the same way. Dean didn’t want to ruin their friendship.
Dean was cut off by Charlie letting out a loud sigh, which he responded to sarcastically by raising both his hands up ‘in surrender’. Charlie playfully kicked him under the table, to which Dean lowered his hands. He then glanced back to over where Castiel was, a large crowd still gathered around him.
Dean didn’t reply for a moment and Cas was prepared to hang up when he heard his best friend’s voice once more.
Castiel reluctantly looked back at Dean and sighed, knowing his friend was right. Dean flashed him a playful smirk.
The day passed by quite quickly. Castiel spent his time inside the house, cleaning up and settling in. Charlie stuck to his side, he guessed it was her attempt to make him feel welcomed. She was nice and sweet but very talkative and he ended up learning more about her than he probably ever needed to know. Despite this, Castiel appreciated her efforts and company whilst he waited for Dean to finish whatever he was up to.
“Here let me. It’s what boyfriends are for right?” He joked. Dean let him wipe it away and was in awe at how gentle Cas was being with him. Dean found himself leaning into Cas’s touch and was startled when he pulled his hand away. As Cas leant back, Dean sent him a thankful look and unintentionally traced the area above his lips with his finger.
Dean shook his head with a grin, slightly embarrassed that Cas knew him so well. Slightly embarrassed he hadn’t realised that nearly everything they’d end up doing for the next month would all be part of some act despite the fact this had been his idea. His drunken idea. At least they both knew it was fake, so anything that did happen couldn’t blur the lines of their friendship. Actions like that were all an act, so things hopefully wouldn’t be awkward when the whole scenario was over. His heartbeat was still faster than he’d like it to be so Dean picked up one of the sugar packets Cas had been playing with and twiddled it between his fingers as a distraction. He flickered his gaze back up towards Cas, who still looked pretty pleased with himself. Dean scoffed, but couldn’t help looking at Cas with full admiration.
It wasn’t long until they came across a clearing. An open meadow full of flowers, barley and long grass that swayed in the cool evening breeze. The sun peered over the horizon as it set, basking the distant hills in a golden glow. Castiel's lips perked up in awe and then he turned in the opposite direction. It was there where he noticed the house. The one Dean had told him about. It was bigger than he’d imagined, but it still looked homely and cosy. It had a straw thatched roof and there was smoking billowing out of the chimney. Castiel beamed after noticing it. He glanced over at the deer and nodded in a signal of thanks before barrelling towards the building.
When Cas arrived home that evening, he instantly sunk into a chair. He replayed certain moments including wiping the froth from Dean’s face. He didn’t really know why he’d done it, it just felt right-like something he should do. Maybe he was better at this whole fake dating schmitt than he first thought he would be. Cas slumped further back in the chair, or maybe he’d done it because he wanted to. The look on Dean’s face had been worth it either way but now Cas couldn’t get the moment out of his head.
The King slouched back in his chair, a wry smile spreading across his lips as he took a sip of the wine.
Crowley felt helpless in his mirror. All he could do was watch Lucifer plot and conspire. It was worse than that, his curse meant he actively had to help. He could not lie to his master.
“Unfortunately, I cannot reveal all my secrets, though it does involve us all going out for a meal at Benny’s tomorrow...so I’m just checking you can come?”
He wondered who else resided here and where they were now. On another hunt perhaps? Helping Dean out with his plan? Castiel wondered if they even knew about the situation Dean was in, or if Dean had even told them about their friendship.
There was a silence for a few seconds that lingered in the air and Castiel daren't look at anyone in case the response was negative. But Sam eventually spoke up to clear the air. Sam who knew Dean better than anyone.
He wiggled a finger between him and Cas as he spoke, which caused both Cas and Charlie to shift their focus towards him. They both realised Dean’s approach was maybe the best one. Being blunt and honest to Sam and Eileen was probably the best method. Pointing out how obvious it was that they had it really bad for each other might be the best way to get a result. Dean smiled at Charlie knowing she’d now caught on and appreciated his approach. At least if he was honest and upfront about this, it was one less thing he’d have to keep secret.
“Shit,” he mouthed to Charlie and began to duck down, almost resting his head against the rather dirty table to make sure he was hidden. Charlie frowned at him, confused.
Anael raised her eyebrows and leant back in her chair, she carefully placed her cup down on the table in front of them. It clinked on a saucer as she did so.
Charlie had said she could get them all some fake IDs sorted before the night, and Dean was certain she’d given them out already.
The apple tumbled out of his hand crashing to the floor and before long Castiel was there with it. He had collapsed into a heap in the doorway. His eyes fluttering closed. The last thing he heard before drifting off into his deep sleep was an evil, malicious laugh. It was one he seemed to recognise, that was so suspiciously familiar.
"Don’t even get me started on my father...he was...just this horrible overbearing figure who wanted to control my life. He wasn’t a nice man. He was hunter too, you see, I guess it's a family business...I think it's the only thing I have in common with him," Dean bit the inside of his cheek, "I often felt like I had to protect myself and Sam from him... felt like I had to grow up faster than I should’ve so I could be the one to impress him and my brother was safe from his wrath. When me and Sammy finally got a way...when we found Bobby and the hunters...I don’t know, I feel like I finally found my real family. My place in the world, where I could just be me.”
In the evening, everyone gathered at the table and ate a meal together. Castiel found the experience rather fascinating, as all of his eating experiences had just been him and Lucifer, sat in mostly silence, in the dark and dingy dining hall. But here everyone was joking and laughing. The fire was lit causing the room to glow, giving the place a real homely feel. Sam and Eileen were practically sat in each others laps, feeding one another and heavily flirting. Charlie would glance at Castiel and roll her eyes at the sight, but it was clear she was joking. Donna and Jody had cooked the meal and were taking compliments in from Bobby with pride. Everyone was smiling. They were enjoying themselves. Castiel found that he was enjoying himself too.
Dean nodded with a smile before turning away. Upon catching a glimpse of Lucifer, Dean frowned. He followed him across the courtyard, up a number of stairs and into the Castle. Every now and then he glanced back at Castiel who was still at the wishing well, singing to the birds.
Cas could hear Charlie make a strange sound at the other end of the phone, but couldn’t make out exactly what it was.
Cas replied, sarcastically, avoiding any eye contact with Dean to make sure Dean knew he was annoyed at him. Dean let out a quiet wheeze.
Hesitantly, he picked up a spoon and scooped some of the delicacy into an empty bowl, before taking a mouthful. He wasn’t sure what he was eating and he couldn’t determine the texture, but it tasted delicious. It was like nothing he’d ever eaten before. It was so much better than the dry, boring and bland foods Lucifer had made him eat back at the Castle. Castiel immediately took a second mouthful, barely stopping for a breath in between.
“Are you going to be okay?” he asked, realising the danger Dean was also in, “If he finds out you haven’t.... then I don’t know what he’ll do to you.... And I don’t think I’ll...”
I'm not entirely pleased with how this chapter plays out but at least Lucifer is gone! I started to show some of Dean's grief in this chapter but they'll definitely be more in the next one as he starts to accept the situation...
And suddenly he was drawn back to reality by an impending feeling in his gut, that he was being watched. Cautiously he glanced around once more before catching the eyes of Lucifer who was stood at the window in his tower, glaring directly at him. A chill crept up the young prince’s spine and without any hesitation, he carefully placed the bird back onto the roof of the well. The gaggle that had crowded their all looked back at him confused but Castiel’s gaze was still firmly placed on his brother, who had now moved out of the window's main sightline as his presence had become known, but was still visible from behind a curtain.
Eileen and Charlie left together, with Charlie secretly giving a Dean and Cas a thumbs up, a smile beaming from ear to ear, she hoped and believed Dean’s encouragement would work. The plan was in motion. Sam was going to take a ride home with Dean and Cas, but hopped into the back seat of the impala without saying a sound. Cas presumed he was mad at Dean for what he’d revealed in the diner. Cas sat shotgun, beside Dean, and watched as Dean observed Sam in his rear mirror. Sam had a blank look on his face and seemed to be deep in thought over something. Dean stared the car engine with a roar, and turned to Cas before once again mouthing- ‘good job.’
The brothers had walked so far that they came upon a cliffside, an area neither of them had ventured to for a long time. Bobby had told them it was where a Quarry had once been, but it became too dangerous for people to work there anymore. They’d come here and played together when they were younger, using mounds as mountains pretending, they were on hunts like their dad. When John had caught wind of them playing there, he’d followed them and dragged the two boys up the tallest rock at the quarry, making them look over the edge so they realised how dangerous the place was. The two boys never visited the Quarry again.
And before Sam even had time to react, Dean was darting through the forest. As fast as he could. As fast as he ever had before. Sam was following behind, but was struggling himself to keep up.
At the word ‘wishing’ Castiel raised his eyebrows. He was intrigued. It made him think of his wishing well which he missed dearly. He twiddled the apple around in his hand once more, and smiled. His smile full of uncertainty but also awe.
Dean clenched his fists together whilst telling the story, his nails digging into his palms. Castiel listened attentively, his jaw dropping, shocked by the lengths Dean had gone to prove this, to make his death seem legitimate. The lengths he was going to keep Castiel safe.
“WAIT WHAT!?” came a screaming Charlie down the phone, but Cas refused to spill any details no matter how much she pushed. Eventually Charlie gave in and wished Cas a good night before hanging up. Cas chuckled to himself at how invested Charlie was in her friends love lives, maybe next they should try help Charlie with hers.
The sun shone through the trees and the birds sung in the branches. The streets were fairly empty for a Saturday morning but Cas appreciated the peace and quiet. He was already on the second walk of the day, to try and clear his head, but it wasn’t exactly working. He couldn’t get his mind off of Dean. Well, what Dean had suggested. Cas didn’t even know why, the simple thing to do would be saying
“I can’t...not here,” Castiel raised an eyebrow, confused at Dean’s admission. Dean glanced around and lowered his voice before continuing, “Meet me tomorrow, just outside the castle walls. I need to tell you something. Something big.”
However, after the waitress had come and cleaned their empty plates, Charlie perked up and the groups conversation sparked to life once more.
“Good question. Perhaps they don’t have to know Castiel is dead quite yet...they can just know he has gone a way for a while,” Lucifer paused, “Question for you, Where’s the rest of the body?”
The three in front of him nodded, before giving each other a knowing glance which Castiel was oblivious too.
There was a silence that lulled between them for a few minutes. Nothing could be heard, not even the sounds of the surrounding nature that often-brought Castiel peace.
Lucifer smirked, before placing a hand on a box that was in front of him, which Dean hadn’t noticed until now. The perfect unblemished box with the beautiful carvings on the side. Dean tilted his head in confusion.
Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath before thinking long and hard. Anael was right, he had to do what he thought was best, and yet the only thing that seemed right to him was helping Dean. Because she was right, Dean was his friend and he wanted him to be happy and that was really all that mattered to him. He’d get to spend more time with Dean too before the inevitability of Lisa returned. Maybe it could benefit him too.
“Dean, you gotta come try this! Bring Cas too! Donna’s made pie,” Charlie suddenly yelled, catching both of the boys by surprise. They both instantly looked away, their eyes trying to dart to somewhere else in the room. Dean cleared his throat and awkwardly started to stand up. Castiel stayed at the table and started to fiddle with his cutlery.
“But there is a way to break this curse, Your Highness...” Crowley tried to stop the words unravelling out of his mouth, but he couldn’t, “If Prince Castiel is kissed by a true love, he will be awoken.”
“And met up with the hunter,” Lucifer interjected, “Though I did not realise your friend had returned yet, because neither him or yourself decided to tell me.”
“It is a bit,” Dean replied, a small grin on his face, “Plus, us being ‘together’ might push Eileen and Sam to go and get their act together.”
Sam had let Castiel sleep in his bed, as it meant he could then share with Eileen. This meant Castiel spent his nights lying across from Dean, occasionally staring at him when he struggled to doze off. It was almost pitch black at nights with only the slightest glimmer of moon light illuminating the room so Castiel couldn’t always clearly see Dean. But he knew he was there and could imagine his features. It helped him sleep knowing Dean was close, and if they weren’t in a room with six other people, he’d whisper to Dean and drift off having a conversation with the hunter. Castiel knew better than to imagine things like this, Dean was probably asleep. Castiel would try his best to banish the constant cycle of thoughts about his best friend, but they never stopped popping into his head. His eyes would stay fixed on the spot he knew Dean was, as he let out a small sigh. It was too dark for Castiel to knowing that Dean was staring right back.
Dean peered up at her out of one eye and winced. He placed his palms on the table to push himself up slightly but made sure his back remained arched and his was head still low down.
Cas trailed off, now noticing the deer had stepped closer. It was a stag. He was quite tall and had long gangly antlers. His head was tilted as though he was trying to tell Castiel something. Help him out. Cas thought he understood.
Castiel chuckled at Dean’s comment before humming in agreement. They stayed there, losing track of time, gazing up at the stars. Castiel, the young Prince, and Dean, the hunter, holding onto each tightly. Making up for lost time. So lost in the moment, they’d forgotten they weren’t exactly alone until Sam and Charlie decided sneak off and leave them be.
“I mean...I could have...maybe...” Dean paused as he noticed the look of disapproval spread across Charlie’s face. In the end he just reluctantly shook his head.
He wasn’t surprised to find the front door unlocked when he arrived. It was part of Dean’s plan to let him stay there and well it was Dean, he probably forgot to lock the door most days anyway. The fire still being lit was a nice surprise, it had warmed the house up and Castiel noticed a pot of soup still cooking, hanging over the flame pit. The aroma drew Castiel in and he closed his eyes with a grin, hoping it tasted as good as it smelt.
“You could come to me, your brother, for advice one day, you know?” Gabe said as Cas and Anael moved to a nearby table. Cas just chuckled under his breath, remembering all the bad advice his brother had given him over the years. It always came in the form of some weird analogy or metaphor and then Gabe would try use the situation in his new book idea. Cas knew his brother meant well, but he felt much more comfortable getting advice from Anael.
“How will you last a month without falling in love with me?” Dean teased once more with a wry grin, taking another mouthful of his coffee. Cas tilted his head but couldn’t hide the smile that had found its way to his lips.
