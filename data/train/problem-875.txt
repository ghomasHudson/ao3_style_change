John turn as he takes off his jumper and tosses it onto his seat. He's not surprised in the slightest to see that Sherlock hasn't budged an inch from the radio, his hand still idly turning the dial, but it still makes him throw his hands out, "You know, you could help too."
The quiet stretches between them for what feels like ages. John watches as Sherlock drums his fingers against his knuckles, lowering his head then raising it as he thinks on how to get out….whatever he has to. His phone vibrates in his pocket, and he knows in an instant that it's from Mary.
He glances at the floor as Sherlock takes this in, till finally he nods and links his hands together on his stomach. There’s a beat of silence, momentarily cut by the heart monitor, till Sherlock speaks again,
John smiles tightly, "And I loved her." He says it so easily, that it cuts through Sherlock like a sharp blade. He sets the bottle on the nightstand and gives Sherlock his full attention, "But then you come back from the dead like you're jesus and she goes and shoots you." He shrugs halfheartedly. Given up. Accepted it. But somehow, he still needs the good old liquid courage. Sherlock frowns. He can't fit this together.
John looks up at him, and his eyes're crinkled, "No, I guess you're right." He stands to grab the beer back off the dresser, and Sherlock doesn't stop him this time. He can't anymore, "But at least she'll never have to see or hear from me. As far as Mary's concerned, Rosie doesn't have a father."
Perhaps it's the utter giddiness John feels coursing in his veins, or that he hasn't felt this relaxed in what could be years, but as his gaze holds his, he finds himself smiling wide and before Sherlock can say anything, he leans forward and presses a gentle kiss to his roommates mouth.
John immediately lets go of Mary and her smile drops, "John?" She tries to find his eyes and reaches a hand out, but he's pushing through everyone and uttering 'sorrys' under his breath. It's only when he gets to the door does she take his arm and he's forced to look at her, and he doesn't realise he's panting until Mary speaks,
There’s a pause, until John shrugs and continues eating, “Guess I like the danger,” he says teasingly.
His thumb brushes Sherlocks bottom lip as he open his eyes and whispers something that makes Sherlocks heart plummet.
In one second, John's pulled him into a warm hug. Sherlocks arms go around him and he squeezes him once, making John blink back his own tears. He speaks into his chest as Sherlocks cheek rests on the top of his head, "You're still the best human being I've ever known."
When John rips his arm away, Sherlock stares ahead at the wall and listens to John uncap another bottle from the batch. From the deductions he'd made, he knows this should be Johns last one.
Their hands unlink as Sherlock puts his on Johns shoulder blade, and Johns comes down to hold his waist. Sherlock carefully lowers him until their noses are almost touching, and they're both panting as the violin comes to a close; Sherlocks eyes search him as he waits for John to let go and step away, but nothing of the sort happens at all.
“It said something about living long and prospering,” he recites. Sherlock raises a brow, but John reaches for his cookie and snaps it open, reading aloud before Sherlock can protest, “You already know the answer to the question lingering inside your head.” He looks up at him, “Alright, what is it?”
It’s so dark and cold down here. Mrs Hudson’s door is still closed. Irrelevantly, I wonder whether she can get warm enough in this downstairs chill. I push that from my mind.
I strain to look through the crowd, for any kind of faster movement. A man running, two men, hopefully. I stand, bracing myself.
So, he caught a bus and walked some more and caught a train and walked. Followed the paths etched upside his own skull - he knew every road in London. Approached a crony, learned about the house in return for cash. Then he continued on: they were his usual methods.
I don’t want him to lose his sudden vibrancy. I give him another smile as he peeks at my expression. He tentatively returns it.
“You know,” says Sherlock suddenly, shifting on his stool to face me (I hastily jerk from my reverie), “I really did convince myself it was Christmas.”
The long grass catches and cushions me. Just as fast, I’m sitting, my elbows on my knees, head in hands. Tears are filling my palms already. I can’t reach him. I can’t.
It’s not drugs. That’s the first thing he tells me, upon waking up. He grabs the lapels of my coat, his eyes too wide, his face too white, as if he’d had the fright of his life.
But I’m far above it all. The cliff-face is sharp enough to see directly below, so far below. The figure at its foot is a black speck.
“Let’s talk,” he says, taking my arm. His fingertips are cold, even through my sleeve. The fireplace flickers, the chair is warm, and his eyes are on me the entire time we whisper. It just seems too private to chance including a neighbour. His eyes have flecks of different colours in them. I copy them in sprinkling more colourful topics into the discussion. After a few hours, he changes into his deep blue dressing gown, so I know he thinks this conversation is special. That this night is special.
Although, I don’t know whether it’s the doctor or the soldier that compels me. Do I look at him like a patient, or like a comrade? Or do I look at him like an ex-army, non-practising doctor - in other words, no profession attached? Is it simply being a friend when I put a cloth to his sweat-soaked forehead? Or a doctor as I take his temperature? Or a soldier as I wait up all hours of the night for him?
"Hold him Still," I began by making him rotate his arm holding the elbow still and then after being looked into the eyes there exchanged a nod of consent, I turned the shoulder with a decisive blow, returning to his place.
"Come on, kid!" I entertained him with a derisory smile. Sherlock did not have to repeat it twice. He attacked me from the front, I managed to dodge it and move back. I tried to hit him in the legs, I did not want to hit him seriously, I needed only that much to make him incapable of hindering me. Sherlock attacked again and I dodged it and managed to hit the backside playfully. I laughed too, but I found myself amused by that scenario.
Inside the castle was crumbling, ivy and rubble envelopded him giving an even more mysterious appearance.
I approached him, started the collar, unlacing his shirt, after losing the first buttons of his jacket. I felt the eyes of Holmes scrutinize me.
"Ah ... thank you very much. I think I have slightly overdone ", I found myself laughing, even Holmes had joined in laughter.
So saying, he stood up and held out his hand, though I grasped it with indecision to get up. He took my bag and motioned for me to follow him, but I was still not sure I would want to give up my escape, after so much effort. I found myself staring at the stable exit.
"Fillies? Alec is looking after the fillies now? "Asked a man next to him, whom I knew but whose name I could not remember.
That evening I decided to stay in my room, I did not want the looks mixed with amazement and suspicion, which now seems to follow me everywhere. It only fueled my sense of discomfort with the situation in which I was finished. I was tasked with what was called "a miracle" and instead of granting me freedom, it had made me even more a prisoner. Even if I could get back to the stone circle, I could not be sure it worked. I could have gone further back in time. What persuaded me to leave my room was the oblivion promised by Colum's Rhine wine.
"As you can well see now I have already done. Now I can catch a glimpse of your handsome, arrogant English face. "At his words, I felt my face flush, what was happening to me?
"How strange most of the schemes do you look like you know? But one like yours I've never seen. A big thumb However indicates that you haveas a strong personality and that you haves a hard will to fold. And this is yourhis mount of Venus and to what I see Mr Watson you are a very fiery lover, "the lady began to grin, while I nodded a smile as the tips of my ears became red from embarrassment.
"Actually it's a great place for amles, it's not to be ruled out that..." The man sped up the horse's stride to reach the elder man. They began to speak in Gaelic.
Finally, Holmes bowed to Colum and staggered off and hurt. I joined him in the kitchens to check how he was.
"You can't use it for two or three days, you don't have to move it. When you resume using it, move it slowly at the beginning "As I spoke I was tying him around his arm and shoulder the belt so he could stop him better.
I stared for a long time at the boy nailed to the pillory, while holding a glass of port in his hand.
"Soon give me something to hold the firm arm, a belt or a piece of cloth," one of the men stretched me his belt.
"Now that your face is almost decent, take off your jacket, shirt and waistcoat." He ordered me badly.
"Mister Watson, do you feel good?" Dougal came out from behind the bushes and I quickly dried my eyes.
"I would not have dared, I was afraid you would have spanked me, if I had come so far," he said with a provocative grin.
"I also see ... you have trouble sleeping. Roots of valerian, I too can hardly sleep. But I do not pesto it as you do, I'll boil it first. "
During my breaks, I went to the kitchen by Mrs. Hudson, where I knew Dougal's spies perennially to drink.
"Not at all, you have this extraordinary ability to make me understand that you're sorry, without making me feel pitied."
Frank looked me in the interrogative eyes and I think heI understood my fear, so i look away looking for attention elsewhere,. but then Frank turned my face to him look straight into my eyes.
"To tell the truth I was so weak that I could not stay in the saddle. Four years ago, it seems like a distant dream and yet ... well it went like this ", he stood up
"He is John Watson, Mrs. Hudson!" The young man introduced me. "Marthag found it in the woods and Dougal said to take it with us so ...".
I returned to my duties and in the evening, I was invited by Colum, in the great hall to listen to the minstrel of the castle. I was now at my third glass of wine, when I sat down in one of the bellies while listening to the beautiful music. My head turned slightly. Just a few moments I realized I was sitting next to Leary. I took the opportunity to introduce myself and glimpsed at the same moment, appearing in a corner Mr. Holmes. The young girl's infatuation with Holmes was obvious, so I took the opportunity to have him sit in our midst.
Back in the country, we went to visit the Reverend's estate in Inverness, so that Frank could continue his research, and I was deeply bored reading old manuals on the couch.
"Well... I hoped that once we were here..." was definitely nervous but I pretended to nothing and took the opportunity to try to make him laugh.
"I swear on the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ and on the sacred iron that I hold in my hand to pay tribute and loyalty to the name of the MacKenzie clan. If ever my hand should rise in rebellion against you, I ask this sacred iron to pierce my heart. "He kissed the knife as a bond to his oath and sheathed the weapon, in doing so took Colum's hands and kiss. Colum grabbed a glass of wine and handed it to Dougal, who drank it without a word, and then it was Colum who was drinking from the same glass. At that moment all the guests in the hall burst into a big applause and the bagpipes began to play again.
When the woman did as I told her, the child began to eat eagerly. I smiled confidently at the woman, who continued to thank me repeatedly with tears streaming down her face.
"Yes definitely, especially after all the time spent in the midst of mud and damp brande inside a worn out tent, I would say that a warm bed is definitely a dream."
Well! That's all I can do. The rest depends on you. " He made one of his half smiles as he squared me from head to toe. Turning away I perceived her gaze upon me behind my shoulders. I climbed into the saddle and followed him up too.
"I know the paths and the plan of the castle by heart, I even know how many sentries there are and they do not scare me."
"But I want to go see witches, they make a ritual not so far from here. They dance and pronounce spells around stones, I want to go and see. "
"Okay then let's see how good you are with the sword, Mr. I know everything," I took one of the swords placed in the stable's arsenal and pointed it at him.
"That child is dying because of the poison not of the devil and if you do not allow me to care, he will not make it."
"Her father is accusing her of obscene acts, and she wants Colum to have her punished for disobedience," he told me in a low voice. They were about to punish the girl when Holmes came forward claiming the punishment in place. He had chosen his fists instead of lashes, and to give them to him would have been the same man who had stalked me until then. He began to hit him repeatedly, Victor said it would last until he was bleeding, or when he would break his nose. But even after having smashed his nose, the man received orders from Dougal to continue hitting him on the injured shoulder. I had to make a lot of effort not to intervene. It was a barbaric thing.
"You say unbecoming things to be a gentleman," I accused him staring at my feet, embarrassed by the atmosphere that had arisen.
"And do you also know that there are guards in the woods? Are you going to face them alone? "He began to laugh, I had the impression he was making fun of me, the bastard.
"You had already seen dying men of violent death" was Dougal who came to me, I do not even know why but I had a strange feeling that it was not a courtesy visit.
"A bullet hole, the idiot could say it before. The wound is sharp, it doesn't look serious but it's lost a lot of blood. I have to disinfect the wound. "
"Gentlemen I brought a little snack, I brought only two cups because I thought Mr. Watson could keep me company in the kitchen?"
"Mmm... we'll talk about it later, we have to deal with Sherlock" and approached the figure near the fireplace sitting on an old chair.
When we finally reached the village, they immediately began to collect the payment, for loyalty to the clan.
"No, I have to put your arm on your side," he raised his eyes to the sky. I started wrapping his arm and I found his chest very close to my face, I tried not to make a sound, I was sure  was blushing, so I tried to avoid any contact with his eyes. I knew he was peering at me.
"I did not mean to offend you, I just thought you helped a lot of people and I could come and ask you for help on the subject."
"Well! Remove the blindfold in a couple of days" I instructed him as I put the used bowls on the table.
Since I would have participated in hunting as a healer, I had to get a horse, so I went to the stables. My Uncle Lamb had taught me to ride when we lived in Ireland, but it had been a while now, so I had to choose a gentle, calm horse.
"Yes, but you see tomorrow I'm leaving for Inverness" and the face of Holmes I noticed a note of sadness and resignation.
"You must admit that there is a possibility that he is actually sick and not possessed. If so, then maybe we can do something to help him. "
"Maybe you do not use his party to celebrate properly, but I will not lose the meeting to follow you in that hole."
"... oh Johnny. Please let me do this. I want to see you. Don't run away, you've done this for the last few months together. But now I'm here and I'm not leaving. I wish that you let me in. "
"Not bad for being a kid, you have grit, I grant you but it is not enough in a real duel", I took him in.
"Try not to get whipped or stab today. It would be perfect as a thank you, for my efforts to keep you alive”, I mentioned a smile.
"But I'm also a highland dweller. Raised here and it is not fair to challenge fate by making fun of the devil in his home. "
"Shut up or I'll cap that stinking mouth to the sound of fists is that clear?!" threatened him annoyed. He lowered a deep silence while I finished arranging the bandage.
"It would have been a shame, for the girl to be beaten in front of everyone. It would take a long time to get over it. For me it's easier. It hurts, but it's nothing serious. In a couple of days, I'll be like new. Thanks to your exceptional care Watson. "I wiped his face with a cloth, while Mrs. Hadson appeared with a tray. She handed Holmes a hot drink.
"Well, you would know." He picks up his beer again, "You watch those shows all the time." When Sherlock doesn't say anything, he gestures his drink to him with a knowing smile, "It's the only trope that hasn't been ticked off, mate."
John licks his lips and pulls Sherlock in for another kiss. It lasts for a little longer this time, and John has to grasp the bannister to stop his knees from giving out beneath him. Sherlock has a hand around his waist to keep him from falling, and Johns other hand is buried in Sherlocks hair. When they let go, they’re panting slightly, and without a word, Sherlock takes Johns hand and they almost race up the stairs to get into the flat. They’re at the landing when Sherlock turns to John, a slightly hesitant look on his features,
John turns to look at him and motions a hand to the already-lit lamps, "We don't need the extra light."
Sherlock sighs as he carefully sets the bag on the floor, making sure it doesn't rustle too much, then puts hands back in his pockets. He waits for the sound of another bottle being opened, cap this time so one from a box, before making his way up. His footsteps are purposefully quiet as he listens to John giggle and take sip after sip, and he stops at the landing. There's a soft light from the crack in Johns door, and he can see him sat on the edge of the bed in a shirt and boxers, bottle clutched in hand with his eyes on the carpet. He's not skulling this one. Nursing it. Maybe he does know Sherlock's home. Or maybe he's promised himself one more before crawling under the covers for the night. Sherlock bites his lip as he stretches out a hand to press on the door. He gently pushes it open, and John jumps, his eyes staring wildly at Sherlock as he walks through into the room. Even from this distance, he can see Johns eyes are wet.
He almost scoffs when Mary appears at the foot of Sherlocks bed. She nods to him, her tone gentle, “You have to say it, John.”
Sherlock doesn't move, and John rolls his eyes as he takes it and shrugs it on. It's way too big for him - the cuffs go over his hands and the bottom reaches past his knees - but despite it, he smiles, "Thanks."
Sherlocks voice is soft, "John, listen to me. Whatever feelings you have for me, you cannot act on them, do you understand?"
They've done this dance many times. Practiced until their feet were sore and their faces were flushed with happiness. And though John has gone through the motions, knowing every beat by heart, somehow -
then” John whispered dirtily into his ear, and that was the final straw that sent Sherlock over the edge.
"You can bloody well say that again. That's the last time I let you book anything, Sherlock! How much did this even cost?"
Sherlock was more breathtaking at that moment than ever before. His lips swollen, hair sweaty and limp against his forehead, pupils still blown wide.
Sherlock gasped into John's mouth as he began to slowly rub at it with a cupped hand, creating just the slightest bit of friction.
Slowly John removed his hand from Sherlock’s, allowing him to undo his belt and peel off his drenched jeans as they returned to sharing bruising kisses. Sherlock’s eyes fell to the bulge tenting John’s wet underwear, and he licked his lips slightly. John worked to help him out of his own trousers, and just like that there was nothing but two small pieces of fabric between them. John eyed Sherlock’s own sizeable bulge with a growl and resumed grinding down into him eagerly. Sherlock moaned, mirroring John’s movements until they had built up into an almost unbearable rhythm of friction.
He was in the middle of repacking the first aid kit when he was suddenly grabbed by the shoulders and spun around, and before he could register what was happening, a pair of lips dove forward to land awkwardly on his with such force that he had to clutch desperately at his assailant’s shirt to keep from toppling backward and cracking his head open on the coffee table. Sherlock released him a moment later and stumbled back a step, chest heaving and eyes full of embarrassment. It only took John a moment to recover from the shock of it and he grabbed Sherlock by the waist and pulled him in close. He stared at him for a moment to make sure he was really there and not some delusion and then leaned forward to press his mouth to his. Sherlock made a tiny little sound as he began to kiss John back. Hesitant, but eager to learn.
The detective eagerly stripped them off John, and he laughed at the way Sherlock was eagerly drinking him in like a child in a sweet shop, wild eyes lingering on his engorged prick.
They stepped out into a plush hallway and meandered along until they came to a gold number four proudly displayed on a mahogany door. John fished the keycard out of his pocket and fumbled with it in the slot until an obviously irritated consulting detective took it from him and opened it in one fluid motion.
Sherlock reached up to touch John’s face, infatuated and dizzy with the rush of endorphins, “You can never leave me… Please, promise you won’t leave me?”
“John, you mean more to me than anyone else in the world. You always have, but I have always been too headstrong and proud to admit it. So here I am, doing it now like I should have done a long time ago.”
Sherlock huffed and headed into the bathroom after Mycroft, but stopped in the doorway when he saw the other couple embracing against the marble counter.
“If you had bothered to even look up in the last few months, you would have noticed that your brother and I have been bonding recently. He grounds me when I feel like I’m being crushed by the weight of my life, and he makes me feel
John allowed the taller man to help him to his feet, and the pair wobbled against each other for a moment to achieve stability before climbing out of the tub and taking turns to use the bathroom to change into dry clothes.
When John entered the bedroom Sherlock was sitting on the side of the bed, hands fidgeting nervously with the sheets and his own pyjama bottoms. The doctor joined him with a frown and was immediately pushed down onto the bed. Before John could get a single word out, Sherlock's tongue was in his mouth, and his own responded instinctively.  The heat in the room rose to scorching when his lips found the side of the detective’s exquisite neck a few moments later, licking and sucking at smooth white skin.
Before John could even pull out his keys, the door was flung open by a wild-eyed consulting detective squinting into the late afternoon light as though it pained him.
Reluctantly the detective met his concerned eyes, the same eyes that had taken his breath away the very first time they met.
Before long he was close, and he lifted his head to kiss Sherlock as if his life depended on it. He became distantly aware of the fact that Sherlock was now moaning too as they kissed. John could feel him growing hard again, so he flipped them over and began aggressively rutting his bare cock against Sherlock’s pyjama bottom clad one. A moment later both men came in unison all over each other, moaning and crying out into each other’s mouths.
“Good, I will make the reservation and text you the details, since I doubt you will actually remember much of this conversation in the morning” Mycroft smiled tightly, retrieving his umbrella and rising to his feet.
He appeared almost serene, his face relaxed and lips slightly parted as his chest rose and fell in a steady rhythm, black curls flowing across his forehead that John was desperate to gently move out of his eyes.
Greg had excused himself politely after a couple of hours, leaving John alone to finish his drink and brood unhappily as he was nudged and knocked by other pub-goers who were much happier and optimistic. John had paid for his drink, took two large gulps and then replaced it back onto the beer mat as someone sat beside him in the vacant seat which Greg had once occupied.
“I… I'm rather at your mercy, John.” Sherlock blushed, “Although I have a lot of theoretical knowledge I'm rather lacking at the practical. Perhaps we could… just touch?”
John realized that every kiss he had ever had leading up to that moment was simply a rehearsal for the real thing. it felt as though Sherlock was consuming his entire soul. He couldn’t get enough of the taste of him as their tongues danced, of the way his lean form felt beneath him as he began to gently rock against him as they kissed..
“You don’t get a choice,” John answered. “We’re not a couple. You’re married to your work. You were very clear about that.”
“Greg,” John reminded him, “And do you not think that Mycroft will be able to see that on you too? That he won’t be able to tell that an hour before our
Doing his best to fight an amused smile from creeping across his face, John took a seat as instructed, sitting back and studying Sherlock curiously as he pawed through the first aid kit. A moment later he pulled out a bottle of saline solution and some wipes, before kneeling down on the floor in front of him.
“Fine, you cheeky git. Sherlock Holmes, I love you. More than I could ever have imagined it was possible to love another person. You’re my world, my shelter from the rain.”
The hotel ballroom was stiflingly warm with the crush of bodies standing around, eating from small canape trays or sipping on champagne that John imagined would cost more than a month's rent. He had already stripped out of his formal suit jacket and left it on the back of the chair, but even in just his shirt and waistcoat, he was suffocatingly hot, tugging at his collar to get a hint of relief. He looked around the room, looking for the familiar silhouette of his best friend but he couldn’t spot him. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
Do you have some fetish or something? I’m willing to go to any length to make this good for you, you daft sod.”
The older man struggled for a moment to orient himself and realized that the person responsible for his rude awakening was Sherlock. He was still shaking him, and he looked scared. John quickly understood why; rain and wind were beating down on their tent so violently it was rocking side to side. He was about to snap at Sherlock that he was indeed awake when a clap of thunder rang out, followed by a bright flash of lightning that made them both jump in the air like startled cats.
"You look as over your father's antics as I feel" he had whispered to the sleepy infant strapped to his chest, when John had apparently finally decided they were done.
John frowned but obeyed, slowly sliding back out of the detective’s body, gritting his teeth. As soon as he was clear, Sherlock grabbed the doctor and quickly rolled them so that he was on top, sliding down effortlessly and groaning at the change in angle. John’s thick cock rubbed something inside Sherlock
“Ah fantastic, thank you so much.” John responded, “I really wasn’t looking forward to paying for a cab to come all this way out and then home.”
“Sherlock, there’s something I really need to tell you,” he said quietly, unable to make himself meet Sherlock’s eyes. He already hated himself for what he had done, so surely Sherlock would hate him too.
Sherlock whispered something under his breath, his back arching on the bed and his eyes fluttering closed as he raised his hips and attempted to get more friction. John obliged happily, moving his hand in increments and gripping, teasing, touching every inch he could through the fabric.
“Why not?” Sherlock frowned, “You normally have no qu… qal...qualms about it… You’re --” he paused to take a drink and then winced at the taste,” You normally have sex on the brain.”
“You have clearly made up your mind, John, so I suppose there isn’t much point in trying to talk you out of this insanity. That man has all the personality of a wet sock, so I hope you enjoy your
“I bet you want to get up and dance…?” John asked jokingly, turning to speak to Sherlock and then realising that he had gone. Disappeared into the crowd like he often did on crime scenes. John stepped away from the dance floor, walked to the bar and found Sherlock there alone, shooting back a glass of what looked like whisky which was unusual. Sherlock rarely touched alcohol unless it had been a tough case, or if he was upset about something.
Listening with joy, John heard Sherlock’s hissed out noises turn to moans and then to shouts as they built up and up, harder and harder, with John sweating and panting down at Sherlock between passionate kisses. The sounds of sex and slickness echoed around the flat as John began to feel himself getting closer to his peak, desperately hoping that Sherlock reached orgasm first.
From up close, Sherlock looked terrifyingly large. His flushed tip was a dusky pink which was leaking clear fluid down the veined shaft, and John followed the trail with his eyes, inhaling the scent of masculine arousal so different to what he was used to.
The younger man fumbled awkwardly as he took John’s member in hand, wrapping a tight-fisted hand around it and giving it a few experimental tugs.
Leaning precariously over the giant tub, he reached out for the taps and began to fill it, too inebriated to figure out the many buttons and settings along the side.
“You can't tempt me with that mental image and then reject me! That’s… that’s just cruel John! And as a doctor, you are sworn to do no harm and this would do more harm than the stabbing!” Sherlock argued, smirking when John frowned dramatically.
But at the same time, he had made an agreement to see this plan of Mycroft’s through, and Mycroft Holmes did not strike John as a man that took well to being told no.
“We need to wash off, don’t you think?” he practically purred. He glanced back at Sherlock as he towed him down the hall, and grinned in satisfaction at the way the younger man was soundlessly gaping at him, cheeks blushing crimson.
Sherlock just sat and stared at him for a moment, taking in the incredibly sexy man in front of him with fresh eyes for the very first time.
Mycroft sat with his haughty nose in the air, looking uncomfortable as he looked at the other patrons and winced at what he was obviously deducing. John was drunk enough to hold back the noise of shock - but only just.
"Wow...is this what bears feeel like?" he marvelled, poking at Sherlock's chest hair with child-like wonder in his eyes.
Smiling warmly, John reached for the base of Sherlock’s cock, holding it upright and feeling the hot, hot heat of him against his palm. Sherlock was biting his lip, anticipating the next move and John realised that he wanted to try and pleasure Sherlock with his mouth. He wanted to taste and swallow him down, keep a part of him inside no matter how small.
“For existing. For being patient and caring enough to take the time to bring down all my walls, even the ones I didn’t know I had. For staying, even after I broke your heart.”
“I want it all…” Sherlock sighed with a touch of sadness to the comment, flicking his eyes out over the spectacular view of the estate, rubbing his wet hand over his face, “I want absolutely everything but… I have never experienced it. The -- The rush of it. The euphoria of sharing that moment of complete vulnerability with another person. Of letting your guard down and allowing another person to see you… the true you. Not the persona, not the greatcoat and brilliant mind. The man, naked and shivering with adrenaline and feeling intensely loved.”
An annoyed, exhausted John disappeared into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. Once he was out of sight, Sherlock frowned. When he stopped to think about how tired John must be, considering Rosie had let him sleep no more than a few hours a night for the last week, an unfamiliar emotion settled over him-
"Come jump with me, let's see if you're still as agile as you once" and Frank did. He started to jump with me with his hands on my hips and I on his shoulders. Surely the innkeeper will have heard all the noise we were making, but we didn't mind. We wanted to have fun at last.
"It 'does not matter. She's just a filly with a little character ", he said proudly, then added," Can I do something for you Mr. Watson? "He asked leaning on the fence.
I picked up the baby and started listening to lungs and heart, to be able to rule out more serious causes. He was just very hungry, he was putting his teeth so he could not get to the breast for the pain.
"I'm from Oxfordshire. I was traveling with a servant to visit distant relatives living in France and we came across some bandits. I was able to escape, but I was forced to abandon my horse and my belongings. As I wandered through the woods, I was suddenly attacked by Captain Jim Moriarty. I believe you know him. Now sir, I would like to go back to the way of being able to return to Inverness ".
"I'm sorry ... those fillies are dangerous?" I asked. Then I felt his foot stomping on mine, like telling me to stop.
Sherlock at those points approached me slowly. His eyes were getting sick and when he was close enough, he began to move his arms around me. With the wet cloth he began to clean the wounds with extreme care. A little 'for the cold a bit' for the discomfort I began to tremble. Sherlock, having noticed my trembling, took my clothes and dressed me carefully.
"Come on," the eldest man grabbed me by the arm dragging me beside the horse of the boy I had cared for.
"I think it started around four years ago. They had taxed all the landowners in the county. They sent small patrols of soldiers to collect food, horses for transport, and all that was needed by the British troops. It was an October day and Captain Moriarty came to us. My father was not there he went to a funeral, I was alone with Molly my sister. I was in the fields when I heard the screams. Some soldiers were holding Molly and so I attacked them. When the three men were on the ground, I saw Moriarty aim a gun at her head while she held her by the hair.
"If so commanded," he said with a satisfied grin, he was proud of putting me very uncomfortable, what a bastard.
I met Victor a very interesting man, who had some knowledge of herbs and preparations. He told me that if I wanted every now and then I could go from his shop to have a look and compare ourselves on our knowledge.
"Interesting theory. Too bad I don't think trolls live in pairs. They are usually solitary creatures, "while Frank was stealing from some objects that I found with half a smile I sat down on an old table, observing him patiently.
"Of Course I forgive you," I stretched my hands and took his face, bringing it closer to mine to kiss him passionately. Frank took the opportunity to hug me tight in a few moves undressing my pajamas, while I did the same. Once on the bed we made love with passion and desire.
"No, you're not well, you want to know how much blood you lost? You're lucky to be alive, after the fights and the horse falls, "I checked the wound before I kept talking," good! I need a sterile bandage and clean cloths. " They all looked at me speechlessly, realizing that these were not the cleanest people to talk about sterile gauzes.
"I have to go Frank. You know as much as I did that it was only a matter of time before I decided to leave, "I looked him in the eye with a thread of sadness.
"Hi, I would not be indiscreet. My name is John Watson, I came with the MacKenzie clan, I'm a healer. I heard the little girl screaming from the end of the street. Can I visit your son? "
When I regained consciousness I found myself on horseback, with a stinking stranger, or rather not exactly unknown was the man in kilt who had saved me. He took me inside a hut, and there were other men in kilts, even in their smelly and filthy as well as my savior. There was a figure bent on itself facing a stone fireplace, while another fire was burning in the center of the hut. Four men all shook in my hands. What seemed to me the older one started to talk to me.
There’s something about being unable to do anything, but having the simplest and most crucial of tasks open right in front of you, that sets my mind in circles that I can barely control. It scatters everything I think I know; disconnects them from each other. Without the connections, their evidence, they all just feel hypothetical. My hand starts to shake.
“I’ll post it tomorrow,” I said, watching my mouse automatically reach the ‘save as draft’ button. A few more clicks and my blog closes.
And there he will sit, waiting for any train, a hand on his cheek. Well, not any train. A train that he can catch with me.
There are noises outside, the scrape of cardboard and some strange tinkling. My forehead furrows, trying to listen. When the crash comes, I’m halfway out the door in a second. Instinctually, I had rushed my dressing and was fairly decent.
There’s the rustle of plastic bags grasped by a hand. The whoosh of automatic doors opening. Cold air hits my face. I can’t hear much. The soft murmur of voices. A dull ringing deep in my wet sponge brain. Those rotten leaves over there, brushing against the pavement.
I drag my eyes open. The first thing I feel is my body, stretched out as tight and rigid as a violin’s string. Sunlight is pouring through the window, blinding me.
We do, and purchase hot chocolates. He asks for extra marshmallows, and it’s so characteristic of him, I pat his shoulder once in return for earlier. He tries to smile at me. It’s lopsided with effort.
Sherlock’s shoes are suddenly right next to me. The sound of his gloved hands clapping gleefully seemed more appropriate on a child in the toy-store nearby.
“Don’t need to. Your pauses are far too long. You’re actually thinking. Balance of probability: trying to make it sound far too poetic.”
Sherlock should be here any moment now. He told me that the toy-store would be the checkpoint. There’s more than one of those around here, but he didn’t bother to clarify before he shot me a single, radiant smile and dashed off. The cheerful climate of Christmas must be rubbing off on him.
It seems that all my purpose here is to exist. While I wait around for that to expire, I take care of Sherlock.
I can tell because he brought me breakfast. Probably opened my curtains and readied my room while I slept before
“I want to talk to you tonight,” he adds in a thoughtful tone, still muffled from the kitchen. The tap of a teaspoon punctuates his thought. “The balance of your left forefinger against the keyboard indicates a greater presence of mind than usual. So you would be a more interesting conversationalist than you ordinarily are.”
A moment later, I open my eyes. The room is dark. The rest of the flat was dark when we left it, saying goodnight - he was wiping his eyes - but this is different. Even darker. There's no flickering fire. There's no gentle face aglow with tears. I'm in my room.
Sherlock doesn’t go straight to the fridge, as one would expect from a flatmate. He just stands near the doorway and looks at me for a moment, then swings around again and walks to the window. The curtain is pushed aside to give way to his penetrating gaze. A graduate chemist, a detective, a curious hobbyist, all rolled in one lanky figure. I pour tea.
He’d thrown it. Of course - why would he drop it? He has his back to me, facing the wall. But shards of glass lay on the carpet directly beneath the smiley face, and Sherlock’s back was stiffened.
Keeping the man down, I look up at him. Each of his hurried breaths turn into evening mist. His face is flushed pink as a rose, and smiling as brightly as if Christmas had come early.
I can’t see who it is. Not from this distance; this angle. My stomach is clenching, so hard. My hands clutch it.
It’s covered in shards. Smashed, shimmering baubles. Tangled fairy lights, their bulbs blown against the hard floor. Shredded tinsel.
As if in a dream, I just turn around and stride up the garden path. How many eyes do I feel on me? Do I care? All the way up to the burgundy door. Hideous colour against the mustard walls. I plant one foot against the door, draw my knee back, and kick it like a horse.
His whimpers echo all the way towards me. There are the deepest, darkest shadows beneath his closed eyes. I can’t feel much. My hand is clenching.
He’s excited. I can tell. I can see it from the frantic waving of his hands as he speaks, the light in his eyes, the way he musses his hair subconsciously as he’s driving towards a specific point. At one point, he becomes lost in thought, tapping one finger against his lip with his eyes glazed over, so I cut up my bacon and wait for him to come back.
All the suspense leaves my body in a whoosh of air. My heaving breaths are the only sound. I’m suddenly thrown by how rubbery and trembly my body feels.
Reds and blues and yellows blur by in time-lapse speed. All around him, life goes on at an accelerated rate. People walk by at dashing speed; the doors open and close fast enough to snap a person in half; the minute hand on the clocks behaves more like a second hand. The second hand is almost invisible: a blur.
Out of my room in a second. I don’t remember how I reached the stairs, but next thing I know, I’m taking them two at a time.
I put my hand on the cover of my bed, as far as I can comfortably reach. He looks at it for a moment, then puts his hand on the blanket as well.
Waves crash against the gritty shore, pulling in blustery clouds across the sky. Seagulls scream and wheel. The wind is almost too cold and sharp to stand.
A pebble skids out from beneath my shoes. Then a larger rock. It tumbles down the cliff-face, smashing into pieces on a ridge halfway down.
Sherlock’s hands are almost a blur as he passes the items through the self-checkout. I’ve seen too many blurs for one day. My stomach seems permanently clenched. I need to lie down. I’m sweating. Sherlock’s hand is on my shoulder. He’s stooping to my level, peering into my eyes. He’s saying something. Mouthing around a single word, over and over. I need to get home. I need to lie down.
We look out through the rain-streaked window into the street. Although, I only do for a moment. Then I turn my eyes to Sherlock’s, and watch them dart and twitch between each detail of the pedestrians’ appearance. So rapid and methodical. I could watch them forever, and barely glimpse what connections lay behind their movement.
His face would shine and he would smile for me. He would let himself go and sing a little and kiss Mrs Hudson’s cheek tenfold. 221B shines with his fairy lights and his laughter.
I’m itching to get inside. There are so many other people here. Maybe twenty. They can’t see inside before I do. That’s critical.
It’s hard to connect my thoughts well when I’m so close to him - and not stepping away, apparently. I hadn’t thought of it. My brain feels like mush again.
To Sherlock’s overwrought senses, it was too much. Having nothing there was too much. That’s how sensitive he felt.
Oh, if only it could be Christmas Eve. If only it could be Christmas. The lights would go up all over the city, and the nights would buzz with anticipation, and the thieves would abound, and Sherlock would be happy. He would be so happy.
Why can’t I control my own emotions about this? It’s surely nothing, and yet my stomach feels like hell.
He doesn’t look happy. He looks ill. Pale and matted and sweaty. Not wet like in the ocean, when his matted hair and drops on his skin made him look alive. He looks half-gone.
“I was conscious of entering the house,” he says placidly, an hour later, over tea. I had bundled him in a patchwork blanket that Mrs Hudson had thrown over a settee. He’s still trembling, so I hunt for another.
When the salesman arrives, I let out a huge breath. I’ve been letting it out of my lungs little by little, in harsh and short breaths, unable to inhale much, afraid to exhale. My stomach is still way too tight as I push past eager buyers and stride straight up to him. He’s wrapped in a dark blue coat that’s strangling him as he tries to haul some folders from his car backseat. By the time he straightens and turns, I’m there.
Sherlock is an adventurous man. Being near him is akin to the eye of a hurricane: you are cushioned in calm, while around you, the world rearranges itself to suit him.
"Well ... let's pound these herbs and let them brew for a while, after which we can go downstairs to drink a portman and tell us all our secrets," announced Victor pleased as he grinded some spices.
"Here ... I ..." I could not formulate a plausible excuse so I just did not look at that look, analytical and penetrating.
I often found myself observing them, studying them as if they were a very close group, even if you have my eyes there were a band of drunkards. It seemed that a deep code of honor bound them between them. As I had also felt during the war the bond that is created on the battlefield is deep enough to compare it to a blood bond between brothers. Indestructible.
"Sssh... Hush Johnny. This is our moment. I want to hear again your sounds of pleasure, when you get to the limit, I want to hear you panting under me, I want the marks of your nails on your back, I want your skin moist with sweat against mine and I want it now, "I was panting heavily after those Words, while he had begun to lick my penis with devotion. And I was already lost in a bubble of pleasure. While I was groan under his control, I had not even noticed that he had stripped himself and that he had uncorked a bottle of ointment that he wore in his trousers pocket. He put a little on his right hand and with the other he made me widen my legs.
even. Yet suddenly, every observable detail about the appearance of the man sitting next to him, that he would normally have noted with cool indifference, appeared to be bizarrely responsible for his cock steadily swelling beneath the pillow that he was clutching. The current slightly dishevelled state of his silver-blonde hair, and the way his shirt sleeves were currently rolled up to his elbows after a long day at work to reveal slightly muscular forearms,  appeared to be the most to blame.
“And you’re wrong…” Sherlock said with a touch of defiance, “Sometimes I don’t even wait until you’re in bed. Many a time I have laid on my bed with my fingers inside me whilst I listen to you potter around the flat. Whistling and humming…” he reached down with his free hand and stroked his own cock, seemingly trying to stop the ache, “And sometimes I used to try and masturbate along with you. I'd hear you go in the shower or in your bedroom and I would try and follow you. You think you’re being quiet but you’re really not.”
When she was gone, both men looked at each other before bursting into a fit of side-splitting laughter, clinging to one another.
He shook away the thought and stumbled out of the tent, blinking against the harsh mid-morning light.
Sherlock removed John’s hand, and nervously gave the tip of his flushed prick an experimental lick, swiping through the precome gathering at the slit, and John groaned loudly.
John had his back turned to Sherlock as he said the word, stupidly choosing that moment to turn to put a cup back in the cupboard. But he didn’t miss the hitching inhale, the change in atmosphere as Sherlock computed what John had just said.
, Sherlock!” John hissed at the deliciously sinful wet heat engulfing him, prompting the uncertain younger man to lower his mouth further and further down John’s length with every moan and expletive John uttered. He hit the back of Sherlock’s throat, and the detective gagged.
“I suppose I ought to be, but I was so taken aback that you would willingly go to so much effort and self-sacrifice to actually resent you for it. Plus, you hate Mycroft almost as much as I do.”
my back. I’m not a spring chicken like you anymore, Sherlock” he reminded him breathlessly, offering the flushed and half-ruined man beneath him an apologetic smile.
By the time he got to ten, a sex crazed detective threw open the shower door and slammed John against the tiled wall.
He envisioned those long, slender fingers caressing his balls as he swallowed him down, reaching further back toward his entrance.
After peering down at the baby for a moment to make certain she was sleeping, Sherlock rose with a sigh and padded over to a large box of lights. He retrieved the huge tangled ball of bulbs and began diligently attempting to untangle them.
Their arms tensed around one another, squeezing just an inch more in the fluorescent lights of the bathroom.
"Y..yes, quite alright" Sherlock eventually answered, his voice so quiet John almost didn't hear the words despite their closeness.
"That was the hottest thing I've ever seen" John announced, gazing up at the ravished man above him who was busy basking in the afterglow.
. The feelings you possess for Sherlock are so obvious you might as well wear a neon, flashing sign. Obvious to everyone but Sherlock, apparently.”
“So how long?” Sherlock asked him when John rejoined him on the floor, entwining his legs with the smaller man’s and wrapping his arms around him.
“Fucking hell,” John muttered to himself with a dopey grin on his face, pushing open their unlocked front door and hanging up his coat and kicking off his shoes. He called out a greeting to Sherlock, aware that the man was around somewhere as he had seen the curtains twitching. Baker Street was still, tense, awaiting a confrontation and holding its breath.
“No!” Sherlock scoffed. “You were the best big brother. How else would I  have learnt that the hottest planet in our solar system is 450° C?”
“You used to think I could do magic and conjure up thoughts from people's subconscious… but how is it that you always know what I’m going to say?” Sherlock asked, allowing himself to be tugged down to the bed and positioned so that his head was directly above John’s heart, over his bare chest. John curled his hand up and casually stroked Sherlock’s hair, soothing him with the innocent touches as they shared that moment.
That was when he realised that John was still wearing the underwear, and a devious plan began to form in his head.
“You are many things, John, but a good liar isn’t one of them. As you talked you presented every sign of someone not telling the truth there is. But I had to be sure, hence sending the informant that I’m sure my brother would have spotted quite immediately.”
John slapped his arm, staring intensely into his lover's hypnotising eyes. "Say it. I want to hear you say it."
Sherlock watched him curiously as he dug through his suitcase until he triumphantly retrieved a bottle of lube.
Sherlock found it rather odd that the older man's closeness was causing him to react in such a way. He had been just as close to John dozens of times in the past on cases-hell,
Sherlock moaned loudly as John gradually slid deeper until he bottomed out, John tossing his head back at the feeling of finally being completely buried inside him.
John had been glad he had worn his thickest pair of black trousers so thankfully nobody could see the wet spot, but it was obvious when he took them off that the fabric was soaked through. Sherlock reached for the pants, giving it a rub between his fingers and then popping his fingers into his mouth with a soft groan of pleasure. John, who was fighting very hard against an erection was standing in very unfitting lacy pants which did nothing to contain his cock and balls and had him awkwardly attempting to position himself up and into the gusset. He looked fairly ridiculous standing there in nothing but black lace, but Sherlock purred and reached for his lover, pulling him closer and dipping his head so he could take the wet and reddened tip into his mouth to suckle on it.
“Come on, let’s go to bed. But we won’t do anything you aren’t ready for, Sherlock” he whispered reassuringly, taking Sherlock’s hand to lead him to his bedroom. The whole way Sherlock grumbled behind him about not being treated like a ‘sodding blushing virgin’, and John had to suppress a laugh and bite his tongue to keep himself from reminding the other man that was exactly what he was.
“Bossy,” John grumbled happily before opening Sherlock's trousers, helping the detective to shimmy out of them until the fabric fell to the bedroom floor with a wisp of sound. Sherlock's cock was tenting his pants massively, the placket of his boxers was soaked through with precome which only made the long line of him more noticeable. John's mouth watered as he let his hand move across that bulge, cupping it and feeling his hand become wet from the ejaculate.
Suddenly Sherlock couldn’t breathe, a sudden gasping of breath forcing its way through his throat as Sherlock felt his heart begin to pound and his stomach roll sickly. Something was wrong and Sherlock didn’t know what. Thankfully, John had heard the noise and turned, immediately rushing to Sherlock’s side and bending down beside the sofa with a worried frown.
There was a flurry of French in the background, an irate sounding Mycroft ranting before the door was slammed behind them and Mycroft returned to the phone.
An audible gasp escaped John and he recoiled involuntarily, his mouth falling open. He remained silent for a long moment, stiff as a board.
I went back to my rooms. It was now time for dinner, but I did not find the strength to go to the common room and eat with the people of the castle. I crouched in a chair and contemplated the glow I saw beyond the window of the room.
"Seriously though, if it bothered you, you should tell me. I could have taken her away from the stables the other day. "
"If this is a gesture of sympathy for you, I would be afraid to be your friend," I said in a decidedly contemptuous tone.
"Well now that I have won, you will be good and you will come with me," he told me with a tone of superiority and I took the opportunity to trip him and drop him to the ground by placing the blade of the sword at his neck.
"Yes, maybe with time. He lost a son last night, "while he was saying this, he made the sign of the cross, as if to exorcise the evil one.
"Soon wake up, lazy man" Mrs. Hudson came into my room screaming, as I jumped on the bed in terror, I had just woken up very abruptly.
"Well, I didn't have much choice if I hadn't moved my shoulder I wouldn't have moved any more" he announced satisfied.
"Do you really believe that demons live in this place?" I did not expect Holmes to believe certain legends.
"Eat a lot I try to clean your face." He started with a cloth to wipe my eye and nose. He did it with such care that it almost seemed surreal. I found myself contemplating his hands and his long, tapering fingers and the color of his skin so clear that it was milky. In sharp contrast with the curly raven hair, almost like a mythological creature.
"Are you asking me if I have been faithful to you?! Really Frank? "I began to wander about the room, unable to look him in the eye.
"But to this dear, we can fix it right away," at these words Mrs. Hudson grabbed me by the arm and dragged me into one of the castle rooms.
"I think I could save his life, the boys ingested this leaf. It is lily of the valley is practically the same as the bear's garlic, only that this is poisonous. I can give Tamas an antidote for the poison but we have to hurry, "I announced.
Dougal's plan was to go to the various clans and collect taxes. Wandering through the villages I remained enchanted by the tranquility of their everyday life. The air we breathed was similar to the harmony I had experienced as a child when I played on my uncle's country estate. Too bad that my walks always ended up being pulled by an arm by one of Dougal's henchmen, to be able to keep an eye on. I had never been so violent and uncooperative with those who held me hostage for their comfort.
"They do not hang around very much, they climb up, maybe they challenge the devil by urinating on the stones and if they're lucky, they'll find berries or ramsons to eat."
"Wait here." I went back to the clinic to get an ampoule of horse dung, harmless except for the smell. Sherlock would not have noticed. I took my belongings and went back to Leary.
"I said let me go, this is vulgar and inappropriate" I made to get up but Sherlock grabbed my life and changed positions, finding himself now above me. The only thing I could see beyond his black curls was his mischievous eyes. I could feel my heart beating madly.
"Oh ... you're trying to escape what I see. Leaving aside the fact that in that bag there is not enough provisions for a trip to Inverness. Do you really believe you can go out there and face only thirty armed guards? "
"Know that even if I'm hurt, I can kick you when I want. If you do not immediately stop teasing me, you'll find yourself without teeth, "I snarled at him.
A few moments later, turning, he looked at me questioningly, almost suspiciously. I did not feel at all comfortable. Until then I had not realized that I was shaking, my clothes were torn from rain and mud, I was full of tears and now my shirt was definitely to be thrown away.
"Here ... if I remember correctly it was OSTRUCTURE", while he was talking, I was trying to wrap his shoulder wound.
"Exact also known as Black Jack. A bold nickname that perhaps was given to him while he was here in 1740. The Reverend has found dispatches where the captain's real name appears. "
After the war and all the horrors we had seen, Frank and I decided to take a trip, to understand both where we were in our lives after five years of distance. In the Scottish Highlands, we stopped in Inverness to find out more about the origins of Frank's family.
