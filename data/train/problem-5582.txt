Tony started at a slow pace, to absorb Steve's tightness and warmth. His internal walls squeezed his member in such a comfortable way that it was impossible to pound his Omega without first enjoying the sensation.
Against all odds, Tony liked his cake and Steve knew it from the little moan the doctor made when he ate it. That was good news, right?
Tony licked his lips as he appreciated the view. The amount of natural lubrication told him that Steve was ready to be fucked. Just as he wanted. He took a condom and put it on.
Tony put Steve down and the blonde sat on the floor, taking the brunette with him. Tony pulled him closer to hug him and kiss him on the forehead and Steve leaned against the Alpha's chest to rest for a moment.
The participants smiled flirtatiously.
Call him selfish, but he had enough of the few stolen moments that he had with the brunette since he came to town. Two years ago.
"Low blow, but that doesn't mean I can't seduce any Omega or Beta in town," Tony said maliciously.
"Not really. What bothers me is that you are so shy, well, at least with me."
"Well, life gives surprises, doesn't it?"
Every time Tony lunged on him he hit his prostate and Steve couldn't ask for anything better. The best sex of his life, although with Tony everything would be wonderful, in any aspect of his young life. They would be the envy of all the town.
Tony smiled at how creative Steve could be. He carried him, with little difficulty, and used the wall for support to continue his lunges. Steve with his legs wrapping around his hips. It was paradise.
"Ready not to walk for the rest of your life?" Tony laughed and Steve did too.
He didn't have time to think about it and brought that length to his mouth. He started slow, first covering the head, stimulating the head with his lips. He didn't have much experience doing blowjobs, his sex history was down to 2 people. Unbelievable for an Omega like him. Despite that, Tony moaned and gasped, certain proof that he was doing his job well.
Surrendered to his pleasures, Steve couldn't control what he was saying. He was unaware of what his vocal cords could articulate and could only trust his inner Omega to express what he wanted to say.
Steve couldn't complain either, that's what he had asked for. Tony was wonderful, able to fulfill his dreams and if limping was a consequence, happily, he could live in a wheelchair.
"No, you really are handsome, the most handsome man I've ever seen." Steve blushed more even more.
To his surprise, Tony himself visited the place to check that everything was ready and the presence of the blonde did not go unnoticed by him.
Having his mother was a blessing and for these moments of uncertainty, she was crucial in calming his senses. After all, she was right, having fun would be the priority, although that didn't mean he wouldn't fight to win that date with Dr. Stark.
It was a large space made to fit everyone, especially the side where the cakes would be prepared. It had tables with the names of the participants. In total, there were 9. Nine people, between women and men, Omega and Betas, who would compete with him to win Dr. Stark. Or rather, his doctor Stark.
His mother had taught him some extra tips the night before and he wrote down every detail in his mind to put them into practice.
And his mind exploded. Not even in his wildest dreams could he have imagined that moment. Winning the contest and with it the most beautiful satisfaction. His mind was elsewhere, trying to assimilate what was happening. He was not fully conscious when he screamed with joy and the participants looked at him in anger and helpless frustration.
"Are you seriously wondering? You are my little patient, the most recurrent."
Steve smiled back. His mother was a very good counselor. She always found the right words to lift anyone's spirits.
"I guess you're right. Thanks, Mom.”
That news was a shock for his senses because he was sure that he would look ridiculous in front of the Alpha. He thought about opposing his mother, but she had given him the push that he did not dare to do and if he was honest with himself, deep down, he was grateful.
Tony took his face and kissed him slowly but deeply, communicating all his love for the blonde, letting him know that he was not disappointed.
"I agree with you."
Again Steve wanted to say something about it, but Tony cut him off with a quick movement.
Steve was surprised, he hadn't noticed anything going on.
"How demanding."
Tony wouldn't last long. Not with so many feelings and emotions together and Steve either. They both felt their orgasm close, the second one in Steve's case.
There was no one supervising the process and that was rare. Steve thought that at some point someone would, but that person never came. And then, the jury showed up.
With nothing to slow them down, Steve leaned against the table, displaying that shapely ass, somewhat muscular as well. Tony couldn't wait and if he was honest, he didn't want to be picky when he had waited a long time for that moment.
Tony's mind was a frenzy of sensations just like Steve's. He longed for his cock to get the attention it always wanted.
"Do you want to do the same thing I just did to you?" He said blushing.
Steve felt like heaven. His entrance was ready to receive the doctor, but it seemed that Tony had other plans before he got to that part. Each coming and going of Tony caused spasms and within minutes he felt his orgasm close by. He thought he should stop Tony, not end that magical moment so quickly, but the moans prevailed as he came into Tony's mouth.
"I always loved you, my doctor. I always dreamed of you fucking me in your office. With you making love to me and waking up next to me the next day in your room." He moaned as Tony started kissing his neck.
Tony felt another tug on his cock. He listened to his Omega and took the place that a few seconds ago was Steve's. He hunched forward until his chest touched the warm wood of the table and exposed his entrance. No, he was not ashamed to do that, he knew that he was by Steve's side and that he would do what he could to please him. Prejudices could go to hell.
"A thousand times without hesitation," Steve said and lowered Tony's boxers.
All the body heat of both in one position. Both inside and outside.
Although his mother had taught him the basics, he did not have that talent. He practiced as many times as he could, but ended up accepting that cakes just weren't his thing, although the worst would come when Sarah came home with the news.
When the time was up, Steve had his cake ready, or as he called it, his cake attempt. Visually it was not bad, but in taste, he supposed it had gone bad, again.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """""""""""""""""""""""
"Well, young people," Tony began "I hope you have put all your effort into those cakes because the prize is worth it, that is me."
"I'm your mother and I know you. Don't deny me your nervousness, because I can see it from miles away. Now be honest and tell me what's wrong with you.”
"Hey, you didn't think you could get out of unpacking, did you?"
No response.
“Hey, Nat.”
It jolts me out of my thoughts so abruptly that for a moment all I can do is stare at him. My mouth twitches into a smile that I attempt to hide by turning back to the road; a futile effort. I know he saw it. I can see his own smile in my periphery.
I lower my brows at him. Unconvinced. He offers a stiff smile that does little to persuade me, then reaches over and turns the music back up again.
“No, I’m gonna need you to put down the drinks, look me in the eyes—”
I don't remember my dreams.
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
I turn on the radio to a 90’s-to-now station and crank it, just to have something else to focus on besides the road ahead of me, Steve’s intense stare, and the doubts in my head. Steve lets a few songs play out without protest  before turning the volume down a couple notches. “They’re gonna ask us why we’re showing up together.”
He side-eyes me. “Can we focus? Which panel?”
“Oh, Sam! I’m, uh…sorry, did I wake you?”
"Come in, come in."
The screen changes, and I'm presented with a series of virtual folders, each labeled with the name of someone close to me, and my favorite picture of the subject. Not necessarily the most flattering picture, but my favorite. They're sorted in order of closeness, proximity, amount of logs, and though there's a wide variety, each folder has one thing in common: they're all recorded and logged from my glasses, and no one—and I mean no one—is allowed to know about them.
“Don’t go outside without your coat, silly, you’re gonna catch a cold,” Tony says, patting my cheek with his metal hand. And then he ducks back into the house.
It’s just him this time.
“All of it. I wouldn’t have done any of this if you hadn’t pushed me to, so…I appreciate it.”
“You’re going to shrink down and infiltrate one of those shipments, get inside the loading area, and from there I need you to get to the control room and disable the security system.”
My knees hit the ground with a clank, and then the room falls morbidly silent. No operatives are left standing. They're strewn about the room in a haphazard fashion, and even in the dim light I can see dark patches of blood steadily pooling from their wounds. I'm reminded, bitterly, of the dreams. Of lying in the middle of the battlegrounds, watching my friends get picked off one-by-one, and lying there until something—or someone— wakes me up.
“Buck. Great to see you.” And it really is, though it’s difficult to mask my surprise. I didn’t expect Bucky to get an invite, all things considered, but I suppose Tony is just full of surprises these days.
"Do you think you'll ever get back out there?" Rhodey asks.
“Yes, and I hate you for it.” I accept the call. “Tony Stark isn’t available right now, leave a message after the raspberry.
“That’d be nice.”
“Right.”
"Hm." Steve digs into the paper bag that he's been holding between his knees and produces a packet of fries and a hamburger. He passes the burger to me, which I snatch eagerly, and pops a fry into his mouth. "Is that bad?"
But they leave me with an ever-present sense of hope.
“Tony.”
And then that dumbass sticks out his hand. I stare at it, smirk, take it, give it a firm shake. “It’s a date, Cap.”
[Steve shouts]
I keep sneaking glances at Tony, trying to gauge his reaction. He’s looking around the room, inspecting the decorations.
My kisses start traveling away from his lips, onto his chin, his nose, the underside of his jaw, his temple. He laughs and wraps his arms around the small of my waist, tugging me down to lie on top of him. I graze my lips over his neck, his adams apple, the slope of his shoulder, his earlobe. I want to trace all the hills and valleys of his form with my mouth. I want to memorize him with my lips.
I lead him out of my apartment and lock the door after us. “I’m driving,” I say.
Well, at least my numbness isn’t chest-exclusive anymore.
A tremor courses through the uneven terrain, pulsing outward from the facility in waves as it continues its all-too-steady implosion; the whole building is leaning, now, on a crumbling foundation. Windows pop like fireworks. Those Hydra bastards wanted to go out in style, I guess, and I'm in no mood to stay for the show.
The inside of Antones lives up to expectations as well. Warm, close quarters, filled with circular tables and booths upholstered with cracked red leather. I request a booth in the back, and the hostess leads us through a pair of double-doors into a smaller, darker room that’s lit mostly with candles and string lights wound around the ceiling beams.
I ease myself out of bed. Reattach my arm. The world feels like it’s swaying a bit, though I think that’s just me. I stumble out of my bedroom and down the stairs with care, making a slow beeline to my kitchen. There are only two things on my mind: aspirin and coffee.
“Hi,” I say. Pause. “It’s Tony.”
“No, I just…”
“Right,” he says. “Well, if you’re good…I should probably get going.”
Tony’s air of cool indifference melts into wide-eyed disbelief. “What, really? Wait, wait, wait— You’re telling me you’ve had this favorite-restaurant-since-the-fucking-forties card stowed away in your back pocket this whole time and I’m the one you decide to use it on?”
Sam gives a long, low whistle. That's our signal—no turning back now.
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
"Alright. Robots," I say, rolling my neck. "I can do robots."
His legs are crossed,  supporting a magazine that he’s thumbing through lazily, and he’s coddling a steaming cup of what I can only presume to be coffee in his other hand. He doesn’t seem to have noticed my entrance, so I clear my throat, a little too loud. He jumps slightly and closes the magazine. It’s a really old edition of Home and Garden. “Tony, you’re awake. Good.”
I pull away and sit up, just enough to look him in the eyes. I'm also out of breath and my cheeks feel unnaturally warm—I wonder if he can tell. "Sorry, I'm just...
And then he hangs up. I stare at my phone for an extra moment, trying to process what just happened. And then, slowly, it dawns on me; if I wanted to experience the spontaneity of Tony Stark, I suppose I’ve bought myself front row seats.
I draw back to look at his face. For the first time in quite a while, he seems relaxed. At peace. Radiating calm satisfaction. "What's next on the docket?"
“I think I should just tuck-and-roll.”
I shake my head. “Just distracted, I guess.”
The concept of keeping up with this conversation has long since been out of the question. “Is this a prank call? Are you gonna ask if my refrigerator’s running next?”
"Thanks, means a lot. Okay, anyway. Uh. Good. Now that you have a clear mental image, just one quick...minuscule...tweak, nothing major, but—those two beloved friends and coworkers are me and Steve. Me and Steve are a couple. Cheers!" I raise my glass again and down the rest of it in one gulp, while the room erupts into muddled chaos.
“Well, I didn’t walk.”
As for myself, when I'm not hovering around his station, I fill the time by helping him pack. I learned quickly that out of the two of us, I'm the only one that packs with any semblance of organization, so I took on the role of head supervisor. Helping him cull, organize, fold...and scolding him when he throws a bunch of junk into a box without batting an eye.
“Not Olive Garden. Trust me, I think you’ll like it,” I say. I offer my elbow, which he accepts hesitantly, threading his arm through mine and hooking them together.
“Haven’t heard from you since the party. You’re not dying on me again, are you?”
“Why?”
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
"Takeout: a reward for a hard day's work. I was thinking
"It's all thanks to you."
No time to question it. I re-engage and hover between the trees, taking care to stay hidden this time while I scan the perimeter. Three hatches have opened up in the roof of the facility, revealing long-barreled guns of some sort all pointing straight in my direction— most likely energy beams, possibly heat seeking.
“I was excited, alright? I haven’t been on a date in like five years. Sue me.”
I shiver involuntarily and offer a slight nod.  He turns back to me. “Do you want to go for a ride?”
“Standing sounds pretty good to me.”
And then I’m alone again.
"You're an Avenger now, Pete, whether you feel ready for it or not. You've done and seen things that a kid your age should never be exposed to and yet you've shown nothing but potential." I grasp his shoulder and give him a gentle shake. "I would be doing a disservice if I didn't ensure that you're ready to tap into that potential the next time you need to. Do you understand?"
“She has access to the bluetooth speakers, if that’s what you’re getting at. You gotta ask nicely, though.”
"Tony, I need you over here
“Is this an interrogation? I dunno, it just felt like time to jump back into the saddle, or whatever. Nick Fury is very persuasive,” I say. My pulse is pounding, now, matching the insistent rhythm of my headache. Fuck.
"Only...only if you agree to it, though."
He turns to the audience and extends his glass. "Well, I'd like to make a toast, as well. To all of our wonderful friends, and the gift of warmth, patience, and kindness they've given us on this day. We are truly grateful."
“Wait—”
"Rhodes, we can't just stand here anymore."
“You make me second-guess everything, Tony. Do you know how hard it is to do that?”
“Ready?” Tony says, giving my hand a little squeeze.
It's darker than pitch in here, and the air is thick with smoke that pours from an unknown source. It's hot, suffocating, disorienting, and I'm immediately thrown into a coughing fit. It doesn't matter. None of this matters anymore. I cover my mouth with the crook of my arm and run, shield raised above my head, trusting blind faith that the ground, or my legs, don't give out beneath me.
"As long as you don't cut off his other leg, too," Rhodes says.
"I'm glad you're alive," I say.
I wonder if he’s mad at me under that smile. I wonder if he knows how much he means to me. I wonder if he knows just how utterly terrifying this all is.
I approach slowly. “Is it good?” I ask. “Do you actually want me to be here?”
"Noted. Now get your ass down here, there's a swarm of them—" He cuts off, followed by the sound of grunting, the clank of metal against metal.
I shake my head. “Fury’s probably right.”
“It’s fine. I’ll get it. Just—move.”
The valley looks so small, yet so vast. Filled with what looks like model trees, and a winding road that looks little more than a squiggly line drawn in the earth. I tighten my grip. “It’s beautiful.”
"Nope," I say, and close my helmet.
"Shuffling all."
Steve makes a tutting sound but smiles anyway. I decide to omit the fact that I shot a hole into my bathroom ceiling this morning while brushing my teeth.
Tony lets the words settle before reaching out with a shaky hand. I accept it and bring his fingers up to my lips, finally meeting his gaze as I kiss his knuckles. Tear stains leave shimmering channels down his cheeks. He takes in a hiccuping breath. "You're a noble man. I always loved that about you, you know. But sometimes you're too noble for your own good."
doesn't do takeout."
He hovers just out of reach. “I’m taking off your training wheels,” he says. “Push with the sides of your skates. You can also shuffle if that’s easier for you.”
Logline:
He opens his mouth to say something else, seems to think better of it, and plants himself in my high-backed office chair. I turn back to my work, but can’t focus. His eyes are boring a hole into the back of my skull. Sitting with that damn perfect posture, a hand on each knee, index fingers tapping with restless energy. I put down my tools. “What? There’s a staring fee, you know.”
“Alright, alright, I concede,” I pant. “F.R.I.D.A.Y, play
"Hell yeah I am."
"Steve..."
"How's that for emotional range?" Steve says, just to me.
My stomach turns. I don't have time to think about it. Or anything. I shut my helmet once more, aim down at the smoldering remains of the nearest gun, and blast it until the wreckage falls away in a plume of smoke. I leap through the opening feet-first.
The only thing I do know is that I’m going to this party. Morbid curiosity, maybe.
He’s still looking at me with that dumbfounded expression. He turns around in his chair and back. “Are you sure you’ve got the right guy? Maybe you know another Tony.”
"Tony. There might be another way."
I barely have a moment to register the situation before Tony grabs the nape of my neck with his prosthetic, cold metal sending shockwaves down my spine, and mashes his face into mine. It’s not like any kiss I’ve ever experienced before; messy, rough, electric. Fueled by frustration. Sustained by everything we’ve left unspoken until this moment. Tony’s mouth is insistent, and it’s all I can do to lean into it. I place my hands on Tony’s hips and pull him tighter to my body.
Steve laughed loudly. "You're not a common Alpha either. I'm not saying it because of your size, I don't know, you are very tender, despite your vigor and dominance, but say it correctly. Do you want me to eat your ass?"
"Well... it's nice."
"Oh Steve, you're doing great. I love you, keep going."
"But how…"
10:00 am
That feeling was definitely much greater than everything he could have imagined. He felt silly, he thought that his fingers could simulate the excitement he felt at that moment, but it was not even the thousandth part of the whirlwind of sensations that Tony was causing him.
"Well, you will carry me in your arms, my ass hurts."
"You're gifted here, Steve. Did you ever notice that?" Tony said as he pumped Steve's member slightly making Steve gasp.
Of course, they weren't supposed to cheat and Steve was very clear about that. He supposed the others wouldn't either, but knowing that Dr. Stark would be the jackpot, anyone could have an ace up their sleeve.
"It's a rare date, we came to your work."
When he got to Steve's table, specifically the last one to try, Tony smiled at him. Steve felt his body faint.
"You don't need to justify yourself to me. I suppose an Alpha must have the same sensitivity, but after this, you will fuck me for as long as I want. I will see how durable you are. I won't mind that you're tired."
"I love you too, Tony, but right now I want you inside me. I think so much waiting has been enough."
Tony took courage with those words. He felt fortunate to have an exceptional Omega who understood him.
"I love you, Steve Rogers."
"That was very good, Tony," He kissed him briefly "Why did you stop?"
He stayed inside, not moving, waiting for Steve to adjust to his size. When Steve himself tried to move his ass, Tony initiated the lunges.
"Me too, Steve. I love you too, I will never get tired of saying it, because only seeing you was enough for you to invade my heart.”
"Me too, bossy." He approached and kissed him.
Time passed slowly. Every minute was torture. Steve felt like every second that passed was an opportunity that was lost because, inside his head, the cake would not end up being pleasant. Seeing the other participants didn't help much either. There was a lot of confidence on their faces. Satisfied looks, probably because they knew their cakes would be delicious.
"I'll be honest, stubborn blonde. Yes, the other cakes might be better. What do I know, fluffier, better decorated or sweeter, but I chose yours because unlike them, you made an effort. If you had been in my shoes, you would have noticed that some cheated."
"Now you'll see. I swear that after this day, you will never see other Alphas attractive. You will only think of me."
"I suppose now I have a date with you." Steve said with his head slightly lowered.
He placed Steve back on the table and looked at his length. It was definitely not an ordinary Omega. His size and musculature were not common. He knew that some Omegas could inherit some Alpha genes without modifying their Omega nature, although they were few.
Steve was in fantasy limbo. Arousal overwhelmed his mind and his body began to speak for him. Quickly his entrance began to produce slick.
"If we talk about size, I think you might lose. Despite me being an Omega, I am taller than you."
The cake was delicious and fluffy. The perfect example of how a cake should be baked, but unfortunately none of his attempts were successful. He had the steps, but when it was time to mix everything, something went wrong and the cake got ruined. By that time, he was hoping for a miracle.
Reality or not, Steve was curious and imagined that he could stimulate Tony in another way while working on his entrance. With his fingers, he stroked his perineum and testicles with slow movements.
"It is only this right? You don't want me to fuck you too, do you?"
His birthday and especially the decisive date. He maintained the same conviction as a few days ago. His mother was a fighter and therefore, he would be too.
Tony felt his experience and durability go to hell. He felt his orgasm very close and unlike Steve, he did have to stop it in order to fuck him.
Tackling that length was challenging for him, but Tony was not giving up, much less with Steve. His Omega deserved to be pleasured.
Tony's clothes were not lucky either. Steve unbuttoned his shirt, the belt was quickly removed and the jean pants lowered roughly, revealing the huge bulge trapped in his boxer shorts. Tony was big and Steve could see him. He wondered if he could take something that size, but he didn't care. It didn't matter if he couldn't walk the next day. Being able to remember his moment of passion with Tony, would be enough.
"I'll take you right now if that's what you want."
"What are you talking about?”
"This is not a date. Call it a pre-date, technically the winner would go out with me on Monday, but when it comes to you, I have to make a small exception." He looked him in the eyes, with some flirtation
"Does it bother you? I mean, I'm taller and my cock can be compared to yours." Said the blonde.
Sarah walked over to Steve and lightly stroked his head. She was witness to her son's deep connection to Dr. Stark and it caused her sadness to see that her son's feelings were not reciprocated.
"What do you want, Stiff?" Steve laughed.
"I love you Tony. I will always do it.”
Tony smiled and stimulated the head with his finger making Steve moan.
Slowly he harbored more of Tony's length until the retching appeared. Steve tried to hold back his gagging, but due to his inexperience, he had to release Tony's cock.
"What makes you think that? Taste your cake and you will see that I was not wrong."
Tony's tongue ran over and over his ass. Shame, slight but present, showed on his face. He never thought it would feel so good.
A few more lunges and Steve came hard, holding Tony even closer. The doctor couldn't hold out long against Steve's orgasm either, and he came almost at the same time. He barely kept Steve safe in his arms.
And although Steve wanted to avoid the slight embarrassment he felt in being in front of the doctor, in addition to the embarrassment caused by his unexpected victory, he could not escape the presence of Stark.
Not being in heat, the knot did not form and neither did the need to form a bond.
And so the competition began. The rules were simple. An hour and a half to bake a cake. The timing may be irrational, but for beginners like them, the timing was prudent. Everything was at the participant's free choice, be it measurements, size, portions, and taste.
"This, my "victory" " said the blond. Imitating the quotation marks with his fingers "Clearly I did not win because of my talent in baking."
"I thought I said I wanted you inside me," Steve said with a demanding tone. Tony was surprised at how dominant Steve could be.
Steve smiled nervously and he could swear Tony winked at him.
"Suppose. It's nice to see you here, we'll see what you're made of. See you later." And with that, he continued on his way.
Tony could not deny that the cakes were delicious, each one had a different detail, like their own stamp that each participant put on their cakes.
“The fair is for fun, Steve. I bet no one knows about pastry, there is hardly one baker in town. Be yourself, have fun and you will get more than you think.” she smiled at him.
"Do you want me inside you, my stubborn blond?" Steve nodded furiously and Tony lifted him to place him on the table slowly, hugging him, trying to feel his body heat and inhaling Steve's scent.
Steve hesitated for a moment. He was so lost in what might happen at the fair that he had barely listened to his mom talking.
___________________________________
Steve found it strange to go to an office on a date. He thought that the least expected place to speak with someone on a date was their workplace, but he preferred that rather than dying of heat on the street. They walked in and Steve sat in the chair he always took when he arrived bruised from a fight and Tony sat at the table. Strange for Steve, but he didn't say anything.
From afar, his mother was watching him and reassured him and he silently thanked him.
When he was done with Steve, he timidly stood up and turned him to face him.
"You are a handsome Alpha, I agree that any Omega would want to have sex with you."
"Hi, Steve. It's a surprise to see you here, I thought you were indifferent to the art of pastry."
"Do you think you can carry me?" Steve asked.
“As I’ll ever be.”
A smile pulls up the corners of his lips, slowly, messily—like he's too tired to properly control the motor functions in his face. "Read my mind."
She laughs. "Well, in any case, I'm throwing my support in the ring. You two are like family to me, of course I'm going to have your back. Like family should. Congratulations, boys."
"Please, I have to do this."
“Good, because I only brought the one suit.”
“Nat wanted me to check on you,” he says. No hello, straight to business.
T: On what grounds?
. Stubborn, fearless too. I realized all the things we could do if we worked together instead of working against each other.”
He coughs. “I’m starting to think the only thing you know about me is my name. I’m hurt, honestly. We’ve known each other how long? F.R.I.D.A.Y, order a copy of my autobiography for Cap, here, on me. I think he needs to brush up on his history. My history. He needs to brush up on…me. Did I say that right?”
“I should hope so.”
"How does it feel?" I ask, perching on the arm of his leather couch.
“Maybe,” Rhodey says. “But I don’t think that’s all there is to it. Last time Tony was like this, he was actually— like, literally— dying.”
I'm met with a sea of concerned faces. No affirmatives, no negatives. I can see the gears turning, especially in Natasha; she glances from me, to Steve, back to me, and arches an eyebrow.
I pull a suit out of the back of my closet. It’s fancier than I would normally wear on a date, but Steve isn’t exactly throwing me any lines, so I toss it onto the pile of maybes. I can’t afford to spend all night on this, given that I still haven’t showered today and I objectively smell like ass.
Scott jumps, dropping his phone into his plate of nachos. “Ah, yes? Present.”
I'm staring past all of them. My short-lived relief has already worn off. Come on, Tony. There's movement inside the building, I can see it— a figure stumbling through the smoke. I'm the first to the door, and just manage to catch a limp Scott Lang as he falls to his knees in front of me. One of his arms is drenched in blood, spouting from a sizable gash in his shoulder, and his complexion is paler than a ghost. I open my mouth. Nothing comes out. In an instant, the others are by my side.
“Can we get back to the subject of the argument, please?”
Steve
"Catwalk," Scott sputters. His voice is faint and weak, topped off with a guttural cough. "Inside. On the...on the..." Another cough, worse than the last. Rhodes and I share a look.
"Yeah, I've noticed."
“I’m not sure if ‘fine’ is the right word to use, but sure,” I say under my breath, regretting it as soon as the words pass my lips; exhaustion has started eating away at my ability to censor myself. I know they both heard it, too. Even the slightest whisper would be impossible to miss in such palpable silence.
Scott pulls himself to his feet and staggers backwards, steadying himself against the railing. "Tony, I—I gotta help you. Maybe...maybe if I went mega, I could pick up the pillar!"
"Mhm, truly disappointing."
“You flatter me, chief. Really. But aren’t there…uh…other operatives you could put on the case?”
T: Big whoop, I can do that too.
I can see the gears turning in their heads, struggling to put a puzzle together without all the pieces.
Lets hope our luck doesn't run out.
"FRIDAY, pause."
in sharpie. I stare at it for a moment. The handwriting is familiar, but I don’t let myself jump to conclusions. At least, not until I get inside, slice it open with my fingernail and come face-to-face with a gaudy Iron Man themed birthday card. I flip it open. Tony’s scrawled a note: “You’re cordially invited to a kick-butt Christmas/housewarming party on the 20th. Be there, be square. Oh wait, that’s not a threat to you, is it? Hah. Anyway, you better be there, a-hole. Party starts at 6PM. Presents not required, but I wouldn’t complain…. ;)”
He meets my eyes. His are tearing up. So are mine.
“Don’t worry, it happens every time I tell someone about my daily routine. I guess I’m just that boring.”
“No, I mean—why ice skates?”
“Okay.”
S: You're such an ass, give me that.
Peter's eyes are wide as saucers as he steps into my living room. Well, stumbles; the floor is strewn with cardboard boxes that Steve has been pressuring me to unpack, and it's created a maze of sorts by the elevator. I'm waiting until he gets fed up enough to do it himself, which works up until I have to entertain guests. Though Pete's soaking up the room like it might as well be a museum, so I suppose he doesn't mind the clutter.
“You’re the one that set me up on the couch, Tony. You literally gave me pillows and a blanket.”
“Couldn’t sleep,” he says. “I didn’t want to disturb you again.”
He stomps the snow off his shoes. “Thanks, doll, I put gel in my hair for you. You better make it worth it.”

"We don't need to. I mean it. If you're not comfortable, you know I would never force you." "I know. That's why I came to the decision on my own, while I was being crushed by a concrete pillar. You know, delusions of a dead man, or whatever. I love you, and I want to tell them. If you do, too."
I'm daydreaming about assembling the prototype for my new prosthetic when the nurse returns once more, this time with more to offer than aftercare instructions: she comes bearing a wheelchair and a warm smile. "Are you ready, Mr. Stark?"
He complies, perching on the barstool with the poise of a model and tucking his hands into his armpits. “What are you making? It smells good.”
“Can I see you again?” he whispers.
God, I really did see a future in Steve, didn't I?
"I don't know, a hallway?"
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
I pull them out by the laces, which are tied together, and my stomach twists in a similar pattern.
...that assembly station exploded. Just straight up, kaboom!! And here I am. Fuck, this really hurts. My left ear is ringing. Is that normal?"
Somehow it's still surreal. Especially when it finally comes time to start moving things into the tower; Happy's been managing it in Tony's absence, so it looks largely the same as it did last time I saw it, though I can't say I ever felt more welcome than I do now as I'm helping my boyfriend rearrange his furniture.
Walking through empty hotel hallways in the middle of the night is one of life’s most surreal experiences. The carpet is a dizzying pattern of colorful swirls and shapes contrasted horribly by a gray backdrop, and all the doors look exactly the same. Despite the relatively simple layout, I feel as though I could get lost in here for days and come out a changed man.
Maria Hill puts us up in a hotel— split into two suites— and gives us orders to rest, get up to speed with Sam, and be ready to attack tomorrow morning. Sam is eager to debrief us when we get there, gathering us in a private meeting room and rolling out a hand-drawn floorplan onto the table.
"First off, is that an intentional joke? I only have the one shoe and it wouldn't fit any of you assholes, so don't even think about it. And besides, I already told you, it's not about the mission. I just have some... personal battles that I think I'd like to win, first." I turn back to Steve.
Steve's phone buzzes, and he glances at the notification. "Sam says he wants to get everyone together tonight for drinks before we leave."
“On foot, no. That’s where Scott comes in.” He turns to face Lang, who’s watching videos on his phone on low volume. “Scott.”
I sit on a stiff leather couch and eye the stack of magazines in front of me, none of which would pacify my nerves, and await the nurse's return. My leg is bouncing, fueled by numerous cups of shitty coffee. To say it's been a long day would be the understatement of the century. The ticking clock in the corner is eager to remind me just how many hours I've been waiting to see him again, and my urge to refill my cup with
“So, you’re telling me you flew me all the way out here just to be a battering ram?” Tony doesn’t even trying to hide the bitterness—and the hint of terror— in his voice.
“You’re the only person I know who would put blasters in their prosthetic,” he says.
“Alright, alright.” He exhales slowly and pinches the bridge of his nose, taking a moment to collect himself before he meets my eyes again. “I wanted to check on you.”
S: My boyfriend won't give me back the feather duster.
I exhale a laugh into my burger, sending a pickle to its sandy doom. "I'm sorry, I cannot imagine you riding a horse."
"I love you," he blurts out.
"He's all yours," Nurse Debby chirps.
Steve grabs my hand and lowers it to the counter, forcing me to set down my mug. “Okay, so how drunk do you have to be to kiss me?”
“I was just wondering. It’s been a while since you’ve been out on the field.”
I join him in silence. Sitting cross-legged, waiting for him to acknowledge my presence. It doesn’t seem smart to open my mouth at the moment, what with all the doubts, frustrations, and insecurities that have had far too much time to fester in my brain.
“I know, right? I really should be recording this.”
Rhodey's the first to reinstate some semblance of order, gesturing for everyone to pipe down. He takes a moment to study my face. "You're serious," he says. It almost sounds like a question, but
“Tony.”
I know something changed since I checked in on him that night; Something shifted. I can’t help but over-think it.
“I didn’t stay overnight so I could make coffee, Tony. You know that.”
“He’s been alone for a long time,” Nat offers.
"Yeah?"
“Is that not what this is?”
“That was amazing,” I say breathlessly. “Parachuting out of a plane is one thing, but…whew. I can see why you like that suit so much.”
I’ve been thinking a lot about being upfront with Steve, and it sounds great in theory, but I’ve also been thinking about just how drunk I’d need to be to make that happen, and how big of a chore that would be, and how it’s actually not so great in theory after all.
“Got big plans tonight, Tony?”
S: I'm sorry, that was...dark.
"Easy, Cap. Twelve o'clock, coming in hot."
It was late when I recorded it, not quite as late as it is right now but late enough that Steve's voice was husky. Sultry. Slow and deliberate. Late enough that thoughts poured out more easily, coaxed with a few cups of wine.
by the Goo Goo Dolls? Please?”
I can hear muffled commotion from either side of the building, intermingling with the blaring alarm, which doesn't help to orient me. I know Sam's in the east wing, but my head is too scrambled for that to mean anything. All I have now is left or right. I choose right. I suppose it's up to fate if I've chosen correctly.
“It’s late. Forget it. You need your beauty rest, go back to sleep, it’s nothing. Goodnight.”
Tony’s sitting in the snow, lacing up his own skates. “Try ‘em on, I wanna make sure they fit.”
“I’m ready when you are, sir,” F.R.I.D.A.Y chirps.
“Jesus, man, be careful,” he says. “I don’t feel like losing an eye tonight.”
The connection cuts off.
The stairs to his workshop creak underfoot. A sliver of light shines from beneath the door, so I suppose my suspicions are confirmed. I knock. “Tony?” I say, a bit louder this time. “Are you in here?”
I step around a loose pile of hardcover books and gesture for Peter to take a seat at the bar.
I pivot upwards even more, propelling myself towards the stars that aren’t so unknown anymore. There are times that I want to keep going until I hit the moon, and then farther still. Back into the cosmos that care less about you than time itself does. Maybe I left a piece of myself out there, and it’s just a matter of finding it. Bringing it back. At the very least, I could get lost and not have to care.
“…What about the extra bag of peanuts?”
“Panic. Hysteria. A healthy dose of depression,” I say. Steve doesn’t seem amused by this. As he shouldn’t, I suppose; it’s only partially untrue. “Look, I needed to get away for a bit. Figure shit out. Is that good enough for you?”
We settle into an empty booth and accept our menus.
I smile into his mouth and plant another kiss, warm and oh-so-needed, before pulling away just enough to get a good look at his face. He's got good color again. His face is flushed, his eyes are bright. I lay a hand across his forehead. Temperate.
“I saw it light up when you went up against Thanos. When you laid everything down—your body, your life— for the good of everyone else. I realized that I was wrong. You are crazy, Tony…”
I slipped into bed next to Steve about an hour ago, mostly to quell his worries. He's snoring softly, even though he claims he doesn't ever snore, and his limp forearm is flopped around the small of my waist. It's almost cute enough to convince me to stay in bed, just to watch the pillowcase flutter under his breath until I can't help but fall into my own fitful sleep.
"Different priorities."
He gives me a look.
The nurse comes to fetch us after what feels like eons. "He's ready for you. Are you all coming back?"
I don't.
When the smoke clears, I see him.
Steve finishes setting the panel back in place and passes my hand back to me. “I’m hurt,” he says.
"Sorry, I know it's early..."
I brandish my shield and jam it between the pillar and rubble that has avalanched around his leg, and push down with all my might. The pillar raises an inch before falling back down, hard. Tony yelps.
“Tony
“No.”
"Get him out of here," I say. "I'm going in."
He nods.
“What kind of dreams?”
───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────
Nat reaches over to clasp my hand. "We'll miss you, Tony."
"Yeah, cheers to that, bud." I tip my glass towards him.
Steve: [out of breath] I saw a really cute dog on my run.
“Really.”
“And tell me, with 100% honesty, that—mmph!”
“They’re getting worse,” he says. It’s quiet, but I catch it. “I don’t think there’s anything anyone can do for me.”
“Oh, can’t complain. Come in, come in.”
"Seriously, though, I don't care if you keep that stuff."
"But—"
I don't stop to catch my breath until I hit the back wall and scramble to find the door handle. It's stuck, or latched— no time. I kick it down.
"I'm...Roof, I'm on the roof," I pant. I brace myself on my knees. "They have energy beams. Big guns, lasers. The kind that cuts through your suit like butter."
Tony, lying in the middle of a catwalk that bows ominously beneath him.
Steve's nose scrunches when he laughs. "A burger it is, then."
“I’m a light sleeper,” he grumbles. “So what are you doing?”
“So…what, you just want to collaborate on a charity project or something?”
"You don't have to give me your answer right away. Just tell me you'll think about it, okay?"
I inspect the drink, which is now half unidentified fruity liquor and half scotch, and set it back down. Tony makes his way back around the bar. He’s wobbling so much one might think there’s a tightrope spanning the five steps it should take to get there.  He sways to halt only a few inches before my face, close enough that I can make out each worry line, each dark eyelash, that drop of scotch that’s clinging to his beard. He clears his throat and takes a step back, breaking eye contact. I continue to stare evenly.
Tony makes a move to correct me, but seems to change his mind. He folds his menu and stacks it on top of mine and gives the waitress one of those tight-lipped smiles, the kind you only give when you’re being polite. He squints at me when she leaves. “Rogers, you’re lucky I was gonna order that anyway.”
Nat and Rhodey don’t look convinced, but they don’t say anything. Steve’s just staring at me with an unreadable expression.
After the events of Civil War, Wanda and Vision go off the grid, and find new hope in the form of a garden.
T: No...
Scott turns around in his seat and raises the half-empty glass of ginger ale. “Tony, do you want to finish this?”
“So what should we do?”
“Yeah…” he says, and it seems kind of sheepish. “I wanted to make sure you were okay. You were pretty shaken last night.”
Tony stands with the grace of a trained dancer and steps onto the ice, skating out a few feet before spinning around to face me. “What’s the hold-up, Cap?”
“I’m good.” He eyes my arm, or at least the place my arm should be. I’m only sporting the shoulder piece to my prosthetic. “Is…are you…”
I knock on his door at 6:30. Normally I’d be on time or early, but this is one party I don’t want to be the first guest to; the whole thing has got me on edge.
“A shame really, it’s a beautiful day. Y’know, I had a lot planned for today. Like,
“You danced?” said Bucky, incredulous.
“Okay,” Tony slurred against their kiss, arms gripping the material of the other man’s shirt. “Okay,” he repeated, pushing Steve back a few steps. Steve let himself be guided backward until he just broke the kiss, took Tony by the waist and led him to the elevator. Tony couldn’t keep his hands off of the other man now that he had permission and ran one of them up and down Rogers’ back. Once the button was pushed and it opened, Steve pulled Tony inside in a fashion that reminded him of their dance. Charmer.
“Good,” Tony said, sitting up and stretching. “Would giving me a blow job be too much for you right now? Wanna try it?”
He leaned down and pumped him a few times, trying to get him used to the idea. “You know why I’m down here right?”
Bucky nodded, pleased with himself. “Just try. That’s all I want.” Bucky gave Cap his most shit-eating smirk and then nodded. “Okay. Want to help me eat the rest of these?”
He went upstairs and made himself a massive and sugary protein shake, probably worse for him than better. Then, he went to his gym area and began to bench some weights since he needed to clear his head. If Peter wasn’t here, he probably would’ve let himself go to shit, just like the planet…but there was no way he could let his guard down. What if something worse than Thanos came? He’d be ready, he’d probably lose again, but maybe he could keep the kid alive. That was really all that mattered.
“So it all comes from your wrists?” He stood, always taken away by Tony’s (and now Peter’s) tech.
“What are you thanking me for? It’s yours, I’d like it out of my house.”
Peter, whose hair was messier than usual, was gesturing wildly to a glowing box with a shiny cloud of nano-particles swirling about. They were in the (actually very) secret garage underneath Tony’s cabin. It was three stories down, humongous, and had three hidden entrances; one in the house, one super long tunnel that went all the way to the other side of the woods, and one that rose up and opened in the middle of the lake near the cabin. It reminded him of an old SHIELD base, it was pretty neat.
Steve gave it some thought and then said, “Don’t know if I’m ready for that.”
There was something about the strong, resolute and deeply careful way that Steve was watching him that made his heart flop again. “So…second date?”
“Bye, Tony. See you.”
Very much going for it, Tony leaned forward, licking the head of Cap’s member and gripping the length in a fist—god the feel of it. As he slowly pumped him, he was fascinated by how perfect and pink the tip of his cock was when his foreskin was out of the way. He licked the tip with the flat of his tongue, grinning when Cap made a quiet gasp, his leg jerking. He licked and kissed his way down the bottom base of his thick length. There, he softly massaged the other man’s balls, watching as muscles in Steve’s leg’s tensed and flexed. Licking his way back up, he took the head into his mouth and started sucking, earning him a moan-like whine from Steve. Oh, he liked that a lot, huh? When he looked up, Steve was actually looking down and to the left, biting his lip. Carefully, he took as much of Cap’s length down as he could, and slowly pulled his head back. He repeated the gesture, eyes fluttering shut at how god damned good it was for him. Steve was always so freaking clean, and due to that, the scent down here was just him and warmth.
“Thank you, man. God, I appreciate it,” Rhodey breathed, relief flooding his voice.
“You guys and your freakin’ shawarma. I swear.” Sam grinned, having already downed a few beers too many.
The very image of Steve holding another man to the wall and kissing the crap out of him kept Tony company late at night. Even when they were fighting. He wished he could feel bad about it, but he really didn’t. That night had opened a flood gate of strange sexual tension between them that lasted all the way up until Cap broke his heart figuratively and literally with that damned shield.
“Yes it does,” Tony said, rubbing his back and stepping away. “Okay squirt, go eat junk food until you throw up or something.”
He turned to Steve who was watching them with the biggest genuine smile he’d seen on the man in a long time. Steve wasn’t exactly a “smiley” guy, especially these days, but he didn’t seem so miserable anymore. In fact, Steve was becoming pretty sweet again. He himself was becoming pretty sweet again. He and Steve together? He never could have dreamed they’d work so well as a couple. Steve wasn’t his boyfriend, he didn’t like that word, it didn’t suit Rogers at all. No, Steve was…his man. It felt right after all this time, like they should have been this way from the beginning.
“What? Sleep? Happy, don’t be crazy,” Peter chuckled, rolling up his sleeves and then sighing. He sipped a carbonated orange juice—his move favorite drink in the world at the moment—and scratched the stubble coming in on his chin. “I hate shaving…”
They stood in the entrance for a minute, and then Tony glanced at Steve. The other man had a distant look in his eyes, and then turned to Tony with a somewhat sad expression. “My whole life I’ve wanted to take someone dancing.”
“I’m sorry Tony I should’ve told you. I don’t like to talk about this sort of thing. I didn’t mean for you to see that.” Steve held his arms closer to himself, still not looking away from Tony’s face. “Thank you for checking on me.”
Steve flexed the fingers on one hand, squeezing them into a fist. A part of him was suddenly thankful he finally had a reason to talk to Tony—a real reason. Not just an, “I missed you Tony.” He did miss him. He missed him so much his heart hurt at the thought of seeing him. No matter what had happened between them, Cap was always the one ready to move on and just, be friends again. It was Tony who held onto the resentment like a bad cough.
“It’s 4 o’clock, Sir. Wednesday.”
Cap’s frantic thrusts grew more shallow and he suddenly grabbed Tony by the waist and pulled himself so far inside of him Tony thought he might actually die it was so good. Steve’s breath hitched and he growled Tony’s name long and slow as he came, hips grinding hard into Tony’s ass even though his dick couldn’t possibly get any deeper. Tony gasped at the feeling of all that warmth spilling inside him and he let his forehead thump on the bar, nearly whimpering from the feeling of being so full and hot. “Oh, mmh,” he panted, continuing to move his ass against Steve’s until the blond abruptly pulled out, leaving him a complete whine bag. “The fuck, babe,” he complained, turning to look at him. Just as he did, Steve grabbed him and kissed him hard, chest heaving. He grabbed Tony and turned him, picking his body up and sitting his ass on the bar top. When he closed the distance, he reached down between them and shoved himself right back inside since he wasn’t fully soft yet, half-lidded gaze never leaving Stark’s. Tony shut his eyes, feeling them want to roll from the sheer naughty and delicious as hell sensation coursed through him. Steve began pistoning into him again, the softening of his member barely mattering due to his sheer girth. Steve reached between them and rapidly began to pump Tony’s throbbing and leaking member, fist tight. He kept the brunet in place by holding onto one of his sides, and with that, it didn’t take much longer before Tony was crying out Steve’s name and spilling his come all over the Captain America uniform.
“Yeah, why don’t you?”
“Well…” he didn’t have much to say, that was the sweetest thing anyone had said to him in almost five years. “I’m not gay, bro…”
“Tony sent me to a tailor and made me get fitted for this. It was kind of fun.”
Tony growled softly, feeling like he’d been hit by not just one, but two trucks.
again.” Peter had given Quill a whole plethora of movies on a big drive the last time they’d visited, something he’d been taking advantage of everyday since.
“Oh my god you are such a fossil. Sounds perfect. A week from now?”
Steve laughed and stepped back, pulling out but not pulling their chests apart, “Really?”
Cap came over and sighed, shaking his head looking irritated and worried for the safety of every last person in this city—of course—as if Stark wasn’t capable of saving everyone on his own. “Tony…”
Bucky smirked, he honestly didn’t bare any ill-will against Iron Man. That whole situation in the past was bad and they’d all made bad choices. After they’d lost against Thanos, he’d explained himself to the other man via a voice message (which he was pretty sure the other man had watched since they were on somewhat okay terms) because they were all that were left and he wanted to make an effort to try and be a normal person, for Steve and everyone. He wanted a taste of a normal life, and he started by apologizing in a rational way to a man he’d hurt in a way no other human should hurt another. He wanted to make it clear that he wasn’t the Winter Soldier. He was James Barnes, friend of Steve Roger and Howard Stark. Now that so much had happened, he actually found himself liking Tony. He was a strong willed, stubborn and petty man that reminded him so much of Howard, he was hard to really hate. He sincerely hoped Steve and Tony had a good time, however brief or casual.
“You like that, big guy?” Tony whispered, using his grip on Cap’s ass as leverage to roll their hard ons together.
The ironic part was now he didn’t have anything left to say to anyone that wasn’t TV show or Natasha related. He didn’t like to talk about anything else. He became a happier person once he stopped talking about the war and the past. The future was a pretty fun place once he let himself enjoy it. Now, he just had to convince Steve to do the same.
“What the fu—!”
Peter looked thoughtful and then just patted his own sides. “I don’t know…are you happy?”
“Why?”
The kid’s eyes were wide and he just rubbed his face, not even knowing how to process the information. “It’s done…I mean…it’s there…it’s real…”
To him, even when Steve became Captain America, he still saw his Stevie, the tiny little 95 pound spitfire. The body he was in was just his personality personified, and Bucky had always thought the tiny scrapper was larger than life. He had deserved so much better than being a slave for the government, but it was what he’d wanted. Bucky was happy his tiny blond kickass from Brooklyn had realized his full potential and was stopping the kind of bullies no one else could.
“It’s my new suit. You like it? It’s made of about seventeen different things not found on Earth. It’s the same armor I’ve been working on for over four years. It’s actually almost complete.”
“Okay, I want to watch that documentary about the history of Hasbro and forget about the last three hours of my life...”
Steve grinned a dazzling (and shit eating) smile, obviously knowing exactly what he was doing. “Well?” He poured syrup on his own breakfast, still looking sly.
There were two shirtless men on the screen, their junk hanging out in front of Jesus and everybody. He’d been assigned to find naked human figures to draw for his art elective since their class had been canceled the week prior. Oh, he was dying, his face was pure red and his Spider-senses were going crazy from emotion. He’d gotten so used to Tony’s presence he barely set off his senses until he was too close.
“Uhh…” Tony blinked and then shook his head, grabbing a shower and the saddest excuse for a cup of coffee he’d had in months. “I’m gonna go save him. Jesus, I’m sure every gay man this side of the East Coast is holding him hostage…If Sam starts choking or some crap in his sleep you know what to do.”
“Better than I thought he would. He told me he wanted to save the neighborhood, as in the neighborhood we call ‘Earth.’ Hey, want some more chili?”
Steve looked up at him through his eyelashes, crossing his arms and then leaning back in his chair, “Okay.”
“Mornin’ Cap,” Tony said, walking past him and eating some yakitori too. He wished everyone wasn’t here. He wanted to talk to him alone. But he sure did look cute this morning, what with his mussed blond hair and soft cotton blue shirt.
“I’ve taught you too well. Stop using my own tricks against me…A piece of my, aahnnn…fucker…” Tony began and then faltered again when Steve’s thumb rubbed his oversensitive cock head. “My mind, I’ll give you a piece of my mind…”
“Hey, Capsicle. What’s new?”
The message was from Nat. As she got typing away, a loud thud was heard near the loading bay, where the beds were. “Damn it, ugh…” a deep voice groaned. Oh, hell he was awake. That’s just what she needed.
“I do,” Cap nearly whispered, nipping Tony’s bottom lip and then capturing his mouth again in a salacious French kiss.
“I’m okay, Dad,” Peter said shakily, overcome with relief. Even though this wasn’t bad guys shooting at him or Thanos throwing moons at them, it was still terrifying. Rhodey put the plane into autopilot and closed the cargo door, giving the captain and Happy first-aid.
“Ah, Tony…love the way we feel,” Cap sighed, pulling his hips out slowly and then pushing back in. Every time Cap’s massive member disappeared into him, Stark’s back tensed and he grunt-moaned into his own arm. His breath was leaving moisture all over the counter, and he was already sweating.
Steve smiled at him in a way the reached his eyes, hands coming to grab Iron Man by the waist. “Always have,” he practically purred, his voice taking on that seductive deep lilt that went straight to Stark’s dick. The big blond soldier was always so god damn delightful when he was horny.
Tony shrugged, closing the door and then getting back in bed. Once he was all covered up he threw his arms above his head, under his pillow, and then laid his head down. He looked up at Steve with an actual smile. “He’s my kid.”
“Hello Tony,” Nebula greeted, holding two boxes stacked on top of each other. She put them down next to Quill’s. Thor was following her, wearing sunglasses and sandals.
“But then I realized we hadn’t seen each other in over two years. That’s too long, Tony. I miss you. I really do. If something had happened to you, I wouldn’ta been the first one to know it and that just feels wrong.” He’d vaguely thought about what he’d wanted to say on the drive down…even if he hadn’t expected to spill it in the middle of a living room. “I wish I could say sorry for the whole Accords incident, but I can’t. I stand by the decisions I made then, but I am sorry for what it’s done to us and Rhodey. I don’t regret a lot of things, but one thing I do regret was not doing this earlier.” Cap’s expression was earnest and his fists were clenched.
“I just really want us to talk again. I’ve been worried about you. I know you’ve got a life here and I’m real happy for you. I don’t want to change any of that. I’m not asking you to come back to the base, I just wish there was something I could do to—”
“Steve, oh,” he breathed, pulling their lips away for only a second, just to have them covered again with Cap’s, who’d chased his mouth back into a kiss.
“Doubtful,” she said up at him, green eyes playful against her pale cheeks. He loved her so much it hurt him physically to pull away from her most of the time. He did it anyway.
“So...will you think about it?” Steve asked, looked over at Tony in the driver’s seat. Steve’s eyes softened as he looked at him. He looked so much better than the last few times he’d seen him. His face was fuller, his suit jacket was more filled out, and his skin looked clear. Cap could also smell the familiar lingering scent of expensive cologne and hair product that was always unique to the other man. It made his chest feel heavy.
Steve thought for a second and shook his head. “No.”
“No, why?”
As he grabbed his board and headed for the crowded beach, he heard a startled voice spewing voracious, angry, expletives.
“Good job,” Thor said, mostly sober. He was wearing sunglasses, a beanie, and a ridiculously baggy hoodie. Nebula squeezed Peter’s shoulder, congratulating him too. She was wearing a wig and a special kind of mask SHIELD had developed which gave her someone else’s face, a small courtesy from Tony. It would have been distracting if a blue alien was walking around after all.
Steve immediately jerked his head away from his current partner and stepped away from the guy in a second’s beat.
“Those are horrible for you.”
“Having fun?” He gunned it down the interstate. It was about 80 miles from the Avengers HQ base to Manhattan, but when one drove as fast as Tony…80 miles seemed more like 30.
He stuck himself to the side of the plane as it tumbled on its way down. There were remnants of both wings left, and they were causing the plane to spin in ways that made Happy’s limbs get thrown around painfully. He crawled inside the plane, webbed the captain’s door and then walked inside of it, using one arm to break the seatbelt and yank the unconscious captain out by his shirt. He wrapped both of his arms around the men and ran, jumping out of the falling cabin and turning on his leg and back thrusters full-blast.
Tony blinked. Well that was nice of him.
“Hell nah, been dealing with jammers my whole life. Suckers have shitty tech but always great booze. Hey Tony, where’s the kid?”
“It’s 4 o’clock, Sir.”
She looked at the counter and then shrugged, “I don’t know who brought those. Friday, where’d these come from?”
The ship came in slowly, and Quill was keeping it well and clear of any trees. It was loud and the engines rustled the leaves and grass in visible waves. Tony squinted against the wind, leaning on a doorframe and scratching his facial hair. When the ship landed, Quill came walking out holding a big box in a strong grip. He may have put on a shit ton of weight, but like Thor he still had pretty nice arms.
Thor sat heavily, “Cool.”
“—next time on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives—”
“Yeah I do. It’s because I want to butter you up.”
right?”
“Hey.”
Tony pointed at the menu. “Get whatever you want. I think you’ll really like the bourguignon. And I’m ordering us a bottle of wine, do you like white or red?”
There was a heavy investigation into what had caused the plane explosion. After recovering the wreckage, it was found that there were three more bombs built into the very framework of the plane that hadn’t gone off or it would have killed them all. Tony clenched his fists, he was not thinking about this right now.
Peter ran downstairs, wanting to excitedly tell Quill all about his new compound but nearly fell over a chair when he saw what the hell Thor and Quill were doing.
“Me too.”
“Oh, oh, Tony, god that feels so good,” he gasped, barely suppressing a buck of his hips. Tony smirked, as he moaned around Steve’s head, loving the way Steve was holding onto his hair. He wasn’t gripping it hard it all, but it still sent shivers to his groin. Tony could taste and feel the wet-slickness of Steve’s precum, and he was almost mad at himself for not doing this sooner. One of his hands was gripping Rogers’ hip tightly and his other was frantically pumping his length. He wanted Steve to come so bad, he wanted it on his face or in his mouth, he didn’t fucking care at that point.
“Think I should get an eye patch?”
“Of course we’re alright Steve. Why wouldn’t we be?”
When Quill was nice and clean and in fresh clothes, he found a bowl of soup waiting for him on the table. Star-Lord snatched up a soup bowl and tilted it back, chugging it down because tabs made one ravenously hungry.
“Oh,” Quill said, putting his hands on his hips and blinking once. “Well, that’s good. Your friend I’m guessing?”
“I mean, I’m happy for you, I really am! And like, you don’t have to tell me anything, but…this is just very shocking, I’m not gonna lie.”
Cap nodded, swallowing audibly and shifting his legs. How could someone look so embarrassed and enthusiastic at the same time? It was damned near precious how he could go from so domineering to whatever this was. It was that face that made him remember he was a freshly de-flowered virgin.
Steve tentatively rubbed his hand up and down Tony’s stomach, turning his face so his lips were against Tony’s ear. He didn’t say anything, just kissed his ear in a way that made Tony quietly gasp and inhale from tingly pleasure. His nose was buried in his hair, and his lips were kissing the shell of his ear. The warmth of his breath gave him chills.
“Well, I’m beat, I think I’m gonna go to bed,” Peter said, eating the last cherry off his plate and standing up. He had been wearing the shirt Star-Lord got him for about three days in a row. It rode up a little when he stretched his arms above his head, going around and hugging everyone’s face who was sitting at the table.. “G’night,” he called. The Avengers watched him go after giving him a chorus of good-nights.
Steve just stayed there inside him as he came, moving their hips together and kissing his hair until Stark stopped panting so hard. When he let his eyes open again he grinned up at him, swallowing thickly, “You’re just the best, Stevie…”
His hair was soft, his body was warm, and Jesus this wasn’t enough for him. Steve must have thought the same thing, because he stood and gently guided Tony to stand up with him, wrapping his arms around him and pulling their bodies close. Tony could feel Cap’s pecks flexing as his arms moved to rub Tony’s back and waist. Steve had tasted like syrup and blueberries, but their tastes slowly melded until all he could feel was warmth and wetness between their mouths. Every movement of Steve’s jaw and every stroke of their tongues had Tony’s body coming alive, and he was pretty sure there were goosebumps on his arms. This was so much. It wasn’t like being kissed by anyone he’d had in not-so-recent memory, it was domineering, sweet, and kind of lusty. Tony didn’t let himself get dominated very often, but with Steve like this? He didn’t even want a choice.
“Goodnight, Steve,” Tony said, turning and walking faster than he’d meant too. Once he got into the elevator he pushed the “B” button just about a hundred times.
“What?! Nevermind, where are we?!”
“God damn it! My next billion was practically in that bag…”
“I’d like that,” Steve said through a smile, kissing his lips and running a hand down Stark’s thigh.
“You know how it works huh?” Tony practically purred, holding up a condom. “Want me to put it on you?”
“Hey, there,” he said, eyes crinkling at her. She had heard him coming, but turned around fast anyway.
“So! Tony wanted a suit that could handle space. For like, a long time right? And I was like, ‘Why not space stuff?!’ And so he’s making his version, and I’m making mine. You should see what his can do, it’s incredible…but I’m pretty proud of mine so far. Y’know how in submarines the soldiers have soda lime all over the place to absorb carbon dioxide? Well, it can’t convert it to oxygen, but I was thinking—what if there was a space chemical that could do that, and run off of your body heat? Turns out—there’s not! There’s stuff that’s
“He must be a pretty cool fuckin’ guy. I want to be like him. Sounds dangerous,” Tony chuckled telling the waitress his order and getting them a nice bottle of white wine. He had a feeling Steve liked it sweet. Steve chose a chicken-based dish. Tony ordered appetizers and a second course for them after ordering a pasta. This was so strange. Having a fancy dinner with Steve Rogers. What would the kid think? His pulse was wild right now.
Cap nodded, “Me too.”
Cap took his bowl looking thankful, but then he quirked a brow. “A sled?”
This was so simple, but a lot of things weren’t. He still couldn’t believe he was getting emails from some intergalactic starguy and his angry blue robot lady, but that’s just how it was these days. He couldn’t believe a lot of things.
“I swear to god if you give me the whole, ‘Back in my day we walked through eight feet of snow,’ speech…”
Even though they were smelly, annoying, loud, and obnoxious, she knew that without those two idiots eating space chips in the cockpit, she’d be lost in the galaxy, and unendingly lonely. Somewhere she took joy in taking care of them and joining the space crusades. She liked being a good guy. She liked this life. She just missed those who used to be in it. They all did. Whenever she’d sleep at night, she’d go to happier times, replaying recent memories of Gamora over and over.
“Cool. Alright, time to get to work. Friday, put on Van Halen. I’m feeling Panama today. 15% volume, I’ve got a headache.” Tony rolled out of bed, downing a few pills to help his head and taking the world’s hottest shower. When finished, he immediately went down the stairs to work on his newest project, the Mark 87. Ever since the kid convinced him to use intergalactic materials—he almost didn’t, it was a pride thing—he’d scrapped the entire Mark 86. The suit Thanos had whipped his ass in (i.e. Mark 85), well he’d shot the thing into an incinerator. He didn’t want any part of it. It was a reminder of his failure. Whenever he even thought about it, he had flashbacks of Thanos, holding his head, certain the titan was going to crush his skull like an egg. Maybe he should have. It would have been easier than losing Pepper.
Bucky huffed, “What happened?”
The flight home was unusually quiet.
“Usually. You just seem happy to be seeing him.” Bucky put a little extra weight on the words, wondering if it would egg Steve on to spill any sort of beans.
He went down to the conference room and stopped when he saw Quill. She watched as Thor slapped a hand on Thor’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze.
The other man breathed, “What is it, Tony,” between them, fingers lightly squeezing at a low part on Tony’s back. His voice was calm and considerate but filled with something husky.
She watched the (now pretty chubby) Star-Lord go down the steps of the ship. She heard them talking, and soon the two men came in. Thor sat down heavily at the table and sunk down low in his chair, grabbing one of those really horrible blue beers she couldn’t stand. He raised the bottle to her in greeting, smiling with his mouth shut and boinking his eyebrows once. “M’lady.”
“She says Tony Stark is wanting more of that metal from Orensha again. Sounds good. Let’s do it.”
“Oh!” Thor slapped the table with his meaty gloved hand. “Like forever? Is he graduating?”
“We will be there,” Nebula confirmed. Nebula was actually good at disguises unlike a certain hairy god.
“Grow a beard and shave it like mine and find out, Wonder Boy.”
“What’s up dude?” Quill asked, slapping his shoulder.
“Good morning, Tony,” Steve greeted warmly.
“Fantastic.”
Steve looked up at him, “I know. Thank you,” Steve stood and patted Bucky’s shoulder as he passed, hanging up the garment bag in his closet.
“Depends. What’s going on?” Tony’s expression was unreadable.
Steve nodded, coming in as Peter moved aside. Just as his left foot crossed the threshold, his eyes locked with Tony’s.
“Hey! That’s the captain’s call.” Quill held up a hand, putting the other on his hip like he actually held some semblance of authority in his socks and sleeping shirt.
“Heard there was breakfast,” he said, quickly going and eating some. Bucky and Steve both had absolutely massive appetites due to the serum. They could eat forever. It didn’t take long for them to absolutely decimate the skewers of chicken, the noodles, dumplings, and cups of soup. It was the best breakfast any of them had had in a while. They struggled to take care of themselves, especially when they were busy.
“We’ll be there! Just tell us when. I’ll show him a true Asgardian night out. Proud of him,” Thor said emotionally. For fuck’s sake.
“Oh, I’m good. We’re good. How are you? What’s wrong? Is something bad happening?”
“Over the North Atlantic Ocean. We are over 1,000 miles from any major city.”
“I do too,” Stark said, shoving his hips back when Cap went forward. The slower pace only lasted for about two minutes before Cap began to hasten his thrusts, slapping their bodies together with vigor, and using his strong grip to keep Tony in place.
Tony changed into his pajamas—a black tank and sleeping pants—before sitting beside Steve and sighing. He hadn’t been sleeping well because of all this. He knew Peter was going to have to go back to school, and he trusted him, but just knowing someone out there was actively trying to hurt him gave him night terrors just as bad as the one’s he still sometimes had about the wormhole…about Thanos.
“Thank you, Tony.”
This chapter is dedicated to my friend Silver_Centurion.
After some goodbyes, the Guardians headed back to space. Nebula was blessed with the ability to shut off her audio processors, because the first time she heard Quill and Thor experimenting with their newfound sexualities, she almost lost her mind. She wasn’t against it, and they were three people trapped on a ship together by trade alone, but it just sort of reminded her how isolated she was. She was one of the very few creatures in the galaxy that had no interest in sex or reproductive relationships, but she understood them. She could tell this was something the idiots needed, and she didn’t mind letting them have their fun. Thank god their puppy-love phase was over, she didn’t know if she could ever handle that again. Sometimes, she really missed talking to someone else that understood her though. She missed Gamora. Sometimes, she even missed the good parts of her father.
Who the hell was that?
“That was amazing,” he breathed, fingers massaging the back of Tony’s neck.
He heard Nat shout, one of the only noises in the world that ever put him into a mindset he absolutely hated. His thoughts were suppressed, and he wasn’t holding back his actions anymore. If Nat was hurt, he needed to stop messing around. He couldn’t see her. His body knew what it could do and it did it, hurling men into walls, kicking them unconscious, firing at them quickly, and generally being a beast. He heard Nat speaking to him but couldn’t hear what she was saying over the machine gun fire and shouting.
Thor shrugged, “Neither am I.”
The Kukat alien race is one I made up.
Blinking once, Steve smirked and held up a hand in a calming gesture. “Good. I’m fine. And no, Peter, everything’s alright. Where’s Tony?”
Steve opened his door and walked in, laying the garment bag on the bed and throwing himself into his favorite chair. “I have no idea.” The rooms were more like mini-apartments for each Avenger. It was always harrowing that they were so quiet these days.
Tony gives me one of his coats—a puffy one, with a fake fur lining—and insists that I put on my pants and shoes. He also hands me a chest harness. “This might be a stupid, awful, garbage idea, but I’m not about to let you die on me. Literally or otherwise. Here, clip that…yeah, right here…okay. Good.”
───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────
“Right now? Yes, it would. Steve, I have enough to worry about here. I don’t need to add extra anxiety to my plate just for the sake of telling the Avengers that we slept together,” I say, only realizing the sharpness of my words after they fall from my mouth.
He claps politely.
"I've
“Don’t rub it in. I just never learned, alright?”
His eyes are glossy, shining under the fluorescent lights. "After all this time...I actually have a future again. I have a future...with you. And I was
He’s staring at me with those obnoxiously blue eyes. He opens his mouth, then shuts it, runs his fingers through his hair, and starts pacing. I watch him stalk back and forth between my stairwell and the island and take the opportunity to drain half of my cup. He stops in front of me again, leaning heavily against the counter like his legs are ready to give out underneath him.
“How should I know? You’re the one that wanted to talk so badly that you stowed away in my house.”
He hesitates. We lock eyes, the prosthetic still suspended between us, his fingers brushing against mine. He tightens his grip for a brief moment before releasing both of my hands and tucking his own into his jacket pockets. He offers a slight nod that I can’t even begin to decode.
“I don’t know, probably. Do you have a better idea?”
The table falls into the second stunned silence of the night.
It’s been a few days since I’ve heard from him. I’m trying to not freak out, to practice patience…which translates to taking out my worries on a punching bag rather than pacing a hole in my apartment floor. My fist isn’t hitting hard enough today, though. Distractions have a way of seeping through.
I meet his eyes, and he confirms my dreaded suspicions: no caller ID.
"I take it back. I've suddenly decided we're not dating anymore."
S: No. No....I'm glad you did.
, I swear to god, I will smack you.”
I mean, honestly, what am I doing? I was fine alone. You know, relatively. Sort of. Okay, not at all, but that’s neither here nor there. Am I even ready to get into another relationship? Especially with someone like Steve, with the kind of history we have? What happens if we fall in love, get married, then one day get divorced because of a spat over who lost the remote? We’re just two prideful assholes that think that their way is the right way, no exceptions.
I rip off my shirt and tie it tightly around the wound. He groans, but doesn't protest. I drape one of his arms around my shoulder and scoop him up, pressing him tightly against my body. I run fast as I dare. We're no longer afforded the luxury of tiptoeing, and the catwalk makes its protests known, finally collapsing behind us as I clear the threshold. The pillar hits the ground with a resounding crash. I don't stop to look back.
"Something's wrong here, Tony. There's got to be a reason for them to retreat like that. Did you see anything on your way over?"
“Steve, I’m gonna need you to shut up now.”
be available, for his sake,” Fury’s unamused voice booms into my ear.
He nods his approval. “Nice choice.”
“What? What were you expecting?”
The log comes to a halt, frozen on a wavelength I can reach out and run my fingers through. Steve's words are still ringing in my ears, heavy with raw emotions I can barely begin to unravel. Even in the silence, it feels like he's in the room with me.
Tony's POV
Sam meets my eyes, and the moment of recognition is mutual. "Maybe we're not stalling them... they were stalling us. God fucking damn it. Steve, update, now."
"Right...okay." He complies, and allows me to wrap his good arm around my shoulders. I support him at the waist.
“Okay.”
It's some ungodly hour in the morning when our plane finally touches down on familiar, snow-frosted territory. Steve chauffeurs me back to my place, with the very unconvincing intention of dropping me off, getting me settled, and taking his car the rest of the way to his apartment. I stand in the doorway and wait for him to process the indisputable fact that he's not leaving my house tonight.
"I hate you."
“Ah, shit, sorry. But I mean, who’s ever really ready to lose anything, know what I’m saying?” Tony laughs while waving his prosthetic hand. Rhodey and Natasha share a conspiratorial look.
, dumbass," he says.
“You almost died, Tony. It’s understandable to be shaken up.”
Silence. I let it simmer for a moment before bursting out laughing. “Sorry, sorry…she’s only activated by my voice. Hold on. F.R.I.D.A.Y? Play
It's the face I see when I close my eyes, it's the singular person overriding every thought, taking up residence in my heart.
T: Then lock the door next time, dork.
“Thanks for the sentimental pasta.”
“What, right now? Fine. Why?”
“It wasn’t a joke.”
“This is stupid. It feels so unnatural.”
“Mhm,” is all I manage to say. My eyelids are getting too heavy to keep open.
My helmet snaps closed over my face, I tilt forward, and blast out of the garage. Fast and low to the ground at first, and then up, up, up, into the clear night sky.
Maybe it's creepy. I like to think of it as an auditory diary, a way to categorize and compartmentalize my life. A way to feel a person's presence, to analyze their speech patterns, to remember them when I can't be there. Creepy or not, it comes in handy on nights like this, when my brain is on a treadmill and my boyfriend's on REM.
“Going on? There’s nothing going on,” Tony says, spitting out the words so fast he trips over most of them.
"Damn, it always comes back to that, huh?"
I scoot to my left, allowing Steve to take my place. He picks up my hand gingerly and turns it to examine the base.  I lean over his shoulder. “You know, we’re technically holding hands right now.”
A smirk, now, pulling up the corner of his mouth. “You did,” he says.
I comply, wiping my feet on the welcome mat that definitely wasn’t there last week. It looks like something a wine mom would buy— if only for the fact that it says “wine mom” on it.
“I just expected it to be…fancy,” Steve says. “You know, high-tec.”
───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────
He sighs, long and dramatic and too close to the microphone. It crackles in my ear. “Because we’re going skating tonight, obviously. Come on, doll, keep up.”
“Ach, I know, I know…I just…I mean…okay. After everything we’ve been through, you just show up out of the blue, checking in on me, a sad little widower living in the middle of nowhere…and now you’re suddenly interested in me? Doesn’t that sound a bit like a charity case?”
Rhodes doesn't answer. He doesn't have to— we both know that he shares my feelings. I see it in the way that he shifts from foot to foot, staring down at the facility with unmatched focus.
“The last fight…we won, but it’s haunting me.”
"I'm in. Shutting down security."
“Yeah, yeah, I’m just full of surprises these days.”
“Tony, I don’t know how to skate.”
“Best food in the entire city, guaranteed,” I continue.
"Hey, I already suggested McDonalds. You can take the helm from there, darling."
"Are you really not gonna be Iron Man anymore?" he blurts, immediately shrinking back from the bluntness of his own words. His face flushes. "Sorry, Mr. Stark. I just...I find it hard to believe."
I scramble to regain control, grasping at branches that snap in my hands, barely managing to swing my legs underneath me before hitting the forest floor. The thrusters counteract my inertia, awarding me a short moment to assess the damage. There's a strip of exposed skin on my shoulder, little more than a surface wound, but nothing like a scratch—this was a burn. The nanites re-form around the strip of tender flesh.
Goddammit. He comes over for fifteen minutes, and suddenly he’s introduced loneliness into the equation.
“Hey, I didn’t give you permission to leave your watch tower.”
“Do you like it here?”
“I’m gonna punch you.”
“But you’re crazy
The whole building is shaking, now. Crumbling. Spitting out large chunks of sheetrock and letting loose light fixtures, which crash to the ground below. If I get out of this alive, I'm telling Steve—
He helps haul me to to my feet, and I thread my arm through the crook of his elbow for extra support. The ice looks bumpy. Intimidating. Uninviting at best.
He doesn’t reply.
She wheels me into the waiting area, at which point Steve pops up from the couch and melts my heart with one of his...heart melting...smiles. I dunno, my brain too sludgy from my extended bed-riddance to think of anything more poetic. He's poetry in motion, anyway, so it's hard to improve on that.
Vision's eyes have been brighter lately, and Wanda would give anything to nourish the spark. She sits next to him in the garden, listens to his gentle lectures, and watches as he tends to each individual plant as if not one were more important. His spark is like a roaring fire to her. It warms her the closer she gets.
"What if I was your knight in shining armor?"
I didn't know his eyes could get any wider than they already were. I was wrong. "Mr Stark—"
I’ve barely fallen asleep when I have to wake up again. It’s still dark out, with only a sliver of light peering over the horizon. Four in the morning has never felt so dismal.
, went grocery shopping, ran laps with Sam, cooked dinner…
“Wow. You’re one of those people who take “make yourself at home” way too literally, huh?” I say.  I shake my head and instantly regret it. “Alright. Spill. Talk. But I’m getting coffee first.”
Over the years, Tony has recorded a multitude of voice logs as a way to preserve memories of the people closest to him.  One sleepless night, he decides to listen to a few of Steve's.
“Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some hors d’oeuvres to grab from the fridge.”
“Guilty as charged.”
“Nothing,” she says, shoving her barstool back from the counter and standing up. “We enjoy the party and act like everything’s fine, if that’s what Tony needs from us.”
[unintelligible background noise, laughter]
My Pepper.
“No, I get it, Tony. It’s fine. You’re right. Sorry for pressuring you,” he says.
I wonder if he’ll give me the opportunity to find out.
"But—" Steve starts to argue.
Everyone turns back to me.
“Need some more time deciding?” the waitress asks.
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
I’m trying to listen to what he’s saying. I really am. The problem is, his voice is competing with a million other thoughts already taking up residence in my head. I attempt to sneak glances at Steve, who’s sitting across the aisle next to Natasha, but that involves leaning around Scott— who decided to plant himself right next to me— and he’s trying to figure out what I’m looking at. So I sigh, settle back in my chair, and force myself to focus.
The table erupts again. Rhodey cradles his forehead in his hands. "If you keep dropping bombs like this, Tony, I'm gonna need you to buy a round of Aspirin instead."
Grayer than before.
Tony considers me. “What for?”
There’s no way I’m getting out of this.
“Well, healing takes time, Tony. You’re not gonna get over it overnight.”
T: Guilty? It wasn't your fault that you ended up on ice.
───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────
I consider sending him to voicemail or letting it ring out. I force myself to go against my sensibilities. “Hello?”
“Oh, okay,” he says. “Good idea.”
Tony considers our hands for a long moment before his attention drifts to the sweets menu. “That’s pretty gay. Wanna order dessert?”
"It's not like I have the flu," he says.
“No! Well, I mean, no, but…would that really be the worst thing in the world, Tony?”
"Too early?"
“I need you to pay attention to the road, please.”
A moment of silence lapses between us, anything but tense. It feels comfortable. Worn-in.
I don’t want to work right now, though. I’m squinting against the glare of my phone, and my finger is hovering over the call button, and I don’t even remember pulling up his contact but I’m not about to give myself time to over-think it. The phone rings three times before he answers.
“You clean up well,” I say, stepping aside to let him enter my foyer.
I open the door slowly and peek my head inside. Tony's lying in bed, staring at the TV and flipping listlessly through the channels, seemingly more interested in the white noise generated by all the half-second snippets than actually finding something to watch. I open the door further. "Tony."
I start to respond, but he continues before I can get a word out. "I know, I know, it's...mushy. I just.. It's more than just dates, it's more than just sleeping together. It always has been, but...I don't know. You give me something to care about beyond myself, and there are times when I feel like I really need that, you know? God, I'm bad at this..."
I push myself fully upright and study his face. There's no guilt, no uncertainty. "Wait, really? You want to?"
I wish I could express just how happy it makes me.
"Steve?" I whisper.
He’s not in the living room when I bust through the front door. Or the kitchen. Someone says something to me, but I don’t stop to hear it; I pick my way through the throng of well-meaning friends and jog downstairs, into the basement.
"It's our last night in the west coast, we should do something tonight," I say.
“You look like one, too. It’s very cute. Super endearing.”
Tony's spinning in place, arms outstretched, drinking in the familiar decor. He nods his approval once he completes a full rotation. "Not bad, not bad. A little empty, but we can take care of that pretty easily, no?"
“Fancy plane,” Scott says not two seconds later. “Do you think they have those little airplane peanuts?”
someone else. Someone that’s got his arm around Stephen Strange’s shoulders, and is nursing a cocktail like his life depends on having a drink in hand at any given moment.
"Yeah, I...yeah. Working on it."
My heart pitches. I scream his name, and he shifts slightly, awarding me a brief moment of respite. Very brief. I hug the wall and make my way over to him as fast as I dare, obliging the catwalk's wishes by pausing every time the metal groans underfoot. I drop to my knees once I'm close enough to reach out and take his face in my hands. He's not wearing his helmet, so I run my fingers over his cheeks, kiss his forehead, stroke his hair. "I'm getting you out of here."
He doesn't answer right away, instead letting his hands travel from my hair down to my chest and hips, eventually finding their way to the small of my back. He offers a tentative smile. "Is it bad if it is?"
I’m rubbing the goosebumps on my arms and considering heading out early, further solidifying Tony’s idea that I don’t like to stay out past 10PM, when the door swings open again behind me. I don’t have time to turn around before somebody wraps my leather jacket around my shoulders.
After I’m done scrubbing my skin pink, and after I’ve dried off, slicked back my hair…all that’s left to do is stare at myself in the mirror and have second thoughts.
Tony: You never talk about (your family).
I follow him despite my better judgment.
There used to be days, nights, when I thought that maybe I should've died to the snap. I used to think that maybe we pulled a fast one on the cosmos, and the universe has just been laying in wait to collect my dues. That maybe I didn't deserve to be one of the survivors. That maybe living just wasn't the same anymore.
“The man, the myth, the legend,” Bucky says, giving me a firm handshake that ends up in a hearty one-armed hug.
“I’m gonna keep badgering you until you tell me. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
Strange must have said something funny, because Tony throws his head and howls with laughter. Something turns in my stomach—possibly the mini hot dogs. I turn away and push my way through the crowd, not stopping until I’m on the front steps, breathing in the frigid air that rushes to encompass me.
He leaves the door slightly ajar.
When I wake up again, I’m immediately disoriented by the blinding light filtering through my curtains. How long have I been asleep? I sit up, wipe some drool of my chin…it’s almost noon, so far too long. Jesus Christ. I grab my phone to check my notifications, and falter as soon as I unlock it; I’m still on a call. With Steve. A call that apparently has lasted seven hours. I unplug my phone—it’s hot to the touch— and put it to my ear. I can hear some activity on the other end but can’t discern it. “Steve?”
“Oh, so you want me to know that you’re checking me out? Kinky.”
I lay my head back and close my eyes. I can feel the ache in my temples worsening, knock-knock-knocking on my skull, building pressure with no way to release it. Rhodey nudges my arm after a moment. I open one eye.
“No, you don’t strike me as a wine guy…scotch it is, then. Great idea.” He pours himself a scotch on the rocks— most of it gets on the counter—and tops off my half-empty glass from earlier.
"Tony, if I could buy you the whole franchise, I would."
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
I stumble to my feet. The room pitches. I feel drunk. No...no, being drunk would be better than this.
Alright, so the knot in my stomach is justified. Noted.
"Soon."
I raise an eyebrow. "'We', huh?"
“Hello?” Steve mumbles, voice gravelly and thick with sleep.
"It was different this time."
“I heard you wake up.”
Instead of responding, he places a hand on my shoulder and turns me to face him. My first instinct is to protest, but I’m curious to see this through; he takes my good arm and laces our fingers together, then puts his other hand on the small of my waist. I sigh as if it’s a chore and clasp his shoulder.
I feel like I’m coasting on clouds until the moment when he puts down his fork, staring down at his partially eaten food with furrowed brows. I can almost see the gears whirring in his head.
“Thanks for the heads up,” I say.
He nods slightly, eyes still trailing around the room. He looks down at our table, runs his index finger over its surface, rubs his fingers together, nods again. “Yeah, it’s a nice spot. Very atmospheric...y. Let me guess, you take all your dates here? Nice move, very personal.”
I smile. "Pardon me for doubting the great Tony Stark."
"No, I'll hold it, it's fine."
“Hey, I also mentioned dessert. Don’t you want to share a milkshake or something? Pretty romantic, if you ask me.”
“While you’re down there, you might wanna think about taking the guards off your skates before getting on the ice. Just a thought.”
I try to enjoy myself, I really do. I talk to Bucky for what must be over an hour, leaning against the wall near Tony’s potted ficus, fondly recounting tales from our youth. I listen to Bruce monologue about his latest scientific endeavors and nod whenever he pauses. I play beer pong with Natasha, who absolutely decimates me, but I physically can’t get drunk so she says I’m no fun.
When we get back to my place, he follows me to the door. We stand outside for a moment, leaning on opposite sides of the door frame, each waiting for the other to break the silence until Tony clears his throat.
Steve
He studies me for an uncomfortably long moment. His eyes bore a hole through my skull, like he’s trying to peer inside and see for himself whether I’m telling the truth. “You’re a lot of things, Tony,” he says. “But you’re certainly more than Iron Man.”
“No, I’m going to ask, what size are your feet?”
“You should be; I am. It’s a shame to lose such capable hands.”
Tony reaches over and takes it for himself. He blasts the sharp edge with his repulsars until it's glowing red hot. I think, with some amount of dry wit, that maybe being the only person in the world to weaponize your prosthetic does have its perks.
Vision glances to the plant in question, and his blonde eyebrows furrow. He reaches out to graze the wilting leaves, one of which falls into his palm. "Basil. I gave it too much water. The poor thing can hardly breathe." He holds the leaf up towards the sunlight spilling through the foliage—the sun has been our only visitor for months—and studies the back-lit veins.
"You don't have the emotional range, honey, I'm sorry. You and I both know it would have sounded like a eulogy."
"You're talking like a dead man," I say, my mouth bitter as the acrid smoke. "You aren't one yet."
It's Sam and Natasha. They bust through the door, black smoke pluming from behind them, coughing something awful. Rhodes and I run to meet them and inspect their injuries— for the most part they made it out unscathed. "Are you two alright?" Rhodes asks, immediately following up with, "Nat, did you get the files?"
"Tony," Steve says, his tone soft but cautionary.
I follow his gaze to the bright blue rubber guards still attached to my blades. Oh. Right. “I was getting there.”
“That’s a loaded question.”
I falter. Everything I considered saying to Tony once we finally talked again has fallen out of my head, replaced with a single question: “Ice skates?”
I comply, bracing myself against his hand, but my skate slips out from under me and I end up sliding down the incline on my back instead. I skid to a halt at Tony’s feet, and he stifles a laugh.
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
shitty coffee is a testament to how hard it's been to keep my eyes open.
I've been staying with him for a while as his leg heals and he constructs a workable prosthetic. I tried to tell him that rest should be his first priority, not that it means much to him; I can't keep him lying down for any length of time unless I crawl in bed with him. For the sake of both of our productive adult lives, I've taken to lending a hand in his workshop. Passing him tools, angling the light, kissing the back of his neck when he hunches over something tiny...he seems to welcome the help as well as my distractions.
I grab the nearest operatives wrist and wrench it, sending a bullet through his colleagues chest, and swing my other fist into his jaw. He goes limp and crumples to the floor.
My shield groans under the pressure. Tony reaches out, trying to take my arm. I shrug him off. I can't afford to break concentration.
"Hey, I'm right here." I pick up my glass and inspect the pointed lack of alcohol. "Anyone up for another round, on me?"
I wipe my hand on my knee and start rocking slightly. Breathe in, breathe out. Calm down. This isn’t new. Panic attacks aren’t new. But I can’t let this happen. Not here, not now. My vision is blurring. Hands clenching, shaking. Breathe in, breathe out—
kissed
"Tony." I cup his face and wipe the tears away with my thumb. "I don't care about any of that. You already know how much you mean to me. We'll find a way out of this, okay? I mean, dammit— I've almost lost you too many times to count already."
I engage my thrusters and rocket towards the catwalk. Behind me, I can hear the rest of the machinery starting to explode one-by-one, as if on cue, releasing shock waves that threaten to throw me off course—which isn't hard. I'm already unbalanced by the extra cargo clinging to my side. All I can do is grip Scott tightly and hope we don't hit the ceiling, or hope the ceiling doesn't hit us.
“Want another drink? I want another drink. I’m gonna get another drink.”
"Okay, picture this: two of your coworkers have a rivalry so strong they nearly throttle each other on multiple occasions, but then they realize they're actually not so different, or rather, they're not different in an incompatible sort of way. Now, imagine now that these two start dating, and they really really care about each other. A lot," I say. "Are you imagining it?"
Thor stood immediately, “Consider it done.” Quill liked
They looked at each other. Thor massively shrugged and Quill mumbled, “A while ago.”
The papers were the property deeds, floor plans, stock inventories, and other papers regarding the Stark Solutions complex. It was beautiful ten story building only an hour away from Avengers HQ. It had been designed to be modern, sleek, and strong in the event of an attack. There were other buildings for different divisions around it, and it all had been completed in less than four months. Tony made sure of it. He’d wanted it to be done by the time Peter graduated, and other than the initial design phase, tried to keep Peter in the dark about its progress. Peter had been so busy, he hadn’t even asked, assuming it was going to take much longer.
Aedi is a real planet in the Marvel comics, and the aliens really do be like that. ಠ_ಠ
“Me? Oh you know, I make things.”
“Different? This shit’s trademarked.”
A sudden phone call pulled him from his thoughts, and he answered it immediately on habit.
“No, there’s no one. My scanners indicate that whatever caused this explosion was already on the plane.”
.” Stark was smirking at Steve in that devilish way that told the other man he was up to no good.
“Hey! Cap, it’s fine. You were just exploring your sexuality right? I mean it’s 2016, gay marriage was legalized a year ago. I get it. Weird-ass place to do it, but I get it.” Tony said, trying to make him feel calm. He never came out to his own father or mother. The only person that knew he was bisexual when he was younger was Jarvis. Jarvis had held him when he pretended he wasn’t upset, and maybe Rogers needed some validation too. “The whole world knows I’m bisexual Steve. It’s fine. Who you choose to sleep with is none of my business.” Tony’s heart lurched.
“Hey, c’mere,” Steve said softly, pulling Tony to him and rubbing the side of his arm. “Think you’d sleep better tonight if I stayed in here with you?”
“Who ya messaging, Nebula?” Quill sat down in a chair, tossing the candy to Thor who ripped into the package and just ate a roll of the gummy straws like a sausage.
Tony’s heart lurched. He was so lonely, but he was also still mourning Pepper.
“Steve?”
The elevator went down to the basement quickly. It was a floor like the penthouse, accessible only to other Avengers and Happy. As the doors opened, it was Tony who half kissed-half dragged Steve away from the elevator and into his not-so-used room. It was a big studio-style modern apartment that didn’t look like it was underground. The ceilings were high, the floors were a lovely matte black wood, and the décor was luxuriously cozy.
“Peter, incoming call from Tony Stark.”
Tony pulled away, lips parted, eyes blinking. He what now.
Tony’s own curiosity got the better of him and he somehow managed to get the lead out of his feet and actually walk over there to Cap.
“You’re cute as hell when you do that,” Thor said, letting go of Quill’s face.
“I’ll think about it,” Tony said, watching Peter leave, feeling tired all over again. “Well that’s a way to wake up, huh?”
Running his hand down Cap’s side (his shield was in the way of his yummy back), he squeezed his ass and chuckled into their kiss. Steve backed him up against the bar so he could properly grind their hips together, growling a moan against Tony’s lips.
“Simple,” Tony said with a smirk, guessing that was the first time in his life Steve’s ever had one on. Steve nodded as he looked down at the bottle of lube near one of Stark’s knees and grabbed it, popping the cap. He squirted some on his fingers, reaching around and rubbing them right down the middle of Stark’s ass.
Steve waved a hand, pulling up a stool and sitting on it. “Probably around the same time you became Iron Dad?” Ha ha. He’d give him that.
“Fair enough. So, what’s up?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know. Saving hundreds from certain death is inconvenient for you, I’m sure,” Steve said, but his words had no venom. He approached Tony and gave him a secret smile, one that was adorable, loving, and reserved especially and only for one Anthony E. Stark. It always made Tony blush a little bit.
“Thor, it’s for you. From a person named Er-Rin. Says he was contacted by someone named Sif who needs picked up on Aedi. There are coordinates here.” Thor was laughing and shoving Quill, but the moment he heard Sif’s name he stopped dead, standing up so quick he almost fell over.
Tony refused to let Peter go back to school after that for at least a week, something Peter didn’t fight against. Tony paid for the stewardess’s whole funeral and gave her family an absurd amount of money after telling them the truth, but for the most part kept the whole ordeal under wraps. Tony was livid, beyond livid. His blood boiled at the very thought of his son almost dying in one of his own planes, because of negligence somewhere down the line. His blood boiled than an innocent lady died because somewhere, some fucking thing fell through the cracks. The world didn’t know Peter Parker was Spider-Man yet, but the world did know that Peter Parker was Stark’s son. Tony wished beyond all-reason that that didn’t put a target on Peter’s back.
Stark’s mind was a mess, “Let’s, uh, want to go downstairs?”
Tony looked at him took a deep sigh and then nodded, rubbing his face. “Yeah, I can think of a few things.” He was half-joking.
In fact, it almost seemed like he and Steve were getting along too well. Later that night when it was just the two of them and Nat had gone to bed, he wanted to ask him about something that had been weighing on his mind as of late. There was no one on Earth or in space that knew Steve better than him, which was why…
“What event?”
Tony did that squint you do when you’re not sure if you’d heard someone right or not, “Really?”
“No. But I really want some one day.”
Stark blinked, heat roiling in his groin, and he quickly stood to join him, the idea sounding suddenly pretty freaking good. Steve took Tony to his own bedroom on the residential floor—of course it was cleaner than a barrack—and the moment they were inside he kissed him, pressing Tony up against the door. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, hungry for him. Steve kissed him wetly, opening his mouth and shoving their bodies together. Tony’s tongue wrapped around Steve’s and he moaned as Steve pulled their bodies close.
Steve spoke before he could, “We’re just dating, Peter. We’re trying this out. I’m sorry we didn’t tell you, it’s a recent thing, I promise.” Steve had a warm and sincere lilt to his voice that he could tell Peter was struggling to be angry at.
Peter sat down, shaking his head in disbelief. “That...that was so fast…oh my god, Dad…” he just looked at the stack and then at Tony, still in shock.
“Okay, so first lesson. Take your date to a nice place to eat. It doesn’t have to be this expensive, but we both know who I am.” Tony walked into the place which was lavishly decorated with blacks, greys, and other suave colors. There was a classically European vibe to the décor, and a live band was playing something with lots of violin. The hostess was wearing an adorable black outfit and got them seated after Tony confirmed the reservation. They got placed in a comfy booth that felt very private. An unscented candle and fresh flowers decorated the middle of the table.
I know he's already made the determination.
I open the passenger door and allow Tony to slide in before taking up the drivers seat. “I’m excited, too,” I say, quietly.
“Is that a compliment?”
T: That's actually abuse.
"I told him to let me handle the announcement," Steve says.
“Shut
I extricate myself from his grasp as carefully as I can manage, put a pillow in my place, and tiptoe to my workshop. I know the path well, even in the dark. I don't turn on the overhead light, just a small one by my desk, and pull up a holographic screen. "Voice logs," I say.
“What are you doing?” I ask.
I glare at him. “Shh! Don’t will that into existence, I swear to god. Take it back right now.”
“No, what’s wrong?”
Silence.
I continue to stare out the windshield.
“I’m not sure I know what you mean,” I say.
He stands and makes his way over to me, slowly, nodding his head to the music.
I hand him the bouquet, and he just frowns, sets them down on his bedside table, and reaches up to take me by the lapels. He pulls me down into a sloppy kiss. "I was grabbing for
I laugh shortly. “Remember who you’re talking to here.”
He studies my face for a long moment, his own twisted and pained, before turning away, looking out the door. His silence speaks louder than words ever could.
“Oh! Would you look at that.”  I caress my coffeemaker; the glass is still warm.  Thank the heavens. I pour myself a mug and pop two aspirins. “I take back what I said, you can literally live here if you make coffee every morning. I can’t be mad at that.”
“Nothing, I just—sorry.”
"Sorry, sorry," I say. "I can do this, just one more time. Be prepared to go."
"What, and bring the whole ceiling down on top of me instead?"
“Only the best for you, my dear.”
Taken from me, so prematurely, as we dangled off the precipice of our next big life decisions. If I think about it for too long, I still feel the smoldering hands of anger tearing away at my chest, up my throat, pulling everything inside me taut.
Fuck.
"Of course, this leaves me with some extra time on my hands," I continue. "I was thinking...it might not hurt to impart some of my endless wisdom on the...next generation."
“In the shower, yeah. Why?”
───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────
“Uh-huh. You’re gonna love it.”
“Come on, the water’s fine. A little nippy, but—”
I storm the catwalk, metal on metal reverberating throughout the corridor. My vision is clouded with images of Thanos's army, of all the people I wasn't able to save— it's like all my worst memories are fighting to take the helm of my downward spiral. Everything is congealing into a single, constant sense of existential dread, and my adrenaline is far too high to stop. I'm a tank without a driver. Or, maybe, a tank driver going through a manic episode. Neither is preferable.
“You’re a piece of work.”
"Do you think I made the right decision?"
I imagine him standing there, wherever he is right now, holding the phone to his ear and expectantly waiting for me to say something else. Maybe getting ready to say goodbye and run a few hundred laps. I want him to be standing in front of me, I want to reach out and feel the forms of his face, his sharp jaw and soft cheeks…
I sigh, try to center myself.
“No.”
"Yeah..." he says, his voice taking on a wistful tone. He drifts into a moment of contemplation. I don't know if I should shake him out of it. Eventually, he matches my gaze once with pointed clarity. "You know, Steve, I had...another thought."
I don’t have a visual on Tony, but he’s the only thing clouding up my brain— I’m torn between worrying if he’s okay, and replaying his words over and over…
"Come over here," I say, "and I'll show you."
“Is it.”
"Steve, you shouldn't be here. This place is gonna blow, I can't let you—" The catwalk lurches. Tony sucks in a sharp breath.
"Hell if I know. Maybe I should get Strange to read my future. He can do that, right?"
“I can only hope,” I say. A silence passes between us. He’s looking at me expectantly, mouth crooked in one of his signature smirks. “So…uh…how do you feel about pasta?”
I spend most of the night hovering just out of reach, and Tony spends most of the night avoiding me. Dodging eye contact. Mingling with everyone except me. Deflecting any subject matter that borders on serious conversation.
“Huh? What ‘Huh’? Didn’t they have tools in the 40’s?”
"Might not be a next time if we don't get out of here," Sam says. "Where's Tony and Scott?" Rhodes shakes his head.
Tony, a pillar crushing one of his legs, pinning him to the floor.
I consider them for a moment—just a moment— before offering a nod and busting through the door.
Even though the night is going much better than I could have ever imagined, there's something eating away at the back of my brain. Festering. I think maybe I should table it for another day, until I look at Steve—bright eyes, arm wrapped around my shoulder, happy and confident— and I remember wanting to snap off a piece of that confidence and keep it for myself. I wonder if now could be that moment.
Steve wraps his arms around my waist. Immediately, I feel warmth spreading through my cheeks; I turn away so he won’t notice, and he leans his chin on my shoulder. He starts swaying. “Do you like to dance, Tony?”
Steve: [laughing] No, you— Tony. Stop it.
"You think?" Rhodey says.
The ride to the airport is quiet and tense. The air feels thick with apprehension, hard to breathe and compressing me from all angles; I squeeze the steering wheel until my knuckles start turning white. Steve’s sitting beside me, one of my extra backpacks at his feet, full of a borrowed clothes and some toiletries we bought at the dollar store. He didn’t have time to run home, given that his apartment is nearly an hour away, so we’re…making the best of it. I tried to give him clothes that I haven’t worn in a long time, so it’s less obvious, but none of them really fit him and there’s only so much a Coney-Island tee from 2011 can do.
“Oh, oh my god, I’m so sorry!” he sputters. “Uh, I’ll go get—”
Natasha puts a hand on my shoulder. "Steve, it's suicide."
Tony raises his glass, spilling a healthy amount on my shoes in the process. “Oops, looks like you’re in the splash zone.” He laughs like it’s the funniest joke he’s ever told. “Cheers to that, my treasured but stoic, and…frankly, boring… friend.” He clinks my glass, which is sitting on the counter, and throws back his shot.
All the opportunities I had to say no, all the excuses I could have given, flash in my head. I could’ve said I was busy, that I wasn’t feeling too good, hell, I could say that right now. I could tell him I have a stomachache and we have to go home, that I’m really sorry…
I’ve lived my life based on predictability and singular goals. Enlist in the war. Make a difference. I suppose that second one hasn’t changed much, though I suppose I hadn’t counted on it the impact it’d have on my own life. I’ve always been a constant of my own right, turning my nose up at Tony’s unpredictability, instability, his rash decisions. He exists in the gray area, and myself in the black and white.
Sam snores gently in the bed next to mine, and I haven’t heard a peep from Natasha in the adjacent room. The only sign of activity in our suite belongs to me, driven by my inability to sleep, and my only companion up until this point has been the ticking clock on the wall.
But since the final snap, since Tony nearly tore himself apart from the inside out for the sake of humanity, since I realized the intention behind his actions…the colors seem blurrier than before.
“Oh, yeah, I feel ya there, bud,” Scott says through a mouthful of Peanuts. “I got this sushi the other day…”
"What's that?"
“Oh, Tony!” His voice is distant. I hear footsteps, rattling. “Hold on, you’re on speaker…there. Good morning, sleepyhead.”
His hands travel under my shirt, and the cold metal sends shivers up my spine. I rest my forehead against his. "I'll think about it."
He's smiling now. Only slightly, but the twitch at the corners of his mouth tell me that he's holding himself back from beaming. "I think so, sir."
“You brought me to a restaurant that meant something to you, and it was very sweet and whatever, so I’m making you a home-cooked meal. Because I exist to one-up you,” I say, gesturing at Steve with my wooden spoon. Droplets of soy sauce fling off and land on the floor in front of him.
I can’t help but laugh. “Sorry.”
“Then find another way to get your sweet ass over here.”
“You flatter me,” I say.
“What do you see in me, Steve?” he whispers.
"You can...put that down, if you want to."
I bolt upright in bed and gasp for air.
In this case, it's Sam's voice that drags me back to reality. "Tony, do you copy?"
“Not so fast,” Sam says. “Rhodes, Steve, Tony—you’ll be running distraction, same as myself. I need you to get in, split up, and cause as much ruckus as you can while keeping them away from Natasha and Scott.”
"There's no time, just go! Get out of here!"
The entrance hall bleeds into a large living room, a kitchen, and a stairway to the second floor. It’s a rustic house, built from sturdy oak beams, and Tony’s populated it with his minimalist furniture. There’s a good amount of people here already, filling out the space. There’s Bruce, now idly mingling in the kitchen with Scott and Doctor Strange, who’s practicing witchcraft to refill his drink. There’s Wanda and T’challa, sitting on the stairs, engaged in idle conversation. Sam and Bucky sit across from each other on the couch, and they wave when I enter. I gravitate towards them. They both stand up to greet me.
He puts a hand on my shoulder and creates some space between us. "It's late," he says. "I should probably..."
He sits back, assuming his default shit-eating grin. “Sounds even better the second time around. You gotta get me a voice recording of that.”
“Well, you
“Sorry.”
“I’m sure you’ll do fine tomorrow,” I offer. “We’ve done missions like this a million times.”
I turn around. "Scott, can you walk?"
I’m struggling just to stay upright. The ice has a mind of its own, and I swear its agenda is to take me down to its level. I wouldn’t be surprised; we have a bit of a rocky history. “I’m not gonna ‘shuffle’.”
He doesn't argue, nor waste time blasting off in the direction of the cars.
I nod.
“Mhm-hmm.” He pauses. “Honestly, though, are you okay?”
It's the man I see...saw...a future in.
“Tony.”
He considers me for a long moment. Something has changed in his expression, and I can't pinpoint it; he seems absorbed in his thoughts. I tilt my head at him. "Something on your mind, Tones?"
───── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ─────
"Oh, what a shame. Guess we'll have to go out for a nice sit-down dinner, then."
“Oh. I see.” Steve’s silent for a moment. “Do you want to elaborate on that?”
He makes a low, quiet noise. Maybe he says something, but I don't hear it, I just feel the movements of his lips against mine.
“Kind of sounds like it does.”
“So, that’s that, we can’t get in,” Tony says. “Case closed, solved it for you.”
⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅⋅☆⋅
"I love you," I whisper.
be. What is it like to live like Tony? To allow a little spontaneity into my routine? What is it like to love him?
Tony reaches over and pokes my arm. “Something eatin’ you?”
"Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how vast this tower is, and how tiny your apartment is..."
He nods, with less vigor this time, but certainly not less sincerity.
Tony takes my hands again and starts skating backwards, pulling me with him. “Remember what I said about pushing with the side of your foot. Just go easy. There, see? You’re getting it.”
“Goodnight.”
It’s not long before I’m out of breath and bending over, hands on my knees, questioning all of my life decisions.
I turn to Sam, who pats my shoulder. “Merry Christmas, Cap.”
I reach down and cradle his cheek in my hand. I trace my fingers over his soft and delicately wrinkled skin, savoring the warmth at my fingertips. "Tony—"
Nat turns to face me. “Welcome to the party.”
“I’ll be there.”
"Can you make it go faster?" I say.
a smart-ass. I’m revoking my job offer.”
Steve yawns again, lifting my whole upper body with his heaving chest. I think he tries to say something through it. He ends up trailing off. I let the silence linger for a while, listening instead to his rhythmic heartbeat.
I sink to my knees next to Tony, unable to meet his eyes. My attention is on the remaining half of my shield, little more than a jagged edge now.
After a while, Natasha seems to pick up my apprehension. She lays a hand on my shoulder, startling me out of my thoughts. “Hey, are you okay?”
Shards of vibranium hit my face, and my hands hit the pillar, which crashes back down with double the force. Tony cries out. "Steve, Steve, you have to stop. My leg—I can't. I can't get out."
The next hour is a bubbly blur of laughter, conversation, clinking glasses. An unexpected yet appreciated celebration. They have a lot of questions— "So, who initiated it?" "He kissed me first." "Okay, but you were totally coming onto me." "Was I? I can't recall." And the like. They seem genuinely curious how we've been able to make it work. Steve says that it's been surprisingly easy, and I question his use of the word "surprisingly."
"Get Scott," Sam says, pointing towards the door. "Get him the fuck out of here. I'll take Natasha. Steve, Rhodes, clear the area. Get as far away as possible."
“I could,” I say, partially under my breath, but I can tell by the slight tilt of his head that Steve caught it. He seems contemplative, like he’s weighing his options. Or perhaps doubting my sincerity.
He’s the first to break the silence. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
I jolt. To my surprise, Steve actually is in the room with me— bleary-eyed and all, wearing only his pajama bottoms, leaning against the doorjamb for support. Mo is perched on his shoulders, and she uses his arm as a springboard to hop onto my table, mewing at me like she's equally confused as to why I'm not in bed. Indignant, even.
I stare at the space he used to occupy, draw my jacket tighter around my body, and heave a sigh of defeat. “Tony, wait!”
“Can you come over?”
I can't bring myself to move. "Tony..."
“Understood,” Rhodey says.
“I don’t know!” he says, nearly shouting. “I don’t know, okay? I was expecting you to say that it didn’t mean anything, or it was just a one-night…thing. Tony, I was prepared to never talk to you again if it came to that. Jesus. I didn’t think you’d actually be honest with me.”
He’s still as a statue. When he speaks, his voice is a hoarse whisper. “It’s haunting me.”
Maybe...
“It doesn’t matter.”
It’s Nat’s turn to arch an eyebrow. I heave a sigh and settle back into my seat. None of us say anything for the rest of the drive.
I clear my throat. “Well, if you’re gonna loiter, come make yourself useful.”
Almost too easy.
“What do you want? Something sweet? Dry? Packs a punch?” Tony doesn’t give me much time to respond before adding, “You know what, I’m just gonna surprise you. Don’t worry, you’ll love it.” He turns to the wall of liquor and rummages around until he settles on a large bottle of something I can’t see the label of.
Hospital staff try so hard to distract you from the fact that other people have been sick in the same bed as you. They scrub all the surfaces until they sparkle, only to achieve an overwhelming stench of cleaning products, yet this room still isn't my own. The walls are too bare, and there's never anything good on daytime television. Steve's visits help, but they're monitored and limited, and the staff keep saying things like 'you need to rest'. If I never nap again, it'd be too soon.
