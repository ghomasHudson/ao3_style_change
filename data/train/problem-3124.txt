Dean waits until the front door snicks shut before shuffling closer. Cas rests his head on his shoulder.
They lapse into silence. After a while, Sam complains of a stomachache and he ducks off into the house. Jo follows him, leaving Dean in the car alone.
Adra comes back a couple minutes later, soda in one hand and plastic-wrapped snacks in another. She sighs as she sits down. Dean pops the soda tab. Eugh, it's lukewarm, but better than nothing.
"Remind me why we have to wear these stupid things?" Sam whines, pulling at his tie. Dean forced him out of bed at stupid AM by dropping Gabe on him, claws and all, and shoved this monkey suit at him.
Adra furrows her brow and puts out two fingers, cautiously. Gabriel sniffs them and backs back into the carrier.
"I don't see why not,” He shrugs, “She got pregnant with me when she was my age. Besides,” He makes a face, “I'm personally glad our first time won't be in the back of your car.”
Someone like him. The way he says sounds like he means more than just 'someone who's sick', but Dean doesn't press.
After a while, Dean gets tired of peopling and goes to hide out in the other wing. Sam is already there, crunching on some Cheez-its and shooting the shit with Jo while she rubs his shoulders. They both straighten up when he comes in. He pulls off his tie and throws it on the table, where it flops like a dead snake.
“Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Why did you... Think that, I guess, about me and Cas?” He pulls on the cord of his amulet.
“Dean. I've been thinking about it, and I think it's time you came home,” He says. Dean manages to take a step back, and John's eyes flash for a second before he regains control. He forces a smile, “We're family, kiddo. We're all each other's got.”
“Oh.” He shuffles so he's sitting cross-legged, leaning up to the front seat. “What do you believe then?”
Dinner is amazing: pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and green beans that don't come from a can. Dean helps himself to seconds and then thirds while they catch up. Mrs. B's PT is doing miracles – she can serve the food and make her way from the kitchen to the dining room with just her cane. She's not able to go back to work full-time yet, but her boss has been flexible about her hours. Mr. B has been hosting Klingon poetry club on Thursday nights, and Charlie's trying to get a cosplay club going at her school.
Something is sitting on Castiel's chest, pressing steadily down. It hurts. He tries to cough and it gets stuck halfway up his throat. Merde. There are more machines beeping and whirring around him than there were this morning. Yesterday? Last year? He isn't sure.
The rest of the night goes quickly. Novak is finishing his desserts just as 9 o'clock hits, and Jo shows him how to stack his dishes and bring them back to the kitchen. She flips the open sign to closed, slaps a bucket full of dirty water a rag down on the bar, gets to work. Ash puts on the rock station and turns it up.
“We uh, we grew up on the road,” Dean says, “Sam and me. John, too, of course. We lived all over. It was fine, y'know? We had each other. But one day, Dad got a call from Bobby, something about the hardware store up the road needing some guys, and John uh, well, he got off the call, quit his job right there and told us to get packing. We left that night and got here in two days when it should've taken three. I think... I think we missed it, ya know?”
"Ah.” She is pensive for a moment, looking from her coffee to her son to the stairs. “You know, I get the impression you'd have to move heaven before you moved Dean."
Jo opens her mouth to say something, but can't get a word out before her lip starts quivering. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Dean ushers her inside with an arm around her shoulder. He leads her into the kitchen, where Sam hands her a glass of water. He rubs her shoulder until she's calm enough to speak.
She purses her lips. "Shit. We've lost half our knights already. I'm trying to set up a meeting with the fair folk, but they won't let me passed the gate--" She gestures to the wooden mushrooms lined up in front of her, painted vibrant purples and reds; Some have angry faces on them. "I don't know how much longer Moondoor'll last."
They quiet down when they start eating, no one wanting to foul the religious experience that is Bobby's cooking.
“We need a teacher to oversee everything, though,” She explains while pouring herself more apple cider, “And all the teachers at my school are old and lame.”
He blinks, "Um. " He steadies himself and swallows the lump in his throat, "Nothing. I've just missed you. What, um, what say you we go out this weekend? Just the two of us?"
In the car, they get everything situated in silence. He clicks in. Jo hands him her iPod, and when they make eye contact,they burst out laughing. "Holy shit, Castiel." She covers her mouth when she laughs.
Dean nods slowly, watching the clock as he chews it over. "So losing the vegetables really threw a wrench in that plan?"
"I, uh, like the tie," Dean says, gesturing for him to sit at the table thats been miraculously cleared off.
The young man blinks a few times and his face carefully blanks. He's gotten taller since high school, filled out a bit. It looks good on him. "Uh, hey." He squints, "Cas, right? Sorry, uh, it's been a while."
“I hear you,” Dean says. He leans closer, like he's sharing a secret, and Castiel wills his heart rate to go down, “I gotta admit, I've been in class but I've still barely started.”
Cas falls asleep on the couch two episodes in, and when he starts awake a couple hours later, his spikey jacket has been removed and there's a blanket draped over him. With a smile, he curls up and falls back asleep instantly.
"Yes. These are crocuses, they just bloomed." Cas smiles when he takes the flowers and The Vest. Dean catches Sam raising his eyebrow and flips him off.
Cas forgets everything he's ever done in his life for a solid five seconds. "I'm in school with Dean. I volunteer at the library, too."
Dean grins, “Good, man, I'm doin' awesome.” He looks like he wants to say something else, but then a familiar guitar riff comes on, crackling through the bass-boosted speakers, “Oh, hell yes.” He grabs Castiel by the arm and drags him back to the middle of the floor, and that's how the two of them, belligerently drunk – alongside two dozen equally blasted fraternity kids – wind up screaming along to Journey's
“He would hate all of this crap. Too processed,” She remarks, making a face at her slice of cheesecake before shoving it in her mouth in one bite.
She went through something like this when she was my age, I guess, and she makes me feel... I dunno, human. Not like a monster.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sam move and he whips a hand out to stop him. "Fine," He spits, "Fine, sir. Where's your phone?"
“I made breakfast,” Sam says when Dean emerges. He rubs his eyes. Their house is always a touch too warm, and Sam cooking doesn't help, but it smells amazing, so Dean decides valiantly to not care. He grabs a paper plate.
They stay out in the cold a little while longer. Castiel puts his hands in his pockets when he can no longer feel his fingers.
He's quiet for a long time. Snow catches on his eyelashes and in his hair. He looks at a point somewhere past Castiel.
Thunk! Something hollow whacks Dean on the back and he goes down. Shit, that's 10 HP easily. He scrambles to pick up the spell packets he missed, but the goblin in front of him is unfrozen, and starts smacking him with his club.
“Language,” Dean chides. He's already abandoned his own work and is looking over Sam's shoulder. Sam rolls his eyes and moves his paper so he can see.
Adra frowns, "That's unfortunate. Free condoms were popularized in the 1980s by gay activists amidst the AIDS crisis, actually. They understood that promoting safer sex was more important than pretending we did not have it.” She gestures with the condoms again, “Do
“I always wanted a cat,” Castiel says, patting the cats butt, “I asked my mother for one for Christmas for five years in a row.”
“Yes, thank you,” Castiel nods. He climbs off the car, too, landing with a soft thump. He doesn't flail, just coughs.
It's now that Castiel steps in. He puts himself physically in between them, overtop the hot cocoa and smashed ornament pieces.
They pull up to the Winchester's at the same time a young blonde girl is leaving. She looks about Sam's age, is very tall, and is holding a present. She waves at the Novaks, they wave back.
Dean bristles, thinking of his own father. “Uh. Right. But the least he could do now is support his uh, need for companionship.”
“Hey, man! Glad you could make it, come on in.” He's in just a t-shirt and jeans, a beer can already in hand.
"Ah. I like, um, trying all the desserts in a restaurant the first time I go. It's a hobby, I guess."
Woodshop is fine. They're making bridges out of popsicle sticks, and more than one of Dean's classmates makes theirs look like a dick. He gets a laugh out of it. He flirts with some of the girls. All in all, not a bad class, except he's so distracted he almost forgets his bookbag on the way out.
"Hey," Dean says after a few minutes, giving him a Vulcan kiss across his scarred knuckle, "You mentioned something earlier about like, funeral roses? What was that about?"
"Shit," Dean says, moving a hand to his hair, "Shhh, baby, shhh, it's okay." His hands are warm. A gust of wind blows around them.
He looks out the window, where a shovel is sticking out of the ground in the vegetable plot. “It's strange. Doing it without her.”
“I have a tattoo appointment next month,” He says, following Adra around the garden. The tiger lilies are past bloom, collecting in shriveled husks at their own feet. He and Adra are talking of replacing them with foxglove when the time comes.
Dean feels like he's just been insulted, but he's not totally sure. “Yeah, but, cheese dogs.” He says empathically.
It takes him a second to realize Cas is joking, "Yeah, good one. No, I... I don't know, man. Its not what my dad would do. It feels wrong."
"Hey, Cabbage, it's okay," Mr. B says, having returned from the kitchen. Charlie falls forward into her mother's chest and Mrs. strokes her hair. "Did you have fun and do your best?"
His mother is on the night shift again, which leaves them a few hours together when Castiel isn't sleeping. They don't talk much. Adra does some organizing. Occasionally she moves a chess piece. Whenever Castiel is awake, he moves one as well. They've been playing for about a week now, all together. They make good progress today: he takes a knight, she takes a rook and a couple pawns.
He grins and hauls the carriage over to the kitchen table, moving a few books aside. The thing inside shifts and lets out a low growl. He sneezes.
“It's not looking good. He stopped breathing for a bit this morning. They got him back, but, um, we need to go, now.”
“Gilda.” She can barely get her girlfriend's name out before she breaks into a smile, “She's a fairy from the Montressor realm. A fairy, Dean! Bestill my heart!" She puts a hand to her chest and sighs.
Sam chuckles, “Yeah, I know what you mean. Do you, uh, want some cold medicine? We should have some.”
He squeezes his eyes shut. He does. Dean is warm and Castiel can feel his heart thundering in his ribs. He wraps his arms around Dean and squeezes.
His roommate is out when he gets back to his dorm. He hasn't seen the man much at all since the year started, but that's partly on him. Garth seems nice, if a little weird, but Cas doesn't really have room to judge.
One Saturday, Dean is sitting at the kitchen table reading over a life insurance letter when Adra pushes a familiar cardboard box across to him.
The audience goes wild as the trio takes their bows. One group, who Sam suspects is the girl's family, wolf-whistle. Then, Kevin's up. He can't see Sam, but Sam gives him a thumbs up anyway. You got this, Kev, he thinks really hard, trying to send the message telepathically. Kevin bites his lip, his brow shining, but as soon as the accompaniment starts, all that goes away and he melts into the music. He plays a slow, somber song, like cold waves crashing over the side of a ship, or a bird hopping across a snow-covered grave. Sam recognizes bits and pieces the song from Kevin playing it in the practice rooms after school, but hearing it all together is something else. It's haunting and beautiful.
Hm. "She would sing you Hey Jude to get you to fall asleep. And every night she'd tell us angels were watching over us. And... she loved you, Sam, she really did."
The first thing he registers when he peels his eyes open is Adra is passed out in the chair, still with her jacket and shoes on. Balthazar left a note on the whiteboard to ring if Castiel needs anything.
He's jealous, though he won't admit it. He hasn't cried. Not when Dr. Marilyn came in to offer their condolences, not during all the meetings with Pastor Jim, not in digging through boxes and boxes of baby photos. Not once. It sucks.
It turns out Castiel isn't fine. He's in the middle of moving one of the ornament boxes onto the coffee table when a deep pain slams him in the ribs. He fumbles forward, the box just barely stopping him from crashing into the table.
"Is everyone gonna ask me that? Geez, I'm starting to feel like you like him better than me," He groans.
at Cas' suggestion, and Cas is re-reading Frankenstein, for fun this time. He folds the corner of the page down and nudges Castiel's sockfoot with his bare one.
He goes to the shed and pulls the dangling light switch, a tiny sun in the center of the garden-universe. He puts the watering can back in it's place. All is in order. He makes the mistake of looking to the corner where she and him carved their names, and a lump rises in his throat. He breathes in, hold, out.
He's right about the colors, red-blue-green teddy bears dance around on the walls, except for the spot where a TV used to be. The TV is long gone but the wires it connected to are still hooked into the wall. The furniture is stacked into a corner. If he squints he can imagine how it was back in the day: rows of art supplies in color-coded drawers, a tiny table covered in crayon marks, and two enormous ketchup and mustard beanbag chairs sitting side-by-side in the middle of the chaos.
Right, it's summer now. He's officially a high school graduate. Graduation itself was a small affair: instead of attending a dumb ceremony, the gang spent the afternoon in the hospital. They brought Castiel a cake, a proper one using an old recipe of Bobby's, and all the nurses on the floor came in and celebrated with them. They took pictures with his diploma, which he propped up on the side table.
The weeping cherry should be ready to bloom any day now, which means Dean needs prepare to sweep up the zillion pink petals it's going to toss across the yard. He looks at his reflection in the mirror and it hits him: he's going to do it alone. There will be no Castiel to sit on the edge of the fountain and egg him on. No Castiel to tell him the story of how he and Anna planted it the week before she left, and how it fell over three times that August before he finally tied it to a stake to keep it upright. No Castiel to thank him with kisses for a job well done.
“That was my real rock bottom,” Bobby grimaces, “I remember layin' in the hospital just... angry at the whole world for takin' my Karen away. But I think I was really angry at myself, you know? I was trying to punish myself. But then it occured to me, well, I wouldn't be the man Karen married if I gave up. The world doesn't just stop turnin' when you lose somebody and it's not fair to let it.”
She pinches the bridge of her nose, “Look, dude, I appreciate you doing that for me, but I still think you should see your family.”
Castiel pats the spot next to him. Jo swings the table out of the way and Sam goes over, sitting down on the bed gingerly.
It's a welcome distraction actually, running the potatoes under hot water and scraping dirt out of the eyes. Methodical, kinda like working on the car. It keeps his mind from running around in circles anyway.
He sees his mom briefly between her student appointments, she reminds him to take a Tylenol if he gets a headache. They talk about Anna and he warns her his new friend might be stopping by. Adra raises her eyebrows.
Castiel's hair is going every direction and the front is dyed bright, bright blue. He squints at the car, tracking it's approach with his eyes. “Um, hello, Dean. What are you doing here?”
Dean's eyes go wide, "Oh sweet Jesus, stop. Stop! My God, Bobby, just give me a pamphlet or something!"
He goes over to the back window and flips the light on. The fountain is overflowing and the vegetable bed has started leaking mud onto the pathway. Putain. He coughs a couple times.
Princess Leia bounds over to her, tail wagging, and lets out a tremendous bark. Mrs. Bradbury waves at Dean and takes the dog out the back door.
“He snores.” When Castiel sleeps, he snores, loud and constant like a car engine. Now he doesn't. Now he isn't.
"Thanks, I wanted somethin' a bit different. My sister used to dye her hair like this all the time."
There's a clatter from the kitchen, and Dean whips around to see Sam covered in something brown and sticky, and Gabe around his feet.
, and Castiel went in for the night. He was exhausted by then, and barely flung off his jacket before falling face-first onto his bed.
“They're fine, I guess,” He groans, “I have three papers and a test. The test is next Friday, and thankfully I can turn the papers in when I'm finished with them.”
Castiel turns back to garden, where the carnage lies. Dean's grip is strong, or else Castiel's fever-weak, so he's stuck, Dean gripping him tight.
Sam smiles softly and leans against Castiel, warm. They sit like that for a while, Sam sniffling and doing a valiant job trying to hide it. When he gets up, he takes half a step away, then spins back and presses a kiss to Castiel's temple, hard.
“I think I need to uh, stretch my legs for a bit,” Dean says once Sam leaves, looking off into middle distance.
Eventually, Cas wades in up to his knees, a full-body shiver wracking through him as he does. The stones beneath his feet are smooth and cool for the most part, although he has to step carefully. Little fish zip between his legs with precise movements. He kicks water at Anna and she screeches and splashes him back, and that's all the motivation he needs to dive in. He's stronger than her though not by much; She kicks his shin to get him to fold over, and he tackles her legs and pulls her under.
John stands slowly. He puts his book down and tucks his glasses into his shirt. He walks over to Dean and stares through him. "Hm. I can't seem to open the fridge. I wonder why," He says. Dean jumps out of the way, his stomach churning. John smirks. He roots around and pulls out a beer. "I wonder where my son is," He says, "Off being an ungrateful shit somewhere, no doubt." He doesn't look at Dean as he finishes the beer and goes to his room.
They wait for Dean to come up before they go inside themselves and are ushered into a big stage room with movie-theater-like fold-down seats. Someone hands them each little pamphlets for order of performance. Kevin is second, Jo is fourth, and then Jo accompanies a couple other performers on piano. The theater smells a little like drying paint, and Sam can see some theater props tucked into the corner behind the big velvet curtain.
"Good t'see you, kid," Bobby says. He wheels over with them to the sink. "Hey," He touches Dean's arm and drops his voice, "Cas is a good kid. You keep him around, alright?" He looks in Dean's eyes and Dean is struck with the certainty that Bobby knows.
“Um.” He doesn't know how to tell Bobby he had no plans, that he was going to hang out on the couch until he became one with it. But as he's thinking of what to say, an idea strikes, “Um. I'm gonna go see Adra and uh, check on the garden.” It's been a few days, anyway.
“What the hell?!” Sam bursts out of his room with his pants unbuttoned. He runs and grabs the fire extinguisher, blasting it at the tree. White foam erupts out, covering the whole tree and half of the wall behind it. The flames die quickly, and the tree falls over under the weight.
John is slung across the couch reading when they get in. Sam glances at him, but Dean shoos him off to bed and Sam practically falls through the doorway.
Castiel's hangover in the morning is absolutely wicked. His mouth tastes like sand and the lights – which were already much too bright for his liking – are painful to look at. He discovers this by accident, flipping on his desk lamp and immediately regretting it. After he's eased his eyes back open, he discovers to his surprise that he's in his own bed – the one in his dorm room, not Anna's couch. He puts a hand over his eyes and tries to piece together exactly what happened the night before while he gropes around for his sunglasses.
There's silence for a few moments. Adra's shoulders begin to shake, and it takes Dean a second to realize she's crying.
Dean holds out his hand and she gives him a piece. It takes like preservatives with an afterthought of cinnamon. “You said it, Ma,” He says, “You know, Cas has never had a cheese dog?”
"Thank you for agreeing to do this," Cas says when they're out of earshot of Sam or any of the neighbors.
Castiel has one hand propping up his head, and the other is curled in near his waist. Dean reaches over and brushes his first two fingers across Castiel's. Cas watches the movement, "You did that the other day, too. Why?"
The sun is setting behind Bobby's place when they pull up, painting the sky in stripes of pink and orange. Cas hesitates before getting out, his hand tight around the wine bottle.
He stares at Dean a moment longer. "Sure." A beat of silence, "You know, Jess had a girlfriend last summer, Sarah. They met at camp. So, y'know, I really don't care, dude."
Anna's roommate is flung sideways in the armchair, tossing a little ball up in the air with one hand and catching it in the same.
The rest of the drive is quiet. Dean's stomachache travels up to his throat. Sam has a couple of friends waiting for him on the front steps when Dean drops him off, and watching them take him in with a smile eases Dean's yuck for a moment. The sun has just started peeking over the trees when he pulls out of the parking lot.
“Mm,” Castiel answers, closing his eyes. He hurts lately, an ever-present ache that all the treatments in the world can't seem get rid of.
It dips back down to the quiet melody, then roars again. Jo plays with her whole body, her shoulders swaying in time, her face contorting with each change of pace. The song goes on for several minutes, and Jo flips page after page seamlessly, until finally one sequence falls away, then another, and the room is left with only the little melody from the beginning, birds hopping across still-frozen earth at the first sign of spring, and then nothing.
“Oh, awesome!” Dean lights up, “Thank you. Um, you can set it over there.” He points to the kitchen table, where Sam has started clearing a space.
The fountain is a couple heads taller than him, with a naked cherub on top pouring water into the base, although right now it is pouring a block of ice into a larger block of ice.
Soon, Cas' stomach starts to growl, so they clean up as best they can, toss their clothes back on, and go hunting for something to eat. On their way into town, Cas fishes his phone out and sees a couple messages from Dean. Curious, he opens them while they're waiting for the man to come on the crosswalk sign.
“Hey, man,” Dean says, perversely grateful for the distraction. He clears his throat and holds out a box of tissues. Ash's hair is pulled into a little braid at the nape of his neck.
The conversation turns from Dean to other topics as Anna finishes making dinner. Castiel tells her about the idiots in his English II class and she regales him with how badly Noah fucked up the delivery schedule, so she had to haul 10 boxes of records in and get them on display all in a single afternoon, with the promise of more coming tomorrow.
"You said it," He says, flashing her a smile and squeezing her arm. He sets his face and gives her his best knightly look of determination, "C'mon, go show the fair folk what's what."
Dean nods. He's pensive for a little bit. "I'm real sorry about Anna,” He says eventually, spinning his ring around his finger, “Y'know, Bobby... His wife died in a hunting accident when we were kids. He went to the hospital on their next wedding anniversary. Dad always said it was a shop accident, but, I wondered... Sorry. Sorry, you probably don't wanna hear about this."
Dean sighs and glances at his dark phone screen, “Not yet. Adra's heading over now, though, so hopefully I'll have an update within the hour.”
"It was," Dean says, gesturing with the wine, "Bobby asked me to bring this downstairs, wanna come with?"
He does some research on his phone, and discovers that half of double-lung transplant patients live for five years after the surgery. Cas would have to be on immunosuppressants to make sure his body doesn't reject the the new lungs, but it would give him a fighting chance.
Mrs. Bradbury wheels herself in from the kitchen. She's a proud woman, stout, with her long red hair clipped back to show off her dangly earrings and the long scar that runs from her cheekbone to just behind her ear. “Leia! Let's go outside! C'mon girl!”
Castiel takes a deep breath and it comes out in pieces, “Better.” Sam looks around, but there are no chairs. There is an empty spot against the wall where no one's standing, so he shrugs Castiel in that direction.
“Yeah uh, on my back. It would be a pair of wings, but like, made out of flowers? For, um, for Castiel.”
As he cooks, Sam chatters about his trip to the mall with Kevin last weekend and Dean makes himself a cup of coffee. Apparently they got Starbucks courtesy of Mrs. Tran, and they were able to get free samples at the food court three times before they got recognized. While he talks, Dean checks the calendar for John's work schedule. Monday, November 2nd. Huh, he's not scheduled the next couple days. So where the hell is he?
He tenses."The usual." He gestures to his chest. Upstairs, the shower turns on. "The... Dean of it all."
The rest of the show is amazing. Everyone who performs is just as talented as the last. Jo does amazingly accompanying the different players, and during closing remarks they give her and the other senior a special shout out. Afterwards, they are freed to the hallway lobby while they wait for the players to come back. Castiel is tucked away near the water fountain, looking worn. Sam goes over.
Dean chews on a mouthful of pulled pork, not really tasting it. He checks his phone for the millionth time. Still nothing. Damn it.
Dean's chest tightens, “Uh, I dunno. Maybe mechanical engineering? I do time at Bobby's auto shop and I like it just fine.”
“Good morning to you, too,” She says, not looking up from her notebook. She's doodling a small gun, the one Ellen has hanging on the wall of the Roadhouse in between the singing fish and the Elvis Presley poster.
"Jesus, shit, “ He says, “I thought you were gonna have like, fun little anecdotes about your old friends."
“Alright, my friend, breakfast is ready,” Meg announces. She's set up a food tray at his waist. The shake has a red and white striped straw sticking out. He takes a deep breath and clears some mucus before diving in.
"Right. Uh, good, I'm good," Dean shifts his weight onto one foot, "Uh, hey, I gotta get to class, but um, it was good to see you, man."
Castiel looks at him, really looks: the way he's speared his hands into his pockets, the worn-out knee of his jeans, the shine of his eyes threatening to spill over. “You shouldn't have to bear that burden, my friend. You have no control over what your father does.”
Castiel's funeral is the following Saturday. There's a church service, and then the priest invites up anyone who would like to say a few words. Sam goes first and reads a poem by Rupert Brook – The Fish, a favorite of Castiel's. Dean slings an arm around his brother when he comes back.
Adra's smile is as bright as the sun, “Oh, Dean, that would be wonderful. You would be really great at that.”
“Nah,” Anna shrugs. The crosswalk sign beeps at them and they hurry to the other side, “Do whatever you want, dude.”
Outside, the snow has started to come down in earnest. Cas' face gets cold as soon as he steps outside. Dean's ears and cheeks are turning pink by the end of the driveway, but he doesn't say anything about it. They walk around for a few minutes, Dean huffing every once in a while. He jams his hands into his pockets. He scuffs his feet, occasionally kicking loose rock down the street. Castiel walks beside him, his arms at his sides. The lights on a nearby house flip from red to blue to green.
“Yeah, man. Maybe you can start a book club at the library or something and invite everyone. I'm sure Cas can help you set it up.”
While Castiel tries to suppress his coughing, Sam watches people go by. A lot of the parents are holding flowers for the kids. He spots Mrs. Tran and waves. Sam tells Cas about the families he recognizes, points out where one dad is standing across the room from the mom because they got divorced a year ago. Castiel nods with his eyes closed, leaning his head back on the cool painted brick.
He watches her back as she walks and tries to see what he means, but fails. “I wouldn't know,” He says honestly.
Dean hadn't cared much who knew they were on a date, except John. He was the one person Dean put his foot down on. Watching him inch towards the front door, his back straightening and his smile falling away, Castiel is filled with sudden, white hot rage. John is the adult here, he shouldn't make Dean act this way. It isn't fair!
As much time as Dean has been spending at the hospital lately, Adra's been spending double. She shows up first thing and sits by Castiel's bedside. Sometimes they go on wheelchair walks down the corridor, sometimes not. She stays with him until she leaves for work that night. Sometimes she takes the work to the hospital with her and does it in the waiting room. Dean isn't sure if she's been home to shower more than once in the last two weeks. He can't say he blames her.
Anna would huff a laugh, “I'm sure. Still, there's a charm to them.” She would tear off a couple and tuck them behind her ear. The others she would put on his pillow.
Dean hums. Alright. “Cool.” He'll probably be fine to work with, then. He reopens his phone, which has gone dark.
He looks at his reflection, trying to see it how Dean will. He looks smart, well-put-together. A little small, and not just because he got Adra's frame. He looks better when he smiles, so he does that.
Castiel nods, “Well, if you're a good boy and eat all your vegetables, Santa will see what he can do.”
He grins. Ah, Meg. She checks his vitals and hooks him to a mobile IV. He's a little shaky when he stands, but it passes. He does take Meg's offered arm though, and they shuffle out into the hall.
He gets up and goes to the fridge. There's the weird yogurt Sam likes, and some coldcuts that don't smell too bad, milk, and eggs. He grabs a slice of ham and rolls it around a slice of cheese.
“Yes. Your partner Castiel let me know he's out sick right now, but he asked me to give you his phone number so you two can get in touch.”
He admires his mother's optimism, really, giving him condoms. He doesn't know how he'll be able to handle... that... if the mere thought of kissing Dean makes him this giddy. Honestly, Adra.
The grave is small, out of the way in a back corner beside an old oak tree. A few more people say a few more words, and then that's it. It's over. Dean wants to stay to watch them lower the casket, but one of the funeral home workers gives him a weird look, so he leaves.
They don't say anything else. The longer the silence stretches on, the more nervous Dean gets. What was he thinking? He doesn't even know if Cas likes him like that, and he just kissed him out of nowhere. Fuck. He's probably just waiting for the right time to tell him off, to say he never wants to see him again. Fucking awesome. Great. Way to go, Winchester, ruining like, the best friendship you've ever had. You stupid motherfucker.
Castiel opens his mouth, but he is interrupted by a cough, and a cough, and a cough. Eventually, he gives Sam a mournful look.
He waits a few minutes for a reply, and when none comes he turns his phone back over. He sleeps again until his stomach pangs wake him. It's getting dark outside. To his own surprise, he checks his phone before heading into the kitchen. Nothing.
He thrashes and escapes. He kicks the fence and stomps it before Dean is able to heave him back. Dean drags him over to the fountain and forces him to sit down. It's embarrassing how easily he goes. The concrete is cold through his pajama pants and the impact sends a jolt up his spine.
Not five minutes after she finishes her bowl does Ruby get up, stretch, and head out for her night shift at the bar a couple streets away. On her way out, she reaches for Anna's knee like it's a practiced gesture, but hesitates with a glance at Castiel. Cas looks away pointedly, and in his peripheral vision he sees Ruby's hand make contact.
Adra nods, “I really appreciated the meals I had growing up, and I wanted him to have the same experience.”
"Hey..." Dean says, putting a hand on Castiel's thigh. He's seated on the floor, his upper half curled around Cas' legs, genuflecting at the altar of Castiel. "That sucks, dude.”
He smiles with one side of his mouth, "Alfie confirmed it I suppose, but part of me always felt like... If I pictured my future, it was with a man."
Dean makes them sandwiches. He burns one, but he gives that one to himself and makes Castiel a second.
Now that they're alone, Castiel takes a moment looks Dean up and down. He's a little stocky, clean shaven, and slightly bow-legged. It's an appallingly hot combination, if Cas says so himself.
Dean rolls his eyes, "Some people. Well, you know him, he's probably doing ungodly science experiments with it."
He chuckles. “Next time.” He closes his eyes and different colors swim in and out behind his eyelids. It feels like it already is next time. Or right now. Or like... time is standing still. Something's going on with the time, that's for sure. Time travel would be cool. Just. Going forward to whatever point you wanted. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Dean would fast-forward to after he cleaned the fucking cat hair off the couch. God, he is so relieved John isn’t home.
“I bet.” Adra says, stirring her coffee, “Sometimes I – I'll look out there and still expect to see her sitting on the edge of the fountain, one hand in the water. You know.”
If you or a loved one is considering suicide, please reach out. You are needed here and loved in ways you can't possibly imagine.
They wind up nixing doing actual work today since Cas is still recovering. They do get a timeline for their project, though: assuming Castiel gets better and Dean gets the cat situation under control, they will read through chapter 3 and meet back here next week. They make small talk for a while, where Cas finds out that Dean has been working at the Roadhouse for about a year, that he likes apple pie, and that he has many, many freckles.
Castiel chews on the idea until Jo turns into the trailer park. He coughs into his sleeve a few times.
He is awoken an hour or so later by his phone buzzing on the table. He shoots up; His mother doesn't text unless it's important.
He looks away, “You sound like my school counselor. Well, I'll tell you what I told him: there's no way I can afford to go to college right off, that's for sure. I'll probably go full-time at the Roadhouse, or Bobby's if Ellen won't let me. Otherwise, who knows.”
It's cool out, just the beginning of spring, but warm enough to be bearable when one moves around. Dean's shirt is stretched tight over his back, damp from exertion, and Castiel takes a moment to admire the way it clings to him. He stops digging a couple minutes later and leans on the handle of the shovel.
“Please?” He asks, “I heard there was some... interesting grafitti near the geriatric ward and I want to see it for myself.”
Cas sighs and drinks his coffee. “What do you do for Thanksgiving?” He asks, not wanting to talk about this any more.
No one is there. He blinks back tears. Idiot. Connard. Then he sees it. The vegetable plot is covered in a thick black mold. All the vegetables are dead.
They pause and Dean pushes Cas' chest back. He wriggles over to the passenger side, careful not to bump his head, and sits in Castiel's lap. He touches their foreheads together, going crosseyed.
She drives away and he goes inside. It's just a hair too cold considering the weather, and it sends a shiver up his spine.
"Um, Cas--" He starts, turning red. "I--" He swallows and tears his eyes away, and whatever he was going to say is lost. Instead he says, "Thanks for telling me."
The podium is miles away, but somehow he gets to it in the space of a few seconds. His hands shake as he takes out the paper.
“Right.” Cas confessed a couple days ago that he was surprised he hadn't needed a hospital stay in a few months, actually. Normally he would go every six and it's been about eight. Of course the universe decided to spite him for it, and he woke up unable to breath yesterday morning. Hence the car ride today. Dean slides into the passenger seat, feet resting on the backpack. Adra's car is small, and not as old as Dean's but only by a decade or two, but the pine air freshener can't cover up the smell of something gone bad and not completely cleaned out. Normally, it would bug the shit out of him, but now he's just grateful for the modicum of distraction it provides.
His eyes are puffy when he goes back to the viewing room to stand between Adra and the casket. She flashes a sad smile and squeezes his hand.
The trailers have turned on their outside lights by the time the two of them wander back to Dean's. They're a little ways away when Cas spots a small black car in the driveway and feels Dean freeze."What's wrong?"
Anna bites back a laugh, “Dude. This is the woman who raised Castiel, do you really think she'd have a problem with you?”
“Jesus,” Dean snorts, “Fine. Okay. Dad just, like, shut down. And I thought, like... if I could make it easier for him, for Dad I mean, then he would, you know, get better. So he could start being our dad again.”
He snaps a picture of Gabriel loafing on the back of the couch with Sam scratching him behind the ears.
When they get back upstairs, someone has started the music, something a little too loud with a repetitive electronic beat. Gabriel bids them adieu and shouts about setting up a beer pong table to one of the guys in the kitchen. Some enthusiastic whooping is involved.
Dean almost does a spit-take. "Fuck." He puts his water down and makes a cross with two slices of garlic bread, "Back, demon! Back!" Cas tears off a corner of garlic bread and tosses it across the table. Dean laughs.
“Dean-o!” Mr. Bradbury says, opening his arms wide. He has a long ginger beard that would reminded Dean of a dwarf if it weren't for how Mr. Bradbury towers over him. Dean lets himself be hugged tight and quick. “Good to see you, boy! How's Sam?”
Castiel laughs and shakes his head. "My mother asked me the same thing, too, once. No, Dean, I'm gay."
He hugs her one-armed. While he texts Ellen, she goes to the bathroom to wash up. Sam goes off to keep workign on dinner. On Jo's way back, Dean pulls her aside, “Hey, why don't we go for a drive? We can, uh...” He puts two fingers to his lips and pulls away.
Castiel shakes his head, “No. I think she worried I would not be able to keep up with the responsibility.”
After a few minutes of going the completely wrong direction, he finds her scowling near the Fairy Gate.
Dean leads Sam out to the car and nudges him into the back seat, where he curls up against the window.
Then the door snicks shut and he and Anna are left to their own devices. He tries not to make his sigh of relief too obvious.
Dean huffs a laugh, peering into the casket at the too-still-to-be-sleeping boy. Even in death, Castiel has managed to surprise him. 65 roses, huh? Imagine that.
Dean isn't sure if what comes out is a laugh or a sob. He touches the writing tenderly. Castiel was here. Castiel was here.
Captain Kirk is speaking to his friend Edith Keeler, a bleeding heart socialist running a flophouse in the 1920s. She is bright, and brilliant, and slated to die by the end of the episode. Captain Kirk is torn up by the revelation. Castiel doesn't blame him.
This isn't particularly worrying, someone is usually staring at him for one reason or another; it comes with the territory of looking like he does. At least, that's how Anna explained it to him back in the day, and he's found no fault in her logic yet.
He wakes again a few hours later, judging by how dark the room has gotten and how quiet it is out in the hall. It hurts to breathe, but the nose tube helps and he can get a few gulps in without coughing. Someone has left a book on his bedside table, along with a note.
He has an equally incomprehensible text from Dean at around 2:30 am, which if he had to guess was about the time he dropped him off.
Castiel shrugs, "I mean I've never had a cheese dog. You've never had boereg and that's a staple in my house."
"Dean, where the hell is --" John says, stopping when he looks over at them. He curls his hand around the package of coldcuts and lhe ooks Castiel up and down. "Oh, hello." He is polite, guarded.
"De l'eau, s'il vous plaît?" Castiel manages to ask his mother, making a drinking motion with his hand. He falls back onto the couch and props one leg up. Adra hands him a glass and he takes a long, slow drink and he feels it all the way down.
He slaps his chest with a flat hand and spits another wad into the sink. He takes slow, circular breaths: in, hold, out, in, hold, out, as many as he can. Eventually, his heart rate goes down.
He goes back to his dorm and straightens things up, then finishes his paper in the library. Anna is getting off work around the time he finishes, so he bikes over to her apartment and lets himself in. At the top of the stairs, though, he freezes, hearing voices.
He lifts up his pen and presses it to his teeth. He takes a deep breath in, hold, and out. Discomfort squirms in his chest and a couple monitors beep anxiously. He puts the pen back down.
“I don't know!” She snaps. She freezes, then softens, “Sorry. I don't know, Castiel.” She grimaces and reaches for him, tentative.
“Stupid son of a bitch,” He whispers. He opens the door and stumbles out, taking the empty wine bottle with him. He stares at it before throwing it to the ground, where it shatters. “You stupid son of a bitch!” He huffs, “People keep asking me what I want. Where am I going to college, what do I wanna do with my life. Man, the truth is, I just want you, Castiel, fuck the rest. I wanted you the rest of my damn life.”
He reaches out tentatively and puts a hand on Adra's shoulder. She turns to him and clings, gripping tight to his shoulder. It's not long for him to cling back, his own eyes welling with tears.
“No.” He glares and John frowns. “Please, with the way you've been treatin' him, he's more your solider than your son.”
They pack up. While Dean stretches, Castiel goes over and knocks on the library door. "Μαμά;" He asks, opening the door.
Instead of heading to Trig or Guitar, Dean convinces the three of them to shoot the shit under the bleachers, and when Mr. Fueler gets too close for comfort, they head over to the gas station. They get energy drinks and stale donuts and argue about whether a werewolf or a vampire would win in a fight until the store clerk asks them to leave. Dean almost forgets to be sad.
When they reach the other end of the neighborhood, Princess Leia stops and sniffs a tree for a full minute before squatting down to pee.
It's hot, so they toe off their shoes and rest their bikes up against a tree. Anna ties her hair up and Castiel pulls his up to stay off his neck. They have a silent conversation for a minute before stripping down to their underwear, or t-shirt and underwear in Anna's case. The cold water is refreshing, though Castiel has to grit his teeth to get more than ankle-deep. Anna has no such qualms and wades in up to her hips almost immediately, trailing her fingers over the top of the water. She has one ear cocked up, listening to the water and the birds and maybe something else distant that Castiel can't hear.
He scrambles off the couch, leaving his blankets in a heap. He throws the back doors open and sprints into the overcast afternoon. The stone pathway stings his bare feet with cold.
She peers out at the booth, where a scrawny kid in a trenchcoat is waiting. Right, Dean said Novak was coming by.
“Well, well, well,” Bela says in her poshest accent, “I didn't expect to see you here.” She smiles at him, not hungrily exactly, but like she'd enjoy actually eating him. Probably with a side of red wine.
"Yeesh, who died?" Ruby says, dropping napkins and paper straws on their table. Her hair is bright red, almost the same color as Charlie's.
Ash dings the bell and Dean goes to take the tray of drinks over to the group of giggling first years at Table 1. He's unfairly pretty, Jo's thinks. He knows it, too, which makes it even worse; He gives the ladies easy smiles and they all lose it, blushing and giggling to each other. No way at least two of them don't leave him their numbers by the end of the night. He's the Roadhead reigning champ for a reason, she supposes.
After getting through another twenty-page article, Castiel's eyes start to glaze over, so he closes his laptop and cracks his neck. Anna, completely lost in the music, takes a minute to realize he's staring at her. When she does, her eyes flutter open and she smiles at him.
“Okay, so, I haven't done this shit in years, so take the problem from the top and explain it to me.”
"The vegetables are rotten," He admits, his throat tight, "They've barely grown at all this year." He rubs his eyes as a couple tears leak out. "Merde."
Dean's shaking a little when they get back to the waiting area. The other family has gone, thankfully, but Dean keeps glancing at the door, expecting them to barge in any second. They don't, but just as they sit down, a woman in a long white coat comes in. She's tall with curly blonde hair. Adra seems to recognize her, and stands up. Dean follows.
John takes a long look from Dean to Bobby to the gun, does an about face, and marches off the property.
Dean sticks his head out the window while she's digging around for her keys. “Kick his ass, eh? Harvelle style.”
"He used to do this all the time as a kid," He whispers, "Put him in front of a movie and he'd knock out in twenty minutes." He chuckles and gestures to the TV, "I don't see what the big deal is. Prom? All these movies make it out to be the best night of your life, but if it's anything like homecoming it's just a bunch of kids in fancy outfits grinding on each other."
Dean doesn't know how much time passes, sitting in that waiting room. It doesn't really matter. A nurse will let them know when Castiel wakes up. Fuck. Adra has gone to get something from the vending machine, promising to bring him back a soda, and Dean stares at nothing while he waits. There are four empty water cups on the table, neatly stacked inside one another. It reminds him of those little Russian dolls; Castiel would probably know what they're called, but Dean can't for the life of him remember.
They fly passed the pet shop, the fire station, and are halfway to the middle school before Dean takes a sharp turn into the woods. Under the cover of the trees, he slows down to a normal speed as the road twists and twines.
“So I got the right answer, I just checked, but now I have to list out the steps on how I did it and I just don't know! I like, I just know the answer.”
“So this is Cas!” He says, opening his arms, “Nice to meet you, bud. I love the jacket.” Without warning, he puts his arm around Castiel. Gabe is a couple inches shorter than him, which is saying something.
“Can you help me decorate?” Sam asks. He kicks a cardboard box in their direction. Dean looks at Castiel and shrugs.
He grabs the fence and flings it into the ether. He rips the carrots out of the ground and breaks the beanstalks in half. What's the point? What's the putain de merde point? He tears into the dirt, clawing, digging, flinging it all around him.
Reluctantly, Dean turns the water off and grabs a towel. The things he does for Cas, seriously, “You're such a baby.”
“Oh absolutely. I mean, Spock is his number one for a reason.” He has some fanfiction saved on his computer that thinks so, anyway.
He surveys: a ball of pressure is sitting behind his ribs, pushing its feet against his sternum. His throat is dry, and his hands are cold. “Better.”
"Hey, Castiel," He raises his eyebrows as he punches in the order, "Really? It's not even midterms."
Castiel looks back and gives him a sympathetic grimace. He had been almost as hard to wake as Sam, apparently, and Sam got a rare look at his morning routine in the kitchen, pills, inhalers, and a big machine vest thing all lined up on the table. Cas was half-asleep going through it, but apparently he's had enough practice he can do it all with ease.
“Fuck,” He says, throwing himself into a chair, “Who knew funerals would be this fucking exhausting?”
He sits up, which takes some of the pressure of his chest. Moonlight spills into his room through the open curtains: long, rectangular stretches of light. He takes a moment to appreciate the stillness. He takes a series of deep, slow breaths, in, hold, out, until the fullness in his chest wanes just a little. After removing all the tissues from his bedside table by jumping them onto the floor, he discovers that his inhaler is nowhere to be found.
"Um," He stutters, suddenly nervous. She watches him with the even, nonjudgemental concern she always has. In an instant, he's sixteen again with her hands on his shoulders, pushing him gently towards the casket Anna sleeps in. He's eleven, watching in awe as she explains the story behind every painting in the exhibit: the artist's life, the type of paint they used and how they mixed it, and how this piece fits into the themes of the rest of their work.
They make it to Talbot's Landing seventeen minutes after Adra's call. They burst in and Adra is there, clutching her son's hand. Castiel's chests rises and falls, even, mechanical. He has a breathing tube in, and a nurse is writing some notes on the whiteboard behind him. He cracks his eyes open when he hears them come in. His heart monitor picks up a little when his gaze lands on Dean.
“Adra, my dear,” She says. She's a stout woman with thick grey curls and dark brown skin. She hugs Adra and then turns her gaze on Dean, who feels somehow like she knows everything about him. “Who's this?”
"Is there more?" Dean leans closer. Castiel nods and digs out a couple envelopes and an old flip phone.
Castiel kneels down, careful to keep the cabbage in the ground as he inspects it. The plant is pale purple, bumpy, and roughly the size of his palm. He sighs.
"What in Sam Hill is going on here?" Bobby asks, coming over to where the boys are standing in front of the fridge and motioning them aside so he can get through.
Dean drives, blasting music the whole way. Charlie practices her Serious Princessing Face in the mirror. Every so often they'll look at each other and erupt into giggles.
The next performer goes, and then it's Jo's turn. She comes out in concert black, her hair gently curled and half of it clipped back. She's totally alone on stage, the lights hiding everything except her and the piano. She unfolds her songbook and cracks her knuckles. Then, she plays. It starts slow, a soft little melody that climbs from one side of the keys to the other, spring waking after winter. Then it explodes, fast, harsh notes, fireworks, canons, couples dancing across a ballroom floor cut with scenes of war.
"Uhh, lemme see." Cas hands it to him. Oh yeah. It's Castiel right after he finished burning a grilled cheese. He's laughing to himself as he scrapes the black lump into the trash, completely unaware the photo's being taken. "Maybe a month ago? Sorry. I just thought it looked nice."
He swallows. "Let's uh...” He gestures to Castiel's tie, “Take that off? He'll ask questions. Um, we can help Sam clean up and then we can go for a drive?"
“I never had these growing up,” Adra says, gesturing to one of the snacks, a very flat, very large cinnamon bun, “My parents made me dinner at home every night, so I never had the opportunity. After I had Castiel though, well, we would be in and out of here every six months, and eventually my hunger won out. This one was my favorite.” She takes a bite, shaking her head, “God, it's horrible.”
Anna tosses pebbles into the rushing river and Castiel braids a long piece of grass. He hums something tuneless when the cold touch of the drying water on his skin gets too much, and Anna bobs her head along.
They mouth at each other for a few minutes while they recover. Eventually, Cas catches his breath enough to lean over and clean them both off with a t-shirt. He reaches a cold foot out and wraps it around Dean's ankle, laughing when Dean makes a face. He coughs. He's exhausted, but he's alive, awake, his whole body thrumming where they touch. He traces patterns onto Dean's back, over his shoulderblades. "Love you," He murmurs. It sits warmly in his chest, beating like his heart. Dean, Dean, Dean.
Smoking outside a middle school is probably not grounds for arrest, but it certainly feels that way. Dean takes quick puffs of his cancer stick, trying to savor the hot, bitter taste in his mouth while training his eyes on the door. When Sam comes out, arm-in-arm with a tall blonde girl, he drops the cigarette and grinds it out with his heel.
He waves them off and goes inside, where warmth surrounds him immediately. He follows the kitchen light like a moth to flame and slings his backpack onto the tall chair at the island. Adra is dressed for work, stirring pasta over the stove.
Sam takes a deep breath and does. A couple times, Dean stops him to explain a formula or why something is a given, and Sam backtracks and explains it. After a minute or two, Dean nods.
Dean picks up one of the figurines on his desk and bobs its paw, then he studies the charcoal drawing taped to the wall.
He bites his lip, rocking back on his feet a little. A clink from the kitchen tells them that Sam is still nearby. "Wanna, uh, go for a walk?"
But Castiel-- attractive? He's easy on the eyes, yeah. He's got a nice jawline, and his blue hair is kinda hot, and the way he he purses his lips when he's concentrating has distracted Dean on more than one occasion. His lips are distracting in general; He's got a perfect cupid's bow that's never chapped, even in the middle of winter, which means they'd be soft if Dean kissed him.
“Dean,” Castiel says, because it's the only thing to say. In slow motion, Dean puts a hand out and hovers it above Castiel's chest. Cas reaches up and finishes the job so Dean's hand is pressed against his heart. He musters up the control to breathe in, hold, out, and Dean blinks rapidly a few times.
Dean raises his eyebrows. 'Familiar' is an understatement – he was just texting Charlie the other day with a hefty analysis of the Kirk-v-Gorn fight scene.
He shows them into the parlor. The left side of the building has bathroom and a small back room with a long table where the family can come and get away for a while. It has a big oak table in the middle. The other side of the building is blocked off by a pair of French doors. An attendant opens them. Adra hesitates on Dean's arm before stepping through.
Castiel perks up, “Oh, yes. We used to go to the same church. He was one of the first disabled people I ever met.”
“Ellen!” He says, and goes to hug her. She's dressed well too, and Sam is jealous of her flannel tucked into dark-wash jeans.
The chapel is across the hospital and down a few levels, so they get there by the time the meeting is letting out. A few folks mill around, some of them pour coffee or have a donut, but when Adra makes herself known, Missouri politely shoos them out.
Oh, this piques Cas' interest, “Do you know anyone who's interested in directing? We do a production of Rocky Horror every year and we have yet to find someone.”
Later, Charlie says, "Legally, I think we require compensation in the form of ice cream. For our troubles."
“Sam,” Adra says, putting her large purse down on the chair and taking out her wallet, “Why don't I show you around? I can get you something from the gift shop.”
She shrugs, “Not for me. I had books, and I had Castiel; that was all I needed. But I do wonder if it ever got to him.”
Dean pulls over and puts his hazards on. He sighs, wishing he had a joint between his lips. His hands are shaking. "Fuck," He whispers, "Shit."
Castiel takes a breath, in, hold, and out. Riding a surge of bravery, he swoops down and pulls a cardboard box labelled "Castiel's Catacombs" out from under his bed. He gestures for Dean to have a seat, and he sits cross-legged across from him. In between them is the phrase 'Castiel was here' scratched into the floor.
Anna chews this over for a second, “Huh. Cool.” She looks off into middle distance for a few moments before adding, “The universe must be trying to tell you something.”
“Oh yeah, sure,” Dean says. He licks his lips. It's a cool summer day out, and the window is open, letting a breeze and the gentle floral scents of the garden waft in. “I've been thinking about that, too, actually.”
Dean looks at him a moment before grinning, "Yeah, yeah. Anyway, here's your heart attack in a cup."
Jess beams at Dean, her hair a big golden halo in the doorway. She and Sam hug, and Sam kisses her cheek. Dean makes a gagging sound. Jess laughs. When she leaves, Sam trots over to the kitchen.
“No, it isn't,” Adra agrees. “But I guarantee you made her life more bearable by being in it, Castiel.”
Castiel's heart beats faster the smaller his sandwich becomes. When he's done, he leaves his plate in the sink and stares at it, his heart stuck in his throat.
She seems satisfied with this and nods. "Castiel?" She gestures. He has no choice; He takes them and tucks them into his coat pocket. His mother beams and he tries to not look mortified. She squeezes his shoulder. "Have fun!"
He shakes his head, “Me neither. Imagine my surprise when on my birthday, Jo pulls out an envelope full of cash they'd all been saving for the last three months. Those bastards.” His grin could split his face in half.
Dinner is good, it's a warm noodle stir fry with peanut sauce. Castiel takes his usual place on the couch and Anna sits on the other side, in front of the checker board.
It's morning when he wakes again. His head doesn't hurt any more, which is a small miracle. Adra is gone, but her jacket is hung over the back of the chair. He flicks his overhead light on, a tiny sun in his otherwise dark, medical universe. His journal is sitting on the table, along with a blue pen. He takes a deep breath and cracks it to the latest entry.
This is incredible. Fuck. Dean couldn't have these kinds of conversations with Lisa or Carmen. Castiel's something special, that's for sure. Dean can't believe it sometimes. Someone who can name all the emperors of Ancient Rome in order as well as their major accomplishments will also sit and watch Star Trek with him for hours, totally enraptured. He's so fucking
He looks at Dean heavy-lidded, and Dean feels all the world like Castiel is flirting with him. But he couldn't be, right? Its Dean's own crush making him read into things.
Castiel looks away. Dean doesn't get it. Cas has to do it himself, he has to. If he doesn't, she'll-- Oh.
Mr. B makes them veggie omelettes and Dean has his with extra bacon. After that, Dean showers and uses Charlie's nice-smelling body wash. He belts Asia until she bangs on the door to tell him to shut up. He laughs.
It takes them a minute, switching directions a couple times while Dean steps on Cas' toes, but they get into a rhythm. They bump chests. Castiel counts, one two three, one two three, one two three. The moment Dean stops looking down at their feet, his eyes snap to Castiel's. They are bright blue and he's pressed his brows into a solid line, concentrating. One two, three, one two three, one--
“Um,” Castiel says as he stirs his drink, “I guess it's just a form of self-expression I've always gravitated towards. I like the music, and it tells the world I don't believe in their authority.”
"That's exactly it! And the whole point of that scene is that he's like, not able to feel emotions for women." Dean grins and Castiel nods thoughtfully.
Dean wheels around. He can't see Mr B any more, but after a second Charlie passes by and gives him a wave. He swallows. His chest falls. "I-- No, I guess not."
“Hm?” Dean grunts, looking up from his phone, “Oh.” Embarrassed, he crouches down beside Cas. The cat goes over and rubs his face on Dean's shoe.
Castiel's knees crack as he stands up. Jo laughs and calls him an old man. “Thank you. Besides, it's not safe out here for young women at night.”
He pauses. A truck rattles by somewhere behind them. “I want...” He drops his voice to a whisper, like he's afraid of being overheard, “I wanna keep it.”
"Hi," Dean says around a smile, his hands in his pockets. He has a black jacket on with a ton of zippers in odd places.
He looks off to the side, “Ah, he was a military guy, you know? He said 'jump' and we said 'how high', you know?”
He grimaces, "Sorry." He runs his fingers through his hair, which sticks up at odd angles no matter what he does to it. The dye is fresh enough to leave blue stains on his fingers.
Once she leaves, she sneaks into the kitchen to wash her hands in the big sink. Ash is flipping a row of burgers and sup nods at her.
He tries not to think about Dean watching him as he takes a puff, or Dean standing close behind him while he coughs another mouthful of mucus up.
“That's what I like to hear,” She says, tugging his blanket down a little to give him some breathing room. As she's flipping on his desk fan, she asks, “Are you up for eating, or do I need to make a Scandishake?”
There's a lull in the conversation while they all dig into the collective lunch. While he chews on a chicken wing, Dean taps Cas-tee-el's number into his phone. As he's typing, a call springs up.
John knocks a pile over, scattering the pages everywhere, "Now look what you did. I knew where everything was before."
Sam's eyes go wide and he ducks behind Bobby's laptop screen, "No, no, I'm staying out of this one."
Talbot's Landing is the same endless, perma-flourescent hallway as any other floor of any other hospital. The only difference is ithat this one is as familiar to Castiel as his own home: there's a water stain they haven't managed to get out yet outside the women's restroom that Castiel thinks looks like a mother and child, but Meg thinks it looks like a monster with it's mouth wide open. They've had this argument many times, and they have it again now, but half-heartedly as Castiel's breath is coming in gasps and wheezes.
She pauses, looking down at the podium. She is quiet for a moment, and when she speaks again her voice cracks. “Um. Novak – Castiel. Castiel was...A great guy. He was... He became a brother to me. It took us what, two weeks to invite him to our monthly family dinners? Like he belonged there.
“How are your midterms?” His mother asks through a bite of boereg. They're sitting across one another in her office. The tiny window is almost entirely blocked out by books and stacks of papers lining the walls. Indeed, she even has one book cracked open on her desk that she was taking notes in when he got there.
"Wanna tell me what that was about?" Charlie asks, her hands on her hips. Dean swallows, heat creeping up his neck.
The rain is letting up by the time he pulls into Castiel's driveway. He rushes to the door anyway. Sam goes around to the front seat once he leaves, and Dean stalls in the driveway until Castiel actually opens the front door.
“He wanted to apologize for walking out,” Jo says finally. Her hand starts shaking and she puts the glass down, “Like – just, he wanted us to be a family again. Like he deserves it after what he put us through.”
He does. It takes a few tries, until Sam almost nearly pushes Castiel over and he jerks awake, coughing.
“Yeah, we can do that.” He gets out the potatoes, a cutting board, and a large knife.  “Y'hear from Cas yet?” He asks while facing away.
Dean snaps, "Oh! Duh! Right, I shoulda known, sorry." He does a cursory glance down Castiel's front, eyes flickering between a couple points before going back to Cas' face. "Um, how is she?"
She would smile back and look away, a little sad, “Any time.” She would go over to the window and peer out, her face reflecting double in the glass, though she wouldn't be able to see it up close, “Y'know, I used to love people-watching.” She would say, “I wasn't allowed outside by myself when I was here, so I would sit by the window for hours just... watching the world go by. There were a lot of old people. I tried to imagine how it would feel to get so old. To just wake up every day and have a new ache or pain. It just made me sad. It sounded horrible, really.”
Dean hesitates. “Right, sure.” He gets a stack of paper out of his bag, followed by a torn up Frankenstein and a pack of gum. “Want one?”
Dean swallows the pain and says, “What a venue, huh? At least they could serve beer instead of these shitty half-water bottles.”
A few feet away a crowbar rests on the ground. He picks it up and holds it in both hands. The hood of the Impala is smooth, glittering in the late afternoon light. He lifts his arms up and swings down, swings down, swings down.
Gilda managed to dive behind a tree to avoid getting hit. When the slew of arrows stops, she creeps out and drags Dean back with her.
“Sorry,” Dean says to her. He leans towards Castiel and drops his voice, “Dude. Holy shit. How do you know that?”
“Um, a cat's penis is sharply barbed along it's shaft. I am fairly sure the females were not consulted about this.”
At 11:00, they make their way down to the cafeteria because Bobby insists they need to eat something, damn it. Dean gets exactly that: something, shaped sort of like a bacon cheeseburger. He doesn't taste it before swallowing. Bobby watches him while picking at his own soggy french fries. Sam downs chocolate milk after chocolate milk. They don't talk about anything.
He feels sick the whole time he drives Sam to school. It gets worse the more he drives. Jesus shit, not even the smooth rumbles of his '67 Chevy Impala makes him feel better.
Once the pie is delivered, she squeezes Castiel's elbow, wishes him good night, and leaves. He watches her march down to the car. She smiles at him before she drives off, although it comes off more like a grimace.
There's a knock on her door for her next appointment, so Castiel gets up. Adra tells him to tell Anna to stop by sometime. He agrees.
Charlie sends a photo of the folding table in the kitchen covered in plates and plates of magnificent Thanksgiving food: fresh rolls, sweet potatoes covered in marshmallow, green bean casserole, homemade cranberry sauce, and mountains and mountains of steaming hot turkey. Dean's mouth waters.
Castiel stands and brushes the dirt off his knees. He makes his way over to the fountain as he talks.
"Have you considered that John wouldn't do that because he's un connard? It's no wonder you're uncomfortable when someone shows you real human kindness."
“Hey uh. You think we could invite Castiel sometime?” He asks after a few minutes, his heart speeding up.
She comes close a little easier, with more open curiosity. She touches the bedside table, picks up a book and skims the back, “I think Mom read this one.”
He rolls his eyes, “I have had my fill of hospital food, Dean, I don't want to willingly subject myself to more.”
Jo emerges a few minutes later, back in jeans with her concert dress slung over her shoulder. Dean hands her the daffodils and points in Sam and Cas' direction. She trots over, her brow furrowed. Sam nudges Cas, who flickers his eyes open. She crouches down.
Whatever's inside isn't wrapped, just covered in a sheet of old newspaper. Castiel shakes out the bag, and into his lap falls a small black journal and a couple blue pens. A few photos fall out as well. Castiel inspects each one: Dean sitting on the bench outside the Roadhouse, his arm around Sam. The high school friend group a couple weeks ago – Dean, Castiel, Jo, and Ash, all squished onto the dirty green couch in Ash's basement. A bong is visible in the background, next to an open package of edibles. The last photo is Dean and Castiel from the same night, smiling together. Castiel's face is flushed. Something went wrong with the camera so it looks like there are several sets of Dean and Cas all lined up on top of one another. Castiel is going to keep that one somewhere very special.
Adra nods, looking out the back door. Outside, Dean waves. "Good, good. Did you figure out what's wrong with the hydrangeas?"
He collapses back on his pillow leaving the cup of yuck on the side table, “We will have to file a complaint.”
Dean drives a boxy old car, and apparently hates it when anyone talks badly about her. Castiel discovers this when the Impala takes a minute to start, and Dean leans over and whispers sweet nothings into the steering wheel.
He lingers for a moment, breathing the recycled air. He goes eventually, his hand lingering on the doorframe on the way out.
He nods, "Cool, cool. My brother's girlfriend is big into art. She likes Monet? Manet? One of those. Anyway, Charlie's said good things about you."
"Its fucking disgusting how you do that," Dean grimaces, wiping up the drink rings on the table because no one knows how to use fucking coaster.
Castiel dares looks now, into the green pit of his eyes. His lip quivers. It's not fair. "I-- Dean, I can't -- I can't--"
Castiel awakes with a shooting pain in his throat. Merde. He coughs and coughs, his mouth filling with mucus. The pain doesn't go away. He spits into tissue and adds it to the disgustingly large pile on his bedside table. Only when he manages to take a long drink of tepid water does the pain subside.
He guns it. His hands shake while parking the car and Ellen tells them to just get inside, she'll worry about the parking tickets. He's never loved her more than in that moment.
Castiel makes everyone eggs when he wakes up. Ruby takes her plate into her room, so Cas and Anna are left by themselves again. Anna has Saturdays off, thankfully, so while Cas works on his essay, she pulls out a painting she's been working on and they sit in companionable silence, backdropped by some rusty rock band she's insisted on getting into.
He squints at it for a long moment before giving up and pushing the call nurse button. A nurse who is not Meg comes by and reads the note for him. It's from his mother, saying she and Dean came by, that they are missing him dearly, and that they'll be back in in the morning. Castiel thanks the nurse and holds the note close to his heart.
"Right. My point is, I don't think he's going anywhere. But don't take my word for it, you should ask him."
Gabriel waves him off. Castiel must look slightly terrified, because he barks a laugh, “Don't worry, I don't bite. Unless you're into that sort of thing, then I could probably be persuaded.”
The chair Dean chooses is understuffed and too close to the ground. It's a relief that the doctor and Adra are no better off, crammed into tiny chairs themselves. It's hard to be dignified when your knees are crushed against your chest, but by God do they try. Dr. Marilyn sits across from him, the coffee table in between, and folds her hands in front of her. She's wearing a wedding ring.
John's eyes turn steely, and Dean freezes. "I don't like your tone, young man,” He grunts. Shame wells up and Dean stares at the table. "I gave you an order.”
The river is a couple miles west of town and cold no matter the time of year. It's far enough away from the city that the sound pollution hasn't hit it yet; the burbling of the river is the loudest thing for a mile. In late summer, the closer one gets to the edge of the water the greener the shrubbery becomes. The water reflects and refracts the brilliant, hot sunlight, bright enough that Castiel has to squint if he wants to look directly at it.
“Um, Anna was actually... thinking of staying in the apartment with Ruby. Apparently Ruby doesn't have much family in the area.”
Dean moves Alfie's items to the side, scooting closer to Castiel. Cas' breath catches in his throat.
“No dice yet on getting you that spare key,” she says, pushing the vegetables – an assortment of frozen ones and fresh bell pepper– over to one side of the pan and spooning in a glob of sauce.
Back at the table, Dean leans over to Castiel and whispers, “Don't tell my dad, but I haven't been doing my homework 'cause Sam let a stray cat in last week, and we've been trying to take care of it while also hiding it from him.”
“Be right there!” He calls back. It's not technically a crime to be up this early, but Dean thinks it oughta be.
“I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this!” Anna is saying from the couch, her arms folded across her chest.
He lies back. He closes his eyes and watches the lights burst behind his eyelids. Dean's warm hands leave him for a minute, and when they come back they come around the back of Castiel's head, lifting it up. Oh, a pillow. He melts into it.
"I'll lead," Castiel says. Dean nods. Cas positions Dean's hands, one on Cas' shoulder and one in his outstretched hand. His own free hand he puts on Dean's waist. His fingers are cool, heat leeching out through Dean's t-shirt. If they get any closer, Cas will be able to feel Dean's heart pounding in his ribs.
“Oh really? That's cool. He's a friend of the family. We call him Uncle Bobby, actually,” Dean says. He glances over again and smiles. “Oh, uh, he says hi.”
He eyes him. Castiel coughs. Something softens in Bobby's face and he smiles a little, "Those old church ladies don't know when to quit, do they?"
They unpack Dean's armor and set it out on Charlie's desk, play a round a Bad Fic Bingo, and shoot as many eye-roll-inducing puns back and forth as they can before Mrs. B calls them down for dinner. Dean's stomach growls on the way down, loud enough that Princess Leia stares at him, tilting her head.
"Your food'll be out soon," She promises, rapping her knuckles against the table, and leaves. Table 8 needs napkins and Table 2 needs straws and someone just sat down at Table 10, so Jo barely has time to breathe before she brings Novak his desserts. One slice of apple pie, one cherry, one blueberry, funfetti cake, chocolate cake, two kinds of cookies, and a pudding. Jo's stomach turns thinking about it, but Novak just looks it over neutrally.
Anna glances back at Ruby and sighs. Ruby stares at the two of them, then huffs and goes off to her room.
He opens another message and stares at his phone. He and Castiel have been getting along lately, Dean would even say they've become friends. Castiel is weird, no denying that: he wears a trenchcoat every day and just last week he needed Dean to explain to him what Star Wars was. Seriously, Star Wars. But, he's cool, too: he's is wicked knowledgeable about the most random stuff, like ancient Roman history and gardening. His sense of humor is hard to see at first, too, but when Dean gets it, it leaves him in stitches.
He makes a noise one last time, and hopes it sounds like Thank you, Dean, before promptly passing out.
is gone. His stiff, perfect posture. The way he tilts his head when he's confused. His righteous, powerful anger. It's gone. It's all gone. Castiel is dead.
Dean's brain short-circuit when he realizes he's standing in front of his boyfriend wearing nothing but a towel. He grins and Castiel glares.
Dean comes back to life in inches. He has good days: he eats breakfast, he goes to Adra's to help pack up Castiel's things, he falls asleep at a normal time. He has bad days: he collapses on the couch in the morning and doesn't get up until dinner, he catches a whiff of cinnamon in the spice cabinet and has to run into the other room, he sees a package of cheese dogs at the grocery store and breaks down right there in the meat aisle. He doesn't even care enough to be embarrassed about it. Good grief.
“Damn it, Cas. I loved you, you know that?” He hits the tire, “I really fucking did!” He gets the hood again. “You – you bastard! You son of a bitch!”
After they've been sitting for a minute, Dean bites his lip and says, “So, what's with the whole... Siouxie Sioiux cosplay?”
Ellen looks at him a moment and shrugs, “Well, if that's how you wanna spend your summer break I guess I can't stop you.”
At the end of the day, Dean spends fifteen minutes after class trying to get his Chemistry teacher to explain the different properties of an atom. Eventually, the balding man looks at him pointedly and asks if there's somewhere else he needs to be. Annoyed that he got caught, he huffs and heads out.
He spins around to find Kevin rushing over, lugging a cello case as big as he is. They hug, Kevin breathing hard.
A smile spreads slowly across her face, as if she's forgotten how and the muscles need reminding, "Yes, Castiel, I'd love to."
Dean flips his phone over and squeezes his eyes shut. Damn it! Castiel is his friend! His good friend! Sure, Dean wants to hang out with him all the time, that's what friends do. And he's done a literal spit-take because of Cas -- more than once! -- but that's because the guy is fucking hilarious when he's not even trying. And... the way Cas listens to him talk with his full attention, like he really thinks Dean is worth listening to, makes Dean share like they've known each other for years. In fact, he's pretty sure Castiel knows more shit about how he and Sam grew up than Jo, and she was there for a lot of it.
"Right, that's fine then. Hey, listen, I've gotta drop something off at Singer's Auto before it closes, are you guys good by yourselves for an hour?"
It's disconcerting. First, there's a long wooden box surrounded by flowers. Then, there's Castiel, lying still. He's got rosy cheeks and his face is calm, not pinched tight with pain. His tie is flipped the wrong way around, and Dean goes to flip it back around. It's disconcerting the way he could be sleeping. But...
Castiel shuffles out of bed and across the floor. It feels like more effort than he can muster to untangle the rope ladder, so he just opens the latch and drops himself down through the trapdoor. He lands with a thud and winces. It shakes another cough loose.
In the middle of the meal, Cas' alarm goes off for his antibiotic, and Dean shows him to the bathroom.
Bobby grunts. He studies the potatoes for a second before holding one out. “You wanna wash these for me and I can get to choppin'?”
Ah, the trailer park. Before he can say anything about it, Sam bounces up to them with a dozen books in his arms.
“Nope. There is historical evidence that suggests Thanksgiving specifically commemorates the murder of seven hundred members of the Pequot tribe.”
There is some Greek in this chapter! You should be able to hover over each bit to get a translation. Also if said Greek is wrong at all, please let me know!
Out of the darkness, a pair of green eyes flash. Castiel stares out, trying to see movement. After a minute, the eyes show again, closer this time. He reaches out a hand and snaps his fingers. The shape creeps closer. A cat, tawny brown, with the whiskers on one side of it's face cut short, from an accident or a fight or a fire he isn't sure. As it gets closer, it chitters at him.
Novak stares at her. She tosses him a wet rag and points to the booths by the window. He coughs a few times while cleaning, but he rolls up his trenchcoat sleeves and washes tables like he was born to do it. Huh. Dean mentioned something after he met up with him the first time, he thinks the kid has bad lungs. Poor guy.
He can hear his mother moving around her bedroom. In his reflection, Castiel can see her deep-set blue eyes and square jaw.
They wind up getting into an argument about who would win in a fight, a vampire or a werewolf, before it veers off into philosophy: what makes a monster a monster, do monsters have to follow the rules set by their legends or is it a carefully curated image? Castiel insists on the former, Dean the latter.
Sam fidgets, his teeth worrying his bottom lip. Oh, great. Castiel closes his eyes to avoid rolling them, “How are you, Sam?”
She'll go over and pluck a couple up, cradling them in her slender hands, “Baby's breath, interesting choice.”
He sighs, “I mean, my original plan was to look after Sammy, but now that we're living at Bobby's, it's kind of a moot point, ya know?”
Castiel sits up, moving his feet to the side of Dean's leg. He glances over but doesn't say anything. The light from the TV flickers off the side of his face. Dean makes wry comments about the movie every so often, and Castiel listens. It's nice, easy.
She smiles at him and he can't help but hug her. She is lanky, and she smells of warm cinnamon. He begins to shake a little, his eyes watering. She holds him tight, not letting go.
“Um,” He says again. He gestures down to his bed, where The Vest is waiting for him. The part that wraps around his chest is large and blue, soft with wear, with thick black tubes connecting it to a white machine roughly the size and shape of a toaster. Castiel runs his hands over it's familiar wrinkles, “Should I bring it?”
The roses are on a fast-track to full bloom, and the shrubbery is as hearty as ever. He wipes muck off the fountain, pulling wet, rotten leaves out of the water and tossing them on the compost. Merde, he's going to have to turn it soon; Maybe this weekend, provided he has the strength. He wishes she were here to help. He wishes for – Well. He wishes.
Castiel shrugs with his whole body as if to say, what are you gonna do about it? and even Bobby snorts.
Dean takes a cigarette from behind his ear and puts it between his lips. He taps his pockets and makes a face, “Damn.”
“So, I'll cut to the chase. Castiel's lung function is deteriorating fast. We can keep him stable while he's here, but we are recommending he undergo a double lung transplant surgery. Now, other than a slight arrhythmia his organs are very strong, which makes him a good candidate for the surgery.”
After dinner, Princess Leia scratches at the door to be let out, so Charlie volunteers her and Dean to take her on a walk. The Bradbury's live in a real neighborhood with enormous two-story houses and street lights. Unlike home, where there are mountains of snow all piled up on every corner, San Antonio has clear streets without a flake of snow in sight, even if some of the houses still have their Christmas lights on. It's a little cool out, but in a refreshing way, not nippy.
There's a lull in conversation and Dean gets up and goes to search for the lint roller. He's digging through the closet in the front room when Castiel says:
Castiel flops forward, landing face-down on the pillow. Dean laughs and rubs a hand up and down his back.
He whispers questions to Balthazar and learns that his heart almost gave out. The doctors were surprised but the nurses weren't, they think it's a side-effect of the medications he's on, or a combination of side-effects. Still, that he collapsed so quickly after getting out of bed has him labelled a fall risk. Meg wasn't lying when she said he'd be stuck in bed for a week – he has to call a nurse now every time he wants do so much as get up to pee. Great.
This room is larger, with little end tables on either side stacked with tissue boxes and little water bottles. There are rows of chairs, and beside each are a couple boards full of photos. He and Adra had spent hours sifting through them picking out the good ones. At the front of the room are bushels of roses framing a long wooden box.
While Castiel is formulating his reply, the waitress comes by and hands them their coffee. Cas immediately starts dumping sugar packets into his, while Dean just blows on his and takes a sip.
Dean stifles a laugh into his fist, and Cas is struck with a sudden, sharp desire to know what he would look like stifling another sound like that. He tries not to let it show.
He finds Sam over in the corner and the three of them head out. Dean pulls into the Singer's Auto Salvage and parks. It's warm enough that he doesn't need to keep the engine on, he just rolls down the window and lets the summer heat climb in. Jo snuck a bottle of wine into her purse and she pulls it out. It's not a twist-off, so they spend a few minutes jamming it with their car keys before Sam rolls his eyes and goes back into the house for a corkscrew.
The theater lights blink once, twice, and everyone falls into a hush. A middle-aged man comes up to the podium and introduces himself as the director, and talks for a while about how proud he is of all the work the performers put in. He thanks the school for letting them use the space, and thanks a few more people before leaving. The lights go down for good and Sam settles in.
They get the gravy cleaned up with help from Gabe, who meows and saunters off into Sam's room. After that, the boys get started on dinner. Well, Dean tries to get started, but Sam yells at him and says potatoes need to be microwaved before you can mash them, and promptly banishes him from the kitchen.
They pick a row near the middle, so they can see the performers, but not so close they have to crane their necks. Castiel sits on the outside, in case he has to rush out for coughing. He and Dean don't hold hands, exactly, but Dean holds an arm out and Cas takes it like they're a couple from Pride and Prejudice.
There is some shuffling behind the door, and some swearing, but after a few beats, Dean yanks open the Alpha house door and fixes Cas with a warm smile.
“They are.” She swallows and looks at him with a glint in her eyes, “Hey, you wanna get outta here?”
Dean chuckles, "Jess is making Sammy watch Twilight, so he's making me watch it, so I'm making you watch it."
She makes a thoughtful noise. “It would be a reliable future, everyone has a car and all cars need repaired at some point.”
“Yeah. Just thought I'd let you know. I'm making him shower and drink two bottles of water before I send 'im home.”
John spins around and pops his beer open with one hand, "The bitch thinks I've called out too many times. If you call for me she'll believe it."
In the coming weeks, they will make room for the summer vegetables, sweep up the petals from the weeping cherry, and sort through all the tools in the shed. Adra will have a memorial stone made for the entranceway, with Castiel's name, birth and death days, and a quote about the Garden of Eden. It will sit next to the one inscribed
“There's seven of us at least, and everyone has to say their piece.” He rolls his eyes, but not in a mean way.
"Go put that in the cellar." He jerks a thumb towards the bottle of wine. Well, Dean knows a dismissal when he hears it. He takes the wine and shuts the door behind him. Everyone looks up when he comes in. Jo is perched on the arm of the couch, Ellen beside her. Sam and Jess are sitting in chairs across from them, and Ash is cross-legged on the floor.
“Uh, merry early Christmas, dude. You can leave your bags in there,” He points to the door behind Castiel. “What kinda pie is it?”
“Good. Can you scooch over?” He gestures to Castiel's feet. It takes him a moment but he lifts his legs up and Dean shoves himself underneath them. Gingerly, Castiel puts his feet down on top of one of Dean's legs. Dean glances at him, lips quirking upward.
He brings in the rest of Gabriel's supplies, including all the stupid little toys Sam bought with his allowance money. Of course, Gabriel would rather play with the strings on the end of Adra's sweatshirt, but then, that's just how cats are.
Once they finish their dinner, Dean asks if he wants to keep watching Star Trek: The Original Series.
They drive in silence for a few minutes, until they pull up to a stop sign. As Dean swings a right, he says, “Me ’n Sam don’t celebrate it most of the time.”
“Damn right, fuck,” Bobby grunts. He tosses the gun on the table and frowns at Dean. He clenches his fist on the arm of his chair, “Y'alright, son?”
He looks to the other family, their heads together, talking quietly. Electricity hums through the fluorescent lights and the water cooler in the corner gives the occasional gurgle. The near-silence is suffocating.
Outside is cold and dark. Dean drinks in the nippy air like he's drowning. He practically runs down the driveway to where his baby is parked on the street.
Looking into her sky-blue eyes, he realizes with the sudden ferocity of a summer storm that this is his mother, the only person who has known him his entire life, and this was the first real conversation they have had in years.
It doesn't take long for the sadness to be put on a back burner. They kiss for a while, Castiel crawling forward and laying across Dean, who wraps his arms around his back and holds tight. At one point, Castiel braces his arms on either side of him and Dean looks up at him, full of wonder. Castiel leans down at the same time Dean leans up and they kiss.
He hesitates before settling on, “Um. I have been slacking on my Greek, can we practice on the way?”
Dean doesn't realize how badly he's shaking until the door swings closed and Bobby turns to face him.
"Yes. I can do so much, and one day I might be yanked across the universe and I have no control over where I land."
Everyone claps politely and Jo rushes back to her seat. Ellen wraps her arms around her, holding her close.
He stays for tea, and he helps her sort through the basket of medicine in the cabinet and they wind up throwing out most of it.
Charlie helps him lug his stuff up to her room. She still has a bunk bed, although the bottom bunk has been removed so it's really just a loft. Her room is bright in a literal sense: the walls are a creamy yellow and she's hung string lights up all around where the wall meets the ceiling. She has fewer decorations than Dean, but enough that anyone could reasonably guess her book taste, favorite Buffy character, and sexuality when they walk in. There's soft indie music playing at a low volume.
