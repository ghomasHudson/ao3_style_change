“Ah - just checking. On you. Dean."
But it doesn’t exactly come out like that - it comes out as more of a rush of words that are cracking apart.

“The cedars of Lebanon…” He says softly and travels up to his thigh, hairs tickling at his cheek. “…okavango delta…”
ones, Cas had already made sure of that) and some kind of sports coat thing Sam got him last year for his birthday just for things like this. They’re on their way out the door, bundled up, and Faith playing with the end of Dean’s scarf as he hauls her towards the Impala when Dean’s phone buzzes and he pulls it out and slips it in between his ear and shoulder, opening the Impala door while he straps Faith into the car seat in the back.
But Dean is already taking Daniel off of his lap, shushing him.
Faith squirmed and turned her attention back to Dean who reached up a hand to wipe the crumbs of sleep out of her eye and then pull her onesie back into place where it had gone askew on her round tummy. He prodded the bright yellow bird on it and tickled her.
Bobby kisses her and she smiles at the scratch of his beard on her cheek before he creeps out of the room, off to some other task.
He snaps her shoes and they are ready to go. Dean, thankfully, is allowed to wear jeans (they’re his
But it’s worth it.
It doesn’t matter, because Dean is even worse at listening to himself.
husband, oh, husband
“Love.” Castiel looks up at Dean’s eyes. “How it paints a different kind of picture to an individual’s life. Gives them…how do you say it, an different perception of reality. One that is more 'optimistic’.”
“S’good to be back.” He mumbles, and Daniel clings to their legs, going on about wanting to be a pilot as his parents break apart and Dean reaches out one big hand to ruffle his hair, his other arm around Cas’s back.
Dean nodded and let his hand trail down to Danny’s shoulder, walking briskly to the desk, glancing at Daniel every few seconds as he filled out his signature and the little boxes detailing the time.
“OUT CAME THE SUN!” Danny roared, his arms bursting out on either side. Dean had to bite back his chuckle. Danny’s enthusiasm at that part always tickled him.
“Relax.” He whispers. “Relax, Cas.”
such a palace
and traced your shadow
It takes Cas thirty minutes to get Daniel to take off his shark costume, but luckily, Faith is an easy task, asleep before Dean has even finished zipping her up into her pajamas. Daniel insists on a spooky story being read to him, but he’s asleep halfway through the book, his mouth slack and his body twisted around Cas’s so he has to almost shake himself loose, slipping the book back on the bookshelf and turning on the star light that rotates slowly, spreading little lights on the walls.
Finally though ,they’re in the terminal and Daniel drops Dean’s hand before he can snatch him back up, racing for the windows. He smooshes his face to the cold pane and looks at the empty gate devoid of aircraft and then swivels around to face his father with disappointment.
There is a long moment of silence as Cas stands over the crib and marvels before Dean opens his eyes to their dimly lit hallway and hears Cas’s final message to their sleeping son.
“Magic!” he hisses, wiggling his fingers and Castiel feels a weight that was not there in the pockets of his over coat. He reaches into the pocket and plucks out the round black stone, the bird still fluttering above their heads, searching for an out.
There was a star who fell in love with a man.
“I realized that it isn’t about the words so much.” Cas murmurs, “When she sings I think about you. I know she is singing about love…” He trails off and Dean slips his hands to Cas’s hips, rocking as they turn.
“Yep!”
Dean rolled his eyes and slung his arm around Cas’s shoulders, drawing him closer so he wouldn’t walk straight into the lamp post in their path. They had just come from dinner and had tossed around the idea of heading to the bar up the street before deciding that the weather was nice enough to stroll in the park instead.
“Dean!” Cas yells this time, and Dean laughs. He  laughs, tongue lolling on his split lip, laughs till he has to roll  over, run fingers over his heaving stomach.
Dean inhaled and Cas bit his side and Dean blew out the air, tossing his arm over his eyes, arching.
They are sitting in the antique book shop in town, a little place called ‘Ed’s Editions’ that Cas is a regular at. Danny and Dean are down in the cars section while Cas flips through a book with illustrations by Salvador Dali. The pictures are colorful and it’s strange to see such tame drawings coming from such a master of the surreal. Cas has always quietly thought that if anyone were to paint heaven Dali would do it the most justice. He wouldn’t have been afraid of what he saw, he thinks. Or maybe he’s wrong. Cas doesn’t know. He never knew the painter.
Death cried out
Dean swallowed, matched his eyes to the family. The little boy.

“‘Spring Rain’. The scent.”
Dean goes to him, and they roll down on to the covers, and Cas hold him and brushes his lips over the little spare drops, chases them, and then kisses Dean with a sigh. Dean slides them, moves over him, crouching, and decides he could watch him forever like this – in the dark. His eyes adjust and he makes out the outcrop of Cas’s hair on the grey comforter, the bone-white glow of his skin. Cas arches his arms over Dean’s neck and then down his sides. It’s somewhere in between Cas’s navel and his chest that Dean calls him pretty, and then Cas’s breath hitches and the muscles stutter against Dean’s mouth.
Dean dwells on the pain for a while, on the throb  of his head and his bruised hands and the split lip he’s still worrying.  Talking has opened it up, and blood oozes out under the tip of his  tongue as he worries it.
“Go for it, dude.” Dean says offhandedly, at the same time trying to ignore the young, redheaded, TSA who is ogling him. He fights the urge to roll his eyes. He knows it’s the

“You’re really cute, you know that?” Dean responded, kissing him again, chastely this time.

“IT WAS AWESOME!” Daniel announces, holding up his pillowcase and Cas shakes his head.
“Ok. Now, you take the time you need, but there are two teenagers bumming around who would probably like to see you.” He says, and Cas smiles; it’s watery, but strong.

“Should you really be nailing that?”
“Mmm.” Cas hummed, when he paused halfway over the ’s’ in his name and mouthed at Dean’s collar bone and then dragged his tongue down again, scraping teeth over Dean’s nipple.
Daniel does a strange kind of flailing dance and then jumps up and down in excitement on his way to the front door, rattling the knob in frustration when he finds it locked. Dean sighs, getting ready for the annual marathon of houses, and clicks the lock.
The boy became a bird.
“Here!” She cries, popping out and Dean makes his most surprised face.
Dean smiles.
“Here Papa, you can have the sweettarts you like those.” Daniel tells Cas proudly, pushing the pile of brightly wrapped candies towards him. Cas smiles and puts them on the table beside him, saving one to open at the moment. He crunches the candy thoughtfully and smiles.
“Hold on!” Cas said, lifting the camera.
"So, I’m thinking we should fry this turkey…” Dean says conversationally, and he raises his eyebrows at Cas who rolls his eyes and elbows him lightly in the side.
“It’s wonderful.” Cas completes. “Isn’t that wonderful? I get to have all this…” he turns to the windows. “…someone, somewhere, let me have all this, and sure I will die, and I won’t come back, but I get to have
They get back to the house and Dean parks the Impala and watches Cas take Faith up to bed where Dean hopes she stays properly knocked out, Danny having woken up when they pulled into the driveway, staggering along, Cas’s arm around his shoulders. Dean sets the alarm while he shrugs out of his jacket and makes sure everything is right before he follows, passing the pot of soup forgotten in the sink. He picks up Polly, even though she grumbles a bit before licking at his chin and wagging her little stumpy tail, and carries her to the second floor. Back upstairs they find Danny halfway on the mattress, having collapsed into the pillow with one foot still touching the floor. Polly wiggles and Dean let’s her gently down on Danny’s bed, where she usually sleeps.
Dean looks up from his coffee to see Daniel jumping up and down at the kitchen table, shoveling handfuls of cheerios in his mouth, passing some of them to Faith. Dean smiles and watches as a round little ‘o’ sticks to Faith’s cheek as she looks at him doe-eyed and then back to  Daniel, opening her hand for more cereal.
“You okay?” Dean said, his concern obvious. Cas took a deep breath and looked at Charlie’s family.
Static pours, blurring and obscuring the song that had been playing into a garbled mess.  Frowning, he stands and walks to the radio, pushing it around on the bench, but the station seems to have some kind of problem, so he settles for tuning it to something else.
“Don’t worry about it," decrescendo against Dean’s mouth.

They tasted the water and tasted their own tears - the ones they cried when people died. When they were born. When things changed.
And some bowed.
It all dissolves into a grumbling match and Castiel is still minorly confused, but he makes amends by passing Dean one of his presents and smiling at him. Dean really doesn’t know why he got so annoyed though. Probably because Sam’s right - that kind of shit
, Incahuasi whispered to him as he stood there, feet wet in the 21st century.
Not rotten stairs.
“That was quick, no traffic?” Castiel says it with only half-interest as Dean opens the door, eyes fixed on the thermometer in his pale fingers, displeasure written all over his face.
“What?” He whispers, shrugging. Dean shrugs himself, drinking his coffee again, but as he goes to sip he makes sure his brother hears him.
The way his eyes hood when he looks at Dean, the way they spark as he finally gives in and takes Faith into his arms, plastering her with kisses that make her shriek and tug at his scarf and his hair.
“Make sure he holds your hand crossing streets,” Cas reminds him, “and go to the door with him, and make sure he doesn’t get any of that unwrapped candy.”
“You better be ready next time then.” He responds playfully, looking haughty for a moment.
Several plans.
"I’ll fix you something,” picking up the pencil to finish his puzzle. A sugar lump of laughter when Cas glances at the Marmaduke - “he looks like Sam…”. It is so nice to be resigned in this way. Resigned to Dean fixing him an egg. A piece of toast. Cold grapes.
show me the mud where he sleeps.
“Look what I found!” He exclaims, coming to stand next to Dean who glances over his shoulder. Cas, who isn’t so good at surprising people, pulls the two bottles of wine out from where it’s hidden and sets them down on the counter. Dean smiles but Cas has this way of telling he’s still worried.
Dean feels like a walking cliche, but he really doesn’t give a good damn.
Dean and Sam will never know how brightly their eyes appear by the light of Castiel’s stars – the millions of them.
“It’s ok monkey, no more medicine.” Danny tells her, his nasally voice trying to be light. He tickles her leg and Faith manages a wet giggle.
“You little fuck!” Dean hissed, his tongue automatically going out to try and get some of the syrup off of him.
“You ok?” Dean said, shaking out Daniel’s favorite pajama pants and handing them to him with clean boxers. Daniel remained silent for a moment while he rubbed his hair with another towel.
The airport is, naturally, packed, and Dean has second thoughts about bringing Faith with them as he navigates security with Daniel about to hyperventilate with the excitement of it all. Between the rapid fire questions from Daniel that Dean can’t answer and Faith crooning her strange baby-talk
Dean stays quiet, and the frogs start up their chirping drone, the dove keeps singing and the whistle of the train a mile away wails in the distance. The willows whisper to each other about the two men who walk along the lake edge and hold hands and kiss each other like they are young. Who fumble over stones and sit silently and watch the birds, who row out a little boat and fish until they come back rosy pink and smelling like long talks about nothing.
“Oh, yes,
“Okay, good. I’ve got the camera…”
Dean twitches a little at how deep Cas’s voice is, eyelids heavy, mind wandering, arms thrown back over his pillow. His knuckles brush the headboard as he shifts a little towards Cas in their bed, trying to entertain Cas’s late-night thought before he passes out entirely.
“I said, that should hold him for ‘all of five seconds’."
“What?” Dean doesn’t get up from the couch where he’s currently reclined, not even when Castiel’s tone tells him that he probably should. Instead he lays there, disgruntled at his nap being disturbed and that he has to acknowledge Cas’s irritated voice from the kitchen.
to the tides; all this and a tattered soul i give to you,
Castiel nods and he can hear them just outside in the backyard.
They said that your second child was supposed to be easier, but Dean really wished someone would give their daughter the memo. Faith, while usually a dream, was the most unpredictable sleeper he’d ever met. Some nights she went straight down and stayed down, but others, especially as of late, she’d taken to screaming instead.
“Make sure you get my good side…” He drawled, and Cas snorted.
“You’ll have to try harder. She laughs or there’ll be trouble.”
He was cut off when arms threw themselves around him from behind, holding him snug. Dean blushed and smoothly sputtered something, but Cas could only squeeze him, the Macy’s bags banging and snagging together awkwardly.
and it’ll all seem so normal and so ordinary and so quiet, and maybe when he’s old he won’t remember any of it, but he’ll remember Cas’s eyes closing and then opening in the bath tub, by the light of storm candles under the rail of the wind, and how those eyes looked at him, water trailing down his nose, and how he smiled and how he let Dean hold his face in his hands, how in a million ways something could have gone so fucking wrong, but it didn’t.

“There was a man with a heavy heart, and it was so heavy it burst like a damn and became a river, and the man couldn’t stay a man any longer. His body was sinking. He was too heavy to hold, so he became a catfish instead, and he hid in the mud, because loneliness is a dark thing, sometimes."
"Cheaper?”
Dean watches the flame of his lighter dance, a gypsy in the dark, flickering and seductive.
“You are ridiculous.” He chews at Dean and Dean laughs, eating another cookie.

“It’s only gonna be a few more minutes, so quit bellyaching.” Dean said in ways of reply to the incoherent sound his son had just emitted. They were in the waiting room of the pediatrician’s office. Cas and Faith had disappeared behind the heavy blue door ten minutes ago for Faith’s check up, and Danny had abandoned the trucks and toys to come bother Dean.
“Not yet…not yet…” he mutters and Dean slowly unfolds his hand over Cas’s weeping erection. Dean kisses his temple and inhales against his skin. They stare at each other and Cas pulls Dean’s arm forward, mouthing at the inside of his elbow. Dean doesn’t say anything (coherent at least) as he falls to his side, Cas climbing back on him to reach into the bedside table. He looks down at Dean, sympathetic for a moment.
“Right, well, those are the greatest hits, so to speak.” Castiel rounded the corner and held up a hand, stopping Dean from going any further. Police tape still cordoned off the whole area where Jonah’s body had been found. He could swear it almost felt colder here. “That’s…um, that’s where Jonah was killed. Up against the far wall.” The most gruesome aspects of the crime scene had been wiped away by the forensic crews, but the jagged holes in the stone were more than enough to paint a vivid picture in his mind.
As Sam strode down the hallway, Dean felt his stomach grumble and turned back to the office. When he pushed the door open, Cas flinched, straightening to attention. When their eyes met, Dean recognized the all too familiar terror eating away at him, and the poor guy didn’t even know the real threat. Never would, if he was lucky.
Dean said, propping an elbow up on the counter.
“I wouldn’t say ‘incessantly…’”
“Shh, just let me imagine for a minute.” Dean closed his eyes and took a breath, then shook it out. “Alright, I’m over it.”
My scar healed cleaner than I expected, and I have to say I’m a little disappointed. It’s not exactly the battle scar I envisioned. Do you think I can still use it to impress women? I’m crossing my fingers that the next time I have a brush with death I get a scar in a place that’s more socially acceptable to show off.
“Hey, is there a vending machine or something around here?” Dean asked.
you ever thought about? What you would do different?”
“Elizabeth Novak speaking,” she answered.
Dean polished off the last of his Coke and set the glass down with a resounding thud. “Not for nothing, but if there was ever another person that would understand a complicated relationship with religion…” He gestured to himself.
Looking him over, Castiel waited for the sarcastic comment to follow, but Dean just drank to finish his turn. Castiel had a burning question on his mind, but he had the feeling that if he asked it, or rather assumed it, out loud, it might break whatever they had going.
” He made the last word sound nasally and pitiful, and he could see Cas bristle.
“That is my real name.”
“Remind me why you’re making your life harder?” Bobby asked as he took notes from a musty old book. “Seems to me like now’s the time to be taking every little crumb of happiness you can scrounge up.”
“Dean, which one?” Sam’s muddled voice said.
She wrapped him in a tight hug that made him flinch, but he needed it all the same. “I’m so glad you’re here, darling; that museum might as well have made you one of the exhibits for how much you’re there.”
“Did the two vics have anything in common?” Dean asked, kneeling down to inspect the gouges in the stage.
“Dean?” said a rough voice. “It’s…uh, it’s Cas.”
Shards of glass crunched under Sam’s shoes as sidled over and fished the silver cross out of the case, fiddling with the closure.
The nurse finished up her duties in the room and closed the door behind her, leaving Castiel bewildered. On top of the pain in his abdomen, his head was fuzzy, his limbs like lead. He didn’t imagine that the doctors could diagnose post-traumatic demon possession symptoms, but it seemed likely there would be some kind of negative physical response to having a hellish entity forcefully manipulate your body.
“Why do you say that like my masculinity is in question?” Cas asked, dutifully taking his shot, but he stuck his tongue out at the taste.
--that’s my own choice. But I can’t get close to anyone else.” He breathed deep. “They’d just be another person I’m leaving behind.”
into the search bar. Heart pounding, he clicked on the first result that looked relevant.
The unasked question stuck in Castiel’s mind the rest of the week, obsessing over what it could have been. He put himself in Alex’s shoes, trying to discern what kind of tumultuous thoughts must be turning over in his head. Castiel thought he could at least understand some of the abandonment Alex must feel. To go to bed with a father and wake up without one changed a person. On the other hand, Castiel’s father could very well still be out there, while Alex’s was definitively gone. Cas wondered if it would hurt less to know that his dad was dead, to have the closure of it.
“That depends on a lot of things,” Dean told him, “and again, not really something you can look up in a textbook. It’s possible, but is that a risk you’re willing to take?”
“No kidding?” Dean asked, a tone of respect in the question. “To be honest, I kinda said that just because it feels irresponsible not to. Kudos to you for not falling down the rabbit hole.”
They swam through the current of mingling bodies, one door to the ballroom propped open just ahead. Dean checked his watch, ignoring the stupid butterflies in his stomach. Sam whispered ‘excuse us’ as they slipped by a group of priests into the ballroom, the lights dim to better project the presentation on the giant screen at the front of the room. The speaker was tying up his lecture, clicking a remote to cycle through images of angels and round, runic symbols. They stood at the back to be as undisruptive as possible, and Sam squinted up at the speaker.
Why did everything in his life feel like a war?
Castiel nodded. “Does that…mean something to you? I don’t mean to doubt your methods or anything, but I don’t understand what this has to do with catching this killer.”
“First of all, darling, let those among us who haven’t sent a drunk text be the first to throw stones.”
“If you saw the look on his face, you would know why I was afraid to ask,” he said. “He must have his reasons, and I trust that they’re good ones, but…”
“First, I’ve yet to meet the person who can successfully talk you out of anything that you set your mind to. Second, from what you’ve told me, it sounds like this boy could use someone in his corner. Brothers are one thing, but they aren’t everything.”
It wasn’t that he was afraid Sam wouldn’t understand. Even if the shame and the self-hatred still simmered inside him, he knew that if anything, Sam was probably more open-minded than he was. Maybe it was a little bit that he was embarrassed like he had a schoolboy crush, but he couldn’t pretend that was it.
The realization hit Castiel with a cold dread just a split second before he heard it said aloud: “St. Peter was crucified upside down.”
“Ghosts? Is that the FBI’s working theory?” a voice behind them said.
But he took a deep breath, reminding himself that folding under pressure wasn’t in his nature. Fear is a catalyst, a weapon as much as it is a shield. Wield it, and carve a path to greatness.
Dean held his ground as Dr. Novak searched his gaze, but it was difficult not to squirm. The doctor tilted his head to the side just so, and said, “Am I supposed to take your advice when you don't even believe in it, Agent Bulsara?”
“Why do I feel like this has only scratched the surface?”
“Ooh,” Dean winced. “I dunno, there are definitely wrong answers in karaoke.”
Whatever scared Dean away had to be more than one stray demon, and as terrified as he was, Castiel intended to get to the bottom of it. He’d spent long enough abiding by Dean’s advice to let things lie. The supernatural had its turn coming after him; now it was time for Cas to return the favor. Dean had saved Castiel’s life twice, and he didn’t plan on letting Dean walk away without letting Castiel save him too.
As his plane landed in Delaware, Castiel watched the scenery below him come into focus, recognizing landmarks he hadn’t seen in years. The nostalgia hit him harder than he expected it to, and he tried to think of a good reason why he hadn’t been back in so long.
Castiel huffed a laugh. “I figured, although it would explain the alarm system if the perpetrator had no corporeal form.”
“Absolutely,” Cas said. He gathered his things and gestured to the door. “We can talk in my office.” Alex was silent through the hallways, staring at his feet as they walked. He’d visited for office hours on several occasions, eager to discuss his opinions and learn from Castiel’s experience. Castiel readily encouraged Alex’s professional curiosity, but he had also taken on a mentor role in a more personal capacity. While he didn’t broadcast it, Castiel didn’t hide the fact that he was gay, and he had a soft spot for students struggling to emerge and find their place in the community. When Alex told him about being transgender, Castiel immediately felt the urge to take him under his wing, the experience hitting close to home. He told Alex about his sister’s transition, something he hadn’t even brought up to Dean.
“Just give me a moment to grab my keys,” Castiel said, nudging Anna back in the direction of the office. She gave him a sidelong glance but followed his lead, looking back over her shoulder at the agents who had already been distracted by the various accoutrements laid out on the tables.
“Go, go, go,” Dean pushed him in the opposite direction. “Back toward the labs.”
He blew out a breath, scrubbing his hair as he stared at the computer screen, too bright in the dark room. The search box glowed, empty and waiting for input. It would be too easy. It had taken a herculean effort to keep himself from doing it before now, feeling like it was some kind of violation of Castiel’s privacy. As if the man hadn’t given Dean every chance to ask.
“Life is all about risk, Sammy. It’ll be fun.” Dean snatched his jacket off the back of the chair, throwing what few belongings he had scattered around the hotel room into his bag.
Dean wheezed, but recovered enough to tell Sam to shut up before he left the room again. He readjusted himself on the couch, sitting up to angle the computer screen away from Bobby at his desk.
“Any day now, Dean!” Sam shouted.
But Sam scoffed, shaking his head. “Looks like the deaths put the opening of their new exhibit on hold.” He scanned farther. “The exhibit’s headed by two different curators. Sounds like a good place to start.”
” He posed the question as playful, but it stung more than he cared to admit.
He laughed. “I’ll let you get back to your marathon.”
With a deep breath, Dean gave the question some thought. “Sam tried to do the college thing; he was gonna be a lawyer. But he’s a whiz kid. I don’t really think college has my name on it. But I’m good with my hands. Maybe I’d settle down, work on cars or something. You know, if I had the time.”
Dr. Novak kept his eyes forward but gave a curt nod. “Dr. Milton and I are headlining it together. I’m sure you can understand why it’s especially important to us to have this case solved.”
“No, no, darling, I always have time for you! To what do I owe the pleasure?”
“Ah, I see, you were trying to be clever.” Castiel turned back to his article, but he could see Dean in his peripheries, and it was clear that he was not used to his lines falling flat. It was actually almost endearing in a way, seeing the little stab of hurt on his face. He almost felt bad.
“If it would help,” Castiel interjected before Anna could answer, “I could walk you through the exhibit while Anna answers questions.”
Dean returned with Agent May and pointed out the list she’d handed over, and his partner snatched it up. Castiel jumped when he slapped it down on the desk, finger pointing to the top of the list. “Here, I was right,” he said. “In the play, Jonah was playing the apostle Peter. Which fits, because in reality—”
Anna offered a tired but grateful smile. “Cheese curds always help.”
They excused themselves, leaving Castiel alone in the office. This job was supposed to be boring, he thought, pressing his palms to his eyes. Boring and safe. Fending off some psycho religious serial killer was not in the career trajectory.
“Someone’s gotta be. Except…” Dean trailed off.
“Ah, well…no, not exactly.”
Dean grimaced. “Well, first of all, gross. Second of all, what, we got a saint who hates being entertained?”
“Drunk idiot money spends just as good as any other form of payment.”
“Hey, what happened? I got your text, are you alright?” he asked, letting her squeeze him tight for a moment before she pulled back to look at him.
Dean,
Warily, Castiel settled into the seat beside Dean, casting an anxious glance at his old spot across the table, the one that kept him a safe distance away. “Okay, let’s hear it.”
“What do you want from me?” Dean growled. “I’ve already bought what you’re selling—you’ll get my soul when the time comes.”
“It was these two nuns,” Dean continued, the words starting to stick in his throat, “they’d killed themselves after people found out they were, you know, together.”
Castiel didn’t say anything for a few moments. “I’m worried about Alex,” he finally said. “He traded one poisonous feeling for another. And as long as he continues to be confronted by his dad, he’s not going to be able to put this behind him.” A shuddering sigh rasped over the phone’s speaker. “I just—I don’t know if I can do this your way.”
“Well, it’s the Bible, darling, I think you’ll manage to scrape together enough content. God knows modern Christians continue finding things to pick over. Literally, I’m sure He knows,” she said in a bitter tone Castiel knew well.
“Cas.”
Shaking his head, Dean squinted up at the moon. “Being stuck in limbo like that, not being able to pass on to the afterlife…it twists people, drives ‘em crazy. Maybe what once was some kind of holy mission spent four hundred years rotting in the veil, coming out the other side like this.”
Dean ran his hands through his hair, droplets of water misting the air. He collapsed in his bed, tucking one arm under his head. Eleven years ago, and he could still hear the ringing in his ears when Dad gave him the case. First time out on his own—it should have been a reward if it didn’t feel so much like a punishment, a warning.
“I think I’ll leave that to you, Art School,” Dean said.
“From what you told me before, it sounds like Dean had a lot on his plate before, up to and including possibly wrestling with his identity. I’ve watched more than one of my children undergo that kind of journey, and you know it doesn’t happen overnight. Maybe it took him the summer to realize he’s ready to accept that part of himself.”
As Dean pulled into the motel parking lot, Sam looked at his watch. “It’s not even ten,” he said. “Aside from the mad dash there at the end, we pulled that one out pretty quick.”
complicate things, but I think that made it worse? Although, in our line of work, I guess that’s not that surprising. How many people can say ‘the spirit of my dead father helped me and my resurrected brother kill the demon who burned my mother alive.’”
Acrid black smoke shoved its way down Castiel’s throat, filling every inch of space inside him until he felt pushed from his own body. Trapped inside his mind and unable to move, the presence controlled his limbs like a marionette, spoke using his voice. It laughed at his feeble attempts to break free from its hold, and Castiel let the panic consume him, screaming with no sound.
They had circled or underlined only a handful of names from the extensive list, but only a few of them sounded familiar. He ruled out the women first, and that left seven names to choose from.
Cas gave him a little salute, then turned and walked back to his desk. They fell back into their own routines, but Sam interrupted only a few minutes later. He strode in waving a case file, and Dean snapped to. “What do we got?”
“Just like ‘Sam, let me borrow your laptop,’ is code for ‘I need to check my email to reread Castiel’s messages again,’” Sam said, walking over and dropping the laptop on Dean’s stomach.
Grumbling, Dean finished off his shooter and picked a second one. “If we’re being cutthroat, I’m gonna assume that you’re one of those people who reads their horoscope every morning.”
“Hester,” Castiel said, getting the attention of a blonde woman poring over some documents by a stone tablet. She looked up, and he asked, “Have you seen anyone come in here? We’re supposed to meet with some FBI agents.”
The demon lifted its hand, revealing a kitchen knife that it spun with a deft flourish. “Oh, believe me—there are plenty of little hellions that would love to make you punch your ticket early.” It dragged Castiel’s fingers over the edge of the blade, drawing blood. “Me, however? I’m content to let you drag this out to the last possible second. Maybe I’m just a sucker for suspense.” It shrugged, taking a few lazy steps out of the kitchen area. “I just don’t think you should have to wait until your deal’s up to get a taste of the destination. Let’s call it a free trial offer.”
Castiel had certainly paid his dues over the years pining after straight men. As much as he tried to not assume peoples’ sexuality, most often it was painfully obvious that his heart had chosen a lost cause. Generally speaking, he had a pretty successful track record being able to clock people that way. But the longer he sat with Dean, the more he started to doubt his initial reading.
Sam was deadly quiet, the shadows of the falling night cutting across his face, hiding his expression from Dean. “We can still figure out a way to save you.”
If he said it out loud, he couldn’t run from it anymore.
“Don’t you think I would have told you if I found out something more interesting than his alma mater?” Dean shot back. He ignored the tiny part of his brain that implied there was anything to be defensive about. He’d just gotten dinner and happened to run into some guy. Nothing special.
“It does sound like our kinda thing,” Dean agreed. “But we’re on our own case right now, on our way to New York.”
“Since when is a museum your idea of fun?” Sam asked with a disbelieving grin. Pushing out his chair, he followed suit and packed away his laptop before pulling the article closer.
“What’s happening?” Castiel asked. He tried to intuit the answer, following Dean’s gaze, but he was looking wildly all around the room.
“Stop talking, you idiot,” Dean hushed him. He switched out the towels, willing the paramedics to hurry their asses up.
“We gonna talk about this, or am I gonna be deaf by the time we get to Bobby’s?” Sam asked.
Anna grinned, holding the door open for him as they both filed out.
As they stood face to face, it was hard not to notice the stormy blue of his eyes. They had a trustworthy depth to them, and Dean found himself believing the sincerity of the words. He slipped his hands in his pockets and huffed a sigh as well. “For what it’s worth, I know a thing or two about heavy consciences. I can’t say it goes away, but it does get easier.”
“Dean—”
“Why apostles though?” Sam wondered. “That’s what I’m stuck on—these are purposeful killings, not just random acts of violence.” He set a hand on his hip, the other stroking his chin. “We just need more time. Hopefully Dr. Novak keeping the actors out will buy us enough.”
“Is that an official guess?”
Castiel held his hand out, and Sam gave him the picture to study closer. “If you give me some more time, I think I could parse it out. I have some of my notes here.”
But Cas pushed on. “Can I hold you to that?”
“Awesome, thanks.”
Sam shook his head, turning to read the roadside signs for something to eat other than Biggerson’s. “So, since when are you a TED Talk guy? Especially for one we have to drive halfway across the country for.”
“Oh, darling, you always wore your heart on your sleeve. It’s both a virtue and a vulnerability.”
Dean gripped the foot of the bed, his knuckles white. “If I hadn’t come here, you wouldn’t be hurt. Simple as that. So don’t try and tell me it’s not my fault.”
He woke with a start.
“Ha!” Though far from intoxicated, Dean could feel the whiskey from earlier settling in with the new liquor. It was just enough of a pleasant buzz to disable his second-guessing thoughts, and without further ado, he yanked down the collar of his shirt to expose the pentagram.
Do you and Sam take time out of your busy schedules to do normal people things? Go the movies? Shop at the mall? Visit museums that aren’t haunted? I walked through an art gallery last weekend, and I spent hours there just losing myself in that world again. I remember looking at this painting called “Mind In Motion,” which was a simple white canvas with a winding blue line. For some reason, all I could hear was your voice in my head saying “It just looks like the guy sneezed right before he started to paint and then called it a day.” It made me laugh trying to picture you doing things like that for fun. But I hope you’re finding time to do something that makes you laugh too.
“Maybe?” Sam said. “I guess I remember you being gone, but obviously I wasn’t there if you went off by yourself.”
Mirroring Dean’s position, Castiel put his arm up and rested his head in his hand. “
Dean,
But Dean dropped his gaze again. “I have to be stronger than that.”
It’s been a week since I last emailed you. I don’t know if you’re ignoring me, bad at checking your email, or wrapped up in some other zany hunt. I give each of the above options an equal chance, but I hope it’s not the first one.
“I will.” Another long pause. “Thank you, Dean. I…it was good to hear your voice again.”
Castiel set the icepack down, hugging his arms around himself. “If ghosts are real, does that mean angels are real too?”
When they reached the arched entrance to the hall, Dean grabbed two handfuls of Castiel’s collar and shook him until he had his attention. “Listen to me, we need your help.”
Dean shrugged. “I don’t
The words died on his tongue as he turned to look for Dean, instead finding himself a breath away from the saint. The man’s black eyes bored into him, the gray pallor of his skin darkened by spidery veins. Castiel flinched as the figure raised its arm, and some unseen force shoved him back against, his head cracking through the thick glass display window.
Castiel looked back and forth between them. “Knowing what kind of horizons you sail, I’m a little afraid to ask if this is for research or for fun.”
A few tears slipped out of Alex’s eyes, and he quickly wiped them away. “My dad didn’t just die,” he said, voice cracking. “He killed himself, and I think it was my fault.”
He hovered in indecision, cursing under his breath. All their gear was still in the trunk—it wasn’t exactly inconspicuous as an FBI agent to come waltzing in carrying a loaded shotgun. If he ran now, he had the chance to head Conrad off, but should the spirit show up, all he had on him was a flask of holy water. Useless. If they tried to make a break for the car, they risked the ghost intervening, either getting to Conrad first or locking them out when they tried to get back in.
They barreled down the interstate toward the museum, and Sam unrolled the newspaper again, reading the article more in depth. “This is one pissed off ghost, if that’s what we’re dealing with,” he said. “It says the second vic was ‘pinned upside down to the wall by his wrists and feet.’”
“I can do that. I’m almost finished with your list, then I’ll call Anna to help contact everyone.”
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t think so, but Anna was pretty shaken up. And other than the fact that neither murder was caught on the security feeds, the police seem to think it’s some kind of serial killer based on the nature of the deaths.”
“Dean?” he said, voice sticking in his throat with nerves. “It’s…uh, it’s Cas.”
His mother pushed the door open and set his suitcase at the bottom of the stairs. “Would you like something to drink?” she asked. “We’re working on putting out a new white I think you’d like. Very sweet.”
“I’ve tried just about every conceivable food you can chuck in a deep fat fryer, and I haven’t met one I didn’t like. So try me.”
Dean,
He ended the call and immediately searched for Conrad’s number. It barely cycled through one ring before it sent him to voicemail.
“I’m safe,” Cas assured him, “before you get wound up. Alex is safe too, I think. But he’s still seeing apparitions of his father. I had hoped—I mean, maybe it was naïve, but I thought that…” He trailed off.
“Oh, come on, gay or not, that’s like a rite of passage! Not even right when you turned eighteen just because you could?”
“Promise.”
The silhouette whirled around as the double doors behind him slammed shut. Dean heard Sam saying “No, no, no,” as he brought up the rear. The four of them convened at the doors, Sam elbowing through to rattle the bar to no effect.
With one hand pressed to Cas’s abdomen, Dean gripped the hand Castiel had tightened on his sleeve. “Are you kidding? You’re not a real hunter without a battle wound like this.”
Castiel opened a drawer and pulled something out, but Dean couldn’t see what it was behind the counter. “Too bad we couldn’t feel all our manly little feelings about ten minutes ago; maybe we could have avoided this.”
Castiel put the puzzle together. “So, that makes Agent May…”
“That’s my name: Castiel.”
I'm not dead!
“What? What happened?” Sam asked. Dean could imagine him sitting up straight, instincts kicking in as soon as he heard the tone of Dean’s voice.
“I mean, the police aren’t getting anywhere,” Anna said, shrugging one shoulder. “I guess I just feel a little intimidated. And having to relive that night again…” She rubbed her eyes.
The ghost flickered into solid form, his eyes dark rimmed and cold as they zeroed straight in on Conrad. He wore a white cassock underneath an elaborately embroidered red vestment, tarnished with age. His limp black hair framed his gaunt face, smooth like he’d died young.
It was inevitable that the question came up, but Castiel hadn’t prepared a good answer. He sipped his drink to buy himself a few seconds. “Well…I guess you could say the museum and I had a parting of the ways.”
“Is this another boy you want but can’t have?” she said, the smile taking the sting out of the words.
was a comic character from
Dean looked over his shoulder where the man had come running from the backstage area. There was nothing there. Yet.
“You’re like his protector, aren’t you?” Castiel asked. He stood up to get some glasses of water from the kitchenette.
Castiel guided him to take a seat in one of the desks at the front row, sitting himself in an adjacent chair. “You’ll have all the time you need to get your projects in—that should be the last thing on your mind. You’re an exceptional student, Alex, but just recognize that if you push yourself too hard, you’re only going to make it worse for yourself in the end. It’s okay to take time to grieve.”
His feet moved before his mind decided to ignore the command. Taking a deep, steeling breath, he turned the handle and stepped out into the dim hallway.
This time Cas was quiet, staring at Dean with a growing pressure on his heart. He had the feeling Dean could tell his eyes were on him, but he refused to look up. It was clear that Sam was uncomfortable with the tension in the air, and after a moment it got the better of him. “I’m gonna wait in the hallway.” He clapped Dean on the shoulder and stepped out of the room.
“Do you know what it means?” Sam prodded.
The wind died and the temperature warmed, and all at once it was eerily quiet. Dean’s breath tickled his ear, but with a herculean sigh he pushed off the wall and collapsed on his backside. The three of them sat in silence, catching their breath, regaining their bearings.
“Surprise?” He asked and Dean nodded, bouncing Faith who was starting to wiggle, making little frustrated sounds as she bunched up Dean’s shirt in her little hands.
“I have blessed  you, and so you shall walk beside him and light his lamp,” he breathed into one, and the stone was blessed and split in its joy, and its tears were like many jewels.
“What?” Dean says, the sound muffled by the pillow case. Cas smiles at him and then closes his eyes.
Good morning, sweetheart.
“This was a good idea.” He whispers and Dean breathes a laugh and strokes the fine hair at the base of Cas’s skull.  “For everyone.”
“Again! Again!” She says and resumes pushing her cheeks out. Daniel does it again. laughing, and looking at Dean.
someone who could intuit
“Can’t really tell the difference, Cas.” He breathes and Castiel isn’t even listening anymore, already back into his own head, making notes.
Dean slings her back up and grabs a beer from the fridge before following Cas’s example by wandering towards the singing cartoons on the television. Faith whines to get down and he lets her, watching as she gallops to the legos and sits down, immediately resuming whatever it was. Every few seconds she pauses and watches the movie, her mouth falling open, only to snap back to her legos, talking to herself.
, Castiel thought, thinking of the poor suckers.
“Ok, let’s try again…”
There  was a boy with a lyre who had a son, and the son rebelled.
the others laughed, like mobbing gulls, greedy for crumbs - sandwiches and garbage.
i see you,
“Be careful, Dean. You’re heavily intoxicated.”
“What?” Dean says, voice thick and sleepy.
“I-I threw up in history…thanks for coming so quick…” he trailed off into a groan and Dean stroked his neck.

“You’re going to die someday.” Inias interjects, like the very idea alarms him.
The reaction is expected, Castiel’s face goes from irritation to just blank, as if Dean has said something so stupid he can’t be bothered to be even remotely surprised. He just stares at Dean, daring him to continue.  Dean does, with confidence.
“Me too.” Cas agrees, laughing when Danny abandons the toy and reaches for Dean’s folded arms instead.
“Come in!” She calls, and Leticia follows, because it is shady inside. The bruja sits down at her small table and drinks from a little tea cup, and Leticia thinks it might have been beautiful once upon a time when the bruja was not a bruja. She keeps smiling and motions for Leticia to sit.
“No.”
Cas has tried
“What happened to the man?” Leticia says after a moment and the bruja finishes her humming, folding her hands delicately on the little table top.

Sam wouldn’t have been bothered, but, Cas was

, Dean thinks, rolling his eyes as he rephrases, trying to maintain eye contact with his hysterical three year old.
“…upon hearing of my homesickness, Jack said to ‘cross my palms’ and since I had never heard such say before, I was curious and asked on its meaning. Such an idiom I had never come across before, being from the East. What he told me was such an explanation that I hope to record it in similar voice so I could describe it to my Emily on my next letter to her.
“I’m holding you to that. The cleaning up bit.” Cas says, brushing past Dean who is grabbing extra paper towels, as he goes into the living room, sitting down on the floor to help Daniel sort his candy.
They file back to their seats and Dean sits with his children shared between Cas and his laps, watching the rest of the program run its course. Cas leans into him and Daniel moves his arm so Faith can scoot under it and put her thumb in her mouth, watching the rest of the students perform.
“I’m precious.” Dean calls back, snuggling back into the couch. It’s just as he’s about to really get into his nap that he hears the cupboard open again and he tenses. He forgot about the package shifting right beside him.
“Come on, you love me though!” Dean throws as Cas goes back to the kitchen, this time to finish looking for something sweet that
“Holy shit!” Dean shoots up off of the couch, his fishing dream cut abruptly short by the horrible screeching he’s now hearing, and knocks the standing lamp over on the way to the kitchen. “CAS!"
“Those look like Cosmic Brownies.” He says evenly, tensing his shoulders. More like, they

“Thank you, Sam.” Castiel says with a content smile, staring at the record in his lap. “Very much.” His long, slim, fingers run over the edge of the records sleeve and the slight jut of the black vinyl cresting out of the top.
They eat their first dinner in their new house on the floor. Dean spreads an old sheet on the hardwood and Cas dumps fruit in a steel pot because they haven’t bought bowls yet. They sit in the light from the big bay windows (the ones Cas fell in love with) and watch the sun go down, eating pizza and wings on paper towels, nibbling on the fruit. Cas smiles the whole time and when Dean asks all Cas can say is that “it’s theirs”. The food in the new fridge the cans in the pantry, the spaces marked for furniture, the bedding set waiting to be broken in upstairs. Theirs. Dean grins at him over his pizza and Cas gently reaches out to wipe sauce off of his cheek, fingers lingering. “Mine.” Cas adds, rocking forward to kiss him. Dean let’s himself be spread out on the clear end of the sheet, laughing while the sun paints their downstairs a vibrant warm orange. “Yours.” he murmurs as Cas kisses him for each freckle on his face.
i ask you this
Incahuasi interrupted
“God it gets harder to drive every time. I feel like I gotta practice.” Dean slurs and Cas rubs his back in soothing circles, fingers skating over Dean’s shoulder blades.
With every click of the lighter.
Elohim appeared to the brother in a dream.
“Anyway.” Cas finished. “You behave?” He said, addressing Danny as they moved to the door. Danny nodded and Dean lifted him up to put him on his shoulders once they were outside.
Castiel skimmed through the booklet of available tunes and told his selection to the woman, but Dean couldn’t read lips well enough to tell. When Cas returned, his spread his arms. “Well, what have I been signed up for?”
“I’ve already given my statement to the police. You’ll hear about it in the papers tomorrow anyway, I’m sure—you might as well hear it from me first.”
That made Dean splutter. “I don’t think I like your tone,” he said, wiping his mouth. “Don’t you insult Baby like that.”
But Castiel swallowed his trepidation and joined them at the desk, cocking his head to see the symbol upright. “That looks like Enochian,” he said.
Sam was still out on another of his extended snack hunts when Dean’s phone rang.
“It’s a free country.”
Alex nodded. “And even though it has to be something wrong with me, it feels so real. Like I can feel his presence in the room, or I’ll think things moved on their own. And when he appears, it’s like he’s trying to tell me something, but then he’s gone again.”
don’t you see me?
“You wanted it
They don’t do this often, but Cas is being needy, and before Dean would even think about stopping any of it his pants have hit the floor and Cas is letting his head slide down the door of the cabinet behind him, groaning, hands scrabbling at Dean’s neck.
They hunted. They fought off saber toothed tigers. They named it
“Fish!” She says and Daniel much to his surprise, giggles a little.
“Couldn’t tell you!” He says, mouth full, and a cupboard closes loudly.
“Just went off at 100.” Cas replies, just as Dean reads over the numbers, placing it over by the sink as a little body bumps against him.  “Danny’s too…”
The stone arcs up and then – there is no stone.
Cas wonders if this is just a well-placed lie to keep him from becoming homicidal. He hasn’t slept properly in days, and he’s kept quiet about it, but now he’s just sitting with his head back in the glider, Daniel crying on his lap, and tears just streaming down his face.
Her lip quivers and she comes to him, slow as can be, being especially gentle because she knows he’s hurt. He pulls her up on the bed and she lays on top of him and buries her face in his chest. He shushes her and rubs her back over and over.
When Dean comes upstairs at a little after 11, he can’t help but feel  for the mess he sees in the nursery. Cas has his hand over his eyes, and Daniel is still crying, and Cas looks like he’s about to lose it.
“Hey bud, what happened?” Dean said softly, coming in, heading straight for his son who smiled pathetically and then grimaced, curling himself more over the trash can. Dean reached out and put a hand on the back of his neck - he was burning up, though the goosebumps told Dean he was probably freezing in the school’s blasting air conditioner.
“It was the best! You were the best one there!” He nearly shouts and Daniel wraps his arms around Dean’s neck and buries himself there.
Next time he will burn Sammy, won’t bury him. He’ll burn him to dust, he’ll scatter him away, free,
“It’s a date.” he responds and she nods before bounding to the door, forgetting to close it behind her. Polly snuffles beside Dean on the bed and he shuts his eyes and feels for her warm head beside him.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Cas moaned, scraping hands over his face before slapping them down at his sides. “Ok, we have to get these in the washer or that stain will set and we will never get it out.”
"You look well!” Inias tries, “…and Dean. He looks exceptionally well.”
“Whatever.” Dean grumbled, putting things away, Cas smiling at his back.

“Don’t cry sugar. Don’t cry.” He whispers to her. “You know Daddy can’t stand to see you cry."
“Ok.” He breathes, before stopping, almost reconsidering, but not really. It’s more of a qualifier what he says next. “But she needs a bath – they both do. And we’ll put some of that rub on their chests, and they have got to get out of these clothes…I should have had them change earlier but I was tired and I wasn’t thinking…”

To give succor, and to give solace.
would you?”
“It’s so fucking good. You want some?”
A few hours past and Daniel remained quiet. When Cas got home he was naturally frantic, machine gunning questions at Dean about what had happened only to rush upstairs and check for himself that Daniel was indeed alive and not in small pieces everywhere. Once he had assured this he spent the rest of the evening worrying over him while Dean fixed dinner for he and Faith and looked after her.
“Pretty good.”
They stand, at Daniel’s insistence, and it feels like the plane takes a million years to dock itself at the gate and for passengers to start disembarking. Dean puts a hand on Daniel’s head as he jumps up and down – they are strategically placed a few feet back so as not to get run over, but with every person who exits, Dean is pretty willing to bet that Daniel gets closer and closer to lunging for the doorway leading towards the parked jet.
“You want me to…?” He rubs an appreciative hand over Dean’s dick through his boxers and Dean shakes his head, grabbing Cas’s hips, feels the press of Cas’s knee between his legs, the softness of the bed. He stares up at him, the muss of his hair and the toned line of his shoulders, the wet on the front of his jockeys slung low on his pelvis.
It certainly wasn’t sugar.
Dean nearly laughs and then is quiet, the sound he makes stopped short for fear of hurting Cas’s feelings.
“Good plan.” Dean says as Cas finally kisses him properly before pulling back and sitting down on the table.
Castiel nods.
A sister used her lion’s paw to slash slits in the veil and he pressed one of his great eyes to it -  rolled it over the blue marble spinning in the dark. They knelt at the edge of the plane, like children spying through a keyhole.
you come to the well with your jar
He sips his beer and rests his eyes, rubbing Cas’s leg through his jeans.
“Pillowcase?”
As Dean wheels into the playroom he has to navigate over Legos and the insides of the dollhouse, but it’s easy to reach them. Daniel is still holding the lion over his head and Faith is starting to pitch a
“I’m full of those, you know.” Dean grunts and Cas just breathes his own sighing chuckle.
He can feel the smile through the phone that Dean gives him, knows he’s probably ducked his head, shyly staring at the floor.
Sometimes, Dean wakes up and thinks it’ll be  better, that this won’t own him, won’t mark him up like a child with  their favorite toy.
“Fay-Fay did you like it?” Daniel says, staring at his sister who squirms and begs to be let down from Dean’s arms. When he does she goes straight to Daniel and hugs him, hanging on his side.
She takes her big brothers hand and he lets her lead him to the stairs where they climb down carefully, still gripping each other’s fingers. Dean follows behind them, not bothered it takes them twice as long this way.
The school’s cafeteria- turned-auditorium is packed with kids and parents, but thankfully Cas is wearing red, so it’s easier to spot him and there, beside him, is an empty chair, seemingly for Dean, Faith to occupy their laps to save room. Cas is messing with the camcorder and looks up when Dean sits down and situates Faith on his knees. Faith gets the first kiss, but she deserves it with how pretty she looks and though Dean is reluctant to let her he allows her to cross over to Cas’s lap and settle there, watching everything with wonder.
“We missed you too.” Dean murmurs, but Cas isn’t listening. He’s too busy grinning at Daniel who’s asking him all about his trip.
“Is today the day?!”
He did it again and again every time she shrieked, until Cas’s eyes were watering he was laughing so hard, his breath coming in stuttered little pants. He had to stop and wipe at his face as he calmed down, coughing slightly, and Faith mapped his arms with her little fingers, clamoring to get closer to him as he flicked the tears from the corners of his eyes. She collapsed against him and he hooked his hands under her arms and brought her above him.
“You really missed out. It was really good pie,” he commented and Dean stepped back.
She shrieked and Dean shook his head as Faith rocked back and sat on the floor, Cas pulling the towel off of his shoulders to put over her.
, and as he looks around he can’t find something very out of place. Dean turns and faces him though and smiles.
Cas blushed, shaking his head.
“Speaking my language.” He mouths on Cas’s cheek and Cas pecks him once more before walking back inside.
“What is that about?” She says, obviously bored with the bookstore. Cas smiles to himself and turns to her. She doesn’t meet his stare, reaching out a hand to turn the page instead. She flips it forward and back, trying to glean something from it. Cas tilts his head, watching her.

“Wave bye bye!” He tells her and she shakes her hand limply up and down and Dean turns to wave to her too, making her shriek with infant joy.
“Ok.” Dean said tiredly, standing up and helping Cas to peel off the sheets and then gather the comforter up into his arms, following Cas downstairs.
“No what?”
There is thunderous applause and he steps out into the aisle, past the thousands of nameless faces gazing at him, watching him walk briskly down the center carpet and eventually up the steps onto the stage, the spotlight trailing him.
Leticia thinks on this a moment and shrugs herself.
“What are you doing?” He asked and Dean sat up on the bed, crosslegged and held up the chocolate frosting.
“Daddy! Did you bring me something? Did you bring me a present?”
“Dean…” Cas whined, not understanding, and as Dean reappeared he smiled.
“Are you good at fighting bad guys?”
“Wow.” Dean comments, watching them and Faith bounces, clacking two legos together before fitting them back onto some bizarre construction. Cas stretches his foot, making his ankle pop, and Dean watches as Faith plays, still muttering to herself in some nonsensical language.
house, celebrating their third Christmas together. Cas is in his favorite straight-backed chair positioned strategically where he can stare at the tree, but close enough to his bookcase so that his precious tomes are never out of reach. Now though, he’s absorbed in the record and Sam looks proud, leaning back on the couch beside his older brother. He feels Dean’s stare after a moment and looks to him, brow knotting together.
Dean will never know that the night sky is so  laden, so fettered, so consistently bursting with light, that it could  light the world a hundred times again. To Castiel there is no difference  in day and dark – he sees too far, too wide, too long. Humans, with  their low light sensitivity, will never know outside their telescopes  how many stars bear down on them. For an angel there are no dark spaces,  no differentiations. He finds no pictures, no constellations, just star  upon star, crowding and immense and nearly blinding.

“He catches me every time.”
bring me his arms so i may cover him.
Then, Daniel looks to Mrs. Raven who kneels in the middle aisle and cues the sound guy. All of a sudden, music pours from the speakers and all the kids stand at attention. Dean feels his smile making his cheeks sore as he realizes that they are all wearing  matching white t-shirts with big green painted things on them made from what appears to be their hand prints. Daniel claps his hands in time with the music and the whole class choruses in on ‘Happiest Christmas Tree’, which explains why Daniel has been singing it nonstop for nearly a week.
“Yeah.” Faith responds, walking straight into Castiel’s waiting arms, Danny waiting to hold Dean’s hand again, snuffling. The house smells like the soup Cas made while Dean was busy playing bath monitor, and only a few lights are on. The four make their way to the Impala, sliding in, and the heater is blasting, the legos in the vents rattling around. Castiel closes the door, one arm around Faith’s back as they settle back into the give of the leather, the other around Danny who is draped halfway onto his lap, leaning on his sister who is too tired to complain. Dean eases her out of the driveway, fishing for a radio station, settling for Christmas Carols because it’s November, and turns the volume down to a low hum. The old-version of Silent Night comes on, and a Bing Crosby number, and out of the corner of his eye Dean can see that Castiel’s eyes are closed too as he bundles Faith against his chest in a huge quilt they’d bought at an antique sale a few months back (yes. They are

“Danny is very excited, so make sure you tell Faith to be excited too. He wants to impress us all.”
“I had to look up the translated texts, but yes.”
For Dean, it makes Cas’s antics tolerable and all the more endearing. After all, how often does Dean get to see an angel of God standing watch at the front door, clutching a bowl of snickers and waiting in a bed sheet with an expression so serious that he doesn’t even look like he’s having fun? The laughs only increase as Cas starts timing the trick-or-treater’s and begins opening the door before they can ring the bell, making the all scream usually.
“Lying here lonely…all alone, and I bet you wanted me, couldn’t
Cas helps him upstairs later, and then helps him into the shower, perching on the counter to make sure he doesn’t fall as Dean washes himself off without really caring about the results. He then helps Dean back to bed once he’s dressed, making sure he props his foot up.
“Please tell me you are out the door? Your son is about to have a nervous breakdown…” Cas begins and Dean smiles reassuringly, hoping Cas can feel it through the phone.
“I don’t remember. I didn’t read the label.”
“We’ll get it later.” Dean soothed, pulling out onto the main street, heading back to the house. He’d have to call the garage and tell them he had to take off - there was no way he could leave Danny at home by himself and Cas wouldn’t be done until after his office hours.
Dean steps forward, Danny walking with him, and kisses Cas firmly over Faith’s head.
His head swam with things.
He lies still in the bed, breathing, letting his body catch up, and is surrounded by the faint chords of Cas at the piano.
“No.”
Lakes hide secrets.

Love of many miracles, fearful love, oh my catfish.

“I’m not the one with ten pounds of Corgi on my head. How’s it all working out for you?”
“Done?” He asks, pulling the plate towards his placemat, and she nods enthusiastically, but picks up her milk again, taking another long drag and then breathing heavily again, grinning when it makes Dean laugh like it does every time. Cas says she does it because that’s what Dean does after a long day – he takes a drink and sighs and she picked up on it. Dean doesn’t care where it came from, it’s just about the cutest thing ever – well, everything Faith does is the cutest thing ever. She smacks her lips and wipes her mouth with her napkin harshly and he just grins and shakes her head at her. “You ready for your bath? We gotta get changed for the recital tonight, so we can look really good for your brother.”
The king cried:
Dean had fumbled, but eventually, picked up and then it was nothing but that same song and that same dance and that pretty girl tossing her head, laughing at him and his concentrated faces.
“Ok, we’re off!” Cas says, holding the door open as Daniel darts out the door. Dean waves to them from the kitchen table where he is currently trying to coax Faith into eating left over grilled chicken and squash.
He almost doesn’t notice the angel in the room, but when he stalls at the bottom of the stairs, he must look utterly surprised. It doesn’t last, and his face quickly melts into a smile.
i am waiting on the sand
Faith climbed onto the recliner, and curled all 5'5" of herself onto Dean’s lap, her head knocking his until she wiggled down,  finally situated on his shoulder.
“Almost - Danny, look here, hey! Say ‘hey uncle Sammy!’” Danny swivels his head back and forth between Dean and Cas, blinking his big eyes before looking up at Cas, his brow furrowing, grunting as he tries to push up again and then collapses with a sigh.
nice.” Dean laughed, grinning, and Cas’s eyebrows fell as he came closer. He popped the top off of the girly ass packaging and unsealed the container, glancing up at Cas as he did so. Cas had crept closer, hesitating on the edge of the bed with curious eyes before finally slipping forward and taking the container out of Dean’s hand. He tugged the cord on the bedside lamp and read the side quickly, his eyebrows shooting up with every word.
unused to your clumsy legs
on you!” Danny whined. “I wanna play!”
Castiel seems to consider this and Faith stirs, whimpering, and Cas can feel his resolve crumbling because he’s exhausted and worried.
“Cas, where the hell is my slice of pie?”
the rocking chair rocks, “
“That’s because it’s
it, little man.” Dean assures him, planting a kiss on his cheek before setting him down. Cas kisses Dean.
across him
“Hey, monkey, you drink my powerade?” Daniel called over his shoulder, addressing his sister. Faith scoffed and rolled her head dramatically against Dean’s shoulder.
“Whose a good girl! Come on Cas! Polly says it’s time to get up now!”
“That hurts, I bet.” Dean says softly, and Faith hiccups, starting to calm down. Cas meets them inside and pushes her hair back over her now sticky cheeks.
Cas turned to Dean at that moment and looked at him. He was checking his watch, obviously worrying over getting the car out before parade traffic got bad. Cas’s heart swelled, the squirming got worse, the feeling of his throat getting tight with a sensation he could now identify as the peculiarly human expression of
, he replied, which wasn’t a lie.
“Just me, I’m afraid…” Cas joked, earning a laugh from Dean as he shifted, relishing the pull of he and Dean’s hips against each other in a casual brush. He considered where to go next for a few moments and then leaned forward. “Here…” He said, and he dipped his finger in again and then carefully penned ‘C-A-S’ across Dean’s chest, his finger lingering over where he could feel Dean’s heartbeat and the stretch of his skin as he breathed.
They commanded, and so he burned.
That’s what it’s about.
“Love you.”
When Dean walked into the nurse’s office he instantly spotted Daniel. He was hunched over on a plastic chair, a trash can between his knees, and the most pitiful expression Dean had ever seen on a teenage boy.
Sam would probably be the last person to be surprised, however, if you were to tell him the actual truth.
“ARGH!” Dean says, pushing the boat as she squeaks the rubber parrot toy and makes some kind of awful, hysterical, bird noise to accompany it. He backs off as she splashes her hands in the water, so Dean quickly gives her a wash cloth doused with soap for her to rub on her arms and on her belly.
. It plays through his head over and over, this endless loop of pleasure and the scratch of Dean’s stubble on his own, his toes curling up and relaxing.
Camels, and elephants, and horses. Enough salt to fill an ocean. Enough salt to spread on slushed city streets. To fill bullet cartridges with.
eat that pie. I was saving it for myself, and if you even think about eating it…CAS!” Dean hissed as Cas slowly began to put the fork in his mouth, sucking the prongs, still staring at Dean. He chewed.
“I meant this whole ‘you love me I love you thing’ we’ve got going on.” He smiles, “You work it well.”
“Your children are beautiful.” Inias mumbles. “Faith and Daniel? They are very precious." Castiel turns to his former soldier and his face shines with pride.
“Ok, then.” Dean nods, looking his son straight in the eye, “I think you’re ready for Halloween, little man.”
“My little birds feeling better after your bath?”
“Well, I guess it’s fine since when you eat it you internalize the message,” Cas explained, chuckling a little.
“Love you more than the moon.” Dean repeated, falling asleep with the feeling of Daniel’s foot kicking at his, all of the crammed on the bed like sardines.
Proud and ancient love – my sequoia love.
i will be his road
He remembered the first time he saw a raft - sticks and wood and leaves thrashed together. Voyagers setting off on oceans full of salt and full of waves that came one after the other. Rafts that broke apart, obliterated, in the fist of the water, swirled into oblivion.
They were in front of the Macy’s, Dean shuffling bags around like some kind of juggler. It didn’t help that Cas was pointedly
“Yeah, sure.” Dean yawns, “Whatever…”
After a moment though, Cas went right back to zoning out, watching something intently across the street. Giving up on getting him to hold anything else, Dean followed Cas’s persistent gaze instead, and what he saw surprised him.
“You think about me?”  He breathes, suddenly needing to know, and Castiel ignores it, kissing, and snakes his tongue around in Dean’s mouth, lips plying over his, and Dean let’s his hands fall down to his ass, gripping in a squeeze and Castiel hikes himself up, his front scraping on Dean’s abs.
Cas starts to breathe deep again, and he knows he’s asleep for real this time, and Dean isn’t far behind him. It’s warm and the TV is on and it’s just about as close to bliss as Dean’s ever gotten, he thinks, even when Cas sighs in sleep and his stubble scratches on his collar bone. Even with two sick kids.
Dean gives in, falls to the ground, and rolls, Danny on top of him, still trying to get at the football. Faith watches in concern and then laughs, running a few clumsy steps and giggling, Polly ever the shepherd, making sure she doesn’t stray.
“But I ruined your pie.” Cas said blandly, jerking his face away for a third encounter. He studied Dean’s face, watching his fiancee shrug.
Dean hadn’t meant anything by it when he dropped the towel on Cas’s head, initially.
The star replied.
“Just don’t see why you and Cas always have to be into that sissy crap.”
Danny doesn’t even complain about the prospect of it and as he dumps them both into the tub they both seem too groggy to protest as he helps them wash off all the sick of the day. When he helps them back out they smell heavenly – baby shampoo and that sweet smell of their body wash as he mops water off of them with towels.
Dean feels that delicious heat and Cas throws his arms up, draws them close together, his knees over Dean’s elbows.
Cas lifts his head and plows it into the down, rubbing his face on the ivory fabric as he moves his foot and rakes the blankets upwards to fold over them.
Danny, no monkey business.”
"Dean,
shoves him off.
Dean smirked.
In a blink.
“When Sammy was little my Dad would drive him around in the Impala when he wouldn’t go down. Worked like a charm.”
“What?!” She exclaims, still half bent over the arm of the chair, her hand now resting against his. She grins uncertainly. “What is it?”
The bruja closes her eyes and then opens them again, a cobweb escaping as she tilts her head.
“Ain’t we a pair.” He whispered, sitting up to reach over and turn off the light. He pulled the remote towards him and flicked on the tv, laying next to Cas, not moving when Cas rolled over onto him and sleep talked something unintelligible, his nose smushed into Dean’s chest, an arm thrown lazily over Dean in a loose, clinging, hug.
will you recognize me now, holy one? will you look down and see me? i do not gleam any longer, i am no polished amber stone, i am no sharp spike of porcupine quill, i am no longer the glance of a catfish as it flicks through the water.
and wrap my silk arms
Cas snorts and wraps arms around Dean’s neck before staring deeply into his eyes.
“What kind?”
he could engage with Dean that Dean also never seemed to realize. It became – not an obsession –but something of a game that Castiel played with Dean that Dean had no idea about. The game was, how could Castiel, as subtly and gracefully as possible, get Dean into positions that Cas could appreciate the most. Of course, Castiel could reason, this was all innocent. Dean had a beautiful body. Cas had
“I’m still here, and that’s something.” He adds  quietly, and for a moment it’s hard to believe that he isn’t anything  but Dean’s Cas, pointedly staring at Dean, trying to get some cryptic thought across. He doesn't smile, but he sounds pleasant enough when he addresses the heap of man that formerly was Dean Winchester.
“See you at home.” Cas whispers to him before Daniel drags him off to his own car.
hands, for i have no need of them; they are already yours.
“Ok?”
“Polly, no…” Cas laughed as Polly sniffed experimentally at the box of animal crackers and then looked at him sadly. Cas shook his head and reached patted his thigh, standing so she’d follow him like always, a constant shadow. “Not for puppies!” He exclaimed, retreating from the fort. Polly rubbed her nose against his leg and he dropped to a crouch again, petting her and scratching her ears, planting her with kisses right between her eyes and on her long nose.
“Dean, it’s not a big deal.” Cas started, only to have Dean look over his shoulder and raise his eyebrows.
“T-they h-hurt your foot. The bad guys. They hurt your foot, I’m sorry they hurt your foot, Daddy.” She chokes, kissing him again, “I’ll make it better. I’ll make it better, Daddy.”
Cas doesn’t respond, moving to rummage through the cabinets, already on auto-pilot. Dean watches for a moment before Faith leans her groggy head back.
She smiled, toothless, and made a little wiggle as she patted the towel.
i will be his bed
Dean grinned at him, tapping his side.
the magpies scatter
They eat their donuts on a spread of paper towels, even though crumbs still get on the carpet and stick to Faith’s mouth, but it’s worth it to do Daniel’s favorite part with him and see him laugh so hard he nearly chokes.
, but that was tortuous because then Dean had to coax him out of it and while that usually led to very satisfying ends, the build up was unfathomably irritating.
“Ok, well, the first thing you do is - ”
They would never know a rainy afternoon, or the strange sounds of infants when they called your secret names, the ones you recognized but could never translate.
They got thumbs, and object permanence, and sentience. They could think, and dream, and paint with oils, and make graffiti, and use electric sanders and table salt. They spun their fur into rope and climbed out of the cage.
Seeing Cas makes it easy for Dean to give in, not that he was one to deprive himself when he
“Is that it? Is that papa’s plane?!” Daniel cries and Dean lets himself grin, because by god, he’s excited too. Relieved, and exhausted after a week alone, but mostly excited.
Dean braces himself best he can, grimaces, and holds out tired, heavy, arms to stop her.
“…Daddy was a seed, and I had to make sure he grew into a big tree.” He begins, Danny staring at him in the growing twilight. “So when I fell down – a long way down – he would be big enough to catch me.”
"Monkey, come on, it’s ok.” He tells her over and over and she lifts her face from  his t-shirt only to pepper him with kisses.
Cas hums along with the record and Dean holds him closer, brushing their foreheads together. He closes his eyes, tries to hear the song the way that Cas does.
“Well, I see you two are getting along!” Dean interrupts, going to around the couch to sit down on Danny’s other side. Danny squeals and Dean brushes a fine baby hair out of his face, tickling him and then settling back to reevaluate the score on the baseball game currently playing out on tv.
(polly is a corgi raven & i gave them at one point)
Dean rolls his head back, already starting to let the uneasiness go. It’s hard to be worried when Cas is working hands under the hem of his shirt.
“You heard me.” Dean repeats, staring at his son. “You’re going to make a silly face at your sister or you’re going to get it.”
She huffs and rolls her eyes, tossing her head, stray hairs once again stuck to her face. She bats them away and Cas laughs louder.
“I’m fine.” He kind of sobs, but he doesn’t mean to say that, and the tears are starting to really blur up the view he has out the windshield. He gasps, “I’m fine.”
“Yeah, I know.” Dean tells Cas, even though he knows that he’s just speaking out loud to remind himself. Cas says something to someone and then focuses on Dean again, and Dean can hear in the background the chatter of parents and children and some kind of distorted Christmas song.
“I’ll be right there.”
your body
A kiss; sforzando.
and lift your hand
The man said.
“Daddy I’m tired.” Danny wheezes after a moment, nuzzling his face into Dean’s hand.
Faith giggled and rubbed her eye, pulling it back to make sure no mascara had come off.
Castiel, instead, while passing out candy, offers them suggestions, receiving blank stares as he does.
“Excellent.” He remarked and he and Dean stepping in time again. There was a huge spot of glare from the guard rail by the path, protecting the walkers from slipping down the sharp bank on the other side, leading down to the pond, but other than that Cas was extremely satisfied by his subject. He quickly saved it to the memory card the way Sam had showed him, looking up in surprise only as Dean once again tugged him out of the way of a lamp post, herding him back towards his body.
“He’s gonna be up on the stage, baby doll. He’s gonna sing to you!”
“Tell me what you thought about…” Dean implores, begging the question.
Faith rocks back and forth on her heels, balancing against the back of the tall backed chair Cas is currently employing as he thumbs through the musty-smelling volume on his lap.
“Fuck, baby.” Dean cries, “Fuck, fuck.” And Cas let’s his hands fall to Dean’s shoulders, squeezing, until one moves down to his thigh where Dean’s own unoccupied hand is positioned for leverage. Cas’s fingers wrap around Dean’s and squeeze in time, and he stares up at Dean’s face, eyes wide. He doesn’t say anything, but his mouth is slack and open and he huffs with Dean, the two of them slamming together.
Dean thinks he could probably watch it forever, the people milling about all around them, the sound of the intercom blasting Christmas music above their heads.
bring me his heart, anointed with sorrow, flushed
“Charlie!” His mother said, the exasperation obviously forced as she came to smooth his forehead and kiss his red cheeks and nose, the father grinning. “Stay with daddy and mommy!”
at it. Shoes and socks and Dean shakes his head at the very notion that at some point in his natural life he’d be putting white shocks and mary janes on a three year old on the way to his eight year old’s school tree trimming extravaganza or what not.
Danny whimpered and Dean shook his head and went forward to yank back his covers and help him in bed.
The next batch makes Dean laugh out loud though - Cas’s expertise in the area of the undead is extensive after the apocalypse, so as he puts the candy aside to appraise the children’s obviously amateur makeup with direct scrutiny, Dean has to grin at the absurdity. The poor kids look honestly scared and walk quickly away, throwing wary stares over their shoulders as they go.
“Yeah, baby. Come on. Show me.”
Cas pauses and Danny makes a little tiny noise, the turn of a page, “
Danny holds his free hand and keeps rubbing his red-rimmed eyes with the back of his other.
“Oh, oh, oh! Hey!” Dean soothes, pulling her up against him, settling her on his hip, inspecting the hurts on her hands. He turns them over and then looks at her knees - scraped but not bleeding, but it will probably bruise on the soft baby skin.He brushes his thumb over her fingers.
She sighs, satisfied and then settles against him, a finger going into her mouth.
“Yeah. I don’t even know.”
“Woah!” He yells, striding quickly to catch up with her. He knew he should have rinsed her plate before letting her out, but it’s almost six and the recital starts at seven thirty.
"Dean I should be able to do this - I should, and -”
.” He grumbles, marching out the door and into the hallway.
“A couple of hours.”
for both of them. Faith sits dazed and uncomfortable on the counter, rubbing her face, her hair matted down her back, sporting the same pj’s she’s worn since yesterday. Danny isn’t in much better shape. He pulls away from Dean and goes to Cas, standing beside him, humming another low whine, scrubbing at his stuffy nose. Faith coughs and it’s wet and nasty and Dean’s heard that cough and knows it’ll take at least a week for it to leave completely.
can you hear me?
“But a man can’t be in love with a star, either.” Leticia comments, and the bruja shrugs her old, bony, shoulders.
“Oh, Dean, oh you do. You already do.”
“Yeah.” He bends his head ever so slightly to nuzzle against Dean’s wrist. “I know.”
The end of the song comes too soon and everyone applauds before the families of Mrs. Raven’s class stand and shuffle in a line to greet their children.
“Dean, don’t let me forget.” He whispers and Dean takes a long deep breath.
And when Cas has his own food he slumps down in his chair at the table and sticks his legs out to put them back on Dean’s knees, munching his granola and yogurt and watching the birds outside, just over Dean’s shoulder, not saying much, still waking up.
“That’s my favorite part too.” Dean adds and Daniel nods.
my love was asleep.
“…calm down or I’m going to put you in your room.”
The king sought light, and so they found it.
“Where they go?” She says between bites of chicken, ketchup on her fingers. Dean doesn’t bother wiping her hands, knowing she’ll just get more on her once he’s done. He settles for brushing the fine baby-hairs off of her forehead and tucking them behind her tiny little ear. She chomps her chicken and continues to stare at him. “Da! Where they
.  He looked back at Dean, and blushed.
“Dean, where are my mint Oreos?”
“Really?” Cas grumbles before kissing him again, Dean pushing him up on the workbench next to the radio that still spits honky tonk jukebox tunes, Cas’s knees knocking on Dean’s sides.
“Hey…” Dean says softly, coming in, and Cas looks up, suddenly alert, like he shouldn’t be caught like this. He starts wiping frantically at his eyes and Dean leans over Daniel and makes Cas stop.
“Nee! Nee!” She cries and then Cas and Dean shush her because the kids are filing onto the stage and standing in front of the standing microphones. Some of them look like they could throw up from nerves, but Dean is too delighted that Daniel is staring straight at them and grinning like a maniac. He waves to the camera and Faith squeals again like mad, clambering into Dean’s lap to see better. Dean bounces her on his legs as she says her shortened version of ‘Danny’ over and over, whispering it when Dean tells her to be extra quiet.
“Yeah. Yes.”
He breathes as deep as he can and encourages the lion to try again, because it’s all he can do.
“Let em’ eat in there. It’s Halloween.”
“I don’t know how we’re going to get her down.” Cas whispers. “She hasn’t slept at all today, and you know she didn’t last night either. She was coughing too much, and she wouldn’t settle, even when I went in there.” Dean watches him tiredly press his head on Faith’s, and he unconsciously starts doing it – the swaying thing. Back and forth, whenever he holds her, just twisting his hips side to side, and she huffs in response. It’s true – with Dean working the next day, Cas had gotten up to lay with her, but she had coughed and cried and carried on until morning where she drifted in a stupor for hours, shivery and sick. Dean watches the movement that Cas always does, one undeterred even by his tiredness, before the idea dawns on him.
Luckily, Dean knew the exact recipe for diffusing the wrath of an ex soldier-of-God-Almighty:
“I don’t know how we’re going to get her down.” Cas whispers. “She hasn’t slept at all today, and you know she didn’t last night either. She was coughing too much, and she wouldn’t settle, even when I went in there.” Dean watches him tiredly press his head on Faith’s, and he unconsciously starts doing it – the swaying thing.

Dean watches the movement that Cas always does, one undeterred even by his tiredness, before the idea dawns on him.
“Papa?”
She looks up and claps her hands together. Dean sticks his tongue at her and then goes back to the road, traffic blessedly light for the time of day.
“Don’t like you getting so put-out. Wanted to distract you. It worked, didn’t it?”
Bleached gold grain of the valley, my song of the white dove, my tiger-eyed love.
He pawed at Dean’s legs, little fingers scratching over his denim-covered jeans, wiggling to be in between them. Dean let him, and tried to thumb through the parenting magazine that the office provided. It was thoroughly unconvincing. The kids in the pictures were all way too clean.
“I love you.” Cas sighs, awake for a moment, and Dean sinks back into the pillows, yawning.
“Hot, hot don’t touch it!” Cas says automatically, putting it on the counter and Dean smiles, pulling a donut off the tray to eat one, thick and cakey and warm.
have been.
"It’s awesome,” Dean repeated against Cas’s mouth before abandoning him for two plates and a knife to cut it with. He stared at the pie. “I feel bad for messing it up!” Dean exclaimed, and Cas laughed, pulling the knife away, making an even slice.
“A stone, ladies and gents, a simple stone, like any stone you’d find in your cobbled street,” he tosses it in his hand. “Do you know the joke about God on the hill? It’s a good joke- God meets Death hill and gives him two rocks! No wonder we all die, right? Shitty gift if you ask me…”
“Jesus.” Dean whispered, pushing his head back down onto the covers, stretching his legs out
a girl with blue eyes
“Daddy, I wanna fly planes!” Daniel nearly shouts as Dean helps him back into his sneakers, all three of them having cleared the x-ray. He glances at Faith and is relieved that she’s playing with his keys in her stroller, quite fascinated by them. Now if he can just keep them in her hands and off of the floor…
For four days it had been this way, and by that Thursday, Cas was at his breaking point and Dean knew that he would need to do something and do it fast or Cas was going to end up throwing the bitch fit of the century.
“Papa says we’ll watch it at Christmas with Uncle Sammy and Grampa. You think they’ll like it?”
“Dean - what?” Was all Cas could say, trying to unhinge his fingers from Dean’s shirt before it tore. Dean smiled, as if what he’d just done was the most natural reaction to Castiel’s apology, which it certainly
To discover how to say the words
“Ohhhh, you are in so much trouble when I get my hands on you…” Dean said lowly and Cas licked his lips suggestively, still fighting a grin.
She smiled in approval and the door slammed towards the back of the house and both of them listened to the familiar sound of Danny slinging his soccer bag into the laundry room.
Dean blinks at him.
“Everything.”
“Faith’s going to get crumbs everywhere…”
“Where are her shoes?”
“Just went off at 100.” Cas replies, just as Dean reads over the numbers, placing it over by the sink as a little body bumps against him.  “Danny’s too…”
“Daddy?” He looks down at her and loosens his grip on her arm, brings his hand up to cup her cheek. She’s only eight, he reminds himself. She doesn’t get it. She blinks at him, confused, and he rubs his thumb on her face, brushes it just under her eye.
Castiel replied, remembered when his Father scrapped the old plan.
“That makes me uncommonly happy,” Cas murmured, getting distracted by another kiss.
Cas shakes his head, slowly, side to side.
“Daddy said you picked him. You picked him up from the ground like a flower!”
“I know you don’t understand, and that’s alright.” Castiel says reassuringly. “I don’t expect you to."
Castiel scratched at his skull, mortified, as Sam laughed.
I caught you, my love like a king fisher, oh my catfish.
“Yeah, we’re just about to hit the road – Faith can you click that sweetheart? Yeah we’re about to leave.”
He had just been walking by with laundry when he did it, just to be cheeky, and he had pulled the big brown towel out of the basket and flung it so that it covered Cas’s face, startling a surprised ‘ah’ out of the former in the angel in the process.
