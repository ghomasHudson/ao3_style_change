when he found them. Downstairs again, he found the bedroom dark and Sherlock already beneath the covers.
, Mycroft Holmes, then it is not your brother that is being the immature little boy. You stay away from
Sherlock raised grateful eyes to his flatmate. John smiled in response and nodded; no words needed to be exchanged. It was not easy for Sherlock to say thanks, so the look in his eyes was more than John expected.
“You look wonderful,” Molly murmured shyly, and Sherlock dipped his head and touched his chest over his heart in thanks.
“Don’t stop,” John now pleaded. He could feel a tremendous build up in his entire body, the blood from his hands and feet and head shunting to his groin, making every nerve ending between Sherlock’s hands electrified. He shouted out as he came, black spots appearing before his vision, his body shuddering, and John rode the aftershocks, floating, not wanting to come down, not wanting it to end.
“Easy there,” he whispered. With some difficulty, he pulled on a new top and eased him down onto a fresh, cool pillow. Sherlock was out…a deep, restful sleep, long limbs loose, face relaxed, chest collapsing then rising again in perfect rhythm. John cleaned up the used bandages, collected the bucket and towels, and left the room. In the kitchen he put everything away, the opened the new refrigerator and stared at its contents.
And indeed he did. John numbed the area with a local anesthetic, drained, flushed, and rebandaged the area. Both men were sweating and shaking at the end, but John carried on, providing Sherlock with a cooling sponge bath, fresh sheets again, and a broth dinner with a side of more scones. It was Sherlock that directed John, with his fevered, sunken eyes, to pull the cot over and sleep there that night.
John shook his head, breaking his mournful gaze at his cell phone. It would be just him and Sherlock now, and for a while. The man’s injuries would take months to completely heal. The ring of the doorbell made him start, and he opened the door to a delivery man holding flowers.
“How about a compromise…I just do a trim,” John finally relented. Sherlock gave a quick jerk of his head, then remembering he didn’t like to nod, texted:
“Excellent.” John took a step back and nodded, then glanced at his watch. “Three hours in now. At least another three. Help yourself to a sandwich. We have some ways to go.”
There’s an awkward silence between them for a moment, permeated only by the sound of the ticking of Sherlock’s watch and the gentle flickering of the flames in the fireplace. Sherlock doesn’t know what to make of John’s response; no one has ever reacted to him like that. He feels that very fragile flicker inside of him again, something like hope, but he studiously ignores it, knowing there’s no sense in giving in to it.
“You’ll have another opportunity to make a choice,” Sherlock says. “An important one. When it comes, I think you’ll be ready.”
A huff of laughter comes from Sherlock, and John turns his head to glance at him, smiling a bit at the sound.
, John thinks, even though he’s certain there are more important things he should be worried about, like the fact that his coworker is being introduced to his friend, the skull.
John gives him a thin smile. “Afghanistan,” he says. He hesitates, and then tilts his head a bit. “I was just going for a bit of a walk, would you like to come?”
Sherlock shrugs.  “I could give you more advice if you want to add it to the cost to your work,” he says.
“Mmm?” John replies, stroking Sherlock’s cheek with his thumb, hoping to reassure him. His heart beats fast in his chest, worry beginning to tug at his mind.
Mary stares at him for a moment, her eyes coated by a thin sheen of tears. Her lip quivers but she holds it steady and takes a deep breath. “I’m moving,” she tells him after a moment. “I can’t be here anymore; I’ve ruined enough lives. It’s time to go somewhere new, maybe outside of England.”
Sherlock watches him, sees the openness of his face, and blinks again. “Perfect,” he parrots, and then turns back to his microscope, not taking in anything on the slide.
“No,” Sherlock says. He sounds a bit threatening, and John’s not sure what to make of it. “Let’s see what kind of fortuneteller is here now.”
It’s pouring outside, and John holds his umbrella as close to his head as possible, hunching his shoulders to become as small as possible underneath it, his sodden grocery bag dripping onto his already wet feet. He’s on his way home from work – he still hasn’t mustered up the energy to quit his job – and he has stopped at the grocery store, knowing they have very little to eat in the flat.
John’s arm shifts and curls around Sherlock’s upper back, and then he lets his fingers sleepily toy with Sherlock’s hair.  This elicits a sleep-worn and rough hum of pleasure from Sherlock, and he instinctively presses his head towards John’s fingers.
“It’s alright. It’s inevitable, after all,” Sherlock says, taking a sip of tea and appearing unconcerned. “Have you been wearing the ring?”
A sharp, loud cry interrupts them a few moments later, and Sherlock is startled into a laugh against John’s neck. If it’s a slightly wet laugh, neither of them acknowledges it, and when he brings his head up to look at John, neither of them acknowledges the redness of John’s eyes, either. Instead, they kiss once more, soft and gentle, and John cups his face and sweeps his thumbs along Sherlock’s cheekbones, presses a kiss against the corner of his mouth, one more soft and lingering on his cheek, one more just below his ear, one more on his temple, until Iris’ cries really can’t be ignored.
Sherlock looks around, taking in the brightly colored art on the walls and the high spacious windows, the big fireplace that heats the entryway, the sconces lining the walls. “Wow,” he murmurs, craning his head back to look up at the rafters in the high ceiling.
gain the element of surprise and get a small lead as they run towards the tree in the clearing, but John’s not sure what will happen once they get there, and he’s terrified. The spirits are getting closer behind them, and some are even flying over their heads, all saying that humans shouldn’t be here, that they should die, that they’d make a nice feast.
Sherlock shoves his hands in his pockets and turns to leave, clearly in some kind of snit, and John sighs and musters up the energy to follow along as usual.
John stops on the stairs in surprise, and the woman rolls her eyes as she gets to the top before him and opens the door. “Honestly, Sherlock, you should wait until the door is open to speak,” she chides to whoever is on the other side of the door, her posture changing to that of a stern mother before she turns back to John, whose body is catching up to her without his permission. She smiles kindly again, and John is a bit taken aback by the sudden change in her demeanor.
John doesn’t watch, knowing that Sherlock is handing over the mirror.  Mycroft takes it with a murmur of thanks, and John is glad not to watch the exchange.
She smiles, picking up a newspaper on her side table and waving it a bit. “The paper says it’ll be clear all day. Nice weather we’ve been having recently, isn’t it?”
“I do,” she says. “I thought I might as well invite you and save you the trouble of planning subterfuge.”
John straddles Sherlock’s hips. He carefully cleans off Sherlock’s stomach, then runs his fingers up and down Sherlock’s sides and just looks at him. Sherlock shivers again, his flesh twitching against the feather-light touch of John’s fingers, and John smiles, then leans down to press a kiss against his chest, right below his scar. John rests his cheek there for a moment and wedges his forearms under Sherlock’s shoulder blades, holding him close though the position has to be uncomfortable, and Sherlock lets his hands rest on John’s back. They stay that way for a moment before John sits up and smiles at him once more. Sherlock drapes his hands over John’s thighs and John squeezes them, and then gets off the bed, going back to the loo.
“John,” Sherlock greets, barely glancing at him. He seems uncomfortable, if the way he’s avoiding eye contact means anything.
He picks it up and lays it on the table once more, letting his hands smooth over the texture of the case, before reverently opening it. He picks up the violin and plucks it, then grimaces, his spine involuntarily twisting in a need to physically compensate for how out of tune the strings are. He plucks the A string and wrinkles his nose, then carefully tries to turn the tuning peg. He braces himself when it doesn’t turn as easily as he’d like, and carefully applies just enough force to get it going before he brings it up to where it should be and then carefully adjusts the fine tuner. He tunes the D and G strings next, but when he gets to the E string, the most out of tune, it snaps as he tightens it.
He looks as best he can down the tunnels to his left and right, but he can’t see anything besides black walls and darkness. It’s the same in front of him, and he has a moment of panic, wondering which way to go. He can see himself getting desperately lost, unable to find Sherlock
“He doesn't like Mary. Neither does Mycroft,” John admits. He feels guilty saying this out loud, voicing the doubts that swirl in his mind.
“My pocket?” John says with a frown, not sure what it could be.  He stands up and rifles through for a moment – keys, loose change – and then he pulls out the end of the arrow Sherlock had put in there.  “This?” John asks, holding out the arrow to the little fox boy.
He’s not sure how long they stay like that, but he thinks he could stay like that forever and it would be alright. He doesn’t want to move, doesn’t want John’s fingers to leave his hair, doesn’t want John’s hand to stop moving up and down his back and shoulders. He sighs, though, and lets his tired arms drop to rest on his knees and then circles them loosely around the back of John’s thighs.
Moriarty raises his eyebrows. “Oh, you’re a feisty one, aren’t you? No wonder Sherlock keeps you around; it must be fun. He’s a lot like me, you know.”
A laugh bubbles out of him and he holds his glass out towards John, who has to help him adjust the angle and hold it upright before he can refill it.
John’s smile grows. It’s warm and gentle like the second movement of the Bruch, like the sound of four perfectly in tune strings, like a soaring melody, and it makes Sherlock’s eyes prickle.
John nods, and he lies down beside Sherlock on the floor. Sherlock takes off his crown and sets it beside him, and curls up on his side facing John, who is watching him fondly.
He lifts his head suddenly, staring at John with wide eyes, realizing exactly what’s just happened as his brain catches up to his body.
John gapes at him for a moment before his mind catches up to what Sherlock has said. “Oh, for god’s-”
“Get lots of rest,” Arthur says. He’s watching John with a frown, his brow furrowed. He looks extremely worried.
He opens his eyes after a moment and his mouth sets into a firm line. Carefully, he folds the bandana and shoves it in his pocket. He looks up and heads towards Sherlock’s bedroom, the soldier in him overtaking his stride. He has a mission, and he will damn well complete it.
Mummy clears her throat and shakes her head. “I think you had a very nice dream, dear. Why don’t we have some breakfast?”
After a moment, Sherlock urges John’s head up, and John is surprised to see the look of intent on Sherlock’s face.
She stares at it and there’s a brief moment, just a second too long, where John is left wondering if he’s made a mistake, but then she smiles and loops her arm through his.  “I’ve never been to an archery tournament before,” she says.  “It was actually pretty interesting.”
John pulls away after a moment and Sherlock stoops down a bit, leaning his forehead against John’s and closing his eyes, willing John to stay close.  John tangles his fingers into the curls on the back of Sherlock’s head and lets his thumb sweep back and forth across Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock smiles, a small little twist of his lips, and John shifts to press a chaste kiss on his mouth.
Sherlock laughs, a sudden burst of whimsy that takes John by surprise, and then he’s chuckling, too.
“I’m not sick, Daddy! It really happened!” He feels panic rising inside him, and he doesn’t know what to do.
“Sherlock,” Dad says. His voice is warm, but Sherlock’s head hurts and it only makes him feel worse.
“I woke up and I wanted to see you, but I went home first. I wanted to get a few things, you know, some other clothes, but the king found me. He said I couldn’t just keep going between your world and ours, and that if I went back, that would be the last time.” John clears his throat, looking up at the tree for a moment, then back at Sherlock. “I didn’t care; I didn’t have anything in that world. I decided to go to you, but when I tried to come back without you, I ended up in the wrong place. I ended up all alone in London, and I didn’t know how to find you and I didn’t have any magic anymore. It was scary; I couldn't tell anyone the truth about me because they would think I was crazy, so the police and the doctors thought I had amnesia and eventually someone adopted me.”
“Thank you, John, I’ll endeavor to remember such important information,” Sherlock says dryly. He’s begun impatiently pacing while he waits for John. “Now fulfill your little ritual and pour your coffee and drink it and tell me what happened already.” He waves a flippant hand through the air and occasionally glances at John in impatience.
Mrs. Hudson stands next to him and puts her hand on his shoulder. “When Sherlock says he can do it, he can do it,” she says, squeezing his shoulder. She sounds confident and proud.
Arthur frowns, the many wrinkles in his face shifting downwards. “You’re sick,” he says. Anxiety creeps into his voice, and John feels guilty to cause him worry.
!” Sherlock says. His voice is rising, and his breath is getting faster. “It happened! I want John! I want my nutcracker! I want him now! Please, he’s my
“John,” she gasps. “John, John.” Her chest is heaving with the speed of her breath and it’s too much, the pleasure too intense.
John smiles. It’s tender, and Sherlock’s throat feels raw and there’s a burning in his sinuses he wants to ignore and can’t. “You’re brilliant,” John murmurs. “You really are. And bloody gorgeous.”
“Just a bit,” she says. “The bus schedule is so hard to predict; I was afraid I’d be late if I left any later. You know how it is.”
Sherlock nods, confident and certain, and they look at each other for a moment, a long moment in which John seems to be assessing Sherlock’s confidence, before John nods once, lets out a breath, and lies down, looking up at the ceiling, and Sherlock is left feeling grateful, pleased that John is letting him do this.
John remembers last time they met suddenly, and he manages a wet laugh. “I’m not,” he insists. “You don’t need to be upset.”
John looks at him in disbelief.  “Aren’t you his archenemy?  Why is he sending his archenemy to meet me?”
“‘The present world is dream. Dreams at night are truth.’ Do you remember that, John? From Molly’s house?”
“One hundred and ten,” Sherlock says. “I was born in the other world, the world where Mycroft lives. When I was young, I lived there, but we had a house here, too. Our parents – they wanted us to experience both worlds; the spirit world, and the mortal one.”
He looks up and smiles; it’s Uncle Augustus! He rushes forward, but he’s stopped when Mycroft pulls him back by the arm. “Hey!” he shouts in annoyance, trying to tug his arm out of Mycroft’s grasp.
“Of course, dear, I was just going downstairs, anyway,” she says. John can’t help but think she’s rather agreeable. But then, isn’t he, as well?
“Perfect!” John says, and Sherlock smiles in agreement, watching as John carefully folds the belt and slides it into his pocket. “It’s our pact,” John adds.
John closes his eyes and brings his hand up to Sherlock’s neck. He lets his fingers twist into the curls there, and his heart clenches. “Tell me what to do,” he says. “Please, Sherlock.”
John’s lips curl into a small smile and then he kisses Sherlock in response, sighing into the kiss when Sherlock presses gently against John’s back with his palm, pulling John closer. John slides his hand under Sherlock’s pajama shirt, lets his fingers drift over the smooth skin of Sherlock’s side, opens his mouth, lets his tongue slide into Sherlock’s mouth as Sherlock shivers and loses the rhythm of the kiss for a moment.
all of this, and so he acts. He has no idea what he’s doing, but one of his shaking hands reaches up and cups the back of John’s head, his hair like heaven against Sherlock’s fingers, and something ignites in his stomach. He lowers his head, his wet lips brushing against John’s.
When at last they arrive at Baker Street, John pays as quickly as he can with slightly trembling hands and is out of the cab and inside as fast as his legs can take him.
As soon as they’re inside, the sounds he’d been hyper-aware of only moments before disappear into a blanket of silence. There’s no more gentle breeze, no more birds chirping or rustling grass; there is only bleak, all-encompassing silence. It’s cold, too, so cold that John already feels goose bumps breaking out on his skin. Redbeard nudges him, and John nods.
“I don’t know what any of this is,” John says, eyes trailing over Sherlock’s mostly classical library. He’s standing so close that Sherlock is very much aware of every centimeter of John’s body, and it does little to quell the nerves building in his stomach.
. His eyes linger on Sherlock’s mouth before flickering back up to his eyes and he smiles, welcoming the fear that flutters in his stomach. “You’re the one who can see people’s wishes, and you’ve seen mine.”
“Is that really so different?” Mycroft asks, a brow arched, and Sherlock stares at him quietly for a moment, then turns on his heel and walks towards the door.
John’s annoyed and he stares at Sherlock for a moment, retorts popping to the forefront of his mind, but he knows a lost battle when he sees one, and so he swallows them down. Instead, he turns to check his collar in the mirror above the fireplace, and sure enough, he can see Redbeard’s soft head peeking out over the checked fabric of his shirt. He puts his hand up and wiggles his fingers towards the little pipefox, who obediently leaves his neck to curl around them, and John fixes his collar properly with one hand.
“That’s alright.  Come on,” John says.  He braces a hand against the floor and stands, and Sherlock feels bereft as soon as John is no longer beside him.  He scrambles up to join him, and John smiles, takes him by the hand.  “Let’s clean up a bit and have a lie-in,” he says, leading Sherlock down the hall to the bathroom.
“Yes,” Sherlock says simply, his eyes still trained on the flow of the liquid, and John is in awe for a moment, wondering not for the first time exactly what kinds of things Sherlock can do. Inexplicably, he finds that his heart is beating a little bit faster.
John and Sherlock spend the whole night talking and eating sweets by the fire, giggling and learning about each other and having fun, but as the night wears on, they begin to yawn more and more until John suggests maybe it’s time to sleep.
John’s eyes widen and his hands shake, and Arthur turns to him. He’s different, almost translucent now. “Thank you, John. If you were my son, I’d be proud to call you my own. You reminded me what it’s like not to be lonely; I’d forgotten.”
But then he thinks of those long fingers on his face, and then he thinks of his own hand on Sherlock’s, and then he imagines Sherlock looking at him in shock and being jerked backwards into darkness, and something deep in his chest twists.
John holds Sherlock’s trousers up with one hand and lets the other roam up Sherlock’s chest, his thumb flicking over a nipple, and Sherlock twitches and his breath hitches and his head flops forward, seeking John and his mouth. John kisses him gently, and then lets go of Sherlock’s trousers. They pool around Sherlock’s feet, and John gently pushes Sherlock to the bed, urging him to sit down. Sherlock does, kicking his trousers off once he’s seated, and watching as John hastily undoes his own belt and shucks off his trousers. John grins at him and awkwardly takes off his socks, hopping a bit on one foot, and Sherlock smiles in spite of the fire currently consuming his insides and toes off his own. When John straightens, he’s standing there in just his pants, cock straining hard and thick inside of them, and Sherlock swallows, eyes drifting over every inch of him, eager to feel him, touch him, taste him, see him.
John tugs him by the arm away from the crosswalk, over to the fence outside the park. “Sherlock, you’re bloody soaked, you idiot,” John says. He sounds a bit concerned despite his annoyance, and he holds his umbrella over Sherlock’s head.
He’s not aware that John’s back until he feels fingers drifting through his hair. He makes a pleased, breathy sound and leans into the touch and then jolts back into awareness of himself, embarrassed, but John is looking down at him fondly, Iris cuddled into his hip and gurgling happily.
John takes his hand off Sherlock to lick his palm, and Sherlock feels that his brain must be offline because he can’t imagine why John is doing that until John reaches down and takes them both in hand, and he can’t help it, he
When they get to the edge, John’s limbs feel like lead weights and they shake with exhaustion. He feels dehydrated and cold and sick, but he can see the bright light of the sun up ahead filtering through the thinning layer of trees, and he swallows, his throat raw like sandpaper, hope flaring in his chest. He closes his eyes, reaching out in his mind to feel the tenuous connection to the hundreds of spirits of the forest.
“You’re amazing,” John says. His words are soft, reverent, and Sherlock swallows, shakes his head minutely, presses his face closer to John’s hand.
Molly enters a moment later, carrying a large instrument in her hands. It’s like nothing John’s ever seen before. She carefully sets it down on the table. In the center is a large basin filled with sand, hung by wires from a jewel on top. Hanging from the jewel is a pendulum, the tip of which is pointed, just touching the sand in the basin. On either side of the basin are handles, connected by a long piece of wood which runs under the basin and connects to the jewel on top.
Sherlock wrinkles his brow. “At walking next to you whilst you push the pram?” he asks. He’s genuinely confused.
Sherlock freezes, staring at John, his eyes flickering over John’s face, taking in the strong set of his jaw, the laser focus of his eyes, the small flicker in his eyebrows that shows he’s nervous despite his bravery. “What –
Sherlock’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline and his mouth falls slightly open. His brain is hung up on that one, because he hadn’t factored that into his possibilities. He didn’t want to, because it made him feel an uncomfortable mix of compassion and sadness for John, the unexpected sense of empathy making him reel a bit, but also
“Did you know you can only enter this shop if you have a wish?” Sherlock interrupts. “That’s why I told you not to invite Mary here; she had no wish, other than an ungrantable one about her very being, and so she wouldn’t have been able to see this building on Baker Street. To most people, 221B Baker Street doesn’t exist.”
“Anyway,” Sherlock interrupts pointedly before John can finish. “I’m not telling you where we’re going because I’d rather you experience it than listen to an explanation. I’m well aware you have the mental capacity to understand its description, but it’s a place and an experience to which words cannot do justice.” He pushes himself off the doorjamb and goes back into the kitchen, walking with a stiff posture that John knows means he’s irritated, but John’s not really bothered by that, not when he’s so irritated himself.
Greg smiles at him, and the corners of his eyes crinkle. “That’s not true,” he says. “You’re John Watson, after all.”
“I love you,” John says. The words are soft but firm, and they cut through Sherlock, straight to the core. He closes his eyes, forgets to breathe, feels as if he’s been stabbed. He hears John shifting beside, him, feels one of John’s hands come up to cup his face. “I love you,” John says again. The words are closer this time, and he can feel the warmth of John’s breath on his face.
John blinks in surprise at the non sequitur, then smiles, though it’s small. “Er - yeah. Yeah that would be – it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
Sherlock smiles, unable to look away from John. His heart is bursting; there is something bubbling up in his chest he never dreamed he would be able to feel, and he is struck by how handsome John is, by absurd thoughts like soul mates and fate and destiny. His smile grows and carefully, he reaches out and picks up the sash, while John takes the crown. He examines it, holding the old fabric in his hand, his heart pounding, blood rushing through his veins, imagining John’s thumb stroking over the very same fabric, and then he smiles wetly at John, unashamed of the tears that are brimming in his eyes, especially when John looks similarly overcome. John takes the belt from his hands and sets it on the coffee table, and carefully places the little crown on top.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and holds Billy out in front of him, staring at him intently. “Come on, then,” he tells him. “Let’s get ready for tonight.” He turns to John, tucking Billy under his arm. “We’ll be in 221C if you need us,” he says.
But as John watches, he sees Sherlock put away John’s favorite jam, and something twists in his chest. He goes to the kitchen, suddenly angry, and puts his bag on the table with a loud squelch.
John doesn’t know what this means, and right now, he doesn't care.  “Right – he made it, but how do I get to that woman from here?”
He tilts his jaw a bit and runs his free hand along Sherlock’s back, pulling Sherlock closer, enjoying the feel of sinewy muscle under his hands. Sherlock moans helplessly into the kiss, and John pulls him closer still. They can’t get any closer; it’s not possible.
Sherlock looks at him shrewdly and then reaches out, covering John’s forearm with his hand. He rests it there, and it’s heavy and warm, comforting like a blanket. “Of course not,” Sherlock says. “It was your choice, after all. You made the choice to see him even though it put your health at risk. I told you before that people can wish for anything, John; happiness or unhappiness, for example. We all have wishes. You chose what you wished for at the time. So did I.”
“Sherlock,” he repeats, voice firm, squeezing Sherlock’s forearms. The sirens are getting closer. “I told you, I’m
“Very rare to find a nutcracker like this,” Uncle Augustus tells him. “It’s a heavy wood under that paint, and you can see all the details are carved in, not just painted. I fixed some of the carvings up because when I found him, he was a little beat up. But he’s special, isn’t he?”
“I can’t believe I’ve finally found you,” John says. His voice chokes, and he looks up for a moment, blinking rapidly, then heaves a deep breath and looks back at Sherlock. “And look at you,” he says. “You’re – Christ, you’re incredible.”
“There really is, though,” Moriarty says. He reclines in his chair, watching John with a crooked smile and narrowed eyes. “You’ve come here for nothing. He’s gone.”
He reaches for another meringue while she cleans him up and pops it in his mouth, giggling when Mummy playfully smacks him on the arm. She turns him around and wipes at his mouth once, which makes him turn his head away in annoyance, then she kisses him on the cheek and he scowls as he chews.
But then, Angelo puts their food in front of them, and John is no longer concerned, eager to eat after such a long day.  Sitting next to Sherlock, the events of the day finally over, the food tastes that much more delicious, and he smiles, glad to be alive.
The man frowns in confusion as Sherlock sits back on the couch again. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he says.
Sherlock feels wrong-footed once more; though it’s often hard for him to predict John, he certainly hadn’t predicted this. He’d predicted anger in some form, maybe sarcasm, maybe clenched fists and labored breaths through his nose, not concession.
“Oh, shut up,” John says, but it’s without heat as he examines the tube in his hands, looking at it from different angles and holding it under the light. “Should I open it?”
“Oh, John!” she says. “The kitchen looks lovely! I’ve brought you another cuppa, why don’t you sit down and have a drink before you start cooking?”
“You’re obviously not sleeping well at night judging by the bags under your eyes and how much you yawn all day. You spend most of your time here as it is, and this
The next day while John is at work, Sherlock picks up his violin case. He places it on the table and opens it, and then just looks. His stomach flutters and he is filled with an indescribable feeling of nostalgia and longing as his eyes drift over the warm, familiar wood and the beautiful shape of the F-holes and the fine dusting of rosin that still sits undisturbed beneath the strings. He reaches out and lets his fingers brush over the wood, the smoothness achingly familiar, but he startles when he hears the door to the street open and Mrs. Hudson’s footsteps shuffling to her apartment, and he pulls his fingers back as if burned.
have hands,” John interrupts, patience growing thin, “And they’re currently in charge of your well-being, so do shut up.”
“It won’t when you’re going to Sherlock’s location,” he says. “It’s a place few can visit, and there’s no alternate exit; the door will not disappear.”
– he thinks he’ll miss if he goes to her. He can’t remember who (yes, who, definitely who), but he can remember vague impressions – the warm scent of smoke, the sound of a deep, velvety laugh, a flash of blue silk fabric – and he urgently wants to see him. He frowns and steps back again.
Sherlock leans back, still staring at John in deep scrutiny and holding his hands steepled underneath his chin. John raises an eyebrow and calmly drinks his coffee, waiting for whatever it is Sherlock will say.
“Er, hello?” he calls, feeling a bit strange calling out to someone in what appears to be a room devoid of human presence. “Anyone down here?”
– Sherlock has never had a real friend before, but he thinks John is better than any friend he ever could have had.
Sherlock’s eyes fall half closed; he can’t bear to keep them open, and yet, he doesn’t want to miss John’s face in this moment. His hands are shaking and his breath is quick as John comes closer, just a bit, and then Sherlock drops his chin, and John’s lips brush his. It’s like electricity, like coming home, and his mind palace is under siege by John, who is blowing through it like a gust of hot summer wind.
John looks down with a chuckle. “Oh, right,” he says, a bit sheepishly. Sherlock neglected to mention that he can still sense the magical residue of St. Mungo’s all over John, a particularly strong and harsh magic that makes him want to wrinkle his nose and request John take a shower.
He closes his eyes and tries to focus on his breathing. He breathes in and out, slowly, his breaths lining up with the slow tempo of the music.   He starts to think about Sherlock. Rather than just think of memories, he decides instead to think about
Only one more after this!  Thanks so much for reading.  I hope you enjoyed this chapter!  I'd love to hear your thoughts on it - I know there was a lot of info to digest in this chapter, and I hope it was palatable.  I was (am!) very worried about it all making sense.  So I'd really appreciate your thoughts on that!  More things will be clarified next chapter, which should be up within a week. :)
“I boiled it, you make the tea,” John says dismissively, going back to his paper and pointedly flicking it to straighten the pages.
, John,” he replies, gesturing wildly, “an alternative where you were the most remarkable man I’d ever known; the ideal man, in every way, the wisest, bravest, and kindest man I had ever seen. And so I wished for you to live so that man could come to fruition because, quite selfishly, I wanted him in my life,” Sherlock says in a passionate rush.
Sherlock shifts so that John can pull her out of her shirt, and then John settles against her. Sherlock moans at the way John’s breasts settle against hers and can’t help but shift her hips up towards John’s eagerly, and John goes back to kissing her neck, running a hand up and down Sherlock’s side, stroking her thumb over Sherlock’s nipple once more. Sherlock arches into the touch, and her heart beats faster when John starts to trail kisses down her neck, then gently takes her other nipple into her mouth, swirling her tongue over it. Sherlock’s breath hitches and then John gently takes it between her teeth and Sherlock groans, the sound spilling out of her lips before she can stop it. John flicks her tongue against Sherlock’s nipple, pressing it up against her teeth, massaging it with her tongue, and the sensation travels straight to Sherlock’s cunt, warmth pooling there, and Sherlock moans when John’s hand gently twists Sherlock’s other nipple, her tongue and teeth still massaging all the while, and it’s setting Sherlock on
John picks his head up and smiles at him, soft and open and – “John,” Sherlock says.  “Please – I, please – “
Sherlock doesn’t look at him. “Grocery shopping. Humans do require basic sustenance, John. As a doctor, I’d think you-”
John’s fingers slide down to his nape and press for just a moment, the pads of his fingertips warm and firm against the base of his skull, and Sherlock shudders, his spine arching, his breath quickening as John’s fingers slide up, up, up along the back of his head, then smoothly go back down, pressing again against his nape. He feels goosebumps break out over his skin, feels a helpless moan slide from his mouth.
“Of course, do come in,” Mycroft says. He opens the door and stands to the side, giving John and Sherlock a bland smile as he gestures them in.
Sherlock shrugs. He waves his hand and a flurry of soft, warm lights follow behind. He uses a finger to send them towards John, who holds his hand out, and Sherlock gently sends them forward to hover over John’s palm. John smiles, the lines in his face illuminated by the warm lights Sherlock’s been playing with since he was very small. Sherlock changes the colors, then organizes them into the shape of a butterfly and lets it fly around the room.
“Well, thanks for your opinion,” John says with a tight smile, shoving a cup of tea in Sherlock’s direction and forcing him out of his personal space.
I’ll be needing it,” John says, brushing past them all and heading to the kitchen. “I’ll also be needing some tea, Christ.”
John’s stomach clenches.  “No,” he says firmly, his voice rough.  He shakes his head.  “They won’t.”
Greg looks serious now, and John wonders if he, too, harbors some ill will towards Mary even though he’s never met her. “I’m sure Sherlock had his reasons for you not to be there with her,” Greg says thoughtfully. “Even
“Billy!” he calls, heading straight to where he sits on the mantle, but there’s no reply. John’s stomach twists and his hands tremble and he feels as if he’s in a tunnel, as if everything is happening in slow motion and yet, paradoxically, as if everything is happening way too fast. He picks up the skull, the bone cool against his hands, and he shakes it hard, knowing how much Billy hates that. “Billy! Billy! Fucking talk to me, goddammit!” he pleads, dread pooling in his stomach, but Billy is silent; he appears to be nothing but a skull, soundless and non-sentient.
And then after what seems like hours but can’t be more than minutes, he sees John at the other side of a crosswalk, just having crossed, but the light is changing.
“It’s terrible,” the girl says. “It’s – I didn’t ask for this, you know?   But it’s here, and I can’t get any peace. It’s just so
John wakes to the smell of Chinese food. He opens his eyes and blinks a few times, disoriented and confused. He’s not quite sure where he is or what time it is. He swivels his head a bit and realizes he’s lying on the couch in his flat, and then suddenly he remembers the spirit, and making his way home, and then Sherlock taking care of him. With a flush of embarrassment, he remembers falling asleep on Sherlock, but the man in question is in the kitchen, if the sounds he hears are anything to go by.
. He watches as her chest rises and falls with each breath. Her little John-shaped nose resting atop her shiny, parted lips takes the forefront of Sherlock’s mind, and the familiar sounds of John moving around upstairs fall away for a moment as he takes in everything about her that he can. His mind spins fast, imagining what she’ll be like when she’s older, how tall she’ll be, the shape of her face – of course he can’t
“I’m making tea,” John says, going to the kitchen. “Oh, fucking hell,” he says, and Sherlock winces when he remembers the beakers he smashed in there. He waves his hand and clears the mess, and grudgingly does the same in the living room, while John makes tea without magic.
John leans down, kisses him again. “Yes. Always,” John murmurs, right next to his lips. Sherlock shivers, and John kisses him again, closing the scant distance between them easily, pressing their lips together gently, sweetly, perfectly. They stay that way for a moment, John standing on his own two legs, Sherlock leaning up to meet him in a kiss, surrounded by the soft lights and flowers.
He looks again at the door he touched, and sees that it’s an apartment he’s never noticed before, though it’s not his first time on Baker Street. “221B” gleams in gold on the front of the door, and he looks up at the building with a frown.
, Mummy! You don’t understand! I went to his house! It was real! See, he put my belt in his pocket because we traded because we’re
“About Sherlock’s new…employee,” he says.  “Live-in employee with a significant amount of power to whom Sherlock shows an unusual amount of…care.”
Moriarty raises an eyebrow. “Impressive!” he says. “Nice pet, John. But Sherlock will still disappear!” He says it in that same singsong inflection, and John wants to punch him.
do it, and the longing he’s felt for so long feels as if it’s exploding inside of him and he can’t stop holding onto John, can’t help the way his breath quickens.
Sherlock sighs. “That spirit wasn't yours or mine to control. It decides what it wants to do. And you can’t forget, John, that where there exists a wish, there also exists that which is wished for.”
They’re silent for a moment, drinking their nectar. “I had a best friend once,” John says suddenly. He sees Sherlock’s head turn towards him in his peripheral vision, so he continues, his eyes trained on his glass. “I met him on the way home from school. I was walking home and I kept seeing these stupid bloody
John feels it when the spirits obey; he feels the shift in the air around him, he feels the chill of spirits rushing through his body in their haste to get to Moriarty, he feels the pain in his head intensifying, like he’s being split open with icepicks and jackhammers, he feels like his skin is on
His heart is thumping fast and he can barely breathe. He squeezes his eyes closed and lets Redbeard slither back up to his neck, and he fists his hands in the duvet pooled at his waist. Redbeard had been big, and now he’s small…had that happened? John wonders if he’s crazy.
“John,” Sherlock finally says after a moment. John looks up and his jaw is tense and he looks ragged and anxious. “Maybe it would help to put her in the pram and go for a walk?”
Sherlock’s stomach twists. This is Dangerous Territory, he knows. He’s not sure what to say. He shakes his head, the movement small. “No,” he says.
“You’ve tasted it before,” Sherlock tells him. “Remember, that night we had wine on the roof when you first moved in? That was actually the nectar from last year’s ceremony.”
Sherlock has never been prone to poetic thoughts, or at least she’s always been good at suppressing them, but something about seeing John in her chair, reading the paper, hair tucked behind her ear but one stray piece swooping out, makes her smile soften and something bubble up in her chest, makes her think things like
The old woman, Mrs. Hudson, scurries out of the kitchen bearing a tray with two cups of tea on top. “Oh, you’re going?” she asks. She sounds considerably sadder than the situation warrants, and it makes John pause for a moment. He spares her a glance before turning back to the man, Sherlock.
“If you boys are ready…?” Mycroft says.  Sherlock sneers and charges ahead, and John sighs and follows.
“I doubt it,” John replies, but when Greg lights a cigarette with a flick of his empty hand and then hands the small bag to John, John takes it, holding it carefully in his hands. “I thought you didn’t do magic…?” John asks, eyeing the lit cigarette.
But then, his hand comes in contact with a piece of strong, flat wood, and the pressure on his back instantly disappears. He freezes and holds his breath for a moment. His senses are acutely aware of everything around him from the receipt drifting in the wind and scratching against the ground beside him, to the rough sidewalk beneath his flesh, to the sounds of footsteps and traffic and idle chatter, to the scent of coffee brewing nearby, but the cold feeling of the spirits’ presence is definitely missing. It’s absent from reality even though he can still feel the after-effects echoing down to his very bones. He wonders if he’s imagining the sudden absence of the cluster of spirits that had
He shakes his head and smiles kindly at her.  “No, of course not.  It’s okay to be scared, especially when you’re all alone in somewhere as dark as this.”
“I know you have a wish,” Sherlock assures her. He almost sounds gentle, but his voice quickly turns pointed before the sentiment can settle. “But your wish pertains to your very essence of being, and you and I know very well that no one in this world or any other can grant it, not even
“Alright?” John asks, when Sherlock doesn’t even move to take his menu. He sounds hesitant, maybe a little embarrassed.
Sherlock just continues to beam, which John finds a bit unsettling, and leads the way out of the flat.
Sherlock doesn’t pause or look back as he speaks, just walks ahead and assumes everyone will go with him.  “Unfortunately, you should follow,” he tells Mycroft.  John looks between the two of them, wonders why they’re all going to Sherlock’s bedroom, and stands up with a resigned sigh, following Sherlock and ignoring the look on Mycroft’s face, who follows along looking much too pleased with himself.
“Sherlock,” John says, and Sherlock doesn’t have to see him to know that his shoulders are sloped downward, that his eyebrows have that familiar crease of apprehension between them that twists his face into an overt display of worry and weariness, that his mouth is turned down at the corners, that his new frown lines are on full display. “I thought you might be up.”
He sighs, knowing he’s about to do something dangerous, but his bladder is beginning to feel the presence of all the tea he’d drank that day. He hesitates, glancing between Sherlock and Mary for a moment, but he has no choice. “I’ll just go to the loo,” John says, giving Mary an apologetic look. “Play nice, Sherlock.”
The man leans back, closing his fist around the dog tags. John watches, feeling a strange helplessness as the metal cords slip between the man’s fingers, the dog tags suddenly far out of reach.
He watches as Redbeard winds around Sherlock’s long fingers, and then he makes himself go back to the table, lest he stares longer than he should. He sits down and picks up his coffee again and Sherlock sits opposite him, holding Redbeard in front of his face and watching him closely.
“It’s alright, love,” John says.  His voice is hoarse from Sherlock’s cock hitting his throat and Sherlock whimpers.  “Just take a minute. Breathe.”
John snorts. “Yeah, well, if I hadn’t met Sherlock, I probably would have, but I’ve met enough of his…
Just as he prepares to run, though, he jerks back abruptly when a hand grabs him by the shirt collar and tugs. He knows his plan is foiled, and worst of all, by his number one enemy. “Mycroft!” he complains, twisting his body to bat ineffectually at Mycroft’s hand.
“John!” Sherlock says. “You should be resting, you – are you alright? “ Sherlock puts his hands frantically on John’s arms, and carefully, he leads him towards the couch. John feels as if he’s entered some strange alternate dimension, and doesn’t discount the possibility. He’s unsure if this is really happening, unsure if he can trust what he sees.
“Yeah, I met him at the park after work yesterday, and I’ll meet him again today,” he says. He sounds more aggressive than he means to, but he doesn’t like Mary’s tone.
Sherlock feels frustrated and out of touch with the conversation, unsure of the source of John’s anxiety but knowing it’s somehow related to him. “Of course she’s not an experiment,” he says in a rush. “She’s interesting and fascinating because she’s part of
John doesn’t need to be told twice, and he steps closer to Sherlock, so close that their arms brush as they walk quickly through the forest. They walk for a few minutes in relative silence, the only sounds those of their feet crunching through the underbrush and the occasional distant rustle in the trees that John doesn’t want to think about, until finally John can see a clearing.
“Redbeard remembers it, see?” John asks, holding the bandana up towards Redbeard, who immediately snuggles his face against it. John glances up and sees that the corner of Sherlock’s mouth has twitched upward out of his scowl. “Go on, take him,” John says.
John frowns, looking between Sherlock and the house. “Er, you don't seem very pleased to be here,” he remarks. He’s itching to ask more, but he knows Sherlock is less than forthcoming about this kind of thing.
“I’m not,” Sherlock says, hushed. He swallows, the sound loud in the quiet of the flat. “John, I’m not,” he repeats, his fingers soothing John’s lower back in small, insistent motions. John presses closer and lets his head fall into the crook of Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock’s hand immediately comes up to cradle it, his long fingers running through John’s short hair. John breathes him in, his own fingers still winding into Sherlock’s curls.
“Mummy got you such a nice tie this year,” Mycroft says as he tightens the knot of the bright crimson tie embroidered with snowflakes.
“You look beautiful, Mummy,” Sherlock says, and then blushes. He loves to see Mummy when she dresses up; she’s always elegant and beautiful and statuesque.
John treads water and closes his eyes. He tries to relax, but the woman sitting on the rock near him is the same one who stole Sherlock’s soul because she wanted a present from John. He remembers that day very well, especially the anger he felt because Sherlock would treat his life so frivolously.
“Let’s get started, yeah?” he says. He holds up the file on top of his stack, a woman whose last name has recently changed due to marriage. “Is she updated in the system yet? Should I file her under Smith or McKinley?”
“Wouldn’t it be foolish of me to tell you?” John asks, his voice weaker than he’d intended it to be. This whole situation feels out of his control and he feels off balance, unsure of the man in front of him, and yet unwilling and unable to leave.
It’s Mycroft, and John is flooded with relief that someone besides him is here and whole, but at the same time, his desperation is peaking and he finds that his confusing emotions are coalescing into a physical, visceral urge to punch him, though he knows it’s irrational. “Where is he?” John demands, his hands clenched at his sides, his voice strangled, his eyes intent. “Dammit, Mycroft, do you know where he is?”
John stops walking and just stares at Sherlock for a moment. “What…yes, you’re right, we had dinner and wine with Mary. And you just – you just told her
“Er, ta,” John says. He feels quite caught off guard even though it’s only a cup of tea. It’s warm against his fingers, and he feels some of his irritation slide away, as much as he’d like to hold onto it.
“It appears a customer is coming,” Sherlock murmurs. He stands just as they hear the sound of the door to the street opening. Then, there are feet coming up the stairs, and Sherlock goes to the door of the flat, opening it.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and holds his nutcracker up to face Mycroft. He pulls on the lever so its mouth opens and it can talk to Mycroft. “
Sherlock is quiet for a moment. He’s looking at his hand on John’s arm, not at John’s face. “There’s always a choice, John,” Sherlock says. “But even so, I made a choice, too, and I understood it very well. I would make the same choice again if I had to. I knew you’d be angry with me, John, but I will do anything I have to do to keep you here and alive.”
He shoots two more times, a total of three, and they fall in a neat cluster at the center of the target.  He’s the clear winner of the competition, and John grins as he cheers.  He wonders if there’s anything Sherlock can’t do, because it doesn’t seem that way.
“Thank you!” the boy says in an ecstatic rush, reaching out and taking it from John.  He just looks at it for a moment, his eyes bright, and then runs off to a small chest of drawers in the back of the cart.
!” and “That would be lovely, dear!” and “Now you’re just rubbing it in, aren’t you?” he can’t help but smile, just a little.
“She said I was invited, didn’t she? It’s not like I invited myself,” Sherlock says reasonably as he picks nonexistent lint off of the arm of his suit jacket.
“Oh, perfect!” Mary says. She’s still smiling, and Sherlock is staring at her. John finds it a bit creepy, but Mary doesn’t seem to notice. John spreads the blanket out and sits, and Mary and Sherlock join him.
He swallows, steeling himself to remain reassuring and not react too strongly to her obvious distress. “Are you –” He clears his throat, tells himself to be patient, reminds himself that talking to her can often be like talking to a child. “Do you know where to find him?”
“Yes,” John insists. He lets go of Sherlock’s hand and it falls limply to the couch beside him, but John reaches out to cup Sherlock’s face instead. Sherlock’s heart is pounding; surely this isn’t happening, and yet he can feel the pads of John’s fingers against his skin, the rough edge of his thumb against his cheek. And then John is leaning forward, hesitantly, his eyes full of concern and fear, pupils flickering between Sherlock’s eyes and his lips.
Sherlock swallows. He doesn’t move his hand; he can’t. It’s grounding him to John, forcing him to stay in the moment, forcing him to put himself on the line. “It’s – he would’ve killed you. Moriarty. He had a gunman on you. If I survived, you would die. I couldn’t -” He stops, regains control, focuses on the feeling of John’s cheek against his hand. “I couldn’t let that happen. That’s why you could never know I was alive, John.”
When Mycroft is gone, John turns toward Sherlock and hesitates for a moment, but goes to the kitchen instead.  He makes Sherlock’s tea and brings it into the living room.
John reaches up and holds out his hand, and the little pipe fox curls over his fingers. John holds it out to Sherlock.
“Why is this with the biscuits again?” John complains, holding it up and turning towards Sherlock, who is still staring at him.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow in on the shadows because for a moment, he swears he sees Uncle Augustus’ face there, but just as soon, it disappears, and his heart is still pounding in confusion when he turns back to the nutcracker. He feels a strange sort of dizziness wash over him, and he closes his eyes in alarm until it passes, and when he opens them, he’s no longer small; he’s back to his normal size. Sherlock’s eyes widen when he sees that across from him, the nutcracker has grown to human size, too, but he’s no longer made of wood; he has turned into a boy. He’s still wearing the nutcracker’s handsome uniform, but he’s a boy, just like Sherlock, with sandy blonde hair and blue eyes and a smile that stretches all the way across his face.
John furrows his brow as he listens, vivid memories of the tunnels flashing through his mind. “Good thing,” he agrees, remembering how Redbeard had urged him towards the door after Sherlock had disappeared. “And what about Redbeard? I didn’t know he could do that.”
“The state of you! The guests are arriving any minute and you’re covered in dust!” Mummy comes closer and reaches out for a clean dishtowel, which she dampens under the sink.
“Obviously,” Sherlock calls from the kitchen. “You’ve seen Lestrade again, haven’t you? I’m saving time.”
John straightens and chuckles, heading towards the teapot, which he’d already started for after dinner tea, and continues to listen to the conversation.
John is amazed by the difference a suit makes on the man. He’s suddenly become lean lines and authority, his tailored suit snug on his body. He no longer looks debauched or contrary, even if his personality remains the same.
“That – that’s all?” John asks after a moment, his brain still processing what Sherlock has said. “That’s why?”
“Good,” Sherlock says, then realizes what he’s said. “That you hit him with a pan, not that he wasn’t nice,” he clarifies.
Mrs. Hudson shakes her head.  “There’s everything there.  You just need to be attuned to it,” she says.  “Sherlock made it, you know.  He made that passageway, just like he made this place and everything inside it.”
can’t bring me back, of course, and there are very few people in this world that could. Fortunately, your wish is very strong and very clever.”
John holds his hand out and Redbeard curls around his wrist, and John looks at Sherlock in confusion. “Are you really sure?”
“I don’t understand,” John says. He feels like he’s been saying that a lot recently, and his head is swimming, worry and fear washing over him, threatening to pull him under.
Again, they’re off, but this time, they’re walking through the meadow towards the edge of an adjoining forest. It’s dark when they enter the forest; the trees create a thick covering above their heads to block out the sun. The temperature drops a bit, too, and John shivers as they walk deeper into the darkness.
Something is different between them now; their laughter doesn’t come as naturally, their teasing is rare and careful. He doesn’t like it and he doesn’t know how to fix it, and so he sets out to make the environment as close to it was
When it’s over, Sherlock keeps his eyes closed, focuses on the sensation of John’s fingers in his hair, of his thumbs on his cheekbones.
John pulls out his wand and is about to cast a spell, but Sherlock reaches out and grabs his wand out of his hand.
“It was a good idea to give you the cigarettes,” Sherlock says after a moment. “Beneficial for all of us. Lestrade tries to quit smoking all the time; it’s really best he doesn’t carry them on him. I see the cigarettes and know you’ve actually met him because these particular ones are unique to him, and you have the cigarettes when you wake up and they make you question your experience. Elegant, if a bit obvious, but that’s to be expected with Lestrade.”
“Aunt Isabella is here,” Sherlock says as they walk. “She’s pregnant, but she hasn’t told anyone yet.”
“Let’s change you, Love, hmm?” John murmurs to Iris. Her only reply is to scream more, and John winces and sends Sherlock an apologetic smile before he heads up the stairs.
“Well, you learned something, didn’t you?  You figured out how to find me.  That’s quite important.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “She’s here somewhere, since she lives in this world, but I don’t think she’s
mouth, when John’s tongue darts out and swirls around the head of his cock again. Sherlock’s thighs tremble and he moans and he feels desperately out of control already and then John stretches his lips around him once more and moves his head down, slow and controlled and hot and wet and velvety.
“Right,” John says.  “Can you try that one more time, because I’ve had a long day and I don’t want to puzzle that out?”
, and yet he feels afraid for John to know that, though he can’t explain why; the thought of John watching him holding Iris in the way he’s seen John hold her is terrifying in ways he doesn’t know how to process.
Redbeard digs his front paws into the ground and his body tenses. He sucks in a deep breath, and when he opens his mouth, be breathes fire, a brilliant red fire that makes John’s eyes widen and his jaw drop when he tries to reconcile the little pipefox with this creature. He watches as Redbeard’s fire dissolves the web in Moriarty’s hands, but leaves Moriarty’s skin intact.
“That’s it,” John says. His eyes flicker to Sherlock’s lips, and Sherlock feels himself shuffling forward just the tiniest bit, feels his heart beating fast, feels a whirlwind of thoughts swirl through his brain, threatening to take over, feels all of the nerves in his body coming to attention, feels alarm bells blaring in his mind palace that something is about to happen, feels tension creep down his spine – and then John’s thumb soothes over his cheekbone, John tilts his head to the side and lets his lips part, lets his eyes flicker between Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock’s eyes and something deep inside Sherlock knows what he’s supposed to do and he finds his own eyes mirroring John’s, finds his own eyes traveling between John’s eyes and John’s lips, feels John’s hand, steady and capable, on his waist, and he feels himself lower his head, feels himself tilt his head to the side, feels his hands shift on John’s waist as John shifts up onto his toes.
John is frozen, his eyes wide as he stares at the man in front of him, his heart hammering. This whole encounter has been odd, but he’s not sure how this complete stranger in front of him can
“You’re rather kind, aren’t you? But this has nothing to do with your wish. Not everything revolves around you, you know.”
“It’s not far from here,” Zosima continues. “But it’s nearly impossible to pass through the forest around Moriarty’s den. If I go in too far, all of the energy just leaves my body; it’s the strangest feeling.”
When they climb out of the water, their clothes sticking awkwardly to their bodies, the air is pleasantly warm. John tugs his shirt away from his chest, giving it a squeeze to try and get some water out.
Sherlock disappears down the hall for a moment. John turns his head feebly and watches him go. He wants to protest, to tell him to come back, but his body feels weak and he’s not sure he can.
“I occasionally assist in solving crimes for them,” Sherlock says vaguely. “There’s been a murder, and they need help. Interested?”
He takes John’s free hand and starts to run, and John is startled enough that he laughs, running fast to keep up with Sherlock’s long strides. They speed through the forest, branches and leaves crunching underfoot, moving so fast that the chill can’t seem to stick to John’s senses long enough to bother him.
“You love me,” John says. His voice is soft. Sherlock can only stare. He feels his lower lip quiver, but he holds it still. John gently brushes his thumb over it, and Sherlock shivers, feels it quiver again. “You love me,” John repeats.
He knows that this means John could potentially move back to Baker Street, but he also knows that he wouldn’t be the same John who’d left, and that their lives wouldn’t be the same as before. But still, his brain is suddenly running in circles, imagining the possible outcomes – boxes and boxes of John’s things arriving in Baker Street, John stumbling down the stairs in the morning with his hair sticking up every which way, John grumbling about the body parts in the fridge, John dropping tea at Sherlock’s side while he’s staring down the end of a microscope, John cleaning his gun while Sherlock plays the violin – his heart is hammering and he finds that he can’t speak.
John stares in disbelief, his jaw slack. He wonders, for a moment, if maybe he is hallucinating, or one of the ghosts got him and he’s living in some parallel dimension, but then he hears an impatient voice yelling something he can’t quite make out from two floors above.
, you took it away. But you – I know why you did it. I do. I forgave you, Sherlock. A long time ago. You know that. But when you came back, I had Mary, and I couldn’t just run to you. But you have to know, Sherlock, god, you
“I didn’t choose to come here,” the girl says from ahead of him.  “I don’t want to be here.  I have to leave.  You have to help me!”
“John,” he manages again, his hands dropping to his lap. Something hot is burning in his stomach. “Don’t go. Please.”
“Then how are you – how is this –” Sherlock pauses, and thinks of something Mycroft told him once, that once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. His eyes grow wide as he goes over the facts and comes to his conclusion. “Is this magic? Were you under a spell?”
“I’m sorry,” the woman says.  Her voice is light and tremulous.  “I didn’t mean to upset you.  I just wanted to give you a gift.”
John comes home that night and his footsteps are heavy. Sherlock looks up from his computer and takes in the stiff set of John’s shoulders and the way his jaw clenches and his mind starts spinning, deducing as many of the details of John’s day as he can.
. He realizes John asked him a question, though, and so his eyes flicker towards the screen and back to John. “Hmm?”
John thinks it’s strange that Sherlock has a no visitors rule, but then, Sherlock is strange, so it’s to be expected. He’s just telling Mary this during their lunch break when she raises an eyebrow.
John hesitates only a moment before he’s standing up, cane in hand. “Obviously,” he says, and they share a smile, and then they’re off.
“When I asked for them not to bother me, I didn’t mean I wanted them to bother someone else,” John says.
“Hold it over his chest and let go,” Mycroft says.  His voice is less cold than usual, and John is grateful.
“You don’t have to hold the chair so tight,” John tells him. He strokes his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides in an effort to relax him, but it’s making him more needy, more desperate.  “Go on. Relax.”
,” John says, handing the skull in question to Sherlock. “You told me to get your friend, and it was a
Before taking a single bite, he went to check on his patient. Sherlock was on his back, arms stretched wide, mouth slack. In the quiet darkness of the room, John could sense a pained melancholy from the man and knew Sherlock’s brow was furrowed even in sleep. He walked over to the side of the bed and gazed down on Sherlock’s face, noting the sharp features of his friend were more prominent, more drawn, his cheekbones more like akimbo elbows. Sherlock breath hitched and he licked his lips, and without thinking, instinctively, John gently brushed a few stray, damp curls off his forehead. Sherlock slowly opened his one visible eye, its sliver-green color glowing in the shadows, looking up at John, whose heart was beating so loudly in his chest he was certain it could be heard.
Every afternoon, John removed the bandages to moisturize the sutures. The doctor had to work hard at controlling his face as he did so, as Sherlock watched John for any kind of sign – of anything. A twinge of worry. A clenched jaw of disgust. Darting eyes to infection. John concentrated on keeping his face as flaccid as possible, knowing that Sherlock’s eyes were just centimeters away.
John looked up, surprised. “You are most welcome, Sherlock. And that’s Dr. Watson to you.” Sherlock turned his head away, but John swore he saw the faintest upturned corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
“I know, you’re fine. But maybe I’m not. Tell you what. I’m going to go back to my own therapist. It’s been a while. I could use a refresher. Just promise me you will at least think about it. You’ve been through so much, Sherlock. Just think about it.”
John could not breathe, for his heart was truly in his throat, blocking all oxygen, shunting blood to his face until it burned. He looked at Sherlock – really looked. Gray-green catlike eyes, a bit wide with surprise, circles of red high on each cheekbone, short hair a bit mussed from taking off his hat. John leaned in and lifted a hand to sooth the hair back into place, the caretaker always, but Sherlock reached out and caught his wrist, suspending John’s hand in mid-air for a moment. Slowly, so slowly, Sherlock brought John’s hand to his own hot cheek, and the detective closed his eyes and leaned into the feel of it.
he sighed. John bagged the medical waste and deposited it into the labeled-as-such receptacle in the kitchen – must have been brought here by minions of Mycroft, what else will I be finding? – he checked his phone.
Sherlock’s eyes were only on John, seeking reassurance. “Sherlock, it looks really, really good. I mean that,” John said, amazed. There were some trace lines of were the skin had been joined, much like his cheek, but they had been tucked into the natural contours of Sherlock’s face. In a few more months, John knew that if he didn’t know where to look for those scars, he wouldn’t even know there were there. But his nose was back. John was looking at Sherlock for the first time in months without bandages and with a complete nose and it felt like he was looking at Sherlock for the first time – ever. John felt his heart leap.
- in life, in work, in love. The part of John that had been looking into down the precipice, wondering how to get to the other side, was gone. The bridge was there, and he had crossed it to be with Sherlock, who had been waiting patiently on the other side.
“Need you to roll over a bit, let me look at the hip,” John said, raising the blanket, but Sherlock vehemently pushed them back down. “Sherlock, really? If I don’t take care of you, the hospital is going to pull you right back. I know I’m not a pretty nurse, but I am a doctor. Come on, let me have a look.”
Sherlock gave a weak ‘thumbs up’ in response and John brought him a glass of water. John sat on the edge of the bed and directed the straw to Sherlock’s mouth. His eyes sought Sherlock’s, but they were downcast, intent on the glass in John’s hand.  John instead took the moment to quickly examine Sherlock’s bandages, and determined that tomorrow, they would need to be changed.
“Okay, right. Let me just clean this up a bit and get you all set. I have to clean it, remove some of the scabbing with these tweezers, so it’s going to take some time.  Are you comfortable? I can’t have you moving around.”
“Got some pain?” John asked, resuming his seat on the edge of the bed and pressing Sherlock’s cell phone into the man’s hand, but the detective shook his head.
John opened the door to see the bedside lamp and his careful array of medications and bandages on the floor. Sherlock was sitting up in bed, tearing at the bandages on his face, his one visible eye wide and frantic.
When John awoke again the next morning, Sherlock was already up and looking at the files Lestrade had given them. And, the detective was quietly practicing his “EEEEOOOO” exercises to himself, stretching his lips then pursing them, over and over.
But then John understood. Sherlock was done with hospitals, with reconstruction, with surgery, with recoveries.
“He’s already aware of his brother’s progress. Here, my card. Please let me know if you need anything, at any time.”
“Good,” John repeated. Sherlock opened his eyes at the sound of John’s voice, eyes filled with wonder, and desire…but something else, too.
John set a plate with a scone on his own lap and began to read some articles out loud, pausing every few minutes to take a bite. He was interrupted by Sherlock tapping his fingernails on his own plate, indicating the need for another scone.
Sherlock had once told John. It was not just his physical presence that was impressive to behold. Sherlock carried himself impressively (some would say arrogantly) with his chin up, eyes devouring, curly locks just the right amount of messy. Any other person with his long neck and ambling limbs would resemble a marionette, but Sherlock was ballet, he was waltz, he was elegance.
“I’ve got to remove this, yeah,” John said more to himself. He assembled the needed bandages and tape put gloves on, noting that Sherlock lay, unmoving, a forlorn figure that seemed to melt into the mattress. A ghost of a man. “You’re going to be fine, Sherlock,” John said, pulling off the dressing. “Just a little bump in the road, but nothing old Dr. Watson hasn’t seen before.” He kept up his one-sided conversation, filling Sherlock in on the bounty of food in the kitchen, but avoiding mention of the new refrigerator (John shuddered just a bit to think what was in the old one). The wound was infected, staring accusingly up at John like an angry red eye. He cleaned and redressed it and helped Sherlock roll onto his back again. There were high red spots on Sherlock’s pale cheeks and his eyes glittered with fever. The patient pushed John away impatiently when he tried to adjust the pillows and blankets.
“Please, call me John,” he answered, fighting the urge to ask if Sherlock had been behaving himself. It was obvious he wasn’t. “Maybe we could talk someplace else?”
Reluctantly, Sherlock swung his legs down onto the floor and accepted John’s hand to stand up. “Right this way, here we go,” John said, turning his back to Sherlock, who put a hand on each of John’s shoulders. Like an engine guiding an unruly train, the two of them walked down the hallway, round the living room twice, and back down the hallway with a break at the loo. John stood outside the door, listening for any sounds of distress. Sherlock was very weak, and standing for any amount of time took an inordinate amount of energy. He heard Sherlock pee (good strong flow, positive sign of hydration) and brush his teeth.
The detective squeezed his eyes shut and fiercely shook his head, a silent plea for John not to argue.
“All right?” John asked, and Sherlock nodded under John’s hand. They were close now, their faces just inches apart, in the same bed, under the same covers. But the seeds of doubt had been planted too deeply in John’s mind:
“Thank you, Molly. We will see you soon,” John said. When the door closed softly behind her, Sherlock’s eyes moved to John.
“You’re all good, you are just waking up. Easy now,” John whispered, smiling through tears, as he pushed a stray hair off his forehead. John relinquished the detective’s hand to a nurse for a pulse and stood out of the way, watching as Sherlock drifted in and out of consciousness, slowly sleeping off the medicine, and experiencing a joy like no other as the detective’s eyes – as surrounded by bruises as they were - would close and then reopen long moments later with a light in them, a light of bliss upon seeing John still there.
“I’m pretty sure he already knows,” Dr. Herry offered. He was a handsome, prematurely gray-haired man with kind eyes and a thin build.
John clenched the arms of the chair, waiting. Sherlock slowly moved his mouth and lips in an exaggerated fashion, slowly forming the sounds.
“Here, you’ll lose all sorts of heat if you don’t wear this,” John said, pulling it on Sherlock’s head. John put it down too low over Sherlock’s eyes, and they both adjusted it at the same time, hands touching. Sherlock’s fingers ran down the length of John’s hand, so slowly, John watching as if frozen in time and space.
“Late? Its not even 2 pm! I know that one’s a regular night owl – never known him to sleep! These files have been sitting around for a while, waiting for you to take a look.”
Sherlock let his hands drop and John dared to place his palms on each cheek, carefully wiping away the detective’s tears with his thumbs.
John’s heart stopped. “Wait just a minute. You are not going to die tomorrow. It’s a straightforward procedure that this particular doctor has performed a number of times!”
It was not his touch that was good. Not the feel of his flesh on Sherlock. Not the affection and out right love – yes, that word,
“We are going to be removing the bandages and assessing the ear. If there are any signs of rejection or infection, unfortunately, we are going to be taking the next steps to remove it.”
“Wonderful. I’ll go -,” John began, but Sherlock pulled off his covers and swung his feet to the floor. He was shirtless and the cool air of the flat made his smooth chest goose-pimple. John pulled a fresh top out of the drawer – noting it was the last one, he had to call the laundry service today – and Sherlock raised his arms in the air like a child while it was pulled over his head. The detective put a hand on John’s shoulder as he stood, steadying himself, John noting those long five fingers clenching for balance, those long five fingers….
For the two weeks that they had been home, John was careful to again pay attention to the needs of his patient, but also not to smother him. There were things that Sherlock just wanted – and needed – to do on his own. Getting up and brushing his hair and teeth, for instance, was something John would allow Sherlock to do, even if it was awkward or difficult and John knew he could do it better if he helped. But Sherlock had pride, and this entire situation had knocked London’s consulting detective down several notches. And if ministrating his own personal hygiene was going to help the man get on his feet again, then John was not going to stand in his way.
“Dam- dam-,” he struggled with the enunciation, then angrily grabbed his phone, typing then putting it to John’s face to see.
Though he loathe to do it, John called Mycroft as he placed his uneaten platter of food back into the fridge. Not an hour later, a heart monitor, oxygen unit, automatic blood pressure cuff and additional medications and fluids were delivered to 221B courtesy of Sherlock’s brother.
Sherlock no longer had a lopsided, uneven appearance, though with his gaunt features, he did look a bit like a prisoner of war.  John sighed, tucked the detective back in bed, and retrieved a dark gray knitted hat from his service days.
John returned to his seat and leaning forward, took Sherlock’s hand in both of his. This was a question that had been raised many times in the past weeks: the detective’s concern with the outcome of the plastic surgery. John had dutifully provided the same, reassuring answers.  “You saw the computer imaging the doctors did, Sherlock. They measured every picture of you they could get their hands on – imaged them, studied them, and created your new nose from that information.” John sought out the detective’s worried eyes. “It’s skin and bone, so it’s not going to be exactly like it was. But very, very close,” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand and the detective finally raised his eyes. “It’s going to be all right.”
John poked at the fire, trying to pin down just what he was feeling right now. He felt that thought bubbles, indicative of those three undulating dots when he knew he was receiving a text, were floating about his head. He kept waiting for the message to come through.
After a few days at the hospital, John had decided the best care would be the only kind he himself could give Sherlock, in the quiet privacy of their flat. Sherlock had detested the hospital, eating nothing, dry heaving on the meds, swinging his wounded appendage at the doctors and glaring, one-eyed through his bandages, frightening the nurses. Even then he barely spoke a word, lips hard pressed in a thin line, head turned away. Sherlock did fill John with relief when he granted John a quick nod at the suggestion of going home. They had to sneak out the back of the hospital into a waiting ambulance to avoid the vultures of the press, eager to be the first to snap a picture of the detective’s disfiguring injuries. The orderlies were not the gentlest, ratcheting Sherlock’s cot up the stairs into 221B brusquely. John looked on in dismay as Sherlock shut his eyes and his face drained of any remaining color at the pain. When they finally got him into his bedroom, John was the one insisting on clasping Sherlock under the arms and moving him gently onto his own bed. The former military man had always been a strong man and had lifted Sherlock in the past, but the feel of Sherlock’s fragile, skeletal frame shocked him. John vowed to heal and fatten the man up.
“Jesus,” John moaned, arching his back to increase the pressure. His body thrummed. He could not remember a time when he had ever been so turned on. But it was just not the physical. Knowing who it was that he was kissing made him lightheaded.  Without ceasing his soft kisses, John unbuttoned Sherlock’s silken pajama top and pushed it off his shoulders to reveal a smooth, alabaster chest.
Then Sherlock did something John never expected. He put down his violin and bow, marched over to him with purpose, clasped him by the hand, and led him into the bedroom. Sherlock directed John into his customary chair and the detective sat on the edge of the bed, facing him.
“It’s all right, John. I’d do the same. To take care of someone you care about…its almost a gift. To be the person they depend on, that provides comfort…I understand,” she shrugged and busied herself with paperwork on the lab bench.
John clasped her hand and pulled her along with him down the hallway and into the next wing. Dr. Wadsworth, and the specialist, Dr. Herry, met them outside the door. The look on their faces said it all.
“Up now, time for a bit of a walk,” John said, pulling back the edge of the blankets. Sherlock’s eyebrow raised in surprise.
“Might take some getting used to, but I like the idea – wait, don’t move -,” the doctor scuttled off the bed to grab a tissue to wipe away the droplet of blood that appeared under Sherlock’s nose. “We should maybe refrain from too much, eh, exertion until we are sure you are healed up.” Indeed, Sherlock was pale, the red lines of his scars in stark contrast to his pallid skin. With a shaky hand he accepted a new tissue.
, John thought as he withdrew, mentally clenching his heart protectively against what may occur next.
Sherlock growled and punched the bed in frustration. John realized his mistake. He needed to just let the poor man talk. The fear and vexation present in the detective were a hot hurricane of feelings that Sherlock would not normally be able to express – but now, with his injuries and John’s impatience, it was infinitely more impossible.
“Here, let’s get that coat off. And the hat. It’s been a long day and you don’t have all your strength back yet.”
Sherlock responded by crossing his arms, no easy task in the small hospital wheelchair he was sitting in and pouted. The thin hospital gown slid off his shoulder and it took all of John’s self-discipline not to reach over and fix it. The waves of anger rolling off Sherlock were as visible as Mojave heat.
“Eh, now might not be good, Greg,” John responded, glancing at Sherlock who had quickly moved over to the window to gaze out onto Baker Street, his back to them.
“Ahh,” John cried as his hands sunk into Sherlock’s curls. He relished the feel of Sherlock’s lips brushing, kissing, his tongue tasting, his mouth everywhere at once, not realizing the quick work he had made of the buttons and belt of John’s pants until Sherlock’s hand was down there, touching him. “God!” John exclaimed at the feel.
John obliged and went back to his reading, glancing up every once in a while, noting that Sherlock would pinch off a piece of crumbly scone and push it into the left side of his mouth. This produced a fair bit of mess, but John ignored it, unwilling to make Sherlock self-conscious.
“What do you mean?” John said, tearing his eyes away from Sherlock’s to return his attention to their landlady. “Ah, the parts for the nose? It’s from a cadaver. The cartilage, that is. The skin is actually grown in a lab.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand as the doctor turned to head into the kitchen, and John looked at him in surprise. Mischief alighted the detective’s eyes.
“Thank you, doctor,” John said, and with an understanding nod, she left the room. A quiet figure almost immediately appeared in the hospital room doorway.
He put on the kettle instead and went out to the living room, pressing his forehead against the window overlooking Baker Street, seeing but not seeing the pedestrians, the taxis….
He tip-toed into the bedroom and undressed. The detective lay on his back, one arm flung over his head, mouth slightly open and breathing deeply. A high circle of red sat atop each cheekbone, two cherries like one would see on the face of a flushed little boy. It was completely endearing.
“And John, should there be anything you need…be sure and let me know,” Mycroft’s tone softened for just an instant, and giving a mock bow to the flatmates, he departed the apartment. John quickly locked the door behind him, and both men gave out the large breaths they had been holding.
“You may think this is all happening now because you are at your most vulnerable. Others may think that, too,” John paused there, purposefully leaving Mycroft’s name out of the conversation. “But sometimes it takes a traumatic incident to bring people together. To remind them of their mortality. To make them realize how they – I – cannot possibly have a life without you,” John finished, his voice weak.  He watched as his own fingers began to slowly clench into fists. He could not breath, his heart did not beat.
“I was planning on replacing your bandages tomorrow, but looks like they’ve been a bit, eh, displaced. Why don’t we take them off and I’ll see if I can’t have less of them on you. Sound good?”
Back in the bedroom, Sherlock sat sullenly in the upholstered chair beside the bed while John stripped it and put on clean sheets.
Sherlock ran his hand down John’s ribcage and leg, those long fingers rubbing and pressing his flesh, stroking up and down in a long, gentle motion.
It was late morning when John read the email, his eyes burning from lack of sleep. It had been a long night, Sherlock muttering in his fevered state, legs jerking, burning eyes boring into John without seeing. It was 4 am when the fever finally broke and John was able to collapse into the cot, and when he woke a mere hour later, he had been startled to find-
“Hey, easy there, remember what I am!” John laughed, standing and stretching. “And you are lucky enough to find two outstanding doctors that are willing to make house visits.”
John pulled back and shook his head, not understanding. Sherlock’s mouth set tight and he waved a hand around his face as he pushed himself away.
John walked the doctors and nurse out, and at the door, shook their hands. “Thank you so much. I know its certainly not conventional to make house calls. We very much appreciate it.”
“Whaaat well I luk like?” Sherlock whispered, his doubt-filled eyes intent on their still-clasped hands.
“I have to just clean it up a bit, and reapply,” John said quietly as he turned Sherlock’s head towards the light. Yes, the skin graft on his cheek, down to his chin, and under his eye were looking good and pink, the tiny stitches by the talented plastic surgeon barely visible. His right eye was fine, just a bit swollen shut. The side of Sherlock’s nose had only been hastily done, with plans for reconstruction later. At the sight of Sherlock’s ear – or lack thereof – it took all of John to control the emotions on his face. Only remnants of some cartilage were left – apparently, when Sherlock was found on his side on the floor, his ear was swimming in a puddle of the acid. The entire ear would have to be reconstructed. So intent was John that Sherlock had to nudge him to look at his phone.
“There will be lots of drainage, let us know if it’s anything alarming. Keep up with the massager…and I think that’s it. Let’s give you a few weeks to adjust and heal, then we will be getting going on that ear. And, uh, I will need my phone back, please,” she joked, as Sherlock was continuing to investigate his new appendage closely in its reflection. He handed it back, abashed, but was quickly appeased when John handed him his own phone to replace it.
“Yes, and I want to keep you here. Right here,” John claimed, pulling Sherlock even closer. They kissed, tasting the salt of each other’s tears. John dug his fingers into Sherlock’s back, fisting the silken gown. Sherlock explored John, tracing his hairline, his ear, his jawline with those tantalizing fingers. Lips on lips grew to tentative tongues, mouths widening. John could sense Sherlock was not altogether inexperienced, but must less so than he, so the doctor taught the eager student.
“That’s gud,” affirmed Sherlock, nodding, eyes alight. “I can beeth!” He took in a large breath through his nose but then winced.
“Tell you? What is there to tell except this horrible piss-poor excuse for a human took the same chemicals used to melt the flesh off hides of animals and used them on your face.” The words spilled out so fast that John was not sure if Sherlock’s silence was shock or lack of understanding of what John had said.
Sherlock nodded, his eyes straight ahead. John did not mention the fact that Sherlock had two eyes now to use to focus on the print, but instead retrieved the paper and pulled the chair up to his bedside and began to read. Twenty minutes in, John dropped the rag to his lap.
John bit his lip during the instruction, thinking about the war wounded he had bandaged, thankful for once that Sherlock’s sharp tongue could translate well into a text message. John would never forget one heinous message Sherlock held up to Dr. Ballard to read from his phone that got the plastic surgeon’s ears literally burning a brilliant red. John believed it was something about how John should bandage a certain part of Dr. Ballard’s anatomy very tightly -
And that’s when the detective knelt before the doctor and placed his head full of soft curls against John’s hands.
The two men touched lips, ever so lightly, just barely skin on skin, breath on breath, heat on gorgeous heat. There they stayed for a long moment, closer than ever before, each captivated by the moment. John felt the ghost of Sherlock’s eyelashes against his cheek as they slowly and reluctantly separated, not pulling away, but accepting the promise of more.
“Just a bit over the chest now, just to clean you up. There you go, that must feel good.” Indeed, Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes, his body sinking into the mattress. John ran the sponge over the detective’s smooth, alabaster chest, along the borders of Sherlock’s pectorals, over his stomach, down the sides of his body. He wrapped his fingers around each of Sherlock’s forearms and raised each arm in turn, cleaning the underarm and then the length of each arm. John took the time to wipe down each hand, then each finger, marveling at the length and strength of each, how elegant they looked as they lay atop the palm of John’s own stocky hand. Finally he wiped the hollows above each clavical, up under the neck, and gently over his face where he could. John went back and dried each slowly, noting how still Sherlock lay, how relaxed his face seemed to be. Then a swift shiver ran down Sherlock’s body.
The cupboard – aha, a scone mix. John gathered the ingredients – thank you, Mycroft, for our well stocked kitchen – and watched them while they baked in the oven, taking them out while they were just a touch underbaked, warm and buttery, soft and crumbly.
“Well, I think we better keep going with that,” he said more to himself than Sherlock. His hands trembled just a bit as he removed the patient’s bottoms. He ran the warm sponge down Sherlock’s long back and over his bottom, which clenched at John’s touch. John bit his lower lip, reminding himself that he was Sherlock’s doctor.
John instantly understood what Sherlock was trying to say: there was so much to say, so much fear, so much risk, so much to be afraid of –
The next morning when John awoke, he was momentarily disorientated. He was in Sherlock’s room, but not in the cot –
“Mmph,” was the reply, and John could not determine if it was a sound of agreement or protest as he himself stifled a yawn.
John looked up from the phone, perturbed. Sherlock was looking at him, eyes pleading, crumbs dotting his lips.
“You go on, now, get something to eat. I’ll be out for a bit this morning, but if you need me…,” she waved good-bye and closed the door. John made himself a plate of toast, jam and a couple of hard boiled eggs. He sat in the kitchen, a full plate in front of him. It was a bit disconcerting to have Sherlock’s microscope and other equipment tucked into a box in the corner, peeking out from the cardboard lid in silent protest, but beside that, he was content. He was home, and Sherlock was home. For the first time in a very long time, he felt in control. He would be the one supervising Sherlock’s care, making the decisions that would make the man whole again. In a way, it made him proud that he did not need anyone else. He was completely and totally capable at this moment in time.
They said their goodbyes, John promising to keep Molly up to date, then he opened the package. Inside was a small device, shaped to fit into his hand, with a circular metal plate at its top about the size of a bottle cap. John pressed a button to turn it on and touch the metal plate, which vibrated just in the slightest. It would be used to massage Sherlock’s face to promote healing and circulation to his new skin. But John was not cheered by the delivery. Sherlock was not eating because
“Kiss me,” John urged, barely recognizing his own voice, thick with need. Sherlock responded eagerly, and with a surge of boldness, John plunged his hand into the front of Sherlock’s pajama bottoms and embraced his erection. The detective was hard, so hard, the pulse of his heart beating a staccato in his cock under John’s palm.
Sherlock nodded, and John could see the immense exhaustion that was taking its toll on the man. Deep grey pockets underscored each eye, and the healthy glow that John had so rigorously induced with proper nutrition and exercise was beginning to fade. “Yooo said et doesn’t matter.”
“Ooh! Well, I guess that’s a good use for it, then! Good luck, Sherlock,” she said, rising out of the chair and giving the detective a kiss on the forehead. “You be good for the doctors – especially John. Good night, boys.”
“So much,” John repeated in agreement, but he could only hope that Sherlock would understand his meaning: that, yes, there was so much risk, but so much reward, so much life to live, so much love to share. John’s hand moved naturally to his flatmate’s back, pressing into Sherlock, holding him close.
Molly looked at him with sympathy, long ponytail resting on one shoulder. “You need some rest. Would you like me to come over for a day and help?”
“All right, let me look at your other spots. Arm first,” John gently put his hands under Sherlock’s right elbow and raised it, determining that the small area, less then 4 centimeters long and 2 centimeters wide, was properly bandaged and could wait. John raised Sherlock’s top carefully to insure the bandages wrapped around his ribs were still in place.
“That sounds fine. Thank you, Greg,” John said, and shut the door. “Phew! I’d forgotten what a persistent fellow he could be! Sherlock?” Sherlock’s face was in his hands, shoulders clenched high around his ears. The files had fallen to the floor, their contents scattered at his feet. John rushed to Sherlock’s side, who pivoted his body away from John in shame.
“I’ll be right here,” John called out to him, then hung his head in exhaustion as soon as Sherlock was out of the room.
“Ey don’t ever want to leah theese place,” Sherlock said, his eyes roaming from Billy the skull, to the bookcases, and finally resting on John. “Ey wees homesick.”
John sat back in his chair, reread the email a few times, and finally hit send. He stood up grabbed a few biscuits from the kitchen, the pile of towels and a bucket of warm water and went into Sherlock’s bedroom.
John convinced himself that he was relieved. The other side of that bridge had held something tantalizing…but not realistic. He knew that now. There was no bridge. Just the gaping chasm between the two men.
“Well, I’ll read you the interesting bits, that way we both hear it at once,” John said, flipping through the pages. “Maybe we’ll even get a case. There’s nothing wrong with your brain, you know.”
Another quick nod, and John, sensing an end to the conversation, picked up the paper and began to read again.
“Lay back down, it’s just a bit – ouff!” John exclaimed as Sherlock wrapped his long arms around him and pulled him back down on the bed. The detective patted his nose with the tissue for a moment, then seeing no more blood, tossed it on the ground.
Sherlock’s eyes closed again, the corners of his mouth twitching into a grin, and someone tapped John on the shoulder. It was Mycroft’s assistant.
“Sherlock, I had no idea you didn’t remember. I should have realized. It’s completely normal for a traumatic experience to be wiped from someone’s brain – even yours.” John saw Sherlock’s shoulders relax an inch at the compliment as he pulled off his shirt and replaced it with a silken top. John stared down at his hands, now clenched in his lap, as Sherlock changed out of his pants. The room was silent for several minutes and John finally looked up at Sherlock, who returned a burning glare.
“I miss you both very much,” she said, the look on her face showing she was a bit surprised at her own words. “I mean, I don’t see you in the lab at all any more. Do you think Sherlock will get back to his work, sometime?”
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock,” John cried as Sherlock began to jerk him off, each grinding motion against John’s backside pushing John into Sherlock’s fist. John clenched his buttocks, squeezing the detective’s cock with each thrust, eliciting an outcry of pleasure from his partner. It was a rhythm that quickly increased, until John’s body screamed for release, on the edge, but holding on, an unspoken promise, until Sherlock’s voice was in John’s ear again, like a mooring for John to hold onto against the desperate moans that were pouring from his mouth, from his body pounded like a boat in a storm,
“See there, it’s all good. You’re going to be sore in the mouth, so we’ve got some soft food for you here. You let me know when you think you can eat, even just a few bites. We’ll try in a bit, yeah? Cheeks and eyes are going to hurt, too. Everything has got to settle into place. I brought your phone so it’s just like old times, texting me every minute of the day,” John moved back easily into his monologue, knowing how the sound of his voice soothed Sherlock. “Don’t you worry, all that talking got you ahead of the game, you’ll be starting right back up again at it once the swelling goes down, we have to keep that face moving, no slowing you down.”
“Beautiful, Sherlock,” John applauded when the detective finished and turned around to face his doctor. “One of your own, I can tell.”
And then he felt his mouth open and he was talking and it was all very benign, as if he was addressing one of his patients in his military days, providing a front and saying all the right things, as untruthful as they could be. Being the reassuring doctor, voicing the words without feeling, turning the subject to something more cheerful, and finally sending Mrs. Hudson on her way with a kiss on the cheek and a promise to visit again very, very soon.
,” John managed. Sherlock slid off the doctor, leaving an arm thrown across his chest. With some maneuvering, John kicked off his pants and grabbed a corner of a blanket to pull over them.
