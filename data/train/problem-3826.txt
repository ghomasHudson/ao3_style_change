Dean almost convinced Cas to let him skip class — almost — but with great effort, he resolutely pushed Dean out the door.
Dean pulled away abruptly, too soon, and the give-or-take two feet between them might have ripped a hole in the space-time continuum, it was so cosmically wrong.
“Okay,” Cas said eventually. “I’ll come, unless that would make you uncomfortable.”
. He had been so busy in the shop that he had forgotten to buy a single gift. Bobby was easy — a fifth of Maker’s Mark and new trucker cap would be enough to bring tears to his eyes. Sam was more difficult; he lived in a different world. Dean thought he remembered that Sam liked
Dean turned and made his way to his room. He could vaguely hear Sam asking Cas what he wanted to watch, but his brain was swimming.
“I’d be better if my best friend hadn’t just graduated and forgot how to pick up a phone,” she replied, accusatory. Cas cringed.
“He invited me, and I haven’t got anything better to do,” Cas replied, mildly affronted.
He laid there for a moment, eyes closed, sinking into the false gyration of the room. Sam and Cas were talking in low voices in the living room, but Dean couldn’t pick out a single word. He opened the drawer in his bedside table, fumbling around for his headphones. His fingers brushed a stack of paper. Dean frowned and pulled it out.
“No, man, I get it,” Dean said with a shrug. “You’re busy. Sorry, that was kinda uncalled for. All in my head, you know.”
“Yes,” Meg said emphatically. “Tell him to fuck off. That’s exactly what he would do to you and you know it.”
Cas hit the bathrooms to brush his teeth and get ready for bed before checking his phone. His worry only increased when he saw that Dean hadn’t replied. He sent another text, hoping he didn’t seem too overbearing.
“Famous last words,” she muttered.
He heard Dean chuckle. “I thought class was important,” he said, but he shifted closer to Cas nonetheless.
?” Dean asked, feigning disgust.
Dean downed the rest of his whiskey and followed Cas’s example, dropping onto the couch half on top of him. Cas laughed and shoved him off without any malice.
“I —” Dean started, but stopped himself. His leg was bouncing rapidly, and he reached into the pocket of his jeans, presumably for a cigarette. Cas grabbed him by the shoulder.
Cas felt his heart break at that. There was a story there, a million things to unpack, but it was obviously a feat for Dean to say as much as he already had. Cas left it alone.
take care of Sam, Dean would finish that degree if it was the last thing he did. An argument, the only time Bobby had ever yelled at him. Dean and Sam sitting on the couch, sharing headphones and listening to Black Sabbath. Bobby pushing him out the door. Driving back to Wichita, numb.
Dean paid for his groceries and headed to the liquor store to pick up the whiskey for Bobby. Upon seeing a case of boozy eggnog, he couldn’t help remembering his first and only Thanksgiving in Wichita. They downed two pints of the stuff while watching
A week. He could do this for one week.
. “I’ll be perfectly fine here. I appreciate the offer, I do, but I don’t want to make life more difficult for you than necessary.”
“I wish you hadn’t left,” Dean blurted. Even against the haze of whiskey, he cringed at the frankness of the confession.
important,” he reminded Dean.
“I didn’t say ‘better’,” Cas interrupted. “Just different.”
Dean rolled his eyes and made a motion with his hand that said,
They went on like this for hours, until the carton of eggnog was empty and the whiskey was halfway there. Dean’s ribs hurt from laughing, and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d had this much… fun.
Ellen and Jo were family, mutual friends of John and Bobby. Since Dean could remember, John had been sending him and Sam back home to Lawrence to spend Christmas with Bobby. He didn’t realize until he was older that it was less “go have fun with your Uncle Bobby,” and more “I can’t stand the holidays and would like to be unconscious for most of them.” A few years before his dad died, when Dean was maybe fifteen, the Harvelle’s started joining them. It became a tradition, the Harvelle-Singer-Winchester Christmas affair.
She gave him a look. “How are your concussion symptoms?”
“Do you… Towel… Bleeding?” Not-Castiel was talking, but Dean could only make out a few words.
“Do what?”
When Cas reentered the room, he stared at Dean’s shattered cell phone. He didn’t even bother to clean up the mess, just let out a choked sigh. Cas fell into the beanbag, his head in his hands.
“Merry Christmas,” Dean said, when the other two had parted. “You remember Cas?”
“Of course,” Cas said, and his voice sounded dead, even to him. He tried to infuse it with some vitality as he finished. “Thank you for inviting me. I had a great time.”
Dean glanced sideways at him as they entered the stairwell. “Why? ‘Cause you’re gay?’ He asked.
Dean blinked. “Yeah. Yeah, sorry,” he said, rubbing a hand over his face. “I’m beat, honestly,” he said. “I think I’m gonna hit the hay.”
“I… think I’ll take a shower,” he said, clearing his throat. He put his plate in the dishwasher and made to leave, but thought better of it and grabbed the mug of coffee on his way to Dean’s bedroom.
Dean slumped into the beanbag with a sigh. Cas remained at the door, leaning his weight against it.
They didn’t make it to the party.
Cas could hear Sam asking Dean if he was okay.
“Cas says that our kid is this little lighthouse of love and of healing energy and crap.”
“My Cas…”
“Cas-”
He stroked Cas’s cheek.  He couldn’t be mad.  This felt awesome.
“I can’t ask that of you.”
“Empty…”
“I can do it myself.”
Cas could see Dean’s pupil’s begin to dilate.  He watched the words form on Dean’s lips.
Dean’s voice broke and cleared his throat. Then he just wrapped his arms around Cas’s waist.  He just kissed him nice and gentle for a while.
Jack’s tone was sulky.  There was something distinctly Cas-like about it. Sam held out a hand and helped them up, then wrapped them in his coat.  The kid must be cold.  Sam’s coat covered Jack’s torso easily.
“And we should name a certain someone. The sooner he has a name, the sooner I can actually think of myself as a dad.”
Cas was about to explain that Dean had already eaten him out, as if Dean didn’t know that.  Dean raised his eyebrows. For once, Cas got with the program and didn’t make him ask again.  He just blessed Dean with a crinkly smile and nodded.
Castiel filtered through the languages in his head.  They had become jumbled together.  He could no longer tell any Latin based language apart. What was the point?  They all sounded the same anyway.  Dean’s knot went down in record time, but Dean was fidgety the whole time he was inside of Cas. Cas was stuck in a semi conscious state.  He knew that Dean was there.  Dean smelled like he was in trouble.  He reeked of fear, guilt, and there was something deep like a bonding hormone.  Castiel rolled onto his back, begging in whatever language rose to his lips.  He wasn’t even sure that they were all Latin based any more.  He didn’t care.  He just wanted more Dean.  He loved Dean. He loved Dean and wanted Dean to want him.  Castiel begged to be mated completely.  He needed to smell them together.  He needed the chemistry and the endorphins.  He was in physical pain with wanting.  Dean soothed his hands over Castiel’s body.  He was whispering sweet endearments as helplessness oozed into his scent.  Finally, Castiel leaned forward and kissed him quiet.  Dean’s scent changed then.  It became sweet with surrender.  Castiel was able to focus on what Dean said next.
Castiel felt better.  There was some relief.  He still felt dazed and a little desperate.  Castiel was too hot.  Castiel pushed his hips back, seeking the thing that his body needed.  Dean shushed him, running his palms over Castiel's sides.
When he spoke Jack’s name, his grace rippled and broke open.  His human eyes began to leak grace.
“Dean…  That is so much better…”
Then, Dean, blessed Dean, held his cock in one hand and laid back. He allowed Cas to push back at his own pace, maintaining eye contact the all the while.  Dean’s other hand gripped his hip for support.  Cas slowly slid down, down, down.  Dean was so deep inside him.  He couldn’t believe anything could go quite that deep.  He was so full.  It was glorious.  Cas leaned back for a moment, bathing in the feeling of fullness.  He felt physically complete.  This was the puzzle piece that had been missing.  Cas could feel Dean watching him.  He could hear Dean’s labored breathing.  He rotated his hips experimentally.  Oh…
“I don’t know who else it would have been.”
Cas glowered at him.
There it was, out in the open.  He hoped that he wouldn’t have to repeat himself.  It was hard enough to say it once. Those ‘three little words’ as all the soppy, lovesick losers always said.  They weren’t little.  They were huge, scary, words.  Once he said them, it was like this giant weight had been lifted from his heart.  It was like something toxic had been removed to make room for nothing but his love for Cas and everything that it meant to be them.
When Dean returned to the basement, he found Cas leaning where he’d left him.  The wound in his arm hadn’t quite closed.
“How long has it been out there?”
“Give it to me... I need it…”
It felt odd to be rocked.  Dean had not really been rocked since his mother was alive.  Here he was, a grown ass man, allowing Cas to hold him and sway back and forth.  He was so proud that Cas liked his scent.  It made him feel like a good Alpha.  Like he was taking care of Cas.  Cas was getting what he needed.  Cas felt good, he told Dean to bite harder.
“Hey now!  Guess we better do this huh?”
Castiel shrugged in a noncommittal way.  He was still chewing, or he would have said he was ‘fine.’ He was not fine.  He was frying inside of this body without relief.
“I thought you didn’t sleep.”
Dean took hold of Castiel’s face with both of his hands, and pulled him down for another kiss.  This time it was clumsy and hot.  Dean nearly missed his mouth.  Castiel continued to pet Dean’s hair and allowed Dean to hold him while they explored each other’s mouths.  Dean tasted like Cas, which made him moan a little.
“Dude, what is wrong with you?”
“Cas?”
Dean knelt there beside Cas’s body, unwilling to comprehend that time was passing.  Unwilling to acknowledge that there was a throbbing pain in his knees.  Cas looked so peaceful, like he had been sleeping. Sleeping people usually breathe...  People usually don’t look so angelic in death.  But Cas WAS an angel after all.  Other than the Small hole in his shirt and the blood stain on his lap, Cas looked like he could have sat up and given him a little ‘hello Dean.’  Dean needed to get with the program.  Cas wasn’t sleeping.  He wouldn’t sit up and he wouldn’t speak.  Cas was dead.  Dean was a bit horrified to find wandering to Cas’s unzipped fly and unbuckled belt.  He absentmindedly did them up for Cas, god knew why. His hand came away wet with fresh blood.  Cas had been bleeding.  He’d bled a lot and yet, he hadn’t stayed put.  Where was the child?  Where was Jack?  Dean tried to stand, but his knees buckled.  He had been kneeling next to Cas all night.  An unexpected rage swept through him.  Cas was a dumb son of a bitch who should have stayed put.  This would have never happened if he hadn’t gotten Cas all knocked up.  Jack had hurt Cas real bad and opened some other portal.  Lucifer wanted Jack’s power, that’s why he was here.  Dean would literally give an arm and a leg to have Cas back.  He’d rather Jack not exist at all and have Cas back.
“Not true,” Sam argued. “Listen, I know that he left or whatever, but I’m sure he had a good reason, you know, and you
When he returned, Dean was gone, but Cas saw a notification on his phone.
As he drove to the Wal-Mart at the edge of town, he wondered idly if he would see Cas again. Dean supposed, at the very least, he might see Cas when he and Bobby had his car fixed. Unless Bobby fixed it before Dean got back to work. He snorted at the thought. That was unlikely.
sorry this one took so long to get up! i was an idiot and broke my foot :) happy new year to everyone! <3
The music softened, no doubt due to Bobby’s bringing the customer into the shop. Dean groaned.
He sighed as he reached for a compression gauge. If Bobby had been right, and the valves really
Dean looked up from fumbling with his keys. There was a brown paper bag taped to his door, his name written on the front in clean, capital letters.
“What? No, no,” Dean said quickly. “I just thought he might.”
“The truth,” Dean repeated, his eyes remaining resolutely shut. Another deep breath. “It wasn’t supposed to go like this,” he said finally.
Cas rolled his eyes. “It’s cold out here,” he said. “Let’s go inside.”
showed up in his shop and practically gave you a heart attack,” she said. “He must’ve forgotten to mention it was
“That what?”
A smile tugged at Cas’s lips. “I’m glad.”
“I’m not gonna do that,” Dean said shortly.
His only lifeline. He was not, would never be, John Winchester.
“Damn, all right, if you want to get rid of me that bad,” Dean griped, smirking. “See you later.”
Cas was still chuckling a little. “A box set of
“Trust me,” Cas said ruefully, and he suddenly seemed stone-cold sober. “You’ll thank me later.”
Go to class.
“It wasn’t a marathon,” Cas replied smartly, but he smiled a little.
Maybe it was the implication behind the words, or the way Cas said them. Dean felt a pang in his chest for the friendship they’d once had. In the early morning light, with Cas in his passenger seat, he could almost believe they’d never lost it. He could almost convince himself that Cas had just moved away. That they saw each other sometimes, grabbed a cup of coffee, reminisced about the old days. No bad blood, just fond memories. The kind of friendship that sits in the back of the sock drawer, a pleasant surprise when it’s found.
Dean opened his mouth, tried to think of a good response to that, and closed it again.
Once the three of them arrived back at the bunker, Sam showed Jack Cas’s old room.  Jack stared around with an understanding that was alien to Sam.
“That's a talk you need to have with Dean.”
Cas asked.
“You are so beautiful when you sleep.”
Dean was flooded with understanding and awareness.  Then he was wrapped up in the feeling of trust.
Cas smelled nice and soft as a human.  Dean decided not to think about the fact that he smelled like sex or that he had been homeless for several days.  When he had been stabbed, Dean had begged for his life.  He was shameless in a way he had only ever been with Sam before.  Dean Cupped his face as he came to.  He almost kissed him right on the mouth, but didn’t...
“Cas?”
“Always wanted a family of my own…  Not just Sam, but like…  Mated with kids…  If it's ours Cas, its family…”
Castiel’s gaze drifted off, as if he were actually seeing it all again.
“It feels…  Nice…  Being one with you…”
Cas nuzzled unto Dean’s neck.
‘I think I have to come out now.  I’m afraid.’
Dean’s chest was so tight.
Dean purred in his sleep, chasing the heat and the friction.
Sam thought he might cry again.
Castiel stopped talking when he saw that there was a tear shining on Dean’s cheek.  Castiel kissed it away without thinking about it.  He took it into himself, relishing the feeling.  He climbed into Dean’s lap without a word and kissed him all over.  He kissed Dean’s cheekbones, his lips, the corners of his mouth, where the lines were beginning to show,  his hairline, the creases in his forehead, the crinkles  at the corners of his eyes, his eye lids, his-
“No Jack…  I’m not your father…”
Dean felt his ears and neck going hot and red.
“Good night Dean.”
Dean gestured for the coffee. Sam nodded.  Dean got up and poured him some.
“No Dean…”
Cas’s eyes grew dark as he nodded.
“Have fun.”
“Hot…”
“Why couldn’t I see or smell it before?”
The Nephilim just stood there, staring at Sam with those yellow eyes.  Jack stared like they could get the answers out of Sam if they did it hard enough.  Maybe they could. Dean burst in, right on cue, bellowing Sam’s name. There was blood on his hands.  He stopped abruptly when he saw the naked nephilim.  Sam reacted just a second too late.  Dean was raising his gun.  He was going to shoot his newborn child.  He may not realize that this was Jack.  Dean was expecting a baby, for crying out loud.  Sam didn’t know what he’d do if his partner had just been murdered right after giving birth in this room.  Now there was an adult stranger standing in a pool of blood where the kid should be.
Dean knew he must smell like horny alpha.  Cas’s voice was doing things to him.
Dean ignored him and sat down across from him.
“So um…”
Would not meet Sam’s gaze.  Sam guessed that Cas and Dean definitely could have made a half angel baby. If the Nephilim had been created by Alpha and Beta angels with human Omegas, Sam had yet to find a reason on why it couldn’t be done the other way around.  Castiel had insisted, rather pissily, that angels were meant to be steryl.  Until he had heard of the Nephilim, he had thought that they had always been that way.  Again, no, he had never had a heat.  Why must Sam ask such pointless questions?  No, he had no idea why it was happening now.  He was just happy that it was Dean.  Don’t be stupid. Cas would not entertain the thought of the two of them having created a Nephilim.  Cas knew that, if the thing had come into being, he would have the impulsive desire to smite it.
Dean asked.  He was hopeful it was that.  Sam kept looking from Dean to Cas and began rubbing his face aggressively.
“Dean?”
Dean’s gasped and his hips rolled, creating friction that made Castiel moan out loud.  Dean sent him a wicked grin.
“Only you could make that statement hot.”
Jack looked from Dean to Sam with wide eyes.  Sam shot Dean a pointed look, Dean’s face was set in a mask.
Dean’s dick ached in his jean’s, but he refused to unzip them.  He had almost forgoten how intence heat sex was.  He tried to forget that it was Cas, but that was not a possibility.  If anything, that was making it better for him.  Add that to the list of things not to think about or talk about ever.
“Cas?”
Cas was perfect.  He did his best to look out for Dean, to protect Dean.  Dean was hungry, but he had to say one thing.  God he hated talking.
“I've been so unhappy all this time.  The one thing I want is the one thing I thought I couldn’t have.”
“I could have done it with a thought. But then, there would be nothing left of what happened.”
Cas pressed Dean’s hand to the top of his bump.  Dean’s stomach did a flip flop.  That was their kid in there.  Weird. He felt a faint flutter under Cas’s skin. Then he saw a gray sky, Lucifer, a rift in the air.  A rip in this world.  Dean pulled his hand away.
“Cas?”
“Thank you Sam.”
Cas pushed back.  He seemed eager and had finally found his voice.  Dean was also speaking, but he wasn’t really paying any attention to it.  It was just a bunch of praise mixed in with some dirty talk.  He didn’t even remember doing it later.
“What can we do?”
Dean Groaned.
“Get over here.”
“Dean.”
Dean rolled his hips forward one more time, and his knot popped inside.  Dean purred and his teeth sank down into the back of Cas’s neck.  Cas’s body clamped down on the knot, milking it, but it did not give him any cum.  Dean’s teeth grounded him.  He was still so feverish.  Dean continued to purr, which soothed Castiel’s aching mind a little.  He wished that Dean would never pull away.  When he did, he smelled worried.
“Why can’t you heal it?”
Cas pulled his undershirt up to his arms.  Oh yeah.  He was still wearing that.  Dean yanked it off, as per Cas’s instruction.  Cas then proceeded to lie face down with his ass up in the air. Dean growled and shoved him so that he was on his side. Cas scowled up at him until Dean arranged him how he wanted.  Dean wanted Cas on his back.  He wanted to see him.  He wanted to be able to scent him and kiss his mouth.  Cas took Dean’s Cock in his hand and guided it in.  Dean hid his face under Cas’s ear.  This was such a relief.  Cas wrapped his legs around Dean and stroked his back.  Dean wanted to take care of Cas, but the animal inside him wanted to fuck. Dean snarled and snapped his hips.  Cas made a nice sound, so he did it again.  Dean bit down, just to reassure himself that his mate was here.  His thrusts were long and hard, but not fast.  Dean let his hands hold onto Cas’s hips, caress his belly, whatever they wanted.  He moaned.  Dean didn’t want to cum yet, but Cas felt and smelled too good.  He wanted to cum together.  Dean took Cas's cock in his hand and jacked him in time.  All Cas said was ‘Oh.’ and Dean felt his omega chanel spasm Dean growled.  His knot popped inside and came deep inside of Cas.  Cas smelled like home, mate, family… Dean purred and lapped at the fresh bite. Cas took his face in his hands and looked him in the eye.  He searched Dean’s face.  Dean rolled them onto their sides.  He wanted to kiss Cas, so he did.  They kissed lazily until Dean could think clearly enough to speak. He didn’t want to, but Cas insisted.
Dean relayed the news to Bobby, who just shrugged and grumbled about how Dean’s concussion was about to cost him three grand between labor and parts. Dean spent the rest of the day changing oil and air filters, performing alignments, rotating tires. It felt good to be back in the shop.
Meg raised an eyebrow. “And they can’t pick up the phone for two straight weeks?”
“He would have proved that a week ago if he had sat down with you to talk it all out,” Meg grumbled.
The rest of the drive was quiet. Dean turned on the stereo, and “Whole Lotta Love” played softly through the speakers. The drive that had earlier felt like an eternity now seemed all too fast. Dean was not looking forward to explaining to Sam why Castiel Novak was their new roommate for the foreseeable future.
The gravity of the question, the look in Cas’s eyes, curious and almost pleading, sucked the air right out of Dean’s lungs. And there was something screaming at the back of his brain, that no, he wasn’t, that he hadn’t been, that he could never be, because the one key ingredient to that happiness was —
Dean smiled weakly, but it was brief. “I just — you’re never around, man,” he said, rubbing the back of his head. “I feel like I fucked something up somehow.”
“Barely,” Cas said, his frown deepening. And then his hand was moving without his permission, reaching up to dust the remaining white from the side of Dean’s mouth. It might have been nothing, were it not for the fact that his thumb lingered just a moment too long. Cas was staring at Dean’s lips, the breath stolen from his lungs.
. Well, he is, but he’s hangin’ out with some girl in friggin’ Kansas City after Christmas.”
Sam smirked at him. “You’re old, dude.”
“Thank god,” Dean muttered as she updated his chart. “Does that mean I can go back to work?”
“I told you,” Dean grumbled. “The right thing.”
Dean shot him a confused look. “Why not?”
“Yo,” Sam said, waving a hand in front of his face. “You hear me?”
“Said it would still probably scar, but at least I’m back in the shop.”
“I don’t want to have this conversation again,” Cas grumbled. He was emotionally exhausted from the sine wave he was riding, fluctuating between anger and desperate sadness.
Go to class. Again.
“‘S good to see you, Sammy,” Dean said, radiating warmth. “Let’s go, Bobby’s itchin’ to give you a beer.”
He sat through an accounting lecture painfully and with disinterest, pointedly ignoring apologetic texts from Meg. 19th Century British Literature was next, but even this felt like a monumental effort, a commitment to note-taking the only thing staving off a boredom-induced nap. Mercifully, the end of his day on campus came, and he walked back to his dorm in a fog, resisting the urge to pull out his phone and call Dean.
Cas raised an eyebrow at the offer but nodded. “Are you sure I won’t be imposing? I don’t—"
The roads were Saturday-morning quiet. Dean relished the silence and the sting of the cold air on his face. He usually tried to wait until after breakfast, but he took out his lighter and lit a cigarette, anyway. The burn in his throat was a welcome familiarity. Dean sighed against the nicotine buzz. It had been a few days.
“Go to bed, Dean,” he said, soft and sad.
“...We’d love to meet her, right Dean?”
playing on the old TV. Bobby popped open two bottles of cheap champagne, much to the chagrin of Jo and Sam, who were provided sparkling grape juice instead. They exchanged gifts, and Dean looked at Cas like he’d just won the lottery after opening Cas’s gift to him, a limited edition copy of
Cas narrowed his eyes. “Nothing very specific. I suppose a girlfriend, a good job, doing something you like, in a place that you liked. You used to speak so fondly of Texas, I thought maybe you’d moved there. You told me, once, that you had thought about engineering. I usually pictured you like that, an office job. A stable life.”
“Well after… You know, I read that thing you wrote. And it was good, Cas, it was damn good.” Something lodged itself uncomfortably in the back of his throat as he recalled the nights he spent wondering where Cas had been, what he’d been doing. He coughed. “I guess I just expected that, by now, you’d have published it. Made a shit-ton of money and bought a douchebag-sized house in, like, Ohio, or something.”
“I noticed.”
“Oh.”
Cas learned many things on the two-and-a-half hour drive to Lawrence — that Dean knew every word to every song in his tape collection, and he was not afraid to demonstrate it; that Dean had driven through almost every town on I-35; and that he had a story for each. He learned that Dean could begrudgingly appreciate 80s pop when Cas flipped on the radio and allowed the entirety of “Heat of the Moment” to play, uninterrupted. He learned that Dean would often turn to sing his favorite lyric right at Cas, or to tell him music trivia, or just to give him a smile.
“What should I do?” He asked.
“Dean, I don’t have to come,” Cas said.
Cas frowned as he put his key in the lock and realized the door was already unlocked. He had been pretty sure he’d locked it when he left.
Finally, mercifully, Dean pulled into the dorm parking lot. Cas exhaled hard, as if he’d been holding his breath. Dean gave him a quizzical glance, which Castiel promptly ignored. When Dean shifted into park, Cas had his hand on the door handle immediately. He was about to open it, to take a breath of frigid, fresh air, when Dean grabbed his other wrist.
Dean still had a hand on Cas’s, as if to steady him.  His body language changed then from concerned partner, to no nonsense hunter.
“Uh…  Jack…  Do you want to pick a room?  I can show you…”
Castiel leaned down and grabbed a washcloth and soap.
Castiel glanced at it.  It was now seeping his vessel’s blood  and grace.  His blood trickled down from the place there he clutched Dean’s forearm and soaked the sheets.   Dean leaned over and yanked his pillow case free of his pillow.  He ignored Castiel’s feeble protests that a turnacuit would not help him.  Dean was a caregiver.  His need to help, care for, and give overrode all protest.  Castiel’s weak grace swelled with love for him.  Castiel pulled him down for a chaste kiss on his lips. They were as soft as they looked.
Dean stared nakedly at him.   Dean and Sam flat out refused.  Dean knelt beside him and kissed his forehead, even as he growled in pain.
“Difficult…”
“I forgot…  I’m on really aggressive suppressants…”
Cas stood and unbuttoned his pants.  He toed off his shoes and let his slacks and boxers fall to the floor.  Cas locked eyes with Dean’s and held his gaze.  His hand wandered back as he collected the slick dripping from his hole.  He couldn’t resist slipping the tip of his finger inside.  Cas let out a contented sigh.  He watched Dean’s eyes go wide.  The scent of his arousal was mouth watering.
“Castiel taught me english and Inochian when I still couldn’t live independent of him.  We were working on Latin, but then…  I had to come out…  Do you have anything to eat?  I’m very hungry.”
“For artificial slick…”
‘It’s true.’
Dean shook his head.
“You’re…  Not angry?...”
Dean rested his chin on Cas’s shoulder.
“Hey Cas.”
Dean placed his hands on either side of Cas's face and forced eye contact.  It wasn’t hard. Cas let himself be guided.  They just stood there, breathing each other's damp air.  Cas didn’t move.  His eyes were so big and blue and soft.  Dean had seen them sharp and hard, but not when they were directed at him.  Not now that Cas was himself.  Dean heard himself make a whimpering sound but couldn’t bring himself to be embarrassed.  He surged forward and kissed Cas on the mouth.  Cas’s lips were both wet and chapped. Dean tried to tell Cas that he needed to stay because I love you damnit. He kissed Cas again and again, nipping his lips, tasting them with his tongue.  Cas was really quite a good kisser, but it was Dean’s turn.   Cas was grinning. He was trying to say something, but Dean was determined to silence him.
Dean used the aspirin as an excuse to not look at Cas while he grabbed another water.
“Why did that sound like a goodbye?”
Dean was startled by the earnestness in his little brother’s voice.  Sam  was giving him puppy eyes.
Castiel sensed him leave.  Dean was sucking at his neck instantly.
“Yes…”
“We aren’t naming the child Damien, Dean.”
“Hey.”
Dean’s hips were still stuttering.  Castiel was so close.  Preejaculate had made Dean’s stomach so slippery. Castiel just needed a little more. He didn’t need to come, but it wouldn’t take much. He felt Dean’s knot pressing down against him.
Finally, Cas met his gaze.  Cas’s eyes were so soft and content, that Dean just didn’t say anything.  It was taking a long time for his knot to go down.  Cas’s throat muscles kept flexing and his tongue didn’t seem to want to stop moving.   Cas would stay still for a long moment, then he would swallow and Dean’s knot would stay where it was.  Dean kept panting and running his hands through Cas’s hair.  Cas blinked slowly up at him.  His baby blues were so pretty.
“We’re done talking about this,” Dean said.
He’d been expecting Sam, but it was Cas who poked his head around the door. “Dean?” He said, “I’m going to use your shower, if that’s all right.”
Dean didn’t answer, just took a long drag, his gaze aimed resolutely ahead. Cas huffed and crossed his arms.
“Sammy, I swear to god, if you don’t play my song,” Dean yelled. Sam let out a huff and muttered something, but Dean didn’t catch it. He was too busy staring at Cas, who was sitting on the floor of Bobby’s living room, a massive smile plastered on his face. He looked ethereal, Dean thought, his dark hair perpetually disheveled, gold light glinting off his blue eyes. Dean must have been looking for ages, because Cas turned and raised an eyebrow at him.
Dean looked at him in anguish. “I shouldn’t have — I’m an idiot.” His voice sounded broken and raspy. “I fucked up on Thanksgiving, and now, shit, I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“Sam, just leave it,” he growled. “Come on. Bobby’s waitin’.” The kid had been home for thirty minutes, and he was already giving Dean a headache.
On Monday, he went back to see Dr. Barnes. She checked him over and determined that his stitches could be removed.
“But it’s my birthday.”
“There’s not,” Cas interrupted.
Dean got to work on a pot of coffee. He almost hoped that Sam wouldn’t wake from the noise, that he could put off the coming conversation as long as possible. But, of course, Sam woke up almost the moment the machine finished brewing.
Dean put the pan on his drying rack and paused, gripping the edges of the counter, his head hanging low to his chest. He took a breath. Here it was, the conversation he hated having. The one that tattooed “I’m a massive failure” in block letters on his forehead.
Dean knew Bobby was speaking, but all he could hear was, “Black car,” “Dean’s,” and “Thanks, boy.”
“You drove me to the hospital,” he muttered.
“Uh,” he said, and that was a great start. Dean cleared his throat. “Here,” he said, practically throwing a poorly wrapped gift into Cas’s chest. “Merry Christmas.”
Dean nodded once and finally made his way out of the room. Cas watched him go.
Sharpied across his forehead, he laughed so hard he fell off the couch.
An awkward silence settled over the living room as Dean and Cas ate their burgers. It was the first time they’d been alone since Dean had picked him up from the motel.
“Cas,” Dean said against his chest. Cas threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair.
“Remind me again why you didn’t file a missing person report?” Meg sounded only slightly exasperated, which was an improvement upon the last three times she’d asked the same question.
“Will your father and brother be there?”
Something shifted in Cas’s chest, and he swallowed. “It has.”
“I’m twenty-two, not eighty,” Cas deadpanned. “Yes, I’m still running.”
“Dean,” he said in a stern voice.
“Nothing,” Dean said. Then, “I just wanted to, uh. Well. Look, sorry for being a dick last night.”
“I apologize,” Cas said, and he couldn’t keep the earnestness from his voice. “I’m just feeling overwhelmed. I have two final papers, three exams, and two final projects coming up before the break.”
They held each other’s gaze for a moment. Tension was rolling off Cas in waves. This was good, Dean could work with this. Cas looking at him with some unknown emotion, trying to talk about what happened… The thought alone gave him a headache. But Cas looking at him like he was doing his best not to murder him, like he was insufferable and ridiculous, that, he could face.
He’d still been making himself busy. He spent twelve hours at the shop on both Tuesday and Wednesday, trying to catch up on the work he’d missed while he’d been out. Bobby had saddled him with the worst of the lot; Honda Odysseys and GMC Yukons that needed tire rotations or oil changes before enormous families made their Christmas treks. He’d started on Cas’s car, but hadn’t gotten much further than getting the old timing belt off.
Cas blushed. He pushed himself off the couch unsteadily and laid down next to Dean on the floor. He held Dean’s gaze with shocking gravity for someone who was so clearly drunk, and Dean found that he still didn’t want to look away.
Dean closed his bedroom door behind him and grabbed the bottle of scotch from inside his desk. As he poured a generous glass, he sifted through his final memories with Cas, trying to find something that would make those words make sense. He might have spent the better part of that spring in a haze, but he was sure he would have remembered telling Cas to leave. All he could remember was waking up on the floor of their room one morning, his clothes reeking of whiskey, one half of the room empty.

“She called this mornin’, said she and Jo’d be here on the 23rd.”
“Sorry,” Dean muttered.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “And?”
“Yes?” Cas responded.
Sam scoffed at him. “I mean, you weren’t trying to hide it or anything.”
“He hit you?” Cas asked, horrified.
Cas whipped his head around to look at Dean in confusion. “What?”
“Definitely not,” Dean said, throwing two pounds of ground beef into his basket. “The valves are bent, which means the timing belt’s fucked too. He’s stuck here until Monday, best case scenario.”
Jody shrugged. “Probably. I didn’t ask for specifics. Dean, what’s going on?”
“Hold on,” Sam said while Dean was in Wal-Mart getting dinner materials. Dean heard a door open and close on the other line before Sam began speaking again.
“Well, I’m elated that everything you’re passionate about has worked out for you,” Cas said, his tone caustic. “I suppose not everyone is so lucky.”
Dean closed his eyes. Counted to five. Breathed out. “Cas,” he said. He was doing his best to keep his tone neutral, but Cas was being stubborn, and he didn’t have the energy for that. “Just… Let me do this. Let’s just go inside. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll kick your ass back to the friggin’ Days Inn.”
“Dean,” Sam said, “What’s up with you today?”
Cas wrote a few hundred more words before finding a good stopping point. He scrolled to the top of his document and highlighted the scenes he wanted to use for his project. Dean brought him a cup of coffee, which Cas accepted eagerly, beginning to feel the first twinges of exhaustion through his inspiration-fueled mania.
“So.” Dean cleared his throat. He should just say it. “Cas is staying here for a while.”
Inside was… the
Another twinge of guilt soared through him, but he didn’t say anything more, just gathered his things for a shower. Dean still hadn’t come into the room when Cas pushed past him and made his way to the bathroom.
“No.”

in high school…
Dean groaned as he pulled into the parking lot. It was packed. He wasn’t sure what he expected — Christmas was little more than a week away.
Dean closed his eyes at the breath against his ear. “Forgot to mention it.”
“You wrote all that last night? Or this morning?” He asked.
Sam was uncharacteristically silent as Dean prepared the meal. He had some documentary playing on the TV. Cas was sitting in the armchair, reading a book. When the burgers were done, Dean delivered a plate to each of them.
Dean wanted to be righteously angry with Sam for not telling him sooner, and for dipping out on him at the first sight of something better. But the kid just looked so damn
him, Dean —”
Cas was sitting in the armchair with a book as Dean sunk into the couch, exhausted from two long days in a row. The history channel on. Dean wrinkled his nose and punched in the numbers for the Food Network.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Come on, that doesn’t count.”
And he knew he really
“That guy, who drove you to the hospital,” Sam said, carefully. “Was it Cas?”
?” He hissed.
“It was easily the best day of my life,” Cas joked.
Dean closed the bedroom door and set the bag down on his bed. He took off his jacket. Shed his t-shirt. Unlaced his boots. Splashed some water on his face. Brushed his teeth. Traded his jeans for sweatpants.
Bobby Singer was gruff-voiced and stoic, but there were tears in his eyes as he gave Dean a quick hug. He shook Cas’s hand firmly and said it was real good to meet him, after everything he’s heard. Dean went beet-red when Cas cast him a glance.
“No reason. Did he, uh, did he mention where he was staying?”
“Down at that bar on 14th, sometime around midnight. A couple of college kids jumped this poor guy on his way to an Uber. He got a little banged up, and they took his wallet, gave him a good scare.” Jody sighed. “I felt bad for him. Said he was from outta town, just passing through on his way to Kansas City.” She snorted. “Makes Lawrence look real nice, huh? You’re here for a couple of days, and you get mugged.”
“Y’all are throwing me a
“While Dean was at work, Cas and I liked to binge bad TV,” Sam explained. “There was this one day when they were literally only playing
“Come on, Bobby,” Dean protested, rubbing his eyes with a free hand. “Honestly, I’m already feelin’ loads better.”
“...So ya haven’t got a damn clue what’s wrong? It just stopped?” Bobby was asking.
“But I don’t need him,” he repeated.
Dean whispered something incomprehensible to Sam, which Cas tried not to notice, and then he was aware that Dean was following him. Cas took another sip of the coffee and set the mug on Dean’s nightstand, moving to his suitcase to find whatever decent clean clothes he had left. Dean emerged from the bathroom with a basket overflowing with clothes.
Dean shut his eyes, willing himself against getting out and slamming the door behind him. He was not looking forward to this conversation. “Yeah. It was Cas.”
Cas gave him a look. “I think, based on my current state, that you can infer the nature of my outing.”
Jo was looking between the two of them, openmouthed. “You guys are so fucking weird,” she said.
“Thank you,” she said, mildly triumphant. Cas rolled his eyes. “I didn’t want to say it, but it’s true, Cas. I didn’t know him all that well, but from what you told me, the guy has fucking issues.” When Cas didn’t reply, Meg sighed. “I just wouldn’t put it past him.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Point is,” he said, “this was a long time coming, but I’m an idiot and couldn’t work up the balls.” He was staring hard at his hands, the admission taking enormous effort.
Bobby was staring at Dean like he had recently grown a third arm.
A smile tugged at Cas’s lips. “You could say that.”
“He’s nothing, unless I want him to be something,” Dean said slowly, and his eyes were growing triumphant. “Cas, you’re a genius.”
all day, so Cas and I watched nine hours of it straight.”
“You totally did, man, it was horrible.”
“You look like shit,” Dean said by way of a greeting. Cas jumped, nearly toppling his cup. He took a deep breath as Dean sat across from him, folding his arms across his chest.
He felt like he was having deja vu. After Cas left school, just after spring break, Bobby had called Dean to see how he was getting on. He’d put Sam on the phone. Sam was only fourteen, but already smart as hell, sometimes able to see through Dean’s bullshit.
Sam grinned. “Yes!” He turned to Cas. “Dean makes the best breakfast.”
“What did he want?”
Dean opened the car door, and a rush of cold air assaulted the cab. “It’s nice out tonight,” Dean said. Cas hummed in agreement, contemplating Dean’s languid movements as he pulled his hoodie over his head. It was torturous, the way his shirt rode up to reveal a torso chiseled like marble, dusted with freckles. It was impossible not to stare. He looked away just before Dean looked at him again.
Dean was attempting to replace the fuel pump on a Ford when Bobby called out his name.
The year before, Dean had written him a check for ten thousand dollars, with “college” written in the memo. Sam had tried to give it back after realizing that was essentially Dean’s entire savings account, built up from working at Singer Auto Repair during the day and bartending the college joints at night. Two years straight. When Dean refused to take it back, saying, “You go and you get a damn degree, all right?”, Sam hugged him until he couldn’t breathe. Dean smiled at the memory. No way he was outdoing himself this year.
They settled into a somewhat comfortable silence, punctuated by Dean reading measurements from his phone and Cas dumping everything into a bowl. Dean grabbed bacon and orange juice out of the fridge, too, and while Cas set about frying and flipping the pancakes, Dean arranged the bacon on a pan, nudging him with a shoulder so he could put it in the oven. It was surprisingly comfortable in the small kitchen. Cas noticed Dean liked to clean as he went, and so he followed suit, rinsing out the bowl while the last pancake cooked.
consistent updates WHO? major thanks to everyone who left well wishes on the last chapter! and another big thank you to
Sam’s grin faltered at that, and Dean was already regretting this whole altruistic move. He just turned and made his way back up to the apartment, Sam and Cas close behind him.
“That depends,” Cas said, his heart hammering against his chest. “What was that?”
“We go to dinner every night,” Cas said. Dean wasn’t making sense.
“I was gonna — I dunno, I was gonna do it right. I’ve been meaning to do it right, ask you to fucking dinner or something, but then I thought you hated me after Thanksgiving, and you were busy all the time, and then we were in Lawrence, and —”
“It’s a long story,” Cas sighed.
Dean tapped his cigarette against his leg. “Mostly to remind me what a piece of shit I am.”
Dean walked into the office, and Bobby looked at him with murder on his face.
“Decide to get blackout drunk just because your father incorrectly assumed you were bringing me — bringing a male partner to a Christmas he wouldn’t even attend?”
“While you’re eating?” Dean wrinkled his nose in disgust.
Cas made his way to the bathroom, but stopped dead at the bedside table. He was staring at the papers.
Call Dean, get his voicemail.
“Days Inn,” he muttered to himself as he started the car, trying to remember how to get to KU from the apartment. He almost stopped and turned around more than once. Seeing Cas on a normal day was bad enough, but seeing him bruised and bloodied… Dean tried not to think about it. Just making sure he’s okay, he told himself. He’d do the same for me.
They were interrupted by Dean’s second alarm. Dean scowled as he turned it off. He looked at Cas expectantly, but Cas had his arms folded against his chest.
Dean was ruffled at being called out so bluntly. “No promises,” he muttered.
Cas made a face. “I happen to be endlessly thankful for your birth.”
Dean cleared his throat. “Sure,” he said. “No problem.”
Dean let out a sigh of relief. Maybe he could get Cas’s car done earlier than he thought.
Sam flipped him off, and Dean muttered, “Real mature.”
“You know,” Dean said, uncomfortable with the attention placed on him, “You didn’t turn out how I thought either.”
“Thought you said there was no story.”
Sam let out a huff of laughter. Dean raised an eyebrow and shoved him in the back. “What’s so funny?”
“Yeah, but you shouldn’t have done it without asking me first!” Dean hissed. He yanked his credit card from the machine and waited impatiently for his receipt to print.
It was his favorite class by far. In high school, Cas focused on writing short stories, mostly adapted from real life. His notebooks were his confidants, the product of never having a close friend. But now, he was challenged to write other things; poetry, scripts, memoirs. Cas lived for the challenge, finally able to stretch new creative muscles. And while his attempt at drama had received mixed reviews from his professor and peers alike, his other works were well-received. He’d never shared his writing with anyone, and to hear others enjoyed it was something Cas cherished.
“Yeah, okay.”
“‘S no problem,” Dean said. He grabbed his own plate and shoveled the food into his mouth, despite his appetite having abruptly left him at the revelation that Cas had been in Wichita far longer than he’d thought.
excited – about Charlie Brown…”
Cas narrowed his eyes. “Because I felt responsible for your concussion.”
Dean winced. “That’s… I forgot to tell him,” he said, sheepish.
. If this was some sort of peace offering, it was crap. He grabbed his phone and punched in the number.
It turned out, living with Cas was easy if Dean never saw him.
“No clue,” Dean replied, ripping the bag off the door. He unlocked the door and headed straight for the bedroom.
“Well, I… I finished that first year at Wichita State, off-campus. I transferred to the University of Oklahoma for the last five semesters. They have an excellent accounting program,” he added, as if that explained everything. Dean could feel his eyes on him, could practically taste the trepidation in his voice. “I was fortunate enough to intern at a firm in Kansas City last summer.”
“You don’t.”
“Be there in a sec,” Dean said. Cas was about to stand up, but Dean caught him by the wrist.
As they walked, Cas felt latent anger curl in his stomach. Dean hadn’t told Castiel much about his home life, not until that night. He understood, now, why Dean could so easily take care of others, but needed three beers and a cigarette to show his own vulnerabilities. In his eighteen years, had Dean ever been told that he was enough? The possibility that he hadn’t awakened something in Cas, some righteous fury.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said.
“But you didn’t —”
“And?”
“Mornin’,” he greeted the woman behind the counter. “I was wonderin’...” He paused mid-sentence as something caught his eye from the breakfast seating area. A man, nursing a cup of coffee and reading a newspaper, his dark hair sticking up in twelve different directions.
Once everyone had eaten to the point of sleepiness, they moved to the living room to exchange gifts. He genuinely teared up when Sam shoved a ticket to the 24 Hours of Daytona and a boarding pass into his face. Bobby laughed when he opened Dean’s whiskey, revealing he’d bought the same thing for Dean. Sam looked like he’d just won the lottery when he opened the limited edition box set of
someone. Or that I was feedin’ the boy for Christmas.”

Cas put three fingers up to the bruise, which was looking less black and more like splotches of blue and green. “Better,” he said decidedly.
“Never did figure that out,” Dean replied gruffly.
Dean knew his avoidance scheme was obvious, but what else could he do? Being in the same room as Cas for more than ten minutes made his head pound, and he was ninety percent sure it wasn’t his concussion. So Sam could raise his eyebrows all he wanted, Dean would still find all manner of errands to run and things to do.
“You were such a lightweight,” Dean teased. “I put on Charlie Brown next – bet you don’t remember that, either – and you were so fucking excited.” Cas was doubled over in laughter, and Dean was talking through his own. “I’ve never – in my life – seen anyone
“Because you won’t!” Meg exclaimed. “I
“Yeah,” Dean said, smiling. “Well, it’s kinda complicated. I am going home, like, my actual home. Lawrence. We spend Christmas with some family friends.” Dean paused, looking thoughtful. “They’re really more family than friends. Bobby and Ellen and Ellen’s kid Jo. Bobby and Ellen were both friends with my dad.”
“Oh yeah, it’s great, I can tell,” Dean said, the words dripping with sarcasm. “You’re staying at my place.”
Cas laughed. “No. A thousand-word short story,” he said.
Cas gave a single nod. “You looked at my car?”
Bobby snorted. “So you’re tellin’ me that’s not the same Cas Novak you met at WSU? The same one you brought home for Christmas? Well, that’s mighty strange, considerin’ he looks
(See the end of the chapter for
“How’s the eye?” He asked, changing the subject.
Dean was watching Cas paint that picture. An office job, coming home to some faceless girl and planning his life around the possibility of an okay-marriage and two-and-a-half kids, waking up at forty and wondering what exact point in his life had lead him down this road. It looked wildly unsatisfying from where he stood.
Dean gaped at him. “Dude, of course I want you there.”
He decided that if Dean didn’t respond in the next ten minutes, he’d call, regardless of how ridiculous he might sound.
needed him, Cas had bailed.
“I look forward to seeing him again,” Cas said. “It’s been a long time.”
He was standing in front of his recently-opened front door, Dean and Sam standing in front of him. Cas was standing behind them, the object of Bobby’s disbelief.
They talked a while longer, about Meg’s apartment and her clients, what she was doing for her birthday in January, about Cas’s graduation and his new job. They hung up with Meg forcing a promise out of him that he would visit her over the summer. Cas replaced his phone in his pocket as he approached Dean’s apartment again, the sun finally up, warming his frigid skin slightly.
Nerves pooled in the pit of his stomach. He half expected Dean to rush out some kind of apology, to tell him that everything had been a big mistake. But when Cas turned to face him, Dean was beaming.
. Dean did his best to contain a grimace.
“Thank Cas, he made everything,” Dean said, the sides of his mouth quirking up, despite this being absolutely false.
“You…” Dean’s voice was a gravelly whisper. “What?”
“I’m going to kiss you,” he said, because, naturally, he would say the most idiotic thing possible.
“I’m sure,” he said quietly. “Are you?”
?” She asked, incredulous. She stared at Dean, who only shrugged, his face burning.
He couldn’t hear if Cas said anything back, and he didn’t care anyway. He slammed the door behind him.
Dean stared at him. “The whole damn thing, Cas,” he sputtered. “And now this, and, goddammit, you’re my best friend and I can’t control myself long enough to…” Dean trailed off, and Cas finally understood. Dean had misinterpreted his shock, felt Cas’s stiff and tardy reply and taken it to mean he wasn’t interested. A bubble of hysterical laughter escaped him at the irony.
“I think you should go to bed,” Cas said, his voice thick.
Meg groaned on the other line. “Oh shit.” Something loud rustled in the phone speaker, and then Cas could hear Meg’s voice even more clearly. “Why are you
“That’s a bad idea,” Cas said, but he didn’t move to stop it, and so Dean did. He closed the distance between them, kissing Cas just once, and it was nothing like Dean had imagined it would be when he imagined kissing Cas again. It was chaste, barely a brushing of lips, and the sweetness of it shattered something inside his chest. He made to kiss Cas again, real and fervent this time, but Cas placed a firm hand on his chest.
“Hey, Jody,” he said, setting the cup down. She pulled him into a tight hug. In the past three years, Jody had become family.
“Hey,” Dean said, raising his voice. “Stephen King, what the hell?”
“Please,” Cas said with a nod. Dean moved to climb out of the bed, but he paused. He turned back toward Cas and kissed him, slow and deep. When he finally broke away, Dean was smiling even wider.
Dean gave a short laugh. “I guess it is kinda dumb. Yeah, nevermind.”
Dean finally opened his eyes, only to give Cas a death-stare. “No, dumbass, something a little nicer than the friggin’ dining hall.” He sighed. “But, of course, in my
Dean looked up at him then, and Cas was struck by the mixture of fury and sadness in his eyes. “Screw the party and screw class. Family emergency.”
this whole thing was?
“That’s what I just said, isn’t it?” Dean grumbled.
The shower was spinning. Dean turned off the head and stumbled out, having no idea how long he’d been standing there. He towelled off and haphazardly threw on a pair of underwear before collapsing into his bed.
“Hey! D’you mind?”
long,” but he was smiling and sniffling and hugging Sam just as hard. Cas hid his smile.
Cas gave him a polite smile. “It’s not a problem. I hear it’s sitting in the best mechanic shop in town.”
“Dad never really had a steady job, not after our mom died,” Dean explained. “That’s why we moved around a lot. When I was fourteen, I started working. Chickenshit stuff, mostly. Mowing lawns and detailing cars until I was old enough to start flippin’ burgers.” Dean furrowed his eyebrows. “The money was supposed to go to rent and food, but I started putting most of it aside, just in case, you know? I had enough for a year of college by the time I was a senior. I figured I could get loans and stuff for the rest.”
“Can I read it? When you’re done, I mean,” Sam said. “I love reading. I just finished
“Class
“What are you doing? Dean, talk to me,” he said. But Dean was on a mission, it seemed. After stuffing his feet into unlaced boots, he threw the door open and stalked out.
“I don’t need him,” Dean whispered.
“What question?”
Cas stretched his arms up and rested his head on top of his hands. “This?” He asked. Dean was being intentionally vague, but Cas couldn’t exist in limbo. He had to hear the words, as clear as Dean could make them.
“What happened?” Dean croaked. The man’s head shot up, and Dean’s stomach flipped.
Dean felt a memory pull at his brain. “She’s the, uh, the therapist, right?”
just wanted to say thank you to everyone who reads this, especially if you leave kudos and/or comments. that stuff always makes my day!! :')) also not to *self promote* but i do run a little blog on
Dean was standing by the door with a full backpack. Cas’s own was leaning against his closet. He was sitting at his computer, manically finishing a paragraph, only half-stalling.
Cas interrupted him. “No, Dean. I’m excited to spend Christmas with you and your family.”
“Well, lucky for you, I don’t have work for another miserable three hours, so get to talking.”
“Whatever,” Sam muttered.
“Did you guys… You know…”
“Well, it’s just…” Sam trailed off and took another sip. “We don’t really do the whole ‘apologizing after arguments’ thing.” He gave Dean a look. “No chick flick moments and all that.”
“I’m fine,” he argued, but he was leaning on the stranger for support.
you’re mad – you almost threw out his record player the other day, I was there – but you refuse to even entertain the idea that…” She trailed off.
,” Dean was saying as Neil’s father came on screen. Cas hummed in agreement, paying more attention to his fingers threading their way through Dean’s hair. Suddenly, Dean’s phone began to ring. He shifted to check the caller ID, then stood up quickly.
“No, no,” he said quickly. “Not… I dunno, I guess… I thought that writing stuff made you happy. And…”
He was quiet for a while, and Meg interrupted his thoughts gently. “I’m not saying you shouldn’t go. I didn’t know Dean Winchester like you did, and I don’t know him now. But I do know that he wrecked you with the things he said, and you weren’t really ever the same since then. Have you even written anything since then?”
He called Sam on his way home, and his brother insisted that Dean make burgers for dinner. Dean had forgotten he’d be cooking for three until Sam started talking about his second day spent with Cas. Apparently, in Dean’s absence, they had become great buddies, talking about all kinds of nerd stuff Dean didn’t bother to commit to memory.
“You learn all that stuff from your sister? The one with a degree in ‘dealing with crazy fuckers’?”
“You can’t possibly know that,” Meg said.
“Yes, I suppose so,” Cas replied.
Sam gave a little laugh. “Okay,” he said slowly.
When Bobby and Ellen moved to the kitchen to clean up, Dean led Cas outside to the Impala.
“Hey, Cas,” she answered on the first ring.
Dean returned momentarily with an already-half empty package of powdered donuts, grinning widely. Cas rolled his eyes as Dean reentered the cab.
Cas hit word count and kept going, because the story was building itself larger and larger. He didn’t even notice how long he’d been working until Dean’s six-a.m. alarm went off.
He paid for his coffee and all but ran back to his apartment. Upon reaching the parking lot, he hurriedly unlocked the Impala and slid into the driver’s seat. Dean’s movements slowed before he could turn the key in the ignition.
Something like realization dawned on Dean’s face. He let out another laugh. “Guess we’re a couple of dumbasses.”
Cas gave him a hard look. “I didn’t get the ‘shit beat out of me,’” he grumbled, punctuating the phrase with air quotes. Dean rolled his eyes.
He had
Cas turned to face him. “What?” Cas said, trying to ignore the flames creeping up his arm.
Dean sighed. He was pissed. At Sam, at Cas, at himself. Still at his dad, always at his dad. So he did what he always did when he had nowhere to direct the anger.
Dean held up a hand and almost smiled.  He almost laughed too.  Jack knew what Dean’s smile and laugh looked like.  They wanted Dean to smile at them.  Dean didn’t seem able to.  Sam rolled his eyes at Dean.
Dean felt himself give in.  The condom had really been out of habit.  Cas pulled his fingers out, leaving Dean feeling cored and empty.  Cas rolled him over.  Dean supposed this was how Cas wanted it.  Dean went pliant.  He spread his legs wide.  His ass was clenching around nothing.  He watched Cas’s brow furrow in concentration as he took his pretty cock in his hand and…  Dean’t breath caught in his chest.  Cas was just rubbing the freshly slicked up head over his ass and a couple of times. His ass was so hungry that when cas applied pressure, the muscles sucked him in.  Dean felt all of the breath leave his body.  It felt weird and good and wow Cas looked great between his thighs.  His eyes were dark.  He was breathtaking up there with all of those rippling muscles and that scent.  Dean’s breath hitched as Cas bottomed out.  Cas ran his big hands over Dean’s torso and Down to his face.  Cas shifted his weight and kissed him in a way that was both filthy and sweet.  Dean was really getting used to the feeling of Cas’s cock.  He was actually rather enjoying it.  Cas started to wonder, nibbling his neck and telling him how lovely he was, how good he felt.
“You want another finger?”
Sam was unclear on what he would find when he slipped into the bunker, but he did not expect an adult who looked old enough to drive. There was so much blood.  Sam’s stomach twisted into knots.  Jack knelt in the war room, naked and clearly, not human.  Their eyes glowed gold in the rising sun.
Cas had barely been around since then.  He had called them several times to let him in, only to drop things off in ‘his room’ before leaving again.  Dean had snooped only to find piles and piles of parenting books.  There were like a thousand in there.  It made him both want to cry and want to punch a wall.  Cas was reading books on how to take care of their child.  What even?
Castiel sat at the edge of Dean’s bed, watching him change for sleep.  Dean’s neck and ears blushed prettily as he shucked his jeans.
Castiel had been able to sense Dean outside of the door for a few minutes now.  He could smell Dean too.  Dean had had an orgasm without him.  That was irritating for some reason.  What irritated him more was that Dean just stood there.  Castiel could feel cramps rolling through his abdomen.  The muscles in his channel clenched unhappily around his fingers and his penis wept bitterly.  Dean was right there.  Dean was infuriating.
“I like the way you smell…”
“I wouldn’t be opposed to it, but…  I don’t want to make you uncomfortable…”
Jack exclaimed.  Jack was just so sweet, that Sam didn’t tell them off for talking with their mouth full.
“Betas came when humans arrived.  The archangel Raphael, the head healer, arranged it so that Angels would not present and remain sterile unless there was a shortage of angels.  This text doesn’t say how to undo it or how he did it.  I think he was trying to keep the angels under control and easy to train as warriors.”
Sam pulled away and left one hand on Cas’s shoulder.
“Shit…  Cas…?”
“I brought you some heat stuff.”
“When did you start being all communicative and shit?”
“I know how you see yourself Dean.”
Of what?  Castiel wasn’t clear on that either.
“Sam?  I’m sorry…”
“Cas, relax…”
“Go to sleep Dean…”
Sam leaned in to get a better look at his screen.
“Touch your cock Cas.  It’ll help.”
“No offence Sunshine but isn’t kind of a crazy coincidence that we just had unprotected heat sex and now there's a half angel half human that just poofed into being somewhere?”
“The omegas who died did so of a combo of dehydration, exertion, and fever.  Apparently, the fevers just kept rising until they just died.  The medical experts have differing theories on it.  Some liken it to the mates of members of the armed forces. The experts hint at it being a strain on the bond.  Some of them say the bond has failed to sever itself. There's a theory that a bond that fails to sever itself becomes inwardly destructive.  Apparently, the heat trigger is…  I don’t know…  normal? But they seem to think that it's the Omega’s body’s way of figuring out if they still have a mate or not.  The lead researcher claims that several omegas who reestablished scent bonds with their mate were healthy during and after their heat.  He observed a sample size who couldn’t reestablish a scent connection for some reason.  Most of them had higher than average fevers and became distressed, but their mating bonds broke and they were healthy afterward.”
Sam was right.  Castiel still had a gaping wound from his palm, to past his elbow.  It was leaking less grace, but the bleeding would resume soon, if they didn’t wrap this up.  A part of him resented Sam.  He had been enjoying this closeness with Dean.  He knew, for sure, that Dean’s soul loved him.  While Castiel was busy thinking, Dean let out a huffing sigh, grabbed Castiel’s face, and kissed his mouth.  It was a rough, hungry kiss.  Castiel froze in shock before melting into it.  He felt starved for Dean’s effection.  Dean deepened the kiss.  Cas allowed himself to taste each molecule.  He loved each one.  Sam infuriated him again by coughing.
“The child kicked when Dean said ‘Jack.’ Oh, they did it again.”
“Cas…  Give a guy some air, would you?”
“Yeah…”
“Shut up.”
“I don’t know.  Honestly, I am as much of a novice to this as you.”
He truly did.  He would let no one hurt Jack.  Castiel gazed down between his legs at his child.  They were the most beautiful creature in creation.  Castiel loved them so much.
“Other angels, maybe Lucifer, will feel the location of-”
“Put the pheromones inside of the… um…”
“That's what I’m getting at Dean.  Maybe, when Cas figured out that the nefilim, you guys gotta name it soon so we can stop calling it that- That it wasn’t malicious by nature.  That's when he told you it was yours.  He told you right when we got here right?”
“Sort of low and throbbing…”
“Yeah…  I’m glad you called…”
“No.”
Sam and Dean both prayed for Cas, but Cas only showed up when Dean asked. “Dean and I do share a very profound bond.
Sam pulled up the little desk chair.
Sam asked, impatient at being left out.
Cas was beating him and beating him hard.  His eyes were blank and ruthless.  Dean couldn’t see Cas in them at all.
Sam bit his lip to keep himself from laughing.
“From what I understand, wounds from bonding take time to heal.”
“So basically, we’ve been sitting here for an hour and we’ve come up with Jack.”
He smoothed his free hand up Cas’s chest, brushing his hard nipples, before caressing his neck.  He applied just enough pressure to get his point across.
Cas presented Dean with his shining hand.  Dean shifted where he sat.  His hands went to his crotch.  He inadvertently began to massage it. Dean licked his lips and swallowed thickly.  Cas raised one eyebrow.  Dean nearly tripped over himself to get up so that he could get naked.  He wanted to feel Cas’s skin, his weight, his fingers pressing up inside…  He already had his pants down around his ankles before he remembered.
“Oh.”
Sam didn’t even say “hello” when he picked up the phone.  He just started in.
“Dean, Cas could survive a normal fever, but let me pose a theory.  Say the fever keeps going up and up until something gives and even he can’t handle it anymore?”
“Dean…”
“Nephilim are super off limits.  He probably needed time to come around to the fact that yours isn’t like…  this guy.”
“Cas, you know I want you around? Like… If you're powered down and not feeling so hot, I still want you around…  You're more than a vessel Cas.  I-”
Dean scowled at him.  He also realised that he was so close to Cas that he could feel his heat.  Cas smelled like home and safety and sex.
“I need to get my clothes off.  Please go to the bed.”
Castiel felt Dean’s penis begin to fill with blood. Dean shifted in his sleep so that their hips pressed just so.  Dean let out a contented sigh and rocked his hips a little.  He pressed his sleeping nose to Cas’s scent gland and inhaled without restraint. Castiel could feel him smiling.
“What changed your mind?
Castiel blinked.  How much clearer did he need to be?
“Where is he?”
Cas made a humming sound and tugged at the hem of his underwear.  Grabby bastard.
Cas nodded right away, nibbling at Dean’s knuckles.  Dean was caught a little off guard by the tenderness with which Cas scent marked him.    It was enough to be sensual, yet his touch was feather light and achingly sweet.
“Agreed.”
“We should think about names.”
Cas is gone.   Dean deals with it by not dealing with it, forsing Sam into the role of Uncle-father to Jack.
Jack asked with a scrunched up expression on their face.  Dean finally said something.
Castiel moaned.  It was hard to say when Dean was hitting just the right spot like that.  Dean’s breath hitched and his knot popped inside. Castiel was so full of Dean.  He was so stretched.  Dean came in long hot spurts.  Castiel could finally feel it.  He could feel their bodies responding to one another.  Dean came again and again, whimpering, but refusing to look away.  Castiel guided Dean’s head down to his own neck. Dean sniffed desperately at the scent glands.
Castiel blinked.  Dean’s face was very close.  He had stopped reciting the enochian incantations.  One of Dean’s rough hands cupped Castiel’s cheek.  The other rested just behind his ear.
“You’ve known that we’re having a kid, and you didn’t tell me?”
“Can I taste you now?”
“I’m getting to that.”
“Noah?”
“Would you stop saying ‘knot’?”
Dean didn’t even understand the words coming out of Sam’s mouth.  He stared at Sam,  over the cooler of heat supplies.
“Cas?”
Jack didn’t look any less confused than before.
“Get back on the bed.  Chest on the mattress and ass in the air.”
“Sore.”
Cas’s scent spiked with pleasure.  He ‘mmm’ed again.  Dean whimpered a little.  Cas pulled his cheeks wide and thrust hard.  Dean gasped as one of Cas’s slicked up fingers joined his tongue.  Having Cas’s slick inside of his hole was wild.  It was pure chemistry.  The smell of Cas’s slick inside was oddly arousing.  His muscles loosened enough for two of Cas’s fingers.  Cas let his tongue wonder around the stretched rim, causing Dean to shiver.   It was so nice to be full.  Cas brought more of his musky slick and stretched him slowly, gently, with a third finger.  He didn’t seem to mind that he had to take his time.  In fact, Cas smelled content, as if he would be perfectly happy to fist Dean as long as he wanted.  Cas’s tongue disappeared.  Dean’s skin was cold where Cas’s breath had heated his flesh.  Dean whimpered a little, which was embarrassing.  He needn’t have worried.  Cas’s mouth was back on him, this time, on his scrotum and balls.  He kissed them and licked them wetly, like it was just the thing you do.  His scent was pleased.  Dean was so hard that it almost hurt.  The gentle swipes of Cas’s tongue, his rough stubbled cheek, his fingers sliding in and out of Dean’s well stretched ass.  It was almost too much sensation.  His knot would pop and that would be embarrassing.  Cas wasn’t even fucking him yet.  Oh god Cas was gonna fuck him…
Cas made a grumbling grunting noise.
He came crashing back to his human body.  Cas’s cum was cooling between them.  It was gross and sticky.  Cas smelled good though, like sweat and sex, and Cas.  His scent mixed with the coppery tang of his blood.  It wasn’t exactly unpleasant.  Dean pulled back, wincing as his dick slipped free of Cas.  Dean leaned over, reluctantly letting go of Cas to grab some tissues.  Cas was watching him with the smallest of smiles and half lidded eyes.
“Mate me.”
Dean was trying to focus on his words, but Cas had decided to take his cock in his hand and the washcloth.  He treated it no differently than he did the rest of Dean’s body, but his cock was over sensitive.  Dean let out a hiss through his teeth.  Cas gave the foreskin a little kiss and let go.  The touch was so sweet and non sexual.  Dean didn’t know what to do with himself.
“The bomb, The Darkness, What Happened?
Dean’s dick was weeping and he was so hard that he ached.
“They don’t have a gender presentation.  They expressed to me that they would prefer They/them pronouns unless they choose a different pronoun at a later time.”
“You been looking through my porn again man?”
“What is this?”
“How does this help Cas?”
Castiel threw his arms around Dean without hesitation.  He squeezed him, wanting to make sure that he was real.
Sam turned the page and showed Dean a passage and old time script.
Sam made his way around the table and hugged Cas.  Cas seemed happy to be held.  Sam would ask Dean if he was still cool with this stuff later.
“Call me if you have any more questions… Okay?...  I'm coming in to check on you in a bit.”
“Dean…  Dean I need…”
“No Dean!  There's something outside!”
“Yes Dean…  You are so good to me.  I have always loved how you smell...  Now rest…  Rest and let me watch over you…”
“Rest.  If I’m not in the nest when you wake up, I’m right outside the door.  You can come and get me like you did before.  I won’t be upset.”
“Jack is being born now.”
When Dean woke up, Cas wasn’t in the nest.  Dean’s whole being throbbed with the need to mate.  He needed Cas in his nest now.  Cas had promised.  Where was he? Dean smelled him nearby.  Then he smelled the other alpha.  Cas was talking to Sam on the other side of the door.  Cas shouldn’t be talking to any other alphas.  Dean didn’t care who it was.  Cas needed to get back in the nest right now.  Dean wrenched the door open and growled at Sam.  Sam held up his hands.  Dean didn’t care. He took Cas by the arm and yanked him inside.  Cas kept saying something.
Cas still wore that intent expression on his face as he stared off into the distance. “Hey,” Dean said, elbowing him in the arm. “You creating world peace over there or something?”
“Hello?” He said cautiously. No answer. Cas scanned the room, but nothing looked any more out of place than it always was. He frowned again. Maybe he was misremembering his morning. That was mildly concerning.
“Lovely,” Cas grumbled.
The room was spinning even worse, now. Dean blinked twice. “Fine,” he said, aiming for disaffected and missing it by about a mile. He pushed himself off the ground, swaying a little as he stood.  “Merry fucking Christmas, Castiel,” he said bitterly as he made his way to Bobby’s second spare room.
“I was in the area,” he said, aiming for blasé. Cas sipped his coffee. Dean leaned back in his chair and asked, “So, were you gonna tell me you got mugged?”
“I know,” Cas replied quietly. “I… I wish things had gone differently.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “That’s the bad news. You’re stuck here for at least another week. Sorry, man, it’s just… Christmas, and all that.”
Try not to call Dean.
Dean only nodded, now staring intently at the ground. Cas didn’t say anything more, knowing Dean had probably just unloaded more trauma than he’d even known he had. Finally, though, Dean’s gaze met his.
Dean gave him a look for a moment, but relented. “Yeah, I know. Okay. This,” he said, gesturing between the two of them. “You and me.
“What’s it about?” Dean asked.
-Sameer Gadhia
“Grab the turkey out of the oven,” she said. “Needs bastin’.”
Dean, too, chose his words carefully. “I could say the same about you,” he said. “Unless there’s some guy waiting for you in KC,” he added, realizing he couldn’t possibly know otherwise. “Which, if there is, he’s kind of a dick for not —”
“Yes.”
“I was gonna bring her around,” Sam said.
“If you say so.”
“All better,” Dean said. “Doc took the stitches out today.”
Another small smile, like it had almost been contained. “Apparently,” Cas said.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said. “The usual thing. It’s always a good time.”
“But I
And Cas did know. There were a million little complications, things they would have to figure out, problems he hadn’t even begun to consider. That might have been terrifying, but the prospect of never having Dean, that was worse.
Meg stared at him. “What?”
Dean snorted. He knew Cas was trying to make some bigger point, but he wasn’t willing to follow him there. “I dunno,” he said. “Pretty much everything I love is always awesome.”
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, I mean, it’s kinda weird,” he said. “I never expected… Well, that’s why I hit my head, anyway.”
Cas knew Dean well enough by now to know there were things he was trying to say without saying them. His heart broke to know that
Cas frowned but didn’t reply, just took another mediocre bite. He’d been a wreck for the last fourteen days, and if Meg hadn’t taken to bringing him lunch between classes, he’d have forgotten to eat on more than one occasion. Cas’s days looked a little like this:
Dean watched Cas nod. There was a different song playing now, but he had no idea what it was. Cas poured himself another glass of eggnog before sitting gingerly on the couch.
“Wake up, dumbass,” he heard Dean say affectionately. Cas didn’t want this dream to end; he could steal a few more minutes of sleep. He burrowed his head deeper into the pillow, willing the dream to continue.
Cas, not induct him into the family.”
remember, what he always remembered, was Cas. Cas waiting for him to return from whatever dorm party he had found, Cas forcing him to drink water, Cas taking his vomit-stained clothes to the laundromat. Cas bandaging his hand after he punched the brick wall of their dorm room one too many times. Cas holding him as he cried.
“Dean,” Cas grumbled, and he sounded like shit, too. “What are you doing here?”
Cas gave a short nod and made his way over to the dumpster. He leaned against it, next to Dean, shoving his hands deep in the pockets of his coat. Dean gave him a sidelong glance, but Cas was looking straight ahead, deep in thought.
“Dean told me you’re a writer,” Sam said when it was just the three of them. “He said you were writing a book.”
“I kept the entirety of my college application process a secret. Only Anna knew,” Cas said. “She’s the only other sane person in my family. I made the mistake of informing the rest of them about it at dinner sometime in July.” He gave Dean a wry smile as they entered their room. “None of them were particularly thrilled.”
“You make it sound like it’s disappointing that that isn’t the case,” Cas said, and, though he was giving Dean a smirk, his eyes looked sad. Dean felt a pang in his chest at having caused unintentional pain.
“I’m gonna go grab a snack,” he said. “You want anything?”
“Yeah,” Dean replied in a small voice. “I guess so.”
“We did, but… God, I can’t remember it.” She eyed him suspiciously. “Why?”
Cas sighed as Dean traced circles on his chest. “It’s worth it to try.”
“Occasionally,” Cas said. “My father called yesterday to ask your same question. I suspect he suddenly feels quite guilty about his treatment of me, considering accountants make quite a bit more than small-town preachers.”
Meg groaned. “I can’t believe you count the number of rings before he fucking ignores you.”
“I gotta go, Cas. I’ll explain everything later.” The first words Dean had spoken to Cas in nearly ten minutes. His voice was thick.
Two sets of feet appeared on his right side, which only served to further irritate Dean. He hated having an audience.
“You’re not,” the stranger said with a long-suffering sigh.
Dean winced a little. “Yeah.”
“Ready to go?”
“It’s fine,” Cas said.
“You’re being a fucking idiot,” Dean said, exasperated.
Cas was in between sleep and consciousness when something warm shifted around his back. Whatever dream he’d been having, it felt remarkably real.
“What?” He asked, a little too loudly.
Bobby greeted them with the biggest smile Dean had ever seen him wear. He pulled Sam into a tearful hug and clapped Dean on the shoulder. The three made their way to the kitchen.
“Trust me,” Cas said with a sad smile. “It’s better this way.”
“About what?”
And, yeah, this was embarrassing, but Dean couldn’t exactly stop now. He rubbed the back of his neck. “When I heard you talking to Bobby,” he explained, “I just kinda… Well, I was pretty friggin’ shocked to hear
“Mornin’,” he said.
He hadn’t even told Bobby he was coming, but he was waiting for Dean anyway. He found out that John had had one too many at the bar that night, but insisted on driving home, anyway. He ran into a tree going sixty, died on impact. Sam had been spending the night with a friend. Bobby drove him down to Amarillo, where John had been working one of his odd-jobs that was sure to dead-end when he started leaving beer bottles on site. Dean didn’t speak the whole way there, not until they picked Sammy up. Sam was crying. Dean wished he could cry, too. He felt like he was going to fracture into a million pieces. But he’d felt that before. Not this bad, never this bad, but broken all the same. He did what he always did. He hugged Sammy tight and told him it was going to be okay, everything is going to be okay.
Jody gave him a look. “No, nothing ‘interesting.’ Although we did have a mugging.”
“What a pleasant change in demeanor,” Cas deadpanned.
Dean nodded once and took another sip of coffee. “You want breakfast?”
Dean scowled. “At least tell me what you’re calling it.”
“Cas,” Dean said. Cas had just let them into the room, but Dean was standing resolutely in the hallway.
It was by impulse, really, that he picked up a copy of
“Sam,” Dean warned. “Stop talking. I mean it.”
They were supposed to leave Lawrence on New Year’s Day, but Dean and Cas were both too hungover to even think about making the trip. They stayed an extra night, much to the delight of Sam. The three of them spent New Year’s marathoning the
“What else am I supposed to say?” Dean demanded.
“Who’s here?” Ellen called from the kitchen. Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Dean didn’t even look at him, just muttered something incomprehensible in affirmation.
Dean studied him for a moment, flipping between anger and concern. Cas had texted him after the incident, hadn’t bothered to mention it. “You okay?” He said finally, deciding it was too early to get mad.
“Dean…” His voice was damn-near pleading. Dean squeezed his eyes shut, willing his mind back to languid blankness.
“There’s no story,” Dean said forcefully. “I just felt bad for him. It’s my fault he’s stuck here, anyway.”
Cas watched helplessly as Dean sped out of the parking lot, taking the turn so fast the back end of the Impala swayed a little. He stood in the middle of the parking lot for what felt like an eternity, the cold January air seeping into his bones. Eventually, he made his way back to the dorms, sighing in relief as the warm air of the hallway hit him.
“Do you think we need to go all the way for the magic to work? Or will a little frotting be enough?”
Cas broke their long silence.
Castiel crowded right into Dean’s space.  His full bodied, pregnant scent caused Dean to blink in quick succession.
“You already hurt me!”
“Dean.”
“Not Damien.”
Castiel looked down.  Blood ran steadily from Castiel’s ruined pelvis, dripping down his thighs, running down his calves.  Too bad his grace was too fractured to do anything about the stain.
“Sammy, hey!”
He pressed his own, weakening grace to the creature’s grace.  It wound itself around his own and squeezed like a snake.  It felt kind of good.
Castiel knew it was meant as a joke, but he didn’t laugh.
Castiel undulated his hips to see how that would feel.  Yes…  That was…
Cas raised  his head so that he could look at Dean.  His eyes were so shiny and wet.  They swam, as if Cas may cry.
“Frustrated.”
Cas said nothing.
“No.  The mating bite only worked once.”
Dean looked put out as he pulled back.
“So is everything we have ever dealt with.”
“Wait, wait, wait, wait.”
Dean sat on the cold stone next to Cas.  He felt like he had swallowed a rock.
Dean chided.  His voice had dropped an octave and there was a satisfying grit to it.
“You like it?”
Castiel was chugging yet another water when the door cracked open and he smelled Dean.  He swallowed the water in his mouth and whined loudly. His hole was aching from his frustrated atentions and his whole body hurt.  He was thirsty, which was different for him. All he wanted was Dean.  He wanted to smell Dean and hold Dean and touch Dean.  He wanted to let Dean do things to him.  He wanted to know what Dean tasted like.  Dean slid sideways into the room and shut the room.  He sat down next to Cas, offering him a sandwich.  Castiel took it and wolfed it down, ignoring the awkward shape of the molecules.  His body appeared to want food.  He heard Dean chuckle, a sound that made him happy.
Dean could practically smell Cas’s contentment through the phone.
“I don’t like it.”
“Cas?”
“Oh…”
“You can do it Cas…  You're doing so good…  Fuck yourself with that knot until it feels like it isnt enough, then squeeze the bump three times.  That knot will pop and when it is inside of you, you will be so full…  It’ll feel good to be full won’t it?”
‘I’m dying.  I’m sorry’
This was exactly why.
“Sorry…  I was scared and selfish… I won’t make you wait any more…”
Sam had a million tabs open about Nephilim.  Dean had just finished telling him about the very real existence of his nephew.  Sam was eager to learn more.
“Too close to my father’s name.”
Dean looked pointedly at their intertwined fingers.
Cas rested his head against Dean’s thigh and scrubbed his balls with the washcloth.  He treated them with the same gentle kindness as he did with the rest of Dean’s body.
“You in there man?  You aren’t gonna pass out are you?”
Then Dean shuffled off to set the kitchen table.
Cas blinked and looked back to Sam and Dean.
“What?”
“That's not right.”
Castiel pulled himself back onto the bed and did as he was told.  He was so surprised and thankful that he didn’t ask any questions.  His blue eyes were wide and shiny as he peered over his shoulder at Dean.  Dean’s scent was helping him feel lucid, centered even.  He flinched in Surprise when Dean’s hand grazed his tender hole.
Dean shook his head and stretched the back of his neck.
“Hurry it up.  I’m almost asleep.”
“What?”
“Want to bend me over and fuck my hole don’t you Cas?  Want to get me on my knees sucking your cock?  Maybe you'll let me eat you out first?  What d’ya think Cas? Want you to…  Please say you’ll let me…”
“Dean?”
Dean asked him in his infuriatingly lovable way, what they could do.  Once you get back. I’ll explain.
“How old do you think you are?”
Dean had so many questions.  There was so much he should say, but talking ruined everything.
“Angels don’t think of watching and privacy in the same way that you do Dean.  The angelic part of them is always clued in on what I am doing. They are one with me.  However, I have learned that humans tend to like their privacy from their offspring during carnal activities.  I have informed them that this is our alone time and that it would be impolite of them to spy.  I have also wrapped them in my grace so that they do not feel isolated.”
Castiel saw a blush creep across Dean’t cheeks. He raised an eyebrow.
Dean’s Jaw was set, but his eyes were wide and naked.  Castiel nodded.
“I’ll give you some of Dean’s cereal..  Is that ok with you Dean?”
“I will tell them that it isn’t a good habit.  Humans don’t appreciate it. Fair?”
It was very difficult to concentrate on words when he was aching inside.  He also had an erection that was impossible to ignore.  It was straining against his trousers, intent on capturing his attention.
“Fair.”
“That doesn’t explain the sudden heat.  I can’t find anything on that.  But this is what I can find. Studies show that Omegas can survive heats alone.  In fact, some omegas do just as well without a partner than they do with one. But, I have read several articles about mated omegas whose partner had died.  In their cases, they either succumbed to the fever, or had to go to the hospital for emergency heat suppressants.”
