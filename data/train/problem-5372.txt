"Ah, the famed American," Lady Frigga said, beaming.  "Come sit, both of you.  Wallis, can you please ring for tea?"  She handed the maid the bouquet as well.
Steven’s shoulders slumped.  “Myself,” he whispered.  “My family, they already have to listen to people gossiping about my scholarly bent, saying that my parents indulged me beyond all reason.  If our circle were to find out that I had other unnatural proclivities...”
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady:  “Okay.  May?  I need you to calm down.  Tony, she is upset; she didn’t mean to besmirch your reputation.  Peter?  Eat your ice cream.  I hear the cookie dough is especially good at repressing trauma.” {medical note:  trauma} {treatment: iced milk/cream dessert} {application: internal}
“I’m quite finished,” Steven said.  “We weren’t quite sure what would be served, so Bucky and I ate at our rooms before we joined you.”
The room spun around him, and he fell to his knees.  He had never noticed the odd taste of the hookah pipe, and never realized that he was just a loose end that needed tying up.
The door opened again, and Lady Sif returned, followed by three men bearing trays of tea and cakes. They set them upon the desks, and turned to Thor.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “That depends.  What is your position on threatening your boss?  Bribery?”
“How could you?” she hissed.  “Did you and Fury cook this little plot up?”  She stood back, clenching her hands into fists.
"Perhaps they have," Steven said.  "My understanding is that they will have many ancient technological wonders."
“He would have come to find us,” Steven said, unable to catch his breath.  Tony.  With his clever hands and bright grin.  Tony, who he had judged.  Who he had looked down upon.  Tony.
“It will not be easy,” Hogun warned. “They are settled some distance from the other ships, with little cover around them. A small group, though, maybe.”
"My face!" Steve managed to get out, pointing wildly at the laptop. "My face is on someone’s crotch."
Phil had more important things than being T’Challa and Captain Rogers’ errand boy.  But he was also blessed with the ability of multitasking and killing whole flocks of birds with one stone.  So here he sat, waiting at Tony’s back door, with a message and a delivery.  He wasn’t sure how well the delivery would be received, but he had hope.
But while he did agree that the Accords were dangerous, he was not best pleased with how his idol had handled things.  When trying to convince the world that you didn’t need oversight to keep you from running off half-cocked and making things worse, perhaps you should, for example, not run off half-cocked and make things worse.  While he could appreciate Captain Rogers’ sense of loyalty to his oldest friend, he had played directly into Thunderbolt Ross’ hands.  The fact that Stark, Rhodes, Romanov, and Vision had signed the document and stood up against their former teammates was probably the only reason that anyone in power still gave any credence to the thought that enhanced individuals shouldn’t all be locked up.
“Should the delegates wish to amend the Accords to reflect a more moderate approach, we would all be happy to revisit them in the future.  But as they stand, with the current methods of enforcement which were not explained in detail at the time of signing, they are untenable.”
Steve cursed to himself. He too stood and made his way to the stairs. “Tony, wait,” he said. He reached out to grab Tony’s arm, but the other man shook him off.
“And so we are here to find these villains,” Thor finished. “Not only to find Loki, but because we believe they have nefarious purpose.”
“I can do better than that,” Steven said. He took his sketchbook from his coat. He had made a rough drawing of the ship that morning, trying to capture as much detail as possible. He tore the page from his book and handed it to Hogun.
Wanda wasn’t saying much.  As the person with the worst PR aside from the Winter Soldier, they had offered to leave her behind in Wakanda.
“You don’t understand,” Steve said.  “It’s not that I think he won’t.  It’s that I know he will.  He’ll do it, and it will eat him up inside.  He’s different now, but he seems to be healing.  Bringing this back, it’ll reopen all of those scars and make him bleed out again.  I can’t ask him to do that.”
“If only I could draw,” Loki said.  “Steven, I don’t suppose you would do one for me?  You are a much better hand with a pencil.”
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady:  “Of course you are, Tony.  You’re a pretty, pretty princess.  What’s all the drama?”
In a desperate bid to see Steven settle down and marry, Sarah Rogers gifted her son with the opportunity to see the things he most desired.  He was free to travel to London, and then on to the Continent, studying and reading every scrap of knowledge he could find along the way.  He could do this for six months, and then he had to return home and take up a position in the business.  She hoped that he could appease his curiosity once and for all, and finally give up on his dreams of being an artist and adventurer.
Thor gave the driver a set of directions that took them into the city to Right Bank, near the Les Halles market. Philip explained that the red light district was well-regulated in Paris, and most establishments were within a defined neighborhood. They stopped in front of an establishment with a small sign out front that read ‘Le Monde Arborescence’. A tall, striking woman opened the door and threw her arms around Thor.
“Now, from what I’ve been able to decipher from the documentation, Hydra’s neuroscientists originally tried manipulating Mr. Barnes’ hippocampus using a combination of external stimuli and drugs, starting off in a lucid state and then applying pain stimuli in concert with injections.”
<Friday:  Sensors Active:  Stark Manor>>Kitchen> <occupants:  Stark, T.; Parker, M.; Parker, P.; Barton, L.>  “Boss Lady, there is an opening on Mr. Stark’s executive staff.  Mrs. Arbogast has left to join Ms. Potts.  The post of personal assistant is open.”
Three weeks later, when Tony arrived in his bedroom to find Steve dressed in nothing but a smile and a pair of red crotchless panties with Tony’s face on them, he decided to give Steve full access to Etsy. He would need to replace them once Tony was done with him.
“Bucky will be fine.  And he is much safer unconscious, where his mouth cannot get him into more trouble,” Tony said, a wry smile on his lips.
"Marvelous!" Loki said, with a huge grin.  "As am I.  Thor here is not much of a scholar, but I do not hold that against him.  Are you planning to attend Doctor Ludlow's lecture on the Roman ruins he discovered in Cornwall?"
"Because let me tell you, nothing would inspire me when I was kneeling down in front of a guy like seeing your face in front of me," Tony said, suddenly feeling a little reckless.
Vision wanted to enter the chamber.  There were questions he wanted to ask.  But he should not be here, and he would not give anyone ammunition against Mr. Stark.  So he sat.  And watched.  And looked for anything that would give him insight into just what Captain Rogers hoped to get out of this play.
.  On the next morning, he packed up some of his small devices and more obscure tools, keeping anything that he might need in case of a problem with The Great Oracle.
“It is named after the fifty daughters of Danaus,” Volstagg explained.  “All instructed by their father to kill their husbands on their wedding night.  Most of these ladies aren’t dangerous, but there are a few who trade in secrets more than flesh.”
“I have long ceased trying to explain Bucky,” Steven said.  “I’ve found that to be the safest option.”
Parker, M>Designation-Guest:  “I will eventually be able to go home, right?  I need for people to take me seriously, not call me a bimbo.”
“And Steven, you can rest easier.  The children overheard one of them mention ‘Stark’ as they moved the prisoners,” Hogun said, kindly.  Steven felt the air make its way back into his lungs as he nearly collapsed next to Bucky on a sofa.
“I don’t know, Tones.  He runs away rather than taking any sort of accountability,” Rhodey said with a frown.  “Running away isn’t the answer.”
Loki started at one side of the door, and began to slowly make his way around the perimeter of the room.  Steven paused just inside the door to get his bearings, and see if there was anything beyond stone tablets and scrolls to pique his interest.  Soon enough, he found that there was.
"I think that would probably be for the best," Steve said, moving towards Tony. He gently took Tony’s face into his hands and pulled him close.
The man sat in a hookah-born cloud, taking in the sights and sounds around him while listening to other patrons chatter.  They talked about their wives, their concubines, and their business, lies and half-truths floating through the air like so much smoke.  They were all but oblivious to the stranger among them.  The man paid only a little mind, either; he was there to talk to one man, and one alone.
He took a gulp from his water bottle and tried not to think about the person who would probably be the most helpful in their situation.  He’d seen the video from Tony’s presentation at MIT.  His technology was probably the only thing that could help Bucky, but thanks to Steve, there was a snowball’s chance in Hell that Tony would help.
Steve thought he might cry.  “He never did come up with a better name for it,” he said, resting his head on the table.  “If that’s our only option, then there’s nothing we can do.”
“What?” T’Challa roared.  The two women in the circle paused at his outburst.  T’Challa stalked away, leaving his sister to follow.  “Why was I not informed?”
Tony had listened with a growing sense of disbelief at the the fairy tales woven by Ross and his compatriots.  He’d had a feeling it would go down like this even before entering the chambers--it was hard to get to the truth when over half of the major players weren’t interviewed.
"My father doesn't quite understand my love of history," Loki confided.  "He's in industry, you know.  With the rising cost of ice harvesting, he's developing better methods of refrigeration.  He's made a fortune."
Steve grimaced as another heavy bag exploded in front of him.  He’d gotten used to the reinforced bags that Tony had given him, which stood up to his favorite method of stress relief.  While the bags in T’Challa’s gym were good, they weren’t Tony’s.
Their discussion had reached a volume that other people in the room took notice.  Most especially, Tony and his friend turned around.  For one brief moment, Tony smiled in delight, but when he saw Steven’s countenance, his expression shut down and he leaned over to say something to his companion.
“I have no idea,” Tony said, giving a chuckle at odds with the grim set of his face. “He sold off my machines, but I don’t know if he even told the buyers who built them. As far as I know, they believed that Stane created them himself.”
“Secondly, I have information to present about the involvement of the certain parties in the current situation.”
"He is too kind," Steven said, trying to will away the blush he was certain covered his cheeks.  "Where is he?"
Steven thought about that for a moment.  He was able to pursue his interests because his family’s money allowed that.  He wondered what he would do if there wasn’t money for books and trips around Europe?  Would he do what he had to in order to help his family?  Even if it meant bastardizing his dreams?
He spent the rest of his time divided between working on the large machine and conferring with Mr. Banner.  The young scholar had managed to get a list of objects in the exhibition, and the two men pored over it to make sure that they did not miss any items of interest.  When Mr. Banner needed to return to his studies, Tony devoted himself to making sure the machine was in top condition.  While he did not wish to remain a slave to Obadiah, he did not particularly wish them ill, and he wanted to do as much as possible to ensure at least Pepper's wellbeing.
“So we’re letting Bruce into the clubhouse?” Rhodey asked.  “Are you sure about that?  He might not have taken up arms, but do you really think he would have been on our side?”
"Yesterday?" Tony said.  "Truthfully, I would stay to finish out the London run of the show, and then I will be ready to leave.  They should be able to fill their coffers enough to make it through the foreseeable future, as long as Obadiah keeps Zeke from gambling it all away."
He had left Steve innocently surfing thinkgeek.com, trying to find a birthday present for Bruce amongst the assorted t-shirts and gizmos. Tony had been leaning towards matching xkcd tees for both he and Bruce, a sort of Science Bros bonding thing. He tried to remember if the site had any sort of scandalous items, but he couldn’t for the love of Tesla think of any.
Steve looked up at her in horror. He managed to both curl in on himself and scoot closer to Tony. Tony gave Darcy a wink and a 'I know, right?' look.
Angela R. had worked at a coffee shop near the Triskelion in D.C.  When a piece of one of the helicarriers had crashed into her workplace, she and two others had been trapped for six hours before they were rescued.  She said she was really lucky she was young enough to still be on her parents’ insurance, so she was able to afford the help she needed to deal with the PTSD she was suffering.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man:  “You should be so lucky!  I am a catch, I’ll have you know.”{dictionary: catch} {context: sexual partner} {meaning: desirable}
Philip would not let the matter go.  "Is this why you have not offered for any of the young women back home?" he asked.  "There are several who have been throwing themselves at you for the past two years.  Good girls, from good families."
I can honestly say that I’ve never been more proud of anyone than I am of you right now.  Big Green is jumping for joy.  He says to tell you ‘Tin Man is Hulk’s favorite.’  If you have any specific requests for souvenirs from Asia, now is the time to tell me.  Hulk and I are craving schwarma.
Shuri’s lips curved into a feral grin.  “I would not say not to making an example out of her,” she said.  “But it is, unfortunately, impossible.”
Clint had checked his email with a zealous regularity since receiving they had arrived.  He knew that he couldn’t risk contacting Laura, but that didn’t mean he hadn’t kept an eye on them.  The kids never knew it, but Clint’s brother Barney lived in town.  He’d left the FBI and wanted to settle down, and at Clint’s request had bought a butcher’s shop in the town where Clint and Laura lived.  He kept his distance, not wanting to draw any attention to the little family, but he kept an eye out when Clint was off working.
Steven wouldn't have used the word 'lovely' to describe her.  Formidable.  Frightening.  Fierce.  But not lovely.
“Sure thing, my gal.  Secondly, as far as we know, there are no more Winter Soldiers flitting about to frame,” Tony said, looking at the delegate from Sweden, who waved uncomfortably.  Tony thought she looked familiar, but then he’d always liked tall blondes.
“When my parents died, Stane took me in. My father provided for it in his will,” Tony explained. “I wanted to stay at home and continue on with his work, but none of his investors believed I was capable, so the business fell apart.” Tony seemed to curl in on himself. “Stane gave me a roof over my head. I believed that paying him back with engineering was only fair. To be honest, I was hoping that the machines I designed for him would catch the attention of other investors.”
"Thor and I prefer the company here to the undereducated and overly-pampered gentry that one finds in the more respectable establishments," Loki explained.
"How about this?  Thor and I will finish this section of the exhibits, and we'll stop by and pick you up once you've completed your sketch?" Loki said.  "Now, I really won't hear any excuses.  You are just too intriguing to let get away."  He rubbed his hands together in glee.
“Okay,” Rhodey said, nodding.  “I guess I can understand that.  “Why is he coming back, though?  New York is still full of a lot of innocent civilians.”
They had spent the last few days listening as the fact finding panel had made their report on the incident, let by Everett Ross.  Tony had checked, no relation to the Secretary of State, so he probably was just useless, not evil.
“I will accompany you as well,” T’Challa said.  “I don’t know that I will be of help, but I have other business to attend to at the U.N.”
window.  “Jarvis is an old friend of my father’s.  He is well-traveled and familiar with the Continent.  And how?  Well, I’ll show you when we get there.”
Wallis broke up the uncomfortable silence by returning with tea.  She placed it in front of Lady Frigga, who poured out for all of her guests.  Steven took the delicate cup into his large hands, and was reminded of playing tea with one of his cousins and her child-sized tea set.  Loki handed him a cake and they concentrated on the excellent pastry as opposed to the rude guests.
“The man in the lion mask has taken him,” Steven said, kneeling down to look at the wound.  Thor reluctantly allowed Steven to remove his jacket.  Steven peeled back the shirt and sighed with a little relief.
“Basically, coming out of cryo-stasis, the brain functions like a computer reboot.  It’s physically resetting and having to bring every system back online,” Samson explained.  “That’s why you have to reboot a computer whenever you add new programs or make operating system updates; the reboot goes back and looks at the code and adjusts its operation based on whatever is stored in its operation code.”
"It seems to be a residential ruin, with some intact mosaics and frescoes," Loki said, his eyes glinting with anticipation.  "We shall see," Loki said, shrugging.  "Are you available on Tuesday next?"
“As far as I know, Cooper, Lila, and young Nathaniel currently have the run of a mansion and a red and green AI for a best friend.  And Laura is bossing Stark around like she was born to it.”
Tony’s shoulders went rigid. “I’m aware of what you thought of the purposes of my machine,” he said. “And what you think of me. It would be best to leave it be until we find your friend.” He pulled away from the wall and went to climb up towards the cockpit.
Steven looked up and smiled.  "Because it's easier to discern the road in front of you if you have some idea of the road behind," he said.  "The Greeks, the Romans, and the Egyptians were all great scientific civilizations in their time.  Who knows what knowledge has been lost over the years?  We don't build things like the Great Pyramid these days.  I don't know if we could.  But maybe, by studying the original builders, we can figure it out."
“I invited you all to Wakanda,” T’Challa said.  “I had my own atonement to worry about.  I do not regret protecting you.  I just wish I could have kept you in one place.”  He allowed his frustration to leak onto his face.
“This is madness,” T’Challa said.  “The minute that the United Nations gets even a hint that we have been harboring them, we will be considered a rogue nation.”  Shuri still didn’t blink.
“I’m fairly certain that will be the case,” Steve said.  “Either way, I want to do this because it’s right.  He was right.  It’s all I can give him, now.”  There were tears in his eyes.
T’Challa sat in the roof garden of the Wakandan embassy, trying to calm the rage inside of him.  Shuri had called earlier with a report on her investigations.  She and her security teams had narrowed down the dates of the pictures, based on comparison to archive security footage.  It was during the window of time after he had returned with Dr. Banner’s suggestion of Leonard Samson, and before the good doctor had arrived.
"I kind of had a plan for the next time," Steve said and shuffled his foot on the ground. The elevator stopped at the Penthouse and they walked out, still holding hands.
Peter nodded, then looked down at his hands in his lap and Steve raised an eyebrow. “Uh, Mr Steve? You love my Daddy, right? Don’t plan on moving out or leaving?”
"I have the robots, and Jarvis," Tony said, hand rubbing Peter's back. He took a breath, pressing his lips together for a second. "I'm glad you came though," he said quietly.
"Wasn't spying," Sam stated. He pointed to a door that was between them. "I came to use the bathroom. Not my fault that you thought the hallway was the best place to have a touching moment with your billionaire boyfriend."
“Only if you add too much salt, to something that doesn’t need it.” He leaned to kiss Tony before they both sat down at the island bar.
“Technically, she didn’t finish his name,” Steve threw in and Tony shot him a look. “I’m going with it doesn’t count.” Tony narrowed his eyes at him a little, nose scrunching a little.
“Shush you.” Tony reached out to scratche Steve’s bearded jaw. “I wanna get the mileage out of this beard before it goes away.”
"No," Steve shook his head, and Tony looked over at him. "We've got eyes on him, and he's leaving the state now. He was packing up, most likely cleaning out before anything could be traced back to him. He hadn't known that the man he had hired had been caught, or well, at least that his stuff have been found. But, I have it on good authority that he has enough incentive to not try this again." Tony could read between the lines; The Winter Soldier.
"I haven't spent time with Peter in a little bit, should be fun." Mary smiled at her boyfriend, leaning over to kiss him quickly.
"Is tea how you keep the big guy down?" Tony smirked when Bruce looked over at him. "I always thought it was a big bag of weed."
"Stark," Coulson said softly, coming up beside Tony. He knew it, Coulson never called him Stark like that unless it was serious.
"Put me through, Jarvis," Mary said softly. Steve watched her, wondering how often she had actually had to deal with this problem. "Tony?" She asked once there the sound of something else, sounding like drawers opening and closing. There was a grunt of surprise. "Hey, Tony, you there?"
When one of the monitors of Tony's computer screens flipped to the screen saver, he was able to catch a look at the time. It was after four in the morning. Tony glanced back over at Steve. "What has you up this early?" He knew for a fact that Steve didn't get up for his morning run until five-thirty.
Tony froze, gasping when a sharp pain lanced through his shoulder. He brought up a hand to press to the spot, then pulled it back to see it was wet with blood. There was a intake of breath and he looked at Rachel and his eyes widened. There was a scream on the sidewalk and Tony was lunging forward to catch Rachel as she started to fall back. He could see the shaft of what looked like a small arrow protruding from her chest.
"He knew what he was getting into when he agreed to this," Meg protested. "He looked up the reviews."
As Peter finished his breakfast, he turned and let out a little gasp. Tony set the boy down on the ground as he shouted his excitement. "Granpa! Granma!" Peter ran over and William caught him, picking him up, making an exaggerated 'oomph.'
“Okay, in my defense, I only know where he is because I’ve been tracking him with Jarvis,” Tony said, raising his finger up for a second. “Cap and I have come to, an understanding. We aren’t at each other’s throats, and actually, maybe, kind of, sorta, get along now.” He wiggled when Mary nudged his side with her elbow.
"I had kind of figured when Jarvis asked me to bring Jamie with me." Steve rubbed Tony's back as he managed to stand up straight again. "We didn't exactly plan this moment out, did we?" Tony shook his head, looking at Steve with an undercurrent of panic.
“He’s ten years old,” Tony nearly whispered. “It’s bad enough that his dad had to be the face of abuse when he was a kid, but, to have to go through that.” He shook his head a little. “It’s going to stick with him, forever.”
Clint, of all of them, shouldn’t have fallen for it, he supposed.  He could be as much of a dick as Tony, if not more.  But he’d been so scared about how the Accords could be abused that he hadn’t trusted Tony.  In the field, he trusted Iron Man with his life.  Why didn’t he trust the man behind the armor to be as smart as Clint knew he was?
Steven and Bucky wore what passed as evening dress back in New York, but Steven felt dowdier than the servants.  Loki and Thor assured him that no one would think anything of it, but he caught the sidelong glances from several of the women in attendance.
“No, Phil.  I think I deserve to have my say in this,” Tony said.  “All I ever tried to do was keep us together and keep us safe.  Did I fuck up?  Yes.  And so did everyone else.  But why were my fuck-ups always chalked down to me being a megalomaniacal bastard?  Why couldn’t they just be mistakes?  No, anything I did that you people didn’t agree with had to be because I’m a power-hungry asshole.  Everything I did was just a step down the slippery slope to me being a villain.  Well you know what?  Fuck that!”
As before, it was Vision that answered the door.  He took one look at the delivery and closed it in Phil’s face.  Phil sighed, and knocked again.  This time, Vision didn’t open the door, he merely phased through it, making it obvious that he was not going to let them in.
Once he left that thread, however, he soon discovered a section that he probably should have guessed was there.
Phil had even money on her throwing a punch at Clint.  Instead, she turned, walked over to the bar to grab Nate, and walked out of the kitchen.  Cooper gave one last disgusted look at his father and followed.
"I am interested in all things mechanical," Tony said.  "I'm not much for appreciating art, or old bones, but I am deeply jealous of their technical breakthroughs."
Lila was the first to notice them.  She saw Vision first, and grinned at him.  Then her smile dimmed into confusion when she saw Phil.  When Clint stepped out from behind them, her eyes grew wet with tears.
“What Hydra found is that the functional state of a serum-enhanced brain, coming out of stasis, is, very particularly unique.  And that uniqueness allowed them to make some very specific changes to Mr. Barnes.”
“I will not be left behind,” Thor roared.  “I will not let Loki suffer one more minute in captivity.”  He stormed from the room, slamming the door behind him.
Really, Coulson blamed Fury.  If the man had been upfront about the whole T.A.H.I.T.I. mess, he could have taken his place as the Avengers handler, and so much of this could have been avoided.  At least he thought it might have.  As much as he tried to be unbiased, he might have potentially, perhaps, sided just a little tiny bit more with Cap.  But to be fair, he hadn’t grown up with Iron Man pajamas.
Cooper was more wary.  He scowled at his father, and then glanced over at Laura.  She and the other woman had turned around at Lila’s words, and they silently watched.  The other woman scowled, and had a protective arm around Laura’s shoulders.  Laura’s face was completely and utterly neutral.  No hint of emotion at all.
“I learned, years ago in a cave in Afghanistan, that we must all be accountable for our actions.  Mistakes happen, most assuredly, but many times they happen because we are not vigilant, or we enter a situation without the necessary information.  I will admit that the Accords were such a mistake for me.”
“Very well.  But please note, Mr. Barton, that the minute you make an aggressive move towards anyone in this home, I will deal with you accordingly.  And since Ms. Maximoff isn’t here to save you…”
Finally, they were saved by Mr. Borson and Thor, who joined them in time to take the last two tea cakes.
Loki and Thor looked over at the older man.  "Of course!  The more the merrier," Loki assured.  "So you get back to sketching, and we won't be long."  He gave Steven a merry wave and dragged his friend off to the next gallery.
Steve choked on what seemed to be hysterical laughter. The kind you get before they come with the straight jacket. Clint gave Tony a wink and a thumb's up.
They ended up in what looked like a war room, once they had convinced Lila to go be with her mother for a little while.  The other woman, who had introduced herself as May Parker, Tony’s assistant, brought in a pot of coffee and an attitude that would have scared Fury himself.  She and Rhodey positioned themselves on either side of Tony, with Vision hovering behind him.  Phil sighed internally.  He might have lost any goodwill he had left by bringing Clint, but he owed it to him to at least try to help him reunite with his family.
He introduced Wilson, Lang, and Maximoff, none of them having heard of him but seeming to understand his importance simply from the reaction of the others.  Only one of their merry group hadn’t come forward, the one he needed to talk to the most.
“Marie says that she saw the cart pulling up outside of Les Danaïdes,” Hogun explained.  He gestured to the map.  “Here, near the Louvre, at 19 Rue de Richelieu.”  Sif, Fandral, and Volstagg all raised their eyebrows.
“This doesn’t change the fact that we have enemies plotting against us in the shadows,” T’Challa said.  “We know who leaked the photos, but we’re still trying to find them.  We are not sure if they are working alone.”
"Much more intriguing since meeting Loki and your son," Steven admitted.  "They have been quite kind in showing the uncultured American around."
For Tony, salvation came in the form of a letter from Jarvis.  His old friend had left the workshop in the country and made his way to London.  He didn't dare risk coming to the carnival himself, so he sent a messenger to find Tony and ask him to visit the airfield west of town.  The carnival was closed on Sunday, so Tony headed off early that morning before Obadiah or his family was up and about.
Loki chuckled and Steven blushed, which seemed to be the normal way of things of late.  They trailed after Thor as he made his way through the exhibition rooms, intent on a small room near the back.
Tony hurried down the bustling alley, dodging washerwomen and delivery men in a vain attempt to make it back before Obadiah missed him.  He did not want to explain himself and his absence, and he knew that Obie would find some way of dragging the truth out of him if he suspected anything.  And Steven Rogers was a secret he did not intend to share.
“No,” Steve said, putting the full weight of any command he still had left in his voice.  “I will not trick him or lie to him again.  I’ve done enough of that.”
“They were not completely wrong, though.  What I have learned is that some of the parties to these Accords were looking for a group of attack dogs on a leash, a way to legitimize their power plays with no regards to the people involved.”
“He’s over there taking advantage of some new person,” Steven protested.  “I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”
Given where the photos were taken, it was someone with the highest security levels in the palace, and that narrowed the search down considerably.  The scientists wouldn’t have had access to the personal quarters of the Avengers, and staff and personnel in the living spaces would not have had access to the labs.  The only people that had free reign in the entire complex were the royal family, T’Challa’s closest advisors, and the Dora Milaje.
Tony was starting to get a little offended on Steve’s behalf. He certainly wasn't offended on his own behalf because hello? She had a point.
“So what Hydra found, is that if they could insert the conditioning as the brain was coming back online, they could manually override the existing ‘code’ in Mr. Barnes’ brain.  And then when the brain came fully back online, he was primed for whatever they wanted to do.  They basically took root access to his mind, something they could never do to someone without the serum.”
Unlike the previous scholarly functions he had attended, there were as many ladies in fashionable evening wear as there were academics and professors.  Loki explained that many of the wealthy families were patrons of the museum, and they attended the premieres of the exhibitions as if they were just another event in the Season.
“They seem to believe so,” Tony said.  “And I have seen the wonders of Heron’s work.  It would not surprise me to find that he’d turned his hand to making weapons at some point.”
“Sir, I’m merely an interested viewer,” Steven explained.  “And a bit of an artist.  I am doing the sketch as a favor to my host this evening.”
On and on the stories went.  Sam read as many as he could before he had to move on.  He couldn’t show these to Steve.  Or Wanda.  Or any of the others.  He wondered if Stark had seen these.  If that had been one of the things that had led him to support the Accords.  If so, he’d never shown the rest of them.
"You should have no guilt at all," Jarvis said, frowning.  "Obadiah Stane has abused your good nature for too long.  It is time you are on your own."
The first thing Tony did after he read Steve’s passive aggressive little letter was drink himself stupid.  Actually, no.  The first thing he did was wing that fucking flip phone at the wall and watch it shatter.  The second thing he did was to drink himself stupid.  Once the hangover was gone, the third thing he did was throw out every bottle of booze in the joint.
Steven and Bucky sat across from him, next to Phillip. They had all been surprised when the chaperone had insisted on accompanying them, but he had surprised them by picking up a set of pistols from Odin’s trunk and checking them with practiced ease. Tony had seen the shock on Steven’s face, and had chuckled to himself. At least someone in their little group was prepared.
In the Great Court, attendees and museum staff huddled in clumps, overseen by even more of the armed men.  Thor and Loki were hunched down behind a buffet table, and Bucky was...  Oh Lord.  Bucky was yelling at one of the armed men.  Two young women cowered behind him, and a third one--the smart one--was trying to slip away and into the crowd.  The armed man finally raised his weapon and knocked Bucky out with the rifle butt.
When he clicked through to the forums, that was when it all really started to sink in.  The first thread he clicked on was one arguing that Colonel Rhodes should have been in charge of the Avengers in the first place, not the so-called ‘Captain America’.
The tent flaps closed as heavily as an iron door, and Tony knew that once again, Obadiah had cost him something he wanted.
Clint nodded.  Vision phased back through the door and unlocked it.  He let the two men in and led them through the hallway and into the kitchen.  There, they found a controlled chaos.
It was the first time Rhodey had seen that particular smile since before Ultron.  It was the joy of creation without fear--a look that Rhodey had missed.  Tony was at his most brilliant when he was creating things that would help his friends.  He let his imagination go in a way that he couldn’t back when he had been designing weapons or when he was designing items for mass market.  But when he was making something that knew would be in safe and responsible hands?  He let his mad genius run wild.
“This one is from in town near the Avengers facility.  It happened after Steve and his gang left for London.  If she had stepped foot out of the facility, she would have been forced into a confrontation,” Tony said.  “Do you have any idea how that would have ended?  It would have ended with someone dead, and her taking the blame.  You think the Raft is the worst thing that could happen to her?”  Tony paused to take a big breath.  “Should I have talked it out with her?  Sure.  When?  When I was on the plane to my godmother’s funeral?  When I immediately afterward had to try to keep Steve from becoming a fugitive?  If you all could have shown me just the tiniest amount of trust…”
“Please note that a copy of this has been sent to every major news organization in the world.  Take your time reading it.  It’s a page-turner.”
Parker, M>Designation-Guest: “Do you realize that everyone I know is going to see this?  They’ll think I’m your flavor of the week!” {dictionary: flavor of the week} {context: sexual partner} {meaning: temporary tryst}
"Pepper is a no-good liar who must not value her job," Tony said. "No, wait. She wasn't lying. I've always found you just as inspirational as Batman.  Maybe even more."
“He was always known for deciphering codes,” Thor said.  “He did not do so professionally, but he has been known to assist several scholars with deciphering ancient puzzles.”
“Tony, I can assure you that your teammates were very worried about you,” Phil said, trying to smooth things over.
Tony left early to meet Mr. Banner at his rooms.  Mr. Banner lived in a modest flat near the museum, above a milliner.  The rooms were quiet and cozy, which seemed heavenly to Tony.  Whenever he visited, he left feeling somewhat jealous of Mr. Banner' situation.
Thinking of Tony brought him back to the news reports that he watched every day, following the trials and tribulations of his former team mate.  Ms. Potts was gone, and to the surprise of the financial analysts, Tony had stepped up and made a strong showing, unveiling a new product line that already had the tech-heads drooling in anticipation.
“Well, actually, I was thinking that I could turn myself in to you.  You can tell the United Nations that I brokered a deal with you, Bucky’s safety for my freedom.  Tell them that it was the only way to bring me in with no further casualties.  Tell them that we’ve been in Wakanda making sure he was secure, and that as soon as we were sure, you brought me back here to face justice,” Steve said.
“You don’t know that, Steve,” Natasha said.  “Let me go and talk to him.  Maybe I can make him see reason.”
“You are too kind,” Steven said, taking out his notebook and pencil.  He remembered Lady Oxford from her visit to the Borson’s.  Her husband looked to be just about as friendly.
“Very well.  Then there is one more task we need to take care of,” T’Challa said.  “It would be a good idea to approach this from a variety of paths.  Someone has to alert Stark and the other Avengers.  I’m sure with the bombing, they know that someone is after them, too.  I can give them what we have, and let Stark set his AI on them.”
Mr. Banner was waiting for him, already attired in his evening dress.  Tony had no appropriate clothes of his own, but Mr. Banner had offered to lend him attire.  Tony changed into borrowed finery, and the two men grabbed a steam coach to the museum.
Steven sat by the window, which slanted up and away from the wall, allowing him to lean over and watch the landscape below. It was night, but he could see the light of fires and homes below them, glowing like the fireflies he and Bucky had tried to catch when they were children.
Steve had the grace to look ashamed.  “I know.  I am still uncomfortable with the language behind the Accords, but I’m starting to see why they were needed.”
“I understood that reference,” the captain replied, deadpan.  “Let me introduce you to the rest of the team.”
It was Lady Oxford's turn to stiffen.  "Justin and I will show ourselves out."  They made a quick, yet still decorous, exit.
“No.  Many are there to, ah, soak in the atmosphere,” Fandral said.  “Flirt a little, have a drink.  Make connections.  Thor said that your family is connected back in America?”
“Think what you will about Stark, but he would never let innocents come to harm if he had it in his power to save them, especially if he feels he owes them a debt of loyalty,” Phil said, no small amount of censure in his voice.  They all looked away at that, shame evident on their faces.  “I don’t know how you all lost sight of that, but I think you need to remember that before you go off half-cocked again.”
Tony found Jarvis sitting outside of the ship in a folding chair reading the paper.  His assistant, Parker, was preparing tea over a small fire, humming to himself.  Tony couldn't help the enormous grin that broke out on his face.
“Do you think there really is some sort of dangerous knowledge hidden in the tablets,” Steven asked Tony.
"Are you here for the Egyptian relics, or general interest," Steven asked, not wanting the conversation to end.  He could feel Philip tense beside him, but ignored the older man.
Captain Rogers sagged against the wall and slid down until he was sitting.  “No,” he said.  “This time I’m trying to make up for my mistakes.”
“Nonsense,” Thor said.  “We’ve seen your journal.  You’re quite the artist.  Please?  It might make Loki stop whinging.”
during his last sojourn at the workshop.  Her sleek lines stood out from other ships, as did her flashy red and gold exterior.  It had killed him to leave her behind when Obadiah came to retrieve him, but there was no way Obie would have let him keep her.  She would have been auctioned off to the first person with enough money they could find.  So Tony had given her to Jarvis, a gift of thanks to the man who had helped Tony hone his talent.
"For Thor' mother," he explained.  "The Borsons don't have the extensive gardens that they once did.  I try to bring her flowers whenever I visit."
“There’s a reason people call him one of the smartest men on the planet,” the Captain replied, with a smile.  Vision wasn’t a great judge of human emotion, but the smile looked sincere enough.  He wondered if Rogers was putting on an act for the security cameras.  Surely he wouldn’t need to lie to the king, although perhaps the ruler wasn’t privy to the entire plan.  “Is he okay?” Rogers continued.  “Have there been any other moves against him?  Are they safe?”
Captain Rogers was the next to approach him, once Natasha had let go.  He had a tentative look on his face, but a smile won out as he extended his hand.
Steve found everyone already in the conference room, sitting quietly.  Dr. Samson sat in front of a laptop, furiously clicking away, brow furrowed in concentration.  When Steve finally sat down at the opposite end of the table, someone killed the lights and Samson looked up.
Tony paused outside of the museum.  The people streaming in were dressed in the finest clothes, and the women had gems draped all over them.  Tony was certain that someone would take one look at him and have him removed, but Mr. Banner showed their invitation, and they were granted entrance with only a bit of a raised eyebrow.
“This is from T’Challa.  It has information on it that might help you track down the people that bombed your tower,” Phil explained.
Steven had the grace to blush.  He did not have much experience with the fair sex.  Everyone chalked it up to his being so serious in his studies, but deep down, he had always wondered why his heart never beat faster when one of the eligible ladies his parents paraded in front of him made his pulse leap.
Tony and Rhodey were deathly still, although he could see that they had both activated their gauntlet watches.  He knew they wouldn’t go any further with the kids in the room, but he willed Clint to keep his mouth shut and his movements non-threatening.
“Which ones?” Tony sneered.  “The one who buried her knife in my back?  The one who sent me off to Siberia?  Or maybe the ones who buried Vision under fifteen floors of debris?  Surely you can’t mean the ones who nearly beat me to death in Siberia and then left me to die?”
“The ship landed at a field east of the city,” he said. “They have been loading supplies, but do not seem to be in a hurry to leave.”
“I know,” Steven said, reluctant to leave. “I have never been aboard an airship before, though. It is certainly a thrilling experience.”
"Ah, Mr. Laufeyson," Lady Oxford said, disdain dripping from her lips.  "I suppose you are here to drag Thor off onto one of your scientific excursions?"
"There was no way to acquire the tablet," Rahul said, settling in for a long bargaining session.  "I brought you the information to help you get the tablet.  You owe me."
“What you have in your hands is documentation and proof that United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has acted in his own interest and the interest of other parties in the inception and enforcement of the Sokovia Accords.  Starting with his involvement with Senator Stern, a known member of Hydra, in his efforts to remove the Iron Man armor from my possession.  Also, his previously undisclosed involvement in the conditions that led to the accident involving Bruce Banner and the creation of the Hulk, along with proof that Ross framed Banner for the incidents that took place in Harlem, New York.  Acts that, with the inclusion of human experimentation, would have placed Ross in a cell next to the heroes he has been hunting.”
He walked toward Steven, hands out in a placating gesture.  “Steven, please let me explain,” he began.
Thor looked at him for several long moments.  “I notice you’re most worried about the legality than any nonsensical worry about ‘unnatural’ acts,” he said.  “England has not put anyone to death for sodomy in over forty years.  And I am in no position to pass judgment.”  He said the last bit quietly.
“The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated,” Phil replied, giving the captain a firm handshake.
He knew what King T’Challa had gotten out of it.  The public that had been skewering the king alive for what they perceived as his betrayal were suddenly back on his side.  Instead of a villain, he was again the sympathetic figure, recently orphaned and trying to do the right thing.  He was even able to parlay that sympathy into a softening public opinion of the Winter Soldier.
Sorry it's been a while since my last update.  Here's a new chapter on offer as an apology :)  Un-beta'd.  All mistakes mine.  All characters Marvel's.
He was on his way back up the ladder when he saw a figure stepping out of the shadows above him. The man with the lion mask chuckled, shaking his head.
Laughing to himself, he took the money pouch and pulled open it open.  He dumped the coins into his hand, and was horrified to see not gold, but cheap tin and iron.  He had been cheated!  He should have made the man count it out in front of him.
He’d only wanted to cheer Steve up.  He’d looked for people who stood behind Cap and were willing to take a stand for what was right.  And sure, those people were on there, and some of them were nice, normal, seemingly sane people who trusted in Cap to make good decisions.  But there were also the people who backed Cap up because ‘no damned dirty foreigner is going to tell Captain ‘Murica what to do’.  Sam didn’t think Cap would want to see those.
The sitting room at Le Monde Arborescence was barely large enough to hold all of the people inside, even without Steven and Thor pacing like caged animals.  Hogun sat on a low couch, speaking quietly with several young street children.  Sif and Volstagg had not been idle while their friends infiltrated the airship.  They had, instead, called upon a network of young children who roamed the streets of Paris.  Pickpockets, errand runners, beggars.  All of whom only had to show up at Sif’s back door for a hot meal.  And if they happened to bring news…
Hogun stood with a nod, sending the children out.  He pulled out a map of the city, and gestured for them to gather around the large table in the center of the room.
After Jarvis left, Fandral poured out steaming cups of tea and handed round the plates of cakes. Tony finally sat down and accepted both a cup and a cake, though he stared off into the distance as he ate. Steven wondered what had the man so lost in thought.
Bucky had the grace to nod his head  vigorously.  “Yes ma’am, Mrs. Rogers.  You know I’d never let anything bad happen to Steve.”
Tony’s friend, Mr. Banner, frowned.  “Then they may have taken him hoping he can help them decipher the tablets,” he said.  “I can decipher the language, but if it is written in code, I don’t know that I will be of much help beyond that.”
Everyone at the table had a look of horror on their face.  Steve stood up, certain that he was about to have to make a run for the nearest bathroom.  He really shouldn’t have eaten a large breakfast.
“If you truly think that, if you think it will put you in a worse position, we won’t do this,” Steve said.  “If it's me, well, maybe I deserve it.  But it’s the only thing I can think of.”  He buried his face in his hands.  “God, I miss Tony,” he mumbled.
Stark, T. >Designation-Boss Man: “My last girlfriend was a CEO.  I have standards.  Well, I’ve developed standards.”
“Yeah Cap?” Tony called as he stood up from the sofa. He recognized that tone of yell. The combination of abject horror coupled with a good dose of humiliation, rounded out by soupcon of sheer, bloody panic. Something had gone horribly, horribly awry on the internet.
"I just searched on the Hulk," Steve explained. He sat down next to Tony and buried his face in his hands. "The item I originally saw from this store was a pair of green boxers with 'HULK SMASH' on them. I thought they were funny."
Parker, M>Designation-Guest:  “I am not your damned girlfriend, Stark!”  {object: newspaper} {use: weapon} {threat level: negligible}
It was Steven's turn to be uncomfortable.  "I have not decided," he said.  "Philip and Bucky mentioned other plans."
Barton, L. >Designation-Boss Lady:  “So we need a cover story.  Hmm.  Friday?  Any suggestion?” {query: suggestion} {error: confused relational status} {query: JARVIS FAQ}
Tony cradled his small sack with his essential tools in his hands as he sat in the back of the cart Hogun had procured. His stomach twisted and turned with dread. He didn’t worry that he wouldn’t be able to disable the airship. No, that would be child’s play. Maybe it was the way his father’s name kept coming up. Maybe it was leaving the carnival and the only home he’d had in so long. Whatever it was, it left him with a feeling that something was going to go horribly wrong.
Parker, P. > Designation-Guest: “On it.” {object: pint container} {use: medicinal} {object:spoon} {use: delivery mechanism} {secondary use: weapon} {threat level: negligible}
“I’m asking you to help me make up for my mistakes.  Mistakes that have hurt too many people, yourself and your nation included,” Steve said, his shoulders sagging.  “I have no right to expect any favors from you.  But I put you into this situation.  Please let me help to get you out of it?”
"Loki!" Lady Frigga said, rising to greet them.  She pulled Loki into a warm hug.  "You've brought me flowers, you dear boy.  And who is this giant?"
“Perhaps,” Steven said.  “But that leaves the problem of finding someone.  I don’t have the same kind of situation you two had.  How does one even begin going about finding someone else with the same desires, let alone court them?”
Either way, Brucie-bear’s lingering trust in Tony warmed what little was left of his heart.  He didn’t know if Bruce knew the whole story, though.  He doubted it, if he was sending word to Tony and not Natasha or Steve.  Tony wanted nothing to do with it, but as a favor to Bruce, he would make sure that the information got to Wakanda.  Maybe it was time to book a meeting with the King.
"Tony!  Lad, it is good to see you," Jarvis said, rising to his feet.  He ignored Tony's outstretched hand and pulled him into an embrace.  "I have been worried about you.  Has Stane let up at all?"
Steve’s face grew stony.  “Just me.  They were following my orders.  I’ll tell the UN that I lied to them to get them to help me.  Whatever it takes to keep them free.”
"My family owns several cloth factories and part of a bank, ma'am.  He supplies uniforms to the army," Steven said.
T’Challa looked at the leader, no, the man, beside him.  It was Steve Rogers broken down to his basic pieces.  No shield.  No rank.  And a touch of humility that had been absent before.  Sure, he wasn’t spoiled like Tony, and he had talked a good game of being a simple man of the people, but there was that arrogance before.  The certainty born in the midst of WWII, where the threat had been so great that he’d been given a duty beyond his years and experience, and those in his chain of command had forgiven any transgression because he got results.
Parker, M>Designation-Guest: “Trust me, Stark, of all of the adults in this building, you are the last that I want to bump uglies with.”
“When they originally put him in cryo-stasis, it was to preserve his body while they conducted more research.  The went through dozens of test subjects, trying to find a more efficient method of controlling him, one that did not rely upon damaging tissue that would ultimately heal and undo their work.  When they had any sort of promising result, they would bring him out of cryo-stasis and try it out.  Ultimately, it would fail, and they’d put him back under.”
“It’s date night material,” Steve responded with a shrug. “You kind of get sucked in, and then you have to keep watching.” Bucky grumbled, but Steve knew that he wasn’t going to say he was wrong.
"No, no," Tony shook his head. "I found the information, then Natasha and Clint came up with the plan."
"Um, yeah, no!" Of course that was Stark. "He loves his hamm-" Thor swung his hand out, landing a solid, and damaging blow to Stark chest, sending him flying backwards.
“Why read all the rumors? I live with all of you,” Wade said, giving Steve the most dead-pan look. Like he should have already known that,
Tony tilted his head a little, then smirked. “Yeah, I will. I’ll have some good pictures tomorrow and the day after, trust me.” If Tony was going to be out on his birthday, he was going to damn well enjoy it with his son, and now his daughter and boyfriend, and that meant going over the top. Steve was going to roll his eyes, but he’d do what Tony asked. “I’ll send you one today, but this one is for your enjoyment. I sent Steve on the Tower of Terror with Peter.” He grinned at Pepper’s delighted laugh.
But as much as he was frustrated with the fugitive Avengers, he would still back his people as much as he could.  He knew that Barney was keeping an eye on Clint’s family, but the elder Barton was kind of an idiot.  So when Phil’s own set of eyes reported that some ex-Hydra goons were seen in the area, he’d taken it upon himself to swoop in.
He was due to face the United Nations committee overseeing the Accords the next day.  He would not deny his actions, and he had carefully outlined his reasoning.  He would, himself, be turned over for disciplinary action, as a signatory to the Accords, but he hoped that given Zemo’s testimony, they would see the overarching need to capture the villain and contain the other Winter Soldiers as an understandable reason.  He wasn’t holding his breath, though.
The airship crew lowered a platform to the ground.  Lion Mask handed off the tablets, which were then hoisted up to the ship, along with half of his men.  Steven thanked God that no one else had been killed, though Bucky would have a hell of a headache.
Loki's own interests ran to the Vikings and their voyages to Britain.  He was by their mythology, and had a gallery attached to his library in which he displayed small artifacts he had acquired.
Philip was in their berth, trying to organize their belongings. Tony assured them that they would only need twelve hours to reach Paris, but none of them knew how long the search would take from there. It was best, Philip had explained, to be settled in.
They had known that T’Challa wouldn’t agree, so they had to do things under the radar, quite literally in some cases.  Even still, they tried their best to throw off anyone who tried to track them back to where they had been hiding--they might disagree with T’Challa’s caution, but they were still immensely grateful for his help.
The day after the bombing, Barney had written that someone was casing the farm.  Less than twelve hours later, he emailed in a panic, saying that Laura and the kids were gone.  Clint had been ready to leave at that moment, but Natasha had insisted that they all sit down and plan.
Steve hadn’t shared how he personally planned to make amends, though Natasha seemed to have some idea (thus the arguing).  He had said that they were to start at the farm and work their way from their, trying to find who had taken Clint’s family.  Barney was waiting for them on the ground with whatever he had been able to discover during their flight in.
"Agent's right," Tony said. "Shoo, all of you. And don't think I won't block this site from your computer, Darcy," he added as she leaned over to see the name of the shop. "Scoot."
“I have just returned from meeting with the committee overseeing the Accords,” the king stated.  He pulled up a chair, prompting the captain to move one of the two pieces of furniture in his cell over to the wall.
And he had to give Stark points on style.  Bulldozing that bar had nothing on pulling the rug out from under Ross in such a public manner.
Hounslow Heath was the site of London's largest airfield.  When Tony arrived, he marveled at the vast number of ships that dotted the landscape.  He bypassed the commercial ships, hulking behemoths that blocked out the sun, and headed for the private berths to the north.  Once there, he had no trouble finding his greatest creation, a shining jewel in a midst of dull gray.
T’Challa stopped and looked at his sister.  The problem with her, is that she was perfectly able to lie to his face if she thought it was for his own good.  Unfortunately, as good as she was at protecting her king, she was still not familiar with the bigger picture, especially in the wake of the Accords.
Phil pushed him away, and straightened his suit.  “What I have done, Agent Barton, is remove them from a hazardous situation.  One, that I might add, they were placed in due to your actions.”
He was fairly certain that the fugitives would react to Laura Barton’s disappearance, so he wasn’t surprised at all when Norberto Benitez made contact to let them know that Hawkeye was bringing his compatriots into the US on a cargo plane.  Phil was just glad he’d had enough warning to be able to greet them on the tarmac.  Considering that neither of his former charges were supposed to know he was alive, he wasn’t quite sure how this was going to go.
The second show went smoothly.  Rumors of the disproven skeptic had filtered throughout the crowd, and the tent was even more packed as people vied to see the Great Oracle.   Herbert, who spent his days looking after the animals, was told that his daughter would marry the son of a wealthy merchant, bringing tears to his practiced eye.  Pepper helped them con a young woman who doubted her lover, and Whitney helped them fool an old tailor.  The crowd was as awed as ever, but Tony could not look at the evening with any sort of pride.
“I will not be fine until I have Loki back,” Thor growled.  “I will hunt them down if I have to.”  He crawled to his knees and tried to stand.
Her face relaxed just a bit.  “I know, James.  But you have to admit that you and trouble have been good friends these long years.”
“Friend Thor!” one of the men exclaimed, a giant whose girth was only slightly dwarfed by his height.
Uh, so.  I totally forgot about this fic.  I would like to take it back up if there is interest.  Have a new chapter to chew on while you decide if you're interested in seeing it go on.
"I could not," Tony said.  "She is yours."  He tried to tamp down the feeling of elation at Jarvis's offer.
"Indeed.  But deep down, he knows I'm not a businessman.  I'd much rather be here, or out with Thor."
He set the journal down and clicked the mouse again.  A hologram of a human brain popped up over the middle of the table.  Several of the Avengers jumped, but those that had worked with Tony were used to such things.
“They have certainly chosen a lucrative endeavor,” Tony said, looking at the tabulating machine. Steven saw his fingers twitch, and he wondered if Tony was tempted to crack into it and look at the inner workings.
Maybe he shouldn’t have protected her from that.  If she’d know just how badly he’d been affected, would she have agreed with him going to help Cap?  Probably not, but maybe she’d know that it wasn’t about him not loving her or the kids.  It was about repaying debts.  It was about giving a hand up to someone who had been knocked down too many times by life.  It was about taking his weaknesses and trying to make them stronger, and helping another victim do the same.
"You're in New York," the voice was speaking again. It was older, commanding, but soft. "You're in your house, in New York. Open your eyes, Tony." Tony shook his head a little. "You have to do it Tony, you need to breathe. You're hyperventilating, part of a severe anxiety attack."
"Just a little scared when the bad man took me," Peter said quietly, and Tony hugged him a little tighter in his arm. "But, he didn't really hurt me. Then Daddy came, then you came, and you both kept me safe, with Jarvis' help."
"You were the one who said that if you were going to have a kid, it was going to be a girl," Tony retaliated, unable to look away from the baby. She still managed to have that smell that all babies had, Tony called it that 'new-human-smell.' He vaguely remembered huffing Peter like an expo marker when he was this small. He wondered if it was just a Universal law that all babies, clones or natural, needed to small that good.
“Just because you said that, you get to use your money for allowance with them,” Tony told him as they left the restaurant. He pulled his jacket back on as Steve walked next to him. “I’m going to make sure that they deplete your account first.” Steve rolled his eyes fondly, slipping his arm around Tony’s. Tony side-glanced at Steve, a little smirk lifting at the corner of his lips.
Jamie made a little whine, but she let Mary put the skirt on her this time. Steve could tell she was pouting from the little huff she made, but didn’t resist anymore. “There we go. Yes, you have the Rogers stubborn streak a mile long, but you also know when it’s time to be reasonable.” Steve pursed his lips a little. “There, all done up and dressed. Come here.” Mary picked her up and the little girl leaned against Mary’s shoulder. “Yeah, you’re just a grumpy gus, not getting enough sleep, huh? I’ve seen it before, first in your brother, and then in your cousins. I am well versed in the ways of you younglings.”
“It’s called love!” Tony called out as Bucky started to push Steve out of the apartment. “You should try it! Start dating!” He could still hear Bucky’s snort from the doorway. “Date Meg!”
"Sorry, I forgot, I'm here to request the pleasure of visiting with Mrs Wilson." Tony had not forgotten, he had expressly told them to turn away anyone who didn't say that phrase, or something very close to it. The receptionist smiled and nodded, pulling out two visitor passes.
“Hey, sleepyhead.” Tony’s words caught Peter’s attention, who looked up towards the doorway then gave Steve a pure smile of happiness at seeing him. “We were just talking about you.”
Coulson just nodded towards the tablet and Tony folded it up, holding it. It turned on and he instantly opened the first folder. He saw pictures of the destruction of what could have only been a SHIELD base. Some test were being conducted, but something went wrong, energy readings had spiked, an influx of power had actually created an implosion underground. There was a picture of a sedan, mostly buried underneath what could only be a couple of tons of cement, with access to the front windshield, the driver’s side airbag deployed and hanging over the steering wheel.
“Wasn’t going to say a thing,” Steve smiled. The blonde maneuvered his best friend over to a half concrete wall and leaned against it. Bucky noticed that some of the women smiled at Steve, waving, and Steve offered a hand in greeting back.
"Wish that I could help, my dear, but alas," Tony said putting a hand over his forehead, "my talents will be of no use for you."
"You've been asleep for so long, and we were all sad, and Daddy said that if we took care of you that you would wake up faster, and so we took real good care of you, but you wouldn't wake up, and, and, and," Peter trailed off as he dissolved into soft sobs, holding onto Mary as tight as he dared.
Tony was aware that he was suddenly leaving the ground involuntary as Thor picked him. Tony's suit tried to adjust for the sudden downward swing, gears turning quickly, straining, but Tony let out a shout of pain as he was thrown into the ground, barely missing his neck cracked. Thor called the hammer to his hand once again, (a pretty nifty trick if Tony was honest), and was in the middle of a downswing when Tony fired off the boots and gauntlets, sliding between his legs and causing him to go down.
The yellow egg cracked again, and this time a piece fell off, quickly followed by more. Tony held his breath, then grinned when a small Jolteon stepped out, almost sleepily. “Vee!” Vee danced a little and went over to the newest pokemon.
“I can’t, Tony,” Steve said with a chuckle. “I’m debriefing with Coulson’s team in twenty, and then I have to meet with someone from PR about getting on top of the Captain America reveal.”
"It's not really working, yet," Steve admitted. "A friend of mine is trying to help me, uh, well, flirt, with music." He had texted Meg before his shower, saying that they needed to up their game. She had responded saying that she would get a list ready for him in a couple of hours. "But, she doesn't know Tony, specially not like you do."
"I have had a contract drawn up, and it's just come back from Legal," Tony continued after a few moments. "I am willing to relinquish the Mark II into your custody, and control, under a couple of very specific details."
"That's the coolest thing I've ever seen," Rhodey breathed, and Tony felt a little satisfaction from it. Tony felt he strength of the suit helping him as he recovered a little, and used the repulsor to move the car from the hole still in his ceiling. "You need me to do anything else?"
"Your team made a mess," he whispered back. "I have to stay here. They know now that there are two kids of a dead Hydra Agent. They're a target." He put a finger on Steve's chest. "Keep them safe."
“No!” Tony cried out, eyes widening up at Howard. “I didn’t steal it! I’m sorry, I was just curious! And then I saw the pokeballs, and two of them were dark-“
"I sometimes have my hands full with Barton and Romanoff," Coulson said shrugging. "You have a young child, so you have patience, and you can handle Stark-" Mary snorted loudly, "-so you have the gumption, too. And, it's an added bonus."
Tony hummed, nodding as the bakers brought in the cake to the kitchen space. Blue ombre, with blue and purple butterflies streaking up the side. "That is a beautifully done cake."
"I'm getting ready to leave for a mission," he started, headed towards the metal. "Wanted to let you know, and check up on that harness?" He jumped back a little when a metal arm came from the pile, Dum-E's claw spinning. He chuckled a little and pat the bot's arm.
"Well, with those two they sometimes share the same mind," Tony argued. "They follow each other everywhere and share the same enthusiasm." Rachel even had to hum her agreement to that statement. While she wasn't Tony's biggest fan, and still often threw some contempt his way, she had indeed lightened up and become more receptive towards Tony. It had helped that Mary was married now as well, and that Tony kept their daughter and grandson close, safe.
He used his good arm to knock on the door, not too loud, but not too soft. Peter had probably just gone to bed, but he kind of hoped he hadn't. Tony had been unable to get a hold of them after the press conference, and he knew that they would have been watching; everyone would have been watching.
"Would be preferable." Bucky caught Steve smiling and furrowed his brows just a smidge. He leaned down then to turn off the monitor. "I've seen what they do to kids," he told Steve. "If the- If he was still alive, he would have tried to get her over to Hydra's side first. It's easier if they give the kids up for training voluntarily." Steve frowned, but didn't say anything, not wanting to interrupt him. "If not, probably would have just killed her and taken the babies anyway."
"I didn't assign her, but I'm pretty sure you can't fire her right now," Mary said, with a roll of her eyes. "She's working with Pepper, as well."
"Can I ask a question? Were you with your husband when he served in the military?" Steve asked her and she blinked. "Were you together when he came home from serving?"
"Captain." Steve looked over and saw the grim face of Coulson standing there. "Suit up." Steve grit his teeth and nodded. Coulson went over, picking up Peter, who was wiggling around, trying to see the TV, not understanding why they wouldn't let him see his Daddy.
"What do you think you're doing here?!" Rachel got closer to George, who was looking a little shocked at this strange woman who came out to yell at him, but didn't stop his stride. "Have you not cause enough trouble?"
Sooo, some of you may have guessed, that I gifted you all with so much fluff recently..... Yeah, I'm an evil author. I giveth and I taketh away.
"Their family is quite well off," Mr. Borson said, rubbing his chin.  "And they make a point of letting us know that we're not."
Steve ignored the references to Tony’s sex life.  “If Pepper is gone, he’ll have to step up, right?” he asked.  “Who else is there?”
The curator had just finished locking the cage when they heard loud noises coming from the Great Court, followed by people screaming.  Steven tucked his notebook away and hurried to the door, worried for his friends.
“I know where they are going.  I must do everything I can to keep them from exacerbating the situation, for everyone’s sake,” he said, already ringing for his servants.  His personal jet had most everything he required, but he would need his armor and weapons, which were in his chambers.

“True.  All you can do is prepare for your hearing,” T’Challa said.  “Perhaps once you are free, you can help repair all of this.  But you must show that you are accountable before anyone will accept your voice at the table.”
“Are you more concerned that he’s here, or that he’s here with someone else?” Thor asked, settling beside him.
Steve grimaced. “I’m coming too,” he said. “Loki is my friend, and I’ll do whatever I have to in order to get him back.”
“I know,” Steve said.  “It just kills me that he is the last person I wanted to get hurt by this.  Why aren’t they blaming Ross?”
Tony ignored the reporters who were clamoring for a statement in order to read his latest email from Bruce.  He had to admit, some of the finer points of his revenge were all for his big green friend.  Granted, some of them were pointed barbs at the crew in Wakanda, but it was Ross who had born the brunt of it.
Rhodes had taken Sam under his wing, no pun intended.  Sam wouldn’t say they were close, but they had shared many an eye roll when dealing with their respective hard-headed best friends.  Seeing Rhodes on the field that day, with blood and the wrecked suit, had been devastating.  So much so that he didn’t even begrudge the shot that Stark took at him.
Things are afoot.  Also, the whole Nakia subplot was decided upon before any casting decisions were made for Black Panther.  Great minds think alike?
“Then how does Bucky have room for that mountainous plate of food?” Loki asked, gesturing at the other American, who was ensconced, along with said plate, between two giggling young women.
Samson cleared his throat.  “Let me talk to Bruce, get the lay of the land so to speak.  I’ll visit them in New York, and see if perhaps Tony will train me to use the technology.  We don’t have to tell him who it’s for.”
“Perhaps we should invite her down to give them some competition,” he said, not missing how his sister’s brow furrowed at the thought.  “Or the two of you could give them a demonstration.”
