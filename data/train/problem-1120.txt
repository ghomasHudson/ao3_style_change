“Then we’ll do like I said, go for the just the bare minimum length of time it’ll take to sort everything out, and go home again. Leave Rosie here, go to the funeral, meet the lawyer dickheads and fuck off home,”
righting the door that had a tendency to become stuck and off it’s track across the bottom if it was opened too hard or fast, or just generally in a way that small children mishandled temperamental doors.
go outside? I’d like to give Sherlock a cuddle,” there was a voice on the stairs, and John turned back to find Rosie standing there, out of her school clothes, a smear of marmite on her chin, one of her dolls under her arm. “He’s sad about Granny. He needs a cuddle,” she said very matter of factly, and if she’d been a year or two younger she might’ve stamped her foot for emphasis.
Sherlock shook his head, preferring to be miserable by himself for a bit longer. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate the young Watson and her often intrepid line of questioning about his day, (and the weather, his bees, pretty well everything that popped into her brain) that usually came once they were all around the tea table. It was just that he wasn’t sure he could keep up appearances enough tonight not to worry her, and if she was worried she’d only be on a mission to figure out what was wrong with him, and try and fix things. Like her father in that respect, Sherlock thought. His brain was a cluttered mess tonight, a tangled web of thoughts that he needed to somehow get all the knots out of before things would begin to make sense, before he’d be able to lift the overwhelm from his chest and make plans that wouldn’t be rash, or unwise.
just with thicker accents and considerably more farm life. Sherlock taken to it like a duck to water, though. Within the first month, their humble little garden, once choked with brambles and dandelions, soon resembled something much more like what he’d been envisioning when Sherlock had first suggested a move.
“I dreamed about Granny last night. I hardly ever have dreams like that, you know, ones where you can really, really remember everything. But I remember this one, like,
“Helmet on properly, is it?” He glanced into the cargo bay of the bike where Rosie was seated, strapped into the bench seat and avoiding putting her helmet on.
Working on a Sunday wasn’t normal for him, the other three GPs don’t have children, so they cover the weekends in a rotating roster between them, and kindly leave John out of it.
“Alright, Rosie. Go wash up for dinner, will you?” John asked her, he’d ordered Chinese on the way home, knowing that with only one Chinese restaurant in the area, (in all of the areas) there would be a long enough wait to order early and get it in time for dinner. “I ordered from Golden Dragon Palace on the way home. Figured you’d want something comforting,” John murmured after the littlest Watson had taken off to the bathroom.
“I thought we might go to the garden centre, we’ve had the last frost now,” Sherlock murmured into his tea, there were a handful of wildflower varieties that he’d loosely planned to put into the empty beds on the north side of the garden, and Rosie was a great help in matters such as shopping. “She was asking about a vegetable patch, I thought we might dig out where her sandpit is and use the frame,” he added, tugging his dressing gown around himself.
is all Sherlock had said to him for the longest time, when he returned from work the day they’d found out.
“In June, I think this year. We’ll give them a bit more time. If we harvest the honey too early, they might not make any more until next year,” Sherlock explained, picking at his own food. John would want him to eat more, he knew, but it already felt like his stomach was full of lead.
“I’m so sorry, darling. I’m sorry we’ve lost her, we’ll figure it out. Don’t worry about London, or your brother. I’ll handle everything,” John held him tightly, he never wanted to let him go at the best of times, but even less so when he was sad like this. “I’ll handle everything, alright?” He soothed, wishing he could take away the weight of all of his pain.
The relationship between the two brothers had (shock horror) improved with distance. Amazingly, it was only a two hour drive back to London, but it felt like much further considering they really didn’t know anyone, and Mycroft had blessedly only shown up (materialised out of thin air, John thought) only once a year ago to let them know that Sherlock’s dad had died. They still bickered, but it lacked the below-the-belt-line cruelty of years passed.
“See dad, I rather didn’t!” God, he almost regretted disturbing the peace that he’d been witness to in the back garden.
into it. “The whole of the flats, her flat, the one upstairs, 221B. Everything in all of them. I don’t know what do make of it,” Sherlock gently pushed John off of him, rubbing his eyes free of tears.
.” Sherlock's smug grin was obvious from the sound of his voice, “I'm informed that the tow truck's on its way,” he added lightly.
And so the wedding continued with the Bride making her grand entrance and with the ceremony and photos going perfectly, if a bit slowly for John's needs. Still, it was lovely and with his job here done for the moment John ran out into the night again, making his way back to the cab in order to make it in time for his speech at Bill's. It was only half-way back to the Murray wedding that he noticed his cane was gone. John giggled as he changed, remembering he'd forgotten it.
“Hmm… I don’t think I’ll share that little detail,” Sherlock winks, “You’ll just have to be surprised like everyone else. I will say that it may possibly be something by the same artist Irene’s song choice is by,”
When Sherlock had finally found Irene’s phone he had quickly replaced hers with a copy, as he had the first time. Unlike the first time, however, he had decided to keep himself hidden from her for an entire three days in order to try and pry away her secrets. He’d probably planned on staying away longer, but he’d only been able to remain hidden until an enormous man followed him to his hideout one night, knocked him out and brought him back to 221B. He had dumped Sherlock unceremoniously at Irene’s feet and Irene had viciously torn at Sherlock’s clothes until she found her phone. She had then smacked him multiple times with a riding crop, hard. “Did. You. Really. Think. I. Wouldn’t. Find. You?” She had shrieked, emphasizing her words with the strikes and adding a few more for good measure.. “You could have got me killed you little monster!”
Molly looks to the screen then back at John and says, quietly, “Er... I have to show you something. Here,” she passes John his baby, who barely makes a slight snuffle as John transfers her onto his shoulder and Molly goes over to the living room to grab her phone.
, it’s her. Something burns inside of John then. He taps on the next recommended video of Sherlock and ‘Iris’ dancing and now he can’t un-see it. The woman Sherlock guides and glides in a quickstep that John hadn’t seen before – the woman Sherlock had caressed during that sensual salsa, the woman he’d twirled into his arms in a cha-cha during his introductory dance – that was Irene. There was no mistaking it. John goes through interviews of them. Now that he’s noticed it’s her, he doesn’t know how he missed that smoky teasing voice, even through that thick accent. He knows it’s her, one hundred percent though, when he sees one particular clip of her, sitting in 221B, on the couch, dressed in one of Sherlock’s robes over her white t-shirt and jeans as she hugs an exhausted Sherlock to her chest. Again, he’s no idea what they’re talking about in the interview – he’s been devouring footage of them for almost an entire hour just to be sure he wasn’t wrong.
John stared at the back of Sherlock's head for a moment through the rain. He was finding out quite a lot about him all in one night. John leaned his body closer to Sherlock, pressing his face onto his back. He felt Sherlock stiffen for a second then relax as John's arms held him tighter for a second.
lie to you, everything I said was the exact truth. Why do you keep accusing me of such horrid things? I may have omitted a few de-”
John sighs, “Yes, I know. Don’t worry. I’m sure we’ll see him again another time. For now… time for bed little lady,” he mumbles and turns off the telly.
While John went to change Sherlock went over to the closet to snap more photos and toss around some odd looking frilled suits and cravats. John came out of his room in that moment dressed in a neon-green suit with a purple shirt, but didn't see Sherlock, “Holmes?” He called and Sherlock popped his head out of the closet to see, almost instantly recoiling and half shielding his eyes while he took a picture, “That, is vile.” He stated, then pulling out out a suit with leather pants that seemed a tad tight for John and asked, “What was the theme here?”
Edit: I had to edit this one first as I realized after posting it how fucking bad it was. XD So yeah, it's not perfect but I suck and I'm too lazy to try and make it better (also I'm anxious to get to the next chapter.) John and Sherly are feeling a little ooc right now but I'm guessing it's because I'm half directly quoting Jane and Kevin/Malcolm. Anyway I'm half-way through the next chapter... soooo see you soon. Also if anyone wants to beta/edit. Go for it, I'm a horrible writer guys. I have to stop making John say mate. He's starting to sound like a pirate. "Matey mate mate." :P anyways bye!
Anthea simply stared up at him from her computer, “You know he won't approve, Sherlock why do you keep asking?”
His autopsy report seems to be missing, so now we have one dead person with no records on just how he left the world of the living and a missing artist that is being hunted down by a man threatening a bunch of sex workers.”
Sherlock says nothing, and John realizes his hand is still resting on Sherlock’s. He takes it back without being too obvious about it and opens up his menu as he says, “That would be great, thanks.”
“Oh, it’s not a worry, love, not a worry at all. I’ll take her downstairs with me for a biscuit and a cuddle while you pack up her things. You can come pick her up when you’re ready,” she says, taking the baby as Sherlock hands her over, still eyeing Mrs. Hudson.
Dorian had nodded, though he’d given a wistful look in Sherlock’s direction before he’d smiled and excused himself to go sit with Cecily, Jack, and Algy.
Back at the clinic John stood sorting through print-outs of the mock-ups for the clinic's new ads. “Do you think she'll like these? Mary, I mean.” He asked Irene as she swirled around on his swivelling chair staring at the ceiling.
“Give me my coffee, you wicked boy.” She teased, as they walked towards the change rooms, “Now you must tell me what happened the other night, you were barely there and then you just disappeared. I was terribly lonely, you know. You meet someone?”
“It’s alright, Sherlock,” John says, suddenly feeling guilty that it’s Sherlock who is feeding his baby and not him, “I’ll do that, you should get to yours before it gets cold.”
John took that opportunity to glare at William or Sherlock or whatever his name was. Sherlock gave him a little pout and turned back to Harry.
“Or perhaps you could tell me, nurse, how my little brother is doing, seeing as how you have so much time.” Mycroft seethed at the woman.
“Nonsense John, it was my fault you had to do it. Besides, you saved the day. I think you've done enough. Dimock, please, allow me.” Sherlock interrupted.
“She – She was over by Mrs. Lauriston's garden, just lying there in the rose bushes. I was just getting home from my shift at the Inn when I noticed an odd shape peeking out and, and, Oh! Mr. Scott it was terrifying!” She burst into tears again, clinging to DI Dimock.
“Where did he even get it on such short notice? Wasn’t it like three in the morning?” Sherlock wonders, his memory probably featuring the same images John’s was.
John removed his gun from his waistband at this point, preparing to fire if he spotted any danger. Finally he saw what the men where approaching as the torch light Sherlock's captor was shining revealed the hood of Sherlock's vehicle. John knew it! He was right!
But Molly cuts him off with a hand gesture for silence as she finishes tapping on her phone’s screen. She brings up a video, which she presents to John and...
John looked at Irene sadly. She tried to hide her worried look by giving him an encouraging smile as she opened the door for him. John caught it anyway and squeezed her hand on his way out.
Sherlock arches his back and grabs hold of the other man’s neck, pulling him closer against Sherlock’s form and revelling in the feel of the soft blonde hairs at the nape of his partner’s neck. Their bodies are slick with sweat and the air feels like it’s steaming around them. “Jjj~” A light hitch in his voice, “–Jjjjeeesus.” Sherlock moans as he feels a ripple of pleasure run through him after a particularly well-aimed thrust from his partner. The other man’s cock twitches inside him in response to Sherlock’s sensual groaning and grinding. He opens his mouth to bite down on Sherlock’s shoulder when suddenly Sherlock’s cell phone begins to ring.
“I learned many skills when I worked in commitments for Mycroft.” Sherlock spoke smoothly as he answered. Almost too smoothly... probably a lie then.
“You're a Doctor, he's a nurse. Same difference. What's the good in having that fancy medical degree if you're not going to abuse your power over nurses?” Irene winked. John didn't reply to the bait, certain she was thinking of something incredibly inappropriate
They stand there for a moment, both men with their faces brought close together. For the first time in years John feels like he and Sherlock are finally okay and he is overjoyed. He hadn’t realized how separated he’d felt from the other man since he’d returned from the dead, but now he knew, they’d been eons apart. Well, no more of that. John would make it his absolute mission to never lose this again.
John tried his best to smile, “Oh...well, er... Heh... too much information, Harry,” He chastised as he watched her walk towards her bedroom with that shy smile.
John took Sherlock's hand and guided the device to his own lips, stating, “That is not true, and I'm going to show you, you are wrong.” And he took the tux with him into the bedroom to change.
” they reach each other and Sherlock immediately takes her hand, spinning her so that her arms are crossed in front of her while he stands behind her and they sway to the romantic tune, “
“Oh, come now, John,” Irene said, coming over and stroking his arm in comfort, “It's not so bad. It's just one measly article... in the front page of the section, with hundreds of photos of you on it... who's upset?”
Sherlock wanted to play at PI again and John, now already here, had no choice but to follow. He walked behind Sherlock and the two Detectives to the entrance of the old woman's house.
“Irene?” Sherlock whispers just as the very woman slams the flat’s door open while she pants his name into the room worriedly asking loudly:
“She's...” John looked at Mary apologetically then flicked his gaze to the table, “Getting her hair done. I'm just helping out.”
“I... I um... just want you to know, Sherlock,” He said, raising his eyes to the other man, “I never do this.”
John allows himself to wrap his own arms around Sherlock. He tries not to linger on the thought of his finely muscled frame as his friend holds him closely.“Oh I don’t know,” he comments “You seemed to be doing just fine without me,” and he knows it’s kind of petty but apparently his mouth has a mind of its own..
His partner growls, “God yeah.” He slips down Sherlock’s body and then sits back, “let me just get the-“
, Sherlock!” John places a hand on Sherlock’s face and feels himself against the man’s cheek. Sherlock looks absolutely marvellous like this, his lips shining with saliva and
Rosie actually is seated far too close, with her little face almost pressed to the screen while she watches Sherlock bow at the comments.
“Ugh...” John laid his head on the bar, his hands holding his glass in front of him, “You don't know Harry. She's going to want me to do everything. I'm not just going to be her Best Man, I'm going to be taking care of everything.”
“The Best Man is a peculiar gentleman,” Sherlock said into a little recording device he held up to his lips as he closed the door behind him, following John into the flat. “So, tell me how you feel about Harry's whirlwind romance?” He asked, leaning against the refrigerator as John went back to washing his dishes.
God, John feels like an idiot. He doesn’t understand Sherlock at all. First he’d said women weren’t his area, then he’d fallen for Irene. First he’d said that he didn’t have a boyfriend but when John had attempted to ask him out he’d shut him down before he could begin. First he’d shut John down and then he’d suggested a date when John already had plans. First he’d interrupted John’s date and ruined his chances with Sarah then he’d met The Woman. First he’d said he didn’t love the woman, (“love is a chemical defect found on the losing side”) then he’d admitted that he texted back sometimes. First he’d abandoned John for two years, making him mourn his loss, and then he’d returned to him and gone through hell to remain his friend. First he’d proposed to Janine, then he’d called it human error. First he’d admitted to texting The Woman (and yes, that one did bear repeating because...), then he said it didn’t mean anything, and how could it not mean anything when he KEPT HER PHONE?
“God he was furious with us,” John says. The couple had gotten away in the end, but Sherlock had been thrilled at solving the mystery and after chasing them around had eventually just laughed and told John he was hungry. They’d left poor Greg in the house until five am when his cell finally got signal and he’d yelled that he was going to kill them for abandoning him.
“Hmm, yes.” Sherlock leaned against the Motorcycle and raised a brow. Even with the rain plastering his hair to his face he looked extremely handsome standing there, waiting for John. He turned around then and extended a long leg over the bike and got up. “Come on, John. Rain's probably getting rid of evidence as we speak, best we get on with it.”
John tilts his head to look at her, “Yeah? You recognize that sound already, do you?” He asks her this with a slight bit of amusement.
Irene smacks him with the pillow he was using to salvage his dignity, making him squawk and tumble out of bed, the last dregs of the coffee spilling on the floor.
When they’d arrived at 221B Sherlock was visibly relieved. John had frowned to himself a little at that but hadn’t mentioned it, instead making Sherlock promise that he’d get some rest.
They continue through a few more songs and as the playlist goes on they begin to grow slower along with Rosie’s energy. Rosie eventually begins to look quite tired and starts yawning. With each song that Sherlock’s playlist drones she grows more and limper in his arm as he sways. Finally, a soft song begins as her eyes begin to droop. The song starts with a sensual and soft guitar playing. Soon enough a woman begins moaning in a smoky soft tone to words in Spanish. “
“This is none of your business.” John answered, pulling at the door. Sherlock stepped forward a bit, his face inches from John, and licked his lips. John looked down for a second and in his moment of distraction Sherlock pried the closet door open.
, John?” He asks rolling his eyes, “But in answer to your question – no. I’m not sure what more I can learn from Gray considering he doesn’t seem to want to talk about Basil or Francis. Plus, like I said: he’s annoying. I think we should find a few of his and ‘Harry’s’ mutual acquaintances. I was thinking we start with Jack. He’s in love with Henry’s sister. There was a scandal last year about Dorian and Gwen, and while he and Jack seem to be friendly, Jack can’t possibly appreciate what Gray did to Gwen’s reputation. Gwen herself is friendly enough with Dorian right now because of
Sherlock looked at John's eyes and decided it was best to get down to brass tax, before John hit him in the face, “I just asked if you'd gotten my note.” Sherlock answered, “Oh and I have something for you,” He looked down for a moment and rifled through his messenger bag.
Sherlock doesn’t speak. He seems a bit startled for a moment as he stares back at John like some kind of deer in headlights, his eyes wide and pupils dark.
Sherlock’s eyes open wide at the sensation. John’s really going to do it, isn’t he? He’s going to give Sherlock a fucking rim job. “Ah!” Sherlock breathes as he feels John’s tongue enter him, and fuck if that’s not amazing. Sherlock feels the heat in his abdomen grow stronger and his cock swell impossibly more. Jesus, it aches to be touched, but as soon as Sherlock tries to move his hand, John holds it down in a vice grip and growls a warning into him.
“Oh!” Harry turned to an extremely handsome man behind her who was smiling and dragging a huge suitcase that suspiciously enough matched perfectly with Harry's bag. “I always meet the
“My goodness! Oh my goodness indeed!” The blonde hostess smiles at them, her face teary-eyed even through her grin. “How are you feeling after all that?”
Anthea sighed again, and got up from her position leaning against the cubicle desk, “Molly, Greg, John... follow me. This is private Holmes business.”
“And that's just her CV. She is an unbelievable boss. Everybody loves her, everybody. And she loves the service dogs she trains more than anyone else. She doesn't eat meat, which is pretty sweet of her, and she would rather spend all her time helping people than anything else.” John continued, smiling wistfully.
John laughs with him, “Yep, our team is fucked. Do we all pitch in for drinks or do we take it out on Mr. Moncrieff for opening his big mouth?”
John giggled and moments later came out of his room swaggering in a bright red Zoot-suit complete with suspenders, over-sized shoes, tie, fake cigar and a large feathered fedora. Sherlock burst into laughter. “Okay, next show me this one,” Sherlock said as he pulled out what looked like a traditional men's kimono.
John gets right into some small talk. People want to know if he is medical doctor, where they live in London and the like. From the corner of one of his eyes John sees Sherlock walk past just a few feet away. John turns his head. Sherlock has showered, his hair is still slightly wet. He wears that purple shirt and – even for his standards – surprisingly tight charcoal trousers.  To be frank, he looks breathtaking. John even thinks he can smell his expensive and, well, delicious aftershave.

“We’re both scarred.“ Sherlock’s voice sounds deep and dark. “So who cares.“ He places a small kiss onto the white, thick scar tissue on John’s shoulder. John takes of the rest of his clothes, aided by Sherlock’s hands, which are expressing something between shyness and growing desire.

John didn't object and feebly went back upstairs. Sherlock followed him half an hour later. He brought his laptop and sat in the armchair next to window,
John wanders to one of the other tents, just planning to ask Marcus if he has seen Sherlock. Instead he is urged to tell some stories from his blog. Apparently his blog is being read even by elderly folks in the countryside. When John is just about to summarize Sherlock’s deductions from their case in Dartmoor a few years ago, he stops mid-sentence. Suddenly he can smell Sherlock’s aftershave. Looking around to locate him, he hears Sherlock’s voice summoning him in a whisper, “John, come.” Just these two words. John turns around, but he only sees Sherlock’s back vanish in yet another group of cheerful people. “Er, right. You know, actually you can read it all on the blog. I think I have to go now... just excuse me,” he distractedly manages to say when he leaves the small bunch of people gathered around him.
“Oh,” Molly blushes slightly, marveling at how similarly to Sherlock this man speaks and – she mentally shuts down that though, actually, because she is not doing this again. Yes, this man is handsome, yes he sort of talks like Sherlock, no Molly will not develop an immediate crush, “Er… yes, my friends said they’d let me know how they’re doing, but I guess they’re fine…”
Tess wipes a tear from her face with no restraints, “You caught me. I’m quite emotional over it,” Her laugh is a little watery as she turns to the judges, all of which are also smiling, and some of which are doing so while dabbing at their eyes as well. “And it looks like some of our judges are teary eyed as well, isn’t that right Darcey
“What’s gotten into you?” John continues laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation, as Sherlock grabs the plate with his free hand and places it on the table, out of Rosie’s reach. To both men’s surprise Rosie doesn’t cry and as both men each clean up the hand that he’s holding with their respective napkins she ceases to struggle. Instead, she sits there giggling with an adorable twinkle in her eye.
He leaned back into his seat again and shut his eyes. Images from the last weeks came back to his mind. The hospital, mainly. Mary. The girl. It hurt. It
The chase followed. That chase that left John with a bad blow to his head, passing out, stumbling down to the cold concrete floor of the warehouse. Seeing

John woke up, all of a sudden immensely startled. Within the blink of an eye he was wide awake. His heart hammered in his chest the way it had last night.
Sherlock still isn’t used to this. He doesn’t quite remember who started it – Mrs Hudson? Sounds like a thing Mrs Hudson would do – but somehow it stuck.
“We probably do, John,” Sherlock says, rubbing his nose. “And we should. Your head is too hard to repeat this.”
And he did fall asleep. For a few hours in a row, the first time since he moved out of Baker Street.
“I don’t know. The fucking amazing birthday, maybe,“ John growls, bending over to Sherlock and kissing him, hard.
Sherlock’s breakdown in 221b, he moved out of their shared flat and lived at Baker Street again.
When they get off the cab John sees a curtain on the kitchen window move. A second later, Mrs Holmes opens the front door. She is so happy to see Sherlock, John realizes. She hugs him tightly, kisses him on both cheeks. When Sherlock manages to escape from her, she looks at John. She hesitates for a moment and finally opens her arms to give him a slightly more official hug.

When they have finished dessert, Sherlock pays and they step out of the restaurant. John feels light-headed with the wine and Sherlock’s hints at

His fingers are so cold they hurt. When Sherlock is finally done with Lestrade, John isn’t only exhausted and on low blood sugar, but in an exceptionally bad mood, bordering miserable, actually - as he is most of the time these days. So when they are about to leave the crime scene and John trips over a bag of equipment from Anderson’s men, he shouts a tirade of swearing that makes the entire NSY team turn their heads.

just takes Sherlock’s hand once more and squeezes it. Sherlock understands. Then he bows down to him and kisses him on his forehead, gentle and feathery.

One of the following nights, Sherlock wakes up. His room is dark. John is spooning him, his face between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and his hands around his chest and belly. Sherlock lies in the dark for a long time. He feels John’s heart beat and feels his breath on his back. He can smell his skin and still tastes his kisses from just a few hours before. He takes his hand. He kisses it and whispers, „I love you, too, John. Love you, too.“
And John is certain he is about to come from just this. He swallows a curse and then feels Sherlock’s cock against his belly again. Now it is him dropping
officers went to see the owners this morning, none of them opens the door. Doesn’t sound like a coincidence, does it?“
“Yes, dear, that’s better. Let’s get you dressed properly again. Come here, love, there’s new clothes.“
Sherlock guides him a steep way of steps carved into the cliff down to the beach. Once they arrive at the beach he takes off his shoes and rolls up his trousers.
Yet they take their time getting used to this. As much as John would love to strip Sherlock’s clothes down and touch him everywhere, he doesn’t want to

clearly. Pretty amazing, don’t you think Sherlock?” She was in fine form then, Sherlock thought to himself, as he placed a plate full of scrambled eggs down in front of her once she found her way to her usual place at the table, her chair boosted slightly by a pink vinyl cushion that squealed with trapped air every time she shifted her weight, sending a shiver down Sherlock’s spine when he heard it. “Wow, Papa, these eggs are
“She’s left her sister the flats in Clapham, John, but she’s left Baker Street in my name,” the once detective all but whimpered, divulging the fact that they now owned prime Central London property, an ironic thing since he had vowed never to set foot in London again.
“I really love going on the bike with you, papa,” Rosie murmured, just loud enough for Sherlock to hear as he leaned in to unbuckle her and help her climb out. With the bike locked and helmets put away, they went into the garden centre. He’d never expected to find gardening so therapeutic, but the backyard at the cottage had been a complete disaster when they’d purchased it and moved in. Rosie had been small and had desperately needed a place to play, and John had been at the clinic most days, so he and the toddler has spent the long summer days in the yard, getting it under control and resembling something suitable for a little girl to spend her afternoons. They had painted hives together, pulled weeds, she even handed him bricks as he’d built the retaining wall around the edge of the garden. An unexpected discovery about himself, but he knew John was right. It was good for him to have something to do.
Even after all these years, even after John had spent so much time with him, he still found himself bracing for impact at the news that Martha Hudson had passed peacefully in her sleep at the age of eighty nine.
“You need a shower, Sherlock. All muddy,” she chided softly, seemingly rather enjoying the position of power she seemed to think she had put herself in.
“Honourable polinators, John.” Came Sherlock’s reply, but he didn’t much like the thought of having to deal with the unwelcome sensory input that mosquito bites would prove, so hand in hand the two of them walked back inside, his heart a little lighter for the time spent in the garden, but even more so for the dear little girl that had offered him her dolly and held him tightly. Rosie kept hold of his hand, apparently John’s speech had inspired her and she seemed rather invested in taking care of Sherlock, bless her, John couldn’t help but grin up at his husband as their daughter carefully stroked his arm.
It had ended up being a much more valuable investment than either John or Sherlock could have anticipated. Rosie loved it, and John had his own, passenger free bike that they’d sometimes take if they were all going up to the local park together. More than anything else though, Sherlock felt like he had a fraction of his freedom and independence back. With Rosie occupied in the cargo box, and the wind in Sherlock ears there was no expectation to carry a conversation the entire way there and back, and when they did it was because she’d seen something like a deer, or a plane in the sky that she’d deemed interesting enough to point out to him.
It’s also significantly less risky than staying inside, since Rosie was usually at her exuberant and bouncy best, first thing. Keeping her asleep for as long as humanly possible was a good thing, since Sherlock truly wasn't a morning person. The spring weather was starting to come in quick little teasing bites, a couple days of sun and warmth, then back to bucketing, bitter rain. Today was a good day, weather wise at least. He was loathe to leave Sherlock and Rosie together all day, but his husband isn’t a baby, and they’ll manage, even in light of the devastating news.
“Oh, do we get to pull the combs out of the hives soon, then? Can I spray them with the sleepy dust? That was great fun last time,” Rosie grinned, her blonde curls mussed from sleep.
There’s no way out of it. We have to go back,” John wrapped his arms around Sherlock at that, holding him close, and tight, and safe, cheek pillowed atop the curls he’d grown to love over the years. He wore them unstyled, ringletty and wild most of the time now. Every now and then some scummy journalist would come snooping, looking for them. John hated to think about what their fans thought of them now. The blog was abandoned, but he knew they still had something of a following. Every now and then Isobel would mention that there was gossip in the village about them. Mostly though, the small town, village lifestyle they’d thrown themselves into had offered privacy and solitude like they’d hoped for.
It was easier to do these things with her there, it was almost like he had her to hide behind. The villagers left him well enough alone as it was, he’d gained the reputation of being a bit aloof and mysterious, which Sherlock supposed wasn’t entirely untrue. It meant that he was able to avoid small talk for the most part, with Rosie happy to yammer anyone’s ear off given half a chance. He caught up with her, and she tossed about fourteen packets of seeds into the green basket. “And what have you selected, dear?” Sherlock looked over the girl’s choices. Mostly inappropriate for the weather, but they’d sit in a drawer in the shed until it was warmer. They wandered through the aisles, gathering bits here and there. Rosie chose a pair of pink gardening gloves with floral patterning on the back, that she apparently desperately needed, and that Sherlock couldn’t find it in him to deny her after the news of the previous day. When his phone began blaring Wagner’s ‘The Ride of the Valkyries” from his breast pocket, he transferred the basket over to his daughter, “take these to the till, Rose,” he murmured, passing her two purple notes from his wallet as well, before answering the call.
John made it back to Stamford's wedding for his speech and the traditional dance after dinner. After the party got properly started, with everyone dancing and drinking John saw his opportunity and dashed back out again to the Murray wedding to dance with Irene for a bit before she decided to fuck a bridesmaid in the dance hall again. And so it went for the rest of the night, John travelling between both parties, changing back and forth from his traditional black tux to his Achkan again.
As he leaves, a sigh of relief escapes her. Finally, this weird secret is no longer hers to keep and telling John alone has made her feel like a tremendous weight has been lifted off her shoulders. She just hopes Sherlock doesn’t mind her telling.
Molly returns with John’s toddler wrapped in her arms, and catches him looking at the screen. Her face goes beet-red and she says, with a nervous laugh, “Sorry. Guilty pleasure.”
Sherlock felt empty as he stared at nothing in particular while he sat at his couch in his own flat. His heroine needle sat neatly back in its box as Sherlock took in the feeling of the drugs rushing through within his veins and burning him up inside.
“Sherlock?” He calls, a little apprehensive. He goes to knock again but finds the door falls open if it’s own accord. It looks like Sherlock left the door unlocked. He enters the apartment quietly and again, stops to listen for any signs of life within the apartment.
John stared for a moment until he realized who it was that was praising his actions tonight, “Stop. I'm not doing this with you again. I don't even know why I've let you stand here and talk to me.” He made to leave in the other direction.
“Fine.” Sherlock conceded, and gave himself away when he blinked before he started, “I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact–”
Those were just the words John had been waiting for. Looking pleased, John mercifully takes himself in hand and coats his throbbing cock in a bit more lube before lining himself up at Sherlock's entrance. Leaning forward, John lifts one of Sherlock's legs up over one of his shoulders and kisses his shin before asking, "Ready?"
,’ Molly thinks, panicking because Sherlock and John seem to be having a very intimate moment, dancing together and pulling themselves deeper and deeper into the throngs of people. ‘
“Sherlock... Sherlock I'm s– I'm here, okay? I'm here.” John sounded closer now, like he could touch him.
The waiter scribbles it down and looks to Sherlock who adds, “And I’ll have the lemon chicken piccata with the braised vegetables—”
I'm an Asexual Virgin with a capital A and Capital V. Not particularly sex-repulsed, which is I guess how I was magically able to pull that sex scene out of a hat. (o////o) I did actually do a bit of research for this... mostly by reading smutty fanfictions (
Sherlock, to his credit, doesn’t respond negatively and Irene mentally commends him for his cordial demeanor as he responds, “Oh you’ll be fine. I’ll keep you updated as things progress…. or don’t, ha.”
Sherlock grins charmingly, hoping his relief at the young man’s absence isn’t too apparent. “Ah…  don’t worry about texting him, Henry. I’m sure Dorian won’t be too upset with me if I have a few drinks with you to celebrate before I join him.”
“Sorry?” Harry's asked, “You humiliated me in front of every single person that we know, and you think you can just say,
pick her up and the evidence is in your trunk. Pink suitcase, and inside it, likely her missing phone.”
“the guy who not only hosted my bachelor party and helped my wife design the invitations. He also went with us to the caterer,” Mike had said,
John laughs and pounces on Sherlock, holding him down as he teases him for a kiss, “Oh, I’m sorry, Sherlock, does this bother you?”
Sherlock’s breath hitches in his throat as those very words are released into the air by the machine. It had almost become background noise, but right now, those words... they were... they were...
John didn't register the second half of that comment.“Deal...?” John repeated, “What deal? I mean... er... Nothing happened between the two of you... did it?”
“up next we have our master of mystery, transforming from detective to dancer, the incredible Mr. Holmes!”
“Very funny, Mycroft.” Sherlock got up from his chair and crossed his arms, glaring at his brother as he stood at the door leaning on his umbrella.
because Bride-zilla's on the loose!” With that she stormed out of the flat, slamming the door in her wake.
Iris takes three confident steps forward and kisses Molly’s hand in greeting before Sherlock can stop her. “Pleasure to meet you, Molly,” the gorgeous dancer purrs.
“Sherlock!” Molly feels her cheeks pinken, “Hi! Ehm, yes - Everyone else was... unavailable. Er... d’you need something?”
, Now my baby's dancing, But she's dancing with another man,” the voice wails as the couple in white twists and twirls around the stage. John frowns minutely as he watches them dance. He recognizes right away that this isn’t Sherlock and Irene dancing and looks on at their waltz impassively. He isn’t really interested in seeing them, and their steps don’t seem to match up with the song. He leaves the telly on but switches his attention back to his phone, deciding to have a look through more of Sherlock and Irene’s interviews, trying to see if there is any indication of a reason she might be here or a clue with as to why she’s pretending to be a famous Russian dancer. Instead he finds himself staring at Sherlock’s red-rimmed eyes on the tiny screen while the deep baritone narrates to the camera.
“So... let me get this right, you would rather go have drinks with swimsuit models than come to my incredible doctor party?” John teased as he brought tea over.
“Oof!” Sherlock grins and removes his arm from his face in order to reach down with both hands and pick her up, holding her up high and then bringing her down for a kiss on her chubby little cheek. She giggles happily and returns his kiss with her own sloppy kisses. Sherlock sits up again, happy toddler in his arms and finally dares to look at John. He doesn’t know what else to say so he just murmurs “Thank you, John,” his tone coming off more timid than he thought it would.
“Attractive?” Sherlock asked, winking as he pushed himself forward, supporting himself against John's chest with one hand and the other reaching back behind himself. John smirked and watched him “I think I've got some lube in the pocket of my trousers, can you reach?” Sherlock asked as him, gesturing over John's head and rocking himself back on his fingers while rubbing himself on John's stomach, “I don't think I can wait much longer,” He admitted through rough breaths.
John gave her a tight lipped smile, but stood and hugged her none-the-less. “No, no, Harry of course I don't mind. I'm sure it'll suit you very well.”
John watched as the man waited for Sherlock to enter the car in the driver's side, then got in after him, the torchlight barely visible now as they were inside the car. Nothing seemed to be happening. John walked around carefully and approached the car slowly and as quietly as he could from behind the rock. He crouched low so he wouldn't be seen through the windows. He got as close to the passenger's side where he'd seen the captor as he possibly could and tried to listen.
“The ones you're waiting for then? Are they nervous?” The man asks, leaning closer to Molly as the judges begin to speak, praising Sybil for her performance.
“Your little secret. Whatever it is.” John answered, registering a chic looking lamp, and started listing off things, “Your parents got divorced-”
Molly continues to humming her song as she finishes stitching the Y incision on the body up. As she cuts that last thread she hears muffled voices coming towards her from down the hall.
John’s grin is wicked as he grabs hold of Sherlock’s hips and pulls him forward, “C’mere, you,” he grunts and brings his lube coated fingers into Sherlock’s entrance once more. Sherlock circles his hips in a tease and John laughs a little, stroking his long leg with his free hand, “You,” he says, pinching Sherlock’s ass cheek, “really ought to learn to stop being such a cocky smart-arse.”
John is silent again for a minute. He leans forward to get a better look at Sherlock’s face. “And did it? Help, I mean?” He asks this sensing that the answer won't be a positive one.
shame. Still, even with his lack of shame it is clear that Jack is more practiced. His body is almost liquid in the smooth way it flows from one movement to another. He also throws in some very smooth spins and fancy arm movements along with impressive footwork that Dorian could never hope to imitate so evenly.
“Right, well that makes perfect sense because they're all...” Sherlock struggled to find a word, “all so charming.” He said, making it clear he didn't mean it at all.
John feels his face glow red at Algernon’s suggestion. Yeah, that’s kind of the opposite of what he wants to be doing right now.
“Awwww” Molly cooed, “Sherlock how do you say all that in just one breath and stand there telling me you don't believe in true love? Even if you say it sarcastically it still sounds so lovely. You've made commitments the golden standard of wedding announcements. Every girl on the planet rips open that page first thing Sunday! Brides kill to get in there. Sherlock you're an honoured guest at their weddings, I'm sure you'd meet someone if you just–”
Also, that last bit, originally Jane says "sexy" but I couldn't picture Sherlock saying 'sexy' so many times so I wrote "attractive"... I dunno. I still think it's funny.
John gaped. The fucking nerve of that guy, was he fucking serious? He turned the page back to the page with William Scott's number and dialled it immediately.
Sherlock pouts and attempts to continue to look affronted, though all the tension has fallen from his shoulders now and his eyes look more relaxed, “Yes, well, I suppose I knew that going in.” Sherlock replies.
“Not at all. I could use a break myself,” Dorian shrugs, “Let’s go up to Henry’s — it’s much quieter and less crowded, and the bar is much better!” The boy takes hold of Sherlock’s hand and drags him in the direction of the stairs, shouting at John and Greg to follow, “Come along, gentlemen! Drinks are on me!”
John is about to lean in when Sherlock’s phone makes a very familiar text alert noise, and John freezes. His eyes transform into ice chips and in a flash the moment is gone. It’s a text from The Woman.
Sherlock laughs and lifts a hand to spin John, “Didn’t think you’d know the name of this man either, to be fair,” he shrugs, “Honestly, I have no idea about half the pop songs on here. Irene and I are trying to decide on our street dance since we’ve had to begin changing our original set. I had a line-up already laid out but it seems the judges want us to switch it up a bit.”
“Mm, must have been difficult for you,” is Sherlock’s sidetracked reply. As he watches the video he feels tenderness in his heart and doesn’t notice the sappy smile he wears while Irene watches him. It’s a video of little Rosie Watson bouncing and attempting to kick in some sort of toddler dance while she watches Sherlock and Irene do their jive performance on telly. It’s quite possibly the most disturbing yet amazing thing Sherlock has ever seen.
Meanwhile, Rosie nods smiling and exclaiming “ok dahdah, buh bye,” and waves at him as Sherlock bounces her while they descend the stairs. She claps her hands at the bouncing, chanting, “Hop, hop, hop!”
“Oh are you going to check my finger work now?” Harry called back as she jogged towards Mary and disappeared behind the curtain. John had never wanted to shoot himself more in his entire life.
“Whoo-hoo!” A knock at the door wakes Sherlock from his thoughts and Sherlock realizes that he’d been thinking much too hard as he hadn’t noticed the shower begin to run.
John joined the women in the queue of the outdoor concession stand set up to raise funds for the music program of Archie's school. The talent show was to be performed on an outdoor stage that had been arranged to encourage more guests to come see the children's acts. Archie was to have two performances, one on his own on the violin and one playing a duet on the piano with another child. John was eager to get some food in his belly now, rather than later. He didn't want to have to be hungry during Archie's playing, the kid was a natural musician.
John laughed, “Yes, Irene, completely true. Now go out and wait for us. Oh! And let Sherlock know I'm still here. He must be panicking right now.”
Jack raises a brow as he shrugs off the light jacket he’s wearing over his t-shirt and hands it to John, “Leaving the best for last – it’s a good strategy on their part, but they’re wrong if they don’t think that I’m going to fucking destroy Dorian,”
John has also obsessively been watching youtube clips of the apparent “sister show” that accompanies the dancing series called ‘It Takes Two,’ in which they show clips of the dancers rehearsing or other dramatic events. These had revealed that Sherlock would be dancing to a type of dance called a jive, which was often synonymous with rock and roll. The song he’d picked this week, however, was a mystery as they never seemed to play it during Sherlock’s rehearsal clips.
Dammit Sherlock, you just had to leave me behind, didn't you, you stupid snarky, bastard. You'd better not be dead, you arse. John thought. Just as he thought of this he began to see a light in the distance. It was difficult to see through the raindrops crashing against his face and the wind blowing into his eyes. John had wondered how Sherlock had seen anything on their way to Mrs. Laurinston's tonight. Probably his robot eyes. John drove faster as he thought of what the idiot's smirk might look like if he heard him say that aloud. As John approached the fuzzy lights he realized it was a car and not just any car – a london cab. John couldn't see who was in it from this distance, but it must be something like three in the morning now and he couldn't think of any reason a London cab would be this far out into this particular road, especially the same such road John highly suspected Sherlock had been taken through.
! You're so hard-wired to do what society deems right that you don't even notice how much damage it's doing to your own boring little brain. 'I'm John Watson, I hurt no one and help every one who asks even if it's against my desires because that's what I've been programmed to do'!” Sherlock spat, “Yes, I can see now how between the two of us
He doesn’t realize what he’s said until she replies with, “Kinky, I like it, but there will be a child present, so probably best to go with something a little more socially acceptable.”
As Molly contemplates Sherlock’s ability to get in almost anywhere the show transitions to the celebrity interviews bit. Molly watches with rapt curiosity but she can hardly concentrate on the words of the other contestants as she waits for Sherlock’s turn on the screen. She’s incredibly nervous for him, her foot tapping impatiently and her mind thinking back on how worried she’d been before Sherlock had made his (admittedly touching, before the attempted murder bit happened) speech at John’s wedding and she chews on her thumbnail in apprehension. ‘
“John is hella pissed “because he thinks Sherlock is pulling another Janine” (he’s really just pissed cuz he’s jealous) and he’s like: Bruh I thought you learned!!
“Door’s open!” Sherlock calls down. He quickly picks up his discarded robe from earlier. He rushes into his room to quickly change from his pj’s to a fresh pair of pants and jeans. He leaves his t-shirt on along with his robe, though, and roughly tousles his curls, hoping he looks more like he’s not bothered with his looks rather than a debauched mess. He’s glad his jeans will do a better job of hiding his waning erection.
John smiles at him and shouts, as Jack makes his way over (mostly to annoy Dorian), “Kick his arse, Jack!”
“–John!” Sherlock finally found his voice, “No! John stay on him. I'm fine, I'm completely fine. The bullet missed. I-it hit the mirror!”
As he walked closer he noticed that Mary didn't seem to be paying attention to what her friends were saying. She had her eyes focused towards the entrance of the club, her neck straining to look above the crowd.
John sighed and moved away from the door, “Could we just get this over with, please?” He asked, sounding exasperated.
Suddenly, a dog barked out in the hallway and pushed his way in through the door. “Redbeard! Hi there, fellow, how are you today?” John asked the young service dog in training. John fussed over him and scratched just behind his ears.
John returned from the kitchen with two mugs of tea. Sherlock was sitting cross-legged on the floor when he came in, surrounded by serviette opera houses.
“Er, yeah,” John says, vaguely remembering what the women had told them when they’d slammed their way into the flat last weekend, “Didn’t they say he was probably dead?”
“Really?” Anthea did not look convinced. “As great as your last great idea? An exposé on two hundred and forty types of tobacco ash and how to use the knowledge to find out if people's partners who smoke are either planning to murder them or are having an affair?”
“Heyyy,” John answered nervously, “Yup, yeah, just... doing a little tidying up, you know, here and there.”
John suddenly stood up, throwing the paper at Sherlock's face. Sherlock flinched and in an instant John was running out the door. Sherlock finally reacted and he stood abruptly to run after him, raising his voice,
"Oh, detective, what are you talking about to entertain him?" Anderson, who heard Sherlock talking, couldn't help teasing the detective.
"John, I think you get used to, and you hear me play the violin will be more exciting." Sherlock said, approaching John, "And, you will be more more action." John has been close to the ears thin language.
His cell phone rang again, and he took it out and saw that it was Sherlock's text message. He walked to the police officer nearby and explained his identity. The lift finally reached the 12th floor, and John followed the police officer who brought him up to room 1230. He saw two plainclothes detectives outside the concierge.
"Anderson, he is just doing an experiment, forget it!" Lestrade said helplessly, pressing his forehead.
"Oh, Anderson, if you are gay, no, you will not use the sofa at home if you have sex with your wife, so can't you guarantee that the deceased will not use the two-seater sofa that John now touches? And, John, I suggest you not If you touch it again, if you touch it down, you will touch the place where the semen is stained."
"Fuck you, you high-powered anti-social bastard, Lestrade, he wanted to murder me!" Anderson said while rubbing the chin that was pinched by Sherlock just now, pointing at the innocent detective.
Listen I was tempted not to post this short chapter and force you guys to wait until I’m done with the next one and possibly let you believe for a while that I was just going to leave Sherlock and John apart for months while I went on with my life but I found that I couldn’t do that to you. This chapter is really short but I don’t want it paired with the next chapter and you’ll see why when it’s finished. For now, enjoy John’s stupidity.
Sherlock’s eyes widen and his mouth seems to struggle for a response. John interprets for Rosie, “Remember the video I sent you? I think she thought she was actually dancing with you.”
father's tuxedo.” Harry said, then, finally looking at John and smiling excitedly as she turned towards the mirror, “Well,” she shrugged, “Parts of it.”
Harry giggled again, knowing full well what Len had wanted to say. That's when John saw her little white hat, pinned to her hair with clips, one beautiful pink flower on the side. Pink like the roses decorating the entire church and like the dresses of the bridesmaids he and his mother had seen clamouring around the limousine where the bride waited to make her entrance. Pink like Len's pocket square! Standing there, looking at Harry's flower and his cousin in distress, John got a rather brilliant idea.
When the bartender turned to get their drinks Sherlock crowded in a little closer to John and whispered, his lips breathing into the shell of John's ear, “John, I'm going to give people the impression that I'm terribly drunk, I've been taking drinks from the bar throughout the night to help me with the charade– what I need you to do is to keep an eye on the door in the meantime, but you must also pretend to drink. Perhaps order something stronger after the scotch and take the occasional sip. If you notice someone leaving signal me. I'll let you know if we should worry about them or not. Try to look relaxed. Now, do you still have your gun?”
Mary nodded, “I'll be awaiting the moment with great anticipation.” She promised bowing and making her way into the church.
“Hmm?” Sherlock asked distractedly and startled John from his reverie. He said this as he checked Jennifer's coat pockets and inspected her items. White umbrella, pink kitty cat keychain attached to two keys and a little pink plastic container holding a phone charging cable. Sherlock put the umbrella away but kept the keys in his hand.
’ She types, taking pity on Watson but mostly so that  Sherlock won’t kill her when she passes him the phone back. It also serves to double down on the implication - because what else could she possibly mean? —
And so Sherlock is where he is now, going on the occasional case, babysitting Watson (either the adult or the toddler) and when they’re not around, exploring his feelings through song and learning about himself physically through sexual partners. All in all it isn’t a bad experience so far, at least apart from Eurus deducing his recent loss of 'virginity' in front of their entire family. It had been somewhat awkward for Sherlock. Mycroft had been scandalized while Mummy and daddy had been delighted for him. Eurus had laughed at Mycroft and called him a prude. Sherlock smiles. He’s promised to go see her tomorrow.
, should we really be–” John asked, standing now and looking at Sherlock. He was extremely confused. What the hell?
“John! How could you let this happen to me?!” She screeched, waving the London Journal in John's face and quoting angrily, “
He climbs the steps up to John’s old bedroom, which Sherlock has now re-decorated for the little girl with bright warm yellow walls, painted fluffy buzzing bees, a painting of the sky on the ceiling and a mobile of the solar system hanging over her white crib.
Thunder crashed in the night and the heavy rain fell as they drove back towards London on an almost invisible black, wet, and slippery road.
. Soon, an older couple joined them on the dance floor too, and then a few more people. Pretty quickly half the bar was up and dancing and singing along with Sherlock.
“... to the caterer's and I won't be able to make it, so I'm sending John with her instead, but please, join them.” She'd said.
“So you thought the logical thing to do was to introduce Irene to Molly.” John finishes for him, “The woman who constantly sends you flirty text messages and the woman who pined over you for years until Eurus…”
John raises a brow but says nothing. Weirdly enough, neither does Rosie. She seems to be staring at Irene suspiciously. Like father, like daughter.
Sherlock watches three dots appear on the screen in front of him as John begins typing out his reply. He finds he can’t contain the grin on his face as he waits for John’s reply. Irene clears her throat as Sherlock waits and he looks up to see her still sitting by her bag, arms crossed and an eyebrow raised.
The intercom buzzed then, and Mary's voice came through, “John! John, could you come here please?” She asked.
“Oh.” Sherlock comes to the realization that the statement is strange to John - that he has admitted that he’s asked for help with something (though he doesn’t know why John is surprised, he asks people for help all the time)- and he schools his face into a passive yet pleasant expression, “Yes, nothing serious,” and because he can’t resist the innuendo, knowing it’ll go completely over John’s head, “just thinking of putting up some shelves.”
Harry giggled through her cup of orange juice and John smirked along side her. Leonard turned to look at them in surprise at the sound “Oh, Johnny, I'm sorry.” He said, looking genuinely chastised, “Didn't realize you two were back there!”
“Now, now everyone, we all just need to take a deep breath and calm down.” Sherlock said, loudly and theatrically, moving his hands in a placating gesture to emphasize what he was saying. What was he doing? The whole bar could hear him!
“Oh, that’s not too bad. The middle is when they start to get good anyway,” she says, just as the screen goes dark after the current dancers have finished being critiqued.
Mrs. Laurinston answered the door for them and handed them each a towel. The men dried off as best they could and she ushered them over to the kitchen where there was a medium-sized round wooden table surrounded by six chairs, one of which was currently occupied by DI Carter, who was looking tired and nursing a cup of tea.
It was then that Dimock came over with a couple of torches, bringing them back to a serious tone. He handed one of the torches to Sherlock. Sherlock handed the umbrella to John and bent down to inspect the body. Dimock moved to stand next to John, out of the rain.
John looked up and shut his eyes in an understanding yet very disappointed frown, “Her dry-cleaning slip, of course.”
” As an afterthought, she adds, with a leer, “Unless you would prefer another indelicate suggestion?”
The telly is on and he looks at the screen curiously. A couple in brightly sequinned white and red outfits dances to a jolly beat. John smirks, Molly apparently enjoys watching pop dance shows. No surprise there.
