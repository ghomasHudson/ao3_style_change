“What gives you the right to say who I am?! Everything you are isn’t even truly yours! You’d be nothing without the serum. Just some nobody from Brooklyn,” shouted Tony.
Tony gulped. He would be alone with Piper for five days. That would be the longest the two had ever spent together alone.
“No, if you want to talk to me take off the mask,” said Steve. He wanted to see his face. Steve wanted to make sure this was real. He couldn't do that if the alpha's face was hidden from him.
By the time Bruce gets back just after sunset and there's still been no contact from Steve, Tony's starting to get the picture.
"Steve?" he calls, with an appropriate level of caution for sneaking up on a supersoldier. "You okay, bud?"
“Look,” he explains, because talking is what Tony does best, and if he’s the one who says it then at least he doesn’t have to hear it. “I figured we were done for good as soon as JARVIS told me he’d found Barnes, so everything since then has been a bonus. You don’t have to be sorry, and you definitely didn’t need to do all this. I’m not going to make a fuss.”
Steve’s there before he’s finished speaking, holding Tony against him, close and warm and very firm.
"I assure you, I have been the very soul of discretion, Sir," JARVIS answers, every fan in the room whirring just a bit faster to display his indignation.
without wanting to go public. As though he thought Tony wouldn’t be planning to hire a sky-writer and buy out all the front pages and do pretty much anything it takes to show that he also likes Steve. A lot a lot a lot.
Today, though, Steve’s made a start on his third punching bag and JARVIS says he’s not showing any signs of slowing down, so Tony thinks it’s probably time to interrupt.
, Tony can't actually imagine what else there is to say, and he definitely can't understand why Steve thought it was better to write it down rather than say it in person.
Thor looks confused, like he’s finally worked out that Tony isn’t enjoying this conversation topic but has yet to understand why. “Did I say something wrong?”
Steve apparently doesn’t pick up on his confusion, or at least doesn’t realise it’s entirely genuine, because he takes another step back and says, “Stop being obtuse, Tony. I know you regretted it.”
This time, Tony actually chokes on his coffee, long and hard enough that he has to raise a hand to fend off Thor’s well-meaning but most probably crippling attempts to pound him on the back.
Maybe those are his initials at the bottom of that blueprint. Maybe they're genuine, and Howard really did design the arm, but Steve doesn't, won't,
Or, no, it explains why Steve was angry and miserable, because only a soulless monster wouldn't be angry and miserable after their BFF comes back from the dead and tries to kill them. It
"They wanted me to build weapons for them. I refused, so they tortured me. When I didn't break, they threatened my friend. Did they use tactics like that with you?"
He was tempted to call Natasha, but he didn’t want to explain this. Steve didn’t want his friend to see him in this humiliating state. He’d rather work through it on his own.
Piper stared at him. He was right. And it was such an easily stated fact. They could never change where she came from. Even they stole her memories of it. He was a lot smarter than he looked. And a lot more intelligent than any other child she’d met before.
Steve stepped out of his studio, where he’d gone to escape the uselessness he felt in the lab. There he felt like a burden. But now, it was three in the morning, and he'd stared at a blank canvas for hours. Time for a change of scenery. Steve wasn't surprised when he saw Nat sitting in his kitchen. She preferred to appear at odd hours.
“I don’t want to waste time playing games with you. So, why should I trust you? I don’t wanna hear about all the degrees that make you qualified.”
“But as I looked out over that city nobody knew I was there nobody could see me. No one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come, anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you it's been my mantra ever since, right. To simply rule from behind the scenes, because the second you give evil a face you'll be liable. You hand the people a target."
“No,” said Steve. This wasn’t his home. It wouldn’t be right for him to invite Tony in. He folded his arms to stop himself from opening the window. Why was his omega so set on Tony?
Piper needed to know where Winter was. Her friend was gone without any explanation. She had to know if he was safe.
Winter pointed to her neck. She tensed as fingers touched the metal band strapped around her neck. Her first urge was to rip it off.
She called for her parents several times, before realizing they couldn't possibly hear her. And even if they did, would they answer?
They pulled up to a large metal gate. The pillars were overgrown with ivy. Tony got out of the car and opened the gates before pulling into the stone driveway. It was a giant stucco mansion. It was well maintained for not being lived in for over twenty years.
“Very good, Piper. Let’s with through some relaxation techniques and then you can go. Ok?” Piper nodded "Now, I want you to take a deep breath in and out."
They started packing up the few things Steve. They left some clothes there, knowing he might have to stay there after missions. The clothes he packed fit into one box. He placed his dress uniform in a garment bag. How quickly packing went reminded him how little he had. The most cumbersome things to pack were his painting each had to be carefully wrapped. Steve easily grabbed two boxes.
Steve woke up alone.  His was spread out in bed the blankets tossed messily around him. He found his way to the kitchen. Tony was working on some kind of homemade gun.
Steve realized his mistake. He quickly moved from his position atop the alpha. Lowering his posture to appear small and unthreatening. His shoulders hunched. A gentle hand caressed his face. It was impossible not to lean into purring happily. But did not the alpha's gaze, not wanting risk it appearing as a challenge to the alpha's authority. What if he didn't want him anymore? His chin was raised. As he gazed into those brown eyes his fears melted away.  Alpha touched their forehead together.
Bloom sighed. Piper wasn't connecting with her. The pup was suspicious of her from the start. Maybe George would have better luck getting through her.
Steve needed a few minutes to collect himself. He walked to the car. Phil followed behind him. They returned to the training base.
He took the empty seat beside her. She poured each of them a shot. The sharp liquid was needed to soothe the anxiety she felt coming here. It was hard, watching them get their hopes up when the new information meant so little. She sighed. These feelings were the negatives of having a family. Maybe it was a mercy that she was unable to create one of her own. Yet somehow she succeeded in building one connection, not of blood, something she never intended. That was why she felt so obligated to come there tell them whenever she found something, even the tiniest thing. See them in person. She pushed the glass toward Steve.
Tony moved closer, taking in the beautiful scene playing out before him. He wrapped an arm around Steve. The omega leaned into him, nuzzling him briefly before returning his attention to Piper. She pulled away yawning. Steve put her over his shoulder burped her. He set her between them.
Pepper wanted him to change in ways he couldn’t. She didn’t understand that he and Ironman were on in the same person. He managed to keep on good enough terms to still trust her with running his company.
Winter would give the man an hour. If Smith did not wake in that time, he’d put a bullet through the man’s head and forget whatever question he may have. Winter counted down the minutes. After fifty-nine minutes Smith woke up.
“I don’t like it. Something can happen for some inexplicable reason even though the process made it occur millions of times before without that result without reason. And then there’s your science. It's too cloudy.”
Steve maneuvered through the toys littering the room, shed his clothes and got into bed with his mate and pup.
“Rhodes first,” he said. He couldn’t tolerate Pepper’s nagging right now. Rhodes’ image appeared on the screen before him.
“You only dilated a half-centimeter since I last checked. If it continues to follow this pattern you’ll have seven hours left in your active labor.”
He was alone. Something he hadn't felt for some time. He touched the claim marking his neck. Steve, the man was probably furious and worried sick about him right now. Staying here wasn't an option. He got to his feet and found some old chain and looped it around his suit. Then began trudging through the snow. Only five miles. An old gas station came into view. He dropped the chains and went to a wooden Indian wearing a poncho, taking off and putting it on. He went to the phone booth. Did he even have change? He panted down his pockets and finding a dollar in quarters. Tony dialed in the number for his secure server.
Lena rolled her eyes Rumlow’s transparent attempt to try and dominate her. "Enjoy it while it last, Rumlow.”
She’d been locked in the room with the man for hours silently studying him. He hadn’t even flinched when she entered the room. Torture would be useless against him. A master was immune to the craft. He was more famously known as the Surgeon. The man had a talent for knowing the exact amount of pain a person could take before dying. She had seen his victims.
Never had he watched over someone so worthy of protection. When breakfast came, he brought her closer, hiding her from direct sight.
Tony stared at the beautiful picture below him. Those powerful legs were spread, for him, neck bared in submission. Omega began whimpering for him. He moved atop of the beautiful creature. Tony ran lapped at his omega’s neck slowly traveling down the omega’s stomach. He licked Steve arousal.
Steve nodded. Tony moved to the floor. He clung to the alpha. The blue light from Tony’s chest was a comfort. He gently traced the metal edges of the reactor. Sighing when Tony placed a soft kiss on his forehead.
This wasn't about money. God, Tony wished it were. It would be so much easier. The people who took Piper had no intentions of returning her. They wanted her for what she was. The only comfort they had was knowing they probably wouldn't kill her or do worse.
“It’s like calisthenics. You might have of missed a couple of things while doing time as a Capsicile,” said Tony.
“I’ll be back to check on you tomorrow morning,” he said and left, closing the door quietly behind him.
She touched her headphone. “Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab. I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you for your corporation,” she said to the baffled god.
"So, it's job being it with me! Mates are supposed to be there for each other," said Steve in an angry rush. Almost as if he’d been waiting for Tony, for anyone, to tell him he’d failed.
"What do you have in mind?" Normally, Clint would have been insulted by the notion of his bow not being good enough. He had eliminated plenty of people with it just fine.
"Not interested," he said. Again his gaze went to Steve he fully intended on being there to kiss him at midnight.
Tony kissed him on the cheek before striding back to their room. It would take ten to thirty minutes for the alpha to get ready. The elevator doors opened and Happy came in.
Steve focused on his breakfast. It was better than gossip news. Ever since the photo of him and Tony kissing was leaked after the Battle of New York, people tried to get more. They had no respect for personal space. The only thing that caught his attention was the renaming of War Machine to the Iron Patriot.
Such sincerity was refreshing. Most found his scent confusing too weak to be alpha or omega and too strong to beta. Steve and Natasha seemed fine with it.
“May the Lord in his kindness strengthen the consent you have declared before the Church and graciously bring to fulfillment his blessings within you. What God has joined, let no one put asunder. Let us bless the Lord.”
"I can understand why you wouldn't want to approach it. This whole thing hasn't been easy for either of us. We're both stressed."
Tony pulled a sheet off a piece of furniture, revealing a 40s jukebox. Upon Tony's touch the machine alight. And started flipping through the songs.
Steve’s curiosity peeked, and he took the folder. Tension spread through him when he saw a photo of the cube. He’d hoped never to see it again.
A safe scent touched her nose and instinct forced her to follow it. She crashed into another prison containing a metal-armed alpha. Heavy footsteps came down behind her. She hid behind the large sleeping alpha. Hoping her chances were better with him than with them.
He untapped the bubble wrap. A watercolor image of a castle surrounded by yellow and red forest. The second was a forest mountain landscape in fall. A mother bear and her two cubs could be seen heading into the shelter in the woods. The initials SGR was written in the corner.
It was wholly insufficient that he still couldn’t help his own family. The calm of Steve's voice served to irate him further. So much so he did not notice distress leaking off his mate or the frustration in his posture.
“Don't look so sad, Steve. I've lived a long fulfilling life. I only wish you’d had the chance to do the same, but perhaps this it,” said Peggy.
“I won't be alone for long. All I have to do is open the door." Tony said, playing down the risk. His stealth armor's defensive measures were weaker than his other suits, to make it lighter and quieter. It could survive the average machine gun, but would have difficulty handling antitank weaponry.
Steve hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck. His arousal was brought to a sudden halt. He wanted to disappear.
At eight in the morning, Natasha woke. From the top bunk, she saw Steve asleep on the floor. He was moaning slightly in his sleep. Someone was having a very good dream.
He ran his hand down Steve's back. The omega arched into his touch purring. Steve smirked. Tony shivered. He had only seen it once before he'd seen that gesture. Tony never thought he would see it out of Steve’s feral heat state.
Steve leaned against the boxing ring beside Barny. He noticed the large blueberry muffin in Barny's hand. The beta always brought him sweets that were far better than anything served in the cafeteria.
, he wasn’t going to be ruled by such instincts! That wasn’t him. He huddled up on the large love seat. Steve was staring at his most recent painting. It was unsettling. He stood up after a minute, and walk to it. The paint was still wet. His hand moved to his stomach. He didn’t want to work on it. Steve didn’t even want to see it. He put it on a shelf, then curled up in the love seat again, pulling a blanket over himself.
“Since the end of the Fujimori regime, they’ve worked to end government corruption, while keeping up a good economy. They’ve done well, but there are still a few officials they haven’t been able to remove from power yet,” said Natasha.
Even going with the pup wouldn’t guarantee her safety. Not when Lena could order him to just stand aside and watch the pup endure some kind of torture.
Rune was shocked. What did it matter what happened once she left? It was nice being with her while it lasted. And he would hang onto that memory for as long as he could.
Through her interactions with Piper, she’d have the girl believe there was a chance to escape a reason for hope. Hope, she could manipulate.
He did know if it was the recent orgasm, but he somehow felt relieved. A weight had lifted from his shoulders, and he was calm. He hoped it wasn't a post-sex haze of bliss. They nuzzled. Tony led him into the shower. As they bathed they exchanged gentle kisses. They changed into a clean pair of pants. Piper was asleep. She would be out a little longer.
They made it to the tower, entering through the back entrance.  A swarm of people was gathered at the front of the tower. Bruce sat up from the back seat.
“I know. She’s smart. Too smart for her own good. But I can’t see her doing this unless she was forced,” said Steve.
Edith moved between the omega's legs. Steve bared his teeth a snarled, snapping his jaws. He kicked away from the woman. She was quick enough to avoid the attack. A deep rumbling growl from low in his throat echoed through the room. Everyone stepped back.
“Shh, you wouldn’t want to wake her.” Rumlow studied the two in disbelief. “The crazy bitch was right. I didn’t know you liked them so young.”
Steve groaned. When he felt his arousal returning swiftly, it had only been ten minutes. He nudged the sleeping alpha awake. Alpha grunted, asking already. Steve nodded. Alpha’s body was already responding to the change in his scent. He rolled onto his stomach, spreading his legs. Steve purred at the feeling of Alpha’s weight atop of him. His legs were placed on the alpha’s shoulders. He arched at the new level of deepness. Hitting a wonderful place within him. His nails dug into Tony’s back as he resumed a brutal pace, targeting that place inside that made his toes curl. He came swiftly, his alpha following closely behind him.
“An old girlfriend?” said Steve. He encountered too many of his husband's bedmates. None were a threat to what he had. They were an annoyance. It would be the same with this woman.
Clint woke in a state of confusion as he regained control over his body for the first days. He was in control. For a brief moment, it felt wrong. Natasha sat by his side.
The first week of a newborn's life was spent solely with its direct family so the pup would grow accustomed to the pack's scent.
He walked the private plot. Two regal black headstones stood at the center. He brushed away the leaves and twigs that had built up there. No one has visited here in years. He placed his hand on the cold black marble, before taking a seat in the grass. It read:
"It can be used in the treatment of diseases. There's less chance of rejection if it's taken from you,” said Edith.
With all that happened, she hadn't been able to focus on them in a while. That painful longing returned, like hit. She sniffled, trying to force back the tears. Winter didn't like crying.
Normally Play Mart was saved for his birthday or some other special day. It was a giant indoor playground unlike anything else. There was a whole section of the building dedicated to trampolines.
"Are you under the impression I'm enjoying this?" said Tony trying to look up from the odd position.
It would be a few days until her subjects were fully recovered. There were fifteen fractures between them.
Tony shivered against him tightening his hold around his omega as he came a second time. His knot deflated. Steve whined as he pulled out. A mixture of cum and slick leaked from between Steve’s leg. Tony wiped the mess with the bedsheet. He would have to rebuild Steve’s nest and give him fresh bedding. He wasn’t sleeping in this, but now he was exhausted. All he wanted to do cuddle with his omega and sleep until he was needed again.
“We’ll be landing soon. Rhodes, you'll find your own ride the rest of the way home,” said Tony. The jet landed minutes later. Happy was already waiting for Tony. He got into the car.
Helmut never mentioned that when he talked about her over the phone. Why was she working at some child's playground? She was sure a rich husband or even wife would happily take her as a mistress and treat her wonderfully.
She went to the basement, taking out several tubs of legos with blue, gray, and white coloration from the closet. Among the blocks were also penguins, polar bears, and seals. She'd also taken out Elsa's castle set.
Steve sighed. He didn't want to bring up anything that would disturb Piper. "We don't know, sweetie."
They would have to find a child physiologist to unpack the damage inflicted. He forced down the anger that stirred at that thought. A small whine caught their attention as Piper stirred.
“He’s a strong man he’ll wake up from this.” Steve squeezed the alpha's hand. Words weren't the comfort his alpha needed. He yawned. His body urged him to sleep. The closer he grew to his due the more exhausted him became.
Tony watched from the bar as Steve struggled to find a comfortable position. He gulped down his drink and went to join him. He put Steve’s feet on his lap. The omega moaned when he rubbed his feet. Even though Steve looked more relaxed, the omega seemed uncomfortable.
Tony followed Steve’s directions to a small diner. It had a sixties theme. Steve walked toward the back that looked out on the road.
She gathered herself before entering the building. Happy screams and the laughter of children reverberated through a massive playground, different activity centers wove through the entire space.
“I will be, but I won’t be able to help Rune until I’ve truly gained Piper’s trust. Their relationship is dependent. For now, I’ll talk to Piper. Then once she’s comfortable, I’ll include Rune in a few sessions with her. After that, I’ll talk to him individually and will eventually find him his own doctor.”
Happy took his leave. Some of the rigidity left his shoulders with Happy's absence. Tony unpacked the groceries and put them in the fridge. The alpha part of him was perfectly pleased with the idea of taking Steve as Pepper’s replacement. It was clear, which was better. This was a temporary arrangement. The week was bound to be unforgettable.
Steve woke up first, glaring at the clock on the table. It was four in the morning. He moved his head from his pillow, wiping the drool from his chin. He could go for a run, shower and start on breakfast. He changed into gym shorts. A few laps around the estate would be enough.
Steve felt the slight dip in the mattress as the alpha took a seat on the edge of the bed. The smell of his favorite comfort food was not enough to get him out of bed.
Piper lay on the floor working on her latest drawing. Rune worked beside her. She and Rune had hardly any supervision during art class lately. Piper was worried for her friend the only time he seemed to relax was when he was with her. It was due to Sir’s appearance.
"Let's follow the Hulk idea. He's a beta. Fits of rage aren’t often associated with betas. Banner is male, though, so that makes up for it, slightly. If he were alpha, he'd be more openly accepted. But let's say Dr. Banner was an omega female, alphas would despise her because they fear an omega with such power. There's no beauty to such a beast, she said.
Piper gulped, cautiously approaching the alpha and taking a breath before she nudged him; jumping away before he fully woke up. He looked at the tray. The alpha's stomach growled.
"Jarvis pull up any scientists who were working on this sort of prostheses. Anyone from the late to mid-'40s to today."
Tony followed him into the birthing room. The alpha gently rubbed lotion into his skin. Then towel-dried his hair. He smiled. In his time he'd be the luckiest omega in his apartment building having such an attentive alpha. All the omegas would have been jealous. Seventy years ago Tony would have been kicked out of the room and he'd be left to go through this alone.
“I would have loved to see that,” said Steve. He on the bike. Tony handed him a red full-face helmet. “Anything I should know about it?"
“We are in Manhattan, New York on 200 Park Avenue. In the penthouse of my building." Basic information seemed to help Steve. “It’s December tenth, 10:30 pm."
“Caught me up on the Howling Commandos what they did after the war. Her life family and a few stories about you. Your baby pictures were extremely cute-
Emergency services came rushing to the destruction. Reporters would be there soon. Paramedics hurried around him and Maya. He wasn't letting the woman out of his sight. He was currently being looked over in the back of an ambulance.
The tiredness in Steve's voice was apparent. It was so tempting to fly back home now. Steve would be resistant against even in heat. "How are you feeling?"
The alpha smiled. He took the clothes and changed. The alpha watched his every motion. He sat next to his mate.
Vanuatu is a South Pacific Ocean nation made up of roughly 80 islands that stretch 1,300 kilometers. The islands offer scuba diving at coral reefs, underwater caverns, and wrecks such as the WWII-era troopship SS President Coolidge. Harborside Port Vila, the nation’s capital and economic center, is on the island of Efate. The city is home to the Vanuatu National Museum, which explores the nation’s Melanesian culture.
Not much described the room perfectly. There was a small kitchen nook with cheap tile flooring, which led to a small living area. The living area was converted into a studio. It smelled of oil paints. There were twenty paintings of varying sizes. Half of them contained a train. Tony took a close look at the paintings. The strokes of the brush could be seen in the work, heavy and aggressive, but some were saddened and calm in their motion. The paint was heavily layered. Most of the works were painted in cool tones, but three of them were in warm colors. Some were obvious in their meanings, others were abstract in their true meanings. One of the more obvious featured a red skull melting away into a black background. Steve was showing him something intimate.
Tony instantly went to bed, out as soon as his head hit the pillow. Around eight he relieved Bruce of nanny duty. As soon as Bruce left the crying started up again. The quiet was nice when it lasted.
“A guilty pleasure,” she admitted. Natasha loved watching the reality TV shows. How ridiculous they were never made her smirk. It somehow made her feel better about her own life. She watched Say Yes to the Dress for a different reason; it was something she could never have. She would never have that moment.
Her project was to design a bomb. She had full freedom in the design. The only requirement was she couldn't use metal components. Everything was mostly made of plastic and rubber. Doing this was bad. She knew people could and would likely get hurt. But she wasn't the one activating or ordering its production. She was just doing as told. Daddy did the same thing. He sold weapons before being Ironman. Daddy couldn't control what the buyer of his weapons did.
Barnes accepts her hand, though he stands up under his own power. Like Sam said, it’s better not to argue with Natalia.
"Okay," he agrees; chair-bound as she is, she can't actually go anywhere, and the nurses have told him it'll cause her less unhappiness to play along than to tell her that there's now someone else living in whichever of her past houses she considers home. "I'll let one of the nurses know when I leave."
Tony went into the bedroom. He settled in bed, waiting for Steve. In bed by 11:30 pm, that was a first. Steve came out closet shirtless dressed in flannel pajama pants. His gaze instantly went to Steve’s necklace than traveled lower. How he wished to mark that beautiful neck with his claim. His teeth lengthened with the urge, but he forced it down.
The session ended an hour later on a peaceful note that didn't leave Steve's scent bitter. Steve went to his apartment. He kept in case he needed to stay over after a mission. Steve changed into his gym clothes. An afternoon run to burn off some of his excitement sounded like a good idea.
Steve winced as he took a breath. He was lucky the shattered ribs hadn’t punctured anything vital. It would take weeks for the fragments to mend. Tony sat at his side fidgeting with his phone. Steve knew he wasn’t just playing around. He was likely working on some sort of program to find their daughter. The door opened and Natasha came in.
“A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might be the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula,” said Phil.
"I loved hearing how deeply you were enjoying yourself." Everyone in their vicinity would know Steve was his.
Natasha stood in a S.H.I.E.L.D black site interrogation room. She had been called in to take over a particularly difficult interrogation. They’d been looking for this man since the Cold War. An old man with thinning white hair and pale gray eyes stared back at her.
“She was whenever I had a bad day she made my favorite food no matter how tired she was. An amazing woman. What about your mom?” he asked.
A man dressed in rags approached him. Steve instantly straightened. The elderly man. He instantly recognized the army tattoo on the man's forearm.
Fury paused at the door. "I almost forgot." He pulled a letter from his pocket, handing it to Steve. "Howard wanted you to have this. He was sure you'd come back."
Tony trusted Steve in this state with Piper. The feral side first objective bonding and caring about their pup. Tony sighed. Fuck, he trusted this side Steve more than in control Steve. The way Steve had acted today had him on edge. He'd never hurt Piper.
Steve calmed and began to work. Tony could help be surprised. The omega’s hands were steady while they worked. Pepper shook the first time they did this and nearly killed him in the process. He had a clear view of Steve’s focused expression. His heart race and the monitor showed it.
"Run the face from the surveillance through recognition and buy those photos before they get printed," said Tony.
The vice president in this story won't be Joe Biden. He'll be taking over for the other guy after Mandarin story arc.
“Natasha, no. I'm grateful the option is open to me, but I want my baby." No matter how terrifying the prospects of raising a child were.
Piper went to the lab. Parts of whatever Daddy was working on cluttered the worktables and floor, but the small square of space for Uncle Bruce was tidy. Uncle Bruce was asleep on the couch. There were dark circles under his eyes, and his face was all scruffy. His beard was white even though his hair was still pretty dark. All the adults were so exhausted. There was a thick report in his hand. The author was Helen Cho.
Tony went to the garage and took the bottle of pills out. He put them in his pocket and went to the penthouse. When he got there he found Steve rifling through the cabinets, searching for something.
Tony pulled back the blanket. Steve whined, yanking the blanket back over his head. Tony tugged it back down again, earning a near-death level glare. Before Steve had the chance to scold him, he stuffed a sandwich in his mouth.
“And you aren’t scared? One can shoot lighting from his fingertips and has super strength. The other has an IQ off the chart for her age range and can lift up to fifty times her weight," said Tony.
She opened her mouth, taking a spoonful. Her hands weren’t steady enough to feed herself. He had her finish an entire tray before he ate. The pup was silent as he ate, but she'd regained some color.
“I set up college funds for the children of the two soldiers that had families. The other was so young he hadn’t even started one. I made sure his mother was taken care of. Paying college funds and medical bills was easier than confronting them,” he said.
Around one in the morning, he was able to fall asleep. Three hours later Piper's screaming woke him up. Jarvis instantly turned on the lights. His eyes stung as they adjusted. He searched for any signs that would have caused her to make such a sound. She seemed okay, dry diaper.
Sir's underlings led him to the solitary confinement cells and pushed into a room. His back hit the wall. The cell was so narrow that it didn't allow him to stretch his arms to their full length. He pressed his hands against the metal door. That's as far his rebellious action went. There was nothing he could do.
The elevator stopped on the lab floor. Tony was asleep at his desk. If he was going to sleep in the lab he should make an effort to get to the couch. Steve easily lifted the sleeping man bridal style, accidentally knocking a stack of paper to the ground. Thankfully, the alpha didn’t wake. He set Tony on the couch, pulling a blanket over him. He placed a gentle kiss on his forehead.
At one in the morning, Natasha's jet landed. Hill and Clint were waiting on the airstrip. They all loaded into a car and headed to Avenger Tower.
"A drink sounds good, Tony," Steve interrupts, stepping aside so that Tony can unlock the door and wave him in.
"Okay," Steve finally manages. "Sam and I have cased the last place JARVIS sent coordinates for, and it's a lot bigger than we'd anticipated. You gotta know, I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't have to, but I think we're gonna need backup on this one. I thought- I was hoping you might ask Colonel Rhodes if he could assist."
“Yeah, let ‘em in,” he answers; the only person on the premises he has absolutely no desire to see is the Soldier, and since he showed no inclination at all to leave Steve’s floor when Tony left him there, he’s probably not likely to come visiting now. Similarly, the only person Tony particularly wants to see is the one person he’s trying very hard to resign himself to not seeing any time soon, so he doesn’t actually bother looking up.
Steve drifts on the edge of consciousness, more relaxed than he's been in a long time. After months of lumpy mattresses in uncomfortable motel rooms or hostel dormitories, even a cheap hotel would be a luxury, and the place Tony has picked is a long, long way from being a cheap hotel. The bathroom is beyond opulent, the air-conditioning has the room at the perfect temperature, and the bed is the largest Steve has ever seen and every bit as comfortable as those back in the Tower.
The jet can't land here. Even with the vertical take-off and landing system Tony designed, the roof isn't large enough (or sufficiently reinforced) for it, nor has Steve seen any handy vacant lots in the vicinity. "Where's the jet going to land?"
Either way, he's not comfortable discussing the possibility with Pepper, for reasons that have very little to do with his uncertainty and everything to do with her past relationship with Tony.
"What is it?" Steve's well aware that he sounds much too eager, so there's really no need for Sam to be giving him his
Even without the comms, Hulk's next roar is readily audible. Tony mentally debates going over to help with Operation: Retrieve Bruce, decides he's not actually that nice (after all, Steve dumped him for his murderer ex, so he deserves at least one solo Hulk wrangling mission), and then decides since Wilson isn't moving he's not going to either.
know, but the speed with which Stark continues speaking suggests it's probably a rhetorical question.
“God, I wish I had your superpowers,” Sam mutters once he’s gone, taking a second bottle from the cupboard under the sink and filling it from the tap.
Steve shrugs, not about to tell Bucky that he and Tony have talked about a whole host of things but not this. Not about them, because Steve would rather have what he knows Tony is prepared to give him than to push for more and wind up with nothing.
Clint crosses to it quickly, surveying the collection of belongings the Hydra goons took from him while he was unconscious. His phone is in pieces, and the meagre amount of cash that was in his wallet is missing (seriously, he can't have had more than six bucks in there, and the fact that some prick decided to take it is even more annoying than the way they got the jump on him), but his hearing aids are still there, undamaged, and Clint breathes a metaphorical sigh of relief as he puts them back in again; he can and does go without them when he's at home, safe, but right now he'd like to have a warning if the asshats who attacked him come back.
Steve plays that back again, trying to turn it into actual words, but there's a reason he wound up on the front lines rather than in a bunker somewhere: battlefront tactics, yes, advanced code-breaking, no.
“No,” Bucky interrupts, though he’s a little less emotional, now that he’s clearly got his point across. “You really didn’t, did you? Way to break a guy’s heart.”
“Not really,” Clint says, shaking his head. “Accepted a beer when I offered him one, but that’s about it.”
"My apologies, Captain Rogers," JARVIS answers calmly. Unfortunately, since he's always calm, this isn't overly reassuring, and it becomes even less so when he continues with, "I am contacting you at Sir's request, however."
Finally, Tony seems to get how important this conversation is, or so the absence of flippant remarks suggests. "Bucky," he repeats, sitting up completely, then, "Little light, JARVIS."
“Oh,” Thor says, immediately dejected. “Heimdall told me all was once more well between yourself and the captain. It saddens me to hear that isn’t so.”
way, thank god. No, she recognises him as Tony Stark, here to visit Former SHIELD Director Margaret Carter in her high security, former-agents-only retirement home.
The asset takes two tentative steps out of his bedroom, then pauses again. There’s still nothing, and so he continues his cautious walk in the direction of the elevator.
, Tony thinks, not entirely unaffectionately, as he exits the elevator and heads into the team kitchen.
Because he’s hands down the best person any of them have ever met, JARVIS has seen fit to keep the elevator (and therefore Tony) waiting for him, and Steve steps inside just before the doors close.
Tony scoffs, reaching for another mug, this time finding an inch of coffee at the bottom, thank god. "Don't lie, everyone knows you love me, Bruce."
Abruptly, Sam feels like a dick. After months of listening to Steve talking about Bucky-this and Bucky-that, and then the way he reacted to Steve calling him Bucky, it hadn’t even occurred to Sam to ask, and he should have done. He absolutely should have done. Yeah, he’s been calling the guy Barnes, but he never asked, just assumed he’d be uncomfortable with a stranger calling him Bucky. After all the training he’s had (admittedly none of it in helping people with the level of trauma Barnes has, but that’s neither here nor there), Sam should have known better than to assume.
“I…” Steve starts, then has to stop, because, honestly, it hadn’t even crossed his mind that Tony might think he and Bucky used to be together. He understands why Sam made that assumption, because they didn’t know each other so well when Bucky cropped back up, and Steve can, in hindsight, see how his reaction to discovering Bucky was alive might seem a little more than friendly, but Tony?
“Yeah,” Tony agrees, brushing a kiss to Steve’s lips, as light and teasing as the one he started out with. “Unless you will. Regret it, I mean. You’ve got Barnes back now, after all.”
face (and, hey, at least in this case Tony knows it's not just some line to wring a confession out of him; if Bruce was angry, they'd all know about it). "So…?"
“Yeah, I get that,” he says, pausing for a long moment. “I'm not asking you to, I promise, but… He asked after you, Tash. Seemed pretty worried that you weren’t around.”
"Zola," Steve explains, in as much as a few barely polysyllabic words can count as an explanation. "Russians, Zola again. Hydra. It's- Nat found a file, Tony, it's-" He falters, sucking in a breath that sounds awfully like a sob (it feels that way, too, and Steve's not absolutely sure it isn't one). "The things they did to him, I can't…"
No doubt, Sir's unhappiness will continue past that point, because Captain Rogers frequently displays the same poor communication skills Sir does, but physical proximity should at least get them slightly closer to fixing things.
Tony shrugs; now that he's told them Steve's looking for Barnes, Clint and Bruce know just as much about the search as he does. Frankly, the fact that the search is happening is more than Tony wants to know, and he is not prepared to stick around listening to them speculate. "How the hell would I know?"
There is absolutely nothing Tony can say to this that he hasn't already said. Yeah, he'd like an explanation, some indication of why Steve's spent months calling him only to give up entirely after they slept together, but he's not going to get one, and he's not reaching out only to be disappointed again.
"I understand, Sir," he answers eventually, which of course he damn well does; JARVIS is omniscient enough to make God Himself seem ignorant, so there's no doubt he's understanding things that even Tony doesn't realise he's thinking. "Do you wish me to stop assisting Captain Rogers?"
Still, he’s got a slightly more pressing Steve problem to deal with, namely the fact that the man is jittery as hell and getting more so with every second. “Chill, man,” Sam instructs. “We’re trying not to freak the guy out, remember?”
Steve tries calling him almost a dozen times in the half hour after JARVIS announces he's opened the email.
with people thinking of him that way. He hasn’t killed anyone since rescuing Clint from Hydra, and he’s not intending on it any time soon, definitely not under orders. He’s no one’s asset, not now and not ever again.
“One of the rival weapons company. They took up the military contracts my company held. There is work mid grade better than the shit Hammer produced,” said Tony.
“This is fine,” said Natasha. She closed the door behind the agent. “Do you want top or bottom bunk?”
Tony sat next to him. Steve pulled his head from the toilet. Tony offered him water, he managed a few sips.
It had been ages, but it didn’t matter. Things like sex seemed to have lost all importance in the grand scheme.
Maria gulped. Piper could not see the heartbroken glares her innocent actions had just earned Maria.
“Go on,” said Piper. She didn’t want to be the only one talking. Rune shook his head. “The people in here you can trust, promise.”
The alpha was stunned. He never thought he'd see the man again after Stark paid him off. Especially not after discovering who he really was.
"I doubt she'll talk during the first meeting. If she doesn't like Bloom, we'll try the other doctor," said Steve.
"I don't think she can wait."  He was barely managing to hold her. She was using her advanced strength against him to get to Steve. "Give her enough to calm down."
Hours later he returned from his run through Central Park. Nothing was out of place in the penthouse. Tony still hadn't emerged.
“Not a word. I doubt he will. Men like him don't talk easily. And when they do, it's rarely useful,” said Natasha.
Piper blinked she remembered. The first time she entered that state she had no memory of what happened. Never was it this clear. She was gaining some semblance of control over it. Piper hadn’t done anything to learn how to control that power. It could have been an outlying incident. Even if it was an outlier it's existing leaned toward her gaining control.
The pup crawled out of bed dragging the blankets with her. She climbed into his lap, huddling closely to him. The pup hid her face in his chest. He wrapped her in the blankets, cradling her in his functioning arm.
“It takes 4,000 newtons of force. Who or whatever did will be exhausted asleep for days,” said Ballentine.
“This is pretty straight forward. I don’t see why we need your assistance. My people can handle this,” said Neema.
“I don’t know about that but it is powered by the cube. And I’d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys,” said Fury.
“The only time you’ll see me in these in your fantasies,” said Steve, tucking them back in the drawer.
A soft non-threatening noise forced his attention; the pup was baring her teeth. She met his gaze. Her blue eyes pulled at something unknown inside him. The intense, yet gentle gaze elicited a level of familiarity from the usual blankness of his mind. Winter’s head spun and he fought the temptation to slam his skull into the wall and knock himself out. Winter clutched his head. He needed it to stop.
"No.” Natasha replied firmly. “And it stays that way until we reach New York. We won't be able to stop them from killing him."
They were lead to a room with two massage tables. Steve turned away as Natasha disrobed and wrapped a towel around herself before laying on the table.
Rune yawned loudly and rubbed his eyes sleepily. The pup allowed Pepper to pick him up. He rested his head on her shoulder.
Piper glared at the woman. She wanted to finish that problem. Now it would be stuck in her head all day and she wouldn’t have any way of writing it out.
Steve agilely folded into the car. Tony drank in the image. Steve pulled off the lumberjack look perfectly. His attention went to the iconic shield. Long jagged claw marks cut through paint, but the metal was undamaged. A new paint job was easy enough. He started up the engine, pulling away from the S.H.I.E.L.D facility as quickly as possible.
Ever since Piper could string together a sentence she questioned everything. Sometimes even Tony didn't have the answer to her questions. He found himself brushing up on random facts just in case he needed to answer some off-hand question. He glanced at his mate. Steve was staring blankly in the direction of Piper's room.
Their short vacation went wonderfully. They were on their flight home. It was filled with great food and amazing sex. Steve hadn’t been able to build up the courage to ask Tony about their future. There was one it was just the fact of figuring out what it entailed. He could face enemy troop and giant radioactive bears, but this was so much more difficult.
"No, Steve, both of you look terrible. Piper will be fine for a few hours. If that changes, we'll get you."
"We will always accept you. We can be very kind as long as you accept us, in return." Lena’s voice was soft but firm, open … honest.
Isn't that what vice presidents were for. He could care less about the president. All that matter to him was his family.
looks. Tony opens his mouth to come clean about him and Steve at least half a dozen times, if only because it'd be nice to talk through what the hell he should say to Steve when he sees him, but chickens out every time. It's just- if he and Steve don't work things out, he'd rather not have yet another failed relationship be public knowledge.
Tony hmphs, not because he’s denying that bringing back Barnes was difficult (it was, even if it was also one of the most straightforward decisions he’s ever made) but because Steve’s intensity is too much, far too much.
, Clint thinks, turning to the two people in the room who don't seem to have gone completely insane since the last time he saw them. Unfortunately, they both look just as confused as Clint feels, so his silent plea for an explanation goes unanswered.
Reliable intel, Maria thinks, is a lot harder to come by now that she's working for Stark rather than SHIELD. For one thing, her team is a lot smaller; Pepper may have spearheaded the recruitment of as many trustworthy former-SHIELD personnel as possible, but after discovering half your coworkers are part of an evil secret club, trust isn't particularly easy to come by. For another, although the hardware and software they're working with is beyond state of the art, they no longer have quasi-legal access to every camera on the planet as and when they require it (or, if they do, Stark has neglected to share that little piece of hacking with her), which negates much of the advantage provided by reduced processing times.
Still, he passes Steve both glasses before joining him on the bed, sprawling out against the headboard and patting the mattress next to him. "I told you to make yourself comfortable, Cap," he says. "Balancing precariously is not comfortable. Plus, as nice as the view of you from behind is, it's much better when you stand up, so if you want t- Yep, that's exactly what I was talking about, if you could maybe bend over now as well, maybe wiggle a bit?"
“You’re not drinking that, right?” he asks, pointing at the coffee Tony prepared for him. It’s apparently a rhetorical question, though, because he picks the mug up before Tony can point this out and, still grinning, says, “If you’ll excuse me, I have an idiot to yell at.”
It’s only now that Tony realises how used he’s gotten to Barnes’ usual demeanour. Yes, he’s quieter than anyone Tony’s ever met, acts like facial expressions are something that happens to other people, and has a tendency to skulk in corners, but Tony no longer finds it alarming. It’s just who he is, the same way Steve is stubborn, Bruce is measured, Natasha is sneaky, and Clint refuses to sit on any kind of furniture in anything close to a conventional way.
“Come on, Stevie. Stark obviously thinks we used to fuck, and that’s why you’re hiding your thing with him from me. What the hell were you thinking?”
He turns his head, lips brushing against Steve’s throat, light enough that it could be an accident if that’s how Steve wants to see it.
Pepper rubs her temples in a futile attempt to dispel her budding Tony-headache. "I understand that, Tony," she says, with as much patience as she can muster. "But Fujikawa Industries are threatening to pull out of the deal I've spent the last six months working on if you aren't in on the meeting. Obviously, the world takes precedence, but if I find out that you're absent for any reason other than averting mass destruction then so help me God I will serve you your balls on a plate. Is that clear?"
"Forgot that Europe is in a different time zone?" Pepper asks, her annoyance now replaced by amusement at his expense. "For a genius, you aren't half stupid sometimes, Tony."
"All systems are working at their optimum level, I assure you," JARVIS argues; Tony gives the closest camera an
"If he's not told anyone so far, there's no way he'd answer us now," Pepper agrees sadly. "And I've no doubt you'd be just as reticent, wouldn't you, JARVIS?"
This was the second time he’d woken up alone. Tony sighed. He thought he was passed the point in his life of waking up alone. Tony got up. It was wrong being here without Steve. He was an invader in this room.
“He can’t say much. I was getting her hairbrush to test her DNA, so he can start processing it. How is she?” said Tony.
"They were obviously valuable to him." Steve turned a page. "I wish I had something like this. I don't have any family photos."
Mark 5 seemed to be opinion box for Piper. They unfolded the notes together, finally reaching the last note.
He made around fifty pancakes before sitting down at the counter. Steve dug in. His appetite didn’t disturb Tony.
“What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?” she said, backing up the stairs toward the exit.
Tony was working on at the table. Steve wrapped his arms around the alpha’s waist. He purred. Steve nuzzled his neck. Tony turned around kissed him. He pulled away and yawned.
“I’m not sure what else you have planned for today, but I could make you dinner,” said Steve. His mom taught him the fastest way to an alpha’s heart was through their stomach. It should apply to the genius inventor. Steve tensed when he didn’t get a response right away.
Days passed the same domestic bliss. Tony introduced Steve to his favorite movies, which included Star Wars. Steve watched them twice blown away by it. They dipped into the Lord of the Rings world since Steve was a fan of Tolkien. To Tony’s surprise, he didn’t get tired of it. He enjoyed it. They took turns cooking.
It was difficult leaving his alpha. His instincts screamed no that his place was by Alpha in their nest.
Steve cupped the alpha’s face in his hands. “I’ll try my best not to get injured. You have to trust in that."
"We've already done that once because of me. He won't be here much longer, and we're not taking Piper on a thirteen-hour flight to China."
That was inevitable. Only a matter of time. As soon as they deemed their training done he'd be erased. They wouldn't want to risk someone catching him and using his info on her.
Natasha perked up from her post by the window when a taxi pulled up in front of the house. Out came Lena Zemo with a small duffle bag. This was Nat’s first time seeing the woman in person. She looked tired. Oddly, she also looked slightly disappointed to be home. If she were trapped studying penguins for months at a time she should be relieved to be home.
"No trouble at all." Steve took a look in the pantry, finding several boxes of Kraft Mac and Cheese. “Jarvis is this safe for me to eat?” asked Steve.
“Got into a fight with my boyfriend I needed some space and got locked out on the roof,” said Steve.
Steve fell into a restless sleep. Waking an hour later in a cold sweat. Tony was asleep next to him. The alpha’s arms were wrapped around him. He carefully moved Tony’s arm from him. He took the shoebox from under the bed. Steve ran his fingers along one of the surfaces of the object but it wasn’t enough. He left the box on the bed. Before leaving he kissed Tony. Steve went to his newly built studio. He grabbed a 30x40 canvas and placed it on the isle.
Piper smiled. It was a nice break from the recent conversations they'd had. It was a pretty amazing shift over the generations. Simple beginnings lead to her.
Steve got breakfast ready and kissed Tony goodbye before he left for his lecture. Steve’s phone vibrated in his pocket.
The bedroom was shaped in a semicircle and painted dark gray. Its floors were made of dark wood. The wall in front of him was tall and made entirely of glass. It looked down on the city. He unpacked his things. At the center of the room was a bed. There were at least twenty pillows stacked on the bed. He neatly pilled them on the floor. He yawned the urge to sleep was too powerful to ignore. Steve got into bed. The sheets were soft against his skin. The softness of the bed wasn't suffocating. It cradled him comfortably. But he couldn't shake his insecurity. He gathered the decorative pillows off the floor and built a wall around him. Steve burrowed under the blankets, swiftly falling asleep.
"I need time with my patient. You barging into his room before he's ready will close him off to me. When I'm done with Captain Rogers, you may speak with him."
She wouldn't abandon him! Piper punched the crate, creating a massive dent in the metal framing. On the second hit, her fist punched through. A powerful wave of blue energy killed the guard.
She reached a S.H.I.E.L.D airstrip hours later. A jet was waiting for him, autopilot was set to the New York S.H.I.E.L.D facility. During the drive over, she had to update Fury on her progress. She took off her wig, letting lose her red hair. S.H.I.E.L.D satellites were already scanning Antarctica. She called Clint.
The omega was dazed, happily nuzzling against his neck. Tony used his discarded shirt to clean them. Those azure eyes could barely be seen from those large dilated pupils. He’d gone feral. Steve was comfortable with their nakedness. Tony kissed him.
“Shit!” growled Piper. She should have known it was a dummy program. There was no way Daddy that would allow such subpar programming to surround Jarvis.
“You’re stressed. What aren't you telling me?" The idea of his omega stressed and scared without him there, drew out his most protective alpha instincts.
He jumped from the couch in panic. His teeth bared and snarling. The kid was staring at him from the corner, tightly clutching a bag of supplies. The pup wasn't old enough to challenge such a display. His first instinct was just what he was doing fear. Tony lowered his stance. He wiped the sweat from his forehead.
"Ohpleaseno," is Tony's knee jerk reaction, which, he realises a split second too late, is probably exactly what Bruce wanted.
Steve allows himself two minutes to sit there, wallowing in self-pity, before forcing himself to get out of bed and into the shower, which is every bit as ridiculously luxurious as the rest of the hotel. He would have enjoyed it, he thinks, if Tony was here with him. They could have made a solid (though probably unsuccessful) attempt to use up all the hot water, and had a whole lot of fun in the process.
“So you won't do it for me, you won't do it for the world, and you won't do it to avenge your parents even though
self – knew the risks when he settled on New York. This city has more enhanced persons per capita than any other city in the world, and after three escapes from the mas-
Again, Tony's not fully sure he's okay with that, but he's willing to pretend for the sake of getting what he wants (Natasha's spent the whole time Tony's known her doing the exact same thing, so she hasn't got any grounds for complaint). "Scouts' honour," he says.
"Sir's recollection of the conversation is accurate, Doctor Banner," JARVIS confirms, his tone as calm and even as always, but for some reason he decides against stopping there. "However, I think perhaps the nuances may have escaped Sir's notice."
Pepper waits until he's helped himself to a few salmon nigiri and one of those daft little cups of hot sake before answering. "Bruce was just telling me about his afternoon in Barcelona," she explains.
“Yeah, I know he does,” Clint says. “But I thought it might be one of those childhood nicknames you spend your whole life trying to get away from, so I figured I’d give you the chance now. Is there something you’d prefer to be called?”
Today, he's very conscious of the fact that his suits aren't just armour, and most of the reason he feels so safe in it is that he can blast the crap out of anyone who might be a threat.
"Surprising as it may be, Sir has actually provided me with some guidelines regarding privacy," JARVIS confirms. "Without his permission, I am unable to provide you with any new information."
There isn’t a button for him to press, but that doesn’t seem important. The doors open after the asset has been stood there for a few seconds, and close again once he steps inside.
Still, Sam and Bucky both maintain it’s absolutely necessary, so he’s willing to make the effort, and if his handmade burgers are really too awful to eat they can just throw them out and order in.
Without him, the whole thing crosses the line from extravagant to excessive, and Steve doesn't linger, scrubbing roughly at his skin and foregoing shampoo on his wet hair.
Tony breathed in his omega's scent. There was a subtle change in Steve's scent adding to its sweetness. It was so soft he wasn't sure if he were imagining it.
Sleep came quickly to the couple. The next morning Steve woke up. His face was pressed to Tony's chest. He took a deep breath of the man's scent before getting up. His things were packed. Tony woke up a little later. He didn't kiss him like he had every other morning. Their breakfast was quiet. From the kitchen, they watched the sunrise.
