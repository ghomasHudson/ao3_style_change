Muircheartaigh leaned forward on his throne and hissed, “Did he tell you that he left Victor behind?  Brought him here and then ran, well,
“Fair enough.  How do you know about the killer?”
“Magnussen wasn’t supposed to be there. Sherlock said he inveigled Ms Hawkins into giving him Magnussen’s schedule, which is why she was pissed off at him. The whole story hangs together, but it doesn’t leave me much to go on.”
“Piss off,” replied John. There was no real venom in it. He was beginning to be hungry and a bit cold.
Sherlock exited his bedroom, carrying his overnight bag. “Case.  Lancashire.  I’ll be gone three days, perhaps four.”
John sighed. “All right, I’m on my way.  Uh, you might want to give Sherlock a chance to shower before he comes in.  It’s been a few days.”
“That was a ruse to gain more information – and it worked.”
“Nothing?  Yet you cohabited with her for three years.  She was carrying your child.”
made him shiver. He stripped as well, trying not to go too fast, trying to give Sherlock a bit of a show, and was rewarded by the sight of Sherlock’s erection jutting out beneath his baby bump.
Then before John could speak, Sherlock added quietly, a touch uncertainly, “I hope you would have.”
“Oh!  I see.”  The creature regarded Ivan thoughtfully.  “I may have misjudged.  The sword
“An enemy.”
your husband...”
John’s mobile trilled. “Hello?  Yes, Suzanne, I’m...  Oh, hell, I had no idea it was that late.  I’ll be right there.”  He tucked the mobile away.  “Harry, I have to get back to work.  Look, stay in touch.  Here’s my mobile number.  Keep me posted on... things.  Your tattoo.  And... everything.”
“And Sherlock.”
“You were pretending to be me, try to keep up. I told her that if she shot me – that is, you – the body would be found in a building with her face projected on the front of it. Even Scotland Yard could have got somewhere with that. I take it that the Yard doesn’t have photos of the actual projection?”
,” Sherlock said meditatively. “Can we try that first next time?”
“Good,” muttered John.
“That could be a long list, mate,” said Lestrade, but John ignored him, kept pacing – and then stopped.
After a moment, Sherlock admitted, “A bit.”
There was, eventually, a funeral, a small graveside affair arranged by Mycroft. John attended, because there was no one else really and because he’d loved her once.  Sherlock and Greg both showed up, although he’d asked neither of them and in fact hadn’t told them the date or time.  The location was obvious enough.  Mary was buried next to their daughter.  Whatever her real name had been, her gravestone read “Mary Morstan Watson, 1974-2016.”
“And exactly how bored
“You need some sleep, Sherlock, and I don’t mean on the sofa.  Take the bed.  I’ll fit better on the sofa than you will anyway.”
“Not if this person tries to shoot you again.”
Then he fled upstairs.
“Yes. Well. Come here.” John sank down into his armchair, pulling Sherlock into his lap as he went. It should have been awkward, but tall, bony Sherlock curled around John as if he’d been designed to fit there. His neck was at just the right height for John to nose. When John nipped where he’d been nosing, Sherlock gasped.
With a sigh, the... concierge?  The concierge pulled a device out of her pocket.  It looked like a blockier, clumsier version of the “cellular” phones that had been everywhere in Canada.  Fourteen years ago, they’d been unknown in Britain.  Only those who could afford it had even had landlines.
“No, but she is a relative newcomer to this university, and I am the senior researcher on this project. It is, as you say, my call.”
“And what’s that?”
He’d done forty years of a life sentence when the parole board released him into a world that neither knew nor cared who he was. Overnight, he went from being a prison celebrity to being no one at all.
Tyler raised his chin, his expression sullen. “He said they made his stomach hurt.”

“I see. Ask me about places I’ve travelled.”
away as fast as he could with Victor’s cries in his ears?”  The sorcerer settled back and stared at Ivan.  Then his tone changed completely, became light and flippant.  “And after all that, Sherlock didn’t even send a card when Victor died!  The man has no heart at all.  Of course, that was
It was only when Sherlock stared at him that John heard, in his own words, the absolute and unflinching declaration of allegiance.
“Long enough to open the bag and look inside?”
She giggled, shook her head and returned to the paper. “All the quotes are from her, none from Dexter... Oh, dear.”
“Delores said that your soulmate is everything you want
“Good, you’re here. We’re going out.”
John went out to the pub and managed not to let slip to Lestrade that Sherlock and Mary were spending the evening running quality assurance tests on illegal beta hormones. He did, however, think he ought to warn Lestrade that Sherlock had introduced himself to the betologist by telling her he’d got her name from “DI Lestrade.” This had immediately caused her to assume that the case Sherlock was working on was a Yard case. Sherlock had not corrected her assumptions.
Sherlock’s cock had decided to join the party.
interested in finding a beta? Did you ever intend to have children at all? Or were you planning to let the years pass and then blame bad luck? Certainly you were only driven to try to conceive when you realized that a pregnancy might be your last chance to hang on to John.”
.”  Sherlock was clearly trying to maintain a solemn face, but his eyes danced and the corners of his mouth twitched.
“Oooh,” quipped Mary, “Sounds like the sofa for you, John.”
“No, dear, but it’s easier for people here to say,” Marfa Hudovna replied composedly.  “My husband Boris was from this country.  Oh, he was a fine-looking man!  And when we first married, he treated me like a queen.  But after that nasty business with the Powers boy, Sherlock left the court, ah, his mother’s household.”  She shot Ivan a quick glance, as if to see if he’d noticed the slip.
“No, Sherlock. He’s a chemist, right?”
As Ivan ate, he mulled over the question of Sherlock’s loyalties.  It would be a great deal easier to trust the creature if Ivan knew what reason he might have for going against Muircheartaigh.
“And now you’ve had an extremely complete version of the explanation I promised you.  Marfa Hudovna has gone to prepare a bed for you.” Ivan looked about, surprised that the lady was indeed gone from the room, as Sherlock continued speaking.  “Good night, Ivan Watovich.”
Sherlock moved up. John leant forward.  He had no trouble seeing Sherlock now in the dim street light that filtered through the curtains.  “Hi there, handsome.”
“You would have left me!”
“Why wouldn’t he? Tyler, did Uncle Don say anything to you about skipping his medications?”
“I’m working tomorrow and the rest of the week,” said John.
John picked up the phone. “Hi, Greg?... Nope. To the best of my knowledge he’s not. How did he even get away with it the first... Oh! He only
“Mrs Antonelli,” Sherlock began, “We can’t find the murderer without sufficient information.”  His patience, never plentiful, was obviously beginning to fray.  “If you would just...”
John heard the driver clear his throat behind him.  When he turned, the man was holding the rear door of the car open.
And of course, oh,
“Marfa Hudovna, the way you say that...
God, it seemed unreal that they could both still be almost entirely dressed, even to their shoes, with their trousers and pants pulled down to leave them naked from waist to ankle. Sherlock deftly untied his own shoes and kicked them off.  Pants and trousers followed the shoes, and then Sherlock was kneeling at John’s feet, looking up through his lashes as he dealt with

“I’ll have breakfast ready when you get back, dear.”  She looked him up and down, then nodded.  “Luck be with you.”
“Sherlock, I’d like to apologize for what I said. Pregnancy and hormones...”
“Oh, man, the posh junky!” Nigel took control of conversation again.  “We were in the…  Where were we by then, mates?”
“I don’t know.  I am – or I was.  It’s been...  I don’t remember how long it’s been.”  Andreyev sighed and looked into the flames.  “She was beautiful, my wife.  Too beautiful, perhaps, for I was a clerk in a lord’s household and she caught the lord’s eye.  Still, we had no trouble until the murder.”
And there were, of course, exceptions to everything. “
?” Mary wrinkled her nose.
“I tried.  He wouldn’t listen to me.  Later on, he claimed that he’d had the same suspicions and had been waiting until a more propitious moment to act.  He wouldn’t say how many more deaths he was willing to accept before this ‘moment’ arrived.”
He heard his own voice crying out, a single word – a name? – but couldn’t make out what it was.  And then a different voice called...
John whipped it out.
“Oh?  What is?”
They kissed ravenously, tongues tangling, as if they hadn’t seen each other for weeks. John felt hyperaware of Sherlock’s sun-warmed autumn scent, of every inch of the bony body pressed against John’s, of the little whimpers and moans Sherlock made against John’s mouth. Sherlock’s hands seemed not to know where to settle. They roamed up and down John’s torso, touched but did not grasp his hips, reached ‘round to his arse all too briefly and then stroked up his back.
“Yes,” confirmed Sherlock. “Eventually Mr McKinsey tired sufficiently that the grandnephew was able to induce him to leave.  They began to walk home, but they were still quite near the university when Mr McKinsey suffered a heart attack.  His grandnephew called 999, but the paramedics were too late.  He died in an alley, alone except for the boy at his side.”
John’s smile was all teeth. “Not personally, no.” Then, like Sherlock, he ran down the stairs and headed out to find a cab.
, we needn’t worry.”
“People talk,” replied John. “But a very wise man once pointed out to me that they do little else.”
“And yet, you remember. You haven’t deleted it.”
“...but she’s not and...”
“No money.  I expect they think I might lend them some once we’re kin.  Ha!  Well, I might.  They’ve got connections, all these old noble families do.  If their connections pay off for me, I might be willing to lend them a bit.  With interest, of course!  Too bad they didn’t have a daughter available, but I got you on as first spouse.  Their boy’s second – your blushing bride.  Ha!  Don’t you glare at me like that, boy.  It’s a good marriage I’ve made for you.”
“It comes and goes.  Psychosomatic, triggered by stress.”
Sherlock stared at him.  “Even at the time, I knew Muircheartaigh might have been willing to let Victor go if I’d offered myself instead.”
Mrs Hudson sat down at the table with a cuppa of her own and looked at the bag. “There’s this to be said for marrying a criminal, dear. They
“Why settle for ‘almost’ when I’ve already got the real thing?” John murmured back. He was rewarded by Sherlock’s smile.
One man, pale and silent, didn’t seem to realize at first that the bread was food.  He sniffed it cautiously and eventually licked it, but made no move to put it into his mouth.  The woman sitting next to him tore off a bite-size piece, placed it in his mouth and gently began to move his jaw up and down.  After a moment, he began chewing on his own.
“Neither is Sherlock, or haven’t you realized that by now?  Perhaps he’s right to think that you’re just too stupid to understand how badly he’s betrayed you.”
The blond man gave up on waiting for his missing companion, threw some money on the table to cover the cost of his wine and left. He turned right on leaving the restaurant, then ducked down an alleyway.
“But you weren’t there.” Sherlock’s mouth twisted in what might have been intended as a smile. “It had been two years, of course you weren’t there.”
“I’d suggest the capellini al gamberetti,” Sherlock said.
“You’re saying that except for the fling in his forties, Foucault is married to his work,” said John, keeping his face perfectly straight.
Mary shrugged, unruffled, and took another sip of tea. “Yes, that time. I’d estimate that the scars were less than a year old.”
Sherlock nodded. “We’re good. She bought herself a cottage, did you know?”
John found himself at loose ends once he arrived back at Baker Street.  He’d regained his breath on the ride home.  Once he’d divested himself of his jacket and tucked the gun away underneath the mattress in the bedroom, he wasn’t sure what to do next.  Wait for word from Sherlock, presumably.
Thanks go to:
This detail attended to, John went to bed and slept until just past noon.  He would have slept longer except that Sherlock decided to express his frustrated impatience by torturing his violin.  John retaliated by dragging Sherlock out to go book shopping.  This worked out unexpectedly well.  Sherlock disdained any store featuring flashy displays of the latest best sellers.  Instead he took John on a tour of small used bookshops, often tucked away down alleys and in basements.  The result was a treasure trove for John, who hadn’t had access to anything published in the UBR during the past 11 years.  Even Sherlock found a volume that interested him in the third shop they visited.  Better yet, when Sherlock introduced John as his husband, the shop owners gave John discounts or waved away his money altogether.
She looked pointedly at John, who felt his face heating. Sherlock merely shrugged.
Sherlock turned to look at him, apparently catching on to the fact that something was off. “It was an excellent choice of film, John. The details regarding the drug trade in Florida were almost accurate.”
“What’s that mean?” asked Tyler.
“The bungled arrest and Muircheartaigh’s escape had unpleasant repercussions, especially concerning my somewhat unofficial role.  The parents of the victim, Carl Powers, were all the more furious because he’d been only thirteen years old.  They claimed that I’d actually caused his death and demanded retribution.  My brother used my own youth as an argument to get them to accept a monetary payment in lieu of my imprisonment.”
Not John himself, then.  Something to do with John, but not Rosamund.  Ah.  Sherlock began John and Mary’s wedding waltz.
“A new and ingenious compression algorithm,” breathed Sherlock. “If we could find out what it was...”
The driver grinned at John in the rear view mirror.  “Just making a bit of extra money, mate.”
Wentworth was indeed exchanging words with someone in the cab.
“So we have... what? A celibate biochemist.  A physicist who talks out of turn when she’s had a few and who has an ex-husband who’s dating a fit-looking photographer and who hasn’t published a successful book in years.  Threatening messages and a vandalized lab.  The bloke who apparently did the vandalism died of a heart attack shortly afterwards.  We don’t know who he is because a younger fellow took his wallet, called 999 and fled.”
“Probably wise.”
John glanced at his flatmate and hazarded a guess. “Your parents.”
Chuckling softly, John laid a hand on Sherlock’s arm, glancing down the bar as he did so to make sure that Pauline was out of earshot.  “That’s amazing, love.  Sherlock, this is my cousin, David Watson.  You met his father at our wedding.  David, my husband, Sherlock Holmes.”
But as he played Rosamund’s theme, he kept hearing another in his mind.  Lower in pitch, steady, almost plodding at times but punctuated by occasional unexpected runs and percussive notes.  It was John, of course, and in his mind Sherlock could hear how the two wound together.  He’d tried recording himself playing John’s theme and then playing Rosamund’s theme along with the recording, but this was unsatisfactory, didn’t allow for the give and take of two live players.
Molly covered the corpse’s face again and stammered, “There’s chairs in my office. I mean, to sit on.  If you want to.”

“Didn’t think so. I’ll make some tea.”
“Let’s try, Sherlock. If you want me to stop, say so and I’ll stop, right away, whatever I’m doing. But let’s try.”
wouldn’t make simple mistakes like that.”
John recognized that it was entirely possible that Sherlock could simply have placed the patches on other parts of his body. However, he drew the line at expanding his inspections.  Drew it in terms of actions, anyway.  His thoughts developed an alarming tendency to wander across that line on their own, without seeking his permission.
Oh, hell, thought John.  He hadn’t looked to confront this particular issue so soon after his arrival.  “Wait, I can explain that, it’s just...”
“That went well,” Mary observed.
“I’d’ve liked that, though. Seeing you jump out of a cake.”
They only stepped away from each other when they heard the bedroom door open. Mary padded in, her eyes swollen and reddish. John wondered if she’d cried herself to sleep.
Still with the safety on, he took aim at the skull on the mantelpiece, falling automatically into the proper stance.
It was obviously a losing battle.  “Never mind,” John sighed.  “I’ll pick some milk up myself.”
John turned on him. “She

John stared.

John grimaced.  “And like a bad penny, I turned up again.”
“Ivan Watovich, what is it?” asked Sara, keeping her voice down so as not to alarm the others.  “You look as if...”
John had phoned Lestrade from the hospital once Sherlock had been stabilized but not since. He owed Lestrade more than that so after breakfast, he paid a visit to New Scotland Yard.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Her eyes flickered to John, who stepped back, distancing himself. This was Sherlock’s show.
“He’d know if anyone would,” said Harry darkly.
“Lestrade,” said Sherlock dangerously, “if you
John made another try. “Sherlock...”

“I was... somewhat distraught.”
“God, yes,” breathed John.
“You are.”
“Sherlock?  Oh!  Tall, feathered and bossy?”
“No, I was telling her that

never stop,
“No argument from me,” said John, grinning.
“Yeah, Sherlock and I have already had that talk. Once she starts crawling, walking’s not too far off. We may remodel 221C and relocate his lab there.”
“This year. Besides, I already gave Wiggins an outworn parka of Mycroft’s and a selection of Costa gift cards.”
John went to the door.  “Ladies, it’s under control.  I’ll make sure Billy’s not hurt.”  Then he shut the door and gave Lestrade a meaningful look.  Somewhat reluctantly, Lestrade released Billy.
“Nom de dieu!” For the first time in the conversation, Foucault seemed to have heard something he didn’t already know.  “He has been tracking me all these years?”
knows better than to risk a public confrontation with either Timothy or myself,” Mrs Holmes said sternly. “We’ve provided him with reasonable grounds to claim that he was unaware of anything amiss. If he knows what’s good for him, he’ll use them.”
“I phoned the police.”
“I don’t think that the truth would do much to appease Detective Sergeant Donovan. I was attempting to synthesize a more effective form of benzoylmethylecgonine.”
“Shooting
Lestrade nodded at Molly, who rolled the waiting gurney forward and gently drew back the sheet covering the face.
“Tyler,” said Miranda more firmly.
“Precisely.  You were... interesting.  Travelling with you was interesting.  Where others had been afraid or angry, you were amazed.  Fighting beside you was...  If heroes exist, Ivan Watovich, you might well be one of them.”  Sherlock was still not smiling, but his earlier bitterness had passed, replaced by a sort of sombre calm.  He gazed at Ivan as if memorizing Ivan’s features. As if he thought Ivan would be leaving soon.
He’d thought John would be waiting for him when he got back. Egotism? Or naïve hope?
And Sherlock was still in the loo, fussing with his hair.
“One evening, he persuaded the boy to accompany him to the university. He’d almost certainly read Dr Campbell-Williams’ comments in die Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung predicting an imminent breakthrough.  He knew where you work.  He found an unlocked door...”
“Sorry, good point.”
“Yeah, at the moment we’re assuming that Magnussen was the intended target, Sherlock was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He said he was attempting to retrieve incriminating letters on behalf of a client whom he can’t name. ‘Professional courtesy,’ he said, and I can’t fault him for that.”
But John had never asked, not even the most innocuous question. He was a doctor, but he hadn’t given Sherlock even the slightest opening to talk if he wanted to.
“These individuals – the betas – carry the infants, while the fertile alpha/omega individuals are free to breed again immediately. The result allows for more intelligent children, born at a higher rate.”
“Ms Caustlin,” Lestrade began after Molly had left, “Due to the circumstances in which your uncle was found, we’re going to have to ask you some questions. If you prefer, we can wait until later and you can come down to New Scotland Yard?”
“Almost all relationship breakdowns start with communication problems.”
have got turned around occasionally, but I don’t think so.  Of course, at the time I was in better shape, with more suitable gear – and a horse!  It will take us longer now.”  Her eyes scanned the others as she spoke, tallying their weaknesses, weighing their chances.  She too, Ivan realized, was thinking and planning.
Once they’d been left alone again, however, the conversation flagged.
“Not that I’ve ever heard.”
bedroom. But the bed upstairs is the smaller one, so we’re going to swap beds. We can tell Mrs Hudson we did it so she’d be less bothered by the noise, she’ll like that.”
“Case.”
Juggling his luggage and his cane, he approached the door, setting his suitcase down to knock.  A moment later, the door swung open and a young girl stared at him.
John did so and received a surprise. “That’s... Is that freshly done?”
Sherlock had in fact stopped a few metres away.  As John hobbled up to him, he continued speaking as if there’d been no break.  “The other part was that people who had less saw a chance to get more from those who had more.  You remember my parents?  My father tried to defend the family home against looters with an old shotgun he kept for hunting.  Both he and my mother died.”
“I obviously

Angelo came back with a small glass bowl containing a lit tea-light.  He put it onto the table and gave John a thumbs-up before turning and walking away again.
John sipped.  He’d been sipping all evening.  “You mean British beer as you remember it.  Who the hell knows what British beer is like these days.”
“I was trying to think of a word that means endearing but without the same degree of implied sentimentality. Yes, we might discuss getting matching tattoos,
Seven and a quarter hours after Mary thumped on the ceiling, she began to grunt with each contraction. John and Sherlock helped her walk up and down the room until she indicated that she wanted to lie down.
, he and Sherlock. They thwarted criminals. They cheated death and not always but often enough, they saved lives. And now Mary ran with them, omega to their alpha and beta, as intent as they were on their shared purpose.
And yet.
“All right, I think that about wraps things up,” Lestrade began, but Sherlock shook his head.
John pulled himself together. If Sherlock wanted to talk now, John was damn well going to listen. “Neither. The fettucini is fine and

“John, you’ve got to give me
what I was thinking,” he purred.  And then in a completely different tone, “Come on!”  He took off at a run down the path, the curves of his pale buttocks flashing in the sunlight as the shirt flapped back and forth.  Ivan shook his head, but ran after him.
“No, so that

“Off by three centuries, but your knowledge of history is hardly worse than the Committee’s.  They’ve adopted both Tyler and Cromwell as revolutionary forbears.  Can’t have people think they’ve imported the concept of republicanism wholesale from the French.”
Mary snuggled against his side, kissed his ear. “Let it go for tonight, love. You need to sleep if you’re going to be good for anything tomorrow.”
She seemed genuinely distressed. “Molly, whatever Sherlock’s got going on, it’s not your fault. No, don’t try to take that back. I’ll take it home –
“Oi, wait!  Just wait a minute, you don’t have to strangle me!”  Ivan yanked the cord out of Sherlock’s grasp and pulled it up over his head.  “Here you go.  But it’s not a magic ring.”
Life went on with no incidents other than the usual. Thus, when Mrs Hudson announced a visitor one evening, John was expecting a client. He was surprised and, for reasons he could not quite fathom, uneasy when the visitor proved to be Dexter, the alpha he’d last seen in 221B with Janine.
The others thought this was hilarious.  Nigel – John was pretty sure his name was Nigel – continued.  “Yeah, with all the rounds we brought for you, you were pretty damned drunk!  ‘M not surprised you don’t remember.”
“We were both in our final year. Victor’s birthday fell 34 days before mine.  I’d been researching the synthesis for some time, but it took me longer than I’d planned to complete it.  Part of the problem, of course, was that my work was completely unauthorized, so that I could only use the university labs when no one else was around.”
“I was wondering when you’d notice,” grumbled Sherlock.
“I might find dumping the dregs of my tea over those perfectly-coiffed curls
Christ, his voice hadn’t even broken yet.
Finally they made it inside the reception hall. Sherlock’s best man’s speech got off to an awkward start and looked to be following the same doomed path as his stag-night plans. In the end, however, Sherlock solved two cases, prevented James Sholto’s death and ensured the arrest of a two-time attempted murderer.
Ivan dismounted and went to stroke his old friend’s nose.  As he was doing so, the house door flew open and Marfa Hudovna came running out.  She embraced Ivan as if he were her son, and he hugged her in return.
“Mammals without pouches,” explained Sherlock.
Right, trust Sherlock to be stubborn even while falling asleep sitting up.  “I’m 34, Sherlock, not 64.”
“We have a case!”
surprised. I merely hid it well.” Mary seemed to have regained some composure. “Understanding human emotions isn’t your area, Sherlock.”
After a moment, John nodded.  “Right, then.  So we can’t expect the call until early tomorrow morning.  Anything on for today?”
“Dr Watson, call for you on line 3.”
The laboratory equipment was familiar but... mismatched.  John was fairly sure he hadn’t seen that particular model of gas chromatograph until he went back to medical school in Canada.  What was it doing here, in the lab he remembered from his university days in Britain?  He heard someone running along the corridor towards the lab and already knew the news they carried: his father was dead.
“I’ve got photos of him doping her wine, and Sherlock’s got samples of the doped wine itself. Anything on the wire?”
“You have questions.”
“And yet he’s met you all the same.  Made a point of it, in fact.  Beware, John.”
“Shhhh, let me take care of you, love.”
wasn’t your idea anymore than it was mine.  I was trying to buy us some time, maybe find a way out, and that meant convincing the doctor we’d done... what was expected.”
And Sherlock flinched.
“Harry, I didn’t come here to listen to you talk about Sherlock. For once, I’m here to listen to you talk about
“I have you,” Sherlock conceded.
“Greg Lestrade.”
He took the bow from its case, rosined it, picked up the violin, checked the tuning, made minute adjustments.  He began to play Rosamund’s theme.
“No, I’m sticking right with you. Someone has to be there to tell the other side of the story.”
“Like my father’s name and title,” Ivan grinned.
“Umbrella Man.  The pompous twit who kidnapped me and offered me money to spy on you.  That was your brother.”
John nodded. “Some of the betties agreed, some didn’t. Everyone was arguing, the alfs were claiming that
“He sets spells to draw them to him.  Some think they’re running to escape a curse.  Others” – Sherlock raised an eyebrow in Ivan’s direction – “think they’re seeking to destroy the sorcerer who cursed them.  But in the end, they’re all drawn into his net.”

she’d allowed Sherlock to check her suitcase and coat for weapons and bugs. He checked both bedrooms as well, since Mary had spent time in each, but everything came up clear.

Innocent of either yellow tape or police officers, the alley instead offered an abundance of trash and footprints. The rear end was closed off by a wooden fence, with a rusted metal bin in one corner.
The books wouldn’t all fit in the duffle. He found a cardboard box in the kitchen. He could manage both the box and the duffle on the Tube, no problem. But if he was bringing the box, he’d might as well fill it. He’d spotted his dress uniform hanging in the closet, next to his wedding suit. Maybe if he put some of his socks and things into the box, he could fold the uniform into the duffle?

There must have been rain here recently, because the underbrush was all still quite wet.  Ivan was able to collect of large pile of tinder and kindling, but when he tried to light it with flint and steel, he couldn’t get the sparks to catch.  He swore and was about to give up when a large shape landed beside him in the growing darkness.  Sherlock reached forward to touch one brilliantly-coloured wingtip to a bit of tinder – and the tinder immediately burst into flames.

“What did she say about Sherlock in her statement?” asked John.
But Dexter had one more thing to say. “John? I wouldn’t be going on a date tonight if I hadn’t got up the courage to ask.”
He found himself in a small anteroom, where Lestrade was pulling on a coverall like Anderson’s.  Sherlock pointed to a pile of similar garments.  “You need to wear one of these.”

For a few paces more she was silent.  Then: “I was the best fighter in my village
“John, I didn’t take the risk of sneaking back into the UK in order to shoot the one beta who might be willing to carry this child. Furthermore, the woman who helped me do it had also managed to find out what agency Sherlock’s birthmother used to work with. Speaking of which, does Sherlock have a sister?”
“After we returned to live with Boris’ family in Tsvetovsk, things... didn’t go well.  Boris was angry all the time.  He drank too much and got even angrier when I said so.  His family blamed everything on me, the foreign wife.  When Boris began to hit me, no one would listen.”
“Mr McKinsey’s medications had been changed recently. The new medications upset his stomach.  Once the niece was gone, he stopped taking them.  At about the same time, the media began focussing on the change in divorce laws and the resulting protests, including the anti-science protests.  His grandnephew reported that he would become agitated while watching these on television.”
“Only if you promise to take off that hideous jumper.”

“I assure you, I won’t be alone.”

“Borrowed,” murmured Sherlock as he fiddled with John’s jacket collar.
“It would break him and I would lose him forever – and, Sherlock, I will
As it turned out, most of the progress Sherlock had made overnight concerned BritChat entries.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide in mock dismay. “What happened to ‘the best and wisest man’ that you’ve ever known?”
Knowing Rosamund would be inundated with gifts of toys on her birthday, he’d presented her instead with something intangible: a violin piece he’d composed.  He’d tried to capture her personality: intelligent, curious, explorative, bubbling with laughter.  John had wiped his eyes and hugged Sherlock afterwards, so perhaps he’d succeeded.

wanted to say about the tosser.
“Oh.  All right.  Er – Cromwell was someone important in the Revolution?”
, who’d gone out of his way to get Tyler a break.  Sherlock’s possible reasons for doing so were another thing John found himself unable to put out of his mind.
Mary was light when John could see only bleak grey. She was laughter when John could hear only relentless silence no longer broken by a baritone voice.
“Oi! Right, just for that I’m spitting in your next pint.”
times? But they’d arrived at the hospital and were heading for Sherlock’s room. John opened the door to discover...
John tried phoning Greg to see if he might be interested in going out to a pub, but Greg was working, so John figured he’d get take-away and watch some crap telly. How long had it been since he’d had take-away? Mary was always going on about “eating healthy” and apparently there was no such thing as healthy take-away. As a doctor, John was theoretically in favour of health. In practice, he was looking forward to a bit of a take-away splurge. So what if he’d gained four pounds? (
“But now Molly knows that you had a need for omega maternity clothes, she knows the sizes and she’s met Mary. You may think Molly’s an idiot...”
“Oh, really?” John waited a moment and then moved suddenly, ending up with Sherlock on his belly and John straddling his back, pinning Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock bucked and writhed to no avail. John leant forward.
Sherlock smirked, gave a second, more exaggerated shrug and then before John could say anything, added, “Thai is fine.”

He was about to add that he

“Not physically. He ordered me to go and then pissed me off enough that I went.”
“Yeah, well, they didn’t know that, did they?”
case?”
It was very much like being in the army again.
“Yes.  I know,” John replied a bit ruefully.  Better not to mention that the marriage was arranged, or that he’d been gone for 14 years.  Kinder not to give Molly false hope.
“Wha’the hell
Sherlock sniffed loudly.
“Not merely
“Sherlock?”
“And yet the attempt itself is worth something,” Ivan returned.
She was certainly pretty enough, but what had Misha been on about, warning Ivan about her sharp tongue?  On the contrary, she seemed a timid sort.  Still, Misha claimed to have a reputation as matchmaker, and this was the woman he had directed Ivan to address.  Ivan gave her his best smile.
“What, right now?” yelped Ivan, thinking that he at least ought to go get Bezimyan.
“You returned to the UK five years ago.”
John, on the verge of opening his mouth with the admonishment, “Bit not good,” realized just in time that he wasn’t addressing Sherlock and kept quiet.
But when some of passengers, luggage in hand, began to approach the buses, the man with the clipboard frowned.  Still smiling, the assistants herded the baffled but cooperative passengers into a group.  There they waited until the last bag had been claimed, some of the younger children beginning to fuss in the drizzle.
“Well, it’s your basic keep.  Tall stone walls, narrow windows.  Two towers, one to the north, one to the south, each with battlements on top.”
would fit that description.  John, show Lestrade your shoes.”
. So I asked them to dinner and they accepted!”
John put the container back in the refrigerator and began to arrange his groceries well away from it.
With a sweep of wings and tail, Sherlock stood and spun to face him.  Ivan saw real anger in the silver eyes before Sherlock spat, “Fine.  I’ll bring you back to Marfa Hudovna’s tomorrow.  I’m sure she’ll give you a nice meal before she sends you on your way.  But remember, Ivan Watovich, all your roads will always lead you back to Muircheartaigh.”  Then Sherlock leapt upwards and regained his high perch.
At this the guards demanded that Ivan give them the ring that they might examine it more closely, but Ivan refused.  “It’s as much as my life’s worth to surrender this ring to anyone, for the tsar gave it to me himself!”
Mary smiled wryly. “That sounds like both a promise and a threat.”
“Yeah, she knows. She knows that the man who’s probably her uncle died in an alley of a heart attack and that we couldn’t identify him because his wallet was missing.  That’s
“Because he liked sex, and cocaine made sex tolerable for me. Although to be honest, we both enjoyed cocaine for its own sake.”  Sherlock sounded as if he were talking about a pint down at the pub.
“Had a fight with his wife?” suggested John and received Sherlock’s best “you are an idiot” look for his pains.
Ivan started to laugh at the picture she drew, and Marfa Hudovna joined in.  When they’d both quieted, she added, “He’s a good man, Ivan Watovich.  He has a good heart.”
“How long ago was this?”

“We were only gonna get paid if we delivered the boffin bird. They read about her in some foreign newspaper, thought she’d make a good hostage.  But we’re not gonna be making that delivery now, so we’re not getting paid.  We’d might as well talk,” Ives explained.
“Trust me, mate, I’d give anything if to see him get up and walk away from this. He could even keep the bloody... the damn evidence.”
“Sherlock, you can’t go running off...”
“No question,” replied John, amused despite himself. “Then he’ll be returning here?”
“Oh –
“Here” was an unpretentious side door towards the rear of the building.  John stood between Sherlock and the street as Sherlock made quick work of the lock.  The staircase that greeted them inside was no harder for John to navigate than that at 221B, but it was no easier either.  By the time he reached the top, Sherlock was already exploring the first floor in the semi-darkness.
Afterwards, they wiped each other off as best they could with dew-wet leaves.  When Sherlock would have headed back to the house, Ivan stopped him and pulled the shirt off his own back to tie around Sherlock’s hips.  He laughed at Sherlock’s expression.
“Oh, yes. Worked for years with... well, I suppose that’s still classified. At least she’s never told me it’s not anymore. At any rate, she worked, I carried and raised the children she bore. She still does some consulting.”
It took them some time to regain any degree of sobriety, as they kept setting each other off, but eventually Ivan wiped his eyes.  “What’s next?”
“Lauriston Gardens,” Sherlock told the driver once he and John were ensconced in the passenger seat.
“Vanya,” and here Ivan hesitated.  Ivan was a common name and Watovich not so uncommon, but he needed a surname, for the imperial family did not use them.  “Ivan Watovich Stolitsky.”
Sherlock gave him a look. “Do we really need so much colour? No, don’t bother answering. I’d nicked a standard key card for the building the previous day. Do you know what happens if you press a key card against your mobile phone for long enough?”
Sherlock smiled slowly. “I’ve been told that it’s where two people who like each other go out and have fun.”
“Mmm-hmm,” he told the voice.
“By less than a stone,” noted Mary.
“It’s fine, Sherlock, we don’t have to...”
sit and listen, then we decide if we want you or not.”
Sherlock nodded absently, studying John.
Nice to be going home, indeed.
“Going after Sherlock?” Mary jibed. “I’d advise starting with Molly’s bedroom. Or better yet – just wait for Bill Wiggins to find you. Of course, that won’t happen unless Sherlock actually
“Look...”
“Ivan Watovich, I have known where you were headed from the day I met you, and I have known that it was not with me, not for long,” she said forthrightly.  “But I hope you’ve explained all this to your family in those letters you hold, so that I won’t have to do it for you!”
After a moment, Lestrade asked patiently, “What happened, Tyler?”
“Yes, because...”
“Describe the nature of said ‘tiff.’”
John knew he owed Sherlock an apology. As the doors closed on the lift that would take them back down to the ground floor, he opened his mouth to make it – only to have Sherlock cut him off by remarking offhandedly, “From what I saw, Miranda Caustlin appears to have forgiven you for manhandling her son.”
Mrs Hudson was overjoyed.
Beyond the drawn curtains, it was morning outside.
Hmmm, they’d need space in the refrigerator for all the groceries.
“Yeah, pretty much, even with the missing hand.”
As time went by, there were fewer tears and more kisses. As time went by, John began to think that maybe it might be possible to live happily again. He began to return Mary’s laughter with smiles. One day he startled himself by laughing, which made
Sherlock did look up from the microscope then.
John reacted without thinking, grabbing the teen and pinning him against the wall with his arm up behind his own back. “Hold still!  Just hold still now and you’ll be fine.  Don’t...”  The teen tried to twist away and yelped.  “Don’t try to pull away or you’ll dislocate your shoulder.  Sherlock, are you...”
Sherlock shrugged. “I’ve seen others going through withdrawal before. And my own withdrawal experiences took place in quite different settings from the one shown in the film.” He continued to scrutinize John. “Did you find the love interest triggering?”
Campbell-Williams snorted. “Too right.  But he teaches creative writing classes and workshops.  Hates doing it, but he’s charming and popular, so he makes a reasonably steady income off it.  I suspect he spends more than he can afford showing off his girlfriend at fundraisers and galas.”
“Approximately two years.” Sherlock speared a gnocco and, to John’s amazement, ate it.
“But...”
Greg thought about it a moment. “Right, left or a mixture?”
“Dobrieuzi’s reaction, John!”
Sherlock preened a little, but then pointed out, “You could have observed the same details.  You spotted the mug tucked in among the bottles.”
“Tim?”
Sherlock smelled like sun-warmed loam with a spicy overlay. He smelled like a walk through woods and fields on a sunny autumn day.
She took a deep breath. “When he took you to the university that evening, did you go along with the plan because you thought you’d be able to steal something?”
“He wished to move on. It was one of the things I admired about him, that after such a tragedy, he was determined to go on with his life.  He wished for a successful outcome – as we all did!  But he said that even if the experiment failed, he would know he had contributed to the body of scientific knowledge.  I think...”  Here Dr Foucault faltered for the first time.  “I have sometimes thought, over the years, that he understood ‘failure’ only as the absence of the desired effect.”
Sherlock looked so exasperated that John jumped in before he could say something scathing and incriminating.  “Souvenir of an amateur production of Hamlet.  If you’re not going to go look at the bedroom right away, my husband would like to get dressed.”
“Instead you just let them drift off until they sound no more than ‘vaguely familiar’ and you have to resort to asking others to ascertain the details.”
The eastern sky was beginning to turn from black to purple.  The first hesitant strains of birdsong were rising from the dark forest.  Despite the half-light, Ivan had no trouble making out the stone-lined path. He followed it to the birch grove and looked up to scan the trees, relieved when he spotted the dark shape perched high in the branches.  He hadn’t been sure until that moment that Sherlock would choose to show himself.
But Mr Holmes didn’t miss a trick and he wasn’t above teasing. “Maddy, what are you up to over there? I see you whispering in that handsome young alpha’s ear. He’s your son-in-law and don’t you forget it!”
“E’ll be all right. I’ll keep an eye on ‘im, like. But... ‘e might not be ‘ome right tonight, you unnerstan’?”
Greg showed up the next evening, dragged John out to a pub and bought him enough pints that John could blame it on the beer when he broke down and cried. Greg had had a few himself by then.  He patted clumsily in the general direction of John’s shoulder.  “Whatever I can do to help, mate, you let me know.”
“No. But you won’t believe me, will you?”
She took a deep breath and was quiet a moment.  Not sure what to say, Ivan reached out and touched her hand.  She smiled slightly and continued.
“Sherlock,” whispered John.
She sat. She offered evidence, a pen drive holding what she claimed was “everything” about her past life. And then she asked John not to read it in front of her. Christ. He stuffed the thing in his trouser pocket to get it out of sight.
to be...”
“Anderson. He was here, with a friend, apparently on Mycroft’s orders. Doesn’t he have some sort of obsession with Sherlock?”
Molly?  Who was Molly?
There had been questions as to the wisdom of returning Eurus to Sherrinford but in the end, where else were they to put her?  Killing her or physically maiming her so that she’d be incapable of escaping were right out.  Both their parents and Sherlock had made that clear.
“Then that’s where you need to go.  I’ll see to my companions.  No, wait!  What’s your name?”
“The urge to brag. You could have left Lestrade to notify Foucault.”
over.  With black curls.
“Someone has to be,” he retorted before he thought better of it. “Sorry.”
well know.” He practically spat the last four words out.
“Not necessarily. It depends on her areas of interest.  Her work in the States should tell us something.”
Ivan Watovich strapped the saddlebags and the stick securely onto the gelding’s gear, untied the reins from the tree and swung up into the saddle.  A stiff wind blew from the north, and he’d already had enough of the south.  He set out eastwards, riding to meet the rising sun.
“Hold on there, I know I’m not as intelligent as you...”
Next to it stood the other stone. “Gloria Scott Watson, 2014.”  SIDS typically strikes infants two to four months of age.
“Your height is your problem, tall, dark and gangly. Omegas have lower centres of gravity than male betas, let alone alphas. We’re more stable.”
It wasn’t like that, Ivan didn’t say.  I only met him yesterday, he didn’t explain.  Because somehow, at some unmarked point, it had become
“Thank you,” John told the boys, since Sherlock didn’t seem about to.  They grinned and clomped on into the bedroom, deposited their burdens and then stampeded back through and out of the flat.  There was a small shriek from the stairs.
.  We were supposed to be everything the other one wanted.”
“In his mind, certainly.  If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his arch-enemy.  He does love to be dramatic.”
“Mmmm, he may bear further evaluation,” said Sherlock. He propped himself up on one arm, carding the fingers of his other hand through John’s hair.
. At our ages, it’s not too soon to start thinking of children, and I know you’ve been worried about being caught off-guard.”
However, when the phone rang a moment later, Sherlock frowned and muttered, “He knows I prefer to text.”
“Her cross!” exclaimed Stevens, brightening a bit.  “Did you bring it?  The other detective said that it was evidence but that they’d return it to me as soon as possible.  It was her mother’s and meant a lot to her.  I wanted it to b-bu-bur... ”
Sherlock squeezed John’s hands. They sat looking into each other’s eyes a moment, then let go, looked away and resumed eating.
Ivan plucked the feather free.  If Sherlock flinched at this moment – and he did, just a bit – it would appear to be in response to Muircheartaigh’s accusation.  Working quickly, Ivan held the case against his body with one arm while he placed the feather between the index and ring finger of his other hand.  Then he poised that hand over the heart he knew to be Muircheartaigh’s.  He would only get one chance at this.
“I thought you were supposed to be a detective?” asked John, his face completely straight.
“Or by a rival. It’s a mistake to theorize before all the facts are in. The autopsy will tell us more, and there are people I need to talk to. John, come along. Elderly widows like you.”
A chill ran down Ivan’s spine.  “You think he’s bespelled me to come to him.”  He remembered the morning he left the capital and his decision to ride east simply because east felt like the best way to go.  The north wind was cold, there was war in the south.  Why not go east?
“Sherlock, would you and your work like to go out with me and have fun?”
“Transport,” replied John, discomfited. In light of Sherlock’s recent revelations, Donovan’s remarks were a bit too close to the bone.  Why was he listening to them, anyway?  He should shake Donovan off and get Sherlock out of there.  But she was still talking.
me...”
“The hormones have... sped things... oh!... up. Yes, like that, just like that, John.”
Even remembering the grave look on John’s face as he said this made Sherlock’s throat feel ticklish.
“And that concession would be acceptable to you?” The question was quiet, without mockery. Sherlock was making a genuine effort to understand a concept that eluded him.
“Hardly even a three, unless Dr Campbell-Williams has improved your opinion of it.”
My Grade 10 biology teacher for showing the class a film in which a new born joey about the size and shape of a jelly bean hauled itself up the vast expanse of its kangaroo mother’s belly to the safety of her pouch.  I sat perched on the edge of my seat, terrified but unable to either look away or breathe, until the joey vanished into the pouch.  What if Mumma ‘Roo had sneezed?  Or been startled?  What if a strong wind had kicked up at the wrong moment?  It was a traumatic experience – and one that instilled in me a huge respect for the tenacity of life.
“Your
“Quite understandable,” replied Sherlock.  “I don’t have the cross with me, but I’ll ensure it’s returned to you.  Did your wife often wear it outside of the house?”
? Billy Holmes?” John’s nerves got the better of him and he started to giggle. “Does Wiggins know about this?”
!” protested Mary.
“Normally you accomplish that by asking your date about places
“How?” he demanded. “We were using contraceptives!”
They reached 221B and climbed the seventeen steps, but when John went to open the door, Sherlock stopped him.
“First off, I wouldn’t call your dealer a ‘friend.’ If you killed him, the world’s probably better off for it.”
American – approximately the same time she returned to Britain.  It’s not proven but highly likely that the spouse remained in the States.  Aren’t you done eating yet?”
Seen through the glass, the contents of the case looked quite different.  The heart on the right was black and shrivelled, its beats jerky and irregular, while the red, healthy heart on the left beat strongly and well.
“So I’ve heard,” John replied.  “Lead on.”
She studied him a moment, then sighed. “You’re telling the truth. You’ve always been so honest, John.”
“Dunno about you, mate, but for me ‘living’ is a prerequisite for attraction.”
Sherlock shrugged and sipped, his eyes on John.
as if you’ve forgotten the basic structure of the scientific method,
“What royal or even noble family would sacrifice one of their children to the curse that lies upon us?” interrupted the tsar.
“So do I,” replied Sherlock, quite seriously.
“I tried asking him questions about labs.”
“But was your source reliable?”
“Walls, gate, courtyard inside.  Only a handful of guards.  Wearing chainmail, I think?”
It was Sherlock.
John aimed for a head shot and pulled the trigger.
Sherlock was as stunningly beautiful in this form as he had been as a bird.  Even more, his human shape was
“Eating is boring.”
“He’s also depending on his own magic.”
“My first marriage,” Marie explained.  She was an attractive woman, perhaps a few years older than John and built on a more generous scale than her petite aunt.  “And you and Sherlock are... married?”
Where was his happiness now?
“John.”
Silence. Then:
“That’s what she was talking about in the lab,” John realized. “How is chemical information transmitted between two individuals?  Foucault and Campbell-Williams think it has to do with quantum entanglement.”
, young man, no more peeping in at girls’ windows!  If you’re interested in a girl, show her you have some guts by introducing yourself to her face.”
“Yes, I’m angry!” Ivan retorted.  “Why aren’t you?”
“Tolerated.”
“Get some Hobnobs as well.”
“I wasn’t on holiday, John. I was working. And it was hardly the first time I’d had to break in somewhere I wasn’t wanted – ‘on my own,’ as you put it. Is this relevant to your original question?”
John pushed a final strand of pasta around his plate.  “Sherlock, this evening...” he began.
“Not quite yet.” John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s tangled curls and kissed the top of his head.  “Have you deleted the concept of refractory periods?”
Sherlock swallowed a mouthful of curry to ask, “What about the clinic?”
“Bill Ives,” said Lestrade cheerfully. “I’d never heard that you’d got a cabbie’s license.”
Sherlock didn’t answer until several steps on. “Go ahead.”
“It’s Wednesday. Mary has yoga class Wednesday afternoons.” And then, on an unhappy thought, “Or what she’s always claimed is yoga class, anyway.”
“An enemy?”
going out?
“Dr Watson, my colleague and husband.”  Sherlock turned to John.  “John, Sergeant Sally Donovan.  Old friend.  Well, I say ‘friend’...”
Manya nodded.  “That’s not an easy choice.”
Sherlock sat up immediately, straddling John, looking imperiously debauched. He locked eyes with John, put his long-fingered hands to his own throat and began to unbutton his shirt. John’s mouth went dry. He couldn’t look away, couldn’t help licking his lips, but he managed to croak, “Bedroom?”
“Will do.” Lestrade headed off, already talking into his phone.
alphas. She cursed the pregnancy kit manufacturer, Sherlock, Wiggins, Magnussen and Janine. The she started cursing people whom John didn’t know and was fairly sure he didn’t want to know, although he suspected Mycroft might have been interested.
Miranda gasped. “Tyler, what were you thinking?  Surely by that point you must have realized that this wasn’t a good idea.”
“...Sherlock said Mrs Hudson wouldn’t mind.”
“That’s... actually a very good idea. Thank... Oh, hell.
The boy’s chin went up.  “I’m fourteen, and you’re an idiot.  You managed to step in a mud puddle just getting from your lodgings to your uncle’s
“And enjoy being knotted without getting hurt. Omegas outside heat don’t. Betas never do. And Sherlock... Hey, Sherlock? Look at me. That’s better. I want you to consider something.”
That focused cerulean gaze was unnerving John.  “After all, it’s been 14 years, it would be entirely natural, I was hardly celibate myself...”  Damn, now he was babbling.
His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the front door opening and then voices, Mrs Hudson’s and...  Damn, Lestrade’s!
that the first thing he would do on arriving in your house would be to set up a laboratory – and that he’d persuade you to let him!”
John knew that he would have owed her an update on Sherlock even if she hadn’t been willing to trade a meal for it. He vaguely remembered eating something in the hospital at some point and wasn’t at all hungry until he sat down. Then he was ravenous. In between bites and spoonfuls, he filled Mrs Hudson in on the latest.
bed.”
“Right, as if she’s still going to be interested after I almost dislocated her son’s arm in front of her,” John sighed. “Thanks for the offer, though.”
“My friend’s in there,” he told Sara, indicating the keep.
“With my help in leaving the country. By the time she contacted me, she’d already made her decision and left your home.”
Ivan and Sara sat down as well, and Svinarnikov came around the fire to sit by them.  “You were a soldier, am I right?” he asked Ivan.
Bracing himself for the pain, Ivan reached for the fiery rope – only to have it dance out of his way.  Instead, it wrapped itself around his body just below his arms and then began to pull him upwards.  There was no pain at all, not from the fire nor even from his shoulder or leg.  He grasped the rope in both hands to take some of the strain off his armpits and tried to help by bracing his legs against the side of the well.
“They apparently didn’t want me there.”
With her omegologist’s assistance, Mary had used suppressants to adjust her cycles so that her heat began two days after the wedding. The week that followed was nothing short of amazing. Sure, they’d had sex before, but by unspoken agreement, they’d saved the experience of sharing a heat. John felt drunk on Mary’s sweet/tart scent, on the taste of her in his mouth and the feel of her on his skin. He slid into her warmth and she was more than ready, she was
She stared at him a moment in silence, then began to play again.  At first he thought it was another variation on Rosamund’s theme, but no.  There was intelligence and curiosity here, but no bubbling laughter.  Instead, the music soared into runs of notes that sparkled like crystals of high-quality cocaine before falling away into almost monotone depths.  Again, it soared, seemed to stumble, then fell, and each time it fell, there was nothing that promised it would rise again.  Each fall was potentially final.
“I offered you tea!”
“And have their lackeys buy groceries for the people they’ve interrogated?”
“Nope.” John smiled a bit wider and leaned forward a little. “So, do you want to watch the film again
John returned home from the clinic on the 2
“I dunno. He was all right with our page boy – Andrew?”
“It’s a dummy. I suppose it was a fairly obvious trick.”
“The local popular press being...”
“Two things,” he told Mary. “One, no matter what Sherlock may tell you, Mrs Hudson really
John stood up as well and began to clear the table. Sherlock didn’t so much stand up as fling himself out of his chair at John’s laptop, where he began typing.
“As you may have noticed, the piece requires a partner. Ravel originally wrote it to be played by violin and
But Sherlock shook his head. “Mycroft knows who shot his brother. He has no surveillance inside this building and won’t come after Mary as long as she stays here. But it would be a mistake to approach him.”
It was after another, less odoriferous case that Sherlock and John stopped for lunch at a cafe. John ordered tea, a toastie and a packet of crisps. Sherlock ordered coffee and badgered John into ordering cheddar-and-chives crisps instead of salt-and-vinegar. The day was sunny and unusually warm for early November, so they took their meal outdoors. Two boys went running by outside, one of them carrying a Guy Fawkes mannequin.
He could still
“Did trauma surgery for two years before an accident left me with nerve damage in my dominant arm.  I retrained as a GP and practiced for another four years.”
“Yeah, I know. No one seems to know why.  Also, he didn’t make the call himself.  The 999 recording sounds like a much younger fellow, fairly frantic.  The operator was able to keep him on the line for a while, but he hung up just before the ambulance got here.  You can hear the siren approaching and then the recording cuts off.”
“Twenty-two.  We had shared interests, spent time together.  I suppose we were friends.”
John had left his own cell phone behind in Canada with Bill because he’d been told it wouldn’t work in the UBR – something about different signal encoding.   Now he wondered if that had been a mistake.
“Oh, great, we’re going to sit here in the dark waiting for a criminal to show up. And I left my gun at home.”
candles.
“And we’ll tell it, John and I. When it’s grown. When it can make decisions as an adult. When it’s ready to read your pen drive.”
“It all keeps coming back to Magnussen. He owned a media corporation, right? CAM Global News.”
“Go!”
“Hell, Sherlock! What are you doing there?”
John blinked. He’d completely forgotten the bloody thing. Mary was holding both hands to her mouth, but Sherlock only added, “Or whatever the media of choice is eighteen years from now. I’ll transfer the data as necessary.”
“Damn the cold bastard! Mycroft told Sherlock that if Sherlock went against Magnussen, he’d be going against Mycroft as well. I just didn’t think he’d... Fucking Holmeses!”
They flew on and on. The green sea gave way to blue, and Ivan caught the faint scent of salt.  Then they were flying over another forest again.  A dark bulk appeared on the horizon.  As they grew closer, Ivan could make out the towers and turrets of a huge castle.  Within the hour they had arrived.  Sherlock landed just far enough away to be out of sight from the castle walls.
Ivan tried to protest, only to discover that he could not speak.  He settled for glaring.
“Apparently Sherlock interviewed him for the position of usher, deduced his past involvement with and continuing interest in me and issued a sort of personal injunction. Oh, take your head out of your hands, darling. David will get over it. Sherlock’s just being a bit over-protective. It’s rather cute.”
“You’re not unintelligent, but you don’t see what I see. You listen when I explain, which is more than most people do. But you
.  Bloody drunk drivers!  Why don’t the courts take their licenses away
know is that you not only kept information from me, you also lied. Our entire relationship is built on lies. You were never going to tell me the truth, not even when Sherlock and I could have helped you with Magnussen.”
John stared back, unable to find words.
Right, Watson, John berated himself. Really smooth.  Your best friend tells you how he lost his soulmate, so you decide that’s a good time to kiss him.
“Oh, right, no problem then!  Sherlock, I’m one man...”
“Your deodorant told me that.”
Binned it rather than try to wash out the blood, John realized. “Is that meant to be reassuring?”
Campbell-Williams gave John a puzzled look as he choked back a laugh, but extracted a pen from her pocket and scribbled the required information.
But Marfa Hudovna smiled and shook her head.  “It was his house first, dear.  I had some trouble where I was living, and...  Well, it’s a long story.  I don’t know if you care to hear it?”
. Not yet, because as long as my marriage to Mary still holds, she’d have to agree to marry you too. But in two years I can file for divorce on grounds of desertion and then I’ll be...”
They walked on in silence. John took deep breaths, trying to calm down. After a long while, he could finally speak again. “Someone did that once, did they? Hit you when you were already injured, then told you to stop whining.”
“No, but observing the physical details that betray emotional reactions is very much ‘my area.’ What’s interesting about your statement, however, is that you said something similar the evening we first met. And then you followed it by saying you’d talk John ‘round. Did you welcome the opportunity I represented?”
“Maybe not
“Sherlock, have you considered the possibility that Janine just might have been an innocent woman who loved you?”
“But why?”
Angelo’s had been a safe choice for the venue of their first date. For their second, John wanted to try something different. Something on the borders of his own comfort zone that he hoped would lie solidly within Sherlock’s. All right, that applied to most of the crime scenes they visited together, but John was hoping for something more, well, date-like.
Sherlock immediately stood up and headed for his coat.  “I need to see that shoe.”
“Phone call, actually. From his hotel.”
“Will you come?”
“Remind me never to make the same mistake,” muttered John as they continued along the pavement. Then, in a more conversational voice, “How’d you do that, with David?”
“For this phase of the study, yes. There were to have been others, later on, but...  that did not happen, of course.”
His phone had rung at just that moment. It wasn’t Greg but rather Mycroft, his voice all posh reserve.
to the door.  He applied the black feather to the lock, eased the door open and...  Thud!  A crossbow bolt shot out of the door and embedded itself in the hangings on the other side of the room.
The restaurant’s delivery door opened. An elderly man, well-dressed but obviously not sober, staggered out into the alley.  John and the Yarders followed him discreetly as he moved up towards the mouth of the alley.
Dexter was instantly contrite. “Right, that’s what Sherlock said. Except... When I thought about it later on, I thought Sherlock might have been trying to set me at ease about being there.”
, just to break the silence.
“Sherlock,” he yelled, “We’ve got to get out of here!”
John’s head came up fast.
“Just as well,” said Sherlock lightly. “You wouldn’t want to go shooting the wrong person.” His phone beeped three times, then was silent. “My scout has spotted the target approaching. Now remember. Whatever you see or hear, stay perfectly still and don’t say anything.”
John started to laugh quietly as he stood alone on the landing.
Ivan couldn’t help chuckling at her judicious phrasing.
Raymond Stevens was a greengrocer, probably in his mid-30s although his obvious signs of grief made him look older.  His neatly arranged shop stood next to a lending library.
“John,” Sherlock interrupted.  “I’m well aware that the circumstances of our marriage were hardly conducive to fidelity.  Furthermore, I’ve always considered my
“Show me the prints and I’ll make sure you get the files.”
John waited for Sherlock, who’d introduced John to everyone
“Can you tell what was taken?” asked John in a low voice.
“Blue and green herring,” muttered John.
she made, the noises she made
Muircheartaigh had called her a hedge-witch, Ivan remembered.
She was a client, nothing more.
“Won’t the autopsy details be in the files that Lestrade’s sending?”
John made himself laugh.
“I am,” agreed Sherlock. “You’re a good man, Dexter McCrae.” And to John’s amazement, he reached out and touched Dexter lightly on one cheek. “Go out and find some other good people.”
The traffic the driver had mentioned made itself evident soon enough.  Something John had noticed during the trip from the airfield became more apparent.  Although there were lots of cars, they were small and cheap-looking, nothing like the grand old automobiles that John remembered being owned by anyone who could afford a car in the first place.  Which, to be sure, did not include many people.  John’s uncle had hired a car for the trip to John’s wedding.
for not bringing your laptop with this time, Mike.”
“In a good way or a bad way?”
“Misha gave me a sack of unground rye for you, and then said I should listen to what you say.”
Especially given? “Now wait a minute...”
Sherlock sniffed. “You never were.  Or rather, she never was, for you.”
This wasn’t Mary’s favourite thing to do in bed, but she was good at it. John whimpered slightly when she finally lifted her head again, distracted from his thoughts by a degree of arousal that verged on pain.
must be hungry after all that riding.”
The abrupt question startled John. “Sorry?”
.  I rattled off a stream of deductions to assist your memory and left.  I didn’t expect you to see you again.”
After that he was more cautious, ignoring the voices that rose and fell around him, the flickers of motion he saw in the trees.  His leg and shoulder began to pain him, the pain growing the farther he rode, but he did not stop, not even to take a moment to stretch them.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Er, yes.”
“Not surprising. You should have learned this in medical school.”
John opened his mouth. Closed it again.  He couldn’t think of what to say and why should he say anything?  Mycroft was a Holmes and therefore perfectly capable of conducting the entire conversation by himself.
Mary nodded. “But males don’t have functional teats.”
“Precisely.”
“More than £20,000 worth of vandalism.”
Watching them through the car’s window, John asked, “Why is London like this?  It’s always been a large city, but now it feels packed to the gills.  Mrs Hudson’s got five people crammed into a space that might comfortably hold two or three.”
“You think it’s a clergyman or someone pretending to be a clergyman.”
“Leg acting up?” Lestrade asked sympathetically.  “I noticed you had a cane the other day.”
When John woke up again, it was broad daylight outside. Both the sound of voices and the scent of bacon emanated from the kitchen. He dressed quickly and walked into the kitchen in time to hear Sherlock say, “Anyone of the three of us can find a vein and take a blood sample. Urine samples, you can handle yourself. I can run the tests, and John can help us interpret the results if necessary.”
“Well, of course it’s for men!  I’m wearing it!”
.”  John could feel his face flaming.  “I never thought when I came up with the plan that you’d be so bloody
Campbell-Williams cut John off again. “A professional disagreement, then.”
“I don’t know, Greg. At the very least a guard might help keep Sherlock
Sherlock shrugged and snagged John’s laptop, pulling it across the table.
“The shed will be fine,” said Ivan with a smile.
“Frederick Phelps.  I met him at the pub.  Keep up, John!  He had a knife...”
Suddenly weary, John sat at the kitchen table. Mary handed him his mug and then sat down with her own.
Lestrade eyed the baby carrier. “What’s it feel like, wearing that?” he asked John.
Another shrug. “Once Janine’s story hit the papers, Lestrade was bound to return with more questions. Mary had already warned me to keep silent but anyone who knows me – including you – would have told her how poorly I listen to warnings. She had a motive and the means. I decided to deprive her of the potential opportunity.”
“Or trying to, which at least puts you ahead of most of your team. John, you’re finally here. Took you long enough. Look at his toe.”
And then, “Just so you’re clear, there’s nothing left of Da’s business.  I had to rebuild from scratch after the Revolution.  Everything I’ve got...”
John stared, then chuckled. “That’s not a bad idea at all, Mrs Hudson. I’ll call him later – well, probably tomorrow at this point.” He barely caught himself in a yawn.
Ivan drew his sword with both hands and stabbed viciously upwards into the base of the nearest man’s unarmoured skull.  Then he yanked the blade free, slashed another man across the eyes, kicked out at a third and was almost in time to block a thrust from a fourth.  Almost, but not completely – he deflected the main force of the blow, but the guard’s blade still tore through his surcoat and shirt, into the flesh below.  Ivan felt hot blood began to seep into the shirt.
John felt his smile stretch wider. “Want to go check some door handles on restaurants?”
“Did your officers at least avoid trampling the foot prints, Lestrade?” Sherlock pursued.
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.  Battles and even wars had been lost on such sloppiness.  Ivan should have known better, but faced with the fantastical, beautiful creature that was Sherlock, he’d apparently stopped thinking at all.  Had Sherlock bespelled him to do so?
The look on Lestrade’s face was answer enough.
Christ, John hadn’t known that Sherlock’s voice could even go that low. He couldn’t be sure whether he was actually hearing it or feeling it through his bones. And he, John, had done that, had made Sherlock...
with him.  Bad things happen to bad puppies.”  With that Muircheartaigh ducked behind the throne through a gap in the hangings and vanished.
Sometime later it occurred to John that if neither of them got a flannel and wiped up, they’d be stuck together in the morning. But Sherlock had already collapsed next to him and gone to sleep. John was still mulling the problem over when he fell asleep too.
“We were in this pub and Johnny here manages to drag himself up to a standing position for a trip to the bogs, and this bloke comes weaving along.  High as a kite, anyone could see it.  He comes weaving along and walks right into our Johnny, whom as we all know has just a wee bit of a temper” – more hooting – “so he tells the junky to watch where the fuck he’s going.  And the junky says…”
“I need someone I can trust.  I ask you again, Ivan Watovich, are you willing?”
“Sherlock... Oh!... Sh-Sherlock!”
“John, it’s Greg. Is Sherlock there? Our Bulgarian friends have struck again.”
list” – here the man produced a crumpled piece of paper from one pocket – “so if he’s not on
Any protestations Ivan might have made were swept away by the wind.  As the tsarevich, he had had the opportunity to ride the finest, fastest horses, but Sherlock’s powerful wings carried them high above the forest at a speed far greater than any horse could have managed.  They flew so fast that the sun rose in the sky twice as rapidly as usual, for they were flying to meet it.
“Not the room upstairs?”
Sherlock shivered once, hard, head to toe, and then went boneless beneath John. “You could be right.” His voice was slightly rough, and John grinned.
When the court physicians declared that Ivan was as recovered as he was likely to get, he asked his father and sister for an audience.  They met in the tsar’s private chambers, behind the great hall with its black draperies and empty throne, well aware that the tsar’s advisors waited just outside the closed doors – or possibly, listened at the keyholes.
“Your own...  How old were you?” asked Ivan.
The adjustments to their lives proceeded with amazing smoothness. Mary was installed in the downstairs bedroom –
“Sorry?”
“Sit,” said Sherlock, pointing at a... wheelchair? With a morphine drip? John glared at them.
“It was about as ‘implied’ as the nose on my face!  But if you like, I’ll start off.  You were apprenticed to Muircheartaigh.  He was murdering people in a place called London.  You found out and reported him to your brother’s guards, so I’m guessing your brother is someone reasonably well-off.  A boy was killed when the guards tried to capture Muircheartaigh.  Muircheartaigh stole your heart and escaped.”
“Yes?”
“Ivan Watovich?  Time to wake up, dear.  Ivan Watovich?”
yours and your
“No, your partner’s got a point. I just...  I just wish I didn’t feel like such an idiot for marrying David in the first place.”
John had pleaded with his uncle to do the same, but Andrew Watson had a hard head, little patience and no respect for his late brother’s wishes.  He’d paid off the creditors out of his own funds, but his price for doing so was to yank John out of medical school (“waste of money!”) and assign him to a clerk’s desk in one of the company warehouses.
“At least I know it’s not you, mate,” Lestrade told John over coffee. “If you wanted to shoot Sherlock, you had plenty of chances before this.”
“As if I’d like to explore it in a different context,” John admitted.
“Is that for me?” John asked teasingly.
“Unlike his officers, Lestrade’s not entirely useless.  Do you have it?”
“A safe assumption.”
“If that’s so, I’ll find it out for myself eventually.”
“Do you find it lonely, living all the way out here?” Ivan asked her.  “It’s a bit far from the nearest town or even village.”
The man stared at him thoughtfully for a moment and then appeared to change tack.  “If you
They turned off the lights and went upstairs. Bright moonlight filled the small room. Sherlock stripped without bothering to draw the curtains, and the light made his pale skin glow. Long arms, long legs. Long lean body – and their daughter in his pouch.
“I know who they are,” snapped Campbell-Williams. “I read the papers.  And I would hope, Detective Inspector Lestrade, that you haven’t called in your celebrity consultant for the sole purpose of reassuring us that the police are
No response from the sofa.  John figured he’d give Sherlock one more day with the livers, then return them to Molly himself.  In the meantime, his own breakfast had not been skimpy.  Between him and Sherlock, they were now out of several items that needed to be restocked.  He could drop Sherlock’s coat and scarf at the dry-cleaners on the way.
“What is it?” asked Mary.
“And that works.”
“Girlfriend?  No, not really my area.  Look at this.  Two previous similar cases.  Both corpses had particulate matter in their nostrils.  Molly, can I see the actual samples...  Where’s Molly?”
Sherlock was warm and surprisingly comfortable to hold for someone composed so completely of planes and angles. John, who had had sex with men before but had never cuddled one, reflected that they both had things to learn.
“Only if Sherlock manages to figure out how to throw me.”
, buying Bramleys that would never see the inside of an oven.
“You mean stalked him. Look, John, do you honestly see Sherlock Holmes letting himself by stalked by the likes of Anderson? Sherlock would either tell him off or – more likely – set him on a false trail to, I dunno. Big Ben, maybe.”
“Yes you can, love, come on now,” and with a high, fierce cry, Sherlock did.  Ivan stroked him through it, stopping only when Sherlock reached down to bat his hand away.  Then Ivan cradled Sherlock against him, letting the other man catch his breath.
There was a pause.
He indicated the rest of the graffiti covering the walls of the lab, not equations but political slogans written in blue and green. John recognized a few from the protest signs he’d seen on the telly.
“He’s brilliant and gorgeous, you can’t argue that. And you didn’t
Married to his work, thought John, arranging himself for sleep more comfortably, but sleeping in my bed.
Christ. It was as good as a marriage vow – except that it ran only one way, from Sherlock to John and Mary. It was as if Sherlock thought that he had no right to expect or even ask anything from them in return. Then and there, John made a quiet vow of his own. Somehow, he’d make his friend understand just how wrong he was.
When Mrs Holmes looked up from the photo and discovered John watching Sherlock and Mr Holmes, she leaned closer. “Sweet, aren’t they?” she whispered. “Timothy’s over the moon, but don’t tell him I told you.”
“So what’s the point of all this?” demanded Mary. “Is this your way of telling me you’re not going to carry my child after all? Bit late for that.”
“She thinks the birthmother is one of your homeless network,” John told him.
It wasn’t a pre-meditated kiss. It was just that Sherlock was right there and smiling at something John had said and that his lips looked softer than Miranda Caustlin’s and that John wondered what they’d feel like against his own.  So he kissed Sherlock and then he kissed him again and then Sherlock started to kiss John back, which was brilliant.
John took another sip and then set his mug down. “Does taking me to lunch at a hidden, secret café constitute a date?”
Shezza? God, no!  He’d be all too likely to forget what he was doing in a drug-induced haze and bite down.  And yet...  John found himself imagining Sherlock on his knees, dressed in Shezza’s ragged layers, looking up through his lashes with clear, knowing eyes.  Not Shezza, but Sherlock Holmes playing the
On the other side of the capital, a lone man slipped quietly out the eastern gate.  His clothes were such as a gentleman of modest means might wear, of decent enough quality but not at all striking in appearance.  His sword bore a plain hilt and a sharp edge.  He carried a pair of battered saddle bags and a walking stick of carved apple wood.
Sherlock’s idea of “making camp” appeared to consist of depositing Ivan at the bottom of a tree before flying up to perch on one of the lower branches.  When no further action appeared to be forthcoming, Ivan asked, “Is it safe to make a small fire?”
“He was already 20. It was reasonable that he would have information of his own on the subject.”
“Damn,” muttered John, “She’s standing between me and my bedroom.”
John was on the verge of standing up and leaving when the door opened again to admit... Mary?
“Certainly.  The doctor who examined me afterwards didn’t know whether to be horrified or impressed.  Of course, this was partly due to my own acting skills.”
“Go to sleep, then. I need to think by myself and work things out.”
“Not by then. His wife had passed on.”
“Tall and maybe-not-ginger?”
“By your skill set, Mary, you are – or
“Or usually bought, almost three years ago.”
“You mean you guessed.”
Sherlock eyed her. “Define ‘really important.’”
Silence from the kitchen.
Sara was still watching him, but there was no time to explain even if he’d had an explanation to offer.  He saluted her with his bloody sword, then turned and ran to the keep’s main door.  To his relief, it was unlocked.  Cautiously, he pulled it slightly ajar and slipped inside.
, I need a place to sleep.  This sofa will do fine.”
And a moment later:
“No, a thief.  I was able to prove that at the time a particularly vicious triple murder had been committed in Maymaksanskiy okrug, he’d been burgling a house in Novadvinsk.  Instead of being executed, he got off with branding.”
“Finally,” muttered Sherlock. One of the students giggled.  Sherlock began to sift through the debris of the lab, apparently at random.  The students and the junior officer seemed eager to give him as much room as they could.
.  Then he opened his eyes and looked at John, who more or less fell on top of him and
watch your mouth!  I heard Nelly Markham the next block over already put a complaint about you into the Committee not even a month ago.  You want another complaint filed, you just keep talking.”
“You mean when you got me in that hold and kept me from getting away? “ Tyler put in. “Can you teach me to do that?”
Wait.
“She left ‘em all behind, Vanya,” Harrieta had slurred.  “Might as well use ‘em for food and lodging along the way.  Get ‘em out of my sight.”
“His subsequent books were complete flops. It was as if he’d written the one story he had in him.  Meanwhile, my own career was getting on nicely for reasons that had everything to do with my own hard work and nothing to do with him.  He became rather less supportive of me, and I, well, I wasn’t very good at being supportive of him.  I did
“Hamish William for a boy, then,” said Mary. “What if it’s a girl?”
“Possibly. Molly, did you remove any material from the lacerations?”
“Right, then. These gentlemen are consultants with the Yard, Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson.”
“There was no case, it was death by incompetence.” Sherlock turned away slightly as he hiked his nursing tunic up a bit to slip Madeleine into his pouch.
“That sounds familiar.”
Ivan checked the sack and distributed more food: bread and apples, along with a pot of soft cheese.  When Sara thanked him for it, he shrugged.  “We’re all in this together.  I’ve got a sackful of food and a sword.  Someone else obviously has a knack for building campfires.”
“Let me guess. You also asked Mycroft.”
Sherlock stirred.  “Oh.  John.  You can turn off the torch now.”
“Yeah, I’m more interested in a good end.”
Their quarry not being immediately visible, Sherlock waved John towards a table, swept off to the bar and returned with two scotch-and-sodas. “I don’t know how long we’ll be.  If you finish yours, you can start on mine.”
But by the time it was ready, Mycroft had left. Sherlock absently accepted a cup of tea, smiling slightly. “My brother has a curious blind spot concerning you, John.”
“He was holding a knife to you and the first thing you thought of was
“Nothing
“All right, what the bloody hell was that about?” demanded John.
John felt it was time to step in when he heard Sherlock crow triumphantly, “Synthetic hormones!”
“Right, thanks,” John finished.
John had barely got used to Sherlock luring him to bed (or vice versa) for sex. Hearing Sherlock’s words now made his heart feel almost painfully full.
By the time they returned home, John’s arms were aching from his load of books.  Sherlock had refused to carry any in his arms, although he did jam a few smaller volumes into the pockets of his coat.
“Case in point,” said Mr Holmes. And then with a sly look, “Ten quid says Sherlock’s jacket smells of cigarette smoke when he comes back in.”
“John!  John Watson!”
“Sleep as much as you like.  I won’t.”
Once again proving that there is no honour among either thieves or kidnappers, Curran and Ives were quite ready to rat out their employer, an extremist pro-bond group called the Soldiers of Fate.
“No, I said that his curse trapped me in that form.  Without my heart, I couldn’t switch back and forth as I had always done.  And as now I can do once more.  Ivan...”  Ivan felt the rumble of Sherlock’s whisper in his ear, the vibration of Sherlock’s chest against his back.  “Ivan, I can still take you flying.”
volunteering to marry a commoner!  Why should I?” demanded Harrieta.
“A bit, yes.   A bit in, a bit out, then a bit in again.”
The beautiful stranger stepped aside and gestured more or less in the direction of the sofa.  The room was a bit of a tip, with piles of paper strewn everywhere.  There was a bison skull wearing headphones hanging from one wall and another skull, human, on the mantelpiece.
“Are you, then?  I’ve a mind to marry, myself,” Ivan confided.
Sherlock smiled then, genuine and warm in a way that made John feel a bit giddy. He got hold of himself and continued.  “I meant the bit about my ‘societally-endorsed objection with colour change.’”
John stared at his room. There were... boxes.  Not all that many, and on investigation they appeared to contain nothing more dangerous than the remainder of John’s things.  But they had definitely not been there when he’d left Baker Street for work that morning.
(See the end of the chapter for
She gave John a cheeky smile and then headed for the exit. At the door, she turned, smiled at him again and then left.
“Of course, dear, but have you
“Yes, love, I’m here.”
“Your father wants a princess, but what do you want?  Fair to look at, everyone wants that whether in a wife
“That’s amazing!”
John whistled softly.  “Someone’s gone to a great deal of trouble to kill these people.”
“You think the shooter’s still at large, then.”
The three men were just finishing their tea when the bedroom door opened and out came Mrs Holmes, followed by... Mrs Holmes.
John fell asleep breathing the scent in.
Inside, the keep was dim, cool and eerily silent.  There was no one in sight – no guards, no servants, no courtiers.  As Ivan hunted for a route that would take him to the north tower, he began to realize that what he’d derided as sloppiness in the security arrangements was rather the supreme confidence of a powerful sorcerer who could rely on his magic alone for protection.  Trying to ignore the chills this thought gave him, he continued to try this corridor and that, eventually discovering a winding staircase that he was fairly sure ascended the north tower.  He was about to start climbing when the ever-so-slight noise of fabric sliding against fabric caught his attention.  He spun about, sword at the ready, but no one was in sight.  However, he noticed that the stairs led down as well as up.
“We won’t be exiting by the usual door.  Hurry, this way!”  Ivan followed Sherlock out of the hall and through a tangle of corridors, struggling to keep up with the other’s longer, claw-footed strides.  “Your friend Sanka wishes you luck, by the way.”
He faced Sherlock and felt his jaw flex, the muscles of his throat begin to move.  “Why did you leave Victor behind?” he heard someone ask – and the questioner had his voice.  Muircheartaigh was using Ivan as a mouthpiece, and Ivan was powerless to stop him.
“Let alone checking behind bins for overshoes used to mask footprints,” John replied drily.  “Obviously
wouldn’t.”
“John.”
Sherlock stopped pacing, stared at her, then threw himself at John’s laptop and began typing.
“Canada or the United States?”
I loathe repeating myself.”
In the meantime, John went to work each day. He stopped for groceries and take-away on the way back to Baker Street so that he’d have something to eat and if he bought a bit extra, it was only because it seemed polite.  He tidied up around the flat, partly so that Mrs Hudson wouldn’t have to and partly because Greg’s tip remark had stung.  He’d got out of the habit of taking care of things like that and needed practice, so he was practicing on Sherlock’s flat, that was all.
But when Andreyev turned red and lowered his eyes, they all realized that Sherlock’s words, however cruel, had been true.  None knew what to say until Tyuleneva broke the awkward silence.  “It’s a trick he uses, to make his suitors feel ashamed that they might bend more easily to his supposedly greater genius.  He told me that I had been driven to learn to fight because my father killed my mother in a drunken rage.  As if everyone in my village didn’t already know that!”
“How would that even work?” retorted Mary. “By the time children are born, they need more nutrition than the placenta can supply. What would they be living on for the extra months?”
“We leave the subconscious to the psychologists, Dr Watson. Ask yourself this: how do chemical reactions in one person’s brain – which is all that emotions are – affect the chromochemical reactions on another person’s wrist?  How is that information transmitted?”
He could be a complete dickhead.
“And he told you to piss off?” John suggested, smiling.
Mary sniffed once and then put her shoulders back. “Right,” she repeated, and walked out the door, followed by Mr Holmes with the suitcase.
John took his new phone back into the kitchen to play with while he ate his supper.  There was one number already programmed in.  It was labeled “SH.”
“Okay. You’ll have a sore throat and a lovely necklace of bruises for the next several days, but your hyoid bone is whole and there doesn’t seem to be any other serious damage. Have we learned anything from this experience?”
John slammed down his pint and followed.
Marfa Hudovna beamed.  “In that case, dear, I think I may be able to help you.  But you should get some sleep now, because you’ll need to be up tomorrow before dawn and I don’t know when you’ll next get a chance to rest after that.”
“You might want to confirm that with Mrs Hudson before you go any further. Remember the time you used my gun to ‘modify’ the wall?”
“It’s not your fault, Mum. It’s the ambulance people’s, for not getting there fast enough.  And... it’s mine, too.  If I could’ve figured out better what to do, with the poker or Uncle Don’s meds or going to the university or, really,
“He doesn’t mean it, he just doesn’t think, well, no, that’s not right.  He thinks all the time!  But about corpses and crimes, not things like...”
“This is a matter...”
“Well, most people, er,
Now Lestrade looked puzzled.  “So I take it you weren’t there to visit her?”
“In amarsupials, the chorioallantoic placenta develops further into a sort of filter that directly connects the mother’s bloodstream with the child’s.”
There was no tube connecting the plane to the terminal, as John had grown accustomed to in Canada.  In fact, there was no terminal.  The passengers descended a set of portable stairs directly to the tarmac.  There were no other planes, only a rather shabby looking air tower and a clutch of what appeared to be storage buildings.
“Gave it a good feeling up, did you?” asked John sharply.
,” Sherlock protested, “More
“...easier for you to do it.”
Sherlock ducked under the yellow tape without hesitation and led the way down the alley alongside the shop, John following.  “Wilson lived above his shop.  He wouldn’t have wanted to go through the shop every time he went in or out, so there must be...  Ah, here we are.”
“And then
“Don’t feel sorry for me,” Tyuleneva snapped.  “I’m a fighter, and I went down fighting.  You’re so keen to hear stories, you should ask Andreyev his.  No one thinks much of him, but he’s not a fighter.  He never should have come here at all, but he’s survived.  He was bespelled longer than I was, but he outlasted some who came after me.  They didn’t survive, he did.”
John stared. Sherlock met his gaze. John was the first to look away – and towards Mary. “We need privacy to discuss this.
“Not yet.”
“Him and enough tea to float the Navy, that’s what’s been here,” she retorted.  “You bring that tray and pot back downstairs yourself, young man.  My hip’s had more than enough of these stairs for one evening!”  With that, she made her way out again.
“So, ah, Sherlock. I heard you were in the hospital for bit?”
“This would be the brother who’d rather exile you himself than call on political favours?  I’m not impressed with him.”
, but fine.
