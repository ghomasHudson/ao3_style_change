“Mostly,” he responded airily, leaping to his feet. “Well. I don’t know about you, but I could do with a bit of breakfast.” John scrambled to his feet at the thought of warm baked bread and cooked food with fresh vegetables.
“I knew I’d need something more powerful than a handheld weapon like a bow or slingshot, so I examined the crossbows and catapults on the towers by the harbor when no one was looking; it was easy enough to figure out how they worked. Then I stole all of the tools I needed from Philip’s forge, and I cut the wood from a redwood tree that fell in the western forest. I made a smaller model with a net of twine and practiced with it – I caught an owl, a raven, and even an eagle. I let them go afterwards, of course, though I did study them a bit first. I wrote everything down if you’re ever interested. Anyway, I knew I needed to make this one light enough to be portable, but large enough to support a net strong enough to catch a dragon. I still haven’t worked out the best way to move it around – it’s not heavy, it’s just a bit awkward, and I need to be able to position it quickly. See, it’s built on a swivel base for better aim, but I don’t know how I’m going to get it out of this hollow.”
He’d skirted the west side of the island, where the cliffs arced into a sheer rocky mountainside and then descended back into steep, dense forest, and started heading back east along the north side when a sudden thought occurred to him. The night fury was clearly avoiding water, so what would it do when it arrived at the falls? Sherlock could already hear the faint roaring of the falling water up ahead. The stream flowing into the ocean was fairly wide and deep – too wide for the dragon to cross, based on the gaps he’d observed between its footprints when it had attempted to fly. Confined by the ocean on one side and the steep, tangled forest on the other, the dragon’s choices were limited; stop and rest, attempt to sear the forest with fire to clear a path towards the center of the island, or –
“Oh gods yes,” John laughed with a grin, and they took off through the forest towards the village in the gray of twilight.
Gradually, the trees thinned out and he emerged onto the rocky, grass-swept hills that defined the east side of Berk. He could see wisps of gray smoke puffing over the horizon; that meant the raging fires of the night before had all been tamed, and the village was returning to its normal habits, starting up the cooking fires and keeping the forge fires alive and ready. He remembered one afternoon when he’d been out exploring and the dragons had attacked; when he’d returned, he’d seen columns of black smoke billowing up from the village, and he’d known instantly what had happened. One of the nice things about dragons was that they were fairly predictable; after the attack last night, it was unlikely they’d be back for fortnight at the very least. Scrambling down into a shallow valley between two hills swathed in gorse and heather, Sherlock paused to drink deeply from a cold spring that bubbled out from a crack between the rocks and pooled in a shallow dip before sinking back into the earth. He could never stand drinking the well water in the village; it tasted too gritty and stale. Drinking spring water, though, felt like drinking life.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, cutting him off the moment he heard a trace of uncertainty in his voice, because he wanted him to know that he was a part of it all now, that he had a place in Berk even if it wasn’t the one he expected to come back to. “It’s not far from here, actually. I had to hide it a ways off the main path in case anyone came out this far hunting.”
“What do we do now?” John asked as he let him go. The two friends stared at each other, ruffled and sand-covered, still half-dazed from the chaotic string of events that had just occurred.
“Yeah, well, thank the gods you’re above all that,” John replied, eyeing the village chief’s ax warily. It was a beautiful weapon, taller than himself, shimmering brighter than a dragon’s scales, honed sharper than a griffin’s beak, undoubtedly heavier than it looked; but Mycroft held it with such grace and ease it might as well have been a palm frond. He bit back a laugh at the thought of Mycroft, in the full splendor of his Viking chief’s robes, the very image of the fierce northman, threateningly waving around a palm frond. He’d have to tell Sherlock… whenever he saw him next. What
The days passed in a blur. Hot summer afternoons toiling over the dragon-catching net in the shade of the redwood forest; cool evenings exploring every corner of Berk, picking blackberries and digging for fossils in the sandy banks of the stream, furnishing their hollow tree with carved treestump stools and a small table and stocking it with stolen nonperishable foodstuffs, knitted blankets, and even books and games to make their rainstorm retreats more pleasant; climbing to the highest rocky peak on the island at midnight to scan the skies for dragons with Sherlock’s spyglass; staying awake into the wee hours of the night, sitting on one or the other’s bed in Martha’s house, exchanging stories from the long years when they’d been apart.
“Yeah. Yeah, alright,” he agreed, surprised at himself. Just because they’d been so close before didn’t mean they still were now. It was dangerous to expect that, dangerous to get used to the idea of having a friend again. But he couldn’t stop himself from following John into the hollow redwood, which was the size of a small house.
“That was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” John gasped out mirthfully.
“Are we done?”
“John? Johnny boy?” His father coughed, a thick, disgusting sound that make the back of John’s neck prickle. His mind was reeling. He’d thought things were bad when he left; he’d never imagined they could be so much worse.
“You’ll just have to sleep in tents until the new house is built. Find Captain Lestrade when you get back to the village, he’ll provide you with them.” His dismissal was obvious. Fighting his growing rage and panic, John gave him a curt nod and strode past him, and though he didn’t look back, he saw the dancing light of a fire glowing brighter and brighter behind him, casting his own shadow long before him as Mycroft set fire to the dragoncatcher.
“I have to fix this,” Sherlock whispered, and before John could stop him he shrugged out of his shirt and darted away from his friend’s grasp, drawing a knife from his belt and kneeling next to the jet black dragon, cutting through the net in every place he could reach. Just when the last strand snapped free, the creature before him shifted –
There was something unnaturally quiet about the island, what with the entire village down by the ship. Cooking fires smoked lazily from a few of the houses that came into view as John reached the top of the cliffs. Some looked old and familiar; a few were made of freshly chiseled stone, darker wood and brighter thatch, a testament to the time he’d been away. Scorch marks blackened the bare earth of the village square as he passed through, wondering at how small it all felt. It seemed impossible that all of the people of the island could crowd together in this tiny square for important meetings, when the palace of the royal family of the Verland Isles would have obliterated the whole village if a dragon had dropped it down on top. And speaking of dragons… it was strange to see so much evidence of their existence, when his last blurry, dreamlike memories of them dated back nine years. He could see countless places where their fire had seared his surroundings; beneath his feet he saw the indentations of footprints so large he could have curled up inside them. He could see clawmarks on doorframes and poison blue tail darts from a Deadly Nadder embedded in a roof. Bits and pieces of his dragon training floated through his mind as he tried to identify each piece of evidence and recall each species by name. With an uncomfortable jolt, he realized he’d have to go into training again if he wanted to be of any use fighting against the dragons during an attack; while his battle skills had been honed to near perfection on their voyage, dealing with dragons was nothing like dealing with pirates. He wondered if they’d throw him into the training ring with the seven-year-olds, who would no doubt be better at everything than him. His mood worsening, he kicked at a loose flat pebble on the ground, watching it skitter across the lane. It flashed unnaturally in the sun. Peering down at it, he suddenly realized it wasn’t a stone, but a dragon scale. Slate gray, diamond shaped, and about the size of his palm, it had knife-sharp edges and a glassy glint to it that he found oddly appealing and foreboding all at once. Slipping it into his pocket, he strode on, grimly determined to move past the strange emptiness of the day.
“John!” Sherlock whispered loudly as he crept up the stairs and into the hall outside their bedrooms. He peeked in through the open door to John’s room, but his bed was empty. “John?” No movement, no sound. John definitely wasn’t there. Sighing in disappointment and trying to push away new worries that clawed at him, he stole into his own room and shut the door. It took him a second to realize that he was not alone. Cursing himself for his slow wits, he peered at the form that was splayed out on his bed, breathing slow and deep.
“Yeah, all right. What do you need me to do?”
And still Sherlock wanted to say more, to tell him that he had his own selfish reasons for wanting John to be careful and safe; that if something happened to John, Sherlock had already given him so much of himself, he didn’t know what might happen to him. All he knew was that he couldn’t bear the thought of never seeing him again, and there was always that chance, however slight, that when sailors stepped onto their ships they might never step off again.
After drinking in his fill of the tranquil summer night scenery, John – who seemed unfazed by their previous exertion – took off his own vest and sat next to Sherlock, keeping his eyes fixed on the horizon as he scanned for dragons. The candle snuffed out in a playful gust of wind, and neither moved to light it again. It struck Sherlock how much John had changed since they’d played together as children, how he now carried the shadowed weight of a soldier somewhere within him, though he was careful to hide it on the surface. He’d seen battle, and death, and faced it himself; he’d said goodbye to his sister in a foreign land, he’d returned to a home where his mother was dead and his father was fading away, and now here he was, on a peaceful hilltop, watching, waiting, yearning for
“Promise me you’ll be careful when you’re gone,” Sherlock said suddenly, desperately. It was a strange reversal of roles; John was usually the one making him promise to be careful, not the other way around.
“I’ve got to get going,” John said finally, looking sad and resigned as he stood up and took their empty bowls and spoons to the washbasin in the corner. “I’ve still got a few things left to do this afternoon, and I have to pack.”
did just return yesterday, after all. What did you think Martha was making all of those pies for?”
“None at all, John.”
“The night fury,” he rasped, his throat raw from swallowing saltwater. “Where is it?”
John was fast asleep, spread out across the blanket holding his pillow in one arm.
John smiled brighter than the sun.
“I see. So he was not successful?” Mycroft queried, watching him intently.
The creature reappeared once more, but this time it wasn’t alone. The night fury thrashed in the water before it, blue lightning crackling over its body as the water fought with its inner fire; it must have inhaled seawater. Its powerful limbs tore at the net, but it was too tangled to fully escape, and the water dragon was gaining on it.
“Five days,” Sherlock told him despairingly as he dumped a basket of fish at the dragon’s feet; Toothless gave his face a slobbery lick before diving into his breakfast
“As the village chief, I am obligated to maintain peace and balance among the villagers, which means that Sherlock and his mischief are of very high concern. As his brother, it is my duty to ensure his… well-being. I would be willing to offer you a significant sum of money…”
“Of course it was.” Sherlock smiled tentatively and turned to look into the morning sunlight with a far-off gaze.
“I’m finding them very well, sir. It’s not that difficult to do when the entire village is only a hundred steps across.” Mycroft stared at him as though concerned that John had seriously misinterpreted his question, but he said nothing about it.
John felt a mixture pity and anger rising in his throat. He had obviously drunk his way through the battle; he wasn’t even wearing armor, just dirty nightclothes. He looked so frail and broken; the detached part of John wanted to help him and comfort him, but the rest of him felt his anger burning even brighter. He owed this man nothing. Nine years apart had allowed John to break the ties and grow into his own person, to heal as much as he could from the traumas of his childhood, and he knew he could only be himself if he left his father – and Berk – behind for good. But as he’d told Sherlock before, he was going to leave on his own terms. He would go to the Verland Isles at Mycroft’s request. He would compete in the tournament, fail to win, and return at the end of the season. And then he would come back for Sherlock. He had no idea how to ask him to leave the island with him, was terrified that he would say no; but after so long a separation their bond seemed stronger than ever, and he couldn’t imagine a future without him.
“It’s nothing that need concern you…”
“And I’ve got to go check on Toothless,” Sherlock said gloomily. It wasn’t that he didn’t enjoy spending time with the dragon - on the contrary, he enjoyed it very much - it was just that he was reluctant to end their unexpected rendezvous. “Will I… can I still see you tonight?”
“John, wait!” Sherlock gasped, grabbing his friend’s arm as they skidded to a stop on the wet sand. “That… wasn’t a night fury.”
“Martha, we will take the rooms upstairs,” Sherlock sang out as he and John slipped in through the back door, this time careful to avoid tripping over the sacks of flour. “Excellent pies at the celebration, by the way,” he added, stepping into the warmly lit kitchen to find Martha scrubbing the counters as she cleaned up for the night.
“Yeah. Right again. How…”
“Well. For that, I am grateful. But I don’t think you realize the full extent of what you’ve done. You see, it may have slipped your mind that when the dragons attack, our entire village is endangered. Our warriors are wounded, our families and children are threatened, our homes go up in flames. Which is why we expect everyone able to wield a weapon to be there during the battle. The both of you ought to have been there, fighting alongside the rest of us.”
Together they turned to scan the shore. There, fifty feet down the beach, a dark mass lay unmoving on the sand. Sherlock broke into a run, fear rising like bile in his throat, but John grabbed his shirt and forcefully tugged him back.
One of its tail flaps had been torn away in the fight and was bleeding all over the ground. The two friends stared for a few long moments, waiting for something to happen, but the night fury didn’t move.
“How’d you manage that, anyway?” John asked him, and he sounded a bit breathless - or had Sherlock just imagined it?
“You think so?”
“Then what’s next? Do you intend to marry? You’re certainly of age, there are several eligible young women who might strike your fancy, everyone settles down for a bit of domestic bliss sooner or later.”
“Okay, good point. But… I thought you didn’t go in for that sort of thing?”
John was fairly certain he would spend every waking moment with his friend if given the chance, but returning to the island meant he had duties like everyone else, so most of his mornings were devoted to dragon training with Angelo and Lestrade. All of the voyagers, regardless of age and experience, had returned to the dragon ring to hone their skills. His earlier fears of falling behind the younger children dissipated quickly as his muscles instantly recalled how to wield each weapon and he brushed away the dust in his memory that had settled over his knowledge of dragon species. A quick skim through the
There was a long silence. “I like to imagine she’s feasting in Valhalla now,” his father said sadly. “She was meant to be a warrior, you know. Not a wife, not a mother. I took her away from her destiny. I see that now.” But John was hardly listening. Valhalla? Did he really mean to say that she was –
Out of sight of the others, John stopped and let his anger rise to the surface. Incomplete, painful half-formed thoughts questions chased each other through his mind. He knew he had been ignoring his father since returning to Berk, and part of him felt immensely guilty for it; but the rest of him had felt liberated by the realization that he owed nothing to the man. And yet, here he was, tasked with rebuilding his home, a less-than-subtle attempt on Mycroft’s part at forcing their reconciliation. But John didn’t want reconciliation. He didn’t need to be reminded of the yelling, the breaking, the stench of drink, the sound of Harry screaming and crying, the frightened and sympathetic glances of neighbors who knew but did nothing. Just thinking about it made him feel physically ill. But there was no arguing with Mycroft. The sooner he got this over with, the better. Then he could go back to the way things were before.
“Of course we – er, I’ll get it right now,” John reassured her, as Sherlock was already bolting up the stairs two at a time, leaving his friend to clean up their mess; he could feel John’s exasperated glare burning into the back of his neck. It was after midnight – normally Martha would be asleep, but there was extra cleaning to do after the big celebration. Most of the village was drunk or asleep, but Sherlock was on
“Hello, John,” Mycroft greeted him smoothly, though his eyes were trained on the spot where Sherlock had disappeared behind a tall, crumbling lichen-splotched boulder. “He does tend to be rather dramatic, does he not?”
told me to look after him. Just because I was gone for nine years doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten what he’s like. When he has an idea, there’s no stopping him from trying to make it work. Besides, it was a pretty brilliant idea. I thought it was best to help him and stay with him to keep him safe like you asked. I did drag him out of the ocean tonight, after all.”
They taught him how to handle a gun, how to throw a knife, how to wield a sword; they told him stories of pirate attacks, historic battles on the Mainland, duels and feuds between renowned knights. But the violence had never felt real until the moment the first cannon had slammed into the hull of
“He’s leaving tomorrow,” Sherlock told Toothless, perching on a mossy boulder as the night fury gulped fish directly out of the basket. “He’s leaving tomorrow, and I think… I think he wanted to kiss me.” Toothless looked up at him in surprise, the basket hanging comically off of his nose, but Sherlock hardly noticed. “He’s leaving tomorrow and I think I’m in love with him.” The basket fell to the ground, and Toothless warbled in sympathy, watching as the human he had come to love and trust wrapped his arms around his knees and cried.
“Oh gods,” Lestrade muttered as he rummaged through a pile of emergency supplies. “Well, it’s a good thing he has you looking after him. Right, here you go. Now, I believe your father is still back by the old house; last I saw him he wouldn’t budge. Best go and see to him. Come find me if you need anything.”
“Hello, John,” his friend replied with an anxious half-smile. “I didn’t know how to wake you. It sounded like quite an awful nightmare.”
“And how are you…
“Hey,” John murmured back, watching him intently as he stirred the soup rhythmically. “You’ve, um, you’ve got something on your nose.”
But this ship was heading straight for the harbor, and the black crest on the sail was growing sharper: a fabled night fury. His heart leapt into his throat – that was the ship he’d watched his parents sail away on. But where were The Deadly Nadder and The Bewilderbeast? Just as quickly as his hopes had soared, they plummeted into his stomach as fast as the water crashing to the rocky beach on the northern shore. If they’d lost two ships, then they’d lost crew as well… Torn between a burning desire to know and an icy fear of knowing, Sherlock scrambled down the hill, ignoring the gorse thorns that tore at his trousers as he returned to the village in record time. He dimly registered the great horn blowing its deep, resonant breath – someone in the village had seen the ship. Past the houses, past the forge, past the village square, the other people around him blurring into meaningless forms, he raced for the cliffs, his feet clattering across the wooden plank switchback paths that led to the harbor. He was dimly aware of voices calling his name, telling him to slow down, to stop, to wait, but he didn’t seem to be in control of his body, which continued hurtling down, down, down, until the sound of the gentle waves lapping against wood and the dormant boats bumping gently against the docks and the cries of curious gulls drowned out the other sounds. He reached the end of the dock and might have dived straight into the gray-blue depths if he hadn’t felt a hand fall gently on his shoulder, jolting him back to reality.
“I can see it in the way you hold yourself. It gives you phantom pain in your leg, doesn’t it?”
And suddenly they were both laughing, and it was breathless and shaky and unbelievable but so incredibly real, and Sherlock couldn’t stop staring at John, who was leaning against him and giggling uncontrollably.
“Of course. You must know by now that this island is too small for me, and I’ve seen the way you look out at the sea, like you miss all the adventures you had. And… to be quite honest... I can’t imagine a future without you in it.” He sounded endearingly embarrassed.
“What are you doing? Are you crazy?” John yelled back, panic in his voice.
“Well. One of us should go back and hide the dragoncatcher,” Sherlock decided out loud, “while the other needs to follow the dragon and make sure it’s not getting into trouble. We can’t let the other villagers find it, or they’re bound to try to kill it. At least if they find the machine, we can get away with a half-truth – that we wanted to catch a dragon – without letting on that it worked.”
It seemed pretty implicit that Mycroft wanted him to stay with his father at all times until the new house was built, but he’d promised to meet Sherlock at Martha’s later, and he had to find out how everything went with the dragon. The more he thought about it, the more worried he became; what if something had gone wrong (again)? Would Sherlock really be reasonably careful? Even wounded, the night fury could be a deadly foe. He forced himself to remember that Sherlock had managed nine years of getting into dangerous situations without him, but somehow he suspected nothing had ever been quite
“Here,” John said, spooning out a piece of carrot, “let that cool and tell me if it’s ready.” Sherlock blew on it until it stopped steaming and took it carefully in his mouth in case it was still hot on the inside. He tried to ignore how intimate the moment was, with John standing so close to him, feeding him, gazing at him.
“I told you not to scare me like that again,” John replied hoarsely before pulling him into a bruising hug. Sherlock was momentarily transported back to the day – it seemed like ages ago now – when he’d tumbled down the hill next to the waterfall and the hollow tree to land at John’s feet, when he’d first remembered the friend he’d been missing for nine years, when John had smiled at him and hugged him. It was just as surprising now as it was then, but this time he reached back, grateful for something to hold on to.
my brother?” Okay. What on
“Of course,” John said softly.
Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat. He looked so soft and vulnerable; his mouth was slightly open, his eyelids fluttered, his loosely curled left hand twitched as though he were dreaming of holding on to something. He’d kicked his shoes off and left them by the door. Sherlock remembered the night when John had admonished him for leaving his boots on in the bedroom, the way he’d stared and stared at his friend’s face, and now here he was with nothing in between them but Sherlock’s own hammering heart. Sidling closer, he sat down on the mattress as slowly as possible to avoid waking him. He knew that nine years of voyaging had left John a light sleeper alert to any possibility of danger, and that if he wasn’t careful he might startle John awake and receive an automatic blow to the face. But he couldn’t help it, couldn’t help seizing the opportunity to memorize the sound of his breathing, to examine the way the moonlight glinted on his eyelashes. He reached out his fingertips and held them, trembling, in front of John’s parted lips, wanting to know what his warm breath would feel like. And there was so much more he wanted to know. Were his cheeks as soft and smooth as they looked? What would his hair feel like under his hands - smooth like fine sand, or coarse and rough like dry autumn leaves? John stirred suddenly, and he snatched his hand away, feeling a bit dazed. He wasn’t sure what was happening to him. He’d never been so drawn to anyone or anything before. It made him feel dangerously out of control - and he loved it.
had been tangled in it, and Mycroft’s sharp eye might notice that the strands had been cut by a knife and not a dragon’s claws.
“John,” Mycroft greeted him coolly, but he thought he detected an undercurrent of worry. “I presume you were with my brother.”
“You were?” John breathed, looking up at him, no longer hiding his face in Sherlock’s cloak, straining to see his friend’s expression in the dark.
“Oh, I don’t,” Sherlock agreed, his eyes gleaming dangerously. “But there’s always opportunities for mischief when the drink starts to flow, and I’m getting hungry, thought we could steal a pie or two, oh, I don’t know, stick poison ivy up Philip’s shirt, set fire to someone’s shoes, the usual. So. You coming?”
“Oh god yes,” John answered with a grin as they set off into the brightly lit summer forest, side by side after what felt like a lifetime of being apart, yet feeling closer than ever before.
John thanked him and headed up the hill away from the square with a bundled tent slung over each shoulder. Anxiety drummed in his chest; it reminded him of the sick, buzzing feeling he’d gotten when he drank coffee for the first time in the Verland Isles. This was exactly the same, an uncomfortable, uncontrollable nervousness that clawed at him so deeply he felt it in a painfully physical way. He tried to pretend he was hauling the tents into the forest to go adventuring with Sherlock (and for a heartbeat he contemplated doing just that), but he was too jittery to focus on the fantasy.
John stood at the ready with a stink bomb in a slingshot in his right hand in case they needed a diversion, his left hand tense on the lever of the dragon-catcher – it worked best when they coordinated the release of the net with two separate levers. Sherlock took his place at his side and snatched away the spyglass, searching for possible target. The dragons were swooping down towards the houses now, shooting fire at the thatch and wooden roofs. But then an eerie, chilling cry made him drop the spyglass and look up, higher, heart pounding – could it be?
The shifting and creaking of the wood around him brought him back into the present. The horror of his nightmare had faded, and now he simply felt exhausted, a stealthy anxiety gnawing at his chest. Lestrade expected to make landfall on Berk in two days. After nine years of limited communication, all they knew was that the dragon attacks had worsened, and the families who had remained were desperate for their help. No one was looking forward to sharing the news that after searching for so long and losing two ships and many lives, they hadn’t found the legendary dragonslayer, the ultimate object of their quest. At least
The last memory he allowed himself to reflect on before he entered the village was the moment when he’d given his knife to Sherlock. He’d thanked him so quietly, so softly; it had left a strange feeling in his chest – a desire to give him more, to see that look of genuine surprise and gratitude again. Perhaps it was a selfish desire, but it wasn’t easily banished.
“That… was brilliant. Quite extraordinary.”
Sherlock didn’t stay with Toothless for very long on that last day. Sherlock and John’s midnight meetings had been taking up more and more time as the two of them planned for John’s return in whispers, and he felt a pang of guilt for keeping John from getting his much needed sleep. He wouldn’t get much of a chance to rest on the ship either, since he was one of the most experienced shiphands on Berk after his nine-year voyage. But he still planned to meet him one more time that night, since it was unlikely they’d be able to talk in private when The Night Fury sailed at dawn, even if he went down to the docks to see John off; it would be too crowded and chaotic to say everything he wanted to say, and to give him the gift he’d prepared.
The drops of blood soon became spaced farther and farther apart, yet the dragon’s strides and attempts at flight appeared no less rigorous, which was encouraging. On and on he went, marveling at the night fury’s power and speed; judging by the marks, it could be more than halfway around the island by now. It was a chilling thought. He wondered if he should have circled around the
had never become home, either. Harry had been his home, and then she’d left him, slipping off the night before they departed Crescent Bay on the Mainland. That night too he remembered like a dream – the warm southern breeze tickling the fernlike fronds of the palm trees, the stars burning bright in the velvet indigo sky, the wild people of the port town dancing and laughing into the night. The place had a charming lull to it; every night the people were up until the wee hours of the morning, drinking and talking and searching for love and happiness; it was a kind of paradise, closed off from the hardships and horrors of the rest of the world, and Harry had fallen in love with it from the moment her feet touched the sand. And then she’d fallen in love with Clara, much to the shock and dismay of
After years of diving for interesting artifacts on the ocean floor, Sherlock was an excellent swimmer, perhaps the best on Berk. He cut through the water effortlessly, kicking off his shoes and shedding his tunic as he went, following the edge of the island away from it all, heading for the north side, where no one would think to look for him, at least not for a while, because of the rumors of dragons nesting there. Of course, he was the one responsible for the rumors because of the numerous fires he’d made, topped off with a handful of strategically whispered tales.
Soon he became aware that his father was muttering to himself. In spite of his reservations, John paused from hammering in one of the stakes to see if he could discern what he was talking about.
“Of course not.”
“And where is he?”
“Oh, don’t worry. We won’t have to. You see, the dragon-catching net isn’t the only thing I’ve been working on,” Sherlock told him brightly as they stepped out of the tree, John slipping his pack over his shoulders. “Catching a dragon won’t be enough; I’ll also need a sufficient diversion to ensure that no one else is watching me at the wrong moment. Mycroft would be furious if he knew what I was up to,” he added in a low conspiratorial voice. “So, I needed something explosive and harmless but distracting to both humans and dragons that I can set off at the key moment. At the same time, it can’t be anything that would be traced back to me. Want to see what I came up with?”
Instead he said, “You’re always worth waiting for, Sherlock,” and then turned and made his way back to his tent, forcing himself not to look back. It wasn’t until he was wrapped in blankets on top of his sleeping mat that he fully realized what had almost just happened. If he’d stayed standing there a heartbeat longer, he knew beyond doubt that he would have closed the distance between them and kissed him.
they could do to intervene. He couldn’t stand the idea that he might be responsible for the death of the night fury he’d brought down. “Sherlock, we should get out of here, this isn’t safe!” But he refused to budge when John tugged at his arm. He closed his eyes and pressed his face into his hands. Think.
“Your brother,” he growled, pacing around the clearing, keeping a good distance away from the equipment so as not to trip. “He’s up to something, I know he is. He’s sending me away.”
“Sherlock,” John finally said with faint amusement as he stood, abandoning his soup, and walked over to the stove. “You know you do actually have to stir that to keep it from burning, right?”
was that supposed to mean? He felt immediately suspicious.
that danced across John’s eyes? What was he thinking? Had he imagined it? Why couldn’t he just deduce him like he could with everyone else? “So, you’re not seeing anyone.” It sounded like a reaffirming statement, but Sherlock heard the underlying question plain as day.
“When you left Berk. I deleted you. Because I didn’t want you to be gone. I… didn’t like being alone.” Well, that was an understatement. “So I had to erase the memories of when I was happy, with you. But it turns out I didn’t really delete you. It all came back when I saw you at our hollow tree, the day you came home.”
“Sherlock, don’t be daft. You think I care more about this old thing than keeping you safe? Yeah, it’s a good knife, but – you know what? I want you to keep it. I’ve always thought it was lucky. Might be good for you. It’s about time I had a new one made anyway.”
to happen. Even if it was something dangerous, terrifying, thrilling. Suddenly John turned to him, as though hearing his thoughts, tilting his head questioningly.
“Why?”
Another boy stared back at him with unreadable stormy blue eyes, his knife hanging loosely at his side, his brow furrowed in a mixture of curiosity and concern. Sandy blond hair, a sailor’s tanned skin – but a part of him had known who it was the moment he’d first seen him.
It was almost dark before Sherlock registered that he ought to go back to the house, but the idea of being there now – bearing the weight of its oppressive emptiness on top of everything else – sent him deep into the forest, away from the orange glow of the village’s night fires. Mycroft would be busy welcoming back the voyagers, after all. He wouldn’t have time to run after his little brother. At least he hoped. He couldn’t face him right now, couldn’t uphold his fragile guise of uncaring if it were intruded upon by anything evoking emotion. But he was tired, and not fond of the idea of wandering in the dark forest alone at night, easy prey for a hunting dragon. He needed shelter. Struck by an idea, he changed course, circling around to the clearing where he’d tested dragonfire that afternoon. From there it was just a short trek to the hollow redwood tree by the falls. There was just enough light left to descend the slippery, mossy, spray-dampened path without risk of misstepping. He tried to ignore the insistent, acid pain in his stomach from not having eaten all day. His head was throbbing too; no matter how hard he pressed his hand to his forehead, the pain just seemed to build up worse. But a part of him embraced the physical pain, because he knew it would pass. He wasn’t so sure about the wounds inside him, the wounds that felt too deep to heal, the wounds that he’d wrapped up tightly and had now decided to ignore.
“And that involved abandoning this… machine to take a dip in the ocean in the middle of a battle?” His voice was icy calm.
“Hmm. Yes, yes! That could work.” Sherlock got down on his hands and knees and started crawling around the base, shifting it around so he could examine possible places of attachment. “Here, and here, and here… Hand me that, will you?” he demanded, pointing at a twisted metal rod. John sighed and walked across the clearing to where the tool sat in the sand, picking it up and carefully brushing it off before handing it to his friend. He plopped down on the ground to watch him work, hoping he wouldn’t get too much sand in his trousers.
about him? This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.
Mycroft stared at him pointedly, waiting for an answer. John sighed and closed his eyes, pressing his palms to his forehead. How exactly had he gotten into this situation? What did Mycroft really want? Why was Sherlock avoiding him so desperately?
The sun had just dipped below the horizon when Sherlock finished the wheels. There were two cleverly carved pieces of wood fitted together with drops of pine sap to ensure they wouldn’t break apart, and they spun on an axis so that they could easily twist and turn independently of each other when skittering over rough terrain. He’d also devised two handlebars to make the contraption easier to push along.
. He swallowed and tugged uncomfortably at his shirt. Why did he have to word it like that? He hadn’t meant to imply – well, anything. He should really just stop talking. Avoid other humans altogether. That sounded like a good solution.
Just another step, he told himself. And another, and another. And suddenly he was rounding the corner and there was his house – or what remained of it, anyway – a pile of smoldering wood and crumbled stone, collapsed in a pitiful heap, the moldy thatch burning in a falsely cheery way. He felt oddly triumphant, seeing the old wreck of a house finally defeated, but then he saw the tiny figure of his father folded in front of the flames, rocking back and forth. He couldn’t take another step. He didn’t know how long he stood there, staring; his mind went blank as he built wall upon wall around his heart, sealing his emotions inside. Reaching into his pocket, searching for some reassurance, his fingers closed around the dragon scale he’d picked up on his first day back. The memory of Sherlock’s impressive deductions flooded through him, and though he couldn’t quite smile, it was enough to get him moving again. Deciding it was easier to say nothing, he dropped his bags in the clearing in front of the collapsed house and started to set up the tents; he wondered how long it would take his father would notice.
“No, I’m not seeing… anyone,” he confirmed, watching John intently, but his face remained smooth and expressionless. It was infuriating, and fascinating, but he didn’t want to ask anything else in case he’d entirely imagined the hidden layer in the conversation they’d just had, because even if it was real he wasn’t sure what it meant.
“Sherlock,” John breathed in amazement, his eyes lighting up with a smile so real it almost hurt him to look at it. No one smiled at him like that anymore. He’d forgotten what it felt like. But the smile vanished just as quickly, replaced by a deep sorrow. “Your parents…”
“Yes, sir,” John answered, unable to hold back a tiny sigh of his own. “I’m meant to ask for a set of tents.”
“I was with Sherlock,” John explained as he followed Lestrade around the corner of the forge. “It’s a long story. Basically an experiment that didn’t work out.”
The thought remained with him as he finished furnishing the tents by unrolling the sleeping mats inside. His father hadn’t moved, but John figured he would turn around eventually and notice the shelter behind him. At least he hoped. Pretending he wasn’t caving in to his fears of interacting with his father, he slipped away into the night, taking the long route to Martha’s by trekking through the scrubby, shadowy hillside. Let Mycroft discover his empty tent; he didn’t care. He could always say he went back to Martha’s for a change of clothes. He knew he’d have to return to clear away the rubble from the collapsed house in the morning and begin work on a new one, but for now, he would wait for Sherlock to return, however long that took.
“So, where were you going?” John asked, breaking the oddly tense silence between them.
“Do I have any say in this? At all?”
Sherlock was still stunned and speechless. He couldn’t understand why he was suddenly unable to function, or why he couldn’t stop staring at John, who looked strikingly solid and real in the daylight.
“Right, for you and your father. I’ve got ‘em just around here. Where were you during the battle? You haven’t got a scratch on you.”
“The way you walked when I first saw you yesterday. You clearly favored one leg, but you seemed to forget about it the moment you were distracted, so it’s at least partially a trick of your mind.”
“Yes, but that would be boring,” Sherlock said with a you-know-me-better-than-that sigh. “Besides, no one’s ever asked. Now. I think we’re just in time to attend the celebration if you’re in the mood for a little fun.”
“I thought I might… do a little stargazing,” he improvised, not even trying to sound serious, wanting to see if John would figure it out on his own. He had mentioned to him earlier that he needed supplies for the net. But would John figure out that harassing Philip had been a part of his strategy for stealing the key to get into the forge? Sherlock was an excellent pickpocket, but John was surprisingly observant and always seemed to pay close attention to Sherlock’s actions; it helped that he hadn’t been drunk like the rest of the island. Still, it was possible that he hadn’t noticed.
They suddenly seemed to remember the soup at the same time, and both peered down at it; it was simmering happily, and hadn’t burned on the bottom as John feared, but he commenced stirring it again anyway. The intensity of the moment between them had passed.
“Want some company?”
“Right. And I suppose you think you’re the one who should go after the dragon,” John sighed. “I know, I know, I can’t stop you, you’ve proved that enough times already. But… look, your knife is broken. I think the dragon stepped on it.” He reached into the sand and picked up a few pieces of shattered blade. “Can’t have been much good in the first place if it broke so easily. Here, take mine,” he offered. “I won’t need it for this.”
. Home. He remembered his seven-year-old self watching the docks of Berk recede into the blue ocean haze, pretending he could see his parents waving a fond and tearful goodbye, until his sister Harry had dragged him away, her gray eyes fierce and resolved. “Don’t think about them,” she’d told him firmly. “You’ve got me looking after you now.” And John had believed her. Now he was returning to Berk alone. He didn’t know how he would face his parents. Would they come down to the docks this time, eyes eagerly scanning the crew for a glimpse of their children? Would they have tried to imagine how nine years of seafaring had changed Harry’s young, soft face into the hard visage of a warrior? And what would they expect of him? He could hardly remember his old self, the child John who snuck into the forest to practice swordfighting with the trees, who built a fortress in a hollow redwood and filled it with acorns and blackberries, who climbed onto the roof of the dragon training arena to watch the older children practicing fighting techniques; the John who had a best friend…
“I worry about him. Constantly.”
, which was a relief. He scanned the square until he spotted Captain Lestrade attempting to reassure his wife, who seemed alternately terrified and furious; this was probably due to the fact that it was her first encounter with dragons. John felt nothing but sympathy for her – the only difference between him and her was that she pined for the Verland Isles, while he pined for adventure – anything that would take him away from Berk. Their argument looked serious, but Mycroft had ordered him to request some tents, so he took a deep breath (nearly choking on acrid smoke from it) and approached him cautiously.
“John, you won’t believe what we found!” he whispered; he seemed to be trembling with excitement. “When I got to the cave this afternoon, Toothless was gone. I couldn’t find any signs of him on the beach. I feared at first he might have somehow broken through the falls and flown away, but I knew that was impossible, so I went back into the cave, and I realized one of the walls had caved in, and behind it was another cave. So I made a torch and I followed it deep under the island, and suddenly it opened up into this huge space! All this time we’ve been living on top of a hollow mountain, and we had no idea!” His eyes were shining, reflecting the glowing coals of the dying campfire nearby. “It was filled with the most incredible things - moss growing like blankets over the stones, toadstools growing sideways up the walls and some of them were even glowing, and there was a stream running over pebbles on the floor… There were even blind white fish in the water. Toothless was dashing all over the place, I could tell he loved having so much space to stretch his legs and wings. He even glided a little, but he couldn’t gain any height without his tail. Oh, John, I wish you could see it. You’d love it there.”
that, anyway? He wondered. Why did he have to run off like that, alone? They’d been getting on so well. For the whole morning he’d been entirely distracted from the grief and rage that burned low inside him, thanks to his friend’s diverting tales and scheming. But now he felt more alone than ever, and he was in no mood to deal with other people.
“I don’t want to leave,” he finally managed to choke out, and Sherlock held him tighter. “I just got you back, and now I have to leave all over again, and I… I don’t know how… Sherlock, I want you to come with me.” He heard Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath and rushed on, afraid of what his reaction might be. “I know it’s impossible, I know you have to stay with Toothless, and Mycroft would never let you leave anyway. But even before I found out about this tournament, I was going, I was going to ask you, I wanted…” he trailed off, feeling suddenly terrified. He hadn’t planned to say any of that, and a dozen what-ifs crowded into his mind, each worse than the other but all ending with Sherlock walking coldly away.
“In exchange for what?”
“… didn’t mean for this to happen… could’ve trusted me… the stove, the stove, left it on again, I’m sorry, I’m sorry… don’t understand why you weren’t there… I tried to get you out, get you out… come back, I didn’t mean any of it…”
“Who’s that?” a voice rasped from the shadows. A broken voice, terrifying in its familiarity. It was impossible. The mildew choked his throat and burned his eyes as he swallowed back bile.
“I missed you so much,” John said so softly that Sherlock thought he must have imagined it. “I probably would have stayed in Crescent Bay with Harry if it wasn’t for you, you know. But I was always wondering what trouble you’d be getting into without me.”
“Well, I dunno, I honestly can’t imagine you with a girlfriend, so I don’t know what you’d do, if you’d tell me or not.” John suddenly looked mortified, as though he realized what he said might be taken the wrong way, but Sherlock quickly rescued him.
“Just – hold on for one moment. Would I be going alone?”
“What are you going to tell your father?” Sherlock finally asked, and John could tell from the softness in his voice that he didn’t feel any of the fear or hatred he’d encountered on the Mainland, just understanding and sympathy. John blew out his breath, both relieved that his friend had calmly accepted his story and distressed that he didn’t have an answer to his question.
“Yeah. We’re done.” But somehow, John found his glare wasn’t genuine. When he looked at Mycroft now, he seemed to see right through his icy, stoic mask to the sad, tired, worried man behind it, a young leader bearing more weight than any one human deserved. His ax looked heavier in his hands now, more like a cane to lean on than a weapon to brandish self-importantly. He turned to leave without a word, and John could see him building up his invisible armor, straightening his shoulders once more and voiding his face of emotion. “Mycroft, wait.” His friend’s brother turned, a flicker of something chasing across his eyes. “I’m sorry about your parents.” Mycroft considered him for a moment, then nodded, his expression betraying nothing.
John wasn’t looking at the contraption anymore. Instead he was watching Sherlock, who was gesturing animatedly at the different mechanisms as he spoke; his eyes were shining, his face open with excitement, his hands moving and his feet dancing from side to side as he addressed the machine from different angles. His enthusiasm was contagious.
Normally, John wouldn’t have minded the job; he liked working with his hands and creating useful things. But he couldn’t forget who he was building the new house for, and he also couldn’t forget that if he weren’t obligated to build the house in the first place, he would be spending his remaining days on Berk with Sherlock, and presumably the night fury. While he was interested in seeing the fabled creature, his thoughts were always preoccupied with Sherlock; the dragon was only an afterthought. They only saw each other at night, when the rest of the village slept, and they rarely talked for long, since John was always exhausted from his work. And so his anger simmered all day as he worked - anger at Mycroft, anger at his father, anger at gods he didn’t particularly believe in, anger at whatever struck his fancy - making the hours drag like a heavy ship tugged over sand.
They probably would have gone on examining one another until dawn if the herd of startled deer hadn’t come dashing onto the beach. Having grown accustomed to nothing but the sound of waves crashing on the shore, the racket of the heavy hooved animals thrashing through the undergrowth sent a jolt of shock through his system, causing him to leap to his feet. Evidently the dragon was just as startled, for it spun on its heels and dashed away towards the falls. The deer wheeled about in the sand, confused and terrified at having inadvertently stumbled upon a dragon on the beach; barely paying any heed to Sherlock, who was now running past them in pursuit of the night fury, they ran alongside him for a moment before dashing back into the woods and disappearing into the murky shadows. The falls were just around the bend, he was almost there –
“Yes?”
“On the contrary, we have that entire half of the island to ourselves,” Sherlock told him with a mischievous grin. “There’ve been plenty enough fires since then, and a few helpful rumors spread around by myself. Works like a charm.”
“What do you mean, what?” Sherlock snapped back, though he kept his voice low too, just in case any villagers had wandered nearby.
John might as well have been invisible. He stood still on the docks, watching the reunions unfold around him, tearful laughter and joyous shouts and broken sobs, arms reaching and bodies colliding and hands grasping and lips meeting. Angelo, a gruff old man who looked just the same as seven years ago but white instead of gray, who lived in a tiny hut on the edge of the village, lifted the granddaughter he’d never met, never dreamed might one day exist, into the air, swinging her around in wonderment. A mother embraced her two daughters, who had grown from young apprentices into trained warriors in their time away; a boy barely older than John stared at his brother, who had grown a full beard and found a wife in the time they’d been apart. The moments flitted around him tantalizingly, but it quickly became clear that he wouldn’t find who he was looking for here. He shouldered his pack, which contained his few belongings: a journal with a makeshift seagull feather quill and a bottle of black ink, a colored sketch of Harry and Clara from a street artist in Crescent Bay, a gold-laced compass embedded with peridot that he’d won in an archery tournament on the Mainland, a velvet bag of various coins he’d scrounged off the streets over the years as souvenirs, a sturdy steel knife in a carved wooden sheath, and his spare set of clothes and boots. He’d only kept the compass because he thought his father might want to trade it; after so long away, he’d felt obliged to bring something home, something that might make up for their failure to find the dragonslayer. Sighing, he began moving forward, one foot in front of the other, cutting through the crowd; no one seemed to see him as he passed, heading up the switchback wooden walkway, feeling like a foreigner on the island where he had been born.
John woke with a start. He was drenched in cold sweat and his heart was pounding as though he were in the midst of battle. He had an uncomfortable sense that he’d been crying out in his sleep – his mouth hung open; his tongue was dry, his lips were chapped, and his throat was sore. Slipping out of his hammock, he stepped over to the water pitcher, reassured by the gentle swaying of the floor beneath his feet. Through the porthole he saw the sea stretching calm and black underneath a brilliantly deep indigo sky, each star a miniscule diamond glittering down at him meditatively. He drank and drank, trying to wash away the memory of his nightmare, trying to flush away the memory of the real battle.
John pressed his thumbs to his temples and sighed wearily, climbing back into his hammock with a resigned yawn. Leaving Berk, he had felt so excited about adventure, so anxious about leaving his parents; now he almost dreaded returning. Almost. He held on to one hope, the hope that there was at least one person who cared enough about him, one person who would be standing there, waiting to see his face. Someone who he’d missed fiercely without the added weight of guilt and anger that he felt when he thought about his parents. Someone who just might have missed him back. The ship swayed his hammock gently, and he finally drifted back to sleep, slipping into uneasy dreams about dragons and burning ships.
“Let’s go,” John responded, quickly grabbing his shoulderbag and taking off down the mountain path at full speed, Sherlock close on his heels. They could come back for the dragon-catcher later. All of his excitement was dissolving into panic and terror. He hadn’t meant to
The Scauldron was looming over the night fury now, whose struggles were becoming weaker as the waves battered it again and again. The great sea dragon seemed to have no interest in the tiny humans nearby, not when such rare prey was wrapped up before it. That worked to his advantage. He tuned out John’s desperate protests and stopped, waist deep in the push and pull of the waves, waiting for the right moment…
John. What an extraordinary human.
“Hello John,” he greeted him airily, as though he had not just gracelessly tumbled down a cliff and considered throwing dirt in his face. A flood of memories threatened to come crashing down on him – how John was the only boy on the island who would smile at him, laugh when he told him how he’d deduced the darkest and dirtiest secrets of all of the villagers, follow him when he went on his dangerous adventures, help him when he undertook his bizarre experiments. John was the only one who’d ever listened, the only friend he’d ever had. Suddenly he was standing on the docks again, looking past his parents, watching John, and he thought he had erased the memory permanently along with all of the others but it was as though a hidden door had been unlocked and everything was rushing into his mind all at once, and some part of him came to life when he realized that he had a best friend, a best friend who was alive after nine years –
The Scauldron lunged for the night fury, and Sherlock threw the stinkbomb with perfect aim straight into its gaping mouth. The second its jaws touched the electrified skin of the black dragon, the bomb exploded in its mouth. Sherlock had a split second to relish his triumph before the Scauldron crashed into the sea, screaming hoarsely in fury, sending a ten foot wave in all directions that knocked him underwater and dragged him chaotically along the sand, disorienting him so much that he didn’t know which way to strike for air. But then strong arms wrapped around his waist and tugged him gently to the surface, and he gratefully sucked in huge gulps of air as John lifted him over his shoulder and carried him to the shore, cursing him in a string of creative language that he had undoubtedly learned from his fellow sailors. Sherlock found himself strangely touched by John’s anger.
“Thank you,” he said softly, unable to look him in the eye. “I
“You talked in your sleep. Who were you protecting on the ship when the pirates attacked?” Oh. He’d talked rather a lot, then. He sighed, realizing that it would do no good to put off the story.
The cold water numbed his body, completing his lack of sensation both physical and emotional. He was empty, a void; he was nothing, he was unattached, he would not feel pain or sorrow or loss because such things were sentiment, weakness. He swam without registering the ache in his body, without noticing the sounds of the villagers and voyagers fading away behind him. Before long he washed up on the east beach, a calm, quiet stretch of gray pebbles and coarse sand edged by steep tumbling boulders and scraggly weeds. He dragged himself out of the waves and ran through the wet sand, letting the ebb and flow erase his footprints behind him as he followed the curve of the island, his chest burning and his eyes stinging with salt (just seawater, he told himself blankly). Soon the beach widened and the pebbly shore gave way to softer white sand; to his left the steep hill gave way to a gentle slope blanketed with redwoods. As he neared the northern tip of the island the hill steepened, and scraps of weathered gray bedrock showed through the carpet of red needles. He could hear a new sound above the endless drone of the waves crashing on the sand – a steadier roar, the roar of water cascading down across moss-covered boulders into a sandy pool on the beach. Without knowing why, he broke out of the foamy waves and stepped into the cool intrusion of freshwater, following it to the source and wading into the pool until he was covered up to his waist, and he went still further, until the fury of the falling water was pounding on his head and shoulders, and only then, protected by the deafening din of the waterfall, did the tears flow freely and the screams rip from his throat, unheard even to his own ears.
“But how did you know I wanted to trade the compass?” John interjected, quite in awe.
The smell of smoke brought him out of his reflections; the air was thick with it, green-gray clouds of billowing ash that choked the pathways and made the torchlight dim and weary. The villagers had gathered in the square, where they were taking turns cleaning and binding each other’s wounds. It didn’t look half as bad as after a pirate attack aboard
“Sherlock! Sherlock, are you alright?” John was kneeling over him, grasping his shoulders, his face, scanning his body for any signs of injury.
“What?”
“He wanted to try to get the net back. Saw it fall near the shore. I had to drag him out of the waves; it wasn’t safe.”
He reached out and took the ladle from Sherlock’s trembling hand; the way his fingertips slid slowly, lingeringly over his palm in the process felt somehow deliberate.
“John, the stink bombs!” he yelled, grabbing his shoulderbag and working it off of his arm, rummaging through it frantically.
way so that if it continued along the beach he could have confronted it before it reached the docks. But it was too late for that now. The stars spun slowly across the sky; the waves crept closer as the tide came in, covering most of the evidence, which allowed Sherlock to travel faster, though he grew concerned that he might have lost important information to the waves.
“Um,” Sherlock finally managed, feeling slightly triumphant that he had managed to produce any sound at all. John was smiling at him, but there was a shadow of sadness and worry in his stormy blue eyes that reminded Sherlock that today was the last day before John left. “Hi,” he offered tentatively, not knowing what else to say.
“No, I understand why you had to go. But I never understood why I couldn’t go with you.” Now it was his turn to stare out across the ocean, avoiding his friend’s gaze. It came as a complete shock to him when John shifted next to him and placed his hand on his knee, giving him a comforting squeeze. He was even more surprised when John didn’t immediately remove his arm from where it leaned against his. Feeling oddly hyperaware of the exact spot where each of John’s fingers touched the sleeve of his shirt, he forced himself to breathe evenly, and slowly managed to relax, part of him trying not to think about how nice it was because he knew it was unlikely to happen again, while the rest of him savored the experience of being comforted and marveled at the way he seemed to fit against John’s side so perfectly.
He remembered the day the expedition had left as clearly as if it were yesterday, because that was the day his parents left. He’d filed away the memory and only revisited it in the depths of the darkest nights, but now it came surging forward: his mother and father clad in their finest warrior gear, standing tall and steady at the helm, chieftess and chief, side by side, saluting the remaining villagers as the three ships left the docks; tears streaming silently down his face as he felt Mycroft’s hand settle gently on his shoulder; the both of them pretending nothing was different, nothing would change, nothing could happen to prevent their parents from returning one day. In spite of his parents’ promises, there had been no letters. Mycroft penned letter after letter to send to the major Mainland ports, hoping that one would reach their fleet, but they never received a response. Though no one spoke of it, a darkness seemed to settle over the island when the realization sank in that the ships would, in all likelihood, never return.
catch him he’d be too dangerous to get close to, you can’t possibly even be considering—”
It was clear that the night fury was not going to try to exit the cave any time soon; the pain of passing through the water had been too intense. After the shock wore off, Sherlock realized that in some ways, this situation was perfect – the dragon was safely hidden on the side of the island that the rest of the villagers feared to approach, and Sherlock would be able to care for it by tossing food through the water with minimal fear of being attacked. He might even get a chance to observe the tail wound to see if the damage could be fixed; he needed to know if the dragon would be able to fly again before he found a way to coax him back through the falls. Realizing that there was nothing more he could do at the moment, he decided to head back to Martha’s; he had so much to tell John, and the excitement of the night had worn him out – for once he was ready to collapse into a soft bed. But come morning, he’d be back to planning ways to steal fish from the fishing boats to feed the night fury, who was probably just as drained and exhausted as he was. Before he left the falls, he climbed over some rocks at the edge of the water and got as close as he could without touching it, just in case the dragon’s body touched the water and sent a surge of electricity at him.
With that he turned and made his way into the forest, jogging swiftly along the fastest route to the village, a new purpose burning in his veins and lending him a new energy.
“John,” he whispered roughly, “wake up.” John seemed to recognize his voice; he murmured something unintelligible but didn’t open his eyes. “John,” Sherlock whispered a bit more loudly, and put his hand on his arm. John rolled towards him and opened his eyes, and Sherlock was startled at how close their faces were; he hadn’t realized how much he’d been leaning forward.
“I’m sorry, I…” he started to say, feeling like something inside him was cracking dangerously and was perhaps about to shatter, but Sherlock interrupted him.
“Yeah, it’s me,” John replied, faking cheeriness, though he couldn’t help keeping his voice low; he felt irrationally worried that speaking in normal tones might cause the ceiling to come crashing down. “Not dead after all. In case you were wondering.”
dangerous.
the dragon. He’d wanted him alive to study, but it wasn’t the failure of his experiment that he cared about now, it was the thought of the fierce animal tied and trapped under the waves, struggling to escape, to breathe, to live.
“I’m almost finished with the net. Do you want to help me load it in? We’ve got to test it somehow before we try to use it. I’m hoping it will be ready by tonight. The dragons are bound to be back soon; they rarely wait this long between raids.” John felt his anger trickle away, replaced by a wave of some unidentifiable emotion that left his stomach twisted in knots and his chest hurting. He didn’t want to leave Sherlock for a whole season; he didn’t want to miss the moment when his friend caught a dragon, and he didn’t want to miss whatever brilliant, dangerous thing he did next. He took a deep breath, pushing away all of the unspoken thoughts that crowded his mind. He still had a month to figure something out, after all.
“You don’t know what to do with yourself now that you’re here; you won’t stay with your father, and your sister’s out of the picture because she stayed behind in Crescent Bay, possibly because of a romantic attachment or maybe because she found friendship and acceptance there that she’d never have here in Berk. You’re thinking about trading a valuable object for enough money to leave Berk and journey somewhere else, but you feel guilty about not using the money to help your father and you still haven’t decided what to do. You’ve become excellent at archery, knife-fighting, and handling a gun, the latter being your weapon of choice. You visited every city and country along the Mainland except for the Night City, and you’re currently feeling anxiety over the idea of being put back in dragon training with children who are years younger than you, because in spite of all of your experience in battle, you’re not prepared for fighting dragons.”
“Good. Um. Thank you.”
“Hello, John,” he greeted him with a superficial smile. “How nice to see you assisting with the training. Do you find it satisfying?”
“Where are you going?”
In a way he liked spending time with the children, because they were easy to talk to. It was harder with people like Lestrade and Angelo. Angelo, for all that he was a big, gruff, battle-seasoned warrior, seemed at a loss when it came to talking to John; in fact, the whole village went out of their way to avoid him. He suspected they didn’t know what to say to him about his parents. Lestrade had been awfully quiet since they’d made landfall; he thought this had to do more with his personal problems than anything to do with John – apparently his wife from the Verland Isles was miserable on Berk. His heart went out to Molly, who was undoubtedly caught in the crossfire between them – an experience he understood all too well.
, he thought numbly as they careened down the hillside, skirting the village and heading for the sandy cliffs that led to the beach.
“Mmm.”
Thank the gods it was over now. Captain Lestrade had held the crew together and managed to fend off the first, second, and third waves of pirates that surged onto their ship; by then the pirate ship, Scarlet Kiss, was fleeing over the waves. Five crew members were lost; at least twice that number of pirates had perished.
Soon they were close enough to see that the dragon was still breathing, much to Sherlock’s relief, though its eyes were closed and its body limp. It was still tangled in the netting, and there was something dark on the sand near its tail –
And then it clicked.
Wait, was John
“Yeah, I was,” John admitted; there was no point in lying. “He’s fine, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
“Almost there,” Sherlock panted as they dragged the dragon-catcher up the steep side of the rocky outcrop. The stars shone brilliantly above in the clear indigo sky, thriving off of the lack of competing light since it was a new moon. The conditions were perfect for spotting dragons, but less than ideal for carrying a heavy piece of equipment (even one with cleverly fashioned wheels) up the side of a mountain in near complete darkness. Both of them had sore arms and stubbed toes, but Sherlock couldn’t stop the anticipation from bubbling up in him as he imagined how it would feel, bringing a dragon to the ground.
He turned around to see Mycroft standing calmly behind him, his eyes unreadable, his brow furrowed and his mouth set in its characteristic small frown. It seemed as if he had been standing there, perfectly straight and still, for eternity, but Sherlock hadn’t noticed him as he ran past.
“You are a complete and utter dickhead,” John concluded furiously as he carefully set his friend on his feet. “Gods, Sherlock. Don’t ever scare me like that again, you hear?” And for a moment Sherlock forgot everything – forgot the reason they were there, forgot that he was drenched with seawater and probably draped with seaweed and caked with wet sand, forgot that somewhere above the cliffs a battle raged. Maybe the lack of air was making him feel so dizzy, maybe the adrenaline high was the only reason his heart was beating so fast – but nonetheless, as he stared down at John’s night-dark face, he could only deduce that being rescued by John was quite an enjoyable experience and was perhaps something that should be repeated in the future. Probably multiple times.
“Why were you watching me?” Oh. Damn. How could he answer that?
“Yes, I suppose that’s true,” John conceded with a small laugh. “Although the last secret between us that I properly remember was the one about you setting fire to the north shore so that everyone would think the dragons lived there and avoid the place, and I doubt that lasted long after I left.”
“I dunno,” John said, and he wasn’t even lying; the dragon could have gone anywhere. “He ran off, you know how he is. He wanted to be alone.”
“The girl in the drawing with Harry is Clara,” John said finally, looking away as Sherlock turned back to him. A strange anxiety fluttered in his chest like a trapped bird. He wanted to tell him so much, needed him to know, needed him to accept it, couldn’t hide it. “Clara was her lover. Crescent Bay is… nothing like Berk. Or anywhere else, for that matter. They don’t have any of the traditions we have here. There’s a beautiful kind of freedom in it. They celebrate everyone, all of the humans and all of the gods. I saw women with women and men with men, and people who weren’t men or women at all, just people; and they loved so freely. It was liberating for Harry. She felt at home there. I would love to go back, someday. To visit her. But… the rest of the crew was very uncomfortable there. We had to stay for three months because our ships had been damaged in a storm, and Crescent Bay is very isolated, and being so far south they didn’t have all of the materials we needed to fix our northmade Viking ships. So we had to wait until traders came down from the north. We all did our best to find odd jobs around town to keep ourselves fed, though we were able to live aboard
One morning, more than a fortnight after
“Excellent.” John blinked, confused by his chief’s response. “Because I have a job for you,” Mycroft continued, smiling in a way that suggested he already knew John’s answer would be.
CW: implied parent death
“Can you explain the meaning of this?” Mycroft thrust his torch dangerously close to the wooden contraption, and John winced; he doubted Sherlock would want to use it again, but he hated the thought of it going up in flames after all of their hard work building it.
His memories felt more like a dream than any reality he’d ever been a part of. The salty tang of the ocean spray, the cry of gulls, the swaying of the wooden deck beneath his feet, the feel of rope under his calloused fingers were much more real, and more familiar; and yet
“Good night, John,” Sherlock murmured, listening to the shuffling sound of John shifting down into the moss and stretching out on his side to sleep.
“He’s leaving in seven days,” Sherlock would say hollowly, and Toothless would nudge him gently from behind, warming him with hot air snuffed out of his nostrils.
“Well, what do you think?” Sherlock asked, fixing his brilliant stormy gray eyes on John for the first time in hours, impatiently waiting for his opinion.
“Don’t you think I would have told you by now?” That wasn’t what he meant to say; why did he have to keep answering John with more questions? He made a mental note to work on that in the future.
“Hello, Sherlock,” he mumbled shakily as reality flooded his senses.
Sherlock had been working nearly as hard on his gift as he had been working on a new tail for Toothless. While the tail was crucial to his escape plan, it could wait long enough for him to finish the gift before John’s departure. It had required striking up a deal with Philip - something he was loathe to do - so that he had access to the forge, and Philip’s supplies and expertise. He’d had to agree never to torment Philip again and to return all the tools he’d stolen in the past (as well as make a few new ones), and to clean up around the shop for an hour or so every day. In exchange, Philip taught Sherlock how to craft a knife of the finest steel, with a glossy black dragon scale embedded in the hilt. If Philip noticed anything uncommon about the scale, he didn’t mention it, and Sherlock certainly wasn’t going to tell him it had belonged to a night fury; but he was certain John would recognize it instantly. It was one of the scales he’d collected that first night, when he was hiding evidence that the dragon had traveled along the beach.
He hadn’t gone far before he heard the sound of footsteps behind him. Even though he knew, logically, that it must be John, he still felt a rush of surprise when he turned around and saw his friend rounding the corner and scrambling after him; he’d had to go back down the stairs to grab his own boots, and now he was struggling along, hopping on one foot and then the other, trying to keep up while tying his laces all at once. Even after all of the time they’d spent together that evening, it seemed impossible that John wanted to spend
“Well?”
“By all means,” Sherlock replied, exhilaration flooding through him, and they set off into the night side by side.
“She died four years ago. Always staring off over the cliffs, waiting for you to come back. Never the same after that. Thought she would topple right over. Got weaker and weaker until there was nothing left. Left me the day you disappeared over that horizon, went to stay with Heather. She’s dead too. Everyone’s dead. I’m nearly dead,” he added with a listless chuckle. “And you. You’re supposed to be dead. Never dreamed you’d come back alive.”
“Incredible. Absolutely incredible,” John told him as he examined it from all angles. “You know, you’d be the hero of Berk if you put your talent towards making things that other people actually wanted instead of things that cause trouble.” He said it teasingly, but it was true; it amazed him that no one else had noticed Sherlock’s creative potential as an inventor.
“Why?” John interjected, still suspicious.
Mostly, John just listened when they met, and sometimes asked questions, because Sherlock was always bursting with things to tell him about the dragon (who he’d inexplicably named Toothless), and John didn’t think Sherlock would be much interested in hearing about how many blocks of stone he’d carted up the hill that afternoon, or how his father had thrown his bowl of soup at him in an unexpected fit of rage. He didn’t mind being the listener because he’d missed the sound of Sherlock’s voice so much, and his stories gave him plenty to think about while he worked the next day. He also liked watching Sherlock’s hands moving animatedly as he described how Toothless had finally taken a (non-threatening) step towards him one day, or leapt across the cave to catch a fish that Sherlock threw to him.
“Dragoncatcher,” Sherlock supplied helpfully, feeling rather intrigued by John’s lack of eloquence.
“Three days,” Sherlock almost whispered, fighting back a wave of nausea and a strange prickling in his eyes. Toothless head-butted him so hard he toppled backwards into the icy cold underground stream, causing him to laugh and splutter in spite of himself.
at someone before, that this was the first time he’d voluntarily shut down his deductions and seen without observing. And it was fascinating.
“Yeah. I got shot.”
“Information. Nothing… indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.”
Sherlock scrambled to his feet and squinted out towards the southwestern horizon, the direction the dragons always came from. At first he saw nothing, but then a star winked out for half a second – had a dragon flown in front of it? And all at once he saw them, barely a shade darker than the sky behind them, gliding in towards the village, speeding closer every second. The watchtower horns blew; one of the watchmen had spotted them. Fires flickered to life in the village as torches were lit and fire arrows readied. From the high outcrop, the battle cries of the villagers who spilled out of their houses brandishing weapons sounded distant and almost surreal. The first shriek of a dragon cut the stillness of the night like a blade.
“Well?” Sherlock watched him out of the corner of his sharp gray-blue eyes. “Did I get everything right?”
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said airily; John could tell his emotions were fighting between anxiety and pride, though all the while he tried to maintain a dignified air. The effect was dampened by the leaves stuck in his hair; John made a mental note to tell him to remove them later, but at the moment he was too caught up in the beauty of the machine in front of him. It was constructed of finely honed, smoothly sanded redwood beams carved and fitted like a giant crossbow, but rather than releasing a single bolt, it was designed to catapult twelve weights, which would be tied at the edges of the net. Examining it closely, John could see that it would spin the net when it released, which would effectively spread it out to its full width, making it more likely to capture its target.
“He can’t do that,” Sherlock protested in horror. “You can’t go. Do you want to go?”
. The horror had never felt real until he watched a man shot dead in the chest and heard his daughter scream. The fear had never felt real until the pirate had trained his dead, evil eyes on his own. And the pain had been unbearable, unimaginable.
Martha, however, would have none of it.
“Sorry?” John wasn’t sure what Mycroft was getting at, but he felt instantly suspicious.
“Of course.”
– he wanted to climb out the window and run just for the sake of it, the thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through his veins – no, he wanted to jump out of the window and
“Oh no,” Sherlock whispered, gripped with a cold horror. “John, look at its tail.”
Of all the things John had feared, his mother dying hadn’t been one of them. She’d seemed fragile, subdued by the drunken rages of his father, yes; but there’d been a determined fire in her eyes all the same, a fire that reminded him of eternity, a fire that protected him when she whispered how much she loved him through the closet door when he hid for hours after the screaming matches had subsided. Dead. Impossible. And yet. He should be grieving. He should be overcome. Instead he feels sick with disgust and brimming with anger. What did he do to deserve this?
, he felt so light, impossibly light… He
“Probably!”
Except things had already changed – there was a dragon involved now, and he only had a month until he was sailing to the Verland Isles; Mycroft seemed determined to meddle with his life. A chill swept across him as he wondered if it was more than that – what if he was trying to keep John away from Sherlock? And if that were true, why? He tried to shake it off as a coincidence, but the uneasiness lingered as he slowly made his way towards the firelight of the village.
“Right,” said John, his voice strangely hoarse, “I’ll see you tonight.”
Instead of answering, Sherlock pulled the key to the forge out of his pocket and tossed it to John.
The sunlight streaming through the entrance to the tree threw warm golden light across Sherlock’s face, dancing across his sparkling eyes as he spoke; his elegant hands moved constantly, holding the objects he described with such delicate care and concentration. Now he was silent, watching John out of the corner of his eyes as though anticipating an unwelcome reaction.
Luckily, Lestrade’s wife was already storming away by the time he reached him. Hanging back for a moment while the captain ran his hand through his silver hair and let out a ragged sigh, he stole another glance around the square looking for his father. There was no sign of him.
You could never catch a night fury, you’ve only got one net, even if you
Suddenly a shape emerged from the redwood tree, and several things happened in rapid succession. Sherlock froze and flung himself to the side to conceal himself behind a bed of luscious ferns, but the earth beneath him crumbled and he crashed to the ground in a heap with a muffled yell. The shape – a human figure – leapt towards him, and he saw the pale glint of a blade in the dusky light, unmistakable even with the gritty soil falling in his eyes. Swiftly leaping to his feet, Sherlock desperately searched for anything that might serve as a weapon, a shield, or an escape, and was about to reach for a handful of sand to toss in his attacker’s eyes when he realized he wasn’t actually being attacked.
He’d only looked away for a moment, but that was all it took. The cry of the rare lightning kite had drawn his eye high above the redwoods to track the sleek white bird as she sliced across the sharp blue late summer sky, in pursuit of prey or perhaps merely enjoying the last days of warmth before autumn. A fierce stab of longing lanced through him as he imagined what it would be like to fly, to soar above it all, to leave the earth and its slow, bickering creatures behind. It was in that moment that the softest breeze snuffed out the last breath of his dragonfire. The enigmatic white-gold flames vanished, leaving a pile of charred twigs and a trail of silver smoke in their wake. Groaning in frustration, Sherlock rose from where he’d been kneeling all morning and kicked sodden mud over the dead fire, wincing as his stiff legs protested at the sudden movement. He’d learned nothing from his new experiment, though he was still certain that dragonfire had different properties from normal fire. If only he could keep it alive long enough to test more materials! He’d burned different herbs, different barks, different kinds of dust and even stones, but so far normal fire had yielded the same results. It didn’t make any sense; dragons were living creatures just like humans and other animals – so how could their insides handle the fire they breathed? Did they have some kind of armor in their chest? Where was the fire generated, in the throat or belly? There were so many questions he had yet to answer.
John’s voice startled him out of his reverie. “You didn’t even take your shoes off.” He was standing in the doorway, a broom and dustbin in one hand while the other ran through his hair in frustration. “You left a trail of soot all the way up the stairs and into the room, and you’re going to get it on the quilt if you’re not careful…” Sherlock swung his feet down to the floor, but after that he stopped listening to the admonishment and just stared at John, his heart crashing around in his chest like a fish caught in a net. Why was he feeling like this? He found himself looking at his friend’s face in an entirely new way; John’s story fell away and instead he saw only the colors and planes and angles, the unique blue of his eyes, the way he held his shoulders. Sherlock had the strangest feeling that he’d never really
“No.”
“Who were you protecting?” Sherlock’s icy gray-blue eyes watched his with a keen expression.
why you weren’t there when the ship docked,” John said, shaking his head with a small smile of dawning understanding in his voice, but it died quickly, fading into a quiet sadness. “Sherlock. I’m… so sorry. That I left. I didn’t know it would be so hard for you.”
“You’ve got to get some rest,” Sherlock murmured as he wrapped his cloak more tightly around himself. John wondered if he, too, was feeling the cold more sharply now that they were no longer touching. “I’m sorry I kept you waiting for so long tonight.”
“Okay. Well. Good luck, then.”
“Yes.”
The Night Fury
arrival, John was teaching the three children how to use a crossbow when he sensed a darkly familiar presence behind him. Instructing the children to practice swordfighting with their wooden blades (he figured it couldn’t hurt for them to have experience with human-to-human combat as well), he turned to meet Mycroft, who was leaning on his ridiculous ax again.
John never made it to the dragoncatcher. Instead he ran straight into Mycroft as he skirted the village, where the sounds of battle had died away; the dragons were gone. Mycroft was in full battle gear, ax in one hand and torch in the other, and thick blood was smeared across his shoulder – dragon or human, it was impossible to say in the dim light. Philip stood behind him, arms crossed and brow furrowed, his elbow leaning against the dragoncatcher, which they had evidently discovered and trundled down the mountain.
He stared out of the porthole without really seeing, licking his cracked lips and wishing he hadn’t used up his supply of the soothing beeswax balm of the Verland Isles, bought on their last stop on their long journey home. Home. The word danced clumsily around his mind, knocking against other words – adventure, loyalty, companionship – that had come to hold more weight over the last nine years of sailing on
time with him. No one ever sought out his company like this. It was both alarming and flattering, and he felt oddly warm and nervous as he waited for him to catch up, trying to think of something to say. Thankfully, John spoke first and saved him the trouble.
“Yes, you mentioned that already!” His hand closed around a stinkbomb. Spinning back to the impending dragon fight, he surged into the water; he had to get as close to the Scauldron as possible for this to work.
“You don’t seem the kind to make friends easily.”
“Is this it? Your call to glory? Training the children of Berk to defend the island against the ultimate enemy? Are you prepared to settle for a life of instructing the village’s offspring to battle dragons?”
Sherlock picked the room on the left at random and swung open the door, feeling a strange jolt of surprise and affection when he saw that Martha had fixed it up in anticipation, putting new linens on the bed and leaving a few books and a vase of violets on the endtable. He flopped down on the bed and flung open the shutters, leaning out to breathe in the cool, fresh night air that was tinged with bonfire smoke. His heart was pounding, his fingers hot and tingling, he was so
“You tell me why. He’s having me shipped to the Verland Isles. He wants me to compete in a tournament. The winner marries the heir to the throne, but he doesn’t want me to win – not first place, anyway. There are other prizes. It’s probably money he wants.”
“It’s wonderful,” John breathed earnestly as he slipped it back into its sheath and fastened it reverently to his belt. “I can’t believe - I never expected - thank you, Sherlock, thank you.”
“This isn’t safe!”
“Oh. Right.” What was that
Sherlock missed John constantly, and he hadn’t even left Berk yet. Working with Toothless during the day distracted him enough that missing John was only a dull ache, but he couldn’t help thinking about how much he wished John could see everything the dragon did for himself. The day Sherlock reached up to touch Toothless’s face for the first time, his head turned and eyes closed, and felt the shy dragon’s nose finally settle against his palm, his elation was punctured by the thought that John ought to have been standing next to him with his own hand outstretched. When Toothless started looking forward to Sherlock’s visits, he wished John could hear the night fury’s friendly, welcoming rumble, like the purr of a giant cat. Sherlock had made a few large wicker balls for Toothless to play with (the dragon had quickly learned not to shoot them with his blue fire, which charred them to ash immediately). He could just imagine what it would be like to sit on his favorite cushiony, moss-covered stone and watch John throw the balls for Toothless to chase, a sheaf of parchment and a charcoal stick in his hand so that he could sketch the various movements of the dragon’s half serpentine, half feline body, and maybe John’s own figure too. Sometimes he entertained the fantasy of stealing John away in the night and hiding him in the secret cave, but he worried that Mycroft would go to any lengths to find them both if he did that, and then it wouldn’t be safe for any of them.
