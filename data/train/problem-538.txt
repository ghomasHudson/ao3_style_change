Another thought occurred to him, and he scrolled through his contacts, chose someone else. A text message or two was exchanged, and the bag of supplies was couriered over, one of the few perks of his connections with Mycroft Holmes.
The sigh Sherlock exhaled was one of long-standing tolerance. And something like disappointment. "I haven't said it lately, but even after all these years, you see but do not observe."
He feels his own pulse loud in his ears, thinking about what the day still holds, for both of them, but Sherlock especially. Breathing tube, sedation, laying flat, medications, restraints, monitoring, possibly now an additional procedure.
"I gave notice." John spoke the words out loud, calmly, matter-of-factly. He was confident. Speaking it aloud made for ripples deep inside.
"No, but now that you mention it, perhaps." A faint smile appeared and disappeared just as quickly as it had come. "If you truly don't wish to, I understand, but ..."
, a grab, an increase in steady tension, not enough to hurt but enough to be felt. To be experienced. This time, he massages as he holds and tips Sherlock's head back in his grip, bringing their heads closer together. Over the next minute he experiments - tighter, snugger, a bit sharper, massaging as he goes - and he never has to wonder even for a second if Sherlock likes it. The vocal, guttural response, the positive encouragement, the approval in the many sounds that hover quietly between them, lays it all right on the table.
The day is cool but John feels very little. He has been accompanied to the gravestone marker, he in his black jacket, she in red wool. The cold goes right into his soul as reality pierces him with even more chill, more ice, more numbness. He says a few words, thinking that just perhaps he's been clinging to the hope that this was a farce more strongly than she is clinging to his arm.
That last paragraph would understandably freak Sherlock out. I remember saying that I wasn't afraid - in the early days, before we knew. Now, I know enough to be very afraid.
And the heaviness, the unsettling feeling in the pit of his stomach, had all come back at Ella's prompting question.
"Perhaps." He waited, hoping Sherlock was still paying attention. "But how much risk are you willing to take? Most likely, just being honest, nothing would happen. Not right away anyway. You may or may not stay in rhythm and not feel too bad. But there is still risk. You've been given good medical explanations.
"I certainly don't want to draw this out unnecessarily. It may take me a few weeks to find a flat I can tolerate." From his vantage point in one of Mycroft's expensive leather chairs, Sherlock knew his words were strong and confident. He was quite cognisant of the changes within and without. Thinking quickly, clearly, and wisely. Motivated for wellness, keeping his brain away from chemicals that could possibly slow him down, and cautiously hopeful for meaning and purpose, eventually. Although it was barely noticeable, he'd put on a few pounds and felt the depth and benefit of proper nutrition. He was not foolish enough - or naive enough - to ignore his susceptibility, to know that he might always battle addition, and need to fend off the craving.
There was a bit of murmuring, and by this point, pyjamas were on and they were tucking cool feet under the duvet and the gathering toward each other, adjusting pillows and arms, a knee pressing over the other man's leg.
I have taken up residence in the first floor bedroom. Earlier today I offered to share the bed. Guilt is already so high on some days, regret I guess. Kicking somebody out of their bedroom not to mention bed isn't something I wanted to add to the list.
"While mine couldn't wait to try something, anything, to fix my disappointing behaviour." Although their banter is light-hearted, there is a degree of truth, of hurt even these years later, that John picks up on. An undercurrent of, even now, looking to be comforted and reassured.
John works his way around some monitoring equipment in the hallway and passes a wheelchair before finding bay 8. It is empty but tells quite a story anyway.
"We could do blue, I guess," Rosie conceded, knowing it was one of Sam's favourite colours. "Maybe yellow for your mama? Would that be okay, papa?" Sam's football boots and some other gear were yellow, and they all knew the reason why.
Plants need very little in life - water, sunlight, air, nutrients - to fulfill their purpose. They exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. Some bloom, flower, grow food, others provide shade, decoration, and beauty. They grow, wider or larger, they reproduce in one way or another - off-shoots, seeds, replanting, through the soil, tubers, bulbs, spores, or cones. They germinate, reach for the surface of their growing medium, unfoil in the light, spread out to maximise their leaf exposure surface area, soak up water, warmth, and light. There is also some amazing design: a light-sensitive protein, a hormone found in these plants, actually causes physical change that enables the plant to find not just light, but the
"Shut up," John murmured, but fondly. "We can't all be blessed with unlimited bladder capacity like you."
Our family has indeed done hard things, John mused in the present, watching the dog nibbling on a chew toy, watching Rosie turn up the volume on a favourite song, watching Sherlock as he poked and prodded the fire, tucking a variety of things into the base of the flames, probably running calculations of flammability or some other observation known and appreciated only by him.
Before coffee, before tea, Sherlock isn't quite completely awake yet and only shakes his head no. The nurse consults her paperwork. "I didn't see that the phlebotomist has been in yet. They'll be drawing some blood shortly." There is a snort from the patient which seems to momentarily unsettle the nurse. "I mean, it's necessary, and ..."
Rosie found her voice first. "I thought so. Why didn't you just ... say something. I thought things were different." She made something of a Sherlock face as she punctuated her words with air quotes. "Last night you said something about sleeping on the couch, and it started me thinking. Because you never do that. And you both ... dunno ... looked at each other differently."
Sherlock tipped his head back, closed his eyes. "I swear this is a bad idea." John didn't disagree, feeling again very lightly over Sherlock's feet, knowing he was frowning at the cool, tight, painful affected leg. He looked up to find Sherlock watching him, both of them serious. Sherlock finally whispered, "Go ahead."
John took a deep breath, and it caught Sherlock's attention for a brief moment, and John tried to shrug as if he hadn't been caught displaying his nervousness. Mycroft nodded, smiling somewhat mysteriously. "Trust me. Just go say hello." Sherlock made a hideously awful face at his brother, one that made John grateful the kids were otherwise not paying attention. "You will not be disappointed." Mycroft smiled wanly, a little bit of secretive Cheshire cat in the insincerity. "And Sherlock?" he waited until Sherlock turned to look at him. "You might even enjoy it."
Shortly thereafter they sat in the kitchen, somewhat nervously, watching with fascination the ultimately boring-ness of stirring honey into steaming mugs of tea.
John had given him a small, hopefully meaningful smile. "All right." His words, his eyes, shy and unable to hold still for long.
Arriving home, John was still in the routine of strip-shower-supper, and once in lounge pants or pyjamas, he would most often prefer to talk about anything but the virus, the hospital, the severity of their co-worker, or even world trends and cases. They no longer watched the news.
John could almost feel the eye-roll. "Didn't he give you some warning about family issues? Must be slipping." He tipped his head back, closed his eyes (missing John's nod of recollection), but his features were still quite awake, tense. "I'm not exactly welcome."
, the high risk-taking behaviour, the lack of personal concern, Sherlock sighed again. He knew that the last thing he needed was for his brother to find out exactly how low he was in the process of sinking.
A few seconds, lingering, waiting, then he nods again, forwards another slide, more data. Totals in their hospital. Trends of new cases, community and facility spread, he highlights quickly and tells the story without getting bogged down. He doesn't read anything on the slides verbatim, but highlights their survival rates, their extubation rates, their length of stay, and their days since the last positive coronavirus patient. They are all well aware that for healthcare all over the world, there is a
"Are they uncomfortable?" Sameer shook his head, and John just wasn't quite sure what to make of his reaction. "Do you want another colour? You like these black and white ones? Or the bright yellow?"
"No." There was a period of silence, Sameer blinking, eyes wide and body tense and quite awake. There was another huge gust of wind outside, driving sheets of rain against the side of the building and whistling around the edge of the roof before settling back to a steadier, slower rain. John took a moment, brushed a warm hand over the lad's back, a soft reminder, an assurance of safety.
John pursed his lips, knowing that living with a bloody detective like Sherlock came with this particular risk. No harm done, though, and he was still looking forward to enjoying the outing. "Don't ruin it for them."
"Hey," he says quietly. "Just some music for you to listen to." Sherlock's arms and legs are still twitching, restlessly pulling, his arms and the right leg restrained for his own safety and to minimise the risk of bleeding. His head turns side to side, as if he is trying to dislodge the breathing tube simply by the twisting motion. "You're on some medication to help you relax, in your IV. You're still in the hospital, remember?" His eyes twitch, almost a blink reflex in the works, and he is perhaps a little bit more settled, as if he might be
It takes John a bit of moving around, rearranging a few things after turning on the light, but thankfully the room is large enough to accommodate what he has in mind. He slides the recliner next to Sherlock's bed, lowers Sherlock's siderail on that side so that, with a faint adjustment to the height of Sherlock's bed, they are pretty close together. The overbed table fits nicely over the foot of Sherlock's bed, the laptop a comfortable distance from them both, and he flips the lightswitch back off. The room is more peaceful, muffled, and he settles into the recliner, ditches his shoes, and fires up the movie. From out of the bag, he pulls two beers in an insulated holders, twists off both caps.
John keeps an ear attuned to their conversation, expecting abrasiveness and immediate offensive comments, but Sherlock shakes her hand in return. "Likewise. Sherlock. Thanks for bringing her." He smirks. "And apologies for my brother. Please disregard everything he thinks he knows about me."
John sighed to himself, mostly silently, while the DI and nurse exchanged light-hearted comments about her not finishing the paperwork and Greg being unable to close the loop on the investigation. As he did so, he happened to catch a glimpse of a man wearing a non-descript, disheveled coat that was worn in many places sitting hunched into a corner of the waiting room. The man, young and with an unruly mop of dark curls peeking out from under a slouchy beanie, also happened to look up just at that moment - and quickly put his finger to his lips in a silent message and then wink at him. He was certainly close enough to have heard their conversation, and while John turned his head so he wouldn't be obviously staring, he saw the man tuck his hospital ID band up under the cuff of his sleeve.
Silently, John raised his glass as he offered up the usual words, "Another year," and they joined him, glasses clinking, taking a sip. "I still love it here. Every year, reminders that, even when it gets really bad," and his smile brightened as he glanced between them and left the sentence unfinished. Resolutely, he chose not to revisit or restate the trauma, the residual toll, the helplessness of a bad situation. Surreptitiously, Sherlock stretched out a long leg, tucking his ankle underneath John's shin. A wordless reminder,
Rosie checked a quick glance at her father, who was neither intervening nor disapproving, so she didn't back down. "You're the one who ended up in the hospital a couple months ago. So obviously, it's ..."
"I know." Their orbits gravitate closer again, until they're touching. John takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and rests his cheek against Sherlock's shoulder. Despite the fussing, the stress of the evening that has swung from totally panicked to this, to relaxed, to whole and healthy, he feels perfectly calm.
Through the window of the control room, John can see ... not much actually. A lot of paper, sterile draping, two more people - physician and technician, John figures - watching a screen, another standing by the patient. There's too much going on and too much of an obstructed view for John to see much of Sherlock at all - presuming it's him, anyway - and the large screen they are watching is angled that he cannot see any of it.
Mycroft laughed at her blunt sense of humour. "Thank you very much." Lydia wasn't sure how to handle that statement, so Mycroft continued to fill the quietness. "For your intuition and your attention to all of them."
Sherlock scoffed. "Ridiculous." John raised a displeased eyebrow, waiting patiently for Sherlock to look back up at him. "Well, it is. Mostly, for a new vaccine like this that hasn't made it through all the trials, all of this," he tapped at the Vaccine Information Sheet, "is going to be every iteration of saying we don't know, we have no idea, further testing is necessary, or no data is available."
Lydia chuckles, hands John a couple of items she has brought: a new board book with hidden flaps, and a small, collapsible cooler. "I'm going to step out, give you some space."
There was a brief moment, a few moments actually, of pleasant, languorous awakening. The sheets, sleepy warm and soft. The pillow, just in the right place, neck supported, oh so comfortable. Very dark outside, still early, the flat silent, a few stretches and John knew he'd drift off again. Heat from the mostly unclothed body next to him in the bed, the perfect distance away, close enough to feel radiant heat without being too warm. It was heavenly and sweet and relaxing ...
They exchanged names again, and Greg fired off a question, tucking the small notebook he'd been using into a pocket. "So was that you on the call from earlier? The jumper?"
Sherlock tucked both hands back into his lap, but didn't move away. And didn't speak. His expression, soft, quiet, introspective, didn't change much, except that John watched him, saw the blinking, perhaps more frequently than usual. And he heard the subtext.
"You'd best stay," she says, a little more boldly, for which John is particularly thankful. Last thing he needs is a nurse who shows any kind of chink in her armour. He is well aware that Sherlock is going to be in rare form and feisty today. "I know the doctors have worked hard to get you here, and this is what the doctor ordered."
John's eyes flick to the ventilator, checking out the machines settings. His fraction of inspired oxygen is as high as it goes - one hundred percent. He takes note of the rest of the settings with cursory interest, tidal volume, minute volume, I/E ratio, but he sees that the PEEP setting is high and that his peak inspiratory pressures are a bit elevated - consistent with his diagnosis. He cares more about the person than the machinery, and his mind doesn't seem to want to focus too long on the technology, and turns back to his flatmate.
He slid the other leg out, folding the covers carefully out of the way, and began again at Sherlock's thigh, which trembled slightly as the new, warm cloth ran over, under, around. His knee received the same attention, and the touch was sure and firm behind the joint, and then he moved down to cleanse the ankle, foot, instep, and quickly but thoroughly, toes with a stronger touch. Another few swipes over Sherlock's heel and John returned the leg to the bed, covered it again.
John was never one for making an abundance of body noises. He seldom cleared his throat, sniffled, or even chewed loudly. So when he made a few sounds in his throat, a couple of times in a row one evening while they were watching some documentary Sherlock was interested in, he glanced up apologetically to find Sherlock watching him.
"Why are you so ... resistant to doing this one thing. To following this one medical recommendation. I don't understand it." John watched Sherlock look away, his head against the pillow, his body unmoving, lost somewhere in thought. "But it's only one night, so --"
John's mind scrambles to come up with something that will work. Something that might appropriately motivate his mad flatmate.
But it is a sobering idea, that Sherlock might be coming home - to a child who might be coming down with something. He washes his own hands, holds out a handful of waterless hand sanitiser to Sherlock, and hopes that he is wrong.
"Go. It's where you need to be, I think. We're fine here, and you're not bad company. Not at all. But your head - and your heart - is elsewhere." She offers a few suggestions as he grabs his laptop, charger, a few movies, and his smile becomes a trace more hopeful.
He wonders what Sherlock will make of the latest one, something that sounds like a cross between a soft M sound and a growl. He will probably identify it as something complicated and indicative of high-level thought processes. There are times when John doesn't have the heart to tell him that some of the growls go along with filling a nappy or that she is simply mimicking the sounds he makes when he plays with her in the evenings.
"Alive," Sherlock finishes. "I mean, I knew you weren't exaggerating, but ... that was pretty constant among all of them today."
John smiled. "It'll be fine." Hearing that had been not only helpful, but necessary. Very soon, time to get excited. He knew it would be a moment none of them ever forgot.
And, stomach full of lamb, well wishes, and a job well done, she slept too, comfortable in the knowledge that tonight had been quite a success.
"Mycroft Holmes. Sherlock's brother." Inside John's head, he hears some sort of snark from Sherlock, an adjective like older, wanker, annoying, or something weight-related. It makes him feel warm, the connection. And then ... feeling the distance, hollow and a little empty.
The doors are swung back into place, the curtain drawn, and the respiratory therapist stays for a while adjusting settings and waiting, hovering.
Baker Street seemed overrun and its occupants (save one) quite focused on the newest family member. Sam, Rosie, and John gathered around in the sitting room as she sniffed, got acquainted, nosing at furnishings and dust particles and every scent that had ever been left in the room. Each held out a hand from time to time, trying to get her attention. She gave them token sniffs, and then would approach Sherlock. Who ignored her.
He rolls his eyes at John's words. "I've heard this before. But, this?" and he gestures with a still-shaky hand toward where John is pressing. "Bit more risk now? A
"Just take care of it." The smile was just a little bit sinister, manipulative, and it rankled in John's gut. "You always manage to."
Since he was closer to the door, closer to the tin of baked goodies, he indicated the chair and that Mrs. Hudson should put the container down. "And bread pudding tomorrow, that would be fine."
"Fractured fibula, non-displaced, no internal fixation was needed after a simple reduction. Leg'll get casted once the fasciotomies heal enough." John looked up at the plural form of the word with enough surprise on his face that the physician noticed, clarified. "We added a medial fasciotomy to the lateral that was done pre hospital. Was that your doing?" He pointed toward Sherlock's left leg, where at present it was wrapped in elastic bandages, elevated on a single thin pillows, and surrounded by several white, blue-clipped ice packs.
Briefly, he considered throwing the device in frustration against the nearest dilapidated wall. It was only the faintest measure of self-control - and the knowledge that to do so would complicate things by its absence - stopped him.
John'd even caught him a few days before with his hand over his sternum, not quite Levine's sign but close, had asked if he was all right. Sherlock'd snorted, immediately pulled his hand off his chest, then puffed a short indignant laugh, and assured him he was fine. John had gone so far as to grab at his wrist, ostensibly to check his pulse, and Sherlock had pulled away quickly.
"Probably getting transfer orders out of the ICU later on today, once we get his oxygen level up and the liters down under six." John gaze flicks again to the flowmeter, set at eight. "What questions do you have for me?" She asks John but gestures to Sherlock as well. When both are silent at first, she makes sure the call bell is close by, lets them know that intensivist rounds are starting shortly and they are both welcome and expected to participate if they'd like.
it doesn't take more than one single slip, one trigger, to reactivate all of those powerful sleeping circuits, the drive, the call of the wild. The affinity of a brain on drugs - the brain not only remembers,
Fucks sake, quip moping. The reunion tonight is just so much needed for my own mental well-being. Reminiscing back to more carefree days. Going to have a great time.
"Well," he said, taking a deep breath and looking more nervous than he really should have. "Here's the thing: I talked with my teacher to get permission to change it up a little."
"You would have also been unhappy if I'd chosen the generic 'blood thinner' category too. What it boils down to is deciding what is most appropriate therapy, and getting started on it. Until then, the heparin continues."
"Just checking in. You guys okay?" With minimal fuss, she holds out a thermometer, which Sherlock puts under his tongue, cycles a blood pressure, checks his oxygen level. It is passable but the oxygen stays where it is. She checks out the computer screen, where the characters are awkwardly frozen in digital mid-movement. "Oh, this is a great movie. One of my favourites." With a small torch in her hand, she checks out the flowmeter, looks at the backlit IV pump. "Things look good. IV site is ...?" Sherlock holds out his arm for her to check and holds back what John knows would like to be a biting comment. Her eyes settle on the beer and she grins just a little. "Don't over-do that, okay? Sometimes certain medications along with alcohol aren't a good idea. Side effects and interactions, one can potentiate the other." Sherlock nudges John under the covers. "Especially blood thinners."
The next morning, John is chuckling over something Lydia and Rosie are doing, a conversation of sorts made of grunts, sounds, gestures, and giggles. They banter back and forth, taking turns, and he is reminded a little bit of Chewbacca, BB8, and the other Star Wars droids (all of which, he realises that he can name, much to Sherlock's eye-rolling chagrin). The sounds his daughter makes are similar to the expressive noises made by the non-verbal characters of that series. He thinks briefly that this is cute enough to video, he'll want to remember it. Lydia makes an unexpected noise along with a very silly face, and Rosie's shrieking and heart-warming delight is impossibly contagious - they all share a few moments of laughter. There is a nostalgic moment in which John wishes not for the first time, that Sherlock was home to see it, he laments that he is missing out, but he knows that time is counting down. Hopefully. Lydia makes another face, hands Rosie a hat to play with, to put on, pull down, take off, and John finishes his tea. His entertainment is interrupted by his mobile.
"Um, no." John can't stop the chuckle at his very atypically forward statement. "But I confess I like what you're thinking about." Sherlock's hand is warm in his own. "No, I meant without extra help. On our own, so to speak."
." John's eyes remained closed as the tech added, "Lost all five of those brought in. All five." There was more fussing, a footlocker opening, a muttered curse - "Fuck this shit!" - the sound of rooting. "I'm hitting the showers," was the last thing he said before leaving again.
That night, they ended up in Sherlock's bed for what was intended to be a brief visit, relaxing together, a few kisses and such, until both of them fell into a deep sleep.
"I understand. Then find someone you know, either of those friends, ask to borrow something for a little while. Set it out somewhere. The point is to find something to look at other than drab open spaces. Give your mind something to appreciate." Both of them stood, knowing it was time to move John along, end the appointment. The brief, in-office nap had actually helped him, and he was feeling less exhausted than when he'd arrived. "Are you at least willing to consider it?"
Sherlock made a face, as if entertaining a foreign idea, then he launched on the snippy again. "You're not going to be all bored and annoying during the concert, are you?"
"I don't ... I didn't ... I want ..." Uncharacteristically tongue-tied, Sherlock growls low in his throat.
Hard swallow, intentional inhale, silently. Thrum-thrum-thrum in Mycroft's ears, stress related, heart-pounding response to his indescribable fear. "Keep me posted."
Who got out of bed at o'dark thirty to play the violin. Loudly. Without tuning. Deafeningly. Into the amplification microphone he'd rigged up on his mobile.
"To bed," John said, intervening before Sherlock got more riled up. Sam got up and almost immediately turned to go upstairs. "Wait, good night," John reminded him and he returned for a quick round of hugs.
"And we're okay," John breathed back. "Feet warm enough?" he asked then, his voice soft and barely a whisper.
The words settled, and a faint chuckle ruminated in Sherlock's chest as he considered the unintentional double entendre, and John followed, with a growling, "Oh, I'm bloody sure we can think of something." He rolled, his arm encircling Sherlock's waist, unrushed, his chest pressing up lightly against Sherlock's back as he wriggled in behind him. "Unless you'd rather just ... take a nap or something."
John moved himself, coming along beside the trembling man. He let his mouth press lightly into the back of Sherlock's arm, breathing with a warm huff as he moved to lick at Sherlock's already pebbled nipple. He let his open mouth shift to the pale waist, in toward the furred abdominal musculature, his mouth open and his own body stretching to tease, to suckle, to glide a few times before moving away. The layer of clothing, John's only, against Sherlock's skin added a dynamic, a separation, a teasing that made them both quite aware of their different positions. But it was time, John knew, to up the ante, to change the situation, and he quietly removed his clothing, set it aside and off the bed. He drew up alongside Sherlock, his skin faintly warmer than Sherlock's as he moved. "This is very nice," John admired, keeping his tone low as he let his hand come along Sherlock's ribs, his back, to support his pelvis as he took most of Sherlock's weight, supporting the lean mass of Sherlock's form, shifting him carefully down so that he was laying on his side, arms still extended upward.
two damaged umbrellas, both handles chewed, one of them had been a custom, handmade edition that Sherlock recognised as a gift from a foreign dignitary
John joined in the staff that lined the entire hall of the unit, applauding. The patient glanced around, searching, looking, and landed on John. "Thank you," he tried to say, but the words were thick and hard to understand.
Exhaustion and guilt and sleepless nights overwhelm him until one morning he finds himself handing Rosie to Molly, so that his feet can carry him to Baker Street without conscious decision. It was a spontaneous enough decision that even Mycroft and the British Government does not know and cannot prevent it from happening.
Sherlock kept his voice light and quiet. "Thank god he made it here safely. On his own, even." Sherlock shook his head a little, imaging that the journey couldn't have been easy. With a furrowed brow, he settled Sameer sideways in the chair, leaning back himself, trying to get comfortable. He found such comfort himself in holding the boy as he tucked Sameer's shoulder against his own, feeling the warmth and hoping the security in the hug was reciprocated. "I was worried about you," he said quietly to Sameer as he brushed his fringe off his forehead. "I'm sorry you didn't come get me first." His hand rubbed a small circle against Sameer's back and he felt the boy relax slightly. "I didn't realise ..." and he let the sentence trail off.
By the time Sherlock - exhausted on physical and emotional levels - opens his eyes and shows signs of alertness, John is sitting upright, quietly, watching and waiting. The recliner has been returned to its upright position on silent mechanisms, the blanket folded. He's slid back into his shoes and run his fingers through his hair, but no more than that in his attempt to not disturb Sherlock's much-needed slumber. Two nurses come in, tentatively, report sheet in the oncoming nurse's hand, for walking rounds. There is a brief introduction, a confirmation of the oxygen flow level - back down to two liters, oxygen level of ninety-one, and the heparin infusion continuing at the previous rate. "Need anything?" the new nurse asks.
John felt bad for him, that the desperation had won. That he'd given up and then given in. And even as he began to mourn the loss, deep down, he could completely understand it.
The process for leaving the unit was to leave as many germs behind as possible. He would take nothing with him but the intense memories, the truly unbelievable impression of the sick, of the virulence, of the threat. He approached the office, stopping to wash his hands again, bin the shoe covers, hand sanitise. Once in the office, he wiped down a small table, binned the plastic bag that had held his mobile, wiped that along with his name badge. The scrubs were next, right there by the laundry, the surgical hat along with, and though he was alone, he cared not a whit that he was in the open room. His locker next, wiping down the shoes that he bagged, stashing them. His own clothes felt like much of an improvement, his street shoes and jacket. He donned a new surgical mask - required while in the building, in public spaces for the general population now too - and his personal items, and left the ICU.
He leaves the overhead projector on and delves into the electron and proton responses to magnetic forces.
The boy had been - and continued - watching Rosie's teacher walk away, taking a few animated skips over to one of the other children who was leaving. The hugs, the touches, the fondness was such an intrinsic part of her that John barely noticed anymore, so it didn't even catch his eye. But it had definitely caught Sameer's. His eyes were riveted, the set of his mouth just interested, his body language as if he'd forgotten all about himself as he watched.
"I was trying hard not to," John confessed, then snorted softly as he tried - unsuccessfully - to suppress the laughter.
, and moved him closer to administration, out of the action. The messages went from uncertain to bad to hopeless.
The day is cold, rainy, and full of little irritants. Although Sherlock forgoes the oxygen much of the time, he is aggravated by the ongoing sensation of being winded. His oxygen levels remain okay, and both John and Sherlock find that they check less often as time passes. It is more the physiologic feeling than actual physical symptoms, and of course, is worse with activity such as climbing the steps.

Who decried all medical advice, knowledge, and recommendations about healing. And health in general.
From the hallway, they heard a chuckle, a giggle, the sound of one of Rosie's new favourite toys. "I should go," Sherlock worried, tapping at the door.
Unsurprisingly, Sherlock doesn't respond verbally to that. Instead he sets his jaw, stares out the window, then reaches up with a finger to rip off the oxygen tubing.
And especially, outside of the recent horrors of the bedside, it represents the facility response to the global medical situation as they provide an outlet and support to those who most definitely need it.
"I'll play," John said, sick of their banter and their cleverness and their suspicion and most of all, their baseline annoyance with each other. He'd quickly surmised the way through their stubbornness was often to usher things forward.
"How's that feel?" The question was careful, slowly breathed, not sharp. Other than the faint wriggling Sherlock's feet had done at the first touch of the blanket, he hadn't moved, trusting John and following the expected obedience, the waiting for instructions. "Here," John added, tucking a fold of the fabric into Sherlock's palm, one then the other. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock's fingers clenched, touching, searching, as he explored what John had given him. What John had allowed him.
Greg drops the final item on his checklist, at least for tonight. "What you said, John, about the last thing you help someone do?" Greg pauses, waits for John to nod. "There may actually be one more task. If you're willing, that is. So here's the thing ... "
Further inside the room, Sherlock was quite aware of John's distress, hearing some and intuiting the rest. Soft words from the nurse attending to him, soothing, a cloth to his face, and another to wipe at his mouth. A suction catheter, a bit of gagging, a tissue. The sound of the bed being adjusted. "If the vomiting stops?" Sherlock could hear the desperation creeping into his words, his voice.
Rosie reaches for the cup again, holds it, then dangles it over the side of her tray, watching John for his reaction.
"Yes." The intercom buzzes again, and John holds his breath a little as he gathers that it's not going too well inside the procedure room. "Right, I'll call blood bank." The technician makes a shooing gesture and dismisses John as he picks up the telephone. "I need that unit of A neg, rapid release for Holmes, in IR room one." A pause. "Right. Courier it over stat, I have no one to send."
John kept a weathered eye on the table. Sherlock, redecorating his plate, shifting the contents with the tines of his fork, arranging things into something complicated - likely a chemical equation - that only he would understand. Not hungry, then, he's about finished. Rosie, all her favourites gone and the remnants of everything she didn't care for untouched on her divided plate; she'd ultimately done well. Sam's plate, curiously and atypically remained fairly full.
He had bought them each an activity book, a small model for Sam, a bead craft for Rosie, just something to make sure they didn't feel too neglected. And to assuage his own very small case of guilt at going off without them.
John's feet were quiet as he hovered in the hallway, where he could see Sherlock, his feet bare, his dressing gown armor pulled up tight around his neck. His expression, uncertain.
" She nodded at them both. "I'm your cardiologist. Family?" she asked in John's direction, looking between them.
In the silence, she must have realised it on her own and her expression went from somewhat teasing to pained. "You're serious?" Her gaze fell to John, who nodded, knowing his face was sad, knowing that he was disappointing her, knowing that it was for her own protection. "What about Rosie?"
Off the edges of the porch, there is the sound of a night animal calling to another, quietly. There are the soft chirps of crickets, of the faint wind in the distant trees, of a car still a long way off. There are soft smiles as they stand up, still holding fingertips, and carry their things inside. The door is closed, locked, and inside, their breaths become warmer and the sheets envelop them softly, the weight of the duvet insulating them from the rest. Quiet affirmations - oh god yes, more, yes please, just like that, almost - hover in the air, the quiet moan beyond actual words, dissipate into the woodwork, leaving behind the sweet, sleepy snuggles of two sated, happy men who are at peace with each other and with the world.
"You're not broken. And there's nothing to fix about you." His hand reaches out, covers Sherlock's, settles down the twitching and restlessness.
There is progress noted with each physician appointment that John makes Sherlock schedule and keep. Well, mostly progress.
"Prime seating." The clarification raised one of Mycroft's eyebrows. "No further back than third row. Nothing on the outside edges."
"You've never done this. Ever. Not even once." John tucked in his shirt, and was in the process of sliding his belt through the loops when he asked, "Am I being manipulated? Played?"
Dr. Steinberg interrupts his musings when he grabs the attention of someone walking by, "Hey!" A staff members is in the hallway, and Dean stops them, asks for a bottle of water and if they have any food in the department yet. A few minutes later, there is a small pastry, banana, and water bottle next to John.
The confession was a hard one, and John knew the honesty had cost him. Slowly, quietly, he toed off his shoe again and tucked it on the foot of the mattress atop the covers, adjacent to Sherlock's foot. Neither mentioned it although Sherlock's gaze met and held John's again. John whispered back, "I know. Stay anyway."
McBurney's point - specific pain. Rebound tenderness - oh, yes. John's assessment was quick and as gentle as he could make it.
The haematologist, Dr. Edwards, explains that at this moment there is not much to add, but that perhaps at one of the follow-up visits Sherlock should consider getting some additional testing done to make sure about platelet function, perhaps consider some of the other markers that could predispose a person to increased clotting. "I just need to do a brief examination, did you want to step out while I do?" he asks and John shakes his head no. He begins carefully at Sherlock's head, looking at eyelids, the inside of Sherlock's lip, then he looks carefully at some of the IV sites, the arterial line, Sherlock's nailbeds, particularly of the previously-cooler left hand, then pulls back almost all of the covers to visually inspect the femoral line site, his skin in general, and the petechiae on Sherlock's lower legs, one of which that is still fairly prominent. "So Dr. Benton told me you're a physician, so ... He'll continue on the heparin for now. For a while, actually. They've placed the IVC filter, definitely a good idea. And conservative approach to anticoagulation is going to mean at least a handful of days on IV heparin while you transition to ... well, I'm not sure which one they'll be recommending. Apixaban might be highest efficacy for him, either that or clopidogrel. Which shouldn't be started until at least tomorrow, at the earliest. Longer if there are other procedures he'll need. And that's providing the endo tube gets removed. Otherwise, he'll need a feeding tube short term."
"I know." And John had known, obviously, tyranny of the urgent and all that went along with their lifestyles.
John hesitates, waits until Sherlock is looking at him. Expectantly. John hopes he does not disappoint when he says, "That's about the most idiotic thing I've ever heard you say."
John can barely make out a few words. "Fluoro on ... try the smaller guide-wire ... another three mills of contrast ... cycle another pressure, will you?"
"Any pain? Pressure? Trouble breathing or swallowing?" She waited for him to shake his head. "Okay good. I'll see you in the morning, review things with you again. Discharge instructions, medications, follow up appointment - tomorrow. Do you know how to check your pulse rate?"
The Pause is a real thing, begun by Jonathan Bartels in an emergency room setting in 2009 as a response to processing an unsuccessful cardiac arrest.  The verbiage can go something like this:  “Could we take a moment just to Pause and honor this person in the bed. This was someone who was alive and now has passed away. They were someone who loved and was loved. They were someone’s friend and family member. In our own way and in silence let us stand and take a moment to honor both this person in the bed and all the valiant efforts that were made on their behalf.”
"All right." He figured the tea was mostly gone already, and he could grab one of Mrs. Hudson's baked goods on the way out the door. "I suppose rushing now is okay, but later tonight? I'm taking my time with you." He turned toward Sherlock, his own hands sliding under Sherlock's tee shirt, reaching, hugging, feeling a bit of the urgency and simmering desire between them. The bed, fortunately, hadn't been made, and the sheets were still sleepy-warm and welcoming. With a slow and steady inhale, John tucked a knee onto the bed as he eased them down onto it.
John had always known a lot about small victories, growing up with a clandestine dysfunctional family. His strategy for surviving med school was take one day, one exam, one class, one semester at a time. There'd been small victories in his residency, in all of the steps of his military career. Over time, small victories usually led to winning the war.
The times when he thought about the deliberateness of breathing, what it meant when breathing was absent.
"Waiting for you to tell me what you're after. You know, that question about things we can't do at home."
Mrs. Hudson, of course noticed, and swatted at Sherlock's elbow. "Stop that and be nice." Meanwhile, John jerked his foot away, getting it safely out of Sherlock's ridiculous long-limbed reach. There was some glaring that followed between the men, although both of them knew better than to even
John considers the most pressing questions, of which there are many, chooses one. "The risks, I understand. Will he need intubation for the procedure? Because, oxygen wise, he's still at over six liters and probably isn't going to tolerate being flat too well on top of it."
Just the other day, he'd watched Sherlock navigate a small victory with Rosie. She'd been "helping" as he'd done some last minute investigating, incorporating some findings at the microscope, switching between the equipment and his laptop (another small victory: using his own computer at least some of the time), and she'd been all of her two-year-old kind of in the way but very interested in what he was doing, wanting to be part of his attention. John had been sitting since arriving home from work, mostly staring at a mindless book he'd been reading, relaxing, enjoying the non-urgency of being home, of listening to his special people interact. It wasn't until Sherlock's tone changed just a little that he started paying attention, though he didn't move much or say anything.
Molly held one of Sam's hands, Rosie still in her arms, and Mrs. Hudson began to shoo them physically from the flat. There were quick hugs between all parties.
The days flew by, case solved with minimum of haggling, nothing illegal, and no threat of imminent physical danger. John had a great time; Sherlock would have rated the case as boring, less than a three, but he did throw half a temper tantrum and deduce some financial fraud and two marital indiscretions as an added bonus.
And so the seed was planted. And Sameer said he was at least interested in popping by to see what organised football would entail. John made a few phone calls, and the following week, Sameer had been invited to try out an evening practice just to see if he liked it. The coach had been very impressed, outfitted him with loaned shin pads, and then pairing him up with an older, taller teammate for the evening while keeping a careful eye on him. At the end, the coach thanked him for coming and when Sameer responded that it had been fun, the coach had given John a practice schedule and game rotation. "Hopefully you'll be able to come back?"
The rise of John's chest, ribs over lungs, shoulders elevating, belly expanding normally was followed by a relaxation, a twitch of the hug and embrace as John settled as much as he could against Sherlock. His whisper was sad. "I think they might be, yes." In his mind, he knew he would never unsee some of the ominous Covid findings, the lab sheets with ferritin, d-dimers and c-reactive proteins high, the terrible blood gas results. The black appearance of the patients' blood in the tubes. He would never unsee the radiographs, lungs whited out, patchy bilateral alveolar infiltrates. Dan's, particularly, were staggeringly bad. The way the patients breathed before intubation, the labouring and gasping, the effort, the terror of what was happening etched on all of their faces, patients and staff alike, although for different reasons.
He pressed his lips to the closest thing he could reach, Sherlock's shoulder, the back of his upper arm, before leaving the bed. His steps were sure and confident despite the fact that he was still naked. And he would stay that way, at the very least until Sherlock was covered too. It assured that he was attuned to the need, sensitive to the temperature, the dynamic, and no more chilly (or overheated) than Sherlock. His own muscles trembled at the recent exertion, the recent exercise, the draining aerobic workout, the intensity and fulfillment of their ... session, as he moved to the thermostat, turned it up lest they chill as the sweat cooled and dried on their skin. As heart rates eased. As muscles previously strained were able to stretch, to recover. Fibers, fluids, electrolytes shifting - muscle repair and protein stores working their behind the scenes magic, homeostasis.
"It'd be good, but ... feels too soon, for me even." Her gesture, a gentle arm spreading, requesting more if he wanted. "I mean, I was in a dark place myself. It just seems that getting in to something like this ... I might not be ready." Discussing this with her, and his thoughts settled. "I do kind of ... want to. I'm intrigued."
Sherlock blinked, looked away, and exhaled. The internal wrestling continued, until Sherlock let out another faint sigh. "I hate this."
"Do you want this jab or not?" Tactfully, he doesn't mention that previously Sherlock had tried to recruit Mycroft's assistance in Tier One access to it.
John found himself oddly amused as he gathered himself for bed, bringing his laptop and something to eat. Opening up and getting comfortable, he connected by video. The initial picture was grainy, but not such poor quality that John couldn't see annoyance radiating off his flatmate in waves.
No matter the how, all of a sudden they were together. They shared an embrace, the back pat, the coming to terms and resolution of any non remembered issues. Healing and peace. Sherlock doesn't make a comment about Mycroft's weight or his food or anything else. That fodder has been - thankfully - left behind.
"Actually, it might. Because unlike your injury, this could return at any time." The words were delivered with vehemence and hung there in the room.
"Oh just stop it," the nurse, Sheila, says, but she is a little playful in the delivery. "We usually transfer people with your particular situation down to the morgue, so just ..." her words trail off, and she realises that she's perhaps coming off a little harsh. "I'm not saying it's easy or that, wow, wasn't this a great time. But you know, not everyone gets better here. So yes, lucky." Sherlock is looking a bit chastised, and the nurse gives him a hug. "I'll miss you. Both of you."
"Right now, I'm just so tired. Too tired to be held to anything I agree to. Too tired to get up." His eyes were heavy, getting heavier, the weight of his situation sapping all strength from his body. And it showed.
His delivery was with enough attitude that John could do nothing else save chuckle, and at the noise, Sherlock's head pivoted to pin the glare on John. John leaned back in a little, not cowed in the least. "Yes, we humans do tend to feed our feelings." His proclamation was shortly followed by a quiet snicker from the woman in the doorway, and he wasn't done, "which is fine, by the way," and Mrs. Hudson smiled again, though Sherlock only huffed a few times before rolling his eyes and relaxing, glaring at the window as if it had done something personally affronting.
John had tossed, turned, rolled over, nodded back off to sleep, only vaguely aware that Sherlock had indeed finally crawled out of bed. The question, along with the fresh aroma of a hot beverage, was motivation enough to push up on an elbow, eyes open full. "God yes." He felt well rested, and it was glorious.
"I understood none of that, you know." Greg is still standing awkwardly as John takes another bite of something in front of him, bins the trash, recaps the water bottle.
The shower is an oversized, handicapped accessible stall with a handheld shower detachment head at the top. John adjusts the water to comfortably warm and cues Sherlock through getting out of the ugly patient gown (though he suggests draping it across his lap after he's seated on the bench) and removes the heart monitor. He slides the plastic sleeve up over his arm, tapes the one end, then disconnects the heparin, flushing the site, capping the tubing, and securing the other end of the sleeve with more tape. Then, with the rest of the shower supplies already in reach, he takes down the shower wand and starts soaking his scalp, using his other hand to tip Sherlock's chin up. He hands Sherlock the bottle of hospital-grade shampoo, an offer to let him take care of it.
Although he knows it is an impossibility, he wishes he could trade places with Sherlock. To take the shortness of breath and the restrictions on his movements and the discomfort. And the long road ahead - hopefully - long road of recovery. And although he realises that an actual exchange is not possible, he also knows that he will be waiting.
"Oh good, I can say hello too," Greg settles back on the chair, picks up Rosie, "To your papa and ..."
"Yesterday was difficult," John mentions, knowing that he doesn't have to justify himself, but doesn't mind explaining. "And I ended up back over here late."
"I didn't know. I observed." Sherlock's voice is a little muted and slow in cadence, but undeniably his with a twinge of attitude.
There is a somewhat disappointed, resigned sigh, as though the ninety second update is now going to take ten minutes. To his credit, he perches on one of the chairs directly in front of John. "You'll get more info from his admitting doc, and the intensivist in the ICU later. Earlier this evening, he collapsed, brought here, and was having trouble breathing. In the A&E --"
"... and I'm not sure about ..." Sherlock touched at his own lip, his eyes flicking toward John's mouth, the spot where his hand rested on the table.
"In a pandemic?" Sherlock queried, disbelieving. He knew how serious they were both taking the quarantine, the distancing, the risk.
A few days later, on the weekend so there wasn't school or other early responsibilities to attend to, John and Sherlock were up and about in the kitchen. There was tea, toast, and soft discussions about things to do later in the day, routine stuff, and the assignment of tasks grew to teasing appreciation of John's latest custom blend of tea. A threat of lip-tasting turned into an embrace, the full frontal hug turned into a bit of a rub, an invitation, a promise when they could hear feet on the stairs, descending, invading.
The Airbnb John had reserved was easily accessed, located a few blocks off the main street of the small town, chosen intentionally to be out of the way and obscure, within reason. John had selected it for the location, the amenities, and the proximity to a few restaurants, cafes, and a limited option of walking-distanced night clubs and bars if they chose. They'd barely set their bags and coats down inside the door and cast a quick glance around the simple but elegant cottage, before John pressed against Sherlock, advancing on him with a growl. "I think it's your turn to be just a little bit frustrated. Aroused. Hard. Teased." Firm lips, teeth, tongue, angled jaws, insistent hands - John leveraged it all along with the faintest appreciative grumble deep in his throat. The pent-up energy between them grew until John summoned his inner strength and stepped back. His eyes again bore into Sherlock's. "Take off your clothes." He didn't wait, but locked the door, assured himself that the blinds and curtains were drawn enough to ensure their privacy, and took the food into the kitchen. As promised, the refrigerator was somewhat stocked, and he added to it. Sherlock was still watching him when he glanced over his shoulder. "All of them. What are you waiting for?"
"It's not forever." Cautiously, their eyes continue to hold, anxiety from the one and support from the other. John's hand finds Sherlock's jaw, slides in, and his eyes flick to Sherlock's mouth. He wants to swoop in, kiss him, let their lips meet and reassure and comfort. Instead, he lets out a small chuckle of nervous realisation. "Should probably brush first."
God he'd been hoping for more. And it had looked like, perhaps, things might have been getting ready to change.
"Thanks for thinking the best of me." He said this with a smile, curling onto his side then, tucking his hand under the pillow as his back arched, the line of his form under the sheets strong and smooth. "No. I merely know you're shouldering a terrible burden at work. I know you're in the heat of the battle now, and ... I actually was just trying to ... do something
"My appetite? You aren't complaining about things I like and the means I employ to get what I want?" The words hovered there while they stared at each other, John's hand still over Sherlock's pulse point. "I'm not talking specifically about ..."
He didn't point out that both of them were exhausted. And stressed. "I suppose." The room was quiet and still and ... slightly unsettled. "You're sure you'll be ..."
"Surgeon. Pity you didn't answer my question about mechanism of injury and fall distance." His words were intense. "Blink of an eye? Probably not that quick. I'm sure they dangled some hope in front of you, maybe time will heal, one day at a time, and other cliched nonsense. And then, when you were still feeling optimistic, the rug got pulled out from under you."
The sigh Mycroft huffed out was sadly disappointed. "I bought you something. Quite a while ago actually. I know you don't want to hear it, but I know you're working hard. Paying your dues, so to speak."
He wasn't to get his wish for a while. Minutes dragged into more minutes, and it was nearly half an hour before Sherlock turned his head, sniffing unhappily at the oxygen, noting the sensation of something foreign. Underneath closed eyelids, his eye movement became more abundant. "Hey," John said quietly as he watched Sherlock shift his legs under the covers.
"Yes. Certificate of Completion of Training. It's a presentation. Should be short and sweet. There are a couple of awards being handed out."
"Much as I would like to have an impact on that, sadly, I must admit that my powers are slightly limited when it comes to intracellular, or," he angles his head as he searches for the right words, "
"Yes." In the background, Mycroft could hear the faint sounds of a busy nursing unit, alarms, muffled voices, beeping monitors. "We're trying to hold off as long as possible if we can, but he's showing some signs of fatigue, and his oxygen levels just aren't responding as we'd hoped."
Greg chuckled as he watched the confrontation, the way Sherlock was actively bristling, the way John's hackles rose. He tapped on Rosie's shoulder. "How about you and I go for a little walk or something."
"It will be a year tomorrow, when we gotcha." John knew it would further escalate Sherlock as he explained to Sam. "When we gotcha. We
"Does it matter?" John said, returning from where he'd been near the doorway to Sherlock's bedside. "You'll only text me and demand that I come earlier anyway."
"You have barricaded me in the hallway?" For a moment, it appeared she was going to move the chair out of the way and come in, but then her frown of confusion gave way to a realisation. "Oh." She grinned, her sweet, tolerant, maternal smile at them both. "Well, pish, I'm not worried about that. Now get this chair out of the way and I'll come in and fix us all a cuppa to have alongside."
Baker Street was pummeled with rain, big heavy drops that pinged and clicked on the windows. Now and again, there was the sizzle and hiss and rumble of thunder and lightening. It was either very late or very early, or technically both, and during this particular thunderstorm that was brewing, one especially close, loud bolt seemed to shake the flat until the structure creaked and complained. Rosie awakened with a startled cry, got out of bed.
The door to John's room widened, and the nurse walked in on silent shoes again. She held a blanket out, and after he nodded, she spread it out over both he and Sameer. It was fresh from the warmer, and more soothing than Sherlock would have expected. The door narrowed on her way out, and so did his eyelids. In those few uninterrupted minutes, all three of them managed to - at least briefly - sleep.
So he settled for a third option: stay put and wait for him to wake up on his own. He did, however, slowly remove his hand from Sherlock's relaxed one, settle best he could into the chair at the bedside, and try to get comfortable. His roving attention went from his mobile to Sherlock's bedside monitor (still sinus rhythm) to Sherlock's position of repose (resting).
He whisks off his gloves, washes his hands. "I would say good job and congratulations, but I wouldn't want to be petty about it. Urinating is not a marketable skill," John tells him. "You have to feel a little better though."
"Yes," John answered immediately without hesitation. "And I'm asking you to stay." He spoke quietly, sincerely, his expression open and honest.
There was the beginnings of heart-pounding concern starting to bloom in John's chest. Toward the kitchen, where no one else had really noticed what was going on at the door, he said, "I'll be back inside in just a moment," then stepped through into the hallway and closed the door behind him. "Yes, I am." John wasn't entirely sure that he recognised Dari, but it could have been. John held eye contact with the visitor, searching, seeking, discerning. The woman's eyes had been looking into the room, but now holding John's remained bright, intense, and something much more. Perhaps there was something broken too. There were deep lines about her eyes and mouth, and in John's mind there was something also just a little bit familiar - and hurt.
"Not much. Coughing on the tube. Getting glared at by a few idiots." His brow furrows but then he lets loose a small smirk. "Someone told me I should see a bloody physician, to 'get looked at,' and I remember thinking that I was getting close to home. To my physician." John keeps any commentary to himself, this is Sherlock's story. "Vague A&E, maybe. Or it was when they were stabbing me in the leg. What is it with you people and the whole 'little pinch and some burning' phrase? Because it's a stabbing knife wound and being set on fire." His voice drops a little lower. "I was all uncovered, at least part of that time. Everything was cold."
and had been nauseatingly nice, interested in meeting up with John but his schedule was understandably tight, with his life going as planned and his family and his job and his good mental health and his
She almost cackles, and Sherlock appreciates her levity. Her sharp eyes take in the room, his perceptions, the way John is more relaxed. “Pretty sure I’m on to the whole lot of you.”
The clearly spoken words pierce John's slumber, which has been terribly fitful at first, with him only sliding into REM sleep toward dawn only to be interrupted by Sherlock's somewhat offended, gravelly voice. John bites back the first several retorts that come to mind, takes a few sharp looks at Sherlock - skin pink, breathing easily, oxygen still on his face - another miracle, John knows - and arches his back as he stretches his sore, stiff muscles. "Well, next time you decide to ... almost cash it all in, can you give me some notice so I can make arrangements for Rosie? And find someone else to worry about you."
In response, there was a soft nod, a shudder of breathing, a deeper inhale, a full exhale. Sherlock's eyes fluttered open, blissed out, and a few blinks later, he locked his gaze on John's somber eyes. The exchange, non-verbal -
For a hot minute, John thought about lying. He thought about keeping Sherlock unburdened, about trying to spare him, about steeling himself to handle this on his own. "Mmm-hmm. I suppose."
Rob takes account of those present, that everyone is ready, and doesn't mess around. "Let's go." The pace picks up as they leave the radiology suite.
He doesn't answer, but hoists himself to his feet, shuffles away. The irritation is as clearly visible on his back as if there was a neon sign hanging and flashing from it.
John glanced at his mobile for the time, assuring himself that he still had plenty before leaving for work. His transition shifts at the urgent care clinic were still short ones but busy. Walk-in traffic and those with appointments visited the practice, seeing him for screenings, jabs, minor injuries, non-acute emergencies, and the occasional out-of-the-ordinary oddity. It felt good - useful, satisfying, and thankfully, relievingly
The man smiled a bit broader. "London and Afghanistan are very different, aren't they?" Sameer shrugged, not really wanting to engage with this man who was standing between he and his papa. "Have you been in London a long time?"
He reassured her quickly. "You don't have to say anything, if you don't want to." With a small frown, her eyes flicked to Sherlock who was just looking back, watching, silent. John smiled at that, at her obvious concern. "It's okay.
Thank you for your service, and I hope that despite the challenges, your living arrangement will continue to meet your needs.
"And moral, ethical means," John clarified, sending a somewhat exasperated glare in Sherlock's direction.
Mike refocuses. "And why we are still doing what we do, perhaps in a different role and a different mindset.
"He has Laila's smile." Sonya's expression softened as she looked at a black and white close-up photo of Sameer. His dark hair was neatly combed, his smile and his eyes lively. Her words were tender as she looked, seeing the echo of her late daughter in this stranger's face, her grandson. "Oh look at him!" Her eyes grew just slightly moist. "He is handsome."
Sherlock gave his head a quick negative shake, clearly not wanting to follow directions. And then gagged again.
Wearing masks only in positive rooms. Now, wearing them all the time when not home. I'm not sure we will ever get that innocence back again either.
John smiled at Sameer even as he felt badly about the miscommunication. "He wants you to play." Sameer was quiet so he continued. "We have the schedule, the list of when to be there. They practice every week. In the evenings. And there are football games just about every weekend."
John takes another deep breath, slow and steady, intentional and a little heavy. And closes his eyes.
Blurry, he sat up a little, feeling the loss of warmth and loss of companionship. Clearing his throat, he rasped, "You too."
The physician stood with arms on his hips at the foot of John's bed. "And you've eaten lunch, kept something down today?"
Both of them turned abruptly to see him, neither expecting his presence, although John was watching Rosie for her reaction.
"It becomes my business when these legal entities need someone to come collect you." He hesitated only a moment before letting some truth seep into the discussion. "Apparently these workers find you worthy of bettering yourself. They would like you to clean up your act before something worse happens."
"I think we can do the usual, forty five minutes from now. If he needs more time, text me and I'll enter more orders." She removed her gloves, washed her hands, and came back to John's side. "Thanks for your help. Little unusual, we seldom do this with family present. But I'm not sure it would have gone on without you." They left the room still low-lit while they cleaned up from the procedures, the nurse monitoring vital signs and the rest of Sherlock's assessment. "Have a seat if you want. He'll wake up on his own from here. It was a lot of sedation, though."
"I'll set yours, here. And climb in." Sherlock set one down, kept the other, and settled on top of the duvet. He'd managed to pull on the pair of pyjama bottoms that John had packed, but his feet were bare, long toes poking out, slightly bony and well manicured. John apparently stared at them a mite too long. "What? They're feet. My feet. Functional means of locomotion." He wriggled his toes, his tone faintly amused. "It's like you've never seen them before."
The crinkles around the ice-blue eyes narrowed just a little, concerned, puzzled. "Are you thinking about --?"
John hears Sherlock mutter something and he side-steps to the head of the bed while the doc straightens the covers, recovering Sherlock's legs. "You okay?"
Sherlock faltered a little getting out of the cab, his usual routine derailed, the cab-mate who usually shared the back seat with him conspicuously absent. There was no other choice but for him to reach for his wallet, secure money, pay his own fare, get his own door for gods sake rather than attend to things on his mobile. John usually took care of things like that. And so much more.
"If you're sure, John," Mycroft began, "I'll see that it is quickly approved." For a moment, he stared down the hall after his brother. "It might be easiest on all of us."
"Yes," Sherlock, eyes still closed, rasped from the bed, his voice a little rough from sleep, the procedure, and the sedation. "Drive me home now."
In the soft lighting from a lamp in the corner of their bedroom, the room was lit from the side, warm and glowing. There was nothing harsh, and certainly nothing but tender smiles between them as John faced Sherlock, who still lay on his side, watching.
"So?" Sherlock had actually been cooperative, another alarm bell had begun ringing at the back of John's head. "Irregular. What's that mean?"
"You tell me," Dawn says, and her demeanor is a little more casual although still attentive of course to the critical equipment and all that goes along with it. But then she asks a question that implies they have time for small talk, although John doesn't put that together immediately. Her eyes twinkle. "What's different now?" John first looks carefully at Sherlock. The physician in him is demanding that he begin with the ABCs. The airway, still the endotracheal tube, unchanged, and he is breathing through the ventilator. His circulation, his colour is still pretty good. A quick glance at the monitor - arterial line still in, cursory look at vital signs show to be within normal ranges. He moves quickly on. The number of IV pumps is down by two. The alteplase and one of the heparin drips are conspicuously - victoriously - absent. Dawn doesn't wait for him to speak it, but she sees that he has noticed and her grin gets even bigger as she nods. "Yes.
John is done asking, waiting, or trying to offer choices, so he doesn't leave any further decisions to Sherlock. A few minutes later he has managed to get Sherlock into the waiting pyjama bottoms, hair partially toweled dry, and sitting somewhat limply in the edge of the bed in his bedroom. Wordless, he holds out a soft tee shirt and even though Sherlock is
"Oh good, you're just in time, we were getting ready to call you." The nurse meets him at the door, and at John's somewhat alarmed expression, clarifies, "He's fine. They've assigned us a room. A very nice room, one of the extra big ones, a private VIP room. Not sure about the VIP status, but as soon as they assigned it, I called report before they change their minds." John glances inside the room, where Sherlock is sitting on the edge of the bed. A wheelchair is in front of him.
They were still chuckling when their legs got tangled in the scarf in efforts to make it to the bedroom in time.
Dawn, Sherlock's nurse, a respiratory therapist, and another staff member guide the bed again, the halls, the lift, the turns becoming more familiar to John. He and Greg follow at a distance. Once they are in the lift, Dawn gives him a bit of an update. "So blood pressure's up a little, we see that when the body tries to do its own perfusion, you know, increases pressures in order to get the blood through. He got some pain meds, and we upped his sedation." She waits until John nods. "They already told you the stent is in, the arm, nice signals in his wrist, so that's great."
"Okay, good," John said quietly, having scrubbed the outer aspect of Sherlock's lower leg. Thankfully, he'd found some local anaesthetic, and a few other supplies that he felt were mission critical - sterile drapes, gloves, even a few surgical masks. Light from several candles, though it of course wasn't like an OR procedure light, illuminated the area fairly well. "Ready?"
John chuckled, also feeling relieved that the decision was a joint one, and that it had been finally, calmly
"No, something else," Sherlock quipped, with some vague mystery about him as he reached for an item on the nightstand. He held up, after a moment, a small cylindrical container so John could read it.
She watches for a few minutes. "I can go back up on it, if I have to, but I think I'll try a small dose of pain medicine first, maybe. Here," she offers her place at Sherlock's side to John, "see if you have any luck while I go and grab the med."
"No. Tonight. I tried scrubbing, but ..." His index finger trails over spots over both clavicles, both ribs, the center of his chest. John sees that indeed, there are some reddened patches of irritated skin where monitoring electrodes had been, leaving behind a sticky, tenacious residue. The sensitive skin is mildly abraded where he tried to scrub. It can't feel good, probably catches and perhaps itches. Either way, not good, John is sure. And unlike some of the other stuff that John can't make magically go away, this one is easily fixable.
John reads the name of the recipient, someone that he hadn't even met before tonight, with red hair and freckles and looks young, so very young. On the screen at the front of the room flashes a photo of the officer, some details about the award, and John is caught a bit seeing Sherlock's name headlined again. A fresh wave of missing him, the emptiness never far from the surface, bubbles in his chest.
John chuckled just a little at the brothers, and while he was watching Sherlock he missed the face Mycroft apparently made at his brother. He saw an initial reaction, though, and he knew what had transpired. His chuckle died in his throat.
When John awoke in recovery, throat sore from intubation and shaking as he emerged from the grasp of anaesthesia, he recalled the question but did not ask again. Acute spasms of pain in his shoulder kept him fairly distracted, where every move, cough, or shift reminded him that every body part was connected to every other. Just like his unit.
Her smile was warm and wide. "Had a very nice discussion with the director there. We both feel that you're ready." They'd been discussing it for a while, had actually had an informal interview during one of John's previous sessions with Ella, and agreed that when some time had passed, when Ella and John both concurred that perhaps the time was right, they'd set up some formal training, a trial period. “What do you think?”
And oh, did Sherlock glare at that. Mycroft seized the moment. "Careful, Sherlock. I even have some fabulous suggestions at some puppy names that I'm sure your children would find quite favourable."
Chuckling softly, John brushed at his hand, then left it there atop Sherlock's, lightly, companionable.
Distantly, he craned his neck and his proverbial ears, listening for the tell-tale sirens, the arrival of help, the medical responsibility shifting so that John didn't shoulder it completely alone. Given the usual traffic, he knew it would even be long minutes between when he first heard them and when they arrived on Baker Street. Since there was nothing else to do, nothing else to occupy him, he perched on the edge of the couch. "They'll be here soon," he breathed again. "And then ..."
Sensations pierce the numbness, the thick fog of grief and overwhelming circumstance. Images swirl behind his eyes, every few steps something else, his stations of the cross come to oppress him. Mary, bleeding. Sherlock, devastated. Mycroft, icy. The sounds of his own agony loud and unrecognisable, foreign.
"Absolutely not," John mutters almost immediately. "You'll be threatening my person and demanding that I take you home. Or give me the slip." They fold a blanket over Sherlock's legs, ignoring his growling about looking like an invalid. They help him put his feet on the footrests, and there is a moment where all of them, all four of the people in the room, can feel a bit of a tingle in the air. "Not gonna lie, it's going to feel good to get away from here," John says quietly.
Her smile in return was grateful, that he understood and that he agreed with her. The moment was a settling, a debriefing, a shared reflection that they were okay and that this was one of the things every healthcare provider learned to navigate. "Did you need something?" She understood that he'd come to the room with more than a social visit in mind.
He looks at the time, sees that some time has elapsed since the first message was run through his system. Longer since it had happened. His mobile notification, though, had been almost immediate.
It was John, laying in his hospital bed, cardiac monitor a-glow and the pixelated white sheets crawling into focus. The head of the bed was elevated. Also visible was an IV pump, illuminating the siderail with faint light from the display, a pillow, the usual hospital paraphernalia - overbed table, tissues, basin, nurse call. John's hair looked dark and tousled in the indirect lighting.
John nods, feeling the isolation again as his contact, his 'back-stage' escort dons a surgical mask then proceeds into the procedure room. John takes a step back, silent, grateful to be this close rather than in the waiting room, worrying and wondering. He can see almost nothing of Sherlock except that there is most assuredly a patient on the procedure table and that people are clustered around him, working in there. He knows that Sherlock's head is at the end closest to the ventilator, and that there is equipment and a plethora of monitors and John hopes he is blissfully unaware. He hopes a lot of things on Sherlock's behalf.
Getting rid of that groin line, the medication that had been infusing directly into Sherlock's lungs, always a feeling of progress.
Sameer lay in bed missing the nighttime rituals, the word exchange, the languages they shared almost every night. He missed the routine, the familiarity, the way John's presence, his goodnight hug, gave him comfort and security. His chest, his head, it all felt cockeyed, his stomach somewhat queasy. Had he known how to describe the feeling he would have chosen lonely. Empty. The house without John, without his papa, felt absolutely terrible. He lay awake a very long time, listening, hoping that he would indeed hear familiar footsteps and the front door despite what he'd been told. Surely he wouldn't stay away, not if Sameer needed him.
"No. But if you're here, it's always a good send-off. Three o’clock. We line the halls, clap as they go out."
"Yes you do." He smiles. "Neither of them answered me, and John of course, I can understand. But not Sherlock. Not without a damned good reason." Her cheeks flush again. "So, actually, I think it's fairly obvious."
The nurse must have been deep in thought, standing at the bedside rendering post-mortem care. Post-mortem care is the preparing of the body to be taken to the morgue, and includes removing lines or other medical devices, bathing, and usually wrapping of the hands and ankles together, supporting the body's jaw to keep it aligned. The final washing was respectful and somewhat sentimental. The nurse had the patient's hand in her gloved ones, and there was a small, wistful, somewhat bittersweet look on her face and her eyes were full and wet, though no tears were coalescing. Not quite sad, definitely not a smile. Introspective and ... raw. Which John did get a glimpse of before the surprise on the nurse's face took over.
"-- or a place to crash for the night." Sherlock looked up, a little bit calculating, but oddly hopeful. "You have a spare bed for me?" John blinked, surprised at the bold - and unreasonable - request. "A place on the floor?"
John can't help the jibe, and chuckles, "Normal's boring." At that, John sees the faintest eye crinkles as Sherlock is at least mildly amused, a token response. He hears more staff gathering at the doorway, knows it's almost time to get out of the way. "I know. You will. You'll be fine."
The oxygen concentrator - good grief, did Sherlock hate that thing, loathed it to the very core. He hated the painfully slow wean to room air during the day, then eventually overnight. Although Sherlock wanted it removed immediately - meaning right this bloody minute, John - John insisted on keeping it another forty-eight hours just to make sure he was in the clear. With it went the portable tank and the pulse oximeter. But once it was out of the flat, the accomplishment of this milestone was quite a relief.
"Okay, this is your spot. The doc will come find you here. Check in with the receptionist if you leave."
Her tone, John thinks, it a little abrasive, and he realises that while the staff might know him, and who he is, ancillary departments do not. "Sorry, I should have introduced myself. I'm John Watson. His designated next of kin. You can check the computer if you want."
"Great idea. Oxygen, flammable, lots of linens. We'll make sure to get close to your hair too." He shifts in the chair. "Listen, I know now's not the time, but yeah, Sherlock. Just, don't okay? Make up your mind now. And I suppose travel in the future for you is going to be different too. Once you've ..." He stops, too much, back to the one-day-at-a-time mode. "You know, we can talk about this much later. Focus on the progress. Today's been good. Great, actually. Problem fixed."
He knew within a few minutes of depressing the plunger of the syringe into his antecubital vein that he had apparently made a terrible mistake, that the product was not as had been claimed, that there was a purity issue. A safety issue. He could tell, recognised the difference, and could feel the alarm within. Everything was too fast, brain, body, breathing, thoughts, and he regretted the choice. One substance cut with another, more addictive, more dangerous, cheaper to make. Knowing would have changed everything about how much he should have used, and it was possibly a lethal mistake.
The kitchen is empty as well, but Sherlock has left evidence behind. A plate with toast crumbs and a smear of orange marmalade is in the sink next to a half-drunk cup of tea. The kettle sits still slightly warm, and an empty mug, box of PG Tips, spoon, and sugar bowl wait next to it. John smiles when he catches a glimpse of a hastily scrawled note next to it:
"For god's sake, John. Yes. Yes to the death, of course. All the pat answers, the doctor speak, all the things that just basically say you don't care, that I don't matter."
"Oh," was all he could manage as he finished scooting away. It was awkward and it occurred to him that sharing the bed probably had not been one of their better ideas. But he did sleep, fairly well, and knew that had he been upstairs, that would not have been the case. Having Sherlock close at hand - and apparently in his arms - allowed him to rest, knowing that all was well. Less worry, less wondering about what was so far away.
a man to fish, and he eats for a lifetime.'" John waited as Sam was quiet, unmoving, thinking, probably still converting some of the words between English and Dari and back again. "Does that make sense to you?"
"No, you're not. Not at all," John assured her. In other times, he might have felt Sherlock's not-always-discreet kick under the table or a nudge or a frustrated sigh. But there was no reaction other than a slightly raised eyebrow as Sherlock looked up at the woman who'd approached. John continued. "My daughter, Rosie. Partner, Sherlock Holmes." John introduced them quickly, "Sherlock this is Carrie, one of the ICU nurses."
He nods, watches as she removes the wrist restraints completely and the respiratory therapist binds up the ventilator tubing, stows it into the corner of the room. Although John understands the need to keep it close in the initial time period after extubation, in case it is needed again, he finds the machine's presence a little ominous. There is another pass of the suction device in Sherlock's mouth, followed by a mint-flavoured toothbrush/swab, and then Dawn stands back. She waits, eyeing his chest, the monitor, the little puffs of mist that disappear when Sherlock inhales. She watches with enough intensity that John studies her and then Sherlock, trying to figure out what she is tuned into.
Sherlock sharply looked over, eyes narrowed in speculation, seeing John's secretive expression, his smile and the way his eyes twinkled back at him, and in that moment, he realised - and John confirmed - that a surprise had been a success.
"She seems improved," the doctor observes. "Another few hours, hydration, monitoring, and perhaps we'll see if she needs admission or can go home."
My facility is now "requesting" that each person eat lunch completely alone to minimise risk of virus transmission - sounds like AO3 browsing time to me. Although a meal break isn't happening too often anymore.
Her smile was bittersweet, genuine. "Thanks. It was ..." she let the sentence trail off unfinished, the furrow in her brow making words like
"Squad called in." One of the nurses had taken the call, and spoke to the A&E physician, Dr. Franco, as they finished up from the continuous cycle of treat and street with the occasional arrest, admit, or pronounce thrown in for good measure. "Thirty something male. Collapsed near Euston Square station."
He has been saddled with a John shaped hole that disembowels him. It has been utterly unacceptable that he did not remember, that they have not been together.
"So that's how it's going to be?" Although John might have fussed, secretly - not so secretly - he was chuffed at the way Sherlock could hold out, could tease, could immerse himself in a role that John adored. "You need me to take away your choices?" With strong fingers, John grasped at Sherlock's hips, his pelvis, sliding him back toward the foot of the bed even further, drawing out his arms further and broadening the angles of his knees. There was another tremor, a quiver of Sherlock's back muscles, his sides, that now were holding up a bit more weight. He watched, seeing the degree of quivering, the effort expended, and knew it wouldn't be much longer before he would move him again. Although he knew Sherlock wanted to be taken to the extremes of his reserve, of his ability, John would never overdo it. "Tell me what you want."
"I know. Tube coming out is ... I understand, gagging and sputum and all the rest. I'm okay with it," John assures her, his voice low. Behind them, the respiratory therapist is connecting new equipment, a cool aerosol mask, corrugated blue tubing, a disposable pad over Sherlock's chest. "Now that he's awake, I just ... I need ..." and that damnable hoarseness is back, and he can feel the crease over his eyebrows, completely unveiling his distress at the thought of being banished from the room now. "I'm fine."
"Needed to say thank you to ..." He looked still a little panic-stricken, desperately wanting very much to have the car turn around. "... to your ..."
"I do trust you to take care of yourself. Take care of us." He sat up straighter, a bit more himself, more comfortable than he'd been for this awkward and sobering conversation. "I also trust that you're about to make me a nice cup of tea."
and does the math. He can meet her, settle her with Rosie, and be back to the hospital shortly after that. He hopes.
"Surveillance. Mycroft. Unfortunately it was picked up too late, Sameer was already here in the building." He explained succinctly, calmly, about the photo, the attendant who'd been sent to their flat, and the plans to talk with Mrs. Hudson in the morning. "And Rosie was fine, still asleep when I checked on her." Sherlock took stock in where they were, at John's present status, at Sameer's position and level of discomfort. "But, both of you, please rest a bit - sleep if you can. I will keep watch and we'll sort this out during day hours." John gave the smallest nod and Sherlock could see that his eyes relaxed as he tried to follow directions. He tucked his own head down toward Sameer's. "Remember I said papa needed to rest? Well, he still does, so you and I will stay here a short time and make sure no one disturbs him. Like Uncle Mycroft." The attempt at humour fell a little short, but he knew that Sameer usually was somewhat amused and found Mycroft a curiosity. His words turned to small murmurings as he could feel Sameer wriggle himself into a more comfortable lie position, but he kept speaking for a few minutes after he felt Sameer's muscles slide into that relaxed phase that could only mean he'd fallen asleep. Minutes later, he could feel Sameer twitch lightly, the whole body response, as he slipped into a deeper phase of sleep.
"True. No one can argue that the vaccine to treat a virus we've only been aware of for barely more than twelve months -- I mean," and John forced himself to catch his breath. "Obviously, the usual twenty four months of study afterward is not possible. It would have been nice to wait for that - except that people are dying, and --"
"No, I got her," John responded, shifting a little as he readied himself to get up while holding her, her milk, and the blanket wrapped about her fuzzy purple pyjamas. "Say good night, you two," and he leaned close to Sherlock, who lowered his head to press at Rosie's head. His arms encircled them all, a cord of three, a brief hug, his hands rubbing lightly across John's back to slide up toward his hair.
It was spoken loudly enough to get his attention, and Sameer smiled initially, then whispered something in Dari abruptly. He looked dismayed for a moment, and John waited as he flipped around in the seat. "Wait, can we go back?"
"So you'll kind of get a feel for how serious or at risk the caller is. Voice tone, background noise, word choice. The crying ones are usually the least at risk for completed suicide, they want help and recognise the seriousness of their situation."
A few shifts went by, but John hadn't forgotten. He'd read the online police news looking for information, not that he had any details, and he mentioned it in his scheduled meeting with Ella. Her advice - you can't fix someone else - was sage although it didn't stop him from wondering. At the end of that appointment with Ella, she commented on how helping other people had seemed to make a big difference in John's own outlook. He didn't disagree.
With a minimum of steps, John secured another small container from the small crate of toys, dumped half of them into it, separating them so that each kid had their own.
Jack nods, and sees Sherlock's attentiveness. "Conservative therapy, best evidence, is starting direct oral anticoags while the heparin infusion continues. Best outcomes indicate five days."
anyway ... gracious. Two kids is a lot. A year ago, it was just you in the flat. And look at us now. Every day, more chaos. And well, I just wanted to do something nice. A surprise."
Adjusting his headset and sitting a little taller, he finished his sentence while holding up a hand that would request the visitor to wait. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched the man - tall, thinning hair, long expensive looking coat and even more expensive looking leather shoes - eye the few chairs in the room with distaste while he waited.
"We're fine." Stepping close, John pulls at Sherlock's collar, drawing him near enough to press a quick kiss against his jaw. "What are you worried about?"
John's fingers continue their mission, their ministry, on Sherlock's scalp. "How's your headache?" he finally whispers.
Sherlock glances over, and there is a hunger in his eyes as he takes in what John brought. "She forgot the cups."
Rosie broke the silence and reached down with her fingers to rumple at the sensitive spot behind his ears. “Whatcha think, Bosco?”
"Good thought," John retorts. "And maybe we should do it before we start all of those blood thinners, I mean, what's the fun of bleeding out when it's easy?" He knows when it is safe to push Sherlock's buttons, decides that he might as well jump in with both feet. "Although the heparin is running still."
Harry Watson glanced at the refrigerator, where miscellaneous menus were stuck on with magnets, her calendar (a month behind as she didn't pay it any mind), a grocery list, a photo of her brother in uniform, and a sheet of postage stamps. With a tremulous finger, she straightened John's picture, thinking to herself that one day she'd give him a call. He wasn't too far away any longer, he'd said, and that he'd suffered a minor injury but was being discharged, had been back in London area for a few weeks now. It rankled her - saddened her, actually, as she looked at the picture again - knowing how much John had loved his calling, the military options, the passion he'd told her about. She'd been so proud of him, and still was, but put off calling.
"I'm just pointing out my observations, that it's ridiculous. And an insult to all of us who actually own and play a stringed instrument."
She did not need to be asked twice and actually had enjoyed their encounters, the developing friendship over the years. She'd seen how they treated, needed, and respected both her father and the detective. "Maybe to that vending machine?"
"And why is he here again?" Sherlock glanced over at where Mycroft stood, watching, also thoroughly amused. John couldn't tell if he was more entertained at the antics of the puppies with the children, or at the annoyance of his brother.
"John, please." He sighs, and then shakes his head at himself, grinning at Rosie, who snorts back at him. "Not a very good game I'm teaching her is it?"
"No, it's good. I mean, I know they're young, but this is quite nice, not having them here. It seemed smart, and now that we're here I'm sure of it. Molly's managed to deal with you all these years, I'm sure this will be a walk in the park." Shared smiles were exchanged. "We won't always have them, they'll grow up, leave, move out. Maybe move away. And we have things to look forward to. Eventually, oh I don't know, retiring or finding other things to do. Definitely our lives don't now, nor will they in the future, always involve them."
With some degree of success, John stifled the smile at Sherlock's reaction to that - jaws clenched and eyes blazing. Had he only a few hours ago recalled how much he appreciated Sherlock's zest and liveliness? Allison met John's amused glance, wisely not adding anything additional but sharing his perspective.
Rob briefly joins John at the bed after grabbing the doppler and some gel from the counter. The probe, lots of gel, John holding Sherlock's arm and hand carefully so as not to impede any signal or circulation, and the machine stubbornly gives them only monotoned static and white noise at the highest volume. There is no arterial flow, nothing pulsatile. Not radial, not ulnar. Not even low pitched venous turbulence. None.
The room is oddly empty, quiet, without Sherlock in it. The ventilator in the room is put on standby, and it has some sort of countdown as it waits for the patient's return.
"If you're sure," she says one final time before standing up, preparing to leave. Upstairs, Rosie is absolutely silent in the monitor.
"Friends." His word is a little charged, a little challenging. "So the photos, are they ... disturbing?"
True disclosure:  had some brief, momentary panic after applying hand lotion in the break room and not smelling the typical hand lotion scent.  (The vast majority of patients who go on to develop coronavirus have altered sense of smell and taste.). Recommendation going forward: please label
"A week. Maybe a little ..." and he inhaled, exhaled uncomfortably, looking away from John's irritation, "... longer. Maybe."
"You want the actual numbers?" John asks. Because they have certainly been circulating in his mind since this all went down, that at some point, he might have had to say goodbye. Sherlock ponders this, nods after a moment of consideration. "Greater than 50% mortality, massive saddle PE when there's cardiovascular collapse."
"It's really important that you don't blame yourself." John spoke gently, his voice a very hushed volume. "Your mama getting sick had nothing to do with anything you did or didn't do." Sam nodded again, but the struggle was evident even as he let John hold him. "If this bothers you again, please talk to me about it?"
John could feel his heels digging in and his confidence raised along with his chin. "I don't believe I caught your name."
And I suppose, though the song will forever have negative connotations for me (for all of us), in closing, the discharge song:
"I'm fairly certain I would have." A little later after a comfortable span of silence, he nodded at the kitchen. "Dinner?"
Sherlock began with a gentle, overall application of lotion, from his fingers, over his palm, up to his wrists. And then he began working individual areas, soothing and smoothing, fingers rubbing over calluses and lifelines and wrinkles, over sore knuckles and fingernails. He spent a long few moments working the pad of John's thumb, the webbing between his fingers, soothing and pressing, rubbing, moisturising, and hydrating. The lotion was faintly scented with lavender and marjoram, the texture fine and supple, just the right amount of glide, viscous and smooth. When he'd finished with one hand, he adjusted their positions in bed, with him doing most of the adjusting, to attend to John's other hand, giving it the identical, methodical, careful treatment.
Oh god yes, John's mind responds, almost instantly and desperately. His mouth, thankfully, a little slower to engage. "That'd be fantastic, yes."
Sherlock pressed a quick kiss against John's shoulder. "That's what you're needed for, to offset my abysmal social skills, make sure to keep us all right."
She pursed her lips, feeling the need to turn up the drama, raised an arrogant brow, blew out a puff of contrived frustration. She mustered her ten-year old sass. "Obviously."
I wish I could just fast forward today and skip the whole bloody interval of time by myself and just be home. Baker Street is sounding a little more all right.
"No. You woke up enough to say goodnight to Rosie, take your meds," John points this out specifically, because shockingly, Sherlock hadn't fussed about it. He hadn't complained, refused, spit them out, or tried to play let's make a deal with that, and whatever positive reinforcement John could offer and affirm, he would take, "but that's been about it." Sherlock's eyes close again. "Time to move." He doesn't say, keep blood flowing, prevent further clot, stimulate your vasculature, protect your recovery. But god, he wants to.
"So, here I am, then?" he says to Sherlock, hearing the strength in his voice rather than the raspy words. The fog clears completely, and they share a smile, a memory.
"Please back up. Move away from the edge of the roof." John sat forward on his chair, leaning in, watching the computer screen for any more texts, and held onto the microphone of his headset as if that would help the man listen. "You know, I don't even know your name."
The aggrieved shudder that wracks John's back is immediately noticed, and the grip, the hug, tightens. There are a few more until John wrestles his emotions in check.
To his credit, Sherlock does not roll his eyes at John's half-hearted protest. "I'll see if I can borrow Mrs. H's portable cot."
"Check what?" he whispers, and he listens to the explanation but only looks confused, then eventually, reluctantly moves his hand so she can confirm that everything is okay. When Dawn steps away again, he squeezes John's hand. "What day is it?"
And no children above them. No sounds of feet on the steps, or the telly, or the loo, or when all was very quiet -
"It used to." Sherlock's eyes met and held John's when he looked over, but it wasn't a glare or a particularly emotional statement. Unrushed, he looked over at Sameer, to clarify. "So if it bothers you, that's okay. But there'll be a time when you just overlook it. No matter what, some people are still going to be idiots."
John curled up, actually very tired and thankful that at least he didn't have to share his side of the bed. He was almost asleep when he could hear Sherlock's hand rubbing on the dog's head, the softness of the caress on her puppy-soft fur soothing. And very very sweet. He kept completely still when he heard Sherlock chuckling lightly, thinking it was only to himself. John fell asleep to the quiet sounds of the dog's fur being sweetly and tenderly stroked.
"Maybe this is also what I wanted for my birthday - entertainment." All eyes focused on her. "You know," she continued, "maybe a knock-down, drag-out, bloody-nosed fight." With a spirited finger, she pointed between Sherlock and Mycroft. "You know, Holmes vs. Holmes, fight until the death, winner take all." She had their attention, so she kept going. "Like the duel, in that musical Hamilton?"
That evening, he finalised and submitted his online application. The organisation assured him that he would hear back in a few weeks.
John takes a few hours to go home, leaving Sherlock - he hopes - to get a bit of rest while he is gone. He returns with Lydia and Rosie to find that Sherlock is actually in the hallway. A respiratory therapist is with him, an oxygen tank in a wheeled holder next to them, and she is also holding a pulse oximeter while Sherlock pushes his own IV pump slowly down the hallway. They are only a few feet from his room.
The pharmacy tech nodded and as she scanned the list, she took a slight lean backwards, then looked up with a little concern in her eyes over both of their masked lower faces. "This stuff for you?"
"He wanted. I promised him. Saw it through, too." The worry lines of John's brow a poignant reminder that it could possibly have been too tough at home.
Sherlock's eyes are mostly flat but he nods his head once. And then he takes her to task for something she's just said. "If you plan to fuss at me all day, I swear to you that
"Kissing your uncle would be especially gross," Sherlock said. "No one, even you - especially you, Rosie - really should never, ever ..."
John pulled a novel from the shelf, something in his arsenal of mindless, escape reading, set in something so futuristic there was little resemblance to current society. The words didn't hold his interest for long, and the book ended up forgotten in his hands, open to a particular page, askance. It was a prop, a useless and ineffective distraction.
"Holmes?" John does not issue a challenge at all, simply wants to confirm that he's closer than he's been.
"It won't last forever." John could feel the way Sherlock's embrace changed, that it was as comforting as he knew to be, that he was making such efforts to help John, to refocus, to encourage. It was the same phrase he'd spoken to a few of the ICU staff just the day before.
With a lump in his throat, John acknowledged his own low level anxiety he'd had since that afternoon when Sherlock had such distress on the couch, the worry that he chose not to think about, and he turned so that he was staring up at the black ceiling. "I know we aren't ... that we don't ... that we've never ..." He could feel his own frustration at the words he was frightened to speak out loud. "I can't imagine not having ..." For a few minutes, John lay there feeling his own heart pounding, wanting the courage to finally say something, to put words past the light-hearted banter and flirting and ... attraction they'd only intimated at previously.
"But it gave her you," John reminded him with a heartfelt touch on the arm. "And you were so worth it, I just know it. And honour is so much more than that. It's respect and dignity too." The moment strung out, a final note of fulfillment on a full and robust chord at a concert, and when it had faded to nothing, John chased another link. "And Sam, well, it is often short for Samuel, in English, means 'heard by God,' or 'God has heard.' Which is I think very true, that you've been very watched over to this point."
They'd told him low ejection fraction, of dilated obstructive cardiomyopathy, that there was only medical management. They obviously are wrong - he feels whole again, pain free. He is sharply aware. The heaviness is completely gone and he is fully present in the moment. And then, he realises. Those memories fade as Sherlock's hands cup his face, his jaw, the eyes bright as they meet, hold, cling. John can only find one thing to say, his confusion dissipating, and he knows exactly what has happened.
They'd agreed to let Rosie settle in before talking with her about not only Sherlock's medical experience but also the change in the dynamics of their relationship. And so, a few hours later, John pried himself from the couch and silently ascended the stairs to crawl into his own, cool, not recently used bed of his own. He didn't sleep too well.
Protecting the vulnerable - definitely something John would find very important. It is still largely unknown how virulent an asymptomatic (or more technically, a
Mycroft huffed again, sighed, crossed one ankle over the other as he sat in the hard chair amidst machinery that clicked, whirred, beeped, and made other annoying sounds of functioning. It aggravated him that whatever engineers had designed said medical equipment didn't do a better job insulating them. Realising the blame-shifting, he eyed the unconscious form of his brother in the bed. Again. Restrained, intubated, laying there. They hadn't even needed to start any sedation, not yet, the nurse had said, such was the level of self-poisoning this time. He was too affected by whatever choice of substances to fight the treatments, the uncomfortable therapies. A tube draining bilious green resided in one side of his nose, a clear, thick breathing tube out the corner of his mouth - his drooling mouth, Mycroft thought with distaste, a urine-filled tube led to a bedside drainage bag that he didn't care to consider any further than that. He'd been so profoundly hypotensive that there was a central line out the side of his neck.
John had lingered in that sweet spot of barely comfortably awake and still very relaxed when he heard quiet steps. He opened one eye at the intrusion.
Before there is more friction between them - in a very good way, John thinks - the hand off continues. Rob signals the IV pumps, confirming the heparin infusion that is infusing, the amount remaining, and they verify palpable pulses in all four extremities, that the dressing is dry over Sherlock's femoral access site, and ask if he needs anything.
Okay, in addition to the title, apparently I'm rampantly plagiarising other classics as well. I'm not even going to apologise. Actually, yes I am: Many apologies. But it is true what is said about imitation and flattery.
"Are you upset?" John asked the question softly, and Sameer shook his head again, just a little. "You can say anything you want to me, you know. Or I can go get the computer, if we need." They hadn't used the translator application in a long time, but John didn't want to miss the opportunity if it was needed. Not about something this important.
Another flash of lightning and simultaneous snappy thunderclap, and there was a sizzle, a hiss, and the acrid smell of surging electricity throughout the house. They were plunged into darkness again save for the candles.
Over bright, tear-filled eyes, the patient nodded. "Thank you all so much!" His voice trembled with emotion, with the meaningful lyrics, and at the knowledge that he had pressed on hard, done difficult things, soldiered through the discomfort, and beaten this damned virus.
The groan that comes on the first brush of John's splayed fingers is loud and surprising. John doesn't startle, however, and utters some encouragement at his response, "That's it, then. You're doing great, just ... breathe," and he continues, with glacial slowness, the path of his fingers in Sherlock's hair, over his ears, to the crown of his head, working in unrushed paths toward his temples. The sound of fingers in hair, small noise of overlapping hair fibres, of linen as John adjusts his arms, masks the realisation that Sherlock is also moving - and when he arches his back, scissoring his legs so that his body is almost in direct contact with John's front. John does startle at that, at the unexpectedness of it, and his fingers tighten - over and into Sherlock's hair. The handfuls of hair are gripped and then almost immediately released.
Sherlock spoke the sentence entirely - and intentionally - too fast for anyone save John to understand it.
He is pensive for another few moments. "I've certainly had my share of close calls. But this ..." He shakes his head. "Before, it was more my choice." At John's snort, thinking of the biggest, lousiest choice that they have certainly resolved now, the bloody roof at Barts, Sherlock inclines his head. "Yes, I know. I didn't say they were specifically easy choices for everyone. But it's always been something I've had a little control over. The brushes with criminals, the run-ins with clients and the like. Voluntarily putting myself in danger. But not this. This is different." His thumb is making small motions over the back of John's hand. "I've no control over this."
"Count on it." Greg sits quietly while Molly offers a few sentences about Rosie's day, that they're doing well, then gets up to tend to the rest of the evening activities. Greg turns back to the screen. With a smile and a nod, he points a finger at them, waggling it slightly. "I think it's great, you know. And it's about bloody time, you two."
"Call back if the ambulance hasn't arrived in ten minutes. My computer shows that they are between four and five minutes away."
Although John's eyes are on the physician, waiting, he feels Sherlock's fingers seek and creep into his own as they rest on the siderail of the bed. Their fingers, with a small amount of desperation,
Chuckling just a little, John knew what he meant, and shifted their hand clasp so that he rested his fingertips over Sherlock's pulse point. Slow, steady, and regular.
John hesitates with his words as he angles his body into the crook of Sherlock's arm. "I should ... We should ... Would you consider perhaps some sort of legal ... guardianship?"
The rest of the evening was uneventful, non-descript, and included bathtime, pyjamas, brushing teeth, and snuggles on the couch all three of them while John read one of her favourite books. There was no fallout, no dynamics, no specific issue the remainder of the bedtime routine, and John hesitated at the steps with Rosie tucked up against him, before they went upstairs.
"You're not getting your way here." Although the words were perhaps harsh, John made sure to keep his delivery as gentle as he could. "Not this time."
He seems stony as John untangles his hand from Sherlock's and wordlessly follows the doctor into the hallway. Kathy walks a fair distance away, to keep their conversation from being right at Sherlock's doorway, before addressing John. "It's understandable, his aggravation. And I figured you'd have a few questions."
Although his eyes were still closed, his pupils were active, his cheeks slightly flushed, the rest of him paler than previously.
By itself, smoking is harmful enough on the lungs, brain, and the propensity of blood to form clots. Together with other risk factors - such as travel or being sedentary - the combination can be deadly.
And one last thing, know that right now resources are stretched about as thin as we can get without being ethically on thin ice. Do you want to have to choose between who gets the oxygen equipment, the ventilator, the hospital bed, the medication, the nursing care? Because I might have to. And to continue as we are is downright asking for it. Some hospitals are so full that there isn't room in the A&E. Why? Because coronavirus patients are clogging up rooms of all care levels. Because when there isn't an inpatient bed, the A&E has to hold them. Because people keep walking in to have babies, or need an appendectomy, or have chest pain. Patients around the globe who have had to wait have died of things like heart attacks in parking lots because hospitals are too full. Waiting is not only miserable for the patient, it is bad medicine that no one wants to choose. Remember when you had that excruciating kidney stone a few years back? Imagine if that was you stuck outside the hospital waiting for pain medicine, that procedure, a bed. If that was mum with complications from her diabetes or a stroke. Waiting for a bed can have serious complications including permanent disability and death.
seasoned enough to burn crisply. A snap of some of the residual green expressed its discontent and resistance to the heat but finally succumbed to heat and flame. A thin stream of smoke puffed out from the cut end of the logs, evaporation and heat and accelerated drying. Footsteps in the leaves galloped closer along with the sound of breathing, rapid and too quick for human approach, and before John could even react defensively, something green and slimy hit the open book he'd been reading, rolling down the spine into his lap. A path of viscous wet trailed down the page.
Sherlock rounded the corner from the kitchen, shaking his head. He looked fairly tired, himself, as he watched John's efforts, listened to him interact with his daughter. "Hey you," he crooned into Rosie's cheek, "it's okay. You're all right. Bit of a bump, but you're in one piece. No harm done."
"It's no trouble. Was thinking perhaps, once Mr. Holmes is better and in a different room out of the ICU, a visit now and again might work. Be something of a distraction. In between naps and such."
"Dispatch, you can always get permission or tell the caller what you're doing, call on another line, at least get routed to the nearest cell tower from where the call is coming from. We're also using an app that can actually put you through to emergency services via text too. It can be an instant messaging with people on the scene. But your role is mostly keep them talking. Contract for safety." The director waited for John to nod that he understood. "Mobilise protective factors if you can." Glancing down, he flipped through a few papers. "Here's a list of possible questions, screening things. Some sample calls. Topic specific, and of course there are always others. But each call is different."
He'd used the term au pair to John, but in truth, it would be so much more. Clearances galore, high rank, pervasive professionalism, suitable for so much more than the care and keeping of a toddler. But she would be well compensated, and as a governmental employee, was willing, open to his terms, said that she actually enjoyed small children, and immediately available.
"I'd left them folded, right here on the chair by the ... " His words trailed off as he did in fact switch on the light and could see the item in question, that he'd been pursuing. He'd tucked them into the closet. "They're hanging up."
John is saved from having to respond to the illogic of that when Lydia knocks lightly on the door as she enters, Rosie in the pushchair. John smiles and approaches his daughter, his arms open and reaching toward her. She reaches back for him, a big toothy grin.
"Yes, I guess it's about time," she says, reaching for her own mobile. "We usually facetime in the evenings."
From the iPhone held aloft came the stadium version of the song played prior to every football match, and for a brief moment, John almost felt like he wanted to sing along.
"True." The fingers dabble at the center again, the puckered skin, carefully brushing at it with the intent to memorise, to know. "Mmm," he sighs again, a soft whisper. "I like that."
It is somber, tasteful. There are no garish decorations, no fanfare. Everything is just ... tasteful. The lighting is soft and the tables are casual, no seating assignments, no name tags. There is some easy listening background music, some cut flowers, balloons, a lot of people milling about. There is chatter and laughter interspersed, a gathering of professionals, friends, outside of the typical stressful work environment.
"I'm curious," Sherlock set a hand down on the table over the backpack, shaking it a little to draw attention to the paperwork that was now tucked inside, "how you were planning on getting away with being late coming home from school. This was, as I recall, scheduled for tomorrow, right? This detention."
The next word was quite close to a whinge. "Jo-ohn!" Sherlock looked incredulous that John seemed to be, in effect betraying him thus. "I cannot and will not --"
"And how's that blood pressure doing? Seems to me, probably a little elevated, given your high stress job, family history, age, smoking, and diet." John snickered slightly as Mycroft leaned forward and put his hands on the desk in front of him in order to convey his dissatisfaction with John's words, his message, his very presence, his unhappiness. "You should probably watch that, getting upset, I mean, look at you, even your face is red, probably stress response, blood pressure elevates with all of that." Briefly, John considered that his hands were perfectly steady as he recalled Mycroft's observation of him so long ago, in that car park, before John even knew his identity, his connection to Sherlock. "Modifiable risk factors, to some degree. Non-modifiable ones includes family history. Cholesterol, to some degree. Have you had that checked lately?"
John swallowed hard, willing the nausea and awkwardness to leave as if he could control either. "I'll just step out then, let you vis--" John's jacket was quickly in his hand and he took a few steps toward the door.
Greg's eyes are fond as he sheepishly does as John asks, then takes the mic for an impromptu acknowledgement. "Ah, the hat, Sherlock's deerstalker. Wow, thanks mate. An honour to be sure. But in truth, I think I speak for all of us, that Sherlock Holmes taught us all to see things, to think critically, to be better people --"
With great aplomb, Mrs. Hudson set the tin down, then raised her head with royal disdain - and a healthy teasing sparkle in her eyes and words. "Well, certainly not for you, directly, you insufferable tenant."
John put a hand on Mycroft's elbow, corralling him toward the door. "I'll do what I can," John assured him. "If possible, we'll try to stop in briefly."
Pulmonary embolism - blood clot in the lungs.  It often forms in the legs and breaks free, travels through central circulation through both right atria and right ventricle to lodge in the much smaller arteries in the lungs (as the vessels narrow into smaller arteries before gas exchange occurs). A PE, then, actually blocks the flow of blood before it can get oxygenated. Massive saddle PE and large clot burden are all bad descriptions of a very serious condition. As has been described here, often a PE is treated with thrombolytics such as alteplase. If medication isn't enough, the patient is unstable, or there is evidence of RV strain (which is the chamber of the heart trying to force blood forward and past the clot/PE), suction thrombectomy is one of the procedures that can be used to help alleviate the problem.
not even six months into this pandemic, all the little things that others have been doing for frontline workers, from things at home, to cautious conversation, to open-ended questions, to support group availability. In the beginning particularly, there were meals, small gifts, expressions of appreciation, and other tangible things that all conveyed "we appreciate you" and "thank you."
Of late, John had tried incredibly hard to let the smaller things go, choose his battles with care, and overall save his emotional energy for more important issues. But this particular confrontation, he found worthy of at least a little escalation, of an impassioned response. Through slightly clenched teeth, his tone brusque, he spoke. "This is not a waste. This matters."
"I wish your brother the fullest recovery possible." The man's tone was less aggrieved, less put upon, but he could hear the readiness to be done with the conversation, and Mycroft can feel the slight twitch in the side of his own mouth. Needs must.
"You're only seeing a fraction of the patients infected, less than fifteen percent end up even hospitalised, and only what, like three percent of those end up intubated ..." They'd talked about the statistics, the cases in the country, in London specifically. They tracked, daily, the number of critical care beds, the number of patients on ventilators. Of critical care bed utilisation and ventilator capacity. It was a sore point with John, that the NHS'd ordered more vents, had them shipped in from places: ventilators are a tool, he would say in frustration, but they need to be in the hands of skilled providers. They are not, he had growled, plug and play. Get ventilators, he'd said to Mike Stamford the other day, but bring the nurses along with - one without the other is useless.
"I'm fairly certain a trained monkey could call the provided number on the day your inane paperwork specifies."
"I suppose it has something to do with the fact that you have an erection and the lube is in your inside jacket pocket?"
He gets about twenty seconds into trying to rub the shampoo into a lather before lowering his shoulders in exhausted defeat. John doesn't make him ask, and speaks before Sherlock can confess that he is unable. "I'll get it."
"Understatement of the year, there." John settles, and they both take a few moments, each silent and comfortable. Their eyes meet again, hold, the sincerest form of
And there in the dimly lit room, so far from home, in the safe embrace where he had been coaxed, Sherlock
In response, Sherlock hung his head, shaking it minutely side to side, struggling, resisting, fighting against himself.
When she returns to the room, it is with a covered cup of water and a small container of apple juice. Handing them to John, she raises her brows as if to ask if this is okay to delegate to him. He nods, smiles, and unwraps the plastic straw. He brings it to Sherlock's lips, the bent straw. He huffs, swipes it out of John's hand, and takes a drink on his own.
He looks over at Sherlock, who is watching him. The glow from the laptop screen catches on his eyes, which are darkly glittering back at him. John smiles. "Maybe I'm trying to help you get kicked out of here."
John keeps his fingers loosely on Sherlock's hand, which for the moment is resting at his side, so John takes a moment to glance up. The monitor is also mostly unchanged, although his heart rate is up ten or more beats per minute than it had been earlier. "Fever?" John asks Rob. "Little tachy."
"You all know we called in the cavalry when this began. We dug out some inactive members, recruited some. We teleconferenced like never before. We picked up time and shifts. We brushed off our skills. We reassigned, repurposed, and ...” he chuckles again, gesturing at his chest, “ ... recycled.
It was also more than that. More than them separately, more than friendship, fulfilled and yet not entirely. Underneath the satisfaction was another kind of awareness, a yearning, a longing.
John bit down, clenching his teeth, wishing for the millionth time that - just every now and again - Sherlock would at least attempt to act like an adult and not nitpick in front of the actual children. Since they'd had a bit of a problem with Sam and some minor food issues in the past, John hardly ever said anything about any of them eating, or not eating, and Sherlock knew it. In private, even, John rarely said anything to him either. Perhaps it was just a long day and John's usual filters were off-line, and he'd had enough, so he opted to speak up. He spoke coolly, his delivery calm and low. "You know what? You can be done too." Before thinking better of it, he let his control slip even further. "Why don't you go clean up your toys, go get a bath, and I'll tuck you in when I'm done cleaning up the kitchen and taking care of everything else."
The living room on Baker Street was calm. Sherlock was anything but. He sat down, or tried to, only to bounce back up again, flick at the curtains, rearrange the mail from one table to another. John simply watched for a moment, but even that proved too much.
Sherlock, his bright blue eyes positively twinkling as he approached the subject, put his hands out in a calming gesture, as if not to get excited. "You might be looking for, 'how dare he say that?' Something like that?"
Classes took a long weekend break and amidst the first few, large raindrops, he parked the car close as he dared to the front door, hoping to beat the impending heavy rain as he scurried inside. Ominous, heavy clouds and a metallic acrid scent in the air foretold of a thunderstorm coming, and John just barely beat the first popping raindrops as he closed the door behind him, noting again the faint hint of cigarette smoke outside the house. The view out the window was surreal as the dark storm mixed with the dark of sunset. The black line of clouds, the perfect set up of temperature drop, convergent winds, and barometric pressures brought heavy, pounding rain along with thunder, lightning, and fierce winds.
He assures John again as John tries to imagine Sherlock uncomfortable and not easily managed with routine opioid-naive pharmacology. "It came up on his history. None of what's going on could be even remotely comfortable, so he needed it."
"You're not making this easy," Ella said with a mildly playful grin. "What did other people do in their free time, maybe even something that you could at least
Molly's arms were soon full of a vibrant and smiling Rosie, and the momentum of the room seemed to swell in a different direction. Crisis averted. "Of course!"
John'd managed to squeak through the clinical hour with Ella and was relieved at the thought of leaving for the week when she'd asked to see him again for a follow-up in two or three days. So much for his acting skills or lack thereof. He'd paused, hesitated and let his frowned brows as the question - why? - and she'd simply given him a kind, compassionate look, a hair-breadths shy of pitying smile. Her voice was more serious than he'd heard it before, her eyes searching his. "I just get the feeling that it would be wise, don't you agree?"
Sherlock cast a long look at the man and his family, returning to the gentleman who stood there still smiling. He said, "Welcome to London. Where are you from?"
I see you, over there, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, cringing a little and worried about what I could say. And with good reason. It's a dangerous thing, my holding a microphone and knowing so much dirt on you. So much, all those stories, habits, secrets. You all laugh, and rightly so. Catch me after my little speech, my toast. Dirty laundry stories will be for sale, so get ready to pay up if you want them.
"No, he was fine, John. Absolutely fine." Their eyes met, held, and locked. It occurred to Martha that this was the second pair of these bright eyes she’d connected with that evening. "It was absolutely my pleasure."
"I could still ... refuse," Sherlock muttered once his brother was off the other end of the mobile call.
"Hand me the form. I'll sign." He holds out a steady hand, but for a moment no one moves. "I do hope if something happens to me while under your care, for example, you have a wire and a device in my heart, you'll find it possible to act a bit more expediently?"
"So he could say goodbye, in case they never saw each other again." Under cover of their night-darkened room, they looked at each other, and John's exhale was shaky and a little ... escalating. The emotion was high and real. Upsetting. His hand reached for Sherlock's face, touching his jaw, cheekbone, and sliding lightly through his hair. "I cannot fathom that, the isolation, the knowledge that you're sick as shit, that you could die, that you are quite literally speaking what might be your last words to someone you love." His words were quiet but calmer. "And you're all by yourself. At that point, the staff is there but it's not who you really want."
"Your son is here." At that, John couldn't make sense of that concept because it was impossible. His brows furrowed and from his throat came a questioning sound, and even that hurt, and the nurse repeated it. "Your son is here."
"So anyway, yesterday, one of the docs takes over the meeting at the very beginning. He starts off telling them they're doing a great job, that he is so grateful for their teamwork, their dedication. And then he makes them all stand up, six feet apart. It's mid-afternoon, and he has them dim the lights a little, and he starts off by having them do guided breathing for like a minute. Talking all through the inhale, giving directions in this calm voice, he's just ... counting, then to exhale. She said he left no room to argue, made everyone participate. And then, get this? He leads them through some stretching, reaching, some simple yoga positions. Apparently, he was really amazing, talking through it the whole time, relaxed. They did, I don't know, sounded like shoulders and neck, arms, legs, back and hip stretching. All interspersed with a few breathing manoeuvres."
"It also explains why we haven't made much progress with the oxygen today. If you're uncomfortable, you don't breathe as deeply." They'd tried a few times leaving the pulse oximeter on and the oxygen off, but his levels were not high enough so the oxygen was replaced. Some of the time, Sherlock didn't even want to check, not wanting to be disappointed again. "There are things we can --"
I'm only partly kidding. The true fundraiser will be how much both of my dads are going to chip in to buy and keep my silence.
His first thought is that somehow Sherlock has managed to play a joke on all of them, that this is a terrible experiment gone awry. He wonders if he had sneaked a manikin arm into the bed and was hiding his own arm under the side of his body. And his second thought right on the heels of the first is that although Sherlock is clever, this is not a joke. He is too sick and he is ... well, not as dark or macabre as that would be. His fingers, hand, arm, feel quite different in temperature and turgor. John knows his own breath hitches as his hand splays out over Sherlock's wrist. Something ... is ... very ...
There is more noise at the door, followed by another familiar voice. "I'll be here so you can go entertain your daughter for a few minutes. There's a small cafe a short distance, actually just down the hallway." Mycroft stands tall in the doorway. He is in full take-charge mode, and while John innately wants to argue with him
Activity restrictions:  Rest. No strenuous exercise that would result in heavy breathing for 6-8 weeks, no lifting greater than 5 kg for 5 days, no driving until cleared by your physician, no hot tub x 7 days, may return to work in 2 weeks provided you have been cleared by your treating physician to do so.
"He's a bloody physician," Sherlock mutters. "Pretty sure he could handle your job without breaking a sweat."
Self-assured, she nodded, and her steady, unwavering, non-frightened eye contact with him was what ended up making up his mind. "Thank you. Your forms indicate you are available immediately." He slid over a piece of paper. "Report to this address this afternoon, between two-thirty and three. My PA will meet you there." Rising to his feet, he smiled as much as he could muster given that his mind was somewhat occupied with the latest update from the hospital and how weary and haggard John had looked.
"Ta for the sensitivity," John grumbled back, then to Sam he laid his hand over his forehead. "Seems we need to get your stomach checked out. Sometimes, there's an organ inside there, over here," he said, indicating his right side of his belly, "called an appendix, which can get inflamed, swollen, infected, and make you feel, well ..." John gestured at where he was lying on the couch, "terrible."
Rosin. The trigger of scent associations, one with the music, a straight line between all of these things. It is fond, and comforting, and almost immediate when he picks up his instrument.
The recliner in the waiting room creaks a little as John shifts, hearing something, someone, across the room. "You can go home, you know. Get some sleep." It is one of the staff he met earlier, the charge nurse, probably sent by Rob to come out and check on him, give him an update. He'd agreed to a short trial out of the room in the hopes that Sherlock might sleep - or at least, sleep easier - without knowing he was in the room.
Sam nodded. "I have a question." John made a wide sweeping gesture, sitting back in the chair and grateful for a few uninterrupted minutes. He could vaguely make out the sounds of splashing water, Sherlock speaking, and presumably quieter moments when actual scrubbing was hopefully taking place in the bath. "You were talking with someone on the phone, papa, about how one of your patients at the surgery got sick. He was a student, at uni."
