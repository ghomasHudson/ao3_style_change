“I thought we were going on another - what’d you call it? Nocturnal harvest? Full disclosure, dude, but that sounds weirdly porny. Like, monster porny. I don’t wanna call it that. Night gardening. How’s that instead?”
Dean taps his bottle against Cas’, thinking of every angel that’s fucked with his people just for the sake of following orders. “Can’t argue with that.”
Dean tips Cas’ head back with a careful hand on his jaw and then presses kisses against his throat, Cas can't think, can't form a single thought. The only sound he hears is the demanding hum in his mind urging him toward... he has no idea what. His hands have found their way just beneath the bottom hem of Dean’s t-shirt without his awareness, stuttering with the shock of skin against his fingertips. Is it okay - is it too far - does Dean really -
Dean sighs and sets down his beef bourguignon-laden fork, a tragedy if there ever was one. After tonight, it’s all diner food for the next who knows how many days. He and Cas are headed to California for a hunt.
“I think I’ve known you longer than I’ve been alive,” Dean answers, a little breathless. “So I guess I can be as honest as I want. I think,” he laughs, something like giddiness, “I like everything about you, maybe? God, that’s stupid, but I think I mean it? I definitely mean it.”
The corner of Cas’ mouth lifts, a tacit admission that Dean is at least somewhat right. Dean can let it drop, for now.
“No shit?” Dean tries to picture it. Crowley helping hell’s finest earn their moral GEDs. What a world.
“Uh, what?” Dean blinks his eyes open, peering at the alarm clock on the nightstand for confirmation.
And Dean knows that’s true, probably the truest thing there is. He nods. Cas tips toward him until their foreheads are touching, and then, at the corner of Dean’s consciousness, he feels something. Something familiar, Cas-shaped. And Dean closes his eyes and lets it in, lets Cas in.
There’s a hand on his back then, between his shoulder blades, moving in slow circles. He feels Dean as a warm, solid line beside him, comforting and very much alive, as he should always be.
“Come on, come on...now, now,” he says to himself or to Cas, who knows. He clenches his free hand in Cas’ hair, pinning him close until he’s coming, near-blind and shaking with it. Cas sucks a patient kiss into the junction of neck and shoulder while he regains enough of an approximation of consciousness to remember his manners.
"Oh, yes. I wasn't sure if you'd - I didn't want to pressure you. Your mind is your own. Only show me what you want me to see."
“The next question is less enjoyable. Your most terrible memory. Dean - I think we should skip this one.”
“You could teach me a lot of things,” Dean replies without thinking. This is getting fucking treacherous.
Less than 150 miles to Buffalo. If Cas were to say he was perfectly calm, that would be a lie, and he’s trying not to do that anymore.
“So you said nothing has to change, if we -” He gestures between them, something clear and articulate he’s sure, “But if I wanted to kiss you again, is that a change?”
Second verse, same as the verse. Click click click as the car heads up the hill, Sam beside him, Eileen in the car behind them this time for moral support and to add another pair of eyes. They get to the peak, and—nothing. Just the perfectly normal plummet down the track to the tune of their fellow passengers terrified and joyous screams, around the loops and hairpin turns until they’re back in the station again. If Dean’s disappointed, he can’t feel it. At least not right now. Maybe next time he’s awake and horribly alone in the middle of the night, it’ll hit him. Cas is still gone.
“I’m not sure I - oh. You want me to let you take care of me, like you’ve taken care of Sam. Just like you’ve taken care of all your friends.”
They stop for lunch in Champaign, full to the brim with college town options that make Cas want to eat everything in sight. Sure, he is familiar with the historical roots and underlying chemistry of falafel, butter chicken, and pad Thai, but there is an unignorable urgency to the knowledge now.
“I know we don’t have to do everything,” Dean says with a squeeze to his hip. “But we could maybe...” The head of Dean’s cock presses between his legs, and Cas understands. He pushes back into it and gets his free hand into Dean’s hair. Then Dean gets the angle right and his dick shifts forward until it meets the back of Cas’ balls.
Cas hooks a leg around his waist then, rolling them again until he’s pressing Dean into the mattress and oh, that’s better. Cas shifts down between his knees, a hand on the center of Dean’s chest when Dean tries to sit up to chase his mouth.
Cas nods, lips grazing over Dean’s cheek. “Thank you,” he whispers, like Dean would ever be anything other than generous with him.
“Your chili is already fantastic, as I hope you are well aware. The addition of stout beer last time was inspired.”
“I’m going to need you to pull the car over,” Cas says after a few more mile markers have flashed by.
Dean shakes his head. He can’t picture it. Something about Gabriel without that spark of utter chaos and hedonism in his eyes feels wrong. Cas signals to the bartender for a refill, who slides a second glass across the bar to each of them.
“I’m starting to get an idea.” Dean grinds down as Cas pushes up, and he watches enraptured as the flush on Cas’ face travels down his chest. He’s close.
Cas snags one of the lime wedges that came with Dean’s food and squeezes it over his own plate. “But not about that.”
“Cas, come on,” Dean says, huffing a laugh and rolling his eyes, and Cas knows him well enough to know he’s hiding nerves.
Sam says, leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed behind his head like he's the genius who figured out the meaning of the universe and not an asshat little brother who doesn't know shit about gardening.
Cas watches through the window as a beautiful woman in a bright hijab gathers his new friend in her arms, and Cas smiles. Oh, the joy of a homecoming.
Dean’s rhythm falters, and Cas notices. Because of course he does. He cups Dean’s face in his hands, thumbs sweeping across his cheeks. But Dean’s busy here, he is, so instead of reacting to the unasked question in how gently Cas is touching him, he takes as much into his throat as he can and presses two fingers behind Cas’ balls.
“I just - I want you, alright?” Dean groans. “Fuck, I’ve thought about this so many times, you have no goddamn idea.”
"You can still - it's okay if you touch me, in the way you always have," Cas says, trying to keep the exasperation out of his voice. Dean has been acting conspicuously careful since they got back, and he’s tired of it. He misses the casual, easy way Dean put his hands on him before. "You aren't leading me on."
"'Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common,' Cas reads aloud as he pushes his half-eaten plate of pawpaw pie across the table toward Dean. “Besides a willingness to sacrifice for one another, obviously.”
“Okay, alright. Like, some mystery cult, Dionysus shit? I can see where that could be, uh. Cool.” Understatement of the millennium. Dreams, indeed.
“God, I love you,” he says on an exhale, the only thing he can think to say. The truest thing is probably the best place to begin anyway. “Should’ve told you before. Years ago.”
“I don’t think you understand how anomalous strawberries in July are, Dean,” Cas says on their lunch break one day, adding a line about the occurrence to his logbook.
The next time Cas’ dick rubs against his ass, it’s slick. Dean fists his cock, twisting his hand and matching Cas’ thrusts against him.
He clasps a hand on Cas’ shoulder with a gentle squeeze as he goes, a friendly, familiar gesture. Except this time, he pulls back too quickly to be natural, an expression on his face like he's been caught shoplifting.
"Huh. Never thought about that. Being famous - infamous, whatever - was never really something I had any control over."
,” Dean says, like the word doesn’t taste right on his tongue. “And don’t friends usually, I don’t know, give a fuck when you’re hungry? Or stranded cross-country and broke as hell?”
“You’re worth more than the sum of your skills, formidable though they may be,” Cas says, slipping his hand underneath the hem of Dean’s shirt, fingertips ghosting over his tailbone and making Dean shudder. “What’s more, considering the absence of any remaining higher power, and the closed gates to heaven and hell, one could argue we’ve gotten out too. And I’m still here. With you.”
“What, pray tell, could you have done differently?" Cas says pointedly. "And at what point in time? You’re not to blame for the cosmic misfortune that has dogged your entire adult life. And, as if my own romantic history is any more exemplary. As I told you yesterday, I once married a woman for insurance reasons, and that’s my
The sessions with Naomi make Dean flinch. Cas is killing copies of him at her command, hundreds of begging, pleading Deans, over and over again. But when it's actually him, Cas drops the knife. This part, Dean remembers for himself, albeit through the pain-soaked haze of a broken nose and jaw. The explanation for what broke Naomi's hold on him though - that's new.
Cas keeps close as Dean pulls a mug out of the cupboard and fills it from the fresh pot. He takes the coffee with a mumble that could pass for gratitude and continues to use Dean’s body as willing scaffolding until his own comes online enough to support his weight. Meanwhile, Dean pours another round of pancake batter into the skillet in even rounds. He goes ahead and gives one Mickey Mouse ears for the hell of it - Jack might like that. He adds chocolate chips to his mental grocery list for the next time they make a run into town. For all his quasi-god powers, the kid is still three years old.
“And this, uh, thing,” Dean says, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the water at their backs, “Is up for a bumpy commute back home?”
“Gonna figure out everything you like,” Dean murmurs as he mouths a trail across the flat of his back. His hand leaves Cas’ cock before he runs his fingers lightly over Cas’ balls and then behind them, circling closer to where Cas very much wants him to be, until he diverts back up and tight around Cas’ dick again. How he does all this while keeping up the sinuous roll of his hips, Cas can only guess. Next time - next time he might be
A thunderstorm rolls in on a night in early July. The morning after, Dean notices a few shingles in the yard. While Cas picks pole beans and pulls weeds, Dean digs a ladder out of the shed and climbs up onto the roof.
Meanwhile, the research dries up. Sam finds the owner’s obituary in a Jacksonville newspaper. Jack finds the county record of title transfer to the owner’s daughter a couple weeks later. But every day, the only tire tracks in the driveway are the Impala’s, and no one seems to know or care that they’re there. Except the garden itself.
“Whenever you’re ready,” Eileen says gently, in that voice he recognizes from a thousand stints as a fake FBI agent, local deputy, or member of the clergy. Except this time, he’s the vic. Huh.
“‘What roles do love and affection play in your life?’” he asks, feeling more than a little squirrely about saying the words
know. He’s been riding shotgun to Dean’s fucked up feelings for Cas for a decade. He knows, better than anyone.
Dean - exaggeration,” Cas gasps, fingers clenched in Dean’s hair as Dean works an unrushed trail of kisses across his stomach, Cas’ cock brushing against the side of his face.
The drive up from the main road is over a deep bed of pine needles, with the occasional fallen tree branch requiring a stop to clear the path. The stairs to the porch creak and groan on their way up, and Dean has some well-founded doubts about the integrity of the floorboards. He tries the handle - the key long since lost - and the door doesn’t so much swing open as admit defeat and fall out of its frame, hinges rusted through.
In Galveston, Cas gives him turn-by-turn directions until he’s pulling into a sandy parking lot where land gives way to the Gulf. It’s a weekday in the off-season, and there are no other cars in sight.
“So you define your life most essentially by your relationships,” Cas says with a serious nod, like Dean’s answer was something profound.
Cas’ grip on his hair tightens when Dean presses a chaste (so to speak) kiss to the head of his cock. It may have been a minute since he’s done this, but some skills don’t fade. He licks his lips, then gets a hand on Cas’ ass to tug him forward. He has no idea if anyone has done this for Cas before. Has anyone’s been on their knees for him, learned what he tastes like, gotten him off? If they have, Dean’s going to be better. Cas won’t even remember them.
unmarked graves in the middle of Nowhere, Arkansas to find the vengeful ghost taking out her frustrations on the family down the road.
“I would look at you, while I tell you all the things that make you my favorite being to ever walk this earth,” Cas says hotly into his ear, the weirdest pillow talk and yet alarmingly effective.
“The pleasure of the act wasn’t overstated,” Cas says like an absolute maniac, like ‘pleasure of the act’ is something one guy can say to his friend in a motel room without it meaning something. Maybe it means something. “I’d like to return the favor.”
“While there is probably little I can do to assist, if you would like to talk about it, I am happy to listen.”
Dean shakes his head and lets out a long, slow breath. “No, no. I mean, kind of? But no. That was awesome.”
He isn’t disappointed. Dean wraps his arms around his shoulders, Cas’ hands coming up around his back, and he’s being held so, so tight.
“It’s, uh. I mean, overall, it’s a sack of sad shit, you know?” Dean swirls the whiskey in the bottom of his glass, marveling at the tiny, golden, tornado it makes.
A few days later, Dean is flipping pancakes at the bunker’s hulking stove when Cas sidles up behind him, the sound of his slippers scuffing on the tile giving away his approach. He tips his forehead against Dean’s back with a grunt, his hand first finding its way around Dean’s waist, then under his robe.
“Privacy sounds good,” Cas says, offering the woman a warm smile. “That will work well for all the...sleeping...we’ll be doing.”
Even Sam eats pie for breakfast now. He says he’s just enthusiastic about the antioxidants, but Dean knows for a fact that his raspberry pie is so good, it’s brought at least one grown man to tears. That man was Dean, sure, but still. Damn good pie.
“‘What is your most treasured memory?’” Cas asks, and it occurs to Dean that Cas must have memorized the questions a couple hundred miles southwest at least.
"Better?" he asks against the side of Cas’ neck, sucking a kiss behind the curve of his jaw and over his pulse point.
Cas smiles. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the adage goes, ‘Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his -’”
"Oh, then, let me just -" Cas pets at his hair as Dean hollows his cheeks and tries to remember to breathe in between letting Cas’ cock bump against the back of his throat. "Should I roll over, or should you? That feels so
“Yeah, your baby babbling in Sumerian before she starts crawling might’ve been a giveaway that something was up,” Dean says. He’s not wrong.
It’s dark when Dean next opens his eyes. He tries to sit up only to be pulled back down into the sheets by familiar arms.
“You’re ridiculous,” Cas says, and then there’s a hand on Dean’s side, tugging him close until his ass is pressed to Cas’ crotch, Cas arm snug around him like this is a thing they do.
Cas bends forward, his mouth inches from the Dean’s cock, heavy and throbbing against his thigh. “I see.” He lets his lips make the barest of contact. The fractional suggestion of a tease, so that Dean can feel it when he says, “So you don’t want me to -”
“So good at this, so good for me. I could keep you here, stop time and just do this forever, how does that sound?”
“Yeah, I know. I’m really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, guys. We might just have to call this one a win and move on,” Sam says, leaning back in his chair.
Room key in hand, Dean sees Cas waiting for him, leaning against the Impala’s passenger side door with their bags slung over one shoulder and the neck of a mostly-full whiskey bottle in his hand. Dean jerks his head toward room 3 in invitation, and Cas follows him.
They drink the rest of their tea and say goodnight in the hall between their bedrooms. The bed is still too firm, the room too unnaturally dark and still, but Cas sleeps. Must have been the chamomile.
“Promises are exceptionally important in aquatic reptilian culture,” Cas says. “It will be here, waiting for us.”
Cas opens the map app, searching for nearby options. He wonders at Dean’s trust in him, either not to snoop or not to judge whatever he happens to see. He navigates them to a place not far from the highway and studiously ignores the occasional text notifications.
“Fine. Uh, 2010. At an open mic night in central Ohio - I sang a little something for Lisa.” Dean rubs at a scuff on the dash, and remembers the way Lisa had smiled at him so much brighter than he deserved for a few mumbled verses of ‘Walk the Line.’
“No, you don’t understand, Dean,” Cas says, one hand fisted in the back of Dean’s shirt, the other spread on his thigh. Dean can feel the press of every fingertip. “How long I’ve -”
“I don’t know, Cas. To fly, I guess,” Dean says, turning around to shuck off his top layers before he carefully lies down next to Cas, on top of the blankets. He’s just sober enough to leave a solid, sanity-preserving six inches between their bodies.
“Not that kind of deal,” Cas says, shaking his head. He waves a hand slowly through the air, and the clouds clear at the same time the hot static in Dean’s mind starts to settle. “I shouldn’t have used that word. This is more of a diplomatic accord.”
He can feel the callouses on Cas’ palms, the strength in his grip when he’s holding Dean down or holding him up.
Cas laughs wetly, pulling Dean closer and bringing their mouths back together, smiling into the kiss. He should smile all the fucking time, every day for the rest of their lives.
“The last time I cried in front of someone was in that barn, as I was dying. The last time I told you I loved you.”
“Jack tried - you gotta know that,” Dean says, anticipating him. As if Cas had any doubt. “The Empty did something, blocked him this time.”
“I wouldn’t have saved your life only to fellate you to death,” Cas says, head tipped to the side and smiling like he’s proud of himself.
The garden pays him back tenfold as sweet corn and ghost peppers and figs fill the buckets Dean optimistically leaves empty by the front gate every morning.
“The vagaries of human sexual orientation were new to me at the time,” Cas says, understating it just a little, “and then, apropos of nothing, you mentioned that puppets on a children’s show were gay and that you were going to facilitate me having sex.
“Closer,” Cas says, like he isn’t already inside, like they aren’t already sharing the same recycled molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Less than ninety minutes later, the bus is pulling up to the downtown Buffalo Greyhound Station, a brutalist concrete building with severe, dark windows. It doesn’t match the helium in his heart as he looks around for the Impala. Not seeing it, Cas stretches his arms above his head in the sunshine, letting out the kinks in his spine, and looks around for a place to wait.
The room has that clean, mostly-sterile smell that would be out of place in any of the thousands of motels Dean’s spent his life in, and there’s an honest-to-god duvet on the bed instead of a polyester coverlet that’s seen too much. He steps into the bathroom and doesn’t see one bit of mold or peeling wallpaper. Surreal.
Sam holds up a hand in the universal symbol of 'I'm alright' and lopes awkwardly through the neatly-spaced rows toward them, all gangly limbs like he never aged past fifteen. Dean can hear snippets of Carl and Jody’s quiet conversation off to the side, her steady reassurances that this was a one time thing and none of his future customers are going to get plucked out of the air mid-fall.
Dust motes swirl in the air when the sunrise creeps through the beat-up vinyl blinds. The waitress refills his coffee cup for the third time when she brings his food. In the meantime, he checks and rechecks his phone, switching it from vibrate to full-blast out of fear that he’s going to miss a call from Cas. But what if he wakes up in the middle of nowhere, like he always seems to do, and he can’t find a payphone? Are there even payphones anymore? Shit.
Cas rests his forehead against his used-to-be-totally-flat belly and just breathes against his skin, interspersed with the occasional kiss as Dean runs his fingers through his hair, heartbeat settling.
“Just a quick hand job first,” Dean bargains, reaching for the lube on the nightstand. “You can come on my ass, too.”
“So, next question,” Cas says. ‘Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?’”
Cas sets a hand on his shoulder, squeezing. And that’s a thing they’re doing now, the casual touch. It’s absurdly comforting.
“For all intents and purposes, yes,” Cas answers, leaving out the bit about how he would know Dean Winchester’s cosmic stamp upon this earth until his atoms were scattered across the sea. As far as transporting himself to Lebanon, that is unfortunately beyond his present abilities.
It’s not like Dean forgot. Not for a second. Instead, he feels the weight of all the shit Cas gave up so he could save the world and spend the rest of his days ganking baddies and complimenting Dean’s cooking.
Dean knows that isn’t a come-on. It isn’t. Just a completely innocent, honest turn of phrase that means exactly what it sounds like. Except that isn’t any better, because
Dean fishes a few crumpled up bills out of the glovebox to pay the entrance fee and parks the car in the back of the lot nearest the hiking trails. From there, it’s a half mile walk on a hilly path through the sand dunes until the trees thin out and give way to the shore.
Cas turns his head toward him, a bitten back smirk on his face. Dean takes in the bedhead hair and the glassy-eyed satisfaction on his face that screams
Dean’s knee jerks under the table, jostling their plates with a clatter. Cas ignores it and continues.
He should have expected this, in retrospect. Of course, Cas would apply as much concentration to getting into his ass as he did to angelic warfare in another life. His free hand rubs circles against Dean’s hip as he circles the tip of a finger just inside, slow slow slow.
“What, done this myself and forgotten about it?” Dean glances at him, apologetic, as though this, of all things, would offend him. “Yes, that is perfectly possible.”
“Yes. It was early in my time on earth, and he must have mistaken my bewilderment at a food truck that sold chicken and waffle ice cream sandwiches for abject poverty. He’s a good choice for a dining companion.”
“Go to sleep,” Cas instructs, yawning against the back of his neck. “In the morning, I’ll answer your question. I’ll even give you a hint. You’re part of the answer.”
“I said, it won’t happen again. The situation is akin to a grizzly bear wandering onto a sheep farm. Tragic for the sheep, but not the bear’s fault. Provided the creature is returned to its normal habitat, no one else will come to harm. Except for the sturgeon, I suppose.”
Dean would smile, but his mouth is busy. There is something he wants though, first. He drops to his side next to Cas, replacing his mouth with his hand, loose and just enough to keep Cas grasping at the sheets. He kisses at Cas’ shoulder, his chest, sucking at a nipple for a second.
“Alright, well, then we’ve gotta burn it down, right? Salt the earth or something?” Dean says, stomach sinking. Or maybe that’s just hunger. He eyes his plate - the eggs are probably fine, right? If they weren’t touching the fucking
This doesn’t exactly seem like a critical life skill, but Cas doesn’t argue. It’s nice to spend time together.
Cas stirs beside him, arm going snug around his chest. Dean shifts back against him, his bare ass against Cas’ dick.
It's that dock again, the one from that dream all those years ago. The sky is awash in oversaturated color, cicadas buzzing in the late-summer heat. Why is it always the ass-side of August in his subconscious? Bats are swooping low over the water, and the overgrown grass is soft under his feet. There's no chair this time and no fishing pole, so for lack of something more obvious to do, he cuffs his jeans and sits down on the old, greening boards at the edge of the dock and lets his feet dip into the water.
Dean groans, face heating. “Oh my god, I walked right into that one. I meant your place in the agreement with Jack and the angels.”
“It’s fine, it’s cool. We can do that,” Dean says, arching his back and neck in a stretch that he’s fully aware he pulls off. “I don’t mind.”
Dean zones out then, lulled by the warmth of the fire, the warmth of Cas’ palm on his skin, the slow and searching pressure of the fingers inside him.
know what I mean. You know that it’s different. How he feels about you—nothing is stronger than that.”
The laughing stops as they seem to experience a synchronized realization of how they fit together. From there, it’s so simple, so obvious, how Dean can move against him. Dean’s hand on his hip sliding beneath his thigh, lifting it up until Cas understands what he’s meant to do. Ankles hooked together behind Dean’s ass, he’s not sure his very recently-renewed body has the flexibility for this until Dean shifts forward, gliding hot and sweat-slick and nearly perfect.
Cas looks over at him, brow furrowed. “Yes? Is that a question? I can understand all tongues ever spoken on Earth, although unfortunately, this vessel isn’t capable of responding in kind.”
In for a penny, in for a pound. Dean shifts forward until he’s resting atop Cas’ ass, and wow, that’s...a lot. He curls his fingers over Cas’ shoulders, thumbs digging into the creaky knots at the join of neck and shoulder. Each downward press pushes a little hitching breath from Cas. Cas hums when Dean’s thumb finds a knot at the back of his neck, and when he moves both hands up to dig into his hair and press against his scalp, he earns an honest-to-god moan. Dean drags it out as long as seems even remotely defensible, Cas pliant and boneless beneath him.
“I’m not sure I trust it yet, but I...I think that’s where I’m at too,” Dean says before trying to coax slippery rice noodles into his spoon.
“Ariel has better hair,” Cas says, trying to decide if he should take the comparison as a compliment or an insult.
“Figured you’d be hungry,” Dean says as Cas dives in. “I’ll make you something better at the bunker, promise.”
“It might be advisable to wait until morning. I want to water the tomatoes, and doing so at night encourages the development of various harmful fungi.”
“The next question might be a challenge as well, but in a different manner,” Cas says, pulling out his wallet and laying a pair of crisp twenties on the table. “Maybe on the way to a motel? There’s one not far. And even better, the Google reviews are without a single recent mention of bed bugs.”
Cas awakens with a start, shoulders clenched against the dream’s phantom ache. It’s near dawn, going by an angelically-accurate sense of time he hasn’t yet lost. He’s in Dean’s bed in the geographical center of the United States, not on a rocky coastline in Maine. He adjusts to the reality of his surroundings to the tune of Dean’s steady and peaceful breathing beside him. Cas can’t see his face in the near-total darkness of the room, the only light coming from the sliver of space between the door and the floor where the weak light from the hallway ekes in. He lightly places a hand in the center of Dean’s back, feeling the steady rise and fall.
“Burgers sound okay?” Dean asks, mouth thin. He digs his phone out of his pocket, unlocking and handing it over. “Find us a spot, yeah?”
“For the rest of our days,” Dean says with a yawn. “And most importantly right now, our nights. I have it on good authority that there’s a memory foam mattress in there calling our names.”
“Shit, this is a caper, isn’t it?” Dean says, grinning. “Do I get a codename? It’s ‘Clooney,’ for obvious reasons.”
Then before Dean can catch his breath, Cas is moving backward, resettling between his knees and swallowing his dick in one shockingly impressive go. Dean arches up into his mouth.
“That I love you, I’m in love with you, all that - I need those new languages you were talking about,” Dean babbles, eyes squeezed shut. “Take your pick.”
He sees himself sleeping in a dozen shitty motel rooms, always badly. He watches Cas place a steady palm on his back or his shoulder or his arm, and then, invariably, he sees his own face settle and his fists unclench in the sheets. He feels how proud Cas is each time, how glad he is that he can do this one small thing right.
Dean is not going to ask a follow-up question. He’s not, definitely not. The terrain ahead is full of landmines. But then he hears words come unbidden out of his own mouth.
At some point near Decatur, Dean turns the volume down on the music but keeps his eyes steadfastly on the road.
“No, no - I’m fine. One too many Red Bulls on the way or something,” he says, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Really fuckin’ good to have you back, man.”
Dean turns to look at him, and Cas’ eyes dart away—historically a harbinger of some of their worst shared moments. “You saying you don’t have a choice either way?”
“I’m not sure either of us were ready for this in 2008, Dean,” Cas says warmly against the shell of his ear. Dean shudders, his hands still gripping stupidly at Cas’ coat and that thing has gotta come
“It’s up to you,” Dean says with a vague hand gesture he hopes conveys how deeply he is definitely not invested in Cas’ decision. “Are you - are you into him?”
Dean huffs. “Not the point. It’s in your nature, man. Not just me, either. Jack, Sam - you see the good in people, even when they’ve fucked up. Maybe especially then.”
After Cas gets snatched, Chuck gets beat, and Jack gets promoted to the new god, Dean drives the speed limit, he fully cooks his burgers, and he keeps to a max of two (three) drinks a night.
“You’re going to need to be more specific,” he says, stirring the honey in until it dissolves. “I do a lot of things.”
“It’s perfect,” Jack says, neatly slicing his bell pepper chunks into strips before spearing them with his fork. Who taught him that? It obviously wasn’t Sam.
“Dean, I know what you’re thinking.” Dean is sure Cas does not, in fact, know. “But if you read the article, you'll see. The research behind it is peer-reviewed, it's science. It's... it's
“I promise to make every attempt to do so,” Cas says, and he means it. He’ll wear a seatbelt, look both ways when he crosses the street, and avoid making any life-or-death deals with cosmic entities.
“I do get that. In Sam’s defense, I asked him if there were any other potential hunts between here and Lebanon, and he insisted he and Eileen have everything covered.”
“Not intentionally. When an angel is tasked with protecting a human, it is inevitable that certain commonplace elements of their existence will be on display. I didn’t - it wasn’t like I...at the time, it held no personal appeal.”
The ride up to the fifth floor is quiet. Dean has one hand stuffed in his pocket, the other fiddling with a buckle on the side of his duffel. He follows Cas down the hallway and shifts his weight from foot to foot as Cas unlocks the door to their room and holds it open for him. Cas clicks on the light before he moves close to Dean, gently lifting the bags off his shoulder and setting them on the desk.
Dean thinks of at least eighteen examples from his shitty, violent soap opera of a past to argue the point.
and then before Dean can manage a complete thought or say a single word in reply, he's halfway across the room. He knows Sam and Jack are watching him, watching them. They know everything already, so what does it matter? He's got an audience, and he doesn't give a shit.
Cas looks a little floored. His expression softens, shifting from agitated to fond, the crinkles at the corners of his eyes replacing the deep vee between his brows.
“Right. So, a normal death, at a normal age. Something that doesn’t involve my guts getting spewed on the cement.”
By the time they’ve swapped places and Dean is clean, dry, and wrapped in his best Dead Guy Robe, Cas is already asleep, the rise and fall of his chest visible in the thin lines of light let through by the motel’s shitty blinds.
Cas laughs, before shrugging out of his t-shirt in an effortlessly unpracticed way that Dean finds undeniably sexy. He steps out of his pants and horrible boxers, stopping to fold the whole mess thoughtfully and place it on top of his dresser, as thought he might need to be presentable and dressed again at a moment’s notice. Cas pulls back the covers, sliding in beside him but leaving several inches of space.
Dean steps over to the meticulously organized tool rack Dean himself had built earlier in the summer.
The shuffle of showers and changing clothes before they settle into their respective beds is unremarkable. This in itself is surprising. Cas now occupies a reality where he has openly talked about how long he’s loved Dean and then not an hour later argued with him about the relative merits of Cheers re-runs vs. a children’s cooking competition as ideal pre-sleep television programming.
It’s a statement, not a question. Dean believes him. That makes his task easier. All Dean needs is to hear it again, sober and in the light of day.
Once he’s got Cas’ arms free, he prompts him to sit up, then works to retie his wrists behind his back in an easy double column. With a little help, Cas scoots until his back is flush against the headboard, pulling the ankle rope taut. Dean slicks up his cock again before he climbs into his lap, locking Cas into place with his knees on either side of his hips.
“You’ll see what I mean. The question is, ‘Your house, containing everything you own suddenly...floods. After saving your loved ones, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why?’”
But instead, she nods serenely, smiling. "Excellent choice. You're both beautiful creatures, blessed by the stars above. I'll be back with your drinks in a moment, and the appetizer will be out soon."
,” Cas gasps, as Dean gives his best attempt at swallowing around his dick and nearly choking with the effort. Cas pets at his face, cards a hand through his sweaty hair and then sits back, drawing his dick out of Dean’s well-fucked mouth.
"Mm, or maybe that could, uh, wait?" Dean says into his ear, fingers slipping underneath the bottom hem of Cas' threadbare t-shirt.
Cas’ arm goes around his waist, the other snaking under Dean’s pillow until it all suddenly fits. Dean reaches out to click off the lamp, leaving the room in that unnatural darkness that comes with living underground.
“Huh.” Sam's eyebrows are all pulled together like Dean is a particularly poorly translated summoning spell.
“Uh,” Dean blinks through the grit in his eyes and tries to assess if he’s going to drive them into a ditch if he tries to be a hero. “Hey, hand me that box of tapes. If we get some Metallica going, I can do this.”
Then, there’s a split-second of stomach-dropping weightlessness until he registers that the concrete has been replaced with memory foam. Cas’ mouth is still busy, his hands kneading at Dean’s thighs and spreading him open.
“Not what I meant,” Dean clarifies. “Ireland sounds great. It’s just, Cas and I were gonna head up to Whitefish and see if Rufus’ cabin is still standing.”
“Out with Charlie. It’s Buffy trivia night at the bar in Mankato. And wait, Isn’t the shovel speech supposed to be for the
“‘If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?’” Cas reads off his phone.
“You gotta stay,” Dean says, face buried in Cas’ shoulder as Cas sweeps his hands over his back. “And I know it’s selfish to ask, but I’m telling you...I’m asking you to stay.”
“It was this case on a college campus, real hippy-dippy place,” Dean says, remembering the lingering smell of patchouli and weed. “The pho was some kind of special-of-the-day thing in the cafeteria. Nothing legit.”
“You have paid a high price in this life, Dean Winchester,” she says quietly. “I give you my blessing, and my protection, now and for the rest of your days.”
“Jack and, well...me, as well as the remaining angels. Both the few who were still alive and the uncorrupted ones Jack raised from the Empty.”
Dean looks both ways before he crosses the street between the donut shop and convenience store in town, he doesn't go home with the hot woman at the bar who looks like trouble and a good time in equal measure. She probably wasn’t dangerous, not really, but it just doesn’t seem right. Not when Cas—he's being
The good mood that has prevailed over the day is more or less shot, so they make for the exit. They’d planned to stay over at a motel and head back in the morning, but Dean needs something to keep his hands busy or he’s gonna lose it. It’s a quiet, long car ride home.
“Right on time - the orchids. Just over there,” Cas says, a hand on his shoulder steering him to look northwest toward the lake.
Dean tries to shake off the weirdness, deciding not to be a little offended that Cas apparently doesn’t want to get naked around him anymore. He imagines how that conversation would go.
“When me or Sam are on the brink of death, yeah. I get that. But, uh.” Shit, cards on the table. “What if I need you around a little more than that? For other stuff.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, and his voice sounds much the same as the last time Cas heard it, choked and disbelieving. “You okay, man?”
“I never said it didn’t have to do with you. It absolutely does. My relationship with you is the bar by which I would measure any other friend, which possibly does them a disservice.”
Dean sees hell laid waste. Cas blurs the images - a kindness - so all Dean’s getting are impressions, and the feelings. The way Cas felt when he killed his ten thousandth demon and came face-to-face with Dean, torturing some poor, screaming soul on the rack. Except he doesn’t feel revulsion from Cas. Instead, it’s shock, and something possessive. Dean shudders with the force of it.
There's Cas, lonely, human, and exhausted on the cold tile floor of the Gas n' Sip, his work vest bunched up beneath his head like the world's saddest pillow, typing out and deleting texts to Dean. And Dean can't take it anymore.
“You’re already well aware that I can be counted among those charmed by you,” Cas says, dry as a bone, and if Dean didn’t know better, he’d call it flirting. Is it flirting?
A span of minutes is lost after that until Dean can rouse himself enough to reach around blindly for wherever his phone ended up. Cas reaches under the couch and hands it over to him.
“Sure, he’ll kill Hitler and shoot the devil in the face, but even after everything, telling you he -”
Dean digs in his pocket, and hands Cas a key. It’s heavy, tarnished brass to match the lock it fits.
to stick around. I mean.” Oh, that was more than he meant to say. “I want someone to want that. Want me.”
Cas pushes him backwards, just an inch or two so he can catch his breath. “That’s not the issue. I can’t think
“I wasn’t going to,” Dean hears himself saying. He busies himself with slurping a spoonful of rich broth as Cas studies him.
“Surprisingly, your natural charisma wasn’t the first thing I noticed when you stabbed me in the heart.”
He wants to pick Cas up, carry him across the room and do something extravagant like fuck him against the wall, but he’s forty-fucking-one years old and that’s just not in the cards. So he settles for tugging Cas closer and mouthing a line up his neck. Cas hums, hands stroking over his back.
“Maybe something a bit more long-term than that,” Dean says, throwing a grin at Cas and thinking about the things they can do with a bit of privacy. “You have a passport good enough to get through customs?”
Dean groans and buries his face in Cas’ neck, sucking a kiss into his shoulder as he gets his hands under Cas’ shirt.
“Or not,” Dean says, smiling at him, and Cas has wanted to see that particular smile for years. He’s seen it aimed at waitresses and bartenders and the occasional hunter but never at him. Not when he was looking, anyway. “It’s just nerves, that’s all I’m saying. But we can stop. If that’s what you want.”
“‘If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him to know,’” Cas says.
“‘What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?’” Cas asks halfway through his platter of carnitas at a mom-and-pop Mexican restaurant near the park.
Cas doesn’t answer, tonguing over his balls and back up his dick as Dean runs fingers through his hair.
“Uh, there is something I always wondered. You might know the answer, actually. Heavenly plans, and all that. What would I have been like, if Mom hadn’t died and Dad hadn’t gone crazy? If Sam wasn’t earmarked for Lucifer. Would I have been just some normal guy?”
“I like you so much,” Cas says one night into the still darkness, holding him a little tighter than usual. “Please don’t leave me.”
It shouldn't be legal to be this tired before nine in the morning. But Cas had woken him up with a very motivating mouth on his dick two hours ago, and since then, Dean's already hauled several reels of soaker hoses and roughly a million bags of cedar mulch from hardware store to car to garden bed at Cas' ready instruction. He can feel the back of his neck starting to burn in the strong Kansas sunshine.
“Whatever you’re going to say,” Cas says, kissing the warm curve of his shoulder, breathing the words against his skin, “I’m not going anywhere. Not if you don’t want me to.”
“Kinda thought I’d have a shirt on when I told you this. Or, you know. That I’d be dead and buried and never say it at all.”
“It’s not about - I mean, they’re exemplary, but that’s not the point. Don’t make light of what I’m saying.”
“I don’t live far - just on my way home, actually. So. Take the sandwich.” She smiles, and Cas adds another item to his list of the day’s minor miracles.
“Thank you,” they reply. That voice. Oh, god. Dean can’t bear to turn around, in case he’s wrong. “I’m actually here to meet a friend.”
Cas leans forward, sucking the head of Dean’s cock into his mouth as his lubed-up hand trails down behind his balls and lower. Dean tilts his hips up, a previously unknown reflex. Cas finds his mark, the pad of his thumb rubbing gently. Searching in the sheets, Dean finds the lube and nudges Cas’ hip with it.
“Every segment of my DNA, huh?” Dean murmurs into the valley of Cas’ hip, alone in their room at last.
“It’s purely subjective,” Cas says. “And you’re welcome to be my plus-one for dinner with Mr. Rogers, if that helps.”
When he finally bottoms out, he tips his face to the ceiling and catches his breath. He wraps a slick hand around his dick and strokes it, taking his time. Cas, the pinnacle of self-control, doesn’t fuck up into him, doesn’t move at all except for a shudder and a sharp inhale when Dean finally starts to move. Dean experiments with the angle until—there.
It occurs to Dean that there’s nowhere else he needs to be right now, and nobody who needs anything from him. That’s almost never happened before—when he’s been with someone, there’s always been a shortage of time or privacy or both. But here, with nowhere to go and no one to see, he doesn’t have a single job other than to withstand how good Cas’ fingers and mouth feel while he tries not to come too soon.
Cas laughs. “Alright, Dean. The hunt sounds easy enough. It shouldn’t be an issue to make it to the motel after, to rest.”
Dean switches the windshield wipers on as a fine mist starts coating the glass, the sky clouded over.
He can argue the case against himself all day long—judge, jury and executioner—but he can’t change what Cas thinks of him. And there was that kiss, on a dock that doesn’t exist anywhere but his own mind. He shakes his head, finishes the last of his coffee down to the grainy end, and stabs a piece of uninspiring cantaloupe like it’s wronged him personally. The waitress probably thinks he’s on the tailend of a bender, but he can’t be the first person to have had an argument with themselves at the crack of dawn in this diner.
“Let me do this for you too,” Cas eventually says on a gasp, as the rolls of his hips go uneven and his breathing turns shallow.
“Are you alright?” Cas asks. “You’ve barely touched your food. I shouldn’t need to tell you that behavior is entirely out of character.”
Cas considers the invitation. Over the winding course of their relationship, topics large and small have been off-limits. A door flung wide to
“No. Wait, once. Lisa, um. I’d had a fall at work - really torqued my back. She, I guess, yeah. Gave me a massage.”
“Time to sleep, buddy,” Dean says, patting Cas’ finely-haired stomach. Such a nice stomach. All of Cas is nice, really. Man, he’s exhausted.
“I did,” Cas says, pumping his fingers in and out as Dean hangs on to his shoulders. “In fairness to you, I did muddy the waters by telling all those assembled that I loved them too, so you might be forgiven for missing it.”
“I’m not sure I’m interested in a one-time thing, Dean,” Cas says, looking directly into his eyes. “Actually, I’m quite sure that I’m interested in something quite the opposite.”
“There’s room seven, which is closest to the ice machine. That’s important. Oh, or room four, which is closest to reception, like if you need an extra towel or something? Or ten, at the end. Our most private option.”
They stop for the night in central Wyoming, but after checking into the hotel, Cas prods him back to the Impala’s passenger side door and slides into the driver’s seat. They pick up Tex Mex from a food truck on a county highway and park in the empty lot at the trailhead to Casper Mountain as the sun is just starting to set. Dean doesn’t even argue when Cas’ hands go for his belt buckle when they reach a bench facing the lookout. He comes in Cas' mouth with his eyes closed tight against a brilliant pink and orange sky.
“I appreciate the sentiment. However, from a purely technical standpoint, I am. Angels were designed to be unthinkingly obedient emissaries of God’s intentions. And instead, I’m...well.”
“Couldn’t fix that when you were reassembling my musculoskeletal system or whatever?” Dean slurs, half-drunk on Cas’ touch already.
“There were understandable barriers at play, back then.” Cas separates flannels and jeans into separate, small piles even though he’s not still not sure why it matters. Is it about water temperature, perhaps? “The various threatened endings of the world took precedence over teaching me what fabric softener is for.”
Dean is fully aware of the dumbass smile he’s got going on, loving the guy in front of him so damn much. He nods, slipping his arms around Cas’ waist and kissing the side of his sun-warmed neck before burying his face in Cas’ shoulder.
“Hm.” Cas steals one of Dean’s sweet potato fries, and Dean lets him. Because, well. “Angels communicate affection far differently than humans. It took me years to understand, to appreciate the nuances of expression. Especially from you.”
“Not to be too on-the-nose, but a trench coat is for travelers, for wanderers. Not for people who...”
“He told me that he—he said a bunch of shit. He said he loved me. Told me right before he died.” Dean leaves off the part where Cas died
“Nah, I get it. I fold laundry sometimes. Get out the duster too - you wouldn’t believe how gross the fans in here get...anyway. Tea okay? Little late for coffee. Or early, I guess.”
Sam clears his throat and blinks rapidly. “No, uh, sorry. I just. I’m really happy for you guys. It’s already at like, move-into-each-other’s-rooms stage?”
Cas rolls his eyes, and it shouldn’t be possible to convey this much sarcasm with a mouth stuffed full of cock, and yet.
“Yeah, I could eat.” Dean racks his brain. Given that he’s criss-crossed this country a thousand times over, it takes a minute to call up the right stretch of highway in his mental rolodex of roadside grub. “You up for barbecue? There’s this place outside town, best ribs in the state.”
Cas’ fingers are drawing patterns across his chest, his breath warm on the back of Dean’s neck. Dean isn’t sure that he’s ever been happier than right now. That is, until the shitbag voice of insecurity from deep in his psyche makes itself known.
Something like relief and disappointment churns in his gut, zapping the quick flood of adrenaline. He imagines how it would feel to have the decision taken entirely out of his hands. His subconscious spilling the beans on all the stupid, sappy shit that rolls around his head. A humiliating miracle.
“Dean,” Cas says, swallowing hard and looking awestruck like Dean invented the art of giving head all on his own. On the contrary, most of his best tricks are ones he stole from Cas, picked up during hours spent under his lips and tongue. Turns out that an infinite lifetime of disinterestedly observing humanity has some unexpected side perks in the sex god department.
“The beaches across the bay on the Bolivar Peninsula are more pristine, but I thought you might object to the ferry,” Cas says, like he needs to make excuses for the adequacy of the fucking
“Hey,” Dean says, shoving at his shoulder, but his heart's not in it. He’s easy, fine. And Cas can keep up with the Mythbusters: Bible Edition all he wants if it means Dean gets to touch him.
Dean helps him load the day’s take into the trunk, relieved that unlike yesterday’s, it won’t require a repeat trip to the food pantry.
Dean would grin, would quip something cocksure and devastatingly charming, but instead he twists his tongue around the head of Cas’ dick and waits for him to pull himself together one methodical breath at a time. Ujjayi breathing, Cas had called it—a yoga thing probably more suited to a remote mountain forest than a basement in Kansas. Still, it isn’t long until he goes pliant again under Dean's hands, relaxing into the ropes. There’s skill on both sides of this game, and Dean will never stop being amazed at what Cas is capable of.
at this. Or at least, something approximating this. Practically a pro. But then Cas cups the side of his face in his hand, and his palm is warm, and Dean realizes he doesn’t have a goddamn clue. Cas’ other hand settles in his hair, petting. Dean leans into it, shameless for possibly the first time in his life.
Ok I feel morally compelled to admit that the Eastern Prairie Fringed Orchid blooms in late June, not September. I spent too long on the Michigan DNR's website.
“Glad you’re okay, man. So damn glad. At least, I think you’ve gotta be okay, right? Kinda doubt the Empty gives day passes. You’ve gotta be hanging out with Jack, then, I guess. Of course the kid saved you—the first thing he did, no doubt. You guys, going all cosmic, intergalactic adventurers. You deserve that, both of you do. You’ve always been such a good dad to that kid. I should’ve told you that. I should’ve told you a lot of things. Obviously. Or you wouldn’t have said...some of that stuff you said.”
“Do you have a spare t-shirt?” Cas asks. “This is my last one. The clothing I packed for this trip didn’t account for a lake monster.”
Dean nods, nods some more. A normal amount of nodding. He shouldn’t ask a follow-up question, he shouldn’t - “What do I have to do with telepathy?”
“Maine. And, I’m fine. No underwear, which is unfortunate. I cannot understand the appeal of ‘going commando,’ as you call it.”
More lube until he’s dripping with it, two fingers again, and they’re not enough. Dean fucks back into his hand, digging his toes into the cheap blanket they’d spread out before this started. Until Cas grips him by the hip, holding him still, and Dean lets himself be held. He closes his eyes and breathes, and feels his heart rate settle as he hands the reins over.
"You could, you know," Dean says quietly, hoping he doesn't have to spell it out. This is as much generosity as he can muster.
“Speaking of, that was some ceremony. You boys, all you’ve been through, and then to finally be here, getting
By unspoken agreement, they let themselves into the house, removing their shoes at the door in a probably-unnecessary show of respect that still feels warranted. Besides going up to the attic to repair the rafters when he was working on the roof, Dean hasn’t been in here much. They make their way to the living room at the back, and sit side by side on the olive green, 1970’s sofa facing the window. As they watch lightning streak across the sky and listen to the pitter patter of hailstones hitting the patio outside, Dean tries to decide if some dry ice and Sam’s hair dryer will be enough to get the dents out of the Impala’s roof tomorrow.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just got a little in my head for a minute there.” He needs to pull it together. Cas looks unconvinced. “Hey, I owe you a compliment.”
He can’t even make sense of it at first, what he’s seeing, everything he can feel from Cas’ mind. Then, the picture clears, and he sees snapshots of memories.
"He was possessed by Satan at the time," Cas scoffs. "But I suppose it's possible that the admittedly broken U.S. justice system wouldn't have taken that into account."
“Jack and I inserted a couple of caveats in the agreement as it was being drawn up,” Cas says, the twist of a grin on his face, like he’s pleased at his own cleverness. “Microscopic, in the scheme of things—just the permission to keep a small number of humans safe from the types of common mishaps that might result in an early death. Naomi and the others let it pass. I’ll confess...I may have picked up the nuances of contractual fine print from Crowley. Who is fine, by the way.”
Cas lifts his hand, fingers moving in a delicate pattern in the air. The lingering light fades from the sky like he’s turning down a dimmer switch. An impossible number of stars blink into existence and a full moon rises to cast a silvery glow over the water, all within the space of a few moments.
“Heaven,” Sam says. “They found a way to make more angels, complete with free will this time. He’s helping out for a little while. But Cas, what about you? What the hell happened? Where are you?”
“You wanna get out of here?” Dean whispers in Cas’ ear as he fidgets during a hot blue guy’s monologue about the importance of environmental conservation. Dean’s not really paying attention either.
“I took care of that earlier,” Cas says, snaking a hand around Dean’s midsection to wrap around his dick, fingers wrapping around Dean’s. “Free late checkout. All it took was some help on the Friday puzzle. I wasn’t stationed in Europe during the Reformation, but the names of the popes from that era are common knowledge.”
“So, yes. I see what you mean. Because you care about me, I’ll stop with the morbid home repairs, and I’ll tell you when I’m hungry if I can’t deal with it myself. I’d like to gain some self-sufficiency in that area though, seeing as my culinary skills are limited to taquitos and nacho cheese. A cookbook might help. One of Julia Child’s - her heaven was always delightful.”
“Anything else I can get for you, hon?” she asks, right on cue. “It’s a little early for pie, but you look like you could use a little something to perk you up.”
Cas nudges him with his shoulder. “I think we should aim for the spirit rather than the letter of the question. Which would you rather preserve in its prime - brain, or brawn?”
“Nah, it’s fine. What the hell, right? You already put it all out there on the table, why the fuck is it so hard for me to the do the same? What am I so scared is gonna happen?”
“What?" Cas says defensively, tucking a stray curl behind his ear and slipping his phone into his back pocket. “The water pressure from the well is weak, so I was concerned that the areas closer to the faucets would receive the lion’s share of the water, leaving the string beans parched, and that just won’t work. So what I did was -”
“Yeah. Kurt’s son.” Dean picks out the bright blue spine from the shelf on the wall and hands it over.
The shower beckons eventually, and they both cram under the shitty, two-short nozzle to wash each other clean, kissing water from one another’s lips until shower sex starts sounding like a better idea than it ever, ever is.
No doubt the gesture is meant to settle him. But, since it’s the first point of real-life contact they’ve had since the night Cas got snatched, it feels a little like being tenderly electrocuted. He could lift a car right now, or have a panic attack. Maybe both. He’s versatile. Lifting his gaze from the menu’s omelet section takes only slightly less bravery than facing down demons and angels and Chuck.
Cas’ finger slides home, and oh god, this is already so much better than doing this alone with bad angles and the constant threat that someone, somewhere is going to interrupt.
"Oh." Dean tries to get his brain to shift gears. "Sure. I mean, the bunker is kinda forty feet underground though. That's a lot of dirt to move."
Another strip mall. Today has a theme, apparently, but Cas hasn’t steered them wrong gastronomically yet. Dean is operating on earned faith.
"Dean, you have to -" Cas rocks up and back, fucking into Dean's mouth just a little until Dean grips his hips with both hands, holding him down. Dean takes in more of Cas’ cock each time he sinks down, which Cas seems to appreciate.
He’s about to let Sam hear it, about to unleash all the fury and bitterness that’s been taking root in his head since the night everything went to shit. But then he realizes something—Sam
“Debatable,” Dean replies, before shaking his head and getting out of the car. Cas only has a moment to attempt to decipher that before Dean drops his duffel bag into Cas’ lap. “Pick out whatever you want.”
Cas laughs, cupping one hand around the back of Dean’s neck before sliding his fingers into his hair and using the other to haul the blankets over them both.
“Hey, you been going grocery shopping? Somewhere new?” Dean asks Sam one morning, as Sam meticulously spreads almond butter on his whole wheat toast.
Later, with shower-warm skin against clean sheets and Cas in his arms, Dean traces over the faint impressions the ropes made on his wrists. The marks will be gone in a day or two, but Cas is staying forever.
Dean orders up a couple whiskey doubles, neat. Mid-shelf stuff, he can’t handle that bottom of the barrel shit anymore since he hit 40. Cas sips his slowly, with a low hum.
Plates practically licked clean, Dean leans back against the vinyl bench with a satisfied hum. Cas dabs his mouth carefully with a napkin and then sets about stacking the plates and silverware into tidy piles. The waitress smiles at him when she clears the table, like recognizing like. Working in the service industry leaves a permanent mark on a person.
“Can I help?” Cas asks, not exactly sure how he could contribute. He is admittedly lacking in the practicalities of vehicle maintenance. He could hand Dean tools, but he seems to have that covered. There has to be something...
Dean is blushing. He knows he’s blushing. It’s stupid and embarrassing and when did it get so goddamn hot in this car. He fiddles with the A/C for something to do with his hands other than twist at the steering wheel.
There’s a knock at the door. Dean is immediately awake and alert, hand going for the closest gun only to remember it’s across the room in his bag rather than under his pillow where it belongs, like he’s a goddamn rookie out on his first spook hunt.
Sam takes Eileen’s hand, kisses her palm. “Eileen and I are going to Ireland for a while. Maybe a couple of months?”
“A quality writing implement makes a world of difference. We should consider upgrading the office supplies around the bunker.”
Dean finally gets his hands to cooperate long enough to push Cas’ coat off his shoulders and work his hands under the edge of his dress shirt, getting at warm skin. His groan is swallowed up by Cas’ mouth on his, hot and clinging. But then Cas is pulling away, and that’s, that can’t happen, he can’t
“Who else is left?” Cas asks, looking out of the window and taking in the sterile suburban office buildings, the ineffective highway sound barriers, the
Dean nearly chokes on his food at the mental image of Cas’ mouth on his, even fucking dying for lack of air. He swallows quickly and then gulps his beer.
The motel room has one bed, because of course it does. The guy at the check-in desk must’ve taken one look at Cas half-draped around Dean and made an understandable judgement call. Dean pours Cas into the room, propping him up against the wall as he double locks the door.
As Cas deals with reception, Dean looks over the tourism brochures in a rack on the wall. A twilight riverboat cruise, a guide to the area’s antique shops, a winery, and a museum dedicated to Buffalo Bill.
“Surely there were good moments too. I’ve been party to some of them,” Cas says, nudging him with his shoulder.
Dean wakes up to Cas’ fingers skating over his bare right hip. Dean’s the little spoon, a preference determined pretty much immediately after they started this thing two years ago.
"Okay?" Dean says, completely confused. "Wait, I didn't think we had any neighbors. This place is in the middle of goddamn nowhere."
Simple Texas cuffs go around Cas’ ankles, cinched together with an overhand knot and anchored firmly to the foot of the bed. He lets out a pleased groan when the rope goes taut, and Dean allows himself a quick glance at his cock, filled out and twitching against his thigh. Next, Dean winds and ties a column of rope below and above Cas’ knees, locking his legs together—unnecessary for immobilization at this point, sure, but it looks damn good. Cas hums when Dean settles on top of him, naked and straddling his rope-bound thighs with a bottle of lube in hand. Cas shifts and flexes in the bindings, a demonstration of pleasure rather than struggle, Dean knows.
It’s been about equal parts weird and weirdly normal since they’ve been back. Sam is conscientious to the point of absurdity, ducking out of rooms and peering around corners like he’s afraid to interrupt the romance of the century. And hell, maybe that’s legitimately what he and Cas have going on. They sure as shit have enough demonic possessions and amnesia to power a third-tier soap opera for more than a few seasons.
Cas leans across their licked-clean plates to show Dean a map of California on his phone, filled with color-coded icons.
“Mm, nope,” Dean answers, letting his heavy head loll onto Cas’ shoulder. “Got us a closer place. Just turn left, and go about a mile.”
The waitress plops the check down on their table, its plastic tray rattling on the formica. Without so much as glancing at the total, Cas fishes his wallet out of his pocket and sets more than a few twenties on top of the tray. Dean's pretty sure that equates to at least a 200% tip - Cas’ usual, stupidly attractive modus operandi.
“I’d spend my days with you. I’d fight by your side, if you want to keep fighting. Or I’d rest with you instead, doing only peaceful things. I’d annoy you and love you in equal measure. I’d buy you soft clothes and sweet coffee and learn how to make you breakfast.”
were back. We pulled them from the earth not eight hours ago. They typically require between sixty and eighty days from germination to harvest, not to mention, given the time of year and the force of the sun’s rays -”
The storm outside is strong enough to be faintly audible even through the bunker’s concrete walls, the pots and pans hanging overhead in the kitchen shuddering with the force of it as Dean pours himself a shot of bourbon and then another. It goes down smooth—he’s too old for rot-gut, and he finds it’s easier to take his time with the nicer stuff. He’d left Sam behind in the TV Room, telling him he needed a minute, and it’s true. He needs more than a goddamn minute.
Cas lifts his face to Dean’s, mouth dark and hair insane, his voice a dark growl when he says, “Obviously. Can I continue now?”
“I meant a bit more big-picture than that. Things seemed different between you two, on the drive from Buffalo. Lighter, maybe.”
“I don’t have ‘a ton of shit’ that would be preferable to spending time with you. Not a single shit, in fact.”
“Bought it back a couple years back, when Jack was sick,” Dean says, looking at the floor. “Stupid, I know that. Wasn’t gonna help anything.”
“Alright then. Telepathy. I occasionally miss the ability to read minds. It had a way of smoothing over complicated social interactions.”
“Nevermind,” Cas backtracks. “In that case, there is a U-Haul less than a mile away. You can drop me off there and follow behind on the way to Grand Haven.”
Cas taps his shoulder and he startles, just a little. Cas quirks an eyebrow and points at the elevator across the lobby.
Cas slides home, and that’s - that’s entirely new. Dean hooks his legs around Cas’ waist, hands going for the headboard. Cas pulls back slow, a slick drag.
Dean thinks of setting off fireworks with Sam in that empty field when they were kids. Seeing Cas again under that streetlight when he thought he’d finally lost him for good. Charlie and Eileen. Jody, Donna, and the girls. Bobby. But those are people, not memories.
Cas feels the blood drain from his face, his hands are shaking, he’s somehow both hot and freezing cold in equal measure.
Cas turns around. A woman is there, pretty with curly hair, green eyes. Not unlike Dean’s. It takes him off-guard.
Dean tosses Cas the car keys after they pay their tab. It's either a gesture of trust or a medical necessity due to eating the All Star Breakfast past the age of 25. He slumps into his seat and lets out a contented and slightly pained sigh, letting Cas' navigate them out of the packed parking lot and back onto the interstate.
Dean doesn't point out that the area's only police presence consists solely of one Carl Baxter, the recently divorced county sheriff. Dean lets Carl beat him in pool at the Lebanon Tavern three nights a week out of sheer pity, so something tells Dean that he's not patrolling this stretch of Rural Route 11 tonight.
by it, the motion repeating as Dean’s hips find a rhythm that Cas matches. The term for this act doesn’t match how good it feels, human and inelegant and fantastic. The room is completely silent other than the sound of their breathing.
“As long as it’s not any of that CSI, Law and Order bullshit,” Dean says, leaving the ultimate choice up to Cas. “I fuckin’ hate cop shows.”
"Dude, come on,” Dean says, fucking himself on Cas’ hand and knowing it’s begging, not caring at all. “I've been ready for
Sam takes him jogging the day after he and Eileen get back. Just once, because Cas finds that Dean is right and jogging is miserable, but still. It’s the thought that counts. Yoga with Eileen is much preferable, made all the more so when one morning he finds a new cushioned mat leaning against his door, a receipt in the bag from the sporting goods store in Hastings. Dean waves him off when he tries to thank him, insisting that it’s nothing. It’s not nothing.
A glass of water in the kitchen, a quick trip to the small bathroom next to the gym, and he heads for his room. The light flickers on with a faint buzz, casting the room in shadows. He hasn’t spent much time here over the years. There was never a need to, before. When he’s stayed overnight in the past, he’s whiled away the hours the Winchesters were sleeping in the library, or later on, in Dean’s movie room.
Dean. If anyone were to devise a way to retrieve him from that most unretrievable space, it would be Dean. His heart seizes in his chest at that thought, paralyzed at the idea of what Dean might have traded away. He has just enough of his celestial self to sense that Dean is still on this plane of existence. It might be that that is in fact all that’s left of his grace, if the very human emptiness in his stomach and sweat on his back are anything to go by. He needs to find a phone. And humans, he’s found, are more receptive to requests when the asker is clothed. So, clothes first.
“Alright, you’re right, Dad should’ve taken us to the beach. So with your last year on Earth, that’s what you’d want to do?”
by being more careful with his life. And yeah, that's the goal. That’s the whole point. Because if he doesn’t, then all that loss, all that unbelievable stuff Cas said to him, it’ll have been for nothing.
“Cas, man, you there?” he hears Dean call from down the hall some time later, just as he is depositing the last of the rubbish into one of the bunker’s many mysterious trash chutes that seemingly empty straight down into the earth. He had hoped to mop next, but it can wait. At least the worst of the evidence of that night is gone. He hurries out the door to meet Dean, hoping to cut him off before he sees - too late.
“Sure. Cas, you’ve gotta stop talking about what you did to upgrade my, what was it, mortifying flesh? What, you make my dick bigger too?”
All that gets him is Cas removing his finger entirely before sucking Dean’s dick into his mouth with enough hot pressure to have Dean arching off the bed.
, they’re so fucking stupid. He hauls himself up to his elbows, getting a glorious view of Cas’ mouth working around him.
Next, Dean swaps Cas’ busted up garden trowel out for one with a lifetime warranty. He justifies the price tag by telling himself the forged steel could double as a weapon against Celtic fairies, should any ever find their way to central Kansas.
It feels more real now, having told someone. Dean feels...not exactly better, but different. More solid, somehow. The rest of the day passes in a blur as he thinks about how not-surprised Claire was. Does everybody know? Is he that transparent? Did his dad know that he was...whatever he is? Does Sam? There’s gotta be something about him that gives it away.
Dean laughs, sharp and surprised, and the tension breaks. Cas is joking about how long his desperate ass has been pining after him and he’s laughing, because it’s
Dean’s face is tucked against his neck, Dean’s arms bracketing his head as they move together. Cas keeps a hand in Dean’s hair, the other running over his back to both soothe and incite. He’s drunk on the feel of his own skin, how much more awake he feels. As a human, he might not be able to monitor the dilation of his pupils and the exact speed at which his heart beats, but he doesn’t need angelic grace to spell out the effect Dean is having on him.
“The sacred pact?” Dean asks, spearing a chunk of perfectly cooked Eggs Benedict into his mouth, not laughing, definitely not smiling around his fork and loving Cas for all that he is.
“I stepped on a squash vine the other day and then got stung by a weirdly territorial honeybee. Does that count?”
They swing by a nearby tire shop before pulling in behind the Impala on a backroad in Linndale. Cas follows as Dean digs around in the trunk and returns with a jack and a lug wrench.
It’s Cas’ turn to position himself between his knees, and he presses a row of kisses into the soft skin of his belly until Dean settles, relaxing. Cas flips the cap of the bottle, pouring a small amount into his hand and rubbing it between his fingers.
When he looks up, he gets the joy of seeing Sam’s expression shift from worry to something closer to pity. He’s seen that look enough times to know it well.
He’s taken off guard when Cas kisses him. He feels the echo of the kiss through the connection, and that’s...wow. That’s worth investigating further. But first, he shows Cas more, shows him everything.
"The book of Numbers might be a little dry," Cas says, "But I am certain that were I to quote from another book and speak of the taste of your fruit,” he presses an open-mouthed kiss to the junction of groin and thigh. “And your sweet wine, flowing past lips and tongue,” Cas says, a too-brief, sucking kiss to the head of Dean’s cock. “You might feel differently about the Good Book’s erotic potential.”
Ain’t that the truth. Pants out of the way, Cas straddles his legs and pulls him up until they’re chest to chest, Cas’ arms looped around his back. Everything is skin against skin, and that’s Cas’ dick against his,
“Talk about world-saving,” Dean says, marveling. How had he never thought of that common thread before? He pulls out his phone and scrolls down to where they left off on the list. They’ve got the whole afternoon to kill before picking up their misplaced monster this evening. “Alright, next up. ‘What do you value most in a friendship?’”
“Okay, buddy. See you soon,” Dean says, like it’s normal, everything is normal between them, nothing has changed.
“I mean, yeah?” Dean asks, confused. “Wait, you wouldn’t? We don’t have to, it was just an idea, I’m fine with -”
“I apologize if the fact of our cohabitation embarrasses you,” Cas says. “I’m aware of your discomfort when a stranger mistakes your sexual preferences.”
“A lot of things, I don’t know. A decade’s worth of things. Not really short on ideas,” Dean says, babbling. The understatement of the year. “But can you - I just wanna not think, for a bit. So maybe, uh, help me stop thinking.”
“You were going somewhere tonight? There’s a tornado warning, dude. Multiple funnel clouds spotted nearby. We’re all good here, obviously, but you probably shouldn’t—”
“Getting to that,” Dean says, holding up a hand in a plea for a goddamn fucking second. Eileen keeps rubbing his back, and he’d shrug it off except it feels like the only thing keeping him upright.
“No, I can do it. I’m Dean fuckin’ Winchester, I’ve killed Hitler, I can talk about - talk about...love and affection.”
He shrugs, takes a long drink, and hands the bottle back to Cas before sitting down on the edge of the mattress to work off his shoes.
“It was a confusing evening, to say the least. But not a bad one, because I made you laugh. That’s when I realized what it was to want something. And I did, want you.” Dean smiles. “I still do. Especially when you’re laughing.”
"Just. Don't quit on me. That's all I'm saying. It's - what you want - it isn't a lost cause. I mean, you definitely should quit on me, but uh. That shouldn't be why. It shouldn't be because you think you know something about me that you don't."
Dean's hands twist on the steering wheel, and he blinks a couple quick times. It's goddamn dusty out here in the country.
“Sure.” Dean roots in the bag beside him, handing Cas a shirt at random and feeling vaguely light-headed.
“Yeah. Uh, skivvies will work, right?” Dean says, eyeing his own jeans and weather-inappropriate flannel. “Don’t exactly have any board shorts in the trunk.”
Cas takes his hand and tugs him down, aiming his flashlight at the bushes which are full-to-bursting with perfectly ripe berries.
“First things first, we’ve gotta go get my fuckin’ car,” Dean says, his arm propped up on the bench seat behind Cas’ head as he reverses out of the parking spot. The sleeve of his jacket brushes against Cas’ hair, and Cas doesn’t move, lets it happen. “I can’t drive this piece of shit another thousand miles. And Baby doesn’t deserve to get her rims stolen.”
"I don't have a social security number, so I don't think it will be an issue. And I promise not to report you to the IRS."
“And you know what? That isn’t even the only time it’s gotten that bad,” Dean says with a mirthless laugh. “Nearly fucking drowned myself in whiskey when you died the first time. Or, I guess it was the third time? Hard to keep track. The one with the Leviathans, the lake. Didn’t stop drinking until you came back. I was a shit hunter that year, even more of a shit brother. Could’ve gotten me and Sam killed and probably would have if it wasn’t for Bobby pulling my ass out of the fire.”
the ocean, for starters. Cas thanks the woman, ducking around the side of the booth to place a call with shaking hands.
“They’re not automatons anymore. Perhaps something about reliving your deepest regrets on the Empty’s interminable loop encourages self-reflection.”
“Nothing of value to anyone except for me,” Cas says, unfolding a paper napkin and smoothing it across his lap like someone taught him table manners between one apocalypse and another.
Dean starts in on the buttons of his own shirt, watching Cas watch him. He doesn’t make it a show, because this isn’t a performance. Even so, Cas’ gaze is like the barely-contained heat radiating from behind a closed oven door. The process of taking off the rest is as awkward as it always is, because there’s just no sexy way to take off socks. Cas still gives him flatteringly dumbfounded elevator eyes when he stands in front of him wearing just the skin he was born in.
“Yes, everything is fine. Just, are you awake enough for me to ask you another question? There are only a couple left.”
“Hello, Sam.” He’s not being avoided, he’s not. Dean’s probably just driving, and being safe. That’s good - that’s ideal. He will always want Dean safe. It’s just, he’d also like to hear his voice.
Offering up his sincere apologies to the owner of the shed, he selects a rock from the ground and breaks a pane of glass closest to the door, close enough that he can work his arm inside and twist the lock. The door swings open on rusty hinges, and Cas steps carefully around the broken glass to retrieve his prize - a pair of muck boots two sizes too large, a rough-knit sweater, and a couple pairs of jeans. He pulls the sweater on over his head, immediately cutting down on the shivers running through him. The pants are more of a challenge, gaping at the waist. He roots around until he finds a thin cord that can serve as an impromptu belt. Clicking shut the shed door, he reaches back through the broken window and re-locks the handle, out of nonsensical politeness.
“Please enjoy your sensual encounter with a pastry while I answer at more length,” Cas says, mocking and fond.
He’s fucked Cas through three or four orgasms at this point. Whenever he thinks he can’t take it anymore, he gets a shivering line of grace up his spine, and he’s back.
“They’re - they’re kind of pretty. If they were a little bigger, they sort of look like something that might try to eat me in purgatory.”
“Okay, next question,” Dean says. ‘When did you last sing to yourself, or to someone else?’ Alright, an easy one. I’ll go first. I sing to myself every day in the shower because I’m a red-blooded American. What about you?”
“That’s bullshit,” Dean says, brow furrowing. “It’s just a car, it’s not more important than -” he trails off.
good he is at fucking him. Cas laughs softly, and it’s all kindness. Dean watches him slick himself up, using his free hand to maneuver the backs of Dean’s thighs up toward his chest and sliding his cock between them.
“Yeah.” (Is he, though?) “Okay, the thing that’s important for you to know. Man, you know everything already.”
Dean steps away and shucks out of his overshirt. There are forearms on display now, and Dean might as well be fully naked for all that that arouses in him. But a question floats to the surface of his mind, the first clear thought in a while.
means a dimly lit motel room, he and Cas sitting across from each other at an undersized dinette, spilling all their secrets.
“Nah, it’s fine. We don’t need it,” Dean says, stuffing his hands in his pockets. Sure would be handy for movie nights though.
Things have started following a pattern around here - caffeine first, words a distant second. At least, for everyone but Sam, who swears by the mystical powers of exercise. Fuck that. The six feet of former angel presently wrapped around him needs chemical assistance.
The closest place where they can get behind a door with a lock is a Holiday Inn Express just across the river, next to the marina.
Dean lifts his hips and crawls off. There’s no way to do it gracefully, but Cas is too far gone to care. His knees wobble when he stands at the foot of the bed, bracing himself with a hand on the footboard for a beat while he tries to focus on the task at hand. Gauging how much slack to add to the line is hard as hell when Cas’ cock is
“How I feel about you—it’s something I’ve been keeping to myself for a long time. I’ve had a chance to give it a lot of thought.”
Then there's a cool, wet fingertip tracing at the skin behind his balls, circling lower until Dean's getting some real ideas for what they might do next time.
Over wings and a couple local beers that Dean would scoff at for being pretentious if they weren’t so damn good, they get back to the list.
“‘Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life,’” Cas recites, that familiar question-asking cadence in his voice. Dean’s almost gotten used to this by now.
Not enough time to make it back to the safety of the bunker’s garage, and Dean doesn’t trust Smith County Public Works’ maintenance of the gravel road between here and home in a storm anyway. He’s too old to pull his car out of a ditch, and Baby deserves better.
