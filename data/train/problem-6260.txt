“Do you hear yourself?” Steve asks, raising his voice to an authoritative level. “We’re winning this game, Tony.”
Tony shoots him a glare before apologizing to the nurse who just offers an understanding smile and finishes tending to his IV.
“Our team,” Steve corrects. “And I think I need to thank you as much as anyone else. I know I don’t need to tell you this, but you bring a lot to the team. I can’t imagine we’d make it to this point without you.”
The next thing Steve knows, Vision's bat has already swung through nothing but air, and the baseball is snug in their coach’s mitt. Everyone stares at Natasha, who looks just as surprised, before turning their heads to look at Tony. Steve can see a barely-there hint of a smile as he made a motion for the next player to step up. "Let's not waste any more time, boys. I don't plan on being here any longer than originally scheduled."
"The kid needs an attitude adjustment," one anchor insists. His counterpart seems less perturbed by Tony's behavior.
“You can’t come out,” he says simply, turning his eyes back onto Steve’s face. He opens his mouth to argue, but Tony holds up a hand. “I know what you’re going to say, and I understand, but I don’t want you to. This will pass. It’s not worth both of us being miserable. I just have a gut feeling that it’s going to get so much worse if you come out too.” He reaches up to touch Steve’s face, cradling his cheek gently against his palm. “You sacrifice so much for me and everyone else. It’s not always your weight to bear, okay? Let me do this for you.”
That particular dilemma is pushed off as Tony slides out of reach, dropping to his knees on the floor. He grabs Steve by the back of the calves and drags him forward slightly, nudging his legs open so he can reach up and undo his pants. Steve lifts his hips up, helping Tony slide them off along with his underwear. The relief of no longer being constricted and not having to worry about coming in his pants like a teenager intermingles with the sudden realization that he’s fully exposed in front of Tony.
It’s only two days later when the story breaks. Back in D.C., after their last week and a half of travel, Tony wakes up to dozens of missed calls and pages, and a pounding on his front door.
He can see the white of Tony’s teeth as he grins at him. “But fucking you in a broom closet sounds so much more appealing.”
“Now, Tony,” the interviewer directs his attention again. “Is there anything else you’d like to say about today’s game before we cut to inside the Stadium where the players are getting ready for the big game?”
Steve wanders around in the house, peeking into unlocked doors to find unoccupied bedrooms or bathrooms, trying to find a good candidate for their little tryst. He sneaks upstairs, listening for wedding guests passing by who all seem to be on the first floor, not wandering far from the ballroom where the reception is being held. He hears the sound of hasted footsteps and a door closing from a few feet away, quickly following the sound.
Tony doesn’t risk turning on the TV until he knows the game is over. He raids the fridge and settles on a fifth of Bourbon to drink from while he proofreads the eighth draft of his thesis he's been working on, marking it up with a red pen while he scans the pages. His cell phone rings a few times, but Tony ignores it.
Steve hopes Tony doesn’t think poorly of him because of it, but he has to laugh. “Why don’t I drop you off at home?”
Tony's gaze flickers and he clears his throat as he pulls the toothbrush out of his mouth. "Um, the left window in that room... It sticks." He shoves the toothbrush back into his mouth. "Thought you should know."
It’s almost midnight and Steve is just about to head out to blindly comb the streets for any sign of his boyfriend when his phone rings. He practically crushes the device in his hand from picking it up and slamming the answer button with such force. “Tony?”
The Triple-A is made up of a mix of up and coming youngsters as well as rehabilitating players who aren't quite ready to step foot in the majors again, but are cleared to play. It'ss certainly less strain and pressure than Major League play with a lesser number of games and a generally more lax season. The attention is divided between media wanting to keep an eye on the fresh newbies right on the cusp of breaking out in the Majors, as well as constantly wondering when their favorite MLB veterans might grace the league once again.
“I’m not,” he continues to insist, his own humor fading as he fixes his gaze on Tony. “I know when to stop, and now’s not the time. We
"Rogers!" Everyone cheers as he bashfully comes through the door, squeezing past the mingling groups. He can see Bucky waving him over to the bar, holding up a shot glass.
He groans and drags himself into a sitting position, licking his lips as he eyes up their Lucky Blue Dragon order. “Alright, but first thing’s first, did I leave my—”
Whitaker’s writing furiously on his clipboard, the cap of the pen clenched between his teeth. “All I saw was a whole lot of showboatin’ out there, and that’s not what’s gonna win this game. But, hey, you seem to like negotiating ultimatums, so how’s this? You prevent
,” his coach barks, giving him a shove back towards the bases. “Let the doctors handle Barnes!” he jogs to catch up with Bucky and the medics, putting a hand on the player’s back as they disappear into the stadium.
“Stop being a baby and just sit still,” she chastises in annoyance, gently grabbing the uninjured side of his face again to angle him back towards her. “It’s almost clean, then we can bandage it.”
Even after Tony speaks, it takes Peter a moment to get his bearings. His eyes suddenly snap to the ground as if he’s finally realizing how long he’s been gaping at him. “M-Mister Stark, it’s an- an honor to finally meet you!” He squeaks out, a bright flush to his cheeks as he continues to address Tony while staring at his beat up high tops with crooked laces. “I’m a big fan-- Sorry, I’m sure you hear that all the time,” he winces inwardly at himself and Steve gives him an encouraging pat on the back.
“It took him long enough but… yeah, he did. I could tell he was stirred up about someone for a while, but he always avoided giving me any details. We’ve been best friends for a long time, I always know when he fancies someone but… It’s never been this intense. He seemed real sick over it for months before I finally got him to spill.”
“What do you mean?” Bucky’s frowning at him not in confusion, but in frustration. “You never slack during practice, don’t start on my account.”
“There’s my little guy,” Steve grins, Natasha passing the baby carefully into his arms. He still feels so
Steve leans forward as well. No one is sitting close enough to hear, but he’s glad Tony feels safe enough to finally talk about it in an open space. “I’m not trying to label you, Tony, I’m just trying to understand.”
“It was really good to see you again, Steve,” she says, smiling warmly up at him. “I apologize it’s been so long… I know you didn’t leave the Stars on the best terms… I realize I never apologized for how things ended,” she sighs, eyes softening. “I am truly sorry. I could see how unhappy you were after Barnes retired, but I’m glad that didn’t stop you completely.”
The last bets are placed and Tony can hear the ivory pill rocket its way around the spinning wheel, bouncing this way and that before it begins to settle. He can feel the telltale lurch in the room of everyone scanning the wheel as the velocity of it begins to slow, the blur of reds and blacks becoming clearer and clearer until the viewers can see exactly where it lands. Tony is about four gin and tonics, seven cherry vodkas, and one Long Island iced tea deep by now, something telling him that even if he was looking at the wheel, those colors would still be blurring even after it had come to a stop.
The other man is right, but Steve still didn’t feel right berating one of his players when they weren’t doing well. He adjusts his critiquing methods to the players, but Tony was unlike anyone Steve had ever played with. “His parents just died, I was trying to go easy on him…”
“Look at you, kid!” The coach burst, exasperated. “You burnt yourself out with that last inning. If you think I’m gonna keep a tired player like you in for any longer, you’re nuts.”
of the team. You’re good at leading people, at making decisions. You’ve got a natural talent of knowing how to be exactly what people want and what they need. You’re the most competent person for the job, even if you don’t realize it yet. And if you wanted, I can stay on for the first year with you just to show you the ropes and be there to help. Honestly, I don’t think you’d even need it, but if having a little extra insurance will make you say yes…”
Thank you guys so much for continuing reading and leaving such nice comments. 💕 See you guys with chapter 5 in 2-3 weeks! (Hopefully!!!)
“He’s just anxious like the rest of us,” Steve answers tensely, effectively ending that conversation. The truth is, Steve doesn’t know exactly what Bucky’s “deal” is. His bad elbow had been a sensitive talking point since as long as they had played baseball together, and while Steve knew his best friend to be unreasonably stubborn at times, he had to put faith in him and pray that Bucky knew his own body better than anyone else.
the man in his arms. Steve’s hands slide reassuringly into his hair, fingers curling against his neck, holding him steadfast.
“I know!” Peter then burst excitedly, immediately shrinking back in embarrassment. He rubs a hand through his mop of brown hair. “The All-Star Game in ‘89. The PCL won.”
The aftershocks of a panic attack always leave Tony’s mind a little fuzzy. It’s been years since he’s had one— he almost forgot about the inhaler Pepper insists he keep with him just in case it happens again. He remembers Steve finding it once, reminiscing on when he had one because of the terrible asthma attacks he suffered from as a child. Tony had brushed it off like he dealt with the same thing— The air was worse in some overseas countries, so he had been given one by doctors whenever he traveled. He was too embarrassed to tell him the truth. Howard had always called his little “episodes” a cry for attention from a weak-minded little boy. He scoffed at the fact Maria entertained their son with the idea that he couldn't just buck up and be more of a man when anxiety-inducing situations piled up around him, separating him from the rest of reality.
Tony barely lifts up the pillow to peak out from under it, squinting harshly into the light of the room. “Mph… Timeizzit?”
“I had to, Steve,” Tony tries to reason with him, stepping closer. Steve shrinks against the wall, halting Tony in his tracks. “We needed to end things before they could get any worse—”
His head starts to throb the more he thinks about it, so Tony pushes away the past and surveys the room the best he can with his mind still sufficiently addled. There’s no one else in the room with him, but there’s evidence on the counter and across the armchairs in the room that suggest regular visitors. There are blinds drawn over the window on the interior wall, but he can see through the slats to the dimly lit and quiet hospital wing. There’s a single nurse behind a counter, doing her best to work through the night shift. He watches her turn to face someone out of view, smiling and giving a polite nod.
Peggy sighs through her nose. "Shut that door behind you," she says quietly before sinking into her chair. "Sit down." Steve follows her instruction. They stare each other down for a few moments before Peggy speaks again. "Barnes. What about him?"
Steve and Bucky practice their throws together, both at a standstill and moving. It’s surreal, thinking how this isn’t all that different from twenty years ago when it was just the two of them and a ball.
They share a smile just as Dove comes back with their food. She doesn’t engage in conversation, Tony immediately digging into his full breakfast platter. Steve just went with an omelets and French toast while Tony had an array of sausages, pancakes topped with berries, scrambled eggs, and hash browns to choose from.
“You’re home,” Steve replies unhelpfully, brows still drawn up in confusion, briefly wondering if Tony has somehow rigged some kind of technological device so that he can remotely answer his home phone from hundreds of miles away.
“Not that much,” Steve backtracks, but doesn’t fight it as Tony grabs his hands and drags him out of his chair.
“Damn, Rogers, retirement treating you well?” Carol calls out to him with a grin, rubbing a hand over her chin. “This is new. How long have you been growing that out?”
The most daring thing he’s managed so far is inviting Tony into the shower with him after a morning workout where he sidles up behind him, and reaches around to pull him off. Each experience has been steamier than the last, this one both figuratively
Isaiah throws the first pitch, his arm like a cannon. Steve will always be in awe of his captain’s throw, much like everyone else in the league. Isaiah Bradley is one of the oldest players still in the major league, rumors of his retirement constantly swirling as he nears 50 years of age. Steve has only been playing with Isaiah for a season now, but he can’t imagine not having the man as his Captain and confidant.
. Of course, no one looked at him twice before his growth spurt that came well into his baseball career, his muscles finally developing and some of the awkward features on his face balancing themselves out as he aged. Steve strikes a naturally imposing figure, but Tony doesn’t seem to care about any of those norms, easily taking control and guiding Steve along for the ride.
The balcony is freezing this high up, a light dusting of snow still clinging to the railing and the concrete outside. He has a throw blanket from inside wrapped around him, but it does little to protect him from the cold. He does his best to try and shield his lighter as he attempts to light the end of his cigarette, but the blistering winds continually put the flame out.
After one long inhale and exhale, Steve looks back to the reporter. "Honestly, I didn't know people liked me that much," he chuckles, bashfully rubbing the back of his neck. "It's humbling to even hear that I'm a fan favorite to people. I try to keep integrity in the game and do my part to help the team first and foremost. I think people can just relate to the steps I've taken to get where I am today. There's sometimes dirty or corrupt players in the sport; I'm just trying to keep things honest."
Gabe turns to Jaques sheepishly to let him reloop his tie. Steve double checks his own appearance, making sure nothing is amiss. He's never done a press event before. There's been the occasional short interview before games, but this is a much bigger deal.
Pierce seems unphased by Tony’s crass attitude. He neatly folds the crisp piece of paper in half and sets it down on Janet’s desk. “You might not be, but I believe your team is. Obviously there is nothing left for us to say to try and convince you so I won’t waste my breath.” He makes a signal with his hand and Coulson and Hill stand as well. “It was a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Stark.”
Steve has to shake himself out of it, still holding onto Bucky’s arm. He drops his hand away, nodding. “Yeah, sorry. That was… that was a lot." There's a tightness in his chest that's beginning to alleviate now that Bucky is standing in front of him, Steve now feeling a little ridiculous for freaking out. He's used to the crowds by now, and he certainly knows what to expect coming off a momentous win like that, but he had just felt so lost.
,” She chastises, dragging his name out in that way she always did. “This is going to be a PR nightmare. Can’t you just play nice for this one game? All you have to do is go back out there and sit on the bench and look supportive for the rest of the team. We can spin it that you were just frustrated about an injury or something— You needed to get some air.” Tony keeps walking forward, ignoring his manager. “Listen, I know maybe the game didn’t go how you wanted it to, but you had an amazing three innings! There are going to be a ton of reporters wanting to interview you, and there’s the dinner after the game with
“Jerk,” Tony says fondly, nudging him with his elbow. He finishes lacing up his shoes and immediately climbs up on a table to call out the best bowlers among them to challenge them. Tony’s never bowled a day in his life, but something tells Steve that he’s going to be a natural at it.
“We need to go ahead and take him to the hospital,” Dr. Erskine says, putting his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You can come if you get permission from Hodge.”
Tony’s brow furrows. “Why are you thanking me for something you haven’t even used yet?” He waves a hand towards the box. “Go. Go get it. You have to try it out.”
"This is mine, but there's a guest room right down the hall," he jerks his thumb over to another door. When he opens his own bedroom door, Steve just barely gets a glimpse of a white room decorated with accents of burgundy and gold.
, goes the bouncy ball as Tony continues methodically bouncing it off the counter and wall. "I'm surprised you didn't come here asking for an apology— or at least expecting one."
Ty sighs, rakes a hand through his hair. “Management thinks it’s best if you’re dropped down to the 40-Man roster for the rest of your contract.”
“Too slow, Hammer!” Steve calls across the field before tossing the ball back to Tony who can’t fight his smile.
All it takes are some corny lines for the waitress’ affections to shift back to her first object of desire. “I’ll be right back to satisfy your tastes then.”
"Natasha," Steve grabs their coach's attention as she checks to make sure all of their gear gets on the bus. "Where's Tony?"
“Do you want to stop?” Tony asks, Steve’s eyes darting down to his mouth when he sees his tongue swipe across them.
“Wow,” Steve says, unsure why he’s so surprised when he’s seen Tony do much more complicated work. Maybe it’s because whatever he cooked up in his labs were so beyond anything Steve could ever understand, and he couldn’t believe Tony would spend any time, as short as it was, on such a mundane charge. “Thank you. You didn’t have to do that.”
He can see what he thinks is Tony miming a zipper over his mouth in his periphery as he dazedly stumbles his way over to the opposite side of the small room that feels like it’s getting smaller every second. He sinks down into a chair, placing his head in both his hands. His fingers curl into his hair, tightening at the roots before releasing and tightening again. He repeats this motion a few times just to keep the feeling from leaving his fingers, the blindside taking him out of the moment.
Echoing winds howl through the structure of the parking garage, Tony dropping his keys twice before he’s able to get them in the door and get inside. He struggles to get the keys into the ignition, collapsing back into the seat when he finally gets the engine on and the heat going.
The crawl to the top floor is agonizing, Steve shivering slightly as he waits for the doors to open. He walks down the short hallway where Tony’s lone door resides at the end, fist coming up to pound on it heavily. “Tony!” He yells hoarsely. No response. He pounds harder now, hearing the sound reverberate through the apartment on the other side of the heavy door. “Tony, it’s Steve. Please let me in. You shouldn’t be alone right now…
from a teenager, Tony still manages to make him feel as giddy as one. Janet smiles at him sweetly as she passes by him with Tony in tow, tugging him down the rest of the stairs. More footsteps come from above as the rest of their side of the wedding party comes down.
baseball, but here he is showing up early and staying late for practices, insisting just two weeks after his parents died in a horrific accident that he needs to play again… His coping methods clearly aren’t normal,” Rhodes sighs, staring out alongside Steve as they watch Tony pitch to the next player. There’s still something off, his posture much more stiff than usual, his decisions seeming erratic, but he manages to strike them out. Something about what Rhodey said to him must be getting through one way or another. “I know you have a soft spot for him, but what he needs right now is a reality check from his friends, not coddling from his teammates.”
“Well…” he can hear the struggle in Steve’s voice of him trying to find the bright side for Tony who wears a permanent pair of sunglasses. “Your first league game is tomorrow right? That’s exciting! And it’s in New York!”
An impatient whine rumbles in the back of Tony’s throat at Steve slowing the momentum, anxious hands removing Steve of his suit jacket and immediately flying to the rest of the buttons. “We should- make this- quick-” Tony mumbles between kisses. “Someone- will notice- we’re gone-”
“Ah,” Steve nods and continues to eat. He’s looking imploringly at Tony in such an honest matter that he wants to shrink under the weight of his gaze. He can’t stand to look at Steve right now, eyes falling back to his plate. “I think you should sign.”
“Not me, Cap, this is all you,” he slings an arm around Steve’s shoulders, bringing him closer. The height difference is a little less pronounced with Tony sitting on a raised barstool and Steve standing, but he still has to duck down a little to allow the friendly action. “This is because of The Avengers,
Steve pushes his way through the crowd, wildly searching for Tony’s familiar dark head of hair in the chaos. He’s numb to the congratulations shouted at him and the pats on the back, honed in on a single target now.
catching him eyeing me up in the showers,” He shudders dramatically. “But no one can fault you— Even a wholesome, devout Catholic man like yourself must’ve found it impossible to resist a pretty little fairy like that constantly coming at you,
It hardly counts considering they’re both in the outfield, right and left wing. Steve knows Natasha’s trying to move Tony around and feel out how he does in every position, but it’s clear the outfield is not a good fit for him. As proficient of a player as he is, Tony shines more with accuracy and prioritization in strategy. Being a fielder is a more static position, meant to be support. It’s not much of a surprise that Tony gets subbed out pretty early on, not having the arm strength to be able to get the ball all the way into the infield without needing to use their center as a middle man. There’s only a single inning of crossover between them with basically no interaction considering there’s rarely a reason for passes to be made between their positions.
Once Tony's skin is free of any oil stains and he no longer smells like the floor of an auto shop, he towel-dries his hair and quickly dresses himself. As he's tying his oxfords he hears Pepper honking the horn incessantly from outside. "I'm coming!" Tony yells as he takes the stairs two at a time, flying out the front door to hop into the back of the BMW.
Tony seems perturbed yet pleased by Steve’s response, a rueful smile crossing his face for a moment before quickly fading. “Did you cry? At your mother’s funeral?”
Inclement weather cancels their first two games of the season, pushing them over into the second week of April. It’s a home game, the field still moist from that morning’s downpour, but the sun’s rays begin to peek through the distant storm clouds, and it looks like they’ll finally be starting the season.
The two companions eat in silence, Steve looking out over the city. He can see most of east Brooklyn from their seventh floor apartment. If he squints hard enough, he can even see the clump of old, deteriorating buildings that was once the block he had grown up on. Nostalgic thoughts of his mom start to set in, and it becomes harder to swallow each bite of his sandwich.
Carol echoes his sigh, tucking her short hair beneath her cap and slapping Steve on the arm. “We better just get out there then. Can’t keep the new blood waiting.”
Steve closes the folder and Tony allows him to toss it onto the bedside table. He reaches over him to turn off the lamp and slips Tony’s glasses off his face, setting them down on his nightstand. “There’s nothing wrong with a bit of luck and chance in baseball,” he muses quietly as Tony finally lays down, snuggling back against him.
Tony’s bouncing slightly on his feet, shifting his weight back and forth as he edges further and further off of second base. Steve immediately recognizes the look on his face and stares down his teammate, almost willing him to look over at him.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “What am I supposedly overcompensating for? It’s a crime to flirt now?”
Steve sticks around a bit longer and helps Natasha clean up the slight mess they’ve made of her apartment. As he helps her tidy up and wash dishes, he notices a packed bag near her bed. “Going somewhere?” He asks curiously. Natasha stays very quiet in regards to her private life, but over the years Steve had at least learned that she doesn’t have any living relatives to speak of, and doesn’t ever mention friends or contacts outside of the baseball community.
Her expression is pained but serious. She’s clearly had to deliver this same speech before. “I understand your worry and frustration, but like I said, policy clearly states that only relatives or a spouse may—”
Steve smiles to himself in the en suite bathroom, finishing combing his hair into place as he listens to his old friends fuss at each other a room away. He stares at his reflection, his reflection staring back. There’s something about wearing a tailored tuxedo that calls for examining the rest of him, leaning closer as he pokes around the skin of his face. The lines around his nose and eyes that used to disappear when he wasn’t smiling now stubbornly remaining put, as subtle as the creases are. He’s kept in shape, thankfully, still filling out the fitted suit in a way that doesn’t make him feel self-conscious. He looks old, but still has a youthful glow about him when he thinks about what he’s here for. His excitement is fitting for the occasion.
Natasha looks beautiful in her wedding dress. She’s always been the type of woman that looked stunning even covered in sweat and dirt, hair matted and tucked underneath a baseball cap. Seeing her now, wearing a bit of makeup, fiery locks curled into perfect waves that go mid-way down her back, wearing an elegant and simple white dress with lace sleeves and a long train— She’s stunning. There’s no other word for it.
Bucky gives an unhelpful grunt of acknowledgement and seems to mull it over for a few moments. “Major league. That’s a pretty big deal.”
“Did you face them?” Steve asks after the silence stretches on and the door remains locked. Tony stares at him with uncertainty, the two of them finally able to look at each other in this moment of impasse. “Your demons.”
reason we’re up by four.” He seizes Tony by the front of his jersey now, arm flexing as he gives him a forceful shake. “I get it. Back home, you’re used to everyone singing their praises and kissing the grass you walk on. But look around—
Steve can’t help but laugh, his hand coming down on Tony's shoulder much to the shorter man's surprise. "Can't wait."
Steve quickly gets to his feet, realizing they are indeed the last two left on the bus, probably for some time now. He apologizes to the driver on their way off, just earning a slow nod and a “have a good evening”.
Snowballs stop coming from Team Steve’s side of the fort, Tony popping his head up cautiously. “You guys ready to wave that white flag or what?” He called over the empty space.
Steve places a hand on his thigh and Tony shoves his arm away, getting to his feet. He ignores the ache in his chest and paces halfway across the room, needing to put the distance between them. Steve stands as well but doesn’t attempt to come any closer. “Tony… We shouldn’t have to be ashamed anymore. I know you didn’t want me to come out because you were scared for what it meant for both of us—”
"Don't give me that crap, Peg!" Steve interrupts, biting down on his lip after his outburst. "Please— Just— I don't understand."
The styrofoam cup hits the ground, hot liquid splashing along his shoes and the floor. “Tony,” he breaths out, stumbling forward. He catches himself on the edge of the bed, seeming to struggle between wanting to throw his arms around Tony but also needing to be careful because of his wounds. Tony raises his good arm to him and pulls him closer by the shirt, pressing their foreheads together.
They sit in silence for a while. Steve isn't sure what to say to a woman he hardly knows who's clearly been crying.
“I don’t need an answer right away,” Janet says. “The Avengers can’t get rid of me that quickly. I’ve got plenty loose ends to tie up, but I’d definitely feel like everything is a lot more secure if I can place my team in the hands of someone I know I can trust.” She smiles at him, squeezing his hand once more. “I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t believe you could do it. You know that.”
He doesn't pitch every game, either. Carol seems to favor him for a good number of innings when he is slated for that position, which had been his only reservation coming in. The reason the All-Star Games frustrated him so much was because there were more people vying for his position, and plenty of directions that coaches can go in. The Knights are the same in that regard, which makes it all the more important that Tony proves he deserves to be here. He can’t slip up now and let everyone’s efforts to get him here go to waste. He may not be able to pitch an entire game like he could with the Avengers, but Carol finds other ways to make him useful.
Tony takes the steps two at a time, opening up one of the two massive front doors, gesturing for Steve to step inside. Steve walks hesitantly into the foyer, struggling to keep his jaw from dropping to the shining marble floor. He’s greeted right away by a chandelier as large as his childhood bedroom and a grand staircase curving upwards towards the second floor.
“There’s no fucking way I’m going back, Pep,” Tony barks angrily, thrusting the jersey into her hands so they can auction it off at some charity event.
Irritation flickers across Tony’s face. He figures this conversation is over with, but evidently, Steve has other plans. “Basically. I haven’t actually gotten any kind of formal contract to sign but I told Janet and Pierce I want nothing to do with it.”
has known who he was since he started. "Your career, man, wow," Howard shakes his head. "You really climbed those ranks, rags to riches style! Three years in the rookies, one in Class A before you got signed to the Advanced league in the bat of an eyelash—at 19 no less—’79 you started playing for New Hampshire in the double-As—I was even there for a couple of the Eastern League games. Unfortunately, I was in Tijuana for business during the playoffs when you had that amazing short stop maneuver…”
Honestly, Tony doesn't see what is so special about the guy. His father's voice is echoing in his head,
Her arms are crossed, expression unimpressed at his cluelessness. “Coulson and Hill track your every move, Stark. Did you really think I wouldn’t find out?”
Tony is partnered with Rhodey for their running and catching drills, and Steve is definitely distracted as he watches how Tony throws and catches balls on the move. His dark eyes are like lighting, darting around from the ball in Rhodey's glove, to the sky between them, to the arc of Rhodey's arm, to the ball up in the air, back down to where Rhodey's dominant foot lands after his throw. His over-examination doesn’t go unnoticed, earning him a ball to the back of the head, thrown by Natasha instead of his partner Sam.
Tony’s back his pressed against his front, his attention more often than not drifting away from the screen to instead focus on the soft looking skin on the nape of his neck, thinking about how badly he wants to kiss him there— how much he wants to let the arm wrapped around his waist drift lower so he can touch Tony the way he was touched last night…
Tony looks up at him over the rim of his glasses, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Pythagorean Expectation,” he repeats. “It’s a sports analytics formula I would use sometimes after I played for the Avengers for a couple of seasons to compare us to other teams we played against. You can estimate the expected percentage of games a team ‘should’ have won based on how many runs were scored and allowed.”
“Steeeve…” Tony interrupts lowly, slow grin spreading across his face. “You’re not a virgin, are you?”
Tony laughs loudly at him, startling a few nearby couples. He then places his hand back in Steve's, picking up their dance where they left off when he realizes they’re garnering more stares by standing around in the middle of the dancing couples in the ballroom rather than the fact that they both happen to be men. “Yeah fucking right. Me playing for your old team feels a little too full circle, don’t you think? Besides, there’s no way I’d go to the Stars with Peggy still on as the owner. The entire reason I left the Irons is so people would stop calling nepotism on me. Of all the things people shout about me now, I’d rather not add that back to the list.” He rolls his eyes. “Plus, no offense, they’re a little too…” he wrinkles his nose. “
"What are we waiting on?" Steve whispers to Clint as he approaches, watching Natasha pace back and forth in annoyance, checking her watch every minute or so. While Steve is comfortable with Natasha as a coach at this point, he tends to avoid her when she’s in one of these moods. One wrong look and he'll be running suicides until the sun goes down.
Tony draws a finger through the condensation on his third bottle. “No. Well, I guess that’s not true. Pepper knows, but she knows everything about my life. It’s kind of impossible for her not to,” he shrugs. “We don’t talk about it. She’s not my assistant anymore now that I’m in New York, but she’s still the head of my PR department. If it comes up in conversation, she just makes it very clear that it’s something I’m meant to keep—” Tony swallows thickly. “
When he gets home he immediately goes to his phone, fit's dialing Tony’s cell. The line is disconnected, an automated voice telling him the person he's trying to reach is not currently accepting calls. He tries Tony’s home phone. Same issue. He doesn't even have Tony’s email address, otherwise he would go to the library right now and try and contact him that way. He mulls over the idea of trying to send Tony a letter, but realizes that even if Tony’s home to receive it, he’ll probably just laugh at the fact that Steve tried to reach him with such primitive messaging and throw it in the garbage.
Tony follows behind Steve as they drive to their destination. Steve can see the skepticism on his face before they even get out of their respective cars when he sees where he’s taken him. “You know, when you said Italian, I thought we were thinking a little more upscale pasta joint, not a pizza place at an abandoned strip mall.”
His sincerity strikes Steve to his core, feeling that familiar tug deep in his chest that he’s never felt about anyone before Tony, and hasn’t felt about anyone else after. He nods and walks out of the office, starting down the hallway without looking back. He hears Tony’s fading footsteps in the opposite direction. Steve doesn’t go back to the gym, but heads straight for Janet’s office. Maybe he didn’t need as much time to make up his mind as he thought.
"Hey, little guy," Steve greets, giving the tabby kitten a scratch on his head before ripping a piece of ham out of his sandwich and placing it on the metal grate. "Here you go."
Tony searches his face, mouth set in a tight line. “That’s different. It’s because I was back with you guys. But now…” he sighs, staring off at their nearby friends, many of which have retired or moved onto other teams and other leagues. “It’s not the same anymore.”
“I need… to see him…” Steve takes a moment to catch his breath, pushing his wet hair back from his face to prevent anymore droplets from rolling into his eyes. “He’s home though?”
“We turned down every Major League team that put an offer because we knew at the time it wasn’t worth it. Your image was improving, your skill set on our team helped immeasurably, and all around the team was bringing in a lot of good publicity and sponsors. Winning the Championship only further solidified us as a team that can be taken seriously after a long struggle to even hold middle ground…”
Tony finally glances up at Steve, his lips pursing for a second. He pushes his goggles up on the top of his head, and Steve almost prefers this. It feels a little less formal now that he can look Tony in the eye without a scratched up plastic shield in the way. "I know this stuff doesn't matter to you and, frankly, is mostly going over your head. I tend to get a little talky when there's people around my stuff, which is rare. I don't really get the chance to talk about this with anyone since graduating, and no one wants to hear me talk about anything that isn't baseball these days."
“I can’t just sit by and watch everyone turn against you,” he states with finality, jaw clenching. “I don’t care if it ruins my career.”
Tony falls silent. The wood of Natasha’s table creaks slightly as he sinks back down onto it. His hand is twitching, fingers dancing around in agitation. The tick used to make Steve smile, seeing Tony attempting to form words almost tangibly, hands searching out some way to construct them and understand them better. He wants to reach out and hold them, quell their anxiety. He stays put.
His eyes drop away, good humor waning slightly. “Not everyone,” he responds quietly, not even meaning to voice it out loud. He blames the concussion.
“Relax, Steve, I don’t judge. Age is just a number and you two are adults, so it’s none of my business,” Pepper holds her hands up. “All that aside… He tells me how
“See?” Maria’s looking to her husband.“I knew it had to have been the Irons. And you know, I never really liked that Stane. He’s been
Boys from the International League with no stake in the fight manage to separate The Avengers from the fray, Hammer’s teammates doing the same to get Hammer out of reach when they realize they’re outnumbered. “How long did it take—” Hammer screams at Tony’s teammates, arms locked behind him as his cronies struggle to hold his wriggling body back. He’s bleeding heavily from the nose, Tony watching the red spray from his lips with satisfaction. “—For him to drop to his knees and blow every last one of you?!”
Once they’ve booth cooled down, they share a quick shower and collapse onto the second bed in the room that hasn’t been completely ruined with sweat and come. It’s late by the time Tony passes out, curled against Steve with his face tucked into his chest. It feels like he blinks and suddenly it’s early morning, the alarm clock ringing before the sun has even come up. It’s time for Steve to go, and it takes every ounce of self control for Tony not to say fuck it and just go with him.
“We can make it your business if you want," Tony trails off, licking his lips as he steps well into Steve's personal bubble, reaching out with his hand. Steve's muscles twitch as Tony's fingers drag down his abs. "Why don't you drop that towel? You must've been pretty jealous of that valet I had in my bed."
They wait outside of the team buses, having a little alone time for Steve to cool down and finally let himself ride the high of his incredible last home run. Peggy's going to chew him out for not being around for press, but he's sure she'll shove him in front of every camera at every opportunity once things have calmed down.
Natasha gives him a look. "And you don't? I don't think you know Tony as well as you think you do. People who grow up like him have access to that kind of stuff. His life would be too stressful or too boring without it, depending on the day." Steve continues to stand in front of her, worry lines prominent. She sighs. "Tell you what, we still got fifteen minutes before we have to leave. If you can make it quick—"
,” the referee responds vehemently before blowing his whistle again right in Steve’s face. “Now get back in position before I eject all three of you pansies!”
"Tony, I can't tell you how sorry I am. My actions were completely inappropriate and I just want you to know I don't judge you—"
“What are you doing here?” He blurts out. “I-I didn’t realize you were back in town. I figured you would…” His shoulders sag and he steps closer to Tony, a hand outstretched in the space between them without quite touching him yet. “No one would blame you if you need more time, Tony. It’s only been a few weeks—”
"Yes ma'am," Steve rubs his head in apology before turning his attention back to where it belonged: nowhere near Tony Stark.
The next thing he knows, he’s laying on his back in bed, whisky still burning the back of his throat. His head lolls to the side, mind fuzzy as he tries to count the little empty bottles now lined up on the nightstand. It eases the pain somewhat, helps him not think about the worst self-inflicted wound he could add to the already impressive list of injuries.
Steve takes on the role of babysitter for the night, handing every single drink he's given off to Bucky. He knows that his best friend needs it more than he does, and Steve doesn’t want him to feel any edge of bitterness that he couldn’t help the Stars with this history-making win. It just isn't fair, and Bucky is a lot better about not letting that show than Steve is.
Steve scoffs, rolling his eyes up towards the ceiling. “This might be surprising to hear, but breaking up with me and disappearing for a while did
Steve is slotted fourth, the coveted cleanup spot. Bucky is further down the batting lineup, but Steve suspected that was because Hodge has been trying to be careful about his elbow. The pressure is on as Steve watches the three players before him step up to bat. One by one, they each manage a single, and once it's Steve’s turn to step up, he looks out to see loaded bases and a crowd on the edge of their seats.
He’s incredibly proud of Tony for his recovery. At any events like this where most of their friends are drinking and it’s practically
They’re all covering the story. Tony doesn’t look up, but he can hear the snippets of audio as Coulson cruelly channel surfs through the beginnings of his career falling apart.
They win their first game by the skin of their teeth and Steve ends up playing all nine innings. He stays on the field even during his downtime during the batting order, knowing if he tries to speak to Tony now that he’ll only be more distracted once stepping back onto the field. He’s sweaty and covered in mud and grass stains, the damp ground unkind to his white uniform. Despite this, he tries to make his shower quick in the hopes of catching Tony before he leaves, but he never even sees him come through the locker room. It didn’t really make sense for him to do so considering he hadn’t played.
Steve is surprised by this. He had been under the presumption that Howard had to have been aware of Tony’s decision to change teams. “Why the Avengers?” Steve ponders, not sure if he’s just wondering aloud at this point, or he expects the lush to answer him.
Steve has absolutely no idea what Howard would want to keep in touch with him for, and when glancing over to Peggy's arched eyebrow, he’s sure she doesn’t know either. "Great to meet you, it’s been a real honor," Steve replies.
“What else would it be?” She asks ruefully, blinking up at the ceiling to try and stop the flow of tears.
Steve throws another glance over his shoulder, his jaw hard set. It’s a fair pitch, but Tony stands by his point. “Trust me,” he mouths to Steve. If he slips up now because of a little sweat on his brow, then he’s not nearly the player Tony thinks he is.
Pepper is the last to arrive at the party, showing up about an hour or two after everyone has gotten into the swing of things. Tony is overjoyed to see her and Steve is glad she accepted the invitation and was willing to fly across the country just for tonight to see Tony. He knows how much she means to him, and having a little piece of home with him for his birthday is important considering how tough the last year has been on him.
Steve knew around the time that Natasha and Bucky started spending more quality time together, even while they were trying to keep things under wraps, but this specific encounter is news to him. He tries to forget that night, considering it was one of the worst fallouts he and Tony ever had. Thinking about it also brings back the memories of being more worried than he’d ever been over Tony’s well-being, usurped only by the night of Tony's assault a few years later.
He sounds genuinely impressed, and not like he’s just saying it for Steve’s sake. He glows with both embarrassment and pride by the praise, ducking his face into the back of Tony’s neck as he tugs him fully under the showerhead so they can properly rinse off.
Tony’s hand slips out from between his legs as he gets back to his feet. His tan skin is flushed from the heat, knees blotchy and red from where they were pressed against the floor. He takes his own erection in his hand, rather than coming closer to Steve he moves away from him, leaning back against the wall as he slowly strokes himself. Dark eyes focus on Steve as he does so, head lolling to one shoulder. “I bet it turns you on, us being in here together. I can see it cross your mind every time we’re in the showers
“To keep my contract,” Tony interrupts what Ty is probably trying to spin as a positive with the truth. “As long as they don’t leave me on the 40-man for more than a full season, I can’t be optioned to the Minors or be up for the draft for another team in December. Can’t break my contract ‘cause it’ll blackball me from playing until my lease is up with them. They’re leaving me
“If you don’t have something nice to say, Tony…” Maria chides. Though the reminder is soft, there’s a glint in her eyes that shows she’s not to be defied. Tony rolls his eyes but doesn’t argue against it further. “But of course, you don’t have to be so formal with us, Steve,” she says, adapting her son’s crude observation into a much kinder suggestion. “The real question is: what’s it like coaching our son? I imagine he’s more than a handful for even the strictest captain.”
“You know weddings make me horny,” Tony says, hands immediately searching along the planes of Steve’s exposed chest before dropping down to rub the palm of his hand over his crotch.
Rather than spend yet another author's note talking about how sorry I am for taking so long to update (very), I'll instead use it to point out that this chapter ended up being waaay beefier than I expected (another 30k+ lmao) and I ended up writing so much that I extended the story by another chapter!! What was formally a seven Chapter fic will now be EIGHT whole chapters!! And that's including an epilogue.
The woman ignores Tony's comment and sets down the platter before reaching out to pull her son into a hug. To Steve's surprise, Tony hugs her back tightly, fiercely even, kissing her on both cheeks in greeting. "Mom, this is Steve Rogers. Rogers, the wonderful woman who birthed me."
Tony quickly glances around both ends of the hall before grabbing Steve by the front of his sweatshirt and yanking him inside. He kicks the door shut and locks it behind him, practically climbing up into Steve’s arms. Steve catches his weight, hoisting him up so that their lips can meet in a clumsy reunion. “Oh my god,” Tony says between kisses, holding onto his face just to make extra sure he’s real. “What are you— Doing here?”
Ty scoffs, shaking his head as he turns his back on him and heads for the door. “You still lose, Tony. You can be as bitter as you want from the sidelines while
“These are hardly even going to scar, you’ll be fine,” Pepper reprimands, laying the bandage across the length of his cheek, making sure the adhesive is secure. “Now I’ve got to get back downstairs and deal with the shitstorm that’s waiting for me. I probably won’t get the chance to see you again before tomorrow so… behave, okay?” she hugs him tightly, turning her face to whisper quietly in his ear, making sure no one else can pick up on it. “You know the drill. Don’t address any questions about it and it will all blow over, sweetie.”
Peggy keeps her expression neutral. "That matter is not for discussion and we cannot make any more statements concerning Chester at this time. As I was saying, I'd like to introduce our top six players this season, whom the Stars and Brooklyn are all very proud of. Our current Captain, Timothy "Dum Dum" Dugan, Jacques Dernier, James Montgomery Falsworth, Jim Morita, Steve Rogers, and James Buchanan Barnes."
Tony can’t stand to look at him any longer. He storms past Steve and grabs his coat off the rack, scooping up his car keys off Steve’s mail table by the door.
She giggles, wrapping her arms around his neck as he leans over to give high fives to the outstretched hands of Clint’s kids. “Mama says I’m gonna be taller than you, soon!”
Tony gets some of his bearings back when Steve shows discomfort, grinning wolfishly at him. “It wasn’t
“Tony!” He shouts again as he’s only a few yards away, now close enough for Tony to hear. The pitcher glances over his shoulder, doing a double-take when he realizes the voice isn’t just his imagination.
His pleas fall on deaf ears as Tony leaves the apartment, slamming the sliding metal door shut behind him. He hears a dull clang from behind him as he strides down the hallway, but he isn’t pursued.
“What? Janet told me you’ve gotten offers from them,” Steve says, naturally dropping into a whisper. “You’ve never even considered it?”
Steve finally brings himself to look at her, all kind-eyed with ginger colored freckles dotting her face. He can’t pinpoint her age, but she’s probably a few years younger than Steve, but not quite as young as Tony. “What did he tell you?” Steve asks hesitantly. As much as their relationship has developed since their first encounter back on Christmas, they haven’t really made things
“Go easy on him, Jan,” Natasha drawls, finally exiting the bathroom with Clint’s arm patched up. “Aside from Hammer, our guys came out of that scrap way worse. Everyone was drinking, and I’m sure we can talk to all the eyewitnesses who got involved and they’ll happily back up that Tony didn’t attack first. Not to mention Stane won’t waste time pressing charges against
As Steve rounds the corner of the hallway leading to Tony’s room, his heart skips a beat when he sees the door is already partially open. Maybe he can get in easier than he thought. Or the door would just get slammed in his face. As he gets closer, he sees a man crouched by the door with a toolbox propping it open.
“Yeah. We’ve spent every Christmas Day together since we were kids. This is the first year we won’t be able to… I should’ve known better and left last night.” he sighs again, guilt washing over him.
The man is getting into a pickup truck that looks like it could use a paint job about five years ago. Tony looks at his roadster parked across the street and hopes no one decides to come along and vandalize it before he climbs up into the cab with a total stranger.
“Neither,” Tony finally speaks up over the din of the locker room. He’s still got a grimace on his face, almost like he can’t believe he’s humoring his Captain enough with a response. His eyes are trained on his cleats that Steve’s watched him re-lace about three times now. “She’s technically my
“Is this where you’re staying while you look for a place?” Steve asks in confusion, craning his neck back as far as it will go to try and spot the top of the massive building. He supposes Tony’s decision to come to New York may have been last minute, but it wasn’t like he couldn’t afford the competitive real estate market in Manhattan.
The booth is quiet for a while, Tony downing the beer in a few swigs. Dove covertly manages to replace the empty bottle with a full one without engaging the mute couple. Steve takes a slow sip of his coffee. Just this once, he’s not going to talk first. He’ll happily leave the ball in Tony’s very volatile court.
Tony can’t really think of any third musketeer he remembers being mentioned in all of Steve’s regalia about his and Bucky’s time spent in New York, but then again, just because he knows Steve isn’t the most social butterfly in the world doesn’t mean Bucky can’t be.
“To say sorry, for how I came across earlier. I’m really happy I’m here,” he presses another few short kisses to Tony’s mouth. He’s still unsure of how to go about all this, but for now he does whatever feels natural.
“Hi, honey. Jersey looks good on you,” Tony compliments with a grin, leaning over to share a quick peck.
A hum of interest rumbles in Tony’s throat when he feels it too, Steve feeling his lips curve into a grin as his hand snakes lower. He feels the pressure of his hand wrap around his growing erection in his jeans, Steve’s hand instinctively shooting down to grab Tony by the wrist. He doesn’t move it away, but he doesn’t let go either. Tony breaks away from the kiss, Steve’s eyes snapping open almost sheepishly at his sudden reaction.
Steve now turns to see the flat screen TV mounted in the corner of the room, currently muted and playing ESPN’s coverage of the All-Star Futures Game, this year hosted by the New York Yankees. They’re interviewing different players from the National and World teams, some on their own and some in small groups. The Futures Game was founded a few years ago, and garners a little more popularity each year. It’s a nice break from the height of the Major League Baseball season, the MLB teams taking turns to host Minor League ball players each year. It’s similar to the usual All-Star game where the opposing teams are made of a conglomerate of players, but instead of just pulling from the two leagues within the U.S., one team is made up of all United States based players, while the other is comprised of players from leagues all around the world. It was a fun showcase all the prospects from the minor league, both players they’re familiar with as well as those from other countries.
Hammer holds up his hands. “Whoa, there! No need for the hostility, buddy! I’m just making a statement. We were all sharing some stories about our dear friend Tony, weren’t we?” He stares around the group with wide eyes, now holding his hands innocently over his heart. “I just wanna express how happy I am that your new teammates don’t judge you for being a faggot.”
Tony gives an encouraging squeeze. “All the locals here know me and my family,” he pauses to wave at little old Mary sitting on her porch knitting, who gives a friendly wave and a bright smile. “No one’s going to yell at us or call the paparazzi. We’re safe here,” he promises. He’s introduced Steve as “his friend” a few times to the store clerks and restaurant in town who he’s all known since childhood. Everyone’s been nothing but warm and welcoming, not even batting an eyelash.
“Just so it will dry. You don’t want to shake it too hard though because it could distort it,” Steve explains.
get to see,” she sighs, running a hand through her strawberry blonde locks. “Tony knows that if his secret gets out, his entire career is over, and there’s no way he’ll be able to fall back on Stark Industries, even with his father not around anymore to disown him. Messing around with a fellow teammate? It’s just asking to get found out,” she sighs.
For once, Tony blocks out the rest of the world. Where he normally lets the environment fuel him, the sound of the fans pumping him up, the attention from the commentators raising his chin higher, his teammates and rivals alike driving him to play harder— it all falls away.
“So...” Steve opens in such a painfully conversational tone that he’s already dreading the conversation that he knows is about to follow. “You never told me how your meeting with Janet the other day went.”
The Stars are up to bat again, and Steve and Bucky are too far apart in the batting rotation to have any real conversation. Bucky gets a double, the next two batters helping him along to slide into home. There’s some contesting over whether or not he was tagged out, the crowd and players alike growing anxious. Brooklyn needs every run they can get at this point. Hodge is arguing tensely with the ref before the play is deemed good, earning cheers and boos from both sides.
His Stark-brand flair is showcased elsewhere, a custom garage built out back to house all his cars and double as his lab for the more extraneous projects his mind cooked up when he’s home on break. That space is all Tony’s, but they worked together to make something for the both of them as well.
Feet of snow are piled up outside, completely covering cars on the street, windswept up against the fronts of buildings and storefronts. The past few days have been without precipitation, but the temperature has still been far below freezing, leaving the snow to settle into perfect packing snow for a winter’s day like this. The blanket of gray clouds in the sky has cleared up this morning, the sun shining brightly down to make the snow sparkle. Tony’s right, the city will probably have trucks out later today to start clearing the snow away, especially if it gets warm enough to naturally melt some of it away. By tomorrow, the roads will probably be clear enough for Bucky to make his way down for some New Years Day designated best friend time.
“Danvers here is a lot more hands-on than most owners you’ll know in the league, so expect to see her a lot around the Stadium. I apologize we’re running a little behind schedule this morning, and I’m sure you’ll notice Coach Stark isn’t here just yet. Until he gets here I’m going to have you all go ahead and start warming up. Get some stretches in, go around the diamond for a lap or two if you need it—”
“Bye, Peg,” he watches her cross the parking lot to where Tony’s been waiting. He doesn’t miss the glare Tony shoots his way as he pulls out of the lot, speeding back onto the road. As if they hadn’t needed anymore points of contention, of course fate had to throw one more stick into Steve’s wheel spokes.
Steve rolls his eyes but otherwise re-dresses his top half protest-free. Tony pretends he’s not ogling Steve’s shirtless form through the large mirror on the wall, but maybe he makes sure he’s standing in an advantageous position to peek at him through the reflection.
The losing team’s MVP is announced first and goes to Kaminzky for earning or contributing to the most outs for the PCL as well as playing the entire game. Everyone applauds, the Polish baseman accepting the award happily and joining the rest of his team in a group huddle.
Obadiah ruffles the top of his hair, eyes twinkling. “Looks good on you kid, as much as I hate to admit it. You look strong. Healthy. You’re playing better too. I mean, you’ve always been amazing, but Romanoff must be doing something right if she’s been able to keep you in line this long.”
“Not really,” she shrugs. “A couple of close friends. My family, of course. They’re all very supportive as they made clear over breakfast,” she laughs, rolling her eyes. “Mostly people outside of the baseball world. I have a hard enough time as just a woman, I’d rather not throw
Practices resume and Steve’s teammates kindly refrain from commenting on how his heart’s just not in it right now. Even Hodge gives him a break for once. Any free time Steve has, he’s at the hospital with Bucky. Most nights he falls asleep sitting upright in the just-too-small armchair in his hospital room, but occasionally a nurse comes by to kindly kick him out.
Steve briefly squeezes his hand and drops it away just as quickly as a car passes by at a lazy pace. “I think it’s a really good fit.”
The ringing is back. A high pitched, continuous wail reverberating in his inner ear, irritating him to no end. He wants to shake his head to rid himself of the sound, but finds it difficult for his body to follow the function his brain is trying to perform.
It arrives within ten minutes, a baby-faced bellhop wheeling the cart of breakfast food and freshly brewed coffee into the room and nervously accepting Tony’s very gracious tip. As he settles onto a stool by the breakfast bar in the kitchen, the bathroom door opens and Steve emerges with a towel wrapped around his waist. Tony has a brief moment of eye contact before Steve disappears behind the wall that separates the bedroom from the rest of the suite.
Tony just shrugs, looking away from him to stare out at the grey waters lapping at the dark sand down below. “Couldn’t sleep.” He tightens the blanket around his form, tucking his legs closer to his chest.
“Not at the cost of you getting hurt!” Tony explodes. “Don’t think of the stupid game right now, none of that matters!”
She laughs and gently eases his arms back to his sides. “Limited use, remember? We all want to see you back on that field.”
“You should consider school,” Tony tells Peter as they start to wrap things up, insisting the boy be the first to sign his cast. He's flabbergasted by the honor, scrawling his signature across the plaster in Sharpie before he has to get home for dinner with his Aunt. “It’s clear you have a gift for pitching, but don’t let that be the only gift people think has any value, okay? Keep doing it if you love it, but don’t forget your other passions. You’ve got more to offer people than throwing a few balls, okay?”
The next thing Tony sees is a scrawny looking teenager get pushed into the room, the tops of his shoulders seemingly connected to his ears. Steve’s got his hands on the kid’s back, guiding him into the room and pushing the door shut with his foot behind him to prevent escape.
some sound logic to argue against. Steve is sure he’s probably had the same thoughts when thinking about the young Stark. “Okay… But even if he wanted to move on from the Irons, why not go to the MLB? Don’t try and tell me that he wouldn’t get drafted in a second if he were made available, ‘personality kinks’ aside.”
His next swing finally connects with the ball, Steve watching as it sails further and further, higher and higher, disappearing into the stands. He tosses the bat aside and immediately takes off, sprinting around the bases rather than taking his time to celebrate a home run. As soon as his feet touch down on home again, he runs off the field, brushing past Dugan and his other teammates.
As Tony starts scarfing down his food at the counter, Ty crosses over to the fridge and pulls out a carton of orange juice, uncapping it and taking an experimental sniff. “Did you… pour champagne in this?”
Tony's eyebrow peaks along with his level of interest. "One pitch per player?" He glances around at everyone, dark eyes lingering on Steve for a beat longer than everyone else. Tony gives him a once over, a feeling of discomfort washing over the blonde. Does Tony remember him from last year? "Too easy."
I’d have to stay local because there’s no way I’d leave you again and no way I’d make you uproot your life.”
Parking around Tony’s complex is a nightmare, Steve rolling down his window to get a better view as he drives by the front door. There’s already a swath of reporters outside, undeterred by the rain, covered in shiny plastic ponchos to try and preserve themselves. Steve turns at the next corner and scans the streets, having to park two blocks away.
Steve shrugs. “It’s fine, I guess.” They haven’t talked ball in the entire four days since the accident. “I’m playing like crap, obviously.”
Plenty were still loyal though, and showed their support, that number of people growing with each passing day. The world got a lot more tolerable with each year that went on, something Steve told himself time and time again as more of a comfort and a hope, never really believing it until he could see the change happening around him. They released a simple statement that he and Tony would be able to work together and set aside their relationship to be complete professionals, but there would always be people trying to tear them down.
“I don’t want that,” Tony grounds out in frustration, shaky hand going to refill his glass. “And if I turn down the offer then either Janet’s going to shred my contract proposal or just let me drown in guilt for the rest of the season because they don’t get to cash a fat check from Pierce.”
“Stark is a wasted player to me if I only let him do one thing. I want to move Tony around during the exhibitions and see how far I can push his potential. It’s also a test for his patience. I want to see if he’ll still perform at his best even if he’s not getting his way,” She crosses her arms, Steve practically shrinking under her hard gaze. “I know what I’m doing, Steve. I told you to let me worry about Stark, so don’t question me again on this again, understand?”
Tony is still fast asleep when he makes his way back into the den, grabbing a book off one of Tony’s bookshelves to absentmindedly flip through while he waits for the other man to wake up. It’s hard at first to pick something that isn’t either in a foreign language, or has to do with theoretical math and scientific theories, but he makes do with a book about the history of product design so there’s at least something interesting he can relate to.
"You started playing in the minor league at 15, and now are sitting next to a team going towards going to the World Series. Is this where you thought you'd be?"
Their fielders aren’t going to make any technical mistakes at a crucial moment like this, so Tony is going to have to play smart. He switches sides of the plate he stands on, knocking some red dirt off his cleats before assuming position again, now batting left-handed. He glares down the line at Hammer with a revived determination burning inside of him, rapidly working out the exact path his swing will need to take, the perfect moment to connect with the ball, the precise spot he needs the ball to land in--
It’s hard to hear someone talk about Tony that way, and becomes even harder when it’s coming from the man’s father himself. Sure, Steve and Tony aren’t exactly chums. They have their issues, and there are some days where Steve just wanted to snap and call Tony out for all the things Howard had been doing all night. However, no matter how infuriating or obscene Tony acted, he’s still a part of the team, and Steve would never undercut his own player in that way.
Tony doesn’t take his eyes of Steve’s when he addresses her, lips curling attractively around the cigarette in his mouth. “No time like the present, Jan.”
The room is quiet, Tony wondering if he can get away with just making a dash for the exit while Janet is giving him the silent treatment. He eventually turns to look back at her, the woman looking exhausted as she stares out the window, Pierce’s little slip of paper clenched in one of her hands.
The pitcher sits up, a juvenile spark in his eye as he bounces on the bed slightly, giving Steve a little shove. “Come on, they finally cleared people to start leaving their homes and the streets are getting cleaned up today. We should go out and take advantage while we still can.” He’s already climbing off the bed and going over to his closet, pulling clothes out of dressers to begin layering up. “Besides, I figure this is our last day together, so we should do something fun before you go home.”
It’s a fastball, just like Tony had expected. He times his swing perfectly this time, but changes the angle to get the trajectory just how he wants it. He takes off, knowing that the ball is at least a double to get Miller, the player on second, home. He can possibly get himself to third if he hauls ass and the International League puts the focus on getting the ball home to prevent another run.
He does his best to keep his composure, continuing their little circle and pretending to find something glittery on Natasha’s sleeve very eye-catching. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Thank you for sharing and commenting as always! It really helps motivate me to keep writing. I'm glad you guys are loving the fic as much as I do <3
no such thing,” he responds curtly, expression indifferent. “She’s been an advocate for you to join the Knights for the past few years now and is an old friend of Mr. Fury’s
Tony mockingly mirrors his incredulous look. “Why would I bother trying to find a more permanent residence? We travel a lot anyway, and who knows if I’ll even be here next season. Plus, I get all the perks of room service and don’t have to deal with annoying neighbors.”
Steve sighs once they’re out of earshot. “You’ve gotta be more positive, Buck. He’s doing his best to help you. Give the man an inch, at least.”
His clothes are completely soaked through by the time he makes it back to Tony’s building, pushing his way past the reporters. Security has come out now to try and wave them off, and they almost stop Steve from entering until one of them recognizes him and allows him through. Unfortunately, this isn’t until after the reporters caught on to exactly who he was, camera flashes going off as the herd of them call out his name.
The model of camera Tony has given him is simple, plain, nothing flashy to it. It’s brown and tan with a few accents of white, and there’s a nice camera strap attached to it that looks like Tony picked it out himself, a dark brown with light blue stitching criss-crossing in a simple pattern across it. Steve lifts it experimentally to his eye to peer through the eyepiece, framing up a few different shots without actually pulling the trigger. He had loved photography as a kid, usually trying to capture all sorts of things that he could reference later when sketching.
, Tony, we can talk about this. We said we were going to try! You promised we were going to get through this.”
“Peggy?” Tony asks in a small voice, doing another once over of the room to make sure he hadn’t missed her somehow. “Is she still here?”
With two minutes left of ‘93, everyone piles into Tony’s living room, all of them huddled around the TV mounted above the fireplace to watch the ball drop. Tony is towards the back of the group, Steve returning from the bathroom to slide up next to him. The sides of their hands brush together, Tony’s eyes darting around in alert to see if they’re in view of anyone. There’s plenty of discordant noise as everyone carries on conversation and starts talking about the host that year and other unimportant things being flashed about on the screen, no one in particular paying them any mind.
Maria’s smiling tightly, still looking at Steve. “Howie, Darling, can we please drop this already? You haven’t even asked your son how he likes his new team yet.”
“So, I saw something pretty funny earlier today. Mrs. Sanchez from down the hall was walking her dog
A sheepish smile crosses Steve's face. He tends to put on complete blinders when it comes to the media, but now it leaves him feeling rather oblivious. He avoids the sports sections of papers and doesn’t even have a television in his current apartment to keep up to date on any of the goings on. He stays concerned with his current team and that’s it.
Sorry there was a bit of a longer wait on this chapter! I hope all the juicy Stony interactions that finally come around made it worth the wait.
“No, I haven’t heard yet. I got here not too long ago,” he leads her over to a couch so she can sit down. Her hands are trembling and he can see rumpled tissues peeking out of her coat pockets. “His injuries look like it was from some kind of assault though.”
Steve chokes on his beer at the innocent enough question with a far-from-innocent answer. He does his best to recover, coughing into his hand as Rhodey’s curious look becomes even moreso. “Uh… You know… Just got him talking about himself.” He hopes his blush doesn’t give him away.
Tony grins at him as the whistle is blown and Waynes steps up to bat. “I won’t, sir. Thanks for trusting me.”
she had told Steve during last year’s off season, when he first found out his injury would keep him from major league play.
Bucky takes a moment to consider his answer. “A little, yeah,” he says honestly. “How we grew up, that shit definitely wasn’t ever considered
, and it puts a bad taste in his mouth. Tony spits on the ground to rid the memory and crouches in a ready position. He has a newfound drive for this game, and it's to get Steve Rogers out at every opportunity provided. It would probably feel more satisfying if he could've knocked him out as a pitcher, but catching an out would have to do.
Eventually, the rest of the Stars filter out of the stadium, immediately glomming onto Steve to congratulate him. It's a little easier to deal with all the attention, especially when Bucky keeps to his wings. They immediately head off to the first bar that Dugan and the other boys had scoped out in the previous days during the series, making their way from pub to pub. Each one becomes more crowded than the last, crowds following them no matter where they go. They may be in enemy territory, but even some Oakland die-hards are just excited to be a part of the festivities.
Steve furrows his brow, his gaze immediately gravitating back to wherever his other half is. He’s surprised to see Tony and Bucky talking casually to each other, both of them watching Steve and Natasha. Steve shoots them a quick smile, Bucky raising his hand in a small wave and Tony flashing a wink. “How so?”
“Oh,” Steve breathes out in surprise, bracing his hands against the wall and letting his head go slack. Warm water rushes down the back of his neck and along his jawline, dripping down onto Tony who doesn’t seem to mind. His eyes are closed as he bobs his head, Steve quickly hardening in that hot channel.
As promised, nurses come by a couple of hours later to collect Tony’s things and wheel him down to the other wing. He’ll be allowed visitors now, Steve informing him that the team has been coming by constantly to check in on his condition, namely Rhodey and Bruce. Tony feels a pang of sadness, trying to remember the last time he corresponded with either of them. He thought he has been doing everyone a service, keeping his distance with all the controversy these past couple of years, but maybe he’s only been harming himself in the process.
All it took was them breaching the hypothetical topic over a barbecue at their Albany house one night and Tony agreed immediately. Like everything he did with his career, there was plenty of controversy their decision had been met with when they made the announcement. Considering how outraged some people were about Steve becoming manager of the team a few years back, they were bound to ruffle some feathers with yet another change in coaching. Carol takes it all far more gracefully than Steve ever could, especially considering Nick Fury got plenty of flack just for being a black owner of a team. Passing his legacy off to “a dyke and a couple of queers” was too much for some fans.
Tony blows his whistle, letting it dangle around his neck. “Alright, get your stretches in now because we’re starting with a scrimmage in fifteen. Once you’re done split up into Vets versus Newbies.”
He grabs Rezzo by the sleeve, interrupting him halfway through his pep talk to the batters on deck. “Coach, take out the DH.”
you say no, then I really have no choice,” she shrugs. “You’re too smart for me to be anything but transparent with you. You know you have all the pull here. I suppose I could just tell you if you don’t take Pierce’s offer then I drop your contract as well and leave you without a team to play on for the next season.”
He smiles and leans over enough to plug it back in, checking his watch on the nightstand to reset the time. It’s a little after eight, meaning Tony probably left a few hours ago to get back to the city in time, and that Steve better get moving if he doesn’t want to be late himself.
Tony stands in the hallway wearing a faded Pepsi-Cola t-shirt and jeans with a rip in the knee. "You're overdressed." He observes blankly.
to see you go, Tony, myself especially. As many grey hairs as you’ve given me, I’d take a million more if it meant you could stay with us for a few more seasons,” she fixes melancholy eyes on him, reaching out to squeeze his arm. “I’m going to miss you, Tony.”
Tony sighs and rolls his eyes so hard his head tips back towards the ceiling and stays there. "My old man wanted to invite you over to our house for dinner."
Steve is wrong. Months go by, and Tony doesn’t feel like it’s getting any better. Their schedules are as hectic as expected, both of them constantly traveling and not always in the position to call each other and have to face questioning glances from those around them as to who they’re talking to. He manages to convince Steve to buy a computer and discover the wonders of email. It’s not quite the same as being able to talk to each other, but they can at least exchange basic information a few times a week just to catch each other up.
Hammer’s slider is sloppy at best, but Tony realizes Steve probably could’ve swung for it and at least gotten a double, but he’s glad the man holds off, maintaining his credence in Tony’s advice.
On top of that, Tony’s alcoholism has gotten far worse. What he played off as a leftover social habit from his party boy days, and just a bit of liquor here and there to take the edge off quickly snowballed out of control. The stress of the Major League coupled with all of the vitriol from fans, peers, and the media left him with only one coping mechanism to fall back on. A month ago, Steve along with the rest of the world watched Tony vomit on the pitcher’s mound in the middle of the game, not even having time to get off the field before passing out. Steve’s own game schedule was too busy to warrant a trip to D.C., but Carol called to inform him this was the fifth time Tony had to get his stomach pumped in the past year.
Steve continues to press. If Tony didn't want to admit he was sleeping with Christine, that was fine, but Steve was going to confront this woman himself if she thought drugging people was acceptable. "Let me in, Tony."
“Exactly,” Natasha sighs. “The way Janet laid it out to me… Tony is sick of the negative attention around the fact that he started playing for his father’s team with no prior baseball experience. While it’s obvious to most people he’s perfectly capable of handling himself in a Triple-A league—hell, he’d be great for the majors if he worked out a few personality kinks—he still gets criticism on whether or not there’s nepotism involved.”
“You and I both know that’s a stupid question, Tony,” Steve sighs. “But I really do think you should think about it. I mean, you’ve been doing amazing with the Avengers, but I’d have to agree with everyone saying it might be your time to move on. Besides, so many ball players work for the entire
He still hasn’t managed to recover, having been prepared to haughtily torture Tony from the high ground, not be sucker punched and brought down to his level. “How… How did you…”
OOF that was a lot of baseball, huh? I promise I won't be so heavy with sports scenes in the future, I just felt this was important to establish more thoroughly. Hope you guys made it through that okay.
Steve gives one good push with his shoulder and the chain snaps. Tony jumps back as the door swings open, and Steve ignores his indignant cries as he shoves past him into the suite, looking around for any evidence of the reporter. They must've already been in the bedroom.
Steve hasn’t had an easy past season either. He’s been back at physical therapy twice a week to make sure his knee is still functioning properly, and has barely seen any league play this season. Despite this, the Avengers are coming off of another Championship game win, this time not even going up against their long time rivals of the Irons. It’s almost poetic how after Tony had moved on, the PCL team seemed to lose steam, coming out at the middle of the season for the first time in a while. Howard was probably rolling in his grave, much to Tony’s own satisfaction. The Knights were just shy of going to the World Series this year, which meant Tony was able to go back to New York during the post-season and properly celebrate with his old team.
After about seven miles with breaks in between, they finally come to a stop at Carol’s cabin. Her parents are just now getting up for the day and insist Tony stays for a hearty breakfast. The Danvers are kind and welcoming, surprising Tony when they bring up how shameful it is that people are reacting so negatively to his coming out. On basic instinct, Tony just assumes that 90% of the older generation are the ones who spearhead the hateful movement against queer communities. Carol cordially shifts the topic away from that when Tony’s discomfort is clear, making a face at him from across the table.
They set the ground rules months before, knowing if there was one little slip up then it was the Avengers’ reputation that was on the line, not just theirs. No kissing or touching at the stadium, no bringing their home life to work, no discussing their relationship to the media, and absolutely no tolerance of any players who try to undermine their authority. Steve tried to set a
“The emergency contacts, I presume?” The nurse glances to her coworker behind the desk who gives a nod of confirmation. “Mr. Rogers, Ms. Carter?”
Steve shoves him back instead, not hard, but enough to send Tony a couple steps back. “That’s why I’m doing this.” He looks to the stunned spectators of their dispute and nods. “Sorry for the hold up. We can resume.”
“Didn’t need you to tell me,” Tony scoffs, as if he’s totally offended by the idea. He gets to his feet, wiping his hands off on his jeans. “I also installed the rewinder right into the machine so you don’t need this anymore,” he kicks the now gutted leftovers of his separate machine. “You’ll just use this new little button on the end.”
handsome. My mug is my moneymaker, whereas Hammer’s rat face could use some rearranging. Honestly, he should
"Tony?" he calls loudly, unsure if he'll even be heard over the screeching guitar solo. Something goes flying by his head, Steve barely having time to duck out of the way. It crashes against the wall and hits the floor, sparks going everywhere.
Steve sits down in the stands, answering a few emails on his phone and occasionally glancing up to observe how practice is going so far. Tony walks around between all the positions, surveying the players and occasionally shouting out instructions, or calling a timeout in the game for some kind of teachable moment. He does have to admit that starting their practice off with a little spirited rivalry is far more interesting than having the boys do stamina training or boring drills. The players all even look like they’re having
There’s no Steve in his kitchen already making him breakfast, kissing him against the temple before he sits down at his rickety old table with the newspaper, sliding the crossword insert down towards Tony’s seat. He gets out his skillet and cracks a couple of eggs and throws some strips of bacon down into it, annoyed when he, once again, breaks the yolk trying to flip it. Steve always made it look so easy…
Tony takes a deep breath and stares back down at the cards in his hands. He reads them again, and again, and again. Takes notes from all three of them on his tone, when the right times to pause is. He’s not supposed to take any live questions, just read his statement and walk off. They adjust a couple of words here and there, and before he knows it, he’s stepping out onto the stage.
It’s a cryptic answer, one Steve isn’t expecting. “That can be normal,” he hedges. “Is there any reason you didn’t go to the memorial service?”
Still feeling out of his element, he settles his hands neutrally on Tony’s waist, pulling him closer. He doesn’t want to appear incompetent in every aspect of this, despite Tony knowing it’s his first time with a man. It’s odd letting someone else take the reins on things for once. In Steve’s experience, he’s only ever been with women who were very
, he wants to tack on to the end, but something tightens in his throat, forcing him to tug the phrase back.
Steve hums. “Kind of sounds like an excuse to cover up that you drink too much booze and caffeine at all hours of the day and night so your circadian rhythm is out of whack and you just need to lay down for nap time.”
, even. Normally when a beloved player transfers teams of their own volition (usually driven by money), the fan base reacts poorly. If anything, Tony’s secret stunt of leaving the Avengers had only increased his popularity. Steve has caught glimpses of Tony’s fans before or after games, and they’re definitely… passionate. As if one could consider yelling marriage proposals and public indecency for the sake of flashing the publicly-proclaimed ladies’ man anything other than
He’s being shifted again, hands tilting his head up and away from his knees. “Keep breathing like that, Tony, ready? We’ve got your inhaler, take another deep breath—”
“I was a fan favorite choice this year,” he brags loudly. Tony had almost forgotten how awful his timbre was.
Tony kicks away from the desk, his chair rolling across the lab. Steve realizes that a tornado really did hit this place, and its name is Tony Stark. The kid starts loading stuff up in his lap, ricocheting around the lab on his rolling chair. He picks up a blueprint, a huge roll of some kind of thick material, a half-eaten sandwich, and a ruler before landing at some kind of cutting station.
“Oh my god,” he groans, covering his face with his arm. “I’m not having this discussion. Please, call the doctor back to put me out of my misery now.”
Steve reluctantly tries to keep his focus but is distracted from his position as shortstop, eyes constantly flickering over to where Tony is sitting in the dugout. Rhodes is on the field with him, but Bruce has yet to go up and is sitting quietly in the corner with Tony. The two seem to be holding some conversation, but more often than not, Steve finds that Tony’s eyes are trained on the field and sometimes even directly zeroed in on him.
“Me,” Steve answers immediately, taking Tony by surprise. He straightens up out of the huddle. “Listen to Stark, he knows what he’s talking about here. We can do this guys.”
“I don’t know, honey…” Tony balks all of the sudden. It’s such a rare occasion to see him timid in the face of opportunity.
Tony is asleep at the desk, head resting on his folded arms in front of him with his mouth hanging open slightly. All of the prepared defenses and explanations he had go out the window, some of the tenseness leaving his shoulders as he approaches. He shuts off the stereo and plucks the pencil from behind Tony’s ear to set it down on the desk. As gently as possible, he maneuvers Tony to lean back in his chair so he can get his arms behind his back and under his legs to scoop him up bridal style and carry him downstairs.
She waves him off. “Like I said, it’s not your fault. The only other thing that made me hesitant was the fact that you’re
"Why not sign me on for one or two seasons? Chester wanted me so badly that he thought I wouldn't want to stay on the team after this season if Bucky wasn't able to play?" Steve asks angrily.
He hangs up the phone and stares at it for a moment. He does feel a little better after talking to Bucky, but for some reason he was unable to tell the truth about who he’s with. Is he ashamed? Does he fear what kind of questions Bucky would ask if he knew it was Tony who he spent the night with? He doesn’t think Bucky would jump to any conclusions, but what if he did? Would Steve be able to lie to him?
Steve nods wordlessly. The room is a clear culmination standing by this belief, a juxtaposition of shiny and new Stark baseball gear and well-worn relics from the best of the best from the history of America’s Favorite Pastime. After another scan of the room, Steve now notices that there is an alcove that is completely bare, free of any knickknacks. It’s in the direct center of the far wall, wider with much more shelf real estate than the others. “Reserving that one for someone special, sir?” Steve asks, nodding towards it.
Steve decides he’s of absolutely no help just standing around watching Tony work with a bunch of components he doesn’t even understand, and decides to putt around his kitchen. He looks for something to do, things to clean, starts prepping some ingredients he can incorporate into some kind of dinner later while Tony works. He glances over into the living room every now and again, seeing varying sizes of plastic and mechanical odds and ends strewn about on the floor in the same organized chaotic fashion that Tony’s workshop back in Malibu had displayed.
“Hey,” he calls out to Tony, standing to follow him. “Why don’t we go out after the games today? We can check out that new glow-in-the-dark bowling place that Scott and Clint keep talking about if you want. Might brighten up your spirits?”
He’s midway through a yawn as he answers the door, too tired to look through the peephole first. “Ty, this better have been worth waking me up— Steve?”
The sentiment is sweet, but misguided. Tony shakes his head. “You don’t get it. You painting a target on yourself isn’t going to take the attention away from me, it’s just going to bring it down that much harder. Think about it, Steve. People already had reason enough to dislike me. Now, they feel like they can validate their hatred and fear because I was never the ideal figure for them. Just because you’re not in the Majors anymore and you know your team would support you unconditionally doesn’t mean you coming out would be all hunky-dory. You’re the baseball world’s
“Buddy!” Tony shouts, the door immediately opening. He probably had the handle turned as soon as they started the screaming match, just waiting for his cue. “Steve’s leaving. Now.”
They’re the last to arrive to the ballpark, security tight to keep the media and the fans around the front side so the players are able to get in with no issues. Natasha is pretty strict on reporters talking to them before the game starts, so if they have any interviews with outlets, it won’t be until after the game. Tony has a good idea of the kinds of questions he’s going to hear considering he’ll be defeating his former team, Janet providing appropriate answers he can work off of. Of course, he’ll probably stray away from those more curated statements to give a classic Tony Stark quote, but at this point she surely expects a little clean up will be necessary.
"I'm going to head back to the apartment for a few, but I'll catch up with you guys there," Steve replies, tossing his balled up towel into the bin on the other side of the locker room.
“It’s beautiful here,” Steve agrees softly, running his thumb gently along the smooth inside of Tony’s wrist. “I can see where his inspiration came from. I could imagine wanting to live here forever.”
,” Tony gasps out, entire body jerking forward as Steve’s warm tongue swipes over his asshole. His fingers dig into Tony’s hips hard enough to bruise as he eats him out from behind, tongue prodding at the tight ring of muscle to slowly ease him open. He teases Tony like that for what feels like
In the end, only one makes it through, Tony himself earning their third and final out on quick reaction time alone, and given to none other than Justin Hammer. Tony’s screwball came flying right back for his own face, Hammer mistakenly hitting it straight back to him. He barely has a second from the ball leaving his hand before he raises his glove up in front of his face, the ball connecting solidly with the leather. It takes him to the ground, Tony leaning back out of the way from the sudden impact and falling back onto the mound. He keeps the ball clutched tight in his glove, staring up at the sky in disbelief as he raises it up to show the refs and the rest of the world that they’ve won.
“Oh, believe me, to the general public you two are doing a great job,” Peggy comes back over to sit next to Steve. He finally tears his gaze away from Tony to meet her eyes, feeling somehow more embarrassed and vulnerable than when Pepper had called him out. Maybe it’s because he knows Peggy personally and they’ve been friends since even before he met Tony— her nephew on top of everything else.
As midnight creeps closer, everyone seems to be drunk enough to forget about offering Tony well-wishes for his career, or lament to them how empty the Avengers are going to feel now that he’s gone. All his friends are too busy celebrating each other and discussing everything they want to do in the new year— which is exactly what Tony wants. This isn’t supposed to be a pity party, it’s his final stand.
Bucky's comment from earlier in the night echoes in Steve's mind. Steve checks the clock hanging on the wall; it reads 7:40. He still has time to get down to the public library and use the computers there to do a little research.
, so stupid. Tony doesn’t need to sit in a big circle of sniffling adults who want to talk about their feelings to cope. It makes him uncomfortable, trying to be vulnerable in front of a bunch of strangers. He’s hardly even able to be that open and honest with his friends.
Tony initiates the next kiss, running his hands through Steve’s short locks and pulling him down on top of him. The grip in his hair tugs his head back enough for Tony to mouth at his neck, Steve unable to hold back a groan at the sensation of Tony’s warm tongue against such a sensitive area. He can already feel himself getting turned on as Tony begins to suck and bite along his throat, blood rushing down south as the rest of his body begins to take interest. It’s an immediate reaction as he’s reminded of the sensations from last night, thinking of Tony’s talented mouth going to much more sensitive places.
Steve thinks that those are the most words Tony has ever spoken to him at once that weren’t underhanded jibes or flat-out insults.
Bucky shakes his head. “No. I mean, sure, at first it was a little weird just because I thought he had been keeping this secret from me for so long, but I don’t even think Steve realized he’s gay or whatever until things between you guys started. I really don’t care who Steve shacks up with as long as they treat him right and make him happy.”
"Stark, what are you doing?!" the second baseman yells, but Tony can hardly hear it. He keeps his eye on the ball and in his periphery he can see the center fielder slow to a stop, knowing he isn't close enough. Tony stretches his arm out and catches the ball, clutching it in his glove before rolling to the ground to slow his momentum. He pops back up, holding the ball up in his glove victoriously. Cheering erupts, and out is called, and he can't wipe the grin off his face as he sees Rogers' surprise that he had dared to go after the ball.
Tony winces. His most positive coaching experiences thus far have both come from women, but it’s not like the bigoted fans were going to recognize that anytime soon. No matter how intelligent, strong, charismatic, and successful both Carol and Natasha are, they have to work ten times as hard to be recognized than any of the male coaches in the leagues.
Natasha’s poise melts a little and she sighs. “We’ll see. I don’t want to play you in every game for right now. We want to give that knee of yours some TLC as long as we can before we really need you for the actual season. Just rest up, okay? You’ll see the field when I know it’s worth it. Now hit the showers already, you smell awful.”
“My bed, where do you think?” Tony deadpans. “I have manners, I’m not going to suck you off on the couch like I’m some
Steve comes back to consciousness with a slight jolt, feeling a hand remove itself from his shoulder as he finally gets up. He wipes a hand down his face, straightening up from where he had slumped down in the seat. Tony is standing in the aisle next to him with his backpack hanging off one shoulder. He’s got Steve’s duffel in one hand, tossing it unceremoniously onto his lap. “Come on, slow poke, this is the end of the line.”
“Who died and made you Captain?” Tony hears Nancy mutter under his breath, the Atlanta-based player crossing his arms.
"Good evening, everyone. Unfortunately, Chester Phillips couldn't make it tonight to moderate the questions, but I'll be here in his place. I'd like to introduce—"
The rest of the kids appear to be a little older than Annie, the two arguing brothers standing at the top of the sledding hill with their hands on their hips. One of them, the taller of the two, squints harder as Annie approaches, realization dawning on his face. “Holy shit!”
He watches Stand By Me that night on his newly repaired VCR, curled up on his ugly-but-comfortable brown monstrosity of a couch with his afghan that still vaguely smells of citrus shampoo.
He isn’t caught reminiscing for the rest of their warm ups, using his break time to joke around with Bucky or Jack. Dugan alternates between talking off to the side with Hodges and sitting in the dugout, chatting with whichever players are on break, gauging his team’s emotional levels going into the game. The six hours fly by and before he knows it, they’re lined up in the tunnel post-Peggy Carter Pep Talk, Steve fifth from the front. He’s set to start as a third baseman, with the possibility of subbing in as a shortstop during the latter innings depending on his alternate’s performance more than his own. Bucky is slated in center field, a position where he’s really prone to shine, a real knockout player when it comes to getting balls back into the infield.
“Hey, I don’t need Nat chewing me out asking what’s taking you so long,” he teases. They share a fond smile and Steve lets himself drift out of the locker room, leaving whatever brief moment of respite he and Tony had behind.
