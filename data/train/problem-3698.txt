A gentle hand was placed on his chest. His heart was pounding so loudly he could barely hear anything. It was dark, but his eyes were slowly adjusting to his surroundings. The gentle hand moved off his chest and removed his restraints that Dean could now see were bed sheets. He was still panting as he looked around the room.
"Uh, thanks," Dean answered, but he could hardly look Crowley in the eye. Of course this is the when they suddenly appeared. They couldn't have done that any time sooner?
And then he got high. And hot damn. It's like getting drunk but easier, and it lasts longer. There are a few differences in getting high versus getting drunk, but mostly it made him feel happier—and more importantly—made him forget his situation. Becoming human. The Apocalypse. Dean hardly noticing him anymore. None of it mattered.
"Dean," Cas manages weakly. Cas reaches out for Dean. Hope spreads through his chest. Maybe Cas can make one thing right before he goes.
Castiel took a step towards the box. He stopped, no doubt reading its inscription. "You didn't touch it, did you?" He spun to look at me.
Dean grabs both of Cas' hands. "You're all I have left," Dean says. And it's soft and almost broken.
Castiel glares at Dean, but he immediately feels bad when he sees Dean holding his jacket out for him. “Oh, Dean. You don’t—”
"I'm getting some sleep." Sam ignored Dean's stare as he sat on the bed and began taking his shoes off.
Cas smiles sadly at him again and turns away. Cas does that a lot now. Smile sad. He's done it ever since he got back from the Empty. Dean thinks Cas misses being an angel.
Dean shakes his head and swallows his food. “No. I, uh…” He takes a sip of his drink. “I was in prison during that time actually, so, uh, no.”
Dean suddenly pulled him into a hug. "I know. But I don't want to lose you. I can't lose you. Not again." His voice broke.
He couldn't let Cas know he had...feelings...or whatever for him. That was something he buried deep down, but it was all threatening to come out. Shit. What was happening? Everything was still spinning, and things kept happening that took Dean too long to register.
in the sidewalk until it’s too late. He tries to swerve out of the way, but only manages to fall right into it. He holds out his arms to cushion his fall and there’s a loud
Dean sighed in frustration. He didn't want to talk about it. About anything. The fight with Sam. The way Cas always seemed to be able to make Dean feel special. He didn't want to deal with
Cas pulled his arms free, and Dean's back was cold as Cas stopped touching him and moved away. Dean rolled onto his back and opened his eyes. Cas was sitting next to him on his motel bed. And glaring.
Cas started walking away. Quickly. Cas was somehow already by the sidewalk. Dean tried to catch up, but one moment he was following Cas, and the next he was on the ground. He didn't even remember falling. All he knew was he was now laying on the street looking up at the night sky.
Dean nudges one of Castiel’s feet with his one of his own. “Well, yeah. I couldn’t miss the concert!”
Dean pulls away for just enough space to kiss Cas again. Cas kisses back. He'll never get high again if it means he can have Dean like this.
Castiel looked between the two brothers with narrowed eyes. "You think we had sex," he stated while looking at Sam.
Garth holds up his hands. “Whoa, whoa. Dude, take all the time you need. The orchestra isn’t going anywhere.”
"Yeah. You have a weird nature thing," Dean says. He doesn't want to ruin this by making it overly sappy. He also doesn't think he could handle it if it was any sappier.
Dean continues, “The kid, the baby, it wasn’t—it was never mine. It belongs to some douchebag she met in high school.” Dean can’t look at Cas, so he glares out the window. No more tears come. He feels like he’s cried them all out. He feels…he’s just
Cas looked just how he did when he left. Had he even gotten to second base? Dean frowned. He took one last swig of whiskey before setting it down.
"You look like hell," Dean comments and walks closer. "Are you sick?" He suddenly stops in front of the bed and scowls. "What are you on?"
Dean rolled his eyes. "I don't know why it bothers you so much." Honestly. It was Dean's life, and if he wanted to get drunk to feel better, he's allowed to.
Anger spikes through his chest. Been a while since he's felt that. "I'm not!" Cas shouts back. "Why do you think I'm
Dean flips him off and tugs Cas’ shirt over his head before walking back over to the couch and sitting next to Cas.
He stares at his phone. He’s really selling his piano. Castiel isn’t quite sure how to feel about it, so he blindly reaches for his wine bottle and finds it. He brings it to his lips and swallows before looking back down at his phone. Everything is horrible.
It isn't a normal stare. It's intense. It's as if Cas is studying every inch of Dean's face. Dean feels himself blush and quickly turns away. He places the whisks in the sink and takes a few more sips (okay, more like gulps) from the whiskey. Cas is staring at him again.
Lisa bites her lip to hide a smile before speaking, “I was just in town and heard you moved here, so I thought I’d drop by.” Dean ignores the warning bells going off in his head. He should be wondering how Lisa found him exactly, but he doesn’t care.
It was a simple gesture, but one of the kindest things anyone had ever done for Dean. Or one of the best that Dean could think of right now. Who else would do this? Cas always went out of his way for Dean.
Castiel nods and eats another spoonful. He can sense an awkward silence coming. “What about your brother? Sam? Does he live in town?”
Dean needs help. That’s clear with the belittling thoughts he’s voicing. Dean doesn’t have high self-esteem, if he even has it at all. Dean needs someone there for him. Someone who understands him like no one else does. “Have you talked to Sam about this?” Castiel asks.
It takes so much more to get a good high now. Every day he has to take a little something. Every time he feels himself coming down, the anxiety is almost paralyzing. He begins to
"Yeah, I got that," I replied, forcing my mind back to the present. And the cold. "Can you get to healing me? I'm getting cold." I waited as he still held his hand on my chest. "Cas?"
Now what? A drink. He needed a drink. Dean glanced over at the nightstand where Cas had placed the bottle of whiskey the night before. It was gone.
I shake Cas awake. He sits up, and I step back as I wait for him to come back to reality. He takes a few minutes to get his breathing under control, but the second his eyes regain their clarity, I grab his arm and jerk him off the couch.
Castiel is confused. Dean has nothing to do with his food and sleeping situation. "What do you mean?"
Cas is lying on his side, with one of his arms outstretched where Dean was. His hair is messy, and he looks so at peace like this. Cas shifts again, but still doesn’t wake up. Dean wishes he could take a picture, but he’ll just have to settle on his memory. Dean quietly closes the door behind him and uses the restroom. He brushes his teeth just in case.
Dean eventually pulls away when his pride finally returns and reminds him how weak he’s being. Dean swallows. “Sorry.” He looks at his shoes.
"It's a long story. I really just want some sleep right now." Sam's voice still sounded tired. At least the color was back in his cheeks.
Castiel is helping Dean wash the dishes one night when Dean says, “I’m, uh, I’m gonna be busy Tuesday nights.”
We get into the kitchen, and wow. The other parts of the house pale in comparison to this. This room is
Dean sighed. He knew Cas' interpretation of him following Dean's instructions probably varied from what actually happened.
Cas frowns in thought. He remembers being stabbed by an angel blade. He places his hand over his injury. He can't remember much after that. He knows he killed the angel who attacked him, but it all gets hazy.
Castiel holds his breath in anticipation. But nothing. Dean doesn’t even acknowledge the message. Well,
The kitchen is bare except for a toaster, a blender, a knife set, and a towel rack. There’s a single picture on the refrigerator, and Castiel walks over to it. It’s a picture of Dean next to another man just a few years younger than he is in a graduation cap and gown. They’re both smiling, and Dean looks
Then he realizes it's snowing. Cas smiles. He loves the snow. It's so beautiful. He raises his hand up to let some snowflakes fall into his open palm.
Castiel blinks up in surprise. Garth smiles reassuringly, and Castiel takes the sheet music. He stares down at it. It’s not the most difficult thing he’s ever played. He can learn this by Christmas time. He looks back up, and Garth is still smiling.
And that’s how I got a room at the cabin. Cas never uses it since he doesn’t sleep, so it’s mine now.
. Dean looks up at his face with wide eyes, but Cas is watching the movie. Dean sits back in his seat and tries not to have a heart attack. He has no idea what happens the rest of the movie; he’s too overwhelmed with the fact that he’s holding Cas’ fucking hand.
He grabbed the back of Cas' head and pulled Cas fully on top of him. Dean now lay completely on the asphalt, but he didn't care. He wanted to be as close to Cas as possible. Dean wanted to erase all those times where they had barely touched with something so much better.
I set Jack’s car on top of the LEGO container, which is now next to the rest of his toys. Spoiled kid. I never had this many toys. Ever. I can’t help but smile. I guess I’m doing something right if his childhood is nothing like mine.
Castiel feels like he broke his hand again. When did Dean get a girlfriend? When had he decided to start a family? Castiel knew a long time ago that Dean is a family man. It’s obvious. He cherishes his relationship with Sam, and he’s even friends with Sam’s wife Eileen. Dean is selfless and loves the company of those he’s close with. He’s a protector and caregiver. He’s extremely loyal and loves helping other people. It’s as if Dean was made to help others.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean quickly pushes the blanket away and stands up, looking at Castiel with wide eyes.
He grabs his second wine bottle of the night to pour another glass, but realizes it’s pointless. He should just drink from the bottle. So he does. He gulps down a good third of the bottle before dizzily setting it down. Maybe that was too much. He giggles. He’s so clumsy right now. He pushes himself away from the counter, and his eyes land on the piano.
Eventually, people start leaving, and soon it’s just me, Cas, Sam, and Eileen. Cas and I decided to stay the night, and we put Jack to bed about fifteen minutes ago.
As Castiel walks back outside, he finally feels as if he’s taking a step in the right direction. Maybe he’s finally getting his life together.
Castiel took a step closer. "You're scaring me." Dean still wouldn't look at him. "I can't help if you don't talk to me," Castiel tried again. He attempted to make his tone soft and light. He wanted Dean to feel safe, like he could talk to him.
Cas smiled at the ground, and his cheeks turned pink. Dear god. Cas had this in the bag. Hell, this was making Dean feel... Well, he wasn't sure what, but it was warm and bubbly.
in here? The meals I could cook in a kitchen like this. I set down the bags on the island in frustration. Cas can’t even cook. What a waste.
He stood up and stumbled into the bathroom. Dean clumsily took his clothes off, turned on the shower, and stepped in. The cold water caused him to gasp, but it helped. The fuzziness to his thoughts started to go away. Dean wondered what Sam was doing. He wasn't surprised he was gone after their fight last night.
Castiel can tell Dean is getting uncomfortable, but he has no idea how to make this better. “I used to be in a cult,” Castiel blurts.
“What are you wearing?” I ask like a dumbass. Seeing him out of his regular outfit is…it’s not weird, but it’s…I don’t know. Not normal?
I thought I was going to die. Like, for good this time. It all happened so fast. I just had to touch the mysterious little box. I don't even know why it had piqued my curiosity so much. There was something...off about it. It was small and made of gray stone. Enochian was etched in intricate loops across its lid. To the untrained eye, the letters would've appeared to be decorative carvings. I felt drawn to it. I was struck with the urge to pick up the box
“How irresponsible I’m being, and how I’m unequipped to be a…to raise a kid.” Dean swallows, and his eyes flit around the hallway, refusing to look at Castiel.
“Thank you.” Cas grins at the floor. “I know I keep saying it, but…well, no one’s come to one of my concerts before.”
I follow Cas down the stairs. Unloading the car with an angel is easy, and we get everything into the cabin in one trip. The inside of the house looks even better than the outside. The small hallway in the entryway is a bit bare; no pictures on the walls or anything, but as we pass a room with a couch and a tv, I notice that every horizontal surface has at least one plant on it. I always knew Cas was a nature guy but, damn.
It’s still smiling at me. Its smile fades slightly as it tilts its head curiously at me. My breath is caught in my throat. That looks…that looks like
He'd never know how I felt about him. I knew I couldn't tell him. I was never good at saying how I felt. But I could show him. If I was going to die, I was going to kiss Castiel before I went. I looked up at him, and all the courage I felt two seconds ago melted away, but I'd hate myself if I went to my grave without him knowing. He met my gaze. My adrenaline picked up. I don't even think I felt this way about my first kiss.
Dean glared at the angel. "I swear we need to get you a bell or something, so you'll stop giving me heart attacks."
“He’s fine,” Cas says dismissively. He returns to unbagging groceries. “I know what he sounds like when he needs a diaper change or to be fed.”
Castiel has never broken so many traffic laws in the name of speed before. His new Jeep is amazing. When he gets back, he sees the Impala in her usual spot. How had Dean beaten him? He races to his room, throws on pajamas, and goes up the stairs two at a time. The door’s unlocked, and Castiel lets himself in. Christmas music is softly playing in the background and something sweet like pastries is cooking.
Cas' eyes narrowed in suspicion. That was also cute. Everything Cas did was kinda cute anyway, if Dean was being honest with himself.
"Okay," Dean says and turns away. He walks to the door but stops. He looks back at Cas. There's...something written on his face, but Cas can't make it out through the high. "Get some rest, Cas." Dean leaves and shuts the door behind him.
“Sounds like a lot of fun actually,” Dean says. “I don’t remember the last time I even watched a Christmas movie.”
Castiel now knows it’s a 1967 Chevrolet Impala. Dean spent an entire night talking about his car. As Castiel thought before: heterosexual. Dean unlocks the car and they both get in. It’s very clean inside, and the seats look brand new.
"Good. Because I don't think I can take it. Especially now." Dean pulls away just enough to look in Cas' eyes, his arms still wrapped around Cas. "You mean so much to me."
Dean lets Cas pull him up and lead him to his apartment. He still can’t look Cas in the face. Cas guides Dean into the bathroom and sits him on the toilet. He places a box of tissues on Dean’s lap. Dean wipes his eyes and blows his nose. He bites his lip in frustration.
Castiel can’t help but wonder how the brothers ended up so differently. Dean is obviously a mechanic by his outfit and lives in a small apartment. Castiel isn’t judging. His situation is very similar to Dean’s, but he can’t help but be curious. Dean doesn’t seem to hate Sam like Castiel does his family.
And before Dean really knew what was happening, his back was against the truck, Marco's hands on his hips. Hot breath hit his face before Marco's mouth was on his. Dean closed his eyes and let himself get carried away. The kiss was all tongue and desire. Dean grabbed Marco's hair, and he imagined he was kissing someone else. Someone with dark hair instead of blond.
In his mind, he’s sitting at a table eating dinner. He can’t quite make out what the food is, but it tastes super good.
the day I’ve had.” I tell him my story, but I tactfully leave out the part about Jack’s, uh, first word. I’m still hoping that’s a one-time thing.
Dean leans in and kisses him again. It's needy and hot, and Cas has to pull away too soon again. He hates being this injured. It's really starting to be quite inconvenient.
Because, no. No, he is not going to be okay. Not unless he can spend every day watching movies with Cas for the rest of his life. …Alright, that might be a
Dean doesn't want to. He wants to save this soft, happy moment forever. Just a sweet, unplanned moment with him and his angel.
Garth shrugs nonchalantly and pulls a set of keys out of his pants pocket. “Anyway, that’s been dealt with. Police finished cleaning up on Tuesday.”
Having no time for Cas has nearly destroyed Dean. But he can do it. For his kid. Dean tried to be rude to Cas, so it would hurt less to keep ignoring him. It didn’t work. Cas is…Cas is so
Something warm was wrapped around Dean's torso. It felt nice. Whatever it was moved and tightened its grip on Dean. He was being held. His back was pressed against someone's chest, and Dean realized he liked being the little spoon. He felt safe and warm. Dean tried to go back to sleep since he was comfortable, but his mind decided he was going to stay awake, so he just laid there with his eyes closed, enjoying the quiet moment.
Castiel only has his toiletries and a little bit of food plus his sleeping bag stored back at work. He does have enough money to buy more of that, though. He also doesn't want to go back to work.
Castiel isn't exactly sure what makes a bar a protein bar. "Yes? It was crumbly." He hopes his description is helpful.
The other part was Cas. Dean was pretty sure he was falling for the angel. And Cas didn't feel the same. And it hurt like a bitch. He never knew he could feel so lonely while being right next to someone. It was like one part of Dean never wanted to leave Cas' side. He was so happy around Cas, and Cas made him feel things in a way he never had. But the other part of him never wanted to see Cas again. It was so painful seeing the person he wanted the most right next to him, but never being able to have him.
Cas groans and covers his face. "My body is struggling to get there, but yes." He removes his hands to see Dean staring. This is so embarrassing. Fuck it. He's definitely getting high tonight after this. "Whatever," he mumbles. "This isn't worth it."
His life is shit now. He doesn’t have Dean. He doesn’t have music. He doesn’t have a car. He doesn’t have anything.
Dean nods. “Yeah. You don’t play the piano anymore. Your car is gone. I never see you. I thought—” His voice cracks, and he looks at the ceiling.
Right. Of course. What else would Cas be talking about? That's when it hit Dean just how cold it was outside. He'd left his jacket inside, so he only had his flannel, t-shirt, and jeans to protect him from the cold. He didn't want to go back inside, though. Not where he'd be sitting too close to Cas in insufferable silence. So Dean crossed his arms as a way to warm up. It barely helped.
made Dean feel like someone punched him. He just wanted to touch Cas' face. Maybe run his thumb over his lips... Lips. Dean was staring at Cas' lips. Dean immediately wrenched his eyes back up to meet Cas', but he could feel heat rising in his cheeks. He had to get out of this situation
Dean took this moment of confusion to grab the holy water from his jacket pocket, spray the demon, take the blade from his chest, and behead the son of a bitch. Dean sat up and watched the demon's head roll to the ground, black smoke jettisoning out of the useless meat suit. Dean breathed heavily and looked down.
Nightly dinners with Dean return, and Castiel has never been happier. Getting to come back from work to be with Dean makes him feel lighter. Whenever something unexpected happens during his day, it’s less of a bad thing and more of a story he’ll get to tell Dean later. And, instead of just dinner with Dean, they watch movies, too. Castiel has never seen
Castiel instantly feels concern tighten his chest. He can't help it. He knows what Dean does, and sometimes he can't sleep because he worries Dean is dying somewhere and needs his help. But Castiel can't help. "What's going on, Dean?" Castiel asks.
It’s probably been a bit too easy to work all the time. But not working leads to thinking. Like thinking about what Cas had said to him in the hallway.
. But apparently it was. How could Dean do this? And is this somehow Castiel’s fault? Should he have helped out with dinners more? Is he too awkward? Is he annoying?
"Dean," Cas says softly. He feels that if he's too loud, he'll break this moment like glass. He doesn't want this to end.
"But that's not what bothered me. I mean, I'm used to torture like that, seeing the people I love in pain. But you... You were happy."
When they reach the parking lot to their complex, Dean’s heart plummets. He sees the flat tire and is reminded at how shitty things really are. Cas parks and shuts the Jeep off.
Dean wasn't going to lie and say things had been going great between them either. They'd been bickering more and more during hunts ever since Sam took up the trials. In reality, Dean was worried for Sam's health. The trials were really taking a toll on his little brother, and he couldn't lose Sam. Not after everything. Dean hadn't meant for his anger to be taken out on Sam. His stress kept coming out in short bursts of anger. But it was no excuse. Dean had stupidly taken his anger out on Sam, and Sam thought it was just Dean being angry that he took on the trials instead of Dean.
Dean finally looks over at Cas, and Cas is rummaging in the cabinet below the sink. His hair is longer, and small curls are forming at the base of his neck. Dean wonders if they’re soft. Cas also looks like he lost weight, even though he didn’t need to before. Cas pulls a first-aid kit out of the cabinet.
He follows a nicely dressed couple inside a big building that doesn’t look as artsy as Dean was picturing. He presents his ticket to the lady at the door scanning them with a gun-looking thingy. She scans the barcode on Dean’s ticket with a beep and tells him to have fun. He’ll try. Dean’s seat should be in the middle of the theater, and he easily finds his row, but has to awkwardly scoot past everyone who’s already seated on his way. It’s ten million times more embarrassing than at the movie theater.
Castiel has always had poor taste when it comes to romance. He’s only been in one long-term relationship. Her name was Meg. They met in college. He wasn’t looking for anything serious, and neither was she. They became friends with benefits or whatever the term is for someone you sleep with regularly but don’t date. But…as time went on, feelings started happening. Castiel can’t really place when, but soon they weren’t just sleeping together. He still remembers the first time he took Meg on an official date. She was surprised. Castiel thought she was going to be angry. She wasn’t. Castiel is pretty sure he loved her. But then she had to get into that stupid fucking car crash and get herself killed. Castiel almost didn’t finish college, but he knew Meg would be mad at him if he didn’t. He misses her terribly, and despite her death being almost five years ago, Castiel hasn’t dated anyone since. He’d ask Dean out if the man didn’t scream heterosexual. But, whatever. Castiel is still allowed to pine over men he can’t have. Plus, he gets free dinners, so he can’t complain.
Cas looks down, and his smile somehow gets wider. “I don’t know about that, but I’m glad you liked it.”
It just left Dean's mouth without warning. He always liked when Cas did that, but when he did it while they were
Dean put a hand over the one on his face. His next words came out as a soft whisper, "These things never happen to me." He inwardly cursed at the tears threatening to form.
His gaze becomes wistful, and he turns to look into the kitchen. “Didn’t you say you were making spaghetti?”
watches Dean sleep, but Cas thinks the gesture is touching. Dean's worried about Cas. The idea makes him feel a little better.
"The counter," Dean says quietly. In one swift movement, Cas switches their positions and pulls Dean back to him. "Wait, Cas."
I’ve always been a family guy. I can’t deny it. It started when I tried to keep Dad and Sam from arguing, and it’s only grown since. My family has expanded over the years, and it’s all that’s ever mattered to me.
There’s a long pause, and Castiel thinks Naomi hung up on him, but then she says, “Then perhaps you should consider leaving the band. We’ll have to have a replacement for you in the upcoming concert now.”
"Uh..." I swallowed nervously to hide how scared I was. I crossed my arms over my chest in an attempt to get warmer. It didn't work, and I tried to keep myself from shivering. "I dropped that box." I nodded down at the box laying sideways on the ground. I bit my lip to keep my teeth from chattering. Was the cold getting worse?
It happens again. Cas wakes up the baby, and he cries too. Again. I wake Cas up, and he pulls himself together a little quicker than last time.
Garth leads them to an office. Scores are littered on every inch of the desk, and the bookshelf in the corner is cluttered with trophies, books, and stuffed animals. Pictures adorn the walls. Each one is of a group of people with a year on the bottom. Castiel guesses it’s the orchestra.
Overall, I think I did a good job with the food. Everyone compliments me and Jody on the cooking, and we eat almost everything. We play a few board games, and Cas drinks too much wine and keeps losing. It’s funny.
The waitress places a receipt on the table. Castiel realizes he's doesn't know how to pay like this. Dean takes his wallet out and places his credit card on the receipt. That's when Castiel notices there's just one receipt.
Dean’s smile widens, but he tries to hide it by looking away and standing up. He stretches, exposing a sliver of skin just above his slacks, before walking down the hall. Castiel watches him leave before lying down on the couch and closing his eyes.
Dean laughs. It’s beautiful and warm and makes Castiel feel bubbly. Dean looks back at Castiel. “You’re kind of a dork, you know that?”
Sam being gone. Dean was sick of fighting his brother and would do anything to have Sam with him right now. He missed him. And he was sick of always feeling confused around Cas. Why couldn't he be normal and just set his feelings straight? And then, of course, there was himself. Sam wouldn't be gone because of him. Dean wouldn't have these weird feelings with Cas if he'd shoved them down properly in the first place. But he didn't say all that. Instead, Dean glanced up at Cas. The angel was staring down at him in concern.
Sam's shoulders were slumped, and the bruises and scratches Dean could see shone in stark contrast to Sam's pale skin.
Garth turns on the lights and grins. “It’s nice to meet ya, man. We are in desperate need of a pianist.”
“Thank you,” Castiel says automatically before realizing he’s wearing Dean’s. “Do you want it back?” he asks stupidly.
? When had he become so vulnerable around Cas? The only other person who saw him like this was Sam. Sam... Dean fucking missed him.
Jack wakes up a few hours later, but he’s still a little tired and doesn’t do much. He doesn’t say anything either, and I think I’m in the clear.
Cas rolls his eyes and steps outside. “It was annoying trying to keep the suit and trench coat clean while taking care of a baby.” He slips into a pair of flip flops on the porch I didn’t notice before. “I don’t expect you to understand.”
But Castiel regrets agreeing to go with Dean the second his alarm sounds the next morning. He makes an angry sound, muffled by the blankets. He blindly reaches for his phone and taps it until the sound stops. He burrows under the covers and begins to drift off just as his second alarm rings. Castiel grabs his phone angrily and squints at the brightness, shutting off the alarm. He puts his pillow over his head and sighs. Why did he agree to do this again? Oh, yeah, because his neighbor has a nice ass.
. Breaking your hand isn’t like breaking your arm or your leg. Hands are complicated. There are a lot of little bones in there. When Castiel went to the doctor, he thought he’d just get a cast, and he’d be done. But no. He had to get fucking surgery. He had to wait a whole week to get it, too. They had to rebreak the bones and everything to align them properly. Castiel was a total anxious mess the night before his surgery and—unwisely—got very drunk to cope with that anxiety.
to shove his feelings away. But now…now he just feels nothing. It’s as if his emotions have left on their own. Only to be seen when they’re ready to come out. Dean thinks that day might never come. He hopes it won’t ever come. Because he knows when it does, it’s going to
"Huh?" Dean looked down and saw his hands were clutched onto Cas' shirt. Then he saw Cas was straddling him. Oh god. His breath hitched.
Dean shrugs. “That’s fine. I mean, I’m sure I’m loud sometimes, so, uh, just tell me if I am. And I’ll tell you if you’re annoying, too.”
I bring my free hand down on the thing’s small torso, holding it still. In the moonlight, I see it smile. It watches my hand on its chest before reaching for it. One of its tiny hands grips my pinky. I close my eyes. It just
But it wasn't fine, and Dean fought to push down the loneliness bubbling up his throat. He managed to keep it together until he got onto the highway. Tears prickled his vision, and his throat tightened from fighting back his emotions.
"No!" Dean didn't want the hug to end, so he held on tighter. "You're warm." It was true. Cas was like the perfect bed. Soft and warm.
Dean looks back at Cas. Cas' eyes flick down Dean's body. Arousal strikes through Dean, and he tightens his grip on Cas' hand. Dean realizes Cas probably didn't mean for him to see that. Cas' immediately looks back up at Dean and blushes. Damn. It's cute.
Dean rolls his eyes. He finds Cas' naivety endearing most of the time. Cute even. But Dean doesn't call other men cute.
Castiel wakes to insistent knocking. He groans, and the world spins. He has a horrible headache, his mouth is dry, and it feels as if he drank a cup of battery acid. He grabs the glass of water from his nightstand and takes a few sips as he stumbles down the hallway. He feels a little better.
Castiel looks down from the sky to see Dean staring at him. He has a small smile on his face, and his eyes are lit with...something. His nose and cheeks are pink, softening the usual hard lines on his face. It's...cute. The image of Dean smiling at him in the swirling snow makes Castiel feel warm inside. Contentment...no. Happiness. And a little bit of excitement.
I look down, and the stupid baby is smiling at me again, still reaching for me. It makes a small, excited noise and wiggles its fingers. I bring it to my chest again.
He never thought he'd have this either. He knows he's going to mess this up somehow, but he can't think about that right now. All he knows is this is happening, and Cas is...Cas is holding him like he's the most precious thing in the world.
, and Dean's heart is soaring. He pulls back just far enough to whisper, "I love you so much." before kissing Cas again, a little more desperately this time.
Dean wakes up, and he can't remember where he is. He knows it isn't the bunker. He feels a body next to him. He's not even fully awake, and he can't bring himself to remember who he's in bed with. Damn. It's been a while since he's had a one-night stand. Loneliness stabs him in the chest, and he shifts towards the warmth of the person beside him. He reaches on arm out, and touches their back. He snakes a hand around their waist and pulls himself against them. Dean feels them begin to stir.
problem. You’re the one who signed up to raise it.” I instantly regret saying it and guilt bubbles up my throat.
Dean looked up. "The spell the witches put me under." He swallowed and backed up. He went to the rear of the car and put the cap back on the fuel tank. Castiel followed.
"You're telling me this fearless leader thing is all an act?" Cas asks. He's staring at their hands.
"I'm fine," Cas returns with a glare. Maybe Dean will fuck off. Cas doesn't like being looked at like this. Maybe he shouldn't have gotten
Dean shakes his head. "No, I do, I just…I thought I made that up. Because I—I want…" He licks his lips. "I want you."
Dean felt one of Cas' hands rest on his right hip, and Dean moved both arms around Cas' neck, pulling their bodies together. Cas' other hand somehow made its way under Dean's shirt, and desire immediately ran through his body like lightning. Fuck. If they didn't stop now, Dean would keep going. He pushed Cas away, and they broke apart.
He’s trembling, and I realize he’s crying. “Whoa, hey,” I say softly and pull back. He ducks his face from me, so I gently lift his chin to look up at me. “You’re the best person he can have. You know that, right?”
Cas really was incredible. He was such a beautiful, strong angel. But also so cute at the same time. Dean saw his bed and tried to step towards it, but almost fell again. Cas' arm was around his waist. It felt really nice. Dean put both his arms around Cas. He was warm and smelled like rain. He was like a strong fortress. He was home. Dean wanted to stay like this forever.
Cas sits up straighter and studies his friend. He isn't sure what brought on this shift in behavior. "Yes?"
Castiel figured out a long time ago the way he felt for Dean wasn't plutonic. He also knew Dean didn't feel the same way, so he never said anything. He didn't want to ruin their friendship. He'd take what he could get. But now... Castiel opened his mouth to say something when Dean parked the car in the motel parking lot and said,
They went through an old town, and Cas found a pharmacy that was practically untouched. He got supplies that would last him months. He was very happy that day.
I glance at the clock, and any sympathy I had for Cas is immediately replaced with anger. Are you serious? It’s almost 2:30am, and Cas is calling me about something that isn’t really an issue. “Don’t see how that’s
Dean suddenly stood up. His chair scraping loudly, breaking the silence like glass. Cas looked up at him. His blue eyes filled with surprise. Dean looked away, so he'd stop wondering what those eyes looked like up close.
He looks up at the beams on the ceiling, struggling to swallow the blood in his mouth. He wishes this isn't the last thing he'll see before he dies. He always knew this day would come, but he didn't want it to be today. There are so many things he still wants to do.
Dean keeps cooking, and Castiel is having a serious problem with looking at anything other than where Dean’s shirt is unbuttoned. But Dean is too preoccupied in cooking to notice Castiel, so what’s the harm?
Castiel stares down at it in surprise. He was under the impression Dean was going to give him the food, and then he’d leave, but the bowl is full of what looks like soup containing noodles, vegetables, and chicken.
The moment ends when Dean's phone rings. Dean pulls away from Cas, but keeps one arm around him. He doesn't want to break contact with him. Dean rolls his eyes as he sees Sam's name on the screen.
“Run that by me again,” Dean says and crosses his arms. They’re standing in the living room. Dean had been clearing the table after dinner when Lisa told him.
Dean looked away. It wasn't just the fights with Sam. A big part of it was. He hated when Sam left him. He'd never say it, but Dean always felt that one day Sam would leave him for good. Sam didn't need Dean. His days in college made that clear. So what was stopping him from dropping it all now and moving on?
Dean zipped up his bag, grabbed the takeout bag, and looked back up at Cas. Cas sat with his legs crossed on the bed, and his eyes glued to Dean. Damn, he was cute.
He turns back to get more mix, but Cas is standing right there. Dean's breath catches in his throat. They're really close. They're so close it would take Dean barely any effort at all to lean forward and... Dean snaps his eyes up from staring at Cas' lips.
Castiel doesn’t remember falling asleep and blinks blurrily at the television. Movies with Dean are getting harder and harder to watch with his worsening vision. He squints at the television before realizing it’s paused then looks up in Dean’s direction. Dean’s smiling down at him warmly, amusement lighting his eyes.
Castiel looked at the ground. He could feel his embarrassment spreading up into his face before he even answered. "Almost as long as I've known you."
Feelings. That is the best and worst thing about being human. Castiel has never felt more elated, giddy, and happy but sad, desperate, and lonely all this intensely or this close together. The span of emotions he experiences in one day is more than he's felt...probably ever. And to make everything worse, Dean is back.
Cas is a wizard at the piano. The ceiling between Cas and Dean hardly muffles the sounds from the piano, but Dean doesn’t care. The music Cas plays is
When Cas is sober, all he is reminded of is what Dean was like before. Happy. Warm. Loyal. Human. Everything he's not now. It destroys Cas every time.
It’s not like he’s suddenly horny or anything from the piano playing. It’s much more than that. He wants Cas in every possible way. In all the sappy ways. He wants to hold hands. Hug. Watch movies together. Sleep in the same bed. Wake up next to Cas, his hair a mess and a cute scowl on his face because it’s too early. He wants to go to the farmers’ market with Cas every weekend. He wants to keep cooking dinner for Cas every night. Dean wants to kiss Cas.
Dean cleared his throat. Obviously. "Right." He glanced at the guy. "Sorry," he said sheepishly and pushed him away.
"We'll fix this, okay?" Dean says, pressing a hand on Cas' wound to stop some of the bleeding. "Just stay with me." Dean squeezes one of Cas' hands.
"It will be a little difficult with this." Cas grabs Dean's hand and places on his growing erection. He knows he wouldn't even be close to having this confidence while sober. He sees Dean swallow, but Dean doesn't move.
"You liking me," Dean said, and he could feel himself blushing. Again. For like the millionth time that day. He felt like a thirteen-year-old girl.
Castiel sets an alarm for his phone at 6:00 but then decides that won’t be enough since he hates mornings. He sets an alarm for 5:30 and 5:45 in addition to the 6:00 one. Hopefully, he’ll be up by then.
Castiel is slammed with insecurity. She’s beautiful in a commanding way. And Castiel is still in his clothes from yesterday, probably looking haggard from his night of drinking. “Yes?”
He saw Cas last night? He wracked his brain for the memory, but couldn't find it. Shit. He hoped he hadn't said anything stupid.
He's lying on top of his sheets, covered in sweat. He's finally doing it. He's finally getting sober. After what Dean said, Cas tried to stop using. It wasn't easy, and he had to slowly lower himself off the drugs, but today is his first day with nothing.
Dean grins and grabs a mug, pouring a fresh cup of coffee into it. He slides the mug over to Cas. Cas squints at it before picking it up and taking a sip. Cas finishes the whole cup by the time Dean finishes the omelets.
"I love you," he murmured. Then immediately tensed. He had not meant to say that. It had just tumbled out. Dammit. It was so typical of him getting ahead of things like this and ruining them.
Dean avoided looking Cas in the eyes. "No," Dean dismissed. "Do you want to talk about what happened?"
Dean picks the first action movie he sees. He and Cas are sitting on his bed. Their shoulders are touching. It would take barely any effort for Dean to rest his head on Cas' shoulder. He doesn't.
Someone’s arm is wrapped around Dean’s waist, and his back is pressed against something warm and solid. He’s in bed with someone. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever been the little spoon before, and it’s nice. Warm breath falls on the back of his neck, and everything is perfect. Until he
Dean finally catches up. The movie is already playing in this theater, and they almost don’t find seats. It’s a kids’ movie, but Dean is downright
Dean turns around. Cas is standing at the entrance of the kitchen. Dean smiles. He's glad Cas is here. Maybe he'll even be able to spend some time with the angel. Probably not, though. Cas doesn't make it a habit to stay.
Cas smiles. It’s soft and warm. He grabs the tissue box from the counter and hands it to Dean and says, “You can use my sink to clean up if you need to.”
Bobby had asked why Dean’s suddenly working so much. Dean told him. Bobby had stared at Dean for a long second before saying, “Dammit, boy!” and stomping off. Bobby apologized later, but Dean thinks he knows why Bobby reacted the way he did. Anyone can tell this was unplanned. It was reckless and stupid. Dean is still unprepared, but he’s slowly getting there. Every day he’s getting closer and closer to being ready to become a dad. And, honestly, drowning himself in work has helped
earlier for fuck's sake. And now Cas was apologizing? Why had Dean freaked out again? Everything was fine.
look. He forced himself to focus on changing and brushing his teeth. He couldn't think about the expression on Cas' face. Or how closely it resembled desire. And how important it was to Dean. Cas was probably gone now anyway. He always left sooner than Dean liked. Dean left the bathroom thinking he was alone, but paused when he saw Cas sitting on his bed.
He sauntered into the bar and took shot after shot after shot until the bartender told him to go home. Dean told the bartender to fuck off, because he wasn't even
He’s devoting all his time to working. He’s never been well off, and he’ll need all the money he can get to support Lisa and the baby. He even cut D&D out. He never told Lisa about that. Dean knows she wouldn’t be so…unjudgmental about it like Cas had been.
Dean cracks his eyes open. "Yeah, okay." He ignores how his heart jumps in excitement. They're not even going to do anything, and he's elated. Dean kicks off his shoes and automatically starts unbuckling his pants and freezes. "Is it okay if I don't have pants on?" He glances at Cas.
I rush up the stairs. Kelly is screaming, and the lights are flickering. It’s happening. Satan’s little hell-spawn is being born. I reach the upstairs hallway and follow the sounds of Kelly’s screams. I don’t even think I’d need to hear her to know where that thing is. The energy coming from the room it’s in is unlike anything I’ve felt before. It reminds me a bit of when Cas used to fly. How the air would feel electric right before he landed. It’s like that, but times a thousand. It feels like lightning is about to strike. Maybe it is. My footsteps thunder down the hallway, and there’s one final scream. All of the lights burst.
"Alright, sit down." Dean pulled Cas over to the bed and pushed him onto it. Dean sat but sort of fell onto the bed next to Cas.
Dean flipped through the channels before he found a movie and left it on. He leaned against the headboard and closed his eyes. Feeling Cas' body heat next to him made everything seem just a little better. He scooted a little closer to the angel, so their shoulders touched. Lately, with Sam gone, touching Cas was the only thing that seemed to anchor Dean.
Dean glanced at the bag Cas held in his hands. He wasn't hungry and still felt a little nauseous. Burgers didn't really sound like a good breakfast anyway. But when Dean looked up to Cas to say this, he couldn't. Cas was staring at him with wide blue eyes and tentatively held the takeout bag out to Dean. How did he manage to look so fragile sometimes?
"Cas," Dean says softly. "That was..." His voice trails off. How does he say that it was the sweetest kiss he's ever gotten? That Cas made him feel super special just by a
starts to wake up. Dean’s sleep-addled brain doesn’t quite remember last night just yet, and a heavy weight of guilt and regret settles in his stomach. He only ever wanted to wake up next to Cas. But he and Cas never—
Castiel nods tiredly and steps out of the car. He closes the car door and wraps Dean's jacket tighter around himself. The snow is sticking to the ground, and Castiel takes an experimental step. He makes a wet footprint. He steps next to it to make another footprint. Why is that fun? A big snowflake hits his shoe, and he looks up. The night sky is light from the swirling snow. It's beautiful. It's cold but cozy somehow.
"Thanks." Castiel hopes his excitement isn't too obvious. He puts it back on and climbs under the covers. He lays down and stares at Dean.
It all started when the local grocery store was out of noodles. I didn’t even know that was possible. So then I had to make the forty-five minute trip to Walmart. And
"There should be more artifacts like that here. They should be able to fix you. I'll be back." But it sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than me.
“I don’t—” His voice cracks. “Dean, I have no idea what I’m doing.” Cas searches my face like he can find the answer by looking at me.
Cas turns to leave. Wait...where is he? He'd walked to an unfamiliar part of camp to try and see that girl, but now he's turned around.
Cas' eyes flashed with...disappointment? But it barely lasted a second, so Dean wasn't even sure if he saw it. Cas spoke, "You were a mess."
“Cas,” I say firmly. And I guess it’s because I’m tired, and I’ve been living with him for months without touching him like I want to, and we just kissed, and raising Jack with him has fulfilled every domestic fantasy I’ve ever had, so the words just slip out. “I love you.”
I barge into the room. I can’t really see anything. The moonlight from outside doesn’t provide a lot of light. Kelly is whimpering and breathing heavily. I slowly approach the bed with an angel blade. Sam and I figured a gun would be useless against a Nephilim. An angel blade is our best bet.
But, thankfully, Jack seems to get it out of his system while I clean up the kitchen. He says his new word every four seconds, and by the time Cas gets back home over two hours later, Jack’s asleep. He fell asleep in my arms as I’m sitting at the kitchen table, looking up new ways to make spaghetti. I hear Cas walk into the room and pause.
cheap. Maybe Dean is sick of Castiel. Or bored of him. Castiel bites his lip in worry, but then the typing dots pop up.
alone with Cas. As soon as he and Cas were together, the thoughts would return with full force. Cas shifted next to him, and their shoulders touched. Dean was breathless. God, this was pathetic. He had to get some space between them.
"Wait!" It was louder than Dean meant. He just had to get Cas' attention before it was too late, and time was moving fast while he was like this, so he wasn't exactly sure how much time had passed since Cas spoke.
Dean's heart pounded even harder. The reality of what just happened finally hit. They stopped in front of the table.
The demon kicked Dean in the face, and he fell backwards. Dean looked up just in time to see the blade descending on his chest. Dean grabbed the handle of the blade just below the demon's hands. But Dean was laying on the ground, and the demon had his body behind the dagger and was using his body weight to push the blade towards Dean. It was a losing battle. The only thing Dean really had control over was where the dagger would go.
"No, I'm fine." Dean handed the keys to Sam, avoiding eye contact, his cheeks red from embarrassment.
Dean didn't feel anything, but he couldn't really tell. All he could focus on was Cas holding his arms. Cas was strong. "Oh, baby, don't worry. I feel great!" Dean said and grinned in reassurance. Wait... did he call Cas "baby"?
Dean walked to the bathroom and glanced at Cas in the mirror as he stepped inside. Cas was staring at him with an expression Dean had never seen on him before. Cas was chewing on his lower lip, and staring intently right where the towel fit on Dean. Dean closed the door before he misinterpreted
Garth blows out a breath. “Oh, good. Last time I didn’t ask, and there was a whole incident with hookers and undercover cops and cocaine.”
Wow. That was fast. Castiel grabs the wine bottle, but his building nausea causes him to set it back down.
Garth sets his folder down on the desk and says, “Yeah, but I like to take things slow. We’re all just here to play music, you know? No need to make it stressful.”
Dean nods with a stupid grin on his face. “How have you been?” Dean’s…well, he’s happy to see Lisa even if their relationship hadn’t ended on happy terms. She obviously seems happy to see him, so why should Dean worry?
Dean feels warmth spread through his chest, and he smiles. He actually fucking smiles. He can’t remember the last time he smiled a real, genuine smile. Cas is an absolute dork, but it’s the cutest fucking thing ever. “Yeah, Cas, that’s the term.”
Well...that didn't work. It also only made Dean more worried about Sam, too. "Sorry I told you to leave earlier. I just needed some time to clear my head."
They were soon walking out the door. Dean didn't remember standing up, but they were suddenly halfway across the room. Dean also felt himself starting to stumble and grabbed onto Marco's arm without a second thought. Marco put his hand over Dean's as they stepped outside.
“I’ve read almost every parenting book in existence, but I never would have thought to buy him LEGOs.”
Dean looked at Cas again. "What the hell are you talking about?" Getting drunk wasn't selfish. It was only harmful to himself.
Dean was finally in a good mood. The bar near their motel was surprisingly decent. It had good music, but it also helped that Dean had one too many drinks. So that meant everything was just a little funnier. He was well past the stage of being buzzed and dangerously tipsy. He and Sam had gotten into a little fight earlier, so he was solving it the only way he knew. Alcohol. He took another couple shots against his better judgment. Hey, the more alcohol he was drinking, the better his mood was getting, so why not?
Dean quickly says, “I thought you probably needed one since you got a new car, but if you don’t want it, I, uh, I still have the receipt. I know it’s kind of a lame present, but I guess it’s the mechanic in me, so, uh, yeah.”
about his life. “So, what? You sleep with me and let him have my leftovers?” He knows what he says is fucked up, but he’s having a bit of a crisis right now. Actually, a really big crisis.
She glances at his car and chuckles. “I mean, yeah, but, honestly, it’s going to cost you less to just buy a new car.”
The cold air managed to make everything just a bit more clear. Dean's surroundings sharpened a little. Everything outside his direct line of sight wasn't just a haze now. It was just slightly out of focus instead. They stopped at an old truck. Dean tried to place the make and model, but the information was barely out of reach. It was fuzzy, and retrieving anything other than immediate thoughts felt like sifting through mud. But who cared anyway? He was about to get laid by some hot guy.
Castiel steps out of his truck and pulls the jacket around him. It covers the cast on his hand, which he’s grateful for. The less questions the better. He slams the door angrily and walks over to the apartment complex.
Dean clears his throat again. “Yeah, uh, like the person who creates the campaign your group goes on.”
Every morning Castiel wakes up with that anger-sad feeling. He’s still mad at Dean for being rude and cutting him off like this, but he’s sad that it’s over. And that it ended like
Cas slowly reached a hand towards Dean's face and wiped something off it. Dean brought a hand up to his cheek. It was wet. He'd been crying in his sleep. He quickly wiped the tears away.
. But that was beside the point. All that mattered was why this all upset Dean. "I still don't understand why that made you so upset. Was I still your friend?"
"No, no! That's not what I'm saying at all. That was...it was amazing." It isn't enough, but it's all Dean can say. He's never been great at words.
"...You want to slow down?" The disappointment in Cas' voice feels like a slap in the face. Dean is surprised that it seems like Cas doesn't want to stop.
It was raining outside when Dean pulled into the small gas station. It was a slight drizzle, just enough to make everything gray and wet. The gas station lights reflected on the pavement. Dean and Sam had gone up against a family of witches. The witches had captured Dean and put him in some sort of dream state. All Castiel knew was Sam had been working for three days to find him. After Dean dropped Sam off at their hotel to sleep, Dean had called Castiel. Castiel wasn't sure why. Dean didn't say much besides a brief summary on what had happened. He assumed Dean would explain at some point.
Someone is taking Jack from me. I wake up with a startled jerk and automatically reach out to take my kid back. I didn’t realize I feel asleep.
There’s a couple more steps, and the sound of clothes rustling. Dean feels body heat next to him. An arm grips onto his shoulder.
Dean grabs onto Cas as tightly as he can. He’s probably hurting him, but he doesn’t care. He buries his face into Cas’ shoulder and weeps. Cas rubs calming circles on Dean’s back and gently rocks them back and forth. Dean’s not sure how long they do this. Cas holds Dean even after he’s done crying.
The droning of the movie drowned out his thoughts. But he still wanted to forget. He wanted another drink. Maybe Cas forgot their little deal. Dean peeked his eyes open in hopes of trying to sneakily snatch the whiskey back but was surprised to see Cas staring at him. Dean didn't know what to say, and he was too tired to try and come up with something, so they both stared at each other. The alcohol was really starting to take effect. Dean yawned.
Dean studies him for a few seconds. Castiel knows Dean can tell he’s changing the subject on purpose, but Dean answers his question.
Dean quickly looks away and focuses on the thermostat again. But Castiel notices the tears he was trying to blink back. Dean finishes figuring out the thermostat and turns on the bedside lamp. He walks back towards the door and turns off the main light before falling on his bed. He rolls over to turn the lamp off.
I hum in acknowledgment but don’t say anything else. I’m the last person to give parenting advice, but I don’t like seeing how much this is upsetting Cas. I know he’s trying to hide it, but I can tell this whole baby thing is wearing on him. I mean, it would tire anyone out, even an angel.
Dean ends that train of thought. He's finished putting the mix into the pan. He grips the pan with his left hand and opens the oven with his right. As he slips the pan into the oven, his thumb gets stuck under it, but he doesn't realize it until after he places the pan down, scrapes his thumb across the oven grill, and closes the oven. He feels the pain then. Fucking alcohol. He inspects his thumb. It's not bad.
Castiel closes his eyes but reaches a hand across the space between them. He finds Dean and rests his hand on Dean’s chest, feeling his heartbeat. Dean’s heart is beating quickly. He’s not even close to being asleep. Dean interlaces their fingers, and Castiel smiles. His last coherent thought before drifting off is,
"Don't feel obligated to…to sleep in the same bed as me or hold my hand like this just because I love you."
Jack said he was going to build a car with his LEGOs, so he can drive like me. I won’t pretend that I didn’t tear up when he said that. Besides, Cas is gone since it’s his turn to get groceries while I watch Jack, so no one was around to see me get emotional over LEGOs.
Dean kinda measures the things he puts into the mixing bowl, taking sips of his whiskey in between each item he adds. Once he finishes that, he turns on the mixer and starts mixing. The whisks easily plow through the chunky batter, blending it all perfectly. It's fun to watch, and Dean grins. He mixes longer than is probably necessary. The whiskey has definitely taken effect. He sets the bowl down.
Cas reaches over and squeezes his arm, and he’s pulling back sooner than Dean would like. “Are you going to be okay?” Cas is looking at him fiercely. He
3am! No way. It was just 9pm. Dammit. No way he can get laid now. Cas sighs. He was really looking forward to that.
Practicing with the orchestra has been another highlight of his life recently. They’re sounding good now. They’re not as good as Castiel’s old group, but Castiel enjoys playing with these people more. They’re more upbeat and positive. They always compliment Castiel, and they all go to lunch together when rehearsals go late.
Dean tries to glare at her, but tears are threatening to spill over, so he quickly turns around, grabs his keys, and slams the door on his way out.
He was trying to be patient. Cas seemed excited about this, and Dean wasn't going to let how he was feeling get in the way of Cas' good time.
Castiel answers, "I'm not hungry." Another lie. The only other food he's eaten today was a Nature Valley bar at lunch. He's never buying Nature Valley again. Those bars basically crumble to dust before you can even bring them to your mouth.
“But—you’re not—it’s…” I don’t know why Cas wearing different clothes is so revolutionary to me. I’ve seen him in different clothes before. I’ve seen him as a human. There’s just something about Cas choosing to dress like this that’s…I don’t know. It shows more of
"Yes, Dean," Cas answered, the annoyance in his voice was strong. "I wouldn't bother you otherwise."
That is one drawback from being high most of the time. Everything blurs together. Time has no meaning. It's gotten so bad he was surprised when Christmas rolled around a little bit ago. Or a while ago. Cas has no clue.
Then Castiel realizes he's still wearing Dean's jacket. He can't help but feel a little disappointed at the thought of returning it. It's like a little piece of Dean that's his own.
But it was these moments when Cas had his leg up against Dean's or their hands would brush while searching for books that almost made Dean lose it. He could pick up any girl he wanted, but Cas drove him crazy with the slightest touch. It was fucking annoying.
Dean was about to tell the man to fuck off, he didn't swing that way. But he did. Sometimes. Wait, what did that guy say again?
The waitress comes back with Dean's card. He quickly replaces it in his wallet, grabs his jacket, and stands. Castiel follows. He looks at the parking lot through the glass doors. Snow is coming down heavily. Castiel can already feel the wet flakes soaking through his thin work shirt and grimaces.
Today is one of the best days ever. Sam married Eileen. Dean cried. Multiple times. He ate too much at the reception and got a little tipsy. His best man speech rocked, though. Sam and Eileen left ages ago. They're having their honeymoon in California. Dean can't be happier. Everyone left a couple hours after them. The last people to leave were Jody, Claire, Kaia, and Jack.
"I'm trying." He stared at the hand he placed on me. His eyes flicked up to my face. Panic. He immediately tried to cover it by looking away and taking a step back.
They both head over to the Impala, and Dean unlocks it. They get inside. Dean turns the radio on to a low volume. The streets are practically empty, and the drive back to the hotel is relaxing. He also enjoys Cas' presence, even if they're both too tired to say anything. Just being around Cas makes Dean content.
Castiel stares at Dean firmly. Dean squirms under his gaze. Castiel says, “What you said isn’t true.”
Cas glares, but there's a small smile on his lips. Not like Dean is staring at his lips or anything.
Drinking is simple. Getting drunk is a fun pastime anyone can do. Cas remembers the first time he got drunk and how great it felt. Everything was funnier—hazier—but funnier. His motor skills were almost nonexistent, but he had more confidence. He loves the feeling.
Dean squinted at his chest, finding a hopefully non-lethal area for the blade to hit, aimed, and directed the blade into that spot. The blade sunk into Dean faster than he was expecting. He also wasn't expecting to feel nothing. Both he and the demon blinked in surprise at the blade sticking out of Dean's torso. He was still alive, so Dean guess his idea worked.
I don’t even know why I’m not constantly fighting Cas about raising it. Maybe because it’s Cas, and when it comes to Cas things are—things are different. It also might be due to the fact I thought Cas had been killed before the baby was born. He went into that other dimension and didn’t come out for a long, long time. I was
Dean rolled his eyes and picked his menu back up, but he wasn't mad. He glanced at Cas over the top of his menu and hoped he'd stay for breakfast.
Dean clears his throat. "I need more mix." He holds up the ladle and pointedly looks at the bowl behind Cas. Cas steps back to give Dean more room.
He’d told her three weeks. That’s how long he thought it would take. But he hadn’t anticipated his surgery, which is only making it longer for his hand to heal. He isn’t sure exactly how long it will be now. Even after his bones are healed, he’ll need time for his hand to fully recover, let alone for him to be up to speed with the rest of the band. He’ll need to practice. And that will take even more time.
Embarrassment flashed through Dean's chest, and he blushed. "Yeah, I'm fine," he quickly answered, hoping the moment would just end. Then he realized how close they were. Cas' face was inches from his. Dean could make out his pores. He also noticed Cas' eyes had little streaks of light blue mixed in them. His lips also looked a lot softer this close.
Dean hesitated. He usually didn't go to bars during the day. But then he remembered the missing whiskey bottle and unanswered prayers. It just made him want to piss off Cas more, so he pulled into the parking lot. After all, he had nothing to lose. Cas wasn't answering his prayers. He had no fucking clue where Sam was. So why not get blackout drunk?
"Dean," Cas began. His voice was gentler than it had just been. He tentatively reached a hand out to Dean's face but hesitated and withdrew it. Dean wished Cas had touched him. "If you had died yesterday..." Cas suddenly stood up and walked to the other side of the bed. "How would Sam feel?" Cas stood over Dean and crossed his arms.
want to do that again. The longer he stayed outside, the more he didn't want to go back inside. "I need a few more minutes."
"I just wanted to... I felt... Never mind. You can go if you want." Dean didn't look at him. His shoulders were tense as he watched the Impala fill with gas.
“Yeah, of course. Hold on.” Dean rushes back to his room and grabs the plastic bag of Cas’ presents from his closet. He walks back into the kitchen. “I didn’t have time to wrap them, but, uh, here.” He shoves the bag in Cas’ direction.
“Yes.” Cas holds me for a beat more before quietly saying, “Thank you for being so good to him. I was never a child, and I sometimes feel as if I can’t connect with him like you can because of that.”
Dean looked down at his lap, ashamed at how pathetic he'd been earlier. Did he really need someone in the same bed as him just to fall asleep?
Castiel steps into the living room and stops. “You moved the table.” The table and the television have switched places since Castiel was here last.
that would make his heart skip a beat and his mouth go dry. Dean would find himself zoning out when Cas spoke to him, because Dean would suddenly start thinking about if Cas would notice if he took a step closer or touched his hand. When he was really tired, Dean would even stare at Cas' lips and imagine what they'd taste like. Take now, for instance. Dean wondered what would happen if he just dropped his towel. But these were thoughts he shoved away to the furthest parts of his mind. He just hoped none of them came up last night.
Dean shrugs. “It reminds me of you.” And then he freezes. His shoulders tense, and he stares blankly ahead.
Dean opens his mouth then shuts it. His gaze roams again. A tear falls down his cheek, and he quickly wipes it away. He swallows thickly and clears his throat. He looks up, his hair messy, and his eyes glossy with tears. “Bye, Cas,” he says softly and quickly. He turns away with stiff shoulders and walks out the door.
I don’t get a response. I look at the bed. Her form is still. I swallow down the lump in my throat and look back down at the baby. It’s still smiling at me.
"We were worried, Dean. You weren't answering Sam's calls." Cas' eyes bore into Dean's. There was a lot more anger in them than there should've been. Did something else happen? Did Dean do something? "I'm glad to see you're fine." Cas turned and took a couple steps away.
felt uncomfortable because he didn't want to envision his friend getting laid. He wasn't uncomfortable because Dean felt sick at the thought of Cas with anyone other than him. Nope. But then Dean wondered how'd they start. Probably a kiss. She'd get to taste every bit of him. Something Dean had wondered for a long time.
and the times we would wake up and go to bed. And if you dared to disobey…” Castiel instinctively tenses. He blinks a few times and takes in a deep breath. “I was gone the second I turned eighteen.”
Cas went on, "He said you weren't answering your phone and asked me to see if you were ok. I called him when I found you."
Dean laid back down, but he knew he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep, the memory was too fresh in his mind. The weight of the bed shifted, and Cas laid down next to him. Dean moved to give Cas more room, and their hands brushed. Dean didn't move and kept the back of his hand flat against Cas'. He closed his eyes and forced himself to relax. He focused on the warmth from Cas' hand.
"I need a drink," Dean stated and turned around before Cas could reply. He remembered the way to the bar. It wasn't a long walk.
I’m damaged goods. Like, very damaged. Whenever I allowed myself to picture a life outside of Hunting, it was always like my time with Lisa. I’m with a woman I really like who really likes me back. Maybe a kid or two. I’m more at peace than I am when I’m Hunting, but it’s all sort of a façade to ignore who I really am and what I’ve done. But with Cas…
"Yes, it does." Dean looks up resolutely. He glances over and waves at their waitress, signaling for the checks. "You're coming back with me."
"You can stay if you want. But I think Sam's still asleep." Dean turned to Castiel and paused. "What?"
Castiel fumbles for his phone charger in the dark room. He finds it on his nightstand and plugs in his phone, but he pauses when he sees he has a message from Dean.
Dean follows Cas down the short hallway and out into the parking lot. The Impala is the only car left. The summer air is warm and humid. The stars twinkle above them. Dean reaches into his pocket and grabs his keys, already missing today. It was so blissful and happy. Dean's still adjusting to not feeling completely shitty all the time, let alone happy. It's nice but also kind of weird.
He starts a pot of coffee and is pulling out ingredients for omelets when Cas walks in. His hair looks even more disheveled than before, and his eyes are glassy with sleep. He’s fucking gorgeous.
Castiel eats five pancakes and regrets everything. Dean also makes him hard eggnog. So when they begin their movie (a Hallmark movie Dean wants Castiel to watch that Dean makes Castiel swear not to tell anyone he saw), Castiel is toeing the line between tipsy and drunk in addition to being sated from the pancakes he just had. He’s
I sit up and yank the bedsheets off of me. I walk down the stairs and see Cas holding his blanket in a death grip. He’s yelling something in Enochian, and just like all the other times, it’s loud enough for the baby to hear, and he’s crying now.
Dean smiles and looks down at his bowl. “Thanks.” He slurps down some soup. “So, are you only performing on Christmas Eve?”
. Of course, Dean never tells Cas this. Whenever Cas asks if his piano playing bothers Dean, Dean just says no. Dean’s always wanted to tell Cas he thinks he’s amazing at the piano, but he hasn’t had the chance. He’s not the best at words. But Cas seems to understand this by now, which is usually fine—great even—but it’s not great when Dean has things to say and can’t summon the courage to say them. And the longer time goes on, the more awkward Dean feels about mentioning Cas’ piano playing.
Cas gently sets the honey jar down on the island and steps towards Dean, grabbing both of his hands. Cas interlaces their fingers, and Dean thinks he’s having a heart attack with how fast and loud his heart is beating. Cas tugs Dean closer.
He’s fine. He really is. Dean knows this numbness probably won’t last forever, but he’s not exactly sure where it’s coming from, or how to make himself feel again. And he honestly doesn’t care to. He’s fine with being just fine. Dean knows stuffing down his emotions is an unhealthy coping mechanism he’s had for years. He also knows the feelings he shoves away usually come bubbling over at some point. But, unlike all the other times, Dean’s had to use
During today's meeting, one of the women was giving him bedroom eyes. Cas made a point to memorize where she went, so he could come by later. He's trying to rush over to her now, so he can still remember before the drugs—or
Castiel knows Dean is going to leave for about a month. Objectively, he knows that isn’t a lot of time, but they’ve grown so close, that Castiel knows he’s going to miss Dean every second he’s gone. Castiel is completely head over heels in love with Dean. Of course Dean doesn’t know this. Castiel knows everything that has happened with Lisa is still fresh, so he won’t push Dean into anything. Besides, Dean doesn’t seem interested in Castiel. Dean hasn’t made a move, and if nothing has happened between them at this point, it never will. But Castiel doesn’t mind. He enjoys all his time spent with Dean, even if they’ll never be anything more than friends.
Cas got off the bed and walked over to Dean and stood next to him a bit too close. "I'll accompany you."
The realization hits him like a freight train, and Dean’s breath gets caught in his throat. A few more instruments have started playing along with Cas now, but the piano is still the main sound filling the air. Dean furiously blinks at the sudden tears in his eyes. Is he seriously tearing up over
like Sam was there. Almost. After an uneventful breakfast, he got back into the Impala and drove around town. He prayed for Cas a couple more times. No response. As he was driving down a road near the downtown area, a flashing neon sign caught his eye. A bar.
Cas looks around the room while he tries to get his body to wake up faster. He's in one of the many spare rooms they have in the bunker. It's bare except for the bed and the desk with a lamp next to him. The desk chair is facing the bed. Dean had been sitting there watching him. Cas knows Dean finds it creepy whenever
dramatic, but the last thing Dean wants to do is go back to his own dark room and pointlessly try to sleep. He knows he won’t be able to sleep until 4am like he has been, and all he’ll be able to do is miss a baby that was never his and replay holding hands with Cas until it drives him insane, and then it will be time for him to go to work.
Last night Dean went to sleep in the same bed as Cas. Dean thought Cas wanted to sleep with him, not literally just sleep
Dean suddenly turns and says, "Sorry I didn't bring any extra clothes. I thought I could make this in one trip. So, uh, yeah. Sorry." His eyes dance around the room before settling on Cas.
Dean looked away. His adrenaline picked up. Why did he like that Cas thought about him? He shouldn't. Besides, Cas shouldn't be worrying about someone like him.
Dean sighs. "Yeah, yeah." He opens his eyes and looks at Cas again. Cas is staring at him. Dean smiles. "What?"
Dean lifts his face from his hands but doesn’t look over. He stares at Baby. At the goddamn flat tire.
Cas watches it all silently. He knows there's something else going on here, but he has no clue what it is. For the first time since he can remember, Cas wishes he was sober.
Castiel blinks in surprise at Dean's honesty. He can see the regret in Dean's eyes and pressed lips. Castiel is dying to know more and wants to help, but he knows he probably won't be able to. Dean doesn't accept help a lot anyway.
And Dean can tell by Cas' tone that he is going to tell Dean to let go or something. Dean doesn't want that. "Shh," Dean says.
I’m brushing my teeth before bed when Cas walks over to the bathroom and leans against the doorframe. I catch his gaze in the reflection.
upset about cancelling on Cas because it is just dinner, and Dean is going to get laid, but…Cas is special, and Dean can’t help but feel scummy when he texts Cas that he’s too busy meet up tonight. But, despite the random guilt about bailing on Cas last minute, Dean’s night with Lisa is amazing. He almost forgets about Cas. Almost.
And Dean doesn't really care. It hurt at first, but that was eclipsed by the ecstasy of having Cas back. He'll take Cas in any way he can get. Angel. Human. Friend. Lover. Anything. Just as long as Cas is here and safe.
Castiel eats at Dean’s most nights. They exchange numbers, so Dean texts Castiel when he’s working late or is too busy to cook. Sometimes Castiel can’t make it either, but they eat together most nights out of the week. Castiel is glad he met Dean. He might have a crush on Dean, too.
a cult, but my father—he was very religious. Too religious. He made me and brothers and sisters follow strict rules based off the Bible. Or, rather, his twisted interpretation of it. He—he dictated how we
They slowly make their way back to Cas' cabin. It's the first time Cas really enjoys walking through camp. He can clearly feel the slight breeze on his skin, and he watches a bird fly overhead. It's really quite peaceful. Cas is actually a bit sad when they reach his cabin, but they both head inside.
“What? No, no, of course not,” Dean says quickly. “Besides, it looks good on you.” He gives Castiel that small smile again, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
Dean walked towards the entrance with Cas trailing behind him. Why did he say "okay"? He hadn't mean to say that! He just wanted some time alone to collect his thoughts. He opened the door, and the cool night air felt refreshing. He took a couple deep breaths. Cas walked past him and leaned his back against the wall, so he could face Dean. He looked up at the stars.
Less than a day later, Dean’s preparing dinner when there’s a quiet knock at the door. Dean glances at the clock on the oven. It’s a bit early for Cas to be over. It’s only when Dean’s opening the door that he remembers that Cas doesn’t knock anymore. Dean copied a key for him a few weeks ago.
He grabbed my arms and unfolded them from my chest and held my hands. He was warm, and it took all my willpower to stop me from interlacing our fingers.
I reach the door and take in a deep breath for courage. I doubt Cas will be happy to see me. We haven’t really spoken since the night the Nephilim was born. He knows how I feel about it. I know how he feels about it. There’s not much to talk about. I steel myself and knock a couple times and wait. I hear footsteps approach, and the door opens.
He was shoved on his back as the demon caught up to him. He'd forgotten about that. The demon crouched in front of Dean and swung his dagger, and by some miracle Dean managed to catch the demon's arm. Must've been muscle memory or something. The adrenaline also sobered him up just a little.
