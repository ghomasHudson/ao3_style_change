Maybe John would have got married and Sherlock would have been best man. Both of them believing this was the best it could be, pretending that they weren’t the most important people in each other’s lives. John had never been more grateful for a text from Irene Adler.
The tracker on his phone suggested he was still at 221B Baker Street, as was Sherlock. Finn had been there for a while and was now on the move to his girlfriend’s – the boy could be Mary’s way into finding out more information without arousing suspicion. She could ‘bump' into him on the way, if she left now.
John put his hands out palms up, as if to say ‘I didn’t say anything.’
John looked guilty at his comments. “Not necessarily that you loved someone else, but that you had found some other.....companion.”
“Anyway I came to 221B temporarily at first, at least until another suitable home was found and that’s when we first met. I was terrified. I mean Sherlock was the only person in the world who had ever really liked me and I knew how much he loved you. So if you didn’t like me, I knew there was no hope for me to stay at Baker Street permanently. I remember stressing about my clothes and my hair and I was convinced you were going to hate me.”
Mary Morstan always felt she had a simple soul
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to roll his eyes and he plonked himself dramatically on one of the kitchen chairs, which earned him a raised eyebrow from John. He had been pestering the other man to move back in, well since he came back from the dead, but more since they began....their new found intimacy. Sherlock refused to call it dating. It had been a few months since the change in their friendship and they had explored each other in all the ways they had hinted at that night and more. It had been a very enlightening experiment, one that he very much wanted to continue with. John however was making it difficult for him to get as much data as he would like to, because he kept going home to his pesky flat. Sherlock couldn’t understand why John was avoiding moving back to Baker Street and when he had asked John had stated it was too soon. This was where they had become friends, where they had started to fall in love with each other – why was he hiding from it?
John’s heart was pumping faster, as his adrenalin built – this was turning into an actual argument. “You have always been mesmerised by Irene Adler and she is obviously obsessed with you.”
"I imagined my wedding you know, when I was a kid and a young man. At a church, me in tails and her in a white dress (or a man in matching tails once I discovered that side to myself), big cake, elaborate speeches, all these people there I hardly knew – you know the full shebang. Cheesy disco in the evening and lots of drink and silly fun. Maybe kids would come after, a baby – planned and ours.
This thought process had led him to his current situation. He was wearing his bed sheet and doing an experiment on one of John’s shirts. He was often covered in one of those Grandad jumpers (that Sherlock secretly adored and if one were to look under the detective’s bed, one might find one of said Grandad jumpers), but the other day, for once, it had been too warm to wear one. Sherlock had been able to admire John in a shirt. It had stretched over the shorter man’s muscles and Sherlock had found it quite distracting. He had ensured that the item had ‘accidentally’ been left behind and he was currently watching how it reacted to a Bunsen burner.
He felt Finn grab his arm “Dad” his eyes frantically searched his face . “What are you doing?!”
Now however there was an uncomfortable silence at the table, as they organised the Thai takeaway between them. Rachel seemed nervous too, but in theory he should be the one putting her at ease. He was the ‘grown up' after all and he was in theory hosting (it was at his estranged husband’s house, but still).  He was however out of his depth and didn’t know how to act or what to say. He was still trying to build a relationship with Finn and adjust to being a father – how did he tackle getting in the girlfriend’s good books?
“No?” John looked confused and went to stand in the circle he had left clear. “Well it certainly looks romantic to me. Not something that does it for me particularly, but I bet there are plenty of people out there who would love it. Certainly some of my past girlfriends would be blown away by it....but if it’s not for an experiment, what is it for?”
“It’s still as true as the first time I said it all those years ago.” She sat down opposite him and looked at him with kind eyes. Always such kind eyes, despite everything he had put her through.
And wasn’t that a sentence he never thought he would say. How was this his life?
It was coming back, all of it....his head was rushing with it all. His hands shook and his mug clattered to the floor. He gripped the counter in front of him, as his knuckles turned white. He couldn’t deal with the onslaught of memories that were coursing through him, it felt like a dam had burst and he was getting washed away in the current.
Finn finally looked at him then and with a deep sigh he said “How do you know when your in love?”
A small smile appeared on John’s face “That’s quite...sweet.”
“That doesn’t mean you have to like or fancy me anymore. You flirt with every woman we meet – the lady at the bakery, the landlady at the pub, Finn’s teacher! Is that a sign that you miss it?”
After being politely escorted out, John had had to try to explain to his date where the mild mannered doctor she had met had disappeared to, but to no avail. She had been quite shocked in his abrupt change in demeanour and had left before Sherlock’s nose had stopped bleeding.
Finn had mentioned that John had written a blog during his and Sherlock’s early years together, so he had turned to the only person he could truly trust at the moment...himself. He had found the blog page and poured over every entry, trying to find out who this Sherlock Holmes really was and find some insight into the man he himself had become. The first thing he had got from it was that he adored Sherlock or maybe worshipped him. The way his other self described the detective was like he was in awe of him. He had been surprised it took so long for the two of them to get together. If Sherlock had read this, surely he would have picked up on that in a second, if ‘idiot’ John Watson could.
“You’re naked?” was Greg’s response.
Sherlock stood up at this and Finn tried to diffuse the situation with a placating “Please Dads..”
He made his way downstairs to an empty sitting room and kitchen. He found his way to the kettle and optimistically opened the fridge for milk.
Sherlock’s words of comfort were still not coming. He reached for the young man’s hand, hopefully that would be enough. Sherlock could fully empathise with his son though. In his haste to reach his husband, he hadn’t considered he might not be fully....awake....and seeing those blank blue eyes had brought him back to reality with an unwanted bump.
John nodded once more. “It’s different hearing it from someone else’s perspective. We have set a good example for him Sherlock.”
Now he felt lost and....empty.
Was it too much?
John was in his arms. He had promised all those years ago that he wouldn’t let John go again and he planned to keep that promise. Even if his doctor couldn’t remember it, it would have to be enough for him to remember for them both.
He had a son. He still couldn’t quite believe it. He knew Sherlock and he had adopted Finn when he had just turned 11, but he didn’t know the details. Sherlock had said it wasn’t his story to tell and John didn’t want to restart his relationship with Finn by bringing up the demons from his past. Especially when he should already know the details. To be honest he didn’t need to know, not if Finn didn’t want to tell him or relive it. All he needed to know was who Finn was now and how to be part of his life.
Sherlock looked away at this “Agreed.” He mumbled.
“Did she know what?” Sherlock seemed confused.
Then he had met Mary Morstan, well they had literally crashed into each other at the hospital. She had been visiting a friend and he had been distracted by a chart. There had been a cooling cup of coffee involved and after the usual British bumbling and apologies, they had arranged a date. All quite clichéd really.
Mentions of nightmares
As the case moved forward he had resigned himself to never being able to get this romance malarkey right. To have a normal relationship, to be able to get married. To be worthy of John.
“I’m aware...care to join me?” he asked cheekily.
A blush reached the other man’s famous cheekbones “You must know this by now, surely. I gatecrash your dates, monopolise your time and jump off roofs to keep you alive.”
“It’s been three months John!”
Her beloved James had killed himself. He had put a gun in his mouth, because of that.....monster, so that he could win their stupid game. She knew Sherlock had goaded Moriarty into it, she knew it was his fault – he must have manipulated him somehow. She hadn’t been there to help, to save him from himself and the allures of Sherlock bloody Holmes. She would never forgive herself, but more than that, she would never stop until she had gotten revenge.
She had looked up at him and smiled. “I know it’s not something we have talked about, but it just makes so much sense. We love each other and this could be a fresh start for us both. You have been trying to find who you are and I think we have something really special John. What do you think?”
Mary frowned, but smiled and said “Of course love, it was a big night.” She giggled, kissed his forehead and bounced to the bathroom.
“The only person I have ever been in love with is you.” John’s voice was firm and almost cold, so he could get through to Sherlock. The detective was stunned into silence at this. John took a step closer, determined to get through to his stubborn husband.
Warnings - hints of sexual situations
Sherlock jumped out of bed and grabbed some pajamas . If John couldn’t comfort him, he could comfort John, as he always had – with his violin. It might even help with his memories. After three and a half weeks, they were getting nowhere with John remembering anything about their life, their love, their family and Sherlock was willing to try anything.
“No my dear John, I’m taking you to heaven.”
Thank you for all the comments and kudos and for keeping with me. We are back in the past again with this chapter. Warnings at the end of the chapter.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and leaned heavily on his ever present umbrella “It seems he has outwitted our dear detective inspector here, whilst the rest of us were otherwise occupied. My people are looking into it as we speak.”
Lestrade looked between the two of them “About bloody time”
Finn started to get a bit flustered again, as he went into lots of detail about how Rachel would be getting there. It was strange to see his son so undone, it seemed like he had more than his own romantic life to adjust to....he was about to gain a daughter in law.
The young boy had adjusted fairly well to Baker Street and his two new guardians. They had all done well in taking on the new dynamic between them and dealt with the bumps in the road along the way. This had led to them starting the process for adoption, which had just recently been finalised.
“Can’t you deduce it?”
“Oh so it’s ok for you to loose your head every time The Woman sends me a text message, but if I get upset when you ditch me for your ex then that’s unbelievable.”
John was sat in his chair.
“John is still here. He’s just an older version. He liked you then for the person you are. Even if you can’t dazzle him with your deductions, doesn’t mean he won’t still like the real you. Maybe your not getting anywhere with him, because you are not being the man he fell in love with.”
If Sherlock actually expressed emotions or was remotely interested in love.
“Sherlock the case” John reasoned.
Sherlock didn’t think he had an optimistic bone in his body and he lived by logic and sense, not hope and belief.
“And called me Dad.” John could feel a sob coming on “God Sherlock how could I forget that?” He moved his right hand to the side of the other man’s face and stroked the outline of his cheekbone. “How could I forget you?”
Caring was not an advantage, he was living proof of that. His thoughts were focused on statistics, what ifs and his mind palace was inaccessible. He had spent the best part of 10 hours in a blank, grey room in a suffocating hospital- doing nothing but thinking about statistics and what ifs. He wasn’t engaging his brain in anything useful.
Only a little mind.
John coughed and looked at his strolling feet. Finn chuckled “You don’t have to talk about it you feel uncomfortable.”
But without their son there as a buffer, the undeniable truth started to creep up on John that he had left Sherlock, he had betrayed him. God how could he have done that? How could he forget such a man?
John sighed as he glanced over at Sherlock. They were sat in their chairs in Baker Street and his lover was....sad....defeated. The doctor had never seen him like this before.
John broke eye contact and stepped back. “Good....what I am trying to say is I don’t know where to go from here. You aren’t ordinary Sherlock. I don’t think you will want to go on a date or for me to buy you flowers, unless they can be used in an experiment....I guess.” He drew his eyebrows and then looked back at Sherlock with determination “This also isn’t just about sex for me Sherlock, but I don’t know how to woo you. I don’t have any spare body parts to give you. I can’t make a case appear out of thin air and –“
“Good you’re awake then” he muttered before leaning back and removing his hand. “You were thrashing about in your sleep and murmuring my name. I thought you may have been having a nightmare.” Sherlock’s heart was pounding hard and he couldn’t distinguish the John in front of him with the angry, nasty John of his dream.
John had been living at Baker Street for a few years now and they had been....happy, dare he think it.....content. Being content for the two of them included dead body parts, arguments about when to eat and putting their lives at risk at least once a week. Oh and there was sex, quite a bit of that. Since they had started their romantic relationship things had gone surprisingly well, it was like they were before Sherlock’s fall – just with kissing and shagging thrown into the mix. It was the longest relationship John had ever had (even without the friendship years and really John had been Sherlock’s since the moment they met) and he was in disbelief every day that this was his life. After everything he had been through, he was actually happy and.....content.
“Yes?” Sherlock almost whispered, as he looked concerned.
The John Watson that Sherlock Holmes knew was dead. John had done everything he could to try to bring him back to life, but it was futile.
Maybe if he saw this side of Sherlock things would start clicking into place and maybe the other man would stop being so scared around him. So he had approached Sherlock and asked him if he could join him on a case, which had lead them to this moment, with Sherlock prancing around a corpse.
Greg sighed and rubbed his eyes. After a pause he said “Well maybe you need to figure out who you are and what you want.” he said, as he put a comforting hand on John's shoulder. After a pause, he stood up and walked towards the living room door. He stopped at the door frame and looked back at John. “I’m your friend John and I’ll be here for you, but don’t play around with Sherlock’s feelings. He’s an annoying git and the bane of my existence at times, but I care about him and I don’t want to see him hurt anymore than he already is.”
Sherlock was alive.
He felt the draft from the door opening and shutting again before a familiar figure sat down next to him.
He pulled his hands away and sighed. Molly was staring up at him with a sad smile on her face. “I am here for you Sherlock, just like I was for the fall. I might not see you as well as John.....did and I might not be ‘hopelessly in love with you’ anymore, but I do love you Sherlock and I want to be here for you if you need me.”
Sherlock tries to deal with his demons, without his husband by his side.
Sherlock wasn’t ready for that.
“John-"
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re absolutely sure?” he whispered into John’s hair.
Imagine how wonderful that is going to be – she thought.
Sherlock smiled and nodded, as he wiped his eyes.
But John ploughed on “I’m sorry I made you believe that there would ever be a world where I would leave you.”
He had been reminded of that last night with the bomb. In that moment he had faced losing Sherlock again, but more significantly losing the second chance he had been taking for granted. Once he saw that Sherlock was laughing, realised that the git had set him up; he was annoyed sure, but he was also relieved.
John had turned around and snorted in amusement. “For once”
“With what’s happened to you this past few months, I have been wishing that I could wake up one day and only remember my life from the day I met you. That I could forget the first 10 years of my life.....but after seeing you today I’ve realised that, despite all the pain and suffering, it is a part of who I am and I wouldn’t be me without it.”
Thanks again for everyone's support for those who are still reading. As always this is just for fun and again there are no warnings I can think of.
Perfection took time apparently, she had soon discovered.
Molly had been giving him body parts to analyse out of pity. The morgue was only a couple of staircases away from the ICU and John’s room. Sherlock was comfortable with that distance and usually ventured down there to give Finn sometime alone with his father. He had finally convinced him to get back to Uni and Finn usually came back to the hospital after classes, keeping vigil with his books and essays. His time in the morgue with Molly was helping him focus his mind and keeping away his itch for a fix, although his resolve was fading.
John was surprised at the detective’s words. “I understand and I will try to be more aware of it in future.” John paused and looked at their joined hands. “It was the shift I had had, that’s why I didn’t join you on the case.” Sherlock turned fully on his side at this admission and John mirrored the action, their hands still joined. “There was a young boy brought in, not much older than Finn when we first adopted him. He had....overdosed.” Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly at this in acknowledgement.
John laughed at the joke, but Sherlock’s face remained unmoved. “You’re serious?”
Sherlock sat bolt upright and brought himself back into the real world. The distinctive features of 221b’s sitting room came into focus, he was on the couch. It had been a nightmare....well a nightmarish memory. One that had been distorted by John. His doctor now had a hand on his shoulder, his blue eyes searching his face. Sherlock was panting and he could feel the cold sweat on his face and back.
His eyes opened once again to meet John’s. He had no idea what to say or do, as ever he was following his husband’s lead, but John seemed as anchorless as him.
She had become part of his network, earned his trust and she believed she had gained his admiration. She would have done anything for the man and she had spent every day trying to prove her worthiness to him.
“Mr Holmes – it does sound like an interesting job – what’s it like?” Rachel asked, obviously trying to diffuse the situation.
“It will come back Pops” was heard from behind them. Finn smiled, as he brought John’s duffel bag through the living room. Sherlock could tell his son’s smile was forced and that he was finding the situation a lot more difficult than he was projecting.
But Sherlock wasn’t listening “I was just remembering that day at Baskerville, when you pulled rank.”
The doctor finished the sandwiches and brought them over to the table, before he joined his son to eat. He took a bite of his sandwich, as he watched Finn play with his food. “Do you want to tell me why you have been boring holes into the back of my head since I got home?” At the young boy’s silence he prodded “Is something up son?...Whatever trouble you have got yourself into we can help you, we can sort it.” Finn still didn’t say anything and wouldn’t even look at John now. “I could always give your Uncle Mycroft a call, find out what you have been up to.”
Since that fateful day when they had declared their love for each other, Sherlock had explored himself and John thoroughly and he had enjoyed it immensely. Surprisingly their intimate relations had yet to get boring, although they had simmered a little from their first year or so together.
Sherlock’s throat tightened at this, words of protest trapped there. John had gone to collect his coat and the detective was frozen in his seat, as he shouldered on the garment. “But I will be back” A flame of hope burst through Sherlock’s soul “I just don’t know when. I meant what I said before, I am here now and you’re safe.”
“Oh God” John groaned, as he saw the other man fall to his knees in front of him. “Bloody hell.” He muttered.
-	- - - - -
“Good.” John responded “Worth losing out on a blow job for.”
The doctor stopped his detective with a finger on those full lips. They were soft. John knew that Sherlock’s lips were soft. This was something he now knew, god what else could he find out. His body was thrumming with excitement. He would be surprised if Sherlock couldn’t feel it. His finger had moved out of the way and his thumb was now stroking the lower lip. “Once again Sherlock your stupidity ceases to amaze me” his eyes moved from his own thumb up to Sherlock’s eyes, which were open and wide. “Surely you have deduced my feelings.”
The detective’s breath was stolen from him at that moment and tears filled his eyes. He wanted to take the pain Finn was feeling away and a hot rush of protectiveness surged through his body. He heard the emotion in John’s voice too as he replied. “Nobody is perfect Finn, Sherlock and I are certainly proof of that, but we love you just way you are now and also who you were then.”
Finn nodded and looked at the duffel in his hands “I’ll take this upstairs and try to de ‘teenage boy’ my room.” Finn was currently living in halls at Uni, but still stayed at home during the holidays.
John hadn’t been a player in this particular game, just a pawn used by Moriarty to get what he wanted from Sherlock.
Mary Morstan had always felt she had a simple soul, with simple needs and wants. She had often wondered why or how she had become a cold blooded assassin.
“I’ll explain everything in a moment, but let’s start with some questions. First of all, what is your legal name?”
“Um, asphyxiation, I think. From—no, that’s not it. Um, she didn’t have any drugs or alcohol. Oh wait! No, maybe drugs, yeah that’s it.”
More importantly, what the hell happened to his shoulder?
Martin could feel a headache coming on, but instead of rubbing his eyes or temples, he pinched the bridge of his nose, just like John would.
Even though he’d heard it a million times before, Martin still laughed, and suddenly felt very in the moment. All existential crisis aside, something about this warmth, this connection between John and Sherlock, felt familiar. It wasn’t the same as having Ben back, but it at least felt a little more familiar than the rest of this strange alternate world. Just like how John felt the need to follow Sherlock, for completely different reasons it was clear Martin needed him too. To what capacity, Martin was still unsure, but since he knew where this was heading he knew that soon enough he would figure it out.
“Mr. Watson? I have a few questions for you,” said the trauma specialist.
pondered Martin gloomily.
“We usually call it ‘dissassociative identity disorder’ and that wasn’t what I was writing. Although I do want you to explain to me how you could feel like two people at once.”
“Mr. Watson, we are going to run some scans to fully assess the damage in a moment here, but I can tell you with full certainty your legal name is John Hamish Watson. Your sister was in here only a few hours ago visiting. You’ve been in a coma for two months now from blood loss. I know you are likely having some memory issues, so maybe this Martin fellow was someone you met in battle. Regardless, we will get it all sorted out soon, so there is no need to panic,” said the doctor. He reached foreword to pat Martin’s hand in an assuring manner, but Martin ripped it away.
“But it wasn’t perfect. In what world would I imagine a very public, very messy divorce? And it was all in such vivid detail. Not to mention I don’t remember meeting you or Ben or anyone like that before the accident. Wasn’t I supposedly in the military?”
“Afghanistan. But look, I just need—”
He’d barely gotten his eyes open—it was so damn bright.
Martin bit his lip. He’d sort of shot off the text without thinking. It seemed that Martin’s lack of filter mixed with John’s adrenaline-junkie habits made a bad combination when it came to tact. Plus, admittedly, both aspects of himself were flirts, whether they wanted to admit it or not.
In one sense, Martin knew these were the lines from the first episode, but paired with the last text it took on a new connotation. Sherlock really wanted to entice John home. Despite the continuous feeling that he was in a bad reproduction of Groundhog Day, Martin felt excited to get there.
Martin was uncertain about a lot, but one of the oddest aspects of being John Watson was the unexpected bursts of suppressed attraction. Sure, Martin always had a notion John was in love with Sherlock, but, God, the man was a mess half of the time.
Hey sorry for the lack of an update, I've been dying of the plague lately and this has been the last thing on my mind. It's a short update but I hope you like it. Thanks for all the lovely comments on my last chapter!
Anyway, sorry for the ramble. I'm planning on this fic spanning episode one, but obviously a bent version of it in which Martin makes his own choices. I hope it's reading well. Tell me what you thought about my choices below, as I was very uncertain about the conversation between Sally and Martin, as I don't want Martin to come across as too much of a prick since I think he's really a nice guy at heart, just like JW.
“Hello,” replied Sherlock, non-plussed. Without Stamford to introduce him, Martin felt a little silly barging in like this. Furthermore, Sherlock wasn’t delivering the usual lines, the ones where he assumed John’s military service, and whatnot. Instead he was watching Martin with a puzzled look on his face. Martin cleared his throat.
The doctor whispered something to the nurse, who hastily exited the room looking frightened. The doctor cleared his throat awkwardly and sat on the end of Martin’s bed. He’s got a look on his face, one that is infuriatingly placating and worrisome at the same time. He also appeared a touch afraid.
Neither outcome occurred as the next morning, Martin woke with the sunrise. Both Martin and John were early risers: Martin, from erratic shooting schedules, and John, from the military service. It seemed that before his eyes even opened, Martin knew what he was going to do that day. He shoveled down some tea and toast, then hopped in the next cab, bound for St. Bart’s Hospital.
“Yes, I do feel awful I hope Rachel hasn’t been scared off – he will never forgive us then.”
He coughed and looked at his feet, looking a bit awkward. “Erm....speaking of which...err where d-do we go from here?” He saw John roll his eyes at himself, maybe Three Continents Watson had been in retirement too long.
“That’s not fair John, you know I have little experience and what I do have is a drug fuelled haze.” The volume of his voice was rising. “You wanted to be with Sarah and all those other simpering girlfriends and your nickname is Three Continents Watson! You loved-“
Mycroft barked out a laugh. “No. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you’ve been reading romance novels.”
John resists the urge to cross his arms or legs. After his time in the military, he’s used to being undressed in front of other men, but as he takes in Mycroft’s hungry look, he’s never felt so naked before.
“I’ll take that as a yes unless you say otherwise.”
“You know, there is one thing,” Greg said slowly. “Not to get your hopes up or anything, but I’ve never seen him, well, he’s never
“Well now that you mention it –“
“Thank you for understanding.”
"Well, I wasn't really planning to attend. It's such a boring concept, don't you think? Still, I found tonight surprisingly enjoyable.” He smirks, intently watching John squirm a bit under such scrutiny.
John sat back and considered. “Ok. So what exactly does
John tries to allay his insecurities. “Just relax.”
You: John swallowed. Why did Sherlock have to be sex personified? "Need a distraction then before you blow up the kitchen in some experiment?"
Surprised, Greg fall back on the chaise. He looked up at the vampire, sprawled out and vulnerable. Mycroft smirked down at him. He slowly ran a hand up Greg’s thigh. “Is this some unvoiced fantasy of yours, pet? Blushing virgin given to a vampire lord to be used for his pleasure?” he purred, pushing Greg backwards.
Greg’s eyes flashed up at him. “Yes sir,” he said, easily slipping into their normal play.
“Hey, wait a minute. It sounds like I’d probably like to know what I’m getting into.”
John laughed. “Sherlock. Please. You really think I’d offer myself up if I didn’t want it?” He grabbed the vampire’s hand and pressed it against the bulge in his slacks.
Slowly, Mycroft moved his mouth up Greg’s stomach and torso, pausing every inch to bite into the soft tempting skin, tasting what was uniquely Gregory Lestrade. By the time he reached Greg’s collar bone, the human beneath him was writhing, fingers clutching his normally tidy hair.
John’s head was titled to the side, and he cried out when he felt two sharp fangs slice through the skin. It
“You had the same…thing?”
“For how long?”
Mummy Holmes clapped her hands and pulled Sherlock’s hands into her own. “Oh I’m so proud of you. My darling baby boy all grown up. Getting ready to enter into the long honorable tradition of bringing a child on a healthy omega.” She cupped Sherlock’s face and patted his cheeks. He glanced behind her at Mycroft, who smirked and shrugged, as if to say, What? You want me to upset Mummy?
Greg smiled a bit, remembering when Mycroft had brought him to the same office a couple of years ago to go through the same ritual. “Yeah. Scared me to death actually.”
Sherlock is actually surprised when he comes a second time. He rarely surrenders to the primal urges that distract other people. He is...supposed to be above such urges. Still, his body shudders in sympathy with John’s orgasm and his cock manages to spurt a bit more seed to mix with John’s on his skin.
Sherlock palms John’s cock through his pajama bottoms, steel eyes bright. “Do you want help with this?”
Stranger: "Aren't you warm, then?" He asked curiously, stepping closer until he was a hair's width from John's body. He reached out and felt his throat, slipping his hand over his shoulder and arm.
Stranger: Is it because you get aroused? SH
service?”
“So maybe he won’t be interested in…”
After the vampire ran out of complaints with a huff, John touched his forearm. “You need to feed. It's been too long since the last time you had nourishment,” he said, using his stern-doctor voice.
“John, look, I’m in the same boat. I’ve been there. Trust me when I say that at this point of your connection between you and Sherlock, there’s nothing you can say that I probably haven’t already experienced.”
Sherlock wriggled his arse in response and stared ahead obediently. John pulled the small tube of lube out of his pocket and slicked up a finger. He braced himself on Sherlock’s hip and pushed a slick finger through the slit and into his boyfriend’s tight arse. Sherlock arched in surprise.
“Look. It’s dangerous. This fucker has an armory in there and he’s a bit unstable. Stay here and protect the medical team that’s on backup, ok?”
“It’s been a couple of years now. We, well,
“Ah. Excellent,” Sherlock said. With that, he began to move, pulling his hips back and pushing back in until he had setup a steady rhythm.
John glanced at him and smiled. “Just what are you trying to tell me, Sherlock.”
John watched him leave, and then fell into a fitful sleep in which he dreamed of a dark haired vampire whose voice alone made him shiver. When he awoke later, he was alone, which was a good thing considering that he had cum in his jeans.
John paid the driver and got out, standing next to his lover, placing a hand on Sherlock’s lower back. “We’re family, love. Family spends time together. Besides, Greg says that Mycroft’s amazing at making salmon, which he’s making for us tonight.”
“What do you mean? What am I looking for?”
Sherlock managed to hold himself still, despite the primal urge to move. He growled softly. “Yesss,  but you like it when it hurts,” he purred. As if in demonstration, he let one claw grow and used it to slice a thin line on John’s leg. John whimpered.
Sherlock’s eye slipped closed and he moaned in ecstasy. How could he have gone nearly 200 years without tasting this?
“Marking? Yeah. It’s called a simul sanguis claim.”
Mr. Melbourne frowned and beside John, Sherlock froze, eyes focused on the book on the desk.
Mycroft caressed his hair and placed soft kisses on head. “You’ve made me very happy, Gregory.”
Greg frowned. “He’s got to be too old for that.”
Mycroft moved forwards and smoothly pushed Greg to lie on his back on the bed. He knelt and gently but forcefully spread Greg’s legs and moved to crouch between them. He completely ignored their witnesses and kept his focus solely on Greg. He could see the traces of lube around Greg’s hole. He teased a finger down his inner thigh, making Greg shiver, legs falling open a bit more in submission. Mycroft smiled and boldly pushed a finger into his prepared hole. Greg whimpered at the intrusion and his cock began to fill again.
“Well then, that’s that. Now let’s proceed. Mr. Holmes, if you will. We’ll need at five drops each.”
You: John broke from the kiss, panting. He rolle dhis head back so that he could say lowly in Sherlock's ear, "When I was wanking this morning, I imagined you telling me you were going to fuck me. Hard. And then you pushed inside me, making me take it."
“Ah, yes, thank you Anthea. I did ask for that.”
“Mycroft,” he said clearly.
John pulled back. “Do you – will your claws come out?”
“No. Alessandro is either incompetent, unpracticed, or very nervous and sloppy. Probably some combination thereof as he is young and somewhat impulsive. He used it far too heavily on you, which is why you felt woozy and slept afterwards. If used properly, you won’t subsequently feel negative effects.”
John chuckled. “Now I’ve got an image of Mycroft Holmes sitting around waxing poetic, composing long ballads and odes.”
“You want my knot don’t you, Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s pale blue eyes focused back on his mother and he smiled. Or tried to while she pressed his face between her delicate hands.
“Dr. Watson, have you considered the general ramifications of this ritual?”
Greg whimpered and let himself submit completely, going limp on the divan. “Please. Sir please I need more.”
When the broke apart, Sherlock roughly grasped John’s chin. “You don’t know what you’re offering.” His voice was dangerously low.
John growled and sped up. He could feel something odd and pleasurable happening in his cock. He pulled out all the way and looked down. The knot was there. It had formed as blood pooled there, preparing to fulfill his natural drive to breed a willing omega.
“Then why –“
John stood with him, hesitant to go back to the party without Sherlock at his side. Particularly after the dark look that Allessandro had given him as he went downstairs. They were, as Sherlock had explained, there as guards. Vampires were particularly tired after bonding and it was a custom to ask someone trusted to keep watch while they recovered.
Mycroft and Greg moved towards the door, the vampire’s hand on the latter’s lower back. Before walking out the door, Mycroft turned to his brother, who was standing now, poised to begin playing, and hissed softly, “Sherlock, as thrilled as I am that you’re taking responsibility of John, don’t you think it would be prudent to discuss these things with himself and with me ahead of time?”
John leaned on his elbows and looked up at him. He was breathing heavily and he watched as the vampire toed off his shoes and socks, all the while keeping his eyes on the man on the bed. John started to unbutton his shirt but Sherlock stopped him.
“Have you set a date?” John asked.
Greg snorted. “A long month more like it. It took a long time to set this up. So glad that bastard is off the streets.”
“I suppose you did have a long day,” Mycroft said with a smile.
As Sherlock plunders John’s mouth, Mycroft unbuttons his shirt to reveal his toned chest. He smiles and leans down to place soft kisses along John’s collarbone and then down, down the pale chest to the faint trail of hair leading down and disappearing beneath black slacks.
Licking his lips, John took up his spot, leaning back against the wall, arms crossed, and waited.
“No, not unpleasant. Just – strange.”
Sherlock’s lips quirked just a bit in response. “I thought you might wish to take the time to pack your things so that you might leave Baker Street as soon as the contract expires at noon.” He looked back down at his notes.
Stranger: Sherlock swallowed thickly and nodded. "Yes, John." He sat up and spread the blonde's legs apart, then spit in his hand. He didn't have lube because sex before meeting John didn't interest him. He smiled down at him and moved his fingers in between John's legs. "Relax for me, John."
“What did he want to know?” Sherlock asked almost the moment John walked in. He was in the kitchen looking intently at something on a slide under the microscope.
Stranger: "I do believe that there is a need to celebrate my solving of this case." Sherlock pushed John down until he was laying with his back to the mattress and Sherlock loomed over him. "But remember, John. I am also the criminal," he winked, leaning down to nip over his neck.
John let out a breath he hadn’t known he had been holding, and he let his head fall back against Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock chuckled softly. “Vampires can, if we choose, make a commitment not entirely unlike human marriage. However, it is rather more…permanent. A blending of souls, if you will. It’s not something to be undertaken lightly.”
John notes the derision dripping from the words. “Erm, right?” he asks, pulling the blanket up to cover himself and turning on the bedside lamp. He blinks up at his flatmate.
You: john yelped, body jerking
Sherlock Holmes: Sex doesn't alarm me.
Stranger: Greg leaned into the gentle touch of Sherlock's fingers, a sigh escaping his lips. "Yeah? That's good to know."
You: "Solved it? Solved what?"
“Kiss me. It will help you feel like you have more control and therefore ease some of your anxiety over the situation in which you find yourself.”
They were silent until the car reached 221B. Sherlock managed to rouse John enough to guide him inside, and then he carried him up the stairs and deposited him on the couch. Sherlock covered John with a blanket from his bed. He could hear his heartbeat, slow and steady. Sherlock knelt next to the couch and gently tilted John's head to the side. Two rough puncture wounds were visible. The skin was red and irritated, and Sherlock felt another growl rising in his throat. He was tempted to find Alessandro and rip his throat out. Instead, he leaned down and carefully licked the wounds, healing them. The scent of John welled up, tempting him to bite and take, but he shook his head, quickly moving across the room to the window.
“Yes,” Greg said resolutely, and took his hand.
“The reses. It will make you sluggish. It’s a skill that Alessandro is apparently not very skilled in since he seems to have overdosed you. You shouldn’t be this soporific if he knew what he was doing.”
“Don’t act stupid, brother. Are you going to bond with Lestrade?”
John smiled ruefully and shrugged. “I guess you could say it’s not as bad being in service as I thought it would be…Should I, well. I mean, you think it’s significant that he’s feeding right from my wrist, right?”
Greg nodded, eyes focused on some point across the room. “You could say that. What brought that up?”
Stranger: "You're hard, already?" Sherlock raised a brow in interest. "Naughty boy," he whispered, trailing his hand in between John's legs and lightly stroking one finger up his length.
Alessandro laughed. “Sempre il politico, Mycroft. Avevo dimenticato quanto scivoloso si è.” He looked closely at Lestrade, sniffing the air. “Non solo portare il vostro marchio, ma lui sa di te.” He took another step forward but was stopped when Mycroft bodily stepped between them. “Ah. Si prende più cura del vostro animale domestico che il vostro fratellino.” He threw Sherlock a smirk. Sherlock snarled, lips pulled back to show his teeth in an animalistic motion.
“I seem to be an omega,” Sherlock stated.
You: The hand that wasn't buried in Sherlock's dark wet locks reached down. John pulled his arse cheek to the side, giving Sherlock's cock room to shift into his cleft. He moaned at the feeling.
John glanced at Sherlock, who appeared impatient but resolved. The silence spread out and John had the chance to process what had happened. The bonding ceremony had been intense, personal, intimate. But his own reactions….He leaned against the wall and stared down the empty hall. He had not missed the speculative looks he had been getting. Sherlock Holmes had never taken a partner for long, human or otherwise, and had never shown interest in companionship. And now he had been seen with John at his side. Did the family like the idea of both Holmes brothers with humans? John didn’t know. But witnessing Mycroft of Greg’s bonding had naturally put the thought into his head. Was that something he wanted? Could he seal himself to Sherlock like that?
John took an involuntary step back.
Sherlock snarled at his mobile. Mycroft was an interfering twat. He was sorely tempted to text something back that he knew was childish and biting. Possibly about needing to tie Lestrade down to keep him by Mycroft’s side. He restrained himself though, knowing that any such reply would only serve to encourage his brother.
“That is correct.” He sat back slowly, leveling John with his intense gaze. “It is never untaken lightly by one of our kind because of the long-term responsibility it entails.”
“Of course. It would be rather inconvenient for you to come here by way of the coffee shop whenever I need you.” Sherlock picked up a knife and casually twirled it between his fingers. If it cut skin, John couldn’t tell. “Besides, that dreadful little place where you’ve been living, if you can call it such, is utterly depressing.”
“Mm, they do. But this is a bit more involved. This picture will go into the Holmes family registry. Dressing well also, according to Mycroft, lends a more serious note to the occasion.” He said this last bit while mimicking is brother’s cultured voice.
John giggles softly, mind threatening to overload at the sheer oddness of it all as his eyes slip down his body to where Sherlock's hand is still pressing on his cock through the blanket. When he looks up, he catches Sherlock’s eyes moving up from the point of contact.
“Erm, well, yes. He has. Several times.” John shifted uncomfortably.
“Come now, John. I’m sure the situation is not so hopeless.”
John came. Hard. He shuddered and cried out between their bodies and then went limp beneath the vampire.
Mycroft smiled tightly, chin lifting in defiance, his eyes narrowing. “"Questo non è anche la tua azienda fino a diventare ufficiale, se mai."
Sherlock’s words from yesterday morning crossed John’s mind as the black limousine with black tinted windows rolled up next to him. His mobile buzzed.
Greg suddenly found himself to be the target of four sets of sharp eyes. He gave them a shy smile.
John smiles nervously. It feels like a trap is closing in but he can’t really see its edges. “Well,” he says, taking a sip, “I’m sure I can find a guest room or three to use.”
“Noted,” John replied, lips quirked up in a small smile.
“Was that helpful? For your hypothesis?” John finally says breathily, licking his well-kissed lips.
“Fuck you feel amazing,” John ground out, panting.
Stranger: "Aren't you warm, then?" He asked curiously, stepping closer until he was a hair's width from John's body. He reached out and felt his throat, slipping his hand over his shoulder and arm.
As John finished shaving in the bathroom mirror, he let out a soft sigh and braced his hands on the counter. He stared at himself. What are you worried about? He asked himself. The contract is over. Today’s the last day. You’re free. Isn’t that what you wanted from the start? Shaking his head at himself, he finished his morning routine.
What the hell was he going to do? Sherlock would be back in a couple of minutes expecting a dripping wet omega. And then what? Two alphas can’t mate. Their marriage would be annulled. How could the genetic tests be so wrong?
Finn was the first one to see him?
John giggled and flicked the kettle off, turning in Sherlock’s arms. “Lead the way my dear fellow, I am all yours.”
His knees gave out and he succumbed to the sobs overtaking his body.
He was at his microscope in the kitchen, analysing brick dust that had been found at a double homicide that morning. It was the key to solving the case and Sherlock was giddy with anticipation. Although John was making tea.....distracting him.
His adrenalin levels were skyrocketing almost as if he was on a case, but instead of running away from someone he was running towards someone, towards John.
13 days 6 hours and 42 minutes
The bomb in the swimming pool had made him realise he loved John, but he hadn’t fully accepted it until he was standing on top of a roof willing to die for him.
“Get Uncle Mycroft to fix the traffic lights and I will be there in 15 minutes.” Finn ended the call before waiting for a reply.
John felt for 10 year old Finn, feeling like he had to prove something, prove himself. "So how did we meet?"
-	- - - - -
“Exactly. So she was clearly sending a message to someone - she is part of an organisation or gang and has been wronged somehow. She has picked someone entirely random, so that we have little to go on to catch her. She is trying to bait someone to come out and play. I would start looking for people who look like this man or who have died in the same way. Or most likely both and you might get somewhere.”
John tried not to let his anger rise at Sherlock’s comments. “I can’t just waltz back in here Sherlock. I need to adjust to the fact that you are alive, sat across from me being your usual charming self.” John couldn’t help adding. More calmly he continued “We need an opportunity to get back to ‘normal’.”
John paused at this comment and some of the anger started to seep out of him “Sherlock are you.....jealous?”
“Yes.” He moved his hands to the other man’s shoulders. “He caught me out in one....I remembered the night he told us he loved us.”
“If Irene Adler had never sent that text and made you jealous..” Sherlock quipped, as he stroked John’s hair in comfort.
Finn’s eyes stare at him in anger, watering with unshed tears. “Bullshit!”
I have had a bit of writer's block, so those of you who are still reading - thank you. This chapter is a flashback to the past after the boys professed their love! Thank you for all the kudos and comments - they keep me going! As always Sherlock doesn't belong to me and it's all just for fun.
Sherlock watched as John looked blankly around their flat. His husband was putting on a brave face, but Sherlock knew nothing was registering. The memories hadn’t come flooding back. Would they ever?
“So when did things develop?” John interrupted “When you were....away?”
He took a drag on the cigarette, a necessary vice to calm his thoughts. He looked down at the ring on his left hand and thought about that day in the alley when John had proposed. He had felt so happy and loved in that moment, it really had been perfect. Now those feelings felt so foreign to him, so unattainable. They were as wispy and fleeting as the memories themselves.
Sorry there was a bit of a delay with this one. This takes place about a month after Sherlock returns from the dead. I refer to events from The Empty Hearse, so if you haven't seen that this might not make sense. Again I am exploring how things may have gone, if Mary wasn't around. Thank you for the kudos and comments, they mean a lot and keep me going. Warnings and more notes at the end of the chapter
“Well I don’t know what else to do!....John has been through a ridiculously tragic and confusing thing and he’s stuck with me to help him through it. First time around I wasn’t trying to make him love me. I was trying to impress him sure and show him some excitement, but I never imagined I would end up with.... feelings. By the time I had accepted I was in love with him, he already knew everything about me and all my faults, so I didn’t need to change anything about myself.”
The doctor nodded back and headed towards his coat. He clutched it in his arms and abruptly turned back to look at the other man. “I....”
John and Mary were getting married.
Silence ensued, until he heard a muffled “If I tell you, you won’t like what I did and then you won’t love me anymore. So I am not going to tell you, because I want to be who I am now, not who I was then”
Finn looked incredulously at them all “Has anybody thought to check the roof?” There is a gasp from Molly and a startled look on the others’ faces.
His brother stared at him, a smirk forming on his reptile face. “My my Sherlock 7 years later and you finally have the guts to bring it up. I’m impressed, alas I wasn’t referring to Gregory, although recent events have made me re-evaluate my feelings, our dealings thus far have been purely of a primal nature.”
“And we would be without Finn.”
Sherlock was unsure of how long they stood there; John sobbing into his chest, Sherlock’s head resting on top of his husband’s and his hand curled around his neck.
After the police had arrived and they had assured Lestrade that they would return to produce a statement, they had still been high on the adrenalin of the evening. They had headed out into London, bought fish and chips and ended up wondering around aimlessly.
John was sitting in a coffee shop by the window, so he could be seen easily. He had a pot of tea in front of him and kept glancing through the rainy window; the lettering from the name of the cafe obscuring his view. He had got here way too early, nerves playing a part.
Finn stood and handed the Belstaff back to his father “He’s alive Dad, he’s alive – that’s the first step.”
“Sherlock “ he whispered.
“I think the therapist might be right.” Sherlock had offered and he had felt John’s arm tighten around him, his fingers stroking his shoulder. He had looked up to the other man, finding his tired blue eyes. “Now that we are a family Finn thinks that everything is going to go down hill.”
He needed Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled and brushed a few happy tears from John’s cheeks. “Yes it is”
“You know he will listen to me and he needs a reminder of what he still has to live for.”
“And you were dead for a year.” John countered, eyes hard.
Sherlock wouldn’t remember much of what happened next. Of the killer disappearing into the crowd, of the shocked screams and exclaimed words of the people around, of the inhumane noise that was ripped from his throat at the sight before him, of the pale face of the driver, shaking all over as she left her car to see the carnage she had caused.
“What do you mean? Were you at the hospital?”
Sherlock joined him not long afterwards, his Belstaff gone and replaced with his distinctive dressing gown. He faced him, with his legs elegantly crossed, teacup balanced delicately on his left knee. He was gorgeous like this, John couldn’t stop staring at those long legs.
He had found a surprised, but happy Sherlock at 221b.Then.....
“Oh I think it is.” As he started full out laughing.
He flailed inelegantly and started to fight against the arms around him.
“Sherlock” John was looking away at this point.
“Sherlock” John warned.
He had never in his wildest dreams imagined that it would be him who would win the doctor’s heart or that in fact he had won it a long time ago.
Finn pulled his father towards him and sobbed onto his shoulder. “It means so much to me that you remembered something and especially that.”
The detective brought his left hand to cradle John’s on his face “Because you nearly died John – do you realise that?” Sherlock was getting teary now too. “A mad woman stabbed you and pushed you into traffic.” He paused and stared right into John’s soul “I thought I watched you die. I could cope with a little memory loss in the circumstances.”
-----------------------
John had still looked bemused, but had humoured him and responded. “Well I guess flowers were always a winner."
The other man composed himself as much as he could and flounced into the room. Finn had stopped crying and he could see the curious look on his face at his emotional state. “I am deducing that you have become emotional from the topic of our conversation and my distressed state.” Finn ventured.
“Sorry that was insensitive”
“I know” Molly replied without a trace of doubt. She opened the door to a private room, where Mycroft and Lestrade were talking hurriedly in the corner. “Where’s Sherlock?” she demanded.
He stood and placed a kiss on his cheek, avoiding the bandages on his forehead. “There’s a case John!” he said in mock enthusiasm “Leatrade says it’s a ten, but it’s probably barely a seven. He’s been pestering me to get out of this hospital and leave you and.....I couldn’t.” He could feel that goddamn emotion finding it’s way to the surface. “But then your voice was in my head, telling me that what I was doing was a bit not good, so I’m going to go. I’ll be back soon, not a Sherlock soon, but actually soon. Finn will be here in an hour or so, after Uni and I can tell you all about the case when I’m back. I’ll probably solve it in seconds. Lestrade has become more incompetent in our absence, so I must go.” He leaned down and kissed John’s other cheek and moved to leave.
“I like the results of you overreacting.” He joked and he could see in his peripheral the other man’s half smile at this.
“Finn has gone to Rachel’s to tell her the news, he'll be back later for dinner.” Sherlock answered his gaze. John nodded in acknowledgement and smiled, the detective always knew what he was thinking.
“No I’m finished here.” Sherlock replied, as he handed John a mug. They headed back to the living room and Sherlock stopped in his tracks, as he saw John sit down in his chair.
The doctor didn’t know what to make of that. If Mycroft couldn’t help with it then it must be something serious or......something to do with emotions. Ok John could deal with this, Finn had thrown an unending amount of curveballs their way and they now had a teenager in their home, who needed their support. Well maybe it was a good job that John had been the one to come home, as he doubted Sherlock would be much help with ‘normal teenage boy stuff’.
John was pretty overwhelmed by that. “You are an extraordinary human being Finn Watson-Holmes.”
He was afraid of what came next. He was afraid of what was behind that door. He didn’t have his son’s bravery or his husband’s courage. He had logic and reason....but he also had love, despite the disadvantages, he had to hold on to that.
“What? How?”
“I don’t know. It seems that sometimes I don’t know how to… live my truth, or whatever. It doesn’t make much sense. Is there a medication that I can take to make this all stop?”
Martin rolled his eyes. If this were for some kind of reality TV show, he was going to get someone fired. Fucking hell. He couldn’t remember anything that happened or even how he ended up in the damn hospital bed. And really, why were all these people so bent on pretending he was John Watson?
Or, if the people around him were to be trusted, John Hamish Watson.
For instance, as the stood in the crime scene for A Study in Pink, Martin watched Sherlock as he worked, speaking aloud some of his deductions as he examined the dead body. Martin expected certain emotions to bubble up. He figured John would be in awe of Sherlock, or maybe intrigued by the mystery, or possibly even a little embarrassed when asked to give his medical opinion. Likewise, out of nowhere, a thought popped up in Martin’s head, loudly and in his “John Watson voice.”
Martin flipped off the security camera before hailing a taxi.
As he sat in the cab on his way home, however, Martin began to wonder how this universe would function. Would he run into an old colleague while out who would introduce him to a man who looked stunningly like Ben, but acted like a complete lunatic? Or was he instead destined to the alternate hell where Watson stewed in his lonely post-war misery until the day he died?
Without knocking on the door, Martin breezed in to find—just as in the show—Ben slapping a corpse with a belt. Only it wasn’t Ben, but rather the character he played on the show. Ben and Sherlock held themselves differently. Martin was sure he did the same to an extent, but really he wasn’t as physical an actor as Ben. It was something he greatly admired about his friend’s skills. As soon as he stopped to look at him Ben—er, Sherlock’s—face scrunched up as his eyes scanned Martin’s body.
“However, I currently have a string of suicides begging for my attention, so it seems you will have to wait, my dear Watson,” said Sherlock briskly as he stood. Before Martin could collect his whit’s, the taller man winked, sending Martin’s heart slamming in his chest.
“You think you have questions,” muttered Martin in shock.
Martin had felt it, but assumed that the dull ache was just from sitting down for so long. Really, he hadn’t taken the time to assess his extremities. He was too pissed.
When John didn’t respond, Martin let out a long sigh, only to realize, blinking, that Sherlock disappeared down the stairs. Just as in the first episode, when he finally made his way to the street, Martin was accosted by Donovan and Sherlock was gone.
Yes, he’d heard a bunch of those lines before, but Sherlock really was just as impressive as the man on the page.
He continued to watch Martin, as Molly delivered her next line.
He knew it was a bad sign to speak to the voices in his head, and likely more evidence of the fact that he really was crazy, but Martin was almost relieved at the response. If nothing else, he could be frank with John.
Martin reflected on this. In fact, it seemed to be that not only was Sherlock right, but he’d made Martin realize that yet again, he and John had something in common. Being an actor meant that Martin spent plenty of time listening to the feedback of directors, producers, and agents. Creating a character was certainly creative work, but a lot of what Martin did was take directions—and take directions well.
“Sure, it’s a piece of shit anyway,” replied Martin. He handed the taller man the slider phone. Maybe Martin was a bit of a princess now, but not only was this an old phone, but it wasn’t even an iPhone. They had iPhones in 2010, was it really necessary for the writers to make John such a stick-in-the-mud?
“Now that’s very interesting.”
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow and flicked his eyes up and down Martin’s form. He squirmed a bit. Was it even possible that this man could tell that he was reciting from a script? Was Sherlock smart enough to deduce something like that? He gave a sigh of relief when Sherlock went on with the next line.
“Really? I thought it was a big improvement—mouth’s too small now,” quipped Sherlock. Now that it wasn’t a line, and a camera wasn’t in between them, it came across to Martin just how rude that was, although he had little room to talk. Still, Ben would be apologizing for that to Louise as soon as the cameras turned off, ever the polite sweetheart even though Mark was the one writing the lines.
“Um, hullo,” said Martin in his John Watson voice. He frowned. Sometimes, John just seemed to slip out without him noticing.
“Your only next of kin listed was your sister Harriet.”
the character. That was how he was beginning to feel all the time, only Martin was still in there. Some nights, Martin had taken to keep a journal detailing stuff from his old life, like a bad fan page listing his birthday, his interests, his ex-girlfriend’s names. He felt, as time went on, that he was walking between two worlds and he truly was two people at once.
“Fascinating. I don’t think it’s just the trauma, John. There’s another element to it I haven’t figured out yet and I believe that what you see as your past life is the key to it. Tell me more about Martin and Benedict.”
“Piss off,” he said.
“I think you’re missing the point. It literally runs that deep, that crazy. We had different names. I knew you, but you were a completely different person and the lives we led—god, they were so different. It all probably doesn’t mean anything. I think my therapist is right—I’m just experiencing trauma,” spat Martin. He looked away and swallowed the hard lump in his throat, not that it mattered because it didn’t take an observant genius to see he was on the edge of tears. However, Sherlock leaned foreword, steepling his fingers against his plush lips.
She was right, yet again. More and more Martin felt memories bubbling up to the surface like fish dying in a pond, floating to the top, all distinct and clear and painful. Sure, he’d imagined this type of backstory when fleshing out his portrayal of Watson, but to actually feel the pain and longing of his made up childhood was a whole other game. It wasn’t play acting anymore. It really sucked to be John Watson.
“Is this a fucking joke?” growled Martin, slamming the phone against the mattress. As the “trauma specialist” sat down next to Martin, he turned his head away like a belligerent child, only to discover a mirror hanging on the opposite wall to his bed. Upon seeing the mirror, Martin couldn’t help but let his mouth fall agape.
“Typically, that’s how many crazy people introduce themselves, but do go on,” replied Sherlock. His gaze penetrated Martin in the concentrated way that Ben mastered years ago, but a new emotion welled up inside Martin. His stomach, of it’s own accord, erupted into butterflies, and the need to suppress this feeling came with it. It was John’s reaction, but not the one Martin was expecting. He swallowed it down.
“It… wasn’t working for me,” she said.
“…. Okay,” she said meekly. Man, Martin forgot how lovestruck she was in the first episode. Poor Molly. She nodded and scurried out of the room, not meeting Martin’s eyes as she left.
“I get it, you’re a fan of the show. Now can someone tell me how I got into a bloody coma? How long have I been out?”
“What do they usually say?” he asked. Sherlock finally looked up, a cocky little grin painting the side of his lips, very much Sherlock and not at all like Ben.
“You know why he’s here? He’s not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. Weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up won’t be enough. One day we’ll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there.”
“Very funny.”
The answer was in the way Martin reacted. Usually, Martin Freeman—actor, father, normal person—would respond with a quip of some sort, something a little biting but charming enough to be disarming. As he opened his mouth to speak, however, some part of his brain that was John Watson—ex-military, thrill seeker, repressed bisexual—immediately wanted to clam up and politely hold in any feelings as to keep everyone at arm’s length. It made Martin a little dizzy, but at last he spoke a middle ground that seemed to appease both sides of him.
“Well all you’ve told me so far is that you’ve lost your memory in Afghanistan… but you clearly aren’t telling me what you think happened before that,” before Martin could open his mouth to speak, Sherlock held up a hand “You’re smart. You know telling me what you think happened will make you sound crazy. But it’s become clear to me from observing you that you had what you think was another life before this, and if you tell me what that included, I can start figuring out this case. Obviously, it’s not as exciting as our suicide case at the moment, but I believe that—”
“That’s an excellent question.”
It made sense, but Martin hated it.
“Well of course it was. It was extraordinary. Quite extraordinary,” said Martin. He made sure to say the lines word for word, because in this moment he needed to lean back on being John, even if he didn’t understand why.
More importantly, did Martin have any say in the narrative?
“I’ve been thinking about your case lately, and I’ve come to some… unexpected leads,” said Sherlock. Sherlock’s deep baritone sent a wave of feelings through the side of him that was John, but Martin also felt a growing cold spot in his stomach. He didn’t know if the detective could really figure this out—after all, Sherlock was only human, and this was clearly some kind of supernatural experience—but any evidence proving that Martin was crazy, and not actually experiencing something otherworldly, was both welcome and terrifying.
“And who is John Watson?” she shot back. Martin chuckled self indulgently and crossed his own arms.
“I’m not sure what you are talking about. You were shot in Afghanistan. The exit wound is in your shoulder. Can you feel it?”
Maybe in this world, Martin could allow himself to care back.
Sure, he liked to think he didn’t age much since the first season, but there were differences, 9 years took a toll on anyone. More lines on his face here or there, a bit of weight gain, a difference in his hair color, certainly. There was clearly a difference between 47 and 38, no matter what anyone said. And the Martin staring back in the mirror? That was 38 year old Martin Freeman.
“Are all your theories about your rivals at work this ridiculous?” Martin’s tone was light, but he watched Donovan with outer contempt and impatience “Oh, and let me guess— Lestrade is a BDSM swinger in a polyamorous relationship with the prime minister and Anderson. Sherlock’s been in on the whole thing for years, but it’s all a conspiracy. Is that right?”
A pause that lasts too long. He’s got his eyes open finally and standing before him in an overweight doctor and a nurse with too much make up on. The hospital room was dingy, not what he expected of the hospitals near set.
Martin tried to make the lines sound impassioned, just as he had in the show, but he was so emotionally exhausted by the day already it wasn’t coming out as his best work. Nevertheless, he dropped to the floor, trying to remember exactly what the lines were back in Season 1. Luckily, Martin remembered a decent amount from the first episode, despite it being so long ago, due to the fact they had to shoot the thing twice. He didn’t get everything exact, of course.
“Okay… like what?” Martin shoved his shaking palms into his coat pockets. For a brief moment, Sherlock’s bright eyes glanced at them.
Only it extended beyond legality. To his despair, Martin Freeman, and Martin Freeman’s entire family, didn’t exist in this universe.  No one had ever heard of Arthur Conan Doyle. His paychecks were no longer 6 figures, but just enough military funding to get by. Parts of it were comical—it wasn’t like Martin really cared about the loss of Hollywood glamour, and certainly there was no love lost for the paparazzi—but holy shit if there wasn’t both emotional and existential despair over the fact that Martin’s fucking kids, his ex-wife, his best friends—none of them existed. His whole life, career, and family were all gone, or worse, imagined. When “John” was assigned a therapist, he walked into the room to discover Tanya Moodie, only it wasn’t Tanya, the British actress on the BBC, but Ella, a concerned and patient therapist. He didn’t bother trying to explain this odd phenomena, at first, but like the Ella written by Steven and Mark themselves, she managed to have a bit of a break through. Well, after a few weeks, and a lot of griping on Martin’s part.
“You know what it was, you’ve read the papers,” said Sherlock. Martin stood up, dusting his hands off in a way that was too posh for John Watson.
“Look, I’m not sure the nature of your relationship,” at this Sally sneered, giving Martin an appraising look that was equal parts critical and disbelieving “But a bit of advice. Stay away from that guy.”
“That’s not what people usually say,” replied Sherlock. Martin knew the next two lines, but said it anyway.
“No. I promise you I’m taking this seriously.” The sincerity in Sherlock’s voice surprised Martin. He allowed himself to lean in again, knowing objectively that these feelings for Sherlock were all just part of his character, all devised for on-screen tension, but unable to resist indulging himself. Sherlock seemed to be leaning in too. Martin’s head spun. They were close enough that he could feel the heat of Sherlock’s minty breath.
“John Watson,” he replied simply. Sally frowned and crossed her arms.
“How do you feel about the violin?” asked Sherlock, right on cue. Luckily, Martin didn’t need to deliver the next lines, didn’t need to put on a show of exposition for the audience.
Right on cue, Louise Brealey entered the room, only she was really Molly Hooper. Martin took his eyes away from Sherlock for a moment to watch her. God, he just wanted to reach out and ask Louise what was going on. The urge to shake the people around him until they started talking like his castmates was overwhelming. But really, this wasn’t Louise, but clearly Molly, timid and sweet.
Martin Freeman, just as much as I
“Why? Because he’s a high functioning sociopath or—whatever?” shot back Martin. The part of him that was John was blanching at the frankness. Martin wasn’t mad at Sally, per say, but ever since he’d read the first iteration of her in the script, he always found he didn’t care for the character. That was the point, wasn’t it? Moffat and Gatiss were good writers—they knew how to make unlikable characters just as well as they knew how to make likable ones. To some extent, Martin figured Sally meant well, but more importantly she was using John’s nativity as an opportunity to be catty and nosy. One clear difference between John and Martin was that Martin knew how this all ended—he knew what all four seasons led up to. And one thing that would be unclear to John for in 2, maybe 3, series was that Sherlock cared for John almost instantly. Sally was planting that seed of doubt in this moment, and while John wanted to hear her out, Martin was having none of it.
“… What?”
“Hello?”
“Yeah, yeah, the scratches on my phone or whatever the lines were. I get it, you can read me like a book. Let’s just skip the deduction thing for now, right? I’ve heard it a million times and I just want to skip ahead to the part where we already know each other,” said Martin. As soon as he spoke, the look on Sherlock’s face made him snap his mouth shut. Unlike John, Martin struggled to filter his thoughts. If his intention was to not seem like a crazy person, then it probably wasn’t coming across well if he started predicting the future all the time. Of course, Sherlock didn’t look perturbed by this as much as he looked intrigued.
“Sir… Your name is John Hamish Watson.”
It was odd, but if Martin walked with enough sense of security, people didn’t seem to stop him. Sure, if someone asked him what he was doing, he could inform him of John Watson’s doctor position, but really Martin just needed to appeared assured as he headed down the hallways to his destination. This wasn’t hard—he was an actor after all. It took a while but eventually he hunted down the room he was looking for.
“Piss off, you sound like my bloody therapist,” sniped Martin. He immediately softened, sagging down in defeat. “I’m sorry. It’s just… The gist of it is that we were. Coworkers. On a… film set. In a popular show called—bare with me—Sherlock. This was all before I met you that I thought this, I swear.” Martin dared to glance at Sherlock’s face, only to find the consulting detective somehow more intense, his pupils dilating just a smidge like they did in the show. How had Martin seen that? Were they that close together? With a blush, he scooted back, mentally chiding John for unintentionally moving them closer together.
“Martin Freeman.”
“Bloody hell—Dr. Melrose, he’s awake!”
“I, um, well—I have a case for you and I also need a place to stay. I know—I mean, I heard you solve cases and needed a roommate. Two birds with one stone, yeah?” asked Martin. In response, Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Martin’s head spun with visceral feelings of both attraction and shame. It was enough to make him stagger a bit, drawing the eyes of Lestrade and Anderson. Martin rightened himself with an embarrassed smile.
“You said it off hand the other day, in the cab: ‘See you later, Ben.’ Benedict isn’t a super common name, though, so I figured just Benjamin. I guess it works for me.”
“It’s fine, I love it, actually. If you play, I’m down. More importantly, how did you know I lost my memories?” asked John. Sherlock rolled his eyes, then held out his hand.
“Look, I swear I’m not a crazy person, but—”
Still throbbing with pain, Martin settled back against his pillow and nodded when Miriam, the nurse, handed him his phone. Only, it wasn’t Martin’s iPhone but John’s slider phone. From Season 1.
“One of the suicides, yeah?” said Martin. The scene continued and Martin relaxed, comfortably checking out as Sherlock tore up the scenery, as usual.
?! There is a woman lying
“I don’t think we are there yet. Actually, since our session is coming to a close today, let’s figure out what we are going to do to help with this. My personal suggestion is that maybe you spend some time with John Watson’s friends. Maybe that will help you feel a bit more in touch with your truth.”
Martin decided not to quip back about John having no friends, bar an upcoming “high functioning sociopath” he had yet to meet, and left the session feeling more hopeless than ever.
As he walked toward the main road, Martin was fuming over the conversation with Sally. It all felt a bit ridiculous. From John’s point of view, she was right—they barely knew Sherlock. And from Martin’s point of view his anger was pointless because they’d rehearsed these scenes loads of times and he knew how everyone felt about Sherlock at this point. Furthermore, Ben and Sherlock were different people, even if they had the same face, and Martin’s affection for the other man seemed pretty unwarranted. For all Martin knew, in this alternate universe, Sherlock truly was a sociopath and didn’t care at all about anyone. Still, it all seemed so wrong that Donovan would say such things about Sherlock, his new friend.
After the incident with the mirror, it didn’t take much more convincing for Martin to realize that this was some sort of fucked up alternate reality, a dream, or possibly (most likely) hell. He’d fallen on set, probably on something embarrassing like a prop or over ice, bonked his head, and promptly evacuated the entire fucking world as he knew it. Despite the fact Martin had no clue how he’d ended up in this world, somehow he was there, clear as day. This was a universe where he was, legally, John Hamish Watson.
“Yeah, yeah, just like in the show, right? What’s next, is Ben going to walk in an tell me we have a case? Fuck off. Where’s my phone? I need to talk to my agent and figure out what the fuck happened on set that landed me here,” said Martin. Likewise, when he twisted around to check the side table for his phone, a shooting pain ran up his shoulder and into the tendons of his neck. He hissed and collapsed foreword. Despite numerous scuffles as a teenager and plenty of accidents on sets, Martin never felt pain like that before. It was both blazing and numbing, and took a moment for Martin to catch his breath again.
Finding the safety switch had been a stroke of luck and Sherlock had had a moment of disbelief, before relief and happiness had took over. The resulting adrenalin had made him be bold in that moment, he had goaded John into forgiving him. Had withheld the truth for a minute so that he could seek a ‘deathbed’ confession. He hadn’t expected it to be so full of emotion, of care....of truth. He had been very close to kissing him in that moment and if the bomb really was about to go off he almost certainly would have done. Instead he had laughed and, unlike the restaurant, his ruse had been met with laughter and....acceptance. Seeing the amusement in John’s eyes had been sublime and a long forgotten treasure.
After what seemed like an eternity, John finally said “Well then” His tone was clipped and emotionless. “I only checked to see if you were ok, which you clearly are and this other John is going to take himself for a walk, let’s see where it takes me.”
John smiled and stood up to kiss Sherlock sweetly and forcefully. He giggled again and murmured “Perfect”.
John Watson was dead and he couldn’t save him.
The other man frowned at him “Yes of course I like her. I thought that was obvious.”
“I am not being dramatic!” Lestrade was going red. “If John were here right now, he would be saying ‘Make sure he’s alright, make sure he has something to do, don’t let him withdraw....Make sure I have someone to wake up to.”
John rushed back to him, leaving his own cup behind. He grabbed his son’s shoulders “Finn what is it?” he asked calmly, but firmly in his Dr Watson voice. The younger man’s eyes searched his own.
Sherlock frowned “John if you are unsure of what happens between two men when they have sex, I am sure there are many educational videos on the internet. I would also be happy to guide you through the basics, although I am a little surprised I must admit, as I had deduced you were at least bisexual, but perhaps you have not acted on that yet.”
Sherlock’s head and shoulders (now complete with his customary scarf and Belstaff) reared round the door to the kitchen. “John!” he expressed impatiently. “Come now! The game is on!”
Sherlock’s hands gripped the other man in retaliation “Don’t”. He responded firmly. He didn’t know what to say but it definitely wasn’t that.
Finn smiled “That’s all down to you and Dad Pops.”
His confusion must have shown on his face, as John shook his head and blushed. “I mean- how” he stuttered “how do we do this?” he moved his hands between the two of them.
“The bags under your eyes indicate lack of sleep, but your disposition indicates this is a good thing.”
“You know they have a designated shelter to smoke in?”
“No" John said as he stilled his movements. Sherlock lifted his eyebrows in disbelief. “I mean yes it is, of course, but I thought I heard something.” He pulled his gun out from the back of his trousers and motioned for Sherlock to follow him.
“I apologise” he heard quietly from behind him. “I am sorry” Sherlock continued and John closed his eyes in resignation. He could hear the pain in Sherlock’s voice.
Sherlock’s eye filled with confusion “But-"
Sherlock kissed him in response. “Me too, even when I have a moaning dominatrix on my phone.”
“I won’t give up on him” Finn stated.
Before Sherlock could answer the most surprising (and shocking?) sound emanated from the detective’s pocket. Finn immediately put his head in his hands and Rachel blushed bright red. Sherlock seemed unfazed and simply said “My apologies I forgot to put it on silent.”
It had been a few weeks since John and he had started sleeping together. At first it had been fun, exhilarating even. Sherlock had been overwhelmed by being able to touch John again, to share a bed (and various other places with him) and it had been wonderful. John was just as enthusiastic and inventive as he had always been and it had made a nice change from the walking around on eggshells they had been doing before.
“John no-“ Sherlock pleaded, but John’s hand halted his progress once again.
Finn’s coffee arrived, cream and syrup slathered on the top. “You would usually be able to pick up on a change in my...demeanour. You could tell if I was happier or quieter and Dad would deduce the rest. You two make a formidable team, no teenager would be able to keep a secret from you two, believe me I’ve tried.”
“When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” John whispered jokingly, Finn chuckled through his tears at the reference, and John looked over to Sherlock, who rolled his eyes.
John giggled this time “I don’t know if I am too bothered - it worked out quite well for me.” Sherlock smiled. “You have nothing to worry about though. There is no one else – I will always choose you.”
Now that the anger and hurt had faded, he realised he had been given a gift – a miracle that he had once begged for.
Once Mary had left he spent a long time in the shower himself, his head once again going round in circles. He wanted to talk to someone, but he hadn’t really built any friendships since the accident. Lestrade was an option, but, although he had always given him a sofa to sleep on, he had a vested interest in being Team Sherlock or at least Team John and Sherlock. Plus this felt too...intimate, too complicated. He needed someone who knew the way his mind worked, who would untangle his thoughts and wrap him in their arms.
Then there were the comforting hugs, the it’s not real anymore hugs, the I’m safe, you’re safe hugs – the hug that Sherlock could use right now. The last time he held John was the day he got hurt and it now felt like a physical ache to have that contact. It was all John’s fault of course, he didn’t need to be held before he met him. He had abhorred physical contact, unless it got him what he needed. Now he feels like he will never be warm again...
“I did” was John’s determined reply and Sherlock’s heart swelled.
Sherlock looked back up at his son. The younger man had lost his bravado and he could see hints of that lost little boy they had found all those years ago. He could see his vulnerability showing through the cracks.
It might have felt like a date, if Sherlock hadn’t just come back from the dead.
“Right, let’s go” John replied. Sherlock was tempted to say he would go on his own, but that would create more problems than it would solve.
“Hiding from your emotions how very Sherlock circa 2010.” John chuckled again, a few tears rolling down his cheek.
Sherlock was found by Finn eventually. He found himself staring at a shelf full of toilet rolls, when the sound of a lock being picked broke his thoughts. How long had he been sat here? He had been in his mind palace trying to lose himself in the wing called ‘John’.
Sherlock pulled away and looked directly into Finn’s eyes “Your father has a direct trauma to his frontal lobe and has been unconscious since impact. He is currently in surgery to help alleviate the swelling. There is a 87% chance he won’t open his eyes again and a 62% chance he won’t survive the operation. As we have not yet heard from my dear, old brother, his chances of surviving the current procedure are increasing.” Sherlock paused and looked at their joined hands. “He also suffered a fairly minor stab wound to his lower chest.”
Mycroft was....dishevelled and not in a ‘good’ way (he had seen him in such a state after he had called into a certain DI’s office – they both pretended that Sherlock hadn’t deduced that particular scenario numerous times over the past 7 years). His brother had a certain weariness about him; his ever-present tie and waistcoat were nowhere in sight and the detective deduced that he was on about his 6th cup of coffee. The older man was currently rolling his eyes at his brother’s comment.
The game wasn’t on. The game was over and Sherlock was tired of playing.
John was awake!
John took a few steps closer. “Well I can’t tell you that it’s not real, because it is. I wish it wasn’t, but....” he looked directly into Sherlock’s eyes. “You’re safe, I'm safe and you’re not alone.”
“Reconnecting.” Sherlock finished for him, eyes meeting his, before looking down at the floor.
Lestrade seemed like he was about to launch into an indignant speech, but seemed to shake himself out of it. “There’s a case. I would say it’s at least an 8 and it’s time sensitive, so I need your help.”
“God, did you hear anything I just said?” At Sherlock’s blank look, he continued. “I am trying to tell you something delicate here.”
Somehow he felt his legs moving and he stood up to face the distraught looking Sherlock. “I...I should er... go.”
“Don’t be so tedious John of course not. It’s my text tone.”
Sherlock giggled and that earned him a death glare. “The last time I saw you like this was when you were trying to explain how important Harry Potter was and you were frustrated that I wouldn’t take the Pottermore test about which house I was in.”

Sidenote: This chapter title has got the song from Enchanted stuck in my head for a few days!
“John-“ but the shorter man held out his hand to halt Sherlock’s sentence.
John stood in frustration at Sherlock’s words. He stomped away from his chair, his hands on his hips. “Because it seems everyone bloody else knew but me. I have forgiven you, but god that still hurts. Even after you have explained the whys and the hows; you trusted Molly Hooper before me....Now The Woman is back and once again things aren’t what I thought they were.”
So I always wanted John and Sherlock to talk about the fall and Mary got in the way, so this is my interpretation of how things could have gone.
Finally (within the 3 minutes he had) he spoke. “The killer is a woman. The break in through the window on the landing suggests that she was unknown to the victim, as he would have let her in if he knew her. She is of small stature and very skilled in hand to hand combat. I can’t see any evidence that the victim fought back. Despite her being a skilled fighter and clearly able to kill this man with her bare hands, she has shot the man through the mouth, almost as if she was making it look like suicide.”
“Yes well John is gone now and I don’t know how to be something other than those things.”
“Well I can actually help with that too.” Finn offered. “I can tell you about how we met and how I came to be you son.”
Another chapter that hopefully is the beginning of the end for the fic. In a good way! I have the outline planned out so hopefully have some structure in mind for the end of the story. Hope everyone is keeping safe and well. Warnings at the end of the chapter.
There was silence for a while, Sherlock was back to the overwhelming numbness he had experienced after the days of John’s accident. Finn was the only thing that had kept him focused then and the need to protect his son was starting to bring him out of the fog.
John couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “You had called me about the case hours ago – I thought you would have solved it and moved on to the next one. Why did you come to the hospital anyway?”
“No she hasn’t” his son argued “We’re still here.”
“God, you are the most infuriating man!” John finally managed to get his words out. “If you had just listened to me the first time or at least try again a second time-“
There was another silence from their young charge, before finally he heard a whispered. “I love you both two Dad.”
John and Sherlock have almost gotten back to 'normal' after the fall, but a blast from the past threatens to ruin everything.
“Reconnecting” John jumped in.
A year after Sherlock jumped
Flashback - Sherlock has been back from the dead for a month and John is still trying to come to terms with it. Through extreme measures our boys are brought back together.
“Ok, let’s hear it.” Finn gestured to their previous spot by the toilet rolls and they both settled back down on the floor.
Sherlock was numb, but the underlying hope from John’s words caused him to dumbly nod in acceptance. “I look forward to seeing you again John, whenever that may be.” He offered, his voice shaken.
His eyes found their way to his wedding ring again and he screwed his eyes up in frustration – his useless, inanimate brain was running round in circles.
“Oh do you have some good news to share?” she fished.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock rolled his eyes “Really John! I said that when I had known you less than a day. I appreciate that you might not want to hear this. You have consistently stated that you are ‘not gay’” Sherlock air quoted, which John did not appreciate. “And you shoot down any notion that we may be a couple.” He sighed “But I cannot let you continue to fixate on Irene Adler and Molly Hooper. How could they compare?”
Maybe you had to be in love with your sidekick to enjoy them and their stupidity. Sherlock had certainly missed John’s stupidity...his statements of the obvious and his interest in the inane.
He ignored the questions laid at his door, too focused on the task at hand “So have you told her how you feel?”
“You’ve got a new girlfriend” Sherlock deduced, as he pulled away from the embrace.
He couldn’t help John.
“I bet I can solve it within 10 minutes.”
“Never” he said vehemently, John looked up. “I can’t imagine how hard this is for you, but no one is to blame except the woman who did this to you.”
“I have no doubts.” John reassured him with a whisper in his ear. “As long as you don’t leave me for some crazy dominatrix, we’ll be fine.”
He looked back over to Finn. Love also had its advantages, Sherlock reminded himself in a voice that sounded suspiciously like his husband’s.
John nodded “Yes...I will still be a part of Finn’s life. He means the world to me” John looked at Sherlock “And so do you.”
“No he's alive.” Lestrade clarified.
John furrowed his eyebrows “Well I would say dramatic.”
It was only when he had been standing on a roof that he realised that he was completely in love with him.
“I think you wore me out.” John joked.
“See that!” the tall man pointed excitedly “This fictional version of yourself would have reacted in exactly the same way. Yes there are things I miss or things I wish you remembered, and that’s what last night was about, but you are my John. I know now it is severely unlikely your memories will return and I am more than fine with that.”
“Mrs Hudson” he heard Sherlock groan around his shoulder, before he pulled away and turned towards their landlady.
John laughed “We have always Mycroft as a fail safe too.”
He had been on his best behaviour before the bomb, but now that he had been forgiven, he had found that behaving was boring.
John felt the sofa dip with the weight of another person, as unbelievably Sherlock joined him on it. A ridiculously pained “John” was heard and an arm was felt around him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes “Enough John, stop being an idiot.”
Caring was not an advantage, love was not an advantage - it rendered you useless.
When Sherlock had stopped his kissing descent along John’s torso at the sound of his phone. He had looked at John expectantly, as if asking permission. John had laughed and said “I know the man I married – go on check it.”
She had tried and failed several times to grab their attention, pull them into a trap, but something had always worked against her. She had started to lose hope as the years rolled by, as their happiness had been continually flaunted in her face. But she had had to believe it would come together, all this determination, time, blood, sweat and tears couldn’t have been for nothing.
“Sherlock your point?”
On the positive side of things his relationship with Finn was going from strength to strength. They had started to meet up regularly one on one and he was enjoying getting to know the young man. He was also finding more about their shared history without feeling the pressure of living up to the man he wasn’t anymore.
“Don’t add the possibility of other men into the mix – I’ll be getting jealous of Lestrade next.”
Warnings: mention of a dead body
“How I feel? – John I- She knows how I feel. Why are you-“
John laughed at that, “So tell me about it. How did we meet?”
“I do” he whispered. “I need help in being normal.”
“Sherlock” John interrupted, a tinge of anger in his tone. “From what you know of me and my character before I met you, does any of that indicate I would abandon any child of mine?”
John didn’t remember him. He didn’t remember their love, their cases, their adventures, their son....their life.
“Tell me what you think happened” Finn encouraged eagerly.
John chuckled and said “I think someone has been eavesdropping. Sherlock?”
“It looks.....cosy?” John questioned, as he eyed the gunshot holes on the wall.
It had to be perfect.
-	- - - - -
Sherlock smirked. His dear John, making ordinary things extraordinary.
He knew what to say.
“Sherlock, now is not the time for stupid questions, you will not get a rise out of me. You know why I am here.” He replied, keeping his voice low, as his eyes reached Finn’s sleeping form.
He turned to the blonde occupying the bed. “Yeah fine, just woke up from a dream.”
“Sherlock-“ the smaller man started to berate, but it came out deep and breathy.
John hadn’t liked it. It had made him feel....unsettled.
The doctor put his finger on the other man’s lips. “I liked it.....I would like to do it again.”
One of those hands started to move, caressing Sherlock’s back along the way. The familiar touch continued up his chest, where surely the rapid beating of his heart could be felt. The calloused fingers fluttered over his long neck, making Sherlock’s eyelids shutter briefly. The touch was an almost forgotten feeling and the detective could barely keep himself upright. He then felt John’s thumb reach his bottom lip, where his mouth was now panting. Sherlock’s eyes then closed in earnest in recognition of the reference to their first kiss. He had felt overwhelmed the first time round, but that was nothing compared to the feelings coursing through him now.
“Sherlock what are you doing with my dog tags?” he asked quite politely, considering the frustration he was feeling. Yet when Sherlock locked shocked eyes at him, his frustration turned into a different feeling altogether.
Sherlock closed his eyes in resignation – how could he forget? John had been talking about him, about them. He finally turned round with their tea and joined his son at the table. “Well one of us has to.” He pointed out.
John had kept on glancing over at Sherlock, that look of concern growing as the day wore on. He couldn’t bear it.
The bomb.
John’s train of thought stuttered, as the words filtered through to his brain. To be honest the train crashed and burned. His heart started to break, he could feel the parts of it falling into the pit of his stomach. He finally found his voice, “You and she then...you er...like her?”
He took a deep breath and opened his eyes to look at John once more. He swept his curls out of his eyes and tugged on the lapels of his coat. If he was going to meet his husband for the first time, he wanted to look the best he could. “You guess correctly.” He confirmed “What’s the last thing you remember?”
“The bags under your eyes indicate lack of sleep, but your cheery disposition indicates this is a good thing.”
John knew he should already know that and much more besides.
The answer was quick and breathy “Yes”
“You know you said that to me once.”
“Well I thought so too for a while.” John frowned at this, but Sherlock’s feelings were all coming out now and starting to take over him. All he could focus on was the hot, white rage that was suddenly making itself known. “But have you though or are you just looking for a good shag and a cosy home?”
Then the inconceivable had happened....Moriarty had died.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, as if he couldn’t believe he had won. He edged closer, placing the tags over the shorter man’s head. John felt the weight of them reach his skin; Sherlock fingering the cold metal, as he released himself from them. The soldier grabbed said hand and pulled the taller man towards him. Their lips found each other’s, in a bruising kiss, their passion taking over.
This chapter is from John's POV in the present day. No warnings for this one, but let me know if there is anything that should be highlighted.
“You know I can’t, when it comes to emotions.... especially yours.”
Once he got to John’s room, he didn’t think, he didn’t breathe – he had one thing on his mind – getting to his husband.
He pulled John to him in a strong embrace. “I won’t, I promise.” He kissed his forehead. “I promise.”
Lestrade looked shocked, wide eyed and face aghast “Right....err....ok” he turned and reached for the door handle. He paused and turned back to face Sherlock, pointing a finger in his direction “Oh and you know full well it’s Greg, you floppy haired git.” With this he stormed out and Sherlock half smiled.
That had startled him awake.
His phone pinged with a text message that broke him out of his thoughts. He pulled it out from his dressing gown pocket and John sat up, so they could both see the screen.
“Dad” was all Finn said before clutching on to his Dad’s distinctive Belstaff.
“Ah, ok” The doctor was aware of his husband’s drug history. “How did we get from you being in the custody of social services? 221B doesn’t seem like the safest environment for a child.”
Now all he had to figure out was how he was going to ask him and how he would ever get him to agree.
“It’s home” Sherlock offered.
“A very influential dominatrix.” Sherlock intoned nonchalantly.
“I seduced you with danger from the very beginning John that has been the core of courtship.” He pressed a quick kiss to John’s lips and moved his hands to the blond wisps of hair. The emotion of what he was about to say getting to him. “Finally I did what I was told you should do if you love someone.....I let you go.” John’s own hands found the detective’s neck, bringing their foreheads together. “I pushed you away and jumped off a roof.”
“So good to see you two getting on again, things had been so quiet upstairs!” John hid his smile, as Sherlock turned red at this comment. “Have you remembered dear?”
He must have been sat in his own little world for a while, as he has broken out of his reverie by a hand on his shoulder and a kiss on his forehead.
Ah “Yes right of course.” He kissed John firmly on the mouth “I’ll be right back.”
“It’s ok Dad I have the internet.” Of course he does, so much for trying to protect him from the bad stuff. “That must have been hard for you.”
If John wasn’t scared of losing his best friend all over again.
Sherlock smiled sadly and held on tighter. “Don’t let your Uncle Mycroft hear you saying that, he would have a heart attack.”
He could vaguely hear Lestrade shouting his name urgently behind him, but he paid him no attention. He had finally reached his destination.
Sherlock blinked and brought himself out of his destructive line of thought. He looked over at the other men and their expectant faces. Finn still had tears in his eyes. His little boy had both his parents back and he wanted to embrace that, embrace them. John looked impatient, but happy, and seemed just as wanting for his presence. If he said that it wasn’t important right now then it wasn’t. “Right yes of course” he verbalised, before enveloping the two most important people in his life in a hug. He pressed a kiss to each of their foreheads, being the tallest of the bunch.
----------
“Well that’s because I’m married.”
He burst through the door without warning and saw said husband sat up in the bed, his blue eyes startled by his entrance.
The plot.
Now he was lying in his old room at Baker Street, waking up from the eventful night before, where he had forgiven Sherlock Holmes for not being dead.
“Wonderful” the doctor retorted. He finished off the tea and brought it through to their respective chairs, before he took a seat.
“You’re still here?” he asked unkindly. His voice was a whisper, so as not to disturb Finn.
“You volunteer at the youth centre.” John reminded him
Greg laughed “I doubt it somehow.” John blushed and looked down into his pint. Lestrade raised his own pint and said “Congratulations – Sherlock is a lucky man.”
“Lover’s?” Sherlock questioned.
Sherlock had had his fair few nightmares about that, but “Not this time” he confirmed. He moved over through to the living room and motioned John to sit in his own chair (the doctor had not made that mistake again). “No this dream was a memory from my time when I was dead.” In the weeks that John had been at Baker Street, most of the big moments of their lives had been regaled to him by himself and Finn mostly. Him faking his death had been a bit difficult for John to comprehend to say the least, which wasn’t a shock as it hadn’t exactly gone down well the first time. He picked up his violin and stood by the rain splattered window. “I was sleeping rough and there had been this almighty storm. I was caught out in it and found this abandoned barn for shelter. Its structure was questionable, but it was better than being out in the storm. I got inside and wedged myself in the corner. I was so cold and it felt like I would never be warm again, never escape the storm.” He looked at John, who was listening attentively. “I thought of you and how I wanted you there with me.”
Sherlock was gaping like a fish. Finn turned and put his head in his hands, some of the fury draining from his body.
“Of course I was at the hospital John – I came to tell you about the case, to see you – I don’t know share my day with you, as you were sooo busy working and couldn’t possibly spend time with your husband.”
How does one start a conversation with someone who had been dead for a year? Who you had just physically attacked? Who you had just had a mental breakdown in front of?
“Deadly” John snapped viciously. Sherlock’s face must have paled, because John closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, the anger draining from his body. “I need time Sherlock...I’m not like you, my body isn’t merely transport and I’m ruled by my emotions, I can’t just go back to ‘normal’” There were those air quotes again.
“Tired. I think.” John frowned and felt behind his ear.
John’s eyes widen as he realizes that it’s possible that that is the most pleasurable touch he’s ever felt. His heart suddenly aches for the other man. He’s so brilliant yet so utterly…innocent in some ways.
“Hmmm, careful what you wish for. After all of my years, I can be rather….creative.” He ran his hands up to pinch a nipple before he turned the shower off. “Come, I want to take you to our bed and start my plans to ravish every inch of you.”
“Wait! Wait wait wait. What is this?” John ask, pulling away from him. “Two hours ago I was volunteering to raise money for St. Bart’s, and –“
Stranger: Sherlock moaned, "Naughty boy." He said, reaching over to grab the lube. "In that case, John Watson, I'n going to fuck you so hard and you're going to take every inch and love it." He commanded, pressing his now lubed cock inside him.
You: Sherlock grasped Greg's arms. How had his arousal risen so quickly? "I believe we should do something about our mutual...problem."
Half way through the kiss, John pushed Sherlock up and off of him. He quickly straddled Sherlock’s slim waist and pinned his hands above his head.
Greg moaned and buttoned up his coat. His long coat.
Stranger: "More?" Sherlock smiled and added another finger, both beginning to scissor themselves and move deeper into John, tickling his prostate.
Mycroft knelt in front of him and untied his shoes, helping Greg out of his shoes and socks. Then he reached up and slowly unzipped Greg’s trousers. “Commando? My dear husband, how shocking.”
This crush is getting ridiculous, I need to let this go and focus on figuring out this whole double life thing.
Martin frowned, growing gloomier by the moment. It seemed he really was talking to himself. With a sigh, he leaned back against one of the walls as the scene came to somewhat of a conclusion. For a while, Martin let himself zone out, saying the lines as he had on the show and following Sherlock’s instructions.
“Look, you don’t have to listen to me, but I’ve known Sherlock Holmes far longer than you and I’m just trying to help you here,” shot back Sally. Before Martin could reply, from around the corner Lestrade called “Donovan” and without as much as a “Goodbye” Sally was off.
So on one tab, I have the script for "A Study in Pink" written up and the stupid amount of research I've had to do for this fic for actor's names, Martin's life, and shooting locations is ridiculous, but I don't care. I have worked in the film industry so luckily I have a bit of background on that going into this. Also I'm used to writing slow burn fics, so 5 chapters is feeling a bit daunting right now because my most popular Dan and Phil fic is mounting on 15 chapters now and the characters haven't even admitted their feelings for each other yet.
“What?” asked Martin, fidgeting under the intense stare of the detective.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” he asked. Martin suppressed a frustrated groan.
“Okay, I’m coming… Hello, sir, my name is Dr. Alfred Melrose and I’m here to inform you that you’ve just woken up from a coma.”
He and Ben talked about this in length. Both agreed, particularly during season 1, that what happened between John and Sherlock truly was a love story. Maybe it wasn’t a sexual love story, but there was a coming together of two inevitable forces nonetheless, and they brought out the best in each other. Martin remembered this moment, in filming, and Ben said something along the lines of “This when he gets the first inkling that he’s into you. Everything before this moment John was a regular person, but now he’s something special because he’s the first one to see Sherlock the way he wants to be seen.”
During his side quest to retrieve the gun from his former apartment, Martin’s phone rung from an unknown number several times before lighting up with texts from Sherlock. Martin knew eventually Mycroft would get to him, but figured he could maybe put off the conversation one more day. It was only written in the script this early on to introduce Mark’s character and build the tension anyway.
“Coffee! Thank you, Molly. What happened to the lipstick?” chanted Sherlock, taking the cup from her hands. Still, unlike the actual scene he was far less distracted by his work and more interested in the man before him. As he spoke, his eyes never left Martin’s face.
“Did the blokes on set put you up to this? Did I hit my head off an overhead light or something? This really won’t make for good press, mind you, and I’m not afraid to blast it on social media,” threatened Martin.
They were off script again. Upon entering the apartment, Sherlock asked for John’s phone, then explained the suitcase right on cue, but instead of hopping into the next part of their journey and moving the story along, Sherlock paused and watched Martin from across the room.
John. It was sort of like those moments he and Ben got really into a scene, the kind the Martin lived for where he just got lost in the character, lost in that other world, when everything flowed and jived so well the cameras all but melted away and he
John Watson,” said Martin. Ella wrote a note on her clipboard and in a way that was very unpolite, very Martin, not Watson, he rolled his eyes and scoffed “And don’t you bloody write ‘multiple personalities disorder’ or I will scream.”
“But doesn’t this world have just as much detail? Come on, John, you’ve told me so much about your military experience. Your family. Your life growing up.”
Now in the show, Sherlock’s deductions included a lot of music and catchy close ups, editing that was both interesting while also a little cheesy. Martin had been on both sides of the screen, however, so he knew what it was like to stand in odd silence as Ben watched him with a concentrated look on his face. Usually the cameramen, at this point, would get uncomfortably close to both of them, using giant lenses to film Martin’s shirt sleeve, Ben’s eyes, the like, and they were some of the most boring scenes to shoot because typically they just stood there for up to an hour just making faces at each other. In between shots, Ben and Martin usually had a good laugh. Just remembering it made something inside Martin’s chest hurt because the man standing before him clearly wasn’t Ben, and it made Martin miss him all the more.
Sherlock sighs against his hands. “If I’m to understand why we were targeted or why Eurus went to these extraordinary lengths, I’ll need information. Mycroft’s comments imply he clearly knows more than he’s letting on, which gives us a lead, even if that lead does happen to be my insufferable brother. And now that we’ve got a lead, the only logical course of action is to follow it through. That is what we’d do in any other situation, and that is what I intend to do now.”
Oh, most certainly. You have answers of your own concerning Eurus. I know you have. The east wind, the force that purges the unworthy—did you think you were being clever?
“Still en route?” he asks.
“Talk about
And Sherlock knows John has the right to blame him for that. In a roundabout way, he’s sort of responsible for the entire lot. If Sherlock hadn’t died, John wouldn’t have been forced to find a full-time position or a new flat. That would have prevented Mary from entering the picture, which would have then rendered Rosamund Watson a figure of the imagination, resulting in no close ties to John and therefore no close ties to Sherlock. With both connections never manufactured, Mary’s death would have been stopped.
John never went home.
Rosie does not appear entirely convinced. She continues to wail, her face crumpled with displeasure and reddened by the effort. One of her small hands has curled into his suit jacket whilst the other becomes a frustrated fist by her chubby cheek, and Sherlock hefts her further up in the crook of his arm so that he might engage her face to face. Her brilliant blue eyes (John’s blue eyes) brim with tears, and a tight pang makes its presence known by Sherlock’s lungs.
“The sooner we can start planning,” says Sherlock, gazing up at the too-white ceiling, “the better off we’ll be.”
“Right, and you said, ‘It’s not torture, it’s vivisection.’”
So he watches and he waits, fingers locked and legs crossed. He watches as John gives Rosie a kiss on her head and then on her nose, and then as he addresses the minder with what Sherlock assumes to be a profuse amount of sincere thanks. She makes a placating gesture with her hands, sympathy contouring her countenance, and says some sort of platitude—“It’s quite all right, Doctor Watson,” he imagines, “I’m just glad everything’s okay”—before gathering up her handbag and heading off into the night. The pair of policemen approach John as well, but only to spare a comment or two before returning to their patrol car.
okay?”
It feels a bit weird, this. Mourning an instrument. That violin has been with him for the better part of ten years, has seen him through countless trials and tribulations after the last one had been lost in the midst of a deep stint into cocaine, and to see it in such a sorry state tugs sharply at his heartstrings.
?” God, his throat is dry. He needs water. Sherlock coughs on reflex, and then an overwhelming pain lances through his sternum, bright and fiery and intense, enough to cloud his vision, and—oh, this is
Sherlock digs his nails into the soft whorl of each thumb and breathes. He breathes and breathes and
“Because—” John’s hand clenches on his thigh and he draws a deep, steadying breath. “Right. Never mind. Forget it. Yeah, I’m okay. Or as okay as I can be after getting tranquillised by a madwoman who disguised herself as my therapist, anyway. Which is only marginally okay, just for the record. What about you? Are you okay?”
That’s it. That’s reality. That’s data. That’s fact.
“I’m remembering the governor,” he says.
Sherlock pauses to glance up at the mirror over the mantel. “What look?”
Molly glances at their respective plates before appraising the display cases. “Um, yeah, actually. Have they got any carrot?”
It should have been me, comes the guilt.
“Going after Mycroft,” he affirms, savouring the movement.
“He did have a bit of toast last time.”
Sherlock reenters the sitting room. Crossing the carpet and rounding the table, he draws the beige curtains at each window. The glow of the late afternoon sun shutters into narrow, golden slants pooling down beneath the sills. With the room shrouded in moderate shadow, Sherlock returns to John’s side and holds the torch over top the note.
Oh, John, he thinks. John Watson, you marvellous,
“No, you’re not. You’re—I
Sherlock grits his teeth, pools his attention into the pressures in his hands, and shoves the comment aside.
“It certainly is when you’re not letting on. Care to share with the rest of us?”
“Maybe,” says Sherlock, but he couldn’t care less.
“Yeah. Yeah, we did. Seems like a bloody miracle, doesn’t it?”
Perhaps that shattering is what John needed. A relief in the pressure. A shift in the earth. A fold in the tectonics. Sherlock may be a master of masks, but John has his own sort of practised stoicism that conceals the
Should circumstances permit, this one moment will be the first of many.
As she talks, adrenaline snaps, electric, through Sherlock’s bloodstream.
And this is how things should always happen, Sherlock thinks. This is how everything ought to be. John should always look this soft, this contented. John should always have those mirthful little turns and lines sculpting his face. John should always use that amused tone where he tries not to laugh and fails, and in a good way. John should always come home (
He wants to ask John if he’s okay (because that’s normal, that’s natural; in the aftermath, that is what they do), but this is a delicate thing and Sherlock already knows the answer. John’s body language is rich in its own unique diction; everything is plain by the look on his face, the incline of his body, the continuous clench-release of his hands. John is not okay and hasn’t been okay since he learnt of Mary’s previous life. John is furious beneath the surface. He is furious, livid, angry,
Fact one: Several months ago, John had a text-based affair with a woman who smiled at him on the bus. It was short-term, done on a whim. Fleeting. Nothing physical. John had been ashamed; his body’s language brooked no room for argument. Texting might have been all it was, but it still picked at John like fingernails scraping over a fresh scab: tender, painful, a constant and reminding blemish.
Because reconciliation is best. It is. He knows it is. As much as the emptiness in him protests, as much as the hamstrung jealousy howls, it is the best course of action for all parties involved.
Fact four: Earlier this afternoon, John’s therapist revealed herself as Eurus Holmes. This very same woman claimed to have been Faith Smith as well as the woman who smiled at John on the bus. Three separate people, three separate personalities—all over the course of several months.
Blearily, Sherlock opens his eyes and takes in his surroundings.
“You’re saying your parents don’t know.”
Sherlock rubs his thumb across his fingers and thinks back to the flat. He remembers the drone that carried the tiny silver DX-707 into the sitting room, Eurus’s haunting voice in accompaniment. He remembers the deafening blast that followed, and then the wreaths of fire that clawed after him and John as they launched themselves through the windows. He can still feel the heat of it sweltering against the back of his neck, shards of glass cocooning his descent.
“Well, she did get the note from Culverton,” says John. “D’you think it could have been orchestrated? The two of them working together?”
He also has an empty, aching void where his wife once stood.
Sherlock nods.
“Right. Of course. I’m sure it’ll fool the next criminal mastermind who wants to off you. Can’t rightly kill you if you do it first.” John cuts off a piece with the side of his fork and eats it. “Though I’d appreciate you letting on if you’re anticipating any more fake deaths in the near future. You know. In case you’d care to spare us a bit of grief.”
“Quite right. Same time next year, then?” Sherlock thumbs the buttercream from the side of his mouth and tries for a smile.
“Processing. Right. Okay.” John clears his throat. “Understandable. That’s—I can’t even imagine, honestly. What it must be like.”
Sherlock breathes, drifts on morphine, and lies.
but all that escapes the bedlam is a low and whispery, “All right.”
Unbidden, he thinks of Victor. He thinks of the childhood friend he could never remember, of the little boy his mind had masked into something that was not a boy at all. He thinks of him down, down at the bottom of a well, damp and dark and with a rising water line that a young child would find far too much to overcome. Small body, smaller lungs, a fraction of an adult’s stamina; if it was not hunger or exposure, it would have been the water.
“And you do know you can stay there.” John levels him with a tentative gaze from across the seat. “You don’t need to go to Mycroft’s or one of your bolt-holes or anything. You’re—you’re welcome to stay.”
“Mm. I’ll take it into consideration. Can’t make any promises. Schedules, you know. Never know when a good death will suit.”
Unshaven, rumpled clothes, cleaned teeth, hair washed but not combed.
“Do give me some credit, John. If Mycroft were to end up in hospital, you would never be implicated.”
Mycroft gives a curt nod as he folds both hands over his stomach.
, and there’s that precordial catch again, deep and sharp in his chest, a needle finding its vein before the screen goes abruptly black.
A familiar swell folds itself inside Sherlock’s chest. “Thank you, John. That’s a very kind offer. You know you don’t have to—”
“Hm. Tea’s better than nothing, I suppose.”
“Mister Holmes, sir,” says the policeman in the driver’s seat, “will you be needing a lift elsewhere?”
The fluttering swell in Sherlock’s chest feels strong enough to displace his ribs.
Not to John, not to Janine, not to anyone else.
A warm swell of affection smoulders in the hollow of Sherlock’s chest as he averts his gaze to the billowing, misty dark. He doesn’t even know how to begin. How does one describe John Hamish Watson? There are countless descriptors.
John heaves a sigh. “You’re going to hold that over my head forever, aren’t you? You know it wasn’t on purpose. I lost my footing! There was a wrinkle in the carpet; my shoe caught the edge when we circled round, and—”
“What are you talking about?” Sherlock sounds far calmer than he feels. “John? What happened?”
A return client, he thinks, studying the parcel’s pale surface. Of all the things he would have expected from such an ominously-lettered disk, Mary becoming a return client had not been one of them. And not simply a return client; a return client with a posthumous case, one in which he holds a deeply personal stake.
In retrospect, that had been the wrong thing to say.
To him.
Faith’s note, he thinks. Faith’s note. Eurus had—
“Yeah, okay, I get that,” says John, raising a placating hand. “I’m not against it, all right? I’d like to know what the bloody hell’s going on as well. But you can’t think he’s going to just
“I… I’m sorry, you know.”
Everything is suddenly cold and it feels like he’s been plunged into a vat of ice water somewhere mid-breath so the chill draws through his nose, down his throat, and bursts straight into his lungs. His entire respiratory system hitches and the way his pulse surges mightily against his inner wrists screams fight-or-flight, a response that should never exist within the context of him and John alone together in any sitting room, and yet here it is in all its horrendous glory with its rabbit-swift heart and hormone deluge that inundates every possible cell, cross-linked scar tissues and all.
A tense moment crawls by. Traffic’s undertones and Rosie’s unintelligible chatter and Sherlock’s still tapping fingers swell to flood in the conversation’s missing spaces.
Something starts to take shape, nebulous and hazy at the edges. Sherlock stands perfectly still as the image gains sharpness, definition. In his mind’s eye, a panicked Mycroft charges down a darkened corridor, terror spurring him from the clutches of a shadowy pursuer—the therapist, perhaps, or someone different altogether.
? Jesus Christ. That’s—” John pauses, seeming lost for words. “Right. Okay. And Eurus just, you know, had this three million quid violin lying about. What for?”
Halting the routine mid-hum, Sherlock pivots on the ball of his foot to see John leaning against the sitting room’s threshold.
“Well?” John’s brow arches with expectance, with interest. “Are you going to just stand there or are you going to tell me about what’s going on in that mad brain of yours?”
, and he cannot seem to make it stop.
. Whilst Mycroft hiding things doesn’t come as any great surprise, it has now become apparent that he’s been hiding the existence of another family member for what I can only assume must have been my entire life or at the very least something incredibly close to it, so I would be most appreciative if you’d refrain from making further comparisons.”
“Missus Hudson won’t even be awake. And you are not going to wake her up at”—John leans to the side, peering past the driver’s seat to the neon numbers displayed on the centre console—“three o’clock in the bloody morning so you can have a kip on her sofa. She’s already had the flat above her explode. Let’s wait a bit before giving her another heart attack, hm?”
Sherlock pauses upon the threshold. A dim bedside lamp illuminates everything within, revealing that John all but permeates the room.
“Did you? Well, if you’re snubbing free rides, you’re paying the fare. Just because you like being all dramatic doesn’t mean I like paying each time you whirl out of the car.” John pauses, ostensibly to level him with some disapproving stare. “Seriously. I mean that, Sherlock. I’ve been stuck with the last three. Would be nice if you got one every now and again.”
It wouldn’t be so bad, he thinks. Staying here.
“Indeed. Torture, vivisection, nightmare fuel, difficult, hell. It’s all correct to some degree. At this point it’s just arguing semantics.” Sherlock focusses on the pressure of his thumb sliding against his forefinger and tries not to imagine John at the bottom of a rapidly filling well with chains clasped round his legs. “Regardless, I’ll be fine. Even if nightmares do happen tonight, they’re only nightmares. The real one has already passed.”
Because this is how things ought to be, he thinks. This is how everything ought to feel, how it ought to remain: John, here, exasperated yet amused, standing in the very place he most belongs. Baker Street may be in a right state and the unsettling events of the past few days may linger, but this small moment makes the lot of it feel miles and miles away. It makes the apprehension and disquiet bearable. It makes this cluttered, decimated wreck of a space feel like home.
“Of course it is. Haven’t you ever tried to carry a harpoon in a packed Tube carriage? People give you the strangest looks.”
lengthy detox.
“Pretty damn smart, then,” says John, countenance bright and pleased.
“He definitely tried,” says Sherlock. “Apparently things like this require more than twelve hours’ notice. Exact wallpaper matches take time to find when the manufacturer’s been out of business for ten years, not to mention replacements for custom upholstery.”
Sherlock knows he prefers a clean-shaven face, which puts John’s last visit to his flat sometime yesterday. Late morning, most likely. However, that does not quite explain both the facial hair and his presence here.
“Undoubtedly,” he says. “One of the more popular flavours. Cream cheese filling. Though if you’d prefer something a little more adventurous, they’ve got a ginger spice cake that sells quite well.”
“Mm, and with increasing frequence.”
“Do keep in mind that this is a bit unorthodox,” says Sherlock. “Normally there would be proper music for this sort of dance, but I can’t play one-handed and Missus Hudson has deliberately misplaced my phone dock ever since the opera incident, so we’ll have to make do. All right? Very good. Right, then. Hold tight. Yes, like that. Here we go.”
He watches John press his cheek into the blond of Mary’s hair, blood-tinged hand framing her face, and finds his throat so tight he can barely swallow. He aches to kneel with them both; he wants to enfold John in his arms and tell him he’s sorry, this is not how it should have been, he’s sorry, he doesn’t know what to do, he’s sorry, he never meant for this, he’s sorry, this is not how this encounter was supposed to go—
“Might be, yeah. Do you—” John hesitates, as if carefully considering his words. “Do you want to talk about it?”
White ceiling, white sheets, heart monitor, IV. Half-shuttered blinds block out the sun’s glare through the room’s expansive windows and a generous chill from the air conditioning breezes across his face. A pleasurable fuzziness ameliorates the edges of the blade punctured through his ribs; it lets his muddled thoughts drift and coast, light yet sluggish and with resistance, as if they were somehow wading through a body of water.
Hotel.
Now, nearly an hour later, he sits by the hearth with his laptop resting over his tangled legs, watching Mary’s dot on-screen as it continues to blip across North Africa. Rosie sits in her booster across from him in John’s armchair, her rattle and stuffed animals arced before her like an offering to the gods, and he glances up every minute or so to ensure she hasn’t somehow escaped her compact plastic chair-prison (because she is John’s daughter, after all). When he does, the sight of her in her tiny yellow jumper makes him feel like something down below his clavicle has become tight, waterlogged, encumbered with something he would rather not inspect.
. He has already murdered Charles Magnussen and now he is about to murder Mycroft Holmes. What next? Who else will follow? Doctor John Watson always follows; the proof is here, now, in the tense of a jaw and the clench of a fist. If he chooses this path, makes this irrevocable decision, will John still die in this hellish place?)
And yet none of them did. None of them did, not a one, and he is beyond grateful. He even doesn’t know if he can express just how deeply that gratitude runs. How does one excavate a seemingly endless font of thanks for the continued existence of the single fixed point in one’s life?
If deep waters ever come for him during the night, Sherlock doesn’t recall.
Mary smiles at the camera, smiles at him, smiles at
No, here must first be reassembled. His domain has been upended in more sense than one, and now it must be put to rights. Only then can he allow himself to dwell.
“She knows how people work. And not only does she know how people work, she knows how
John halts, the edges of his voice creaking, hoarse, and he brings a blanched fist against his mouth to stifle it down.
right here, you know,” says Sherlock, staring pointedly at his cake and not at John or his mouth. “Are these inane reports really necessary?”
“For us, yes. Not so much for the others.”
“No, no. It’s fine. It’s—” John clears his throat and rests his forearm across his eyes as if to hide. “Sorry. It’s fine. It’s just… difficult. It’s difficult to talk about this. You went through vivisection and I went through hell. God only knows how Mycroft’s dealing with it.”
Molly sits down beside him with her carrot cake, sporting a timid yet genuine smile. “So, how are you, then? All right?”
Several minutes pass before the lights of London start to skip through the darkness. They wink beyond the car windows in the far distance, soon unfurling into a xanthous patina over the approaching cityscape. The murmur of the engine and the faint susurrus of the police radio provide a comfortable, familiar quiet. The officers in front exchange words amongst themselves, but nothing more.
“Sherlock, she—”
Sherlock brings his left hand into the front fold of his coat. His fingers brush the placket of his shirt, whispering up his sternum to the small bisected crater notched between his ribs. He presses there, gently, memories eddying amidst the friction.
“You made a vow,” John breathes. His eyes have pinned Sherlock to the spot. They strip, flay, vivisect. “You
“You could say that, yeah. Though I’m sure it was more at the fact that someone tried to blow up the flat than at you.”
John’s countenance turns sharp. “You okay?”
“Out of all the horrible and terrifying things that happened there,” says John, his voice harshly quiet, “I think that’s what terrified me the most.”
With a flush warming his cheeks, Sherlock glances back down to Rosie. He lets go of her tiny hand and catches her curious gaze as he performs a little half-bow with her in tow. Her babble of glee during the movement does not go unnoticed.
“Between the rush service and the tidying and additional expenses all for a thorough remodel?” Sherlock offers a smile. “Most certainly.”
Sherlock steps over with a clot of dread settling lopsided in his chest. Even at a glance, he already knows the instrument is beyond repair. One of the strings seems to have persevered out of sheer bloody-mindedness, but the violin’s wooden body has been splintered and warped, the sides and top graced with long cracks that would split further under pressure. The bow, placed just at its side, doesn’t fare any better; the stick has snapped, the hair blackened and frayed.
“Yeah, apparently you have. She said her name is Eurus. It’s—”
John crosses the sitting room once more with the remote in hand. He sits down on the furthermost side of the sofa, letting his elbows come to rest on his parted knees, and there is an anxious sort of heaviness there, thinks Sherlock; it clutches at his shoulders, his hands, evident in his gentle slouch and in the short exhale rushed from his lungs.
He then approaches the slanted table amidst the sea of debris, two of its legs thoroughly displaced and now treading waters unknown. The upturned armchairs and barren bookshelves splay before him in an ersatz portrait of the scene that once was, and as he combs it over, he catches a familiar sight peering out from amongst the mess.
“Yeah. Yeah, I suppose it has. Thank God.” Relief limns John’s voice, soft and palpable, and it eases the tension coiled in Sherlock’s chest.
been worse,” he amends. “I think Missus Hudson would prefer all this to the drugs.”
It should have been me, comes the thought. It should have been me. It should have been me. It should have been me.
An arched eyebrow.
he looks with his silver-tinged blond hair combed in its now-habitual sweep and his strong arms crossed over the navy-chequered fabric of his button-down that complements the deep, hazel-flecked blues of his eyes.
Sherlock shrugs. “We were both fooled twice. I think Mycroft is long overdue for a little sibling trickery, don’t you?”
“I don’t know. For show, I think. Maybe boredom. Proof she could get anything she wanted. But she had me play it. She gave it to me, put it through the cell’s item transfer. Said it was a gift.” He taps out a short message to Mycroft. “Of course, that was before I realised there wasn’t any glass separating us. She knocked me out not long after. I don’t know what happened to the Strad.”
Sherlock is in the middle of letting another armful join the growing collection when he hears John calling him from down the corridor. He claps his hands free of dust and returns the way he came, stepping lightly round the kitchen mess before reentering the sitting room.
Sherlock takes pause in the centre of the sitting room, eyes trained on the white packaging fixed upon the mantel by the gleam of a knife. The vault that houses his heart seems smaller somehow, as if all of him had decided to tumble inward without his consent, folding together like an origami crane until there was no space left for the tremulous beat wedged between the corners and the angles.
A moment of silence encases the sitting room. Sherlock continues composing his message to his pair of chosen Irregulars, outlining the timeframes, costumes, and other miscellaneous requirements. His throat is a bit tight and his chest constricts with a sharp curl of discomfort, but that’s the waiting game. He’s waiting for the inevitable, waiting for John, because Sherlock
Sherlock ignores the question and instead glances down at the gauze set along the bottom of his ribcage. The tape is fresh, he notes. No longer peeling from sweat or exertion. No red or pink in the material, either; no massive bleeding. The dressing must have been changed at some point between his collapse at Baker Street and his admission here. He doesn’t remember pulling any stitches in the midst of things, but that means very little. The morphine had run out far sooner than he’d anticipated, which meant enduring a great deal more than he’d been equipped to manage.
“Yeah,” says John. “Yeah, the texting.”
And that’s a rather pointless restriction, really, now that it crosses his mind, because Eurus already knows. It is sort of obvious, isn’t it? Eurus already knows just like Mycroft already knows; this forced and insuperable choice is less of that knowledge’s statement and more of a continuous undertow that courses through the situation’s every little detail: Sherlock Holmes cares, Sherlock Holmes has a heart, Sherlock Holmes is
John stares back, tension cording his shoulders. Despite the discomfort of the past several hours, he still looks every bit the stoic soldier: stern countenance, solid posture, straightened spine. This is the man who has been to war, who has tasted blood, who has seen horrors. This is the man who has protected others by placing himself in harm’s way. This is the man who once killed a murderous cabbie for a person he had known for barely forty-eight hours.
, the name that injected itself into Sherlock’s life for the better part of five years, the name that promised to set the husk of his heart acinder, the name that slung its way round his neck even in the wake of its bearer’s demise and dragged him to Death’s daring precipice more times than he would care to count.
“No, never mind that. Why are you
.” Sherlock presses his hands together, fingertips tapping, manic energy flowing right down to the soles of his feet. “He would hide away a sister and keep me in the dark, but
You: John bent one leg and pushed his hard cock up against Sherlock's
John took several deep breaths, steadying himself as he had done numerous times in Afghanistan. He wished he could see what was happening. He imagined Sherlock crouched on the wall over the door, impatiently waiting for the human team to get into place.
“You ok, mate?” Greg asked, leaning casually against the wall outside of 221B where John was also leaning, arms crossed, frowning.
Greg’s mouth dropped open. Of all of the things he was expecting, this wasn’t it. “A father? Like with a kid?”
“You’re bidding on John?” Sherlock asks, looking sharply at his brother.
John awoke to the soft sounds of a violin.
“So responsive,” Sherlock muttered into John’s neck as he set a moderate rhythm of fisting John’s cock.
“Thank you John. But I think I’m going to rest. You should rest, too. You’ve just lost blood. Sit down before you fall and injure yourself.”
“Sir, good to meet you.”
You: Mycroft closed his eyes. He was going to have to increase surveillance again on Greg's team. Sometimes he wanted to grab Greg's shoulders and shake him. He brought Greg's palm to his lips and kissed it. "You make me want to tie you to our bed and not let you go."
You: Mycroft shifted on his seat and his hand stopped moving on Greg's chest. "You don't normally wear it?" he asked through clenched teach. "Gregory..."
He would never, afterwards, be able to say why he did it. Or maybe he would say that he was following his instincts. John stood up quietly and slipped off his jumper, and then his button down shirt, leaving him in just his t shirt. Sherlock looked up at him as he approached. The vampire leaned back and quirked one eyebrow.
Sherlock hummed in response. “Anything else?”
Greg frowned. “Ok…”
“Thinking. You’re over thinking this. Us. Everything.”
Sherlock keened. He knew logically that his body adapted easily to accommodate his mate’s knot, but it hurt. And it felt good. Unbelievably good. His fingers twisted in the sheets as John began to pound into him roughly. Every smack of skin, every brush against his prostate. Sherlock welcomed all of it.
After a few minutes, Mycroft pulled out. His face flushed now as his body warmed with Greg’s fresh, vital blood. He knelt again between Greg’s legs and licked once up the length of his bound cock. Greg shuddered.
Beneath Sherlock, John began to push his arse back, trying to impale himself on Sherlock’s cock with each thrust. He was blown over by the feeling of sheer strength and power that he felt from every point of connection between their bodies: Sherlock’s hips on the back of his thighs, Sherlock’s hands grasping his hips and fingers digging into his skin, and Sherlock’s cock forcing its way in and out of his body.
In response, John pushes back against the older Holmes brother and clamps down. That’s all it takes. Mycroft cries out and cums hard, shuddering in John’s willing body. The sights of this sets Sherlock off. He pushes into John’s mouth hard and cums, shooting down his throat.
Lestrade snorted. “Yeah. Do you ever talk to him about that kind of stuff? Does he know that he hurts people with his…choice of words?”
Greg paused and eyed him. The vampire was leaning on an arm and he looked calmer than at the beginning of the conversation. “Feeling less tense, love?”
“Lo fa, Alessandro. Rilasciare lui subito.”
“You’re hurt!” John exclaimed.
John closes his eyes. He’s overwhelmed by sensation, by the feeling of being stretched and filled and used and taken and claimed and as he glances up at Sherlock’s face, he realizes cherished, too.
“Mmm, but you love it.”
Stranger: In one slow movement, Sherlock was pushed in all the way with a soft groan. "John...." He sighed. "You feel so good."
“Keep going,” John murmurs, ignoring the neediness that has seeped into his voice.
“Uh, right. Simul sanguis. Greg said that it’s not the usual mark vampires give humans under contract.”
Stranger: Greg hummed contently against Mycroft's hand, "A bit, yeah. Nastiest headache I've ever had and I've taken quite a few hits in my day." He nestled down closer into Mycroft, feeling incredibly tired all of a sudden.
Sherlock stares at him intensely. For a moment John thinks that his flatmate is about to insult his intelligence. “It seems I didn’t make myself clear. Would you....would you like me to help you with that?” His eyes lower to the still mostly-present bulge visible under the blanket. At this mention, John’s cock perks up in interest.
Mycroft smiles. “But of course. We wouldn’t hurt our prize.”
"Cosa pensi di fare, Alessandro?”
“Ah, yes, that sounds like a good plan.” John stood up. “Right,” he said decidedly, brushing the back of his hand against Sherlock’s cheek as he passed by on his way to the bathroom.
“He had a knife. It’s not bad. Barely worth worrying about for one of my kind.”
The crowd laughs again and the girl has the decency to blush.
“Home? Then where are we now?”
Sherlock dropped his wrist and was suddenly back at the microscope. “You should speak with DI Lestrade. I’m sure he has some…interesting insights to impart.”
“Thanks.”
“Need me how?”
“What? Like reading minds?”
“I need to
“Fight me,” Sherlock finished with a grin. In a blink he flipped them over so that he was pinning John to the bed with his hands, hips pressing down into him. “Do you want to fight me, John?” he asked in a whisper, lips barely touching John’s.
Stranger: "Yes, yes. I am well aware." Sherlock calls from his bedroom, coming out ina pair of boxers. "Better?"
John snorted. “No it’s alright. I’ve got to come to grips with it sometime, right? Bollocks, I was so close. A year. Just one more bloody year and the Statute of Limitations would have run out and I’d be free.” John took a long swig of beer.
“You can put the gun away. He won’t be back,” Mycroft said to Greg as he turned to Sherlock. The brothers frowned at each other and Mycroft tapped the tip of his umbrella thoughtfully. “We should get you both back to your flat. My car will take you.”
“Only several times? He must take a lot and store it at a cooler temperature to keep it fresh?”
“Soon, soon,” John crooned as he pushed another finger inside. He didn’t think that Sherlock needed much stretching, but the worry of hurting him managed to make a dent in John’s hormone-addled brain.
Mycroft smiled and silently fondled the wood handle of his umbrella.
John didn’t have the chance to reply. Sherlock lapped up the blood in several long licks, and then his fangs were pushing effortlessly into his neck. John hissed at the still new sensation of being bitten in somewhere that was so much more intimate than his wrist.
Stranger: ((Darn! Thanks, it's been super fun!))
Sherlock nodded. “Of course,” he replied lowly, eyes moving between the two of them. “We will find the other witnesses.”
After a minute, Sherlock pulls off and sits back on his haunches with a self-satisfied look on his face. “Was it enjoyable?” he asks, voice deep.
Greg opened the door with a smile. “Glad you guys could make it!” He stood back and let them in. He was wearing black jeans and a tight blue tshirt, and, Sherlock noted under his breath, was barefoot.
“Ah. Erm. Well, ok,” John manages to say, looking down at where Sherlock’s hand is still on his leg. He can feel the heat and weight of the hand through the blanket.
John looked up and found Sherlock’s eyes focused on his cock.
“You won’t. Really. I’m very careful. And I’ve got one hell of a boyfriend backing me up.”
Greg sighed audibly. “Ok, you two hash out whatever feud you’ve got going.
“I’m afraid, love, that I need to make use of that mouth.” Greg moaned as Mycroft straddled him and pushed his cock into Greg’s mouth. Mycroft hissed. For a man who had once been married to a woman, Greg was astoundingly good at giving head. He slowly pushed his cock in and out, careful not to push in too deeply. He suspected that Greg was too tired for such roughness tonight.
Greg reached for the loofah and Mycroft batted his hands away. “Let me take care of you, love. Let me tend to your every need…though perhaps some sooner than others,” he said with a smile as he ran his hands down Greg’s chest and pointedly avoided touching his half-hard cock on the way down.
“Thanks,” Greg said with a grin. “Well, almost married. There’s still the next bit. And uh, thanks for agreeing to be one of our witnesses.” He ran a hand nervously over the back of his head.
Stranger: Greg's breath hitched in his throat from the sudden invasion of space along with Sherlock's hand on his wrist. "Yeah. Is it working?"
You: John bent one leg and pushed his hard cock up against Sherlock's
Behind him, Sherlock smiled. “Now rest. You’ll need your energy for later.” He pulled John to him and buried his face in the crook of his neck, falling asleep enveloped in the scent of John Watson.
“This is hurting you?” Sherlock asked with a pause.
“Feel like?”
The bathroom door opened and Sherlock looked out, appearing a bit furtive. “John…John there’s been a – a complication. I believe. A mistake. I – ohhhh, you smell good.” Sherlock stepped into the room and licked his lips.
“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” Sherlock murmurs.
Chuckling softly, Sherlock picked John up in his arms as if he were a doll, and carried him quickly down the hall to his bedroom. John was so surprised, he didn’t protest and merely gaped up at Sherlock’s determined face. In the bedroom, Sherlock laid him down on the bed. John leaned back on his elbows and watched Sherlock take off his blazer and carefully hang it in the closet.
“John, if you’re suggesting that I should play housewife for you, you’ve hit your head recently,” Sherlock muttered.
“No...Wow,” John said finally with a soft chuckle.
chair. Sherlock sat working on his laptop, and John hadn’t even realized he was staring at him until the vampire suddenly stopped and turned to him.
John thought about what Greg had said. “So…where does that leave us? Sherlock and I?”
“Not with Lestrade, no.”
Stranger: "You're hard, already?" Sherlock raised a brow in interest. "Naughty boy," he whispered, trailing his hand in between John's legs and lightly stroking one finger up his length.
John licked his lips. He could feel the adrenaline rushing through his body. “Then tell me.”
anyone. He says he’s married to his work and seems to think of flirting as some waste of time. I’ve never seen him take a second glance at anyone, and Molly, the lab tech, nearly throws herself at him.”
The DI looked at his friend, eyebrows raised in silent question.
“There are some very long winded poems on the subject. I’ll find them for you. In fact, there’s a book I’d like to give you to read that goes into the rituals in detail.”
“Deal,” Greg said as his lover helped him off the couch.
“Well,” Greg said grimly, “You’d best get to bed then.”
John opened his mouth to protest that he didn’t wear ties, but he closed it with a snap at a glare from his new master. A maid carried a tray in and placed it on a coffee table in front of Sherlock. He didn’t acknowledge her as he reached for a goblet of blood. He tasted some and smiled, eyes on the mobile screen. John looked away. He knew that vampires could drink like this, but he had heard that it was less than palatable. Like drinking tepid tea.
“My blood. That is half of the reason for adding my own blood. It is temporarily accentuating your natural healing process. It won’t be as fast as my own natural healing abilities, but it will augment it for now.”
“A simul sanguis claim?”
“Of course,” Sherlock replied. He looked at John intently. “I am...pleased you had the chance to witness the bonding, Mycroft and Greg’s wedding. But we do not need to stumble in that direction. For now.”
They both groan. John grasps Sherlock’s hips with strong hands and starts to guide him. Together they set up a brutally face pace, the bed squeaking softly with the rhythm. With his hands busy, John watches from beneath hooded eyes as Sherlock rubs his cock in time.
You: "Yes, I had someone deliver from that Italian place you like. Let's get you settled on the couch, and I'll bring it in." He led the way to the living room.
“Greg told me that every time you feed from me, directly from my body, that it forms a bond. But you never take enough blood, even though you
“Sherlock?”
Stranger: "More?" Sherlock smiled and added another finger, both beginning to scissor themselves and move deeper into John, tickling his prostate.
“Yes.” Sherlock sat back casually, as if discussing the weather. “I feel that…that it is time. I would like to ensure that John carries the protection that my family can provide him, especially considering that we tend to find ourselves in dangerous situations relatively often.”
“Yes, please give it to me.”
John raised his eyebrows. “Really. So he, uh, likes it?”
A minute later:
Greg laughed. He leaned his head back on Mycroft’s shoulder, purposefully making his neck open and inviting.
his legs, letting John see how wet he was.
“John,” Sherlock said as he sat up. “You have few possessions, even fewer that you care about. You’re not close to your sister and you wouldn’t stay with her if you were with her drinking. You have a job at a clinic where you spend your considerable skills and experience on hypochondriacs and over-protective mothers who bring their children in for one sniffle. You’re extremely skilled. You’re a steady shot and good to have at your back in a fight. I offer you companionship and an interesting vocation, not to mention a chance to use those untapped skills and talents that general society finds useless, and frankly, somewhat frightening. You’re bored. You’re – lonely, if I may point out. You can be a help to me, and I can use your talents so much more effectively.”
