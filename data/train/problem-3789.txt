“He’s all yours, Angel. Besides, I have my eye on a Winchester.” She turned to the mirror and started smoothing her hair and touching up her lipstick. She was just rearranging the neckline of her dress to show her breasts off more advantageously when Sam came in the room and stopped in his tracks, staring at her. Cas sighed. Sam would be a much better partner for Rowena than Dean. He was much more graceful and classy, and he had a much deeper appreciation for her magic. Plus, he couldn’t keep his eyes off her. Unfortunately, Rowena never seemed to notice the younger Winchester.
And that is why Dean was digging through Sam’s herb cupboard in the middle of the night. It didn’t take long. The three baggies were sealed in a mason jar in the cupboard along with a million other things. Sam hadn’t even bothered to hide the stuff. He’d even labeled it, with a sticker that read “False Ironwort”
“Well, I better check on the rum,” Mary announced, and everyone dispersed.
Dean closed his eyes.
That made sense. Castiel wiped the cloth gently down Dean’s neck and chest, running it over his shoulders and across his clavicle. He wanted to press his mouth to that bone, to the hollow of his throat, to his nipple, but he shouldn’t. He couldn’t.
“That rum was stronger than I thought,” Cas laughed as he passed her.
“Sam? Dean?” Castiel stood, calling out quietly.
He was not willing to wait for Dean.
“What are you guys doing?’
ironwort.”
He could feel Cas’ gaze on him. He could see it in his mind without even looking back, that intent stare. His hands circled, pushing his ass cheeks apart, dipping between, brushing the back of his balls.
There was a shout from the bed and suddenly the covers flew up and over, covering the shape on the bed. There was no hiding that voice, though.
“I’m sorry!” Sam was truly mortified. He really should know better. “My Mom told me you had the hots for me.”
“Maybe I’m just a bad driver,” Sam said with a wink.
His heart pounding in his chest, he decided to just go for it. He opened the door and stepped through.
Cas came running in, drawn by all the ruckus. “What’s going on?” he asked, before noticing Guy in Dean’s bed.
Dean nodded at his mother approvingly. Sam wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Maybe later she’ll make pork nog.” Dean thought about that for a moment, but it didn’t actually sound that bad. He shrugged, then looked over at Cas, who was wandering around the living room, looking at everything.
Back in the car, Dean started the engine, taking a moment to enjoy the gratifying growl of the Impala, and turned to back out. Cas was looking at his phone.
He passed the dirt road about a mile outside of Canton, and he could see the old barn between the trees. It was worth a look, he figured, pulling over and checking for traffic before pulling a u-turn and heading up the dirt road. He grinned when he drove around the abandoned barn, seeing the Impala tucked away out of sight. Jackpot.
Castiel visited Claire, stayed a while with Jody, drove out to Bobby’s old place. Claire was happy to see him. She said she was going to marry Kaia, and she wanted him to be there. Castiel agreed.
Castiel looked at his son curiously.
Sam wanted to tell him he shouldn’t be sending his information out to random companies, but before he could say anything, Jack burst out gleefully, “I won! I won!”
Back in the map room, he untied the parcel. Inside were three small ziploc bag full of dried leaves. He opened one up and took a sniff, and frowned. It didn’t smell quite right. He’d used ironwort before, but not often. He wondered if it was just stale.
“He told me he doesn’t want to interfere.”
“It’s from Breckenridge Ski Resort. I entered a draw online!”
Dean felt his face heat up and his heart start to race. Maybe he hadn’t missed his chance after all. “Uh, yeah.” He cleared his throat and opened the door to his room. He tilted his head, one eyebrow lifted, a silent question. Cas nodded and walked past him into the room.
“Probably better take that coat off just in case. Wouldn’t want it to get wet anyway.”
“Rowena?” Sam whispered.
If Castiel thought it was difficult running a cloth over Dean’s front while keeping up the pretense that this was some kind of treatment, it was about a thousand times worse from the back. Dean’s muscles gleamed in the low light of the motel room, the dim lamp and the bathroom light casting shadows and giving him a soft glow.
“Yes, thanks,” Cas replied, and grabbed another slice. He hesitated, then grabbed the last one as well. He ate them both quickly, in three big bites, then leaned his elbow on the table and began licking his fingers, his eyes half shut. Dean couldn’t stop watching him, although he wasn’t laughing. Instead, he was just fascinated.
Suddenly, Sam felt a whole lot better, knowing it was Rowena who was coming, instead of some random person they’d never met. As Cas left again to his room, Sam schooled his features back into something resembling indifference. “See,” he told Dean. “Now we’re gonna be stuck with Rowena all weekend.”
His eyes shot open, meeting the blue of Cas’. His pupils dilated as Dean watched, fascinated. Cas had to know, had to realize that Dean was fine, but he was going along with it.
“Okay, fine. I won’t give Cas any more angel-nip without telling him. And I should go apologize. You got the rest of these dishes, right?” he said, tossing the towel to Sam and striding out of the kitchen.
It didn’t come up again for a few weeks, although Dean did notice that Sam had removed the jar of false ironwort from the herb cupboard. Not that it mattered. He still had a bit, and he could always order more.
“He just left. Hey, Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something.”
“Maybe I better take that,” Sam said, taking the bag from Cas.
Maybe if he had something to punch. He wondered for a minute if they had a punching bag down in the gym, but he hardly ever went there. But physical activity might just help. Maybe that’s why Sam went running all the time. Working off the blue balls.
“Who’s it from?” Sam asked as he tried to fit all the salad fixings into the fridge around Dean’s beer.
Rowena gazed at Dean. “It sure does,” she agreed.
Sam opened his mouth to say something, but before he could, Cas returned. “It’s all good,” he said. “Rowena said she’d love to come.”
It didn’t take long. It was only a few, luckily, and they were pretty feral, so Dean didn’t have to feel so bad about ganking them. Cas had gotten one with an angel blade, which, if he was honest, kind of impressed Dean since they were definitely more suited to stabbing than slashing. They threw their shit in the trunk, and Dean gave Cas a slap on the back. “Good job, man,” he said. Cas just nodded, but his lips did quirk up at the corner.
“I don’t need any curing,” she replied back. Dean rolled his eyes.
There was no answer.
Sam walked in just as Dean hung up the phone. “Jody and Jack got away okay?” Cas asked. Sam didn’t reply. Instead he grinned wickedly. “What are you all doing sitting around here? Why aren’t you packing?”
Dean moved away from the car and turned to face Cas in order to try and see better. The wings were long, at least six feet each, and ragged, with burned and bare patches, and spots with obviously missing feathers, but they were definitely real. And unlike in the kitchen, where they were confined by space and tucked away as quickly as they had appeared, this time Cas stretched them out to either side, spreading the damaged feathers out like fingers, before raising them up above his head, the tips reaching nearly twice his height.
Visceral, all right. Dean pictured it, the way Cas made that sound and then looked so… blissed out. Like he’d just…
Dean fully intended to do exactly that, but first he needed to order this herb for Sam. He’d been working on this case for weeks. There was a ghost of a soldier who was somehow travelling from place to place. Sam had been driving all over the country, trying to track it down. But then Rowena had suggested a summoning spell that worked on warriors who died of their wounds. They had most of what they needed in the bunker, but the ironwort would need to be ordered online, if it had a chance to arrive before Sam did.
“Cas?” Dean said, shocked.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Sure, bitch. Whatever. I think I know when a girl is flirting with me.”
He looked up as Cas and Jack walked into the map room. “I thought you were going to the kitchen?” he asked.
“So you have no choice but to stay here until Dean comes?”
It was the ski instructor, leaned up against the doorframe, a grin on his face. Dean blinked. He really looked like Dick Roman when he did that.
“Oh look!” She exclaimed. “There’s deer!”
If Dean had had anything in his mouth, he would have spit it out. He sat up and stared at Cas, who didn’t look up from his phone.
He went slowly, working himself inside carefully as he had done with his fingers earlier, inching into Dean with soft rocking movements until he finally breached the tight ring of muscle and slid home, his hips pressed tightly to Dean’s ass. He withdrew, slowly, almost all the way before sliding in again, his weight braced on his left hand while his right held on tightly to Dean’s hip.
That power was all Jack had to bargain with, though, and soon a deal was struck. In exchange for Castiel’s release, Jack would do what the shadow couldn’t and put the dead angels and demons back to sleep, leaving the Shadow once again in peace.
Rowena looked at Cas for sympathy. “I can’t believe it either. And the second Guy came along, he ran off.” She wiped a tear from her eye and then stomped off to her own room, slamming the door behind her.
“They must have switched.” Sam opened his door. “Good night, Dean.”
The lodge had three rooms on the main floor, and three more upstairs, with a rail looking down into the living room. Cas thought about it for a moment, and then decided to take the one on the left, upstairs. Dean followed him up the stairs, pausing at the doorway. Cas took the bag back and set it on the nightstand. Dean looked into the room and noticed the door leading to the next room over. “What a coincidence! My room is right next door!”
“I need a second finger,” he said, the question unspoken, and when Dean nodded, he pulled out, applying another drizzle of lube before gently pushing two fingers into Dean. He resumed his movements from before, and Dean responded, relaxing his muscles while rocking back into his hand, their actions in no way resembling anything medical.
Cas started with Dean’s boots and Dean started with his flannel, and they met in the middle at Dean’s pants. Dean’s fingers must have still been a little stiff because he fumbled a lot so Cas pushed his hands aside impatiently and undid the buckle of his belt, and then a moment later he was pushing his jeans down so Dean could step out of them.
and wondering if it would make him look the same as that stupid plant did. All breathy and moaning. Dean had even been thinking about it in the shower, as he jerked off, something he’d managed to avoid doing for over a decade. All these years, and he’d kept Cas out of his spank bank, only to be defeated by some weed.
What a fucking couple of assholes.
“It’s fine, Dean. Just ask next time.” He stood up and gave Dean a pat on the shoulder.
“Mary, why is your laptop up so loud?” Ever since she’d figured out how computers worked, she had been obsessed with YouTube, spending most of her free time parked in front of her laptop or her phone, watching everything under the sun from historical documentaries to fashion vloggers, to music videos. She’d even spent a week watching a long haired blond guy eat ancient military rations while somehow avoiding botulism. Cas had to admit, the guy did have a soothing voice.
“You smell better than any ‘angel-nip’, Dean. You’re intoxicating.” He took a deep breath. “I want to know if you smell that way all over. I want to know how you taste.”
The End
“Dean, did you know the aurora borealis should be visible from this geographical region tonight?”
“It didn’t seem to have much of an effect on Jack.”
for granted, forgot to look past the confused head tilt and the frumpy accountant getup. But sometimes, like today, he remembered that Cas was
Dean watched, eyes wide, as Cas ran a finger through the mess on Dean’s belly, and bringing it to his lips, licked it off.
Dean felt the corner of his mouth quirk up. Cas’ eyes crinkled, and a moment later, they were both grinning at each other. He was still a sticky mess, but it felt fucking amazing.
Dean paused outside of Sam’s room, watching Cas and Rowena as they walked up the stairs. Rowena went into the left bedroom, and Cas went into the right one. Dean looked at Sam, confused. “I thought they were in the other rooms?” he asked.
The pretense was flimsy but Dean clung to it as he nodded.
“Sure,” Rowena said, but she didn’t stop gazing at Dean. “I could use a drink,” she said.
Cas was admiring the view out of his window while everyone else got settled in. He was a little bit worried about Dean. He was acting a bit strangely. But then again, he had been that way ever since the thing with Michael. He sighed and pushed the thought out of his head. At least Dean seemed happy.
Mary was tasting the concoction on the stove when Guy came into the kitchen.
Their mouths met again, briefly, sloppily, and his eyes shot to Cas’ when the angel gritted out, “I’m almost...Dean, I can’t, I’m going to…”
His pondering was cut short as Rowena breezed into the room. Cas had grown close to her as a friend, during the last year or so, and he trusted her almost as much as he did Sam and Dean.
“That’s right. Are you gonna come for me, Dean?” His hand tightened on their cocks and that was all it took to push Dean over the edge. His hips rose off the bed and his head lolled back as wave after wave passed over him. He gripped the sheets and then he gripped Cas’ thighs, digging his nails into the muscle, trying to ground himself.
Dean watched, straining to see in the dark, as Cas tapped some of the herb out into the palm of his hand. He shoved the baggie back into his pocket and brought his hand up to his face, and
Dean strode over to the table and picked up the baggie. “So what’s this stuff do?” He opened it and sniffed, then pulled a face, unimpressed. The smell must have reached Cas though, because his eyes widened and his hand flexed by his side. The angel made a small noise in his throat. Dean shrugged and handed the bag to Cas, who immediately buried his nose in the opening.
Except that left him alone in a room with a half-strength angel who looked like he needed glasses, and who was completely oblivious to the fact that he was driving Dean absolutely insane.
“You might have a better angle if you straddled me.”
Jack’s face fell. “I can’t go! I told Jody I would visit this weekend. She’s already on her way here to pick me up.”
Dean looked at Cas’ face, and it only took a second to realize the expression was fear, more than anything. He stepped back, out of reach. “Oh shit, I’m sorry,” he said. He got ready for the next part. The part where he pre-emptively told Cas it was okay if he wanted to leave, because it was easier to blame himself for Cas going than to blame Cas. He looked at the floor, getting ready.
As though Cas could read his thoughts, he spoke. “I can’t exactly explain it. I wish I could give you something similar, but there isn’t anything exactly like that for humans. Most drugs, from what I understand, that would give a similar effect, last much longer, or have addictive or dangerous properties. The only thing I experienced as a human that was similar, was ejaculation.”
Dean licked his lips in anticipation. The movement drew Cas’ eyes to Dean’s mouth, and Dean saw his throat move as he swallowed.
Cas turned his head to look at him. “Hello, Dean,” he replied.
Dean’s head turned towards Cas and his eyes opened, looking into Cas’ very core as they moved together. Without a word, their mouths brushed together, gently, just for a moment, and then they were kissing properly, exploring each other’s mouths with increasing desperation as the pace of their movements increased.
“Side pocket of my bag,” Dean replied. Thank fuck he kept that around for the occasional pay-per-view-and-alone-time opportunity he got on hunts.
Dean whimpered when he removed his hand, and Cas didn’t take his eyes off Dean’s ass as he removed his underwear as fast as angelically possible. “I think there’s a condom in my bag,” Dean gritted out.
“Just do it, please,” Dean answered, and Cas didn’t make him wait any longer before pressing his aching cock into Dean.
“I guess not,” Dean said. He didn’t really want to look at ionizing gasses, or whatever, right now. He kind of just wanted a beer and some chili fries. He glanced at Cas, who was looking at him hopefully. He sighed. “Okay, fine. Where to, sir?”
Dean was on his way from the shower to his room when he ran into Castiel in the hallway.
Castiel could remember those days, inhabiting Jimmy’s corporeal form was more like manipulating a puppet than actually living. Even after Chuck had resurrected him after he’d been exploded, first by Raphael, and then by Lucifer, he had not truly been a part of his body. It was only after he’d become human at Metatron’s hands that he’d fully integrated and
It was about twenty minutes later when Rowena crept from her room and tapped at Sam’s door. She waited, tapped again, and then finally gave up and went back to her room.
Sam turned red. “I was… I was… just getting it for Mom.” He spun on his heel and departed into his own room.
“Yeah, that sounds easy.” Dean let out a shaky breath. “I want. I want to kiss you again. And I want to go to bed with you too and then I don’t want you to be gone when I get up tomorrow. And I want to do that every day.”
It was uncertain, but not as much as the first one. Dean didn’t think Cas was going to bolt, at least. Dean’s hands started off at his sides, but it wasn’t long until he was lifting them, sliding them under Cas’ coat, and hooking his thumbs into Cas’ belt loops.
“Could you go help my Mom with the rest of the drinks?” he asked Guy.
The first thing he did, about a week after Minnesota, was simply to stand up from the chair he was sitting on in the library, and stretch. As soon as Dean looked up from the book he was looking at, Cas lowered his arms and stated to the room in general, that he was tired, and thought he might go to bed. Sam wished him goodnight without really looking up, but Dean was still watching him as he fished around in his pocket for a moment.
Just then, Mary came in, holding a tray of drinks, which she handed out to everyone.
Dean stalled, hanging up his towel and putting his things away. Cas shifted from one foot to the other.
Cas stiffened for a few seconds, and Dean just went on kissing him, mentally bracing him for the blowback. He figured it would be about a sixty/forty chance that Cas would either back up in a panic, or haul off and punch him. He put about a zero percent chance on what actually happened. Which was Cas sighing against his mouth, before squeezing his arm and actually pulling him closer.
“NO! Yikes! God, Rowena!” Dean practically shouted. “I think there’s been some kind of a mixup.”
It wasn’t until he let out a huge moan that Sam realized what was going on. His eyes snapped from Cas to Dean, and when Dean finally couldn’t hold in the laughter any longer, and burst out laughing, Sam snapped.
Dean looked, but he didn’t see anything. Maybe a cloud. He looked at Cas, who was staring at the horizon intently. Then back at the sky again. Hm. Maybe it was bright for a cloud. A kind of soft, yellow wavering light in the sky. It was faint, barely there. Like a ghost that didn’t want to be seen. Without him even noticing the change, it brightened and intensified, although, if he were to be honest, not to the point that it was really worth putting on his bucket list or anything.
Days passed. The dog sat by Castiel sometimes, by Sam others. Eileen visited, left. Visited again. Sam and Castiel sat in the library and talked. Castiel told him about Jack, about Mary and Bobby and everyone in heaven. Told him they were waiting for Dean.
Dean nodded eagerly, so Cas smiled and headed to his room to see what he had that he could bring.
Dean turned too, looking at the horizon again. The aurora had intensified during the last few minutes, and was a definite shimmering glow now, green and yellow, hazy, still and moving somehow at the same time, twisting and curling on itself. Dean felt weird, almost like he’d taken some kind of drug himself that had created this vision. His hands and feet tingled. His stomach seemed to drop into his pelvis, and there was definitely something inappropriate happening in his pants.
Unwilling to step too far down that road, he turned off the tv and then the light, crawling into his own bed. Cas’ phone glowed in the dark.
It had really been just a goal, at first. No solid plan had come to him immediately. And the incident with the aurora borealis hadn’t exactly been a part of that plan. He’d truly done that mostly just to relax. He had had the herb safely in his possession for a while, but he just hadn’t found a good opportunity to use it until then.
“Have you talked to Jack?”
“This is pretty strong,” Sam said, sipping from his mug.
Dean peeked at Cas. He couldn’t stop the soft “yes” that escaped his lips.
All the saliva promptly vanished from Castiel’s mouth.
He said it was like catnip, and he felt good, and it doesn’t hurt him.”
Dean couldn’t help it. A snicker escaped. “I don’t know what to tell you, Sammy,” he said.
Cas closed his eyes and swallowed hard at the sensation of Dean’s tight ass gripping his finger. It felt so good, slick and warm, and he wanted to know desperately how it would feel on other parts of his body. He opened his eyes again and watched as he let his finger slowly slide out of Dean’s ass and back in again, an imitation of fornication that was gratifying, yet left him wanting more.
“You ordered
“Well, maybe I can cheer him up?” She giggled.
“Okay, it’s fine then,” Dean said. He saw Dean slide his hand underneath his hips to fist his dick as Cas slicked himself up and lined himself up to Dean’s hole.
By the time they arrived back in town, Cas was back to his usual self, scrolling through his phone and making comments about whatever he was looking at. The idea of sitting in some brightly lit diner made Dean cringe, so he just went through a drive through and grabbed a meal for himself and just a burger for Cas, then headed directly back to the motel.
“Certainement,” Guy replied, getting gracefully to his feet and heading into the kitchen.
“Oh. The thing. Yeah.” He turned to Rowena. “I’ll catch you later,” he said, and without waiting for a response, he stepped outside.
“Hey, Cas,” he said. Cas was standing outside his door, with Jack. “Hello, Sam,” Cas said. Jack lifted his hand in greeting.
He felt a little awkward as he headed naked to Dean’s room. He hoped Dean wouldn’t mind if he borrowed some clothing. He headed to the dresser first, pulling on a shirt and grabbing some jeans, hesitating for just a moment before grabbing underwear and socks. The pants were a little tight, but they would do for now.
Dean worked on his coat, jacket, and tie, while Cas kicked off his shoes and started on his belt. Then Dean started on Cas’ shirt, unbuttoning it one at a time, all while giving him the same treatment he’d gotten earlier. He kissed his way down Cas, breathing him in, tasting him. He was so familiar. He’d been surrounded by Cas’ scent for years, until it had become a part of his existence. But this was the first time he’d really been able to breathe it in.
He’d been researching the plant, and once he discovered that it had no harmful properties to humans, he came up with his idea.
“Allo,” the stranger said. “I am Guy, your ski instructor.” He had a French accent. Cas liked it. Guy smiled at Cas and looked around the room. Spotting Rowena, he nodded towards her. “Allo,” he greeted her. Rowena slid over and looked him up and down. She held out her hand towards him, and he took it in a friendly handshake. She curled up her nose and extracted her fingers. “I had better take these to the kitchen,” Guy said, indicating the groceries. He picked them up and left the room.
Instead, he leaned on the fireplace mantle and crossed his ankles. He was wearing loose pants and a snug henley that highlighted the muscles he worked so hard at. He looked at Rowena, and Cas decided to try and help his friends out a bit.
He wet the cloth again and went back into the bedroom. Dean was still sprawled on the bed. Their eyes met.
“Anything you like, baby,” Mary replied.
Cas gasped, surprised at the painful thud in his chest he felt at this news. He looked back and forth between them.
It was a good thing Sam and Jack weren’t here. They’d gone to the movies, since Dean had been on edge a lot the last few weeks, and eventually Sam had grown tired of his snippy attitude, making sure to make it very clear that Dean was
Then it happened. With a shuddering moan and a gasping, desperate “
Mary was in the corner, digging through her bags. Finally, she pulled out a couple of bottles of rum and held them up triumphantly. “Wow! I was worried they would be broken, what with Sam’s crazy driving. Guess what, guys! I’m gonna go make hot buttered rum!”
Just then, Mary came in from the kitchen. She paused as she walked by the window.
“Is it ready?” Cas asked.
Dean came into the living room a moment later to find Sam watching Rowena, and Cas just standing there. He was going to go talk to Cas, but then Mary came in and a moment later Dick friggin Roman walked out of the kitchen.
Dean looked heartbroken for a moment, but then he perked up. “Just invite them along!”
But, well, Dean’s temperature was slightly elevated. Although it was within normal parameters. Still. He
He wanted to spread those cheeks, push them apart with his thumbs and bury his face between them, but he wanted to drag it out more, so he slid his hands to the side, running them up Dean’s hips to his waist then back down again, rubbing circles into the tops of his thighs once again.
Astoundingly, Cas continued. “Although, in my experience, that was merely a fleeting physical experience. This was as much cerebral and emotional as it was physical.”
Guy, seeing Cas, winked at him. “I know what you want,” he said. “You should just go for it.”
“You wanna go have a shower with me?” Dean asked.
“Hm, you’re right. She might find me in there.”
“Maybe if we just… said what we really want instead of obfuscating?”
Two more songs played, and Cas occasionally twitched and shivered next to him, or let out the odd soft sound, and the lights in the sky faded.
“Oh this old thing? My ex-husb--” Cas shook his head at her. “I mean… uh… Castiel gave this to me.”
Dean waved vaguely at Cas. “Planning a fun night with your little orgasm weed there, Hotwings?” He cringed a little inside. He hadn’t meant to be quite so blunt.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Cas replied. “He’s not your type. You usually go for the wealthy type, don’t you? Dean doesn’t really have much to offer you in that department.”
Rowena sort of… glided into the room and slid onto the end of his bed, raising one eyebrow at him. “So,” she said, tapping one glossy, lacquered nail on her chin. “Now that he’s not trying to murder me, I am starting to realize how handsome Dean is.”
to the ghost, and while Dean burned the corpse, he had the pleasure of watching Cas stab and smite almost half a dozen snarling beasts.
He passed Sam on his way out of the kitchen.
Dean had had ghost sickness before, and it wasn’t that. But he couldn’t respond.
“Hmmm. Divine,” he said. Dean thought he would die at the sight. He wanted so badly to see his angel come. He needed it.
He smiled, happy for the first time since he’d told Dean he loved him. He hugged Jack, took his face in his hands and kissed his forehead. He asked him to tell everyone goodbye, then Jack took his fingertip and pressed it to Castiel’s forehead.
What the fuck? What a couple of assholes they were. They fought monsters, they fought demons and the devil himself. They were both willing to die - had in fact actually died - for the people they cared about. But when it came time to say some words, like “I like you” or “I would like to stay in the vicinity of you” or “I want to fucking kiss you on the mouth” suddenly it was some kind of insurmountable obstacle.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean said.
Dean let his breath out through his nose, swallowing his groan as Cas slowly eased inside. His finger felt huge, but he moved so slowly there was no burn as he gradually stretched to accommodate it. His other hand still rested on his ass cheek, squeezing gently and rhythmically in time with his finger as he began gently working his finger deeper.
“There,” Cas said, after a few songs had played. “Just at the horizon.”
“I think you better check my temperature again,” Dean said. “Just to be safe.”
Dean wondered how much of that was his own fault.
“Dean?” Cas said.
the palm of his hand, and then his fingers, one by one. Dean was fascinated. Cas wiped his hand off on his coat, then leaned back with his hands on the trunk and looked back at the sky.
“Wait a second…” Sam said, from the doorway. He looked suspiciously at everyone, glaring at them one at a time. “All these attempted hookups. All this sneaking around…. and nobody was looking for me?”
“Just don’t go to any other websites and I won’t need to shoot you when I get back.”
Sam felt bad for Dean. He’d been pining for Cas at least since Purgatory, and Sam had known about it for ages. But Sam was also certain that as an angel, Cas wasn’t capable of those feelings. He loved Cas, but he knew he would break Dean’s heart, and he wasn’t sure Dean would be able to deal with that kind of rejection.
“Unngh.”
“You were confessing your love to me five minutes ago,” Rowena pouted.
Castiel woke up in the dark.
Dean felt his heart pound a little too hard in his chest. “Is it that obvious?” he whispered.
He ran the cloth over his face and tried to cool down, while he attempted to will his body into submission. He should probably stop. But the truth was, Dean usually put a stop to any inappropriate touching long before it got to this point, and Castiel wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to stop before Dean made him. Besides. Dean had to know that he wasn’t truly ill.
“That was just like I pictured you, Dean,” Cas said. “But I still don’t know how you taste.”
“Dean!” the redheaded witch exclaimed happily.
“She’s getting better,” Sam protested.
Sam rubbed his hands over his face. Now he was going to have to order the correct herb and wait for that before he could do the spell.
“Your room?” Guy asked, one eyebrow lifted.
“You’re very warm, still,” Cas said. He removed his finger from Dean’s mouth. “I’d better keep trying to cool you off.”
The higher he got, the slower he went, and he watched, fascinated, as Dean’s ass clenched and released as each stroke brought him incrementally higher. Eventually his fingers brushed the bottom curve of Dean’s ass, and he flinched, groaning out a desperate “please, Cas,” that was the single most incendiary thing the had ever heard in his long, long existence.
Cas was the last one through the door. He had no luggage, although he did have a plastic Gas-n-Sip bag with a book in it. He hadn’t found much to pack, after all. “What a lovely place,” he said, glancing around. He walked over to the window. “What a lovely view!” he exclaimed.
“Yeah, but that’s kind of a visceral reaction to have in front of people, when you’re not expecting it.”
“Maybe, Dean. But right now, I feel like you’re too far away.” He tugged Dean to his feet. “Let’s go to bed,” he said.
Just then, Rowena came barging in from her room, covered in a towel. She stormed up to Sam, her eyes flaring purple. “How dare you walk into a lady’s room without knocking. Don’t you Winchesters have any manners?”
“I don’t know, man. It was like a prank, I guess. Like how Sammy and I sometimes play jokes on each other. It doesn’t last long, or hurt you, so I kind of thought it was harmless. But yeah.” he looked at the floor and rubbed the back of his neck. “I didn’t really see it as like I was drugging you, without permission. Oh, shit, man, I’m so sorry.”
life. He could imagine it now, the look on Dean’s face. He knew he’d be welcomed, he still heard Dean’s prayers, and he knew now in a way he never had before, that his feelings flowed both ways.
Sam kicked the snow off his boots as he strode into the bunker, his arms full of groceries. Spying Jack sitting at the map table on his laptop, he sent the kid back out to grab the rest of the stuff from the car. “Don’t forget the mail on the front seat, Jack!” he shouted as he headed towards the kitchen.
“Okay,” Sam laughed. He went into his room to grab the ironwort.
Cas didn’t argue. Instead, he just kind of rubbed his face where the dried leaves were stuck to him, and then rubbed his fingers together and took a big sniff. “Mmmmgh” he said.
Dean didn’t want Cas sticking his finger in his mouth again, except he also kinda did, and anyway, maybe, if he was honest, he kinda didn’t mind Cas touching him in general, and he didn’t usually have a valid excuse, so maybe it wouldn’t be so so bad just this once if he let Cas give him a very
“Really?” Guy asked. His hand on the back of the couch slid closer to Dean’s neck.
Dean grunted back. “You sure you wanna let me on your computer?”
“Sam, Cas and I have been friends for years, but with Michael gone, and our whole family here, and nothing looming on the horizon, this is an opportunity. Maybe a beautiful, moonlit ski lodge is what I’ve been waiting for. Maybe now it’s finally time?”
“If not, then I am sure we can double up!” Dean said cheerfully.
“Yeah. You’re a little silly,” Dean smiled.
“I don’t want to leave, Dean.”
“Is that... is that okay, Dean?” he asked.
“Don’t say anything. I think I’ve been embarrassed enough for one day.” He opened his door. Dean followed him.
He didn’t do the spell and ritual right away when he got home, since Jack had to tell him all the things he’d been doing while Sam was away, and he needed to have a shower and change, and grab a bite to eat. Then he had to double check that Dean hadn’t done anything completely heinous to his laptop. But once all that was sorted, he headed into the storage room and then the kitchen to collect all the items he needed for his spell. He set it all down on the map table, then went to his room to grab the ironwort.
“My MOM??”
Mary looked at her watch. “The time? It’s quarter after four.”
“I didn’t know. I didn’t think he could… I didn’t know. And now he’s there, and he’s hurting, and there’s nothing I can do.”
Cas was definitely enjoying himself. A few more days passed, and he could see Dean’s tension ratcheting up little by little. He was starting to enjoy this situation for its own sake, watching Dean’s discomfort, the red that stained his cheeks whenever Cas caught his eye, the way Dean jumped when Cas “happened” to brush against him in passing. He almost didn’t want it to end. But he could sense that Dean was pretty much at his breaking point, and knowing Dean, that would end up in some kind of huge argument that could take weeks to resolve. And the last few months had been one of the rare long stretches in their lives where nothing was really
Eight hours on the road, however, left him a little less energetic. He drove past a few motels on his way into town, but he saw no sign of the Impala, so he stopped at a diner to grab a meal. There were newspapers by the front counter, so he took one of those as well, hoping to see a headline that might indicate what the boys had come here to hunt.
Cas approached the bed slowly. It kind of reminded Dean of a panther. It made him feel like he was being stalked. Sometimes he forgot, sometimes he took Cas’
“Huh.” Dean said.
“Better do my chest too, then,” Dean replied.
Rowena hopped to her feet, striding over to Cas and poking him in the chest. “You just want him all to yourself!”
And it was his own fault too.
“So fuckin’ good, Cas,” he replied, and Cas nodded inanely, before thrusting into him again.
He wasn’t sure what he could do about it either, short of starting a fight with Cas. Jerking off certainly didn’t help. He could go to town to see if he could get laid, maybe, but that hadn’t appealed to him in so long he couldn’t even remember how long it had been. At least a year.
“Good night, Sam.” Dean headed up the stairs to the centre room.
Cas’ hands mirrored Dean’s, sliding around his waist to the small of his back, before tugging him closer. The motion caused them to bump together at hip level, and when Cas moaned at the contact, heat flared in Dean’s groin.
Once they left, Dean let out a sigh of relief. Guy set down the fire poker and sat on the other end of the couch, propping one ankle up on his knee and stretching his arm along the back of the couch. He smiled at Dean.
Castiel walked into the library, drawn by the loud sounds of an ad for Raid: Shadow Legends. He knew what he was going to find before he got there.
Dean peered at Cas, blinking, trying to understand. His chest hurt, his head felt worse. This felt like one of those moments in life that everything kind of hinged on, and it was so hard to know what it was that he needed, and then just fucking say it. He was terrified.
Cas stuck his head out of his door.
“No, I-I just made a mistake,” Cas stammered out. “I was looking for Rowena’s room.”
He saw the blood on the floor before he made his way past the last stall, and a quick glance around revealed a beheaded corpse. Vampires then. He paused, listening. There was no noise, no sound of a fight, or voices. Nothing but…
I. R. O.
It sounded like a sob. Castiel crept forward, his knife ready, a sick feeling of dread slowly building in his stomach.
His hand joined Dean’s between them, their fingers twined together.
Unlike himself.
“The ironwort I called you about the other night.”
They gave Dean a hunter’s funeral, but there was nobody there but Sam and Castiel, and a dog that Sam said belonged to Dean.
“What did you do, Dean?”
The kitchen was empty. Cas had no idea how long the brothers had been gone, or when they would be back. He didn’t even know what day it was. But the bread on the counter had gone moldy, so it stood to reason they were on a hunt. A stroll through the library and Sam’s room confirmed that suspicion, as Sam’s laptop was nowhere to be found, and he always left it behind when he was planning to be back that day. A note on Sam’s desk had an address in Akron, Ohio, though, which was at least a lead.
Dean’s eyes widened.
“Aaaanghhhehhaa!” Dean replied, somewhat desperately, not entirely sure what Cas meant to do with that finger. He tried to raise an arm to bat Cas away, but it flopped uselessly at his side. Luckily, Cas just slipped his finger into Dean’s mouth. Dean blinked. Cas held it there for a moment, his head tilted to the side, his eyes scrunched in concentration. His finger slid past Dean’s tongue, and even though he couldn’t move, he could still feel it, and, like, two minutes ago Cas was fucking smiting werewolves with these hands, and honestly, the heat flowing through his veins had little to do with any kind of fever.
Cas didn’t seem to hear, thank god. His phone went dark. “You should get some rest, Dean. We have a long drive back tomorrow.”
Cas eased his finger out of Dean and left the bed, quickly finding the lube in Dean’s bag and returning to his spot between Dean’s thighs. Dean closed his eyes in anticipation at the sound of the cap flipping open. He let his legs fall further apart when Cas nudged at his inner thigh with his knee, and he was almost quivering by the time Cas finally pressed his lubed finger once again to Dean’s hole. It slid inside easier than before, further, and Cas resumed his rhythm from before as he worked it inside, bit by bit, until his knuckles were pressed up against Dean’s ass.
When he was done the toast, Cas started on the lasagna as well. He started picking it apart again, but after the first bite, he just started shoveling it in. Dean tried not to laugh. Man, he’d have to slip this into all of Cas’ food from now on, just so he’d appreciate his cooking.
“Which one is Rowena’s room?” he asked.
Sam was sitting in the living room with Cas and Dean when Rowena came in. She was dressed in a long, silky purple nightgown. The dark colour really complimented the red of her hair. “That’s a really pretty nightgown,” Sam said to her.
Cas thought about it for a moment. He tried to see it from Dean’s point of view. If he could watch Dean’s eyes glaze over, see him moan and…
“Not that I can think of.” Castiel sighed. “What makes it worse, is I can still hear him praying to me. He doesn’t know I’m no longer in the Empty. He talks to me. He… he says so many things he never said before. He told me he loves me.”
He wasn’t sure what to do next, so he looked at the newspaper again. Apparently, a woman had survived, and was still in the hospital. Castiel headed there next. He didn’t have a suit or any identification or badges, so he wasn’t sure exactly what he was going to say, but when he pulled up in front of the building and saw a cop coming out, he decided to just go right for it. He rolled down his window and flagged the cop over.
“Let me take your temperature,” Cas said, holding up his index finger.
“Really?” Sam took the paper from Jack. “Huh,” he said. He read further down. “Jack, it says here it’s for this weekend! It’s Thursday now!”
“Oh. Well, I was kind of loaded, Sammy.”
“Dean,” he said, trying to sound threatening.
As soon as he saw the flannel on the back of the chair, he realized it was Dean’s room, but it wasn’t empty. There, in the bed, was the ski instructor, Guy.
Sam beamed at her.
“Uh… neat?” Dean said.
Fine by him.
“It’s when solar flares react with ionizing gasses in the polar regions of the outer atmosphere. It’s a relatively rare phenomena this far south.”
“I know. It was destroyed when the Empty took you. Your vessel, it was… unusual. It was integrated with your grace in a way unlike other angels. With time, I could, perhaps, recreate it. But you’ll be possessing it, like you did with Jimmy originally. You won’t have the same feelings and experiences you did after Chuck rebuilt you.”
Dean did actually feel a bit bad about it. It was just a joke. He tried explaining it, like a kick me sign or when Sam had put crazy glue on Dean’s beer bottle.
“It’s harmless,” Cas said. “It’s not addictive. It’s not even irresistible. It’s just very alluring. And if we smell it or eat it, it can induce a kind of euphoria in angels. It doesn’t last long, and there’s no after effects.”
“No, not your room. Your- nevermind.” He stepped closer, and spoke a little louder. “Is it my imagination or is your son Dean attracted to-”
They were a bit stiff and sore when they returned to the bunker on Monday night, and everyone waved off suggestions that they hang out and watch a movie or something.
Dean turned on the tv while he ate, watching Cas as he disassembled his burger and ate the parts he liked. Afterward, he headed into the shower and cleaned up, returning to the room to find Cas had removed his coat, jacket, and tie, as well as his shoes, and was laying on his bed looking at his phone.
“Look, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. It’s a shitty thing to do to someone, to give them something without their consent.”
They wandered through the bunker alone afterwards. It was quiet. Castiel tried to sleep at night, in Dean’s room. He didn’t pray. What could he ask for? Jack wouldn’t interfere, wouldn’t bring Dean back. If Castiel had just stayed in Heaven, he and Dean would be together now.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“Dean, you’re forty years old. And Cas doesn’t understand pranks. It’s not like he’s gonna figure out how to get you back. This just looks like you’re picking on him.”
“Why would that be funny, though? I don’t understand the joke?”
“Fuck me,” Dean muttered under his breath.
“I… I don’t know.”
“Is there anything else we need to do right now?” Cas asked.
“Dean, Dean, please do not be jealous. It’s not what it looks like!”
“Dean, you ordered the wrong herb.”
“Did you find a case?’ Dean asked.
“Ohhh,” Mary said, smiling brightly and turning back to her pot.
“Should I go lower?” he murmured.
“Perhaps I ought to confirm your temperature again, Dean.” Cas said. His voice was shaking.
have some privacy?”
Sam could only watch in dawning awareness as Cas nodded at Dean in agreement, who then proceeded to plant a kiss right on Cas’ lips, before taking his hand and tugging him out of the room.
He didn’t even have to do anything, really. Once he had made the connection to Dean between the effects of an orgasm and false ironwort, all he really needed to do was reinforce the concept a bit, and Dean would be left squirming.
Jack had leftover popcorn, which he offered to Dean, who took it and listened while Jack talked at length about the animated movie they’d gone to. After a while, Cas redirected him to bed, leaving the three of them in the kitchen.
Actually, he did moan. Dean felt his face heat up in embarrassment.
He didn’t have to consider it for long. He would miss Mary, Bobby, and Jack, his friends and family who lived in Heaven, but he knew he’d see them again. He was willing to wait.
She shook her head at him.
Dean leaned on the car next to Cas and looked at the sky. “What am I looking for?”
“Rowena!” Cas scolded. “Didn’t I tell you to leave Dean alone?”
“I don’t want him all to myself!” Cas exclaimed.
Dean turned down the next road he saw, then drove until Cas indicated he should pull over. He stopped the car, and shut it off, but Cas leaned over and put it on accessory mode, leaving the radio on. He rolled down the window and got out. Dean stepped out too, walking around to where Cas was leaning on the trunk, his feet crossed.
“No, I promised. I should keep my promises. If you want it, you can have it. I know you were thinking about taking a holiday.”
“Do you want some more toast?” Dean offered, holding out the plate to Cas.
“Hm,” Cas said against his mouth. “That’s what I want to hear.”
“You’re getting a little flushed too, Cas. Are you sure this isn’t contagious?”
“I still want to examine you again, just to be certain.” Cas helped Dean out of his jacket and led him over to the bed, directing him to sit. He turned on the light and leaned in close to Dean’s face. Dean could smell him, a kind of familiar fresh-air-and-ozone scent that Dean thought should be sold as fabric softener because if he could wash his sheets in it, he would seriously never get out of bed. He almost moaned.
“Maybe you should do my back,” Dean said.
Dean took a breath. He couldn’t believe he had to do this a second time.
Castiel returned to the bed, straddling Dean’s thighs. He tried to ignore how perfectly his hips seemed to nestle into Dean’s ass, and instead began to concentrate on each muscle as he worked his fingers into it, starting with the splenius capitus, down the trapezius to the deltoid. He ran his hands along the rhomboid major and minor muscles, inching his fingers along in small circles until he reached the latissimus dorsi, which he followed up to the ribs and then back down to the spine. The only thing left was the gluteus maximus, and honestly, mentally reciting all that Latin had not helped in the slightest.
“Well, uh… I think it was... maybe… how you got all into it and happy? I don’t know. I actually don’t really know how I thought it was funny at all. It was… interesting, though, I guess, how you got all… uhh…” Dean looked at him helplessly.
“Cas?” Dean whispered.
“I guess it really isn’t any of my business, though,” Cas continued. “I shouldn’t be thinking about who Dean… and Sam have the hots for. I should be thinking about Guy.”
He got to his feet, a little shaky, and leaned on Cas as he opened the door.
Cas immediately began mouthing his way down Dean’s torso again, stopping along the way to tongue each nipple. When he reached Dean’s navel, he inhaled deeply, letting out a delicious sounding groan that went straight to Dean’s cock. Which was in unprecedented vicinity to Cas’ face right now.
When another moment passed without an answer, he tried again. “Castiel.”
Dinner was amazing. Or so everyone said. Cas couldn’t really taste anything, although he had eaten quite a lot, since Guy had made it. After everyone had disappeared, Cas had lingered to help tidy up and now he found himself sitting next to Rowena on the sofa in the living room watching Guy poke at the fire.
“Yeah, that, uh, sounds good.”
Everyone oohed and aahed appropriately.
They undressed themselves the rest of the way, then crawled together into Dean’s bed, where they came together in the middle by some unspoken agreement. Dean’s mouth found Cas’, and they lay like that for a while, running their hands over each others’ bodies, mapping them out, finding the sensitive spots and the soft spots, until eventually, Dean found himself on his back, Cas lying between his parted legs, his hips moving in a slow rhythm.
Dean decided to drop it, for now. But he wasn’t going to trust this guy for a second.
Cas frowned, looking at his hand as though he just noticed he was holding it. He flushed a little and deposited it back into his pocket. “Not particularly, Dean.” He set his book down and stood up, taking the two steps needed to be within arms reach of Dean. He tilted his head to the side, his eyes narrowed. “Are you feeling all right?”
“Can I help you with your bags, Cas?”
Now Dean was actually panicking a little. This was taking longer than he thought. If Cas pulled back now, he might die. As long as he didn’t, they couldn’t argue, they couldn’t fight, Cas couldn’t
Ironwood. Iron… something. Okay. Whatever. It was in the history or something. Dean stared at the website. It was not really a good website. Small print. Lots of links, poorly designed. He sighed, trying to find the order history, but it was just a jumble of crap. He didn’t feel like looking at it. He did find the search bar though. He started typing, poking at the keyboard with one finger.
He didn’t notice Dean gazing at him wistfully as he murmured, “I can make you steamy…”
it. Dean stopped breathing for a moment, until Cas let out a sigh, almost a growl, and Dean released his own breath.
There was still no answer.
Cas slid out of the bed and towards the door. Dean noticed he was wearing nothing but his pajama bottoms, leaving his chest bare.
Guy nodded knowingly. “Oh. I understand.” He winked at Dean.
“Did he say so?”
“Might as well relax for a few minutes.” Cas brought his hand up to his face and inhaled. Dean’s eyes widened. Cas let out a hum of satisfaction that seemed to reverberate through Dean’s body.
Castiel thanked the cop and headed back onto the road, going east, out of Canton and into the surrounding farmland. He figured the boys had probably found a lead, and were looking for some kind of abandoned building or something. Castiel figured he’d drive to East Canton, and if he didn’t see anything promising along the way, he’d head back here, and check the motels again.
invited.
Dean tried not to think about it, most of the time. Castiel was thousands of years old, and he wanted to believe that he would continue for thousands more. The powerful, immortal being who showed up in a flash of exploding lights and thunder, the shadow of his great, full wings, the otherworldly blue of his eyes striking terror in Dean that he’d fought to hide. So different than this apparently middle aged man lying on a motel bed in his socks.
He looked away.
Dean could feel Cas looking at him in the dark, and he suddenly felt self-conscious, even though it had been Cas who was exposed. Without saying anything, he moved to lean on the Impala beside Cas again, and turned his attention back to the sky.
Dean couldn’t even answer, he was laughing so hard. That drew Cas’ attention too, and it finally sunk into his fogged-up feather brain what was going on. He glared at Dean and set the blanket down. “That’s not funny, Dean,” he gritted out, before standing up and walking out of the room.
What?
He shuddered in anticipation when Cas returned his hand to Dean’s ass, brushing his fingertip gently over his hole a few times before finally easing the wet tip of his finger inside.
“Hell yeah. I wanna see… I’m dying to know if I can do anything to you that can make those wings pop out again.”
“I thought I heard you in here,” Guy said. He must have picked up on Dean’s desperation, because he glanced back at Rowena before adding, “I have that thing I was telling you about. In my room?” Dean was confused for a moment, before he realized Guy was giving him an out. Maybe this guy wasn’t so bad after all.
“In the mountains, it’s good to have a little fat in your booze.” She turned and went into the kitchen.
Castiel thought about Claire, and Kaia, and Jody. About Sam and Eileen and tiny Dean. His family.
“Is that so?” Cas asked. “Like this?” And he moved his mouth across Dean’s jaw and down his throat, licking and kissing along the way.
“Uhh… definitely,” Dean croaked, trying to slide out from under Rowena.
“I’ll walk you there,” Dean blurted out. “The hall is dark.” He shrugged at Guy. “I think my room is safe now.”
“I’m so sorry,” Cas stammered, backing towards the door to his own room. “I ruined it for you, I had no idea.”
“But he
“Come in me, Cas, I want you to.” And he did. Holy shit, he’d never wanted anything more.
“Mom wanted to nap, and it’s her truck,” Sam bit back. “Besides. It wasn’t deliberate. I’m... “ Dean smirked as Sammy realized he was caught.
It seemed like all he could think of since Minnesota was Cas
“Yeah, sure did. They headed out that way an hour or two ago,” the cop replied, pointing east. “I think they were headed out towards East Canton, from what they said.”
“Fuck yes,” Dean said.
They finished cleaning up the mess - of both the fluid and feather variety - just as Sam and Jack returned from the theatre. Since both of them tended to be night owls, their absence would probably cause more questions than it answered, and Dean knew it wouldn’t be long before Sam came banging on his door. So they both got dressed and headed out into the common area.
He sat up straighter when he saw Dean jogging towards the Prius. Castiel rolled the window down and Dean bent to talk to him, arms crossed on the roof, the sides of his open flannel fluttering.
still had the same neighbors living across from him, there were children to think about. But with the heavy rain and the approaching thunder, there was no way he heard Dean out here. He looked down at the keyring still gripped in his hand. There were three keys on it, resting against the bullet keychain. His car, his home, and Cas'.
“A cloud.”
, bringing him in close and holding him tight. He felt Cas’ body ease.
The peeling paint of the porch chipped under Castiel’s shoes as he shuffled up to the front door, peering into the house beyond. His toe kicked the crooked welcome mat and he tapped it straight against the jamb, reading it and then rereading it with a squint and a slight tilt to his head.
“I can’t drink this.”
“…Alright.” Zachariah finally said, and Castiel let his eyes fall closed, uncertain if it was in relief or in horror. “Draw up the new contract.
“Huh.” Dean muttered something else that Cas didn’t catch. He didn’t ask, figuring he was probably better off not knowing.
That would explain why Castiel hadn’t noticed it yesterday.
Cas buried his face in the crook of his elbow and sneezed.

“Man, you gotta figure out your levels. Last person who looked at me like that had me thinking marriage."
“Dean, maybe
If you have personal experience with any of the above and I’ve made an egregious mistake in my depiction of their care or environment, please let me know. Dean is a good boy and cares deeply about his farm kids (that includes all of them not just the goats haha goat puns).

of drying off in the sun, though. That wet shirt had left very little to the imagination. There was no call for a land-stealing corporate puppet to be that
android?
“What’s mine is yours, Dean. I have no qualms sharing everything I have with you.”
Castiel smoothed his hand down the placket of his button-down, lifting his chin a fraction and setting his shoulders. He tried to avoid assumptions about the people he was to meet and charm the land away from, but he’d dealt with enough farmers by now to have built a sort of generalized expectation of what was approaching him. It was likely someone sort of squared-off, stone-ground, compact; middle-aged and definitely starting to show it. It was likely someone with wind-chapped rough skin, hooded eyes from years of heavy squinting, and a thin mouth set into a suspicious frown.
Well, if he could pry him out,
"Thank you."
“Looks like Michael.” He said, distantly.
to hear that! You know you can ask for company, Cas, that ain't weakness, that's just basic human needs! If I can drive here in the middle of the night in the middle of a thunderstorm, I can get here any time!”
Cas took the egg slowly, still waiting for the ‘sike’. Dean just gave a wide-armed shrug.
The clock on the Prius dashboard read 6:29AM when Castiel turned onto the long gravel drive of Winchester Farm.
He’d thought it looked large when he’d seen it from the front porch. It was
He had no idea what to expect come sunup tomorrow. Maybe Castiel wouldn’t even show. Maybe he
Cas nodded, solemn. “I capiche."
“Dean, why did you drive all the way here in the middle of the night in the middle of a thunderstorm?”
"What?"
“Slow down, dude. You’re gonna give yourself the bends.”

Did you get the goat pun on the welcome mat? I don't think Cas did.
turn out to be a robot with no unhappy human inside, and then he’d be back at square one. Wasn’t this all just a waste of time? Shit, should he have just told this one to go fuck himself before he kicked him bodily to the curb? What if that “slip-up” had actually been
Castiel threw the car into park, letting his head fall back against the headrest. The farmhouse loomed before him, all weather-worn shiplap siding and dusty window screens, faded green shutters and a front porch jutting from the house like an underbite.
Cas nodded, tiny smile still there, and Dean slapped Cas’ thigh amicably.
That… was probably the most interesting day he’d had in

Dean understood why Cas needed to stay. He couldn’t burden Cas with a ninety minute commute any more than he could stomach one himself, and Cas’ internship with the wildlife refuge was close enough to the place they’d rented senior year that it just made more sense that he stay there than it did to uproot him.
“Labor. I agree to work on the farm for two weeks.”
“Holy
Dean turned the engine over and threw the car into reverse, swinging out of his parking space, the falling rain shimmering in the two conical beams of his headlights.
Dean gives a little huff through his nose. Cas folds his hands in his lap and turns his head forward to watch the fireflies.
It rang for so long that Dean was sure he was going to get kicked to voicemail before the line finally clicked through.
"You, uh." Dean said articulately, pointing to his own mouth in the universal sign of
Dean reached out and plucked the streamer from Cas' lip, holding it up.
“Nope, this jackass is tryin’a earn the farm out from under me. Works for some suburban developer. What was it? Hell’s Bells?”
He handed Cas a scouring pad and pointed to a bench on the back porch, under the kitchen window. “Now you get to clean the all shit off of ‘em. Literally.”
“Upgrading. Improving. We take existing foundations and build upon them.”
“Hang on, back here.” A voice called back.

He approached the desk and leaned to try to see through the open office door behind it. There was, at least, a light on in there.
He could see a dark shape lying curled on the couch. Dean kept his footfalls as light as possible as he hurried across the hardwood floor, kneeling beside Cas and touching his shoulder.
Just thought it would be good to note: I do not have any real farm experience. I stayed at a BnB on a farm once and I’ve been to the county fair many times when I was a 4-H student, but I’ve never been personally responsible for any chickens, cows, pigs, or goats. Yet.
The tires of the Prius crunched to a stop at the end of the long gravel driveway.
He dumped the contents of the folder to study in its entirety, rubbing a finger thoughtfully across his bottom lip as he read. Castiel watched him with unease. The client was reviewing the material, that should count as a step in the right direction. But he could practically
Sunup to sundown. Almost there. He could make it. He should probably stop at a drugstore on the way back to the motel, stock up on painkillers, blister pads and bandages, stronger deodorant, probably a pack of generic boxer briefs. Maybe sleeping pills. Could he mix sleeping pills and painkillers? No, that sounded like the last mistake he might ever make.
“So get to the damn point! What
Something small and solid hit him in the chest and Cas flailed in alarm, collapsing gracelessly into the grass. He had just enough time to realize that the
Nothing stirred from inside the house, no one hollered back.
“Bobby.” He explained, unprompted. “Owns Singer Salvage on the west side of town. Real handy guy. Always been a good friend to me ’n’ the family. Hell, he, uh —” Dean glanced over at Cas and seemed to snap out of something. “Never mind. You know the, uh, arch? At the turn onto the farm?”
God, the
Clementine shifted on her back legs and Cas was sure he was about to see her foot go right into the bucket, but Dean just moved it out from under her and dumped what he had collected into the other waiting pail, through the cheesecloth. He resettled and kept going, the milk hitting the empty bottom with that high tinny noise again, and he started humming as he worked.
Dean dialed his voicemail box as he dug the Impala keys from his jacket, the familiar metal shape tinkling against the shiny bullet keychain he kept on the ring.
that does it for you? Not feeling it much in your otherwise miserable life?”
"Shut up this is a good one. Have you seen this one?"
, we’ll need these for tomorrow.”
Anyway, it would be two weeks of something completely different, Castiel thought as he brushed his teeth. Fresh air and sun, surrounded by all that beautiful green.
Alright damn this chapter got away from me
“Good answer.” Dean glanced at him from over his shoulder, blue flame licking at the flat bottom of the skillet. “Park it a minute. You’re gonna need the energy.”
“Come on, I’ve got milk to take up to the house.”
“Damn it.” Cas said quietly. Then, stronger, “No, I’m sorry. I’m fine, I shouldn’t have called you. Disregard this. I...”
His friends must not be any fucking fun, because Cas seemed to be severely lacking in that department.
He said it in such a throwaway manner, like it was nothing more than cold cereal and not one of the most elaborate breakfasts that Cas had seen in a long time. He looked down at glistening, bright red tomatoes and vibrantly yellow yolks, perfectly crisped bacon and golden-brown hash browns and wondered if this
She waved it off. “Oh, please, it’s always welcome. What can I do you for?”
“Thank you.”
“Eat up.”
Dean handed him a heaping bowl of pasta salad with large chunks of sweet heirloom tomato, cucumber, fresh mozzarella pearls, and summer sausage. The bowl was pleasantly cool against his raw hands.
"Okay, let's get this show on the road. I have a meeting with Rowena tonight." Gabriel said. He had noticed Sam's reaction to Rowena last night and he would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy it. Sam made his bitch face.
"Gabe! Let me go," Sam begged with tears streaming down his face. Gabe flew them back to Sam's room in the bunker.
"Hey Jack, can you please bring the car back?" Sam asked.
"Dean, I know exactly what is going through your head right now. But I need you to focus on me. Dean, you are doing so well. I know you can get through this Dean." Castiel knew that trying to contradict Dean's thoughts wouldn't help. It would just make Dean more exhausted. Instead, he focused on comfort. He also kept on repeating Dean's name to get his attention in case it was slipping.
"Really? Dean spent his life being repressed and over compensating for his sexuality. It took him losing Cassie permanently to deal with feelings he has had for over 12 years and he was okay with letting Jack die." Gabe said.
"She WHAT?"
“Would you be okay with becoming human if it meant you didn’t have to go to the Empty?” This time, Dean ignored Cas’ confusion.
"Give me your trench coat." Dean stated simply.
“I am going to end this call before I kill the two of you.”
"I don't think this is an appropriate..." Castiel started, still trying to preserve a little bit of his son's innocence.
Castiel had no response for the outburst. Instead, he stood up and did what he does best: offer practical advice. "Dean, you should rest. You aren't completely healed yet."
“I know.” Cas started brushing past Dean’s question again. “I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive and you're angry and you're broken. You're -- You're "Daddy's Blunt Instrument." And you think that hate and anger that's -- that's what drives you. That's who you are. It's not. And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know. You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean.”
"How can I help you?" The queen asked.
"I did, but then Dean decided to pay me a visit and that kinda went out the window." Jack sighed. "Look Sam and Dean, heaven's great. But there is something about being on Earth that you can't find in heaven. There, you don't need anything. Here, you are bound by life, the need for purpose. I don't want that taken away from you just yet. I really want you to experience growing old, having families, homes. Seeing Dean that day haunted me. You both deserve so much better than that."
“What do you want?” Sam asked, clearly annoyed. Dean and Cas could hear the heavy metal playing in the background.
“Where’s Jack?” Dean asked, his mouth full of food.
Castiel chuckled.
“I think I have some bad news.”
He heard his phone play as he gasped for air.
"Yes, we should do that. It would be nice to see Sam and Dean again, under better circumstances." Jack responded.
"That got me thinking about gathering a few hunters and giving them these powers. If they misuse them, or want to quit hunting, we can take the powers back." Gabriel concluded.
Dean appeared in the middle of nowhere. He knew exactly what had happened and was ready to start the next phase of his life... or rather death. Sam would be fine, he was meant to survive.
bunker. They were afraid that the outside world would ruin it, like it had so many times before. Finally, it was bedtime.
“I dated a girl from India before I met Jess in college. My point is that I understand why you’re afraid but right now, you are trying to cool down buttermilk. It’s fine. You need to relax for both of your sake.”
"Heya Sammy," Dean said right before he jolted awake.
“What?”
"We broke up. We still love each other, but more as friends. I fell in love with a jerk of an archangel a long time ago and still have unresolved feelings."
After a lazy morning, Dean and Cas finally got out of bed and got some brunch.
"Okay so would you not be jealous if I talked about seeing Meg in the empty?"
"You never did tell me about this Ms. Butters." Castiel questioned.
"If you weren't there, nothing would have kept Dean going all these years. Your existence gave him a purpose. You didn’t find out because he didn’t want you to. That’s not on you. Sam, he needs you right now. Please talk to him."
Castiel flew away with a blink of an eye. Dean got on his bed and draped the trench coat around him like a blanket. He drifted off to a sleep full of nightmares. This time, he only
"When did it start?" Sam asked, his voice small.
"Well, I died, thought I should catch up with you and found myself here."
"Cas. I need to find Cas." Dean said.
“Why didn’t you wake me?”
“Cas, you’re alright.”
After a long and anxious night for Gabriel, everyone finally woke up. Jack had his powers restored, Dean and Castiel were much more energized and Sam seemed well rested too.
“Go, trust me, you’ll enjoy it.” Dean said. Cas and Brandon walked off and Dean went to the waiting area so he could keep Cas in his sight.
"You are always welcome here." Dean promised. Jack gave a warm smile in response.
"Why didn't he just bring her back?"
"Oh god."
"So we would be like Miley Cyrus and get the best of both world?" Dean joked.
"He really is doing great. I am so proud of him. Thank you for taking care of him when I couldn't. It was you and Sam that helped him get through this."
“Yeah, now you look like a baby in a trenchcoat.” Dean said, adding more venom in his voice than he intended. A hurt look flashed over Cas’ face, very brief but impossible to miss. Sam threw him a bitch face and went off to pay. Dean and Cas stood there for a minute, both eye fuking each other.
"Are you planning on going to hell with Gabe to meet Rowena?" Dean said.
They ordered pizza that night. Everything seemed to settle back to normal. The only change was that Cas was being dragged to Dean’s room when everyone was headed to bed.
"Great, I suppose we should get somewhere more private." Gabriel said, leading Sam out of the room.
"What?" Castiel was confused by this odd request.
“Hmm…” Cas stirred sleepily.
"I said he needs to get NAILED."
"Fair enough. In that case, I'll text you the details. And Cas, I know our first activity for the weekend." Castiel threw his trademarked confused head tilt.
"So," Sam started. "I was thinking what if Gabe and I take this new case? I can teach him how to hunt and the four of us can have a chance to get used to our new relationships. I haven't talked to Gabe yet but I doubt he will say no." Sam wasn’t ready to confront the reality of his past yet. He could barely face Dean and thought that a couple days away might give him the chance to clear his mind.
“Sure, what options did you have in mind?” Cas listed a couple of options and Brandon helped him narrow it down. Somehow, they ended up picking the same style Cas had when he first met Dean.
I want to give a content warning for past parental abuse. It starts at the end of this chapter and will continue though out the story.
"Wait, but I thought you had a no interference policy." Sam said.
"I love you so much." Dean mumbled against Cas' lips.
Jack decided to take this time to look into the possible angels to bond with hunters. Even though they had broken up, Eileen's safety was still a priority for Sam. Jack also wanted to ensure that his sister and her family would be safe too so he looked for options for Claire, Jody, Donna and the other girls. Castiel made Dean go to bed early since he had a rough day and got to work with Jack. Somehow, he managed to keep Dean away from alcohol too.
"Worried about me!?" Dean suddenly yelled. "Oh, he was worried about me. Fan-fucking-tastic Cas. And what about how terrified I got when I saw The Empty take you? Do you have a fucking clue how I felt when you were gone? It was like I was dying everyday and was sent to hell everyday. You left! You fucking left without letting me say goodbye, without letting me say..." Dean trailed off.
“Let’s get you shampooed.” Brandon said.
"Of course, take a seat first." Rowena offered.
Sam and Gabriel walked hand in hand into the kitchen to find Dean and Castiel dancing while cooking eggs. He pressed pause on the loud music and started singing "Dean and Cas sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. First comes love then comes marriage, then come Destiel in a baby carriage."
I wrote out several different versions but I think the mix of anger and softness in this works best.
"You said that Dean needs to get impaled to..."
"He is doing a great job. Yeah, he doesn't get a normal childhood and it's unfair that he literally has to deal with the weight of the universe but he can handle it. Don't make this about what you want for him. You are doing such a good job with the kid. He can ask you for help and support, that's a lot more than I could ask of my dad."
"Dean!" Castiel said sternly, rebuking him for his choice of words.
When Dean stopped coughing, he looked up to see Castiel with an amused smile.
“What do you mean you’re done?”
"It was the least I could do after I separated you both from her again. Also, after this ritual, you can come and meet her anytime you want." Jack said. Dean and Sam had the biggest smiles on their faces.
"He is not 'daddy's blunt little instrument'. Dad always hunted for revenge. Dean hunts to save lives. To make sure no one has to go into this life like how we did." Sam said.
“I don’t know, I was just going to let Dean cut my hair according to his preference.”
never wish the regret of not getting the final goodbye on anyone, especially his little brother.
"Yeah, no I just had a weird ass dream."
"Dude, wings," Dean said, fluttering his for added measure. Gabriel turned a shade of deep red from both guilt and embarrassment. He had been so caught up in him turning partially human that he forgot his soulmate was going through a tough time too. Old habits die hard.
Castiel gave a slight nod and went off to the Dean Cave.
"Hello, Jack, you asked for me?" Castiel appeared out of nowhere. He gasped at the sight of Dean. Ever since he had come back as an archangel, he had avoided watching Dean. It would be too painful to see him out with girls. What Castiel didn't know was that Dean had spent every minute grieving him.
"Okay, Dean, Jack, Cas. Spill. Why are you behaving like this?" Sam said. Jack and Castiel stayed silent, offering silent support to Dean.
“And your cult? They just let you go?”
"Sam?" Gabe shook him gently.
"Cas, I love you but I don't want them healed now. Not yet." Dean tried to snuggle closer to Castiel and Castiel held on to him tighter as though his actions could keep Dean's mind from wandering into the past.
"Yeah well he kept on grilling me with questions on the way back from that case with the love sick zombie. So I told him everything he needed to know about how to get a girl." Dean defended.
“Don’t apologize. Do you not remember what I said last night?” Dean took Cas’ hand in his own. Castiel shook his head in response.
"Is he okay?" Dean asked.
"Since we have time can I go visit..." Dean trailed off.
"I saw you every time I killed Dean. I felt your hatred for me, your repulsion. I told you once that running away was my biggest regret. Well, that changed the day I died because that is the day I didn't run for once in my eternal life. But the Empty found something worse for me. It found my worst flaw: selfishness and used it against me. Now I have a chance to fix that. You and I both know Dean would never have gone through with this if you didn't either. This is my chance to give back and so something for someone else. Also, let's not forget that I do get the perk of never having to go back there again. So my intentions might be a little selfish."
“Cas, do you know what today is?” Dean asked.
"Did Dean ever tell you how I died?" Castiel asked.
Sam was flabbergasted. A part of him thought that Dean is too emotional to think clearly right now but he also knew how difficult it was on Dean when Cas left him. No one had lost each other more than Dean and Cas.
"Gabriel, please, we are doing no such thing. Anyways, do you really have to be so crude around Jack? He is only 3." Castiel said sternly.
"You saw who in the what now?"
Dean took his shirt off and distanced himself from Castiel. Dean felt chilly at the loss of contact but pulled through. He still held on to Cas' hand for comfort. The hunter pointed to a tiny scar on his left abdomen.
“What are you talking about?” Cas asked. Dean sealed the vile and Billie finally broke the door down and walked in.
Tran to heaven, got me and Gabriel back from the empty and asked your mom if she wanted to come back. She said no. She didn't see a point in going back only to die again. She said it would be better if this was the end for her."
“He will be. He’s sleeping right now.” Dean refused to make eye contact because he knew he was crying.
"Again, I had been captured and depleted of my grace. I was severely sex-depreived."
the empty from taking him if he dies. Cas dying is not an option unless if he can’t go to the same place I go. Even then, I would prefer that we have a life here.”
As always, kudos and comments are appreciated! I love hearing from you! :)
“Sorry? You are fucking sorry? I thought you were dead, Dean. Everyone is gone, Jo, Claire, Elieen. It’s just me and Jack. I thought I lost the two of you too.” Sam’s voice broke at the mention of Elieen’s name.
"You're right he should be here. I am going to find him." Sam got off the bed and started walking towards the door.
I wanted to add that I know its difficult for gay couples to find a house, engage in PDA in a public place and adopt a child. All of this happened very easily for Destiel. I hate homophobia and writing homophobia breaks my heart every time. Since this is a very fluffy/feel good piece, it does not have homophobic content nor shows Destiel having to fight it. I just wanted things to be easy for these characters after everything they have gone though. At the same time, I do want to acknowledge that it is not this simple in real life.
“No, you called me a pain in your ass. The Dean in the Empty was way too polite to be you.”
“I met Dean and his brother, Sam, on one of my missions. They showed me how beautiful the outside world can be and saved me.”
Dean was the first to pull back, as he was the only one who needed air. He looked at Castiel, who was as confused as ever. Dean wrapped his hands around Cas' back, pulling him into a tight hug.
"Man, you are so whipped." Sam said. "You wouldn't have been caught dead with a mimosa three months ago."
"He did this a few weeks after mom died. He came home drunk. Sammy was crying and he was yelling, which didn't help the crying at all. It became a vicious circle and I was scared. I didn't know why mom wasn't with us, I didn't know what to do about dad and I sure as hell didn't know how to take care of a 6 month old baby. He was just yelling from the chair and I was trying to get Sammy to calm down. After who knows how long, he got up and marched towards the crib. I was in the crib as well because I couldn't exactly carry Sammy as a four year old. I just saw him loom over us and I yelled 'Stop'. That wasn't the right thing to say. He fished me out of the crib, got his belt and well, you know the rest." Dean said. His tone was surprisingly neutral, numb.
“I will not lose him again like this. We aren’t hunting anymore.” Dean decided.
Sam and Jack couldn’t help laughing as Dean pulled back, stunned that the Empty, whose sole purpose was to tourture Cas, was nicer than him.
They entered the store holding hands. Dean and Castiel were browsing at the carpet swatches.
“Only because you admitted your love to me first.” Dean said.
“I always wondered since I took that burden, that curse, what it could be. What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer. Because the one thing I want...it's something I know I can't have. But I think I know...I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having. It's in just being...It's in just saying it.” There was a teary smile on Cas’ face. A little too peaceful. Dean, on the other hand, felt every bit of panic and anxiety that he had managed to suppress for the past 41 years.
"What are you doing back so soon? It's only been a night. Is Jack okay?" Dean asked when his mind began to work again.
“Fine. How is Sam doing?” It was an obvious diversion but Dean let it go.
“Don’t sound so surprised, feathers. I would have done anything to save you. I love you too, you ass butt.” He leaned in to kiss Cas on the cheek.
"I know. I just want you to know that I love you and admire your patience with me so much."
“Because!” Because what if he likes them better than me? Because what if he realizes I was never worth it? Because what if he leaves? Because what if he gets hurt? Because what if I’m too late again? A million reasons race through Dean’s mind yet he can’t voice any of them.
"Sam, are you alright?" Castiel asked.
"He can hear that?"
"Cas," Dean said softly, almost like he was praying to him in secret again.
The two of them were crying as Cas nodded and leaned in to kiss Dean. Dean returned the sweet and gentle kiss but before he could deepen it, Castiel  stood up. Dean gave a confused look as Cas pulled a small box from his back pocket.
"I'm fine, Sammy, it's not like I died."
An uncertain silence hung over them. Dean had forgiven Castiel but there was still some tension with Jack. It was still a sore subject.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas replied. He picked up the sandwich and scarfed it down in three bites. They continued to eat until Sam and Jack got there.
"You have the most beautiful soul I have ever seen. You are no monster." Castiel said. Dean felt grace tingle his skin.
“Did Gabe not get my message?” Dean asked, earning a confused look from Cas. Dean threw his signature smile, making it obvious that he was up to no good.
"Hey, I don't know what that was about but I'm so sorry I made you feel so much pain. Everything with those other girls meant nothing. It was just a distraction so I didn't have to think about being a hunter or raising my brother by myself. And Lisa was my safe space. I loved her but you gotta know that you are it for me, Cas." Dean said.
When Dean finally checked his phone, he saw that Sam had left over a hundred calls and messages. He gently woke Cas up by leaving kissed all over his face.
Dean got up and straighten himself before he sat down again and buried his face in Castiel's chest. Even though he just woke up, he felt exhausted. His eyelids felt heavy, his hands were sore from being clenched so hard and he felt his heart ache.
"I don't understand why Dean defends him. How could he not hate him for this? I hate him."
Heat of the moment
"Yes?" Sam, Dean and Gabriel answered.
"I know that you have made it clear you would like to stay in heaven but you need to go back down there. You have to look after them. Please." Jack pleaded.
"It's been 38 years."
"What made you change your mind?" Castiel asked.
"Will he ever get over this?"
After trading back the leather jacket and trench coat, the two of them walked over to the library, hand in hand.
“What are you doing, Dean? I’m perfectly capable of walking.” Cas cried over Dean’s shoulder.
"Well, don't expect to get the largest piece of the pie everytime." Dean responded. A moment of silence passed over them as they relished each other's company. No apocalypse, no demons or angels wanting to kill them, no useless fighting. Just family time.
"When Jack died and went to heaven, the empty came to claim his soul since he was a being with grace. I made a deal with the empty in trade of Jack's soul. The empty was supposed to take me when I was at my happiest. When we were trapped with Billie I realized what makes me happy was loving Dean. Yes, I was over the moon when told me he loved me back but that was only because I was in love with him in the first place. When you love someone, you want to make THEM happy, you are willing to sacrifice your life for them. You aren't really looking for someone to do things for you. Happiness isn't in the having, it's in the being." Castiel said.
"He needs you just as much as you need him." Cas said, opening the door wider and letting Sam step in. Sam let go of a breath he didn't realize he was holding as he stepped inside. He walked around to see Dean sleeping peacefully and smiled. Once Sam got confirmation that there was no handprint on his brother's face, he thanked Castiel and made his way back to Gabriel.
"Your dad is in there."
“It wouldn’t allow me to go in. I can’t go without my grace. It would just spit me back out. But why...” Another wave of relief passed over Dean as he asked Cas the most important question.
"You planning on catching up with anyone else there?" Dean asked casually, as if Sam was attending his Stanford reunion.
“You can put me down. I’ll still come home with you.”
"Umm. I know this is hard but can you avoid hunting for the week? I am pretty sure Jack's been keeping and eye on us and I don't want him to get so rattled again."
“How are you guys doing?“ Sam asked.
Dean hid his face in Castiel's shoulder while everyone else burst out laughing.
“We just had brunch. Woke up…” before Dean finished that sentence he heard heat of the moment blaring from the background. There was no prelude or anything, the heavy-metal just switched to the middle of the song. He and Castiel doubled over laughing.
“Dean, is Cas okay?” Jack’s voice betrayed his concern.
"No baby, I didn't but I still hurt you. Remember when I said that just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD. Well, that applies here. I shouldn't have done those things, especially in front of your face."
Castiel, Gabriel and Jack reached the bunker just in time to see Sam and Eileen making out. Castiel threw a glance at his brother to make sure he was alright. Gabe did his best to pretend to not be bothered by this and Jack said, "Hi, I'm Jack." to introduce himself to Eileen.
"He's in the library but don't get up. I'll tell him you are looking for... oh and he is out of the room, jerk."
"You heard our conversation last night." Castiel stated. There was no accusation in his voice. Jack nodded slightly as Dean turned off the stove. The couple let out a shaky breath. Dean hugged Jack again.
breakdown got bad, she would make me think of you, talk about you. I told her the story about how I rebuilt your body so much, she had it memorized. Lastly, I picked you and
"Yeah right! I'm not falling for that again." they heard Sam say.
“Dean? That’s really you?” he heard a small, confused voice. Dean froze in his spot and took a moment to shine the light around his space. He saw Cas to the left, clearly confused. Dean turned and marched towards him.
They spent the rest of the day snuggled in the Dean Cave. They talked, watched movies, made out every now and then. It was the perfect date. Neither of them wanted to leave the
“Hiya Sammy.” Dean smiled.
"Do you want one of my leather jackets?"
"You're alive!" Sam exclaimed.
"Would you like to talk about it?" Castiel fully expected Dean to say no. Talking about his feelings wasn't a strength of Dean's."
"He has feelings for my brother." Castiel started to fill Dean in on everything he knew about Sabriel at the moment. The two of them decided that their first act as a semi-angel couple would be to play Cupid.
“Dean, you are too emotional. Let me drive. I will get us there soon.” Sam reasoned.
"Thanks, kid. I knew she was happy here but I never thought she could ever be this happy. You did great." Dean said.
"I haven't really thought about it but eventually, yeah. I would probably go visit him. See how his reform is going." Sam responded.
“Why do we have to skip lunch?” Cas asked.
Elieen had moved into the newly named people of letters bunker and Jack and Gabe always had a room there in case they felt like visiting. Elieen knew that after the crap all of them had been through, Sam would not be okay with leaving his brother. She was well aware of their (non-sexual) codependent tendencies and realized that they were a package deal for now. It also made coordinating hunts much easier.
“What was that about?” he asked.
"Alright, let's head off." Gabriel said, breaking Jack from his thoughts.
"So, what are you guys planning on doing today?" Sam asked.
"Castiel. What are you doing back so soon? I thought you and Dean would need some time to yourselves." Jack asked.
Sam over Heaven, which was my home for eternity. Do you really think I would pick her over you?"
"Need some help there?" Gabriel asked in an amused voice. Sam looked up to see Gabe against the doorway and Dean and Castiel suppressed a smile as they walked in. Sam straightened up immediately.
Unbeknownst to them, Gabriel popped in at the perfect time to capture this moment on Sam’s phone.
"Breaking up with me already, angel? Dean grinned.
They could all see the wheels turning in Sam's mind and Gabe prepared for hell to break loose.
"Okay, so completely changing the subject, Jack, I need to know this. Will the Empty ever take Cas again?" Dean asked.
This brought back the burning sensation in Sam's throat. He had almost forgotten about Eileen but was still distracted with the idea of Gabe's one night stand. Sam decided to talk to Castiel in the morning. He figured the angel would know a thing or two about dealing with jealousy when your partner is oblivious as can be.
“Goodbye, Dean.” Cas said.
Suddenly, Dean gave Castiel's hand a squeeze.
“Well, I was looking at your posters by the waiting area and I liked a couple of them. However, since it’s my first time, I would really appreciate your input.” Dean was a little hurt that Cas decided to ask Brandon but he let it slide.
"You met her?"
"So, why can't we see your wings?" Sam asked Gabriel and Castiel.
“How could you think I don’t love you back? How could you think you could never have me? I was always yours. You made me yours the day you raised me from hell.” Dean whispered. He was completely crying at this point. Cas just had a look of utter disbelief.
"People! Listen. I know what we can do. Jack said that for every grace that latches on to humanity, there has to be humanity that latches on to grace. Well, what if Castiel takes on that humanity? If Castiel also has humanity in him, he can be with us in heaven when he dies!" Sam said.
“Cas, I need you to tell me what would happen if you went into the Empty without your grace, as a human.”
“Oh, but I just washed my hair this afternoon.” Dean had Cas rinse his hair before they began cutting.
Kudos and comments are appreciated! I thrive from praise. :)
It felt like the good old days again. Except this time, they weren't trying to kill God or vice versa.
"Well, Sammoose and I do have a profound bond." Gabriel teased. Castiel blushed at that and Dean looked away.
"Yeah, give me your trench coat. If I have to go a week without you, I'm keeping something that smells like you around."
"You know I forgave him, right? I was hurt but I wasn't mad at him. I love him too. It's just... she's my mom."
"Yeah." Dean replied.
“Are you sure that’s what you both want?”
"Sammy was 7 and he had a terrible fever. He had been throwing up all night and I was taking care of him. I managed to steal some medicine for him but it wasn't helping. When Sammy finally went to sleep for a couple of hours, he yelled at me. I had failed to take care of my little brother and that's why he had gotten so sick. It was my fault. He said a belt wasn't enough. He made me get a ruler from Sammy's backpack. It got so bad that I started screaming. That woke Sammy up. He made me put him back to sleep and when I came back, gave me round 2. A few days later, Sammy asked why his ruler was stained red. My dad looked at me and told him he had used it on one of the monsters." Dean only broke when he said the last sentence but Castiel had been crying silent tears throughout the entire story. Cas leaned back in and kissed Dean along the scar.
"You aren't telling me all this for my benefit, Dean. You are doing this for you. I'm here to listen. I'm here to help in whatever way you need." Castiel promised.
Castiel just sighed in response.
"Thanks, Gabe. I'm sorry to put this on you right after we got together."
"It was me. I was the monster." Dean said.
“How can you love me? I have betrayed you so many times. You are so beautiful, Dean Wincherster. Your soul is radiant. And I? I am a fallen angel of the lord. My father is meant to be the most merciful and loving person and even he can’t love me. And now? I don’t even have my grace. I’m useless.” It just clicked for Dean. Cas didn’t think little of Dean, he thought little of himself. Dean felt his heart shatter.
“Let me get this straight, you don’t like the way that Cas’ hair stylist is looking at his hair?”
in their bubble of bliss.
Sam's eyes finally landed on Gabriel. He looked at the archangel and pulled him into a hug.
They slipped the ring on and hurried to get back to the bunker. Before leaving, Cas turned around to see Gabe holding Sam’s phone and giving him a thumbs up. Cas smiled in response and let his fiance lead him back home.
Jack laughed to himself at the word courting. It brought up fond memories of Dean and him on that hunt. Jack knew things would never go back to the way they were, especially with Dean that's why he said he would be hands off. He couldn't afford to hurt the Winchester Brothers anymore. Fortunately, since defeating Chuck, Jack had better control over his powers. He was confident that he could help his father figure this time around. He tuned out the rest of Castiel and Gabriel's conversation. Despite being God, Jack found himself growing nervous. Sure, he had just seen Dean a couple days back but that was different. Jack was now going to see Dean as his son, not God. That brought a lot of anxiety.
"Which means that if Sammy goes down there..." Dean started.
"Goodbye, everyone, see you soon." Jack waved. He gave everyone a hug before warily heading off to his room.
Instead, he sat cross legged on the floor and pulled Cas into his arm. Dean hand went up and down Cas’ back soothing him. Cas couldn’t stop crying. He felt reality hit him. For the first time, he understood consequences of the deal he had made. He would have lost his family, his son, his best friend and the love of his eternal life.
"Yeah, Dad said he has to use it on monsters. I still can't figure out what monster can be defeated with a ruler." Sam responded, still confused. Realization dawned on Gabe and he held onto Sam's hand a bit tighter. His expression betrayed sympathy for the older Wincherster.
The couple jumped apart and Sam went over to give Jack a hug.
"No, I will not but it's good to see your sense of humor is back. I'm going to go make sure Sam is alright."
"No, yours just haven't been groomed yet." Castiel replied. He reached over and scratched Dean's new wings, instantly finding the perfect spot. Dean relaxed and leaned into the touch.
"How did I not know? How could you not tell me? I could have done something. I could have helped. I wouldn't have left you alone for 4 years." Gabriel stood behind Sam, rubbing his hand on his back in an attempt to sooth Sam.
"Sammy come back! We burned his bones for Jack's sake."
"I love you, Dean." Cas whispered with his lips hovering above Dean's.

"Where's Eileen?" Castiel asked.
"I'll only be gone for a week. I went up their last night to say goodbye and Jack needs me so I have to go back. I will come home soon. I promise."
Castiel simply nodded. He turned around and walked out.
"Dean, it's alright. Pain is a part of love. I left you after confessing my feelings for you and I am sure that was not a pleasant experience for you either." Dean wasn't ready for this conversation yet so he just nodded.
reciprocated with the same intensity.
"Yeah," Sam said again. He reached his hand out and put it on the gold door knob.
“It’s okay, kid. I’m alright.” he reassured his son. Jack nodded into Dean’s chest.
“Is he alight?” Sam asked.
"I love you." Dean said again, just as confidently as the last time. He watched Castiel carefully as Cas put the pieces together. He could pinpoint the exact moment realization hit Castiel because Cas let out a shaky breath and the water level in his sapphire blue eyes. Dean didn't give Cas a chance to respond as he leaned in to kiss him. This time, Castiel
They headed to Dean's room in the remake bunker for some well deserved rest.
"To take a shit on his grave" Sam called.
"How is she?" Dean asked, in a stained voice.
"She got an alert for a hunt so she left." Sam explained.
Sam looked at Gabriel, hoping he would make the same offer.
Dean found Castiel reading a random book.
"Oh, Dean, that just reminded me of something. We need to talk."
“Cas.” he whispered before he could stop himself. It was almost a prayer. No one could have heard it except for Cas. Castiel looked up and Dean saw his guarded expression. It was the stark opposite to when he last saw the angel. All Dean could think about was Cas’ teary eyes, faint smile and the radiant love that made his face glow.
“Alright.” Dean nodded in Sam’s direction but refused to take his eyes off Castiel. They walked out with Dean pulling Cas by the sleeves of his trench coat.
"I was making out with my girlfriend, not some random person I met an hour ago."
Cas pulled his phone out to check what would go with the furniture they were planning on buying. A couple minutes passed by and Cas felt someone grab onto his waist. Dean engulfed him into a hug from the back and gave Cas a soft kiss on the cheek.
"Oh, I think Dean still needs to rest so we'll probably just hang out here."
Sam was in the library trying to read up on a case but was losing focus. For Dean's sake, he pretended that everything was back to normal. Unfortunately, Dean had noticed that Sam's smiles had been more strained than usual and his bitch face had a twinge of sympathy to it. They had not talked about it in private yet since both the brothers wanted to take their time before approaching this topic.
"Gabriel, are you sure? I want to give you one last out." Sam asked, before they could begin.
“Do you, Castiel, take this man, to have and to hold, for better or for worse, to be your eternally wedded husband?”
"Dean?" Castiel said.
"Actually, you did die. You died and saw Jack. He decided to send you back here and rewind the timeline. He sent Cas back to heal you. We, then, got you to the bunker." Sam nearly yelled.
"Can someone explain what the hell is going on?" Gabriel interrupted the silent communication.
"3 days after mom died." Dean said, not meeting his brother's eyes. He held onto Cas' hand tighter, still not meeting anyone's gaze and Cas instinctively wrapped his other arm round Dean's shoulder, silently encouraging him to continue the difficult conversation.
"So what you are saying is that I should just be happy with my feelings for him? I shouldn't expect him to return them?" Sam asked after a moment.
"Who do you want to talk to that's in hell?" Gabe interrupted.
Gabriel sighed. He knew his brother was just trying to help but this wasn't a conversation he was ready for.
"No, you can but she just can't be your soulmate. You can love a lot of people but one one of them is a soulmate." Jack said.
Back in the map room, they all had their reunion hugs, the three men explained to Cas everything they had been through. Cas talked about how the empty had tortured him with memories of Dean.
"Are you sure? It looked like my brother."
"I don't know. He seemed distraught when I saw him yesterday. I think he was concerned for you and Sam. Your death really freaked him out."
“Fucking Gabriel!” Sam exclaimed.
"I love you too Dean, I love you and every scar on your body."
"Oh, nothing much, we just found that engaging in sexual activities makes it less painful to relive our most painful moments." Castiel said, feigning nonchalance.
I am back and I will have the last chapter updated by next week! Sorry for delaying this story so much. I just never want it to end.
"Right nailed. Like his insides go into a nail." The angel responded stupidly.
"Now that I have done your wings, can you help me with mine tonight? It would be good practice." Castiel said only to find his boyfriend softly snoring. Cas put a blanket around Dean and went out to the map table. He found Sam reading a book and drinking a beer. Cas sat down next to him and simply observed. Fifteen minutes passed and Sam still hadn't turned the page. His golden wings had materialized, they were going back and forth quickly, trying to match the pace of his thoughts.
Sam spent the rest of his evening trying to figure out what to do with his wings. Since wing grooming was an intimate activity, he was hesitant to ask Cas for help and just buried his head in books instead. He got through half of both wings but was struggling to reach the rest of them at this point. Jack had stopped by to make sure everything was going alright but left quickly. Dean and Cas started part 1 of their get sabriel together plan. Castiel suggested that Dean use angel radio to get Gabe back to the bunker. After much praying, Gabriel popped in with his shirt half buttoned and covered in lipstick stains.
The thought of dying without telling the people he cared about that he cared about them bothered Dean a lot more after Cas. He also knew that Sam needed closure. Dean would
"Oh yeah, totally. Most of the time he chooses to ignore it." Gabriel said. Sam turned bright red and made a mental note to NEVER say that again unless he was actually praying to Jack.
"We are trying to come up with a new plan for Sam and Dean." Gabriel responded. He looked up to see Castiel in the leather jacket.
"Easy, nothing a trip to a nude beach can't fix."
“Nothing much, Cas and I are just checking in.”
They spent the rest of the night talking about Dean's past scars. Dean told Cas a story, Cas told Dean what an amazing person he was, always contradicting John's harsh words. Castiel kissed the scar, wiping away the painful memory and replacing it with pure love. In between all of this, they had time to steel some intimate moments.
“I am fine, Jack. Dean saved me.” There was silence on the other end as Jack took in Cas’ presence. Sometimes they forgot that Jack was still a kid, an infant, infact.
“Fine, but if he dies on me again, I’m sending YOU to get him.” Dean said as he placed Cas back on his feet.
"YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH LUCIFER?" Gabriel exclaimed. Sam was taken by surprise as Dean collapsed on the floor laughing. Even Castiel was trying, and failing, to hold back a humorous smile.
Sam nodded and went back to his lunch. They chatted for half an hour or so, Gabe however, remained unusually silent. Afterwards, Jack was too exhausted. Doing this ritual twice in 12 hours was too much for him. He decided to head to bed but he promised the boys to check in once he woke up in the evening.
It didn’t take much. Well it took all of God’s power, but that really isn’t much of a hassle for the Winchesters. God is their son, after all. Jack waved his hand and created a portal to the Empty. After defeating Chuck, Jack came back to the bunker with them. Dean dragged him to the dungeon where Cas was taken and Jack opened the portal for Dean. Right now, Dean has two options, he could cry or he could be pissed. His emotionally constipated self chose to be pissed. He took a peek through the portal and saw darkness. Sam came back with a flashlight and Dean went in.
“Well, it changed mine to.” Dean put his hand in his jacket pocket. “When I tried to put a demon blade through you 13 years ago, I didn’t know how much you would change my life. I thought that it was just another case.” Cas chuckled gently.
"Are you sure? I don't think that's a good idea. You saw his personal hell today, why would you want sweet little Samuel to see any of that?" Rowena asked.
Sorry for the dumb dirty dancing joke. I thought of it months ago and finally found a spot for it. :)
"Yeah," he said, clearing his throat.
"Are you really mad at me about having the talk with Jack?" Dean asked.
"I love you." he said.
"He should really be asking his girlfriend for that." Gabe responded. Dean rolled his eyes.
After Dean fell asleep, Castiel went back to heaven. He needed to sort out all of his affairs before he could officially go back to Earth with Dean. Jack hadn't really given him much notice when he snapped them into the barn. Castiel knocked on Jack's door to say his final goodbye. It would be tough but knew his son could handle it.
"So? It's not like dad will say anything." Throughout the conversation, the couple leaned in closer and closer. Dean was resting his head on Castiel's chest, holding his waist tightly. Castiel had one of his hands around Dean's back, absentmindedly tracing the scars from memory over the flannel. Cas had tears running down his face but was still able to keep a steady voice.
“Hey, guys, Eileen’s in the area and she’ll pick me up from here. We’re going to dinner. You both go on without me.”
“That sounds intense. How did you get out of it?”
Jack pulled a small fraction of Dean's soul and spread the grace in the palm of his hand before rubbing it all over the soul like he was putting on sunscreen. It seemed to work as that portion of the soul glowed brighter. The light felt more pure, less hazy. Jack quickly poured the rest of the grace into the rest of the soul and reattached the other piece. Jack moved on to do the same to Castiel. He tested the waters with only his big toe and once he knew that the humanity was a good fit, he used the rest of it on Castiel as well.
"Castiel." Jack interrupted. "You should go. You and Dean have spent your entire lives sacrificing love for the world. If any one deserves happiness, it's the two of you. Although..."
“Castiel,” Cas met Dean’s eyes at the use of his full name. “You saved me and my brother more times than I could count. You fell for me.” Dean let out a slight chuckle at that pun before continuing. “You fell because of me. Anyone who isn’t completely taken with you is wrong. Human, angel or even demon, I will love you in any form. I do love you. Please don’t forget that.” Dean pulled Cas in for a head spinning, toe curling kiss.
“I do.” Dean smiled as Cas.
"Dean, we talked about this already."
"Stupid angel has to leave for stupid heaven right after he got back. Can't we ever catch a break?" Dean grumbled.
"So I want Sam to go see John Winchester." Gabriel proclaimed with the authority of the archangel he is. Sam whipped his head to face Gabriel with a shocked expression.
ohh! It's a cliffy! I'm so sorry, everyone. I promise it will get better in the next chapter!
"Sam, do you know what I saw in the Empty?" Gabriel asked. Sam shook his head. His muscles tightened at Gabriel's use of his real name. Sam knew that the Empty showed them their greatest regret but that was about it.
