Silence fell between them, both lost in their own thoughts, but Tony was sure Steve, like him, was thinking about meetings in a dark, thunderous library — but they were, once again, interrupted.
The ground here had become tough; wet and shot through with wheel tracks and shoe marks, it had hardened into ankle-breaking bumps during the cold night. People were crisscrossing in front of him from one building to another, and Steve found himself wondering if they knew, could they sense, what Steve had lost? As Steve crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; nobody was looking at him. The river and the mountains looked the same. Was it only
He stopped short and stared at Steve. Then he looked at Tony. Then back at Steve. Tony realized they must have been still radiating poorly concealed hostility, and probably looked as if they had engaged in a battle of words and Tony had come out on top — which he had.
“Clinical, calculating … ambitious. Now, one could have used all of those to describe Mr. Stark as well, but to me, they have a more severe sound to them when connected to Mr. Stane’s character. There was a kind of hunger in him that wasn’t there in Mr. Stark’s case,” Jarvis said, and shrugged. “I guess the difference comes from growing up poor rather than being born rich.”
“Family doctor in London confirmed it was to treat depression, though evidence suggest it was likelier used for boosting productivity. They do not, however, alter one's personality or distort one's perceptions of reality, they’re, in that sense at least, morally acceptable. Gimmicks of a high-speed, high-energy way of society.”
“We can’t punch our way out of this,” he said, reality closing upon him. “Not now when we’ve lost the element of surprise.”
Hands gripping both of Steve’s shoulders, Bucky pushed Steve an arm’s length from his darkening face. He glanced towards the entrance to check Clint was not returning yet, then said to Steve, “Clint, not unlike Natasha, would psychoanalyze
Wordlessly, Rogers exchanged his cup for the receiver. Tony rather thought he was being sneered at for abusing his station, but he did not much care for anything else but the fifteen minutes and then some that had already been spent eying the mulish set of lines on Roger’s face. As Tony pretended to inspect his fingers while listening in to the call, he found there was caked blood under a fingernail. He went to bite it off, then, upon reflection, aborted the order hastily.
Terror tore at Steve’s heart … he had to get back to the house and he had to talk to Tony … somehow this must have all been a big misunderstanding … he could reverse what had happened if they just talked things through … Tony could not be tired of him…
“Was I ever tempted to do him in, you mean? Wondering what I’d have loved to see more than witness that stiff upper lip wobble?”
“There, I worker right under the noses of people who should’ve for all intents and purposes considered me their superior. I kept thinking, if they did not believe, who would have, if I did run? But Obie had his ways to ensure I didn’t. He started offering me drinks to drown things, troubled thoughts, nightmares—and trust me, there was a never-ending well of them—but when it started, there was no stopping it. This was used against me. Relief for success, withhold for failure. Eventually, you just went with it.”
More leisurely in his approach, Tony skipped down the staircase, adjusting his suspenders, and was just about to contemplate on putting on something more appropriate than his shirtsleeves, when he rounded the corner — and found her licking the hands of Inspector Rogers, who was bent over her wiggling form, with his hat removed at entry. His hair had fallen down his forehead; pieces of it were standing up from static.
Steve found himself gaping at its knobby grey bark; there were no trees in this side of town. He looked up and saw a small foot hovering in the air. There, couple feet above him, was a boy hanging from the balcony rail above Joe’s porch.
“That, I don’t doubt.” Steve glanced at the fresh burn marks in Tony’s hands. “You work yourself too hard, though.”
Looking disgruntled, Tony, from his back pocket, took out an oily rag which he stuffed around the pendulum. On the next swing, it rang out a feeble, muffled
The driver, irritated by the delay and eager to catch up on lost time, was rather brusque with him as Steve engaged him into a conversation, while running level with the driver’s seat.
It was like an electric current had gone through Steve. He could feel Bruce’s eyes on him. Yet, he stared at the words,
As he strode through the tight passage between the stairs and the open doors, he was unable to help hearing a scrap of conversation happening behind the only closed door of the corridor. It was Mr. Stone’s angry, winded voice that said, “Then you won’t tell them?”
“What ‘what’? An informant,” said Bucky, impatiently. “Fury’s been sending letters all over the country for naught but—
Rogers glanced at him from his perusing of the trail, apparently alarmed at this new delighted air that had crept into Tony’s voice.
Then, skirting the Sheriff’s Office, familiar heelprints reappeared; now met by another line of feet, fairly close together and just as fresh. The incoming tracks separated soon but had come together from the direction of the forge.
[4] Am I churning historical AU after AU to hide the fact I'm not too savvy about modern tech lingo,which is, coincidentally, pretty essential to writing a character like Tony Stark?
Did I watch an entire 20min YouTube vid on how to drive a -38 Ford? Yes, yes I did. Did I actually find it fascinating? I will neither confirm nor deny that fact.
“God damn it,” Fury swore and shook his hand to snuff out the flames. “You feel this air, don’t you? We might be getting that rain faster than we thought. I ain’t—”
Assuming this had something to do with the door, Tony followed Rogers gloomily to the backdoor, feeling a strange awareness of his own casual clothing.
His pulse was still elevated by the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. Did they really think Steve did not know the man to whom he was married? It was not Clint who had sat down with Tony as he had broken down and confessed his past addiction, his past everything…
need you. You hear me? This is big. I can’t have you laying low when we’ve got to prove the boys in New York that Stark is still on top of the game.”
“Taken?” Steve asked him and was surprised his voice sounded so calm as he stepped back into the bedroom. “I don’t think so.”
Indeed, when Steve pulled back, there still was a visible lack of relief on Tony’s face, although a new, healthier flush had worked its way under the bruises on his cheeks and—
Tony got a sudden mental image of Jarvis mopping at his blood, and felt hilarity rise in his throat, born no doubt of the scotch he had consumed. A giggle escaped his lips.
Somewhere outside, thunder rumbled. The next flash of lightning, closer and reverberating, lit several rows of dark-spined books. The two outlines flickered and came back. Tony edged between shelves, listening. Who were they? What did they need to hide? Had some unknown force drawn Tony to this moment, or had the meeting been arranged after his arrival, precisely because he was there? In which case, did they know who killed Ty? Again, he strained his ears, trying to put meaning into broken words, to cut syllables, but he could not hear anything there. All the same, luck was on the men’s side in the form of thunder: now as a rising noise, earlier as a black out.
“I’ve advised your help to keep the room locked,” said Barnes, who had always been good at skating over uncomfortable talks, and handed the key of the room over to Tony. “Don’t open it — under any circumstances.”
Just as Fury was observing warily the muscle jumping at Steve’s jaw, footsteps echoed down the hall through the door Steve had left ajar, thinking this would have been over quick. Striding through it, appeared Coulson, Sam and Bucky, the latter two dressed for a fight and carrying enough gear for a week-long trip.
Rogers did not bother to make a note of this news, though he, rightfully, established Jarvis as the reliable source of all things Tony.
Steve reached the end of the page with a growing sense of dislike—of the sender taking for granted the cooperation of people, even when addressing their apparent reluctance himself. Yet other than his selfishness, he was at lost why Fury had kept it; there were a number of things that would alarm him, had buying and receiving rail bonds as bribes not been so common among the rich; and so, Steve was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself.
The town had changed. The piles of fresh produce displayed at storefronts, although naturally growing smaller by the season’s change, were now almost completely lost. Most of it had been cleaned out in panic and preserved, but others had frozen during a record-breaking frost a fortnight ago. A few windows were boarded up, including those of the hotel whose owners had not been able to afford continuing to pay rent to Pym, who owned half of the land the town was built on. The reduced sleeping accommodations had cut back on the number of overnight visitors.
Let's see how on time I'll be next week when we'll get to the REAL action. There might be another 10K+ chapter, depending how I want to break it up... ;)
Tony backed into Steve trying to escape his clutches; the saloon floor was now a sea of standing people waiting to be seated, all watching at the scene taking place that would determine their chosen table size. Thor was looking eagerly at Tony, potholders gripped in both large hands; Sam appeared to be fascinated by one of the arches; and Bucky was still blocking the door, as though showing he would bodily force the two of them to talk if need be.
“Anyway,” continued Clint, “Bucky said the kid reminds him of you, which, technically, would make you a big fat hypocrite.”
One of the Bills had been about to step off for refreshments, but at the sight of Steve, he leapt back to his partner and rejoined the dancing clowns, politicians, and celebrities.
“You’re a good man, Scott,” he said and, distantly, the sound of the chugging train was becoming louder. “But any man who travels with me calls me Steve.”
“I would love to hear what must be a well-rehearsed speech,” he said and, from his jacket pocket, took out a round object the size of a man’s fist.
A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Tony; he knew that they would not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, even Jarvis must have his doubts; must believe that, after the loss of both his parents, meeting the man who had once broken his heart had finally been the last nail of the coffin of his sanity. Even Tony himself was less and less sure as the time went on … as more and more black cars congregated below…
The man gave Tony a single blink so wide-eyed, Tony felt he had acted outside whatever parameters of interaction the man had assigned beforehand — Tony, most likely,
The dim memory of the dark room came to him … there had been embers in the heart … big shutters, wide open … and the banging window … unlatched. Tony felt as though ice had flooded his chest at the thought…
As badly as he must have hurt Tony, thought Steve, he would not expose Steve’s failures to his face. He was still looking out for him; just as he had done these past three years. Somehow the though brought Steve closer to tears than Tony’s confirmation. Instead, Steve straightened back on his feet, pulled his jacket on and left the house.
A man rose from within the witnesses for defense and ran out. Seconds later, the courtroom doors swung open and the accused took his seat before Steve, smelling strongly of something very bitter.
“I—I, well, I did!” told Everhart quickly.  “I saw him. But other than that, nothing. Tilly snores loud enough to mask a gunshot.”
Steve glanced at Tony; he could practically hear his brain whirring as he, unconsciously, was spinning around a necklace.
“I bet,” said Rogers and stooped to open the lock, thus hiding himself from Tony’s view, but he could have sworn, even in the dim light, there had been something akin to a smile playing at those lips.
Over at the belly of the overturned car, Stane went rigid. Although he was too far to see, the suspicion clouding his eyes was easy to read from his more secured grip on the bomb as his eyes roved over the seemingly unchanged expanse.
Jarvis sprang in, dressing gown crookedly knotted, and for one instant stopped dead, staring at the figures in the room — and then he cried out a reflexive, “Are you alright, sir?”
“Gone? What do you mean by ‘gone’? He wasn’t at the saloon? You don’t think something’s happened, do you? Have you found a note or something…?”
There was a wave of disappointment that swept through the Saloon; Steve suspected they had all assumed he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of dark creatures and a bad man.
“You know, I just can’t believe someone would survive all that,” Clint said, laid far back in his seat that was balanced on two legs, “and come out of it fine—even mentally so.”
Jarvis laboriously straightened as well, white at the lips and wiping his nose, quite dignified, on a handkerchief which he had fished from a pocket of his striped pants.
Rogers, thought Tony, and extracted his sweating cheek from what he now identified as a hot water bottle that must have once been filled with freezing water, but had since then cooled lukewarm. He rubbed the left side of his face, feeling an indentation where the neck of the bottle had left a crease.
“The bull and the heifer,” said Ms. Pym, whose horse was impatiently pawing the ground. “It’s been raining up in the hills. The clouds have been on our heels since we left the grounds. We followed the trail here.”
It was nearing midday and Steve was sitting alone in the Office, reading a long report that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He had slept badly that night. Trying to focus on the print on the page before him, his thoughts kept turning back to his dreams which had been full of faceless people set in a circle towering over Tony, shoving a picture of Steve onto his face and shouting, “You can do better! Remember who you are!”
“I wore it on a chain around my neck,” Tony spoke up and tugged down the collar of his hospital-issued shirt, “See these burns here? Funny, how metal conducts heat.”
“Let’s lock him up — just to be sure,” he said, his eyes gleaming with savage triumph. There was an indecent excitement in his voice, the same callous pleasure Tony had heard as he reminded Tony of the inquiry. “The pantry will do.”
, the blank slate. Et cetera, et cetera. Heck, maybe I should start making water cannons … do something good in the world for a change.”
Steve hadn’t thought Fury would pull through on his promise so quickly, but the next day, he found himself trudging up two flights of stairs to Fury’s office, wondering what he was about to walk into. A man had been killed. Was Fury really being paranoid? Couldn’t the man have been killed by chance? Who would have wanted Thaddeus Ross dead?
A sound broke his focus; a shift of sheets that had had him shooting out of the chair several times just for it to have been a false alarm. But, looking at the flutter of Tony’s bruised lid and the shift of his hands under the thin and rough sheet, Steve knew this would finally be it.
He then whipped his walking stick out of the Constable’s hands, turning the action into a fierce full stop, before ducking into a waiting car. His barking directions to his chauffer were cut off by the slam of the door.
He groaned, regretting the action as soon as pain shot up his throat from his bruised vocal chords. The pages stopped their riffling.
“Let me congratulate you on your restraint, then,” said Obie, picking up the glass, and attempted to balance it on the narrow music rack. “All five seconds of it.”
“No, Sheriff, not three weeks. It is actually fifteen days on average. Fifteen!” Strucker exclaimed and turned, arms splayed to the courtroom. “Imagine that.”
“I wish it was,” said Tony darkly. “At least then I could trust that somebody, somewhere, had a hold of the script.”
“That was rhetorical, just humour me. Can I have this?” said Tony and without waiting for permission made a grab at Obie’s snifter, holding it up by its round bowl. “’Cause technically, it’s mine … well, soon enough.”
It all happened very quickly; without further warning, there was a hand at the back of Tony’s neck; next, he found himself staring from close range at the chevron tweed of Roger’s trousers, the tips of his curls tickling against the buttons of his waistcoat. He smelled of wet wool.
“We’re not finished,” said Rogers to Tony, who had reached out his arm for the trembling receiver. “Do you keep guns in the house?”
… but what did it say? Who had sent it? And, each time he passed the sealed door, Tony could not help but wonder —
“Don’t feel bad about it,” Tony said hastily, stepping down from his physical high ground. “Look, I’m not the most open of all persons. That goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to …
He turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another sorry sight, hung on the wall: a decade-old portrait of his father wearing a smart pin-striped suit. An ornate cross-shaped medal for special services in the Great War was pinned to his lapel.
“Yes,” said Steve flatly while his mind had wandered long way from the Sheriff’s Office, back to the weeks spent in Sacramento. They seemed so far away; they had always felt too good to be true, like he had stolen them from a normal person’s life, someone who hadn’t fought a war and come out of it a different person, someone who could settle down…
There were hands lifting Steve’s blanket, creeping to his side, and from there they wandered south. Steve’s thigh twitched at the coldness of them; it was quite a trip from the forge to their house on a cold morning such as this.
Tony, indolently, waved him off. Dummy, stretching languidly, trotted off with Rogers, having apparently cottoned on to the concept of outdoors. As both pairs of steps retreated, echoing down the hall, Tony lingered by the ajar door, knowing Rogers would have to cross through the servants’ quarters on his way to the back.
Tony jumped, like spooked mouse himself, and listened to any further sounds from the locked drawing room above him. For one trembling second, he hesitated. Caution whispered: with the guns confiscated, going out to check was hardly a blueprint for survival. But curiosity, overwhelming curiosity, told him that he needed to see it himself. He set off in pursuit.
“You need medical attention,” Sam insisted but mechanically offered his hand for support and pulled Steve vertical again.
“Good talk,” said Tony, and in passing, tapped Steve’s chest with the back of his hand. Steve watched him all the way down the street, not moving, and only when he was out of sight, did he lift his free hand to trace the chaste touch, puzzled.
Here, he found his feet turning left, to the study, where he migrated as though in a daze to the desk and sat heavily down on the chair, the solicitor’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took
“If you have stopped killing off my cattle, yes, I will. There are ears everywhere on your way to west. Hence, you will pretend to be my cowhands acting on my behalf to check the condition of some cattle I’m going to buy from a man in Sacramento.”
Finally, she seemed to pause for breath, and Steve, who had stiffened at the mention of Tony, got a word in.
Sharon, then, got on her face an expression Steve had last seen on a darker-haired woman, who had called him
Then, already dreading the answer, Steve asked for possible psychological trauma, thinking of yesterday and how Tony had refused the glass of water.
“Only among the unsympathetic,” she said. “The day Tony returns will be a sad day for the rest of us … I should save you before they come back.”
“Remind me again why exactly you joined the army,” she answered coldly. “Tony’s still in danger from Stane, and he won’t be safe until Stane’s—”
“So, you’re going to, what? Check the engine, replace a couple seals? Sure, pop the hood, go right ahead.”
“Do you know where your husband is at the moment, Sheriff?” Fury barked, abandoning all pretense now. “Your deputies fed me some real thick horseshit about him visiting an ill aunt and that he would be back when she’s better.”
“It wasn’t easy, guiding you into the things I wanted you to do and away from the things that you truly were interested in. I had to hold you owing me your life over you far too many times for my liking. The border would have been very suspicious if our designs drastically changed. As long as I could chalk it up to the change in leadership, all would be well. And so, in silence, I could groom you into my very best weapon … if only you had not gotten away, this would have been mine sooner…”
Separated by a spot they had left for Natasha, Steve observed Tony surreptitiously whenever someone leaned over for another serving of pie. He was often quiet for a spell, then would laugh at a joke. Once, at a time like this, he met Steve’s eyes and lifted his brows upward; Steve watched him until he was lost to sight by Thor’s massive form and gazed into space until food arrived.
“Home,” Rogers said shortly. Then, when Tony looked at him in flat disbelief: “Too many people want you dead.”
Still unsure whether this was a very intricate dream or not, Steve started to slowly slide the ring where it belonged—past a new scar on Tony’s knuckle—sitting tight where it fit best.
Steve was just coming up with an excuse when the last note of the fiddle played, and the floor stilled and broke off in loud claps.
“Well, let me show you mine. I think you’ll like this, Anthony … oh, their faces when they saw it. My Sistine chapel, my Mona Lisa. Here, see? Take a good look!” he said, neck bent far to observe the fresco above. His glassed winked in the chandelier’s light when he turned to Tony expectantly. “What do you think?”
By then, the woman in red had been joined by Stern, who, with a rather enormous leap of liberty, brushed a hand across her back. She did not flinch; she had observed him, too, from the reflective surface of the French windows.
His burnt hand seared with pain; he had gripped the blade he had meant to shave with so tightly it had dug into his slowly healing palm. At this hiss, Bucky looked up. He was polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside the boot, the other blacking it. Muttering about seeing to a doctor, Steve set down the bloodstained blade and left the office.
“I know. No, seriously, man, I may not be a decorated war hero like you and your company, but there’s good and there’s evil. I want to be a part of the good.” He gestured at the tracks heading westward. “This is the road to my happy ever after. Isn’t yours?”
“Attempt at reaching behind the top edge that’s been most unadvisedly tipped out from the wall?” suggested Tony. “I should have a stool.”
“Frankly,” Sam started, “I don’t know what kind of help we should even expect but given recent developments, I would not be too astonished if it was revealed you have a warship tucked away somewhere around here.”
Although Steve held all legal papers in great value, there was precisely one person more committed than him. It had been like this from his very first meeting with Coulson twelve years prior when he had just been elected as Sheriff. He remembered it as though it had been yesterday.
“Oh,” said Tony, waiving a dismissive hand in the air, “I could have picked the lock, but you warned me to be on my best behaviour.”
Tony looked up to the coffered ceiling, the apricot-coloured pressed glass shade of the chandelier. Less than a week ago he had been standing in this exact spot of his childhood bedroom, waiting for the guests of the double-wake to fill the hall. It seemed like a lifetime away. What was he to do now? He stood, immobilized, by the door and he thought of his parents’ death, of the daunting, demanding legacy they had left behind … this house … Stark Industries…
There was a greedy glint to Strucker’s sharp eyes when he faced Steve again. Those who had looked excited were now starting to frown.
“He’s gone into shock!” Sam shouted. “We need a thicker coat.” He squatted in front of Steve. “Steve, can you hear me? Do you feel cold sweat?”
The world slowed to a crawl. Steve felt his muscles suddenly flood with energy, time unspooling around him as he braced his arm in a single, fluid motion and fired. One. Rumlow staggered backwards. Two. He dropped to his knees. Three. Eight men now laid on the ground on their feet. Reality burst back like a cold gust of wind and with it the sound of Sam yelling his name.
“Do we have to bring distrust and suspicion to this relationship?” asked Tony, who gestured at the space between them. “It’s a bit of a grey area, but yes.”
Clint was slouching on a leather chair beside Fury’s feet. Wearing clothing appropriate for a mission, with his precision rifle leaning on the armrest, he lifted a lazy hand in acknowledgment and smirked saucily at Steve.
“You’re not making a very splendid figure of yourself, but I’ll consider letting you sleep off your bad decisions, if you ask nice,” he went on, collapsing onto the carpet as well as the adrenaline leaked out of his body, leaving behind a feeling of fatigue and mild nausea. “We can amend the hostilities a little bit … I
“Only that Mr. Stark trusted him enough to name him as his successor if something was to happen to him.”
They had reached the landing now, where the corridor spread long and narrow into two directions, both lined with several bedrooms and studies. Tony’s room was third on the right, from which opened a view to the oval driveway.
But just as Stane’s eyes flashed in the darkness, Steve saw his mouth curl into a grimace; the gun fired, missing Steve by a mile, its sound echoing in the misty night for a long time while, with disbelieving frown Stane brought his hand to his pallid face that slowly contorted with betrayal at the sight of his singed palm.
No, the thing that was bothering Tony was that the last time he had been dealt like this, he had known who was behind it … but he was none the wiser, now … the idea that somebody he had looked into the eyes tonight had secretly been plotting another murder to frame Tony for, was alarming, unsettling…
The lack of text must have shown through the paper in the lighting, because Bruce straightened in his seat, craning his neck.
The next thing Tony felt was considerable pain on his cheek. Hammer Sr. had released him — the result was that his body had crumbled down, and when met with no resistance, by the feeling in his cheek, hit the floor headlong. He scampered up, holding his fevered-feeling throat; the musty air of the room felt cold flooding in his lungs again — and the uproar was loud and clear at last—
“How was your trip, gentlemen?” Pierce inquired, as he started to lead them past the queues. “Not too wearisome?”
Rogers leant back from where he had been poised forward, then hesitated. He picked a cup and stirred several lumps of sugar into his tea.
They had now come so close to where Steve was hidden by the theater, that he heard Tony’s whisper as he looked up at the lime-stoned face.
The room looked twice as secretive swimming in the shadows of twilight, but otherwise the office was as still and empty except for the people inside it. To the three’s credit, they all looked unruffled; wearing a mildly curious expression, Fury looked up from his paperwork as though having a deputy, a saloon owner, and an armed secretary in his building was a normal day’s work for him.
Steve’s vision blurred and stung. Therefore, the moment the pitch began anew took him by surprise. In just the same fashion it rose to an unbearable peak and then erupted with a tremendous hiss. The doors were blasted open.
The feeling of being caged intensified. Tony half wished he had listened to Obie … if this was how life was going to be for him in England from now on, maybe he would be better off in New York after all.
“That the coach drove over the explosive at the exact time of detonation … think about it, in order for the shaft to go through the carriage, it must have been set off just under the horses.”
“Sorry,” said Steve, not knowing what else to say. In answer, Tony made a nose on contempt; an expelling of air that vibrated his lips rather vulgarly.
for you to finally snap.” He gave a humorless laugh. “My biggest mistake, so far, was to forget you never quit. And yours was to think far too highly of me.”
Steve gave no credence to Bucky and Clint’s accusations, but he began to agree that Tony might be spinning out of control: in his shirtsleeves, Tony decidedly did not look right. He was, Steve knew, more intelligent and creative than any other man he had met, with potential to break new ground—but only if he didn’t break himself while reaching there.
“Mr. Pym,” said the woman, relieving Steve of the responsibility to make empty greetings, “your guests have arrived.”
“Me, too,” said Steve, walking back to Sam. Here, the beam of light travelled from wall to wall, illuminating the ceiling. And then it fell upon a bulb-less lamp.
“It was a long time ago. I cannot pretend it has not felt even longer. On that day, they—the whole family—attended a charity ball for Free Hospital. I watched them leave from the front door. Curious,” he said, “how to this day I still remember how they were dressed, how I promised I would have supper ready by eight. They always ate at eight, even if sometimes separately. Still … they never came back. After they had left, a kitchen maid from across the street came running while I was polishing the dinnerware. The way the girl rattled the door I thought—” There was a tremble to his hands that had little to do with his age. “There had been an explosion.”
“Thank you,” said Jarvis softly when he accepted the frame, holding it like it was made of the most delicate glass. “It’s the mouth. I could always tell a Stark by his mouth, so very severely set lips.”
He rose up again, this time to remove the velvet curtains hiding a patinated frame, and eyed avidly the rather racy picture of a naked man revealed beneath.
“Ah, seems like a full house tonight,” said Fury, as the heavy packs hit the floor. And then addressed Coulson: “Did you bring it?”
“Yeah, done deal. They need you here to run the place, I understand, believe it or not. They need a man in charge, and that’s you.” Tony smiled hollowly. “It’s always been you.”
“You’re deaf but you’re talking loud,” Tony said snidely. “For your information, violence and engineering are known to be bad bedfellows.”
“Get some sleep while you can,” he murmured quietly. “Don’t want to let things like guilt keep you up.”
“I would embrace you,” said he, softly, “but I’m afraid I no longer have the strength to get out of this bed.”
Tony kneaded his throat with his knuckles; he winced — and, with a shock, found them at the end of the driveway. The undeviating wall of night had failed to convey the changing of scenery.
“Do not pity me in vain,” rasped Jarvis after a beat and peered up at Steve shortsightedly. “I know my days are counted. I only wish to live long enough to see Anthony one more time.”
Apart from the noise of the yielding suspension as they got out of the car, the silence prevailed; this was for the best, really, since Tony was so tired and Rogers so very unexpectedly attentive as he escorted Tony to the door, that God only knew what he may have uttered …
“I’m just borrowing it,” Clint told him. “Fury likes his news printed in Washington D. C. He buys them through mail and picks them up from the stagecoach stopover at Sokovia.”
“Well,” said Sam uncomfortably. “We don’t exactly know … Natasha said he closed the forge shortly after sunset.”
A thick silence swelled, save for the intermittent soft whine and groan of the engine; Tony, arm resting on the door, drummed his fingers on it and watched the headlights reflect off the wet dirt. Every time Steve reached over for the gear by Tony’s right knee, their arms brushed.
“Ah, the man of the hour,” Tony said, as Jarvis pushed in, hands bearing a tray of ill-sorted cups. Tony could not help noticing he was not very taken by the disarray that had fallen over the house, given his disgruntled air over the misfit tea-things.
He mustn’t have been as confident in the future of Stark as he had let on early this morning, thought Tony.
“Yes, yes, it is,” said Stern, now with palpable silkiness in his tone. “I have my fingers crossed for Wilful Murder, and if the Coroner’s country jury does not wish to take that responsibility, I will personally see to taking the matter higher.”
Tony, even thought there was nothing hilarious about the situation, snickered. For a while it seemed to be the only sound in the room; he could not hear movement upstairs, though he imagined several parties involved had stayed behind, walking room to room to tell them what had happened, what they believed had happened, what they
Sharon’s brown eyes looked very anxious under her glittering mask. “Because I don’t believe he did what they claim he did.”
And distantly, somewhere beyond the boom of the machinery, echoed the deep, bass sound of an explosion.
When he finally got enough air to squeeze the word out, they appeared in such a quiet voice that Tony could have pretended not to hear them over the sound of rain lashing against the windows. He didn’t. Tony held his eye contact firmly, eyes illuminated by the grey day, and nodded.
.” Hammer’s voice changed. “Are you listening? You seem a little distracted. I feel like I’m talking to a wall.”
“I should not think the death of a child is less important than the misdoings of that insufferable man,” said Jarvis, with dignity. “It is exactly because of men like you that nine-year-old boy died. Work … always work. Should have left the gentlemen’s club early once in a while … got to know his own son. If Howard Stark had listened to me that day—if he had not taken his son with him, to bore him to d-d-death at a ball …”
As Rhodey fired up, starting to pace, Tony thought of Steve, of Steve surrounding himself with the paltry necessities of a working-class man and living in them like an ascetic. It was beyond Tony why anyone thought they were fucking; no one who knew Steve would think of him as the amorous sort. Tony looked across at Steve. As he watched, Steve scratched the back of his head with a fountain pen. This disrupted his carefully combed down hair, causing it to stick up as though someone had run their hand through it, or gripped it, hard.
The honest answer was that Steve was particularly aware and illogically suspicious of anything and everything this morning due to certain circumstances he did not wish to disclose. Sam, however, seemed to gather the worst from his face.
“Stane certainly keeps an eye on everything that goes on,” Bucky observed, not favorably, from the side of the shelving of patent drawings and folders. “Sector one … four … nine. Up to twenty! We’re going to be here for ages.”
“What about his background?” Steve felt Bucky scoot forward in his seat as he inquired, “Do you remember anything unusual?”
Outside, Roger’s car stood in wait; the pressed leather of Tony’s oxfords soaked on a black, invisible puddle while he was busy holding his ruined tuxedo overhead in some parody of umbrella. He couldn’t stop looking at Rogers. He had a hundred questions. Why was he alone? What now? Charges? How bad would his judgement be once the car door slammed shut behind them? Was he angry?
But then, when Tony opened the door, ready to tiptoe upstairs past Jarvis, Rogers shut the door after him, leaving the two of them standing in the dim entry, alone.
“Fine, Fury visited this morning. The old snoop had a lot of question. Too many. Remind me to change the locks.” Tony shoved his hands into his pockets and swayed on his feet. “I’ve made a ton of new things after the last mailing of spare parts. I invented this new type of textile … I made a … I made a phonograph, for recording sound…”
“I—um,” Tony said, and rubbed his temple. “What was I saying? Can you give me a second, this … it’s like Chinese water torture. I’m trying to—”
to the floor, yet it had rolled like tumbleweed in a breeze. There was a faint ringing sensation rising in his ears, and it was not because of the noise.
They were over the root of the mountains, they had passed the first summit through a tunnel; Steve could see several more clouded peaks up front as they zigzagged westward to find the smoothest ascent, so slowly that as the daylight began to fail, Steve felt anxiety starting to scrawl upon his skin like a horde of bugs.
Steve knew at once, from the way Tony ripped open the front door and strode inside, that he had made a terrible mistake in saying this. Tony had now reached the dining room table and stood there, facing the bedroom door with stiffly set shoulders.
“As I recall, he became wealthy in the gold rush of 1849. I rather think he later came to regret being so frank about his origins in the thrill of making friends in what some call the higher society. He was an orphan—cholera, I presume. He could have used motherly influence, though. He was ruthless—a good business sense—but ruthless. Money just found its way to him.”
Steve thought back to the twin-tracks separating in front of the Office and replied, “Just a hunch. I’ll come back to you once one of them shadows us to the outhouse.”
he said. “Did you know the prototype for Starling was drawn at the back of a napkin while piss-drunk on a charity dinner? No, and you know why? Because I covered it up. The night he refused to aid Confederates … that was when I was most afraid he would bring down the whole company. Good old Howard, a decent person but a poor businessman. Adults are so much harder to manipulate, I had to change for a younger partner—”
Tony watched, feeling rather vindicated, as Rogers leaned over his desk to drop the receiver back onto the switchhook.
Steve’s insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell Jarvis the truth. He pretended to dust off invisible dirt off his pants to avoid answering.
Steve could see it happening again. He watched a horse-drawn carriage bobbing along a street on its spindly wheels, closing in on the soon-to-be ignited charge laying on the street in daylight … but there, Steve’s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how the timing could have possibly worked.
Dummy changed position, then; she rose, walked three steps and laid back down with a thump, her head resting on one outstretched paw.
A vivid image of a smugly smiling Pym arranging a marriage for his daughter now that the rival was out of the picture flashed into Steve’s head. “I bet,” he said.
“I got a week’s leave,” said Rhodey, chest vibrating. “I couldn’t leave you by yourself, Tones. I’m sorry I missed the … last weeks.”
They walked out into the corridor, followed along it to the exposed railing that opened a view to downstairs where what seemed to be the whole town had gathered. At the sight of them, their noise filled the room all the way to the rafters. Trading looks, Tony and Steve descended the stairs.
Steve, who knew his last chance had just been used, pulled back his arm and flung the scalding-hot instrument; it sailed through air, straight, no spin and all too fast, not allowing Steve the luxury to second guess before it reached ground.
“I housed him for a month or so,” Bruce continued. “Not every night, just sometimes. The walk is a bit shorted here.”
For a second that contained an all eternity, Steve stared, uncomprehending, at the patch of stones where Tony’s body laid.
Natasha had gotten there. She had lost her hat, and her red hair swung loose as she tugged a ribbon free, tied it around a man’s neck and, using this as leverage, kicked off the ground. Two men were laid out on the cobblestones before her legs met the cobble again.
The crowd surged upon them like a tidal wave as soon as they reached the bottom step. Their questions created a chaotic bubbling of sounds—
Fury combed every inch of his safe for over ten minutes, but was forced, finally, to conclude that the rest of the letter was gone. Given how upset as he was, Steve got the feeling it would have contained something much more valuable than the first page, and the only potentially useful clue he could see was the identity of the worker.
“Earlier this morning, you see, we shook hands to close a spectacular deal under the nose of a rival, naming no names.”
“Postponed,” said the voice of Rogers, “due to new evidence. And to two of the witnesses fleeing to their townhouse in Mayfair. They declared the country air to be bad for their health.”
“You may have once thought so, sir. It’s Mr. Stone Junior. He’s been flicking pebbles at your window.”
And Steve, having been constantly, painfully, on the alert for any indication that someone else was about to tell him they had had enough, that they wished for
“Wait,” Tony said and passed Steve, who had frozen still, a folded piece of thick letter paper. “Can you give this to Fury.”
Tony had run to him and set his cup down on the hardwood floor with a thud; he must have seen, too, that the most colorful thing on Jarvis’ face remained a liver spot. But as he gazed upon Tony for the first time in almost two decades, Steve got the feeling life had been breathed into the old man.
“You won’t kill me, Tony,” growled Stane, couching and spitting blood between words. “Your heart is too
“No, it isn’t, but I’ll do you one better.” Bucky pointed to the general direction of the cell door. “A goddamn smoking bridge.”
“You yourself did not happen to notice, miss, when you later ran out of the rooms towards the noise in the hall, whether it had been used or left ajar at all?”
Around the table, Steve met the looks of his friends, ranging from amused to knowing. Again, his conscience squirmed.
Then, after several solid minutes, during which Tony had admired the light falling on Steve’s golden-brown brows, a knock came on the class.
“We’ve got this,” said Sam, giving Steve’s shoulder two strong pats. “Go get your boy. We’ll cover your six.”
But then, his hair stood up: in the black, glossy pane, something had caught his attention … something that should not be there, behind him in the room…
“Staying the night,” said Rogers, setting his wet hat onto the console by the door. “If you don’t mind.”
At this moment, Tony’s eyes met Steve’s, and several things happened at once: Tony seized Stane’s arm, suddenly dexterous, and slew of bullets descended on Steve and Bucky. He saw it, a flicker of an aiming arm, out of the corner of his eye and surprise paralyzed him for a second too long; the first bullet missed him by an inch—then a second gunshot sounded, met by Bucky’s fire; and a man fell forward onto the pavement from his hide behind the pillar of the theater.
“We had the artist smuggled in from Florence. They’re not known just for the lilies. Lovely, isn’t it?” Hammer said, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Tony gazing around, transfixed. “But I can tell you’re not here for the blow by blow. See the
By sunbreak next morning, they waded through the freezing cold river on horseback. Their steeds stirred the clay at its bottom, turning the water grey in their wake. Once on the opposite bank, they followed the river upstream through patches of snow, their horses occasionally missing their footing on a hard, frozen tuft of grass. The hills swelled gradually on their right and left, their path carrying them along a valley in between, on a path of impacted desert floor.
Steve complied and the others follow, shooting glances at Steve, who heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Bucky had been pushed to the wall by force.
“Hey, hey, hey.” It was Justin Hammer, who had just risen from an empire style settee. “What’s with the gatekeeping? Come on, Anthony, step in, step in. Grab another drink. The more the merrier, am I right?”
“Steve,” Sam said on the third day, “you’re running yourself ragged. I’m worried about you—we’re worried about you.”
It was easy, once in the shadows of the building, to retrieve their weapons from the pommel bags and from between the folds of their rolled blankets, for the fog had thickened. Steve stared at his own roll, and the army suit from within. Perhaps Stane the kind of man he would rather kill in uniform instead of scrubby jeans … or perhaps the button-spangled front would glint even though the mist … but Steve threw it on anyway, for, after the sweltering heat of the factory, the evening outside felt cold on his skin.
Down in the grounds, a stretcher bearing a white sheet exited the house and was loaded into the back of the white van. It soon tore off down the lane, disappearing from sight behind the oaks but not before swerving around another black car, which pulled up into the van’s vacated spot. Two men climbed out of it, eyeing the house. Their gazes swept over the windows, and although they could not have seen Tony, he found himself retreating several steps.
Tony let himself be pulled into a crushing one-armed hug. He felt some of his ever-present tension leak, breathing Rhodey in.
They had just taken the first steps up the stairs at the end of the corridor when Pierce stopped them.
Rogers looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He made a quick flash of a mark in his booklet, looking satisfied; Jarvis, on the other hand, appeared deeply troubled.
Fury lit a match, bringing it to the cigarette butt inside his cupped hand. This cast ominous shadows upon his eyepatch, causing the surrounding scars to seem even deeper. The flame flickered; almost dying out.
“Your father was one of the wisest men I’d ever known,” he sighed. “In private life, as well as business. I’ve seen the will, Tony. Stark is yours. Howard would not have left it to you, if he did not believe you capable.”
“It, amazingly, seems that a lost vase was the only thing amiss in the room. No prints, other than a shoe mark on the lawn below the open window — which, oddly enough, did not match Mr. Stone’s shoes. Moreover, Jarvis had lit a fire before closing the room, which delayed—”
Steve skidded to a stop and stared at the mouth of a rifle. On the other end, was Ms. Hill, who lowered her weapon, once she identified the disturbance.
“The only reason I haven’t packed my bags already is because I’ve been too scared to leave you alone,” he said firmly.
“You know I’m not actually a drunk, right? Didn’t exactly fit my modus operandi despite my laundry list of past vices. In fact,” he said, “when the first letter came, when I was planning on my own death, I spent hours thinking how to do it convincingly. Drowning, wash away my body? Too risky. Fire, obviously, would leave the least evidence. But then … I imagined you in that plot. The grief on your face, volunteering to carry my, supposed, body to its last resting place…
“And speaking of Coulson,” said Natasha, turning to Steve. “Have you dropped by his place recently? I forgot to tell you: Phil wants to see you.”
For several minutes, he sat and watched his father looking sternly upon the room. He felt much calmer, somehow, now that it was all official. And although the things he had pushed back to a ‘later time’ still felt insurmountable, knowing he had Obie there to guide him, soothed him. Tony looked at the desk. By each knee, there were four drawers, most of which he had already gone through, except for the last, locked one. He was gazing at it, remembering how a key had been handed to him, when he caught his father’s eyes again and walked to the portrait.
Toomes swiftly wet his lips as all their gazes fell on his feet, looking upon the hobnailed, muddy but unremarkable boots.
Steve had a sudden and vivid mental image of a one-eyed, bald baby drooling on the knee of a greying gentleman, listening to stories of distrust and crime.
“Could you please not judge me for five seconds?” Tony massaged at his eyes, pressing on them until he saw spots, and went on bitingly, “How do you
And then the newly found well of astounding discoveries threw them another bucketful, and excitement rose inside Steve so quickly that he almost kicked Sam’s chair leg.
might be Stane, and they were on the right track. Then they heard movement from the street to their left. Steve had his gun aimed at the disturbance before he realized, in the ambient light of the lamps, that his weapon was aimed at Scott and Sam, who looked vexed. Scott was massaging his shoulder.
What he did not see, however, was the start of a sedate drip, then a trickle that pooled around the metallic stem. Progressively, it grew into a rivulet that spilled from groove to groove, cobble to cobble, all the way down to the car, spreading wet underneath Stane’s feet, firmly planted on the tracks—
Steve glanced at the lone, barred window. The daylight streaming in was starting to dim; dinner time must have ended—and as if to prove a point, Bucky’s stomach growled loudly. They quieted.
In answer, Tony looked about as exhausted as Steve had felt for weeks. Then, slowly, he started to drum his fingers on his chest. Funny, Steve thought, how his scar was under that exact spot. He remembered Bruce discussing a medical condition called phantom pain—was this it?
They were truly home now: only a hundred miles laid between them and their house, and that distance now sounded merely a fraction of what it had been a week ago. Steve looked at Tony and saw this realization in his eyes, too.
“If I’m right,” said Natasha from under the belly of the plane, “the guns are synchronized with the rotation of the propeller. This will change war. For good.”
Tony’s heartbeat was racing, as if he had been sprinting. He sat quite still, though, holding the unexpected paper in his clenched hands while inside of him a kind of silent eruption sent confusion and disappointment in consecutive waves through his body. Slumping deeper into the tufted chair, he reread the words scrawled across it, apparently, at random:
Steve thundered past the houses, running the length of the main street and skidded to a halt in front of the burning building. It looked deceivingly calm up front, but from the cracks of the barn-like double doors, smoke was trickling out and billowing about the slanted roof. Steve took off his jacket and pressed it to his nose.
“So, what? Stane’s on threat watch just because of a letter?” asked Sam, sounding highly skeptical. “And guesswork?”
Tony’s mouth worked for several moments as he tried to form into words his current thought process. Eventually, he settled for a thoroughly exasperated expression.
“Well,” he said, “while I liked the analogy of this … iron man to the heroes of medieval Europe, strictly speaking it was simply highly pressurized steam from a hydro-pneumatic, er …” He caught Coulson’s eye and the glazed looks of his audience. “What I meant to say was that the rumors are highly exaggerated. A fairytale-like creature appearing just in the nick of time to save the world is hardly what actually went down. You see, what really happened—what really took place is that…”
“I thought about telling you then … but … everything went pear-shaped.” Bruce looked equally sheepish from what Steve saw from between his errant strands. “Sorry.”
“Some of us are doomed to repeat history,” he said stiffly. “If you didn’t know what you signed up for, you shouldn’t have married me.”
“Drinking isn’t a crime, Sheriff,” he said coldly, slammed his cup onto the trestle table, and stepped onto one of their dining chairs in front of their fireplace to rise face to face with their grandfather clock. Around the chair, small mechanical parts still littered the floor from an old project Steve had loath to remove, should it discourage Tony to come over less.
The man closest to him crouched down to Tony’s eyelevel. Tony, through the blurry gap of his undone curls, saw a face covered in receding grey hair and sparse-haired, pale brows on either side of a severe frown line. Stern smelled as he had done at the corridor: of martinis, strong cologne and sweat.
Steve glanced around at them all; they had their own shabby jackets on and looked firmly determined by the shadow of the platform. He looked again at Scott and grabbed him by his sleeve. He pulled him aside.
With no bridge construction underway, Steve and a handful of others swum to meet it at the opposite bank, tied two tree trunk logs to its wheels and floated it across the river, where the horses sprung up the steep rise from the water in long leaps, breeching and straps clinking and groaning. Steve, wet from his head to his toes, took only time to pour the freezing water off his boots, before breaking into a jog after the stage, which was heading to the Mail Office.
Here, he lifted his hands, trailing them up the gilded frame and, once he had a good, strong grip of it, lifted it off its hook, behind of which emerged a metal façade. He brought the key in his hands, which were now sweating mildly, to the keyhole.
“Here’s your chance,” called out a distastefully familiar voice from the dark corner, “to surrender before we have to do things the hard way.”
On his right and left, open doors created pools of daylight onto the carpet he was walking on. Tony remembered the duster in Jarvis’ hand. He must be airing out the bedrooms. Tony’s gaze wandered to the door, behind of which his parents had slept, but it was closed, showing nothing but a stretch of dark wood.
“Tony, no,” she protested, causing him to twirl swiftly around. He pointed at her from atop the stool.
Tony must have known they would come to save him…and they had wasted so much time… For how long had he had to buy time? How long had he had to pretend to be stalled by something and what had it cost him? Had he worried Steve would never come?
Tony opened his eyes and looked out of the window, head lolling slightly as the train curved. The slowly-moving, snowy landscape reflected off his eyes.
“Well,” said Rhodey, with a meaningful eye cast towards Steve, “reel your line in. The fish’s got their priorities set straighter than you.”
“Just a couple gold pieces from an outlaw, who had stolen them from an old black man,” she said, wearing an impressed smile. “He gave them back.”
Hodge had swallowed a considerable amount of beer in shock. He stood up, teary eyed, and saw the muscle jumping in Steve’s clenched jaw. The quiet one collected himself from where he had awkwardly half-collapsed between counter and seat. Then Steve moved his right arm and reached into his pocket. The two men jumped and were out of the door by the time Steve came out with a dollar bill he slapped onto the counter.
“My own design,” Stane said, and it was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Stane had dropped the insults. “I had hoped it wouldn’t come to this. You see, once rigged, this is going to blow in thirty seconds. You shoot me, I’ll still have time to pull this little cap off. One, small move—” he demonstrated this act “—and what happened in Manhattan will look like a dud in comparison.”
Steve stared at him; he could not understand why they were all looking at him as though he was unreasonable. It looked for a moment like Bucky was gearing up for a lecture but whatever flood was going to burst through his thinly pressed lips, was detained by a couching fit from the cot.
“I don’t like the idea of him laying low,” said Steve, frowning. “It’s like he’s gathering his strength for something.”
“Found about that, too, huh? The news that the war had ended reached me quickly. I sensed a chance. That’s when I waned myself from the drink. Eventually, I could go days without needing it. I stated to plan. The day Lincoln was killed was not the plan but that’s why it worked so perfectly. Between the stocks dropping and people mourning, no one quite had a hold of things—or me. So I just … walked out of there and—” he paused “—disappeared.”
Tony forced down his frustration, reminded himself that Rogers was in possession of a coveted title at such a young age, and that therefore his,
They were blocking the doorway; Tony realized this as an elderly lady hovered by the register, wary of passing the two of them at the mouth of the entry.
Next, a door slammed. Up at the ceiling, below a magnificent fresco, a chandelier shook and winked at them. Out of the door in the middle of the hallway had come a woman, now striding fast towards them, and Steve saw with a start that it was Ms. Hope Pym.
“Behind the church, didn’t I tell you I saw some battered cans there? I thought it was you. The tin was bent like butter, hard to tell the caliber from the size of the holes. Now that I think about it, it didn’t match any of Tony’s, either.”
“You’re not in America anymore, Mr. Stark,” he said dangerously. “You might be man of the world, but you should not let wealth lull you into a feeling of false immunity.”
Fury took the paper from Steve’s hands. “Stark Industries. This,” he said, “is Obadiah Stane’s mail.”
Steve edged them behind the yellow junction house and into the shadow of a water tower, where he started again.
The observation felt as though it had rubbed salt into a wound Tony had not known existed; however, Tony rallied quickly.
No one had raised a fist: there was only Rhodey, standing there with a lily held courteously in his hand, looking down at the engraved name of Tony’s father on the flat rock. His eyes were no longer disappointed, but their normal brown; they were also wet.
Tony, starting to feel he was in control of his life for the first time in weeks, felt an impish smirk pull at his cheeks as he vowed, “Say no more.”
“I don’t. It’s a miracle how leisure and compelling circumstances chances one’s habits. And speaking of leisure,” he said, shooting Steve a calculated look. “Done testing whether my guns match the grooves of the bullet? Fool’s work, really. I would have had the right one discarded.”
He no longer found use for furtiveness; he dashed down the steps and let the carpet-muffled echo of it scare off the vandal downstairs, where, he was sure, the person was now standing frozen, aware that someone in the house was awake. This gave Tony the needed courage to skip over the last three steps, and witnessed the drawing room door loom out of the dark wall ahead.
Toomes, starting to twist his wool cap in his mouldy hands, said, “The — trimming the chestnut, sir. The east-facing branches almost reach the mausoleum roof. Terrible racket during the windy days.”
Below him came the noise of the large, wooden shutters in the drawing room being opened at last. No one had touched the room since Tony had left it to the care of Jarvis, who he could still hear talking to the Constable guarding the door of the room.
“I think,” he replied slowly, “that if a man like Obadiah Stane threatened me, I would comply with just about anything.”
He tried to recall what he had seen on the night of the murder. It was all in rapid flashes … there had been the noise, and the window … he concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember…
“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you,” he said finally, picking up a winding key and a knife from the mantelpiece.
But it was as though a breeze had snuffed all the figurative candles: all Steve’s relief, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness as the glorious flush of reunion broke.
When at last they reached the forge, Tony took his key to the lock, shouldered the wide doors open and slipped inside into the unlit room. And just a moment later, he came out with a bundle of familiar fabric. Steve’s face fell. He, who from Tony’s serious expression had expected something much more serious than this, stared down at the fabric in bafflement.
He did pretty well in getting the words out, all things considered. Behind him, Stern’s red face was bordering on purple. Hammer, with real pleasure, tugged Tony, whose drink sloshed, into the room.
Silence fell between them and Tony wished there was something other than four bare walls to use to catch his friend’s attention with. Rhodey glanced towards him and Tony thought he saw a trace of disappointment in his eyes.
Peter lifted up his mask to slip the unwrapped jellybean into his mouth. With hasty thanks, he picked up the branch and hurried off, without giving Steve any time to offer fatherly words of advice, though admittedly he could not think of any. Instead, Steve turned to Clint with a look of wintry disapproval.
bellowed Hammer Sr. and clambered up; Tony was abruptly lifted by his lapels and pushed against the shelf. Books toppled to the ground. Tony heard seams ripping as his clothes slid higher up his body and took the brunt of his weight.
“Always thought there was something fishy about that fella,” said the shorter of the men, well into his bottle of beer. “Invited him to poker once, for the fourth time maybe, said he didn’t have the money. Eh? Now, where would he get clothes like that from?”
“Are we?” asked Rhodey and looked over his shoulder to where Howard rested. “You don’t talk about this. Not about
They searched the place and found nothing. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside Steve; he marched back into the bedroom, but right at the door, he heard Bucky gasp in a breath so suddenly, Steve felt his stomach perform a complicated backflip; he spun back, half expecting to see a note nailed to a wall, but again there was nothing there.
Tony tore his gaze away only after Rogers had rounded the westernmost side of the house, out of sight.
Tony hesitated, thinking … and then resumed his retreat back to his car. However, he kept his eyes on the back of the distancing vehicle, wondering … it just did not seem in character, somehow, for correct, magistrate Mr. Stone to be taking matters to his own hands like this…
“Not when someone’s trying to prompt us into a suicide mission in the middle of the most flammable factory in the world,” said Bucky in a mocking tone.
“Should we wait for another train?” suggested Scott as though this was all a rather interesting day trip; Steve wished he would show a little more investment. There were bigger things at stake than a dame.
Inspector Rogers’ head shot up. As he righted himself, his shoulders swayed as though he had taken a bracing inhale in the face of Tony’s free-spoken approach.
Along with Tony, dreams of doing something other had left him weeks ago. It had always been something he had thought about doing
“Really, Tony. There’s nothing wrong with the inn. At least there I’ll receive only what I paid for—” He spoke louder, then, over Tony’s protests “—and you heard her! The man’s about to break his back. We barely got him to come down from the stepladder and at his age—”
“Out in the open?” Tony asked, sounding casual. “You aren’t gonna put one of your lackeys on it like for poor Mr. Ross? You always
The rag was shaken loose and the tic-toc started anew. Tony slid down from the table and placed a hand onto the meaty part of Steve’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze. With his eyes firmly on the walls, Tony said, “It’s not your fault.”
Their bridge—wooden, slightly green from years of grime, and leaning slightly to the left because of a stiff winter eight years previously—was on fire.
“A bit too keen, I’m afraid. The detectives did not seem to put much weight on it … and this young, striking sort of chap, Rogers was his name, did not seem to me as a person easily fooled.”
“Subtlety seems superfluous when they already know we’re here,” remarked Bucky, who had been silently standing behind Sam so far.
“It’s a defense mechanism,” said the doctor before he left. “His mind tries to regulate his life again in the ways he can control. It will be fine once he regains normalcy.”
Given how bare his office was, though, Steve had no doubt he had been untruthful. Who was Fury corresponding with that he did not want others to know about? What did a mayor, whose priority was evidently not the wellbeing of their town, do?
Jarvis blinked. “You—you’re not familiar with this? Ah, well, I suppose it only haunts the partial.”
Tony, regaining his balance from the recoil, shook his hand stiffly with a grimace and turned to them.
“James!” Sam called, turning around. “Where are you, man? Did you see that? With one blow, not bad, eh?”
