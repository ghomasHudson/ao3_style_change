'Why should I?' He'd texted back with stiff fingers. There wasn't any real heat in the words, though he didn't need Sherlock to know that. Not that emotion through text ever translated well. But it would do the great git some good to think he was still upset.
He was here again, much to John's relief.
The steps are red and the steps are marble and their loud foot falls echo mismatchedly through the cold stone room. Like their heartbeats. One achase. The other chased. Predator and prey.
The exchange of trousers wasn't that bad. He had nice legs and didn't hold his horrors there. It was finding himself with all his buttons undone and the placket of his shirt held together in his hands that was the problem. Trying to desperately squash the hot flood of warring emotions pinballing through him. Embarrassment. Shame. Terror. Excitement.
There was the ubiquitous flashing of cameras, the murmur of news reporters offscreen, and the buzz of traffic beneath it all.
"But that's my room." Sherlock said, not quit understanding. Left standing crooked and shirtless in the man's furious wake.
Looking up in surprise, she gave John a close-lipped smile that made her cheeks dimple in a lovely way before it was scared straight off her face.
"Why, my Prince. To keep you pure." Charles had answered. "Now lie back for me. That's a good boy."
John was in front of Sherlock the moment he stepped out from behind the screen. John reached out, wanting to take him in his arms, but at the last moment stopped short and kept his hands hovering just above his skin. He was afraid to touch him, afraid that the burning tears that were sucking at the backs of his eyes might come to the forefront and he may make a fool of himself.
The afternoon progressed somewhat in a linear, if not slightly downward fashion. With Sherlock only emerging from his bedroom when John's fifth warning actually resulted in the binning of the electrolyte-devoid brain into one of the biohazard sacks Sherlock had nicked a while ago from St. Bart's. He was dressed back in his pajamas looking cranky and introspective, refusing all inquiries about the secretive fish. Oscillating from dark window to dark window and arguing with John whenever he made an attempt at conversation. Claiming to be irreversibly and absolutely bored.
John nearly choked mid bite, suddenly insulted. "I--*cough* Listen, Sherlock. I have never had a problem getting a leg over and I certainly have never sulked about it out loud. Besides, Sarah and I hadn't even--no. Stop." He realized what he was unconsciously revealing and halted. "This isn't the place for this conversation. In fact, I'm not even having this conversation. Let's go back to where I'm eating and you've apologized and neither of us are talking about any of this. I don't need to discuss my love life with you."
"The only thing I can recall for certain is that I awoke in a hospital on my stomach. I believe it was the screams from the others that woke me.
"John," Sherlock redirected without looking away from the water. He was untwisting his scarf from around his neck and sliding rigidly out of his coat. All movements by rote. He handed both items to John, who took them dumbly without protest. Too transfixed.
Lestrade came forward on the screen, heedless of the consequences and took Gregson by shoulder, turning his back to the cameras and relaying whatever information he'd just been told, effectively silencing Gregson's indignation.
"I need him flipped." Sherlock said after a while, crossing his arms carefully without touching his gloves to his person. When nobody moved he rounded on the group, spelling it out: "/Please./ Turn. Him. Over." And they all moved to comply.
"Yes. Of course." Sherlock's voice went raspy, deep. His eyes swirling with colour.
"Good." A burst of satisfying warmth spread through John and he lowered himself back against that impossibly long body, affectionately mumbling, "now put your arms back 'round me, berk," and fumbling to assist until he was wrapped up again, wanting to regain that suffocating closeness he'd woken up to.
Sherlock's eyes didn't leave the screen, his voice on auto-pilot. "Experiment."
Like a shot, it took off! Threading through the tight gnarl of branches with keen precision. Piercing its way through the thick blanket of fog like a needle through wool.
John never thought it possible that it would take someone like Sherlock Holmes to come in and shake up his life. Show him how it what it was like to /live/ again.
"John." Henry had stated simply, opening the door before the servant could do it. His tone had been the clear statement of someone who couldn't believe he was really standing there in the flesh.
Sherlock gave a snort and flopped his head over, facing John's feet, letting his eyes wander up from the doctor's blunt toes, up his fluted calves, to the knobbly crests at his patellae, before following his lean, furry thighs back down into the shadowed area of his buttocks.
But now it was better. Bearable. Because John was standing just behind that heavy door. So close to him. And tonight they would share each other's bodies for the first time, possibly the only time. But they would each give the other everything they had to offer and that would be enough to save them both.
"I'm not in need of any more adventures . . ." John had said fruitlessly between spoonfuls of another helping of rabbit stew.
Sherlock's fingertips came away with raw, red stripes and John set the warmed instrument down on the floor by the hearth. The bow he set atop it like a lily on a grave. John took the long fine-boned fingers and wrapped them in his hands so so gently. Setting them against his flushed cheek to soothe their hellfire.
"Sherlock." He said his name in warning, glancing up at the spot where one of Moriarty's men had trained a laser sight and threatened to open up his friend's third eye. "Whatever upper hand you think you might have had, went straight to shit the minute he threw the fucking thumb drive into the pool."
Steeling himself, he set his shoulders back, looked Sherlock straight in the eye and set to his task as quickly and efficiently as he could. He even purposely hesitated between divesting and putting on his new button up, allowing Sherlock to peruse his uncovered torso with his jaw set tight.
Sherlock juttered at this new feeling, his eyes threatening to roll into the back of his head as the angry flesh of his outermost insides were suddenly touched with kindness. John was speaking to him again.
Now alone, and with absolutely no idea what to do, John merely continued to kneel. It reminded him sharply of receiving his accolades. The cold stone floor digging into his kneecaps in the Great Hall, but this time he had his poleyns to add even more discomfort.
It rose like a warm summer wind, pulling at his soul in the same way the Adhans, the calls to prayer he'd heard being sung in Afghanistan had all that time ago. And suddenly his dreams were being painted by memories long forgotten. By shifting sands and trickling sweat and a sun that had burned so hard it had been a white hot hole in the sky.
They gathered in eerie silence before the balcony like clambering rats. Pressing in close. Women, children, and men alike. All of them shuffling into adequate positions as a tired old man pulling a low cart came up from the back. Inside the cart were rows of large baskets and from his high vantage point, John could both smell and see the rotting stink and cruel items they held inside.
"No!" John regained himself a little too loudly, holding Sherlock at the threshold. It made Mrs. Hudson jump and involuntarily reach for her hip.
John searched his brain. "It's used as a sedative and I think an amnesic for people who have anxiety, to help calm them down. It makes them forget that they're getting a procedure done. But I'm not totally sure. I never prescribed it." He paused, frowning. "So does this mean that the night bus pusher is looking more like a dentist then?"
"Hm. It's not though." Sherlock admits sleepily.
"He's recently been left by his fourth wife..." Sherlock was mumbling under his breath, stroking his chin introspectively  as he looked intently at the man.
Soon the burn of the repetitive motion began to make John's shoulder burn, which only strengthened John's resolve to make this as good for Sherlock as humanly possible. He wanted to take him apart, as he had had done to him last night, to open him up and spread him out and see all the beauty that was trapped inside. Sherlock had done SO MUCH for him in these past few days. Hell, since he'd met him, and John wanted him to feel and to know how much he appreciated it. Him. How much he /loved him/. Without overstepping the bounds of speaking the actual words.
The night around him was a black downpour.
"Of course not, don't be an idiot." He backtracked quickly after those words, even taking a step back before John took a swing. "I didn't have anywhere else to put it."
Sherlock flipped the biscuit in his tongue and pulled it into his mouth, chewing around his words and the only wafer he actually managed to fully swallow. John did notice. "Only because it gives me the opportunity to solve a locked room mystery from a continent away." He said coyly and John replied with a more confused face. "Unless, that is, you happened to buy two round-trip tickets to Tokyo from Tesco while you were out. No? Hm. Didn't think so.
But Charles' voice responded to this command before John could move, for it had been directed at the High Steward.
Sherlock dared not breathe as John's voice tried its best to die into a sob. 'I love you', Sherlock's mind translated. Murray had whispered 'I love you' to John in Pashto repeatedly and again during his life's most tenuous hour.
In a emboldened spate, John decided that his hand would simply not be enough.
"War is different." Sherlock tried, standing up a little straighter. Still willing to guard John's dignity.
One of Sherlock's hands had fallen limp on John's thigh, seeming to spring to life as he found John's eyes and saw John's internal approval, despite his verbal hesitancy. He let his palm stroke slowly up and down the muscle, hard enough to not be mistaken as anything else. His thumb dragging on the in-seam.
Sherlock's sharp intake of breath shattered the moment.
"Your unsteady stance? A sharp decline in your muscle control? The deterioration of your speech? No wonder they no longer ask you for television interviews...I knew you were in the ambulant stage of the disease by your penmanship alone. How badly were your hands shaking when you wrote Dr. Watson that invitation?"
One positive outcome in his years of hard work.
And it had been good for a while. But then the plague had struck a town not far from the castle and brother Michael had been called away to do God's work, which left Sherlock alone and bored again without a steady supply of ephemera that he could study and experiment on. And he had begun to linger once more.
It was the first touch he had received in years that he had truly sought for.
John made a noise that was meant to be a 'goodnight' in return. But it got stuck as a sharp ball in his throat.
Perhaps it was due to John's presence, but the young woman fumbled with the flask and very nearly dropped it before handing it over, to which Sherlock rolled his eyes exasperatedly.
"I--" Her hands are over her mouth. Her eyes shining with terrified tears.
"What?" The reply was sharp, his eyes flashing in challenge as they pinned John in place.
John found himself aloof again. "I don't understand. What two cases?"
John applied himself to the possibilities, brainstorming aloud. He knew Sherlock liked bouncing ideas around. "Maybe somebody took it then? Or maybe Mr. Asano wanted the insurance money off of it? Stole his own fish?" He stared with wide eyes at the price, recounting the figures four times just to make sure that the amount was really what it said it was worth.
"Wha--?" Blinking surprisedly, Anderson took a moment to gawp at whether he was being insulted or utilized. Finally deciding on the latter, he spoke, "the head was found floating at thirteen twenty-six. Approximately twenty minutes ago. A jogger reported the find when her dog had gone off-lead. We've taken her in for further questioning."
"Yes. You know this already." Sherlock was itching from head to toe, talking about this. For once in the position of having his brain flayed open. Made all the more alarming as it was he /himself/ doing the cutting.
It was then that they came upon King Mycroft.
... .... . .-. .-.. --- -.-. -.- / .... --- .-.. -- . ... / --. .. ...- . ... / .- -- .- --.. .. -. --. / .... . .- -.. //
Lestrade prickled slightly at the insinuation. "Now just a minute. He can't /forbid/ me to do anything." Then deflated. "But he was very, very clear about his rules. I'm to consult with him on this case as a sort of partner. We're working together...mostly. It's not the best of circumstances, but there's not much I can do for it; he's mates with the Chief Superintendent y'see. They'd have me sacked if I put up a protest."
When John appeared in the sitting room, Mrs. Hudson immediately ceased wringing her papery hands and reached for his arm with a stricken face, taking no qualms in pulling him bodily towards the stairs. "Oh John! Thank goodness! The most DREADFUL creature went scurrying right across my baseboards! I need you to find it and kill it. I swear it was as big as a hedgehog..."
"Ah! So you DO know what it is. Then you also know that it's caused by a prion that can be present in brain tissue and that its effects on anyone who happens to ingest it are completely incurable.
"You have, in your ignorance, left open a large quantity of undesirable things by which I could procure and currently have in the flat: fungi, protozoa, helminths...honestly, I would have better understood your disagreeing with helminths more than--" Sherlock's posture became instantaneously rigid. "Hush John!"
Sherlock said nothing, staring at his mobile intently. John's eyes flicked back and forth from Sherlock to the television, waiting for something to happen. Some sort of clue.
John couldn't help but tongue the new shape of his tooth in curiosity. It had looked perfectly natural in the hand mirror he'd been given once he'd sobered up and he remembered the approving flash of a smile Sherlock had flattered him with when he showed it off. The memory of that scrupulous stare focussed entirely upon his mouth was lingering  electric. And it was almost enough to forget that he was currently shaking the hand of a man who was a cold-blooded murderer. Almost.
The steep embankment ran up into a taller vertical wall, plum-bob straight and built as though it intended to block out the sky.
The soft leather padding of the Prince's boots sent motes of dust dancing through the strikes of sunbeam all around John. Making his surroundings glitter.
"Is it?" She flushed at his praise.
He only blinked once when the skeletal hand slid over his. Its many rings tinkling.
The entire left side of the man's face had been massacred by fire. The red skin (long since healed) would forever bear the pattern of rain disturbing a pond. He was familiar to John, and yet John did not know why.
But then John's phone trilled in his pocket and he dug it out. It was from Sherlock. He tilted it to let Mrs. Hudson read it too.
John tries to say 'no'. John tries to say 'stop'. 'Wait, I think I'm broken'. 'Wait! Not yet!' But the body he is hugging shifts upward in a horribly limp way and coming unpinned makes his arms loll terribly and the new fire that lights up in his left shoulder burns like a ransacked city.
They looked at each other for a long while before John spoke. "So I suppose that means we're stuck here for the time being then." he said.
Lestrade barked a laugh. "Nah. He just sort of, /showed up/. Wouldn't tell me how he knew, but I didn't pry too deep. Seems to be in a bit of a strop as much as I can tell. Well, more than usual anyway." He cast a sideways glance to John. "Bit late for shopping in'nit?"
"I meant what I said, Sherlock. It's ALL fine. If you ever want to have sex or not or just want to snog each other all day and not want it to go any further, that's fine too. I'll have you in whatever way you come, just like you can have me. Yeah? And whatever you want, whenever you want it, I'll be ready when you're ready and we'll figure it out together, okay?
Caught off guard, John blinked and adjusted the sack in his hand. His brain fuzzing out around Sherlock's strange adoration. "Yea-yes. Well, from here, it looks like his vertebrae's been crushed from T9 through at least L3. Pelvis turned a full 360 degrees to his chest." His eyebrows were nearly touching his hairline, like saying it out loud made it all the more real. "And his entire alimentary canal's been forced up into his thoracic cavity. I don't know about being shoved, but this is certainly something I've never seen. Anatomically speaking."
The tea tray is set on silent wheels and not a single utensil moves out of place as he comes towards John. It's set with bone china tea cups, a tea pot, stirring spoons, loose tea leaves, a tea strainer, and a pair of pliers.
He /needed/ Sherlock, he realized dully. To follow and to look after, though in a less heavy-handed way. He needed him far more than he needed John. So with a resigned sigh, he decided then and there that there was simply no other choice but to be ready for the day Sherlock decided he needed him back. If it should ever come at all.
The monk suddenly beamed with joy. "Ah! I am in God's favour then. I was told I would have good luck scouring the fields. By chance, I met your sister and her wife in the village. They directed me here. I was warned you were a bit reclusive for a war hero."
"The pool?" Sherlock's words come out in a whisper. "You mean Moriarty?"
John, eager to distract themselves, leaned over to whisper. "Did it never occur to you that I might like to know that you've made me an appointment with a serial killer Sherlock? I mean, for Christ's sake, he's going to have his hands in my mouth!"
Christ, he should call Sherlock in here to help him out. He'd said he would do. Anytime.
A marauding army under the guise of a Crusade had been butchering its way northward under the sigil of a flaming heart. Despot King James Moriarty, the mastermind behind this hellish invasion, had set up his headquarters some way south in Westwood Castle after having seiged it and murdered all its resident in cold blood. From there he had sent forth his war hounds. Three Marshals serving as his bloody right hands to extend his merciless reach further North and lay claim to more lands and more soldiers.
John couldn't help the grunt that billowed up out of his throat, his nostrils flaring hot across Sherlock's cheekbone as a particularly well-placed rub chafed his cock against denim.
Secretly glad to have an overwhelming Mrs. Hudson elsewhere though, John pauses with his foot on the bottom step. Licking his lips, he looks up half of the seventeen steps that hadn't seemed nearly so daunting in his head back when he'd been lying in hospital and worries himself over them. They appear to have proliferated and grown more steep since he last saw them and with his sense of balance so compromised he imagines what it might be like to accidentally fall backwards and--
"Sorry?"
"Not even the good bits?"
"Of course I did." Sherlock said smugly. "It was the one with the bar on its tail."
He chose instead to look down onto the bald pate of brother Michael beside him, who was leading his horse at a conservative pace next to John's. John stared at his skull as if looking into a crystal ball, trying to recall exactly how he had even made it here.
"Being the LEAST awful thing he deserves." Sherlock mumbled and had suddenly donned his Belstaff. He glanced down at his phone, before slipping it back into his pocket and looping his scarf around his throat. He left his requested coffee full and abandoned in the carrier on the counter. "Speaking of; he'll be headed this way with the Yards' forensics team just now so John and I had better be off. Mustn't dawdle. Good morning."
"Of course I couldn't have," Sherlock made a wrinkled face in disgust, the distaste of John's statement causing him to look back, "you can't just separate and mix them about willy-nilly. It took me /weeks/ to come up with ones that flattered each other so." He faffed his hand, annoyed, eyes back on the party. "Don't be so ridiculous John."
"Being shot is certainly a life altering thing. But for you, John, it was worse. Much worse. To be specifically shot in such a place as to put an end to everything in your life that you had worked for. Effectively negating the pursuit of your military and medical careers simultaneously. It /killed you/, metaphorically and almost physically. You came back to London a broken man. Absolutely wrecked. After all, you couldn't even stand on your own two feet properly.
His spirit had rallied ferociously, and with it, his health. And now he was gaining back the strength he had lost, the endurance that had abandoned him, and the courage and ambition that had been the reason for his boar family sigil.
An entirely different one indeed:
Sherlock ignored the DI's brusqueness in favor of turning his attention to the little fuming man standing beside Lestrade. "Anderson. Your text was misleading."
Usually anything born into this world was quick to die soon after. But this new life, following swiftly on the heels of John's recovery, felt like an absolution.
Though he admitted silently to himself that he was touched. Vocally, he opted for humor, or what he could only find as a close approximation. "To symbiotic relationships then. And, of course, the BeeGees." He raised a cheeky toast.
And from then on there was nothing that could be done to rouse him.
But then a warm, solid hand slid across the top of his, and he realized two things; one, was that his hand was gripping the end of armrest like a claw, and two; that he had pinched his eyes shut. When he opened them, Sherlock was tilted over him very closely, becoming everything he saw. It was immediately disarming and his hand released its death hold on the chair.
"Sherlock." John said softly, soothingly, kissing lightly at the corners of his sneering mouth. "Sherlock. C'mon." He used variations on his name to punctuate each touch of lips. Kissing and prompting and kissing and prompting until that impossible mouth became lax again under his patient touches and finally Sherlock could not help but give the tiniest kiss back.
Trusting him implicitly and wanting to convey that, John let all the muscles in his body go as limp as they could without falling over, setting down the curled tube of toothpaste and going lax. Leaving only his cock to retain its solid expression and giving Sherlock whatever he wanted. Offering it to him freely.
But the throws that had been well placed struck true. And struck hard.
A surprised snort broke John's resolve and Sherlock's sea glass eyes turned to a look of perplexity, but appeared not at all dissuaded.
Some thirty feet ahead of them, a raised balcony had been built straight into the cliff side, free from any sort of purchase upon the ground and came to an even height to their  horses' shoulders. The platform was hemmed in by a golden balustrade that was only accessible by the two wings of low stairs that curved in on either side.
"Hmn. Please." John couldn't stop from rocking microscopically against the notquitetickle, trying to make Sherlock move besides that insufficient sensation in his arse.
Ever the peacekeeper, John took three steps back and opened the door wide for her, pinning her eyes with a look that he hoped conveyed his want for her to trust him as much as she'd been trying to get him to trust in her. /I'm as safe as I choose to be, Sally. Everything's fine. I don't need minding./
"Oh? Well that's a lovely thing to hear." Mrs. Hudson said, coming back into the room with a fine china cup of swirling chamomile, but when she went to slide the cup onto the side table, she paused. "Oh my! That's a pretty bit of writing, isn't it?" She swapped the tea for the black letter and held it very close to her face to read. "A bit shaky with the penmanship, but besides that very nice. It's been a long time since I've received a formal letter to something. I believe the last one I got was from my best friend Margaret. It was for her wedding. Can you believe it? Two years of not speaking to me after she walks out early on MY wedding and poof! out of the blue she sends me an invitation...oh, but listen to me. You really are too sweet to me John. You must learn to tell an only lady to hush every now and again." She slid the letter back into place and patted his fist where it was curled beneath the blanket. "Now you get back to having that rest and I'll just try to clean a bit of this place up as quietly as I can, alright? I promise to save the hoovering for another day. Is there anything else I can get you?"
"And what, may I ask, is your answer for me today?" He purred as he laved. The same question he had asked every day. For the last four years.
But he was casually dismissing the dealer's words with a disinterested hand wave. "No no no. I require stimulants. Uppers if you must but NOT preferred." Sherlock's voice was also raised as if this were a perfectly okay conversation to be having. "Hallucinogens are of no interest to me."
"What? Are you looking for tips?"
Moving slowly, Sherlock let himself out of the door and shut it softly behind him. John began to pull himself back into the day's previous clothes, setting his teeth against the fact that he had no idea how to go about procuring more, when there was a knock at the door.
"But in the meantime, I ask you that you please refrain from silhouetting yourself in any of the windows and I would recommend carrying your Browning on you at all times." Sherlock had moved over to the door and was shrugging on his Belstaff solemnly, as if leaving.
"Um, John." A hand came through the slight opening, laden with folded jeans, socks, an undershirt, pants, and his red button up shirt. Sherlock had apparently figured it all out for him, somehow made it past the goose, and gathered some clothes. They were lowered to the floor when they weren't immediately taken. Then the door shut again and John was left pressing the heel of his palm into his eye, lost in a sea of bewilderment.
"Sorry? What?" It sounded absurd and John stopped completely from unrolling the stripping of gauze to the length he wanted, then shook his head vigorously. "You know what, I don't even want to fucking know. Don't tell me. I DON'T care." He pressed the gauze a little too firmly to Sherlock's head and wound the bandaging around the circumference of his skull a few times before knotting it on the opposite side.
"Ah. Mr. Sipe." Sherlock said, rising from his chair before the assistant could even get a word out. "Pleasure to meet you."
John presses in further, with both words and space, wanting to cement this into the entrance of Sherlock's Mind Palace like a plaque. "When I killed Jefferson Hope, I didn't feel bad. I said he was a bad man only after you asked me if I was alright. And it's true, he was. But...that didn't really matter to me at the time. It still doesn't. He could've been the best man on the planet and I'd have still shot him anyway. For even touching a hair on your head I would have ended him."
But John was ready for this. "But I /do/."
He dislodged his mouth with a soft pop. "Wouldn't you agree Captain?"
"I find that rest comes quite easily actually. How about you? Still having your nightmares?" Mycroft said complacently, the slight tilt of his head taking his whole demeanor from placid to shrewd in the blink of an eye. "As refreshing as your concern is for Queen and Country, I'm afraid that the topic of this conversation has come to an end. If you would be so kind as to put your pettiness aside for a moment we can move onto the real reason for my visit, Dr. Watson."
John sniffed, that poignant sound that meant he was at the end of his rope. That everything inside him was just about to snap. That he was about to kill a man. "Right." Was all he whispered before turning into the kitchen and straight down the hall.
"I'm sorry." John whispered in congested, open vowels. "I didn't mean to disturb you. I just...it's beautiful."
"No."
"Well? Do you talk? You do know how to speak, don't you?" Sherlock asked, irritation now circling around his words like smoke. "My brother has not sent me a mute as some cruel joke?"
"So then why are you even chancing it?"
"Think about it! He could just easily dispose of their bodies in an unknown location, get away with the crime, but he chooses not to. Just as much as he could leave them wearing what they would every day, but he doesn't. He's proud of his kill and he wants us to know it. He's developing a ritual with VERY specific parameters. He wants an /audience/. Ooo! This is turning out better than I expected...we have another serial killer on our hands...how marvelous!"
The smaller bird thrashed and screamed as much as it could. The ragged sounds seeping in through the missing diamond to assail him. The snap and pop of small bones crunching like rushes as the kestrel bore its way inside.
The shower rod haloing the slipper bathtub at the back of the room held eight Nepenthes plants and from each one drooped at least half a dozen large, bulbous flowers in the shape of open mouths. Their throats were a sensation of color, the swooping fleshy cups varied from gold to green to red to purple. Some were long and thin while others were fat and squat. Given their waxy skin and general aesthetic, they looked to be some sort of strange empty variant of fruit.
John found himself the sudden recipient of a blue scarf and a large, heavy coat as they were unceremoniously shoved into his chest.
The sound of a key fitting into a lock and the heavy clang of a bolt sliding back roused John from his ruminating. He blinked away the spots from his vision and saw a large wooden door at the end of the hall, fortified with black iron braces being slowly opened. And was confused.
John fingered through them initially, wanting to get an idea of where he might start and furrowed his brow. The stack was a confusion of music; orchestral albums were shuffled in with classic rock, oldies with compositional symphonies, opera with ...heavy metal? "Sherlock? Are these all yours?"
Sherlock cocked his head coyly, polishing off the sandwich and said nothing. With his plush, pink lips glistening with grease and his gown sliding off one sharp shoulder, Sherlock looked nonchalantly wanton. And John was immediately struck with that unassailable feeling that took him at random moments; where he couldn't tear his eyes away.
"When you unconsciously allowed me to see you shirtless, there was clear evidence that you had spent a large amount of time with your torso exposed in Afghanistan. You've lost your true tan, but you still retain enough of a tone difference to show that you had, in fact, been shirtless multiple times during your three tours. So the choice to remain clothed presently has to have been made /after/ you were released from your extended stay in hospital.
"Then WHY?!" Sherlock thunders. "What could possibly be worth risking your life after all I've--" he stops and shakes his head, as if trying to shift back into his old way of thinking. As if he's alone in this again. "...after everything?"
He studied its contents as though it told Sherlock's deepest secrets. Swirling it like wine. "If you were to drink this, do you know what it would taste like?"
oo1. Athelny Jones was an inspector from Sir Doyle's 'The Sign of Four.' Just stole his name 'cause I liked it.
The mouse in Mrs. Hudson's kitchen actually ended up taking up the majority of the day to exterminate. By the end of it, John was stripped down to his vest and mopping at his sweaty brow with a tea towel because he'd had to move the majority of her appliances away from the walls trying to get the damn thing and emptied almost all of her cupboards to find its trail of destruction.
John thought about asking what he'd done, but he let it alone. Reverting back to his initial intention, now that he had calmed. "But you /do/ understand that I'm still upset about what happened, yes? That's why I left. I didn't have another option." Lately, he'd found it more helpful explaining his emotions to Sherlock, who never seemed to understand them at the time. It was a bit like talking to a six foot, broad shouldered child.
Dr. Sipe cleared his throat and broke them apart and Sherlock only fell back once he was assured John had been sufficiently calmed. His hand giving a reassuring squeeze before drifting back to the margins of John's awareness.
The most extraordinary thing though about this boy was what he had striping the entirety of his throat. Rising up from the crisp white collar of his dress shirt and taking up the space clear to his chin, were the bold, thick crossing lines of the Union Flag. The red and blue geometrical blocks stood proudly against the naturally white expanse of his throat, the negative space left uncolored. The naked vertical stripe of St. George's Cross lined straight down the boy's esophagus, giving it a strange sort of ideation for crucifixion.
Sherlock's eyes pinched into serious thought. "We were living together previously, now we've incorporated sex into the arrangement. What sort of title does that create?"
oh yes. the piece that Sherlock plays later in the chapter is Sibelius' Violin Concerto in D minor [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujHJSzATQQ ] which is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE piece of classical music ever in the history of the planet. but also, since I tried to write my description of it being played in time with the actual music, i've listened to it so much i'm sick of it. but hopefully if you're in a curious mood you can follow along and figure out each part as I described it and it's new enough to you that you'll hear its beauty...
"Now," the High Steward continued, "let us go and meet Prince Sherlock..."
"And now that you've been informed John, I want you to ignore it. None of that matters right now. Right now I want you to continue what you were doing, but lower, avoiding my penis all together and paying the most attention to my perineum. And then when you're ready, I want you to manually penetrate me." He slapped the tube into John's limp hand and settled back into the pillows, spreading his knees and presenting himself sacrificially, as though what he'd just said didn't change the tilt of the world beneath their feet. As if he was /used/ to this sort of self-immolation.
Sherlock keened, high and hard, as John stalled him in a hovering position yet again, gasping and panting. "Did you take something else? I need to know. Anything besides the Viagra?" John asked.
"These are the rules by which I will hold in accordance this ridiculous notion that Sherlock was ever in need of a new Captain of the Yeomen of the Guards. Have I made myself clear?"
John swallowed the hard lump rising in his throat and willed the cold sweat to stay in his skin.
He teased the silken head with the tip of his tongue, having to sacrifice a hand to prop the wilting prick up now and followed the natural groove of the glans up and down.
He watched carefully as Sherlock, with black nitrile gloves on, began poking and prodding at the face. Testing the retention at its forehead, its malleability when he pinched its cheek. He picked up the tongue and slid his fingers into its mouth, hinging the jaw open wide, examining the teeth with a penlight that John handed to him without even having to ask for it.
"Sherlock?" He knocks on the bedroom door before heading in without hearing a response. "Are you planning on getting up anytime within the next century?" John asks when the door closes.
"Because you're a marvel." John said simply and then immediately felt silly with the words hanging in the air between them. He wished he could have snatched the sentiment back, but it was done and Sherlock didn't seem to mind. If anything, he could blame the scotch. "Tell me more about Eric. Was he ...nice?"
He studied the subtle topography of John's muscles as he shifted around in the most miniscule ways in the afterglow. The slide of his hamstrings. The flex of his toes. One of them had clear signs that it had been broken at some point in his youth, presumably from football. There were old silver scars dotting his shins that told of having been acquired in his teenage years, when his sports interests had turned to rugby. John, no doubt, having to have joined in an effort to confirm his masculinity, when puberty hadn't graced him with a height increase past 5'6".
At Tesco, John was deemed trolley pusher, as he often lost his focus, and Mrs. Hudson floated before him, muttering to herself, asking questions he occasionally did not answer, and making decisions on food for the both of them. Currently, they were puttering around in the baking aisle.
They were Sherlock's.
" 'course. If you want there to be."
"Everyone gives off unique pheromones, body odor, excretions from the skin, that sort of thing. But the man's scent and the one on his clothes were mismatched. It usually takes about a day and a half to fully saturate the fabric with a distinct odor, the only variable being what's being done in the clothes while the person wears it. Exertion would let it saturate more quickly as opposed to inactivity."
The doublet the man wore was pale yellow, embroidered with an intermittent pattern of dark gray flowers, while the pumpkin-shaped breeches surrounding his slim hips were of the opposite contrast; rich charcoal fabric decorated with delicate yellow thread of the same design. The long black robe about his shoulders whispered as it kissed the floor, lined with fur, coming clear down to ankles that were clad in perfect white chausses embellished with golden thread.
"Detective Sherlock-san?" The client asked in a stuttering, heavy accent, glancing oddly around the foray and pointing up. He no doubt thought he'd perhaps come to the wrong place. John wondered if they should have a discussion about putting a sign up outside.
John drops his jaw and shakes his head. "Harry. I can't accept this."
"Yes. Some silly idea the King had. I don't deserve it." The shrubbery about them had turned to hazy smears in his periphery as the tears would not be held back longer and came to rim John's eyes.
John wanted to say 'no' out of spite, to punish him. But this wasn't about what was going on between him and Sherlock. John would be punishing himself just as much as he was punishing him. So instead he said as flintily as he could manage: "just give me a sodding minute, alright? Out."
"That obvious, hm?"
"Oh. Forty seven minutes, give or take. It wasn't a problem."
"War does things, Sherlock. Things that...it changes you..." He looked up into Sherlock's sea glass eyes and tried to be as honest as possible while simultaneously remaining very vague. "It was good. What we had, while it lasted. It helped me make it through. It made it /bearable/." John knew that was not the answer Sherlock was watching him for, but as a token of his friendship, he was letting it lie. John took a bolstering swallow and tried to steer the conversation back around. "Your turn now. You've obviously deduced most of the things that there are about me with that big bloody brain of yours. I want to hear about you. What you've done. Have you been with a man?"
Blech! Too sweet again.
And was overwhelmingly grateful when William did not look back, keeping his eyes fixed upward upon Castle Appledore. He seemed content to let John look his fill.
"And when I am able to figure out our next course of action and resolve the matter of this murderer once and for all, you are free to leave John. Or if you so wish it, I will go and you may keep the flat. It will be your decision.
Given an approving nod from the High Steward, all the remaining servants set to work. John watched, transfixed now, as they all swarmed Sherlock and like a magic spell, dressed and adorned and applied all the fabric, jewelry, and makeup to him that they had brought. Turning a sparkling diamond into a glittering star.
"See here. The body was put into the water, the neck severed just to the point of tenuous hold, enough to keep him together until the buoyancy of the water was able to pull the head away to the surface to be found." Sherlock threw his head back in a pleased bark of laughter. "Do you understand? The killer's toying with us. He KNOWS we're onto him. He purposely used Sipe as a red herring. Leading the Yard's investigation astray only to bring US back on his path. He's moving the game pieces on the board in our direction. He wants to be found. But not by that oafish moron Gregson! He wants ME to get him. He couldn't have planned this better if he'd plugged in some neon lights that said 'HELLO! COME AND GET ME!'."
He watches Sherlock's face as it shifts from confusion to a steady fear. A fear that John might indeed know what it's like to love someone this deeply and be helpless against it.
When the normal lights resumed, he finally laid eyes on Sherlock again. He was bent over speaking very closely to what appeared to be a bodybuilder about to bust out of his white shirt and dark waistcoat. The man was John's height, but had so much muscle crammed beneath his skin that he was practically the same in width as well. Their faces were incredibly close. Too close.
"Yes." William had replied, squeezing one last time before stepping back and taking his husband's hand again. Confirming it. "As happy as me."
Sherlock was pushing up onto his feet soon after, completely ignoring his drink and placing his hand gently onto John's shoulder. "I feel like a bit of a wander, David. Have a dance maybe. Coming?" He kept his voice casual.
"Good evening brother. Dr. Watson."
Another pulse of that foreign heat tunneled down Sherlock's body. Quick and wicked and never enough. But interesting all the same.
"Jesus! Sherlock! What?"
"John?"
Sherlock hums and tilts his head, both of them poised like two people at the opposite ends of a chess board. Ones that seem to have been playing this game for a long while now. "How about we talk about you? How it's been YOU all along who's been behind these bodies turning up with missing organs."
"You never need to ask me to." John said in a breath, his hands sliding down his arms and settling around his elbows. He looked vulnerable standing stark naked with his head down.
With that, John's legs gave out beneath him. Dropping him like a fifteen stone sack of bliss.
John challenged him with his eyes momentarily, licking his lips, and took the cigarette anyway.
John flexes his hand by his side and blows out a breath, nodding, knowing what Sherlock can't say. "There have been a lot of things in my life that have tried to put me in the ground and they haven't managed it yet, but what they have managed to do is to make me regret some bloody enormous things in the process. Which I'm not willing to let that happen again.
She made to swat him playfully on the arm, but took one look at his red raw nose and extra baggy eyes and reconsidered. "Oh love. You look terrible. Have you been here all night?"
The choice had been simple. And after alerting the other villagers to their current plight, a vote was taken and they met Marshal Moran outside the main village a day later. With little fighting skills between them and the element of surpise on their side.
"Oh no. Nonononono." John growled, tightening his grip on the ice-cold fabric and the freezing arm beneath and leading him towards the ambulance. "After Sherlock. You can look at it /after/."
Placed beside him was his RAMC mug filled with tea. It sent up wispy licks of steam as he gazed at it thoughtfully.
A nesting of long black feathers (his constant accessory) had been fashioned into a collar about his neck, jutting straight out from the cup of his doublet, turning his wraithlike features more avian than man. As though he were a six foot vulture.
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
A brilliant smile broke out across Sherlock's face. One that made his temples squish up into the rays of the sun.
"I am though." Sherlock said.
Tearing his eyes away, he headed toward the roaring fireplace. He took a long pair of iron tongs from the wall and pinched up three large stones that were glowing red with heat before dropping them into the half barrel bath his servants had left him  from this morning. The mysterious gray water hissed and the herbs that floated at its surface rippled softly.
The hot shower he took soothed him and his scratchy throat for the most part. Deliberately not thinking about where he was and what exactly he'd been doing here a few days before. He shoved those thoughts viciously out of his mind, unwilling to parse through old emotions that'd felt like they'd happened to someone else by this point.
"Y'know what I'd like to do together now?" He asks, waiting for Sherlock to make an interrogative noise. "I'd like to go to bed. Will you come lie down with me?"
If Sherlock made any attempts at calling him back, it was lost in the cacophony.
His breath felt hot on John's chin. "Were you sent here to spy on me Sir John?"
"And take this last to heart: you are a tool, Captain. Nothing else. And I am allowing you to stay on only to keep the Prince in good spirits until our marriage is consummated. Apart from that you are nothing. Least of all his friend. Is this understood?" The High Steward had come closer, towering over John.
For Queen and Country. No less.
At the last he falls still. Holding there.
There was no way possible he could make this climb every day. Not if his and William's chambers were clear down at the bottom like the High Steward had hastily mentioned when they had begun their ascent. He was certain that he would expire upon the stairs within a fortnight.
Fearing discovery and repercussion, Harriet and Clara had sworn William to secrecy (knowing this to be one of his most admirable traits) and relied on him to be their eyes and ears to the village and to bring them supplies when they required them. And he was as faithful and steadfast friend as he had always been to John. Especially in John's time of need.
Hot, spurting bullets of cum struck Sherlock's ribs as Sherlock's teeth bit down around the soft give of John's throat. Tasting John's roar. Sherlock rode out the wave of John's euphoric contractions until they ebbed into a full-body shaking.
"I look terrible." He said.
John was only vaguely aware that they had just come to a cursory agreement on...whatever it was they were  to partake in. Did it have a name? Friends with benefits? Partners? What had he just been thinking about?
John clenched his fist and jaw and tried not to squirm too openly beneath the sting of his words. For everything he spoke of was a lash of truth. He was a fool to think he could ever interfere with royal lineage.
The threat of sick remained floating in his stomach, always. Perturbable in its timing, rearing up just as he would get comfortable. John had half a mind to stick his finger down his throat and be done with it, and even the very thought of it snapped his shoulders forward and made him gag. But nothing came up.
"It's him!"
Taking a breath through his nose, John squeezes the back of Sherlock's neck. "The next time it won't be like that. I swear to you."
In time, Sherlock began to rock with his movements. His hips making little scooping motions, leaning back in and closing his eyes when he met John's mouth. He reached up with his free hand to place his palm over the side of John's neck, holding his head in place against the pillow, like he didn't want him to move.
Sherlock took on this new train of thought with a quick and significant shuffle of his eyes. "He's trying to get our attention. This isn't about love, this is about a declaration. He murders his victims in places where there is a low chance for witnesses, yet does so with the intention of having his victims ostentatiously found.
The powdered white flesh of the King's face was stretched tightly over his skull, rising like a specter above the burst of black feathers that collared his thin throat. His plucked back hair started unusually high upon the top of his head, pinned behind a line of pearls. He could have been a bestrewn corpse, had he not had those piercing cold blue eyes.
"No husband of your own?" Brother Michael looked up, the steam having fogged up his spectacles. But there was still a glint in his eye.
Upon his return from Afghanistan, John had never allowed himself to even DREAM that his life would be anything more than a miserable trudge through depression to death. And though he would never say it aloud, he had intended to eat his Browning the day he'd met Mike Stamford in the park. He'd even gone so far as to write up farewell note to his sister Harriet. But he'd gone for a walk on a spur of the moment idea, and his whole life changed by passing a stranger his phone.
"It was the recommendation for a masseuse who specialized in Gua sha." He continued when John made a noise to explain. "It's the traditional Chinese practice of scraping the skin with a smooth object resulting in lividity. It's believed to bring unhealthy elements to the surface and stimulate blood flow at the sight of an injury. He could tell you were having trouble with your shoulder."
But she was really, truly done with him and she had no more voice to give as she and the officer walked right on through.
Sherlock didn't /do/ this and it made John's hackles rise.
It had thrilled John to know that he was about to be in the man's company once more.
welcome back! took me damn long enough, eh? all I keep thinking as I write this story and remember that I need to pick up loose threads i've made in previous chapters is that there're 'two tons of shit in this one ton story', but i'm pretty confident it all gets figured out in the end.
"Yes." Sherlock said after a long minute. "Thank you John. I'll take it into consideration."
"Oh God!...Sher--yes!..." His voice was an incoherent wail.
and for those of you interested. i haven't given up on finishing my other story Bury My Brain at Baker Street. i have the chapter about half written and am struggling a little with dialogue but am working on it as much as possible. i hope to have it up by next month. i'm very sorry about the delay. :} and as always:
"The POINT is that the opal was an heirloom passed down from their recently deceased great grandmother, which was mined by their great great great great grandfather from his personal mine in Andamooka Australia and was valued just that day at approximately thirty one carats by a gem dealer, which is equivalent in today's market at being sold at £4ooo."
"Shortly after that Mycroft ordered a raid on the house where we had been living. I propositioned his release from jail with my promise that I would remain in the care of my brother and I never saw Eric again."
"Snooping." Sherlock admitted kindly, purposely mixing balled up socks across the invisible divide into the underwear side for the hell of it. "I've just made you ejaculate without even touching your penis and subsequently go unconscious; correctly predicting the outcome of my experiment. So I believe I've earned the right."
The makeshift wardrobe to the left of the bed, sectioned off by heavily painted triptych screen that depicted the The Garden of Earthly Delights did little - despite its strange beauty - to fill the room with life. Aesthetically, this room was as cold as the stones that ensconced it and forever (it seemed) would it remain so.
"Oh cheers! Glad that's settled then." John slapped his hand down on the table, reclaiming the slipper he'd lost to the floor and padding over to fill a glass from the tap. Not entirely sure how to handle his friend when his words twisted up something inside him.
It was the long silent drive with the doors locked in a back seat where the windows were so tinted that he couldn't see out of them. It was feeling the car drop in elevation and slow to a stop somewhere below ground. It was the great lorry of a driver opening the door and letting John get in a couple of good punches and a kick to the face before wrestling him to the floorboards and pinning him down by sitting on his chest.
'Bart's.' Comes Sherlock's spartan reply.
"Not like that." His whispered words are hard. As if spoken in contrition.
When his touch reached Sherlock's palm, Sherlock's hand instinctively closed tight around it and Sherlock came out of his stupor like a man coming out of water.
The twin waterfalls that plummeted down from high above fell behind these stairs, sending up great sprays of white foam from the deep pits that had been wrought into the earth a little ways below them, before wandering off to create the twin lower rivers.
John was discontented at how comfortable brother Michael seemed to be around his house, but after the monk bade him sit and pulled a pre-skinned, pre-jointed rabbit wrapped in a stained linen from his satchel along with a handful of potatoes for stew, he could do little but obey.
Sherlock grinned in a way that John felt in his bones and without breaking eye contact, placed his slickened middle  fingertip to John's furled hole as requested. John twitched, blowing out a strained exhale through his nose with his jaw locked up tight. A gentle circled pressure against /there/ had his breath picking up and hissing from his nose like a bull, leaning hard into his wrists.
He nodded fitfully, feeling like an idiot and let out a breath he hadn't been aware he'd been holding. Sherlock saw everything as it slid across his face and pressed his scarf against his throat to keep it in place as he reached down to take up the nose piece. "You're perfectly safe. I'm right here." And he enveloped John's mouth in a kiss.
Wasting no time, knowing anticipation seemed to be worst than the actual act, Sherlock licked again, longer this time, with more applied in both pressure and amount and John gave another aborted sound that cracked that mouth just a little bit open as his chin canted up sharply. Making progress.
They stayed in their places for a moment, hard as sin at the sight of each other, panting with open faces and deep, pleading eyes. Fire and ocean connected. Twisted up together and never coming apart.
Feeling the tight squeeze of hunger in his belly, John opened the fridge and found nothing immediately appealing. Or rather nothing he could convince himself looked tasty enough to want to make to eat after he was done with his toilette. "I'm starving. I don't suppose Mrs. Hudson was kind enough to make us up some breaky--"
"Um, what's your definition of serious?"
And another.
"No argument there." Sherlock grinned, revealing a joke John hadn't intended to make. John busied himself with inspecting the wound, finding it shiny with moisture, which was a good sign. He carefully checked it for signs of infection, put delicate fingers to the redness to see if it gave off any heat and took a cursory sniff for any unusual odor. Satisfied, he applied another smear of antibiotic ointment to the exposed cartilage and peeled apart an occlusive bandage, snipping it to form fit over the odd shape of his ear. Sherlock continued speaking while he worked.
A moment was spared to Sherlock's considering, which made that same look that had afflicted him last night in the cab come over him again, where Sherlock calculated all the ways that saying what he was about to say might go badly. These were things that were difficult to pull up from the archives of his own life. But they were important. /John/ would find them important and Sherlock by proxy felt them necessary enough to expose to the light.
The stack of fuzzy petri dishes still teetered precariously on the edge of the kitchen table like a game. Sherlock's microscope abandoned in the center of the tabletop with the slide still clipped in place and John mooned at the knowledge of what it had all been abandoned for.
"I-" John fumbled, feeling stupid, but felt the point important. He had left him in such a state yesterday, he did not want to draw suspicion. "You're makeup...I don't want - if they see..."
"Vaguely." John honestly didn't remember much of it. He remembered the slap and the kiss most pointedly. The ceremonial dawning of his armour. What he remembered most vividly was laying eyes upon the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and that seemed to have eclipsed all the rest, but he did not make this known.
Sherlock searches his eyes and finds the reassurance he seeks there. He accepts John's words as true as a tear creeps down Sherlock's cheek.
Long before they had run out of ammunition, the man in the stocks had stopped screaming. He hung there limply, fingers broken, face caked in a myriad of decay. A droplet of blood crept down his nose and dripped into the crystal pool below where the water was beginning to wash away the remnants of the crowd's fury.
for those interested i've included a link to what I imagined Sherlock playing while John cleaned the flat...
The violin screamed beside Sherlock, upon him, because of him. The sounds he couldn't make from his mouth were drawn from heated metal. The next best thing. They threatened now, to drip like molten steel onto his chest, down his legs, and flood the room. To smother them both in rich and poignant sound and drown them together forever.
Swallowing the lump in his throat, John pushed himself up off the wall.
Inexplicably, a memory floated into the forefront of John's thoughts, Sherlock's voice repeating a comment he'd muttered while they'd been sitting in Dr. Sipe's waiting room about redheads requiring double the anaesthesia dosage of other people. The profundity of the idea, the sheer randomness of its recollection, made John smirk which in turn caused the young man to finally turn away.
She had them stop the trolley in the middle of the aisle, giggling. "Or was it crocodiles? I can never remember what those silly things were called. Well, anyway, I'll leave you to it. You come find me by the magazines when you're finished dear. I know I walked into something earlier and I think it's probably a good idea for you two to make up. Alright, love? I'll just be right over here."
The Queen Mother smiles, pleased with herself. "Ah good. You have solved it then. What a relief. I was starting to worry you'd never figure it out. So tell me, when did the great detective finally catch on?"
It was momentarily jarring to think that this was the man that had done what they'd seen. Putting a kind face to the wicked deeds.
John looked at the temp and assessed the man. He HAD sat patiently under John's administrations, despite there being a corpse /right/ outside the door just waiting to be disseminated. And he had stopped shivering and looked more like a human with the blood returned to skin level. "I suppose it'll have to do." He sighed and could barely get out of the way before Sherlock was brushing past him, taking only the briefest of moments to press a kiss to John's hair.
Oh sweet Mother of Christ he was thorough! "Viagra? Sherlock? You took Viagra for this?"
"It's not as if any of it is a threat to you." Sherlock tried, waving his hand at the (to him) completely harmless discs languishing quietly in the kitchen. "Your immune system's not compromised in any way and they're almost entirely innocuous. And despite your concerns, I'll take all necessary precautions to keep accidents from happening." When John's shoulders didn't come down from their tight posture in his periphery, Sherlock finally turned fully to observe him. It also helped that an advertisement had flashed up on the screen simultaneously and severed his focus. "Does it really make you that uncomfortable?"
"Fine." He finally sniffed and turned back to his preoccupation.
They weren't on the list. "If you're asking me to filch supplies from the office, we've got the q-tips in the bathroom. Use those." John suggested.
John laid a hand gently on the folder, unspun the string from the closure, and fingered the flap open. It would be so easy to know, to learn about all the things that had vexed him regarding the enigma that was Sherlock. His whole history was waiting in that folder...
And it was a testament to John's resolve as well, a testament to the seriousness of what they had together, that John himself did not betray a single feeling towards Sherlock either. Eyes ahead, back stiff, he acted like a knight in every aspect of the word and never even once feigned a flicker of an eye towards his captive Prince.
And at once he was on the move, stumbling over the clutching man, nearly falling to the ground in his haste to flee. And it was with Clara's steadying hands at his upper arm, her plaited hair nearly draped across his shoulder with how close she was, very much supporting him, that he had been able to find his way out of the village and on trembling legs that threatened to give out at any moment, had found his way home to stay.
And still Sherlock found himself wishing that it was him out upon the lentil being feasted upon. That their lives were switched.
Sherlock always awoke abruptly at this point. Gasping for breath with sweat on his brow. Every time aware that he had just barely escaped a vision of something even more monstrous about to happen to his person, but not willing to imagine what it might have been. Always waking up before so that he could never see. Vowing that he would never sleep again. Succeeding until he simply couldn't. And the cycle would start anew.
Holding him delicately while he fit the key into the lock, Charles let his fingertips graze up the smooth wood of the protrusion to where it was swallowed up between the globes of his arse. But he did not press in any farther. He never went any farther than this.
The Queen Mother had paled considerably, Sherlock's words ringing through her like a bell. She looks hollow. Her hands squeeze together tightly enough for her bony knuckles to bulge through her papery skin. She /knows/.
John had no choice but to acquiesce.
"Well of course you can't. I've downloaded a program that will translate it as you type. Hurry up."
With that, her locked arms slid from her chest and with a small, disappointed nod, the statement seemed to unravel her constant assault from the very core of her. He watched the concern wash from her face, resigning herself to the fact that she could not save him. That he did not WANT to be saved. And place him as the lost cause he was.
CHAPTER (þri) THREE
It should be obvious by now that he's practically helpless, with one half of his right arm enclosed in a hard cast and his left wrapped up in a sling beneath his vest, but it seems to surprise Sherlock each and every time it's brought to his attention. Likely thinking too hard on something else.
John nodded and slowed down at their approach, flexing his hand inside his coat pocket.
The dead body didn't behave like a living one, which made moving it difficult. It was heavy and squidgy, all thirteen stones a loose bag of meat and bones that lolled jointlessly. The limbs swinging wild as they worked and huffed and grunted, but between the three of them, they managed to get it turned over. They kept his head laying parallel to his shoulder, to such a degree that his neck looked like it had been snapped.
It wasn't until what looked to be his final days that the miracle came from an unlikely place. It had been brother Michael, the high priest of  Castle Appledore, who had been called in to absolve Sherlock for death. And was instead the one to make him live again.
It was not until an older man, grizzled by war, had stepped out from the crowd and raised the stump of a cut-off finger to point at him, his mouth hanging open as though to speak that the din subsided.
He suddenly, vehemently did not want this.
And not moving again.
"That's it. Yes." While the man slung libations together, John wallowed in his self pity.
"And I will not be held responsible for anyone else to be the death of you. Do you understand? If the worst thing I am at the end of all this is selfish, then I take that title willingly. Your death would END me. There is /nothing/ more important in this world than you are to me and I would rather watch London burn to the ground around my feet than allow one second to pass without you in existence."
"So? Who did it?" The video cut to to the camera having been mounted in the top corner of the room, putting the whole rack of tanks in its field of sight. With the lights turned off, the room was gray and full of shadows, the once colorful fish had turned to black meandering splotches against the wall, seeming to float in midair.
"I can, in fact, be one hundred percent certain that you've taken no male partners before or after your three deployments due to the fact that you would have willingly engaged every solicitor that presented themself to you during your tours and found every one to be either farcical, inappropriate within the divisions of rank, or unsatisfactory in some way. Yes?"
The bouncer leaves. And moments later the curtain John is strenuously investigating sweeps aside and the thin man with the Union Jack emblazoned across his neck comes out bent over a magnificent trolley. He's dressed in the same gray suit he'd been wearing at the club (sans jacket and tie with a white pocket handkerchief) and the swathe of his fiery hair blazes orange against all the red.
"Yes."
"Iy. That got taken care of as well. Seems Gregson's taken her on as a personal assistant of sorts, so it's very possible we won't be seeing much of her--"
"I needed to determine the powder's effects on the body and being the only willing subject available there was really no other way to test it." Sherlock blinked, trying to ignore the fact that this intention should have been entirely obvious, but John's obvious  displeasure at the very idea of it was clearly getting in the way of his common sense.
