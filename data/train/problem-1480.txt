Dampness clung to his hair, signifying that he’d just come back from a shower after Quidditch practice. The winter game was coming up soon and there was a lot of pressure on Greg to do well, he nearly missed the snitch in their last game.
“Because the John I moved in with is not the right one. Now we’re flatmates, and continuous exposure to one another is going to lead to some unwanted romantic ideas, and yet again I will have to look for a new flatmate. And for the
Sherlock’s father and John talked about sport, discussing the pain of hockey and mourning the mutual dents in their shins from the twats who didn’t play fair. Sherlock’s mother talked to him about school. John managed a few jokes, to his surprise they actually laughed. Sherlock argued incredulously, a ridiculous biology hypothesis against him and Mycroft.
“Because I'm not guilty.” Sherlock replied, stopping John from moving by gripping his shoulders, grounding him and hoping to silence the panic he could practically see building in his friend.
“Because she couldn’t get to you over the summer.” She replied. “It’ll take a little while to set in. When I realised what was going on for myself I couldn’t believe it either. She told me everything.”
He’d skipped his tutoring, missed it maybe, to hang out with Sarah Sawyer. Sherlock wasn’t sure why, but that felt like betrayal of the highest calibre. He went out of his way to help John, help him with something he needed, something he’d never done for another person before in his life, and John had the audacity to stab him in the gut by replacing him.
Over the course of a few months Sherlock had come to the conclusion that as long as his chest was covered, John was fine with it.
He made John and himself another cup, knowing that John would keep himself up worrying about her waking up again, and knowing that he’d stay up with the doctor to keep him from going insane.
“You are being a child, Gregory. Honestly. You should know it was a fake smile, the laugh too, if you listened to my tone of voice you’d hear the disinterest. But I think you’d rather sit in than get kicked out for me acting like usual.” Mycroft replied, pinching the bridge of his nose in annoyance. “Why are you so bothered by this?”
“So, we’re a disguise.” John spoke indignantly, offering a pointed scowl to the taller man, who grinned at him.
“We got in a scrap, poor thing got her nose broke.” She spoke, holding her hand up and clenching her fist as if she was examining it. “Threatened to use her blackmail on me out me to the whole school but I told her I didn’t give two shits. She’s a controlling bitch.” She shrugged again, making a face as if to say
He gave John a look, a smirk, before he began to read it aloud. “Section one: speaking to people.” He could see John grow uncomfortable as he spoke. “Muggles like to make small talk, the same as we do, however muggle small talk is never about spells or pets or how expensive the latest broomstick model is. When talking to muggles here are some topics that are-“
“Right.” John nodded, licking his lips, and fiddling with his hands in his lap, not sure what else to do other than listen.
John giggled and Sherlock much to his own surprise laughed with him, before John shushed them both. “We can’t laugh it’s a library!” He whisper-shouted, which only made Sherlock want to laugh more.
John pressed a quick and discreet kiss to the corner of his mouth, Sherlock didn’t resist, and as much as he knew he’d get the ridicule from his class, he appreciated that John wasn’t ashamed of him. “Thatta boy, I love you too.” John replied, smiling at him and offering him a wink.
That was a good point, there had been a noticeable difference in Sherlock’s mood and behaviours since he’d began to talk to John. Despite the drastic dip when John began to date Sarah, most of them were good differences. “Watson. Yes, he’s a good associate for Sherlock, a stupid one, but a good one.”
"Don't you fucking dare, John Watson. It's not true, no matter what." Sherlock looked at him, it wasn't a stare of anger, it was a look of concern, of seriousness in a way John hadn't seen.
“That sounds very gay, but I can’t say I object to it.” Greg replied, turning his head to catch Mycroft’s gaze. “Is this your way of flirting, Mycroft Holmes? Because if so, you need to get better synonyms for attractive.” He laughed, turning back to face the sky, and Mycroft couldn’t help but breathe a laugh in return, a genuine one, an unusual occurrence.
“How do I say that?” Sherlock asked, opening the box, realising if he said it wrong John would find it immediately hilarious, he’d learned his lesson after the television incident.
Sherlock’s hand found Johns arm, as the doctor cupped his face, fingers just weaving their way into his curls.
“You know I will.” He held the box, tilting it gently, listening, before bringing it to his face, sniffing. When he sat it in his lap again, he looked up at John. “It smells like you, you’ve kept it in a clothes drawer or wardrobe to hide it or keep it safe. It’s valuable, or sellable at the very least. Size of the box says jewellery, not a ring, nor earrings, so wrist or neckwear. You know I don’t wear necklaces as they interfere with my scarf, so wristwear it is. Weight reads as two things, a charm-bracelet or watch, whilst I’d wear it regardless, I doubt you’d get me a charm-bracelet. So, watch.”
Considering the Gryffindor didn’t appear to be planning on a reply, Mycroft did instead. “The one and only. I take it you went, Hufflepuff, no?” He could’ve gagged, meaningless talking that would inevitably be forgotten made his stomach turn, but if he told her to piss off, he doubted she’d be too kind in letting them stay.
The words echoed in John’s head before he could truly register what exactly they meant. “How? I haven’t laid a hand on him I swear, I would never. He fell off my broom once but there wasn’t really much I could do about that.”
“Her sister, Avery Sawyer, her specialty was potions.” He took a breath. “Sarah got in a row with her best friend, who told me Sarah was putting Amortentia in my food, had been the entire time.”
“I will, here.” John replied, sliding his package over to the taller boy. It was haphazardly wrapped, with Sellotape covering every crack and rip the Gryffindor had managed to tear. “Yes, I know, eloquent isn’t it?”
“Her sister was making love potions for her to drug you?” He needed to clarify what he’d understood, John nodded, taking a sip of his drink. “Mate, that’s not okay, genuinely it’s- that- that’s ridiculously
He was breathing heavily as it came back to him, the bathroom tiles, and her hand, demanding and controlling and he couldn’t think about anything other than his waist.
All too quickly his body fell forward into John’s with a strange amount of elegance John didn’t understand how he had given the circumstances. The Gryffindor managed to manoeuvre Sherlock’s lanky frame, without getting tangled in the lead of his headphones, so his head was in John’s lap, and John’s back was against the wall. If he fell asleep then he wouldn’t fall forward or back, and if Sherlock woke he’d be easily found.
“Well a bit, but really?” His expression went from sarcastic to disbelieving, he honestly couldn’t believe Sherlock hadn't realised yet.
“Filches cat will get us in a second.” Sherlock deadpanned, but sat up anyway, giving a muffled grunt as John threw a jumper at him.
“Erm… Back before- Before mum died, we used to spend time together on a Sunday, all of us. We’d watch telly or play boardgames, but almost always we’d listen to music. Mum and Dad loved The Beach Boys, me and Harry came to as well, so we had all their albums on vinyl. She’d get us up to dance with her, even though none of us could, it never really mattered.”
John cut him off before he could continue, he could see the anxiety building up in Sherlock, the faster he spoke. “I never said that.” His reply was quick, and Sherlock turned to look at him, expression confused.
Since the altercation of last year John had been abrasive to the idea of Sherlock tutoring him again. This bothered Sherlock slightly, but he decided it wasn’t a matter worth pressing. And thus, Sherlock hadn’t brought up the idea of flying lessons, he half hoped John had forgotten about it, but he knew it was idiotic to think John would forget anything.
Sherlock watched in amazement, as from the starburst gunshot wound in John’s shoulder, were the ends of a tribal sun, growing round the wound in a circular pattern, it was breath-taking.
And there it was again. Always somehow, no matter what, his thought process has cycled back to that frustratingly stupid Gryffindor.
“Greg, you idiot.” Anthea replied, if she wasn’t levitating a disco ball she probably would have face-palmed.
John ran after him once his thoughts caught up, ignoring the cramp in his stomach. “You? Sherlock Holmes? Are going to the shops? What for?”
“You’re from an unloving household. Your dad is an alcoholic, your brother potentially likewise. You don’t like your brother, maybe because he left his wife, maybe you like his wife, maybe you don’t like his drinking. Your mother isn’t in the picture.” Sherlock spoke, keeping his voice down but speaking quickly, careful to annunciate in the hope that John would keep up. It was difficult for his mouth to keep up with his brain as it worked studying every inch of John that he could see in the hopes that he wouldn’t miss anything out.
He didn’t imagine it would take place in their living room at three in the morning after the realisation that he had a family.
Anthea had no answers, and the hurt in his chest and the breath catching in his throat every time Greg purposely avoided him increased in their power over him.
“You aren’t going to ask me where mine is?” The doctor asked, the kettle had finished boiling and sherlock could hear the rattle of spoons and the pouring of water. They were now back at the topic of tattoos.
“Then, four hours, roughly.” John replied, taking his shot, pocketing a ball, and going again. He’d spent enough time at the pub to be decent at the game. He smiled softly, replaying Sherlock’s ballocksed attempt to ask him out.
"God you're tight. I'm close. You're getting there, correct?" Sherlock asked, feeling John tighten around him.
He turned his back to them and walked away before anymore words could be exchanged. He felt ill, which was new, and quite frankly he just wanted to collapse into his bed and never get out of it, also new.
"Fuck." John breathed out again. "Thank you, Christ that was- oh my god." John couldn't speak, he couldn't thing, Sherlocks fingers were still in him and he could feel the taller mans erection underneath his hand.
“I’ve gone mad.” John spoke when they finally pulled away from one another. “God- Sherlock- I-“ He stammered over himself, trying to look anywhere but Sherlock. “Where does this leave us then?” He asked finally.
“What’d they teach you!? Abracadabra!? Alacazam!?“ John braced himself for impact, this was usually where things got bad. “Pathetic, you’re a good for nothin’ freak!” A kick to the stomach. “Worthless-“ Another, he curled his arms around himself, hugging his own torso. “Mistake!”
“Half seven.” Sherlock called over, making a point to look at his watch, and John rolled his eyes, still smiling.
She shot up like a light, nearly too quickly for him to tie the end of the braid and turned round excitedly. “The ducks! We have to go quickly daddy, or they’ll already have been fed!” She squealed, dashing from her room to find that tin of sweetcorn.
“Of course, I remember.” John replied, his voice was mumbled and with a quick glance up it was obvious John had caught on, his cheeks tinted pink and his ears quite red.
“Yeah, of course I know.” He frowned, it wasn’t exactly a secret that Sherlock didn’t have any friends, he shrugged of or scoffed at most other people, except maybe Greg, and he hadn't been too mean to Sarah the only time he’d spoken to her, he’d even gone so far as to tell her what glasses would suit her best.
Sherlock watched him, he was staring at the floor, it was strange to see him like this, it hadn't happened so severely for a while. His head hurt from it all. “Your mother, did she like this type of music?”
Taking in a soft breath he knelt in front of his brother. “Sherlock, what’s the matter?” He asked, knowing fine rightly what it was but he’d rather Sherlock told him. Sherlock had been irritable from the moment he’d woken Mycroft up that morning.
John laughed half-heartedly. “No, you don’t. He got me on the ground, between him and a wall, to protect my vital organs I tried to block him out with my arm. Big mistake, clearly.” He replied, gesturing with his wrist and wincing as a small stab of pain shot through it.
He clenched his fists and took another breath before replying. “It’s Sherlock, it’s always Sherlock. He’s starving himself or something now, and god help me I'm worried about him. A-And its nothing new, I’ve always got nightmares, my mum usually but-“ He coughed, clearing his throat, trying desperately to continue. ”But now they’ve changed…”
"No you're just- fuck- you're really good." His voice was strained, his breath hot against Sherlocks skin. "I'm gonna- fuck Sherlock I'm gonna cum." John breathed out, his voice shifting in pitch the closer he got.
He quite liked Professor Flitwick, he taught well and made lessons exciting, and he was one of the only teachers who didn’t get annoyed at him. John had an excellent memory, he studied hard, and anything written, he could excel in. Practical was where he failed catastrophically.
The loud sonorous call of the announcer bellowed out across the bleachers, and the two teams drew out onto the field.
“Well put one on, then.” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, flopping back into the spinny-chair they kept for the desk, rolling back away from it as John giggled a little at him, and turned to flick through the vinyl’s they had stacked up on the desk.
The smile on Greg’s face made it worth enduring the tiresome repetition that most muggle games relied on.
Five minutes to the hour, John came rushing in through the doors, eyes quickly trained to Sherlock and even through his haze he recognised guilt and worry in John’s reactions to him.
“You hate QI.” John spoke pointedly, hanging his coat up and checking his phone to see who the detective had texted, to no avail, he was always crafty about deleting things. John didn’t doubt it was just a text to Greg. If he wasn’t doing an experiment he’d be pouring over a cold-case.
“Oh, bollocks it’s a muggle thing then. I didn’t even think, sorry Myc!” Greg laughed. “It’s this thing muggles use to change their hair colour. You mix these chemicals and like it absorbs into your hair and dyes it.”
John smelled like coffee, and manly shower gel. His head came to Sherlock’s chest and there it rested, no doubt he was listening to the taller man’s heart beat.
“What happened to Mycroft?” John asked, and Sherlock managed to hide his gratitude, he hated having to show that he cared about his brother.
John visited for the summer, just like he had done the year before. Sherlock was glad to have him, considering things at home had been going just as well as he’d expected, Mycroft had moved out, he was living in London, with a job at the ministry curtesy of their father. He visited a lot, mostly to check up on his greenhouse and to have dinner considering he was useless at cooking himself.
John shook his head and frowned for a moment, confused and slightly awestruck, before finding a card under the bar of chocolate.
Irene raised an eyebrow at her. “Boss hm? You could’ve told me that’s what you liked, Annie.” Anthea glared at her for the nickname and for the comment.
He wasn’t aware it was commonplace to be on a first-name-basis, but he didn’t question it further. “Yeah, John Watson, Rosamund’s father.”
“No- John-“ Sherlock stammered over himself, before placing a hand over his eyes. “The watch is wonderful, genuinely, but you could’ve bloody hurt yourself!”
“Since when do you care?” John was smiling now. He couldn’t help but smile when Sherlock acted so ridiculous, he knew it was on purpose, but it still made him grin like an idiot, if he wasn’t laughing already.
He had a thought process, different to others, just as Sherlock did, but he couldn’t traverse it in the same way. Sherlock figured whatever way it worked was like a travellator, and he just had to stand their until he was brought to where he wanted to be.
“Oh, thank you. Should I open it now?” His birthday had been a little while ago, but he didn’t want to give John any indication of it, most things about him, the older boy could work out if he observed, the date Sherlock was born, was a secret he’d like to keep.
“How do you expect me to help him?” John wanted to add that he sucked at most things that weren’t quidditch, but he was intrigued. Considering he’d never spoken to Mycroft in his life, yet the older boy knew his name, John assumed he already knew that he was pretty dim. But yet he decided to ask anyway, and John couldn’t help but feel there was more to it than just study help. Besides, Sherlock was quite interesting, he at least wanted to ask how he’d confused the sorting hat.
Leaning against the wall of the boys changing room, was a girl. She had curly blonde hair, and a happy looking face. She was one of Sarah’s friends, her best friend if he remembered right, the Ravenclaw chaser, her name wasn’t coming to mind but he recognised her enough to know that she wasn’t supposed to be there.
“Five-hundred-and-twenty-thousand approximately, not counting spelling differentiations, and it was an educated one.” He replied, sitting up properly, intrigued.
They ended up sat on the floor of the Ravenclaw commons, in front of the fireplace, Sherlock was sitting with his chin on his knees and his arms wrapped around them, and John with his legs crossed, and leaning back on his hands.
The Slytherin smiled softly in agreeance before he collected himself enough to respond. “It’s not forever Gregory, you’ll see me again before you know it.”
The castle was filled with people, obviously it was, he didn’t know why he thought it would be a better place to go than the pitch. People were staring at him as he ran through the halls in his quidditch robes with a bloody nose dripping onto the floor, a stitch was tearing into his side and a sickness was rising in his throat, threatening to spill out over the edge if he didn’t get out of there soon. He felt like he was suffocating.
“I should’ve seen it coming.” John spoke quietly, getting started on making tea, two mugs hit the counter, and the taller man smiled to himself.
Sherlock wasn’t the most knowledgeable about the ins and outs of relationships, but he knew that a lot more effort was required in a romantic one than there was in a friendship. For most people he wasn’t willing to put in that amount of effort, hence why he’d never even tried anything with Molly Hooper, but for John? For John he was willing. But still unsure as to why.
“Let’s get down to business.” Sherlock began, turning the book around to point to what John needed to see. Before he could continue John cut him off in what he thought was supposed to be whispered singing.
Maybe it wasn’t a total lie, he had been running, and there had been threat of a concussion, but the injury was his head slamming against a wall as he got shoved before John tackled the asshole to the ground and the police caught up (lagging behind, as usual).
Though he stopped focusing on what Sherlock was doing, and more on what Greg had just said, and what that meant. “Oh.” He replied simply, unable to wrack his brains for a better response than that. “I can tell him we aren’t if you want, I’d get the secret back.”
“A little warning would’ve been nice.” John replied, reaching a hand up to run it through Sherlock’s hair, he sighed contentedly in response as the shorter boy traced softly into his scalp.
John looked surprised, doing a full turn to take in his surroundings. It was an empty room, not big enough to echo dramatically, but enough to feel lonely without another person. In the middle was a mirror, a few metres away from where John stood.
His father deemed that enough, and walked away to the kitchen, leaving his son shaking in the corridor, quivering with tears streaming down his face as he struggled to calm his breathing.
Now Sherlock’s interest was grabbed, he closed the book, setting it on the table and clasping his hands. “When and where?”
John rolled his eyes, leaning back against the bench, feeling the tension fall from his shoulders. “Well you haven’t told me yet.”
His own lips were still tingling, he was itching to do it again, but he needed John to initiate it to know that he was okay with it completely. “Paper’s on your chair, nicked it off Mrs Hudson earlier.” He spoke, somewhat encouraging John to relax, to sit in his chair, to know that this situation was normal.
He’d known Sherlock from September. He was a rich prick and not many people liked him. Considering John was also doing all three sciences at A-Level, he spent a lot of time around him. For some unknown reason Sherlock opted to make John his partner in practicals and over time John found himself friends with the taller boy.
He mixed into the crowd of students, supposing he should go to Sherlock’s tower to find him. He walked with the crowd, trying to push past people, until somebody grabbed his arm, he turned but it wasn’t the person he hoped. It was Jim.
"Shut up." Sherlock replied, knowing for a fact that the demand would go straight to his cock, and despite his lack of interest on the matter, making the cabbie uncomfortable would most certainly embarrass John, and he never took kindly to that.
John didn’t reply, instead he reached blindly for Sherlocks hand. He could barely contain a smile, knowing it wasn’t the time, but John clumsily linked their fingers together, squeezing like he needed it more than he needed air. He wouldn’t admit it, but he was secretly so fucking pleased.
“Was the dream about me again?” He asked, his voice a monotone drawl, he didn’t feel like putting any emotion into his tone of voice.
His hand crept further south, his fingers brushing gently at his labia. "Is this alright?" He asked gently and John nodded against him. "Okay tell me if I should stop." Sherlock could read anyone else like a book, John though, was slightly more tricky, he didn't want to screw this up.
“Well I suppose I owe you a secret now then.” Greg replied, pausing for a minute to think, before leaning forward. “Alright I got one. Promise you won’t laugh?”
John pulled gently at his hair, and he raised his head, eyes making contact with Johns own, and the doctor lost his breath. He was struggling to think as he stared at Sherlock. He couldn't think of a better way to phrase it. "I'm not- I'm not a re-"
“Muggle cards are free from demolition Phil.” Greg’s face lit up as Mycroft turned to look at him, before realising his mistake. “Simplest game I know is jack-change-it.”
“Well if it isn’t the Ice man.” Irene spoke with a smugness Mycroft didn’t understand as he approached them, her rouge lips forming a smirk as he caught his breath.
“They will be. Sherlock needs us, we’re the only people he trusts, and it may take all three of us to get him to leave.” John replied.
Once the sweetcorn was gone, thrown about across the paths, being steadily consumed by ducks and whatever other birds came along, John grabbed Rosie’s hand to walk to the address Sherlock had texted him not long after.
“I believe my brother is…” He paused struggling to find the words, as he placed the ace of hearts, much to Greg’s chagrin. “
The room was filled with warm content. The two men were sat in their designated chairs. The television was playing something nonsensical, and neither man was paying attention to it, it could have been The Last Leg or Loose Women, and no effort to change the channel would have arisen.
Sherlock stood, hands behind his back, gripping his wrist with his right hand hand as he stared across the hall. His eyes darting from person to person, noting the details, deciphering their motives.
“Pretty good, introduced Myc to Dad, they got talking about science for a bit. Dad’s a teacher and Myc’s super interested in muggle stuff. You should have seen the look on his face when we got a cab back to Dad’s apartment. It was boring, but I was giddy for a week after that they got on well.”
Anthea looked at him concerned, he was breathing quickly and heavily, and his face was paler than usual if that was possible. “Boss, you aright? You don’t look too great…”
He rolled his eyes as those in his house turned to look at him, instead chose to focus on his brother.
"I want that too." John smiled softly, reaching a hand up to run his fingers through Sherlocks curls, he pulled the detective down so their lips met, softly. "You're going to sleep. I don't care if you don't want to, you need to."
John cleared his throat first. “I didn’t mean it, any of it, you aren’t a freak, and I'm sorry I ever said that you weren’t my friend.” Sherlock thought it would stop there but apparently John had more to say. “You aren’t normal, I’ll give you that, but you’re extraordinary, you’re clever and-  and you’re brilliant, and you’re my best mate. I was insecure and I was angry, I thought if I insulted you I would feel less bad about the things you said. I really am sorry, Sherlock.”
It had been two weeks and so far he was going strong, still trying to put together the pieces as to how Molly Hooper was stupefied if he didn’t do it.
His skin prickled at the cold as it swept over his bare arms, so he grabbed his dressing gown from the foot of his bed, slipping his feet into his slippers and walking down the staircase silently. If he was honest with himself, this was around the time he’d usually make a cup of tea, have a row with the photographs, run an experiment.
That’s when it hit him. Rosie could say his name perfectly well, he knew she could, and John only started calling him Lockie after she did, so it wasn’t by his influence.
Then came John’s birthday. Sherlock had been acting strangely the entire day, and John had forgotten what day it was completely.
John caught his eye and burst out laughing, much to the Ravenclaw’s confusion. “They’re not real, it’s a muggle thing, calm down a bit.” He replied, putting his hands up.
A strike of hope hit him, and his heart began to race as he caught sight of a raised hand in a leather glove.
He was a considerable height taller than John, a lot more noticeable now they were close up, but John supposed that was just him being below average height in the first place.
flat. It wasn’t the coyest thing, but Greg was filled with rage, usually when he wanted to douse the flames of his own rage he did it with alcohol. It wasn’t an alcoholic habit, Mycroft supposed he just enjoyed the way that it nulled his thoughts.
“Mother, Father, is Sherlock with you?” Mycroft asked, and their smiles quickly faded and John’s heart began to beat in his throat.
John swallowed, before offering a bashful smile, feeling heat rush to his cheeks. “I’d hardly call them heroics. I mean he could’ve died from the fall, I was hardly going to sit and watch. Hurt like hell on my arm though.”
“Myc! I didn’t expect to meet you here. I thought I’d see you in the commons- Oh-“ Mycroft pulled him into his chest, his arms around his back holding him close, like if he let go Greg would shatter. Greg was his only friend, hell if that didn’t scare him within an inch of his own life.
“Sherlock Holmes. No need for the apology, its quite alright.” Sherlock replied, hiding a soft smile with his mug as he took a sip. “Insomnia is it? Or PTSD.”
“You’re the only one who’s ever told me anything like that. I didn’t realise it wasn’t considered platonic.”
Instead John nodded, offeing  SMOLE“And what does Sherlock think of it? He’s made no comment to me.”
The sight of them together made his stomach turn, and he turned on his heel to walk the opposite direction before they noticed.
Sherlock nodded, meeting John’s contented blue eyes with his, now red around the edges. “Please don’t kiss me, not now, please?” He asked, trying to steady his voice.
“Deceased, how did you know?” John asked, normally people just took him to be a single dad if they didn’t know about Mary. They usually came to their own assumptions, John only needed to correct them if they voiced them wrongly.
If he’d had his way he would have been here three years ago, but Mummy said that he had to go when he got his letter, just as his older brother did.
When time came for the castle to become a place of festivities, tinsel and baubles every way you turned, Sherlock decided it would be a good idea to show John what he’d been learning, teaching himself rather.
. She- She’s dancing, mum is. Dad’s smiling up at her and- a-and she’s pulling him up to join her.” The more he spoke the more his voice began to tremble. “They’re happy, laughing- He’s holding her and-“ He broke off his sentence, as tears began to fall, he put his head in his hand.
“I gathered.” John paused for a minute before his face lit up. “Hold on I have a thing for you.” He rummaged in the backpack at his feet, before pulling out a box wrapped in newspaper, with a Tesco premade bow stuck to the top of it. “I couldn’t find any actual wrapping. Mycroft wouldn’t tell me exactly when your birthday was, he said it was in summer, so I uh, I brought you something.” He handed it to Sherlock, who took it gratefully, analysing the weight to try and guess what it was, it was heavier than he expected.
“Pine fresh.” Mycroft cut him off, and the door swung open, before he turned on his heel, walking to the Gryffindor commons.
The mother and father of the two boys were bidding them farewell, the elder nodded, and the younger did nothing, simply walking to board the train.
“Because you’re my best friend and I wanted to give you something that wasn’t stupid. I care about you, Sherlock.”
“I suppose. I could tell you missed them intentionally, if you’re wondering. I didn’t realise that Samantha was the reason why.”
Using his hand to fondle Sherlocks balls, he took as much in his mouth as he could without gagging, his nose just about grazing the detectives pubic hair.
It wasn’t until his two knights and his queen had their weapons raised at his king did he admit defeat, he couldn’t help but mimic the gleeful grin on John’s face.
John gave a mock salute, walking to the kitchen. “Sir, yes sir. I thought I got invalided from the army?” He opened the fridge.
“John, mind if I sit?” A boy he knew by the name of Mike Stamford asked, peeking his head through the glass door.
"Oh yes, how dare they applaud you." John cut him off, a smirk on his face, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, trying to ignore how much that expression made him tingle.
Sherlock didn’t know what he wanted, and the sorting hat didn’t know where to put him. He had the bravery of a Gryffindor, the cunning of a Slytherin and the wisdom of a Ravenclaw, yet no idea which he was more partial to. Mycroft was surprised that the hat hadn’t had a stroke yet.
Sherlock adored how John had to look up at him, he could imagine how the doctor would have to stand on his toes to kiss him.
“Educated how? I was blathering on about how I wasn’t gay, and how I wasn’t your date the other night, you didn’t even pick a
Sherlock watched in confusion as his face flushed red, because it wasn’t from the sight of the taller man in just his boxers. Usually he slept naked, but he’d spare John that experience until he was more comfortable around him
“You’re nervous.” The elder stated, raising an eyebrow and Greg shrugged in defence, picking up one of Mycroft's umbrellas, handing it to him in an attempt to suggest they needed to go.
He was trying to impress her then. His t-shirts were probably the only clothing he had that looked decent with the distress in his jeans.
John managed to open his eyes, realising that the over coat of his quidditch robes had been tucked behind his head like a pillow. He sat up quickly, too quickly and winced as the blood rushed out of his head all too quickly.
Unsure of what else to do, Sherlock simply lay beside him, flat on his back, his hands clasped over his midriff. The shorter boy didn’t acknowledge him in the slightest.
“Mate we’ve been waiting for you, sit down!” He spoke excitedly, as Mycroft took the seat opposite him, beside another Slytherin he’d come to know as Anthea, and a Hufflepuff by the name of Sally Donovan.
A hot spike of pain burned into his finger, and he pulled his ring off, to see vines slowly growing from his finger down over his hand.
“Nothing, you alright to wait with him for a minute or two? I need to borrow notes off somebody for the class I missed.”
“How’re you feeling, Sherlock?” Greg had dropped his hand the moment the door opened, now standing up. Guilt struck him again as the question hadn't even crossed his mind, he just opted for the knowledge that he’d be able to tell immediately. Now it seemed as though Greg cared more than he did.
John laughed. “’Fraid so.” He replied, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead, having the height advantage now.
He was pacing, holding his phone up to his ear, he was shaking his hand out of nervousness, unable to jitter his knee standing up, one of his other nervous habits. It was clear he was in distress and Greg got the feeling in the pit of his stomach that it definitely had something to do with the letter.
“The wonders of coffee, tea and twenty-minute naps on the sofa or the nearest available surface. I was testing a technique, still used often in south America. It’s called polyphasic sleeping, its quite interesting.”
He kept checking back into the game, watching it, Dimmock had the ball, in a back and forth with the Hufflepuff chaser, dodging the bludgers with swift skill. He could feel his shoulders slump and his stomach fill with a sickening feeling. He couldn’t do this. Everything felt too fast.
“What if he wasn’t with you, what if he got one of his mates, a metamorphagus or something, to sit with you while he went and did it?” John froze at her words, how had they both been so stupid? Surely Sherlock would’ve worked it out the moment the situation arose. Somebody must have changed themselves to look like him, metamorphagus, Polyjuice, it didn’t matter, it was plausible. “John?”
Sherlock was saying something to him, but he wasn’t listening, it probably wasn’t that important anyway-
It was a wise choice, but considerably out of his comfort zone as far as clothing went. He enjoyed the layers that masked his lanky, gaunt frame. Though he knew that age would come and stretch his fast metabolism into weight, that time had not come yet, so he needn’t worry about it.
“You thought it loud enough for kings-cross to hear.” She replied with an eyeroll. “You can’t control his every move, no matter how much you try to.”
Greg raised an eyebrow and then raised his hands in mock defence. “I see where I'm not welcomed.” He replied and John’s face flushed, and he rolled his eyes.
“Take a seat, I’ll be with you in a moment.” He spoke, his voice was baritone and hypnotising, and John sat down in the wheeled chair opposite him.
John was with Greg, they were in a pub on Diagon Alley, Greg offered to go with John to get his school books, considering Sherlock had all of Mycroft's old hand-me-downs and had no need to go. Sherlock being Sherlock, didn’t object and John left his phone for Sherlock to mess about with.
“John wouldn’t ditch him after one little argument.” Greg replied, he knew John, John was loyal, and it didn’t seem like him to get annoyed very easily. Stressed? Yeah, John could stress for the entire castle if you needed him to. But he never really got angry. He always pushed to get the best out of everything, quidditch, classwork, even his relationship with Sarah took work, but he still got the best he could out of it.
Sherlock didn’t want to know. Because once he opened up like this, it wouldn’t be long before he was asked what the name was, or before the ring came off in a chase, or before, god forbid, John took it off him in one of the rare times he was sleeping.
But in the end he hit the same roadblock. This was Rosie’s teacher, and he’d been very insistent ever since that one fling in Uni, that he was one hundred per cent heterosexual. Maybe that was a lie to himself more than anything.
Sherlock shrugged. “You got annoyed at me for pointing out to Molly that Jim is gay. I figured if I were to end your own relationship you’d be furious.”
John got up grabbing his phone from the coffee table, where Sherlock had left it, leaving the living room to call. He knew Sherlocks order by now.
John took a breath, ignoring all the eyes that were on him, focusing on Sarah. Sherlock told him to focus on his own emotions and channel them into confidence. “They aren’t rumours if they’re true Sarah. So, what is the truth?”
“Well maybe if you opened your book instead of checking if your boyband meme page had any new followers, you’d know. Surds, anyone heard of them?” The class was silent, twenty-seven pairs of eyes trained to him as he paced the classroom. The desks were organised in a U shape so he, and the board were always clear. Twenty-six, now a particularly anxious boy had decided to look down at his book.
“How honourable.” Mycroft remarked, his tone was slightly bitter. “If it were me or Sherlock she’d be in Azkaban.”
“School.” Sherlock replied, even though the question was clearly directed to John. “He’s in my sciences, the only tolerable one there is. He’s my practical’s partner.”
John pulled away, eyes blown out and his lips were red, Sherlock moved to kiss his neck, in the absence of his mouth. It had just occurred to him that despite having top surgery, his distinct lack of a dick beyond a packer was something that needed to be addressed. He knew for a fact that it could potentially change something, the least of which was whether Sherlock still wanted to do this with him.
“Well, it calms you down, reminds you of your father, and the happy memories you’ve shared. The music, and the chatter distract you. And you like a drink.” He smirked.
“You told me that you’d wanted to be a doctor. If I remember right, you were pissed that you couldn’t be a healer, and because Hogwarts doesn’t offer the usual muggle subjects you wouldn’t be able to be a doctor either. Well, that’s just a reminder that I think you’ll be a fantastic healer and I suppose it would be handy to have if you become a doctor anyway. People like sentimental things like that don’t they?”
Before he could stop himself he glanced to the crowds of people, skimming for Sherlock. He had a moment of disdain when he couldn’t find him. Had he not shown? It wasn’t a surprise, Sherlock didn’t much care for quidditch, but he’d hoped that, now they were boyfriends, he might come. He’d come to games before, but he’d stopped once it became boring. John supposed that’s why he wasn’t here, or why John couldn’t see him.
“Why must it always be this? You and me, in a locked room, to discuss something I probably don’t want to?” John asked once the door was locked and they were trapped, a sense of de ja vu rushing through the room, as john did his best to keep his expression neutral and his body language minimal.
“Thank you Sherlock.” He spoke gently as the taller man adjusted himself to hug him back. Sherlock could’ve sworn he felt John’s lips ghost his neck as the shorter man stood on his toes, head resting in the crook of Sherlock’s shoulder.
It was the first game of the year, Dimmock had put a lot of pressure on everyone to ensure they would win, John especially. A few of the new teammates weren’t as great as everyone would have hoped, so John as one of the more capable members had a lot of pressure.
Before he could get the Seeker’s response, or the captain’s permission, he bolted from the pitch. If there was one thing that muggle P.E had given him, it was a faster running pace than most.
“I don’t know if any of it even matters-  Be-Because Dumbledore wants to talk to you and they talked about snapping your wand and suspension and expelling you and I didn’t hear much else and I-“ He was pacing, John, was pacing. His hands found his hair, running through it as his words sped up and his breathing quickened, he sounded on the verge of tears.
His face somehow seemed to fall when he looked at John, as the dim light from the moon outside shone against his face. He was dressed, fully dressed minus his shoes. He hadn’t been sleeping, conducting experiments downstairs John presumed.
to do this himself. “Sarah, I hope you find somebody who does love you, because nobody deserves this, nobody. So please, just leave me alone.” He took a breath and walked past them quickly, he didn’t want to do this anymore, he didn’t want to think about it anymore, he didn’t want to talk. He didn’t want to.
He dropped his trunk on the doorstep with an exaggerated sigh, as he fumbled with his keys to open the door. There weren’t very many things on his keys, a house key to his dad’s, a key to Harry’s, a keychain he’d gotten on a holiday to France and a multitool.
“Yes, most people are usually alarmed. The whereabouts of my tattoo is simply convenient, two birds one stone, isn’t that the saying?” Sherlock replied, looking up to the shorter man, leaning against the table.
The beep of a car cut john from his thoughts and he looked up to see his sister in her battered old Mini, he smiled at her, despite the tears in his eyes from the ache of his arm, it was genuine. He dropped his trunk and his backpack at his feet, and turned to face her. She was staring at him with a frown on her face.
Sherlock nodded. “Correct. Mark, square route of four?” He spun around again pointing to a boy who liked to hide in the back
The doors to the commons burst open, Professor Snape with Professor Flitwick in tow, looks of urgency written clear as day on their faces.. “Mr. Holmes, you must come quickly, it’s your brother.”
“Right.” He flopped his head back against the pillow, soon after a pained grunt fell from his lips, and his grip tightened around Mycroft's hand.
He was shown by Martha Hudson into one of the spare bedrooms. It was light and spacious, with a comfortable looking bed. His bag had been left down to the room.
He half expected Sherlock to come wake him up in the middle of the night and drag him off somewhere ridiculous where he could have a smoke despite John’s protests.
“God, no, I can’t do maths for toffee.” John laughed. “She has a few books, but she just has a knack for it I guess. Her mum maybe.” He offered, and Sherlock furrowed his brow for a moment.
For a start he wasn’t even sure what he liked about the man. Or maybe there were too many things to choose from.
“No, it’s… Fine.” Sherlock paused before his face lit up, and he went back to talking. “Your limp, you ran up to my apartment, but didn’t remember until you had to pause, and stand for a moment. I assume you have a cane, and you took the umbrella without haste. Nobody with a limp would think of going anywhere without a cane, yet in your haste, you forgot.”
“I like the idea of being a healer, but I don’t think I’ll ever be at the right casting level. When I was little I liked the idea of joining the army, so I might do that.”
He managed to form his school scarf into a makeshift sling before slipping down the stairs to the bathroom, locking the door behind him, and opening the window. He’d had to sneak out a dozen times before, but never with injuries as bad as this. He pushed his trunk out first, and then his back pack, before standing on the cistern and using his working arm as leverage.
Some of the older boys gave him a metaphorical clap on the back, congratulating him and asking him how he’d done the thing with the sorting hat. He wasn’t entire sure why they were talking about it, it wasn’t unlikely that Mycroft had had a similar experience.
John didn’t seem to think so, as not even thirty seconds later he had taken the needle off with a shaky hand, and had returned it to grip the desk alongside the other.
John pulled away, still looking up. “That was- god- good, that was good.” He spoke, his voice almost a whisper.
before but that was usually when he was in the middle of a panic attack and was switching back and forth between hypersensitivity and numbness.
When it was Anderson being a prick and shitting all over Greg’s muggle side. Mycroft had filled his duvet with playing cards and his pillowcase with old phone wires people from the Slytherin commons had been kind (scared) enough to give him.
He shrugged on his backpack, his school books taken out of it, scattered on his bed, bare except for the thin duvet laying neatly over the top of it. It was the only bag he had, no doubt Sherlock would pick up on that.
“That’s not much better.” Greg laughed, standing up. “Well, I’m gonna lie in the sun, and you’re gonna lie in the shade, and I’m gonna hold your hand because I know it calms you down.” He added, flopping onto the grass where the sun shone bright and warm, closing his eyes.
“Of course you did.” Greg rolled his eyes, shifting his weight from foot-to-foot. “You figure it out?” He asked in earnest, almost like he wished Mycroft had.
The Ravenclaw opened the window, allowing the owl inside a moment whilst he read the letter in its grasp.
Sherlock perked up at that, dropping his wrists to his sides again, not looking up. “Oh? Who was the culprit? I didn’t want to point fingers but she’s been friendly with a few fourth years recently and they would be likely for the strength of the-“
“Your heart beat faster because you were nervous, you like him back, you have for ages. You just never listened to me.” She dropped off the table and took his hands in hers, forcing him to look her in the eye. “Say yes or so help me Mycroft I will kill you before Sherlock gets the chance.”
Greg didn’t notice it, obviously. Sherlock, to his surprise wasn’t reacting like anything was off. Either sherlock was more stupid than Mycroft originally thought, or John was a better actor than the elder was giving him credit for.
He got four laps of the room in, his cane thudding against the ground with every step he took, he was thankful he lived in the ground flat or he’d feel guilty every time this happened. Four laps, to one side and back, before something began upstairs.
He had no friends, he was failing every class, he was nothing. The only thing he had was quidditch, it was all he was good at, all he enjoyed, even his team gave him some sense of company, even if the most he got from them was a clap on the back for saving a goal.
“And she told you Sarah is manipulating you.”  Sherlock noted, eyes closed, trying to piece the reiterated knowledge together in his mind palace. It had taken on a new light, now somebody else had said the same things he’d been thinking about for months, a new tone had been taken on, and new ideas represented.
His mother knew he was a wizard, it didn’t help that she was the only one to know now she was gone. John wasn’t entirely sure how she knew either, he supposed maybe it was from the time he’d made the kettle boil when it wasn’t turned on, or from the time he melted the slide at the park when nobody would let him play. She’d managed by negotiation to exchange some of her savings, so he’d have enough to get what he needed when the time came for him to get a proper wizarding education.
He set the microscope slide into a box among some of his others, taking another sip of his tea, turning to John who seemed to freeze when their eyes met, as if he’d been caught doing something he wasn’t supposed to. Even though he was simply leaning against the kitchen table drinking from his mug of tea.
“Sherlock?” Real John’s voice finally carried through and Sherlock realised he had his hand on his cheek, where the reflection had kissed him, he quickly dropped it and averted his gaze from the mirror and John.
Greg was patient. “Take your time.” It wasn’t menacing, it wasn’t sarcastic, it was calm and sincere.
.” He clenched his fists and squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to relax, almost. “I’m fucking scared, Sherlock. I don’t know what to do and it’s so much
She’d tried once to accompany him on his weekly library meet with Sherlock, after practice. That had been a disaster. She wasn’t dim by any means, quite bright as far as third years go, but nowhere near Sherlock’s level, or Johns memory. In the end Sherlock began to speak French out of annoyance and John had learned to block him out at this point. She had not and left after being ignored because John was actually trying to get work done.
A sly smirk crossed Sherlock’s mouth, as he gave a pale green stare to the elder. “Do yourself a favour and stop talking.” John elbowed him and Mycroft smiled inwardly.
Lestrade laughed, propping his elbows up on the table. “No, he’s not in my year, he’s in the year above you, John Watson? You might know him.”
The hat had taken all but a few moments when he’d been sorted a year ago, muttering something about Hufflepuff and bravery before yelling out Gryffindor, to which the house of red cheered for him.
Considering Sherlock had considered himself asexual from age eighteen, given the sort-of-black ring he wore, he would’ve thought that John killing a man for him would’ve done something.
Greg sighed, glancing up from the table, stirring his fork through his curry. “Do you know Sarah Sawyer?” He asked, and Mycroft eyebrow quirked up, as he swallowed a forkful of his own meal.
It was as if their roles were switched, now Sherlock was staring at John, studying him, more than usual, watching him in lessons, at lunch, in the hallways.
A full on panic set into his bones once he stepped off the train, trunk in fist, he didn’t have the first clue of where to look but after standing in the middle of the platform glancing around him and the ruckus of the crowd blending into nothing, he noticed a pop of strawberry blonde and an umbrella and sprinted after it, ducking and dodging people walking in all directions.
“Sherlock, you know more than anyone that I’m in love with you. Nothing will change that. I’m going to learn more as- whatever
Slipped off might have been a bit of romanticising, it was rather Mycroft glaring at John and mouthing Library, before walking out of the room like nothing had happened.
There had been days where John would flinch like he’d been burned if Sherlock touched him, days where he hated his own skin to the point he would curl into the covers. Sherlock knew just to leave him, save to bring him a cup of tea or something to eat so he wasn’t damaging himself.
John placed his head in his hands, trying not to cry alone in a compartment on the train. He had his earphones in, listening to one of his favourite violin pieces. That probably wasn’t helping his cause in preventing the tears.
“How did you- never mind, I don’t want to know.” John laughed. “It’s still brilliant when you do that. Like magic tricks, you know there’s a method behind it but you never quite know what, so it still amazes you every time.”
“Who’s this, Holmes?” One of the older Ravenclaw boys asked him as they all began to fill into the hall.
Mycroft removed his face from his hands. “Well I suppose I should get it over with. He is not going to be happy about this.” The grave look on his face told John something more than that he was worried about himself. A feeling in his gut told him that Sherlock would somehow be involved.
John was laughing, and Sherlock clicked back into reality again, turning his head from the window to look at him. “Can you believe she got pissed at me for only letting five goals through? She’s mates with the Ravenclaw seeker, I couldn’t bloody believe it, talk about house loyalty.”
“I know, I know. Its-“ He sighed, and John looked up at him. “Look, back in first year, my mum wanted nothing to do with me, my dad was in prison, my grandparents thought I was going to boarding school and I couldn’t let them know about the platform. So, until I was seventeen, I didn’t have anybody to wave me goodbye. Its shit isn’t it?” He asked and John just shrugged.
“Well it’s considerably less dignified to say I was self-conscious don’t you think?” He tried to laugh to hide the embarrassment, but it didn’t fool the Slytherin.
Sarah!?” He shouted just loud enough for the table over to take notice, and soon silence but a whisper cascaded over the hall, the teachers seemed to take no notice. He stood up, face riddled with fake anger, Sherlock said it would fly fine so long as she was blinded by her own rage.
So instead, he slipped both his thumbs under the waistband, dropping to his knees as he pulled down both John's trousers and boxers, the packer going with them unnoticed.
“’Ello?” The voice of his sister was comforting on the other line. John was so grateful she was sober in this period of her life, he had no idea what he would have done if he didn’t have her now.
“It was obvious, you’d go from being fed up with her to down on your knees worshipping her every word like it was gospel. And it always happened over meals, it was hard to ignore. She was putting it in your food. I thought it was rather odd that she’d brought muffins to your quidditch practice once without occasion and never again. She doesn’t bake regularly, nor does she enjoy it so there was no reason for it. Looking into it I found that her sister was in Mycroft’s year and specialised in potions. It was fairly clear from there after noticing the fluctuation in your behavioural patterns that something dubious was going on. ” Sherlock replied before lying back, the book abandoned, now falling slowly off the bed.
John’s head snapped up, eyes wide, blue, filled with surprise and tears streaming. “What?” He asked, not in anger like the minority of Sherlock’s mind predicted, but in surprise.
He guessed correctly. The scarf was made up of blue and silver stripes, it was sleek and soft to the touch, and it was tightly stitched, it barely even looked knitted, but it was, the way he preferred.
Sherlock nodded, noting his mistake. “Yeah, and you sort of shut down into fight or flight mode. You chose flight.”
“You just repeated the same explanation I gave you.” Sherlock replied, John ducked his head, and the younger boy smiled. “You pay attention, you’re thoughtful, you care. What you lack in quick wit you make up for in common sense. You, John Watson, you keep me right. You’re my best and only friend, and you’re the only person besides my own mother and brother to give me a Christmas present, a birthday present. Why would I not like you?”
"You don't know how hard it was, for me to keep my hands off you, having to watch as you flaunted around the room. You're so fucking gorgeous, I was convinced the suit would push me over the edge." His voice was low as he palmed John through his trousers. "If it weren't for the fact you would deem it indecent, I would have done this hours ago."
“Don’t panic, just listen to me.” Mycroft replied, trying to keep his tone steady, even though Greg’s hand still hadn't tightened around his. “Help is on the way, it’s going to be alright.”
The doctor smiled, shaking his head, turning to walk to the doors, where Sherlock was waiting for him, typing furiously on his phone. "You're ready to leave?" He asked, not even looking up.
By the time Mycroft even registered what she said, she was gone, and he spoke his reply to nobody other than himself. “… I know. He always is.”
“Rosamund?” Sherlock called, routing around the kitchen, trying not to tear it apart as he did so, but he couldn’t find what he was looking for and it was starting to get infuriating.
However, his gift for Sherlock took a lot more time and effort, and hours of sorting books for Flitwick. He was lucky that John had a good memory and enjoyed organisation.
John laughed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist, he pressed his head into Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock’s arm found its place around his back and his other hand on the back of his neck, as he rested his head on top of John’s.
Sherlock had brought a book with him to read in order to give John some semblance of privacy, though he did glance up from time to time, whether it was to see tears or a smile, mostly a combination of both. However, instead of reading, he managed to find some parchment paper hastily shoved between the back page from the cover.
“I know the book you can copy from; we’ll get it from the library tomorrow.” Sherlock let out a huff of hair on to Johns neck and he squirmed a little and laughed. “I’m not
“Apart from Ethan.” Philip replied, bite to his voice and the teenager on the other side of the room pretended like he hadn't heard it, continuing to stare down at the notes despite the fact that they hadn't written anything yet.
Eventually he burst out into the opening in the forest, he fell to his knees, gasping for air on the grass, dropping further to he was leaning on his hands, coughing out strangled breaths.
“Some do, this one won’t. I’ll probably just grow it out and cut the black off when it gets too long. Do you like it?”
“Greg got the password off Mycroft for me.” John spoke, like it was supposed to be obvious. Sherlock supposed maybe it was obvious and he wasn’t working at his highest calibre.
“Always.” John muttered, trying to focus on his work and not the feeling of Sherlock’s slender fingers tracing over his back.
“I’m only a call away if you need me. They’re going now, so you best be off.” Greg replied, pointing over to the Holmes’
Sherlock stood up, walking to his desk, pulling one of his drawers open, and pulling the fake bottom drawer out of it, and pulling a neatly wrapped parcel out from it, setting the fake bottom of the drawer on his desk, before walking back over to John, dropping the parcel in his lap before taking his seat opposite him. He drew his knees up, watching John as he looked at it.
John mumbled something incoherent, muffled by the fabric of his clothes. He could feel John’s voice vibrating against him.
This time he gave her a quick side embrace and a smile, rather than a curt nod with a stiff upper lip, he made a promise to write to her over the summer, knowing she’d get sick of the muggle world again after enough time.
.” Sherlock paused, standing up. “ You seem to think more than others, Doctor. Seven o’clock, Baker Street, the address is 221b. Take the umbrella.” He gave John a wink and the click of his tongue, before showing the doctor out now he’d finished his tea.
After a bout of fussing and scolding from Mrs Hudson, and a cup of tea, they ended up in their bedroom.
“Valentine’s day, February fourteenth. It’s a date for couples to be mushy and single people to ask their crushes out.” John had gotten used to defining simple things like that, rather than getting infuriated or accusing Sherlock of faking it, he simply decided to give him the answer to what he was looking for.
John practically threw the money at the cabbie wen they pulled up at Baker Street. He was desperate for Sherlock to touch him again, wanting his hands on his neck, and his back and other places he couldn't even believe he was thinking.
He set down the plastic bag on the floor, rushing to the side of John’s bed, and placing a gentle hand on John’s shoulder. The soldier didn’t open his eyes but made a grunt of acknowledgement to let Sherlock know he wasn’t dying.
didn’t know that he knew every hallway, door, staircase and the number of stairs in the entire castle, save for the ones he’d never seen or been in.
The boy grinned at him, picking up the case before walking over, keeping a distance in his muddy kit. “Yeah, not too bad. Extra practice, Johnstone lets me.”
The trio seated themselves in one of the glass compartments, shoving their trunks under their seats as they tried to make themselves a bit more comfortable.
John gripped the handle of his broom, if it weren’t for his gloves he could’ve seen just how white his knuckles were.
“Uh, yeah, you guys head on, I’ll follow.” He replied, before walking back towards the stalls, hoping to find Sherlock.
“No, I mean… I mean I’ve been keeping something from you.” Greg replied, biting his lip and eyeing Mycroft nervously for his reaction.
“I suppose I could drag myself if it would make you happy.” Mycroft smirked, clasping his hands together. “I want to see you win though.”
. He replied simply, his knuckles sharp against the door frame before he walked down the stairs, quick on his feet.
Once the principal had realised how Sherlock was being treated, after a stern word from Conrad Holmes, he was horrified and quick to amend the damage.
“I-I don’t-“ He inhaled sharply, his shoulders hunched as he leaned into the bar, still staring into his mug like it was the most interesting thing. “I don’t know.”
Some people didn’t abide the rules of the name written on their skin, and dated freely, Sherlock had seen websites for those people. There were also websites where you’d give them your name, and the name of your tattoo and they’d give you profiles for everyone named that in your area.
“I read that hugging somebody your close to can ease stress. Considering I’m your closest friend, I thought it might help but you don’t have to.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and pulled the jumper over his head and went after John. The Gryffindor was slipping down the corridors practically silent, toward a wall.
“Sherlock?” John asked, his eyes flicking to the detective’s lips and back to his eyes in a matter of seconds. The question of his name held so many more words than the only one spoken, and Sherlock knew them all.
John was the last appointment he had, the clinic wouldn’t let him flex his hours considering it wasn’t a real emergency, so the skies were dark outside, and he was sure Mr Holmes would be going out of his mind.
John grinned at him, before realising where he was, who he was, and who the man in front of him was, and he dropped the smile. He shouldn’t be joking, he should be talking and pursuing the information on his daughter’s education. He shouldn’t be marvelling at the nebula green eyes and sharp cheekbones of his daughter’s teacher, nor should he be thinking about him in anyway way that wasn’t professional. This
John handed his gift to Sherlock, it was neatly wrapped with a well tied bow, very different from the birthday presents he’d given Sherlock in the past. He caught the questioning look Sherlock was shooting his way and gave a nervous laugh before replying. “Mary taught me a wrapping spell; it took a few tries, but I wanted it to look nice.”
set his original deck on fire. He was the only one, other than Mycroft, who ever played with the seeker and it pissed him off a bit when Phil had done that. He could’ve sworn Greg was ready to cry over it, but he managed not to. Mycroft looked like he was ready for murder when he found out.
"Sherlock, you worded it cleverly, but even I got that. What's up?" John asked, turning to face him directly.
“Your brother didn’t say exactly what you were missing, so I’m gonna need you to tell me that part.”
“I’m not necessarily fond of change but it suits you, I suppose.” Mycroft replied, before turning to engage with the rest of their group for the remaining duration of the meal.
“Here, eat that.” Mycroft said suddenly, turning from one of the larger and less magical looking plants, handing him a leave that looked an awful lot like mint.
"Fuck..." He breathed, his hand on Sherlock's head, fingers woven through the soft curls. He looked down as Sherlock glanced up. And oh fuck did it look like Sherlock was blowing him, taking his cock straight, as his head bobbed a little, his tongue making circles, sending frantic jolts of pleasure through John's body, and he tensed, feeling a wave of warmth, he was getting close. "Sherlock I-" He cut himself off, by choice, and then by a gentle moan as Sherlock's fingers dug into the backs of John's thighs. His mouth was hot and wet against John's cock, the doctor went rigid, fisting a handful of Sherlock's hair, causing him to moan around his clit.
John true to everything about his character, was reliable, focused, determined, but it wasn’t hard to tell his stamina was running out. Ravenclaw had been able to score a total of five shots, one every hour, almost like it was planned. Any other shot didn’t have a hope, much to the frustration of the Ravenclaw chaser.
Sherlock had been there every morning and every night when John put a binder on, and took it off again, his back turned to the detective.
handed Sherlock a box with Jesus Christ in it, Sherlock may have thrown it out or blown it up, just to see what would happen.
The corners of Mycroft's mouth quirked up into a smile. “Snape would be the last person who would, Dumbledore would be far less discreet.”
There was a moment of silence before John realised properly what had just been said, he paused for a moment to think, and then sighed.
He studied John’s face in concern, trying to find any traces of lying, certain that this couldn’t be real. “And you don’t mind that I’m- That I’m not- That I don’t necessarily experience things in the same ways you may be used to?” He asked, somewhat desperate for the dream to shatter, scared of what might come after if it continued, panic jolting through his veins at all the potential consequences.
They left the greenhouse when the heat became unbearable, and Greg insisted they just walk about the grounds of the house as his legs had cramped from sitting still on the train.
John's chest was beautiful. It wasn't just to do with the softly defined muscles, his pecs and the bare definition of a six-pack. Sherlock didn't realise that was ever a thought that would cross his mind, but it was true; John's body was gorgeous. The scars at his pectorals, deep red and neatly stitched, told a story, showed his strength. Sherlocks scars were bold, a rebellion. John's scars were human, brave. Sherlock rested his hand, the curve from his thumb to his finger resting against the scar.
clever.” He was concerned at this point, did Mycroft know what was going on? Was he keeping it to himself?
“What do you expect me to do now? I have to break up with her.” John breathed holding his head and sighing, letting his shoulders drop, the girl gave him a pity-filled glance.
“I din’t kiss you g’night though?” She spoke it more as a question than a statement, her words slurred with a yawn as tiredness began to overcome her. Sherlock could barely contain a smile, as he bent down again to let her kiss his cheek. “Nuh-night Lockie.”
What it appeared to be was some sort of care package. There was a jumper, a scarf, new quidditch gloves, a bar of chocolate and a quill with a nib that looked an awful lot like his favourite biro.
It was apparent that Greg was now nervous, as he bit his lip before asking. “Uh, this might sound gay or whatever, but would you come to the match? I know you don’t like them much but I uh… It’d mean a lot to me if you did.” A soft blush came over his face as he spoke, and he turned his attention to his cards again, as if that would stop the other boy from noticing.
She wanted John to herself, and she was doing whatever it would take to have it that way. He couldn’t believe John still hadn't seen through her deceit, he thought the glasses would’ve sent some alarm bells ringing. John seemed to be happy with her though, he’d be considerably less so if Sherlock interfered. Sarah annoyed him to no end, always prying into every little crack of John’s life, to the point he was barely one person anymore.
The Gryffindor was hyperventilating now. “I can’t do it Sh-Sherlock- I can’t b-breathe- I just- I don’t- I-I-“
“A protest.” The Ravenclaw replied simply, opening his eyes and looking up at John with a frown, he didn’t understand why this didn’t make sense to him. If they put him in enough harm’s way they had to get him out, and him putting himself in harm’s way as a result of their punishment was their fault. So, if he got it to escalate enough then maybe he had a chance.
Sherlock took his other hand gently, locking their fingers as a gesture of comfort. “I’m sorry.” He spoke quietly, his voice a deep rumble in his throat.
Three dreams, one for every time he managed to sleep. He wasn’t sure why he’d even decided to try again.
John’s shoulders dropped, how had he forgotten something so simple. People made apologies all the time but he doubted that anybody had ever properly apologised to Sherlock. “That’s a really good idea. Thank you so much.”
He looked genuinely concerned about the matter, that struck John as interesting, because the man in front of him didn’t really seem like the type of person to care too deeply about his student’s personal struggles.
“Indeed. The Queen of England gave it to me herself.” He replied, enjoying the eyeroll John gave him from behind his daughter’s view, and the exhilarated grin that now resided on Rosie’s features.
There had been times where she’d been in a phase of alcoholism and their dad had beaten him black and blue, all he could do was cry himself to sleep and hope to god that this was all just a bad dream.
“She sent me a valentine in second year, I ignored it. A few months later and we were dating regardless. Nobody said anything.”
John laughed. “What could’ve given that away? The lack of choice or the charm on the door?” If he could make a joke out of it maybe he wouldn’t feel so threatened. It wasn’t like Mycroft was actually going to do anything to him, right?
“Right, my apologies. We have a library, one that you can actually cast spells in, so if you want to go over anything to refresh yourself, we have the time.” Sherlock replied, in a desperate attempt to change the subject, talking about Sarah was the thing he wanted to
Sherlock was nearly certain he didn’t like girls in general. There had been one in his transfiguration class who was quite pretty, though she was a lot older than him and infuriating in her attempts to be clever. He’d since written off any attraction he thought he may have felt to jealousy, she was fairly good at transfiguration after all.
“You kissed me.” Sherlock nodded, almost impressed that John clocked it so quickly. “You were having a panic attack when you did, weren’t you?” John spoke, keeping his voice calm.
He’d been doing so when a muddy figure on a broom touched down to land, the snitch in hand, and he shoved it back into the box with the other balls.
“John! Mate are you okay?” Greg called as he ran over, Johnstone hot behind him, the rest of the team still in the air.
“You.” The Slytherin deadpanned. Mycroft didn’t know anybody else with grey hair at their age, but that’s what made it so captivating. He couldn’t really understand why anybody would patronise him for it.
"Oh piss off." John swore at him, standing on his toes to press a tentative kiss to Sherlocks lips. They were a unique shape, fitting with John's nicer than anyone else's, he'd fantasized about them, how soft they were. Sherlock kissed him back, harder, impatient. The taller man forced his tongue into John's mouth, and John almost laughed, kissing him back. The genius' mouth was warm, sloppy and quick against his own. He trailed his hands over John's chest, his long fingers moving softly over his hardening nipples.
“You say that like it isn’t.” He replied with more bite to his words than he’d intended, drawing his knees up closer in spite of himself.
Mycroft was seventeen, he was nearly an adult for Christ’s sake he could do practically anything his heart desired. Well Mycroft didn’t have a heart, just an empty cavity where one should be. Here was Sherlock some snot-nosed kid chasing after him, hoping he would answer his every beck and call.
Greg was sat, his face on the table in the back of the pub, three empty pint glasses sat in front of him and there was one in his hand, below half empty.
Mycroft rolled his eyes so hard John was surprised they didn’t fall back into his head. “Forgive my mother, John. She’s just quite pleased to be surrounded by her own kind.” He wrinkled his nose in mock disgust before taking a sip of his own drink.
A few days after that conversation, Greg found himself in Mycroft's apartment, it was similar in size to his but it appeared bigger due to the barren walls, and considerable lack of… Well anything homely.
John choked and spluttered at that. He had barely thought about Sarah for the past two weeks he’d been at Sherlock’s, and truthfully, when he had thought about her, he wasn’t really thinking positively. “I- I uhm… I don’t know.”
Then it hit, and his knees went weak, he broke away, his head dropping forward against the taller mans chest. Sherlock held him up by the waist, his other hand still in between Johns legs, as he pulled the orgasm out of him still. He was shaking, convulsing around Sherlocks fingers. The wave of warm pleasure washed over him and he moaned hard into Sherlocks neck, so loud that Mrs Hudson definitely heard it.
John felt his chest collapse in on itself, as Sherlock stood up, offering him a hand. He took it shakily, trying to come to terms with what was happening.
If there was anything in the world that could make Mycroft run, it was his little brother within a ten-metre radius of his plants.
“And you may also be aware that your friendship with him has benefitted him in ways, mostly social, but we’ll take what we can get. He was generally not very good with people before you began this companionship you seem to have with him.”
It was some sort of celebration for the police. They were in a grand hall, ornately decorated, and everybody was dressed in their best. Or at least that was the saying, he couldn't exactly say that everyone had followed it.
He ran up the stairs, and Sherlock was waiting at the door of the living room for him. His suit jacket had been discarded, leaving him in the night fitting white shirt. He closed the door once John entered, leaning against him as the doctor stared at him with fire in his eyes. The taller man could see he was turned on, he was fidgeting, and his pupils were dilating. "What was that? In the taxi?" He asked, demanding it almost, there wasn't anger in his voice but a different kind of fierceness. He tried his best to look unphased by it, pulling his shoes off, he'd complained about them earlier.
The house elves were in the kitchen, probably resting. Even if he wanted to run the risk of getting in trouble on his first day there, he didn’t know where the hell the kitchens were anyway.
“See that I wouldn’t fill it out yet.” John finished for him, ignoring the furious blush that took over his face as the three of them glanced at him in shock for interrupting, and Sherlock looked impressed.  “The sleeves are annoying when you don’t have much arm muscle. I uh, I used to play football so it’s all in my legs really, I'm a sprinter more than anything. But we’re doing rugby now, so maybe I’ll grow into it.” He laughed, trying to normalise the situation he’d catapulted himself into.
“Line of sight.” Sherlock replied, glancing up at him. “Culprit was taller than her, quite a bit, my height roughly, though I can’t be sure with her laid down.”
before John. He was almost certain Mycroft didn’t count, and even if he did, he and his brother weren’t exactly the friendliest to each other.
“Uhm, Sherlock?” He asked, feeling his face flush red again as the taller man looked up at him, he’d been in the middle of undoing his belt, he stared momentarily in confusion before it clicked in his head.
“I suppose not, but if Snape starts winking at me every time we’re in potions together, I may begin to.”
Sherlock furrowed his brow, that didn’t make sense, nothing had happened that day to warrant an apology. Was he saying sorry for not really talking? That was ridiculous, yet so very John, for some reason that explanation didn’t sit right with him so he disregarded the assumption and opted to ask. “What for?”
“This might feel a bit weird, just bear with me.” The Gryffindor spoke softly, and the younger boy gave a small nod, carefully he brushed back Sherlock’s curls with gentle fingers, using his other hand he put one earbud in. “Tell me if anything gets too much.” He added, repeating the same action for the other side, he felt like each sentence should be followed with a pet-name,
John dropped eye contact and shook his head. “No, we had a fight and I need to apologise. Do you know where he is?”
“I’ll walk you to the commons.” Greg spoke suddenly, now they’d begun walking. He seemed to be making no effort in the slightest to drop Mycroft’s hand, and Mycroft had no interest in it either.
Sherlock grinned into the doctor’s skin. “Bearing in mind you saved my life today, I’ll spare yours for now.”
“You’re my soulmate.” He breathed, eyes flickering from his hand to John’s shoulder, to his chest as the tattoo seemed to spread out over it. The doctor’s eyes were still shut tight, but he wasn’t grimacing anymore. “John?”
The prefect didn’t speak for a while, to allow himself to breathe, and Greg, to his word, didn’t press anything or ask any questions.
“John its either this, or a teacher noticing, and I'm sure you’d rather avoid the questioning of why you tried to hide it, especially from my brother.”
Mycroft nodded rubbing his eyes, frustrated with the whole situation. “He’s very loyal very quick, even to those who hurt him.”
“I don’t know…” He muttered, leaning back into his chair, glancing through the messy blonde mop of hair at the teacher. His friends seemed to find it quite amusing, but this is where things began to get quite fun, he could see how it would pan out.
“Exactly. The same way me and Lestrade are, but if I had to ask Greg for help, I’d sooner shoot myself.”
“You’re learning.” John spoke, a soft smirk on his face and Sherlock rolled his eyes, a gentle hum of acknowledgement in his throat.
“I got hit in the face with a quaffle and then I couldn’t breathe.” John muttered, it sounded ridiculous, but it was in truth what had happened, he was slightly embarrassed by it too.
“Trust me he doesn’t.” Sherlock replied. “Speaking of Lestrade, he needs us in to account for that man we chased, Wade Johnstone.”
Despite the oddities he seemed to possess, the muttering to himself as he monitored the tarmac, or the weird gestures he did with his hands when he stood, John wanted to go up and thank him. Rosie had never been more excited to go to school than when she was in his class.
“Well if this John Watson is as good as you say he is I suppose you have a fighting chance.” He rolled his eyes, smiling softly as Greg tossed the six of clubs at him, glaring. “Oh shut up, you know I think you’re good.”
In Sherlocks first run-in with him, he’d made the deduction that he was cheating on his girlfriend with Sally Donavan. Now he and Donavan were dating, he still managed to find another girl to satisfy himself.
They’d been having this debate since the start of the month, Rosie was seventeen now, and seemingly intent on the nickname she had, disgusted by anything else. Sherlock, ever set in his ways had been annoying her mercilessly.
John glared at him, tears in his eyes, that he rubbed away with shaking hands. “Me calm down? Why am I the only one freaking out?”
“Myc? Is everything alright? Whats wrong?” Greg asked, standing up quickly and placing his hands on the sides of Mycroft's face, which was paler than usual somehow. The Slytherin pulled his hands away put didn’t let go of them, John just about managed to hide his questioning at the interaction.
“What?...” He muttered quietly to himself, trailing off before turning to Greg. “Apologies for that, he can be… Well he can be him, I think that says enough.”
If Greg was here he would’ve noticed, would’ve cornered him and badgered it out of him until he broke. He always felt better after but he needed the initial few kicks to speak up.
There were a few passing beats of silence, in which Mycroft placed his hand on top of Greg’s ever so slightly, smiling softly up at the sky as the Gryffindor took his hand properly, interlocking their fingers.
He didn’t go down to dinner when the rest of the boys vacated the dorms, instead choosing to lie back and collect himself, not quite sleeping again but almost there, if he just relaxed a little more.
John laughed again, bitterness seeped into them. “Why would it? You don’t like me back, why would you? And I’m not going out of my way to lose my best friend.” His voice grew quieter as he spoke.
“Why do we only talk like this lying down? It’s like I get your horizontal and all your apprehensions about idle conversation go out the door.”
“Oh, don’t worry about the formalities.” Sherlock spoke with a dismissive wave of the hand, as if he’d read the doctors mind. “I like to think this is a more pleasant experience than listening to an old bat droning on about the one mistake your child made throughout the year. As for your attraction toward me, you’ll need to hide it better than that. You stare at me in the playground for a start.”
Mycroft frowned at her. “I don’t try to control him, I just try to keep him away from trouble so incidents like these don’t occur.” She offered him the raise of an eyebrow. She didn’t understand a lot of his methods, though this was the closest she’d ever come to questioning him.
John huffed out a breath of cold air, before walking through the doors of the school. It was the parent-teacher evening at his daughter’s school and he was quite nervous.
He hadn't been focusing, reliving the nightmare he’d woken up from, and suddenly there it was, a whole lot of pain straight into his face. Apparently they’d begun doing penalties and he hadn't realised.
John brought him a birthday present again, this time it was a similar thing to the Rubik’s cube he’d been given the year before, except there were more sections, and it looked a lot more difficult.
“No, thank you, Greg.” He laughed, looking up to the ceiling, embarrassment fading from his face. “It’s gonna be weird this year, without you as captain and Mycroft up my ass twenty-four-seven.”
He was glad to have the captain back. He’d gone to visit the older boy a few times in the hospital wing, it was pretty clear to him that he appeared like some snot-nosed kid, tailing after this seventh year. He felt that way sometimes too, but Greg was probably his only friend apart from Sherlock, he always treated John as his equal. His visits gave Mycroft a break to dart back to the commons if he needed or go for a walk, so they were welcomed. But he was just happy to start off practice once again, flying was one of the only things that could clear his head, where he could channel his pent-up energy, anxiety, fear, worry, whatever, into something useful.
“John? Are you okay?” He asked after a moment, John wiped the tears away from his face and straightened up, sniffing, but there was a smile on his face, a
It wasn’t long before Greg figured it out and they were neck and neck, fighting the urge to sleep. Then the quiet banter of fruitless competition was interrupted by a ginger Slytherin with a look of panic on his face.
Mycroft woke up to tension in his left hand, something against it, warm and tightening every now and then.
“Whilst she isn’t the most talented she does enjoy the art projects we’ve done so far, I’m sure you’ve seen her work, her motor skills are better than most which is something to be encouraged and worked further at. You’re a doctor, I suppose steady hands run in the family.” He spoke quite quickly as he looked over the words on his screen. “She’s doing noticeably well in maths, completing the mental maths sheets in or considerably under the average time, with few mistakes, and she can pick up new information quickly if she doesn’t already know it, are you tutoring her?” He asked looking up at the doctor.
Then John did something completely unexpected. Greg expected a wave or a fist-bump, considering that that’s what he was like at age fifteen. But despite being fifteen and full of insecurity, he turned quickly and pulled Greg into a hug. “Thanks, Greg.”
He turned his back, pulling the hoodie over his head, it came gently due to how big it was on him. He slipped his bad arm into the binder, using the leverage of his other arm going in to pull it down over his head, but anything further than that was futile.
“He’s with me.” Sherlock replied, tone dead and bored with them, before turning to John with a happier look on his face. Even though he’d been moaning for the week they’d been off that he hated the Christmas season and all its commercialism. “Morning John.”
John cleared his throat, feeling sickness rise in his throat, anxiety seeping through his skin. “Sorry, uhm, may I be excused?”
"John, I'm starting to question your intellect if that's a question you have to ask." Sherlock smirked.
Because Greg’s dad held nothing over Mycroft’s head, he had no control over Mycroft, his only connection to Mycroft was friendly, was caring.
Sherlock fiddled with his hands, opting to shove them in the pockets of his robes. “So, you aren’t annoyed?”
“Until they let him out of isolation, I’m going to keep him company.” John replied like it was obvious, in truth it really should have been. They were allowing John to stay with him because they trusted Sherlock enough that he wouldn’t hurt the Gryffindor, and they trusted John enough that they didn’t think he was involved.
Almost instantly he felt ill, regretting his decision thoroughly, and threw his phone to his bed, not baring to look at it while he went to take a shower. It was around ten in the morning, Rosie wouldn’t be up for another hour. They’d had a movie night in and stayed up long past her usual bed-time, so she’d stir later than normal. He’d planned to take her to the park today, to feed the ducks.
However, the moment he sat down at the table he almost regretted not choosing Gryffindor, as a fair haired second-year boy across the tables, caught his eye. He was muttering something to the person beside him, and Sherlock cursed his inability to read lips, but he could’ve sworn the boy said something about his name.
Suddenly John was looking up at him, and as if he was poking something dangerous with a stick, tentatively he reached a hand up, his fingers weaving through Sherlocks hair. Then his hand applied force, pulling Sherlock down as he pushed up, connecting their lips again, and Sherlock smiled into it, kissing him back.
when needed and having it feel dirty coming out of your mouth. I guess I thought, I dunno, because it’s
“Yes, this has been great, thank you.” He replied, licking his lips again, and walking to the door alongside the other man.
John had sat up by this point, heels of his hands pressed into his eyes, he gave Sherlock a look of gratitude when he looked up, taking the mug of tea in his hands, and pressing the hot water bottle to his stomach. Sherlock sat beside him on the edge of his bed, slightly unsure if this was alright, but John didn’t seem phased, taking two of the painkillers dry.
“Well where do we go now!? I’m John, and you’re William. Our names haven’t changed since meeting each other and now the only other ways we can test it will make things awkward!”
“I haven’t talked to her since I came to stay with Sherlock, and- I guess-“ John sighed, giving his friend a stern look. “Promise you won’t say to anyone?”
They sat like that for a while. John giggling into his paper as Sherlock argued with the telly. Mrs Hudson popped up to say hello and take her paper back. John found a hand in a zip-lock bag on the top shelf of the fridge.
“I told you I knew.” Sherlock replied, pressing a kiss to John’s temple, grabbing one of his coats from the back of his door. “I have to give Mrs Hudson the rent, meet you downstairs.”
The first was a letter Professor Flitwick had gotten in his third year, after giving his sister butterfly wings, and locking her in a cupboard to hide her, when he couldn’t change her back.
It was nice of her to do so, but he didn’t like the fact that it appeared he doubted Greg with any stretch of his imagination.
“You’re observant aren’t you? Nobody else could tell I'm a muggleborn.” John replied, propping his face up on his hand as he looked at Sherlock.
“I also got you this.” He pushed another package towards him, it was thin and flat, and still neatly wrapped.
Regaining his composition, he decided to snap back as he knew he probably should, considering the driver had practically insulted his boyfriend, intentional or not. “He has in fact, Afghanistan actually. Considering he got shot for your safety, it mightn’t kill you to offer him a bit of respect.” Sherlock replied quickly, his tone biting, and the driver quietened immediately. “Baker Street if you don’t mind.”
Finally, the hat grumbled before bellowing out that Sherlock was in Ravenclaw, and the first-year stood up, his expression unchanging as he walked to sit with his house group. Though his eyes seemed to regain their life, as if his soul had re-entered, they were a seafoam green, incredibly striking.
“Sir, what happened to his head?” Ethan piped up, the timid boy who barely spoke, had now decided to break his character, Sherlock had not expected that, and the filing cabinet was looking more and more kickable by the second.
“For a whole two lessons? Try something more believable, or at least less embarrassing.” Sherlock piped up and John glared at him, he glared straight back, it was Johns fault he was here, if the Gryffindor had been with him than Anderson wouldn’t have even glanced their way. John was short but he could be scary. “Yes, I'm fine, if fine counts a concussion.
The fourth year shoved him, scrunching up his face in disgust. “That a sick image, spare me the details.” Greg winked at him and he rolled his eyes.
John took a breath, huffing it out in a sigh, dropping his head back down to his lap. He wanted to speak, he wanted to tell him, tell him everything, tell him about the nightmares and the panic attacks. Tell him about the words and thoughts that had begun to take over his entire mindset. But the words seem to just catch in his mouth and he could feel that same anxiety building up in his throat, turning his stomach.
“Sorry,” He laughed awkwardly. “This went better in my head. I uhm, I wanted to thank you, I suppose. Your playing, the violin I think it is? It’s lovely, quite lovely indeed.”
John pulled his phone out of the pocket of his shorts, a string of earbuds following. His phone lit up against his face and he squinted, turning the brightness down quickly in case Sherlock opened his eyes again.
“It hurt to breathe, and my breaths were uneven, and I just had to get out of there before I threw up because there was just too many people. Too many people.”
“To sleep I’d imagine. You’re in pain, we’ll resolve it when the painkillers kick in.” Sherlock replied, taking Johns mug from his hands, which had now stopped shaking. He placed a hand on John’s shoulder, letting his fingers linger before leaving quietly, shutting the door behind him.
That broke them both, they stopped moving. All it took was Sherlock to let out a snigger and they were both gone. Sherlock was giggling doubled over slightly like he did when something really got to him, John had his face buried in Sherlock’s shoulder shaking with laughter.
“God dammit,” He muttered under his breath. “Uhm, racing heart, feeling weak, faint, or dizzy. Tingling, tremoring or numbness in the hands and fingers. Chest pains. Breathing difficulties. Feeling a loss of control.” He counted them off on his fingers, his voice growing quieter the more he realised that what he was describing was almost exactly what he had experienced.
“I don’t know, maybe because she’s nice, and she clearly likes you.” Lip-lick, page turn, glance up. Sherlock didn’t even have to look to know.
“Yeah, I just feel guilty y’know? She isn’t even a bad person I just don’t… I don’t like her anymore.” He replied, trying to justify it to himself more than anyone else, Greg clearly seemed to realise it,
“I presume you’ll join us at dessert?” Sherlock’s father asked. “Do play him something nice, despite your constant effort to show off, I'm not sure he’d enjoy Paganini Caprice number one.”
Sherlock sat on the end of Johns hospital bed. The Gryffindor was still in his quidditch robes, but as it turned out, grabbing a sixth year that’s falling from the sky with one hand, is a sure-fire way to dislocate your shoulder. So here they were, in the hospital ward.
Sherlock smiled at him, and his stomach flipped at the genuine looking beam on his features. “I smile dotingly in response, then what?”
Sarah was on the Gryffindor team. She was their chaser. And true to her name she’d been chasing John since the day he joined the team.
“Yeah, did you end it?” John didn’t respond, and suddenly the cogs started to turn in Greg’s head, with all the different possibilities rushing through it. “Wait, did she end it before you?”
It’d been nearly a year since then, so many events, mishaps, close calls, all calculated of course. And it still hadn’t changed.
He knew Sherlock wouldn’t care, he told Sherlock immediately, well once he found a sense of trust in the taller boy. Yet it made his stomach twist when he thought about it.
Sherlock realised early on that John preferred things to be equal, he liked things to be fair. He considered Sherlock offering him to be his flatmate as a favour that would take a long time to repay. Which is why he did most things Sherlock asked.
“Can I have-“ Sherlock cleared his throat, staring at his feet, his curls flopped down to cover his eyes. John hadn't seen him this nervous before. “Uh- Can I have a hug?”
It was pathetic, this staring of his. Either he needed to get John Watson out of the picture, or to put him in the picture more prominently. Anything to stop his brother drooling over him like some kind of doting fan.
“That’s easy for you to say.” John replied, as he got out of the car behind Sherlock, shrugging his bag over his shoulder. “You’re used to it. I'm considerably underdressed.” He laughed nervously, running a hand through his hair in the hopes of it looking like less of a tousled mess.
done?” He asked, trying not to sound to outraged. He couldn’t be put in detention for being awake after curfew, because if so then Greg would be too.
There was just silence, just the both of them laying on Sherlock’s floor, the cold stone seeping through the thin of his shirt, and John finally cracked.
She gave John a once over before tutting. “Oh dear, you silly boy! Right, I’ll have something up as soon as I can. You know what your father’s like without his paper.”
Sherlock needed to change the topic, he needed to distract John before he told anyone. The best way he could think of was to anger him. When John got angry,
He glanced the clock, it was three in the morning. Sighing to himself, he groaned out loud and got up to pace his small flat in the hopes it would tire him out enough for him to go back to sleep.
Mycroft let out a breath of relief after what felt like an eternity and pushed through the crowd before they all began to leave, rushing down the stands to find the Gryffindor ones.
“I try.” John replied with an amused hum, and the soft roar of the kettle sounded from the kitchen. The fridge opened. “A foot.
He could hear his heart pounding in his head and breathed out again, his excitement had been reignited.
Mycroft knew that he was supposed to spend time with Greg, so he did, whilst still trying to appease his father with his work. Truth be told, he hadn’t notice how long he’d stay in Greg’s apartment at a time.
They walked to the park hand in hand, as she babbled on about what she’d read about ducks in school, the sweetcorn now in a zip-lock bag in the pocket of her yellow raincoat. He didn’t really understand her fascination with them, ducks as far as he knew were vile creatures. Then again, she generally had a fixation on all things yellow, even if ducks weren’t, outside of story books.
Then it came for John to take his shirt off, leaving him in his boxers and the blinding white fabric that compressed his chest flat, a stark contrast to his tan skin.
The elder Holmes frowned at John, like he was supposed to know. “Sherlock, I thought that was quite obvious.”
John had always been quite thoughtful, never in the right places if he was honest. He used his heart for a lot of things except his casting and writing. Those were the things he used his head for, even though he probably shouldn’t.
He’d seen the older boy around the castle a few times, usually with his brother or on the quidditch field. Just by studying him for a few moments he’d learned a few things about him. He knew that he was Mycroft’s secret boyfriend and that he was seeker on the Gryffindor quidditch team, he also knew that his first name began with a G, though he never cared enough to remember the rest, and that despite not paying much attention to it, he was quite self-conscious that his hair had gone grey.
“We were both in a state, and I didn’t get to say everything I needed to.” John replied, his voice was growing quieter.
"For what? Having doubt? Stop it." Sherlock ran his slender fingers down John's back, tracing gentle patterns against his skin, feeling the doctors breath slow down as he began to lose consciousness. "John?"
"Shut up before I make you." Sherlock replied, turning to glance at the doctor, his eyes piercing him. He moved his hand up John's leg slightly, the doctors breath hitched. He smirked as he looked the other way. "Christ, I should have accounted for traffic." He cursed himself, feeling John staring at him.
clever. Certainly not as clever as him, the second-year could barely thicken a Hiccoughing Potion. But he had moments of pure brilliance and was the only one other than him to score one hundred in the written test.
“That’s extraordinary.” John replied with a small laugh of surprise. “You know you’d be frowned upon for telling me that.”
“Sherlock?” The shorter boy spoke after a moment of quiet, save for their breathing and the soft rustling of the trees outside with the summer nights breeze.
Making tea for Rosie was possibly the easiest thing he’d ever done. Rosie hated John’s tea, bitterness hidden with milk and no sugar anywhere, so she’d stopped asking to try it every time he made a cuppa. She liked Sherlock’s a bit more though, with one sugar, and copious amounts to milk in the ratio. Sometimes when he was looking after her when John was out, she’d give him puppy dog eyes and he’d sigh and give her a chocolate digestive to dip into his mug.
They’d agreed to sit beside each other at breakfast, and exchange gifts in the Ravenclaw commons once everyone was out for the annual snowball fight. John hadn’t enjoyed it last year and didn’t plan on going, and Sherlock was completely disinterested by the idea. So, they figured it the perfect opportunity.
He didn’t need the laptop now anyway, he was done with his search now, all he had to do was text Lestrade, take the lecture about taking case files and then he could continue fine with his experiment.
“Even coke?” She asked, crawling off John and sitting on the end of her bed so her tiny button nose was nearly against Sherlock’s own. Her deep blue eyes the mirror image of her father’s as she looked at him like a lie detector.
All gruesome, one of them screaming. He’d never even heard Sherlock scream before, so he wasn’t sure how his subconscious could replicate it.
“Went alright, spent most of it with my muggle mates.” He replied. “They always get at me for being away.”
John licked his lips, unfurrowing his brow. “Slightly, I suppose. Why a gay couple specifically, why not just mates?”
The doctor was standing, his hands clasped behind his back as he listened, or tried to, to Anderson and Donavon talk about whatever nonsense they decided was interesting in that moment. Truthfully he should have been worried that spending too much time engaging with those idiots would reduce John's intellect, but he was too busy staring at the doctor to care.
Sherlock scowled at him, mimicking John’s hunched position, his was more for comfort unlike John’s was to hide. “Well then yes I remember. You were with her in the bathroom. What happened?”
John took a seat opposite him, pulling out notes. But they were notes for potions. That didn’t add up.
Greg was yelling something that couldn’t be heard, his robes were flapping in the wind, and his broom was far from reach as he approached the ground fast.
“Oh, you smartass git.” John replied, before yanking sherlock down by the shirt, crashing their lips together in a mildly uncomfortable clash of teeth and lips. It didn’t take long for a comfortable position to be found, with frantic breaths and now open mouths.
“You have two hands.” Sherlock replied quickly and John resisted the urge to sigh, closing his eyes and rubbing a shaky hand over his face.
It was late night, Mycroft couldn’t sleep. Rather than waste the eight dreadfully long hours tossing and turning in bed, he usually opted to read in the living area of the commons. Whether it be on his phone or a physical copy, the words distracted from everything else. It had been happening a lot lately, in the past few months, too many thoughts thundering around his head like they controlled him, not the other way round. He could only rely on Greg for so much, and whilst he did an excellent job of quieting Mycroft’s head down, he also couldn’t be with him every waking hour of the day.
“Not in the slightest, brother mine. Ravenclaw suits you. Mummy will be sure to send you a scarf in the post.” He tried not to smile at the small look of joy that took over Sherlocks face at the idea. Silence overcame them, as they walked side by side, before they reached the door to the Ravenclaw commons. Mycroft turned to face the younger boy, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Try not to immediately get expelled, come to me if you’re considering, and the boy you were staring at is John Watson.”
John gave her a nod, still sort of sceptically. “Okay, I’m listening. But I have to be at the library in like ten minutes so can you- I dunno- turn around or something?” He asked, gesturing to his backpack filled with is usual clothes.
"I know, please, fuck, cum in me Sherlock." John replied, his hot breath on sherlocks skin, his voice sending shivers down Sherlock's spine.
The Slytherin shot down his attempt to lighten the mood, his glare icy enough to freeze a man to the core, but it thawed slightly as Greg stared right back at him. “I'm serious, Greg.”
“I’ve been a complete and utter prat the last two, maybe even three days. And you haven’t said anything, you just sort of took it, and I feel awful. I think I'm just tired, we have the day off today and I’ll probably just catch up on sleep.” John replied, breaking eye contact with Sherlock as quickly as it had started. “So yeah, I'm sorry.”
John had helped him in a way he didn’t realise. Sherlock had always thought he’d be alone, he was contented with that fact, he wasn’t bothered about the stigma, but the moment he met John that all changed. He was no longer content. John had surprised him in many ways, but the biggest was when he offered the realisation that Sherlock was worth loving.
“What and leave you passed out in the forbidden forest alone? I think not. You can’t have all the fun to yourself, panic-attacks, dehydration, save some for the rest of us.” Sherlock replied, mock indignant, before offering a smile as John lifted his head to give a tear stained scowl, with a smile hidden just underneath it.
The prefect took a seat, his face coming into view, lit dimly by the candlelight, and it became apparent that it was Mycroft Holmes. He was known for being brutal, and John had seen him in the commons before, he seemed to hang about with Greg. “My brother, Sherlock, he’s in your potions class.” He spoke simply, and with a wave of his wand he lit the fire in the commons, but no words left his mouth.
He was in his early thirties, and Sherlock his early twenties, their friendship and then eventual romance was unlikely and unforeseen.
It became a bit clearer that this whole thing would’ve been very apparent to Sherlock and Mycroft, they would have known from the get-go that something was off, yet nobody thought to correct him, or let him know that whatever semblance of love he thought he was feeling was fake.
“Okay just gimme one second. I’ll be right behind you.” He replied, running up the stairs to the sleeping quarters, and rifling through his battered old messenger bag.
Without a word, the Gryffindor yanked him up by the wrist and dragged him out, much to his protests and confusion. This was far out of character for the Gryffindor. No reply was given as the shorter boy dragged Sherlock to the secret passage to the forest.
He managed to work up the courage to text him the next morning. Something simplistic, it would certainly reflect his personality.
He caught Greg in the nick of time, dragging him into the dimmed depths of one of the stands much to his futile protests. Taking Greg’s hand in his, he pulled up the Gryffindor’s sleeve, he frowned and tutted before finding his wand.
