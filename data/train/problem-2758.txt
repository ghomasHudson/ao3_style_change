"Sherlock, what would have happened if your pet and brother and caravan had barged in here without your intervention?"
"Oh my god!" Sherlock yelps, clapping his hands in front of his face. He's biting his cheek. Mycroft's face is pink.
"Things daddy won't let me say."
He crawled into John's lap, scrambling, dizzy, wrapping his arms around his neck and tucking his legs into John's stomach.
Major Sholto.
John kisses Sherlock and strokes his hair, murmuring that he loves him, that he is only leaving to see Mary to protect him. Sherlock, in a petulant act of defiance, is sitting on the couch, completely naked. He will not get dressed, no matter how much John cajoles him.
The police force and helicopter pilot are all staying in a small inn under the guise they are acting in an episode of a new BBC crime drama. An exec at BBC Three has agreed to tweet behind the scenes photos to add to the authenticity.
He was still alone in the room. He could hear voices somewhere else. He cried out a second time. Tavis rushed in the room, sitting himself on the bed beside him, and began to stroke his hair. Mycroft and his husband, Gregory came to stand on the other side. His mother and father followed last into the room and stood at the end of the bed. They all looked as if they'd been crying. Weeping.
0 days until JW and SW can get married.
John smiled as Sherlock helped him balance the food on his lap. Sherlock attempted to feed John, but John shook his head, breaking off pieces of fish and feeding it to Sherlock bit by bit. When Sherlock licked his fingers, he felt a pool of warmth in his stomach.
"We must let the world think Sherlock is back in the hospital.  Let him think he's running his plans, the hospital will be a cover for him to stay safe from Mary. We can persuade him to move in a direction, while helping him in what he believes are his choices."
John leaves, forgetting to extinguish the kerosene lamp before continuing on his way, but remembering to tuck his gun back in his waistband. Safety on. His thoughts are less dark about self harm, so he trusts himself to keep the gun loaded.
"Sherlock," Tavis started, as he brought over his kilt, helping Sherlock dress in the layers. As he helped dress him, William worked on oiling his skin. "I know you understand the mechanics, but there is more to it. Do you have plain oil?"
John nodded, allowing Tavis to lead him into the Holmes main common room. A fire was going, but the two men were alone. They sat in chairs opposite one another. John bounced his leg up and down, waiting for Tavis to speak.
Robert knows the CCTV cameras are watching him, watching everyone, so he dresses in his absolute best suit, dressed like a groom. Boutonniere and everything; complete with a nervous gait. He's wearing a blonde wig, makeup to lighten his skin.
"Ssshh, Hamish, he'll hear you…."
Mycroft can't breathe. Who is this man?
Instead of responding to William, Sherlock closed his eyes, allowing the warmth of the fire to tickle at his skin. He steepled his fingers together, resting his chin on his hands. He imagined his stallion, Aidan, and riding him through the forest on another grand adventure. He imagined his tree experiment he had been running since he was eight, where he had wrapped a sapling to grow up tall and strong around an old statute of Ceridwen. He used his imagination to fly outside of his house, this predicament, if only for a few moments.
John looked ashamed, tired. Again, he rubbed the mustache and his leg, "But you're like Hamish. You are smart enough to figure all that out."
Sherlock shook his head, "He's going to want to talk about the case. Maybe tomorrow night?"
John interjected, "Hamish, Mr. Holmes is probably tired."
"Ssshh daddy, I'm talking!" Hamish scrambled to the other side of the other empty bed, "So, should Mr. Detective stay with Daddy and me? He's having a hard time."
My dream
Sherlock pulled away from his mother's grasp and pointed to the kitchen house, "You built a full kitchen house!"
fridge?"
Robert clicks on a laptop, then texts on the cell phone.  In a moment, he coughs, turning the phone so John can read the message:
Mycroft knew Sherlock was right; he was lonely. But he didn't mind as much. He worried about his brother (constantly), but the ache and guilt were less. He recalls his words to Anthea (when he first saw the way Sherlock looked at Doctor Watson) all those years ago, the phrase that keeps coming to him again and again.
When it was dawn, Sherlock caught a link. "Mercrium Insurance," he breathed. Checking other theatres, he located their insurance policies. He couldn't locate all of them, but of the ones he could, the theatres were insured by Mercrium Insurance, Seb Moran agent.
(See the end of the chapter for
are like my son, in the fact you blurt out random thoughts without thinking."
"Good morning, love," John whispered, bending down to give Sherlock a peck on the forehead.
Men come up to them with zip ties. Sherlock doesn't fight; the operative handling Sherlock allows him to look back at John after he talks about Mary being safe. Mary? Who the fuck cares about Mary. Is that a code for something?
"I'm just…apprehensive."
John dressed Sherlock, taking time to wrap his tartan around his chest and his kilt around his hips. John loved lavishing attention on Sherlock, taking his time to pull his long socks and shoes on, kissing his hair and his cheeks as he ran his fingertips down his biceps.
-----
John looked at him, sensing Sherlock was tensing up or upset, as it had been a few seconds since he'd moved or spoken. He stood on his tiptoes, coming close to Sherlock's ear, "You ok?"
"Billy Wiggins, Mr. Detective, sir. But they're basing time of death on decomposition. But, I think he's been dead not as long, because in summer, decomposition happens quicker. I think their timeline is off, based on photos. But I didn't know about sites! That might help."
"Please, will you get in with me? I am so cold," Sherlock gave him a smile, "You are already stripped."
He closed his eyes and laid back in the bath. He'd enjoyed the company of men, and understood them better, which is why he'd agreed to a match with a male. Unlike his cousin Jaime, he didn't feel the need to kiss and hug and touch up any girl that came upon their farmstead.
Sherlock takes John's face in his hands, "You're not a case, John. You're John. My John." Sherlock kisses him deeply.
"Are they kind masters, the brothers, the youngest? Is he kind?"
John leaned back in the small, metal jump seat, looking up at the ceiling, "Jesus, 87%, that's great. How do you figure those fucking probabilities?"
Sherlock stood next to John, not daring to sit with his ribs. He rocked to the side as John leaned against his leg.
Sherlock has been gone with Billy for most of the past two days; Sherlock had been distracted, worrying about his parents, and John insisted he go visit to ease his mind.
Magnussen's mind palace is cluttered, yet organized exactly to his liking. Statues, photos, projectors; anything that can document and solidify his feelings on a subject has paper and an object association to hold onto the memory. An anchor.
"The final act." Sherlock huffs out, changing his posture to indicate pain, grief.
This objective, this mission, was for his brother. He had a target on his back and Mycroft had to use every influence and tactic to move the focus from Sherlock to himself.
As he was nearing the end of it, he tried to blow smoke rings up in the air. He looked over another souvenir, a heart shaped keychain. This was one of his most prized gifts, as it was given from a gay woman who was trapped in an abusive marriage. He'd been able to free her from her husband's blackmail, and she'd sent the pendant with the marriage date to her wife engraved on it.
On an especially sleep deprived day at the clinic, Dr. John Watson had signed his name
"Oh, John, what can I do?" Sherlock asked, taking another step backwards.
"Commander Mycroft and I were planning this for weeks. Mycroft has been for longer; since Magnussen had you on his radar. I made you pay attention to me and not to our planning. I was distracting you. You almost destroyed the entire mission and put lives at risk by jumping in. You will not-"
Sherlock slept during the early morning in fits and starts. As the brighter light gradually streamed through his window, he crawled down to the bottom of his bed. He pulled yesterday's wedding clothes into bed with him. He touched his new betrothed's tartan, rolling the fabric through and over his fingers. John Watson, the late wedding guest, had worn a patterned tartan similar to this. However, he couldn't be exactly sure. The light had been too dim.
Sherlock smiled, "I heard you."
he didn't come out and tell John what had upset him so much.
The National Sexual Assault Hotline is 1-800-656-HOPE (U.S.) or in the UK visit thesurvivorstrust.org
"Yes, I will."
John and Mycroft lead the crew off the helicopter. They wear night vision goggles and their entourage flanks them on all sides.
John shook, his cock jutting out from between his legs, "Oh, Sherlock, you are so hot and lovely. Tell me."
Sherlock laughed, "It did feel like we were married already. Having to get ready, in the same place."
His sides still hurting, John walks up the steps, just a few days ago Sherlock was being carried down. He enters the flat and can hear the painful sound of the song Sherlock had written for Irene, when he was grieving her.
John walked out, and Sherlock could hear he and Hamish chatting away as they walked down the hallway.
The way he was dressed and the hour of night he was out. Easy assumption. He thought quickly.
John took both of his hands and put them on either side of Sherlock's face, "Let me help you forget how cold they are, my Sherlock."
John is awake for the day at 6 a.m.; he had let Sherlock stay in bed. His mind is going in a million different directions as he sits at the table by the outside windows. He looked up at the silly plastic cow's skull on the wall above him. It was, well, silly. No other way to describe it. Why had Sherlock thought to put something like that on the wall? For fun, maybe? To be ironic?
"Well, John, it appears I was partially wrong and partially correct." Mycroft huffed.
John took the condom in Sherlock's hand and unwrapped it, watching his face as he rolled it on the beautiful man. Sherlock nodded for John to proceed. John sheathed him, made sure there was extra lubricant on him, and then sank onto him, running his hands up and down Sherlock's chest as he did so. Sherlock didn't moan or speak, but puffed out air and bit his lip, placing his hands on either side of John's hip, teasing his lower belly. John rose up and down on his knees, Sherlock stretching and filling him. John attempted to copy the
"John, I'm sorry. My objective was to keep you with me. To keep you safe."
Hamish had been gone for forty-five minutes when John caught Sherlock talking into Hamish's empty room, explaining that it was "impossible for the killer to have put vinegar in the sink after that type of cleaner as the combination would have caused a mustard gas reactive."
Sherlock took off at a run, a grin on his face. He was excited by the mystery and the clues. He hoped he was right with where to go next.  After a 15 minute run, he came upon the edge of the first sheep field. Tied to a tree along the edge was a rock painted purple with a green ribbon holding a branch of red Flowering Currant. He untied the rock, catching it before the package fell to the ground, "Sherlock,
"God, Sherlock, I love you."
Mycroft isn't sure when Sherlock began to shut himself off from the world, but it was when they were children. They were teased mercilessly for their intellect. It didn't bother Mycroft at all. He didn't care; his thoughts and mind were otherwise occupied.
John jumped off the bed and retrieved the box, setting it on the mattress. He sat beside Sherlock, his thighs open, allowing the breeze to cool down his overheating cock and bollocks. Sherlock turned his head in an attempt to look under his kilt.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock coughed as he spoke, as he hadn't drank anything substantial for days. He threw the cigarette into the grate next to the other one.
"Mr. Detective, daddy had a nightmare, and I think I know what it was about, but you told me I shouldn't deduce him, but he went out on the landing to smoke, and I hate it when he smokes. His kisses taste yucky when he smokes…."
Sherlock crinkled his brow for a moment, but realized that John was teasing again. Sherlock decided to try and tease back, "You've not even begun to
He looks up and around. No CCTV cameras. Could the Holmes brothers be unable to track him? Surely, it wouldn't be that hard to figure out walking distance from the airport, at least soon.
John grinned, "Let me call my parents. It's not terribly late, see if they can get him?"
Greg huffed, using his finger to push John's jaw and turn his head to the left. "No, you idiot, over there."
"I didn't think you'd be in here. You weren't answering your phone, I looked everywhere. I smelled your shampoo..."
"Yes?" John pushes Sherlock's curls away from his eyes.
Before either man could answer, Hamish and Mrs. Hudson left down the stairs.
"I know, Mummy, but Robert is making himself responsible. He's taking responsibility. Because….He knows Roderick…Well, I don't understand. Why he's willing to give so much."
He spun, and jumped, and twirled. He thought only of the moves, and how to best turn his body to pitch his legs so the kicks were proper. As the sweat began to drop off his forehead, trickling down his collarbone, sliding down his spine. As the moon rose, and as he began to chill, he decided to go back into his home and pass the rest of the night.
John crosses, slowly, to Sherlock and puts his hands up to his face. As John reaches up, Sherlock gently places the violin on his chair. They have stared, these two days, at each other so much, but it's not enough.
His Da cackled to himself, leaving John and Sherlock alone. Sherlock looked down, watching the horse paw at the ground with its front hoof.
Mycroft stops swinging his umbrella and points it at Moriarty, "We return Sebastian Moran to you, unharmed."
The floor moves sideways as John puts the bowl on the floor. He tries to reach for the water Sherlock placed on the nightstand but he can't quite make his fingers work the way they should, and they slip, the glass of water tipping onto the floor. He puts his head down on his arm, breathing deeply, trying to calm the spinning and ringing in his ears.
Sherlock nods. John leaves, exhaling only when he is outside their door, on the landing. He waits until he is a block away before texting Mycroft's locked cell phone one word: "sutures."
"The timing will need to be right. You may need to string her along, to let her think there is a chance...for you two to reconcile. To give me time to work. Stay with Sherlock for now, but there may be a time...you may need her to believe you are forgiving her."
Instead, John pointed to Sherlock's stomach. Sherlock was partially laying on John, and his eyes were closed. The nurse left, and came back quickly with what John assumed were sugar tablets and some orange juice. John rubbed his back as he drank the juice.
Hamish rolled his eyes, "Yes."
It's the Tshirt that was under his army fatigues he'd left at the Greens.
"So, you've never really worked in a theatre before?" Sherlock picked at the beer label, to give his hands something to do.
"Yes, daddy. Mr. Detective is happy. And scared at the same time."
John suggested they take the tube, as it was only three stops up, but Sherlock blanched and advised he'd pay for their cab to the restaurant. John didn't pry, and they sat next to each other in the cab, their pinkies and ring fingers touching.
No need to shock Mummy and Daddy yet.
John turned white, "Did I jump ahead too many steps? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything. I didn't mean--"
"I do not want to ruin your thoughts, my dearest Sherlock, by talking about your brother and his husband, but he's educated me on love between two men. We must take things slow so as not to cause harm. Let me kiss and touch you, let me rub you with this, to get you used to my touches my beautiful husband. You can tell me what you like."
"Well, I don't know how to say this," Julie said, whispering to John, "I trust you, but if you tell anyone what I'm about to tell you I will tell them you're lying." John quirked an eyebrow. Interesting, "The letters have stopped since the Captain and Sherlock have been spending a lot of time together. I don't know if it's because the Captain has been preoccuppied with talking with him, or because of some other reason, but it's odd. I just wanted you to be aware."
Sherlock laughed, then held his side as pain radiated from his ribs and legs. He flinched.
"Don't say that, John. You're amazing. Just in a different way,"
"John!"
John and Sherlock linked their fingers together, watching the sea and the waves rolling away from the boat. John knew he had to commit this day to memory, he wished so desperately he had a mind palace. If he had one, he knew exactly what he'd fill it with. The sunlight on the waves, the sound of a piano playing drifting through the deck, the feel of each other's heartbeat through their fingertips. The different ways Sherlock said his name. John didn't want this to end. He imagined living with Sherlock, being able to live with him for years and introducing him as his husband, and not just his flat mate.
"Is that any better?"
John moved and came up behind Sherlock, wrapping his arms around his waist. He rested his forehead on his shoulder blades, "I know you are a man. You are strong. You are more than capable of caring for yourself. But I love you and I want to
"Sherlock, please."
"Do I seem difficult?"
"John," Mycroft moves close to John, putting his hand on his shoulder. For a moment John is afraid they both may burst into tears, "The Sherlock before you and the one after you are so different."
. If Sherlock didn't get out of this town after this show, someone would be murdered. Besides American Theatre, which was slowly dying at the hands of this theatre company bit by bit.
"Please tell me, Sherlock."
John was breathing, desperately trying to keep himself from sobbing. Sherlock could tell by the shaking shoulders and his clenched jaw, "After Abigail, I just imagined, we'd become a blended family. That we'd get together finally. But Mycroft came and ruined-" He flinched, "Sorry."
Sherlock smiled, "I like him. I'm sure he heard you just fine, he's just getting used to ignoring you, like the rest of us-" She poked him with her clipboard, "Shut up. Be nice to him. I'd like him to stick around for more than one show."
"Jesus," John huffed, "Of course you did."
"And when he picked you up? Or poked at you? Did you notice the hurt?"
"Oh Lord, Jesus, Sherlock," John looks in his eyes, terrified, as he's been so quiet. Sherlock's eyes are slightly misty, but he pulls on John as John pulls back. Sherlock kisses John, whispering, "Keep me, please keep me, stay," and he kisses John's jawline, his neck, his chest.
He remembers, as he rubs his hands on the cool table, cracking his knuckles, the feeling of Sherlock's cheeks turning cold, his color graying as he waits an eternity for emergency services. He is a doctor, a doctor that went to war. He understands now why Mycroft was Sherlock's confidant when he decided to jump off the building and survive. He imagines this is the feeling, peeking over the edge, but trusting implicitly that the older Holmes brother will be ready to put all the pieces into place.
John looked up at Sherlock, his eyes clear in the residual light from the kitchen. His eyes were the color of the night sky, just before dawn, most definitely, "Would you be amenable, if you fell ok, with going on a date with me tomorrow? Hamish will be at his grandparents for the weekend. I decided to burn some vacation I've had saved up."
Sherlock smiled, "Yes, husband."
sleep in them again."
"Sherlock," John held his hands out, palms off, gesturing for Sherlock to hold them, but not forcing. Sherlock took his hands, feeling the callouses on John's thumbs rub against Sherlock's smooth knuckles.
Sherlock runs through the battle plans in his head. Mycroft has some last minute changes (not large ones) that he wants to go over on Sunday. Sherlock is almost positive that Mycroft wants someone else to be the one to shoot Magnussen. Sherlock will not allow that to happen. Magnussen has taken too much away from their family. It will be his hand, John's gun. No other outcome will be satisfactory.
Hamish threw up his hands, "But I was helping, you didn't hurt as much-"
Hamish stepped back a bit, smiling up at both of them. He held onto Mr. Detective's sleeve as he spoke, "I was practicing doing experiments. I've been decaying leaves from different areas at different times to determine how they mold and decay. I've been writing it in my journal. It might come in useful. If someone goes into the leaves, and they are on their shoes, and where they come from…"
Tavis' tone was kind, "It's a joke. Referring to your cock and balls. They're the 'family jewels.' "
John continued smiling, and John giggled when he looked down at Sherlock. To his mortification, Sherlock realized he had accepted a marriage proposal in his nightclothes.
They were sat at the table nearest the window, and provided a candle because it was 'more romantic,' which made John giggle and Sherlock shush him. John then asked if they would be ordering one bowl of spaghetti and meatballs without any silverware, to which Sherlock gave him a blank stare. John then had to explain the scene of "Lady and the Tramp," but gave up when Sherlock argued, "But dogs can't talk! That is a ridiculous idea for a movie."
A few moments later, John shuffled into the living room, bleary eyed but smiling when he saw Sherlock and Hamish cuddled on the couch together.
All of their work, years of it, is coming together. From other sides of the world.
"I'll go first, with what I think is going on," Sherlock began, sipping on his second tumblr of whiskey, "Unless this second drink is going to knock me out?"
Sherlock turned around. John looked, as always, handsome, but his eyes were bloodshot and his shoulder was drooping. He clenched and unclenched his fist in an afford to stop it from trembling.
to anyone. To touch someone's genitals, to be penetrated and covered in oil, even to be kissed and naked all seemed foreign. He felt grateful for the explanation, but he felt even more so that John seemed happy to not pursue his conjugal rights.
John had never seen Sherlock like this. Even when he'd discussed Moriarty, or Magnussen, there was not such venom in his voice. He was shaking, his laptop nearly trembling right out of his hands.
His murderous, assassin, lying wife is lying dead on the floor.
"Nothing, John, I'm sorry. Mycroft surprised me is all. I'm sorry we woke you."
"Oh, Sherlock," Moriarty interjects in his sing-song drawl, "What a cute pet you have. Look at how dressed up and sweet your lover boy and brother look in their little army outfits. With their fighting men all around them."
"John, I would imagine you were shaking with lust, wanting to take me for the first time, but hoping to be gentle. That's all I thought about, was what my first time might be like with you. If you weren't interested in me, I thought about where I could go, who I might pay to take my virginity. I was losing my mind."
"I bet you looked beautiful. With your long curls and your alabaster skin," John stepped closer, "May I hold your hand?"
John laughed, "No, I just thought he was being targeted by some kind of hate group, but you haven't really been focusing on anything outside, just everyone on the boat, so I assumed he might be doing it himself."
Tavis grew impatient waiting for William so he boiled water and filled Sherlock's tub. He scrubbed his cousin from head to toe, pulling out fresh linens for him to wear and piling up his filthy older plaids outside the door. Sherlock was completely silent, ignoring Tavis' attempts at conversation. He felt stung as he remembered everything that had transpired during the day. When Sherlock was done with his bath and all dressed, his headache came back with a vengeance. He laid down on his bed, his arm over his eyes to block out the light.
As Billy turns around, John sees Moriarty is the one beside him, dressed in raggedy sweats. (God, he is so sick of being surprised by this man's face). He wants to lunge forward; Mycroft steadies his arm and nods at Lestrade to be quiet.
"Most people are idiots, John. If you live life with that understanding, it gets easier," Sherlock grinned, his arms around John's waist, simply to steady himself.
John looked at Tavis, "But I do love Sherlock. I love him so much."
He preferred his time alone, his time to explore and run and pick out various leaves and animals from the creeks that surrounded their home. For most clan weddings, he was able to avoid them. An animal was close to escaping, or he would explain how he had gotten lost, or he would simply wander away in the middle of the ceremony.
John marched towards where he thought the the Captain's quarters were, but things were much fuzzier this evening. He had attempted to drown his sorrows in half of a dozen tumblers of whiskey, which hadn't been the smartest decision on an empty stomach while on a rocking boat.
, a romantic one. Were they both the same sign, a fist pointed toward one's chin, then a knock on your chin as if you were knocking on a door? He figured he wouldn't leave that one to chance. He'd type out asking Sherlock on a date so there would be no question.
"No," Sherlock replied, scratching the back of his head, "I do like horses, though. When I was little I would help my Seanmháthair with the flock by herding with my horse. We haven't been able to have horses in years."
"Are you still mean to your brother, Mr. Detective?"
John did his best to wipe his tears and control himself, but then Sherlock reached up and patted his cheek, kissing his lips and as he lay back down, told John, "I want you to be my first and only."
Roderick, trying to be funny, "For fucks sake, we
"Christ, Sherlock, you're killing-"
That envelope, the copy of the pink phone, was his first love letter from his wife Mary.
Roderick interrupts, "My parents don't know yet. In case something goes wrong. I'd rather have them believing I'm still running around Europe somewhere."
John kept a firm grip on the large semi-automatic weapon as he walked, but if he were honest with himself, Mycroft's presence made him feel safer. With Moriarty, it was always a battle of cleverness, will, and surprise. Jesus, could nobody just fucking stay dead?
John stops. He hears gravel sliding some yards behind him. Jesus, is that Sherlock? Did he find him already?
"I don't want you to be in danger." (God, where was this coming from? Fear. Protection.)
"What do we do?" asked Daemon.
John curled himself and the blankets around Sherlock, ghosting his lips across Sherlock's forehead. Sherlock tensed, waiting for John to catch his error.
After all, a disguise, no matter how hard you try, is really a self-portrait.
He ate, and in between bites he watched everyone else eat. Hamish was looking up at him with such adoration he wanted to hug him. He talked about his tutoring, and how they were learning the planets and the solar system, and he talked about wanting a puppy. He was mature for his age, but Sherlock was happy to hear him prattle on about things other 8 year old boys would talk about.
John didn’t pay much attention to Hamish as he fussed in his bedroom and laboratory. He was happy that Sherlock and his son were getting along, though the stretches of silence did worry him at times. He was leaving the sitting room to go down the hallway to help Mrs. Hudson with something when he saw Sherlock and Hamish on the floor of the lab, huddled over an experiment. John knew Sherlock had grown up too fast and was reliving some of his childhood, his best memories, with Hamish.
"You're not mad at me?" Hamish had tears running down his face. Sherlock used his ragged shirt to dry them off.
He'd always been stupid. Brave, in love, wonderfully stupid.
No response.
With a shaking voice, Sherlock replied, "Someday he will hate me. I can be so mean and spiteful. I can't help saying what is on my mind. It's only a matter of time before he grows tired."
"Aye there, 'Lock!" Tavis burst, causing many of the guests to turn and gawk. Tavis looked after the old Wallace side of the family with large, broad shoulders and chest, muscled, tan. He frequently would only wear an old, ratted kilt, preferring to run around as bare as possible, his heavy calloused feet keeping grounded to the stubbed grass of the earth as he tended the flock. Tavis was Sherlock's dearest cousin, and taking time nearly every day to help Sherlock, Mycroft and their parents, Victoria and Stuart. The Holmes family was smart, and as leaders of the clan, their ability to plan and maximize resources was unparalleled. Tavis, with the use of his sheer brute strength, assisted the clan in the use of the barn house, the care of the sheep and moving trades across clans.
"The scotch will warm you up and relax you, my little wee scone, before we go to bed," Sherlock looked up at John with wide eyes, "No, to sleep, this time, my lovely. I've got you, and I'll keep you. Rest a bit, here, against me. When you've got your strength back, I'll carry you to bed."
Like a petulant child caught sneaking sweets, "It was John," which causes John to go into a fit of giggles and bury his head in Sherlock's neck.
body. Use my hand to show me."
dubh falt = black head of hair
Mycroft continues, cutting Jim off, "Mary Morstan and Charles Augustus Magnussen have killed 7 of your best London operatives."
John rolls his eyes, pouncing on top of Sherlock, holding his hands above his head. Sherlock wiggles happily, but he's pinned underneath his doctor. John kisses his collarbone, his neck, his chest, all at a maddeningly slow pace. He wants to love Sherlock, make love with him, as they've been so hurried and desperate before.
"Sherlock," He huffed as loud as he could with limited breath, "I would never harm you.
"See, John, you are brilliant. You keep saving my life," Sherlock was close to him, looking down at the unconscious man.
He remembered everything from those days in hospital after Afghanistan. The pain, the ache, the lonliness. This would be far worse. He didn't know if Sherlock would talk to him, see him, he wanted to die. But Sherlock was alive, wasn't he?
On his couch, Greg was sitting with his children, Emilie and Clara, and Hamish. Reading a story. He was acting out all the characters, and all three children were engrossed. Sherlock felt John inhale behind him.  He knew that if he looked at John, the psychosomatic injury would be manifested even stronger.
Sherlock shivered. After William provided John water and honeyed bread, William banked the fire.  John settled them into the cushions, Sherlock resting on his chest. John wrapped his plaid around him as a cover.
"Who else is a superb actor, John, who moves in disguises and gets the masses to see what he wants them to see? I can assure you, my brother is clever, but he is under 24 hour surveillance. He is at hospital. Mrs. Hudson is with family."
"Well, that's not really how it works," John grins.
Each have a shot in their chest, between their pectorals, to the right of their heart.
After Hamish had fallen asleep on their bed, as Sherlock and Hamish had spent most of the night before awake in nervous anticipation, John led Sherlock to the sitting room and pulled his army tags out of a nondescript box under the couch. John pulled Sherlock down by the collar of his T-Shirt, placing the tags over his neck.
"Yes, John. My John." Sherlock surprises John by flipping them both so John is laying underneath him on the couch, every bit of their bodies touching.
Sherlock smiles, taking the towel and helping John dry off before he dries off himself, "No, right after our wedding, after you were shot," his eyes get teary as he takes John's face in his hands, "You were whispering over and over that you loved me, as you were on the ground, as we were waiting on the helicopter. I….I told you my vows, listening to you, telling me you loved me."
John sighed, and started to pull away, "Sherlock, I told you, if you didn't want to do this-"
Watching John with Major Sholto at the wedding had killed him.
Mycroft runs his fingers over Robert's short, brown curls. He's never been tactile, but he can't stop touching him, "Christmas day? You'll take the brunt of Christmas Day?"
Sherlock pushed his plate away and looked down at his hands. He felt invisible, and wished he actually were so.
There was Sherlock's bright smile; the true one that John couldn't help kissing and nipping at as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock, as his detective ran his fingers through John's graying sandy hair.

John barked an order, "Hamish, be quiet. We are going home!!"
Sherlock was biting his lip. He thought he might burst from a laughing fit, "John, I want to laugh, but I don't want him to think I'm laughing at him. He's so serious. He's amazing. He might be right about the case, if it's the one I'm thinking of, weather does throw off the estimated time of death quite a bit," Sherlock laughed, looking down at John, "Are you ok?"
The DI gave the information and John got off the phone and pulled up his contacts. It had been a few months since he'd seen Greg, but he was hopeful he still was in touch with Molly. She might be able to reach Sherlock.
Sherlock swallowed. It was difficult to speak of oneself in the third person. He decided to go with the description his     Seanmháthair always gave new visitors.
"And Sherlock's phone is blocked?" John asks, biting his upper lip.
John kissed him, gently, pecking his lips, his jaw, down his neck, tracing the path the water had taken earlier. He nipped and licked, sucking a bit of blood to the surface on his collarbone. Sherlock moaned, "John, I thought we were going to sleep."
John breathed for a moment, dizzy and sleepy all at once. Sherlock lightly slaps John's arse cheek, John takes the hint and rolls off of him, laying on his back on the King sized bed. Sherlock ties off the condom and bins in, and with a look of mischief, drags his finger through the ejaculate cooling on his chest, bringing it to his tongue for a taste. John moans, covering his face with his eyes, moaning 'oh my god' as he hears Sherlock walk away to what he assumes is the bathroom. He returns, warm flannel, washing himself and John off quickly, then begins to pick up his clothes and put them in a hamper. He grins, and makes a gesture like he is explaining what an elephant's trunk looks like in a game of charades. John shakes his head. Sherlock grins, still unembarrassed and naked, grabbing his phone to type out a message.
After he had stopped laughing, Sherlock laid back on the grass rather than listening to John's pleas to leave. He had an itch in his chest to keep talking with John, alone.
Sherlock thought carefully before answering, "Not very long, Mrs. Watson. We just met at the theatre and we became friends right away."
As Sherlock tells John "You can trust her," Sherlock blinks. He blinks, as John has seen soldiers do, "S.O.S." Three short blinks, three long blinks, three short blinks. The same signal John gave Sherlock at the pool with Moriarty. The room suddenly fills with chlorine, his clothes are hot with a coat and explosives, and his vision narrows to just Sherlock's eyes and face. He's pleading, reaching.
Today, John was covered in paint splatter and caulk. Mrs. Hudson had moved everything from her old apartment into her room and had sold the rest. Not wanting to infringe on the boys' space, she was hesitant to let any of her furniture or decorations leave her room. "Nonsense," Sherlock had huffed, waving his hand dismissively, "John will be happy to move some of your belongings to the sitting room and decorate the walls with your paintings."
He did not realize how harsh he'd been.
" Hamish whispered loudly in Sherlock's ear, as if translating a foreign language, "Mr. Detective, that's his
, that captivated him. His impulse was to ride up to John and grab him somehow, to touch him, even with the impracticality of both men being on horseback. Sherlock imagined John's shock if Sherlock were to reach out for him, initiate a kiss, or to ask for his touch, how would John respond to his young fiancé gaining a bit of bravery.
As he explained this, Hamish got on the couch and sat next to Sherlock. John leaned forward a bit so he could see Hamish from around Sherlock. The three of them were lined up on the couch, right in a row, John and Sherlock watching Hamish.
into the rearview mirror so John could see.
Mycroft can't speak. John's face- he may pass out. Mycroft may fall forward from the shock of looking at John - the face from Reichenbach Falls.
That night, he realized that he not only loved the work they did together, but he was
Sherlock opened his mouth, then shut it. He turned and looked at Hamish, who shrugged his shoulders, "Mr. Detective said he dissected his first human cadaver at age 10. I figured this was a good work up to it."
"Sorry, I am so sorry," is all John whispers as he jumps out of the ambulance, his bones jarred against the pavement, the shock of the small jump all the way up from the balls of his feet to his hips. He feels Sherlock reach and grab his wrist, feeling his pulse, his skin, just shaking his head. They do not break the tether of their eyes.
"We continue and let Sherlock catch him with his secrets: at Appledore. Life in prison for blackmail." Mycroft spins his umbrella in a wide circle in front of him, rolling the handle in a circle around his palm, "Let Sherlock continue on his path of confrontation with Magnussen?"
Mycroft won't notice the fingertip bruises on his biceps until later that evening.
"John, Sherlock deduced she was pregnant by the signs she gave him, correct? So it's possible she gave him the information she wanted him to see. She is a nurse and you are a doctor. Would something like that pass you by?"
"Come, husband," Sherlock giggled at the pun, stripped his shirt and jacket as he pulled John off of the sticky couch. As they made their way to the shower, they stripped each other, pulling clothes off as they went. John's arm was a little more limber since he'd been up for a little while, and he was able to mostly get his shirt off by himself. Sherlock smiled, "See, we got some physical therapy in!" John snorted.
John laughed. Sherlock put his hand on John's mouth to still him, "Why is that so funny?"
"William, why am I wearing another tartan? Whose family does this belong to?" Sherlock tried to read William's face, but he purposely avoided the younger man's eyes.
"You must think me absolutely stark raving mad," John whispered as he pulled away from their kiss, "I've done it all backwards. I have you move in with us, I kiss you, then I'm going to take you out on a date, all out of order, all very quickly."
"What? IV?" He rolls back into Sherlock's chest, grabbing into him, breathing, willing the nausea and room spinning to slow down.
"I'm sorry if I wasn't to take out your horse. He just seemed restless," Sherlock said.
Sherlock had given Hamish and John space as they'd gotten ready for Hamish's weekend away from home. He was dusting the living-room out of nerves when Mycroft texted him.
Sherlock is dazed as he picks himself up off the pavement. He looks up, around, willing himself not to cry. He's already collapsed; he doesn't want Mary to have the satisfaction of tears as well.
"Americans," Sherlock said, as if that would explain everything, "when they clink glasses at a wedding, or an event such as this, it's traditional that the betrothed kiss."
"Hi grandma! Hi grandpa!" the boy jumped up, wrapping himself in a hug between them both.
Sherlock was surprised Hamish didn't comment on the skull, but kept chattering,"How do I know…if I'm being rude or mean to daddy?"
"No, John. I'll meet you. I'll bring your things. Remember."
Sherlock looked in John's pale blue eyes. He couldn't disappoint his family. Shaking, he pulled the oil out of his kilt's pocket fold. He whispered to John, "I carry it with me. Tavis told me to be prepared. Am I expected to do this with you now? Whenever? To keep you happy?"
Sherlock kissed him, quickly and deeply, surprising John. They kissed, eyes open, their noses and teeth clashing together.
John laughed, pulling away to clip his own tartan together, "I know you can. But I love touching you, I want to take care of you."
He crosses down two blocks, then zigzagging across a park. He's taking the most irregular route to see Billy. He doesn't want to risk anyone finding him, or understanding how valuable Billy is to the homeless network operation.
John waits in bed, laying down on his back, willing sleep to come. He's emotionally exhausted; time creeps by on the countdown to Christmas. He holds up his phone in the darkness, the screen lighting his face. The words, a poem really, are memorized.
He can't go home alone. He needs help getting up and down out of the bed, but he's not sick enough to stay here-"
"Patience, Mrs. Hudson," Mycroft laughs, "All in good time."
"Actually, young man," John said as he took Hamish's glass, "It seems that you need a small nap. After your nap you and Mr. Detective can go back to playing with your blood samples and whatnot."
Roderick continues, "John, I wanted you to have protection and help when you returned to the UK. I convinced Mrs. Hudson to raise the rent to force Sherlock to consider a roommate, and asked Mike, an old friend from Bart's, to run into you sometime for an introduction."
I love you.
Now, in this small, rented flat, Mycroft observes his little brother. His little brother who never fit in, his little brother who never opened up, is now this man who can hardly keep his hands to himself regarding his beloved Doctor. He is happy. Sherlock is truly, dizzily, happy in love and he's doing his best to focus on Mycroft but they both know Sherlock, for once, is less than focused on the case.
"Hamish was conducting an experiment. An experiment that will require us to repeat frequently."
Mummy and Daddy Holmes look at one another, then back at Billy. In her quietest, motherly voice, "Well, sit back down young man, perhaps you can stay a bit longer."
Well, sleep being a general term. More accurate would be laying in his bed willing himself not to go visit Robert in his bedroom.
"Do you really think I'll be good for you? That I'll make your life better?" Sherlock asked, moving his fingers over John's pectorals. He felt John shiver.
"No, but I won't do it just to keep him from guessing..."
Ignoring him, John dresses Sherlock as a child; pulling pants up over his hips and tickling him on his ribs as he does so. A shirt, socks (his feet are cold), and warm pajama bottoms. The pajamas are short on Sherlock, and bunching at his waist.
The group of five men circle around them, moving out towards the chinook. Mycroft gives a signal to move forward, and the tactical troops surge forward, quickly overtaking the five men. John sees a blurry swirl of activity in his night vision goggles, but can tell that they have been contained. Mycroft's plan has worked as he intended.
Sherlock looked at Mrs. Hudson. He was wearing ratty pajamas, she still in his terrycloth robe.
His objective today, in a variation of his Shezza outfit, is to scour the streets of London for any clues on Mary Morstan or her former aliases. He is missing John with a deep ache today, and he's angry at himself for his addiction, so he keeps to himself as much a as he can. He's glad he's decided against carrying a gun; he'd be shooting at anyone or anything.
"I'm fine! I need to see my betrothed," Sherlock grabbed at the headboard to push himself to standing. He was trembling violently and couldn't step forward.
Sherlock went to the front pasture, the area where the wedding had taken place just barely visible in the moonlight. He walked through the dewy grass, his leather sandals soaking in the cold moisture. His only pangs of regret were from missing the dancing. No matter how shy he felt while talking, he always loved how brave and lovely he felt while dancing.
With what they have seen, they do not doubt the resolve of any of the Holmes brothers.
Mrs. Hudson grinned at the little boy and ruffled his hair, "Yes, he's been very kind to me. I'm just his landlady, but I need a place to stay, and he's allowing me to have one of his spare rooms. I am going to go get us some coffees and be right back. Unless, you'd rather have tea?"
"When you accepted the agreement, Lord Watson, did you want to leave right away with your betrothed and start your lives together right away?"
"The ingredients will perk up your skin and enhance the rosiness in your lips and cheeks. I have some rose oil for your skin and your hair. I have some plain oil to give you for bedroom uses."
His love of his life, who he excruciatingly helped plan the wedding of, was on a sex holiday with another woman. The doctor on sex holiday was also stupidly in love with Shezza-Sherlock- but was too terrified to admit it. Billy was close to revealing it all (while nursing a squishy wrist) but the lovesick doctor gave him a look of pure, hair-raising, vile contempt.
"Cousins! We found him. He was back behind the south path. He was afraid his beloved was angry with him for what was said to the old fool."
Even though they did their very best to come back as dignified as they could, smoothing out wrinkled tartans and kilts and mussed hair, Sherlock felt that all John's kisses and touches were seared on his skin so his entire family would see them.
"Mycroft."
"When I was eight," He began, taking breaths between each sentence, "My family's neighbor." Another drink of scotch, "he abused me…he took me and…."
Sherlock woke early, feeling quite a bit better. He wandered into the kitchen and quietly made himself breakfast. When he threw away his napkin, he noticed two packs of cigarettes smashed into the trash bin.
"Apology accepted."
-----
"Are you feeding me up, John? Is it fish and chips instead of wedding cake?" Sherlock's eyes were watering again, and John urged him to drink more water. After Sherlock had eaten some, he picked up pieces and fed them to John. He couldn't stop smiling at Sherlock, even though he couldn't talk, and his left arm couldn't move. He and Sherlock were alone, on a hospital bed, feeding each other fish and chips. They were married and wearing each other's wedding rings. Sherlock loved him.
Sherlock's phone beeped. Forgetting his guests for a moment, he pulled out the phone quickly, rattling off the message out loud.
tartan:
Sherlock and John had spent the entire day unpacking and organizing the flat so they could make it through the rooms without tripping over books, clothes, and chemistry sets. John was amazed that Sherlock was willing to stay around the house for a few days while they all settled in. Sherlock's flat was now decorated with a messy blend of all their personalities: oil artwork of Mrs. Hudson's, a full medical skeleton of John's, Hamish's set of antique chemist beakers on a shelf, and the wall above the couch covered with maps and diagrams of Sherlock's latest case.
John moved closer, Sherlock moved back a half step, "Sherlock, you know speaking about this is hard for me. Think about what I've said. Make a deduction. What you do with it is your choice. If I've made you angry, or uncomfortable, tell me."
"Am I doomed?" John asked, as they rocked back and forth in the back of a cab. Sherlock grinned, "No, you're just lucky we aren't doing these experiments in the kitchen."
John carries his borrowed shoes as he walks out of the guest room; he's changed out of all his army fatigues. He folds them and leaves them at the end of the crisply remade bed.
"This conference we're using as a cover, Mycroft," he states while keeping his eyes focused out the window, "We'll have to use our time wisely."
John watched Sherlock turn and go to the bed, picking up the package. John let himself admire Sherlock's outfit from the backside. Sherlock handed the package to John, his hand shaking. John, completely naked, took it, but grabbed Sherlock's hand, pulling him close.
Sherlock tried to object, in a wheezing voice as his ribs pained him. John's sharp answer was, "I was in the army and slept on sand. I'll be
"Don't, not until we're home. Those are some....things from...another married couple. To help us along. I don't want you seeing them until I can explain then to you."
"Yes. But today I felt filthy. So I decided to clean up first," John paused, moving to soap his thighs, "Are you alright?"
"Sherlock," John said. He sat still, watching the fading candlelight dance across Sherlock's sharp cheekbones, his jaw, his clavicle. He saw his heartbeat, a panicked staccato, thrumming against his throat.
Sherlock grabbed him and pushed him up against the door when they were inside. He was right, nothing fancy, but the bed was made up with a beautiful quilt, "my grandmother's," he explained, as they fought with each other to remove boots, shoes, pants, underwear. They fell into a laughing, naked heap on top of the bed. Sherlock spread himself over John's naked body, feeling across every muscle, every bone, rolling himself over him. He didn't know what he wanted, or how to verbalize it, but he wanted closer, to be with, near and in. He had no idea how to do this or how to express it.
When John came, Sherlock licked at him, cleaning him up, rolling over him again, but front to front. He kissed his neck, his chest, and ran his fingers through his hair. They fell back asleep, stickier than before, wrapped around one another.
Sherlock leaned back into John's chest. He wasn't sure how to convey he was ok with touching John, and John touching him.  He was acting as his doctor, so he had every reason to touch him to asses injury.
"Just muscle, just in case you need me to shoot somebody? Never trusted. Just led around. Why was this whole plan concocted?"
As he was leading the stallion into the pasture, Sherlock felt a pang of sadness. He missed his Seanmháthair. When she was alive, they had horses. She taught him how to ride, and she would've been here to help him lead this stallion. She had been part of an arranged marriage, so she would've known how to behave, and what to expect. She had married a man, so she could've explained what to expect. She could've been there, at the wedding the day before, keeping him from panicking. She may have even prevented their family from lowering into poverty, thus avoiding the need for an arranged match all together.
John shook his head, reaching out his hand, "Show me where you want me to touch you. Use my hand and show me on
As Sherlock climaxes, John takes himself in hand, stroking himself until they're both spent. Covered in mess, Sherlock gives John a lazy kiss on the nose then rolls off the bed to get a flannel.
Mycroft calls Mummy.
Sherlock looked at Greg, reading him. He'd noticed Greg had asked him a couple times during the day how he was doing. Not outside his normal scope of checking on him, as Sherlock's friend for five years and now Mycroft's husband, but it could indicate he knew about John and Sherlock.
Sherlock gave John a small smile, and the nurse looked at John, "Have you eaten? You also need a drink."
His heart ached. It was the night before his wedding. He wanted to punch something, fight, yell. He decided he would work on his wedding vows instead. He thanked Julie and returned to his room, tired and heartbroken. He pulled off the piece of paper on the suit that Sherlock had written on.
They didn't speak. John rubbed Sherlock's back with his free hand, rolling his wrist with moderate pressure to release the tension in between his shoulder blades.
Sherlock slides on the gravel, stopping himself near the lit cabin, knocking against the window. No one is inside, so he barges in. The couch was slept in, food eaten, money left; John. His heart starts pounding. Where is he?
John shook his head, "My impatient, brilliant geniuses. I am certainly outnumbered with you two." Hamish sat on John's lap at this statement, knocking into John's ribcage with his elbow, "No, daddy, you're not outnumbered. We're the three of us, together. A detective, a chemist, and an army doctor. The only three in the world."
The old man in white Sherlock couldn't deduce. He was staring at Sherlock the same way Sherlock stared back. Occasionally, he would look into the distance, scanning the entire horizon. Sherlock eventually grew bored, and went to his group of cousins who were huddled around one of the mead barrels. William, ever bound to duty, stayed at his side, but a few paces back.
Sherlock smiled, adjusting himself on John's lap, "This floor is not very comfortable."
Sherlock grimaces and pushes backwards in pain so he can see the child more clearly, "What are you doing…." It hurt to breathe, and his vision is coming in clearer waves and fuzzy interludes.
He was alone.
As John got ready as quickly as possible, he heard Greg through the door again, "Hurry up, you bloody idiot, five minutes before we have to get down there for sound testing. I hope you at least wrote a decent presentation that won't bore us to tears."
Mrs. Hudson cleared her throat. He was still away from himself, "Are you alright?" He was utterly amazed that she would think to ask him such a question with the night she'd had.
"William," Sherlock asked, sure that his face and ears were flushed pink, "Do you really know nothing why I am to wear another clan's tartan? Is there no information you can give me?"
"Did you want to be matched with a new wife? How did you come to be matched with me?"
John replied, "I think this is sulking," John looked down at Sherlock, pulling the comforter aside so he could see him. He had his eyes squeezed closed.
John recalls origami black lotuses tucked into palms. A message, sent in a symbol. Sherlock is full of symbols; he's in his normal mind palace pose, but he has John's shirt around his neck and his letters in his palm.
Tavis snapped at him, "Cum do theanga ablaich gun fheum!" Sherlock sat back down on the bed, "You were near
The detective moved and sat himself fully on John's lap, causing John to huff with surprise, "Sherlock, let's go to the bedroom, I can hold you there, ok? We won't do a thing. We can lie down and I can wrap myself around you if you want?"
John texted a few minutes after he'd left the voicemail.
(See the end of the chapter for
They run drills. Check on the construction of the fake façade being built by Moriarty. Run surveillance on Mary Morstan.
John grinned, pulling Sherlock and Hamish close. Hamish giggled, "We'll need to get you a matching ring, then, papa!" Hamish looked at his daddy's face, then crinkled his eyebrows, "Oh, I think daddy was looking at white gold. It goes more with the army tags he also wanted to give you."
"You want me here, little brother? To help sell the story?" Mycroft asks, not looking at Sherlock, continues to study the wall.
John turned, stopping Sherlock short. They skidded into one another, "You noticed that?" John whispered, pushing his hair out of his eyes.
John decided to try physical seduction. He wandered the flat in his towel, wet from the shower. Being the horndog trash that he was, he broke into the bathroom while Sherlock was brushing his teeth. While wearing only pants, John stretched himself over the sink, reaching over for something he didn't need, just so Sherlock could get a good view of his arms, back and arse.
They break eye contact when Mycroft walks over to the smiley face on the wall, "Your wallpaper is peeling here, brother mine, you may want to take a look at it."
Sherlock chuckled, squeezing John's fingers, "Yes. That part is also brilliant," he brought John's hand up to his lips and kissed it gently, "I've always wanted to be a pirate. I figured when we find whoever is doing we can make them walk the plank."
"Is he here, John?"
If John had received the text
Hamish smiled brightly at them, sitting in a chair across from them, swinging his legs, "This is where the clients sit."
Swimming normally calmed John, but today he was doing it so he could escape the endless loop in his head.
Sherlock looked into his face.
"And the detective and his doctor get their happily ever after."
Sherlock sat him on the bed and then went over to a dresser near a window. The room was large and bright, John estimated it to be nearly the size of the living room they'd briefly walked through. John could clearly see him as he finished stripping, his back to him, as he unashamedly dug through a drawer. John watched even more gorgeous tattoos come into view. A beautifully muscled back that tapered into a slim waist and gorgeous arse and legs. John wishes he could yell across the room and tell him, but instead, he finished taking his clothes off himself and looked up
Sherlock put his hand up. John recalled when they were in Magnussen's building, and Sherlock shushed John as he proposed to Janine through a security camera. Was this all fake, and now he felt guilt? Had he just been playing a role the entire time, and there was no longer any need for the ruse?
"I told you our families' plaids would look beautiful on the floor together," John whispered, rolling Sherlock close to him as he pulled the comforter over their shoulders. Sherlock shivered as he felt John's shins and feet rub against his. He giggled, "Yes, John, but now that we are naked, I realize how cold your feet are."
"Mycroft, do you have any trace on Hamish and Mrs. Hudson?" He was begging in his mind, they had to be found. He had to be okay.
"How does one interpret from a hearing person in sign language if you're Deaf?" John's eyes flitted from Sherlock back to Greg, "I mean, I don't get it. If he's Deaf, how does he know what's being said in order to interpret?"
"Of course it's your business," John sat up, pulling himself up against the headboard, and adjusting Sherlock so he was tucked up against his hip. He put his arm around him, stroking his hair, "I don't think I was in love with him, looking back on it. I thought I loved him, but he thought of me more as a distraction," he ran his fingers through his hair, then up and down Sherlock's side, "I haven't known you long, but I like you. I don't just fuck boys and leave them. Unless this is all you want?"
As they ate, Elias Openshaw began to talk. He discussed the pride he felt at officiating the first same sex wedding onboard the Baetica. He beamed at Sherlock and John as he lifted his flute of mimosa, "To Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. It is an honor to see you finally married, and on our ship, no less."
"Ok. Let's discuss the first couple of scenarios. Then I need to get back."
Sherlock tucks his nose into the crook of John's neck. He wills himself to calm his breathing, his heart rate, his shaking hands.
At this, Sherlock sniffles, John puts his arm around his shoulders.
Sherlock looked down at his tartan, the pattern of which was different from anyone else at the wedding.
"We can be quiet."
As he came out of the pool, Julie waved at him. He was self conscious about his scar, but he figured he wouldn't see her again after this trip, "What can I help you with?"
John feels fingers in his, arm around his shoulders, whispers in his ear, "It's ok, I've got you," Sherlock holds him tightly too him, supporting him up, "This is the only way, she's too dangerous."
"I don't see how that involves asking
"Please. I've forgiven you," Mummy Holmes says, reaching across Billy's lap to pat Daddy Holmes on the knee.
John makes sure to keep the ammunition clip out if the gun.
Dangerous.
"Oh baby, I'm yours-"
"Robert, please. What has he said?"
, I don't have a fire going with water on the hearth," He explained, pouring water from the pitcher onto the rag, coming to bed to gently run it over Sherlock's arse, bollocks, thighs, fingers, and stomach. John then used the rag on himself, then used another to dry them both.
"No John, no alcohol for you." Sherlock chastises, bopping him on the nose with his index finger. John remembers Janine sitting on his lap, and Sherlock in a similar pose with her.
The only sound is the exhale of John's breath lightly tickling Sherlock's nape curls.
Sherlock had never seen a more thunderous, dangerous look on a man's face.
Sherlock wonders what John is dreaming, with his eyelashes fluttering and his hands making small movements. He isn't sure if petting John's head is helping, but it gives him something to do while he sleeps. He memorizes the smile lines on his face, the tan lines on his neck, his longer bit of sandy, gray hair that is curling just behind his ear. Sherlock takes his fingertip and runs it along the back of John's left ear; the skin is soft there. John giggles.
John smiled at this, looking out over the clouds and small fields below.
When he raised his head, Sherlock saw John's eyes were partially closed and his mouth was open. He flicked his tongue out and licked his lips.
"Show me." John demanded, grabbing their towels, throwing them on the floor. John did his best to grab Sherlock's waist and pull him close so they were touching, chest to pelvis, and reached up to cup his face with his palm. John loved this man. Had loved him for years. They'd waited enough.  John grabbed his hand, pulling him into their bedroom. Sherlock protested, but John shushed him with a passionate kiss as he pulled him into the room and laid him on the bed.
John pushed the door open, leaving Daemon and Sherlock on the sidewalk. Sherlock went to follow, but was stopped.
John pushed back, leaning up, kissing his mouth deeply, "I am especially sorry for you, as I knew what I was getting into, going into a war zone. You didn't ask for this to happen to you," he ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair again, "Are you ok, laying down in bed with me, while we talk?"
"My grand nephew may be an arranged marriage to you, Lord Sherlock Holmes, but he's a good boy. I'm hoping it will turn into a love match over time."
One of the firemen carried a huge bag, a jaws of life and a car saw. John didn't understand. Why did the firefighter have a saw? The EMTs held onto Anderson, his head lolling to one side. The firefighter turned on the saw. As he turned his body, John saw what the firefighter was after.
Sherlock nodded his head, "Ok, Ok, let me get you some-" Sherlock's hand was shaking and he nearly collapsed when he stood up to walk over to it. John tried to reach for him but he couldn't move his arm, and he couldn't say anything to comfort him. John hit the nurse call button on the side of his rail. A nurse came quickly, running to John's bed at first, then to Sherlock when he noticed him stumbling. He came and wrapped his arm under Sherlock, leading him back to the bed. John wished he could speak, to ask for food, to take care of Sherlock as he had always had done, but he couldn't.
Greg clapped his shoulder and left him to go to the interpreters and talk with Molly. John waved goodbye and went another direction. He knew part of his boredom was his work. He was going to change that immediately.
In Sherlock's flat, she continued to wander and circle the living room, touching every surface, fingering all of Sherlock's possessions. His eyes followed her.
"Fight for me, then, because I think, I think I've been falling in love with you, too," Sherlock ran his thumb over John's lower lip, and cradled his face in his right hand, "But Mrs. Hudson promised I'd take her out for brunch. Then she texted
John had given Sherlock a pointed glare. Sherlock then wrapped his arms around John, whispering promises to make it up to him with the
John yawns, "No, is there a hotel, or anything, here?"
"Er," Sherlock stuttered, the gift paper crinkling more in his hands, "What I bought you is an outfit. I was planning on laying it on your bed but you, uh, messed up the order of the surprise by showering first."
John pulls back, pushing Sherlock's hair from his eyes, "Sherlock, my love. Where is this coming from?"
He begins his dig into the past of Robert Westlin. (Oh, Mycroft. What pressure points?)
In the silence, he let his mind wander. From the first meeting at Bart's, to them agreeing quickly to share a flat, to John shooting a man for Sherlock within days; everything between the two men had moved at a breakneck pace.
Billy holds his head up high as he walks. He's been put in charge. He's never been put in charge of anything in his life, and he is taking this as seriously as the days he was assigned to guard Sherlock Holmes on the 'Case of the Undercover Junkie.'
Sherlock woke to a wet pillow and crusty hair that stuck up at all angles. His last thought from the night before had been his heart to heart discussions with John, and then a quick fall into blissful sleep.
Sherlock was ready to explain it, just small pieces (only lies have details); A shot. Grazing the liver. Then running around, not taking care of himself, staph infection on top of blood poisoning, HEP B from prolonged unsafe IV drug use. Perfect cocktail for a slow, fatal liver degeneration.
"You've seen me. You've seen me dance, and not made fun of me. You've seen me ill, and you've cared for me. You've seen that I'm different, and you don't hate me for it, or think I am odd, in fact, you tell me that's why you love me. You see me as I am, and you love me. I want to know you better. I want to be with you, in every way I can be. I want to be your husband. Of course I want to marry you," without waiting for his father, Sherlock took the handfasting cloth and grasped John's forearm with his left hand, John's forearm resting on Sherlock's, John's hand grasping Sherlock's left elbow. Sherlock felt the cool rock and the sinewy cords of both their bracelets. Each man used their right hand to wind the cloth around their clasped arms. As the cloth was wound around their forearms, Sherlock continued, "I want you with me, John. To be by your side, forever."
"Well, I mean it's not where most 8 year olds would spend their time-"
He called Mycroft, and made Mrs. Hudson sit down and drink honeyed tea.
"Well…ok. So I wasn't handsome, not typically so, I wasn't fit, blonde haired, blue eyed, rugby player type," Sherlock gave a flit of his chin to gesture at John. John laughed.
Reading aloud again.
John looked up. The other man was perfectly still, hands clenched, ready to spar. John couldn't help smiling, "That is amazing. Absolutely brilliant. How could you possibly know all that about me? Or my sister? That's fantastic. Genius."
"When this is over, all over, I will marry you."
"We were wrong. Anderson wanted fame, and so he'd sought it, being driven to the idea from the Amadeus play he'd acted in and from the other accidents that actors had been involved in. He would make himself become injured on a set piece, this setting another Moriarty investigation into motion. Bringing attention to the theatre and show. Bringing attention to Anderson. However, he miscalculated the sturdiness of the rigging, and inhaled himself, bleeding out rather than simply becoming injured. I have photos from his personal effects."
Sherlock was surprisingly able to roll over quickly, "Here, let me talk to him. Wait here." Hamish helped pull him up to a sitting position, and Sherlock went to the back patio, which in reality was the fire escape. The minute he opened the back door John tried to quickly snuff out his cigarette.
As he sat down gently to nurse his injured toe, Hamish and John came running out of the bathroom. Both father and son were stripped to the waist wearing only towels, their faces were covered in shaving foam.
"Lestrade?"
John was behind him, then, holding his head in his lap. Sherlock tried to sit up so he could properly fit his whole body on John's lap, crawling up to gain leverage with his feet. His limbs weren't responding. He felt the grass on his toes and fingers, but he felt tired. He heard Tavis' voice.
Sherlock didn't give them a chance to do either one.
Sherlock, however, was heartbroken. He didn't understand why he wasn't liked, why kids hated how he knew everything, and why he didn't understand girls. It was maddening. He did his best to imitate Mycroft in this; not caring, marching along and explaining he was really a sociopath. Mycroft is not sure where that idea popped in his head, but he never corrected him.
John feels along the bed, grabs Sherlock's arm. Sherlock is tucked in behind his back. The room is dark when he opens his eyes. His eyeballs move to search the room and dizziness forces him to rollover nearly on his stomach. His forehead comes in contact with Sherlock's hastily placed forearm over John's right bicep.
Sherlock watched John. He quivered, oscillating near the scaffolding, looking up at it from the stage, as he measured out the distance between sections with his fingers. The company watched, silent.
Sherlock laughed as John deposited him in a chair. He took a piece of plaid, dipped in cold water from the basin, and knelt between Sherlock's legs. He wiped him clean, grinning up at him, tickling his knees.
"Jim Moriarty's full time business is performance accident and death insurance. He's a businessman. These accidents are good for business."
Sherlock had blushed as John fumbled through his locks, hissing as John's thick fingers caught on tangles. He over-oiled Sherlock's hair, causing it to drip thickly into his eyes and onto his shoulders. William had huffed with impatience, "You're going to drown him in it!" But he acquiesced to John's wishes, standing back and guiding him in the placement of all the decorative beads, the interspacing of braids, and curling his locks by using his fingers.
He's never thought of himself as a coward, but with Sherlock he has been. Has been for years. Over the past few months he's circled around what he's wanted to do, what he longs to say. He backtracks, he stops and starts, he reaches out to touch but moves his hand back. He wants, desires, aches, pines, but he does it alone. He would rather keep him close, as something less than what he wants, than lose him all together. Losing him again, or choosing anyone else over him again, would kill him.
John faced Sherlock, "If this makes you uncomfortable, we don't have to. I don't want to risk anything with you."
"I won't live without you, John, I won't. You have to live."
John wants to ask but it feels too close to his actions. He knows it's not "human error." It's what he's wanted and couldn't say, couldn't bring himself to say, and he's saying it now. Keep the nerves and heartbeat and clandestine meetings easily explainable.
He wonders if she would change anything if she knew today was her last day alive.
"Oh, you'll get your turn. You're so fucking hot. I want to watch you, my virgin. Touch yourself. Show me."
"What are you two up to?" John sat down and gave Sherlock and Hamish a hug. Sherlock's arm was over the back of the couch. John put his arm next to his.
Sherlock couldn’t speak. He wrapped his arms around the midnight black neck and squeezed.
Their breathing slowed, and they continued to sleepily kiss each other, awed and thrilled that they were together, in the same bed. The silence was broken when Sherlock heard his phone going off. He attempted to throw it across the room, but stopped when he saw the message pop up.
reached a long arm up over his head, and pulled an album down.  “We will have to sit at the table,” he told Siger, giving the boy time to prepare for his

“Siger?” John nodded toward the mobile held uncomfortably between his shoulder and ear.
“And so,” his
“Wait!”
Daddy hummed.  Then he asked, “What type of skeleton?”
was pushing the stroller, and Mrs. Hudson could not carry Siger anymore, because she had a hip. Siger had asked Daddy about it, because Siger’s stuffed skeleton, which had all of the bones in a human - and Siger and Daddy and
And now?  Now Sherlock found himself tending to his own children’s mops.  Siger’s was a halo of red curls.  Or it had been for so long, until Siger demanded a trip to the barber.  Rosalind’s brown tresses had been enjoyable to brush and braid.  Until.   Until Ross had declared that long hair got in the way.  She’d talked Miranda into cutting it off with her father’s surgical shears.
Meanwhile, the child in question continued to make a statement of his own.  “Fear not,” Siger repeated.  “That is what the angels say.”
The good doctor had prepared a completely (he was sure) unecessary shopping list for his brother-in-law’s household.  Once those things were taken care of, John Watson began to read.  He was a surgeon, a veteran of the army, and used to dealing with trauma.  Even though that included working with infections sweeping through hospitals, epidemics were not his speciality.
Takeout, then.  Which was all well and good.  Siger wanted Thai, “Tom Yum, please!”   Ross glimmered at him “Samosas!”  Miranda, who hovered about like a hummingbird, but rarely shouted, pointed at the freezer and asked, “Ice lolly?” John looked again into the freezer, which was bereft even of ice, let alone lollies.  He reset the ice-maker and moved the plastic bin back underneath it.
When John climbed out of the car at two hundred twenty one b, Baker Street, after he thanked Declan, he took a moment to observe.
“Sherlock Holmes!” John choked.
“I think that’s going to be the biggest conspiracy theory,” John admitted.  “Newest novel coronavirus from China.  They’re keeping information under tight wraps though.  It’s not showing up in the journals, or on the news.”
Since it is no longer actual Advent, I've taken the 2019 off.  Left the word as a title, because it means the arrival of something.  Some of you have, of course, already picked up on the canon (and not so canon) elements.
First things first.  Mrs. Hudson’s flat would have to be completely redone.  He didn’t think there was structural damage to any of the house other than Speedy’s, but the smoke and water damage in the flat was considerable.  Suitcase from the closet, he dragged damp, smoky undergarments from the dresser, adding what necessities and clothing he thought Mrs. Hudson would appreciate.  A quick trip to the kitchen, and Sherlock retrieved an item from Mrs. Hudson's arsenal, tucking that in among the polyester.  He knelt down and pulled the case containing her soothers from under the bed. The suitcase and case he stood in the front hall before climbing the seventeen steps to 221B.
huffed at Daddy, not Siger.  “Because,”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John Watson smiled up at their landlady.  Waving Siger over he asked, “Do you need any help, Siger?”
Sherlock’s focus on John vanished, and John knew the man was in his Mind Palace. There was time for John to give a sigh, hoist himself out of the chair, and fix two mugs of tea - one milky, one disgustingly sweet.
“I’ll drink yours,” John offered.
“We have done.  We’re giving her a lovely cashmere scarf and glove set - since she loses her gloves every year,” John told him.
Unfortunately, Mycroft couldn’t find any article of clothing there that matched the exact colour of his nephew’s new tie.  He admitted this with a sigh, as it was inevitable.
“I expect,” Greg echoed Mycroft, “That John will think that Sherlock’s got the height of fashion sense.”
“With his ill-gotten gains,” Ross put in.
The moving van swerved ‘round a corner, and the doctor rolled to keep from falling on Ross. His stomach rolled a bit in the opposite direction, loudly announcing its decision to be queasy.  Just what he needed now.  It took some moving to brace himself, feet against one row of metal cages and back toward another set, and hold onto Ross as the van drove on.   Ross was quiet, silent even, which wasn’t Rosalind at all.  She was ordinarily such a chatterbox - for all that she was not speaking yet - John was torn between gratefulness that she wasn’t fussing, wasn’t crying, or panicking, and worry that something was wrong.  Well, something other than that they’d been kidnapped.  And for what?  What was going on?  There wasn’t even a case on, so far as Dr. John Watson was concerned.
Turning back to the children he said, “Your father is very bad at lying, anyway.  Remember that lying is a tool that we use much like picking pockets or opening locks.  We do not use it against family members.  Honesty, even if it is difficult, or leads to problems, is usually the best policy.  Your father prefers not to hurt people’s feelings.  But you will have noticed that he is very careful not to outright lie when responding to others.  For this, as in all things, you need to observe, not just see.”
Siger hastened to do his father’s bidding.
A vigorous nod from the shaggy, bearded balloonist - a former Marine according to Sherlock’s comment when he vaulted into the basket and commandeered the transport.  John had only just managed to scramble up behind before they were off.  Leaning from his station in the crowded basket, the man closed the distance to shout to John Watson, “He don’t know what he’s doing.  We’ll get him quick enough.”  He seemed awfully keen on the whole "chasing someone in a balloon" thing.
“My minions?  They were a gift from John,” Mycroft told his brother with a bland smile.
He could see that question startled his uncle.  Uncle Mycroft said, “Siger, I have no answer for you.  That is a question you must ask your
Daddy was hushing Miri, “There, Miri Cat, it’s alright, your daddy has you.”
Miri chimed in, “The other kids do it.  Evangelina does.  It makes her special.”
“John.  We’re already going to his house for Christmas dinner.  We have the photograph of the children with Father Christmas wrapped and ready for Siger to give to him.  We’ve got the marzipan ornaments for him and for Lestrade.  What else do we need to do for my brother and his husband for the season?” The reasonable words were delivered in a grumbling tone.
A dark, curly-haired head popped around the corner of the kitchen.  “Don’t be ridiculous, John.”  As it disappeared back out of sight, the doctor heard, “We watched the movies with Bert.”
Siger was concerned.  Ross was always excited by animals.  Even
John seated himself carefully on the small, child’s bed - all crisp white sheets and a piratical crimson wool blanket.  He bounced a few times.   “How did your parents manage that?”
“That,”
rats were fascinating to her. Meanwhile he answered Miri.  “Yes.  Sheep say ‘bah’,” and Siger gave a surprisingly good imitation of the sounds coming from the pen.  Miri began to talk, not to Siger, but to the sheep.  The sheep’s concentration was elsewhere, but that did not stop her.  Siger did not feel the need to translate for the sheep.
Siger’s Daddy, who had offered tea, brought in mugs for the men.  “There you go Tom, Ben.  That tree looks lovely,” John Watson told them.  “The greens did well too,” the doctor indicated the decorations on the mantel and out the doorway to the stairwell.
“Of  course I did.  Treasure Island for one.  Whom do you think read it to Sherlock for the first time?”

“Daddy doesn’t want me to leave the couch,” Siger said sadly.  Then he added, “I don’t like the flu.”
Now, where had his son gone?  Sherlock found him in the foyer, holding a number of letters, and shouting through the letter box to the postman.  “Thank you, Mr. Phillips.  We are sick.  Grammy Hudson has the flu.  Everyone has the flu.  Except for me and
Eyeliner.  That was an odd and disconcerting feeling.  Sherlock had second thoughts about the false eyelashes when his spouse made a decidedly unhappy noise and bared strong teeth at him.  Mascara.  Even odder than the eyeliner.  There.  Then Sherlock messed about with his eyebrows a bit, and they were almost done.
“Yes.”
John gave a grumbling laugh while fighting his way out of the binding sheets.  Three small, distinct taps sounded at the wood of the bedroom door.  “Come in, Siger,” Sherlock called from where he was reclining and watching his husband with a grin.
“Yes,” John encouraged, “Ross would be a good nickname, a short name, for Rosalind.  But what,” and the man stopped.  He was at a loss on how to convey the concept of an endearment.
, and Siger closed his eyes as his father closed off the light.
held Siger up so that he could put the new cards up on the Christmas Card shelf.
There are few more compelling odors than roasting meat.  Cooking does more than kill parasites and bacteria.  It caramelizes, makes fat and protein sweeter, their flavors stronger.  It appeals to the body of omnivore and carnivore alike.
“Muh-n-ting,” Joy printed precisely on the page marked ‘Uncle John’s Swears’.
Seeing his father’s cocked head, Siger explained, “They lured the geese with curried cauliflower.  It must have been leftover.”  Turning to Mr. Gurdy he asked, “Do geese eat cooked vegetables?”
Sherlock Holmes made a sound of disgust.  Siger, being the good hearted and helpful brother he was suddenly spoke through the kitchen doorway, “I don’t think so.  At least, you didn’t have that stuff on your face when we went in at the gate.  Nor on the playground later.  School has a rule about makeup, just like the one about gum, and toy weapons, and nobody’s supposed to even bring it onto the grounds.”
Sherlock Holmes gave him a nod of agreement just as a sleepy wail floated down the stairs and echoed through the monitor. Standing, and without a backward glance at John, he ascended the stairs quietly. John watched him exit the sitting room, and said nothing.
Or perhaps he started it all months before that when he helped an elderly neighbor who had fallen while trying to carry groceries up her front steps.  Her cries for help had been heard by a young professional who lived downstairs from her, and who had sent his daughter for Dr. Watson.  John suspected that Mrs. Brewer had broken her hip.  He sat with her while they waited for the ambulance, and kept her immobilized and calm.  Mrs. Brewer had been very grateful, but after John’s diagnosis was found to be accurate, had given up the flat and gone to an assisted living establishment after getting out of hospital.
“I believe you,” John told the man.
Takeout would not do much for tomorrow morning when John would be sweetly encouraging his and Sherlock’s children, and his mad spouse, to eat a healthy breakfast before school.  “Right,” he said, “We’re off to the shops.”
Because it was a given that Sherlock Holmes had deleted most works of literature unless they pertained to crime.
My understanding is that Benedict Cumberbatch has to wash his hair carefully to keep the dye in.  He swims daily, and the chlorine from the pool is not kind to the dye.   Otherwise, his hair is reddish.
carried him up to bed, and said, “Rosalind took hold of Lambkin, and stopped crying right away.  Tomorrow Daddy and your sister will go to the doctor and get checked out.  They’ll be alright.”
Greg Lestrade snickered.  At Mycroft’s raised eyebrow, “Picturing John in a school band.”
Now he had the flu.  Flu was a condition where the body rebelled against food.  Sherlock, who was the last of the household sufferers - for even Alice Brown had called off sick for the most part of the week - and had handled all manner of bodily fluids for the time the flu had taken to travel through his family.  Now the viral infection had laid him low.  His stomach, still lurching slightly unsteadily, hypocritically growled displeasure at the hollowness inside.
Miri was sitting up in her crib, but she didn’t say anything.  She was waving her bear, Snow White, showing her the fairy lights.
John could hear a loud buzzing from the other end of hte mobile conversation.  Then the sergeant’s response.  “Oh.  Are you sure, sir?  Short fellow.  Yes, he looks like his ID.  Older.  No.  No, he doesn’t have a weapon.  No.  No graffiti or vandalism in the area.  We just heard him from down the road.  No.  Just standing in the dark.”
Offense is not intended toward those who prefer to wear make-up.

“You and Ross,”
“Siger, sweet, you can’t get up and run around with a fever.  You need to stay, resting, because you might fall down even harder.  Plus, you need the bucket,” his Daddy told him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock began, “Now, first we must decide what we are attempting to do with the disguise.  Makeup is, by its nature, always an attempt to convey some meaning.  It is a tool.  Whether it is used to attract the opposite sex,” and here Ross, Miri, and Siger wrinkled their noses and made ‘ew’ sounds, “to copy someone else, or to distract a witness’s eyes from a noticeable blemish or identifiable mark.”
“Not any longer,” was pointed, if steady.  “I am your business manager, and have a busy time with all of the paperwork you refuse to do.”
In an obviously patient tone, John pointed out, “Siger’s assignment is to set up a garden.  He has the choice of doing it at home, or in the Community Gardens.  Something edible is to come out of this garden.  No poisons, or experiments with the food stuffs.  He doesn’t need fifty three varieties of garden soil.”
There are occasional sounds from what looks like a radio - the soft soughing of infant breathing, the coo of a dreaming child, and the creak of their cribs or a twin sized bed.  When a sound comes through too loudly, both men turn their heads to listen, then when it is evident that no emergency exists, they go back to what they were reading - each on their own device.
“Irene Adler is the link. Mycroft wants me to go to Canada and talk to her,” came out finally.
“No problem,” he could see her smile as she flicked to the next page on her tablet.
The smell of scones travels up the stairs, and seeps upward through cracks and crevices in the old house.  They know the petite woman will save a plate for them, and for their children.  It will be breakfast in the morning.
“Is that what one wears to a dance club?” Siger gestured with his violin at John Watson, who was dressed in nice trousers, polished shoes, and a new looking button down shirt.
It was followed almost immediately by another text. “I trust you. SH”
“Daddy?”
“Twenty minutes,” John said thoughtfully.  He quirked a smile at his son.  “Any idea what Père’s thinking about?” he asked.
“Fine.  Go on then,” John leaned back and closed his eyes to listen to whatever his partner came up with.
Sherlock focused on the feel of the bending, woody cherry stem in his mouth, and twisted it round with his tongue, bracing it against his teeth, and missing twice before sliding the end home through a loop.  He spat the piece out into his palm at the same moment John spit his own out.  A tie.
looked over at Daddy, who was still leaning, but his head was down now.
“You used to sing that to him as a lullabye,” Sherlock from his comfortable queen-sized bed under the warm duvet, and next to his comforting and warm-as-a-furnace husband.
Tea that day was food from Sherlock’s second favorite Thai restaurant, which delivered.  And Mycroft and Greg took one of the cottages home to sit on their mantelpiece next to a photograph of Mir’s and Ross’s first Father Christmas.
“Why?” asked Siger who had now cocked his head of red-coloured curls.
Though he could not see Rosalind, Sherlock inferred that she was signing to John.  The blond-haired man replied, “Yes, I liked the train as well.  Yes, as I explained, Santa Claus is the same as
Well, she thought sadly, John would probably not be putting the fairy lights up this year.  He and Sherlock might even decide to stay here at Mycroft’s for the holiday.  That would be depressing.  Martha tried to imagine Sherlock’s face waking up to his brother’s household full of … well, Mycroft… at Christmas time.
“Daddy?” Ross leaned against his leg, she and her faded red teddy bear resting their heads on the comfort of a father at home after missing him for the past few weeks.  Ross did not speak often.  Some of their acquaintances had never heard the little dark-haired girl speak.
loved those silken twists of red, but thought that perhaps it was time to cut his son’s hair.  Still, he admitted that the crown of stars looked well on their crimson bed.  While he was busy with those thoughts, Siger noticed his father in the doorway.
“We’re going to be correcting that.  We’re going to share literature with the children, not just facts.  Not just history, and the lives of famous criminologists.”
Mycroft made a wry face at his husband, then returned to viewing the film with Siger.  He watched the rest of the movie with a happy smile that Greg did not think came from enjoying the puns.
The solid sound of footsteps climbing the carpeted center of the wooden staircase caused the pair to stop and listen.  There was the sound of Miranda and Rosalind’s soft sleeping breathing from the cribs against the other wall. The hint of traffic bled through the glass of the closed window.  The comfortable form of John Watson appeared at the doorway.  “All right, then?” he asked the pair quietly.
Sherlock sat up in bed, shifting the down pillows to support his back.  “
“And then, there’s a distinct lack of Sherlock in our lives as well. They were bound to figure out something. And you know how Anderson is with his conspiracy theories.”
“Hold on, love,” John tried to remember where his chip was.  It was hard to figure it out with his head aching like this.  Shoe.  It was in the heel of his shoe.  He jammed the heel against the floor, banging and shouting, “Let us out of here!”
John’s deep breath as a calming technique was not helping much.  He was much less shouty when he finally agreed. “Yes.  This bothers me, Sherlock.”
Sourly, Mrs. Jenkins admitted with what was almost a caricature of grudging, “They support you in your decision.”
Their voices settled into that comfortable rumble that told Siger that they were home, and downstairs, and that he was ready for sleeping.  And so he did.
Closing the door on the darkened room, John reached for Sherlock.  They were not prone to public displays of affection.  Not between the two of them, in any case.  “I don’t know what I would do without them, Sherlock,” he whispered.
It made Siger giggle, and he asked “Why did you name your gander Alexander?”
There were, of course, criminals -- the stoats and weasels of the Wild Wood, although they were not a particularly clever criminal class.  There was danger, which the shy Mole was more than happy to take up a revolver or a cudgel and whack at.  There was a waistcoated Toad causing anarchy and chaos.  Sherlock had decided that character would do for Mycroft, even if it was a bit forced.  Which made the surly old Badger Lestrade in his mental recording of the story.
John Watson, wearing a familiar oatmeal coloured jumper, winked at his partner over his own cup of tea.  All was right with the world.  Sherlock would be over his flu bout soon enough.  But until then, he had John, and Siger, and the girls to take care of him.
“Ah,” Greg Lestrade blessed departmental rules that prevented police from accepting gifts.
Mrs. Hudson nodded.  The Appropriate Scale was a measurement that Dr. John Watson had suggested for whatever Sherlock was studying that might have a negative effect on the children.  This included, apparently, blood spatter patterns.
The two adults and three children jumped when the driver slammed the boot.  Will startled, then went back to snoring softly.
Sherlock gazed around the car, lingering on Mrs. Hudson still staring out the window, then said, “Why we’ll go to Uncle Mycroft’s.  He as space for all of us, since he and your Uncle Lestrade are in France.”
“And,” John responded, “Does Uncle Mycroft know that we’re going to be taking over his house while he’s away?”
sounded.
“Keep away from the windows, please,” he added before running back downstairs to find Alice Brown had bolted the doors, as they’d practiced, had started the cameras above the black front door and over Mrs. Hudson's back door, and was now setting the alarms.  “Mrs. Hudson!” he shouted, giving the briefest moment of courtesy before opening the door to her flat and stepping inside.  Really, John was having a bad effect on him.  A moment’s hesitation was bad in an emergency situation.
Because of course John will hold Sherlock's hands.
It was not until much later that the doctor received an explanation.  The Rainbird Guest House suite was comfortable, and after the noisy bite to eat at the station house, they’d checked in.
Siger and Ross she dismissed out of hand.  These policemen and women would take them no more seriously than they were taking her statement.  Possibly they’d be arrested as well, as conspirators.  As much as she respected the Yard, primarily for Uncle Greg’s sake, she had spent years hearing about their shortcomings from
I had to make some changes. My apologies.
John’s partner was taking advantage of John’s current domesticity, and captivity by their daughter, to review.  Sherlock Holmes did not believe in luck, although he used the term “lucky” as a phrase often enough.  It was a way of communicating with the common human being.  They believed in luck, that invisible force that allowed them to get what they wished for without making an actual effort.  Sherlock Holmes worked for what he attained.  And if sometimes things happened in his favour without deliberate intent, then that was not luck.  It was happenstance or coincidence, or the conspiracy of whatever criminal he was currently chasing after.
The Little House Christmas Treasury is by Laura Ingalls Wilder, and contains the chapters from each book dealing with Christmas.  John read "Christmas in the Big Woods" from the first book, Little House in the Big Woods.
, who, with Siger, was on the floor with the periodic table blocks.  “Albert,” he loathed repeating himself, but was caught in a slight vocal glitch, “You are not to go out, nor to let anyone into the house until further notice.  Make certain that Siger is safe.  John has been kidnapped.  Do you have your transponder?”
“Presumably,” Mycroft agreed, “Though we are speaking of Jim Moriarty, and logic does not necessarily enter into it.”
John Watson was not, of course, the type of man who dictated a woman’s hair style.  There was no “a woman’s treasure” nonsense about John.  Sherlock knew that the concern was more toward Rosalind’s hands, or Miri’s, on sharp edges.  Well, that and whether or not Rosalind would be teased at school the next day.  Not that it would have mattered to Ross if the other children did tease her over the cropped head.  Ross carried those types of inconveniences off proudly.  In some way that Sherlock could never fathom, no one bullied Rosalind.
When both Miri and Ross jumped up and down wildly, offering, Sherlock gave them both a stern look and said, “You are to observe.  Therefore you can not be the subject.”
“No?” Daddy said, “Even a nice cup of tea with ginger and lemon?”
Ah, the hair.
It was a difficult task.  But someone had to do it.  That someone was Dr. John H. Watson.  Because Sherlock was damned well not going to.
offered, “I’ll be bored AND Ill.”
Siger gave his
It had not been Sherlock’s first ever sexual kiss.  Correct classifications.  First of sexually satisfying kisses.  First actually desired kiss.  First kiss with John Watson.  John’s quick intake of breath.  The scent of a male body, freshly showered, and yet still scented of John Watson under the perfume from his body wash and shampoo.  The warmth and softness of John’s greying blond hair sifting through Sherlock’s fingers as he leaned forward and down to press their lips together.  The taste of mint from John’s nervous tooth brushing before making his declaration.  Such a simple thing, a kiss.
December 1st. Time for an update to his blog.
When naptime came, Bert made Siger come downstairs so that he would not keep his sisters up with his buzzing.  Bert had told Siger he was “busy as a bee” and after that Siger dug up his rubber bees and formed a hive in the sitting room out of the orange shock blanket and his Daddy’s chair.
, “What is ‘roast beast’?”
“Kid’s tea,” Daddy said as he disappeared into the kitchen.  Siger could hear him chatting with Bert.
“You pick her up,” John said, “and I’ll mark it in her book.”
“Yes!  They have been gone for at least two days.  All of these signs are like a story, Siger.  They tell us about what occurred here.” His
Joy ran to him, and he swungher up onto his suit clad hip. His daughter’s fingers were covered with marker smudges of all colors.  “What were you learning about today?” he asked her.
“Spoil sport,” Daddy told him as he brought a tray in to the coffee table.  Setting a small plate out for Siger, he served his son a triangle of fish paste sandwich, one of cucumber, a couple of crisps, and a chocolate caramel biscuit.  Into Siger’s mug he poured a bit of sugar, a touch of cream, and filled the rest half way with black tea.  “Let it cool, Siger,” he said before sharing out food and tea for
As they chatted, Siger had Uncle Mycroft write down Uncle Greg’s favorite books.  Mycroft did not remember ever reading Willard Price’s adventure stories.  Greg pointed out that they had not really aged all that well, though he was still fond of them.  Siger’s list of favorite books was long.  It included fiction, non-fiction, pictures books, a mix of titles shared by others, and read to him in three languages.
“Stalking is one of the ‘twelve crimes of Christmas’”, was John’s reply as he eased back against the wall next to his partner.
What does Sherlock know?
“Oh, I’m sure we’ll find something for you to use, then,” he gave her a wink.
They could have laughed about it afterward.  They should have laughed about it afterward.
“Well, what would you like to give them?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock clucked with annoyance.  John started to comment, but was cut off with, “Rosalind, you have been speaking to Uncle Mycroft through the monitor?  How do you know he is listening?”
Lastly, the man tucked the small violin case under his arm, heaved the backpack onto his shoulder, picked up the suitcase, and made his way downstairs.  Mycroft’s driver met him at the bottom, relieving the detective of the bags and violin case, and taking them to join Mrs. Hudson’s and John’s and his suitcases in the trunk of yet another polished black vehicle.
John turned to examine the tall, dark-haired nutter he lived with.  “What is the experiment? You’re not trying to cause an epidemic are you?”
“Well, Mrs. Hudson will hear if you call for her.  Ready to go, Sherlock?” he asked as he straightened and made his way to the door.
“I am not arguing the point,” Sherlock said with more certainty.
Silence warmed the kitchen for a bit as the meal received appropriate attention.
.  Siger found this all very puzzling.
At one time he’d had them stored in order of importance.  Most often revisited was John Watson in the small room at the top of the stairs, waiting for Sherlock to climb those steps to where he was waiting, wearing a blue cotton tee-shirt - that had been washed approximately 47 times by the amount of fade - and black cotton boxer shorts.  The first of many important kisses.
“Siger, it is just you and me now,” Sherlock Holmes told his son.  Miri had joined her sister happily enough.  They were both sleeping together in the Graco, while John was snorting - as Siger called it - in his and Sherlock’s bed.
Daddy washed the set before Siger, Miri and Ross played with it on the sitting room carpet.   Which Ross did by putting the purple king into her mouth and gumming at him.  Miri waved the donkey about in the air.  Siger set the scene up as correctly as he could minus one donkey and one king. Then he had Joseph and Mary welcome the two kings, the cow, and the sheep to their home to see the baby, Jesus.

“Well, yes,” Sherlock replied, “But I believe the invitation was through Alice Brown, and I just remember seeing the text she sent out before calling in sick with the flu.  You can find it on my phone.  And yours if I remember correctly.”
Grammy Hudson must be feeling well, because she was playing Christmas carols downstairs in her flat.  Ross was gumming on something, because Siger could hear the wet smacking sound of it.  Whatever it was, the item was hard, not soft like his plush football.  Siger opened his eyes to check.  Yes, Ross had a big plastic spoon in her mouth.

seems to have found a number of books from my list, but there are more than Christmas books here.”
is thinking again.”
“Then we’re obviously not leaving Baker Street, are we?” Sherlock folded his hands in front of his face, “Best start planning for a siege, Captain Watson.”
Rosalind and Miranda waited to hear if Daddy would supplement their vocabulary, but John kept  his usually inventive mouth tight lipped.  They went back to their tablet story, while Siger helped his father to pack their purchases into the cloth bags the twins had been sitting upon.
Siger had asked if he could stay home with Daddy and Uncle Greg to watch the match.  If Siger had any doubt of his welcome in doing this, it was washed completely away by the brilliantly happy grin that Daddy gave to him when Siger asked.  “Of course, Siger!” John said, “We would love to have you watch with us.  But it’s a long game, and a little complicated.”
“Not me, Johnny,” Harry rocked her niece, who was on her way to sleep.  “Wouldn’t trade it though.  Not now.  You?”
“He didn’t even need you, Sherlock.  Took a look at the bag of goose shit and told the old man whom to talk to about his missing geese,” John told his husband as he set a mug of hot tea on the coffee table.
And John admired the sparkling  towers of magnets, sturdy walls of clear varnished hardwood architectural blocks, primary colored wooden shapes, a garden of pens and pencils, and finally, an avenue created by piling John’s paperback thriller novels together with a flooring of ripped and discarded - decidedly not gory - crime scene photographs.
Albert Tran had a date.  It wasn’t the girl that he was apprehensive about.  She, Lily, wanted to go ice skating.  Bert had never been.
Cuddles never got his orders directly from Jim Moriarty.  Of course not.  But Tiger Moran was not in charge. Like Cuddles, Moran did what Jim Moriarty said.  Tiger never lied, or prettied things up for the man.  “Kill him.  Make it messy.  We want it particularly messy.”   Or, “We’re sending a message with this one.  So make sure anyone who sees her understands.”
When the biscuits sheets were filled, the short, older woman put them in front of Siger and Bert, along with a bowl of chocolate bits, walnuts, silver balls, cinnamon hearts,  and sprinkles.  “Alright, Siger, and you too, Bert, decorate the biscuits before we put them in the oven.”
.  His Daddy insisted on reading the “Dulce Domum” chapter each Christmas.  Miranda’s favorite was
They stared at one another for a moment.  Then with a nod, Sherlock turned back to care for his family.
He examined the child.  Long brown hair, braided, dark skin, and serious eyes examined him back.  “I beg your pardon?” he responded.
“Good.”  Sherlock Holmes headed down into their agency’s office.  “You can plan your literary strategy after you set up the fairy lights.”
“That one we will bury in Mycroft’s flower bed.  I want to monitor the decay rate,” Sherlock said off-handedly.
Footsteps on grit.  The Big Bastard was coming back.  Whipping his hands back ‘round his body, and rolling to appear still compromised, the sticky tape crumpled in his fist, John began to shout “Help!  Let me out of here!”
“Ready for lights out?” John asked.
The sergeant, who was speaking intently into his mobile said, “Suspect was loitering in the dark on Corn Street.  He’s got a box of hands.  No, sir.  No.  Human hands.  Human hands.  Well most of them, I think.”
“I’ll let you know when I’ve found him.”   Was Mycroft attempting to be reassuring?  Sherlock hung up.
John followed the tall, slender figure as the man clattered down the stairs ahead of him.
“And the reason Sherlock is not here is?” John asked politely.
Pulling off his coat and laying it over the back of one chair Sherlock sat down in the other and paused as he reached for the hard copy file.  Looking up at the top of the shelf he had been perusing he gestured toward the two small beings standing watch atop the bookcase.  “Really, Mycroft?  Where did you even find those?”
And the enormous weight that was his baby cousin was lifted as John Watson unbuckled the snug sack, and hefting Will onto his hip, wrapped the other arm around his boy.  Siger gave it up at that, and leaning against his father’s chest began to cry.
is ‘pants’ at socialization,” she said.
Holmes took the time to enjoy the flavor of tea with just the right amount of honey. It was just warm enough, without burning his mouth.  Then he said, “In fact, you were complaining.  But you wisely used logic to see my side of the issue.  The question now is whether or not you would like to eat a British beef roast with Yorkshire pudding expertly cooked by either Anna or Mycroft at my brother’s establishment, or go through the bother of catering a meal here.  I highly doubt that either of us are either in the mood, or up for the effort of cooking a large and involved dinner that only you will really appreciate.”
Sherlock’s scoff was tangible, “The news.  As though they care about correct information.  Are you reading between the lines in the articles?  Sometimes you miss things, John.”
John, who had been rehearsing the words in his head all evening opened his mouth to blurt out something, anything. No words came.
That got a reaction from Mr. Gurdy.  “They do.  Of course they do.  Two of the boys work in their dad’s restaurant in the evenings.  Indian Palace it’s called.”
Greg huffed a laugh.  “Mycroft, one man shopping with a toddler for a Christmas dress will definitely give the impression that you’re gay.  Regardless of the right or wrong of it.  And yes.  That might change the way that the salesclerks work with you.  You know that.  Not really my point.  You can handle that.  Bloody terrifying, the thought of any clerk giving you sass.  And receiving a well earned smack down.”
The door swung inwards, and a smiling face framed by red curls popped around the edge.  “Alright, James?  Time for maths!”
, but "Ross and Miri are too young," he told the two adults. Bert chose two to take down to his room for later that night.  He had a study date.  The thought that those biscuits would be waiting for him afterward was a pleasant thought.
“Why, ‘aven’t ya danced a two-step before?”
His father laughed, “Your first word!”
He’d come home to a changed John.  A Doctor John Watson who had not believed in his return at first, and then when he’d realized what he was seeing had chinned Sherlock.  There had been a job of work rebuilding their friendship.  Renewing their partnership.   Healing their relationship.
“Yes, Sigur.  Just coming now!”
Lily was not wearing an ice dancing costume, but was sensibly dressed in grey slacks and a blue and gray Aran sweater.  Her long, dark hair was pulled up in a knot at her neck to show off dangling snowflakes at her ears.  Bert found that she was patient, and a good teacher.  She had him move at a snail’s pace to a corner of the rink, before telling him to practice falling, there out of the way of the other skaters.  Lily, in her own white polished women's skates, kept constantly moving about him on the ice.  She was at home here.
John Watson was not a large man.  Even so, airplanes (and he was flying first class courtesy of Mycroft Holmes) were getting more cramped.  If he’d have been flying with his partner, their children, and the au pair (with whom they had only flown once, but that was quite enough. Thankyouverymuch), this “simple trip” would have been incredibly complicated. Imagining Sherlock Holmes squeezed in beside him - long legs trapped against the backward leaning seat of the woman in front of John, brought a smirk to his lips, and distracted him for a few moments.
“Just let me check those, first,” his

Siger clipped the bag from his father’s slackening fingers.  “What is the white bits of grit in there?”
Daddy said, “Not always” with that look he got sometimes.
John Watson dropped his head into his hands.
“Facts, John, are not compliments.  Though I do appreciate how warm you are in bed.”  After a moment he continued, “And that you don’t kick me when my feet are cold and I put them against you to warm them up.”
Sherlock Holmes nodded.  “Tell me about the people on your flight.”
Upstairs the noise of the violin was louder.  The horsehair strung bow screamed across the metal strings to make John grit his teeth.  “Hallo,” he said loudly as he dropped his cargo on the kitchen table and entered the living space, “What’s all this, then?”
“It’s even odds that he’ll be sent away to ensure that he doesn’t get infected.  It’s Lestrade that would be a problem.  He’ll be a major part of the London schematic if this thing goes tits up.”
