Steve sighed and whispered into her ear. “Baby you didn’t kill her. Loki did. Not you. You're sweet and adorable.”
Luna ran over to the couch and wrapped her arms around her dad. Over the years she was able to learn where everything in the house was located. Everyone knew if they were moving furniture in the common room or in the Stark-Rogers apartment to let Luna know so she didn’t have to use her cane in her own home. “I missed you! How was California? Did you go to Disneyland? Did you go see ELLEN?! What about the Loony Toons?! The Gilmore Girl house?!”
During those months Luna applied to Midtown and got in with no problems. She was starting out a senior since she was well advanced over the senior classes, but she wanted to spend the rest of the year in high school. Wanting to say she at least went to high school once in her life was always a big dream for her. All of the teachers know just to call her Luna and not by her last name. All of the teachers and subs that they hire all had to sign and got paid up front to make sure they never speak about her.
“Well, because…”
“Were you defending yourself, was that kid with the weird nickname bullying you again?” Tony demanded, “What is it, Crash, Trash?”
It frightened Steve to realize just how well he’d gotten to know Tony, that he knew what his contemplative expression looked like, and how often he’d have to have been looking at him to judge his moods by his facial expressions.
Tony wet his lips and took a deep breath, forcing himself to remain calm, “The threat of Thanos is far from imagined, especially with the news that Steve has brought, and as for putting together an army, as you call it, I do not see how that is dangerous to anyone but an invading hostile force, as that is what it will be used for. All of us uniting to fight a common enemy.”
The PA shifted nervously, "Well Sir... not exactly." he avoided Norman's gaze as the man glared at him.
Peter rose an eyebrow at him, “Liar.” He accused, “You wouldn’t ask Mamma out on a date until the two of you had nearly been killed in front of each-other.”
For a moment the two teams froze, neither side giving or taking ground as they stood off against one another. Tony swallowed hard and turned to Rhodey, pushing Lily into his arms,
“If that happens I am blaming you.” Tony said, “Just as I am blaming you for my back ache, neck ache, and other aching body parts from sleeping on this crappy air mattress.”
“Mamma,” Peter croaked, “Mamma wake up.” More blood filled his mouth and he spat it out, “Mamma please wake up!” He pleaded, he tried to move, tried to get his limbs to work but he felt so weak and the armour and debris were too heavy.
“You say you’re sorry to her, fucking say it!” Peter yelled at Harry. The other boy’s face was covered in blood from his broken nose and split lips, he was crying and trying to fend Peter off but was no match for Peter’s strength or agility.
Rhodey, had no problems in telling everyone about how he and Tony met in college and had been friends ever since, how he’d gone into the air-force and become a carer soldier, with Tony gifting him War Machine two years before.
If Tony Stark had a choice he would choose burger king over a high end restaurant any day. Or, when he wanted something other than fast food, he liked to go for small family run establishments, like the Italian he had taken Steve and the boys to after Coney Island. He found the atmosphere more friendly and relaxed than in one of the up market restaurants, where the waiters were all in livery and spoke in overly polished accents, had their noses in the air as if they smelled something foul, and everyone was so stiff that they never enjoyed the food they were eating because they were too focused on how they looked and if they were impressing those around them.
“Fuck.” Tony cursed and Steve appreciated the sentiment.
“Sex isn’t a taboo subject anymore.” Tony said, “The sexual revolution of the sixties saw to that, the invention of the Pill, giving Beta women and Omega’s the freedom to choose whether or not to get pregnant, the legalization of abortion, more contraceptive choices, and the loss of the stigma attached to unmarried mothers have all put pay to the secrecy regarding sex.”
“Fuckwits.” Clint simplified.
As they left Fury sank back into his chair, “You are not telling the WSC about this.” He said to Hill, “I know you don’t like the Avengers, but I like the WSC’s decision to nuke New York even less, and I trust that asshole Rumlow about as far as I could throw him.”
“Really Sir…?”
Steve glared at Natasha and ignored Sam’s snorting laughter at his expense in favour of guiding Tony away from them, though he did make a rude gesture behind his back at the wolf whistle which was set their way.
“Are you smoking crack?” Sam asked, incredulous, “Do you know how big LGBTQA is in America alone?”
“Thanks Dumm-E.” Tony croaked, his voice having gone hoarse, “Sorry if Daddy scared you guys, and thanks for cleaning up for me.” Dumm-E whirred as if were trying to tell Tony it was alright. Butterfingers beeped and YOU chirped.
It was an odd, butterflies in his stomach, like feeling, and Tony hoped that it would last for a long time.
Tony brightened at the thought, which made Steve snort in amusement, “Where have you been anyway, Jarvis said something about a defunct facility?”
“Oh my God.” Steve whispered staring down into the most prefect face he had ever seen, “Oh she’s, she… Vision she’s… I don’t know what to say.” There were tears in his eyes, tears of happiness as he looked up at Vision.
Thankfully Zach found it fun being in his Mother’s workshop with his shirt off, sitting up on one of the work benches with electrodes attached to him and monitors beeping. He didn’t even complain when Tony took some blood from him which had Bruce running panels on, (Although that might be because he got lolly pops to suck on)
Days went by with Peter's condition not changing, not getting any worse, but also not improving despite the efforts of the Doctors. There was also the fear that the longer this lasted the more likely it was that Peter would suffer lasting organ damage, brain damage was a possibility that Tony had been warned of, Peter had been without sufficient air for an extended period of time due to his throat swelling shut, there was a chance that his brain had suffered damage as the result.
Steve spluttered with laughter looking up at Tony with joy dancing in his eyes and relaxed happiness on his face.
“Okay then.” Tony said, “J, hold the fort, or what’s left of it, we’re heading to Long Island and picking up Shwarma on the way.”
“You don’t have to go to any trouble just for us.” Steve said, but bagels did sound good, bagels and cream cheese.
“You’re grounded.” MJ’s Mother said, “For two months, and no internet unless its for school, no mobile, no allowance except for sanitary towels…”
Tony seemed oblivious to Steve’s shock, taking him by the elbow and guiding him back to the lift to take him to the floor he’d chosen for Steve “Because it get’s the best natural light and you are an artist aren’t you? I think I remember Howard saying that. You can decorate however you’d like, the furniture is pretty basic right now, but you can get and change whatever you want, and you have free access to the swimming pool, jacuzzi, and steam room.”
Since the team attracted so much attention and children adored them, they had all taken to going to the children’s ward for a couple of hours a day to spend time with the children, talking to them, helping them colour in, do jigsaw puzzles, and play with the few toys the hospital had.
The determined that the sceptre or rather the object it contained was not just an energy source but some kind of sentient object.
“Congratulations Mr Stark it’s an Omega Boy.” The Doctor said wrapping him in a towel and handing him to Tony who was sobbing too much to speak, Pepper was no better and Happy was struggling to hold back tears too, even Rhodey looked misty eyed as they beheld the red and wrinkled newborn in Tony’s arms.
“If you give me a ride, I’ll help.” Steve offered, Rhodey paused, looking the large man over,
“You could have saved us, why didn’t you do more?”
“Nnno.” Tony pushed regretfully and weakly at Steve’s chest, not really wanting to push him away, what he really wanted to do was wrap his arms about that broad chest and rub his body up against Steve, but he couldn’t, he knew he couldn’t, it wouldn’t be fair on Steve. The Alpha was so young, he deserved so much better than Tony had to offer.
Tony nodded, “Well then, that is something to be proud of, you’ve done so well.” Tony couldn’t help but to dimple at him.
“I’m not that short, you are though, you’re practically a Hobbit!”
“I don’t care.” Steve said firmly, “I don’t care about sex, I can live without it. So long as I can hold you, kiss you, talk to you, and be with you, then nothing else matters.”
“But I could have walked away after Vanko.” Tony said, “I should have seen it as a warning for what was to come, the danger my family were in.”
Steve was stroking Tony’s hair as he slowly got his breathing under control and managed to speak again in a hoarse voice, “Peter, Zach…?”
“Want Mamma, want Mamma now.” He cried.
“Ask Mamma.” Peter said, in no shape way or form was he giving Peter the details on that subject, “And it’s a bit more complicated than them just going on one date.”
“I know I am buddy.” Clint said, “I didn’t mean to hurt your Mamma, and I’ll make it up to him, “I promise.”
He lay the infant down onto the bench stripping off the baby grow he was placed in, revealing his chubby body and securely bound nappy that for once was clean.
Tony threw the paper across the penthouse and glared at it, smirking when Gingerbread leaped from the sofa and dive bombed the sheets, clawing at them happily.
“On you go then!”
Zach was back to his bubbly self as soon as he’d had breakfast and we keen to go on the hike that Steve promised they’d do, much to Tony’s complaints of forced death marches across miles of treacherous landscapes, blisters, dehydration, and slave driving brats and captains!
“Alright big guy, can you apply pressure to the wound while I check on Tony’s BP and pulse?”
Tony held out a hand to him and Steve took it, climbing onto the bed and settled down at Tony’s side relaxing as Tony began to stroke his hair. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of you know, having triggers. Its no wonder that you do have issues with the snow and ice, not after what you’ve been through, and you don’t have to suffer alone. You can talk to me about anything.”
“MJ can you cut the alarms again for a minute or so?” He asked her.
“Again that is something that can be discussed.” Pepper said, “What do the rest of you think?” She asked looking around at the rest of the team.
He was thrilled that she had taken to Tony so well. Clearly assuming that he was her other Father and settling into his embraces just as she had with his Tony.
“Mamma please!” tears leaked from his eyes and more blood rose at the back of Peter’s throat, Oh God, oh, God, he was going to die here, die in his Mamma’s arms buried under a building.
“Apparently some parents have raised concerns and pressured the schools into doing so.” Steve said, “And while I vehemently disagree with this, I understand parents being concerned for the safety of their children. It’s something that concerns me too, but I want you all to know that Peter and Zach are not threats, they are very special children, who need to be around children their own age. To have friends, to play, to go on dates, and do all the normal childhood and adolescent activities. They have done nothing wrong, they have committed no crimes, and they do not deserve to be punished or restricted as if they had.”
“Doesn’t look like there will be much resistance against us.” Natasha commented eyeing several fleeing guards.
*****
Tony shivered at the contact from Steve’s fingers, they were gentle but his skin was extra sensitized right now so it felt like electric jolts dancing over his nerve endings.
“What is it?” Steve asked, seeing the lust dying in Tony’s eyes even as the Billionaire fought to keep his emotions from showing on his face.
“Is coming with me.” Tony said cutting her off. Gone was the playful and ease and in its place a steely resolve. He stepped forward getting into Natasha’s space and looking her dead in the eye, “Those fuckwits you work for just tried to nuke the city, frankly I trust them even less than I trust you. So there is no way in hell I am letting them get their claws on Bruce, understood?”
A secure hospital, a nut house. Steve knew that huge strides had been made in psychology, normal every day people had therapy now, spoken openly about it, mental health was far less of a taboo subject, there were even names for conditions and real treatments for them. Celebrities openly spoke of their own mental health struggles, from Depression, to eating disorders, to Bi-Polar disorder.
As they approached the base, the War Machine armour broke off with the Iron Man armour and Sam in the falcon suit and they flew towards the base ahead of the jet, targeting Hydra vehicles and taking down the perimeter fence. There were long range canons that Friday took great pleasure in blowing to kingdom come and a couple of tanks as Rhodey took out but which time soldiers were pouring out of the base, only they were met with red energy from Wanda who descended from the air, tossing them aside and clearing a space for Clint to set down so Natasha and Steve could disembark.
Natasha Romanoff, The Black Widow.
However when Morgan’s first word was “Lily.” It was more than worth it.
MJ rose an eyebrow and made her face look unconvinced, it was an expression she was practising in the mirror, she’d need Natasha give it to Clint and Sam several times and thought it looked really mature and scary.
That had finally broken down the last of Tony’s walls. He’d broken down into tears, ended up sobbing in Steve’s arms, all his fears spilling out as he clung to him, crying himself out on Steve’s chest as he rubbed Tony’s back and comforted him, promising him that it would never happen, that everyone had darkness in them, but it was a choice to give in to it, to become evil, not something that happened by inevitability.
Steve shook his head, “You have the right to feel anything, and do not deserve to berate yourself for it.”
“We can enjoy sex.” Tony said,
“Jesus.” Clint whispered.
"It's not your fault." Steve said or at least began to say when Tony sucked in a huge breath and glared.
“Where is he?” Steve asked, “Your Steve I mean, and the other Avengers?”
“Oh honey.”
“Mamma, Espresso’s puked up a fur ball on the sofa.” Peter called.
“Awesome.” Ned breathed.
He even developed a maternity suit. He wouldn’t wear it unless his life was being threatened, but he figured that after Afghanistan it was better safe than sorry and worked with Jarvis to create sliding plates over the abdomen so it could be enlarged as his belly grew, and grow it did. By the end of the second trimester Tony felt ready to burst and spent his last three months complaining about never ending backache, increasing bladder weakness, swollen ankles, and stretch marks.
“Mr Stark?” The secretary called, knocking on the door,
“Its not swine-flu Tony, its most likely a bad cold.” Bruce said, “Given a few days he’ll be back to his usual lively self.”
“Hey!” Steve protested.
“But he has been in love with a Stark, and is now dwelling with another Stark. No good can come of that.”
“Flag wearing butt monkey!”
“He didn’t.” Steve growled, “He was coming here to save….someone.”
*****
“Oh!” Tony’s eyes widened, “Uh, Fri, order baby food and whatever else is needed for babies, nappies and cots and clothes, and Clothes for…, Steve? it is Steve I take it?”
Tony had been up most of the night studying all that Shield had given him on the Avengers, Loki, and all the research on thermonuclear radiation that Bruce Banner had ever written, as well as looking at it up by various other experts, thus making himself an expert.
By the time they left the hospital the next day the story had of course got out and the press were waiting for them to get pictures and confirm that Tony had no idea he’d been pregnant until he’d given birth.
“No!” Peter cried, backing away from Tony and pressed his hands over his ears, backing up into the wall, “Please take me home, please get me away from all this noise!”
“I like you in a uniform.” Tony said, “I very much like the thought of you in your dress uniform, all starched and smart, and then messing you up and stripping you out of it.”
Tony bit down on his bottom lip and gripped the bedsheets, twisting and turning as Steve sucked him down, his teeth providing a wonderful friction and his tongue tormented him and drove him half out of his mind.
“One day won’t hurt, Tony.” Steve assured him, “Come on, you’ve earned a rest, lets just pack up a picnic and go to the park, let Lily crawl about on the grass and just enjoy the sunshine.”
“We fucked up, we really fucked up!” MJ said wringing her hands,
I want you all to be modern Twenty-First century men and women, and to stop cruelty when you see it. If you know that someone is being bullied, then help them, befriend them, have your friends befriend them too, a bully will be less likely to act if they see their victim has support, because a bully is a coward, their only power is fear, and once that is taken away, they have nothing.
By the end of the evening Zach’s energy was flagging and he rested against Steve’s chest as they waited for Happy to pick them up in the car to go back to the tower.
“Shit, Shit, Shit!”
“Zach, don’t you even think about it!” Steve shouted, his long legs should have had him catching up with Zach with ease but Zach was Tony’s child after all and wasn’t so easily caught. Sticking his tongue out at Steve, Zach climbed up onto the banister and slid down the stairs, he then repeated the action with the second staircase and the third.
“Three maybe four days,” said Steve.
“I don’t believe so.”
Steve took another box from a nearby stack and started looking through. He took off his sweater when straightening his shirt, Tony caught a glimpse of light blue lace.
Steve whined. His relief was all too short. He managed his way up the stairs to the bedroom, going into the bathroom. Jarvis had the shower on for him. The cold water was a wonderful relief against his scorching skin. He turned off the water when he started to prune and toweled tried. Steve scratched at the slight stubbled that grown.
"It's perfect Tony. Thank you," he said.
Winter trudged through an icy path, yanking open the frosted metal door leading into the base. He scowled when he saw Zemo waiting for him by the entrance; all he wanted was to return to the pup.
"What's their relationship?"
"As always. Maybe you'll be successful in pulling him away from his most recent project."
“We can leave."
“Thanks,” said Steve. He tucked the list into his back pocket. Steve walked Natasha to the door hugging her goodbye, before returning to the kitchen.
Thor told him everything that happened.
“If you ever have the chance, run and never look back,” said Winter.
“Twenty hours.”
*****
“And you’re?”
“I’m happy to do it,” he said.
A mixture of guilt, relief, and insecurity played across Steve’s expression. He raised Steve’s chin. His heart wrenched when a tear slid down Steve’s cheek. He kissed his love.
Tony rushed out of the elevator, toward them. He searched for injury. They were fine. He cupped Steve’s face in his hands. His gaze was distant.
“Shh, Papa is fine.”
Sorry, this chapter was a bit late.
Steve let himself in. Bruce took off his gloves and went greet him. He took the bowl from Steve's hand.
“Are you sure it’s not
“How can something so little make such a stink?”
“Is it bad?” asked Steve.
“Now that I have your focus can we have a civilized conversation?” said Steve.
“Only one?” asked Steve.
"How did you escape without your friend getting hurt?" Piper stared at him with those big blues, so desperately seeking an answer. Her gaze had lost some of its childlike innocence; there'd be no getting that back.
“Okay.” She took Papa’s hand.
"Embryo?"
“Am I able to have children?” he asked. It may not be a possibility, but he wanted to know. If, by some slim chance, the opportunity arose for him to have a family, he wanted to see if he were capable.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said.
"Claim me," he whispered.
Steve snarled. He grabbed the alpha’s biceps and flipped them over, straddling his waist. In one hand he caught the alpha’s wrists. He sunk onto the alpha’s length.
Piper yawned close to falling asleep. She was snapped from her drowsiness when Winter’s body language changed.
“Break what?” asked Steve.
A wave of blue energy shot through the room, shattering the glass, sending them crashing backward. Winter's attackers stumbled toward the exit, slamming into the door. But their fate was seal as soon as they'd entered the room. The door was locked.
Steve laughed. "Have you ever been camping?"
“Doesn't matter I'd still love to see you in it.”
“What she has great legs,” said Tony with a shrug of his shoulders.
“Take off your shirt,” said Natasha.
He pointed up.
“Yes, it was awarded to you shortly after your death. The president wanted to make sure you received them,” said Fury.
“They are here,” announced Jarvis.
Tony took a shaky breath. He moved Steve’s hand from his face.
“Why are you here?”
He kissed Steve on the forehead, before leaving bed. Steve instantly spread out. The omega was out moments later. He went to the lab and worked on Dumm-E and U. Their systems were simple compared to what he was used to. His mind ached for the intricacies of the armor. What if Steve went into labor and he couldn't get there in time?
What did it stand for? Why were those letters of such importance that he’d carve them there? He pushed his hand into his pocket, not wanting to focus on what may be forever unknown. He traced over the splinter cracks in the glass. Feeling the camera in the perched in the corner, zooming on him as he did.
“Yes, sir.” Joseph slammed down the phone.
“It must be strange, all this,” said Banner taking in the military organization.
He tried coming closer but Tony backed away. The motion of rejection revealed how deeply Tony was hurting.
“She got all of us out.”
Steve took the alpha’s hand. They got into the tub. He relaxed into the alpha’s chest, letting the alpha was him.  Tony got out.
SECURE STORAGE 10-C
“What?”
“That was not my intention, Little Miss. I’m simply offering my assistance.”
An image of Winter's skull appeared. Certain areas of the image glowed a bright white.
Steve rolled his eyes.
Tony turned his attention to the work at hand.
Tony yawned. He wanted nothing more than to snuggle with Steve and sleep. Hammer nudged against his leg, offering clean clothes. He took a fresh shirt and shorts from the basket. Tony got himself another cup of coffee, bracing himself for the upcoming onslaught of conversation.
“Omega.”
"Will she be okay?"
A young beta couple came with a stroller and two older children. Tony didn’t know what Steve saw, but he saw a tired couple though they did look happy.
Matt took a seat on the couch across from him.
“Steve?”
“Who are you?”
“Are you sure, Steve?”
“Undress,” said Steve.
"It's fine, Tony."
“What mark is it really?”
“They gave you four names?”
“Oh, I’m sorry they are only coded to me.”
"How are you?"
Rune didn’t like the word, but he returned the gesture.
Tony tensed. She yawned.
“Do you have anything else to do?”
“Hang on Steve!"
What turned out to be the most fun was firearms. The class was mostly focused on sniper scenarios. It was calculations. Figuring out winds speeds, drag, distances, along with other variables. She'd worked with such basic elements like this before, but, never like this.
"You should keep the A," said Steve.
"I was capable of convincing him, but him not being there would bring up too many questions," said Steve.
“That would be great,” said Steve.
“Just let me finish this last part,” he said.
“It won’t be much longer now. You won’t be able to put up this pathetic protection. And you will do exactly what I say.” She sighed, straightening her clothes. “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
"I've only known him a few days."
The title read:
There was a knock on the door. Pepper came in. “There’s a mob out there,” she said.
Steve nodded. He had to give it a name.
Tony joined Steve on the couch. Steve cuddled closely, resting his head against Tony’s chest. He traced the arc reactor. The gentle blue light was a comfort. The metal was cool underneath his fingers. Clint, Nat, and Banner joined them. They started the movie over again. Steve was at ease. A part of him that he'd never known was missing was healed. Friends and family surrounded him. Family, he had a family. His happiness flooded through the bond. He was complete in a way he never thought he'd be. A mate and a baby on the way was something he thought he'd never have. Tony's attention wasn't on the movie either. The alpha seemed content with carding his finger through Steve's hair. Steve dozed off.
“Tony.”
“Asset.”
Steve grabbed the alpha’s hand and led him off the plane. They got into the car. Being in cramped into space with his alpha did nothing to help his self control. He was grateful for Tony’s driving. Steve shot out of the car as soon as they pulled into the garage. Cramping almost brought him to the ground. A steadying hand wrap around his waist. He leaned into the sturdy alpha behind him.
“I'm looking forward to it," said Tony.
Tony sighed.
“Come, on beautiful,” said Tony.
The fed cut off. Natasha, Thor, Bruce, and Steve were left processing what they heard.
“Go on,” said Piper. She didn’t want to be the only one talking. Rune shook his head. “The people in here you can trust, promise.”
“Will he be okay?” she asked.
“Nothing, I couldn’t handle.” Steve would happily return to that dreamscape battlefield to escape what he was feeling now. But he had his husband. He whimpered, nosing against Tony’s neck. Tony brought him into an embrace.
Natasha laughed. “She really doesn’t like that playpen,”
“Where is the Tesseract?” asked Thor.
“Please, take off your shirt.”
He could have sworn Piper glared at him. They settled down in the living room. Steve turned on the news. He tried not to watch too much of it. Morning Joe was one of his favorites, though. They rarely talked about his family, only offering congratulations when Piper was born. Piper's glowing health was a point of pride. She loved seeing Bruce for her monthly check-ups. They'd given her immunizations to be safe. Piper had thrown a fit about that, managing to break Bruce's pinky in the process. He didn't understand why so many were fearful of vaccination. Steve remembered polio outbreaks in New York and throughout the rest of the country. His mother was terrified that he may get the sickness. He would have been first in line to get the vaccine if it were available at the time. Steve smiled at his baby. Her most recent accomplishment was making her first attempts at crawling.
"Broken Heart Syndrome," said Rhodes.
Winter got up to leave. There was no reason to linger here.
“Let’s take a look,” she said.
“She wouldn’t be worth keeping if she did. Call me when she wakes up,” said Pierce.
A mist of cool water hit their faces. Large propellers emerged from the water. They chopped and turned it, before elevating that massive ship. Steve backed away as the powerful winds hit them. This was amazing. How could such a massive machine possibly fly?
Those brown eyes opened. They were hazy and lacked their normal sharpness.
They’d play the same but she’d just have to figure out a new name for it. Seeing that Theodore had something against the word war. He nodded. His posture seemed more relaxed from seconds ago. Theodore settled across from her.
“He’d have to heat the cube to 120 million Kelvin just to break through the cooling barrier-
“Then I don’t know what you’re talking about, Piper. You must be confused.”
“Asleep."
She seemed so defeated.
"It might feel like you're at a standstill, Steve, but you are making progress."
“What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does,” said Tony. He looked forward to the moment where that annoying smirk was wiped from Loki’s expression.
"Why?" asked Steve.
She yawned cutely and Tony opened up the blankets. Piper quickly crawled under.
“Go,” said Tony.
"I'm pregnant," said Steve.
“Promise?” asked Piper.
She stuck her tongue out at him. Tony copied the motion. Breakfast went well, and soon enough it was time to leave. Tony helped Piper into a red jacket with cat ears and pawprint pockets.
He nodded.
"How long has Tony been awake?" he asked.
“I’m sorry about your brother,” he said.
Steve sat up rubbing the sleep from his eyes. “Alpha tone really?”
“Alpha, please!”
“Funny thing-
Steve took the alpha’s wrists in his hand, pushing him to the floor. He straddled the alpha’s waist. Tony was as confident ever.
“What happened?”
“Mint green,” she said.
"Sorry, Steve we'll give you the basic summary," said Edith.
, he knew.
“YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED!!” screamed Tony.
“But -”
"A few days after my heat. It was an accident my birth control malfunctioned. But it was the best accident to ever happen to me."
“Angry? No. Steve deserved better than me. I got a chance to live my life. He deserves that as well,” she said.
December 20, 2012
Steve snarled as Rumlow grew closer. Not his alpha!
*****
“Do you mind signing my drawing?” A little girl and her brother snuck passed their guard.
“Rune,” called Maria.
“Has Piper been feed yet?”
Tony broke their gaze. The alpha couldn’t deny him that.
"It isn't something that can be fixed."
"I'm guessing there are scorch marks on the deck," said Tony.
Steve sat next to him. He ran his fingers through Tony's hair. The alpha leaned into him, breathing in his scent.
It was quickly removed. Winter’s arms dropped limply by his side.
Tony swallowed the lump in his throat, fearing what that apology may mean.
She bit her knuckled, trying to process him. Tony didn’t know who the woman had been expecting, but he needed to gain all he could from her.
“Happy, Steve going be moving,” said Tony.
“What time is it?” he asked.
Killian turned to face him as he shot Maya. The woman fell instantly.
“Not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing?” said Tony.
Steve pressed close to Tony. After seventy years trapped in the ice, he’d found love again. He’d survived the horrors of war, yet he found such love, unlike so many of the war.
“I can't see myself with anyone else,” said Steve.
“You don’t have to do that,” said Steve.
"Are you under the impression I'm enjoying this?" said Tony trying to look up from the odd position.
“Got hit a 69 no 79 percent match,” said an agent.
“I DON’T WANT TO!!”
“I’ll be there soon. Bye,” said Steve.
He smirked.
“With Tony”, said Steve.
“Okay, baby girl,” he said. Tony took her hand, helping her out of bed. He walked her to the bathroom, leaving Steve to clean up.
Steve nodded.
Steve snarled at the metal man perched outside their den. There was no scent. An empty shell. But that didn't mean he enjoyed its presence. He preferred the soft tones of their shelter. The armor's hard edges did not fit in with the rest. It ruined the level of comfort. He growled, preventing his alpha from joining him. Steve wanted it gone! Alpha shook his head. He had no intention of letting his alpha into their nest until it was out of sight. There was no swaying him on that. Maybe another approach was needed.
“He’ll be my alpha,” said Steve.
Steve put leftovers in the fridge for Tony before carefully setting Piper down on their bed. He took his Stark pad from the side drawer and downloaded The Feminine Mystique. Steve only used it to read. Most of what he read was nonfiction that caught him up on current events and important public figures. Halfway through he heard Tony come in so did Piper.
Steve bit his lip. “What does that mean? Will she be okay?!”
“Captain Rogers, I need you to come with me,” said Phil.
Steve growled, rising from his seat. He backed Natasha into a corner, hating where this conversation was heading. “Drop it!”
Natasha and Clint stood outside Steve’s room. It was wrong seeing him in this broken state.
Steve got up. He hating the scratch of the carpet against his sensitive skin. Steve tossed Tony the blanket from the couch.
A gauntlet came crashing through the window, slamming a guard in the back of the head. It wrapped around Tony hand. He shot the other guard, sending them both backward. Tony freed his arm and charged his other captor. A boot wrapped around his leg. He kicked the guard away. Tony took the man’s gun.
"Can you move?" he asked softly.
“Why didn’t you tell me?!”
Every sound she made further stressed him. Natasha slid off her shoes and slowly approached him, sinking down so she could be on the same level. He clutched something close to his chest. She ran her fingers through his hair, hoping to calm him.
“Only sleep,” he said.
“Papa and I planned something special for your birthday," said Tony.
“Leave it outside.”
“He will lash out at you, Steve,” said Rhodes.
“There’s my girl,” whispered Tony.
“Any idea on what you want to do for our honeymoon?” asked Tony.
“You’ll have plenty of time to train with it at S.H.I.E.L.D,” said Tony.
“December is the anniversary of his parents' death is coming up. The holidays are always difficult for him,” said Peggy.
*****
"Your first wave will hit soon. I can smell it," said Tony.
“I as well,” said Barny.
He slowly sat up. Tony’s arm was lazily thrown across his waist. He was in a deep sleep and wasn't showing any signs of waking up. Steve pressed a gentle kiss on the alpha’s temple. His scent clung to Tony’s skin. Smiling at the fact that the alpha smelled strongly of him. He carefully moved Tony’s arm from his waist and moved from the nest, collapsing seconds later. His legs felt like limp noodles. He was actually sore. That took some real effort on Tony’s part.
There was a knock on the door. He went to answer it.
He’d wasted his time. All the wasted effort. There had to be some link here. Something proved this misuse of time.
“Love you too.”
“One day when he was patrolling the shore he stumbled upon a chick. She was all alone. He searched the beach for her parents but there was no one around. The brave little chick clumsily walked forward, pressing against his warm feathered belly, happily peeping. They both were no longer alone. Theodore patted her with his fin, promising to always be there for her."
Piper took a breath, getting to her feet. He was right.
“Then why do I have to see a therapist?” she asked.
“Teach me.”
"Mostly since I would do the same thing," said Steve.
“Better?”
Tony spotted Piper sitting at the grand staircase, staring blankly at the front door. She was dressed in green pajamas with yellow construction equipment patterning it. The real oddity about the image was she wearing an old bowler hat. Its rim hid her eyes.
“I guess we’ll find out,” said Tony.
“How are you feeling?”
“Top floor got us a deluxe panoramic view room,” said Tony.
"Please, call me, Steve."
“He’ll be back in his mind soon enough. You didn't see what was really important," said Lena.
“I bit you,” he said.
“I miss my friend,” she whispered.
He took out his cell phone. Steve called Natasha.
"I would like that."
“It is.”
"I wish I could do something as simple as go out with boyfriend without the worry of someone discovering who I am," said Steve.
“They would have hurt you worse if I didn’t?” Piper’s voice was small, hopeful.
“Why does she need one?”
"Any progress?" asked Tony.
*****
“The pizza, sir.” Tony paid.
“Extreme emotion. Specifically anger. You more than anyone understands how dangerous that can be,” said Tony.
He grabbed her shoulders tightly. “What did you tell her?!” yelled Winter.
“How?!”
She’d rather be with him near the science lab. Piper had gotten into some trouble when she hacked into S.H.I.E.L.D's network from the daycare's computer. She hadn't gotten far before she was caught. They'd tried getting a sitter but she acted out scaring them off. The only babysitters she tolerated were friends and family. Steve sighed, then woke her up and gave her breakfast.
“What did the bald guy want to talk about? He's probably the reason they are so mad.”
“Where’s Tony?”
“You can stay for lunch,” he said.
Steve put a thin bandage on each side of his neck. They took on the shade and tone of his skin. It was almost impossible to tell the difference. He uncomfortably moved his head from side to side. He was wearing a lie.
Piper instantly dashed over.
They got into one of the cars. To Steve, they all looked the same. All low to the ground sports cars meant for speed, not functionality. It was a long drive to Howard's estate.
“You look tired,” said Rune.
“Then prove it put down that hammer,” said Steve.
"Thanks, I guess."
“How are you feeling about this?” asked Rhodes.
“Fury,” he corrected.
“I know that!” Steve straightened his shoulders, fighting a primal instinct to make himself small at his alpha’s raised voice. He’d tried to purge his omega tendencies, that willingness to be owned, to obey. It was an easy habit to fall into with Tony since he trusted the alpha so deeply ... since Tony was always
“I just wouldn’t.”
“Why didn’t you ask for more?” Questioned a low voice from the hall.
Steve ran to him. The alpha had thrown on himself. Steve turned Tony on his side, clearing his air. He rubbed the alpha’s back. Tony threw up again.
“Talk to him,” he said.
Winter relaxed.
The cell phone moved.
“There, done. Give me back my books.” Piper started hiccupping. “You gave me the hiccups.”
"The usual?"
The didn't need an injured kid on his conscience.
“I know it’s a little over the top sometimes. It’s not entirely my fault; he has a tend…he's… he's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon wherever that is. Anyway, the point is ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky subtly kinda had its day,” said Killian.
“Word is you can find the cube,” said Steve.
“Tell him I’m going for a walk in Central Park,” said Steve.
“Jarvis,” said Tony.
Tony’s alpha swooned with pride. He created an environment Steve thought of as home. He caught Steve in a kiss.
"1975."
He nodded.
“Have you discovered anything?” asked Natasha.
"Tony-
“Downstairs in the library,” said Jarvis.
He looked at the flyers above them.
“I’m sorry I don’t know what came over me,” said Steve swiftly, backing away.
“They’re watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes you don’t want to see this.”
*****
"And that's what you're doing," affirmed Turner.
She smiled at him. “I knew I was being released today but wasn’t expecting you. What’s made you change your mind?”
“Okay.”
"No.” Natasha replied firmly. “And it stays that way until we reach New York. We won't be able to stop them from killing him."
“Maria, are you okay?” It was always the first question Pepper asked when she called after a mission.
“Stark, do you hear me?” asked Fury.
"What?" asked Steve.
There was no point in trying to deny it. “We had a fight."
His heart raced. Every time Tony said it made his heart race. He hoped it never lost that charm. “I love you too."
Steve flipped open his phone. He blushed, the phone’s neutral background was now a photo of him and Tony. It was of him sleeping peacefully on the alpha’s chest. In his contacts was Tony Stark’s number. He quickly snapped his phone shut.
“Kill him.”
"Why'd you wake me?"
She handed the device over to him. Winter flipped foreign object in his hands.
“No, just wanted to make sure you were there,” she said.
There was a small circular bruise over Steve's womb. At the center of it was a small prick. It could have easily gone unnoticed by the nurses.
She nodded. Steve's hand went to the gun chosen from him. It was lighter than he was used, but that was an improvement.
“No,” said Fury.
Blue light spread through her veins. Piper clenched her teeth as the power surged through her. She slid her fingers under the collar, ripping it off, and charged passed him. Running directionless through the halls. Alarms blared through the base. Piper's heartbeat was drumming in her ears. Her vision was fading. Piper's consciousness faded as the feral state took over. Her objective became clear as instinct took over. She needed to find her pack!
“I’ve been captured by an evil organization. My parents don’t want me. There’s no way of protecting myself, and no point, now.” Piper’s smile was mirthless.
"Coulson told me. Do you know when his funeral is?"
"Don't want you working on an empty stomach," said Steve.
Their hands rested over Steve’s stomach.
“It was the same way with me and Bucky. He treated me differently after I had my first heat. Buck, became overly protective of me didn’t treat me like he used to,” said Steve.
Tony flew past Natasha, speeding to Steve, landing next to him. Steve reflected his repulsor using it as a beam. Then took off again, knocked of Chitarui troops as he climbed up.
“Why is that relevant?”
“About?”
“Morning, sweetie.”
“He’s coming home today.”
“They’re surprisingly social creatures, each with their own personalities. I have to say I'll miss two of the specimens I was studying."
Natasha and Edith wouldn’t expose him. Steve resisted the urge to place his hand over his stomach.
“Found him passed out on the floor drunk. Gave me a scare,” said Steve.
“Have you told your doctor?” asked Rhodes.
"Your charms won't work on me this time," said Tony, avoiding Steve's flirtatious gaze.
“Sir, the telephone-
“You’re in shock. It's common for omegas who have recently lost their mates.”
“Can we cut this lesson a bit short?” asked Steve.
Steve nodded. He took Tony’s hand. Steve cringed when entered the hall. It smelled of his heat. He wanted to hideaway. Steve felt the eyes on him as they walked through S.H.I.E.L.D. Tony snarled at any alpha that got too close. They got to the car. Halfway through the drive, his heat started to spike. He squirmed.
“True, but you can do something they can’t.”
“I have one.”
"I've got her, go."
“I’ll never tell,” said Tony.
*****
“You don’t want to talk to me.”
“You should be with your pup.”
He remained by Steve’s side as nurses prepped him for surgery. Every time Steve showed the slightest sign of waking, Tony ran his fingers through that golden brown hair soothing him. A tall alpha brown-haired with a buzz cut came stalking into the room.
“You shouldn’t have to lie to us, Piper.”
“No.”
“He seemed so relaxed with me,” said Steve.
“Your loss,” she said.
“I’ll meet you at Avengers Tower at a more reasonable hour. Try and keep him calm until then."
His mate pulled him close, resting his head against his chest. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
"Lunch."
“No, it's functional; that's all it has to be," said Steve. He snagged the phone from the alpha, tossing it into his bag.
“He’s handsome, smart, and he can sing. Is there nothing the great Captain America can’t do?”
"It's difficult to say. None of the parts are truly unique and all had multiple uses. I'm having Jarvis compile a list of buyers. Maybe Natasha will have more for us. But we’ll have to give her time,” said Tony.
She pushed him back into his chair.
"But he's human." They all were even the bastard locked in the room behind her. "Sir only wants to talk to Steve get a rise out of him. Suicide by Avenger. It would glorify him as a martyr for his cause."
Thor walked over to him.
“If it were minor you wouldn’t be making a potato gun in our kitchen.”
“Did I glow?”
“Cape Town or Cuba maybe,” said Tony.
"Why?"
“Can you be more specific? Is it early or late? ”
“Better.” He turned in Tony’s embrace. Steve placed a quick peck on the alpha’s lips.
"When will you get in contact with, Star?" asked Bruce.
“Got into a fight with my boyfriend I needed some space and got locked out on the roof,” said Steve.
"I'm flattered."
Winter nodded.
"I'm not a spy, sir. I'm a doctor and a soldier, but not this," said Edith.
"I'm happy to be of service, Ms. Romanoff," said Jarvis.
Tony ran his fingers through his hair. It wasn’t only to keep Steve and the pup safe.
"Mmm, that could be a dangerous thing," said Tony.
As they went through their classes it became obvious that perfection was expected. However, perfection was more difficult to reach with such new subjects. Her knuckles were red from the whip of his ruler. The few times she did something correctly she was rewarded with a 'good girl', a pat on the head, or even a piece of candy. It had been so long since she had sugar. She almost appreciated the style of his teaching, at least what was expected of her was clear. With Lena, figuring out what was to be expected was difficult. Rarely was good behavior acknowledged and bad behavior was punished with such frequency.
*****
She put a thermometer in Steve’s mouth.
Killian nodded.
Steve looked flimsy weapon. He could snap it like a toothpick if he weren’t careful.
He nodded.
Tony made his grand entrance to his party, earning massive applause. His armor disengaged. He made his way through the crowd only mingling as much as necessary. Steve's powerful scent markers did a great deal to deter interested omegas and betas. He found his way to the bar and ordered a drink.
*****
"Iron Patriot," repeated Tony.
A new flood slick dripped down his thighs at the sight of it. He grabs the toy from the box. The toy had a gentle curve to it. Steve whimpered as he pulled his fingers away. He spread his legs, pressing it against his wet aching slit. Steve gasped as it pushed into his tightness. It touched the places his fingers couldn’t. Moaning in relief finally being full. There was an awkward moment when he searched for the button. His slippery fingers found a plastic groove and pressed one. He jolted in wonderful surprise started buzzing against all the right places.
“The name,” he said.
“Never tried it," he said. It actually sounded like something he may enjoy, but he had no photos. All his family photos were in a museum. He doubted the Smithsonian would return them to him.
“Please.”
“I don’t know what gamma radiation is?” he said.
put his life and the pup’s at risk.
“Heh, makes for an interesting story,” said Steve.
“You sound awfully confident,” said Tony.
“The baby!”
“S.H.I.E.L.D.”
“Sir, are you sure you’ll be able to keep up with his levels of stamina?” asked Jarvis.
Tony pressed his ear against the door, from within he heard Steve softly snoring.
Steve let the alpha lead him back to the guest bedroom.
“You’re always saying how I need good PR,” said Tony with a shrug of his shoulders.
Tony shrugged, not seeming to care. He went out onto the porch answered. A warm ocean touched his face. A minuscule part him missed the industrial smells he'd grown up with. He could get used to this kind of weather. It always seemed perfect.
"Alright."
“I apologize, sir, but this isn’t a project which can be rushed.”
“You don’t need my forgiveness."
“Captain Rogers has left the vicinity."
He paced the room, looking for danger. A gestured fueled by a mixture of paranoia and maternal instincts. When he was sure it was safe he took a seat at the end of the bed. He took off his dress uniform. Tony hung it up for him and tossed him a pair of gym shorts. Steve pulled them on and fell back into the bed.
“PIPER!” Even in this state, there was no forgetting that pain. His chest was heaving. The aggression and distress leaking off Steve was choking Tony.
"So this is how you've been managing your downtime," said Rhodes.
“I can come with you.”
Clint and Natasha nodded. She took the stat phone from her bag and called Phil. He picked up on the first ring.
*****
Tony got up a little while later. The alpha kissed him on the cheek before starting breakfast. Tony seemed more relaxed since Piper was born. He hadn’t gone the lab once so far preferring to work in the penthouse with them.
Steve barely resisted the urge to accept.
“Morning little one.”
“Steve, if that was true I would have already been exposed. I’m not showing any side effects. I’m only thinking out loud. You should try and sleep,” she said.
“It’s 2.1 miles away.”
“I’m spending it with you."
Steve coughed on his drink. "What did you say?"
“Sir, Director Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line,” said Jarvis.
“No.”
Tony reached out searching for Steve. He slowly got sat up. Steve's side of the bed was empty. From the bedroom, he smelled breakfast. He walked into the kitchen and found Steve and Rhodes talking.
“What does she want?” he said.
“I didn’t know we were expecting anyone,” said Steve.
“I’m under contract. I can’t tell you anything even if I wanted to,” said Tony.
Her corgi Watson jumped at his leg. He shooed away the stubby creature.
Loki grew twitchy.
“Yes.”
“I need you to meet me at the New York Facility. And bring your bow.”
“Likely, yes.”
Bloom was surprised when the girl complied with her previous request for closing her eyes.
He didn't respond, attention so focused elsewhere. Winter tried to decipher what he was hearing. The soft motorized whir wasn't from the same small plane that had taken away the doctor. This was a jet of some sort. Whoever was landing was meant to travel fast. They'd never sent a replacement for the woman’s absence before.
She whimpered. He started singing to her. When she fell asleep to the song, Tony took him off speaker.
"I'm sorry for not see it sooner." He cautiously approached his mate, gently touching their foreheads. "I love you, Tony."
“Rhodes, what happened?”
January 19, 2016
“No, I’ve actually been meaning to call you,” said Steve. He fiddled nervously with his paintbrush.
“Hopefully, but I’ll know more when we get the X-rays.”
Ned was panicking, had been since the signal to both Peter and the Oscorp factory had been lost. MJ had tried to re-establish the connection, had tried to call Peter over and over, but there had been no success. The two of them had debated for five minutes before deciding to go to the Avengers and get help.
“You’d rock the bald look, Rhodeybear.” Tony said, “Pete, Zach, say hi to Uncle Platypus.”
“My guy in the chair?” Peter repeated. The knot his stomach was tied in was lessening a little a Ned’s seeming easy acceptance, but he was still worried as he waited for MJ to give her response.
Stark Tower
“You use the big words, Jay, did I mention I’m too drunk on happiness for the big words?”
“And this is why he never gets included in making plans.” Natasha said with a roll of her eyes.
Lila had brought a new colouring book and pencils and sat with Steve to draw, while Clint helped Cooper set up scale-electrics, which of course got Tony and Peter’s interest and soon they were racing Car’s about the tracks at high speed, and Nate took to Thor, who bounced the toddler on his knee and made growling and roaring noises that had the little boy shrieking in delight.
“This will do for now, but you’ll need to see a Doctor.” Steve said taking Tony’s arm and carefully immobilized the limb, securing the spoons with the bandage.
As Peter went with Tony to put his little brother to bed, the others quietly went with Happy, getting towels and sheets from a closet on their way.
******
Clint he’d put in a simple black suit, with a black shirt, and a dark purple tie and matching pocket handkerchief. Like Bruce the archer was also sporting a rolex on his wrist, the only part of the outfit he wasn’t grumbling about having to wear.
“Damn right she is, have you seen those heels she wear? Lethal weapons I’m telling you!”
“Okay, so first thing in the morning, we get burner phones and start trying to contact Natasha.” Tony said, “J, will keep us updated on what’s going on with Shield and Hydra, Shieldra? That has so got to become a thing, I am officially making that a thing. Until we have some news, I guess we should rest up?”
At midnight Rogers and Natasha were taken into custody of the special task force sent to extradite them back to America. The power dampening collar was placed on Rogers’ neck robbing him of the serum and reducing him to the skinny asthmatic he had been before.
“It is stiff competition in such a place but the denizens are pretty chilled once you get to know them!” Tony made a pained noise and buried his face in his hands,
That was what everyone wanted wasn’t it? That was what Star Trek had been promoting, the utopian race where war, disease, deformity, and everything humanity struggled with right now was gone.
Zach ran through the darkened room and scrambled up onto one crate then pulled himself up on top of another, standing up he looked over the darkened hall seeing multiple crates lined up and huge storage bins. The door rattled behind him and Zach hurriedly ducked down, climbing back down onto the small crate and wedged himself into the shadows so he wouldn’t be spotted as the lights were flicked on.
It wasn’t helped by Steve asking him if he knew about the birds and the bees or if he needed another showing of Steve’s Sex Ed videos.
Steve set about pulling back the bed sheets and had Friday turn the Aircon on high in the bedroom so the bed could air while they were in the bath, he also brought through some candles which he lit about the bath and had Friday play quiet relaxing classical music to help them both relax.
“Huh leather, bet his ass would look good in that.” Someone snickered.
Steve had never asked a Father or a Guardian’s permission to court anyone before and was rather nervous when he finally came to asking Rhodey, who was rather taken aback by the request since Guardian Alpha’s no longer existed except in the cases of children and Pup’s being fostered.
“You cannot defeat me.” Thanos declared, “I am inevitable.”
At that point the lift pinged and Steve, dressed in an Armani tux, stepped out and Tony’s mouth went drier than the Sahara in a heat wave. Dear God, he put James fucking Bond to shame in that suit. All broad shoulders and firm muscles and chiselled jaw line… Tony was going to die of blue balls, he knew it, there would be a headline tomorrow, Billionaire dies from blue balled related heart attack after seeing Captain sexy as hell in a tux.
It also made Steve think of something else, something he had yet to speak about with Tony, but was also on his mind a lot. Deciding to test the waters he asked Peter his opinion.
“I think I understand what you are saying or trying to say.”
“What’s happened?” Steve asked, pulling Rhodey out of his thoughts,
“Yes, ma’am.” He went quiet then spoke up again. “All ready.”
Luna wheezed and held the paper bag in her hand tightly that she grabbed fro, the night stand. “Our wedding day. It’s two months away. I can hold out,”
“We have a home we can have you stay at while you figure things out. Either the children will pick or the court will. I will call child protective services,” Denice told them and got up from the table with her phone in hand.
“Hey! Watch where you're going mudblood!” A pale blonde boy yelled wearing a green, Slytherin, robe. He pushed her back into another kid.
Tony sat down in the chair and looked at the paper in front of him. Pepper put her hand on his shoulder. In his opinion, Pepper was his best lawyer and didn’t want anyone else to represent him. He slowly picked up the pen and signed his name on the X.
“Who the hell broke in now?” Clint asked rubbing his face. “Nice suit kiddo by the way.”
She nodded slightly and got up from the spot she’s been laying in for the past week. Grabbing out the black starry night strapless dress she wore to Tony’s funeral too. Slowly with Wanda’s help, they got her bathed and dressed within the hour.
“Absolutely. Stay with Peter for me, babe.”  Tony kissed Steve and took the blonde hair, blue eye girl down to the lab.
“Tony. I wanted to tell you, but you brought up the baby. And I want a baby with you. I thought maybe I could take family time and go later.” Steve confessed.
“I’m pregnant…”
“We have to figure something out!” Steve screamed back and blocked another of Tony’s punches. “They deserve to be in a stable home!”
Harry pushed open the door with everyone following. None of them knew that there was no floor on the bottom. They all were falling until Hermione caught them with the first spell she learned at Hogwarts: Wingardium Leviosa. When she let the spell go they landed in the sand.
The girl stiffened and gripped the cane trying to switch it to her other hand, but someone came up behind her with a gun to her back. “N-no comment. Dad… Papa… Happy. Happy!”
“I miss you guys even more. I hate school there. I like being close to you.” Luna confessed to him and rubbed Newts back.
“Continue, kid. We won’t bite. I told you this already.” Nick told her and sat sandwiches and bottles of water on the table.
“You seem distracted. Are you okay?” Bucky asked him and sat next to Steve. “You can talk to us punk jr.”
He was about to say something else when the two super soldiers came through the door and any words Tony could think of died on his lips. God damn it, he hated the affect they all had over him but he especially hated how seeing Steve and Barnes affected him.
“Anthony Edward Stark, put that Soldier down, get your pants on, and get out here!”
There was also the risk of Hydra, now they knew Peter and Zach were enhanced they would be targets for the deranged Nazis, especially since they were the Sons of Stark, one of Hydra’s sworn enemies.
“This is preposterous.” Steve said adding his own voice to the conversation, “How can such a man be given immunity and witness protection. He doesn’t deserve to be protected, not after what he’s done, and not just to our Son, but to those other people he experimented on.”
“Not got fleas.” Zach said, “Vet said so.”
“Mamma!” Zach’s worried cry was the last thing Tony heard as the connection was broken. With a strangled sob he released the Nuke, watching as it went into the Mother ship and exploded, the shock wave bursting out like a flare from a star, as his eyes closed, Tony whispered a final goodbye to Zach and Peter, falling back into the waiting darkness.
“Friends!” Thor greeted as he came up the beach glistening from his latest swim, “Have you still not erected your habitats for this night?”
He was right, Tony knew he was right, but damn it, he wanted this, he wanted to give Steve a baby so badly and his body wouldn’t do it. There was too much damage from previous injuries for him to conceive a baby, and even if he did, there was no guarantee his womb would even be strong enough to carry the child to term.
Grey hair was also a norm, there was hair dye but it was very harsh and people simply couldn’t afford it, not the type that stayed put longer than one wash anyway, henna was commonly used, as were other natural dyes to hide the grey.
Trevor glanced at Natasha who just smiled menacingly, he was not helped by the arrival of Clint either, who was wiping blood off his hands as he came in. Gulping Trevor began to explain how he had a problem with substances, (Yeah, no shit.) And how he’d ended up doing things on the streets for his fix.
“On my way back yeah, I went for a run through the park,” Steve said, “Met a fan of yours, a little boy who never takes off his costume.” He grinned, “He was a real sweetheart, reminded me of Zach at that age.”
Unsurprisingly Ross and Stern did not miss a chance at getting a dig in at Tony, while they offered their “Condolences” they also pointed out how unsurprising it was for a civilian and an amateur to become injured when engaging in something they did not fully understand like warfare and combat.
“We won,” said Steve.
Part of him was tempted to call Tony but now wasn’t the right time.
He nodded.
"What happens now?" Would they just follow the routine they always had? The only difference being the room.
“Nope.”
Loki grew tired of the man before him. He stalked toward him. “And how will your friends have time for me when they are so busy fighting you?” He tapped his scepter to man’s chest. There was a harmless clink and nothing. He tried again. The same result. “This usually works."
“Was that who I thought it was?” asked Foggy.
*****
“Looking forward to our dinner,” said Tony, speaking through the intercom system.
"I hate the woman, but I have full faith in her professional skill," said Tony.
“I’ll start compiling a list,” said Miria.
“You could have been nicer, Piper. He seemed okay,” said Rune.
“He’s not ready, yet.”
"I'm so glad the two of you are okay," said Pepper. She took several steps away from Tony when she saw the claim marks on their necks. "I only stopped by to see if the two of you were okay. And congratulations on the bond. I've already set Stark Industries as clean up for this incident. I'll start working on a plan to disclose your relationship."
“Trophy,” said Steve.
“How much longer, Dr. Zemo?”
"Than what was it?" he asked.
“I don’t get why you like doing that stuff so much.”
“Not to her health, but he likely found some element that will make her dangerous,” said Tony.
Steve breathed in Tony’s scent. It was of earth, clove, with slight tones metallic. The alpha’s scent was odd yet so appealing. It was so different from any alpha’s he’d encountered. His heart continued racing, and his body warm. Being close to the alpha would speed up his heat, but he couldn't part from the enticing scent. He whined when Tony broke the closeness. The alpha caressed his face. The touch was electric, making him shiver. Tony seemed equally affected. His gaze held the same shock, but he was quick to gather himself.
"I want to. I want this to be home to you."
It was that pleading voice which beckoned him back to reality. Tony stared worriedly over him.
Tony kissed both of them on the forehead before fading into sleep as well. Whining woke him only a few hours later. The smell instantly told him what was wrong with the infant. He groaned he'd been dreading this moment. When he took her from Steve, the omega's eyes snapped open. He snarled at him, tucking the pup closely to him. Several seconds went by before Steve realized it was him.
“I’m Dr. Ben Kildare I’m calling on behalf a Harold Joseph Hogan. You were his emergency contact."
Steve bit back his frustration. This was Tony's main deflection technique. Tony was upset with him but now wasn't the time. Their issues could be put aside while they dealt with the greater good. He needed the alpha to be serious and actually listen to him. Whatever personal issues they were having they could wait.
“Good, you want to keep him,” said Fury.
The fabric bit uncomfortably into his skin.
It wasn’t that simple. If it were any other normal person she’d agree.
“Mmm, puppy dog eyes from Captain America. As much as I would love to bend you over the couch and make you scream in pleasure, I am a selfish man wouldn’t want to share such a view,” said Tony.
“Of course, sir.”
“Did my reputation surpass me, or did I met expectations?"
*****
“I was nearly killed by my own weapon. The irony of the moment didn’t escape me. The explosion sent shrapnel into my heart. I should have died in that desert."
A little while later Steve and Tony went to the bedroom. They went into the bathroom. Before he could ask Tony handed him a spare toothbrush.
“Bye Tony."
“Do you want to dance?”
She smiled. He was genuine.
“Doctor as in scientist or doctor as in medicine?”
“You didn’t have to Tony." He didn't even know when Tony would have had the time to get him a gift.
“It’s Iron Patriot now.”
“Stand down!” he ordered.
The alpha stood on the other side of the room. He tried bridging the gap, but Tony back further away.
“That’s what everyone says.”
“Who are you?” she asked.
She didn’t have many opportunities to find friends, even before being taken. The chances she had taken were all disappointments. They all proved uninteresting. Rune proved fascinating from the start. Even his name was interesting. Hopefully, there was more to him than that. Just him being here meant he was something special.
Tony hung up. The elevator opened on his lab floor.
She slowly backed him into a corner.
They had a mission now wasn't the time to think about romance.
The rest of his day was spent locked away in his apartment. On his desk were several large stacks of books. Coulson got them for him. They ranged wildly in subjects. He sorted through the book stopping on a familiar title The Hobbit. It came out when he was nineteen. The colorful blue and green mountain range on the cover was what first drew him to the book. He'd bought it on an impulse. Steve fell in love with the story. He related to Bilbo. Reading the book so many times that its spine broke. Bucky bought him a new one. He settled on the couch with the book.
“There you go,” said Steve.
“I knew it!” shouted Rune.
“It’s Tony Stark."
“I just need a minute," said Tony.
Bloom saw the instant shift that took place in the girl’s expression. Gone was the innocence that she’d just previously displayed to her parent. It was a cold analyzing look that gave little away. Piper climbed up the rock wall then hopped onto the monkey bars, sitting perched there.
Steve flinched at the comparison. “That isn’t the point.”
“Thank you for telling me,” said Steve Steve nuzzled close to him.
Hill carefully rocked a shivering boy in her arms. Sir released to straps locking the boy’s crate. Hoping it would crash into her and knock her out of the jet. At the last moment, the boy had broken free. If he hadn’t the cage would have surely slammed into her and thrown her out the end of the plane. When the child refused to attack, Sir jetted the plane vertically, sending them both tumbling out. She barely to catch herself and the child.
*****
Natasha entered the jet. The boy tensed in Maria's arms. His eyes glowed, and bluish-white sparks of electricity shot around them, wrapping protectively around Maria.
Tony was the last person he should be lashing out against. He needed his mate more than ever.
“Because he had as much choice in it as I had. None!”
“Okay, Winter.”
"In about a week I'll be able to take that sample," said Edith.
“Don’t cry.”
“Yes, the d-stress,” said Natasha.
“You aren’t. You’ll sleep now.”
“It will be fine.”
*****
“Make want you of it."
“We have to talk with Banner once the pups," said Tony.
“Back to business where were we? The guy who died. Relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis where is she?”
“I was under the impression she’d be ready on arrival.”
“Thank you, Piper. I’ll be going now. It was nice meeting you two,” said George.
“Interrogation,” she said.
"Go," said Steve.
Steve got out of the car.
"Anxiety-inducing."
“Should I get her?” asked Nat.
Jet lag wouldn’t allow him to sleep. Steve took the knife from his utility belt, cutting open the boxes. They were filled with high-end art supplies. There were watercolors, charcoal, a large assortment of oil paints, canvas, sketchbooks, and stretcher bars. It was a dream art kit. He found a note inside:
A small hand shot around his fingers, crushing the bones of his fingers. Rune instantly released his grip.
Barnaby leaned against the boxing ring, watching him.
Tony traveled beside a giant battle worm. His laser was useless against thick metal plating.
“That’s not the same.”
“She’s hurting more than she’s letting on. Something she learned from us.”
“What?”
“Your daughter. We found a partial print on one of the pieces,” said Fury.
Piper set up the pieces. She turned the queen in hand. Time had made her more aware of the power dynamics here. But there were still too many blanks. This place was part of something bigger. She was sure of it. A place like this couldn't exist on its own. Even in whatever secluded setting, they were located, Lena wasn’t queen; she couldn’t move however she wanted. She was reporting to someone. No, she was a bishop. Who was king? A king may not be able to move; however, it pleased, but it had power. They were rules on how it could be used even here. Those rules for the king's protection to keep him out of the fray.
Natasha stared at his stomach.
“Five hours.”
“Can I have the next dance?” asked Tony.
They'd been Steve's recent food of choice.
Tony's gaze locked on the blood. He took Steve's hand running, it under the water. The blood cleared seconds later. The cut had sealed. Steve moved his hand away, drying it on his pants.
“I don’t care if I have to drag you out we’re leaving today!"
“I don't want you to give up unless you want to. That's your choice.”
Steve opened his eyes from his most recent blackout he couldn't stay conscious longer than ten minutes. He rested on his side, pressing his fevered skin against the cool cement floor. His heart was beating rapidly. He bit back a whine as Extremis coiled through his aching muscles.
We've found her. Assemble at the jets," said Steve over the communicator.
Steve hung up his phone, tucking it back into his pocket.
Two months passed since Steve’s episode, and things were calming down. The most eventful part of the month was Pepper's engagement to Maria Hill. Meeting with Turner regularly was paying off. There were still nightmares, but there weren't intense or as frequent as before. There were bad days, but Tony was there for him. The brief disconnection he felt with Piper was mended. He was snugly tucked in bed with his family. Steve sighed. Tomorrow they were meeting with Dr. Wu. He'd put this off long enough. Piper squirmed against him.
“I will begin the scan now. Please, remain still,” said Jarvis.
The weekend went peacefully. Monday morning Tony's phone rang, waking him.
“She is, isn’t she,” said Tony. He waited for Happy to pull out of the driveway before walking to the front door. He rang the doorbell. The large wooden door creaked open. He was greeted by a warm crinkled smiled.
“How long will that take?”
“Where is he?!” asked Tony.
“Jarvis."
"They won six, but Dodgers aren't in Brooklyn."
"What?"
“Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in,” he said.
Tony ran his hands down Steve's back. "I told you too."
Lena would always have that over her. If, by some miracle, she were to escape, what would they do to Winter? He was too valuable to kill. But they'd hurt him badly. Likely blame him for her escape.
Kevin nodded.
"What if you weren't okay?"
It caught him so off guard. It took some time for the surprise in his expression to fade.
as an avenger is to protect and rescue – so much of what I do with Jarvis for the team is finding answers. My -” Tony waved his hand as if to pluck out the right word, “
“How are you handling this?” asked Rhodes.
“Mommy, you’re squeezing me too tight,” said Carl.
“I’ll be back a soon as I can.”
“Does Loki need any particular power source?” he asked.
Tony sighed, realizing the issue. He took a bite of everything on the plate. The pups watched him waiting for an ill effect. "It's safe."
“Jarvis."
He blushed. “I know who I want my parents to be.”
“You shoulda ate while you had the chance.”
Part three, "Disconnect" will as soon as possible.
“Ten.”
"Returning your phone. Natasha called."
“I’ll be flying back to New York after breakfast. Feel free to hitch a ride,” he said.
“Tony?”
She gave him the cards. He stared at them.
“It’s fine. My profession must be a slight surprise,” said Edith.
“Steve, look at me.” Their eyes met. “You don’t have to hold it in. You can scream and shout as much as you want nobody will think any less you.”
The reason Steve had seen the flash of red in Tony’s eyes that night had been because he had felt hope at Steve’s declaration of love. Wanda’s spell had trying to prevent him from feeling anything but despair and had flared up when he’d felt hope at Steve’s words.
“Help me!” The man wheezed, “Get me out of here!”
But also his views on the legalization of homosexuality and homosexual marriages.
“Aye, let us move the large pieces of debris between us.” Thor declared moving to assist Hulk in shifting the huge slabs of concrete and steel beams from the wreckage, allowing those without super-human strength and heat proof skin to move the smaller bricks and metal.
“You haven’t seen his coffee consumption yet.” Steve shot back.
Steve sighed heavily, “How long has this been going on?” He asked, “How long have you been dealing with this?”
“Uh it’s Morgan.” Tony said, “Morgan Heidi Rogers-Stark.” Vision set him down on the bonnet of one of the disabled cars and Steve placed Morgan back into his arms. “This is the outside world Morgan, look, that’s your first look at the sky, there is a reason why its blue and I’ll explain that to you one day, I’ll teach you all about the Ozone, the atmosphere, solar system and how all of it works.”
“I can make pancakes.” He offered.
“I can take them both down with Nat and Sam.” Steve said to Tony.
“Kay. Love you Mamma.”
“Hi.”
“My team is here.” Tony laughed even as more pain hit, “You are a screwed now, so screwed.” He grunted as the pressure in his pelvis increased. Blood flowed out of him, soaking into the bedsheet as the birth canal widened.
“Please, we need to see Mr Stark right now.” MJ cried, “It’s about his Son.”
Since Tony's focus was solely on Peter, Pepper had taken charge in ordering a lawsuit against Oscorp for negligence resulting in severe injury, this was just the civil suit that Norman was facing from Tony's personal lawyer, a criminal investigation was also underway and while it was ongoing Oscorp Tower had to be vacated and all trading cease until the conclusion of the investigation.
The tension in the room seemed to increase at this, silence falling until Vision spoke up, “It seems we have a lot to talk about.”
Steve laughed, “My youngest, Zach has a similar obsession with Doctor Who, he has an outfit that he adores to wear all the time and is determined to become a Time Lord.”
*****
“No.” Steve said placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “No IVF, no surrogate. I don’t want to put you through that, I don’t want to go through all that.”
“What does this mean for Iron Man?”
“I understand.” Jarvis said, “I shall remain outside Sirs room and stand guard, two legionnaires shall accompany Master Peter and Master Zach….” He paused noticing Zach’s absence.
“Hmm, that doesn’t look okay.” Fury said having turned back from the window, “The rash on your neck, your sudden decision to start giving away your stuff, up dating your will, all leads me to conclude that you are a very sick man.”
“Its to cover red skin.” Natasha explained, “You should try it over your nose, you have terrible thread veins.”
“It’s be cool if you did.” One of Lydia’s friends said coming to join them, “Having an Avenger at the party would be seriously cool.”
“Yeah it worked great.” Steve agreed, “We might make a regular thing of it.”
He sighed and bit his lip, “How do I tell him Pep?” He asked her, “Why should he have to suffer because of me and my bodies weakness?”
“He’s a Lawyer.” Steve said, “If anyone can advise you on what to do, and be discreet, it’ll be him. Plus, he can probably put together a defence for Bucky, so that he will be treated fairly and not just thrown in prison.”
With Steve it was so different.
“And proud of it!”
Sniffing hard he picked up plenty of scents on the air, food, perfume, car exhaustions, alcohol, drugs, animals, and the familiar scent of MJ.
“I assume you have reason for being here other than to share insults with Stark, Sir?”
“Hey Steve?” Came Tony’s sleepy voice, “Friday said something about someone on the side of the building…” he broke off when he saw Deadpool, “Oh God.”
Shouldering his bag Steve went around the corner to the car park where his bike awaited him, one other possession that had survived through to the twenty-first century. He took pleasure in revving the engine before he pulled out of the car park, pleased that he’d let Happy head back to Stark Tower without him as it meant he had the freedom riding his Motorbike always brought him.
“Leave it J.” Tony said, wiping his mouth and getting to his feet, “This is my mess to clean up not his. And’s it’s just a bit of sickness and bloating, its not like I’m dying or anything.”
Tony screamed and screamed as blood gushed from the stumps of his thighs, unable to look away as his family pulled his severed legs away and tossed them into the burning earth cheering as they turned to ash.
“Look Mamma, I drawd you fightin’” Zach said showing Tony a picture of Iron Man fighting grey blobs that were supposed to be the chitauri.
*****
Security was keeping the fuckwits away from the hospital, but they were in the car park, outside of the tower, chanting their bigoted bullshit and waving their signs.
“Stop him!” Rhodey shouted as he clutched his aching leg, Steve ran for Zach but the boy ran out of the door and tore down the corridor to the stair well.
*****
“That he didn’t want you to go through all of this, Yes, you did. But you have made this choice without him and now you have to face the consequences for that.” Pepper glared at him, “Talk to him Tony. Relationships need open communication, not secrets and half-truths. If you can’t trust him enough to support you through this, then there is no point in you marrying him.”
It wasn’t fair. None of this was fair. Not to them and especially not to the boys.
“I won’t let anyone hurt you, I promise.” He swore, “I will help you in any way that I can, I will get you the best legal representation there is and insist that you be granted house arrest until there can be a court date to straighten everything out.”
For second or two there was nothing, and then there was the most magical sound Tony had ever heard in his life.
Clint was in a pair of swimming trunks that were so bright that actually made the eyes hurt, he also had several inflatable toys and hamper full of beer.
Steve stared at Natasha, half amazed she had read him so clearly and annoyed that she had been able to do so.
“Behave yourselves.” Steve said, “Call if you need anything.”
He never mentioned these glimpses to the Handlers, he knew what it would mean if he did, more time in the chair, more pain, more feeling like his brain was being turned to scrambled eggs.
“Many Nazi scientists with strategic knowledge were hired after the War, not just by America, but Russia, Britain, any of the major powers looking to advance after the War.” Tony said, “Zola, being Skull’s right hand man, would have been a snapped up.”
“Call him.” Steve said.
“Steve….”
“Can still beat you half to death.” Natasha stated dryly, and well, there was no arguing with that.
Tony rolled his lips, “But how can I ever make up for mine?” He asked in a small and shaky voice and a single tear rolled down his cheek, “After all I have done how can I ever make amends?” Steve softened, he stretched out a hand to Tony, who sat up to take it,
Steve wasn’t going to argue with that, his son and his fiancé were in there, somewhere beneath that rubble, he wasn’t going to wait for back up to get in there.
“Here we go.” Steve murmured readying his shield.
Natasha then alerted Sam and Vision, letting them know of Steve’s suspicions regarding Wanda’s treatment of Tony. A detective might well say that the evidence was circumstantial, but, Wanda had a history of mind manipulation and a hatred of Tony Stark, so it was not a huge leap to suppose that she might be carrying out a vendetta against him.
Jane, Eric, and Darcy remained for several weeks, but then Eric was called away to work on a project in Switzerland and Jane was offered a position at NASA along with Darcy. Thor was saddened to see his friends and his lover depart but with the promise of a quinjet at his disposal to have them flown to New York, and his ability to fly himself to Washington he soon brightened up again.
Steve jumped slightly as Jarvis’ voice came over the coms.
“Ha, I’m gonna boy out Stark Industries, and then I’ll make you get me tuna sandwiches!” Harley shot back. While several people gasped and the Avengers giggled enjoying the interaction with the sassy kid and Tony, the Billionaire himself shrugged.
“Oh, no, we don’t have that anymore.” Tony said with a grin, “That went out sometime in the seventies I think, no, Rhodey is only a friend, not my guardian.”
Tony also began to work on a training plan for Zach. He needed to be able to control his abilities and not start lashing out with them by mistake if he got worked up as they could result in him hurting someone by accident.
Rhodey was waiting for them outside and was just finishing a call on his phone, “You’re not gonna believe this.” He said,
“What of the brother?” Sam asked,
Tony was still half-asleep as he made his way down stairs to the kitchen. He vaguely recalled something bouncing of his head earlier but had gone back to sleep since then so he might have been dreaming.
“I’m amazed you survived at all.” Natasha cleared her throat, “We should arrange to meet.” She said, “A location, preferably public, a crowd will grant us anonymity.”
“I am not.” Pepper scoffed, “And you are not fat.”
Even as his body wanted to fall limp, Steve kept a firm hold on Tony, carefully lowering him down so he was laying back on the bed, then he slid out from between the Omega’s legs and lay down with his head on Tony’s chest.
Rhodey’s laughter followed him to the lift as Steve headed after Tony, leaving Rhodey to wrangle the boys once they’d finished unpacking and got bored and/or hungry and came out of their respective dens to terrorize the local neighbourhood in search for amusement and food.
“Get him out of here Jarvis.” Tony ordered, “Take him home.”
“Purchase all the land around there.” He instructed, “All the way to within a mile radius of civilians. Then lets look into make it all defensible, shielding in the ground to rise up twenty, no make that thirty feet and lets look into creating some kind of roof. Once we get the fuckers in there lets keep ‘em there. No one in and no one out until Thanos is a rotting corpse on the ground, even if I have to ram a nuke up his ass sideways and use Deadpool’s body as a hammer to beat it in there!”
“Steve?” Tony frowned looking to the Captain who was equally perplexed. “What the hell?”
“You compare hospitals to prisons.” Peter said,
Beta Women and Omega’s now had equal rights with Alphas and Beta Men, or at least a lot more rights than they had in the forties. Gay marriage was legal, Alphas could marry other Alphas or Beta Men, Omegas could marry other Omegas and Beta Women.
"Where is my Son, can I see him?" Tony demanded of her.
Tony was confused, not able to understand what Steve was saying or what he meant. But as Steve stood, looking for his discarded trousers, obviously intending to leave he called out to him, “Wait, what?”
“Yeah sure.” Tony snorted, “And I’ll give you a bedtime story and kiss goodnight!” It was probably good that he’d shut the lights down since he didn’t see the flush on Steve’s cheeks as they headed out of the lab and back into the main house.
If Sam’s eyes had been wide before they were dinner plates now, “Holy shit, Captain America!, I’ve got Iron Man and Captain America in my backyard at two in the morning.”
“You’re gonna start turning green soon and getting all big like Uncle Bruce.”
Tony flushed, he was flirting with Steve and Peter had noticed? Noticed enough to tell Zach about it?
To his horror the Doctor ignored him, taking his daughter and placing her into a travel cot which the eye patch man picked up by the handle not even bothering to glance at the baby, “Bring Stark as soon as you have finished with his post delivery.”
“Well something was tingling, if you know what I mean,” Wade replied, “But then it often does when I think of that Stark ripe piece of ass!”
“After I’ve dropped the munchkins off at school.” Tony replied, “Give or take on traffic I can be back here for 9.30 am?”
As he came to what seemed to be a dead end he pushed in one of the bricks until it hit a mechanism which pushed it to the side revealing a palm scanner which Kovarian pressed his hand against, once the scan had been taken the wall slid back revealing the tunnel.
“It is, Captain Steven Grant Rogers of the US Army, and Captain America of the Avengers,” he sagged, his face falling, “Or I was,” There was a story there, a terrible explanation for why he was here, and Tony would ask him, but right now, the baby needed feeding.
“Can you heat sand until it becomes glass?” One of the more academically advanced kids asked.
Peter was another matter. He was too old to be fobbed off, he couldn’t be so easily distracted, he knew that there was something going on and it was inevitable that he would ask, so Happy and Bruce were not surprised when he approached them, leaving Zach engrossed in his colouring on the floor before a Dr Who DVD.
“What of the Baron?” Thor asked changing the subject, “We should also focus on finding him should we not.”
“Asshole, you are meant to comfort me not insult me.” Tony complained as he splashed water on his face. “And how did Steve even find those damn injections, did you tell him?”
“You are family too.” Tony said cutting off Steve’s stammering, “You are totally a part of this madness and I’m happy to have you as a part of it, as are the boys.”
Everyone took a dessert each, while he and Tony had several. The best being the Plum tartine which Tony handed to Bucky with a grin knowing he’d love it, which he did, savouring each mouthful. He felt himself smile and Winter chuckle a little in his mind as Tony and Rhodey had a spoon fight over the profiter rolls which the both of them lost when Matt grabbed them for himself and ate them with a smug expression on his face.
“How long…?”
With Peter safely off to school, Bruce down in his lab with enough tea and snacks to keep from needing to surface before dinner, the rest of the team go themselves ready to meet the documentary crew.
“If I may suggest, perhaps you should look up the components of Spider Silk and work from there?” Jarvis offered.
“Fuck you!” This remarkably came from Tony who had pulled himself out of his state of shock and was now glaring Rogers as if he were the lowest form of pond scum he had the displeasure of seeing before him. “You think Howard was too lenient?” he asked in a mocking tone, “He wasn’t lenient, or easy going, he just didn’t give a flying fuck about me unless it was to parade me in front of the cameras for publicity, the rest of the time he couldn’t have cared less if I was breathing or not, and as for discipline? Do you want to the scars from when he took his belt to me when I was five? Do you want to guess how many stitches I needed after he beat me bloody while he was pissed out of skull and fucked off because he hadn’t been able to find your sorry arse in the arctic?” Tony was shaking with rage now, he didn’t seem to notice or care that this was being recorded, or that everything that was happening would be on the internet within the hour, the only thing he could focus on was the Super Solider before him who had finally pushed him into releasing the hurt and frustration that he’d kept bottled up for so long.
“Different as in I’m enhanced.” Peter said in his whisper, “The spider bite enhanced me. It’s made me super strong and fast, really agile, and I can stick to things, and my sense are all really heightened. For the first few weeks I couldn’t be without dark glasses or noise cancelling headphones and could only wear really soft clothing because my senses were completely overloaded.”
“You’re welcome.” Steve said as Pepper took the flowers to put them in water and Natasha and Bruce urged the two on their way so they didn’t miss the movie they were going to see before they went to dinner.
“See, you’ll feel better soon.” Steve said to Peter, giving his son a reassuring smile. Peter gave a pained groaned and shut his eyes tight trying to block out the too bright lights around him.
“Left you with a hicky and enough money for the cab fair?” Tony drawled, “Yeah, story of that bastards life.” He rolled his shoulders, “I may not remember you that well, but I don’t recall you being psychotic back then.”
"Now Son, can you tell me your name and date of birth?" The Doctor asked once Peter caught his breath.
Steve sighed and nodded, “Do you think taking Peter for a run would help him, maybe clear his head?”
*****
“Where is Sir now?” Jarvis asked,
Under no Circumstances will the Avengers do any of the following:
“I’ll take those suggestions under consideration.” Steve said kicking the last soldier out of his way and running into the building, he paused and looked back at Natasha who waved him on.
“Uh huh.”
Steve grinned, “Worried I’ll outshine you?”
My Father would tell me that it is time I take my place as Asguard’s King, but my heart tells me that the time for my reign is not yet.” A look of pain passed over Thor’s face and he closed his eyes to prevent tears from falling, “I would always seek my Mother’s guidance at such times of uncertainty and now that she is gone, I know not where to turn.”
He couldn’t help but hear the womans screams, the sound of her body being violated, the grunts of the rapist, the smell of them. It all turned Peter’s stomach and for over a weeks he couldn’t face going back out onto the streets.
“Everybody, stand down!” Rhodey bellowed, bringing War machine in for landing.
For the first few weeks this was difficult as he suffered sickness, heartburn, and nausea. He was also repulsed by all fish so that had to be crossed of the list of foods even though they were one of the best he could eat.
“You can have a beer or something if you want to, I don’t mind.” Tony said, “Just because I’m alcohol free doesn’t mean you have to be too.”
The last thing Tony wanted was to hurt Steve or to make him think that he didn’t trust him or his word, biting his bottom lip and leaving forward as much as he could Tony tried to convey that to the super soldier, “Its not that I don’t trust you…”
*****
Rogers let out an explosive sigh and ran a hand through his hair, beginning to pace, “God sakes Tony, when will you get it through your head that there is no Thanos?” he demanded, “We defeated him, we nuked him and his army, they’re gone, there is no threat except from Hydra, and instead of focussing on that, you’d have everyone preparing for some fairy tale villain from out of space!”
******
Butterfingers beeped as him and whirred off to go and tidy the work bench, somehow succeeding in making more mess than ever, and upsetting Dumm-E, who was on dusting duty, with a stained, torn, and completely disgusting rag that was smearing more oil everywhere than it was clearing it up. Butterfingers got in his way, setting dirty engine parts back onto the table after Dumm-E had “Cleaned” it. The two angrily beeped and trilled at each other until Tony broke their fight up and sent them to opposite sides of the labs for time out.
Tony’s eyes lit up with hope for the first time since he’d learned of his paralysis, “Let’s get these designs completed and fabricated, I want a prototype ready to go as soon as I am released from my incarceration.”
“Lemme go!” Zach cried struggling against the man who’s hand seemed to be burning him it hurt so much. The two men who’d been looking for him soon joined them, holstering their guns and glaring at Zach.
“Watch it Munchkin or you’ll be grounded.”
Tony jerked up and forced a smile, “I’m fine.” He said, “It was… not pleasant. Nor something I want to talk to you about.” He held up a hand when Peter went to protest, “That’s not what we need to talk about, it’s you that’s important here.”
Tony saw it, saw the home in his mind. Some under funded, neglected shit hole, being run by people who didn’t care and spent most of the government funds on themselves while the kids were left in threadbare clothes, survived on one meal a day, and lost any faith they had in humanity.
It was something he could do, he could still work for SI, send his designs via email, he could teach the boys himself along with Steve, and they could have food deliveries made monthly. It would be a solution from the scrutiny, but it would leave them isolated, it would deny Peter and Zach the chance to socialize, to have “Normal” childhoods, they would grow up in isolation completely cut off from the rest of the world. That was not what Tony wanted for them, he wanted them to live freely not hidden away like dirty secrets, doing that would be like he was agreeing with the bigots, that Peter and Zach didn’t belong in the regular world, which was completely untrue.
“But he is here.” Steve bit his bottom lip and shifted uncomfortably, “We even worked with Deadpool once!”
Swallowing hard, Rogers cleared his throat, “Tony I…”
By the end of the dinner a pressure had built up and Tony had to excuse himself to the bathroom fearing that his stomach upset was about start coming out of the other end, however nearly ten minutes of cramping and moaning afforded him nothing.
Steve typed out another message for Peter, “Get some sleep champ, the tests are going to take a few hours and you need to rest.”
“If I’m careful can I tie Dad’s bike on the roof of the car and see if I can lift them both together?” Peter asked then his eyes widened, “Hey you could sit on the bike, it’ll be like recreating when Dad lifted the bike with the show girls, only better.”
“I can do a hell of a lot of things with it too!”
“Love you too, Tash.” Tony sing-songed back at her gleefully shooting down several more Bots, only to take a heavy blast to the side himself.
“You won’t be. Look at Bruce. At first he thought he would never be able to be around people, that he was too dangerous, but look at him now.” Tony said confidently, “Hulk works with us, he’s dangerous but only to those who are threatening others, he hasn’t randomly gone berserk.”
"Shame, that would be fast at least." He reached over and grabbed the bottle of whiskey that was sitting on the bar.
Tony could hear the pain and hurt in his voice, it caused his own eyes to water with tears but if there's one thing Howard ever taught him it was that Stark men don't cry. "What's going on Steve?"
It seemed like someone was going to interrupt him when he heard Natasha whisper not to disturb the genius.
"What do we do now Steve?" Bucky knew that they had underestimated Tony too much they needed to work so much faster.
"Steve has a good point, come on I'll show you around. I'm sure Shuri is dying to meet you anyway." Natasha said and Tony wasn't sure if he wanted to accept, he didn't know whether he wanted to get that close to them. After everything that happened wasn't this all just a little too easy? Then again Steve might have just told them to be nice to him since he was here to help them.
“Uh huh, Me and Pete have some in our bucket.”
Came the responses from Sam and Clint.
But they could cause; Over stimulation of the ovaries resulting in a rupture. Ovarian cysts, phantom pregnancy, heavy post heat bleeding with a large amount of clots.
He took his hands away from his ears and gazed at the dead, decaying bodies of his family and friends, pleading with them to stop blaming him, “I’m sorry.” He whispered, “I did everything I could.”
“Finish that sentence and it’ll be the last thing you do.”
Rogers grit his teeth, “He is not my brother,”
“It so totally does,” Tony grumbled, slurping his coffee, a noise that made Lily giggle, she extended her hands towards Tony, wriggling and looking hopeful. To her, this was her other Father, he looked similar enough that her infant mind had accepted him as her Father without question.
He didn’t think that he had ever felt more proud though, having the adorable little boy calling him Daddy and bouncing along besides him as they walked through the streets. Not even the success of his rescue of the soldiers from Hydra had filled him with as much pride as this did.
“Mr Stark? Oh my, let’s get you cleaned up.”
Because there would be nothing there. Yeah, that made sense, Tony wasn’t stupid enough to have pills or whatever in there where Steve would see them.
*****
“I do.” Tony said desperately, in his minds eyes he saw this all falling apart very quickly if he didn’t resolve things fast. “I do trust you, I love you and I know you love me, I just want to make you, make us happy.”
“Well his Mom still lives in town. She goes to the bar most days, she’s been pretty messed up ever since.”
*****
“he means family.” Matt put in,
Steve stood, resolved to help Tony. He couldn’t change the past, couldn’t stop what Howard had already done, but he could ensure that Tony suffered no more than he already had.
“Is that a polite way of saying you want us piss off?” Tony drawled. “Isn’t it lovely, you raise them, give them everything they could ever possibly want and what do they do, do they appreciate it, give you any gratitude?”
Tony let out a deep breath, “Jesus, Pep. What the hell am I supposed to say about that?”
“Why are they doing that?”
“You realize he’ll be awake at dawn and want to go straight to the beach.” Peter said with a wry grin.
“I know.” Steve said, “You’re a good boy Peter, and you’ll be a hell of a superhero. But one step at a time, okay?”
Tony narrowed his eyes at his Son, “You’re grounded.” He said, “And you!” He poked Steve in the stomach and the super soldier let out a grunt more from reflex than actual pain. “You are supposed to be the adult here, the responsible one. I am relying on you to be the responsible one in this relationship because I am unable to be responsible about anything and everything, and Peter Benjamin Parker Stark, you put a single scratch on any of my cars an, you will be grounded until you’re a thirty!”
If something did develop between the two of them, then Pepper would not be surprised. But she suspected that it would take a while before they stopped dancing around each-other and realized that what they were feeling was being reciprocated.
They however didn’t stay in them longer than stowing their stuff, they went up to the common room which Pete had been granted full use of for the duration of his slumber party. The rest of the family would on their own floors, or in Tony’s case in the lab, and Zach either with him or Steve or in his room.
Neither needed to be told twice, happily vacating the directors office and going back to the life where they were met by Rumlow and his strike team. Steve subtly put himself between Tony and the team of Alphas. He kept his hands loose at his sides but his muscles were all tensed and ready to fight if necessary. The heavy scent of Alpha in the air did nothing to ease his concerns for Tony. Out numbered and out of his suit he was in serious danger if things turned nasty.
“I’m pathetic Jay.” He complained to the AI.

MJ was certainly fast, that was for sure, and she was keeping moving, she wasn’t just staying it one place, that would be too easy, so she was continuing to run, stopping only long enough to catch her breath before moving on.
“Did he just nod off?” Tony asked screwing his face up in disgust. Natasha snarled under her breath and slapped the back of his head.
Zach came and sat on Steve’s lap with Peter at his side. No one had any news for anyone, they were still just waiting for the surgery to end. They were still waiting when Rhodey arrived a short while later and took up the spare seat on Steve’s left, his armour stationed at the end of the room besides the door.
“He’s fine,” Rogers grunted, getting to his feet, “Did you hit me?” he asked, rubbing his face again.
“I’m sorry Zach, I’m sorry honey, but he can’t wake up right now.” Steve said keeping a firm hold of Zach so he couldn’t get down and jump on the bed. He only wanted to cuddle Tony of course but it was too risky, he could accidently hurt Tony, pull out tubes and wires, even jolt his spine.
“Practise?” Ned typed.
“What if its flu, what if its meningitis?”
Steve was still riding high on the success of the date, when he walked into the kitchen, breathing in the familiar scent of blueberry pancakes and syrup that Zach had talked Tony into cooking for him.
“I shudder to think!” Pepper replied.
The little Pup stared at her in terror, his face red and puffy from crying, eyes wide as he saw his brother and Rogers pass out.
“Not allowed to outside of the lab.” Zach said with a put upon sigh, “Boring!”
“Knitting needles under your nails, sand paper over your skin, lungs feeling like they are going to explode, a fire at the back of your throat burning you from the inside out.”
Getting together with Steve almost a year ago had been an unexpected delight. They had been dancing around each other since the fall of Shield, but it had taken an attempted kidnapping by a parole released Justin (The dickhead) Hammer, an exchange of bullets, Steve getting a graze across the thigh, and Tony just about having a melt down in public as he screamed at Steve to never take risks with his life for him, that he wasn’t worth it, and Steve should never put himself in danger.
Tony nodded thoughtfully as the lift reached the ground floor and they walked out to the limo waiting for them, for the first time in God knows how long he was actually feeling hopeful about the future, was even looking forward to a Gala! Mostly because he was seeing Steve in a tux!
Folding her arms over her chest Wanda settled down and closed her eyes, she and Pietro would be leaving Sokovia tomorrow, they would be crossing the border into Slovakia, she didn’t know what Pietro had in mind for them once they were in Slovakia but she knew what she intended. They needed to get to America, that was where Stark and the Avengers would go, so they needed to get there too.
“No they won’t,” Steve said, rubbing Tony’s back, and moving his fingers up to massage the back of his neck, “Everything will be fine, you’ll see. Its Rogers they’ll crucify, not you.”
“Bucky stop!” Steve pleaded running forward to put his hands against his chest, Bucky ignored him beating him down and wrapped the metal hand about his neck. “Hail Hydra!” He said as he took hold of Steve head ready to snap his neck….
