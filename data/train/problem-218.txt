He doesn’t know how he’s gone from a casual lie-in to desperate and wound-up and needy so quickly, but this happens with John on a regular basis; John is everything, John is his heart, his sun, his drug, his life, and he finds it hard to handle the idea that John is actually his, that he can feel these things, that John wants him, and sometimes the feeling creeps up on him and then hits him all at once, leaving him stunned, desperate, in disbelief.
“You’re worried about a woman, too, one you seem to think is wonderful,” she continues. “But stop trying to figure out your future. Just let what’s meant to happen happen. And then, of course, you have a new friend. A man. One you fight with quite a bit, don’t you? But your relationship will only grow from this point on.”
“I want to help,” John says.
, Sherlock. You really are.”
, Sherlock, you don’t get to – you don’t get to do that, you
John laughs. “Yeah, ‘course you did,” he says. His eyes are crinkled in the corners, and he’s smiling at Sherlock. He looks
“Sherlock,” John says. His voice is low and intent and he breathes low and harsh for a moment, his eyes somewhere else before they settle back on Sherlock. “Sometimes, I think – I look at you, and I think you might – but I don’t –
“That which is sought, they who are sought, the place we are seeking…That which searches, those who search, the place we must search…Guide us, that which flies, to the one we seek,” Sherlock murmurs, chanting what John knows must be some kind of spell. Sherlock’s eyes are focused on the handkerchief, and there’s an air of power around him similar to when he’d helped John after his spirit attack. John can’t help but stare at his face as he chants, but he looks away when Sherlock finishes and stands gracefully, his free hand still drawing patterns in the air above the handkerchief.
John rubs his forehead wearily. “When will you be back?”
“You’ll see,” Sherlock repeats, a smile twisting his lips again. “Come on, let’s go.”
“It’s only thanks to you,” John murmurs, overcome. His eyes flicker over Sherlock’s face, taking in his half-lidded eyes, the planes of his angular cheeks, his lips, flushed and parted. He swallows, his throat dry, their faces closer together than they’ve ever been. They’ve come so far, he thinks, and yet they haven’t done
Sherlock rolls his eyes.  “Ugh, you’re so bloody British, why does that fat git get a cup?”
Sherlock nods because he’s not sure he can speak.
John wants to protest. He wants to say that this isn’t how flatmates should act, that this isn’t how employees and employers should act, that this isn’t even how
“There’s nothing you can do to help me,” Sherlock tells him. His voice is gentle. “Maybe we’ll be able to meet like this again sometime, but I have to pay for my wish. It’s easiest for all of us if you just let me disappear.” His voice is soft and his eyes are trained on John’s. There’s something in them, a bleakness, that John doesn’t like.
John stands in front of him and casts another warming spell on him, and Sherlock feels his shoulders relax as it trickles over him, warm like sunlight, gentle like a breeze. He feels something soft on his face, and he opens his eyes, sees John gently dabbing the sweat off his brow with his handkerchief. He watches, keeps his tired eyes on John, who’s standing in front of him without a cane, and can’t help but think how long it’s been since anyone’s taken care of him, how cold and miserable he still feels, how the darkness of that curse felt. The darkness is still lingering in the corners of his mind, cloying and nauseating. He feels uncharacteristic pressure in his sinuses, and John starts to get blurry. He closes his eyes, feels his brow twitch upwards involuntarily, feels his lips twist.
“I waited for you for so long,” Sherlock tells him again. His voice is hushed and intimate and it cracks on the end of his words.
all the time. You’re – I know I say it all the time, but you really are brilliant,” John tells him. “I’m not usually – I’m rubbish at this, at talking, but you really – after today, after what you did for me today, I can’t just – I can’t just
– spills a drop of the nectar, but manages to save it, and he can’t help but laugh along with Sherlock, letting the question go for the time being.
John pulls out his wand and is about to cast a spell, but Sherlock reaches out and grabs his wand out of his hand.
“Alright?” John asks. His voice is soft, like the gentle
The door closes behind them and John and Sherlock are left in silence. It’s strangely anticlimactic, John thinks, to suddenly be back on their couch, surrounded by the familiar detritus of their everyday lives, back to the same banter as usual, the same familiar sounds of the London traffic.
Greg smiles and looks out over the lights of London. “You couldn’t be further from the truth, John,” he says, and then turns to smile at him. “Anyway, I think I’ll be able to help you at some point,” he adds. “I’m not sure how, exactly. I just know it will happen.”
“It’s generally not a good idea to stand in doorways,” Sherlock says to John, brushing off the front of his coat.
John wants to punch him. He wants to punch him and kick him and beat the bloody daylights out of him. But more than that, he wants to grab him, hold him as close as he can, hug him so tight neither of them can breathe, bury his face in Sherlock’s neck, wind his fingers through his hair. The feeling is visceral, burning through his veins. He stares at Sherlock, trapped in this madman’s web, and he takes a step closer, wondering if he can somehow cut the strings.
. The park. He sets off at a run, eager to catch up to John. His heart is still pounding, a mix of physical activity and nerves, but he ignores it along with the people staring at him as he runs by, pushing forward, eager to get to John.
“And you know what you’re looking for,” John guesses as he flips on the kettle.
“Everyone knows your name,” Greg says with a shrug. “Everyone who knows Sherlock, anyway.”
“It’s fine,” John interrupts.
John shifts and moves closer but doesn’t break the kiss, which grows more distracted, John’s lips losing their focus and growing more sloppy in a way that makes Sherlock’s skin come alive, and then John moves until he’s straddling him, and Sherlock feels like he might die when John’s weight is settled on his thighs, when John’s mouth comes at his from a new angle, when John’s chest is pressed against his. He opens his mouth eagerly to John’s, moans louder than he means to when John rocks his hips, clutches at Johns back and feels like he is coming apart.
“No, of course not,” John says quickly, shaking his head. “Of course not. It sounds…well, to be honest, it sounds a bit lonely, and I can relate to that.”
“You did nothing wrong,” John says tenderly. “Nothing.” He strokes his thumb along Sherlock’s cheekbone again and Sherlock closes his eyes, overwhelmed, and leans into the touch, lets himself believe that this is happening, that John’s words are true.
“I’ve barely touched it,” Mycroft says, but he doesn’t tighten it any further, just tugs on Sherlock’s jacket once more while Sherlock fidgets.
it when John’s concerned, and he knows John will be more concerned if he looks away – but he hates it, hates every second that John sees him like this, hates the way fear is crawling over his skin, hates the way he feels naked and exposed.
“Yeah,” Sherlock says. “I’m tired.”
“Get the mice, soldiers!” the nutcracker shouts. “I’ll get the king!”
“Sherlock,” John says. “Drink this.”
“Don’t worry,” John says. “I can come back tomorrow!”
She laughs again, and John smiles when they see Sherlock up ahead.  He’s wearing a suit once more, and his duffle bag over is slung over his shoulder.
Sherlock smiles, but it’s different than his smile from before; softer somehow, absent in the crinkles of his eyes. “Wouldn’t that be interesting,” he murmurs, and Redbeard squeaks in agreement.
John looks like he’d been about to say something, but he stops and his expression changes to a mixture of concern and amusement. “Alright?” he asks. He sounds fond, and Sherlock swallows; he’s used to that tone. Usually, it means John thinks he’s gotten lost in his mind palace or that John finds the unusual detritus of his experiments funny, and that’s a tone he can work with. He straightens his back, forces his hands to relax.
he’ll be needing it, while simultaneously causing Sherlock to feel something in his stomach he hadn’t quite understood.) Sherlock listens to the unfamiliar sounds of uneven footsteps above him, and doesn’t know what to do with himself. He busies himself with looking over some potions notes he’d taken earlier in the week, but it’s hard to focus, distracted as he is by the sounds and the signature of unfamiliar magic drifting about upstairs. Interestingly, John’s magical signature isn’t harsh or strange to him, but he needs to observe it up close to examine it more thoroughly. It’s tainted, anyway, by the curse on his leg, which Sherlock would really like to investigate.
“Well?” John asks.  Their faces are close, and he finds that he can’t look away from Sherlock’s eyes.
that exists only to contrast a
“John Watson,” John says. “Surely you can read?” he adds, gesturing towards the dog tags.
He reaches out, his hand trembling, and lays it on the side of Sherlock’s face. Sherlock closes his eyes, his wrists and feet still bound, and turns his head towards John’s hand. He exhales, and it’s warm against John’s palm. A tear leaks from Sherlock’s eye and it drips into the crevices between John’s fingers and John wants to trap it there, keep it forever.
John nods, takes a sip of his tea.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, John. I’m Arthur, but you can call me Art; that’s what all my friends used to call me,” Arthur says.
, John, is our invitation,” Sherlock says, setting his pipe down on the side table. Surprisingly, he reaches out and takes a plate for himself, dishing some fried rice onto it.
John just stares at him.  Something is twisting inside his chest, something painful and desperate.  “I care about you, you cock!  I had nothing at all in this entire world before I met you, don’t you know that?  I didn’t care if I lived or died, but you changed that, you idiot.  Where would I be without you?  Christ, you can’t just do things like that!”
“John,” he gasps. “It’s all for you. Everything. I jumped for you, I came back for you, I killed for you, and I’d do it again, I would, John, please-”
“Stay sitting up,” Sherlock says, voice firm and yet concerned. Mrs. Hudson takes Billy from the mantle and sits in the armchair, close by and ready to help.
“Because no one deserves this!” John says. “It’s terrible! I don’t wish this on
over John.
“You don’t have a fever,” John says.
John shakes his head. His eyes are wet, and Sherlock doesn’t know why. He fears he’s made a big mistake, and his skin begins to crawl, but John’s thumb smooths over his lip once more.
“That’s fine,” John says. “I’d rather not go into Diagon Alley, to be honest.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says, then blinks a few times in confusion and looks up. “No, that is I –” He stops and clears his throat. “No, I haven’t eaten. Yes, I could do takeaway.”
“No, I’m not a complete idiot,” John says, taking another sip and giving Sherlock an annoyed look. “I asked for proof. He mentioned Billy.”
He smiles, soft and warm and affectionate. “Inevitable.”
John snorts and looks down. “Sent a pan flying at my dad’s head,” he says.
“I don’t know if he’s ready,” she tells Billy.
Surprisingly, he’s not asking in a way that feels malicious to Sherlock, though he’s been known to misread people’s intentions. “Of course I don’t have tracking charms in your room,” Sherlock says. “I don’t have the time to worry myself over what kind of magic you’re using.”
“We’ll be going, then,” Sherlock says. John looks up at the sound of his voice, pushing thoughts of the tube to the background for the time being. “Hopefully we won’t see you again anytime soon, Mycroft.”
John rolls his eyes. “Right, but you’re a skull,” he says.
“How?”
John eyes him skeptically. “I haven’t even had a sip yet,” he says.
Sherlock strides towards the mantle and John follows his progression across the sitting room with tired eyes. Questions are popping into his mind, as is usually the case when Sherlock is present, but he’s not sure he’s ready to hear any answers at this hour, and so he manages a bewildered furrow of his brow in Sherlock’s general direction and a small grunt of curiosity before he turns back to his coffee, pouring the rest of his cup and setting the pot back in its place. His mug is warm against his hands when he picks it up, and he leans against the counter as he closes his eyes and blows across the top, savoring the familiar smell, while Sherlock has a short conversation with Billy in the living room. John tunes them out and takes a much-needed sip of his coffee, feeling his shoulders settle and his mind sharpen even after one small taste. “Morning,” he calls out once he’s been fortified.
“How old were you?” Sherlock asks, and John’s relieved to tell this story to someone and have them believe it and not question his sanity.
When he opens the door, though, Sherlock is sitting on the couch, his knees tucked up to his chin. His head rests sideways on top and his eyes are closed. He’s facing the window; perhaps he’d been looking outside. John thinks he must have fallen asleep. He can’t help but notice how skinny Sherlock is, how small he manages to look in this position. His face is smoothed in relaxation, and in their absence, John realizes how many new lines are there when he’s awake.
John is silent for a moment, thinking. “I don’t understand,” he admits.
“That’s difficult to answer,” Sherlock says. “I guess you could say it’s a different world; the world of the spirits.”
Sherlock feels like he can’t speak, watching John splash his fingers in the pond while the birds and butterflies he’s made circle around him. His heart is pounding, and he doesn't understand how he feels.
“Oh, sorry mate, the light’s gonna change, gotta run,” the other man says suddenly, waving at Anderson and jogging off in the opposite direction.
When they get inside, needlessly hushing one another on the stairs to avoid bothering Mrs. Hudson, giggling as John fumbles with his key and Sherlock just opens the door with a wave of his hand and accidentally makes it bang against the wall, John goes right to the kitchen and gets two beers out of the fridge. Sherlock sits in his chair, and John hobbles over to sit across from him.
Suddenly, Sherlock stops, cocking his head to the side and listening intently. Mrs. Hudson and Billy suddenly become quite attentive and watch him carefully, and John looks between the three of them, unsure.
Sherlock shakes his head and squeezes his eyes closed. He feels overwhelmed, like someone is grabbing hold of his heart and twisting. He wants to stare at John, to take him in, to memorize this moment down to the very last hair on John’s head, but he finds that he can’t, that his throat is tightening, that his lip is twisting. John pulls him forward and holds him again, the same way as before, and he finds it easier to breathe, somehow, with his face pressed against John’s neck.
“Don’t be dull,” Sherlock says, rolling his eyes. “Obviously that’s you.”
“It’s not exactly a bachelor pad,” John says. “My flatmate is a little – he’s a bit odd. But I don’t feel so lonely anymore, not with him around.”
Mycroft sighs, and then crouches down in front of Sherlock, tugging on his arms until Sherlock puts them at his side. “And that’s reason enough to ruin your jacket?”
. He’s imagined this countless times, but never has he accounted for the reality of the warm weight of John against him, the incandescent bliss that washes over him, the way his body feels like it’s on fire.
Sherlock nods, heart clenching. “I – it’s hard for me to believe it’s really happening,” he admits, making him feel vulnerable, exposed, raw, but somehow, he thinks that’s okay.
Sherlock shrugs. “It’s very… it can be… overwhelming,” he says. “Magical signatures are very strong to me. Magic moves through the air in currents, and I’m constantly aware of them. Mummy used to put Sleakeazy on my head when I was younger, and it gave me a headache every time, having all that magic rubbed all over me. When she cast cleaning spells, it felt like there were ants all over my skin. Someone would simply
“Then listen to him,” Sherlock says. “And listen to me. Stop seeing him.”
Sherlock’s heart is still pounding and he doesn’t know what to do. He’s never had emotions like this before, nor has he had a friend like this before, and if he’s honest with himself, he’s never even let himself give in to the mere
“Hey, baby!...Yeah, I just got done at work, a lot to do now that I’m head of the department!...thanks, you know, I’d love to celebrate with you…want to have dinner? I’ve got nothing on ‘til 8, we’re having a little party at work to celebrate the promotion. Want to have some dinner beforehand? …Sounds perfect, love….I know, right? Twenty-five and head of forensics at New Scotland Yard and you for a girlfriend…doesn’t get any better!....Right, right, okay, see you in twenty.”
John starts at the use of his name and then looks away for a moment, surprised by his sudden urge to laugh at this strange turn of events.  He knows he should probably be alarmed, but his life has become so strange that this seems almost normal, and so he looks back at the man in resigned amusement.  “Yes, that’s me.  Sorry, but do I know you?”
John leans down, kisses him again. “Yes. Always,” John murmurs, right next to his lips. Sherlock shivers, and John kisses him again, closing the scant distance between them easily, pressing their lips together gently, sweetly, perfectly. They stay that way for a moment, John standing on his own two legs, Sherlock leaning up to meet him in a kiss, surrounded by the soft lights and flowers.
“Interesting,” Mycroft says, and John doesn't like his tone.  “But it doesn’t work that way, unfortunately.  Your debt is yours alone, and Sherlock’s is his alone.  But as it so happens, he has a rather valuable mirror I’ve had my eye on for some time, and he will give it to me today.  We’ve already arranged the payment.”
“No, it’s not fine,” John insists.  “I called you a lazy git when you did so much-”
Sherlock doesn’t look away from Redbeard. “We did, didn’t we?” he says pensively. Redbeard squeaks at him in response and John smiles, watching over the rim of his mug.
“You’re so responsive,” John murmurs.
“You knew who she was,” John finally says, once he’s settled himself.
And now, Sherlock is standing on the tarmac with John. It’s silent, a stark contrast to the chaos of Appledore, and yet his entire being is on the same level of chaos it had been then. His mind palace is in ruins, swarmed by endless inner battles. The rooms and corridors and wings filled with John are threatening to crumble. He keeps his exterior calm and disconnects from the core of emotion inside of him. It’s what he has to do; he must protect John.
“Okay, I’ll go to the store. But I’m not taking the skull,” he says.
John hesitates only a moment before he’s standing up, cane in hand. “Obviously,” he says, and they share a smile, and then they’re off.
“Moriarty’s web,” Sherlock murmurs. His heart is pounding again, but this –
“How touching,” Moriarty interrupts, his voice dripping with boredom.
John pauses, his fork hovering in midair.  “We – I’m his flatmate, and I guess his employee,” he says.  He’s not quite sure how to describe their relationship.
“Right, then, you can imagine how they were as kids,” Greg says, but John finds that he can’t. “Sherlock annoyed Mycroft every chance he got – you know, chasing him round the forest, playing tricks on him, things like that. Mycroft used to get so mad he’d drench Sherlock with rain a few times a day.” Greg stops for a moment and chuckles. “Sherlock had it coming, the little prat. He always found ways to avoid Mycroft’s rain, though; he’s always been good with magic.”
Sherlock sits up, and hastily tugs his sheet back into place when it slides down his shoulder. “You still want me to fix your leg?”
“I’m going home,” John says. “My flatmate’s just come to get me.”
His heart speeds up at the thought, and his fingers stumble over the Brahms for a moment.  He stops, abruptly switching to Debussy. Impressionism fits well with his mood, he thinks.
“It’s alright,” John says. “I’m alright. You didn’t have to come. You can go if you’d like.”
“Worth a life and death situation, don’t you think?” Sherlock asks, pulling a lighter out of his pocket and lighting his pipe.
Sherlock opens his bag and John isn’t surprised to see him take out Billy, setting him beside him on the ledge of the large fountain.
Mary blinks, looking down at her tea for a moment. She hesitates, and then looks back up, searching Sherlock’s eyes. “There’s really nothing you can-”
Dad picks him up and stands tall, then says something to Mummy. Sherlock clings to the folds of his robes, groans against the onslaught of magic all around him, doesn’t hear anything Dad’s saying.
He imagines Sherlock’s mouth just centimeters from his own, poised to meet his, and it feels so
“A hydrangea,” John repeats, turning back to the teapot and pouring off the excess before grabbing a dishtowel and drying off the pot, then putting it on the heat.
He stops and scrubs a hand over his face, squeezing his eyes closed and taking a deep breath. Redbeard presses against his side, and John focuses on his breathing again, in and out in and out, and tries desperately to focus his thoughts.
Sherlock shrugs, one corner of his mouth quirking upwards. “You never used to have so much grey hair,” he says without thinking.
“Was there…anyone else?”
“We haven’t,” Sherlock says. He thinks of sitting alone with only the John that lives in his mind palace for company, of watching John get married, of dying for John, of killing for John, of surviving for John. He shakes his head, lets bravery take hold of him, puts his hand on John’s waist. “We haven’t wasted time, John. If we hadn’t – if we hadn’t gone through what we have, this wouldn't be – this wouldn’t be
Mrs. Hudson shakes her head.  “There’s everything there.  You just need to be attuned to it,” she says.  “Sherlock made it, you know.  He made that passageway, just like he made this place and everything inside it.”
Mycroft rolls his eyes as they reach the foyer, and they walk inside the ballroom together. Though he’s already spied the decorations from the side door, Sherlock can’t help but look around, his mouth parted in awe at the splendor.
But they’re working a case now, and it feels good to be with Sherlock this way, just like the old days. Lestrade has called them in for the first time in ages, and Sherlock had beamed at John in the flat as he told him to get his coat and hurry.
“Don’t be thick,” John says. His heart flutters in his chest and he’s sure once the shock of this all wears off he’ll have questions and fears and worries, but he has no doubt that this is the best thing that could have happened to him. He’s overwhelmingly happy to have Sherlock here, to touch him like this, to be close to him. John feels nervous; they haven’t talked about this, there are so many things he doesn’t understand – but being with Sherlock is astonishingly simple and
“I’ll deal with it tomorrow,” John says. “Ta,” he adds, then grabs Sherlock by the arm and pulls him bodily from the room. John Apparates both of them home, and Sherlock immediately closes his eyes against the squeezing, constricting pressure of the magic and hopes he doesn’t throw up, hunching over in pain.
All too soon, though, the restaurant is empty, and it’s only them left behind. “Come over?” Sherlock asks, his heart beating fast. “My flat is only a few minutes away.”
“You have plants?” John asks.
, this could be
John frowns for a moment and thinks. Sherlock’s a bloody madman and living with him full time could be the single most infuriating experience of his life. On the other hand, though, the ghosts don’t bother him when he’s with Sherlock, and there’s something about being around Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson and even bloody Billy that is comforting; after all, he has no one else in the world. He sighs. “Yeah, alright. I’m interested.”
“Come on, now,” she tells him. “Let’s go to the party.”
He’d been too absorbed in the music to truly take it in, but when he revisits it in his mind, his eyes suddenly fly open and he pushes the thought away because it looks too much for him to bear like the things he locks away deep inside, and he stands up, pacing back and forth for a moment.
“Honestly, John, it wasn’t
“I had a really lovely time,” Mary says suddenly.  “But I should get going; it’s already gone two.  John, I’ll see you at work on Monday, alright?”
His heart suddenly skips a beat and his eyes widen for a moment because he
“You were very kind to Mary,” Sherlock tells him. “Too kind, in my opinion.”
Sherlock waits for John for days, but he doesn’t return. Mummy calls Uncle Augustus, who says he hasn’t seen the nutcracker, and also says he can’t remember whether or not he’d had a bit of blue in one of his pockets when Sherlock begs Mummy to ask him. Days turn into weeks turn into months, but still, there is no sign of John. Mummy and Daddy keep talking about getting Sherlock
John’s eyes widen for a moment when Moriarty’s finger points straight at John’s chest and he feels a surge of energy from the spirits. They’re coming towards him, and he wonders if this is it, if they’re going to attack him. Redbeard growls, and John squeezes his eyes closed. He’s shivering, freezing cold and nauseous, and he panics when he feels pressure on his shoulders, trying to force him down to the ground. He knows the spirits are confused; they’re used to obeying Moriarty, used to responding to the strongest presence in the room. He remembers what Sherlock told him, though, that the spirits preyed on him because he was weak and couldn’t control the power he so clearly had. He needs to prove to them once and for all he’s strong.
“Don’t be crass; of course I’m not a spirit,” Mycroft calls back.  He sounds bored, but when John glances back at him, he looks like a snake ready to strike.
Sherlock unclenches his hands as best he can. He’s still staring at John wide-eyed, still trying to comprehend the way it felt to have a
Though it’s nearly three in the morning, John climbs up to the roof of 221B in nothing but his pajamas. The nights have been getting progressively colder and he shivers, nothing but the thin cotton of his shirt to act as a flimsy barrier between him and the chilly air. Even so, something tells him to keep going rather than go back inside to get a jacket. There’s something deep inside of him leading him, telling him that the roof is where he needs to be, and though it’s a strange feeling, he doesn’t fight it.
Sherlock suddenly twists around and sits up, and John stops talking, leaning back a bit at the shock of Sherlock’s sudden movement.
“Alright,” Mummy says. “Alright. Come downstairs and eat something, love.”
Sherlock smiles, eyes crinkling. “I need more data before I can answer that sufficiently,” she says, and then they’re giggling, and Sherlock’s spine curves into a gentle arc and she rests her forehead against John’s for just a moment, cherishing the soft curves of John’s waist beneath her hands, inhaling the scent of her shampoo, nuzzling their noses together, letting her hands smooth up and down John’s lower back, feeling her breath hitch when John’s hand slides under her shirt. John’s hand, warm and strong, strokes up and down Sherlock’s side, higher and higher each time, until her fingers brush the side of Sherlock’s breast, and gently, John kisses her neck, warm and soft, and then her thumb brushes over Sherlock’s nipple, rubbing it to hardness, and Sherlock moans, pulling John closer.
John turns, and in the time it takes him to take one step, something is happening in Sherlock that he can’t control. All the words he’s wanted to say, all the things he’s felt – the terror, the pain, the worry, the warm but painful things he can’t put a name to – they’re bubbling inside of him, twisting, working their way to the surface, fighting with his intellect, vying for purchase in his mind. The doors in his mind palace are blowing open, Redbeard is running in the surrounding yard, and there’s a warm wind howling through the hallways and rooms he’s never felt before.
John looks at him in annoyance. “It might not be the best idea, walking home alone, but it doesn’t mean she should be
John looks up at him. “Why not?” he asks. The question is soft, genuine, open.
“You’re home early,” Sherlock suddenly murmurs, not moving from where he sits, keeping his eyes closed.
John’s in a tunnel. It’s dark and damp, and he can barely see his hand in front of his face. He frowns; he recognizes, dimly, that this must be a dream, a dream like the ones in which he meets Greg on the roof, but he doesn’t recognize this place.
He can’t believe this is real, and yet it
Sherlock looks down, flustered. “I don’t… you must have been so shocked that you didn’t hear me,” he says.
“John!” she says, surprised to see him. “Oh, and your fox – he’s magnificent, isn’t he?”
And then Sherlock’s face screws up and it’s all rushing at him – torture, isolation, fear, worry, death, murder, Mary – and something opens inside of him, something terrifying. He feels like he’s been shot all over again.
John sighs and rubs his forehead, grimacing. “Okay,” he says. “Okay.” He pauses and takes a deep breath, absently rubbing his fingertip over Redbeard’s head. The urge to shout and complain again that no one tells him anything builds deep in his stomach, but his desire to find Sherlock is greater, and so he takes another deep, stuttering breath to calm himself down.
“Oh, John!” she says. “The kitchen looks lovely! I’ve brought you another cuppa, why don’t you sit down and have a drink before you start cooking?”
John freezes. His heart skips a beat in his chest and his mind begins to race. Of course he’s wished that his entire life, every moment since he was a child, every time someone told him he was crazy, or he had to run and run and
“I love you,” John says after a moment, pulling away from the kiss. “Of course I love you.”
John doesn’t watch, knowing that Sherlock is handing over the mirror.  Mycroft takes it with a murmur of thanks, and John is glad not to watch the exchange.
“Right,” John says, remembering his trip to the fortuneteller.  “Molly.”  He pauses, and then looks at Billy helplessly.  “I don’t have her phone number.”
John blinks. He doesn’t really understand, but he doesn’t expect to. “Why can’t he kill me?” he asks, his heart aching to find Sherlock even as he tries to figure out what Mycroft is explaining to him.
John touches his face, turns it towards him. Sherlock jolts at the touch, but John doesn’t remove his fingers, and Sherlock finds that his heart is racing. He can’t control himself, can’t control his expression, and he knows how vulnerable he looks, he
But when he turns back to Sherlock and catches his eye, Sherlock’s hair is mussed from John’s fingers, and his lips are red and shiny. He looks so gorgeous that John can’t help but smile even though he feels off-kilter and surprised. He steps back into Sherlock’s space, and Sherlock doesn’t hesitate. He settles his hands on John’s waist and drops his head down to press his forehead against John’s, closing his eyes, taking deep breaths. The fingers of his left hand are trailing up and down John’s spine, tracing it slowly, while the thumb of his right hand is rubbing circles into John’s skin.
“Go on, then,” Sherlock says, still staring, and John gives a long-suffering sigh before blowing over the surface of his coffee and taking a sip, trying not to feel uncomfortable under Sherlock’s gaze.
The next morning, John makes his way into the kitchen later than usual, a small headache blooming at his temples. He’s not surprised to see Sherlock lying dramatically on the couch, swimming in the luxurious fabric of his dressing gown, one arm thrown over his face.
Sherlock looks at him inscrutably and nods, slowly. “Yes,” he says. “In fact, she’s here, just outside the door. Would you like to speak to her?”
“I hope you make good use of it,” John says with a smile.  He chats with Angelo for a little while, the boy shyly making his way over and sitting on the stool beside John.  John spares him a smile, but the boy blushes and turns away, ducking his head to hide a smile of his own.  John finds him quite endearing, and he shares an amused grin with Angelo.
Sherlock lazily turns his head towards John. “The spirit that overtook the girl?” he asks. “No.”
, warm and Christmassy and special. As he makes his way down the stairs, though, the decorations cast new and unusual shadows around him, and he finds himself staying closer to the bannister than usual. His eyes widen as he creeps along, unused to seeing so many dark and eerie shapes in the usually empty hallways. He goes to the ballroom and opens the door with a creak, and though the tree is still lit and it provides enough warm light for him to make his way over and find his nutcracker, the far corners of the room seem bleaker than usual, blanketed in darkness and strange shapes, and he hurries to the tree, where he can be by the side of his new friend.
“I’ll give you this,” Sherlock finally says, reaching into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and pulling out a plain, unadorned silver ring. “Wear it on your pinky.”
She nods and stands. “Sometimes, there’s a lot you can do with your thoughts,” she tells him. She goes to her small kitchen, leaving John alone. John stares at the fire and tries to let go of the hopelessness of the situation and instead focus on her suggestion. He knows he’s dealing with a world he knows next to nothing about, and it’s part of what’s making him feel so hopeless in the first place; Sherlock’s with an enemy John doesn’t know how to fight, in a place John doesn’t know how to find, bound by rules John doesn’t know. He can’t just charge in and fight, but of course, neither can he run away, and he’s not sure what remains in between those two options for him to do.
“You’re alright,” John says. “You’re alright, love, that was intense, wasn’t it? But you’re alright, you’re incredible, shh,” and Sherlock rests against him, unsure of what just happened, unsure of what came over him, unsure if he can even speak.
Sherlock spends all of dinner in a state of delirious happiness. He’s sure he must be dreaming, and yet, John’s knee is warm against his own, John’s eating the same food he’s eating, John is present and real and not at all a figment of his imagination. Dinner has been like a dream; they are talking and laughing and it’s as if no time has passed at all, as if they are still nine years old and sitting in front of a fireplace in a grand castle, and yet it’s
“No,” John says. “Now will you just
He looks down and meets her eyes, and hers widen for just a moment in something like trust before she holds tighter to his hand, reaching up and clutching it with both of her own hands, burying her face in his arm.  He holds her close and closes his eyes, taking a deep, shaky breath, and thinks of home as his ribbon twists around the one hanging from above.
John doesn’t know what to do. He’s never seen Sherlock like this, and he has no idea what the fuck he’s apologizing for. He hears a door slam from somewhere outside the alley, and he knows the cavalry has arrived. He doesn’t want Sherlock to cry. He doesn’t know what’s happening. In desperation, he pulls Sherlock close and hugs him, hand on the back of Sherlock’s head, pressing it down into John’s neck, holding him there for what seems like ages but in reality is hardly ten seconds. Sherlock’s gasping against his neck, and John closes his eyes, his mind whirring in overdrive, before letting go, holding Sherlock at arm’s length again.
“Treasure,” Sherlock says. “Do be careful; some of it’s dangerous. Mrs. Hudson, can you bring him down?”
“Yes,” Sherlock says.  “She’s a spirit of good fortune.”
She takes her hands away from her mouth and hesitates for a moment, looking away and biting her lip as her fingers twist into her long skirt. After a moment she stands and walks over to him, her shoulders drawn up with worry. “It’s very dangerous,” she tells him as she sits beside him. “I hope you understand when I tell you that I can’t help you. You’ll die.”
“What do you mean, you could feel it everywhere?”
He freezes, listening very attentively when he hears a second voice with Mike, one he’s never heard before. He can sense the unfamiliar magic as well, and his heart picks up just a bit, unsure why Mike would be bringing a stranger with him. Surely Mike wasn’t like everyone else; surely Mike wasn’t expecting to treat someone to a freak show, and yet, he’s brought someone with him, and Sherlock can't think of any other reason why.
“Sh’lock,” John croaks. “Thought I – you –”
“John,” he says, his voice pitiful and gravelly.
, he thinks fiercely, remembering Sherlock’s words and feeling his spine straighten. There’s
been fun watching the two of you dance. Did you like how I gave you a few little glimpses of him in the tunnels, just to make it all that much more heartbreaking when you realized the truth of it all? It’s so
“Don’t,” John says.
“Sounds like he had it coming,” Greg says.
“Maybe I am stupid,” John agrees weakly. “But it’s still not your fault, Mary.”
Sherlock pauses for a moment with his hand on the doorknob, one step into his closet, and he turns back to John. He hesitates, his breath catching, and then his eyes meet John’s for a moment and he’s very serious. “Be careful,” he says. “Don’t do anything stupid.”
John swallows, unsure. “Sherlock,” he says. “Would you bloody look at me?”
Sherlock turns and looks at him curiously, his head tilted and his brow furrowed. “Oh,” he says, after a moment, clearly having understood the source of John’s mood. “Would you like tea?”
“Doesn’t that sound riveting,” Mycroft says drily. “Sherlock, look at Uncle Augustus.
“Christ,” John says, but he’s smiling. “You’re ridiculous.”
“Negative energy?” John asks, ignoring the warmth of Sherlock’s hand to focus on the conversation.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and laughs, though it’s a bit weary and watery.
to quit.”
Sherlock stares at him a moment longer, and then he finally drops his hands and rests them on the table, lacing his fingers together. He smiles at John, a sincere smile that takes John by surprise. “It wasn’t a dream, John, not exactly. Lestrade really did visit you on the roof, but you didn’t go there. In that sense, you can call it a dream since you never left your bed, but it’s not a dream in the traditional sense since you were actually there with Lestrade.”
Sherlock is sprawled on the couch again, still smoking his pipe, gazing up at the ceiling.
Sherlock looks at him shrewdly and then reaches out, covering John’s forearm with his hand. He rests it there, and it’s heavy and warm, comforting like a blanket. “Of course not,” Sherlock says. “It was your choice, after all. You made the choice to see him even though it put your health at risk. I told you before that people can wish for anything, John; happiness or unhappiness, for example. We all have wishes. You chose what you wished for at the time. So did I.”
“Of course you do,” the woman says. Her voice is soothing. “You’ll find him, I know you will. But you need to rest for a little while. You’re of no use to him like this.”
John’s staring at the lantern, trying to process all that’s just happened, when Sherlock comes back. Sherlock’s wrapped in his dressing gown again, holding his pipe in one hand. Redbeard is draped across the other, squeaking a bit more than usual and craning his neck towards John. Sherlock holds his hand out and John absently mirrors the move, watching as Redbeard bridges the distance between them and contentedly curls around John’s wrist.
“Ah,” Sherlock says suddenly. “I believe there is one more guest who should attend our party. John, why don’t you go and get him? He’s down in the warehouse.”
Sherlock seems surprised at the conversation change, but his smile widens, and he seems relieved. “Exactly,” he says.
John’s eyebrows rise a little bit. “But I am?”
For some reason, hearing someone else speak those words, hearing someone like
“Sherlock,” Dad says. His voice is warm, but Sherlock’s head hurts and it only makes him feel worse.
“Yes,” John said.
As usual, I'd love to hear your thoughts about this part!  What did you think?  I'd love to know! :)  and if you'd like, you can find me on tumblr as slashscribe.  thanks again for reading!  talk to you soon! :)
John and Sherlock spend the whole night talking and eating sweets by the fire, giggling and learning about each other and having fun, but as the night wears on, they begin to yawn more and more until John suggests maybe it’s time to sleep.
And then it happens: a soft, sweet press of lips, just for a moment. John’s lips are soft and dry, and they fit perfectly against his own. It’s over before it’s even begun; just as Sherlock registers the feeling of lips against his own, John is sliding back down, and Sherlock stares at him, stunned, his mind spinning and desperately trying to process this but he realizes he doesn’t have time for that, realizes that this is happening
– is easier to talk about than his feelings. “It was – eleven. There were others, but I didn’t have to kill all of them,” he says. “When they captured me, MI6 took-”
. Hurry up.”
“Don’t use it if you don’t want to,” Sherlock says. “But it’s a good idea. Just think very carefully about what you use that finger for.”
He’s terrified, he realizes, and he has no idea how he will get Sherlock back. But deep in his soul, he can feel a strength and determination that he’s never felt before. He knows he’s about to enter a world he knows little to nothing about, but somehow, he trusts that he’s as ready as he can possibly be, and he finds that the benefits of what he’s about to undertake far outweigh the risks.
“I’ve never… no one’s ever come in here before,” Sherlock says, voice rough, though he knows John knows that.
, I – I’m not – I –” He stops, shakes his head, closes his eyes for a moment, reopens them. John is still there. “Please,” he adds, though he’s not sure what he’s asking for. There is something that feels like a rock in his stomach, churning unpleasantly. He forces himself to keep speaking. “I – I missed you. Very much. Please.”
Sherlock shakes his head. John’s not supposed to say that, he’s
Sherlock swallows hard.  John’s lips are swollen and shiny with spit, and Sherlock feels a jolt deep in his stomach at the sight.  “John,” he says.  He feels like he’s begging, and he doesn’t understand what for.
?” John asks. “I’ve bought groceries, cleaned your kitchen, and cooked you dinner, and you’ve got nothing but complaints?”
“Do you want to do it?” John asks, holding the tube out.
“If you want me to go, I will,” Sherlock volunteers, eyeing John shrewdly; he’d been going for the last few weeks, after all.
“Of course, do come in,” Mycroft says. He opens the door and stands to the side, giving John and Sherlock a bland smile as he gestures them in.
“Boring,” Sherlock murmurs. He leans forward and gestures towards the man’s ring, which John realizes now is a bit dirty and cracked. “If you work in forensics, you should have a few brain cells lurking about in there. Use them to figure out your bad habit.”
and can’t do anything –
John sighs.  “I can hear you, you know,” he says.  “Mary said her mum used to make her a cupcake just like that when she was little.  She would’ve loved it.”
“You don’t find it strange that you talked with her and almost immediately afterward, you met a vile spirit that nearly killed you?”
He hears a rustle beside him and knows that Sherlock has turned his head back towards the sky.
“Seems that way,” Mrs. Hudson agrees.
He hears the telly turn on, and then he feels warmth pressing against his side: John’s leg. Selfishly, he leans into it, allows himself the comfort even though it makes something in his heart twist that he doesn’t understand. The warmth on his head, John’s hand, begins to move, John’s fingers stroking through his hair tenderly, so tenderly, that he feels as if he’s cracking apart. He sighs, his breath shaky, and focuses on the sensation, on the exact points of pressure John’s fingertips leave on his scalp, shifting and soothing, on the constant pressure of John’s leg against his side.
“Nice man, what is that, titanium?”
The girl shakes her head.  “No, no, I can’t.”
Sherlock shrugs and turns back to his groceries, but his back is stiff. “I’ve been shopping for myself for a while now. I got used to it,” he says.
“What the fuck happened?” John asks, looking around incredulously.
, John,” Sherlock says. “Get out of the way. I’m shooting whether you move or not.”
, John! There’s nothing I can do!   We have to obey the laws of magic or it will be worse than it is now.”
When John wakes again, he’s still on the couch in 221B. Moonlight is streaming in the windows, and Sherlock is curled up on the couch, his head resting against John’s thigh. John blinks at the sight, his heart clenching as it catches up to him that this is real.
Arthur frowns, the many wrinkles in his face shifting downwards. “You’re sick,” he says. Anxiety creeps into his voice, and John feels guilty to cause him worry.
“No one is exempt from wishing, John, not even me,” Sherlock says. His voice shakes, and the smoke around him is getting thicker, covering his hands where they’re spread on either side of his body.
“You’ll see,” Sherlock says.
He keeps his control when Mycroft brings him in for top-secret debriefing meetings; it’s easy to turn off his emotions and fall into the familiar pattern of deduction and fact when Mycroft is involved. For that short time, his unbearable thoughts take a back burner; it’s only Moriarty and The Work, which is pale and confusing without John. But he’s falling short, and he can’t find the answers.
Mary steps forward to look, but she stumbles over an extension cord on the ground. Files slide out of her grasp and land skewed on the floor, and she automatically reaches out for John to steady herself. Her hand wraps tight around his arm and he freezes, his own files falling to the floor as a sudden flash of a dark, cold, horrible, and desolate feeling washes over him. He grimaces, nausea rising in his stomach, and pushes her off his arm, shaking. She backs up, her eyes wide and a hand over her mouth, and he stumbles away from her, his shoulder slamming into the bookcase, and then it falls, though it’s secured to the wall with screws and supports. They snap and it comes crashing down, files tumbling out and the metal shelves sliding out of the structure, crushing him as they plummet to the floor, their jagged edges breaking into the soft skin of his back and trapping him.
“You’re sure-“
Sherlock smiles and John is suddenly very aware of Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder, and of the few centimeters of water between them. He’s rarely eye-to-eye with Sherlock given their height difference, but here in the water, their faces are level, and his eyes flicker over Sherlock’s features. He finds himself entranced for a moment, taken in by the flush of color blooming on Sherlock’s cheeks and the magic that surrounds them, until suddenly, Sherlock lets his hand drop back into the water with a splash.
“We made a deal, for one thing. Also, it’s quite cute, isn’t it?” John says, grinning when Sherlock scowls, the tiniest hint of redness appearing in his cheeks.
“You were taking too long,” Mycroft says simply.  “Sherlock was – worried.  An unusual state for him, surely.  Usually, he thinks in terms of equivalence, or the value of actions and their counterparts.  But in this case, he was worried for your wellbeing.  It appears you make him think quite differently than he normally does.”
“Yes, good observation,” Sherlock says scathingly. “This is Billy, an old friend of mine.”
“You know, you don’t seem like the type to enter a competition,” John remarks later, from where he sits beside Sherlock in the taxi headed for the athletic center.
“Let’s go to bed,” John says.  His voice is gentle, and Sherlock feels as if he’s melting.
Instead, he finds himself walking the city, mind spinning, eager to get rid of the pent up frustrations and emotions inside of him and barely taking in his surroundings. He lets his mind drift, lets himself remember that cursed Christmas he’s put himself into rehab trying to forget about.
“Give him back!” Sherlock screams, standing up and reaching for him. Mummy grabs him and holds him, trying to rock him and shush him like he’s a little baby, but he twists and pushes in her arms. “Daddy, give him back!” he pleads.
Sherlock shakes his head. “He wasn’t. He’s dead, so his ability to connect to you is different from mine,” he says. “He must have sensed the change in the strength of your connection to other worlds and waited for you here, in a place familiar to you. Perhaps I’m subconsciously doing that; astral projection is not my specialty, but I do have abilities to manipulate the dimensions.”
“I’m working on an antidote,” Sherlock says. “I can’t create an antidote without the poison.”
Sherlock snorts a laugh. “Are we reduced to inane chatter now?” he says, but he’s smiling fondly even through the anxiety he feels.
“John,” Sherlock replies. He didn’t mean for it to be such a useless reply, but it came out before he could stop himself, and he winces.
Sherlock’s shoulders relax and finally, a smile breaks out on his face. “Perfect,” he says. Something flashes over his face, some emotions he seems hesitant to give voice to, before he shakes his head and smiles, a soft, genuine smile that makes John’s grow in response. “After all,” he adds, “I’d be lost without my blogger.”
“I can hear you!” John says in frustration.  “Just bloody tell me what to do!”  Mrs. Hudson looks shocked by his outburst, and he sighs, rubbing a hand over his face.  “Right, sorry,” he says.  His heart is pounding; he doesn’t have time for this.  “Just…tell me how to find her.  Please.”
, here in 221B. Their strange little family is here, and he scrubs a face over his hand, trying to take it all in.
“Sorry – what?” John asks, remembering how vehement Sherlock had been that John had to do this job, that he would never be in Mycroft’s debt.
John’s a bit worried about climbing through the window, but as he goes, pain stabbing through his shoulder from the movement, Sherlock helps him through with steady, warm hands, and John can’t help but smile as he gets his footing on the fire escape, straightening his clothes and pushing the window back down until it’s only open a crack. Sherlock picks up the urn and the water and heads up the stairs, and John follows, anticipation crackling over his skin. He has no idea what they’re doing on the roof, but he’s excited to find out. He likes when he gets the chance to see this mysterious, powerful side of Sherlock.
“At the brook?” Sherlock asks, confused.
“Oh, John, I’ve just made some tea for you two! Are you going out?” she asks.
He lays a gentle hand on her shoulder.  “It doesn’t seem very nice over there,” he says gesturing towards the green and black area.  “Let’s go a different way, alright?”  He can’t muster a smile for her.  He feels tired and weary.  His heart is no longer pounding; he’s no longer sweating.
could? Go back to the way we were?” John asks skeptically. He rubs his thumb along Sherlock’s jaw again, and Sherlock leans into the touch, sighing. “God,” John says. “Just look at you. You’re – I never thought you felt things this way until it was too late, and I was - married. But now – it’s not too late, is it?”
“I love you,” Sherlock finally manages, voice soft, low, his words disappearing into the safety of John’s skin.  “I always have.  I always will.”
“How charitable,” Sherlock remarks.
Angelo chuckles.  “I’m glad,” he says.  “It’s not every day we get a human customer, let alone such a powerful one as you.”
, John. Always so worried about him.” He smiles and shrugs, waving a flippant hand through the air. “But you’re too late! He’s gone!”
“On the few occasions I let myself imagine this actually happening, I never came close to how it would actually be,” Sherlock says. He feels cracked open and exposed and it’s terrifying but there’s a strange hope flickering inside him, making him trust John with this.
“I’ve waited nearly all my life for this,” Sherlock says. His eyes are still closed, his face turned down towards John’s, his lips so close they brush the corner of John’s mouth when he speaks.
Sherlock looks up at the sky through narrowed eyes once they’ve reached the top of the stairs. He looks as if he’s searching for something, but John can’t imagine what that something might be. Nonetheless, Sherlock gives a satisfied nod and heads to the center of the roof.
“Oi,” John says again. “Sherlock.”
“Then how can I free you?” John asks.
“Yeah,” he says. He sounds relieved, and Sherlock is grateful for the time he’s been spending reading mother’s message boards on the internet. John nods, smoothing his hands over Iris’ head, exhaling loudly through his nose. “Yeah, that’s…can you grab her hat and blankets?”
He’s just about to turn the knob when suddenly, the door swings open on its own, and his arm falls uselessly to his side in his surprise. An old woman is standing there, wearing an apron and smiling kindly. “Hello, dear,” she says, her eyes crinkling in the corners as she smiles. “You must be a customer for Sherlock. Come on in, then.”
“Really?” John repeats, staring intently at Sherlock.
When Mycroft is gone, John turns toward Sherlock and hesitates for a moment, but goes to the kitchen instead.  He makes Sherlock’s tea and brings it into the living room.
From where they stand, John can see that the path continues ahead of them down the hill, and then it winds through a forest until it comes to a large circular clearing with a big tree in the center that appears to be glowing the same color as their lantern, though he can’t make out its details from so far away, and every inch of the path is filled with spirits.
John falters for a moment, surprised at how much she already knows, but pushes that aside.  “Baker Street?” John asks.  “But–”
“I don’t understand,” John says. He’s tired, so tired.
said he was quitting smoking, and gave me the cigarettes to hold onto for him. We chatted a bit more, nothing important, and then I felt really tired and next thing I knew, I woke up in my bed.”
, his most important asset, for years.
Sherlock laughs and drinks his nectar, and John can’t be offended by the laugh, not really.
“And why is it my job to carry everything?” John adds.
“John,” Sherlock groans. “John, too – it’s too –”
He goes downstairs and Mrs. Hudson is in the foyer, wringing her hands. “John, dear, you should really stay in,” she tells him.
“We have to hold the lantern up to the fruit,” Sherlock says, his voice hushed, as if he doesn’t want to speak too loudly in front of such a powerful presence as the tree before them, which he looks at with a reverence John’s unaccustomed to seeing on his face.
“It’s not
“John,” Sherlock says, eyeing him carefully from a few feet away. “Could you really not tell that he’s not human?”
“A competition isn’t always about other people’s approval,” Sherlock points out.  “Perhaps it’s about my own goals.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and Mary laughs, watching as John goes. As soon as he’s out of sight, though, she turns to Sherlock and the warmth on her face snaps into cold concentration. Her mouth settles into a firm line, and her eyes are narrowed and focused.
“It really happened,” John assures him, voice steady and strong. “It did. I’m so sorry – I tried
Molly giggles and hides it behind her hand. “No, no, nothing like that,” she says. “It’s just easier to know what to call you. Put your hand on the handle,” she says, putting her own on the one close to her. She rests her hand palm down, and John carefully copies her movements on his side of the table.
“I don’t really get it,” John admits.
Sherlock ignores the sounds of Mycroft apologizing for him and edges his way into the kitchen, hoping to go unseen. He sneaks into his favorite crevice between the refrigerator and the counter, a space so narrow he’s the only one who fits, while the warm, familiar scents of meat pies and cakes and biscuits make his stomach growl and his mouth water. Carefully, he peeks around the counter and does some reconnaissance, observes that his prediction had been correct and Herbert is nowhere in sight, and slithers out of his hiding spot to go straight to the counter, where sure enough, there is a small plate with three small meringues sitting atop it. He smiles and takes one, popping it into his mouth and savoring the flavor on his tongue, smiling around the sweet taste.
“A new friend?” Mary asks, her brow furrowed.
? Where is it?”
The hand grows gentle after a moment, though, and John’s voice is gentle, too, telling him to breathe. “In, out, in, out, that’s it, just breathe, Sherlock,” John is saying, and Sherlock can’t explain it, but a hot rush is forming behind his sinuses.
She smiles at him, then peers at the tote bag he’s holding. “And who’s in there?” she asks.
“Shh,” John says, clumsily petting Sherlock’s hair, stroking up and down his back, his own heart beating fast, still out of breath and lethargic.
“Do you want something to drink?” Sherlock asks, unaccountably nervous.
“I doubt it,” John replies, but when Greg lights a cigarette with a flick of his empty hand and then hands the small bag to John, John takes it, holding it carefully in his hands. “I thought you didn’t do magic…?” John asks, eyeing the lit cigarette.
“Oh,” John says, unsure how to take Sherlock’s answer. “That’s probably for the better; school can be a bit rough.”
John frowns, and the smell he’d noticed earlier intensifies.  He stops, choking, and covers his mouth with his free hand again, tugging on the girl’s hand and forcing her to stop.
“Right,” John says, looking down at the tube. “And my shoulder’s better. Thanks.”
Sherlock winces. Mummy’s magic feels cold and makes his skin prickle like he’s been rolling in nettles rather than lying in the cool grass surrounded by flitterbys. He doesn’t want to go to Mummy; he wants to stay in the grass.   He feels the magic in the air, thinks of what he wants, and holds up his hand. Mummy’s Sonorus charm and her voice stop, and Sherlock doesn’t have to look to know that she is angry. He giggles in delight, and continues to play with the flitterbys,
“Oh,” Sherlock says. “I used to play with the flitterbys and things.”
help.
Sherlock just stares at him, feeling short-circuited by the warmth of John’s fingers wrapped around his wrist.
a bit boring. More than a bit. Can’t exactly work as an Auror anymore, though, with my leg.”
“Oh,” Sherlock says. “That’s not very nice,” he adds.
And then he hears it. Something familiar and yet foreign, something that makes his heart beat faster and his eyes fly open, though he doesn’t dare turn towards the sound.
“What? Art?” John asks, pleased at the feeling of Redbeard slithering up his sleeve, but too tired to shift his arm to make it easier for him.
He looks as best he can down the tunnels to his left and right, but he can’t see anything besides black walls and darkness. It’s the same in front of him, and he has a moment of panic, wondering which way to go. He can see himself getting desperately lost, unable to find Sherlock
“John,” Sherlock says, but his voice is foreign, strange, wrenched from deep inside of him, rough with the emotion he’s tried so hard to stop. His hands are beginning to shake now, and his breath is getting fast. He’s rooted in place; he can’t move, can’t do anything except think of
. His heart is pounding, and before he knows it, he’s back at the door, feeling hopeless and alone.
Sherlock does, shifting his hips and tugging the waist of his pajamas down just enough to free his cock, then lets himself curl back against John, nuzzles against his knee. “Good,” John says. “You’re doing so well,” he adds. He tugs on Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock lets his hand move faster, lets sensation wash over him, feels a tightening in his stomach and limbs that feels delicious.
John’s smile grows. It’s warm and gentle like the second movement of the Bruch, like the sound of four perfectly in tune strings, like a soaring melody, and it makes Sherlock’s eyes prickle.
“It’s alright,” he says, looking at Sherlock in concern. Sherlock seems more in control somehow, and he’s closed his eyes, not looking at John. “The ambulance is here. Let’s go.”
He’s breathing regularly, and his pulse is fine, but John’s eyes keep flitting frantically over his features, trying to absorb as many details as he can, to ascertain whether or not he’ll be okay, but it’s near impossible because he has no idea what’s just happened.  He glances up towards where the woman was, but he can’t see her; she’s already gone.  He has a feeling he should chase her, but he knows he can’t leave Sherlock, and panic is beginning to build inside of hi.
John frowns. “How’d you get out, then?” he asks.
“She said I was invited, didn’t she? It’s not like I invited myself,” Sherlock says reasonably as he picks nonexistent lint off of the arm of his suit jacket.
“What – right,” John says, rubbing his eyes and sitting up, pausing for a moment when his head swims in dizziness. He opens his eyes and turns to look at Sherlock when he sits beside him, then looks at the table, where he’s put down the two plates of food, ignoring Billy’s protests that he’s just taunting him, putting food so close to him. “Did you make dinner?” John asks.
“John,” Sherlock says. His voice is crackly, and John wonders where he is. “You’re sick.”
John takes a deep breath.  His hand flexes at his side.  Normally, he’d be yelling at her, demanding answers, but she seems strangely vulnerable, and, well, off.  “That’s very, very important to someone very important to me,” he says instead.  “He could die without it.  I really need it.”
“That’s certainly not the face of belief,” Sherlock says. He looks amused, if the slightly raised eyebrow is anything to go by. “John H. Watson,” he repeats. “And what does the H stand for?” he asks.
John hasn’t realized he’s fallen asleep until his text alert invades his consciousness. He comes awake with a surprised start, his body jerking, before he blinks the sleep out of his eyes and winces at the pain in his shoulder, which is increasingly sharp. He tries to process the sound that woke him and when he realizes it’s his phone, he pulls it out of his pocket. The flat is dark around him, and his screen glows bright against the darkness. He’s not surprised to see that his text is from Sherlock.
John decides he’s in need of an
He’s still thinking about it when Sherlock suddenly hops to his feet, extending an arm towards John. “Our clothes are dry,” he says. “Let’s go.”
“Christ, don't apologize,” John says. “There’s no need.”
By the time the day is over, John is rushing out, eager to leave work and stop endangering everyone around him with the spirit that’s attached itself to him. This one is different than most; it seems particularly malicious, making him colder and more nauseous than most spirits, and yet it hasn’t made any move to hurt him. It’s terrifying, really, and he feels frantic to get back to Baker Street.
Later that night, John’s in his room, presumably sleeping, and Sherlock goes into his hidden room. He clears away some of the old dead plants with their withered leaves and tangled, knotted, dried out stems. He’ll have to get some new plants, he thinks.
“Please take that object out of your pocket,” he says.
John shudders and nods; he remembers it well.
, you knew you’d have to–”
“What about your family?” Arthur asks.
Sherlock’s smiling at him, looking at him like he is a treasure. “Don’t you remember, John, the very first time we met?” His voice is soft and his thumb continues to stroke over John’s face. “I told you it was dangerous for spirits to know your full name and your birthday. It’s a pathway to the deepest parts of you; your soul, your heart. I’ve always known yours, but there was no need for you to know mine, or so I thought. But there it is, the whole of it.”
Sherlock’s eyes widen. “You – you’re my nutcracker,” he repeats.
John feels warmth bloom over his cheeks and he hastily turns his head to look back up at the sky, his heart beating faster. A small smile curves on his lips. “I suppose normal is a bit overrated,” he concedes, eyes trained on the clear blue sky above them.
Sherlock turns to him and grins. “Better eat quickly,” he advises.
under any circumstances, let go, do you understand?”
“Long. It used to be different,” he blurts without thinking.
The sunlight streams in the window still, a little brighter now, and it stretches across John’s shoulder, disappears in the crevices between their bodies, lingers on the planes of Sherlock’s back where John’s hand dips in and out of the light as he strokes up and down Sherlock’s spine, and the morning goes on.  Sherlock closes his eyes, warm and content, surrounded by John, alive, in love, grateful, flayed open and yet more whole than he’s ever been.
“Oh,” John says, confused. “Er, thanks?”
“Yeah, exactly why I was giving it to Mary,” John says.  He sits beside Sherlock, holding the bag in his hands and looking at it in irritation.
“John,” he murmurs. “Do you trust me?”
“Hello,” he says with a tight smile.  “Pleasure to meet you.  I can see you’d like to talk to my friend.  Go ahead; help yourself.  He’s a selfish, arrogant, sneaky git, but help yourself.”
He’s saved a response when Mary starts to speak. “I’ve found a nice little area over there,” she says, gesturing behind her. “It’s not too crowded, and it’s in the shade. Shall we?”
“Oh,” Mary says, a small smile creeping onto her face. “Sorry, no, I didn’t mean it like that. I was just curious. I never hear you talk about anyone besides Sherlock.”
John shakes his head and swallows shakily. “No,” he says. It’s impossible, isn’t it? He saw Sherlock, after all, met him on the roof. On the
“Morning,” John says. Sherlock can hear a smile in his voice, and it makes his own lips curl gently, his heart beating faster at the way their bodies are entwined, at how perfect it feels. John shifts until he’s lying a little further down on the bed, and nudges Sherlock’s pliant body until Sherlock is on his side, and John rolls onto his side to face him. He tangles their legs together, and Sherlock sighs, pressing closer, feeling an incandescent smile bloom upon his lips.
John reaches out and strokes his face. Sherlock tilts his head and leans into the touch with a breathy sigh and John smiles.
John has a run-in with a particularly nasty spirit, and Sherlock uses some interesting magic as a result.  Our boys also have some wine together, and go visit Sherlock's favorite fortuneteller.  Meanwhile, exactly who/what is Mary?
“Alright?” John asks. He doesn’t move his hand from Sherlock’s arm, and Sherlock’s heart is pounding, his brain miles behind it.
The kettle whistles, and John pours their tea, bringing a cup to Sherlock, who miraculously revives to sit up and take it, sipping cautiously and then sighing, shoulders relaxing as he leans back into the couch.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, Christ, would you bloody breathe?”
– with every fiber of his being, and rather than answering, he leans forward and kisses him again, hot and hard and eager. He brings a hand down between them and wraps it around John’s cock, thumbing over the leaking slit and spreading the moisture around.
Sherlock looks up at him, his eyes open and serious. “Yes,” he says. “Body and soul. The spirits were very…thorough.”
“Alright?” he asks.
“Yeah, I know,” John says with a fond roll of his eyes. “Um… a while back now, you said the curse in my leg looks like a knot.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and doesn’t say anything, just shoves the third meringue into his mouth and wonders if she’d notice if he snuck a pie.
“That’s not what most people say,” Sherlock says.
“Cheers for this,” John manages, words slurring a bit in his sudden fatigue.
He sighs, knowing he’s about to do something dangerous, but his bladder is beginning to feel the presence of all the tea he’d drank that day. He hesitates, glancing between Sherlock and Mary for a moment, but he has no choice. “I’ll just go to the loo,” John says, giving Mary an apologetic look. “Play nice, Sherlock.”
“I thought I lost you,” John murmurs. “You – ”
“I’ll see you later,” John says. His voice is crackly and raw, and it hurts to speak. He feels guilty when Redbeard makes a series of forlorn, low squeaks and cranes his little head towards John, but it’s already 3:29. He needs to see Arthur.
John swallows shakily and blinks a few times, his heart racing. His stomach twists. “Thank you,” he says, his voice rough. He wants to say so much more; he knows these words aren’t anywhere near adequate, but he’s stunned, unable to express his gratitude.
“She’s drinking water instead of wine and she keeps touching her stomach but not like she’s ashamed,” he says, looking up at Mycroft for approval.
John sleeps through most of Friday, waking only for coughing fits, or to find another blanket. Redbeard stays curled around his neck, and John is grateful. He’s feverish, he knows, but as the clock gets closer to 3:30, the usual time he meets Arthur, an anxiety builds inside of him that he can’t ignore. He wants to see him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and stops abruptly. “The pathway exists in both directions,” Sherlock tells him, still standing.
Sherlock’s brow furrows. “Who, Moriarty?”
“Why?” John asks.
“Oh, er, this is Sherlock,” he says, gesturing towards Sherlock.
“The state of you! The guests are arriving any minute and you’re covered in dust!” Mummy comes closer and reaches out for a clean dishtowel, which she dampens under the sink.
Sherlock shakes his head.  “It’s one of the places dead people go,” he corrects.  “There are many.  That one is…not good.”
“Sherlock,” John says. His voice comes out rough and sleep-worn. “You-”
Sherlock frowns. He doesn’t understand why everyone is unhappy with his confetti. Sometimes he doesn’t understand a lot of things. He feels like he lives in a different world than everyone else. He shakes his head, uncertain.
“So that’s what brought you to me,” Molly says, smiling. “A butterfly signifies the start of a journey. A metamorphosis and a transformation.” She looks at John carefully. “Yours has already begun, hasn’t it,” she says. Her smile is soft.
something new,” Billy says and then laughs. Sherlock chuckles with him, and John shakes his head, but a smile creeps over his face in spite of himself.
“Quite a nice skull, isn’t it,” she remarks.
“Don’t look away,” Sherlock murmurs, his fingers tightening on John’s wrists.
“John,” Sherlock says reverently, letting his thumb sweep over the nub of John’s nipple again.  He rubs it back and forth, back and forth, with no specific intent, but just enough to feel the texture, firm and familiar, against the pad of his thumb.  Again, he presses a kiss to the skin of John’s chest, but he holds his mouth there for a moment, tasting John’s sleep-warm skin.  He shifts until he’s got a better angle and he trails kisses along John’s chest until his mouth is where his thumb once was.  The taste of John on his tongue is perfect, like a dream, and he gently kisses John’s nipple, caressing just as gently as the sun’s touch he’s just replaced.  Gently, hesitantly, he swirls around it with his tongue, and he shifts until his hips are on top of John’s, and he’s pleased to feel that John is hard beneath him.
“No,” Sherlock says. He sounds a bit threatening, and John’s not sure what to make of it. “Let’s see what kind of fortuneteller is here now.”
“Took you long enough,” Sherlock says, but he sits up upon seeing the skull in John’s hands. “Ah, Billy!”
Immediately, he ignores Mike in favor of scanning his companion, a shorter, handsome man leaning heavily on a cane. Strong, golden magic, with a dark stain in the area of his weaker leg. Curious.
“Sherlock,” John says. “Sit down; you’ve just gotten nine stitches. I’ll make the bloody tea.” Sherlock doesn’t reply, and John sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. He goes to the kitchen and stands beside Sherlock.
He walks with poise and purpose, his eyes never straying from the target as he walks across the platform.  His body is relaxed, like he’s merely walking down the street, and yet his posture clearly holds power and confidence.  He doesn’t rush, and yet he doesn’t linger; he is self-assured, and the entirety of the audience seems to notice it.
, Mummy! How else did he get out of here?”
Thanks to Redbeard’s familiar presence, he feels marginally calmer when Mycroft returns, a cup of tea in his hand. John scrubs his hand over his eyes and takes the tea from Mycroft with a nod of thanks, and Mycroft sits opposite him, in Sherlock’s chair. It makes something ache in John’s chest, but he pushes it away.
“I boiled it, you make the tea,” John says dismissively, going back to his paper and pointedly flicking it to straighten the pages.
“I can guess,” Mummy says. “He’s only a child; he’s allowed to play,” she adds. Sherlock holds his nutcracker tighter and leans into Mummy’s touch. He doesn’t like being called a child, but he knows it will get Mycroft into trouble if he goes along with it, so he allows it this time and glares at Mycroft, who sighs, which he’s been doing a lot ever since he became a teenager. Sherlock hates it.
“Just different?” Mary repeats, amused, her brow arched. John spares her a tight smile and a shrug in response as they reach the top of the stairs. They head to the file room, a large room lined with tall bookcases filled with folders, tabs sticking out to notate where each letter of the alphabet begins.
Sherlock is just out of rehab, and he’s refused his parents’ invitation to come home for Christmas. He hates Christmas; he always has, ever since that night with John that torments him even now. He sits in his new flat on Baker Street, alone and just barely able to pay the rent, miserable and cold and desperate for something to take his mind off the fact that it’s Christmas. It’s dark save for the fairy lights Mrs. Hudson has put on his mantle, and he scowls at them, trying desperately not to think of sitting in a little room inside a giant castle, eating sweets beside a fire.
John giggles and holds the bandana in his hand. He pictures it around a mess of unruly black curls and grins when his giggles taper off. It’s a heady feeling, imagining Sherlock as anything but the composed man he knows now. He finds it terribly endearing, and he suddenly wants to see Sherlock more than anything. He yawns, exhaustion hitting him out of nowhere.

. I don’t want to suffer like this. It’s just – this one, it’s the spirit of a man who died in the war. You can’t even begin to imagine how hard it is, looking at his bloody ghost following me around all day,” she says. John frowns and then swivels around in alarm when the spirit behind him begins to move. It approaches the girl and stands right in front of her, looking her in the eye, but she doesn’t notice; she just stares right through it at her friends
“You don’t have to hold the chair so tight,” John tells him. He strokes his hands up and down Sherlock’s sides in an effort to relax him, but it’s making him more needy, more desperate.  “Go on. Relax.”
He leans back on his heels and watches as Sherlock suddenly takes a sharp, deep inhalation.  It’s shocking to see his inert body suddenly move; his eyes fly open and his spine arches off the bench and his arms flop to the side, and he holds himself taut for a moment before he lies flat again.  He blinks rapidly and his forehead screws up in thought and then he turns his head to the side, lifting one hand to rub at his head.
They walk in silence, and John steps closer to Sherlock, so close that their arms are pressed together. When they arrive at the tree, John’s overwhelmed by how beautiful it is, and he tilts his head back to try and look up at it, but he can’t see all the way to the top. The fruits, surrounded by vivid red flowers and lush green leaves, glow with the same magical light of the lantern he holds with Sherlock. John swallows, overcome by the sight, suddenly aware of how lucky he is that he’s able to witness such a thing. His heart is beating faster again, but this time, it’s not out of fear.
“I’m making tea,” John says, going to the kitchen. “Oh, fucking hell,” he says, and Sherlock winces when he remembers the beakers he smashed in there. He waves his hand and clears the mess, and grudgingly does the same in the living room, while John makes tea without magic.
Sherlock’s eyes widen. “You live in a
“Don’t you dare throw that away,” John warns, standing in front of him with his hands on his hips and blocking his path.
“I suppose you wouldn’t, between sulking on the sofa and sitting there staring at the door waiting for me to come home,” John says before blowing across the surface of his tea. Billy laughs from the bookcase, his jaw thumping against the shelf, and John grins.
“Don’t be like that,” Greg says. “You’re making a great impression so far. Everyone knows your name.”
Sherlock swallows. “John,” he says. “Please.”
John looks up at him with a smile when he finishes, and hands Sherlock a glass, holding it out delicately by the stem. Sherlock takes it, watching as John picks up his.
“Hold it over his chest and let go,” Mycroft says.  His voice is less cold than usual, and John is grateful.
“I won’t,” he tells her. His words are carefully measured, but the loud breaths he takes through his nose betray his anxiety. “But if I don’t get him back, I may as well.”
John trudges up as usual, but his heart is pounding. He doesn’t know what to expect. When he opens the door, Sherlock is in the kitchen, making tea. He doesn’t talk or look up when John enters.
Sherlock’s eyes widen and he looks down at the nutcracker. Sticking out of the nutcracker’s pocket is a little corner of something dark blue, a raised piece of wood that hadn’t been there the day before. Around Sherlock’s waist, his dressing gown is missing its belt.
Redbeard whinges at his side and presses close to him, his body strong and warm, but the fear is creeping over John again no matter how much he tries to bury it; his entire body is trembling. The spirits are closing in on him, to the point that they are beginning to become corporeal. John freezes when he feels a sharp pain on his face. He reaches up, his hand shaking, and feels his heart beat faster when his fingers come away wet. He knows it’s blood, his own, coming from a slash across his cheek. He blinks rapidly, trying to push down the panic rising fast inside of him as the slash on his face begins to sting.
Billy chuckles at Sherlock’s comment, and John can’t help but stare at the expressionless skull’s shaking jaw as he does so.
When they get to the park, John shivers, the wind cold against his hot skin. He makes his way to their bench, ignoring the lively sounds around him, the idea of Arthur waiting for him and feeling lonely burned into his mind. When he gets there, Arthur is sitting alone, as John has been expecting, wringing his hands in his lap.
Sherlock turns to him and rolls his eyes. “Obvious,” he says, but won’t say anything more. John laughs and sits at the table, watching Sherlock with a small smile and amusement in his eyes. Sherlock is standing near the coffeepot, waiting for it to finish dripping, but he narrows his eyes at John’s hand, where just the tiniest bit of black fabric peeks out.
Sherlock forces his eyes to relax, forces his hands to continue the Debussy, even though his heart is pounding. He’s not emotionally prepared to see John in his current maudlin state, especially because as he falls into the familiar comfort of deductions, he knows that something has
“John,” he chokes. “I can’t –”
He’d been scared and more than a bit angry with Sherlock when they first arrived, but that has rapidly diminished and been replaced by appreciation for this strange place. Something in his chest clenches, something that makes him realize how very different his life has become, and he can’t help but
He goes to the mantle and roots around frantically for his spare cigarettes, upturning the skull in his search, and his eyes widen when a familiar little metal crown skitters across the mantle. He’d forgotten he stowed it away in there, and he picks it up, holding it between his fingers and feeling a sense of melancholy wash over him that quickly turns to anger, anger that this stupid piece of metal exists, that this stupid fucking piece of metal has caused him anguish and caused him to doubt his
A huff of laughter comes from Sherlock, and John turns his head to glance at him, smiling a bit at the sound.
“Yeah, yeah, keep it down up here, then,” Billy calls as Mrs. Hudson leaves, Billy tucked up under her arm and girlish, pleased laughter coming from her mouth.
The last one is suddenly being repeated with startling frequency, and John feels his eyes widen. His heart is pounding in his chest now, and adrenaline is rising in spikes.
John blinks. “What – really?”
As usual, I'd love to hear your thoughts!  I hope you're enjoying the story, and thank you for reading! <3
“I’m at Zosima’s house,” John says.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but he can’t help the light feeling that washes over him, nor can he help the smile that stretches across his lips, and so he gets up and goes to the counter. “I do make a better cup of tea than you,” he says conversationally, just so John doesn’t think he’s gotten away with it that easily.

He wonders if he’s dreaming; is he astrally projecting? Or, perhaps, had the past few days never happened at all? Has everything since Mary touched him and he hit the bookcase been some kind of dream?
something like this,
“Normal’s boring,” Sherlock says. John knows without looking that he’s smiling. “What
“Yes,” Sherlock says, taking a long sip of his wine.
The old woman, Mrs. Hudson, scurries out of the kitchen bearing a tray with two cups of tea on top. “Oh, you’re going?” she asks. She sounds considerably sadder than the situation warrants, and it makes John pause for a moment. He spares her a glance before turning back to the man, Sherlock.
John doesn’t have time to get angry, he knows that, and he turns to Billy desperately, his fingers curling into Sherlock’s shirt.
“The poor dear,” Mrs. Hudson comments again, and John would feel embarrassed if he had the energy. But then, Sherlock’s fingers run through his hair again, and he sighs.
John rolls his eyes and lets Redbeard scurry up his arm. “Yeah, yeah, world of difference. For you, too; now you actually eat. I’m not sure you even knew you had a refrigerator before I moved in here.”
John shrugs again, a bit uneasy. “I think it’s just a coincidence. Mary’s quite sweet, really.” He pauses, thinking for a moment, glancing at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. “Actually, she said she’d like to meet you tomorrow night, if you’re free.”
“Right, lost your umbrella then?”
And then John steps back, holds him by the shoulders.
John wakes to the smell of Chinese food. He opens his eyes and blinks a few times, disoriented and confused. He’s not quite sure where he is or what time it is. He swivels his head a bit and realizes he’s lying on the couch in his flat, and then suddenly he remembers the spirit, and making his way home, and then Sherlock taking care of him. With a flush of embarrassment, he remembers falling asleep on Sherlock, but the man in question is in the kitchen, if the sounds he hears are anything to go by.
“You are a treasure, John Watson,” he murmurs. “Don’t forget it.”
“Of course it is,” Sherlock says impatiently. “What’s apparently

body. He decides to try moving his hand and it twitches on his knee. Its swift and expected response is reassuring, and finally, he feels as if he belongs in this body on this sofa again. He lifts his hand, lets it fall on Redbeard’s head, scratches him gently, and feels his delicate bones beneath his fingers, allowing the familiar feeling to ground him in this reality.
John. More importantly, I need an assistant. Work here, in my shop,” Sherlock says.
It’s a nutcracker. He’s seen them before, of course, but there’s something about this one that seems special. His eyes are blue and he wears the uniform of a soldier, gold buttons and red coat gleaming proudly in the warm light of the ballroom. Carefully, Sherlock takes him out of the box and hardly notices when Mummy takes it away from him because he’s so busy running his fingers over the smooth wood and cataloguing all the little details of his new friend. He’s a handsome nutcracker, Sherlock thinks, smiling when he pulls on the lever in the back that makes his mouth open.
The side of John’s mouth quirks into a grin for just a moment, then settles again into something very much opposite. “There was a late term miscarriage. It’s fine. It just – it brought up a lot. But it’s.” He stops, clears his throat, waves his hand through the air and gestures to 221B, his eyes anywhere but on Sherlock. “Made me think how nice it is to be back.”
The fortuneteller laughs, but she still seems slightly disconcerted by Sherlock. “Anyway, shall we get started?” she says, and John can’t help but admire her tenacity.
His head hurts and he thinks he’ll be sick. Mummy casts a spell to straighten Mycroft’s robes out on the street, and Sherlock winces, feels it crackle over him, presses closer to Dad, rocks against him.
“Come with me?” Sherlock asks. He sounds hesitant and hopeful, unsure if this is allowed.
. I’ve never heard anything like it.”
“Good,” Sherlock says, then realizes what he’s said. “That you hit him with a pan, not that he wasn’t nice,” he clarifies.
Sherlock shakes his head, eyes still on the door. “No, nothing like that. It’s his own problem, but that was probably the last time he’ll come here.” Sherlock reaches for his tea and takes another long sip, then peers at John. “Go on, then,” he says. “Follow him if you want, but he has to figure this out on his own. You can’t help him.”
“Oh, I have an idea!” John says. “I gave you the crown, so now you have to give me something, too, and that seals our friendship.”
“Yes, well done,” Sherlock says, an edge of sarcasm in his voice.
“Good fortune?” John asks incredulously.  “She just took your soul!”
“You talk about him so much, and now you’ve moved in with him. And he’s your…friend?”
One of Sherlock’s shoulders rises in a shrug, the smooth fabric of his suit shifting against his skin. He doesn’t break eye contact with the customer. “That depends on the wish. Something of equal value,” he says. His voice is silky.
“Mummy!” Mycroft complains. “You don’t even know what happened.”
“I think he means Redbeard, dear,” Mrs. Hudson says.
I'm so sorry for the long wait, everyone!  This story hasn't been abandoned, and updates will be much more regular from now on.  I got sick over the summer around the time that I stopped posting new chapters of this, and I was sick for a few months - from July until around October.  But I got out of the habit of writing/posting as RL took over.
John takes his hand from his face and nods before standing to usher the man out, closing the door behind him and then turning to Sherlock.
Sherlock nods, swallowing, his eyes flickering over John’s face, taking in the gentle slope of his nose, the blue of his eyes, the familiar furrow of his brow.   “I love you,” Sherlock says suddenly.  He hadn’t meant to say it, hadn’t expected to, but it’s
“If you leave here via Sherlock’s closet, you create a pathway between worlds formed with Sherlock’s magic, which will protect you, this building, and Sherlock himself. Go to the closet and think of Sherlock. Bring Redbeard,” Mycroft says.
“Thank you,” he says.  “These will do, won’t they, Mycroft?”
Sherlock makes a look of disgust, and to his surprise, John laughs. “I’ll take that as a no,” John says in amusement. “I don’t these days, either, if you were wondering,” he adds.
When they get back to 221B, Mycroft is sitting in their living room.  He doesn’t say anything when they enter; just reads the stony silence between them and manages to raise one eyebrow in a look of condescension, which makes John angry enough to not make him a cup of tea when he puts on his own.  John is cold and shivering in his clothes, but Sherlock claims the first shower, leaving John to deal with Mycroft.
Mary waves her hand flippantly. “You’re a veteran, too, John, and you like helping people. It’s not that surprising,” she says. “But why was he outside your flat?”
“You said you spent a lot of time there,” John says. “Must be important if you made a window just to look at it.”
“John, don’t you have any
He’s just on his way down the stairs when he passes Mrs. Hudson, going upstairs with two cups of tea.
John frowns, wondering what this means. He has a lot more questions, but he’s beginning to feel tired, and he yawns suddenly, covering his mouth with his hand.
“I thought you’d be lonely,” John says, sitting heavily on the bench and wiping cold sweat from his forehead. He shivers. “I certainly was.”
To John’s horror, Sherlock swivels the skull to face Mary. “Pleased to meet you,” Billy says.
Sherlock nods eagerly, and John grins.
, and John collapses on top of him, their bodies connected in a way that makes the very idea of any part of them
Sherlock sits up straight, suddenly as alert as he can be and focused on John. “Yes,” he says. “I did. It does.”
Sherlock frowns. “I wasn’t sure you’d want to talk about it,” he says. He sounds a bit unsure, and John feels himself deflate a bit. He sits down in his armchair, letting his hands press into the comforting fabric of the arms for a moment, as Sherlock stares, his empty bow still in hand, his dressing gown hanging untied over his pajamas.
to get away from them. But it has never been an option, never been a
Sherlock rolls his eyes and holds Billy out in front of him, staring at him intently. “Come on, then,” he tells him. “Let’s get ready for tonight.” He turns to John, tucking Billy under his arm. “We’ll be in 221C if you need us,” he says.
“Go on, Sherlock,” Mummy says. “Put your nutcracker under the tree. He’ll need a rest, don’t you think?”
, Mummy; he doesn’t need a rest,” Sherlock says petulantly, but when Mummy steers him over to the tree, he puts him down tenderly, and strokes his broken arm. Mummy and Mycroft have left him alone now, so he leans close and whispers, “Don’t worry, we’ll fix you up soon.”
She opens the door, and John’s overtaken by a musty smell.
She ignores him and leans forward, setting her tea down on the table. “Every time I go somewhere with John, if I don’t invite you, you show up,” she tells him.
“How do you even know who I am?” he asks.
“Alright?” John asks. He holds fingers up in front of Sherlock’s face. “How many fingers?”
“Sherlock,” John gasps, his eyes wide.
“You look beautiful, Mummy,” Sherlock says, and then blushes. He loves to see Mummy when she dresses up; she’s always elegant and beautiful and statuesque.
“When we first met, ill-intentioned spirits were taking advantage of your strong connection to the spirit world to prey on you,” he says. “The reason the spirits have been currently bothering you less is not because they have decreased in number, but because you’ve learned the value of your life, and so they no longer see you as easy prey. In turn, they bother you less, and the connection you have to other realms is less taxed, opening it up to more productive uses, such as Lestrade’s visits.”
“Do you want me to keep her address?” Sherlock asks a moment later. “Do you want to choose her? Because make no mistake about this, John. If you keep her address and you contact her, you
“I wished for you to live, John, and as a result, your power became much stronger because in order for my wish to come true, you
Mycroft nods, and Sherlock ignores the way his spine wants to straighten under the weight of Mycroft’s approval. “Not bad for an idiot,” Mycroft says.
“What if I hadn’t?” John asks, his voice rising.  He’s surprised at the way it breaks, and Sherlock seems to be as well.
As they get closer to the strange green and black mist ahead of them, he can hear voices, low murmurs that he can’t understand.  The girl is shivering but pulling insistently on his hand.  He stops, tugging her back.  “I don’t think-”
“Are you sure? I understand if you-”
“See?” Mummy says, and Sherlock sniffs again, nodding.
, but-“
“Yeah, don’t know why.  That lazy git didn’t even do anything, and he’s acting all annoyed with me for taking so long,” John says.
“Hello, Oliver,” he greets, holding his hand out for the owl, who coos at him gently but seems impatient as he rests on Sherlock’s finger, tapping one of his talons imperiously. “Yes, I know you’re in a hurry,” Sherlock tells him absently as he rushes off to the kitchen with the owl still perched on his outstretched hand, ignoring the way John is watching him.
“What’s happened?”
Mary stares at him for a moment, her eyes coated by a thin sheen of tears. Her lip quivers but she holds it steady and takes a deep breath. “I’m moving,” she tells him after a moment. “I can’t be here anymore; I’ve ruined enough lives. It’s time to go somewhere new, maybe outside of England.”
John goes straight to Sherlock’s closet and opens the door. He ignores the immaculate suits and goes to the second door inside, opening it and fearlessly stepping through.
“There’s paperwork –”
John’s tired and he doesn’t understand, but his body sags in relief, his eyes falling closed. “Sherlock,” he breathes, emotions flooding him; it wasn’t for nothing – Sherlock is
John is standing in the doorway staring at him. His eyes are wet and Sherlock can only stare.
Sherlock lies still, clinging to John, unable to move.  He knows they’re bound to stick together, but he doesn't’ care; he needs to be close to John.  It’s always like this for him.  Sex with John is not physical; it’s everything, it’s all the things he’s never believed in, it’s love and it’s metaphysical and it’s spiritual and it’s too much for him to understand.  The only thing he can understand is John, and he curls tighter, breathes in his scent, presses his head into John’s neck, reveling in the feel of John’s fingers in his hair.  His limbs feel heavy and warm, and he is settled on top of John, trusting and pliant and as close as he can possibly be and yet he wants to be closer.
John’s eyes widen and his hands shake, and Arthur turns to him. He’s different, almost translucent now. “Thank you, John. If you were my son, I’d be proud to call you my own. You reminded me what it’s like not to be lonely; I’d forgotten.”
Mummy kneels down. “There’s no spell, Sherlock,” she says firmly.
“Is that really so different?” Mycroft asks, a brow arched, and Sherlock stares at him quietly for a moment, then turns on his heel and walks towards the door.
Sherlock stares at Moriarty for a moment, disgust on his face, and then he turns to John, his eyes roving over John’s face even in his weakness. “Moriarty grants wishes,” Sherlock says. “But he’s different than I am. My magic is bound by the structure of wishes, but he’s broken that structure and calls what he does wish granting when it’s not. He doesn’t understand the importance of a balanced payment for a wish. He always takes too much, and it’s taken its toll on him. He’s insane, John, just go
He picks up a volume of Mozart sonatas. He thinks the slow movements would be a good place to start, a good transition back into real repertoire. He’s played them for years, after all, and they’re smooth and sweet and will be a good mix between warm-up and serious repertoire. He opens the sheet music but closes his eyes as soon as he plays the first note, lets himself focus on the familiar pattern of the notes under his fingers, on the position of his hands rather than the sounds he hears, on the set of his shoulders and back, on the position of his wrists, soft and yet firm.
John huffs a sigh.  “The spirit world.  Of course.  And of course some random bloke I’ve never met who’s apparently part of the spirit world is going to tell me how thick I am, right.  Listen, I don’t know you, but I can see why Sherlock calls you his archenemy.  If you’ll excuse me, I’m going home, and I’m quite sure you’re not invited,” he says, speeding up his walk.  The rain seems to pick up, and he tightens his grip on his umbrella, but the main keeps up his fast pace.
The white strands bind Sherlock’s arms and legs tightly, and his head hangs limply in front of him, his curls sagging in limp disarray. John feels fear clamor at him all over again.
“Er, sorry, what?”
“No problem,” Angelo says.  He puts the remainder of the food he’d been cooking into a takeout container, and wraps it in a bright red cloth, a yellow crescent moon bright on the outside, as John hurriedly eats his dinner.  “Take this,” he says.  “And don’t worry about paying; it’s on me.”
never would have felt that warm intimacy, never would have done
Something is different between them now; their laughter doesn’t come as naturally, their teasing is rare and careful. He doesn’t like it and he doesn’t know how to fix it, and so he sets out to make the environment as close to it was
normal, John? That’s the important question. To me, this place is normal. For most people, perhaps it’s not. How can anyone really define what’s normal and what’s not? It’s completely subjective.”
“Not yet,” Sherlock murmurs. “You must be tired, but I’m not done.” He reaches forward and runs his fingers through John’s hair, and John nearly whimpers at the sensation, so pleasant after how sick and terrified he’s felt all afternoon. He’s still shaking.
carefully, he reaches out the way he’s seen John do so many times and scoops her up.
Sherlock’s flush deepens, and he doesn’t know what to say, so he says nothing.
Sherlock giggles. “My birds are following you,” he points out.
Mycroft opens a door and John listens to his footsteps fade away before turning to Sherlock, one eyebrow raised. “I can’t believe this is Mycroft’s house,” he says, his voice conspiratorially low as he glancing around at the raised ceilings and airy windows.
the one who confirmed that your father died young, and the same with your mother, and the fact that you lived alone. Once she knew all of that, it would be very easy for her to imagine that you faced a lot of difficulties growing up; most children who lose their parents do. As for your independence, that’s also easily extrapolated from the data you gave her.”
“It’s alright,” John says quickly. “It’s… a bit brilliant, actually.”
Her demeanor changes, and she suddenly appears very serious. “An important male in your life passed away when you were very young,” she says.
“You could just throw them out,” John points out.
“Okay. Right. This is really happening,” John says.
But then he hears the door close, and Sherlock eases him up a tiny bit then sits beside him, one hand still cupping the back of John’s head.
“You could have just taught me,” John says.  His anger is fading against his will and being replaced with heady relief.
“You don’t have to make the potion tonight,” John says. “We’re both a pit pissed. Tomorrow’s Saturday; we can do it then. Why don’t we… do you want to have a drink in here? Is that alright?”
,’ I would’ve gotten it fixed up a long time ago, wouldn’t I have?”
“I see you’ve done your best for Mary,” Sherlock says. “Nicest shoes, pressed trousers, blue shirt that matches your eyes. Well done.”
“Do you want me to go get her number for you?” he asks.  He is irrationally angry for reasons he can’t fathom.
Sherlock looks up at him, hesitant, and John crawls onto the bed, keeping his eyes locked with Sherlock’s as he straddles him, shifting forward until their faces are just inches apart and propping himself up on his arms, planted on either side of Sherlock. Sherlock reaches up and cups John’s head with one hand, the other still propping himself up, and John carefully settles his weight on Sherlock’s hips, stretching his legs out, pressing them against Sherlock’s and relaxing when Sherlock doesn’t seem bothered by his weight. “Alright?” John murmurs, eyes flickering back and forth between Sherlock’s.
. Just a much more convenient flat than what I had before, really.”
“Mycroft!” Sherlock shouts, his vision blurring with tears. Mycroft crouches beside him.
Sherlock sighs and forces himself to sit up. He takes the tea John’s holding out, and watches as John goes and sits in his chair.
He wants to reach out, to touch her, to take her hand, but she’s just out of reach. He holds up his arm, his hand shaking, and she holds up hers. If he takes one more step, their fingers will touch. He can already imagine how soft her hands will be, but there’s something inside of him telling him to wait. His fingers tremble.
“Hold the arm in place, Sherlock,” Uncle Augustus says. Carefully, Sherlock looks at the edges of the broken arm and lines them up with the socket on the nutcracker’s torso, sniffling all the while, his heart filled with heavy dismay, and then he looks up at Uncle Augustus to see if he’s done it correctly.
John closes his eyes and brings his hand up to Sherlock’s neck. He lets his fingers twist into the curls there, and his heart clenches. “Tell me what to do,” he says. “Please, Sherlock.”
John thinks it’s strange that Sherlock has a no visitors rule, but then, Sherlock is strange, so it’s to be expected. He’s just telling Mary this during their lunch break when she raises an eyebrow.
After a moment, Sherlock urges John’s head up, and John is surprised to see the look of intent on Sherlock’s face.
“I’m not,” he says. “But we have to collect payment.”
help me. I know it’s probably scary to leave the forest after all this time, but it will be worth it, I promise it will.”
It’s not unlike the many mistakes he’s made recently, he thinks, first with Mary – missing so many important details about her, assuming she wouldn’t shoot him, assuming she’d purposefully spared his life – then with Magnussen.  Magnussen had been a myriad of mistakes, from his glasses, to his vaults, and even to Sherlock’s underestimation of exactly how much Magnussen knew about his pressure points. He thinks he knows why his mind has stopped working like he wants it to –
John gives him a thin smile. “Afghanistan,” he says. He hesitates, and then tilts his head a bit. “I was just going for a bit of a walk, would you like to come?”
John flushes, hoping she doesn’t notice. “I don’t know about the ‘to Sherlock’ bit, but happy to be going home sounds about right,” he says. They go up the stairs side-by-side, a bit slower than usual since they have tall stacks of paperwork in their hands. “Although Sherlock’s been less obnoxious as usual lately, so there is that,” John adds.
“Like what?” John asks. He’s always curious about Sherlock’s world, but for the first time, he’s talking to someone who seems like he might actually answer his questions, and his curiosity spikes.
John stares at her for a moment, unsure.  His thoughts feel a bit cloudy, and the only thing he can feel is empathy for this girl, for how sad and lonely and scared she is.  She pulls away from him and takes his hand, and he finds that his fingers, so much larger than hers, wrap around her hand in such a natural way that he can’t help but follow when she tugs on him.  They’re walking together, and it’s almost like family, he thinks, something he’s never really experienced before.
John hadn’t understood Sherlock when he’d lived with him the first time, not really. There were times he felt he came close, but Sherlock always managed to surprise him. This time around, though, his understanding of Sherlock is elusive at best. Sometimes, things feel normal – Sherlock shouts at crap telly while John watches him in amusement; Sherlock leaves things for Mrs. Hudson to clean up and complain about.
John’s not sure she succeeded when he remembers the stark terror he felt when Sherlock slumped over in the park, but he
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time. It was a bit lonely, to be honest, so I created Mrs. Hudson and Billy.”
“This is it, then?” John asks, brow lifted as he looks at Sherlock questioningly.
“You could at least
“A pipe fox,” Sherlock repeats.
horrible. The only reason you lasted as long as you did is because Sherlock found ways to protect you.”
When he enters the flat, though, Sherlock’s mood doesn’t seem conducive to eating. He’s lying on his back in his dressing gown, smoking his long, unusual pipe. He turns his head and looks at John when he comes in, and John feels distinctly uncomfortable and can’t help but stop and stand awkwardly under Sherlock’s gaze; Sherlock is looking at John in a calculated way and obviously seeing thousands of little facets of his character, life, and day that the average person would miss.
Sherlock doesn’t think he can reply. He presses himself closer to John, feeling oddly vulnerable, but John only holds him closer.
They walk for a while in silence, save for the murmurs of conversation they overhear from the spirits, until they’re finally close enough that John can make out the tree in the clearing. It’s still quite far ahead, but he can see it in better detail now. It’s huge, and it’s adorned with fruits that appear to be the same as the lantern John and Sherlock are holding, only they’re still attached to the tree, glowing all the same.
