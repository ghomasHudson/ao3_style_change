'As you say, poor beast - it must have been in pain: I doubt they are designed by nature to be ridden. And neither of these things would be countenanced in a novel by a sober, right-thinking publisher, to be sure. Well, my dear Holmes, it is good for once to see you in spirits at the end of a case. You have more in prospect then? There will be no yawning hiatus during which you will be bored - and at odds with your world?  I am so glad of it!'
‘I believe we should start gently: what does Freud recommend?’
‘A dear forty pounds then.’ Watson sifted powdered sugar into the punch bowl, stirred, added more ice, dipped a spoon, and tasted. ‘A thought too much lemon, perhaps. Although you do not like it too sweet, do you, Lestrade?’ He took up the ladle, and filled three glasses with the iced mixture. ‘There, what do you think?’
‘I know,’ he said. He held me gently then as if I were much younger, his arms around me in a chaste embrace. ‘I know, Sherlock. I know there was no kindness in your childhood. I can see.  I do know.’
Holmes' Narration Notes.
I did not show it to him.
‘Indeed they are, Watson, and indeed they have, but it really does not signify at the moment. Attend to me: I shall explain! So I have this tank here, full of a solution of sodium chloride, which is simply common salt which I procured from Mrs Hudson, in a saturated solution, and I have obtained a Leclanché cell to provide me with electrical energy – it is a most ingenious process in itself, to make these – and I must experiment on this also, as they are useful in telegraphy and signalling - perhaps Lestrade might like to introduce their use at the Yard – and in any case, by means of what one calls electrodes leading from the electrical cell into the tank, I am able to obtain an effusion of hydrogen  - here, let me show you: if I just light this splint and introduce to this  - ’
‘He began with a small quantity of one per cent solution by mouth, so shall we do the same? Apparently response can vary, what works on one may be perceived differently by another, and we may need to alter our doses depending on how we react.’
O'Brien, the people's champion, had been taken up and tried under the Coercion Act, for incitement to rebellion, and had been imprisoned. As previously, when he had been imprisoned for the libel against French and Cornwall, in the year eighty-four, he had been given the minimum sentence and privileges appropriate to his caste. His supposedly unjust sentence had only increased a simmering resentment of authority: the autumn, indeed had been characterised by a series of clashes between workers protesting unemployment and high prices of the bread they could barely survive upon and the police. There had been protests also against the Irish coercion acts, the imprisonment of O’Brien, and the police violence against the protestors. Stead had added and abetted the rioters: his inflammatory journalism provoked at every point.
‘But I thought you said -’ Watson began, and then stopped.
I was silent, aghast. I had no experience of the army, and had not reckoned with even the possibility of losing him. It was true, I recollected, that we had taken the Baker Street rooms for only six months, but I certainly had no thought but that we would renew our lease, and neither, I had thought, had he.
‘You would not require such devotion, no, Holmes. But it is yours, nonetheless. I do not feel – Holmes, I would like to continue this conversation. I understand -  I see that you – you wish to have done with it, but if you would grant me the opportunity to speak further? We are nearly into London however, and had better lay it by for the moment: one cannot discourse seriously in a train. When we return home I shall deal with your headache for you. Have you taken cocaine today?’

Sukey was my Grandfather’s Jack Russell Terrier. She was indeed a very pretty little animal and a ferocious ratter.
‘Then I shall show you if you would like. Wait here.’
'I have a little, a very little, money of my own. I will take nothing of James's, nothing. It shall endow a charity, and I will work for my living. If Henry and I are together, however poor, that is all I ask.'
‘We have not seen the areas of poverty,’ I pointed out. ‘And they will be there, Watson. We are mere fly-by-nights - and were you to discuss the place with a doctor who does the work you do, you would hear of a different city.’
He knew. He wanted me to tell him it was not true, but I could not. Instead, I divested myself of my coat and jacket, unbuttoned my shirt cuffs, and rolled my sleeves above my elbows. I held out my arms, baring them for his inspection. I believe my hands were quite steady, but his were not.
'In this case, truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction: I could not use that in a story without incurring the censure of every right-thinking reader - they would be writing to my publisher to complain of my unrealistic motive for the separation. And yet, there are many eccentrics amongst our nobility: there was that Duke of Portland who died nearly a decade ago now, with his underground palace beneath Welbeck Abbey, and his strange habits of seclusion - '
In the language of flowers, primroses mean 'I can't live without you'. Holmes knows this. Watson doesn't.
'I should do so,' I replied, too much absorbed with my own thoughts to give any immediate answer to his swift remonstrance about my being a little trying at times.  My breakfast lay untasted before me, and I stared at Porlock’s wretched slip of paper that lay before me: what good was it to me to send me the ciphered message without the key?
‘My dear Watson,’ I said. I could sit no longer, but rose from the table and paced up and down the room, ‘You are most long-suffering and patient of dear fellows, but if I have told you nothing in the last three days, it is because there is nothing to tell. Even now this report from Paris does not help us much.’
‘I do not know. I do not know, and will not, until I get there of course. But I am sure there will be something. The great thing is to be there, to see. To observe.’
‘He’s sleepin’ off the knock on the head someone gave him.’ Jack’s voice was grim. He had changed since I had last seen him over the Dublin Castle affair, less light hearted, and with less soft grace about him. He had not coarsened with age – he was nearing thirty now - as it is often said rent boys do; indeed if anything he looked rather finer drawn than before -  thinner -  and I wondered if he had been finding times hard. Most men on the look out for a pretty face and willing hand preferred younger boys, after all.
‘You have had a good day,’ I said, clapping him on the shoulder, ‘And I am pleased to see it, my dear fellow. It is delightful to see you keeping company with minds as sharp as your own, and with doctors as dedicated. I wish you had more chances like this, Watson, for it is what you deserve. Tell me, did you meet Koller, whose work on cocaine and the eye has been so important?’
‘So am not I sorry, Watson. Moran, you say, is a villain, and Adam Worth to my certain knowledge is one as well, albeit he is clever enough to cloak it in respectability. And since birds of a feather flock together, their reptilian companion, whoever he be, must assuredly be joined with them in some infamy or other. I must set my lads to the hunt: it will not do to lag on the track of evil.’
‘You – you raise thoughts in my mind that – that I did not – not think before John. I thought he loved her, and had forgiven her. Do you say that it is not so?’
'I have no mind to anything, John. It is the drug or nothing for me tonight: you must understand that - and I cannot bear it to be nothing. You promised that if I had to take it, you would not grumble: I, that I would not conceal it. See, I am honest with you, therefore keep to your bargain and do not berate me. If you want music, I will play for you: the cocaine does not impede me.'
'Always,' he assured me, his brow clearing. 'I will bear with you. I will wait, I promise you. But do you mean to say retire - together? And - and the gold band?'
Whether Mary Holder were complicit or no, I could see that Moran might choose to pursue her: she was a beautiful creature, dark of eye and fair of skin. I watched, teeth gritted, while Watson charmed her account of events from her with the gentle courtesy he knew so well how to employ. Sickening at length of drawing room sugar, I left him to his byplay, and betook myself to the grounds, where I very soon saw what I wanted and needed to see. When I returned, it was to sweep Watson up with me and inform the master of the house that we would be returning to London, and he might call upon me betimes in the morning for his answer to the riddle. I was surprised that Watson made no demur at being reft from the girl’s company – she really was very pretty, judged by any usual standard of beauty - and more surprised, as we travelled home on the train, by his complaint that I had had all the fun of playing at discovery in the snow, and he had been left to make commonplace conversation, ‘when I could, my dear Holmes, have been out on the hunt with you.’
"The hairstyle has nothing to do with it," he contradicted her; she giggled and patted his arm, already searching for another likely target.
The atmosphere within New Scotland Yard in the days leading up to Christmas was a strange blend of expectancy and tension. Half of the people Sherlock passed were buckling down to try and clear their workload before they took the holiday; the other half were working to prepare themselves for a tough few days of increased duty—not everyone could take the time off. Not everyone wanted to.
Greg made a beeline to the stacks of boxes that remained against the hallway wall. After a protracted effort early in the week, most of his own things had at last found suitable homes, including the mass of collected memorabilia he'd kept packed away in his crowded spare room at the old flat. He'd been receiving new packages from the States in a steady stream over the past few weeks; as he'd told Sherlock just a few days ago, he'd been spacing them out, holding back on the impulse to dig into each one the minute he brought it inside.
, Sherlock, it was a misunderstanding and your text message didn't come through 'til it was too late..."
"Keep
Most interesting, of course, was the source of their prison's scant light. The vertical line they'd seen from their seated positions marked a slight gap between the misaligned door and its frame on the hinge side, and they found that it was wide enough to peer through at a point somewhat above waist height. They took turns crouching awkwardly to squint into the light, before Greg fetched the bucket and flipped it over for a makeshift stool.
Then Sally explained.
Hearing the words startled Greg back to reality. Caught up in his thoughts, he hadn't even noticed when the phone at his ear had gone quiet. "Hello, I'm still here," he said, a little sheepishly.
Greg pulled off his scarf and the coat he wore awkwardly draped over his left side, laying them atop a stack of still-packed boxes within reach of the door. Similar piles graced every room, and he'd so far hung nothing on the walls to break up the unnerving sense of increased space.
"I'm telling you, those results of yours can't possibly be right," Sally was stubbornly repeating. "I'm inclined to believe Holmes on this one. The theory
thinking about
"Honey, I'm home," Greg called out softly to nobody, as he opened the door to his flat. For just a moment, he could imagine a response echoing down the stairs, or perhaps from the back room.
"Oh." She reached out to accept it; their fingertips brushed and lingered around the weight of the heavy charm in her palm. Greg moved aside, resting his hand gently in the small of her back as she stepped up to the door.
And they
that I wasn't the one to kill them
"All right. Go with me for a second here...imagine, if you didn't have to worry about the taxes, or the upkeep, or the utility bills. If it all boiled down to
"No, really. If I hadn't been—"
that echoed in the suddenly silent room, he moved forward and placed its tip over Greg's breastbone, dragging it slowly down the front of his shirt.
"John was telling me about the antique shops he went exploring, the last few weeks," she told them. "One in particular, he said the owner was really helpful; I thought maybe I'd go sometime next week and take a look. It would be great to find something for upstairs, to bring that bedroom together and do something with the wasted space. A pretty vanity table, or maybe a wardrobe..."
Anna tilted her head to one side in commiseration. "Well, I'm glad you took her advice. You look almost as tuckered out as you did last Tuesday, and you said you weren't even working a
"Well...it wouldn't have done to make you feel badly about yours, now would it?"
position, and only Astrid to look after him...
"Things sound better," she commented softly.
"It is. And everything's in good order, there won't be anything lacking. I haven't done it
"Not so far. Just a little wheezy."
," growled Lestrade, softly and too close to his ear. "
"Ah!" Greg dropped the overcoat he'd held slung over his elbow, but managed to turn his startled twitch into a spin within the circle of her arms. The fabric of his shirt dragged against her palms, heated by the lightly padded planes of muscle beneath. "Anna, love, there is
Greg cursed and stepped aside automatically, giving himself and John each room to move with the nearest wall angled a pace behind their backs. John dropped low and sprang in to clock the lead attacker with a surprisingly speedy uppercut—Greg managed to get in a solid punch or three, weaving and spinning to dodge the blows aimed at his face—for a handful of moments they each gave as good as they got, outnumbered and unprepared as they were. But then John took the swinging pipe to one arm before being thrown bodily into the pallets, and one of the big blokes grabbed Greg around the neck and held him in place for four punishing blows to the gut, and John's second cry of pain was unmistakable but Greg couldn't see him anymore, and when Greg landed hard on his knees, gasping, something came down forcefully on the back of his head—
"Then I suppose I can make your excuses to Greg," he conceded, smiling thinly, and drew him down for a kiss.
A gentle jostle to his knee under the table brought him out of his thoughts. "Hey."
"What about your gut, then? I don't see any stain on your shirt; do you feel any wetness? Is it a sharp or dull pain? Where's the worst of it?"
Slow and steady...something, something. ;)
"On my . . . back to Barts. Sher . . . me run out to get—"
John's tread sounded upon the stair approximately five and a half hours later, accompanied by the rustle of a plastic bag. Sherlock looked up from his laptop with a smile: he'd just finished compiling his notes into a format that Lestrade and the magistrates would be able to understand.
"All these years, and
"It's probably best to assume I've no idea what all needs doing, yeh? You just tell me what you need from me, darling, and I'll be right there with you," he assured her.
"Yes, well, it's on my short list. Of course, a shade like that is tougher to match, so I'm not sure—I mean, I'd hate to pick something out for you ladies and then find out it's impossible to get stuff like coordinating shoes, you know?"
John's clearly amused voice cut through the rapidly rising fog of their distraction. "Take a doctor's advice, and at least try to breathe once in a while, all right?"
He dipped his head in acknowledgment. "You likely would have discovered this museum on your own, sooner or later. It suits you."
!" The exclamation rang harshly between them. Greg took a breath and barreled on, surprised at his own agitation. "Can we stop talking about that case, now? God, John, I can't—I just wanna spend
"John. Just leave it." Greg hadn't meant to sound so gruff; he swallowed and tried again, more gently. "What's done is done."
"Not in?"
Greg wasn't feeling all that alert—it had been a long and frustrating day—so he decided to forego the use of a fleet car and hop on the Tube instead. Cabs were all well and good, but something about riding the trains always seemed to comfort him, especially in the slightly less hectic hours of the evening. It was like connecting with a slice of the living, breathing city, coexisting briefly with widely diverse strangers who generally shared a common sense of quiet courtesy. Every time he emerged from an Underground station, bustling along in a crowd, Greg relished the sense of peace he'd gained; it was a small thing, but the air tasted just a little sweeter.
She blinked at him, clearly startled by the offer. "Oh. Well. I do, actually—Theo is taking me to meet his family. Sort of a big deal. Thanks for inviting me, though, Sherlock. Really."
get Greg to help you out?"
he complained silently.
Anna laughed, pleased, when he reached the end of the brief tale. Before she could get more than a few words into the recap of her own day so far, someone interrupted her, and she spoke away from the phone for a moment.
"Jesus, Greg. Fine. Here goes nothing, then."
of a puzzle but to be solved?
Her handful of staff got along well, for the most part, and the usually steady stream of patients seemed happy enough with their treatment. However, her approach to scheduling and office policy was more personally tailored and flexible than most—"offbeat" might be the most flattering of the terms given Sarah's establishment, by more conventional medical professionals. John was one of three rotating GPs who handled the surgery's load in addition to Dr Sawyer, who worked slightly over full-time hours herself; between John, Dr Bressler and Dr Forsythe, there was always some wiggle room in the schedule. John wasn't the only one of them who took advantage of it, although he was likely the only one who undertook such demanding activities in his off hours.
Greg's eyes felt just a bit glassy as he suddenly began to grasp the towering mass of decisions and responsibilities ahead of him...but the smile he wore didn't falter; if anything, it became more genuine. Anna's pragmatic attention to detail would surely make up for any lack on his end of the planning equation. All he had to do was keep his head in the game, follow her lead and help her with the local logistics.
John interrupted before he could get any further. "He said
The child was released, and a strange series of incidental noises followed as he made a slightly meandering progress towards his goal. Occasionally he said or sang something mostly incomprehensible, and at least once he dropped the phone entirely.
Greg swallowed around his big bite and washed it down with a swig of coffee before answering. "Yeah, it was about one thirty, I think. I'm glad you had a nice evening here, though. I would've loved to bring you along with me, but..."
"If you like," Sherlock replied, his voice lowering into a suggestive rumble. He drew John to sit the sofa, then dropped gracefully to one knee, unlacing his shoes with long, nimble fingers.
"I'm really glad Aunt Anna met you."
Cheers - <3 M.
The far end of the room remained in deep shadow, even though the fluorescent kitchen lamp threw a hard-edged block of light that painted the silhouette of John's head onto the closed curtains behind the leather armchair; as his eyes adjusted, Sherlock's still figure on the sofa became gradually apparent. John's memory of the afternoon coloured the man's shirt blood-red, but it remained obscured by the prevailing darkness, so that the pale grey gleam of Sherlock's cheekbones and the column of his throat seemed to float above the slighter lines of his pressed hands.
to mention that I walked all the way home—five kilometres across Bristol—and then sat through a family dinner, afterwards, before Mum and Pop realised I was seriously hurt?"
John couldn't really hear any of this quieter action from where he was. As his friend concentrated intently on listening, he got to his feet and began to pace back and forth, trying to stay limber and push back the fog of fatigue that threatened to overtake him. At the far end of his fifth circuit, he turned just in time to see Greg shifting his seated position to look through the opening again.
She shook her head. "Actually, I was just wondering if you'd gotten to see the giant gilded mirror she got for her last birthday. She was trying to describe it to us, and it sounded pretty awesome."
"No, look! Here it
"Isn't that sweet. Well, happy Christmas, then."
he thought, turning his steps towards the quiet subdivision that lay east of the main road. He could sulk on Lestrade's sofa, and amuse himself snooping through his things, and likely cause quite a diverting reaction when the man returned home from work.
I measure success in terms of his grasp on the English language. Hearing him reduced to heedless, growling moans, I smile against hot skin. I can cull nouns and verbs from his tongue, just so: the knowledge is heady.
right here, clearly, John—"
Anna speared a tomato in contented silence. "Thank you," she eventually said.
"Not for a few hours, anyway. I told him we needed some time, tonight, you and I." The phone beeped in response to something John had done, and his mouth twisted to one side. "Damn. I know I had to get a new one regardless, but it would've been nice to have the old one to transfer data from! Count yourself lucky you didn't have to go phone shopping this week."
," he insisted, "no, I wanna!"
For a minute or two, Greg couldn't have fit a word in edgewise if he'd tried, but he was quite happy to listen to the energetic nine-year-old chatter on. She thanked him for his continued monthly postcards, then told him about her grandmother's dinner menu, and the Disney movie she'd been watching with Kyle, and how good the smells were in the kitchen...
He froze the memory in a still frame as John's incongruous voice pushed warmly into the scene. Surprising himself in the next instant, Sherlock wrapped the pub up safely and filed it away with deliberate care, before turning back to his friend in the present.
"No, we're not. You should've at least taken a day off..."
"Excuse me?"
matter!"
he is," he growled softly, and drew breath to call out for Sherlock—the hair on the back of Greg's neck prickled and he reached forward to lay a warning hand on John's shoulder.
-----
"Oh. Oh, my lordy. Well, that's certainly..." The man's eyes were wide, and he wrung his hands in an unconscious gesture of concern. "Of course, of course I can get you the access. Just, er, give me some time to figure out the arrangements. Would tonight at eight be okay?"
The stereo system newly added to the dining room was playing something atrocious and dated. As Sherlock entered the room, he could feel the cheerful pop music taking up residence in his molars.
somehow, even though she knew much of it was surely the excitement of her first days back and the upcoming holiday. Greg's friends—
"You're not far off," Greg laughed, "but who knows, anymore?
With that, Mycroft returned his umbrella to his hand and followed a murmuring group out into the main hall, towards the site of the auction proceedings.
"If she's somehow expecting sparkling wit from
! How are you, mate?"
he thought.
This worrying thought compelled him to break the spell of silence. Shifting his weight unconsciously onto the balls of his feet, he reached out and placed a gentle hand upon his friend's shoulder.
He hardly noticed he was scowling so deeply, until Anna murmured, "You don't have to."
In the moment of silence that followed this statement, the detective's mind whirled with questions. John's eyes were still fixed upon the sight of their two pairs of feet on the glass, and that brought up one more sudden doubt.
"Oh. Oh,
He chuckled and renewed his efforts to reach the alarm, groping blindly at the table without breaking the kiss, and she responded to the challenge by snaking a leg out from under her dislodged covers, twisting to ensnare his waist and draw him in closer.
Sherlock turned the delicate stem of the glass between his fingertips, tilting it upward to let light catch in the facets of the bowl and glow through the deep red wine. With the moving play of light, a spectrum of alternative possibilities spread instantly before his eyes, fragmentary and sparkling within a hundred blood-red rainbows:
Sherlock was beaming. And!
It was a very nice flat—that was undeniable; he wouldn't have listened to Sherlock's meddling suggestions otherwise—but it wasn't
for another day, huh? You were his friend a lot longer than I was, and I'm sure you've already thought a lot about why he did it. So. The things Andy left in this house, the ones that meant something to the two of you. You're going to keep a lot of them with you, when you move, right?"
"I'm absolutely certain."
The relative peace was soon broken by a new sound, one to which the three men seemed to be studiously avoiding giving their attention: yelling from a hallway outside the meeting room.
Anna's eyes followed a silhouette as it crossed back and forth behind light-coloured curtains. "I live here, now," she answered, wonderingly. "We're getting married."
"Ah, so, stalkers and death threats," Sherlock clarified, nodding.
"I happen to find these auction events a relaxing diversion," he replied.
It was painted a dark colour that blended into the private shadow of the entryway, but before dinner Greg had left a small lamp lit somewhere inside the flat. Soft light filtered through the pair of glass door panes, fully frosted except for an elegant criss-cross pattern, and through the square fanlight above with its painted address number standing out in silhouette.
Her jet lag was nearly conquered, at this point; the dragging fatigue was gone, leaving only a tendency to wake up at erratic hours, suddenly alert to every little noise. The not-exactly-quiet soundscape of pre-dawn London, audible here in the comfortable darkness of the bedroom, was so different than the sounds she'd woken to outside her Chicago house when she'd lived there. It was amazing to her that two large cities could feel so distinct, that the very
else!"
Sherlock basked in the warmth of the praise, but now that the puzzle was done his mind was drawn once more to his earlier concerns. Closing the now-empty takeaway container, he laced his fingers carefully together on his knees.
"Oh, dear, what's this?"
"Damn," he breathed, looking down the road in the direction the cab had driven. Had he dropped it in the seat? Thinking back, he seemed to recall having been jostled on his way off the Tube, as well... "I've lost my sodding phone," he told John.
"You've been to Sally's flat, haven't you?" The question came out casually, a meaningless aside.
"Yeah."
"And Sherlock could get a new case, tomorrow, and then you'll have to drag either Barry or Robin in anyway. Look, I know I deserve to be here."
She tilted her head, giving her eyebrows a quick bounce:
beneath his skin.
Normalcy was beginning to
Pleasant, but I've no problem returning to the dead.
Sherlock stayed for another hour or so after that; they returned to the task of sorting out boxes, or at least Lestrade did. Sherlock mainly amused himself by lounging nearby and spouting deductions about the items Lestrade unpacked, while Lestrade pretended to grumble about his not helping.
"Don't you try to downplay it," Sherlock scolded him, carefully manoeuvring John's shirt off over his right arm; the swelling of the severe contusion was only just beginning to lessen, and the bruising was extensive. "Obviously you're still in quite a bit of pain. Even if I couldn't see
"Yes, that must have made you proud," he murmured, glancing past the portly man's shoulder to fix John's location in his peripheral awareness.
"Well, after today we've got Yvonne in 'til Thursday. Maybe Jenny will get her head on straight before she comes back to work."
"Because...I can't ship it to London with the rest of my stuff?"
"What?"
His minor mission completed, he considered cutting open another box of dishes, but by then his motivation to be proactive had entirely fizzled. It was time for another pain pill, besides.
John caught his breath at hearing the outburst, curling instinctively inwards on his side without really knowing why—but before he could respond a large, cool hand found his back, a quick and tentative touch to confirm the position of his bad arm before his bedmate drew himself up close.
She was silent as she held the door for him to pass, gathering her thoughts as they crossed into the little shop. After she'd located and made her way over to study the display of souvenir musical instruments, she spoke once more, directing her soft words towards where Sherlock stood a pace behind her left shoulder. "You're right. What I'd wanted to say wasn't about Greg, or only part of it was, anyway. I wanted to thank you for becoming a friend to me. Making the decision to leave behind everyone and everything I knew, to start over far away...well, love or not, I might not have been able to bring myself to do that, without knowing I would have a friend like you here."
But the room was empty.
I'm feeling happy about the upcoming holiday weekend / bored on a super slow day at work / antsy for feedback, and so I've decided to do an unscheduled post for both this and Saving Graces today! woo!
"Yep, gotcha!" He darted forward and caught the bulky duffel as it made the turn, dragging it out towards her with a little grunt, and she pulled it aside to where John stood guard over her other luggage. Greg joined them a minute later, rolling her dark blue case along behind him. "So, we're sorry Sherlock didn't make it today," he told her as he paused to don his coat.
"You do. He told me how you used to warn him about his wife..."
"No, you wouldn't." Her smile was small and sharp, but not unkind. "I'll tell the Inspector you were by."
Our suite's gorgeous; the shower lives up to the hype; Anna's ordered up a full English and strong coffee...I can't get my mind off last night.
him—and he straightened from his scrutiny of the bin. "Doctor Watson. This is a surprise."
Still limping along with this one, very very slowly, but I figure I should try and update it at least once in a blue moon...
As it turned out, his lockpicks were unnecessary. Lestrade was obviously at home; Sherlock pursed his lips and nearly turned away, but in the end he went ahead and knocked.
I silently claim my repayment in sweet, lingering kisses.
on pounding on your door this time, Lestrade. Why aren't you at work?"
here, for her eyes only. It was only natural that she should feel closer to his memory every time she unlocked his front door, or cooked dinner on his stove.
“Holmes,” Watson said. I pulled back a little but I felt his fist catch in my hair, forcing me back down. I moaned into him as I nuzzled deeper into him.  I opened my eyes and found old white stretchmarks alongside newer red ones. I licked and kissed every inch. My hands grabbed at his love handles and my teeth nipped at his under belly,
“Indeed.” I turned the page of my book, trying to pretend that his words were not having the most profound effect on me.

John was a normal child which often played rugby with his friends in the backyard of the house. He was the best player and played with much more effort than his friends. So it was no wonder he often got bruises and scars on his knees that he always felt guilty about for his soulmate. One time at the age of twelve he crashed into the defender of the opposing team and broke his right arm. There still were some scars from the screws which had been in his arm for some weeks.
Over the years he got more scars of his soulmate. Especially at the fingertips. Maybe he or she played a sort of instrument or something like that. John was always fascinated when a new scar turned up on his skin. Sometimes he spent hours looking at them in the big mirror of the bathroom or tracing them while laying on his bed.
He just had opened his locker and was about to change his clothing when his colleague Sarah burst through the door.
The years passed and Sherlock had moved to London in the meantime. He built a life up for himself there. His drug addiction only got worse and over time he experimented more and more to keep his mind quiet. Not even that bloody silver haired detective from Scotland yard was able to stop him.
Then there was the first contact with drugs. At first, it was only pot, which soon lost its effect when Sherlock got used to it. Only a few days later he got in touch with a homeless who sold him some heroin. And finally Sherlock's mind stopped racing. He was constantly high during his teens and did not care about anyone. He soon forgot about his soulmate and the expectations he was afraid he would never be able to fulfil. The pressure faded and his mind shut down.
When he was younger, he was looking forward to meeting his soulmate like everyone else, too. He thought of them as he fell down the stairs at the age of three and cut his eyebrow. Sherlock clearly remembered the first time he got aware of the existence of this other person that seemed to run like a red thread through his life. He sometimes had had bruises of his other half. But that was it. The young boy knew nothing about them. But he could deduce some things about him. He thought that it was a boy because he had some scars on the knees which resulted from sports like American football or rugby. In these sports, the probability that it was a boy was much higher due to gender distribution than his soulmate was a girl. He just collected possible facts but it drove him crazy that he could only estimate those and had no proofs. So one day the boy broke his arm and Sherlock felt like his arm was on fire. He cried a lot and his older brother Mycroft made him a hot chocolate and comforted him through the pain.
His mother hurried and brought him the pocket mirror, she always held out to cut his hair, so he had a better look at his scar. He traced the subtle line in awe and felt sorry for his soulmate, who run through pain right now. He wanted to help them, so they did not feel pained anymore. That was the moment he decided he wanted to be a doctor one day.
John had always been in love with the idea of having a soulmate somewhere out there. That somewhere out there in the wide world was a person who loved him just the way he was, no matter what. Although he did not know them, neither gender nor nationality nor their favourite food or name, he loved them dearly.
He remembered the moment he got his first scar of his soulmate like it was yesterday. He had just turned seven and had been sitting at the counter in the kitchen drawing something with his new pencils on a blank sheet of paper, while his mother had been cooking for dinner.
John never wished for another soulmate in his life till that event. He always told himself that he would love and help them as soon as he met them. Now he wasn’t that certain anymore. His soulmate nearly killed him. His soulmate nearly killed themselves with every drug they took.The constant pain in his shoulder would remind him of this event every tday for the rest of his life. His soulmate was destroying his and their life step by step. They were also the reason why he had to quit his service for the Royal army.
It was a sudden ache just above his left eyebrow and it burned like fire. John tried to suppress a sob, but he was so shocked that he dropped his green pencil and it fell on the floor. Hot tears were running over his cheeks, when his mother turned around in shock and hurried over to him. She held him tight to her chest and caressed his blonde hair as she promised that the pain would fade away soon. She also gasped in surprise when she saw the white thin scar that divided his eyebrow into two parts.
Then it happened for the first time. John was sitting in the exam for his medical degree, when he suddenly felt a sting on his left arm. Curiously he rolled his sleeve up and had a closer look. It felt like the sting of injection. Suddenly John felt all dizzy and the paper in front of him went out of focus. He could not concentrate on the letters on the sheet anymore.
“Heavens yes. It feels like ever time I turn around I see the doctor sneaking something from the pantry.” She wiped her hands on her apron. “Not that he doesn’t need a little rounding out. It’s in fashion nowadays.”
“You must have noticed that I’m…rounder than I was last winter,” Watson said, a pink blush blooming across his chubby cheeks.
“Won’t be gone long,” I said, as I headed down the stairs and out the door. The cold autumn air hit my face, cooling the heat that had been building. I shoved my hands in my pockets and strolled down the street. I had no where to be. I had just needed to get out of the warmth of our rooms. If I could get away from the look and smell of him. He smelled like cinnamon sugar and the greenery of the mores in the northern part of our country.
“No,” I said. “I just picked them up on the way home. I noticed you didn’t finish dinner. Thought you’d want to join me.” I walked past him and sat the box on the bed.
Chapter three
“When did you want me?” I asked. Watson stopped fighting with the button and looked at me. My heart skipped. I didn’t think I’d be able to go on if he told me he didn’t think of me like that. That he was doing to because he was horny, or worse, that he was doing this as a favor to me.
“If only all your experiments meant me eating this much,” He sighed, patting his belly. “I would be a happy man.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I told him. “But let’s get you a cup of tea,”
Chapter two
“You remember that I told you that I was going to look at honey today?” I sat the basket on the table between our chairs. “Well, I have found a new poison that has a bitter taste to it. And I was wondering if you’d be willing to tell me which of these was sweetest, as to better hide the poison. Rest assured, none of these are actually poisoned.”
“Indulge me,” I said, fluttering my eyelid open. “You always tell me that you never cared for the pleasures of the flesh. Clearly, I do.” I pushed out my gut, pressing it against his fingertips. “And it does feel so good.” I smiled. “Are you going to tell me that indulgence is a bad thing?” Holmes’s tongue flickered out of his lips.
A moment later, I came up for air. I gulped oxygen, as I pulled him harder against me. “Watson,” I whispered, when I’d caught my breath. “Would you come to bed with me?”
“I think I’m going to take a nap,” he said. “If you’re right and London’s criminals only come out after dark, then I need some shut eye before we go running about.” He rubbed circles over his belly. “And it will help me digest before supper.” I nodded and headed downstairs.
After four months of watching Watson eating everything which I put in front of him, and nights of tearing myself asunder, I was pretty well satisfied that Watson enjoyed being fat. It was captivating. However, I’d still not determined if he was trying to get fatter.
When he came back down, I pulled him into me in a firm embrace. His lips found my ear.
‘The sting is quite out: nothing remains,’ he declared.
It was clear to me, as I knew it was clear to Holmes, that the young man’s affection for his friend went beyond those feeling which were considered usual: he had betrayed as much by the strong fondness, the reverence with which he spoke of him. His agitation was not the concern felt for a man who is merely one’s comrade, but the deep and dear love felt for the man whom one knows to be a soulmate: more than a brother, more than a friend. A wedded affection, such as few are gifted with, and then gifted only once in a lifetime. We spoke of the case, turning over its implications quietly and soberly, while Dodd went to his hotel room to change and refresh himself, and I consulted certain medical tomes which had not seen the light of day for a while.
‘Nor do I,’ he replied, equably enough. ‘But it is not idle talk I want with you, Holmes. I wish for a serious discussion with you, man to man, and try as you might, and I know you will, to chase me away or deflect me, I shall not yield to you. And to that end, I have telegraphed both Lestrade and Gregson to say that you are not well, and I have sent Mrs Hudson and Janey out to buy Janey a new dress length, and Mrs Hudson a new tea-kettle. And glad they were to get some respite, my friend, for you have been a very bear to all of us these last two months, and I am determined to understand your trouble and remedy it, so we can go back to living at our ease again. Now, will you tell me freely what ails you, my dear man? I am still your friend, you know, for all that you have tried to drive me away with surly answers and evil looks. Come, Holmes, will you confide in me of your own accord? I think of you as a very dear brother, and good brothers care for each other.’
'I would heal him!' She leaned forward in her eagerness, and her eyes were full of tears. 'I would be his friend. I - I love him.'
I rose as he did, and we met by the door. I clasped his hand in mine, and it rested there easily, unafraid. He was not trembling, though I was all a-quiver.
The ‘widow of Windsor’ was Victoria of course. The ‘wool-sack’ sits under the Lord Chancellor’s chair as a reminder that the wealth of England was built on wool.
‘I am beginning to believe that we are encompassed around with enemies,’ he replied solemnly. ‘Sit, Sherlock, and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit with me. The club has a remarkable fine amontillado, which I believe you will enjoy. I have investigated, in your absence, the affair your friend dubbed ‘the Amateur Mendicant Society.’ I can assure you, my dear brother, that they are, as you suspected, neither Amateurs, nor Mendicants, but professional, and very well-paid spies. Among their number are the young men Andrew Grant and Herbert Coulton, who attempted to instigate the common bounce against Dr Watson. Professor Moriarty is not, I regret to say, of the same – ah – persuasion that you are, and I am, but he does not scruple to employ people who are. He is using them to entrap, particularly, members of parliament with a taste for more arcane practices than are usual, and having done so, he uses the threat of blackmail – generally issued by our friend Mr Milverton – to extort from them not only money but information. Incidentally, the policeman, Kavanagh – your young girl’s follower – was imprisoned in January this year for a month, for blackmailing a young prostitute and assaulting her. He is another one fee’d by our generous Professor - he is a bad lot, Kavanagh, and Lestrade and I have ensured he has been broke from the force for handling stolen goods; indeed after his imprisonment he should never have been allowed back in. So you see, Sherlock, I have been busy on your behalf.’
‘Then you shall tell me that story if you want to, Holmes, and I will listen. I do not like to think of you lonely. As your doctor . . .’
‘Stead bought her? Procured her himself? Did he indeed do so? Then I agree it is indefensible. Where is the child now?’
'I wish you will not.'
, I believe, just before Parliament is prorogued. I would dearly like to know what amendments there have been to it, my dear fellow, but of course Burns Gibson could not tell me in a telegram: even this must have cost him some shillings already. I am in hopes that they extend the protections to as many children as possible in as many circumstances. Oh, I am eager to return home now. I must know what is in our victory, and whether it indeed answers all our hopes.’
The storm broke on Sunday night with perfect torrents of rain. I flung my window wide, and let the breeze wash out every hint of the days’ foul heat. Towards dawn I fell into an uneasy sleep, from which I roused, not refreshed, but at least more determined to make progress in my investigation. I called first at the Post Office, of course, and to my delight there was a letter endorsed to my alias in Watson’s neat, distinctive hand as well as a telegram. I took them at once to the Zoological Garden, where I found a bench that was not too damp to sit upon and read them.
‘Save y’breath until you see him,’ he advised me, and opened the door.
‘I see,’ Watson ran his fingers through the fine, brownish-grey earth, lifted them to his nose, and sniffed. ‘I assume he derives the name from the Greek, ‘dynamos’, if it is indeed so powerful. Yet it seems unobjectionable enough like this, the liquid and the solid both. And what do you intend to do to this substance when you have mixed it?’
'And then? Thank you, Janey, good girl.' I intercepted the coffee pot and poured for John, adding the sugar and cream as I knew he liked it. Our hands touched again as I gave it to him. 'Here, my dear fellow, drink this. Go on!'
I finished my ham and eggs, accepted and lit the pipe Watson had prepared for me and settled down into my chair.
‘Really, Sherlock, I had not thought you so qualmish: very well I shall not say all that I intended. But it is not my intention to live celibate all my life, and I am concerned about the future for those of our – I say our, for you cannot deceive me, brother – of our kind. And when the monarch of this country espouses a bourgeois morality that stifles even as it censures, I will not simply stand by and allow it to happen. How is your doctor, by the way?’
‘I am stifling. If I sit here all evening with nothing to do, I shall go mad. My brain is tearing itself to pieces.’
“Was Mr. Hudson a well-padded man?” I asked.
“Watson has never been interested in fashion,” I said, taking a drink.
“After you,” I said. I waited until his back was turned to stand up. I hoped my arousal would be gone, by the time we reached the dinner table, but Watson wise soft ass was just as erotic as his front.
“You didn’t say anything,” I said, looking up into his warm eyes. The hazy look was gone. His eyes were clear and hungry.
“Watson, you can’t do this to me,” he whispered, shuddering. I stepped closer to him. Not stopping until my belly was squished against him. His hands had slipped from my waist and were kneading my backside. I had no idea how big it was until I felt him hold it in his hands.
“Why?” he asked around another bit of donut. “Why would you want to watch?”
Chapter one
“My dear Watson,” I pushed myself into a sitting position. Some of his hair had fallen into his face. I brushed it away.  “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to.” Watson’s cheeks flamed red.
And, it's for Greg...I've always had a soft spot. Sherlock knows.
But John
-----
"It's my arm," he panted. "I'm—okay. I'm fine." Soon his figure lurched into view; he staggered over and awkwardly used one shoulder against the wall to lever himself down beside Greg.
"I figured you needed your space—the opportunity to come around to things in your own time—but it's getting too frustrating to watch you bumble along. I've got to take matters into my own hands."
When Lestrade brought over two mugs, perching wide-legged on his own stool, Sherlock's tongue was still frozen. Images of John sitting in his place flickered before his eyes, the green ceramic morphing into pint glasses and back again.
Thankfully, she spotted what she was looking for before her situation became much more urgent. Greg hadn't seen her coming, this time, to intercept her. He stood facing away towards a row of seating, blocking the view to his conversation partner with his broad shoulders as he gestured with a paper coffee cup. Even from a distance, the alert ease of his stance and the distinctive colour of his hair set him easily apart from the milling crowds in the terminal.
They switched places, Greg taking over at the wok as Anna passed him the first few ingredients. "You're giving this a lot of thought, already, aren't you love?"

landscape.
The implications were becoming clearer with every step he took, but John was afraid to continue studying his vague feeling of discontent. He'd spent so long convincing himself that simply having
Sherlock understood the level of sentiment involved. He recalled the surprised disappointment in Lestrade's eyes, when Sherlock had failed in this effort five years before; it was only natural, given the importance Lestrade had clearly come to place on this particular murder.
How was I so
Shaking himself back into the present, Sherlock returned his focus to the words issuing from Brewster's lips, just in time to provide an adequately engaged response to the man's recitation of his family news.
A year ago, if anyone had tried to tell him that this would be the state of things, he'd have laughed in their face. And even after the game-changing events in Chicago, every move John had made for months had felt like a tightrope act.
John bristled at the choice of words. He was no
"Before you say it, love," he said as he pushed into the kitchen, "yes, I've had a bit more than I intended. And no, they don't need me at the surgery tomorrow, I already checked."
"It's been years, now. But, yes." He'd visited a few times during the more unfettered years of his young adulthood, taking advantage of the free admission to spend time among the various stimulating exhibits. And later on, after he'd found his calling in detective work... "One case I solved for a private client involved a number of unidentified and mixed avian bones. I spent an afternoon or two here for comparative examination. It's quite a well-maintained collection."
A tiny spark of warmth flared somewhere in Anna's chest; yes, she'd asked both Molly and Sally to be her bridesmaids, and she knew them to be friends. But her decision to include them in the wedding had been more for Greg's benefit, really—asking any but her very nearest and dearest to travel overseas had seemed unworkable, and it would have been unfair to ask her fiancé to leave his own close friends out for the sake of an even representation. He'd already narrowed the field to three; that was few enough.
"Is that so?" she responded, matching his light tone and wide smile.
one was the only time I ever saw him crack. Turned out he'd had two younger sisters who died around that age. Carbon monoxide from a dodgy furnace, I gather, but Jim was the one who'd come home and found 'em." Greg grimaced, remembering. "He pushed our team—and himself—harder than he'd ever done, on this case, trying to prove it was Mitchell Beaux."
, of course, but he received the benefits of it without a second thought, leaving John to repeat his silent mantra of gratitude as he followed along.
Sherlock recognised the first recording within four bars: a Vivaldi recorder concerto, performed beautifully by Michaela Petri. His teeth immediately ceased grinding together; he stood at the far wall of the room, focused idly on a framed photograph of Anna with what were presumably her late husband and her middle sibling, as the gentle ebb and flow of the music soothed his nerves. For he
Enjoying her coffee, and its palliative effect on her very mild hangover, Anna sat perched on one of the stools at the peninsula. It had quickly become one of her favourite spots in the new flat. For one thing, the vantage point offered a truly lovely view of her intended's backside while he worked near the stove, clad in a comfortable jumper and jeans.

accident-prone.
is wrong with me," he said into the air, strapping his sling into place with rough, jerky movements and throwing himself back onto his pillows.
This thought was foremost in his mind as he stepped up to the first bin and began skimming titles. It was hardly a shock that he'd begun associating practically everything he saw with one member or another of the Holmes family, considering how focused he was on his goal. So when he glanced up to see a tall, well-dressed man ahead of him, John automatically compared his prim posture and dark ginger hair to that of Mycroft. The man was facing away from John, holding up a leather-bound volume and peering along its edge; he even carried an umbrella, hooked fussily beside the suit jacket he held draped over one forearm...
"Family at Christmas, huh? That'll be a nice change for you, you usually haunt the Yard like Marley's ghost through Boxing Day."
Greg's fears, today? Valid, apparently, though thankfully unrealised.
Pursing his lips, he blinked twice. "Lunch?"
take a day off! Surely, you remember that." Not that
As expected, returning to work on Monday was a trial. Greg lingered as long as he could, and Anna seemed just as reluctant to see him go; the routine of starting their day in a shared home was still new and special, in a way it hadn't been while Anna was merely a long-term visitor in his shabby, lived-in little flat. When he finally dragged himself out the door, he was too late for the Tube; Greg had to hail a cab at the main road in order to arrive at New Scotland Yard in time for his mandatory morning meeting.

He felt relieved, somewhat, at having brought himself to confide in Lestrade. He hadn't at all planned to do so, of course. In the sixteen months since he'd returned from his exile—from his Hunt, as he and John had agreed to term it—his tendency towards high emotion, both positive and negative, had become exponentially less predictable. Most of that centred around John and occurred in his presence, which was certainly to be expected, and in those instances it was generally acceptable. But when John himself was the source of upset, and was neither available nor suitable to approach with such problems, Sherlock usually pushed those feelings mercilessly inwards. It rarely occurred to him to do otherwise...yet he
Anna choked a little on her own mouthful. "You want me to rent it out to someone.
"No, I only came up to Homicide my last year as a DC, and he was weeks away from retirement by then."
Dipping his head towards the other man in a conspiratorial gesture, but keeping a heartfelt expression on his face, Sherlock continued, "This investigation is in the interest of a friend of ours; she's been drawn against her will into the matter of a recent murder in Bridgeport, and I have reason to believe her safety is at issue. The more quickly I can track down the group behind this, the better."
They kept up a light chatter through the rest of the half-hour ride from Heathrow, and when the cabbie finally pulled to a stop, Anna peered out the window with great interest. She'd seen this building from the outside, just once, but it looked entirely unfamiliar in the dark. The tree at the kerb—a poplar, she assumed, judging by the name of the little one-way street—was bare of leaves. Its spreading branches broke up the thin light of a streetlamp opposite, leaving jagged stripes of darkness across deep red brick and white pilasters.
"Tedious, but not bad," John answered, smiling tiredly as he climbed the stairs. "Which I'm sure you already know."
Sherlock huffed a sigh that seemed both frustrated and smug as John acquiesced. Once they were up and moving, he kept hold of John's free hand and led him straight through the kitchen, absently shoving the lab goggles from the top of his head and dropping them on the table as they passed.
I always wondered about my boys. Honestly, I still worry about Mykey: such a

Eventually, Greg became aware of pain.
There was a little star pencilled in beside the date on John's calendar, as there was beside every third Monday.
"John," he sighed. "Tell me you've got something? I should have eaten supper hours ago."
"Oh! That'd actually be great, I was hoping we'd have the chance to do that soon. Where did we put those measurements we took a few weeks ago, did you keep them?"
Finally, Anna blinked hard, banishing the beginnings of wistful tears, and cleared her throat. "You should go get some sleep, Greg. We'll talk again soon, okay?"
"Excuse me?"
Greg texts again—this time a request. It might lead nowhere, but I sense his excitement and smile. Just one more autopsy before I can confirm his hunch.

"Bet they're gone. Maybe they won't come back."

Finally, Lestrade seemed to take pity on him; he bobbed his head in a gesture to the door. "Let's go downstairs. I'll put the kettle on."

"That is

to be?"
Tension rippled through Sherlock's low growl, but the man lay stiffly unmoving. "I'm angry at an idiot delinquent who likes stealing mobile phones to sell them! I'm upset that Sally won't let me take part in her interrogations! I'm frustrated that Lestrade has been shut up in his office for three days, burying himself in paperwork to make up for having thrown a wrench into the case he's worked a month on, and that the trigger-happy imbeciles on the response squad managed to kill or seriously injure
, Anna thought, noting the hint of tightness around his eyes, obvious to her with the webcam set at this close angle.

I pat Sherlock's shoulder and stand, making a fast escape. Can't let him deduce me, now.
"Because, love, this is important. And I wanted us to be alone for it." He reached into his pocket and pulled out a key ring: not his own, but the little pewter TARDIS she'd used that summer. "I believe this is yours. Why don't you do the honours?"

"A few minutes? More like two. Maybe less," Anna commented, suddenly quizzical. "Why in the world did you keep the taxi, when it was this short of a walk? It's not
At home, their private routine was truly pleasant. John had told Sarah that they'd had no major arguments in months, and it was true. What bickering there was generally centred over the most minor incidents: a misplaced petri dish, a mess left in the bath, a tactless observation here and there. John's temper had been a bit short just lately, admittedly—but he knew that wasn't really Sherlock's fault. Sherlock never let anything escalate beyond the level of mild snappishness, anymore, on his end of the equation.
"Do I?"
Their discussion moved on aimlessly through a number of topics, including the newly hatched plans to save the Chicago house from being sold. Although Greg reacted positively to the news, Anna could tell his attention wasn't really focused.
"Oh, I gotta go, Uncle Ryan wants to talk to you now—Hey Uncle Greg?"
Thanks for your patience!
The man on the other end laughed, a smooth and resonant boom, and with that she knew exactly who'd called her. "Thank goodness! I asked Fran for the number earlier, but it'd be just my luck if I copied it wrong."
. Mm—" He cut himself off with a kiss, bringing his free hand up to cup her jaw tenderly.
he wondered, shifting on his seat.
Anna looked back and forth between them, wondering what she was missing. Something wasn't making sense.
Liz rested her hips against the edge of the worktop, crossing her ankles casually, and fixed her friend with an expectant stare made only slightly comical by the smear of marshmallow on one cheek. When Anna entirely failed to follow, she rolled her eyes and smirked.
She gave John a quick hug and snagged her handbag from his care, and the three of them started off towards the bustling claims hall. When she began to release Greg's hand to detour into the loo, he pulled her back for one fast, searing kiss before letting her go.
Sighing, he straightened at last and turned towards the street.
"Extenuating circumstances, yeh? We'll only have to worry about this the once," Greg chuckled, snagging the end of the scarf that poked from the outer pocket of her handbag and deftly arranging it around her neck. "Chilly out there tonight, love. Right, I think we're ready to go! Lead the way, John..."
John had
"Hey, John, wait up," Greg called, sidestepping a few oncoming nurses and orderlies and half-jogging to overtake him.
he wondered.
"Yeah, but I needed to get in his drawers." She gestured matter-of-factly with her chin to indicate her full arms. "Filing. Someone has to do it, and he's frankly awful at it!"
"Anna! Get in here and take this honey-tongued darling off my hands, before I decide to emigrate! ...Goodnight, Greg."
"Could be nothing. Could be he's in the loo."
The box he'd chosen turned out to be mostly filled with clothing, and he groped idly through it for anything more solid while the phone rang at his ear. His call connected just as he pulled a gold-embossed photo album into his lap.
Perhaps half an hour later, Greg was chewing on the inside of one cheek, struggling to compose a comment that described Sally's quick temper in decidedly mild terms, when the door was flung open with a startling bang.
Greg smirked a little at the sudden onslaught of doctorly questioning. "I've had worse, don't think I'm bleeding, pretty much dull all over, and none of it holds a damn candle to my shoulder."

I was given charge of the pot, years ago. I have an unimpeachable reputation, when it comes to arbitration—everyone knew I wouldn't cheat.

Tonight, I could see right away what he admired. John's a fine, upstanding man, so protective and careful.
John was trying to keep a level head about things, but his emotions kept running away with him. Every rational assessment of their situation morphed halfway through into nauseated self-blame.
The last bright rays of the afternoon's sunlight slanted across the dining room table, catching tiny sparkling specks in their path. Anna found herself captivated; she felt oddly numb, as if large wheels were turning within her mind, moving thoughts too obscure for her to parse...
grumbled Sherlock silently in his absent partner's direction as he stormed down into the first Tube station he encountered.
A fresh set of giggles rose from out of sight, as Anna stood in the kitchen opening the evening's second bottle of wine. Even though she was missing the first part of whatever story Molly was telling, she couldn't help smiling; ever since she'd begun to get to know Sally Donovan, she'd got the distinct sense that making the sergeant laugh was always to be counted as a victory. And hearing her genuinely
"I agree."
"Oh, it's waited quite long enough. You'll want this, Lestrade."
Waking up in London took a little getting used to.
Greg accepted the slip of paper being brandished before his face. "Okay, calm down. It's no problem. We know where he's gone; he can't have left all that long ago..."
"What?"
But Sherlock would know.
"The crime in question is over twelve years old. Age may diminish its urgency, but never its importance. And before you argue that setting aside my work for a few hours would have no ill consequences...in this case, you're entirely correct. If I wasn't busy with this, however, I

"No, everyone's here, but dinner won't be for at least an hour and a half yet. I'm glad you called—yes, Mom, it's Greg. I'll be right back, okay? Yeah—so, how did work go?"
"Where are we on the Belgian situation?"
John's response was soft, and held more understanding than it had any real right to. "Ah."
"It took you another whole year, then? Dealing with those people?"
And the light in his eyes whenever Sherlock spoke—the way they turned, each a magnet pulled to the other's true north—the care in every word...

Finally, they took a turn through the nearest of the museum's multiple gardens, starkly picturesque despite its winter dormancy. At the end of their brief walk, Anna drew him back inside to the café. They seated themselves at a small table; Sherlock cradled a squat porcelain cup of tea between his chilled hands, while Anna worked on demolishing a green salad.
Nodding, Sherlock turned away to gaze out the window behind Greg's desk. "Some time ago. I took the liberty of asking Sally to retrieve the case file for you, she'll bring it by shortly."
"That's great," was his warm response, and then his attention was on Sherlock, too. "Sticking around, Sherlock? Come in, let me fix you a cuppa."
"Quiet out there," Greg murmured next.

Visible through the crack was a sliver of a windowless room, in what appeared to be the lower level of a very old building. The walls had been given a plaster treatment, but the dark stone behind it was still visible near the low ceiling. Something in the homely lack of décor, and the scattering of folding chairs and banquet tables, gave John the distinct impression of a community centre or rarely used meeting hall. The modernisation efforts—at least in the basement—seemed to have been limited to a brief effort in the seventies or eighties, judging by the style of the hanging light fixtures. Long fluorescent bulbs flickered almost imperceptibly above severely yellowed plastic panels, lending a sallow, unhealthy tint to the deserted space.
"Ri-ight. Where are you?"
, see? I knew it! He narrowed down the particulate origin while I was gone, after all, and didn't fucking bother waiting for me. Here's the address, right here!"
"We're fine," he managed, deliberately stilling restless hands. "Things are good. Very good."
Greg was the first one of them to gather his wits about him to speak. "So, you can thank Sally for sending me home; I nearly missed making this call."
which were avoided, cleanly, without fuss or unnecessary discussion. It was no hardship, certainly.
"Getting serious, huh?" Anna asked; she exchanged a twinkling glance with Molly as she provided her with a refill.
John caught up with him, then; Sherlock saw the fair hair in his peripheral vision as his friend moved to stand quietly beside him. Blinking sightlessly at the sparks of sun on the water, he murmured the only explanation he could manage. "I was someone else, when I was here."
Sherlock's hand on his shoulder woke him, and drew him muzzily down the hall to the bedroom. No words were spoken as they shed their clothing, John clumsy and dazed, Sherlock oddly pliant and tactile. They crawled into a close embrace, face to face, and John's last awareness was of a soothing hand, stroking his back.
planned to tell Anna what had happened!
She snorted and stopped beside her desk to grab a pile of files and loose pages. "Aren't we all? But you're the only one I've ever known who considers it a pastime to loiter about the Yard." As she spoke, she continued on with her armload through the unlocked door of Lestrade's office, and Sherlock followed her.
it, now. 'S just the two of us, here; just you and me, Sherlock."
Anna twisted her mouth sceptically at the strange metaphor, but did as she was told, flopping down with a huff onto the sofa cushion Liz patted.
," he told her, gesturing at the glass proudly as if presenting an example of his own handiwork.
. God, baby, you keep that up and you're not even going to have the opportunity to cook it, French or not."
It wouldn't be illogical, certainly, to add another one.
The notion of searching Lestrade's cluttered, lamp-lit office within his Mind Palace rose up in response to his musings, but Sherlock dismissed it almost immediately. If something hidden there might give clues to things he'd deleted...well, there was surely a reason for such deletions in the first place. Sherlock knew better than to second-guess his own decisions, even when he couldn't remember making them.
Liz let the idea sink in briefly, then spoke again. "If you're so upset about the idea of selling the house, why are you doing it?"
Greg's face in the dim light lacked the crusted smears of blood John knew were gracing his own, but it appeared craggy with exhaustion and pain nonetheless. He had been entirely content to let John take "first watch," as it were, seating himself on the cold floor beside the door.
Truly, Anna was not brilliant but certainly intelligent, not exceptional but undeniably interesting—all in all, a surprising and wholly unexpected source of comfort.
They rode down to the quiet hall adjacent to the morgue, tracing familiar steps to Sherlock's favourite lab in companionable silence. Greg glanced aside through the small window of the morgue office's door as they passed, on the off chance he might see Molly. Her schedule tended to be erratic, but tonight her thickset colleague's blond head was bent over the intake desk. Greg smothered the tiny flash of disappointment, instead hoping she was enjoying a pleasant night off. Perhaps she and Simon were on a date.
"Oof, you're
On the ride across town, Greg did his best to calm his friend's temper, but John was in no mood to be soothed. Despite Greg's efforts, John was still actively seething when their cab pulled up to the darkened and downtrodden Southfields commercial strip indicated on Sherlock's hastily scrawled note.
Within Sally's prolonged silence, he could see a whole series of arguments being thought up and discarded; he leaned gingerly back in his chair, careful of the sling he wore, and met her eyes calmly while he waited.
Their conversation took a few dips back into serious territory, but Sherlock had given clear license to skirt the subject of his brief distress for both their sakes, and Lestrade was happy to comply, for the most part. Instead, Lestrade chatted about details of Anna's fast-approaching relocation; Sherlock explained how to determine the quality of a prospective Thai restaurant by analysis of its takeaway menus; they discussed similarities between a recent embezzlement case and one they'd resolved together in 2009, in enthusiastic tones many men (and even Lestrade, surely) would reserve for talk about their favourite football clubs.
"You asked for it," he huffed happily, wriggling a bit.
He sat in the front window booth of a small delicatessen, his back to the wall, letting his gaze wander over the old, framed photographs adorning the walls as John stood in line to order. The glass at his left side was badly insulated; it threw a cool breeze across his left hand and up into the sleeve of his coat. The proprietors of the establishment seemed to be compensating for inadequate glazing by keeping their heat on high blast: he was torn between overheating in his coat and shivering, but he paid it little mind. It was a fitting physical sensation to match the off-kilter state of his thoughts.

his friend speak of childhood holidays in France. On at least two occasions, Greg's fourth or fifth shot of scotch had gone down following fluently spoken toasts. John had no problem believing that following the fast words of these men was a tall order—repeating phrases learnt from family was one thing, full fluency quite another, and Greg had already confessed to difficulty besides—but he
"But he never got to take the guy down," Sally finished. "He probably never even knew for sure whether he was right."
"Goodnight," he returned with a grin; as Anna's voice approached in the background, he finally cracked open his bottle, entirely relieved to have turned the conversation around.
Determined John, caring, competent, his eyes fierce. Sherlock: every emotion walled tight, but looking somehow vulnerable nonetheless.
"I will, I promise! You know, Mrs Faber, I expect I'll be dreaming of your cooking tonight; I know exactly what a fantastic meal I'm missing out on."
"Gratitude?" She grabbed one of the small chairs, settling herself with legs crossed. "We're always happy to shut the book on a case, but you don't exactly shower him with recognition for these older ones."
Straightening in the seat, he tilted his head to study his handiwork. "Did you say something?" he asked at last.
Two seconds passed, three; Lestrade's hand remained clasped firmly over Sherlock's forearm until Sherlock released a breath and stopped trying to get through.
An email from Sherlock; I could hardly believe my eyes. Asking a favour? From

thought John,
reasonable emotional reflex.
"Okay there?"
When Sherlock had contacted Anna to arrange their private rendezvous, she'd given him free rein to pick out an activity for them to undertake together. After some deliberation, he had decided on a visit to the Horniman Museum, lesser-known in the tourist rota: neither massive nor centrally located, but both entertaining and academically worthy. Sherlock had chosen it with a view to its varied subject matter; the galleries here quite neatly found an intersection between his and Anna's fairly divergent interests.
Greg made a strangled sound of utter frustration mingled with panic, and she laughed, apologetic.
Sherlock guided him into the bedroom and began to help him off with the sling, frowning in unnecessary concentration. "I said, I'm not
"Until Friday," was the crisp reply, accompanied by a firm handshake. "Good day, John."
"I didn't think to ask," he said, not looking up from the action of his whisk. "French toast is okay, yes?"
Neither of them had invited the other out to speak about it in person, not since the Wednesday after it had happened. That night, John had listened to Greg confessing how he'd lied to his fiancée—not exactly a
He laughed softly, shaking his head; clearly, there was no way Sherlock would fail to see his brother's hand in the choice of this present.
Anna stole up close to his side and tucked herself in under his arm, resting her head over his heartbeat while he finished confirming the arrangements. Though he half-expected her to chime in with a greeting before the end of the call, she stayed silent until he rang off.
Most of the people here were idiots, of course, but they were nevertheless a force of good in the city Sherlock loved.
When Greg returned from work that night, the hush inside his flat was nearly overpowering. Pocketing his keys, he stood just inside the door for a long minute, taking stock of the unfamiliar surroundings.
"Hey there," Lestrade grinned, catching Anna's hand and pulling her close for a kiss on the cheek. "Did you have a nice day, then, love?"
"Well, look at yourself! You're still wearing the T-shirt you slept in, and the trousers you put on this morning are the ones you spilled bleach on last month. Surely you aren't planning on going out in public like that."
for me," Sherlock snapped fretfully, guiding him out into the hallway. "How could you and Lestrade
"Better not be Oxfam again. It was hell getting off their list after Dimmock convinced me to donate," Greg muttered.
"I'm in London, right now. Year-end meetings; boring shite I get roped into when all the higher execs leave the country for holiday. But I have a few hours free for lunch. Thought I'd take a chance, and see if you were available."
Anna didn't think to question him; it had taken at least a couple minutes to ride on to the restaurant in their taxi earlier, but these quiet residential streets ran in only one direction. Greg walked with his arm over her shoulders, sheltering her from the intermittent bite of the chill breeze, and it seemed no time at all before they were back in front of the flat with the big, dry hydrangea in its garden.
"No kidding. Now you see why the boss gets
"I noticed your daughter has returned to school. I presume she's getting along well?"
The voice that replied, after a moment's hesitation, was vaguely familiar but definitely not Greg's: "Er. I'm calling for Anna—have I misdialled?"
We're a lot alike, me and Greg.
She slowed her steps deliberately, putting effort into preventing her rolling carry-on luggage and bulky handbag from tipping and making noise. As she approached, a fragment of conversation became audible.
Over the course of the next three weeks, things had slowly returned to something generally approximating normal. A few minor cases had come and gone, two private clients from the website and one through the Yard; Sherlock had grumbled at being asked to assist Alan Dimmock, but after Sally had taken him aside for a brief chat he'd looked over the evidence willingly enough. He'd even managed to solve the case with a minimum of disparaging comments thrown the way of the young DI.

"Yes, of course. I'm fine," he answered, the words muted behind barely-moving lips.
Greg swallowed, and tried to put on a reassuringly confident smile as he stirred. Surely, nearly four months was plenty of time to get everything sorted out? Though now that Anna mentioned it, his memory of the lead-up to his first wedding was mostly a blank...
is a difficult catch, indeed!"
"Sally, you are aware that I'm fully capable of getting up and fetching a coffee for myself?"
"What happened...you know you weren't to blame, kiddo."
Sherlock stood frozen at her back, utterly unable to formulate a response. When Anna finally turned and looked, he shook himself and spluttered weakly, "This is intolerable. I'll be outside, when you've finished shopping."
The answer: adorably. With eggs.
"Sherlock," he breathed, as the man dropped to his knees and leaned over him.
John isn't sure what to make of Sherlock, in the weeks after. It's hard to say what's different, between them; ultimately, he may find that the real change lies within himself...
"Oh! Oh my god. I'm sorry, I thought—
Even muffled into Greg's wrist, his short scream of agony was loud enough to echo in the still cellar. It entirely drowned out John's simultaneous groan, at utilising the abused and swollen muscles of his own arm.
It was half past five on Sunday, and Greg stood in the kitchen, chopping vegetables for a stir-fry to the rhythm of his cheerful, mostly tuneless whistling. The interruption of his ringing phone sent a high note trailing off like a cartoon character falling from a cliff; craning his head around, he saw that Anna hadn't yet returned from the loo, so he couldn't ask for an extra hand...
Sherlock turned the new idea over in his mind. It didn't quite jibe with what he'd seen of John's relationship with her...but what if John was actively attempting to encourage Sherlock to develop a stronger bond with her? That could make sense, Sherlock supposed,
He stood in thought, letting the other two men converse softly behind him. Lestrade removed himself into the kitchen with an offer of wine just as Sherlock turned away from the photograph and moved to seat himself. He adjusted the crimson place mat, straightening it to align properly with the table edge; as its texture played across his outstretched fingertips, a stream of deductions followed automatically.
After another minute, he reported, "He's sending Blondy and the skinny guy out. Now he's making a phone call..."
we're talking about here."
centrepiece design today, in the window of the florist I pass on my way to my Mum's. It made me think of you, Anna; it had these beautiful organza ribbons, trailing out all over, in a sort of dusty plum colour. Wasn't that something like what you said you were thinking of?"
"But if either of us were allowed to have anything stronger, we'd be at the Duke right now. Tea's fine, John." He settled himself into the black leather armchair with a sigh, tipping his head up and closing his eyes while his host bumped around in the kitchen.
They lapsed into companionable silence again; Sherlock stepped over to the window, clasping his hands behind his back as he peered idly down towards the narrow street behind the building. The rolling clang of the cabinet drawer shoving closed, a minute or two later, nearly obscured the quiet chime of the phone in his coat pocket, but he heard and retrieved it.
"Gladly," he grinned, stepping out of the kitchen and around to put himself fully within her reach. The kiss was as sweet as it was enticing, but he didn't linger long before pulling back, slipping away from her hands at his waist. "Can't let mine burn. And yours is getting cold, love," he chided her in response to her disappointed hum.
John snapped his gaze back into focus at the contact, and he looked down as if realising all over again that he stood on a glass floor, one hundred and three stories up. Sherlock meant to speak at once, but he was still watching that amazing, intriguing face—and it was shifting more clearly now as John registered his presence, changing magnificently and

When Greg's phone began to ring, it was a relief. He stood, replacing the useless file with its brethren on the table, and escaped to the hallway before answering.

"Well, no—I mean, I did want him to be here, but..."
He glanced over the page, front and back; seeing nothing further of interest, he returned it to her with a small grunt of agreement. "Not terribly worrisome."
Sherlock knew Lestrade hadn't meant the idea literally—hardly possible, with a disorganised, pedestrian mind such as his. But Sherlock already had a room of doors, eleven metal and twenty-seven wood: unpleasant experiences he'd now made a promise never to delete, shut tightly away where they would cause the least possible harm.
