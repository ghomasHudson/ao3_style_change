“I was petrified to move. And the room,” she said shakily, “the room became so cold- I could see my breath.”
No one berated Sam for not telling them right away about Dean, which was a relief to Sam- just one extra thing he would not have been able to handle. Jody did insist on a memorial, though, which was why Sam found himself on the front steps of Jody’s cabin in Sioux Falls, holding a boxed pie.
“Well, let’s hope we don’t run into them anytime soon.”
I wanted the ending to seem like an episode with a mystery still to solve. How are Dean and Sam connected? Will they ever find the anomaly? Please leave comments if you enjoyed, or even if you didn't enjoy. Is it worth writing a sequel????? Let me know.
Dean wakes up in an unfamiliar place.
“What the fu- “, Dean exclaimed out loud.
“You’re right. I only have myself to blame. Go mingle,” Jody left to the kitchen.
It continued throughout the night- hugs and beer and pie and holding back tears. Though that last one was unsuccessful. Everyone at some point lost the strength to fight them back. Donna was holding Jody; Jody had one arm around Claire; Claire had an arm around Alex. The link went on.
Yeah, distractions were good.
“Dean? What are we doing here?” Castiel narrowed his eyes.
Suddenly, Sam was pushed forward by the force of a bear hug from behind.
A shooting star fell, its tail followed in a dim glow against the dark canvas.
Flushed, Castiel excused himself to the restroom.
He pulled the car to the curb in front of a strip of shops, which included a hardware store, clothing outlet, a smoke shop, and a convenience store. Castiel stood on the sidewalk, exasperated, waiting for Dean with shopping bags in both hands.
That was not at all what Dean was expecting. It took him by such surprise, he burst out laughing.
Castiel swiftly turned the flashlight off. They kneeled to the ground, behind a few grave markers, and kept silent. But it was too late. Male voices grew louder- boisterous. The group of men from the Peppermint Club followed must have followed them, itching for a fight.
growing weaker and weaker…”
f Sam were not concentrating on the map spread out before him, he would have seen the tail end of a shooting star peer out through some gray clouds. If Sam weren’t so fixated on the idea of justice and retribution by way of hunting and slaughtering a nest of vampires, he would have seen the 1957 Chevy Impala drive passed the two hunters hunched over the hood of Baby.
Then time went on, the days passed by and Sam was less comforted by it. He left the bunker for good then. So many metaphorical ghosts roamed those halls. There was only so much pain Sam could relive again and again.
Castiel smiled timidly, “Another time then.”
“Dean,” Castiel laughed.
They slowly made their way through the hospital’s halls, passing a few doctors and nurses along the way. They all were so busy; the two tall men were able to exit the building without causing anyone to take notice. Everything had such an ‘old-timey’ feel too it- from the paint chipping on the walls, to the clothes and hairstyles of the visitors, the nurses.
he discomfort Dean felt under the glare of the beady-eyed bartender at the beginning of the night did not ease up, and he had a sneaking suspicion he knew why. Dean and Castiel had not exactly been blending in with the crowd that surrounded them. Women in flowing wool skirts and hair so high they reached the ceiling. Men in sportscoats or blazers with elbow patches. And Dean and Cas so focused on each other.
A ‘scrunch’ sound.  The screeee noise lowered in volume until it stopped completely and disappeared. The light dimmed until all there was left was the dim light from the sun.
The door to the room was opened, thankfully, and he called out, “Nurse! A little help here!”
The elder hunter turned. “How’s things with Kaia?” Ahh, the tables have turned.
The minutes ticked by. Dean redirected their conversation to lighter topics- watching the dancing couples, the silly fashions. Those men kept glaring at the two of them. He had a sneaking suspicion why too- he was sitting rather close to Cas. Their knees were so close, they practically touched. If he just shifted slightly closer, his right knee could be right in between Castiel’s. He blushed from the thought. Thankfully, the lighting in the lounge was dim, and Cas’s attention was on the pretty dancers.
“Sam!” Jody exclaimed. “Oh, look at you. Get in here!” She moved aside, holding the door open to let Sam pass through. He shook himself from the excess raindrops falling in his eyes.
“I’ll be coming home. Wait for me….”
“Then it dies,” Dean finished. “It dies and we’re stuck here.” Castiel nodded.
“It’s a ghost, Cas!” Dean exclaimed.
“Hi, Sam. We need to talk.”
Castiel found the grave marker for Arthur Munchin shockingly easy and they got to work digging up the coffin right away.
Castiel was crouched in a similar position parallel to Dean, the newly dug hole in between. They both shared a look and stood at the same time, catching the men off guard.
And just when Dean thought he could breathe easy again, Castiel leaned over and pressed full lips to soft ones. It was so chaste and so quick. Dean could almost imagine it never happened if not for the ghost of warm breath across his cheek. Castiel slowly stepped back, his eyes steadfastly focused on the door.
“Okay, so what? You can’t use your mojo? You’re mojo-free man? Your limp? Flaccid? Impotent?  You- “
“Sam?! Well, ain’t that a son of a bitch.” Dean exclaimed.
“Why didn’t you meet me?” Dean asked. Castiel turned to face the hunter. “Cas, why did I have to hear from Bobby that Jack saved you?”
Dean straightened up, trying to get his enthusiasm in check. “You said there was a spike, right? The trail sent us right to the house, and stopped? That is not a coincidence, Cas.”
“Well,” she gulped. “We’ve been renovating the second floor, so it has just been an unruly mess up there. You see, we’ve just moved in a week ago and we have only gotten to settling everything on the first floor. Anyway, I was going through some of the boxes filled with kitchenware when I heard Hubert start to shout from the second floor. Only, it sounded as if he was having an argument with someone. Well, my goodness, I thought. Sweet Billy here was sitting just a short distance from where I stood, practicing his alphabet- the dear boy. I thought, ‘oh, how silly could I be’ when I heard another voice shout back.”
Sed’s shout alerted the rest of the group.
Castiel nodded. “Yes. Jack has been able to fix most of them. Unfortunately, by the time we realized how close one was to your location, we were too late. You had already disappeared. It seems these storms created a sort of time rift. For a while, I thought I had lost you.”
“Being back alive,” Dean reflected resting his forearms on the shovel, “I missed a lot. Stuff I didn’t pay attention to when I was alive before. Stuff I should have taken advantage of before, ya know. But this… I did not miss this.”
They both breathed sighs of relief.  Seven headless bodies surrounded them. Two more were outside. It was a gory horror show. The two hunters were covered in blood, not theirs, and guts and other things Sam did not want to consider at the moment. They were lucky to come away with only bruises.
Dean stared at the closed door and took a sip of his now-warm beer. What Castiel said kept floating in his head- “Knowing you has changed me. The things we’ve shared…. I love you. I love all of you”.
A silent moment passed. Dean felt his heartbeat quicken out of panic. Lightning crashed with resounding clarity right on top of Baby’s pristine hood, lighting up the car like a disco ball. Dean shut his eyes tightly from the fractals of light crisscrossing all around him. The music played on.
When Bobby mentioned Cas, Dean was thrilled to know that his best friend was not rotting away being tormented in “super-hell”.  He figured Jack must have rescued him from his own eternal damnation and immediately put him back to work in restoring heaven to all its full glory. The fact that the little angel nerd had a hand in rebuilding this paradise was like he was still there, even if he wasn’t physically there. Though it would have been nice to have a bigger “welcome home” party waiting for him. It would have been nice to see him, especially after….
Dean breathed a sigh of relief for a job well done. The ghost of an unrestful spirit can rest once again. Castiel stepped towards his friend, sharing in the respite.
The song playing on stage ended with applause. “Thank you, gentlemen and gentle ladies,” the wool-covered vocalist said to the crowd.  “We are ‘Jaybird and the Squealers’ and we hope you are all having a bitchin’ time. We are gonna kick it into full swing for you now. I hope you all have your dancin’ shoes ready.” He counted the band down, “and a 1, and 2 and a…”
“Okay. Well, if it’s bleeding, it’s alive?”
Dean didn’t have a very good view of the hallway. Even after leaning forward as much as his aching body would allow, he could only see white wall with white blurs of people passing by the room. At least he wasn’t alone, he thought. The sound of stretchers whizzed by followed by a few scrambling footsteps.
“Slow?” she scoffed.
“What is it, Dean?”
Dean inwardly began to panic. This was turning into a chick-flick moment, and he could not deal with it just yet. He cleared his throat and looked up avoiding Castiel’s stare (which was uber fuckin’ tricky). He slid the cassette back and turned to pick a song from the jukebox.
“Sam- how’s he doing?”
“So, there’s no way to get back to heaven?” Castiel nodded in acknowledgement. “Well, this just keeps getting better and better. Got any good news?” Dean finished with hope in his tone.
“Dean,” Castiel said getting Dean’s attention. “The trail stopped. There’s an energy spike here.” They both looked toward the woman.
Castiel squinted. “The grace of heaven is dissipating in you. Dean, I can only speculate as to why that is. Unfortunately, these questions only Jack can fully answer, including those you have of Sam. This anomaly is frustratingly blocking my connection with the universe and Jack.”
After overhearing the widow’s account of her husband’s death, the two scrambled, albeit quietly, away from the scene and down a deserted alley. Dean immediately started rambling about hunts and ghosts and monsters, like a child being told they were going to Disneyland. He felt the fire in his belly- a hunt! A good, solid ghost hunt. It’s been so long since Dean felt that excitement to follow a case, work a lead, gank the bad thing and save a life.
“Dean,” Castiel tilted his head in confusion, “what is ‘backseat bingo’?”
“Hey, Sam” Alex walked into the hallway and reached up to hug him. “Here, I’ll take that.” The young dark-haired girl took Sam’s coat. She started to walk away towards one of the bedrooms when Jody stopped her.
The elder hunter nodded and let the notes of “Dream a Little Dream of Me” take over.
“No Zeppelin?” Castiel asked cluelessly.
“What’s with the ‘tude, man?”
Sam gave him a proper hunter’s funeral. He found an isolated spot in Kansas, a spot that Dean would have picked out. He chopped the wood, wrapped the body, and placed it on the pyre. Before lighting the fire, he prayed to Jack so he would not be alone, not really.
“It just happened so fast. I-I I’m in shock,” the woman sniffled.
Dean finally looked up at the town that surrounded them. Women in long wool skirts; men with cardigans and neutral-colored shirts with button-down collars passed by them on the sidewalk. And the hats. So many hates. Some of the people even gave him odd looks (Dean was not quite sure why- two men standing super close to each other in an obviously heated and private conversation. What’s so strange about that in the 1950’s?).
Dean leaned over the front seat to unlatch the side door for the angel who quickly placed the bags in the backseat, then climbed into the passenger side.
“Is it a road trip game?”
“Hold it under your tongue.” She started writing whatever nurses wrote on the form. “Do you recall anything about the accident?”
The thing about it all, was that none of it was old-fashioned. Sure, to Dean it was. But this was all new to everyone else. It was like stepping into a black and white Twilight Zone episode. Dean was just relieved he wasn’t alone in this one.
Castiel sighed searching for the right words. “I suppose I wasn’t ready.”
“What,” Castiel asked distractedly.
This decade was starting to grow on the hunter. From the cars, to the clothes, to the quaint shops. He was even beginning to enjoy the music. Though it was not what he preferred (it was not hard rock), it was not half bad. It was better than millennial pop music anyway. And there was Elvis. He could dig Elvis.
In all his short life, the hunter has never felt this free- free of burden, free of that weight he constantly carried with him, free of so much pain and loss. He somehow knew his baby brother was living a good life back on earth. He deserved it. And seeing Bobby again- HIS Bobby, not some alternate universe Bobby- left Dean feeling happier than he could remember.
If Dean noticed anything else at that moment, he would have seen a blushing smile finally formed on the nurse’s otherwise stern face. But he was quite oblivious as he too was in complete and utter awe of the devilishly handsome figure that now stood in the doorway.
Donna had that big, sweet smile on her face. “Sam! Oh, boy, is it good to see ya.”
“And you didn’t see anyone?”
“I should, um. You should get some rest then.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, his obvious tell of nerves kicking in.
“Don’t get me wrong. It is damn good to see you, man. But what the hell is going on? One minute, I’m driving down some no-name road, then a lightning storm hits me, and I wake up in the whitest hospital room I have ever seen.”
When he came to once more, he was lying in a metal hospital bed.
After resolving the issue with “Chuck”, saving the world (family, friends, loved ones), after Jack fixed everything, Sam and Dean were supposed to be able to live a life that they wanted-free to make their own choices. And Dean tried.  Without his best friend by his side, though, Dean was having a hard time readjusting to the new “normal”.
From the back of the room, a short man with cropped dark hair lifted a beer towards Sam in recognition. “Is that Cole Trenton?” Sam mumbled more to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean should not have been surprised that Castiel choked. He practically scarfed down all his burger and fries. Since this whole thing began, the angel was behaving oddly human. Castiel did say that the anomaly was blocking his angelic senses, but to what degree?
Dean looked up to see the half-smile form on the angel’s face. He couldn’t help but smile back as indiscernibly nervous as he was. The tension getting too much for him, Dean stood and gave his friend a gentle smack on the shoulder. The hunter crossed the threshold of the door and turned once he got to the other side- back to safer territory.
The angel was relatively quiet for most of the drive. Dean pulled into a crowded parking lot outside of a lounge bar. A bright-lit sign that read “Peppermint Club” glittered in their direction.
“Okay,” Dean murmured. He sighed before continuing, “I might’ve found something. An Arthur Munchin, born and raised in 4207 Maple Drive, was a naval officer. Got a couple medals of honor for his service, retired in 1952. One morning, he tried changing a light bulb, slipped on the toilet seat, smashed his head against the side of the porcelain throne and died. Ooh,” Dean hissed, “that’s embarrassing. It says here that he’s buried at Oak Hill Cemetery. That’s gotta be our ghost.” Dean looked up to see Castiel still glaring far off to the right. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say the angel wasn’t listening. But Dean did know better. “Somethin’ on your mind?”
“No, it isn’t, Sam. But it will be,” Garth said knowingly. “If you need anything…”
He refused to let this second chance at love slip him by.
The rain was heavy and cold, and Sam was soaked through just from the jog between the parked Impala and the door. He hopped foot to foot waiting for someone to answer his knock. He glanced down to the soggy boxed pie and hoped it was still edible.
“Ahh!”
Dean rolled his eyes and put the gun aside. “Never mind.”
It was kind of cute.
Dean and Castiel shared a look and sped up to follow. They found it a few blocks later. It had stopped in front of an old Victorian home. A police car sat in front of the ambulance. As Dean stepped closer to the scene, two EMT’s were pushing a gurney through the front door and to the back of the truck. A sheet covered the body that laid there. They slowly and carefully raised the gurney onto the truck.
“The energy I told you about. We, Jack and I, have a theory that the loss of this energy is…” Castiel paused and looked at Dean. “This energy is the anomaly’s life force- it’s bleeding out. Slowly, but every time it loses some of its essence, it grows weaker.”
“Yea well, it’s strange. After I died and I was in heaven, I missed him, but I knew he was okay. He didn’t need me anymore and I was alright with it. But being back on earth now, being alive again, which by the way I still don’t get. I don’t know, it’s like that self-assured feeling, that inner peace or whatever, it’s like it’s slowly leaving me.”
Dean lifted the pants from the outreached pile- beige pleated and from the looks of it clean (thankfully). They were definitely not something Dean would voluntarily wear. But it’s not like he had much of a choice.  “So, 1958, huh?” Dean looked to Castiel who answered with a shrug.
“Drink slowly,” Dean remarked to his friend. “I don’t think he likes us,” referring to the bartender who was already preoccupied with other customers.
“Thank you, nurse. I can take it from here”.
Fletch (asshat #1) was the biggest of the three- taller than Dean (taller than Sam), squared shoulders and broad chest. Sed (asshat #3) was the shortest. Asshat #2 stood closer to Dean. He leered at Castiel with a wink. Dean was going to kick his ass.
Castiel responded with a turn of his head.
“I’ve got ya, Sam.” Claire breathed out.
He put on his best flirtatious smile. “Hi.”
“Due to this…interference… I have no way of contacting Jack. And Jack in turn has no way of contacting us.”
Beautiful.
“Which I specifically told you not to without back-up. Remember, if something can go wrong…”
Castiel stood behind Arthur Munchin, the pry bar held tightly in his hands. He swung the iron bar through the ghost. Arthur Munchin disappeared, his spiritual essence going out like a puff of smoke. Dean quickly lit the match when the ghost reappeared angrier than before. Dean dropped the lighted match onto the opened casket, burning the remains of Arthur Munchin.
After observing the bullies, Dean inwardly smirked. This was going to be a piece of cake.
From that heart-wrenching moment back in the bunker, Dean had not been able to get that eloquent declaration of love out of his head. No one had ever spoken with such deep devotion for him before. He honestly did not believe that anyone could love him like that. And then Castiel disappeared, seemingly forever, leaving Dean alone and lost. He never fully processed all that was said.
“Of course,” Castiel shook his head as if from a trance. “And we will need transport to the cemetery.”
(See the end of the chapter for
What he wanted to say was “What gave it away?”. But judging by her expression, Dean thought better of it and kept his mouth shut. He couldn’t help the eye roll, though, as she kept her eyes locked onto the clipboard in her hand.
Sam smiled warmly. “Oh no, you’re not the only one. A study even said that 1% of the population is asexual.”
“Hello everyone, I hope you’re all doing well today,” Charlie began. “So, today, before we open the discussion for everyone to share their thoughts, Stevie has prepared a slide show they are going to present to you about different sexual orientations, some of them some of which may be less familiar and which you may not have heard about often. Stevie, are you ready?”
Cas blushed at the compliment. Dean was right; he had said out loud exactly what Cas was thinking.
The next player did the same, and the last one added six chips too, but Cas could see he didn’t like that. The dealer revealed the last card. Some of the players made little noises, but Dean stayed silent. Cas wondered whether that was good for him or not.
Jack smiled.
Dean, who had been playing with his spoon, raised his head, looking at him, smiling shyly, a shade of relief painted on his face.
He took a big breath, and then put a big smile on his face, walking towards the group of children.
“You’ll see, Cas, our meetings are pretty informal. I usually moderate the debates as the President, but other than that… Everyone can share something if they want, an experience, a thought they had… The idea is to provide a safe place for young LGBT students to talk.”
Cas felt nauseous. Here they were again, making suggestive comments. He felt very uncomfortable, and couldn’t wait for Balthazar to arrive so that they could go back to their place. Luckily, his roommate didn’t take too long getting out of the bar.
“Do you want me to spoil it for you?”
The woman nodded.
The angel jumped, surprised, spilling a bowl full of dough in the process. Crossing Dean's gaze and lowering his eyes immediately, he even looked a little scared, as if he has been caught doing something wrong.
What now? What did that mean?
“What? Why? Did you just leave Cas alone on Christmas Eve because you thought you didn’t deserve to be happy with him?”
Here, it was even easier, because he was talking about something he liked, something he knew, something he was sure of. He was not hesitant. And he almost forgot he was talking to
He violently pushed his plate away, frustrated, and pressed his elbows against the table, supporting his head and massaging his temples. His thoughts were spiraling. He knew he wasn’t being rational, but he couldn’t help it. His choice of clothes wasn’t that important. Objectively, he knew that. However, right at this moment, it seemed to be one of the most crucial decisions of his life. He tried to breathe.
Everything was great, really. Cas was feeling really comfortable and he was having a good time. They were talking, mainly about the cookies, but also sharing some stories with each other. It was fun. It was nice. However, it was just… friendly. And nothing more. No flirting AT ALL. Not even a wink.
“Obviously”
Touché. Dean was looking for something to answer, but Cas kept going. "It seems to be the only option I have to see you, lately".
“I am. I hope you’re not too tired yourself…”
He was angry at himself for allowing himself to be affected by the situation, especially when he had promised himself not to do so. It wasn’t healthy. He would see Dean every week for the entire year. He couldn’t let things escalate this way, or it would be unbearable.
“Oh, I…”
They didn’t talk much during the ride. Dean had put some rock music on, and he was beating out the rhythm of the song with his fingers on the wheel. He looked happy, and Cas was happy to see him that way. Soon, Dean parked the car.
Cas sounded so concerned, and Dean couldn’t bear it, because he knew he didn’t deserve it.
“Wait, Cas… I get that you thought I could be angry about it - even though, I can assure you, I am not - but why…why did you use this dating app if you knew what you were feeling towards me was different?”
“Aromanticism describes someone who doesn’t feel romantic attraction towards other people. Asexuality means someone who doesn’t feel sexual attraction towards other people. You can be aromantic and not asexual, or asexual and not aromantic. Or both.”
“Hey there buddy, come to the main room with me!”
She paused for a moment, letting him process the information.
Cas nodded, still very dazed. He didn’t want to think. If Dean was here, taking care of him… Did it mean that he was okay with what Cas had said? Or that he hadn’t heard him? Maybe he didn’t understand that Cas had meant him? He shut down his thoughts, focusing on the hot water that was running on his shoulders. Once he was done, he put on comfy clothes and breathed, trying to prepare himself to face Dean.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted him.
“Dean, I care a lot about you, and when I first talked about you, my coworkers asked if you were my partner, or at least if I was in love with you, because they said how I described you wasn’t “platonic” He really used air quotes, a gesture that Dean found quite adorable. “But then they made those… jokes, those sexual jokes, and…”
Could someone die from happiness? Cas felt as if his heart could explode from joy.
Dean smiled, apparently pleased that Cas was complimenting his baking skills.
Cas finally stepped aside reluctantly and stared at him, not believing what he just heard:
Slowly, Dean turned to face Cas. He carefully looked at him, trying to notice whether something had changed, but no. Cas was the same as usually; or at least, the same as he had been since he became human. Not that human Cas was much different from when he was still an angel, his personality hadn’t changed. However, he was breathing now. He was eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and going to the bathroom, and showering. He was getting tired now, and was sometimes yawning when it was late. But, according to Dean, the most significant change was that now Cas wasn’t constantly wearing the same outfit anymore. He still had his suit and his trench coat, of course, and when they were going out, it was his favorite outfit, the one he was the most confident and comfortable in. However, when he was at the bunker, he dressed more casually, especially at night – because, of course, no one sleeps with dress pants and a tie – and borrowed a few of Dean and Sam’s clothes (mostly Dean’s, though; most of Sam’s clothes were too big for Cas. They also bought new clothes for him, but for some reason, he liked to sleep in Dean’s worn-out shirts.
“I know,” Dean smiled.
Dean blushed lightly – it was one of the first times that Cas saw him blush. But it was only fair, given the number of times Dean had made Cas blush.
“It’s nice to know you’re not alone, right?” Charlie smiled.
"Don't hate it until you try it!" Cas protested.
“Oh, yes, I did meet one man in real life, and he did try to convince me to…”
“What strategy now?” Dean frowned, surprised.
“Dean?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said neutrally, trying to pretend that last night never happened.
Sam and Eileen had left the bunker for a week. Eileen’s parents were dead, but she still had an aunt and some cousins in Detroit, who invited her for Christmas. A little bit anxious at the idea of seeing them again on her own after her “death”, she asked Sam if he wanted to come with her. The hunter hesitated a little: he wanted to go with Eileen, but at the same time, he didn’t want to let his brother alone for Christmas. But Cas was with him in the bunker, and even though Dean and him had some arguments lately, they seemed to be better these days. At least, they were talking to each other. Plus, maybe, it would be the occasion for the two of them to finally have a good talk, to finally say all the things they needed to, but never said before. Actually, maybe leaving them alone for a week at Christmas wouldn’t be a bad idea. Moreover, Dean never celebrated Christmas a lot, it wasn’t as if they had big family traditions for the holidays… Therefore, he told Eileen he would come with her, and they left the bunker on the 23rd of December, planning to stop for the night on their way.
. It had nothing to do with him. He shouldn't expect too much from this “non-date,” otherwise he would be disappointed. But still...
That was true; Cas had tried many new things the last few months, and every time he had been scared. It always turned out fine, but it was always terrifying because he couldn’t plan how new experiences would go, and whether it would be a good or a bad choice… And with Dean, everything was new, but he wasn’t scared. For the first time, he even felt a very new feeling – a form of self-confidence – as he leaned in and kissed Dean’s cheek first, and then his lips.
Cas ignored the attack to ask her, curiously: “How do you know him?”
“You must be Balthazar's roommate?”
"Uh... The thing is, I'm actually tired from all this driving, so I think I'll go straight to bed"
“That sounds wonderful, Dean!”
"Excuse me?"
brush against each other's shoulders, lightly touch each other's hands picking up a utensil at the same time... For someone as flirty and as forward as Dean, it was a golden opportunity to try something, and Cas wanted to make their relationship move forward.
“Wait, where are you going, Dean?”
“It’s okay if you… do that again,” Cas said.
By the end of the day, hungry, he decided to go cook something in the kitchen. The room was a complete mess; there was flour everywhere, a smell of burning, eggs shells on the counter, and, in the middle of everything, Castiel, only wearing his shirt, his trench coat – covered with flour – on a chair, with his suit jacket. He was standing with his back to Dean, and seemed deeply focused on a book on the table in front of him, a whisk in his right hand.
Balthazar shook his head dramatically. “You’re definitely too serious. You’re wasting the best years of your life!”
“Balt? Do you know if Dean… Are Dean and Lisa…” he began.
” Meg had said.
“Wow, now that was a day, wasn’t it? You were awesome, Cas!”
“Yes, I was actually just thinking about the fact that I had to talk to him about the organization of the next poker evening, so yeah, it would definitely be better if I could wait for him. If you don’t mind, of course!”
“Okay, I’m gonna leave now,” Balthazar said, clearing his throat.
Cas looked at him, taken aback. Dean had said that in his “normal voice,” as if those last five minutes hadn’t even happened. What did that mean? Seeing his confused gaze, Dean smiled and stared patiently at him, a little bit curious, as if he was wondering whether Cas would say something or not.
“Hey, I can watch my mouth when I’m with them, I can stay professional!”
Cas ignored him while going back to his room, holding his glass of orange juice. These kinds of conversations between Balthazar and him were a regular thing, and he knew his friend was only joking, and that he was respecting his life choices, even if he decided to live differently. Still, this time, it left Cas thoughtful. He had told Balthazar that he was perfectly happy with his life. Was he, though? Sure, he was doing fine, doing what he was expected to do by the teachers, by his parents, going to class, writing essays, doing readings… But was he really happy?
He had offered out of politeness, but he had absolutely no desire to clean up at that very moment. He just wanted to go back to his room and enjoy the two hours of quiet he had left before the house would be invaded by a dozen partying students.
“Because I don’t see the point! It’s great that you find it helpful, I’m happy for you and your friends, but that’s not the kind of society for someone like me!”
He turned to Cas again.
Even when writing text messages, Dean managed to use winking emojis… Cas could completely picture Dean really winking directly at him.
He had attached a picture that took Cas’ breath away. It was a selfie. Cas couldn’t really see the background, but he guessed that Dean was in a kitchen. He was holding the phone in one hand and a rolling pin on the other. He was wearing an apron – Cas never would have thought Dean was the kind of guy who wore an apron when he was cooking! – and he had flour on his face and in his hair. And above all, he was beaming. He looked gorgeous, and adorable. Cas stared at the picture for several minutes, unable to look away. He didn’t even know what to answer. He didn’t have the words. But Dean had asked him a question, and was probably expecting an answer.
Cas looked genuinly confused.
It was also Dean who had been helping Cas to shave, two times a week. Cas was uncomfortable whenever a sharp object was near his throat, the flashback of Metatron taking away his grace haunting him, but for some reason, he trusted Dean enough to let him do it. He had tried it himself once, a few days after becoming human, but he was clumsy, not yet mastering his hands well, and he had cut himself under the chin. Blood had beaded and rolled down his throat, and Cas had let out a little cry, letting the razor slip. Dean, who was busy running a machine in the laundry room right next to the bathroom, had rushed over. Seeing Cas so vulnerable, so lost, had come as a shock to him, and he had decided that from now on, he would help Cas for as long as necessary. As he was taking care of Cas’ cut, murmuring soothing words to calm him down, he had promised him he would stay with him and help him to learn how to shave from now on, so that Cas wouldn’t be in a similar situation again. Except that now, the very idea of standing so close to Cas seemed impossible.
“Thank you.”
The woman was organizing some chairs with the help of two students while another woman was connecting a computer to the projector. Cas stood there, a little ill-at-ease, unsure of what he was supposed to do. Was he supposed to offer to help? They would probably find him rude if he didn’t. But he was early. Maybe he was bothering them while they were preparing for the meeting, and he should keep a low profile?
Dean was tired of thinking. The guy seemed friendly. He was here with two girls and a man who were looking at him, expectantly.
with him didn’t explain why he downloaded a dating app. Dean frowned.
During the ride, they mostly organized the next week’s session. For the first “official” session, as they didn’t know the children well yet, they decided that they wouldn’t divide the group, but would stay together and both help with homework, and then organize the “fun” activity. Since the children really liked the pie, Cas suggested that they organize a baking workshop. They could start with that, and then do homework while the pies were in the oven.
Balthazar had been quite calm that week. He didn’t mention Dean again, but why would he have? It probably meant, Cas thought, that Dean didn’t tell Balthazar that he was Cas’ partner for the volunteering program. Which meant that Cas wasn’t important to Dean. Which meant that Dean shouldn’t be that important to Cas. In a way, maybe it was for the best. At least Cas knew where he stood. He was now convinced he shouldn’t expect anything from Dean. And that strengthened him in his resolutions. Dean would only be an acquaintance, perhaps a friend, but nothing more.
The barista gave him an amused look. “Sure thing. That’ll be seven dollars.”
“Hey Cas! You’re ready?”
Jody rolled her eyes. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”
“Who could blame him, he was in good company…” April chuckled.
“Everything okay, Cas?”
Dean opened his mouth, but no sound came out of it.
“Hey,” he whispered quietly, straightening up a little on the couch, “let’s get to bed, okay?”
“Christmas cookie? Seriously?”.
“Sounds exhausting.”
“But you
“You okay, Cas?”
“Well, welcome! I hope you’ll enjoy it!”
Dean grabbed the remote to pause the episode, stirred and glanced at Cas, who was still curled against him – somehow their proximity hadn’t shocked Balthazar when he had arrived, probably because he was used to seeing them together now.
“Of course I can, who do you think I am,” Cas started to defend himself, but stopped when he saw Dean laughing.
However, as he approached the bathroom, he heard Sam's voice.
Dean shook his head negatively.
“What, you mean that for once, you’re taking some initiative for an academic topic? Wow, what happened to you?”
“Come on, how is that possible? Balthazar is your best friend and he never taught you how to play?”
“Dean, wait!”
Balthazar heard him closing the door, and he raised his head, smiling.
“You okay?” he asked, a little bit worried.
“If you want… But this conversation isn’t over, Clarence!”
“That’s…that’s okay, Cas”, he quickly said to comfort him.
“That’s true, you both study biology! I had no idea you two were friends, though! It’s nice to see you both.”
He nodded.
“Of course, Dean, I’m following you,” he simply, calmly, but sadly, nodded.
“Okay, calm down, now," he said to himself. He had rarely felt so flustered before. His thoughts were racing and he couldn’t control them, but they were all replaying the scenes from the evening: Dean in the kitchen, asking how he was feeling after he hit his head. Dean, saying his hair looked good on him. Dean, so close to him, asking him whether Cas wanted him to teach him how to play. Dean, winking before he left the kitchen. And finally, an over-confident, grinning Dean, winning the game, and winking at him before celebrating with the others, almost as if he was dedicating his victory to him. Which, of course, he wasn’t. It was only in Castiel’s mind. Cas needed to calm down; it didn’t mean anything. He would probably never see Dean again anyway. Which, maybe, wasn’t so bad, considering how agitated and confused that encounter had left Cas. But deep down he also felt a very new and unknown warm, pleasant feeling. It gradually spread through his mind and body as he calmed down. He fell asleep thinking about Dean’s green eyes, and his deep, confident, comforting gaze.
He met Meg at the library to compare his notes from the last biochemistry lecture with her (or more specifically, let her complete her notes with his, but he didn’t mind). Then they had a math tutorial. Meg spent more time texting than listening to the teaching assistant, and the look on her face was unusually soft. Cas assumed she was probably talking to the boy she was dating; he must be very special to keep Meg hooked that way! Usually, she got quickly tired of the boys she agreed to go on a date with. However, he didn’t ask her any questions; if she wanted to share it with him, she would do it herself.
Dean’s friends were going to an after-game party, but Dean had looked at Cas and decided:
Cas quickly looked around, trying to keep calm and to analyze the situation. All the other children were really noisy, commenting on the situation, some of them starting to seriously worry, feeling that something was wrong. Jack was crying, still holding his knee, but if he just had fallen on the ground, the chances that he had only slightly scratched his skin were high.
Dean did not know any Tom, he continued to scrutinize him warily.
actually angry at me!” said a warm voice behind him.
“Better than I expected. You helped me, yesterday, with your text messages, but… I couldn’t help but be very anxious about it. I’m a very anxious person,” he confessed.
“But… But… All these sex jokes you make? That time, at the bar? You said I was “hot”? And you went back home with Lisa? And you flirting all the time, and the reputation you have…?”
Cas had given him a bright smile, silently thanking him.
Cas was so sure that Dean would come up with an excuse to leave, that he stood gaping, speechless for a few seconds.
“I hope you’ll like the tea," he said, to change the topic of conversation.
“Exactly,” Cas approved.
“I didn’t know you wanted to celebrate Christmas, Cas. But you were right, Christmas is not only celebrating Jesus’s birth. We don’t have to make it about God. We can just do something nice on our own. Now, I’m not the best Christmas traditions teacher… But let’s buy some stuffs to cook some cookies, eggnog and pie.”
“No, no, no, we can’t stop now! We don’t know whether Dr. Sexy will succeed with the heart surgery he is performing on that child! We literally can’t stop!”
“Hey, Cas. I think we have a lot to talk about.”
“Really? Yeah, that’s surprising, because I would definitely have remembered if I had already seen you before!”
He nodded again, letting his knee – that he was still holding – go. Cas gently pulled the pants up along his leg. Indeed, the skin was slightly scratched and bleeding a little, but Cas could see without any problem that the wound was superficial. He offered Jack a reassuring smile.
Balthazar raised his hands as a sign of innocence.
“Rea… really?”
Cas could still see Dean, leaving the kitchen the night they met, being all flirty andover-confident, presumptuously offering:
Sure, going to pre-med and then to med school wouldn’t be easy; the selection process would be harsh, and he would have to work a lot. It would be a very stressful time. But on the other hand, it felt grounding and comforting, to have a plan. He was even more worried about his future, his adult life, than about his exams, so knowing that he knew what he wanted to do felt good. Besides, he was lucky enough to have wealthy parents who could afford to pay his tuition fees; he didn’t need to worry about a student loan or part-time job, and could dedicate himself entirely to his studies. He could buy all the study materials he could possibly need: thousands of dollars of expensive textbooks, the best computer, everything that could help him achieve his goal. And at least his parents were supportive of this project, which was also a relief, given how strict and demanding they could be.
“I don’t doubt it,” Dean answered, between two bursts of laughter – and if he hadn’t been busy being overly outraged, Cas would have noted that Dean’s laugh was one of the most beautiful sounds he had ever heard.
“So, what do you wanna do now that we’re finally alone?”
“I like them. It really sounds like a safe place. It helps to hear others sharing their stories.”
It was his voice. Of course it was. Huskier than usual, but Cas could recognize it without any hesitation. He opened his eyes, and slowly, turned around.
"You're gonna be okay, Cas. Just keep the bandage on for a few days, the cut isn't too deep, it shouldn’t scar..."
"Okay, we've got about 20 minutes. Usually I do the dishes, but since you have a dishwasher... Do you have any idea of something we could do while the cookies are cooking?"
Still, he wasn’t against the idea of having sex someday; he also found boys good-looking. And he wanted to be in a relationship. And in a relationship, at some point partners usually made love. So one day, he would be in a relationship, and he would probably have sex with his partner, because, that’s what he was supposed to do. Not now, but in the future. And sometimes, he even masturbated, which was a very sex-related thing to do. So he definitely couldn’t be asexual, right?
“That’s a nice idea,” Cas smiled.
“That’s okay, Cas. Why didn’t you tell me about this? Maybe I could have helped you out,” Dean said, softly.
attractive about Cas' appearance and behavior tonight.
Dean talked about the program and his experience with it a lot. For over an hour. He was also a third year student in mechanical engineering, and he had been a volunteer in the program since his first year. He was from Lawrence so he knew the city pretty well, and he had always wanted to help others. He'd known Jody and Donna since he was in high school, which was why he was so familiar with them. He talked a lot about children he had tutored in previous years with fondness. He seemed to genuinely care about them, even the most annoying ones. He preferred organizing the fun activities rather than supervising homework, but he wasn’t against the school tutoring.
Of course, he was still him, and the closer he got to Sunday, the more anxious he got about it. Surprisingly, though, what scared him most wasn’t the idea of being in a new and unknown situation with strangers – he was actually going to meet those strangers and learn from their experiences! What he really feared was the fact that he had never mentioned asexuality out loud before. He tried to bury it for weeks, thinking it wasn’t relevant, and that he didn’t need to create a new problem for himself. Talking about it would make it real. And Cas wasn’t really sure he was ready for that.
All of this had progressively led Dean to stop flirting in bars, or at least not as much or as seriously as before, and had convinced him to download a dating app. Just to try when he had some time at the bunker. He hadn’t met anyone he talked to in real life yet, but he’d had some interesting conversations. Moreover, using this dating app had allowed him to explore new possibilities, consider options he wouldn’t have dared to in real life. Like writing on his profile that he was looking for both women and men.
He went to his room, where he had put the eight bottles he had bought – orange juice, apple juice, lemonade, and soda – and took a picture that he joined to the message. He smiled, feeling that this answer was appropriate, and pressed “send".
He turned off the tap and stayed like that, leaning over the sink, for a few minutes before he was ready to finally straighten up and move. He shook his head in disbelief and grabbed the peanut butter out of the cupboard and the jelly from the fridge. He found a knife, sat down at the table, and started to conscientiously spread the peanut butter on the bread. He tried to focus on the preparation of the sandwich, but his mind was racing.
Cas gave her a thank-you look as he closed his book.
Dean's heart missed a beat. Cas had hurt himself? He took the three steps that separated him from the bathroom in one bound. Cas and Sam were standing in front of one of the sinks. Sam was holding the bunker's medicine kit, and Dean noticed that the sink was stained red and that blood-soaked compresses had been placed there, probably while Sam was treating Cas.
Keeping this in mind, he allowed himself to be nicer to Dean, to laugh at his jokes.
The feeling of well-being helped him to begin his week on the right foot. He felt better about himself, and he was the first to be surprised about it; he never truly believed in the “magical virtues” of “talking” (or, in his case, listening). It was way too cliché for him. But having a crush on the popular handsome guy who was his complete opposite was already very cliché.
“I didn’t do much…”
“What, you’re not relaxed right now?” Dean said jokingly.
Cas rolled his eyes. “You know I don’t… You wanna watch TV with me, then?”
She reached out her hand to Cas. He shook it.
Dean shrugged. “You didn’t see me with them yet. Anyway, there’s no reason for you to be worried about this program. Everything's gonna be fine. I'll be with you every week, so if any problems happen… I’ll be there to help you with it. For next week, I know a lot of games that we can use for ice breakers. I also like to organize a 'back-to-school' snack. Do you cook?”
He bit the inside of his cheeks, a feeling of nausea invading him. Obviously, Cas had asked him the day before to help him to shave, and Dean had abandoned him to his own devices.. "I'll manage on my own," Cas had told him a few hours earlier. Dean let Cas down, and Cas had hurt himself. Because of Dean.
When Dean judged that he had waited long enough and that Sam - and more importantly, Cas - had probably finished their meals, he decided to leave his garage-refuge, heading for the kitchen.
"Not at all!” Cas quickly answered, to make the frown on Dean’s face disappear. “I was just super happy that you decided to come, but quite surprised when I found out that you were supposed to have poker night at the same time. I thought maybe you forgot about that night when you agreed to come to my place to make the cookies, but you didn't want to cancel since you had committed to baking the cookies for the treasure chest..."
The room probably had been a classic classroom once, but now it was fully decorated with various Pride flags – including the asexual flag, Cas noticed. Charlie had prepared a table with plates of cookies, and chairs were arranged in an arc around it.
He winked again, grinning at Cas, and then, just like that, he was gone. Cas could hear him exclaiming enthusiastically: “Okay guys, you’d better not have started the game without me! Where is my seat?” before someone closed the living room door.
“No, that’s finally a good decision from me. They’re rare, these days!”
“You could have,” Dean interrupted. “I wouldn’t have minded.”
“I just realized… I don’t have any gift ready for you, Dean!”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Tea? How old are you, seventy?”
“Why do you think I would have gotten angry?”
Balthazar closed his book. “Not really, just reading this theater play for one of my classes. Nothing urgent, though. You ok?”
“Alright, anyone wants to start the discussion, today? Anyone wanna share something that struck them during the week?”
“Dean? Will you cook with me this time?” Cas asked, hopefully, when they arrived at the bunker.
“No that’s fine, you warned me, I should have paid more attention. Besides, my meeting tomorrow is only at 2, so I should be fine. What time are your friends coming for?”
Cas nodded and opened the door, delighted with the change of subject. Dean followed him into the living room.
“Okay,” Dean suddenly said, breaking the silence that had set in and standing up, loudly clapping his hands. “You ready to leave?”
“And that’s why you left for the entire day without warning us?”
Dean’s eyes widened. He had definitely not been expecting that – but wasn’t complaining. Quickly, he got caught up in the game, and sat down on the couch, pulling the case to him, opening it gently and taking out one deck of cards.
He couldn’t believe he was breaking down that badly, in the middle of the street where all his neighbors could see him. He hadn’t had such a crisis for weeks, and even months. However, it was all just too much. He was feeling betrayed, and deeply humiliated. Dean wasn’t supposed to have heard that. Cas hadn’t ever wanted him to know, and even if he had, he definitely wouldn’t have wanted him to learn about it that way. He couldn’t even remember exactly what he had said, so he didn’t know how bad it had been. But there was no way Dean hadn’t known he was talking about him. It was so embarrassing. And he couldn’t even run away permanently, because he would have to face Dean the next Saturday, for their usual tutoring session with the children. Cas had no idea how he would react. Or how Dean would react. Maybe he would pretend that nothing had happened? But Cas himself wouldn’t be able to pretend that everything was fine. He didn’t think he could even look at Dean again. Just the idea was making him cringe.
“Basically? Yes!”
“Okay, maybe you want to change your clothes to put on some dry ones? Perhaps take a shower? I can make you some tea, or hot chocolate while you’re using the bathroom. What do you prefer?”
“You’re not going out tonight?” he asked, surprised.
“No, I can wait until tomorrow, I think,” Cas laughed.
This time, Dean could not keep quiet and let Cas continue. “Wait, what? No, man,  don’t think that!”
“Oh, a documentary about space on Netflix.”
“I wouldn’t say he’s dull,” Cas objected.
Oh. Cas was mortified. What a blunder! He was the worst. The conversation had been easy, light-hearted, everything going great, and he had to ask a stupid question that ruined everything. How silly!
“Oh, hello Dean!”
The next day, when they told Sam about their relationship (he caught them coming out of Dean’s room together, so they couldn’t have hidden it from him anyway) he hadn’t been very surprised about it.
“Dean! I know you already know how the program works, but maybe Castiel would like to hear the details, if you would let him listen,” Jody frowned.
“Actually, I could use some advice from an old friend who’s more used to socializing than me…”
Cas bowed his head in acknowledgment. So Dean’s friends would be there, after all. Good. That was what was planned. Cas tried to not be disappointed. He had appreciated the hour he had just spent alone with Dean – which really had felt like a date, even if it wasn’t one.
“Becoming human…changed a lot of things,” Cas started. “I now have new needs - sleeping, eating, drinking - but I also experience different sensations, and…think differently? I quickly realized there were new thoughts, new feelings I was experiencing, feelings I could already perceive as an angel but that are stronger now, that I can’t ignore as I could before?”
Cas paused, searching for his words.
“Hey, Dean,” Cas smiled back. Dean was so close he could feel his breath on his face. His heart was beating fast, very fast. It was going to happen. Dean was going to…
Cas blinked.
However, he had just woken up from a two hour nap, and wasn’t really tired anymore. Every time he tried closing his eyes, Dean’s face kept coming to mind. His brain replayed their meeting over and over, and he couldn’t stop it. He finally sat up in bed, grabbed his laptop, and started playing one of the animal documentaries he really liked. That usually helped him relax, but he just couldn’t focus on it, and with a sigh, he closed the computer. He looked at the time: 10:45. Balthazar had told him that they would probably play until 2 am, and Cas got the unpleasant feeling that he wouldn’t close his eyes until everyone had left. He waited a few more minutes, then couldn't hold out any longer. He got up and left his room.
They battled all sorts of monsters: ghosts and ghouls, vampires and werewolves, angels and demons. They defeated the Devil, the Darkness, Death, and even God Himself. They went to Heaven and Hell and everywhere in between. They risked their lives to save the entire world time and time again.
Dean glaring at the back of his head. He pops the lid off and takes a swig, not ignoring Dean, but not engaging with him either. The longer they sit there in silence, the angrier Dean gets.  Cas is just acting like nothing is wrong, like he doesn’t
Another day, another apocalypse.
know why I will never leave you, why I will always do whatever is in my power to help you.”  He tilts his head like he’s waiting for Dean to get it.  Dean, for his part, can barely breathe, let alone think. Cas’s presence isn’t making his feelings of worthlessness, ugliness,
Dean sucks in a sharp breath and a tear slides down his cheek. He lifts his head and steps back, shaking, as Cas continues, “I said you had changed me.”
“You two have suffered so much, and I wasn’t there to fix it. Few have had to endure trials like you have, and none have ever carried on like you. You’re remarkable, honestly. But that doesn’t justify how difficult I allowed your lives to be, and for all that you’ve suffered, I am truly sorry. But perhaps what I most regret is that you were unable to spend anywhere near enough time on Earth with your soulmates.”
“Cas,” his voice breaks,
For many years, all they had was each other.  But over the years, the people they saved became their family. They gave so much of themselves to help others, and they were loved in return.
[YOUNG DEAN reads a book to YOUNG SAM. YOUNG SAM looks at YOUNG DEAN like a parent.]
[Clips of Dean and Sam beaten and bruised, but working together. They are a team, and they are unstoppable.]
“I said I love you.”
Sam and Dean shared a glance. “Then where are we?” Dean demanded.
“I love you too, Cas.”
“Yes.” Jack nods confidently. “He offered himself to save me. He shouldn’t be in the Empty--he deserves to be here, with you.”
………………………
Sam climbs out of a car, reaching back to open the back door as well. A child runs out and heads straight for the house from the previous shot, now looking fixed up. The front door opens to reveal Dean and Cas and Miracle, who races around the yard. Dean scoops up the child and hugs them while Sam and Eileen greet Cas.
. Cas' brows just furrow even further.
Chuck watched the Winchesters reunite with their friends and family with the same soft smile on his face. After the last hugs had been distributed, he made his way towards Dean and Sam as the crowd parted respectfully around him. He touched both their arms get their attention and said, “We’re not quite done yet.”
“You...” Jack changes directions when Dean starts to look alarmed. “I’ll get him back,” he says instead. Dean’s hesitance is gone and he stares at Jack, wide-eyed.
[Fade in on the Bunker. SAM, DEAN, CAS, and EILEEN sit at the map table, eating dinner. They are happy, joyful even, as they laugh, talk, and sign. As the song continues, we see glimpses of the boys’ future—the peace they deserve.
“It was what they deserved.”
"Dean?"
"Cas, buddy, talk to me. Just spit it out, whatever it is you've got to say."
Dean nodded his assent and with one more quick look at his brother, followed Chuck out of the room. Chuck closed the door behind him and looked up at Dean with the widest grin he’d seen yet from the man.
, just as Cas confesses one more thing, now looking Dean in the eyes.
fade like it normally does and Dean feels like a dam about to break.
yet again leaking through. He rests his head on the door, eyes shut, almost as though in prayer.
In years prior, they might have argued or fought, but they were tired. They had done much for the world, all of it thankless, and they had seen the futility of trying to cheat Death too many times. So when Death told them it was time to go… they went.
“Let me take you to your individual heavens now! The doors are your old bedrooms, so just come with me.”
[Clips of DEAN in Hell and DEAN in Purgatory.]
“You dumb bastard,” Dean whispers, laughing through his tears. Cas chuckles, a few tears escaping him too. They rock together for a moment, overjoyed to be reunited, before Dean pulls back slightly. He doesn’t go far, reaching up to wipe a tear from Cas’s cheek before gently cupping his face. Cas looks stunned and confused and hopeful, eyes searching Dean’s. Dean makes sure to look Cas straight in the eyes as he says, with all his conviction, his truth.
Life continues without pause, as though they never disappeared to begin with. Miracle barks from the back seat of the Impala, drawing grins from the boys and an excited laugh from Dean. Dean jogs over to let her out of the car, while Sam turns back to Jack.
Instead, Sam and Dean Winchester grew old. Their hair grayed, their knees ached, the lines on their faces grew more pronounced. They kept hunting, of course, but there came a day when they realized they could no longer keep up, when even the great Winchesters were a liability out in the field. So they hung up their guns and manned the phones instead, passed on knowledge to young hunters and grew the Men of Letters library. In short, they retired.
They offered the bunker as a refuge for hunters, a place to stop over or gain information or hear stories about the apocalypse—though not from the Winchesters themselves, because some things would always be too painful to talk about.
The older brother taught the youngest how to read, and tie his shoes, and drive a car.
Jack smiles and nods again, gearing up for his rescue mission. He glances at Sam, still oblivious to anything else, before meeting Dean’s eyes.
“Tell Sam I’ll be back soon.” With that, he vanishes, seemingly off to the Empty. Dean looks around, one thousand expressions flitting across his face. He takes a breath and seems to center himself before turning back to Miracle in the car.
“Just like you need to! Now come on, time for bed.”
As they walked, Dean still silent and emotional, Chuck hesitantly began to speak.
Dean wraps his arms around Cas, careful not to squish the cat, and presses a kiss to Cas' forehead."It's okay, Cas."
how Dean feels about Cas using his grace to heal him.  Finally, Dean can’t take the oppressive
sitting between them, and he snaps.
Cas' confusion only increases, along with the adorable wrinkle on his forehead. "Of course not, Dean. That is not at all what I'm asking. Why would you think that?"
“Yeah, of course you guys have soulmates. You’re only the two most important humans in history… kind of makes sense that your love lives would be important too.” While Sam swallowed nervously as his mind raced, Dean’s had gone rather still. It was too much to hope, and yet… he did.
Sam snorted. “Pretty sure taking the Lord’s name in vain is still frowned upon, even when you’re dead. At least we’re here and not… somewhere else.” Dean huffed in agreement and they turned to explore when an impatient voice called out from the balcony.
Dean looked as though he’d been slapped. He opened his mouth as though to reply, but he choked and looked away. His jaw twitched and it broke Sam’s heart to watch his older brother fight back tears. “Chuck…” Sam began, only to be interrupted.
They risked their lives to save the entire world time and time again.
Being a Winchester came with special privileges, one of which arrived on a crisp autumn day just past Sam’s sixtieth birthday. Sam and Dean sat in the kitchen of the bunker, sipping coffee and reading news articles as they’d done for the past several decades, when a change came to their routine in the form of a grim-faced, gaunt man. He cleared his throat for their attention and ignored their startled glances. He simply looked each brother in the eye and said, “It’s time for you boys to rest.”
“Is this it?” Dean asked, glancing around the war room. “An empty bunker for eternity with only you for company? Jesus, that’s depressing.” He was at least pleased to note that Sam looked thirty again, youthful and vibrant, and his own bad knee was no longer aching, so he guessed he was young again as well.
A louder stampede of feet turned their attention toward the library, where over a dozen people were approaching with matching smiles. They received hugs from friends they hadn’t seen in years: from Kevin and his mother, from Jo and Ellen, from Jody and Donna and Victor Henriksen of all people, from Pastor Jim and Missouri Moseley and so many faces they never imagined they’d see again. At long last, Bobby gave them each a gruff pat on the back before pulling them into a hug and whispering, “It’s about time, ya idgits.”
Cas furrows his brow in confusion and stares Dean down. “You know why, Dean.”
[A black screen fades in on a shot of SAM and DEAN in the map room of the bunker. They are clearly smiling and talking, but we cannot hear them. As DEAN passes SAM a beer, a female VOICE begins to speak.]
Cas wondered where Dean was going with that because it was now obvious that he had something in mind. The boy moved a little closer to him, lowering his voice.
“Yes?” Cas encouraged him.
“Anyway, let’s start with the first question…”
“Very fun, you’ll see, Dean!” he insisted.
Cas stopped and gave him a thoughtful, serious look. Dean's smile began to falter.
It was Dean’s turn to blush, and he nervously ran a hand through his hair. Cas was surprised to see that it had been so easy to unsettle this apparently overconfident guy.
It wasn’t a date, but they ordered food, and started to eat, casually talking and joking, and Dean’s friends never joined them. It was just the two of them. It wasn’t a date, but it was looking a lot like it. Especially when Dean grabbed his wallet.
Jo nodded. “If I’m not too tired, I’ll definitely come. I’ll bring some beers.”
« Don’t cry, Dean, please… »
“Well, not much, mostly asking if you're good, and whether I believed that you might come someday to one of our meetings. But, Cas, tell me... Is there something between you?”
Dean nodded, almost unconsciously, still processing what Cas just had said - just had
Cas offered him a smile. “I know, Balt. Thanks. And good night!”
Why would Dean call him? He had seen him five minutes ago and he had seemed fine. Maybe he really had a problem because of alcohol? It was probably better to pick up the phone. Besides, it was the perfect excuse to get rid of Raphael.
“Yes, yes, we’ll be better at my place, but… You’re not going to the poker game?”
They formed two teams of children – Dean’s and Cas’, but of course, they didn’t help the kids since they knew the answers – and they both teased each other about whose team would win. As always, spending time with Dean was nice, and easy, and Cas was feeling good. He was there, supervising the kids, having responsibility, but he was fine. He knew that if he had a problem, he could count on Dean. But he didn’t even need Dean. He could take care of the children by himself now. It was impressive to see how much self-confidence he had gained in just a few months.
Cas nodded sadly in confirmation.
“I’ll think about it," Cas promised. “You’re a nice guy, Dean. No wonder the kids like you!”
CAS: “Very well. I will be waiting for you, then”.
Of course, after leaving Charlie, when he thought about it, he began to second-guess it. What was he thinking? He had never even talked about his asexuality with Balthazar, his closest friend, and he was about to do it in front of people he hadn’t even known two months before? In front of Charlie, one of Dean’s closest friends? What if she told Dean, and Dean decided to stop spending time with him, considering he wasn’t worth it since he wasn’t interested in sex? What would he even say?
Moreover, Dean was starting to get old. Well, he was still in his thirties, he was still good-looking, he could still quite easily flirt in bars, but the more months that went by, the more he was starting to feel out of place when doing that. Sure, hooking up was fun, he couldn’t say he didn’t like it. But sometimes, he caught himself thinking that he was tired of it, that it wasn’t enough for him anymore. Now, he was starting to aspire to some domesticity. Besides, a 35-year-old man like him flirting with young women in their early twenties was beginning to feel wrong to him.
Then they went back to the living-room for Dean to collect his things to leave, but they got lost in the conversation and ended up talking about classes for a while, before Dean finally said (with regret?) that he really had to go back to his residence to finish preparing his tutorial for the next day.
Cas sounded and looked really sad. Dean wanted to do something, to say something, but he couldn’t and just sighed when he heard the door closing. He just screwed things up, one more time.
“I think I identified the problem,” he announced. He clicked on one of the options. “See, you have to select “duplicate the screen” for the computer screen to be displayed through the projector as well."
“Benny, hey!” Dean greeted him, very enthusiastically.
“Wh-What? What is he saying?”
“He’s just too lucky," growled Balthazar.
That was the frustration that actually led him to agree, when Charlie asked him after one of the weekly KU LGBT+ society meetings, if he wanted to share his experience, because the society was planning to prepare a presentation about the various sexual orientations to raise awareness about them. Of course, he hesitated a little at first, but Charlie assured him that he could speak only to the usual group of students, not to strangers. He didn’t have to be involved in the communication campaign organized by the society.
He reached out to shake Cas’ hand. His hand was warm and firm, while Cas’ was almost shaking, without him even knowing why.
Cas looked around, uncomfortable. Most of the children had stopped pretending to do their homework and were looking at them with curiosity.
Dean whistled. “Really? I’m proud of you, Jack! Are you feeling better now?”
And it felt so familiar – the head tilt, the tone of the question, the frown – that Dean couldn’t help it but smile.
“To…sort out my feelings?” Cas answered, with a hint of uncertainty in his voice, as if he wasn’t sure that the words he carefully chose were appropriate.
“Hello Dean. I’m great. Really excited for the game!”
“I’m brushing my teeth”, Cas said, very matter-of-factly, pointing at the toothpaste.
“Sounds date enough for me,” Balthazar shrugged. “I’m not a big fan of sports, but I can definitely give you some advice. Do you mind if we move to your room so I can take a look at your wardrobe?”
On the following Monday, as Cas walked with a sullen, morose face towards his classroom, lost in his thoughts, feeling more alone and misunderstood than ever, his gaze was drawn, once again, to the poster with the multicolored rainbow.
“Well, because I’d understand if knowing that I’m in love with you and that I lied to you for months, pretending to just be your friend, makes you uncomfortable.”
A guy on Cas’ left raised his hand. “Aaron?”
"It's okay, what matters is that everything is fine. You know, Cas was disappointed you weren't here for dinner. I think he likes your burgers better than my cucumber salad..."
? No, they would have seen it. Since Cas had become human, he was living permanently at the bunker. He could drive, but was very rarely out. It was impossible he could have gone on a date without Dean or Sam noticing it. How did Cas even get the idea of the dating app? And how did he learn how to use the app? He could barely use his phone! And when did he create his profile? Was he using the app a lot? Dean thought about it for a minute, but he couldn’t remember Cas being on his phone more than two minutes. At least, not when he was with Sam and him. Maybe it was Sam’s idea? Maybe Sam taught him how to use the app?
“That’s not that I don’t want to prepare him a nice little Christmas Sammy, that’s that I can’t. Man, I’d love to just share a perfect Christmas with him, making hot chocolate, Christmas cookies, building gingerbread houses, decorating a Christmas tree, wearing matching Christmas sweaters… But I can’t!”
“I’m gonna get another beer, do you want to come with me?” Dean asked. “I can get you a drink if you want.”
A girl chuckled: “Yeah, that’s often the case!”
Dean looked at him, a little bit confused by the change in Cas’ behaviour. “Uh, yeah, of course… I’ll pick you up at 1, like usual.”
“ He won’t need it," Dean said, cockily. “He's got me, after all."
Dean almost laughed. No, sharing a cup of chamomile tea while talking about Cas’ insomnia after what he just discovered was the last thing he wanted to do. Sooner or later, he would have to address Cas’ sleeping disorder; his friend probably needed his help with that, and for a moment, Dean felt guilty to act so selfishly. But tonight, he just couldn’t.
Dean knitted his brows, but followed him. "Combine the two? What do you mean? Please, tell me Raphael's not waiting behind the living room door?"
“I won’t forget!”, Cas grinned, opening the door of the car. “So, good night, Dean!”
Dean shook his head in disbelief. He had so many questions. Why did Cas decide to try this dating app? Was he chatting with a lot of people? Had he already met someone in real life? Was Cas
Cas blushed even more. Even though Dean had never had sex, he was still more experienced than Cas in the dating department, and more comfortable with all the flirting and romantic stuff. But he was also incredibly gentle.
“Awesome – you’re welcome to join me anytime, since I owe you for this.”
During the entire afternoon, Dean was in a great mood, full of energy, acting lightheartedly with both the children and Cas. As if he hadn’t told Cas that he looked hot before leaving with another girl fifteen hours earlier.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “Relieved?”
“Yeah…?” Dean encouraged him.
He leaned over to grab something in the back seat. Cas watched him, intrigued.
"Don’t you recognize me? We matched on
Had he, though? Or was Cas just making something up? Dean seemed to be a very kind, friendly, and popular guy. He probably acted with Cas the way he acted with everybody else. Besides, Dean was an extremely good-looking, self-assured guy. Why on earth would he be interested in someone like Castiel? Cas had been wearing pajamas. Cas had been stuttering. His hair had been a total mess. He had stupidly jumped from surprise and hit his head on the cupboard. There had been absolutely
The next day, Cas’ alarm woke him up. He would have woken up before it was time for him to leave for the meeting, anyway, but he didn’t want to risk it. He had set the alarm for pretty late, 11 am, so that he wouldn’t have to spend the morning worrying. He had had insomnia throughout the week and had fallen asleep pretty late last night, the image of Dean’s eyes ingrained in his mind, keeping him awake for hours.
“Depends, what are you watching?” Balthazar quickly came to the living-room, checking the program Cas was watching. He winced.
Dean laughed.
“Oh, hi Cas!” he smiled.
“What, for example?” he asked, with a dry voice.
Cas nodded. “I’m ready to go when you want! I was actually thinking about looking for you to ask you the same thing.”
« What do you mean ? »
“Um, Cas… You sure you wanna talk about this now? I’m okay with it, with talking now, but maybe you need to sleep a little? To recover from your… I guess you had a panic attack, or something similar? That’s why I came. Charlie told me it would probably be better to leave you alone for the evening to let you… think about it? Process it? Especially since you wouldn’t be completely alone, since Balthazar would be here… But I was worried about you, anyway, and I’m so glad I came, since Balthazar isn’t here… I’m sorry it took me so long to come with the keys, by the way. If I had known you were waiting in the rain, I would have tried to get here sooner!”
Raphael was a political science student and Cas was actually having a very interesting conversation with him, when someone tapped on his shoulder. It could only be one person.
“It’s not much, because it was too late, but…. I guess it’s better than nothing? I’m sorry, it doesn’t look like what you saw on those Christmas movies you were watching…”
“Gimme your bottles…” He put them in the fridge as well. “Okay so, the kitchen. Pretty basic, but the essentials are here: oven, stove, fridge, and even a freezer, for ice cream. I kinda like organizing cooking workshops for the kids, time to time… They don’t get to eat homemade meals often, at home.”
Balthazar glanced at his cards and pushed two red chips to the center of the table. “Bet.”
“Dean, if Cas wants a big cliché Christmas, then give it to him! That’s something you would have done, before! Remember how much you liked teaching him human stuff!”
“Okay, so it isn’t that big, but it has everything we need. First, let’s put the food in the kitchen…”
However, since he had met Dean, he had started questioning his sexuality again. He was, indubitably, attracted to Dean. But what kind of attraction was it? He wanted to spend time with Dean, to watch movies with him, to go on walks with him, hold his hand, look at the stars at night… He wanted a romantic relationship with him. However, it appeared that Dean was more interested in sex than romance. He made a lot of references to sex, made sex jokes, was always flirting with everyone, was always with a new girl – which meant that he wasn’t looking for anything long-term. Cas hadn’t lied to Meg: as much as he wanted to be with Dean romantically, if the only thing Dean had to offer him was sex… he wouldn’t take it. If they were involved in a real romantic relationship, and if Dean needed sex in such a relationship, then Cas wouldn’t be against it, because he was a little curious about sex (was it really such a big deal?), and he would trust his romantic partner to help him experiment with it. He could also understand that, even though sex wasn’t important for him, it was essential for other people. He wouldn’t deprive his future partner of sex: he was pretty indifferent to it, so from time to time, he guessed it could be a fun activity.
He looked for the switch to light the room. Prominently displayed on the coffee table, he had put down Balthazar's poker case - since Raphael had enough material at home, his roommate had lent it to him for the evening. "On the other hand, I figured that since I was depriving you of your poker night..."
“You know what, Cas? You can keep it!”
“As long as you’re here with me to supervise my new referee skills, I should be fine.”
Thank you to C. who always supports me very enthusiastically in all my projects (and she doesn't even know neither Supernatural nor fanfictions!)
“How many students usually come?” Cas asked.
“You stayed so calm, I was impressed! You know, you told me one day that you weren’t sure that you were really made to be a doctor, that you weren’t sure whether it was your choice or what you thought you had to do to make your father happy… But really, after having seen you with Jack, this afternoon… I have to say, Mrs. Kline was right, you’ll be an amazing doctor!”
Cas' face was very pale, and his eyes looked empty. He looked like he was in a state of shock. Dean soon understood why when he noticed the bandage on his neck, and the razor left on the floor.
“What?” he asked.
"Here, see?"
“Let me see it, now!”
“Clarence! Didn’t think I’d see you here!”
“Sorry, I really have to go. Thanks again for the tea recommendation. I still prefer coffee, though. Anyway, I’ll see you next week? In the meantime, don’t forget to hit me up if you have any questions!”
It began to rain. How cliché! However, Cas didn’t even care. He was past the anger, past the sadness, now he was just tired. Emotionally and physically drained. He sat leaning against the door, cowering over himself, his head buried in his lap, silently crying dry tears. The rain was falling all over him, but he didn’t even feel it, too numb for that. He lost all notion of time. Balthazar would end up coming back home eventually, wouldn’t he?
"My offer?" Dean repeated, increasingly confused - he had obviously not noticed the metal case that sparkled under the living room light bulb yet.
“Wow, Balt, who’s that handsome guy with you?” a girl asked, raising her beer in Cas’ direction.
“Yeah, precisely. He wouldn’t have missed the opportunity to beat him in his own place usually. He must really care about these children… or about you.”
Dean smiled shyly, and Cas’ heart tightened in a positive way, sending warm vibes through his entire body. Usually, Dean looked cool. At that moment, he looked adorable.
“And I’m going with a few friends, so, maybe you could… Maybe you could join us? If you have nothing else to do, of course. And if you want to. Maybe you don’t. But I could explain the rules to you, and it could be fun, and… Well, it’s your choice. But you can say no. Of course you can, I’d completely understand. Anyway… It’s up to you…”
“At a student society,” he said.
Charlie nodded, understanding. Cas smiled and kept listening to the other students sharing their stories. He felt good at these meetings. He didn’t regret joining the society. At the end of the meeting, Charlie waited for the other participants to leave, to talk to him.
“Or even a few hours. I’d enjoy every minute of it…”
“But… Why? I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t like to have sex with him. Did you even look at him? He has the best ass out of the entire college!”
“Nah, that’s not a big problem, it’s just that, you’ll learn soon enough that when working with kids, you tend to avoid wearing white. White gets dirty easily, especially when doing activities with children.”
“CLCP?”
DEAN: “I am still out, but I’m on my way back to the bunker. I’ll meet you in the Dean Cave in 15 minutes”
She stopped talking as the door opened.
Dean shook his head.
When he finally caught sight of Dean again, he had resumed his conversation with the girl, who was touching her hair with one hand and Dean’s arm with the other, laughing at everything he was saying. A complete cliché of the scene he had expected to see: Dean flirting heavily with some random hot girl (well “hot” according to objective criteria, since Cas was literally the last person who could qualify a girl as “hot,” being not only gay, but also asexual), who also appeared to be very interested in him – of course, who wouldn’t be interested in Dean?
Cas stared at Charlie, confused. Had he heard her correctly? Had she said “date?” Had she implied that Dean had referred to him as “the cute guy from the CLCP?” He titled his head, trying to understand what was going on.
“Perfect, then,” Balthazar said. “I gotta go now, I have class, see you tonight!”
“Is it okay if I keep it for the afternoon? I didn’t bring mine, and…”
“By the way, we weren’t too loud on Friday? Dean told me we woke you up?”
“Dean?” Cas repeated. “Is everything okay?”
Dean nodded. “Suit yourself!”
He and Dean just weren’t compatible. It was a shame, but it was a fact. And pining for the guy wouldn’t bring him anything good.
“At least it means that the kids appreciated it.”
He tried to put more weight on his feet, contracting his muscles, clenching his jaw, and clenching his fists to keep his legs from shaking nervously. A deep breath. An exhalation. A new breath in. It was going to be okay. He was going to calm down, he could feel it. He always calmed down eventually. Slowly, surely, his muscles relaxed, his jaw loosened, as he focused on his breathing. His fists opened, coming back flat on the table. He breathed deeply for a few more minutes, trying not to think about anything but the flow of air from his mouth to his lungs, concentrating on his belly, which inflated with each new breath. Little by little, his breathing became less intense, less jerky. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking a little, getting back in touch with reality. The crisis was over. He felt better now. Empty, though, a little confused.
“He shouldn’t be long, his last class finished thirty minutes ago,” Cas replied, looking at his watch.
“Yeah, yeah, you can,” she said, looking at her feet.
Dean grinned at him. “Perfect, then. I’ll just go to my car to grab the case.”
Dean led them to the main activities room, where he had put a folder on one of the tables when they had first visited the room. He sat down.
“I suggest that for our first week, we don’t divide the group but organize activities to get to know everyone during the two hours, by the way,” Dean said, ignoring Cas' comment, but still looking amused by the banter.
He felt a little bit sappy, but he slept with it. It was Dean’s, after all, and the idea of sleeping with an object that belonged to him made his heart flutter.
“I look forward to it!”
“Don’t worry, I’ll always be with you,” Dean answered.
They had a small budget that they could use for their activities, and Dean said he could do the shopping for the ingredients. He told Cas about his favorite recipes, and Cas didn’t even realize the twenty-minute ride was already over until Dean parked in front of his place.
“You’re perfect, you know that?” Dean whispered near Cas’ ear.
Once again, Dean’s brain froze. There, Cas had said it. The word.
He managed to focus enough on his classes and various assignments to forget about Dean until Friday. On Wednesday, he met Meg in class, but she didn’t tell him anything about her date. Cas preferred to not ask. He was curious, because he had never seen her act like that before, but he didn’t want to be too intrusive. It was already a big step that Meg had mentioned that soccer player on Monday. She would tell him more about it when she was ready.
“Are you busy?”
“That’s a shame!” Dean commented. “I’ll bake some pies, maybe you can bring some drinks? Orange juice, lemonade, that kind of thing.”
Dean froze. He hadn't told him his name yet. By instinct, he placed a hand on his right pocket, where he knew his knife was stored. He looked at the stranger in a new way, aggressively, looking for something suspicious about him.
Cas was indeed happy to wait outside. He needed all the fresh air he could get to calm down after what had just happened. He glanced at Dean. While Cas had been talking to Balthazar, Lisa had got close to him. She was circling his neck with her arms, and was whispering things in Dean’s ear. They were close enough for Cas to hear what she was saying.
It feels like no more than a few seconds later (but it has to have been longer, because he’d fallen back to sleep) that Cas swims back up toward consciousness to the feeling of a very rough tongue assiduously bathing his forehead.
There was such sincerity in that voice.  Such compassion in those eyes.  It wasn’t a command, it was a heartfelt request, and Dean couldn’t imagine a world in which he wouldn’t do as that voice asked, if it did so in that tone.
Later, when Dean happened to catch a glimpse of the clock on his bedside table, he would be startled to discover that that the better part of an hour had passed while he cradled the angel close.  In the moment, the passage of time seemed irrelevant, scarcely worthy of notice.  Had he thought about it, he might’ve registered that at some point his ass had gone numb from the combined weight of he and Cas pressing it into the cold stone floor.  As it was though, his full attention, his entire being was focused so intently on the angel in his arms that he was oblivious to everything else.  The armies of hell could’ve marched through the bunker’s doors and Dean might not have noticed until they ripped Cas from his grasp.
In which Dean and Cas would make truly terrible therapists, but get lots of points for effort.  Also, there are oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  With walnuts.
“I thought we weren’t having sex until I was healed,” Dean couldn’t quite restrain the snarkiness that leaked into his tone, but Cas chose to let it go unremarked upon, forging ahead.
The discovery that he’d somehow missed a frozen package of sausage underneath the bags of frozen corn, peas, and lima beans (seriously, who
Cas’s lips twitched and when he opened his mouth his tone carried a deliberate hint of whininess, “But—“
“Thanks for taking care of it, Cas.  I could’ve done it myself,” Sam said as he popped the last bite of sausage into his mouth.
Oh, hey, and come find me on
Ten more.
Dean’s mind doesn’t get the chance to spiral further into useless what-ifs.  It cannot have been more than five seconds since Cas spoke, but it’s long enough for him to realize that Dean did not instantly jump to obey, so the single word that follows is somehow even sharper.
“You are looking a little…grimy.  And I can smell the sex on you from here, which is kind of amazing.”
“No, Dean.  I can’t—I cannot make you do this.  It is not fair to ask this of you, to ask you to sacrifice this in order to help me fight him back,”
“You may be right,” Cas says thoughtfully, then blinks as the cat in question appears as if summoned by his name.  He stands at Cas’s feet for a moment, yellow eyes focused intently on his face.  Cas suddenly knows, a second before it happens, what the cat is about to do.  He could stop it easily enough, but no, it seems only fair to sit back and allow it.
As you may or may not have noticed, this is Chapter Five.  As you may or may not remember, when I posted the first chapter, I estimated that we were looking at about five chapters.  As you may or may not have concluded...I was very, very wrong.  I'm not even gonna try to revise the estimate.  I have not a fucking clue how long this baby's gonna be.  There's a whole lot that still has to happen before it's time to wrap it up, and as we know, a whole lot I don't plan for in advance tends to also happen when I start writing.
“My pleasure,” Cas says absently, striding across the floor and into the shade of the bed.  “Dean?”
Michael’s voice is pitched low enough to be inaudible to anyone in the nearest tents or even the latrine, but Castiel is nearer still than that, and he hears every word clear as day.
Cas chuckles a little, then reaches down and helps Dean to his feet, steadying him and holding him up until he feels more solid.  Then he ushers Dean forward to the table once more and uses a strong hand to guide him gently back into bending over.
Nevertheless, for guys who prided themselves on keeping the world safe, it was a little sad how oblivious they were to something that pretty much everyone within a radius of about 100 miles in every direction was talking about.
“Tell me you trust yourself, Cas.  Tell me you forgive yourself.”
“Holy shit,” Dean says, snatching it from Sam and ducking back inside to test the theory.  In short order he discovers that Sam’s right, the thing works perfectly.  Dropping it into one of the armchairs, he again sticks his head out the window. “You,” he tells his brother, “are a fucking genius.  Now we can watch television!”
“Dean!” Sam exclaimed in relief, clearly certain that Dean would put a stop to this, “Can you please tell Cas that there are lots of fun card games that he’ll enjoy that don’t carry the same…potential risks?”
Keeping a close eye on Sammy’s feet, which haven’t moved in the last minute or two as he continues to carry on a one-sided (from Dean’s perspective) conversation with Cas, Dean starts to back quickly toward the wall.  He doesn’t waste the time to turn around and more closely survey the terrain.  After all, he
He crouches, long arms reaching under the table and emerging with the kitten, who promptly takes a clawless swipe at a lock of his hair, and without giving his body permission to do so (there seems to be a hell of a lot of that going around these days, for fuck’s sake), Dean is stepping forward to snag the collar and carefully fasten it around the kitten’s ridiculously small neck.  Sam sets him back down, and the kitten immediately tries to go after his own collar and instead ends up rolling halfway across the library floor like a clumsy tumbleweed.  Sebastian wriggles until Sam sets him down as well and goes happily frolicking after the kitten, who welcomes him into an impromptu wrestling match that looks like something out of Looney Tunes only less violent and way the shit cuter.  Dean can feel his lips twitching with the urge to laugh at their antics and honestly, three or four years ago he might have put his foot down and flatly refused to let them keep the animals—or, if he did, he’d have done it with only the greatest reluctance and curmudgeonliness—but what the hell?  Their days of apocalypses are through, the milk run hunts pretty much never take more than overnight at most, and why shouldn’t they get to do things like have pets?  He’s spent long enough being a killjoy and frankly, he’s tired of it.  So, just to see if he’s capable of it, he tests
“I cannot say I had ever before seen—or even imagined seeing—a cockroach riding a rat, but apparently wonders will indeed never cease,” he observes meditatively, and Dean cracks up at the mental picture.
“I do not understand.  What spawned this argument?”
that it’s only Sam’s blood on the floor and not his body.  Kidnapped is no fucking picnic, they all have good reason to know it by now, but it’s a damn sight better and more readily fixable than dead.
In the closet.
much, I promise I’ll pay attention in—“
After his first drink, he took a shorter second sip, then pressed the bottle back into the still-extended hand.  This time he did hear the soft sound of the cap being screwed back on, before several seconds elapsed in silence as Cas waited for him to drape himself over the hood.
I know many of you had some serious concerns at the conclusion of the last chapter.  I'll be interested to hear your thoughts on how things play out.  Heads' up for a chapter that is not particularly light-hearted and deals with some heavy topics (but as always, there's still a few giggles to be found in there).
No response was expected, and none was forthcoming.  When the hand drew back and started to fall with relative lightness against his ass, he found it hard to focus on the sensations.  He was too wrapped up in the inexorable, inescapable feel of the leather strap draped across the center of his back, a visceral reminder of what was coming.
Under different conditions, Dean might’ve been embarrassed by how fast he broke.  Now?  Well, he challenged anyone not to follow pretty much any instruction given to them under the current circumstances (except that his dick better be the only one ever in the current circumstances because, hello, monogamous).
He never does get back to sleep.
Help me hold him back.”  Cas is curling forward, into himself, the way someone in great pain does, and Dean takes him by the shoulders and shifts forward, pulling him in so that he can wrap his arms around the angel.
“Or we die,” Cas told him flatly.  “Apparently, starting the game effectively places a curse on all participants which can only be lifted by completion of the game.  Otherwise all players will die 24 hours after the game stalls.”
Zachariah supposes that he could’ve done more to stop it.  When Charles led the gang, he discouraged the worst of what Castiel faced from his cousins in childhood, gently chiding his children and nephews that sons weren’t to blame for the sins of their parents, but Zachariah’s never really felt the same.  Once he took over, he kept silent where his brother would’ve intervened, and pretty soon everyone got the message that it was open season on Castiel, by then in his late teens.  Then, more than half a decade ago, there was that incident that cemented his low rung in the totem pole, and even if Zachariah had wanted to intervene thereafter—which he didn’t—he couldn’t have done a whole lot to change things.
They went to Heaven and Hell and everywhere in between.
“I hope not,” Dean said. “Where’s Cas?”
At that declaration, they heard a door slam and scores of feet racing around the bunker. Before they could truly wrap their brains around what Chuck had said, Dean was tackled by a red-headed menace who hugged him tight enough to hurt. “Charlie!” he cried, picking her up and spinning her around. The minute her feet hit the ground, she was grabbing Sam. “Sup, bitches!” Their faces split into identical huge grins, and Dean felt his eyes begin to water.
He’s just drawn in a breath to call for Cas when a figure a good deal less welcome comes around the side of a tent.
“Yes, I’m quite serious,” Cas tells him serenely, effortlessly reading his question from his expression, and if Dean were either a braver or a stupider man, this is where he’d make a face.  As it is, he opts to gaze plaintively at Cas, trying to channel Sam’s gift for puppy dog eyes.  All it gets him is a laugh and a firm, open-palmed slap on the side of one thigh, urging him to follow instructions.  Knowing better than to think that Cas is likely to let another delay slide, Dean shuffles forward and obediently bends forward over the table, shuddering a little as his chest makes contact with the cold metal.
“A little over three hours, just after eight am, and about 30 miles out of Butte, Montana.  Which, by the way, is a fucking
The belt fell again, driving all thought from his brain for a few agonizing seconds.  He didn’t realize his nose was running until he heard himself sniffle, didn’t realize his hands were curled into fists until his fingernails bit into his own palms in anticipation of the next strike.
off the walls of the garage.
Instead he let his legs, now shaking from what he would resolutely insist was solely the aftereffects of his fear for Sam’s life (it certainly had nothing to do with how high the stakes for this conversation were for the future of Dean’s love life), give out on him.  He slid silently down the wall to land in a graceless pile on the floor, closed his eyes, and listened for all he was worth.
“…no, sir,” Dean said, his quiet voice warring between desperation and resignation.
“I thought,” he said with mock confusion, “that I had instructed you to shut up, but surely I must be mistaken, if you are continuing to run that pretty mouth.  I guess we will just have to put it to better use, won’t we?”
Surprise, surprise.  For all that he still manages to spice things up impressively, long experience has taught Dean more than a few things about how Cas operates.
The angel could be anywhere by now, tucked away in any dark corner, impossible to find unless he wanted to be.  And it wasn’t like he needed to come out to use the bathroom or eat or…
Sam snorted incredulously.  “If you really want to have a conversation about self-respect, you’re guilty of at least three recent crimes against decency I can think of off the top of my head, not to mention—“
They both pause there, taking a moment to adjust, and then Dean starts moving, undulating slowly up and down, taking the time to enjoy the sense of fullness and the jolt of pain every time Cas’s thighs snug against his ass.
“You’ve never been able to resist it,” Dean agrees, then pauses and snorts with laughter.  Cas quirks a brow at him in silent question.  Dean should probably resist the urge, but his impulse control has never been that good.  He’s chortling before the words have even left his mouth.  “You might say it’s…like catnip.”
“That…that was—“
“Oh, but I think it is.  I think it is
There’s definitely only one right answer to
Sam grunted.  He still hadn’t forgiven Cas or Dean (which was patently unfair, since he’d had nothing to do with it) for his impromptu trip to Manhattan, KS several weeks ago.  Dean, who felt a little squirmy at the memory, stepped in to disabuse Cas of his aspirations toward snow warfare.
“That,”
Putting this out of his mind (if only because Sam was the last thing Dean wanted to think about in mid-erotic-spanking), Dean closed his eyes and sank into sensation completely.  The mild strain of his shoulder muscles at the angle they were held by his bound wrists.  The brush of Castiel’s suit’s fabric against his belly and cock.  The cool tile of the floor against Dean’s tiptoes (the only part of his feet touching the ground).  The feel of the cool air his harsh panting dragged into his lungs.  And, of course, the progressively more intense stinging, underlain by a deeper throbbing, as Cas continued to work his magic.
“Shhh.  Then you won’t.”
No, if Sam’s phone is off, it’s not because he turned it off himself.
Even after the sun went down, Sam and Dean refused to be moved from the library, glaring at the windows as if they could somehow develop x-ray vision that would tell them how much more snow had melted if they only looked hard enough.
Juice sounded
in his entire life.
“I take it you’re not a drinker,” Dean says, quirking a brow at the other man.  Cas sobers, the smile going from his face.
Somehow, Dean got through the next hour.  More than once he had opportunity to be grateful to Cas for assigning him actual tasks that required attention in the two hours before he was due in the garage.  Of course, it was no accident that the specific tasks he’d been assigned only demanded so much of his attention.
Oh, hell no.  Now it was
Can't wait to hear what you have to say about this chapter, and I'll see you guys on Wednesday with the next one!
The silence after this pronouncement spins out for what feels like hours but is probably no more than twenty seconds—and honestly, ‘silence’ is probably overstating it.  Neither Cas nor Dean actually talks, but there’s definitely spluttering from Dean and a few abortive inhalations from Cas—the sort one makes when they’re about to start speaking and then realize they haven’t a fucking clue what to say.
Then, finally, Cas speaks again.  “It seems only right,” he says, and there is something sly and calculating in his voice that Dean both loves and fears, “that you should thank me for taking the time to correct you.  For putting in the effort to instruct you on appropriate behavior.  Unfortunately, thanks to your own injudicious use of it, that smart mouth is currently out of commission, leaving you unable to tell me how grateful you are.  And that, Dean,” he murmurs, slowly tracing a single finger down the back of Dean’s neck to his back, then further still, “simply will not do.”  That finger slides all the way down the small of Dean’s back to the tip of his crack, not ceasing until it rests directly atop the plug.  A heartbeat later, fingers seize the plug, unceremoniously withdrawing it from where it has nestled so snugly.
“Yes, Sir.  You’re understood.”
“Okay, fine,” he caves, carefully bringing his hand down in front of Cas.  Cas reaches out a tiny hand, carefully sets it atop the blister, closes his eyes, and focuses.
“We both know where you’re going with this, so why don’t you get on with it?  Or are you so in love with the sound of your own voice that you have to take ten years to get around to a point?”
It was, Dean had long known, really hard to say no to someone who could make a good case while also making you laugh.  He wasn’t sure how good his case was, but he’d definitely nailed the making Cas laugh thing, anyway.
Cas knelt up fully and then shifted, somehow succeeding in nudging each of Dean’s legs until they were pressed close against his knees.  How he managed this reasonably awkward feat while continuing to look like sex on two legs, Dean would never know, and couldn’t honestly be called upon to care, because
Even Dean has to admit that he might have a point there.
Dean could hardly fault Sam’s logic.
Dean went ahead and let his eyes widen in horror, straightening up in his chair as if only just realizing how serious this was.  When he spoke, he was a little surprised by the note of earnest pleading in his voice.  “No, sir, come on, you can’t do that.  If I fail your class, my GPA’s gonna drop too low for sports.  I could lose my scholarship.”
Dean recognized immediately that Cas was aiming for an easy, low-key day without any of the high-intensity play that had marked the past several days.  He clearly felt strongly that he had been demanding too much from Dean and that some recovery time was in order.  Dean didn’t necessarily think that a laid back day or two was a bad idea (although if asked, he would’ve argued vociferously that Cas hadn’t been pushing him too hard).  They could probably stand to get their feet back under them, if not from the heavy play, certainly from the drop that had shaken them both hard.  He only now truly understood that it had been at least as hard on Cas as it had been on Dean himself.  Indeed, Dean mused, perhaps in some ways it had been even harder.   Considering how he felt when his loved ones were hurting and he couldn’t fix it—let alone in pain he felt that he had some part in inflicting—it wouldn’t surprise him if the drop had actually been more damaging to Cas.
was also an unqualified disaster.
“It seems to me,” Cas told him, stepping forward and suddenly reaching between Dean and the desk, swiping a fingertip through the streaks of come that he hadn’t yet gotten around to cleaning up, “that you
In which reality is way more unbelievable than anything Dean's imagination could come up with.
Well, yeah, it is, there’s nothing
like this, would he?  That didn’t even make sense.  That was—
Dean heard it first, the quiet drag of bare feet coming down the hall.  Well, at least that confirmed that Sam had actually been coming to the bathroom like a normal human being and had just managed to avoid them so far.  Dean knew the instant that Cas caught on, a few seconds later, because the hands on his hips tightened sharply.  It was perfect, really, because it pulled an authentic gasp out of Dean the second that Sam came around the corner and stood silhouetted in the doorway.
After finding another small clearing elsewhere in the scrub brush to relieve himself, Dean ventures back into the cave long enough to grab some more hard tack and jerky before settling down in the clearing, letting himself fully wake up slowly.  He’d kill for some coffee—feels like it’s been years since he’s had a cup—but satisfies himself with looking forward to tomorrow morning, when (barring disaster) he’ll wake in his own bed and can have as many cups of coffee as he pleases.
“For sure,” Sam agreed, mouth already stuffed with sausage, “Dean, this is awesome.”
There was no sign of Sam, whose bed appeared untouched since he’d made it this morning.  Indeed, the only sign that anything in the room had been disturbed was the glow of the laptop screen where it sat on a desk in the corner.  Huffing out a breath that was equal parts concern and frustration, Dean took a couple steps further into the room, scanning it one more time to look for anything he’d missed and finding nothing.
“You should probably not say that about my Father,” Castiel tells him mildly, “and it doesn’t matter what I know, I will hear you say it or you will not have it.”
Ninety seconds of invisible blowjob later and Dean realized he didn’t have half a clue what was going on in the movie anymore, and didn’t give a damn, either.
“You know you’re gonna get your ass
When he finally finished Sam was silent for a long time, swirling the whiskey in his glass as he thought.  Just when Dean was starting to think he might really lose it, Sam’s eyes finally rose to meet his.
Dean’s familiar with the horse, not to mention the rider, so it comes as no surprise when Garth shouts back, “Novaks, Dean!  Ambush!  Musta been lying in wait for us nearby—"
“Go to the bathroom.  I will fetch you something to eat.”
“Um, yeah,” Dean says, “so you don’t think maybe you might develop some—you know what, never mind,” he cuts himself off in mid-sentence.  This is way too much fun to ruin by pointing it out to Sam.  “So you’re communicating with Stuart, that’s awesome, is that what you came galumphing in here to tell us?”
“She—her name was Opportunity, but she preferred ‘Oppy.’  She landed on Mars in January of 2004, along with her sister, the
With no discussion, they set out together, grimly forcing their way through some of the thickest forest Dean has ever seen.  Cas
Cas hastened out of the room toward the kitchen, and Dean watched the snake slither around silently while Sam continued to scan the page he was looking at.
In which Cas lays down the law, Sam discovers what happened to the library in his absence, and Dean and Cas realize that sometimes, solutions create other problems.  Sadly, there's no food.
the storm clouds gathering in the air and cringed silently, trying to decide whether he should flee back to the kitchen as fast he could before Cas came blasting right back out of the library, spotted him, and got even angrier.  In the end, he decided that after 36 hours, he’d take that anger over continued radio silence.  Hell, he’d take Cas’s rage, no matter how he wanted to vent it.  He wanted to put Dean on his knees?  Wanted to make him hurt?  To make him cry?  Make him scream?
Dean stares at Castiel for a long moment in silence, searching his face as if Castiel is a puzzle he’s trying to solve.  Castiel looks right back, steadily, waiting patiently for Dean to make a decision.  If he refuses the bark, Castiel will say no more about it.  It’s his choice, and the man has precious little say in what happens to him now.  The least Castiel can do is permit him this one.
At least some of the time, Dean knew what was good for him.  He’d taken his hand back before Cas could even finish the threat.
Netflix refused to load for some reason when Dean finally gave up on making himself useful (and grumpily avoiding the celibacy-enforcing angel) and decided to queue up one of his favorites that he could maybe fall asleep to, and that was just about it for Dean.  What underdeveloped patience he was in possession of finally deserted him altogether, and he stripped off the sweatpants that still felt rather unpleasant against his blistered ass before flopping down on the bed (on his stomach, of course).   It took a while, but eventually sleep was persuaded to take him away.
“You flatter me,” Gregor says warmly, “but I am not complaining.  By my estimate, we still have nearly ten hours left before the potion wears off, so there is no lack of time remaining in which we can speak as equals.”
“That’s my good boy,” Cas says, and the words are casual but there’s such sincerity in the underlying note of pride that Dean feels warmed to the core.
Dean groaned and scrubbed both hands through his hair, tipping his head skyward and leveling a skewering gaze at whatever higher power might be gazing down at them.  “Seriously?  This is what you give me?  A weepy yeti and a punning angel?
He turns and strolls off then, in no real hurry.
Something about it that he can’t quite pinpoint.  He knows it’s related to the power play that already infuses everything they do.  Maybe it’s the juxtaposition of being entirely at Cas’s mercy and having the angel torture him with the gentlest of touches rather than the sharp smack of a hand or the harsh bite of a belt.  Maybe it’s the fact that Cas is so unbelievably good at managing the interplay of both; the brutality and the deceptive softness—because as much as the fucking
“Where did you—oh!  Isla del Sol!”
Dean couldn’t hold back his snort.  Apparently, they were the last ones to know.  Clicking on the article, Sam scanned it, reading aloud as he went.
Okay.  Okay.  He can do this.  He just has to
hard, and his own dick had bounced back from far worse insults—but he couldn’t actually manage any words for the first several minutes.  Every time he started to get himself under control, he remembered the sound of Cas’s gravelly voice melodramatically telling him to take it, bitch, and he lost it again.
But not this one.  Not this time.  This time, the kid could sit and stew for a few days, and maybe once he got the message—that Dean was absolutely done indulging this little delusion of his—they could even release him under close supervision.
when someone talked about ‘wringing their hands’) as his bare feet trod soundlessly down the cold marble of the hallway.
Dean had indeed been thinking that if Michael wanted to play things that way, he was underestimating the kind of fuss Dean was capable of kicking up.  Dean was betting that Michael wasn’t willing to risk half his family seeing the things he got up to in private, and gagging Dean during wouldn’t stop what he could tell the rest of them in the light of day.
The tears that had risen in Dean’s eyes didn’t really register to him until he blinked and his vision got all smeary, and then he just felt like a giant jackass.  What kind of a wimp got all weepy because his boyfriend needed a break to calm down?  What the hell would John Winchester say if he could see his oldest son now?
“You ran, Dean,” Cas continues, and Dean jerks suddenly as the angel’s fingertips skate over the head of his cock, spreading that drop of precome down his length before that goddamned hand again wraps around him and starts to move.  He skips the preliminaries this time, setting a pace and gripping firmly enough that anyone would assume he was actually aiming to get Dean off.
before sensation caught up with sound.  Cas had, honest to God, slapped his hand away from his own dick.  He hadn’t pulled the force, either. Dean looked down in astonishment to find a bright red handprint blossoming across the back of his own hand, courtesy of the angel who (despite being several inches shorter) was managing to loom over Dean.  Somehow Cas, who had been four or five feet away, still staring with concern at the door when Dean looked at him half a second before, had ninja-ed his way across the room to get between Dean and his dick.  Jaw hanging partway open in surprise, he lifted his gaze from his hand to Cas—or tried, anyway.  Before his eyes had actually managed to settle on Cas, they were both in motion so sudden that it practically short-circuited Dean’s brain.
of a state.  Wish your wings were working. What I wouldn’t give for you to be able to zap us home.”
The next creature the game threw them made Sam almost paroxysmic with joy (“Oh my God, it’s a hippogriff!  BUCKBEAK, IS THAT YOU?!”), and while it was fairly large, it didn’t seem especially aggressive, content to hang out on the floor, blinking at them blandly.  That is, until Cas drew his next card and read it out:
As it is, when he finally gives up the ghost and lets himself tumble toward the ground (it doesn’t occur to him for a single second to worry that Cas won’t catch him; he would never let Dean fall), he’s too stuck on the way Cas just outmaneuvered him to start groveling.
Dean shuts the fuck up, exchanging a glance with Sam, who has stuffed his hand into his own mouth in order to control his giggles.  Dean guesses in different circumstances, he’d probably find the whole thing hilarious, too.  As it is, he’s too busy trying to memorize what it feels like to have a painless ass, since he’s pretty fucking sure that ship is about to sail.
The stranger frowns, squinting suspiciously at him as if there’s some kind of punchline in the offing.  When none comes, he steps around the tree, inspecting the chains fastening Dean to it, then steps back around to his front and squints some more.  “Hunh.  I’ll get back to you on that,” he says, sounding for all the world as if he actually means it, and strides off, back in the direction he came from.
Dean didn’t even want to know what was coming next, but was pretty sure there was no way around finding out.  Rather than speaking, he simply raised the other brow.  Now both of them were hovering in mid-forehead as he stared at Sam.
“Unless you want me to tell you, in great detail, more about
to be taken, to be fucked, to be put in your place.  You
Despite Cas’s concern, there was no sign of Sam, and almost before Dean knew it, one of Cas’s hands was shifting slightly so that he could turn the doorknob to Dean’s room and let them into it.
He looked…okay.  Not great, maybe, his eyes were still a little red-rimmed as though his emotions had still been just a little too raw after Dean had fallen asleep--but not like he’d been truly weeping; not like he’d silently fallen back to pieces.  Dean craned his neck, tipping his chin forward enough to brush his mouth against each of those eyes (Cas obediently let them fall shut) then tracking slightly south so their lips could meet.  The kiss was soft, sweet, and slow.  There was no urgency to it, no true heat.  It was not a prelude to anything, nor did it need to be.
Dean didn’t realize he’d been gaping wordlessly at Cas until he spoke again, lips twitching faintly.  “I think you had better repeat your instructions back to me.”
There was a moment of silence, in which Cas looked at Dean as if he had never truly seen him before.  It might have been uncomfortable, might have made Dean nervous, if the adoration that always lay just below the surface when Cas looked at him had not been so clearly in attendance.  The adoration had been joined by more, though.  There were many things to sort through in the eyes resting steadily upon him, but what Dean registered most was (amusingly enough) an almost child-like wonder.
displeased with you, and I think we both know that it is not in your best interests to displease me, is it?”
Dean let him stew for a minute before he went ahead and put the kid out of his misery between gales of laughter.  “Oh, calm—calm down, that’s not our gig.  But anyway, that’s a—that’s a seriously risky-ass place for you to be hanging out.  Even without having to worry about piss, there’s bound to be bodily fluids of other kinds.”
Cas smiled slowly, showing all of his teeth, and Dean was reminded of nothing so much as a shark swimming head-on toward its unsuspecting dinner.  “Oh, no,” the angel told him, the hint of cruelty in his voice damn near
“Oh, no,” Dean told him cheerfully, “I’m staying out of this one.  I leave it to you two to sort out.  I’m gonna go make dinner.”
“So eager for it.  I love that eagerness,” Dean could hear a ‘but’ coming, and he was not wrong, “but I thought today would be a good time for you to learn some patience.  I want to take my time with you.”
In which maybe this is all just a really vivid acid trip, because it cannot possibly be real life, can it?
“Tell me you trust yourself.  Tell me you forgive yourself.”
In the end, though, the decision wasn’t a hard one. Cas had been waiting a long damn time for this, and then had it snatched away from him at the last minute by Dean’s ill-considered actions.  Dean wouldn’t make him wait even longer.
It’s no less painful than he remembers.  The first hit snaps his cheekbone.  The second knocks out two teeth and loosens probably five others.  Really, it’s no surprise that Lucifer can hit like a concrete wall condensed into fist-size.  What’s truly cruel is that the archangel keeps talking.  He can’t even escape the obnoxious droning in violence.
What this does NOT mean:  I'm not going to post at all between now and then or Down to Size will be perpetually unfinished.
Dean didn’t have long to wait.  Having clearly laid out his intentions, Cas wasted no time in getting started.  The hand that had so gently, so tenderly rubbed the flesh laid out before it pulled back.  Dean drew in a hasty breath in a valiant but futile attempt to steel himself.  All he succeeded in doing was noisily expelling the gasp when the first set of spanks rained down from above.  Their normally sharp cracks were somewhat dulled by the paper-thin barrier of the panties between his ass and Cas’s rock hard palm.  Dean was well aware that the panties would only be allowed to stay up for so long before, true to his word, Cas drew them down to tangle around Dean’s thighs, framing his reddening ass.  For now, though, they stayed put, a mockery of protection against the swats that began to rain down, each one leaving a searing handprint, perfect—if temporary—reflections of the one branded permanently into Dean’s shoulder.  Cas paused for a moment to rub circles, and though he began to speak in the quiet, when the rhythmic, steady smacks started up again, he lifted his voice to be heard over them.
Rolling his eyes upward and silently demanding to know why
Lucifer shakes his head in a mockery of sadness.  “And here I thought you’d want to spoon.  Sammy was always such a cuddler, afterward,” he is silent for only about five seconds, letting Dean process that, before he bursts into laughter, “I’m lying, of course.  Sammy favored the whole huddle in a corner and shake gig, too.”
Dean hears Cas huff out a breath in satisfaction.  Since the rat is clearly disinclined to listen to Cas’s explanations, maybe he’s more likely to hear Dean out.
You guys.  YOU GUYS.  You'll never believe it.  _I_ don't believe it, but I DID IT.  This chapter right here is one of the three chapters I've had planned forever!
Okay, he’s got a point, but it’s still unsettling.

“Worthless fuckin’ hypocrite,” Dean spits, and Castiel knows that ain’t meant for him neither.
Three more near-orgasms, something like fifteen swats, and a whole lot of unwelcome fingers jabbing into Dean’s most intensely t-word-ish spots (fuck you, he doesn’t have to think it if he doesn’t want to) later, Dean is a writhing, whimpering, debauched mess of a man.  His ass feels five times its normal size, swollen and red and impossibly tender.  His cock has made an absolute mess of Cas’s lap with the precome he’s been leaking alone.  He’s cursed Cas up one side and down the other (thankfully obscured by the gag), and he’s not entirely sure when he started crying in earnest but those are definitely tears dripping onto the floor under his head.  Cas hesitates for a moment—and it’s definitely a hesitation, there’s a distinct difference between that and his deliberate pauses—and at the sound of Dean’s sniffle, the hairbrush is immediately set down on Dean’s back, freeing Cas’s hands to untie the tie that’s held the gag in place for the last millennium or so.  Dean takes this as the permission it is, spitting out the sodden gag and taking in a deep breath.
Sam’s lips twitched a little, straightened out, and he spoke a little slower and with exaggerated patience, “I said, I had to figure out whether you thought I might know that you knew that I knew, and—“ Sam broke off on a chuckle, as Dean tried desperately to follow along, “—nah, I’m just fucking with you.  I saw you drug the food.”
Bart grins slowly.  “Look at that blood.  You made him dirty, Michael.  Let’s give the poor fellow a bath.”
We're in for a rough journey, my friends.  I'm grateful to have you along with me in the dark.
“I think I’ve got some whitefish or tilapia somewhere back there that I could sauté.  And we do,” he added reluctantly, “still have a decent selection of frozen veggies.  I could cook up some green beans with it and maybe some roasted potatoes?”
he needed to get it under control, but come on.  It would’ve taken a far better man than he to take Cas’s unexpected performance in stride, “that my genitals
“Oh, hey, good, you’re done.  I was thinking maybe we should make some popcorn, watch a movie, what do you think?”
“There’s a Winchester,” Castiel says, and Zachariah stares at him.
No footsteps ringing in your ears.
Dean had to take a second to work through it.  That was a lot of words, and he still felt so…fuzzy.  Hazy.  Slow.
Why, Dean wonders do they always
He was angry.  You weren’t in a scene.  But he told you to shut up, told you that you couldn’t talk unless he gave you permission, you could only nod and shake your head.  That wasn’t—that’s not kosher, Dean.”
How is this
different, but I think this is…sort of a unique situation?  Yeah, the first time I called you a junkless Ken doll and a coward, I wasn’t necessarily intending you to hear it, but it’s not like I didn’t know that if I pray to you, you hear it.  I’ll grant it wasn’t so much a prayer,” his lips twitched a little in amusement, “or if it was it was a douchey one, but it’s not really any different.  I was thinking it
“It was killer, Sammy, thanks.  Do you think maybe we could stop in the kitchen before we go back to the house?” Apparently, he’s already started think of the pink monstrosity as ‘home’ for however long this lasts, an idea which should probably be more disturbing than it is.
something you need to worry about me doing again.  I smelled like a pond in Scotland or some shit for like, three weeks afterward.  That was punishment enough.  Besides, Cas got me my own bubble bath, and—“
you take out?”
of and kidnapped your brother?”
Cas was well aware of what his dirty talk did to Dean.  Really, it was a gift.  His filthy mouth, growling in Dean’s ear, had more than once made the difference, pushing Dean over the edge.  Today would be no different.
Michael’s father had once boasted a good relationship with John Winchester, the patriarch of the Winchester gang.  They’d been friendly as young boys, and when their paths ultimately took them both into outlawry decades later they maintained a respectful acquaintance, even teaming up on occasion for jobs that required a little something extra.
“I will take over driving when we stop in Butte,” Cas says, “I am recovered enough that—“
“Alright,” he calls, keeping his voice as low as he can while still ensuring Jeb and Garth will both hear him from their spots around the clearing, tucked behind mounds of scrub brush just tall enough to conceal the men astride their horses.  He rises and slaps the dust off his hands onto his well-worn denim.  “‘bout ten horses, maybe two miles out, comin’ in fast, definitely headed this way.  Looks like our dates are arrivin’ shortly, gentlemen.  Ten minutes, maybe.”
If the spirit moves you, stop by the comments, let me know if you're still reading and invested in this (it's been foreeeever), and tell me how much you hate me.
It’s over.
And how he’d handled it was that he’d come untouched, without so much as a single finger on him, from nothing more than the bite of the belt jarring against the plug Cas had inserted.  That, and the incredible headspace he’d found himself in when Cas fucked him afterward had told Dean all he needed to know about his ability and desire to keep experimenting with not only increased impact play but higher levels of pain.
“Do you think this is enough, or should we wait for the next batch to cool enough to be plated too,” he asked Cas, kind of hoping the angel would play along and give them an excuse to wait a little longer before facing Sam again.  To his total lack of shock, Cas sailed right past Dean’s fishing.
“Sounds great,” Sam smiled at him, “thanks so much for cooking all this time, Dean.  I know I’ve been more useless than usual since I’m not even going in the hive.”
A second later, Cas withdrew two small bottles of juice, one of which was already opened and both of which were ice cold.  Dean didn’t have a chance to ask if that was due to the magic of angel mojo before Cas set one bottle in each of his hands.
Sam had readily accepted Dean’s apology, told him not to worry about it, and been nothing but solicitous in asking how Dean was feeling, whether he was recovering okay.  He’d been more than happy to hang out with Dean, to take a break from his research and chat about nothing at all, to watch a movie.  Actually, he’d been very careful never to leave Dean alone with his thoughts for too long, to step in when Dean started to lose himself in the dark voice that insisted, ever more loudly, that Cas hadn’t come back because he
“It seemed to me,” Cas told him gently, “that perhaps you were in need of a little CTL.”
The sight of Cas’s bare feet hitting the floor just in front of them and his hurried movements forward toward the phone-turned television at the opposite wall suddenly clarifies in Dean’s sleep-drunk mind the source of the heart-stopping noise.  They’re getting a fucking
Cas withdraws carefully, one arm sliding around the front of Dean’s waist to hold him up as the other hand reaches around, fingers lightly prodding at Dean’s lips until he gets the message and parts them.  Cas reaches in and removes the wrecked panties, carelessly dropping them to one side.  Dean will mourn them later (they really were lovely and he only wore them the once); at the moment he can’t spare them even a thought.  His mind swims hazily, a thousand tiny—and not so tiny—aches and pains combining into an oddly pleasant cloud of throbbing soreness.
Dean loved how vulnerable it made him feel, being totally naked before a fully clothed partner.  He loved the feeling of exposed helplessness.  He always would.
Cas gave a tiny shrug which Dean recognized as an ‘if you say so, I’m sure as hell not going to object to getting a piece of that ass,’ and was off the bed and freed of his sweatpants in about the time it took Dean to blink.
There was nothing like waking up still wrapped in the same arms that soothed him to sleep to make Dean feel loved, particularly since he knew that Cas had no need to sleep.  The angel had not only lain awake, but done so without the benefit of a book or movie or other entertainment, his attention focused intently and entirely on cradling Dean close to him.
“Yes, that,” Cas agreed, unperturbed by the error or the correction.  “Take off your robe and lie down on the bed, please.”
“Don’t keep me in suspense,” he urged a little breathlessly, hand tightening again in the angel’s hair.
“Ah ah ah,” the angel tells him in smooth admonition, “I’m not done with you yet.”
Well, okay, it wasn’t actually cheating, but it was definitely the nuclear option.
“And what seems to have caused that extremely pretty pout,” the angel inquired, then added just a little slyly, “I take great pride in being the only one who can cause you to sulk like that.”
Dean blinks a few times, trying to integrate the knowledge that somehow Gregor (it has to be Gregor, right?) not only knows how to read English, but has somehow managed to read the complete works of Carver fuckin’ Edlund, then told the stories to a group of rats who are legit fucking
“Hey bud,” he greets, starting the somewhat laborious task of clambering up the slightly too-tall stairs, “I’m sorry I didn’t bring you in any leftovers from breakfast.”  Gregor, who is practically vibrating with excitement while he waits for Dean and Cas to reach the top of the stairs, appears unbothered by the lack of a doggy bag (cockroach bag?).  As soon as Dean reaches the second floor, Gregor bonks his head affectionately against Dean’s shin, waggling his hind end.  Dean glances over his shoulder to find Cas barely suppressing a grin.
“Hey, where’s Cas?”
I'm gonna be straight with you (well, no I'm not, cause I've never been *straight* with anyone if you know what I'm saying), at this point I have pretty much one goal when it comes to this fic, and that goal is to finish it.  I'm ready for it to be off my plate, to make room for some new projects (and one long-awaited collaboration with my lovely wife and beta,
Cas offers no response to this small sound beyond another one of those soft, dark chuckles.  Dean can see in his mind the coolly amused expression that accompanies that laugh, and his cock gives a little twitch at the image.
but that was a whole other story).
ought to, don’t you think?” the angel hissed, eyes narrowing to slits, “since you clearly cannot be trusted to ensure your own safety or, for that matter, that of your brother.  Do you,” he went on, clearly not looking for an answer to that first question, “have
“Too late,” Cas growls in Dean’s ear, and then Sam is just gone, and Dean blinks stupidly at the place where his brother used to be.  He wants to not care, because that growl does
Sam had retreated shortly after dinner, apparently still uneasy about being even that close to the kitchen, muttering something about calling it an early night.  Dean figured he’d give him a day or two to calm down before admitting that he’d just been fucking with Sam.
These musings have taken no more than ten seconds, and Michael seems to feel that’s long enough to let the tension build.  “Say ‘yes, sir,’” he coaches Dean, almost gently, and Dean has to swallow twice, his mouth presumably too dry with horror to get the words out at first.
“Afraid I ain’t got keys to your manacles.  Can you hold it a bit longer?  I can see about finding who’s holding onto those keys, but best to hold off ‘til we’ve got some food and water into you.”
“Thirty,” Cas finishes, satisfaction in his voice.  “Very good.  Now stay right there.  I’ll be with you in a moment.”
“—and it’s a Colombian forest spirit.  They lead hunters deep into the forest and eat them.”
“Oh, uh, no,” Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever backtracked faster in his life—and not only because the appearance of what he secretly thought of as Cas’s ‘Dom brow’ was a sure sign that he should tread very carefully.  “No, not objecting at all, I was just…you know, eager.  I can’t help it that you’re so dead sexy.”  He was hoping to at least earn a chuckle, but instead he got a distinctly unimpressed face.
“Okay, I’m going to take point, you bring up the rear.  It doesn’t sound like he’s even capable of violence right now, let alone considering it, but we’re safer not assuming anything off the bat.  No weapons, but stay alert.”  Cas was staring at him, head tipped slightly to one side, brow furrowed, and Dean groaned, demanding, “
His own voice was still a little slurry, but nevertheless firm enough.
and there were cool hands on him, cupping his face, gripping his shoulders, wrapping tightly around him, drawing him in close to the impossibly solid, intimately familiar chest.  Cas was dripping, sopping, water streaming down over him, soaking through the sweatpants and long-sleeved tee, but he didn’t seem to care.  Dean let it happen, let himself be dragged against Cas’s chest, drawn into his lap, cradled like a baby, like someone precious—and it wasn’t true, none of it was true, he wasn’t any of the things that Cas’s strong arms seemed to suggest, but he was too weak to do what he ought to and draw away.  Much too weak to reject the offer of comfort, even if he was woefully unworthy of it.  His thoughts continued to spiral out of control, dragging him through the mud of his own self-hatred, threatening to pull him under for good and drown him in their quicksand.
Seconds later, another baby wipe very gently cleaned between his cheeks.  Cas was careful not to disturb the screaming flesh any more than necessary, but Dean still wasn’t able to restrain the tiny whimpers the contact jerked from him.  After a moment even that contact was gone.  One hand settled on the top of his head and rested there as soft sounds rang out just to his left.  It took a moment before Dean realized that Cas was cleaning himself up now, wiping down his own stomach and dick.
A second later, the soft click of a cap sounded, immediately followed by the familiar slick sound.
“I think if you asked your—what, cousins? Brothers?—they’d say that this wasn’t cruelty so much as revenge for Raphael.  Ishim too, come to that, though that was some time ago.”
If Cas is worried about whether or not Dean will make it, he needn’t be.  The cock spearing him draws back and surges forward only twice more (smacking into Dean’s ass with a meaty sound and a force that rivals that of his punishing palm) before Dean comes, streaking the wall in front of him liberally, fighting to stay on his feet under the combined force of merciless thrusts and his own powerful orgasm.
“Like Bilbo,” Dean mutters to Cas, who swats his arm lightly.
test me.”
Zachariah and his men are like to be back first thing tomorrow, now at the outside edge of when they were expected to return, and as soon as Zachariah gets back, the first order of business will be doing away with Dean Winchester and making sure his battered remains are found by his kin.  And that means Michael is just about out of time.
“It’s not
Cas tipped his head to one side as he listened, his eyes searching Dean’s face avidly, as if trying to determine whether he was being entirely truthful.  Dean huffed out a low breath in frustration and spoke up again, before Cas could interject.
So it’s over.
“Your color, Dean?”
“I have, as I said, nothing but time,” Gregor tells him with characteristic good humor, “and it would seem a shame to waste these hours in which we can communicate verbally, would it not?”
Cas’s free hand immediately seized one of Dean’s nipples, worrying it between his fingers until it stood proudly at attention.  He wasted no time in fastening the simple metal clamp on it, making Dean hiss out a barely-stifled curse.
going to stay put?  Have you
They fell into the rhythm, then, Cas driving into him, body hovering just inches above Dean’s own.  Dean was panting, unable to produce any real sounds until the moment when he found himself speaking, a demand and plea wrapped up together.
“Mmm, that is not what it sounded like to me, but for the sake of your ass—which is still a rather lovely shade of pink, incidentally, a color that is only enhanced by the purple accents,” sure enough, bruising is starting to rise apparently, “we will let this one slide.  What do you say?”
His brow furrows as he tries to sort it out, but all he can come up with is the certainty that Sam’s hair had been replaced by creamed spinach, styled into some pretty absurd shapes (he’s pretty sure a unicorn figured into it somehow) and that Sam had been trying really hard to convince Dean that it was all the rage and he should really give it a try too.  He’d been arguing that the creamed spinach hair was impractical and messy and that mashed potato hair was where it was
Cas hummed wordless agreement before Dean heard the soft tread of his shoes carrying him over to the pantry.  He finished up washing the second bowl and set it beside the first in the dish drainer before grabbing the sponge to wipe down the counters.  They probably didn’t need it, but making sure he left the kitchen spotless was a habit from one too many temp jobs short-order cooking to make sure there was enough to feed Sammy while Dad went off for weeks at a time.
“No, I do not,” Cas says, brow lifting, “Unless you wish to invoke your safeword.  Do you wish to you invoke your safeword?”
Finally, Dean opened his mouth and tried again.
.  I'm still very new and I need followers!  I'm nice! (I'm totally stealing that permanently,
“I’m okay, Mom, you can ease up on the hovering,” Sam tells him good-naturedly, allowing Dean to help him to a chair.  “It’s not like both of us haven’t been shot before, you know.  Not to mention the part where Cas healed me.”
“Yeah, I was pretty stoked to find it,” Dean agreed, then sat down across the table from Sam, digging into his own food.  Every minute or so he found his gaze straying back up to his brother, who was happily chowing down while gazing at his laptop.  When Sam glanced up and found Dean looking at him, he completely misinterpreted the cause of the gaze and smiled, answering the question Dean had in no way been asking.
Huh.  Maybe not such a good idea after all.  It felt about three times its normal size, and for a second he was a little woozy.  He put it back down.
It ain’t wolves—he knows what those howls sound like, and even if he didn’t, the fact that the howls quickly devolve into something that sounds suspiciously like
“—think he’s coming around.”
“How,” Dean demands, crouching to pat Gregor, “is it possible that you are this cute?”
“That’s why you love me.”
Dean rubbed his hands together in a moment of mad scientist glee.  “This is going to be so epic.”
“Son of a bitch!” he grumped, as Cas, lips twitching slightly, pulled him away from the door.
Dean grimaces a little.  He’s never been a big fan of being referred to as sassy.  Six-year-olds are sassy.  Young women are sassy.  Full-grown late-thirties six-foot-tall men are not sassy.  Of course, when Dean brought this up to Cas, the angel just quirked that signature brow at him and said simply, “when you stop sassing me, I will stop calling you sassy,” and that was that.
Chuck’s acolytes were bad enough.
The air of smug satisfaction around the angel when he finally releases Dean is so thick that Dean practically has to wade through it, but he doesn’t mind.  He loves that ready dominance, the ease with which Cas can take pretty much any situation and neatly turn it on its head, putting himself back in perfect control of both Dean and…well, pretty much everything else.
this.  And Castiel knew it.  The voice that came out of the angel next was an entirely different one, nearly a growl.
“Rinse,” Castiel advises him, and Dean does, swishing the water around and then spitting it to one side.  “Again…?” Castiel half tells, half asks, and Dean nods, accepting another mouthful of water and rinsing once more before he spits again.  “Wanna drink some, too?” Castiel asks after Dean pauses to breathe for a moment, and Dean nods once more.  Carefully, tipping the canteen back for brief moments and pausing as long as necessary in between, Castiel helps Dean to drink most of the rest of it, and by the time the canteen is nearly empty, the bitter taste is gone from his mouth and his stomach has reluctantly agreed to hold onto its contents.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s as public as it gets for you at the moment,” Sam argues, fishing around in his pocket absently and producing a somewhat squashed and slightly melted looking hunk of cheese.  Okay,
“Oh, no, no, no, sweet boy,” Jesus, something about the endearments was absolutely terrifying, “you put that pretty mouth on offer.  It’s unspeakably rude to try to take that back, in word or in gesture.”
love you need you want you, please please please, Cas, please, love you,” there’s a desperate sincerity to his words, the outward manifestation of how deeply they are felt.  He’s begging, but he couldn’t say what he’s begging for, just that whatever it is, Cas will give it to him.  Cas knows what he needs even when he can’t articulate it or just plain isn’t sure.
“Lucifer’s gone.”
Dean sighed, “Looks like about 2/3rds of the way.  So…sandwiches then?”
Cas?  Getting a little stereotypical, aren’t we?”  He was proud of how steady his voice sounded, although he knew perfectly well that Cas could read the mammoth force of will it took.
“Is that, while we are relieved that catching us in the act is no longer as discomfiting for you as it may have once been, and while I would never state that I have not benefited from your willingness to help me work through challenges, even when they center upon Dean’s and my sex life,” Dean, who knew perfectly well what conversation Cas was referring to, barely remembered at the last moment that he wasn’t supposed to know, and threw a sharp glance at Cas in deference to this.  Sam, meanwhile, was nodding along with Cas, suggesting that Cas’s strategy was a better one than Dean’s.  This came as a surprise to nobody, least of all Dean, who tuned back in as Cas went on, “our sex life is perhaps the most
That about did it for Dean.  He dissolved back into uncontrollable laughter, a tear or two actually escaping as he shook helplessly.  Cas leaned over the table, pressing his head against Dean’s, and in a moment Dean could feel him chuckling too.  It took a long time before Dean started to calm down, the effects of adrenaline from the strapping, from Sam’s entry, from the combined fury of both Sam and Cas possibly adding a small edge of hysteria that took a little longer to recover from.  Finally he was hiccuping and gasping, lips still twitching but the peals of laughter that shook his entire body complete.
With a glance between roach and angel, Dean drinks the potion.
Dean’s never living this down, is he?  Sam’s forever gonna be able to hold over his head that he cleaned up Dean’s tiny, hamster-sized shit.  Because eventually he’s gonna
Finally breaking eye contact, Dean leaned forward and set pen to paper.  He started to write, pausing halfway through the line to look back up at Cas in wordless question.
“You know,” Cas says thoughtfully, “I believe I would like to take my time with you, and as lovely as you look in this particular position, it does not lend itself to stamina.  Stretch out on your stomach, if you please.”
“Indeed.  I am the authority on many things—which I will be more than pleased to tell you about once we have finished this conversation, which you have been rather effectively distracting me from.”
Stuart pauses just long enough to narrow his eyes slightly at Dean before going back to his thoroughly disgusting meal.  Cas shrugs, shaking his head and peeling off his cheese-smeared trenchcoat with a grimace.  “Stuart, I think we will leave you to your snack for the present, lest you destroy Dean’s appetite for weeks to come.”
“Hold up,” Dean said, knowing that interrupting Cas right after asking for more information was a dick move, but startled enough to want to make sure he was getting this right.  “They landed in 2004 for a 90 day mission and she only—”  shit, he had no idea how to word this, what did you say when a robot went belly up?? “—uh, died today?  Cas, that’s
Cas took a deep breath. "Well you see, I was leaving the store after the 'supply run' when I heard these plaintive cries, and of course I had to investigate because all God's creatures are very important it is my duty to assist them, and I found... Him." Cas hoisted the little bundle of fur up to Dean's face for inspection. Still processing this odd turn of events and how it related to his and Cas' impending break-up, Dean lifted a hand to prod the gray lump. With a soft growl, two golden eyes met his and Dean was inexplicably confronted with a cat. A rather small, wet cat, but definitely a cat nonetheless. Now Dean was really confused.
They were brave, and loyal, and kind, and selfless, but most of all, they were heroes.
"...Cas? What've you got there?"
“I haven’t found anything,” Dean says, looking up at his brother.
Dean looks at his angel, and then down at the little ball of fur between them. The cat fixes its huge eyes on Dean, who smiles down at it. Isn't his life just hilarious? He spends hours panicking over his impending break-up, and at the end of the day, he and Cas are even more of a couple than before--they even have a damn
