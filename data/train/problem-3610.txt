“We have a selection of cookies, chips, and juices.  Do you have a favorite?”
“Alright.”  The deep whiskey-strained voice has Dean’s cock swelling, “Second, define marks.”
“Being here with you, feeling the weight of your body on mine.  I love this.  If the circumstances were different you’d be inside me,” gulping through a sob, “right now.”  Raising his hand Dean traces the alpha’s incisors with his pointer finger.  “Your teeth would have broken skin, marking me as yours.  All the other alphas chasing after me would be gone.  I am safe.  You’ve got more control over the others than you're giving yourself credit for and yet …there are rules.  I’m upset because I don’t get to decide when you mate me.”
“I know.”  Dean sighs, stretching his shoulders to relieve the building tension.  Half of him is thrilled that Cas is coming, but the other half is miserable over it.  At the club, Dante is on a proper stage with a clear separation between his angel and the audience.  This will not be the case on the tour.  The group will be staying in small, luxury lodges and ranches so the performances will be done in very close quarters.  Charlie has requested poles to be constructed at the lodges, but the private homes will be even worse.  Meg and Cas will be dancing on dining room tables, or just the ground itself.  Dean’s not sure he can survive Crowley and his gang having such intimate proximity to what’s his.
Sam tosses his head about trying to get Dean’s attention, but the Omega’s eyes are on the floor.  “Dean, I was trying to free you.”
Benny helps direct Chuck’s hobbling towards the fire truck.
Grabbing the front of the omega’s shirt, Cas yanks, forcing Dean to trip forward into the solid block of alpha. “I want to remove those clothes with my teeth and lick you from the tips of your toes to the top of your ears and everything in between.” Dean can’t breathe as Cas slides his head to the right, “Would that be naughty?”
When their lips separate, Cas speaks, “We go together to Montana.  I help you murder Azazel, and we can take the hands if we must.  However, after it’s done you stop killing.  If you truly feel the business must go on then teach someone to take your place.  God, Dean you could teach a dozen young Omegas willing to take on the quest.”
Both sound like the perfect start.
The dom kisses his forehead, “My sweet boy likes to be pretty. I think both of those suit you exquisitely.”
Cas is so full of rage he’s shaking, and so the Omega looks to Dr. B with pleading eyes.
A smirk sneaks across his alpha’s lips, “We have been so …busy I haven’t finished my preparations for tomorrow.”
Once Dean senses he’s back in reality, he snatches Castiel’s shoulders, shoving an image along with a thought over their skin.
“Please. I wrote the messages as your equal, now answer me as your Kitten because this life, our future will hold both.”
This is all Cas.
“Why are we discussing pets at freaking six in the morning?”  Dean rubs his eyes.
Castiel, always the one to follow orders, does just that and pounds into Dean’s channel.  The noise of slapping skin against leather is driving Dean crazy.  Cas’s cock is filling him deep, hitting all the right places.  The fucking is so rough Dean has to hold on with both hands to stay upright.  His lover’s lips roam over Dean’s shoulder’s and neck, halting sporadically to suck until there is surely a mark.
With thirty seconds on the clock Cas raises his arm bellowing, “95 thousand!”
“Who’s your …friend?”  Meg trails her gaze up and down Charlie’s little frame.  “Red is my favorite color.”
“Yes.”  Dean walks back to the door, throwing the security bar, “No one gets a peek.”
The second Andy sees the van his eyes go wide as he screeches, “Oh dude, this is perfect!”  The younger omega opens the side door, shouting, “Fuck me, this is awesome!”  Andy pops his head out. “No canola oil in here though; it’ll ruin the interior.”
“Shouldn’t I wait, here?”  The nerves washing off the man are overwhelming.
The next item in the bag is a long red cloak with a hood. “Is this a scent blocking cloak?”
Eventually, his breathing calms enough to speak, “Cas.  I’m okay.”
Green eyes meet blue as tears streak down his husband’s cheek. Swooping up, Dean places his lips over Cas’s, kissing the other man with everything he has, expressing all the emotions swirling under his skin for this beautiful man that he gets to call his husband.  When they eventually part, Dean snickers, “We still haven’t finished the bottle of strawberry lube.  Wanna try?”
Sam’s hazel eyes glaring at him brings Dean back to his senses.
“I love you,” he replies.  Peering into those emerald gems that give him strength to be the alpha Dean deserves.  Goodness, handsome doesn’t even begin to describe the many stunning qualities that this omega holds.  “Have fun.”
The older omega tuts softly. “You know as well as I do that nothing will block their connection when the boy’s heat hits.”
Nothing else matters except making it to shore.  Dean is safe, but God damn it Castiel wants to touch his silky omega’s flesh again, to drag his fingers over the increasing swell of Dean’s stomach. His arm tires first, the muscles cramping.  There is no other option but to kick harder, battling the tide trying to push him out to the ocean. Cas pauses to catch his breath, not spotting either Sam or Gabriel.  Perhaps he’s been swimming in the wrong direction, but looking over his shoulder he can faintly make out the huge, engulfing flames of the cottage.  Keep that behind him and he’ll be fine.
Glancing over his shoulder, the omega watches Gadreel and Eileen.  They’ve got a notebook between them and appear to be writing little notes.  Eileen’s giggling as they tussle over the shared pencil.  In any other instance he would call them smitten.  However, their fate isn’t truly theirs, which is total bullshit.
On the next exhale strong arms are lifting him bridal style.  Dean holds onto broad shoulders as sobs keep him from explaining anything more.  It seems he did enough.
Man, Dean has to step closer because unless his math is bad, this lady’s 56 years old.  Angels age much slower than mortals.  He’d heard the stories; however, seeing it first hand is totally different.
Balthazar cracks a grin.  “Well, according to Dean’s blood work, we have a few weeks until his next heat so there is time to decide.  However, there is a home remedy that can often have excellent results with a newly mated Omega suffering from this condition.”
“I think you may be missing a few steps, Castiel.  Dean’s neck looks smooth and clean from here,”  Sam counters coldly.
“I’m not afraid, Dean.” Castiel responds, his jaw strong. He has to convince his alpha not to push him away. All these strides have been healthy and a long time coming. The thought of moving backwards might destroy the omega.
Dean finally scents the room and realizes there are three distinct Omega smells in the room.  “Oh my God, you’re one of us.”
The post claiming party derives from centuries ago when alphas would claim their Omega’s in public. Performing the act in the town square, and then there would be a huge bon fire and roasting of an animal for good luck. Today’s version is much more civilized. First, the act of claiming is done in privacy and the parties range from backyard BBQ’s to massive million dollar affairs. Michael sent over the guest list, and so far and it has 300 people on it. This number will get bigger once Cas and Dean add to it, thus the need for a very large space.
Cleaning guy hands back the phone, Dean and Cas taking a glance.
The pain strikes Dean first. It is excruciating. His stomach is twisting and turning as the muscles contract, making his eyesight go blurry. Damn it, his heat came early. Fucking curse of false heat, but where is Cas? The cringing Omega reaches out looking for his mate, but instead of soft cotton sheets and a warm lover, he finds a cold basement floor. He opens his eyes and desperately tries to focus on anything, but his vision is fuzzy, almost like he’s in a drug induced state.
His favorite nurse snags Dean’s hand as Missouri waves at Castiel on the dance floor to get his attention before she leads them over to the towering wedding cake as their guests make a horseshoe around them.  Before anything else happens Dean needs to feel those lips on his and does just that, kissing his husband hard until they can’t breathe.  Catcalls and whistles bounce across the air when they split.
Tightening his grip on Dean’s dick, he builds the pace, matching it with the driving force of his tongue.  His Omega is screaming loudly, panting hard as he cums, shooting his load to the sheets below.  Only then does Cas rise to his knees, lining up his cock with Dean’s hole, thrusting in with one swift push.  There is barely any resistance as he bottoms out with a grunt.
As he looks at his mom’s face, Dean’s easy-going morning vanishes.  “I would appreciate it if you called before dropping by.”
“Perfectly, Kitten.” Castiel growls, yanking his fingers from Dean’s hole, and then quickly replacing them with something so much better. He whines as his dom penetrates him gradually, reverently.
“Uncle Castiel kicked Naomi’s butt.  It took Gadreel, Crowley, and Jody to pull him off of his own aunt.  The entire time he kept growling like he was suddenly all alpha.”  She punches him jovially in the arm.  “He protected you.”
Fergus Crowley MacLeod stands in the middle of the black décor of the torture suite.  The matriarch next to him both express shock at Dean’s sudden appearance.  However, the man tied to a metal chair in the center of the room catches the omega’s eye.
Gadreel and Cas are walking behind the Sheriff as they head to her vehicle.  Once all three alphas are in, Mills curses, “Shit, I left Krissy’s paperwork in the conference room.  You will need that to take her home Gadreel.”
Wiping away her stream of tears, Dean kisses her cheek. “You’re too young to be my mom.”
Well, that was completely inappropriate. Clearly, the beast only wants his omega since he keeps chanting about it. Cas grabs Charlie’s hand, “Pause it.” Pivoting to view Dean he ventures, “Do you know what you’re saying?”
Leaning in closer, he sniffs the bite mark on Dean’s flesh.  A hint of apples from his own personal aroma lingers and will forever.  The thought leaves a smile on his stupid face.  What a dorky Alpha!  Claiming his Omega settles a great unknown in his soul.  Daphne never felt right.  She was a fine Omega and a good mate, yet Castiel suspected for a long time there was something missing.  A chunk of him that belonged to someone else.  He was meant for Dean.
Meg inhales deeply, “You are the first person Castiel has ever shown any interest in. There is something about you that connects with Clarence. I don’t think there is a single person in this place that wants to stand in the way of that beautiful boy’s happily ever after.” She cocks a whimsical eyebrow, “Anything else?”
“Yes.”  Cain dips his head, exiting quickly.
“An overdose of LSD, Samandriel must have spiked several of your juice boxes thinking you would only drink one.” Cas pulls Dean’s fingers to his lips, kissing every knuckle. “If Hannah hadn’t forced you to expel the juice, you may not have survived.”
Words, swirls of words blow through his thoughts.  Not a single one does justice to the level of thanks he has for his lover, his forever, his Castiel.  He wipes a tear away.  “My world without you, Cas,” he tilts his husband’s chin so their gazes lock, “is nothing but grey.  Thank you for all the colors of the rainbow.”
“She needs a diaper change.” Dean cackles as he hears his brother’s quiet reply.
Reluctantly, it’s Cas who pauses to appease his shouting lungs. Panting, he stutters, “Next heat, we start trying for a baby.”
Grabbing the back of Castiel’s neck, Dean slams his lips against the other man’s mouth with brutal force. Cas pushes right back, ramming the driving instructor up against the wooden slabs as Novak takes control of the deep, rough kiss. God, it is everything Dean needs in that moment. Their tongues lash out at each other in a savage intensity. Between the alcohol in his blood stream and Cas’s lips on his, the conversation with Sam evaporates.
He clicks on the late 90s television set, flipping to the weather channel.  At least it's another voice in the space.  Digging through his small pantry, Castiel searches through the canned food for dinner.  It's been a month since anyone brought any rations; he ate the last of his fresh vegetables ten days ago.  A couple chickens and a slab of beef remain in the outside freezer.  He’s too tired for any real cooking, so the Alpha snatches a can of beef stew to heat on the stove.
Comments, questions and concerns delight me.
“Cas, chill on the sweet talk.  I’m yours, no need for fanfare.”  Dean’s head falls forward, enjoying Cas’s ministrations on his sore body.  Those talented fingers halt.  Nothing happens for several seconds; once a minute passes Dean cracks open his eyes, turning back to his alpha.  Castiel appears frozen in shock.  “What the hell man, you ok?”
Holding up his pointer finger, Gabe responds, “First, my mom’s a royal bitch who put her own relationship fails on her children and two.” The spa owner tosses up a second finger, “Little Cassie is worth a cool three million.”
“Very,” both omegas respond.
“Yeah,” the blonde omega supplies, “Harry and I mated twins.  They are the gatekeepers for the entrance to Purgatory.”
They find themselves falling to the floor in a fit of giggles because every expression Gadreel tries he just looks more surprised and shocked.
“We can eat lunch together," Sam suggests as his feet inch towards the door, trying to hurry along his exit. “Bye, Hannah, Inias.”
Two thick chains are bolted to the back wall with shackles on one end hanging off of Dean’s wrists. His alpha is nude. Something aches within the omega at seeing Dean naked for the first time in this environment. Castiel wishes he could unsee it, but there is no turning back now. The cell is completely bare forcing his alpha to kneel on the brutal cement. Dean’s cock is erect, straining from the burning need of his rut. The pained look on the alpha’s face sends tears onto Castiel’s cheek. He would give anything to comfort his alpha, lowering his body in the submissive omega pose with his bottom in the air and his lips to the ground.
Lips crash into his as Castiel assaults Dean’s mouth.  The kiss is rough and wild, all tongues and teeth, in the same moment Castiel uses the wounded hand to stroke Dean’s cock.  Holy Shit!  The omega is completely astray in the magnificent ministrations of his alpha; his tongue lighting up with want as Cas’s hand pumps his cock, rubbing it down with the alpha’s own blood.
“What?”  Gutted.  Dean stumbles back as if he’d been struck.  “Cas, we love each other.”
“CAS?” Dean yells.  “What the hell man?”
A high-pitched shriek is the mist’s reply.
He’s seen some terrible shit.  These trials are brutal, and Bela’s been wearing battle scars from the system for years.  She’s a victim.  Dean would never blame her for attempting to wheel and deal her way out of their shared hellhole.
Placing his hands on her shoulders, Dean leans into the Alpha’s face, “You should be.  Don’t worry, by sundown you’ll change your tune.”
“I adore you, Gabriel, but right now I want to snap that keyboard in two.”  Castiel stares at the expensive piece of equipment with disdain.
A sharp stab to his arm jolts Dean awake.  He’s screaming and fighting several different arms trying to hold him down.
Later, as Cas is untying Dean and guiding him gracefully to the floor, the sub thinks aloud, “Maybe we should get a pet?”
His lover stirs, raising his face and flashing Dean with his blue beauties. “Dean! You’re awake.”
Humming softly, his husband pauses to listen.  One of the best things about Castiel Novak, he always believes in what’s important to Dean.  No discussions, no need to explain, Cas absorbs Dean’s words and has faith in their truth.  It’s liberating.  Definitely a reason he fell in love with the man.
A large, bearded gentleman climbs into the car, a wide grin lighting up his face.  In a heavy Cajun accent the guy remarks, “Mornin’ you must be Dean?”
Dean bristles at the implications to her comment.  “Actually, Sam has the office next to mine at the Bellagio Casino, where we work, and his house sits next to mine.  That way our kids don’t have to cross the street.”
“You need a physical reminder that you belong.  Not to mention Hannah will flip her shit with the prospect of putting together a family portrait you actually request.”  Gabe flips his light brown hair back dramatically, “I’m a healer.  Let’s say this could be good for the entire pack.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean grunts, “Cas, you don’t have a selfish bone in your body. You build bee gardens for Christ sake.”
“Dean, I can’t-” he felt feathers on his back, dark gray wings enfolding him. “Hold back,” Cas finished.
. He lost himself in them, tracing gold labyrinths through them until he rather forgot that Cas was staring back at him through them. When he remembered, his breath caught in his chest and he said, mouth dry, “Fuck you’re beautiful.”
Dean was past arguing terminology, and so he thrust inside Cas, letting out a blissed out moan at how much wetter it was now, wet with his own come.
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
“You said it last, it doesn’t count.” This game sounded a lot more complicated than the name let on. “All right,” Sam said, “You go over there and close your eyes. Count to 100 and then shout, ‘I’m coming, ready or not.’” Dean completely failed to restrain his laugh at the innuendo. Sam sighed. “Then you come and find me and Cas. If you give up, you shout Ollyollyoxenfree.” Was it just him, or was Sam actually
“Come on, get in the car.” Dean closed the matter and opened the impala door, letting the Bob Seger song which had been confined to the car play through the street.
He closed his mouth. Opened it. Closed it. "I heard you screaming," he said. "When you lost your wings."
He sat down on the Impala gingerly, watching me like I was a wild animal.
“I miss dreaming,” Cas commented, laying his head on Dean’s chest.
I cut him off. "The only thing I think we have left, Dean, is each other. If you say it’s time to go out in a blaze of glory, win or lose, so be it. I’m in. But then…” I smiled at the ground, before darting my eyes up to him. I wasn't about to let him die thinking my pain, my inevitable death, was on his hands. "That’s just how I roll," I said.
And here you have a chapter based on the only Metallica song I can stand. Which was, incidentally, my first boyfriend's (ex now, obviously) favorite song. I have seriously mixed feelings about it as a consequence, but listened to it again recently and felt like it had a seriously Dean vibe. So, you have the awkward weirdo who broke up with me in the cafeteria to thank for this one! XD
Anyways.
So this story isn't going to devolve into meaningless smut. It's just going to have a lot of meaningful smut. Don't they deserve it after all this? Enjoy ;)
, and repeat it again and again until he remembered the words. I thought this was apt.
“Okay. It’s thin but it’s enough. But how do they get out?” Sam asks.
But what took his breath away was Cas standing underneath a tree, reaching up with one hand and cupping a cluster of blossoms between his long fingers, staring up at them in pure wonder. It was an expression Dean had seen Cas wear on a few occasions before. It was so goddamn innocent it never ceased to make Dean’s heart stumble and stutter in his chest.
Of course, it was immediately followed by
Sam drove to Eileen's the second he's welcomed them home and made sure they're okay. Jack left to rebuild Heaven: to grow up like every child does. Cas helped him, his powers returning, the beat of wings in the bunker always announcing his return. Castiel, self-hating angel of Thursday, became heaven's new architect. Jack came home on the weekends. Sometimes he answered prayers, or just sat for hours in a park, letting himself become every one of the raindrops. The four of them bounced between shady motel rooms, never giving up on saving people. Between heaven and Rowena's new hell, between their separate lives and days on the beach watching the ocean. Watching the world they saved. They made their own families, and fought tooth and claw for them. When the end finally came, it was a blaze of glory, but one that never could have cast light without love as its fuel.
he wanted to say. “What, Dean didn’t teach you about Christmas? What happened to ‘human stuff’? Or was that just code for sex?”
And Dean surrenders to that voice. Folly to fight an angel, anyway.
Cas found him a few hours later, a bit after seven in the morning. Cas appeared in the middle of the room, hair sticking up in all directions, light flashing off the bronze penny that lay against his collarbone. He was shirtless and wearing one of Dean's pairs of sweatpants, because that was how they slept. Dean knew he really oughta tell the guy to put clothes on, for Sammy's sake, but also couldn't bear to. "Dean?" Cas asked.
A few minutes later the coast is clear.  Charlie jumping in with, “Well that was not expected.  I was picturing she’d be out of Lawrence in a year when you're healthy again.  You know, try to get her nursing license back.  Maybe, you should see if she would prefer the alternative option.  Crowley works miracles.”
“I’m going to say hello.”  Dean’s got manners, and the poor omega looks bored to tears.
“I don’t know,” Dean lies. God how pathetic, he can’t even be honest about always screwing himself out of anything good.
“No!  He will just come back, and his trip’s important.”  Dean would take on ninja alpha himself so Crowley can complete the end of his trip: bringing Cain to Sugar Mountain.
Putting on the fakest smile in his arsenal, Castiel pops his head out the front door.  “Hey Benny, I was up checking on Dean and thought you might want some caffeine.”
At the chorus, Cain adds his vocals the three men belting out the words.
“Quit being a drama queen about it, and I will help you.”  He speaks over the soft drill noise of his work.  “You will be gone the month of June, correct?”
“That might be true, with your repressed sexuality and love for an emotionally stunted hottie.”  Dean has to give the guy pointers for nailing that one pretty close to home.  The shorter man peers over Dean’s arm, spotting the dancer.  “Castiel kicked you out of the love nest, and now you’re stalking him?’
Raising her notebook, Amara places it between the brothers.  “Okay, you two could play the what if game for hours.  Let’s get back to the original question.  Dean, what are your reservations about teaching Sam?”
“I don’t know, what’s happening here, Cas?” Dean asks softly, using his finger to pull the man’s face to his. “Other than under this tree, I have never felt so at home.”  He drops a kiss to the top of Castiel’s forehead, murmuring, “It scares me.”
When her eyes re-open they are pure white as she tosses the flame into the bowl.  Its contents igniting in a bright flash.  Once again, her hands lift to the heavens as she cries out, “Benedicite unionem in.  Obligavit animam sanguinis coniunctio.”
“Mr. Novak, may I show Dean to the locker room?”
“Hold on one minute, you don’t think it's multiple personalities?”  His shoulders are facing Charlie as he's completely shocked by the revelation.  Jody has never agreed to the possession theory.
“How did executing Lucifer develop into a successful business?”
Exactly one minute later, Castiel hears the clomping of boots; up the stairs and down the hall. The footsteps halt just inside their bedroom entrance. He quivers slightly as Castiel draws his lingering gaze up his alpha’s hard, gorgeous body. Jesus, he truly is one lucky omega, for this man loves him, protects him, respects him, and also looks like a Greek god. Dean’s wearing a nice, form fitting pair of black jeans with a green button up. The omega grins, Dean dressed up for him.
The angel turncoat pulls away from Dick, smiling yet it doesn’t reach her eyes.  Castiel prays deep down that Hester feels how this is all a game and there is no love.  Hester tips into his space. “I’ve been promised the final blow in killing your precious Dean Winchester.  Slicing his swollen stomach.”
Closing his eyes, Castiel valiantly tries to reach his Dean through their bond.  If the Leviathan have abused the connection then he might as well use it for good.  Unfortunately, the block on his powers halts the link before it ever leaves his own body.
While folding the finished pork mixture into the six-inch egg roll wrappers, a scratching noise gives him pause.  The clock on the oven reads 8:05 p.m.  Castiel shouldn’t be home for an hour, but Dean’s positive he hears something from the staircase.
Dean has been dreading this pre-production meeting for weeks.  His next trip is to the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina.  Winchester Brothers will be hosting a seven-day camp for beginner hunters.  The adult campers will have seminars taught by Dean and Sam over basic level stuff; care and maintenance of rifles, tracking, shooting, and safety.  He really enjoys the teaching part, but the stupid cameras come along to film the entire week.  Last year, Sam endured a ‘showmance’ that shot up ratings, but did not end well.  Neither of them have any interest in repeating that mistake.  Two days ago, Charlie got a phone call that Naomi, the executive producer for the show, would be joining them for the meeting.  This is not good.  She usually does all her stuff over the phone from LA.  Having her personally attend puts everyone on red alert.
Hope tickles at Dean’s toes.  A sensation he’s never allowed but maybe, just maybe his dream comes to life. “Hey, Cas can we talk about something?”
“Good.”  He plants another kiss to Dean’s forehead as Ed opens the door for them.
With tears in his eyes, Cas finally mumbles, “Thank you, for the promise.”
Castiel rises to face Dean toe to toe, “Insulting?  You two treat us like fragile children that can’t care for ourselves.  That, in itself, is insulting.”  His angel is shouting, his volume getting louder with each word.  “Meg and I were perfectly fine way before the Winchesters ever arrived.”
Wiping a single tear, Dean stands, brushing dirt from his butt, “I’ll check on breakfast.  Cas, maybe you can show Emma the bee hive?”
Removing his backpack, Dean opens the main compartment, retrieving the rope.  He hastily unzips his snowsuit, slipping the loaded dart gun into the holster, then the Omega scales the tree.  Ever since he was a child Dean Winchester loved to climb anything he saw as a challenge.  He also wanted to be a Cowboy.  God, he and Sam would play Cowboys for hours chasing imaginary cows and lost horses.  Lassos are easy.  Using the loop to snag the chimney takes several tries and a few cuss words.  He ties the open end around the trunk of the tree for support.
A wicked itch zings through his flesh.  The haze remains in his mind, swirling in tandem with the black, ducking for cover into the warmth of a gentle voice.  Dean prickles a bit, although right now the discomfort is manageable.
Five minutes later Ruby 2.0 returns not dressed for court.  “I’m sorry Dean with the emergency I need to stay here so the first can—“
“I am not addicted to death.”  The words stutter softly from his lips.  “I do not love killing.”
“Nope you’re thinking of Samandriel and Inias. Me, I love the stuff; it has such fond memories.”  With that Gabriel takes another huge bite, the juice running down his chin.
Cas erupts in laughter that settles into a coughing fit. Suddenly a pinching sensation radiates from his ribs, but when he calms, the pain dissipates. “My alpha.”
Dean’s chugging a bottle of water in the kitchen when the sounds of kitten heels on the hardwood floors alerts him to Meg’s entrance.
------
A cheerful smile dances across Meg’s face as they arrive at Beaufort Elementary, her love of learning clearly a trait from Sam. He’s signing her in when Ms. Braeden steps forward with a scowl on her face. Thankfully, Meg has skipped off to the block corner. “Mr. Winchester, we had this discussion last week. Tutus are not appropriate for school. Elementary is a more structured learning environment then pre-school, and you should dress your niece accordingly.”
Stretching out his hand, Dean’s fingers trace the etching in the tree.  Castiel loves Dean.  A shaky heart encircles the mark left behind by his alpha.  He was here.  Once again Dean reaches out through their bond, only finding shadows and silence.  It’s been two days, and Cas has yet to reply.  The tree’s bark creaks as a vicious wind blows through its branches.
“I want to help.”
“Cas, man, what the hell is going on?”
Following the gurney taking Amara to the hospital, Dean turns the corner of the house and freezes in shock.  There have to be easily a hundred Omegas.  Several stations have been created using tables from the Halloween town fair.  One still holds a sign for The Dunking Booth.  Two tables have people drawing anti-possession symbols on people’s wrists, two more are passing out breakfast, another one is handing out small black pouches, and finally at the front is a sign-in table.
“Seriously?”  Sam squeaks.
“That’s final Anna.”
The other omega sits down again, filling out the purchase forms for the ring while they wait. Eventually, curiosity gets the better of Cas so he inquires, “You aren’t from Texas?”
Up until now the lack of sound hasn’t been an issue, but the omega’s pretty damn sure moaning is a must in sexual situations.  He jerks his head back curiously glancing at Cas.  The alpha tips his head to the side, mirroring the questioning look.
Before Cas can register the movement, Dean rushes up to the omega’s face, kissing him passionately, letting his fingers roam all over the Castiel’s exposed flesh. His alpha pauses at Cas’s neck, inhaling deeply, “Your scent is intoxicating, little omega. I just want to climb under your skin and live forever.”
I love hearing from my readers.  FYI:  I tried working with Grammarly to perfect my editing skills.  I apologize if there are any glaring issues, grammar is my nemesis in life.
“Always.”  Slips from his husband as Ion wheels his bed out into the hall.
A few stray tears fall from the omega’s face. It wasn’t until this moment that Cas realized how much he longed to ride his handsome steed. The illusion of freedom that he gets galloping around the ranch always cheers up even the darkest hour.
“My hand on the Bible, I only know bits and pieces.”  Castiel nods in acceptance.  “My mom died from cancer when I was five and Dean was nine.  It was a long, hard battle, especially that last year.  Missouri came to live with us to help take care of her.  The beta was barely 21, but she had a gift that my mother believed would save this family.  She convinced my dad to let Missouri choose the omega vials for Dean to scent.”
“They took my ability to kill using my grace. I’ll be less useful on hunts..” Dean shook his head, hoping to reassure Cas with the gesture. Cas continued. “My ability to hear angel radio, to time travel, a few other things. I can still fly, and heal, and hear prayers. Taking those would have been… I would no longer have had any claim to the title of angel. I can pass into Heaven, but only through Joshua’s Garden, and I can never return there permanently, with the other angels. I am forbidden for seeking direct contact with other angels, but not from returning it. If I interfere with their plans in any way, I will be put to death. If I transgress in any way…” Cas waved a hand. “That’s not of import. If I have to stop them doing something, it will be important enough the consequences won’t matter.”
“Cas, you know I’m really not the person to ask about this stuff…” he began awkwardly.
“Uh, I don’t…” Dean’s voice felt husky, un-practiced. “What did we dream about?”
“As for where we should go, I was thinking everywhere.” Cas said easily.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice came from behind him. The angel’s arm was wrapped around Dean’s sudsy stomach, drawing circles in the bubbles there. The angel rocked against Dean’s ass, and Dean gasped as he felt Cas’ erection there. “I want you.”
“Hello, Dean.” Cas said, muffled against Dean’s chest.
Dean worked on the chair outside. It took a long time, because he didn't know really how to make a chair. Cas had asked that it be green, without ever explaining why. He just glanced where the charcoal heap had been on the ground, and smiled like he had his own private joke. Cas worked alongside him in the garden, taming the roses that tangled their own righteous path across the garden, watering the clumps of rosemary and the young apple tree. It took Cas a long time to get back to full strength, and sometimes, at the end of the day, Dean would carry him in and lay him down on the bed, panting and weak but smiling.
His pleasure at seeing me was not quite so pure. He asked, gawking, "What - why are you naked?" He waved a hand when a bee flew up to his face. "And why the fuck are there bees?"

Cas was silent for a moment. Then, “Hello, Dean.”
He kisses Dean, long and dirty and slow, and ruts against Dean’s hip until he’s hard. Then he pulls Dean’s hips to his face and licks his hole, spearing him open and getting him wet until Dean’s cock is twitching to life again too. Dean pants. Cas uses his grace to open him up, a warm, relaxing push that has Dean shuddering against the pillow.
“I was selfish,” Cas reflected, leaning into Dean. Dean waited for him. The rain got heavier, soaking the shoulders of Cas’ trenchcoat and running down Dean’s nose. “I… I think hubris is a consistent problem of mine. You’re going to die someday, Dean. You know what heaven is, a rerunning of your best memories. I’ve always found human memory strange. How it changes your memories, tinging them with things you now know and what you think now. I wanted your memories to be pure, independent of the future or the past. Every time you read the letter, it makes a different memory, one which won’t change because you can’t remember it now. When you’re in heaven… dead… you’ll remember a thousand times you read what I wrote to you, and what it meant every time.”
Their backs had been pressed against the side of the Impala, hunkering down and waiting for the inevitable blast wave of angry spirits. Cas had looked around at the world, closed his eyes and opened them on Dean, shining and blue and looking like they had the whole universe in them. The words had risen up unbidden, breaking through adrenaline and years of silence. The air was cold, and the words felt so hot on his lips he thought they must’ve burned his throat. His heart had beat so hard it hurt. “I love you.” Just like that.
Somewhere, the Empty is screaming. But underneath them, a glowing door is being cut into the blackness, and then they’re falling.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “I – uh. Okay. Sorry. I didn’t mean it that way.”
Dean woke up about an hour later, blinking and drawing Cas closer to him.
Dean stood and, glaring pre-emptively at Sam, made his way over to Cas. “Here.” He wrapped his arms around Cas, joining them at both hands so he could guide Cas’ arms. Like he’d do if he was teaching the guy how to shoot a rifle. “Like so. You hold it steady and then, just real quick-” He flipped the pancake up in the air and maneuvered the skillet to catch it. “See? Easy.”
“I wanted it for so long.” Dean says. “I want all of you, now that I know I can have you.”
Cas frowned, but evidently grasped Dean’s meaning. He scanned the bar, inhibitions forgotten. “Well, the redhead over there has very nice breasts, and the man by the pool table is attractive – oh, that blonde in the corner looks interesting, but Dean, I-”
“I want part of you inside when I come,” Dean admits in a tumble. “Not gonna be long.”
Dean rolled over gently, trying not to wake Cas as he deposited the sleeping angel on his back. As much as he wanted to be the first thing Cas saw when he woke up, they were both covered in sweat and cum and lube, and the room was… a disaster zone. Dean tip-toed away, careful not to cut his feet on broken glass. He came back with a broom, with which he promptly swept the shattered candles away. He stared at the window. It was gone. He could hear birds singing outside. “Fuck me,” he muttered, before remembering with a grin that that was exactly how his room had gotten this way. He picked up the bottle of lube off the floor, shaking his head at the scent, before pausing.
Sam smirked. “Come on, Dean. It wasn’t so hard to guess. All the times you couldn’t stand losing him. The awkward eye stares. I’ve known you my whole life, figuring you out isn’t exactly rocket science.”
The guitar work was rudimentary, scrambled, Cas wincing every time he changed chords and pressed his blistered fingers down into new strings. Dean still couldn’t believe this life, with the giant Christmas tree and the safe four walls around them, was his. But he could believe Cas was his now, and after all, that was what really mattered.
Take it!
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good.
Dean wanted to drown in that sound. He wanted to ask him to say it again. It couldn’t possibly be true, but he needed to hear it. The moment stretched. His throat closed up. No, no, fuck, it was happening again. He couldn’t talk. He’s not looking at Cas. He can’t bear the devotion on the angel’s face, not with the million and one ways he could fuck this up simply by being Dean Winchester racing through his mind.
Keep the love comin', let me know what you thought! Two chapters to go!
Matter-of-factly, Cas picked up the camera, turned to Dean, and pressed the shutter button. Dean hadn’t been paying attention, and had been staring dreamily at Cas. He flushed red. “What the hell, Cas?”
Michael’s cheeks go crimson as he interrupts Dean’s alpha.  “Explain to me about,” the alpha glances side to side then lowers his voice, “slow hands.”
“Meg and Castiel of course.”  The Scottish man cocks an eyebrow, waiting for the brother’s response.
Not sure what the hell set the pregnant lady off this time, Dean pats her shoulders, “If you have doubts, we can wait to make it official.”
Tilting forward tentatively, Dean whispers, “The address for your next john?”  Why would Dean know?
“Really?  Weren’t you pretty young when you met him?”  Dean’s fairly sure Hannah was his age when they met, maybe younger.
The last time he saw Dean was Friday night at The Devil’s Trap.  The hunter had to spend all of Saturday prepping for his trip, and then Castiel works until 4am on Saturday nights.  However, after a lengthy phone call the two men decided that Cas should visit Sunday after his shift, t
The counselor shakes Cas’s shoulder, “And?  Did she confront you?”
The two men laugh for a bit, then return to a comfortable silence. Dean shuts his eyes, sighing.  This place isn’t so bad; three home cooked meals a day, entertainment, exercise, and of course there’s Castiel.  Yeah, Dean could easily spend the next 8 months here.  Although, he does want to ask Sam how much it’s running him, because he’s no free loader.  He plans to pay Sam back.
“It’s a nice day, we can walk home.” Castiel suggests.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel just stares at the wall, letting the harsh reality of today’s events wash over him. He wishes that he could hold onto the hope Hannah provided, but his fingers, along with the rest of his body, hurts. He hasn’t taken a painkiller all day. Castiel decides it’s not worth the effort. Life as an omega is terrible. At some point, it seems to touch them all.
“What?”  That’s when Dean becomes aware that Cas has been rubbing his own dick through his jeans.  “I can’t…”  He is suddenly cold, regardless of the temperature outside.  The hunter’s hands tremble over the mere suggestion.
Rain pummels Dean’s body, drenching his black t-shirt and jeans.  If another alpha has somehow gotten into his mind, why the theatrics?  How would he know to hide?  Unless …that’s the alpha’s kink.  Fear.  Attempting a strong powerful tone, he shouts, “Who’s out there?”
Why in the hell did he wait five years to tell Sam the truth?
He smells his armpits and doesn’t notice even a hint of the burning pit of death.
Chuckling softly Dean asks, “Give us a minute.”
An awareness of his husband’s cum splattering his insides has a second orgasm wringing him dry.
“What the hell?  Lydia never said a word about it.”  Dean’s imagining terrible things for his child.
However, he can’t leave without correcting Dean’s assumption Claire is the only priority.  Cupping his palm over that chin he admires, Cas whispers into his omega’s ear. “The party can fail for all I care because the safety of my …two omegas comes first.”
“Sam’s a good boy.  He’s just gone down a dark path for a bit.  Nobody’s perfect and we all make mistakes; when he gets out everything will be back to normal.  He’s going to call me later.”
A feeling of uselessness washes over Dean because he should help.  Yet, the heat is hitting him hardest.  Water is scarce now that his fairy can’t provide the liquid on command.  Dean glimpses the motionless body on his thigh.  Any movement from his fairy would be a blessing.  She’s alive, only barely, the rise and fall of her little chest tells him that much.
“What does her statement say?”
“An arcane fairy.”  Mirabel tilts forward, her head resting on her crossed arms.
Dean hums as he walks around.  No one’s home.
“Okay.”  A quick kiss to his cheek leaves Cas alone with Benny.
“Iron bars run the interior of the walls crisscrossing every six inches.  They also can be found in the floors and ceiling, even the door, making it impossible to force entry.”  Carefully the alpha pats Dean’s shoulder. “Come on, I think its bed time, little omega.”
“I have the utmost confidence that my father is behind the attack.”  His alpha’s eyes flash at Dean for an instance.  “He tried to eliminate my children because he’s embarrassed by their birthing omega.  How can I let that man live when he will simply try it again?”
“I’m thinking that your homework this week could be a face time session with Dean.”
Hannah sighs, her hands wringing in front of her.  “Yes, there are many similarities between you and Ion, even beyond the ARO status.”
Of course when Sam arrives to collect the brood, Ruby shouts, “We are having a baby, Daddy!”
“Very.” Castiel grins as he places the pictures to dry on the counter next to the sink.
Cas releases Ishim.  The bastard’s breathing but unconscious on the glass.
“I realize you aren’t going to exacerbate your ‘affliction’”, the beta uses his fingers to emphasize the word, “by remaining, but your scent could be extremely helpful in alleviating some of the pain.”
“Gross Dean, I didn’t need to hear that.”  His brother's face is bright red through his classic bitch face.
“Shhh! You behave,” the female omega demands with a vicious hiss in her voice.  Dean’s never witnessed an omega speak to her mate in such a commanding way.  “I want them both.”
Ishim grinds his teeth, “No need to be rude.  If Dean’s finally putting those gorgeous lips to good use and helping me get my money, who am I to complain.”  The bastard leans in close to Castiel’s ear, “Always a shame he never took me up on my offers.  Not completely anyway.  Probably stunning when he comes.”
Leaning over, Dean whispers low, “You got a name?”
His mind goes completely blank. The kindness in Amelia’s face makes the statement genuine and real. Dean murmurs, “Thank you.”
The girl standing next to the angel Cas pointed to has dark auburn hair and green eyes.  She gives a tiny wave towards him.
“A couple grand here and there.  I only pay 500 a month to couch surf and the use of the hall closet for my stuff.  Living off of PB&J.  Then bam, he calls me two weeks ago and says he needs me to speed up my reimbursement plan.  I’ve got two days to scrounge up ten grand.  Let me assure you, I have nowhere near what Ishim’s asking.”
“You and me both,” Dean whispers as he sips cool liquid.
“Boooring,” he lies back in his seat, singing the word. “In your second year you only compete against other omegas in the first two trials.  Now I’m going all the way, and if I gotta choose a method to test my future mate then I’d rather join a wicked game of hide and seek in the woods than kicking a ball around.”
Jack copies his fall talking to the ceiling, “No.  She died in childbirth.”
Careful to keep his cool, Dean places his hands on the desk, closing his eyes.  An image appears in his mind, has been loitering back there since Dean was young.  Softly the omega expresses the details of his one true alpha.  “Male, blue eyes, dark hair although one might think it’s black when the sun hits him just right a bit of auburn shines through.  Close to my height and the most important part the biggest, brightest smile you’ve ever seen.  You might not know it because he saves that just for me.”
Dean trembles at the heaviness of this realization. Cas is everything to him.
They both are chuckling when Crowley bursts into the room, throwing on the overhead lights.
The Omega sticks his tongue out with a scowl.
“Oh, now darling there is no question about that.  Our Angel of Thursday doesn’t tend to make a single noise from his perch on high.  Nonetheless, according to Benny, he was tossing a royal fit at your mere existence.  So close,” she sighs dramatically, “and yet so far away.”
A grin blossoms on his face as Dean remains on his knees while his fingers slide under the waist band and carefully chase the supple material down those thick thighs.  “Yummy.”
The two men kiss and touch tenderly, nothing tawdry, just allowing the chance for each of them to heal in the other’s presence. Slowly but surely Dean falls asleep safe in Castiel’s arms.
She pushes her hand to the screen, releasing the door’s locks.  Hissing of pistons declares the swing of the metal frame but it's not his eyes or ears that alert the omega to the lack of a scent seal.
He really dislikes Todd. The kid has been in every single class with Meg since Mother’s Day Out. The little turd comes from a conservative family who look down at the Winchesters like garbage, simply because Meg was born out of wedlock, and neither Sam nor Dean have attempted to bring a proper female into the family. But clearly, it’s okay to discuss vaginas on the playground with other children.
For some reason Castiel desperately needs to understand so he asks again, “What is it?”
Hannah brings them a late lunch, checking in on Meg’s progress.  She gets to cross the doors.  Dean kind of wants to punch her; at least she returns with the first update in hours.  “Everyone is healthy, and Meg’s labor is progressing nicely.”
I love you all so very much.
Thank you for reading.  I truly love comments and questions.
“Dean, I need you to answer me.  How has Castiel’s mental health affected you?”  Dr. Shurley requests from his desk, his hands clasped waiting for Dean’s reply.
From his perch on high, Dean surveys the workout field.  Omegas are running the obstacle course, practicing karate on the soft mat center, and scaling the climbing wall.  He really should be doing laps.  Yet, his mind continues to race with thoughts of Castiel, the alpha whose scent has bewitched him so completely he will never take another pink blocker pill.  Could he be in love?  True mates don’t always find love and mates who were never true can find it.  One of his favorite songs comes on his iPod, and Dean closes his eyes letting The Rolling Stones take him far from the sub-basement of the Center.
“Damn it!”  Harry shuts off the TV.  “Forgot about the animals.”
Castiel opens his mouth to reply but its Gabriel that speaks. “She wants Cassie to spend seven days in the city. She will meet with him alone the first two days, then if she is satisfied that he’s truly clean, she will allow small visits that will increase over the following five days with Claire. After a few successful meetings, she wants a drug test. If that comes back negative then she will allow a 24-hour stay before they leave. If all goes well and Cas agrees to two more random drug tests in November and December, then Claire may spend Christmas here in Beaufort.”
“No.”  He leans against the concrete island.  “It happens every once in a while, although they’ve never been violent.  The mess in the bathroom is common.”
The other omega’s brow furrows. “If Cain had testified in open court that Castiel was somehow controlled by a spiritual entity created through mystical forces they would have killed him. A large portion of our country’s citizens believe the craft should be outlawed and its practitioners banished or burned.”
He can’t stop from chuckling. The kid’s way of talking is so damn weird.  “You’re down here a lot.”
“Let’s go through your wardrobe for fun.”  She bounces into the closet he shares with Cas shouting from within, “You know the flannel grunge look went out in the 90s!”
Cas goes to the other side whispering into her ear, “You are loved.”  Each man taking the hand of their child as Cas utters, “She looks so vulnerable.”
Brushing his lips over Castiel’s, Dean sighs his answer, “I have everything set up in the back. An entire evening devoted to my little omega.”
“Are you fucking kidding?”  Gordon’s smarmy grin goes sliding right off his face.  “We could croak?”
Placing his head on Dean’s chest, the omega listens to the pounding heart of his alpha. Each beat repeats one thing over and over to his soul. Castiel Winchester is loved.
Damn it, he swore most the town knew about Cas’s situation.  “There is some trouble from Castiel’s first mate’s family.  We need to keep …”
“I swear to you, Dean Winchester, our mating will come true.”  Castiel cards his fingers through Dean’s hair.
Charlie’s yelling things …loudly.
“Your father is waiting in the commons, Dean.” Garth announces.  “What would you like to do?”
Castiel nods. “If you ever broke the deal what would have happened?”
“Oooooh, Dean.  You missed the mother of all hissies.”  Nora waves her arms around chaotically, “the warts are still there.”
Dean keeps his gaze upward, “I don’t really remember a lot just bits and pieces.”
Snatching the container, Dean guzzles down several gulps.  The warm water feels amazing, giving him a burst of energy.  “How in the hell did you crossover?”
Carefully reaching out, Dean fists his hands around the bars shouting, “Cas!  You gotta fight, or I won’t make it to dawn.”
No, God no, Dick Roman isn’t his mate.  Where is Dean’s alpha?  Why did the universe give him such bliss to simply rip it from his life?  How can he find the love of his life again?  So many questions bombarding his thoughts, Dean has no choice but to give up and take the beating he deserves.
“Blonde hair down her back with wavy curls at the end.  A big smile as I ran to her, then she would pick me up and spin me around.  She knew about the curse and how I’d have to end it.  I’m kind of angry that knowing what would happen, she still chose to bring me into the world.”
“Ah.” He sighs because God the touch is amazing.
Draping his arms around Castiel’s neck frees the alpha’s own arms to climb up the rope.  The raw alpha strength is giving Dean’s groin a tingle.  His true mate uses his delicious hips to rock the line side to side until they are swinging high enough to reach the tube.  Cas releases the rope.  They don’t quite stick the landing.  Stumbling wildly as the omega’s shoulder slams into the plastic tube.   The alpha places a gold coin into a slot next to the cylinder and the hiss of fresh cool air is like heroin to his deprived lungs.
The alpha storms away, fury bleeding from his skin.  That woman had the audacity to blindly assume that Dean wasn’t his true mate.  As if Castiel doesn’t ache to bite down on Dean’s gorgeous neck.  There have been numerous nights when he wakes trembling, battling to respect his lover’s wishes and his own belief that postponing was for the best.  Cas sprints up to his bedroom, ignoring people's calls to him.  His fingers yearn to touch his one true love.
rolls around that the mere suggestion of spending the night with a wall separating them sounds awful.
Tilting his head back, Cas jostles his princess with a boisterous laugh.  “Doubtful; you live in my house.”
He’s nearly forgotten why he came when he’s face to face with those startling blue eyes.
“Dude, that’s why all this shit has been raining down on you and nobody else. Technically, you aren’t a Winchester, which leaves you vulnerable. The evil bastards out there want to kill Dean, and the only way to do that is through you.”
“Alchemy bath.”  He can’t help but drop a chaste kiss to his alpha’s plump alluring lips.  A huge grin grows across Dean’s face with the immediate clearing of Castiel’s mind.  “Down again, big guy.”  Dean immerses Castiel for a second time, the alpha utterly pliant in his arms.  After a beat, the omega yanks Cas to the surface, placing another lingering kiss to the man he has yearned for so much it hurts.
Castiel lurches forward, slamming his fist into Sam’s chin, shouting, “No one takes my omega.” A deep growl erupts from his alpha.
Peace.  Inhaling gently, Dean feels the stillness on a spiritual level; he under no circumstances believed such calmness would bless his life.  Yet, here he is swimming in the waters of serenity.
He finally swivels to face the counter when shock smacks Dean hard in the face. Of all the driving schools, his blue-eyed stranger has to walk into this one. Truthfully, he’s the only one in the county, but still. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. The gorgeous man clears his throat, abruptly reminding Dean that staring is not helping his cause in the least. “May I help you?”
Castiel pulls Dean away from the swinging blade.  Happily, the omega leans back into his mate’s chest, tucking into the warmth of his alpha.  Closing his eyes, Dean sniffs into the source.  Hazelnut coffee with cinnamon invades his body, overwhelming the omega for a moment.  It’s been far too long.  A dull thunk informs him the deed is done; Dick Roman is dead.
Next a slew of nurses and the anesthesiologist visit for a myriad of questions and starting the IV.  In the end they all blend together.  Thank God Cas is there, his rock.
“Hello?”  Castiel nearly pops himself in the face from shock.
He doesn’t watch them go. Instead, he just listens to the music. The alcohol is finally at the wheel, which is a nice reprieve. At some point, a beer and a few more shots make their way onto his table but he still keeps his eyes low. Dean Winchester does not need their pity. Damn it to fucking hell! He spent the last five years devoted to a future that never existed. He will be left in that duplex alone, just like Rufus. Maybe he should get a cat. Wait, he hates those whining fur balls!
“Do you yield?”  Dean shouts.
Sorrow burrows into his heart, “If they had waited …things will be different soon.”
Loud, shrieking laughter halts his bizarre behavior in its tracks.  Meg howls, her entire body rolling in giggles, “Gotcha!”
“Hmmm.”
“The Coroner’s report states Daphne drove into a tree.  Odd circumstances though.  Toxicology came back with no trace of alcohol or narcotics of any kind in her system.  The sun was shining and the naughty tree was dead center of a two-mile straight shot.  Now, I would expect mentions of suicide to be in the paperwork, yet the entire document is void of any such conjecture.  Why?”
A slap to Dean’s shoulder startles him as Gabriel takes pity finally clarifying, “No, this is a game we used to play back when we were kids. Fun, cheap way to pass the time.  With four boxes that means we will have four teams.  The hallway is kind of narrow so we will have to play in heats of two.  Three teams of three and one of two.”
“You and Charlie?”  Damn, Meg’s impressive.
Squinting his eyes, Dean glances between Hannah and Crowley.  “What kind of documents?”  Did he slur?  Nope, nobody’s mentioned it.
Cas smiles, licking his lips seductively, “The darkness that swirls under your skin will never harm me, Dean, because he wants to claim me just as much as you do.” The omega brushes his lips along the shell of the Dean’s ear, whispering, “the beast craves my slick.”
There is no response from Cas, so Ruby answers for him, “Yeah, I thought you’d say Dean. He does have a sweet ass.  You gonna hit that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
At some point Castiel snuggles them together on the fluffy bean bag chair.  Dean’s shoes, jeans, and underwear are discarded so he can straddle his favorite set of American thighs.
The hotel room is stunning. It looks like something out of a painting with all gold trim, soft white carpeting, and antique furniture. The bedroom is off to the left and holy crap it could so be in a palace.
“My dear boy, we are going to create our own miracle.”
“Yes.”
It’s chilly this morning and Dean is still dressed in merely boxers.  “Cas, do you need to be anywhere today?”
“Finger yourself while I prep.”
“My thoughts exactly, and let’s be honest, with triplets I’m not going to stay my fighting weight for long.”  Dean switches places with Cas so he can wash the Alpha’s hair.
Both men moan from the caress.
“Hmm, not a nurse.”
The tender alpha drifts off to his own dreamland as an odd thought crosses his mind. Lying here naked with Dean for the first time has nothing to do with sex, yet he feels closer to his Omega than anyone else on the planet.  Castiel keeps his promise,
“Not so elaborate.  I have arranged for some flowers of Eden to be brought on board, and we can borrow a storage car for space.”  Castiel slips off the edge of the couch to kneel, “Only family and a few friends would be present.  A special blessing from a man of Joshua’s power could aid us in our future endeavors as a couple.  This will be a spiritual union.  Please, Dean, say yes?”
“Damn it!” He cries as everything goes hazy.
With her face neutral, Naomi cuts the distance between them.  “Not unless you are thirsty.”
Damn it, he should have known the new soft limit will bring a game of twenty questions.  “Yes, Cas.  I hate my feet. I hate looking at them, and I hate having them touched.  AND now you can’t touch them so it’s all well in my world.”
She catches herself quickly, the bright grin returning, “Third times a charm.  I’m 15 weeks along, which is the furthest I’ve gone, so Crowley and I are hopeful.”
“Not necessarily; if the scans are clean then we can discuss further cancer treatments.”
“Then share it.”  Gadreel demands.
“No, think of it more like a mosaic made of broken tiles. The old pieces are all there but put together in such a way which is new and usable. Sam’s life in California was not usable in creating a healthy environment. It’s a positive thing, Dean.”
All heads bounce in confirmation.  Alright, it sounds like Dean simply has to do his best at the Challenges, flirt his ass off, and Sam is safe.  Meg steps behind the others using her hand to give a cutting the throat gesture.  She seems to be the one working towards his happily ever after.  Trusting her will either be the best or worst decision he’s ever made.
“Told me what?” Dean scoots over so Cas can share the chair. Merely so they can be on equal footing and definitely not because the omega craves his alpha's touch.
The Omega can’t find his voice so he just nods.  Sam grabs some matches and lighter fluid from the pantry, then walks out the sliding glass door.  Gabriel lifts Claire into his own arms, following Sam, his voice solemn, “Princess, it’s time to learn fire safety.”
A glass of ice water!  What the fuck Winchester?  Speaking in a coherent non-idiot manner does not seem to be possible with those stunning blue eyes staring at him.  It gets worse.  Castiel cracks a full-blown smile, his teeth showing and all.  Unfortunately, when beautiful creatures smile in front of Dean Winchester, at least with men, he stumbles around with the grace of a newborn fawn.
“Why are you here, Meg?  It’s a Saturday; shouldn’t you be sacrificing animals?"  He chucks the bottle in the recycling, going back in the fridge for a second.
“No, my Dean.  Currently the spell still holds; however, Hester has called an official gathering to discuss the options and outcomes.”  Cas sighs dragging his hand over his face.  “Unfortunately, her paranoia has taken root in several of our numbers.  I must attend and shed some light on her rantings of leaving for the border now.”
“I’ve got an outfit for you.”  Her arms are full of clothes.  Meg gives the pile a glare of disdain as if they offended her.  She tosses them onto a counter.
Bull shit. Dean’s not an idiot; he sees right through Castiel’s stoic strength. The older man is grinding his jaw, and those cerulean beauties are battling to stay dry. If things go south for Dean, he could be saying goodbye to Cas for longer than a weekend. Just the thought makes him cry.
She flitters up to him, tapping the top of his shirt pocket.
Castiel treads quietly to the door opening it wide. “Would you please come with me, Dean?”
A soft kiss to his cheek has Dean looking upward into his Alpha’s gaze.  “Cheer up, my Omega.  You can look forward to killing Azazel and slicing off his hands.  We can purchase a brand-new freezer and everything.”
Looking around the room nervously, Castiel prays the two will move on because he clearly misspoke.
Rage bubbles up from the sorrow. He doesn’t have a face for his anger, but it’s still there. He can’t blame his brother. Sam is just doing what’s right, growing up becoming a man. That has always been Dean’s end game.
Crowley raises an eyebrow, frowning. “The mutt as well?”
Cas’s eyes show recognition immediately, “Why?”
“I …” the torture in his lover’s tone floats another level of hell, “I can’t.”
“Why are we doing this?  Really?”  There has to be a reason the woman got up in the middle of the night to sled for Dean’s birthday.
The words are in Enochian, of course, but Cas understands them without fail. His faint grin is cut off by a horrid hacking fit. The omega stretches out his good hand towards Dean’s alter ego. He can sense the beast tracking his movements as Dean mirrors the action. Their fingers meet in the middle, gently intertwining as his alpha whines with nervousness. Even in this hulk version, Dean’s first instinct is to care for his omega.
“Yes.  I can only beg for forgiveness?”
“My scent?”  Dean’s mind zeroes in on that one word.  Shit, of course Cas has been latching onto his stupid apple bouquet since his heat.
Meg appears next, pantomiming a ship.
Using his finger, Dean taps harshly on Sam’s shoulder. “He’s important, Sammy.”
He can’t remember what Cas’s plans were for the night.  Maybe fate will play her evil game, denying the Dom's answer.  However, Dean’s chest lightens as the familiar gravelly deep voice calls out into the shadowy room; the only light shines in from the bathroom.
The PA takes another look at his wound, “The bleeding has stopped, so you can go home.  Now, the lidocaine will wear off in an hour or so, and you will be in pain.  Tylenol should put you right.  Also, lean to the other side when sitting today, and pop on your stomach when possible.  The front desk will give you a kit of supplies with directions to keep the open area sterile until you heal.”
His brain catches up to the naughty comment by Crowley as he rubs the back of his neck roughly, “I’m not looking to be in a physical –”
“What kind of touch?” Dean growls.
“For your first, hell yeah.  Lenore was an excellent starting point before all hell broke loose with Ruby and Alex.”
Once Dean clears the plates, Castiel retrieves an envelope from the inside of his trench coat.  The outerwear rests on an empty chair at the table.
“Cas,” Dean rises up kissing those plump supple lips, “I don’t care about where we mate because in the end all I need is you.”  Another kiss for luck, then nibbling softly Dean works his mouth down his alpha’s neck, continuing his ministrations to their dicks.
Mouthing the word “permeate,” Dean silently observes Jack leave the table and disappear into a dorm room down the hall.
She flips the long red curls off her shoulder as she teeters towards his desk in her six-inch black heels.  “Most students love my subject.”
“Well, Sammy you’re not wrong.  Emma has settled into a routine, and I am concerned you might disrupt her schedule.  She’s a special needs child.”
The tinted sliding glass doors open and everything moves so fast it makes Dean’s head spin. There are six NYPD Police Officers standing in a semi-circle yelling for someone to get on their knees. Dean looks to his left and then to his right. Yup it’s just him. The bastard Cole has vanished.
“Come in,” he replies, his words harsher than expected.
“Cas, you gotta tell me what the hell is going on.  Babe, you are shivering like it’s thirty below in here.”  The hunter nuzzles their noses together in an adorable loving gesture.  “Talk to me.”
“Agreed.  However, you need allies.  Eileen’s pretty adamant you have a particular alpha in mind, and she wants to aid you in finding him.”
Dear Gabriel,
The silver arched blade lifts to sit at the side of Ishim’s neck.  A swift flick of Castiel’s wrist releases a thin dribble of crimson trickling down the man’s flesh.  “Be careful.  I have dispatched men for far less.  He owes sixty-five.”
All my love,
Grabbing her bag, Charlie lifts her shoulder sighing, “Nope.  You are the first I’ve seen Winchester.  Accept it, Solo, you’re a rare gem.”
He’s merely knocked once when the door swings open. “Dean!  Excellent, I want to show you the progress I’ve made.”
“Hell yes, you.  Castiel and you are her fathers.  She feels safe and is flourishing in your loving home.  Missouri mentioned yesterday how impressed she is in Emma’s development.  Dude, she thinks it could be any day now when Emma signs her first word.”
“I would be delighted to Deanna.”  Dean shuts his eyes and mouth tightly ignoring the stupid nickname.  “It’s quite simple.  You will pick out one female and one male exotic dancer to join our African safari.  Absolutely no one is to touch them.  If anybody breaks that one important rule, it’s a ten grand fine, and they have to run naked through the last village of the journey.  All moneys collected will of course go to the stripper as a bonus.  Questions??”
“For your information, Dean, there is a need for lawyers who can communicate with their deaf clients without the use of an interpreter.  It will look amazing on my resume.”  Sam stops, shoving his hands into his pockets.  “And one of the ASL tutors is pretty cool, but so far she’s not interested so I don’t want to jinx it.”
The sound of the front door closing and Hannah yelling up, “I’m back,” sends Cas rushing to the bed, painfully aware of his throbbing wrist.
“I really don’t care.”  He states as he uses the couch to lower himself next to her.  The omega kisses the top of Marie’s head, “Does it hurt, the feeding thing?”
His favorite playlist of classic rock blaring into his bones. It’s the song that catches his attention.  An old one he hadn’t heard in ages and not really one he would have picked; Long as I can see The Light by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
Comments, Questions, and Concerns are encouraged.  Also, I got a puppy!!  His name is Tony Stark.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dick killed my mate,” Benny deadpans.
“Cas.”  Sparkling, clear-blue eyes allow the omega to relax.  “I brought you breakfast.  I made the pancakes myself.”
After all the new art is doused with cream and covered, the posse starts towards the door. Pamela snags Dean’s hand, pulling him off to the side.  Her eyes are serious as she crosses her arms.
“Fine, there is a story in here called
Dean doesn’t hear from Gadreel for four days.  His friend made it clear that he needed to work out a few things first.  Really Dean would like to ignore the whole affair by telling himself that he’s not truly putting it off, but waiting for Gadreel to reply is perfect.  He’s lying on his couch at work, NOT napping when his phone rings.
“Yes, he understands the battle with addiction firsthand. Remember when we were kids and he would drink until he passed out every night? I do. I know it won’t be fun, but please, Dean, I need you there.”
Darting between pine trees, the omega sprints to the right, arcing his trail to never lose sight of the house.  Exhilaration pumps chaotically through his veins; this is the sole challenge Dean craves.  Screw the trials.  He’s unable to get a visual on Castiel; however, he can hear the other man gaining on him.  Dean might be quick, but the Alpha’s craving for his flesh might win.  Which would be awesome.
“Dean,” Cas said, hand stopping to hover over his handprint. “I’m feeling something.”
Sam cut across him, and Dean scowled at his younger brother.
Of course, he doesn’t tell Sam.
Dean glowered. “I was fourteen.”
They stood toe to toe, and Cas wrapped one arm around Dean, their hands clasped on the other side. “Listen to me. I’m going to send part of my grace into you. You have to let me in. It won’t be like I’m possessing you, because the majority of my consciousness will still be in this body. Your body and the space between us will be a conduit for our essences.” Dean swallowed, and nodded. He was trembling, but knew it wasn’t from fear. “If it gets too much, if at any point it feels wrong or dangerous, pull back immediately, you understand?” Cas stroked his thumb along Dean’s hand, and Dean briefly wondered why Cas had agreed to do this. It was pretty obvious that he wanted to, but what had made him change his mind? Dean pushed the thought of his mind, and sent a single, silent,
When Sam and Dean only stared at Cas, clearly lost, he continued. “Hide-n-seek. You said you didn’t play it as children. I clearly don’t know how to play. Why don’t we?”
“Come on,” Dean said. “I’ll drop you off at the hospital for those scratches,” he gestured to the lacerations all up and down the man’s arms. “Sammy, ride in the back with him,” he instructed. He didn’t want to have to bear the brunt of all the man’s bewildered questions. He slid into the Impala, and Cas hopped easily into the passenger seat behind him, looking a little bit smug. Dean rolled his eyes, and fast-forwarded blindly on the cassette tape in the stereo. He was going to find the next song on his mixtape – not only because it contained a confession, but also because it was a promise of what they were going to do as soon as they were alone. And it was just the right kind of music Sam had learned to tune out over the years, so he wouldn’t be listening too closely. Perfect. Dean gunned the engine, and drove smoothly forward onto the road.
He pushed in, and it was glorious. Cas was so wet, and hot, and tight, and Dean moaned loudly as he bottomed out, nearly scalding water pounding between them. Cas panted heavily, and they were utterly lost in the feeling. But Dean needed more, and so he grabbed a hold of Cas, and lifted him up as he thrust back into him. Cas groaned and rocked down so Dean’s cock disappeared inside him, unable to withhold his cry of, “Dean…”

While it seemed like it to the others at the camp, everything didn't end between us when I started to take drugs. He was my rock, as messed up as it was. I didn't sleep with him while I was high - I didn't even come near him. I might break apart if he touched me when I was wide eyed and vulnerable. Might tell him how I would choose it all again, how I would rather be broken for him than half-alive for God. How I hated all the things he had said, how they made the pit of my stomach feel hollow.
When they were sitting back in the Impala, Cas running his thumbs over the smooth cover and the Beatles playing embarrassingly loudly, Dean asked, “So, do you want to-”
“His soul was so bright when I first saw it in Hell. Even tarnished with sin. I guess my blasphemy started early.”
Sometimes the man would notice me watching him, listening, and he would pause in the song. None of the newcomers, the ones who came after Sam said yes, really knew my story. It got tiring to tell it again and again. He'd heard rumors, no doubt. Dean Winchester's fallen Angel. The one who rebelled against heaven and got us here. Castiel - the one who stayed behind. After a moment, I would nod at him, and he would continue. He seemed to get stuck on the
There was a chill buried in the warm night air, a promise of snow to come; there was a lone bird flying overhead; there was a pounding in his chest and a soft sigh from Cas’ lips; the guitar screamed to an end; there was utter stillness around them when Dean finally kissed Castiel.
“I needed you to stop being such a dumb, self-sacrificial son-of-a-bitch,” Dean bites out. “I needed you alive, doing stupid crap like repollinating the tundra and raising Lucifer’s kid and being kinder to world than it damn well deserves. I just needed you, I don’t know, around. Fuck, Cas. Is it that hard to grasp?”
Cas’ wings were still wrapped firmly around Dean. They were lying on the ground on their sides, Dean brushing moss off of Cas’ back. Dirt and cum and the smell of flowers clung to them. That was how Dean read Cas’ first love letter to him. He set it down carefully, blinking tears out of his eyes. “Cas-” he stopped. “I-” He stared into Cas’ eyes, suddenly frantic. Every word, every last unbearably gorgeous word of that letter has fled his mind.
that movie, in a way he likes few others, though he can’t watch it without seeing Dean in insouciant young George Bailey.
“For what?” Dean asked offhandedly, watching the waves lap tentatively at the shore.
“What about touch?” Dean asked after counting up the senses on his fingers. The bartender raised one eyebrow at him as she set his shots down with a clink. He rolled his eyes at the sassy older blonde.
“Mm,” Dean thought for a moment. “Both. ‘Like talking to you, Cas.” The words slipped out of his mouth without warning, treacherously sentimental.
On the other hand, he needed girlie romantic advice, and Sam was definitely the right man for that. So, Dean held his breath and listened to Sam’s phone ring one, two, three, four, five times.
God, I felt high. I pushed him back onto the ground, ignoring the surprise in his expression. He hissed in slight pain at the rough rocks beneath us, but let me strip him of his jeans and underwear. He was gorgeous. Of course, I had knitted his body back together and remade him. I already knew every detail of his body, but touching it this way; this was something different. I draped myself around him, and took his penis in my hand. He groaned at every touch of our skin, every mark I sucked into his flesh. I thought absentmindedly as I stroked him - hard and fast, just like he begged me too - that I liked these red marks. 'Hickeys', he'd later tell me. I liked marking his body as mine, for as we were then, how could he have been anything else?

“Finishing a hunt up in Bend, Oregon,” Sam said slowly.
Dean tilted Cas’ face up to him with a single finger under his chin. “Do you trust me?”
I haven't been replying to reviews lately, I've been so busy, but know that I read every last one of them and they make my day :) <3
If there’s one thing Castiel needs, it’s something to do with the burning love still inside him. He reads every book he can on psychotherapy and creates a profile online. He wants to help people on the fringes of the paranormal world. They won’t have much scope to come into an office, or much trust for anyone accredited, whether they’re a vampire who would burst into flames in the sun or a hunter with trust issues.
Cas shot him his
Sam resisted the urge to say, ‘his heart, obviously,’ but only just.
something, that was easy to understand. And I wondered if the plants ached for sunlight when it was dark, and I realized I was breaking. It was… the strangest thing.” Cas trailed off then, and when he looked back up, his face darkened. “I’ve made you sad. I’m sorry. I didn’t – I just –”
“All right. How you gonna get home, though?” Dean asked, pulling up along the sidewalk by the bar.
with him, maybe didn’t even mean it like that. His head spins. He thought he could have it.
Cas woke up to Dean Winchester rubbing a hot, damp washcloth over his torso while holding a rose between his teeth.
I don’t know whether I would have gotten up if it weren’t for that.” Cas said, shrugging. “It made me come back to you.”
“Take your shirt off,” Dean said, grabbing the dental floss and sewing needle. When he turned back, Cas hadn’t moved. He squinted. “What, you just gonna stand there and bleed out? Take your damn shirt off.”
“Right.” A year ago, that wouldn’t have been a problem. It would’ve been
“Well, I never learned I guess. Dad wasn’t really one for music lessons. Not everyone makes music, Cas.” Dean realized that he’d never seen Cas’ hair or stubble grow out before, except in purgatory. He’d assumed it was part of that control over his vessel thing. Maybe Cas was letting it grow out, just to see what it felt like. For some reason, the thought made him feel… warm. It was a weird feeling others might have labelled as affection.
Dean laughed. “No, Cas, it’s a kid’s game.”
Dean shook his head. “Not once. Why, did I misjudge?”
“What?” Dean’s features are pained. “Cas, man, don’t...just tell me what you mean, and tell me fast. My heart’s breaking from the suspense over here.”
He had a cold.
,” Dean whines, low and indignant. “Why did you even kiss me in the first place if you didn’t want –”
Thank you for your feedback, your song recs and your fellow fangirl-ship. *Salutes*
Dean takes a deep breath.
Cas thinks.
“Surprise me,” Cas replied, blinking his eyes open as if he’d been asleep. “Just no more Metallica.”
And so he prays to Jack. After promising to come for down for a cup of tea soon.
“Cas.” He reaches out, and cups Cas’ face. “Trust me.”
“Describe it to me,” Dean said, reaching a hand down to palm Cas’ cock through his jeans.
Sam started leaving food outside the door. The door was never closed, just stuck at the half open position. Still, Sam kept his distance. He offered to watch Cas a few times, but other than that and the mysteriously appearing food (and coffee) all was quiet. The protests Dean had expected at him sitting by Cas all day didn't come.
He ached everywhere and when he tried to focus his eyes, his head pounded and his vision grew dim at the edges. When he tried to sit up, his limbs went weak and wobbly and he collapsed back on his pillows with an angry huff.
to remember in the morning.
he repeated, like a mantra. And abruptly, on the third time through –
Cas was inside him. This was the realization Dean couldn’t quite come to terms with or dispel as Cas fucked him, and so it lingered, playing over and over again. Cas reached around with his other hand, and started stroking Dean’s cock. Dean groaned. He could already feel the pleasure building in his stomach, but he didn’t want this to end. Cas was fucking him hard and fast, and each thrust struck just the right spot. His fingers twisted in the sheets. He wished he could touch Cas, but this was almost better, Cas touching him in every way possible. He gasped when he felt sharp teeth and a hot, wet tongue across his shoulder. “Oh, angel,” he moaned sinfully. Skin slapped on skin, and Dean’s hole was wet and slick, and Cas was so deep inside him.
Cas’ voice came low and guttural, softened with a brush of his lips to Dean’s chest. “And I, you.”
When Dean had caught three fish and released them again on Cas’ strict instruction, Dean rolling his eyes when he thought the angel couldn’t see him, Cas let out a heavy sigh. “I don’t think fishing is one of my talents, Dean.”
“Yeah. The bartender there was telling me about something that sounded like a haunting up near Topeka. Might as well check it out now, right?” Sam babbled.
Dean never left the chair for more than five minutes at a time. He slept there, using, more often than he'd admit, Cas' trenchcoat as a blanket. There was a bottle of whiskey by the leg of the chair, but it was unopened. Had been for days. That must be some sort of a record. If Cas woke up, if he needed help, he couldn't be drunk. And he couldn't be so deep asleep that if Cas called out, he wouldn't hear. Those were the only facts that stopped himself from drinking himself into a stupor, drinking the thought
“Yes.” Cas answered in his gravelly voice. “We were talking, and he said we ought to sort some of the old archives out.” He waved a book, which let off a cloud of dust. “But he said I ought to listen to Mr. Presley.” Mr. Presley, my ass, Dean thought. “I’m afraid I don’t understand a great deal of it. But I like it.”
They appeared in a pine forest in the middle of nowhere. The Impala, much to Dean’s relief, was standing beside them, faithfully playing the last of the Fleetwood Mac song. Dean looked around, wondering where exactly they are. Something about the place set a prickling sense of familiarity through his bones, and he scans along the horizon, blazing with sunset. All the trees immediately around them looked to have fallen maybe a decade ago, with some new saplings tentatively taking their place. Dean frowned. There was a circle of barren land, topped with fallen trees all around them. That seemed… His eyes fell on a single wooden cross marker, and all the breath left his body.
Dean sinks down, inch by inch, until Cas is nestled at the back of his throat as it twitches and flutters. A tear beads up at the corner of Dean’s eye, and Cas wipes it away. He opens his mouth to say it’s okay, Dean doesn’t need to go all the way, but Dean swallows around him and he can see clear as day in Dean’s eyes how much he wants it all. Cas groans and lets Dean bob up and down on his hard cock. Dean’s green eyes glitter and spit runs down his jaw. Cas can feel it, the slick stubble rubbing against his pubic bone when Dean comes down. Heat is pooling fast in Cas’ groin, waves of pleasure already hinting at more around his navel. “Dean,” he says again, more urgent.
That night he'd drank his weight in whiskey. Sitting on the loveseat in his bedroom, it sunk in. He scoffed. "He changed his mind."
“I...you...” Cas’ voice is nothing more than a rasp in the darkness. “You love me.”
So... once more with feeling,
Castiel was staring out the window, perfectly still as they listened. Dean knew he was staring, but hey, someone losing their Led Zeppelin virginity was an important event. He cracked a smile.
Depending on which state he’s in, he could be in some real deep shit. There are several states across the country with the three strikes rule for aggravated assault.  He tries to keep track of which ones not to hit lucky number three in, because a prison sentence will screw with his bounty hunter license, especially in the few states that have stricter regulations.  “By the way, what’s your name?”
“What’s her name?”  Castiel’s immediate acceptance cools the mounting anxiety of possibly oversharing.
“Tell me about your brother, Ion.  He was like me, right?”  Curiosity has been bugging him for a while, so might as well have a nice chat with their morning jaunt.
Dean pulls out a seat, “Cas, you can sit here.”
Meg holds up her pointer finger, shaking it before placing it on her lips.
Doubling over, Castiel coughs a weird smell suffocating him. The beast holds his hand calmly, not fazed by the omega’s gasping. “That scent, what is it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What? A swimsuit?” His nose wrinkles at the thought. “It looks more like a green body condom or a body positive ninja.”
“We should be there in an hour.”  The woman hangs up.
If you, in any way, come on to Dean Winchester, I will have Gadreel hold you down as I shave your entire body.
Castiel squeezes his lover’s hand, holding on until he is physically forced to release his grip as they roll Dean through the staff only doors. The alpha stands alone in the hall, a cold chill sprinting through his body.
Once Dean parks his Baby in front of Sam’s house he finally turns to his alpha, “Just remember one thing.”
XOXOXO - Angie
This class is his metaphorical arch nemesis. He loves these guys, but holy hell they are going to give him an aneurism one day. The tension from trying to hold his tongue is leaching onto his shoulder muscles to the point everything hurts. So after Meg’s announcement, he cracks up laughing so hard his side is cramping.
“I’m sorry, but I think the only code to your puzzle is up there.” Dean points to her head, hoping she’s not easily offended.  Although, this conversation is just getting weirder and weirder.
Everything is getting heavy; his arms, legs but especially his eyelids. Yeah he’s gonna pass out.
The lawyer calmly picks a piece of lint from his suit. “The first folder with the blue tags holds documents reinstating your parental rights as Emma’s biological father.  Your DNA, procured by Delphine, has been submitted to the court.  It would allow her to be placed in your care immediately.”
“Be nice.”  Cas crosses his arms, leaning against the doorframe.  “Our house might become a plethora of primary colors soon.”
His alpha looks upset as he motions Castiel towards him. “We gotta go to the main gate for a minute.”
Locked.
Zeroing in hastily on the shaking treat box guides Dean to Castiel’s next location; however, this time it’s not candy that he desires. Winchester lets his hand graze across Cas’s bare foot to get a read as to how he’s standing. Then dives his face into what should be the crotch area, nuzzling in tight.
Changing topics seems like a fabulous idea, so Dean inquires, “This is a pretty swanky state hospital.”
A growling stomach is the final straw.  The brothers rise, shuffling towards the kitchen to find food for Dean.
Castiel and Charlie’s mouths drop in horror. The implications of what this woman is saying shock them both to the core. Just then the phone rings, and Donna takes the call to finish the ring order.
Walt hands Ishim a hanky for his neck.  The bastard humming, “Heard.”
Ash lies on the floor, his hands motionless in the air like he paused mid-fight.  “Ash.  Not funny man,” Dean says, rushing to his roommate’s side, “…Ash!  ASH!!”  The other omega’s eyes are open, but his friend isn’t responding.
One thing Dean has learned is to not stick his nose in the odd dance Cas and Zachariah do to avoid each other. He’s fairly certain that there’s a story there, but Dean has faith that his angel will tell him in his own time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Black dots bounce into his vision.  Dean can’t recall the last time he inhaled, but he’s guessing it might have been his last.  Suddenly, the pressure lightens enough for him to get one tiny inhale.
A smile breaks the tension in his Alpha’s expression.  “Was it a ghost?  I thought Rowena took care of the basement dwellers?”
“How delicious she tasted as he tore a portion of muscle from her upper thigh with his teeth.”  The gray haired man grimaces, “especially as he chewed and swallowed.”
“Anymore?”  Inias adds from behind the couch.  Awesome, now he’s got an audience.
Castiel’s eyes widen in shock. “There was no way to save her?”
“I have to admit, my Omega, this option has a splendid side effect.  My inner alpha savors marking your skin with my name.”  A vicious, carnal growl detonates from the alpha.  Dean wouldn’t believe it, but the sound makes his cock even harder.  Cas’s mouth swiftly pauses at Dean’s ear, “You can only cum on my knot.  Do it before then and you have to tell me three things you want from me as your alpha, not your Dom.”
That evening Castiel furiously writes a long letter to his intended mate.  Charlie was correct, Dean should be told that he is taken but that there are reasons for postponing the mate-ship. Perhaps, this time should be seen as an engagement of sorts, like betas before marriage, a time to get to know each other better and prepare for their intertwined futures.
It’s a little after ten when they arrive at the beach. There are a few people walking dogs or jogging, but for the most part the two men are alone.
“Excellent.  We are in agreement.”
Placing his hand on Dean’s knee, Cas squeezes. “We will see him again; it’s not a goodbye.”
“Her scans look good. There is some swelling around the laceration, which is to be expected. I am admitting her for a 24 hour observation. At the end of her stay, we will do another set of x-rays and if the swelling goes down, she can go home. I am very confident that Miss Meg here will be fine, but I want to be safe. Head injuries can turn bad quickly.”
He hears a hum over his right shoulder.  “Oh, that sounds delightful.”
He’s not sure if he’s trying to reassure Cas or himself as powerful alpha arms envelope him.  The magical hold releases him to his bodyguard.  Dean opens his eyes, whining from pain as blood drips into his vision, making it blurry.  The world spins uncontrollably while Uriel carries Dean to his tower.  Red soaked hands are the only thing he sees.
Castiel closes his eyes, picturing his handsome omega, his stomach swelling further during his absence.  His fingers are twitching to touch Dean’s warm, inviting skin.  His cousin is correct; Castiel must call Dean if only to reassure him that everything is alright.
“What the hell is happening?” Dean shouts.
The entire table answers in unison, “Yes.”
Charlie points to the stairs leading up to the newly renovated third floor where she and Meg live.  “I’ll catch you later.  Have fun!”
“We can, however I feel your brother would be disappointed.  He has high hopes for tonight.”
The silent crying goes for several minutes.  Dean can’t stop the flow of water from his eyes, even if dehydration rages near.  He will mourn the man, the father, the hero.  Everything aches down to his core.
Adler jumps from his seat, “See! She assaulted my son. There are witnesses that Inias never touched Meg.”
Gabe pauses, leaning against the doorframe to Dean's bathroom.  “What was the original plan?  I mean I know it was to reunite with the dead bros, but were they going to be permanent residents in Castiel?”
“Not Gabriel.”
Dean’s mind snaps to attention, but his body remains loose like he is still sleeping.  ‘Danger!  Danger!’ sweeps through his thoughts because there is someone in the bedroom.  Last night is hazy.  He’s naked with that nice fucked feeling.  However, way in the far reaches of his psyche there is a nagging sensation to remember something important, beyond incredible sex.  God, why is his mouth full of cotton, and brain so sluggish and scattered?
Crystal blue eyes darken with authority.  “One, Lucifer is driving down to Austin for an overnight and needs me to watch Fish.”
“AAAAHHH!”  Coherent words are hard to find.  Several more rotations on his groin have him clutching the flexing bicep of his boyfriend, “Quick!”
“The best doctors!”  Castiel rises, pacing the kitchen, “I will have Charlie research the best pediatricians here in Lawrence or we can drive to Kansas City for specialists, but Emma will recover.  I swear to it, Dean.”
Naomi’s mouth drops in what Dean believes to be fake shock.
A few minutes later, the soft, moist tongue moves off the tattoo path.  It takes Dean a second, but then he understands.  Cas is drawing in the missing pieces.  His angel is mending the broken wings.  The delicate manner in which Cas is handling him makes the hunter feel treasured and special.  He is totally pliant in Castiel’s hands when he senses the other man reach over and grab something from the edge of the mattress.  It’s not until he hears the telltale sign of a bottle being opened that Dean stirs.
“Dean it’s for your safety.  Any hour now you will go into heat.  The new suppressant will keep your scent muted enough to be around other alphas, but we do not know how a true mate will react.  Hannah’s never had the chance to test the drug in such a manner.”
“Drink up, you need to hydrate.”  Meg kneels, pulling off Dean’s boots.
“Correct, my Omega.  I can’t give you everything you deserve, but our first true time together shall be ours alone.”
Watching him go, Dean queries, “Please tell me he is not a brother?”
“Okay, change of plan,” he moves back into the man’s personal space. “Let’s remove the puke tattoo.  Although, can I have one thing before our link dissipates.”
“Uncomfortable.”
“Bela’s father is the body.  Dad helped her hide her father’s corpse and has been holding her hostage with that information for ten years now.  I can’t tell anyone because it would take her down with him.”  Dean inhales, letting the oxygen flow. “Bela’s father did unspeakable things to her.  I won’t betray her.”
His boyfriend’s hand clings to Dean’s side.  Suddenly Dean has lost the ability to speak.  It didn’t even occur to him that Bela would come bearing news from his father.  This isn’t fair.  Panic builds through his chest, hindering his capacity for breathing.  Cas’s free hand cups Dean’s chin, giving a gentle tug.  The movement yanks him from the downward spiral, but all he can do is glare at Garth for help.
“Thank you, my friend.  I greatly appreciate your time and efforts.”  Cas rises walking towards them yet turns to give Dean a wide birth.  He shakes Rufus’s hand, and the hollow fairy vanishes back into the woods.
Dean knocks her hand out of his hair playfully. “Fuck that; we are not true mates.  He would have said something by now, don’t you think?”
“I can interpret.  It seemed rather important to her.”  Cas uses a wash cloth to gently clean his hole.  “Does this hurt?”
No matter how loudly Castiel roars, Anna remains serene with a faint smile. Cas almost thinks his mother is hiding another secret.
Taking a deep breath Dean exhales, “I love him; he loves me. No big deal.”
A moment later, Jake unlocks the door, storming in, “It’s barely 6am, what’s the problem?”
“Wait,”  Dean squints, glaring at the alpha.  “How do you know about Snow White Drive?”
The two plunge onto the floor as the Mod Podge war begins.  Success!
“Dean?”  Cas sits up, his face hovering in front of the omega’s gaze.  “Dean?”
A stunning smile splits across the older man’s face making him glow with pure sunshine. God, Cas is gorgeous in every way possible.
“When he is gone, you will need me. I can wait.” Samandriel attempts a sweet, coy look, but fails miserably.
A dark delicious sound rumbles from the lips he adores, “Please.”
If Dean wasn’t sitting down he might have swooned after that little nugget of information.  Not only is Castiel Novak rich, handsome and kind, he also believes in omega equality.  The laws had been passed decades ago, but it takes high-power alphas like him to force the world to actually follow them.
Rolling his head side to side, Cas doesn’t have the energy to soften the blow.  “Sam’s a beta.  They had been living on the streets, starving with no future.  Dean ignored your warnings in order to give his brother a better life.  Don’t be angry with him.”
Harry glances over to the table on the other side of the room. “Hey, I see duck.”
Meg’s voice rumbles, “Why are you screaming like a baby?”
“I was worried, Dean,” Sam confesses, his gaze landing on Dean’s sling.
“Hello, Dean.”  The words settle the omega.  The alpha pivots to face the crowd. “Good afternoon to our friends and family.  My mate and I are overwhelmed by the love we feel from each one of you as you join us on our special day.  Thank you.”
Shouting, Dean replies, “That!  You told me you loved me.”  Realizing that yelling probably isn’t necessary, he lowers his tone, “Did you really mean it or was it a middle of the heat crazy talk?”
His alpha stands up so fast he tosses Dean to the floor.  The omega’s face smashes into the binder, although he’s too excited to notice, “And?”
of this year?”  She pauses to stand directly in front of him blocking his view of John.
“Twelve.  We have that in common, but mine died in a house fire.”  Dean swivels to lay on his side facing Claire, letting his fingers run through her blonde hair.  “I woke to the fire alarm blasting through the house.  My parents had done the house drills, so Sammy and I knew what to do.  I went to his room, and we immediately went to the mailbox.  That was our safe meeting place.  My brother and I stood on the corner and watched our house burn.  Our parents never came out.”
“Yes, he’s a vampire but also a friend.  Helped us get free from the Leviathan.”  Dean shakes Benny’s hand.  “Glad you guys made it back okay.”
He'd woken up to a note. His head didn't hurt. If he thought back hard enough, he could conjure up a dream of rustling feathers, of two fingers touching his forehead. He swallowed. He could still feel their imprint.
When he came back with two fully functioning fishing rods, though, Cas was sitting on the rocks, staring down into the water like it was a miracle. Dean cleared his throat. “Heads up.” He cast both rods into the water, before handing one to Cas and sitting down himself. “Now you wait for a fish to tug on it.”
The sound is beautiful.  Each beat murmuring to Dean:
May your cup be filled.
“Taking a bath because he fared worse than you with the Fae Shine hangover.”  Charlie points to a few possibilities Dean shaking his head.
One of Cas’s eyes pop open, “Be more specific.”
“Now that sounds like my Castiel.” She smirks, snatching a notebook and pen to jot down his requests. “Are we having everyone over for lunch then?”
“Ok.”  She sits next to him, patting his leg gently.  “Well, then I don’t feel so bad about leaving.”
“What about meeting Claire?”  This is the person he’s here for, not sand or a hot billionaire alpha.  Dean almost smacks himself for even thinking that about his new employer.
“Oh goodness!  Did he fall?”  Castiel enraptured by his tale eats slowly.
The toasty sun warms Castiel’s exposed flesh, since he’s only clad in jeans.  He sighs, relishing the freedom of finally being allowed out of the house as he stretches, lying down next to his bee hives.  Beautifully orchestrated buzzing lulls him into a meditative state.
He whispers into her soft hair, “I love you, Emma.  I wish you could tell me what’s wrong or how to help you.  Even if I couldn’t do it, I want to try.  Cancer is a scary disease.  I was hoping with all my heart the surgery would be the cure, but I was so damn wrong.”
Instead of stressing, he allows the beating of his lover’s heart to act as a lullaby.
Three days in Endville has either been a dream or nightmare, Castiel’s unsure.  Today he rested.  He pulls on a fresh t-shirt with a pair of jeans.  The tiny clock on his desk reads 6:44pm.  At 8:30pm Dean will close the blinds and draperies freeing Castiel from his snow drenched prison.  The Omega’s bouquet flows everywhere.  He consumes it.  More than a grieving Alpha should, which can mean a few things.  He must speak with Gabriel.
“You wanna help free Cas of his extra souls?”  Including Charlie in the plan seems to give the omega a new sense of hope.
“Yes, no doubt the alpha for me; he’s gorgeous, kind, respectful and brings sunshine to my life.  I’ve never seen the stranger close up, he’s a dark shadow lurking in the periphery, observing.  The dude literally brings storms to my dreamscapes.  Guy’s creepy.”
“I don’t agree.  Your heart reaches out to me, holds me, and never drops me regardless of my actions or inappropriate words.  You love me in aspects I never knew existed.”  Castiel’s arms stretch outward, “Please let it count.  I need you to accept how well you love me and how remarkable such an act is in my world.”
“I think instead you should be asking yourself the question, why do you think Dean doesn’t deserve a place all his own?”
“Holy …shit,” he whispers in shock.  Dean’s frozen in doubt because how in the hell does one respond to such a fucking bomb?  Picking up the pieces after a true mate sounds agonizing.
“Its my signing bonus from Crowley.  Supposedly I now represent his company so he picked this out.  I’m not sure it speaks to me.”
“Were you in attendance?”  Endville attracts dangerous Omegas.
“Your sister is unmated and thus out of the running.”  Chuck pauses to chew on his pipe for a bit.  “Michael may be a possible second choice, but you alone should rule, my son.”
With his arms pressed together, Dean sees the woman immediately knows what to do, lashing each wrist individually then wrapping between them to perfectly create make-shift handcuffs.
Hastily Castiel locks the letter in his drawer to keep it safe from prying eyes.  “I can try.”
“But, I’m your Dad?”
Glancing at Cas, who nods in agreement, Dean leans towards the young alpha. “Wide open spaces for the two of us from now on.”
Chairs are dragged into the living room and the card table is taken down.
“When you’re done playing tonsil hockey, you guys need to come meet our unexpected guest.”
Tying his shoes there is a knock at his door.  “Open.”
A weight immediately lifts from his chest; however, he reaches out, patting the doctor's arm. “I’m sorry someone didn’t have the smarts to fix it sooner.”
“If you fucking say anything with the word sever or break I’m going to push my ass up to the window and fart.  Trust me, it will hang around.”
Well shit!  Dean remembers Castiel stating that Crowley’s mom has a soft spot for rich, powerful alphas.  Did Barty just admit to sleeping with Crowley’s mom?  Whoa.
“Of course,” Cas runs his nose up Dean’s throat.  “Actually, might I suggest something before I prep our meals?”
He sees one with Dean’s name tagged, and clicks on it like Charlie had shown him.  Cas immediately recognizes the interviewer from one of Anna’s celebrity shows, Entertainment Tonight.  He checks the date, seeing that it took place just over a year ago.
Rising to his feet and standing on the mattress, Dean pulls the t-shirt over his head, tossing it towards the side of the bed. Well, if Cas is going to knot an Alpha Recessive Omega, he should get to see just how much of Dean is the classic alpha.  Hooking his fingers in the waistband of his boxers and pajama pants, Dean tugs them down to his ankles, then kicks them in directions unknown.
The burst of giggles that erupts from her petite body calms Dean a lot.  “Are you joking?  Castiel came out of the womb preferring cock.”
He sighs deeply, blowing air from his lips, “What’s the popular opinion?”
I’m having surgery to remove a rather large melanoma tumor from my right butt cheek.  Yeah, a gay man with cancer in his ass, the humor of the situation isn’t lost on me.”  Dean smiles faintly.
Logically the omega’s aware of who is draining him currently, BUT his hormones only sense his alpha drinking his blood.  Slick slides down his butt cheeks, wetting his boxers.  Suddenly, Dean has no interest in pulling his hand back.  Arousal spikes between the two men as the Shedim slurps against his open wound.
“Who is at the lake house?”  Dean begs, moving so Sam can be placed inside.
After some time a third finger is added. The intrusion is welcomed and Dean hums in approval. The sensation is pleasant, but he can tell that Novak is intentionally ignoring Dean’s happy spot. The sub considers directing Cas to nail his prostate, but the slow build of pleasure under his flesh is good enough for now, besides, he does want to orgasm on Cas’s cock.
The toy doesn’t move.
Lily Sunder will keep the name on file in case of any health concerns. The baby will be theirs, completely.  Yet Dean finds his attention tugging with the desire to know, to put a face to his child’s features.  The chilling part is Meg was certain he and Cas would know the name.  Meg will always be in the child’s life, cool Aunt Meg.
“Shit.”  He turns glancing around the room searching for a certain set of blue eyes.  “Fuck.  How do you know the relevance of that specific number?”
Castiel accepts, shaking his mate’s hand before placing a soft kiss to his palm. “Yes.”
Love to ALL!  Questions, Comments, and Concerns are always encouraged.
He scrunches his face in disgust at being compared to a fucking daisy, lifting his duffel, “Is there a place I can toss this while we do the chatting stuff?”
Squinting with one eye, Dean mumbles into an overstuffed pillow, “Where the fuck am I?”
“Thank you.”  Castiel shakes his hand.
“Yes, and the visitor reception, so we just call it the common area or commons. If you have visitors during your stay, you can interact with them here.”
A woman with dark brown hair and a sweet smile dressed in generic blue nursing scrubs enters the room.
“Not to worry young Padawan.  Your alpha has given me permission to set up my computers in your library and teach you all my infinite knowledge.”
“Thanks.”  Dean wipes the drying blood from his face.
“Wait.”  Krissy calls from her corner.  No one has moved an inch.  “You are both Omegas?”
“That offer is severely tempting, but he put me on his list.  He knows I’m coming.  If I back out now, it will be a sign of weakness.  Nope there is no turning back.”  He heads to the shower when, for a brief moment, he almost kisses Castiel’s cheek.  They both freeze, Dean’s lips hovering near Cas’s face.  “Sorry.”  He blushes as he dashes out of the room.
He is about to scold her for calling Krissy property when his mouth drops open wide.  Suddenly, what Dorothy is asking dawns on Dean, “Oh hell no, you can’t stash her in my home.  Don’t you have a safe house or something?”
A disturbance in the force has Dean’s bed rumbling.  He rolls over to bust whoever dare interrupt his nap, “What the hell Bradbury?”
