“JARVIS?” Steve asked, before Tony could stop him.
He decided not to respond, hoping that Steve would be convinced he was in fact asleep. The effort was probably futile, but Tony liked to humor himself that he could still get away with some little things.
“Why does there always have to be something wrong with me, Cap? Why do I always have to be the one breaking down?” God, he hated when this version of him came out. But Steve was starting to piss him off. “Kinda seems like you want to fix me or something. Well guess what, Cap? Many have tried and all of them failed.”
Blade had also eventually grown tired of the knives pulling little reaction from Steve, and had moved on to other tactics, such as breaking bones. He might not have been as big as Steve, but he was certainly strong enough to cause damage. And he’d correctly assumed that broken bones would take longer for the serum to heal.
“Can you blame me?” Tony said, exasperated. “Steve, I don’t know what I would do if we tried this and it ended badly. I’m not good at letting people in, okay? And no one else has ever made me feel this scared.” Tony looked away at those last words, not able to meet Steve’s eyes with the admission. “What if you get tired of me? Or realize you don’t like me the way you thought? Not in the way I would...”
Steve recalled what he’d first thought of Stark when he’d met him- a man who was so arrogant, always mouthing off, seemed ill-suited for a spot on the Avengers. But then they’d moved in, Steve and the team. Tony was always working on upgrades for his own armor, but also for the rest of the team. It was his way of doing the best he could to protect the people they were responsible for. Steve had slowly begun to understand that almost everything Tony did was for others. It was only his outer countenance that he made appear self absorbed.
“My apartment?” Steve asked. “Seven o’clock?”
Well, you’re doing a bang up job of that, so far, Steve thought to himself, swallowing thickly around the lump in his throat. His steak wasn’t tasting so good anymore.
Him and the rest of the team had been gathered in the communal living room, watching random television shows for about two hours now.  It was around the hour mark that Tony had decided Steve’s arm was a pillow.
“You don’t approve?” Steve asked, his tone a little sardonic, considering Nat wasn’t his parent. But he was also a little hurt by her reaction, even if it wouldn’t change his mind about anything. Steve noticed Bruce out of the corner of his eye, grabbing his coffee and shuffling quietly to the armchair by the television, giving Nat and Steve space. “You don’t seem surprised, either,” Steve continued.
His split lip twinged a bit at the pull of Steve’s lips against his, but he didn’t let that stop him. It did of course draw Steve’s attention once they’d pulled away. Steve’s smile had turned down at the corners slightly as he traced his thumb over the cut.
It made him realize how acquainted to this century he’d really become. He remembered a time when nothing felt familiar here. Everyone he’d known before the war had died, except Peggy, of course, who Steve only visited when he was feeling particularly selfish or masochistic. But it didn’t hurt like it did before. Not now that he had a family and a purpose.
Tony had been trying to placate Kray but the pressure of the gun under Steve’s chin had increased until he winced, and Tony had insisted they search his person. The men holding him had frisked him forcefully, throwing him to the ground when they found nothing.
“But he’s wrong, Nat. If we all went our whole lives denying ourselves happiness because we were scared, no one would ever be happy. And we could be missing out on something great, that might never have gone wrong if we’d given it a chance.” Nat looked down at the counter again. “It may be selfish, but I won’t deny myself or Tony this, Nat. I can’t. Not even if it ends in flames. Which I don’t think it will.”
“What?  Was that the last episode?” Steve looked around at all of them.
Tony had been in the process of being rushed to the hospital, while Steve had been calmly reading the newspaper and sipping his coffee.  It made him feel sick.
“Guess I couldn’t even manage to do that better than my father.”
“You alright there, Cap?” Natasha asked.
Usually, Bruce or Tony would help him out, but rarely were either of them awake this early on a Saturday.
“No you may not, JARVIS,” Tony said, wincing slightly as he finished implanting the micro-repeaters into his arm. They were microscopic transmitters that would send an electric signal to pieces of his suit, telling them exactly where to form around him.
Space. Aliens. A wormhole in the sky. A cave in the desert. A hole in his chest. Agony. Screaming.
“Is that what you are? Bi?” Steve asked, thinking of Pepper.
Steve was honestly panicking a bit, when Tony took pity on him.
“You will,” Nat said, with certainty. Steve nodded. He would, but he didn’t want to scare Tony off. The time would come when it felt right to say.
“Yes, fine. Even the frown lines get my heart racing.”
“Six thirty-one AM, Sir,” came JARVIS’ soothing tone. “You slept for five hours and four minutes.”
They shot into action immediately, and after that, the battle was bound to end soon. The Avengers were just too strong together, not to mention the SHIELD agents who made the process quicker. Before even half an hour had passed, Kray’s men were being cuffed and ushered into the custody of law enforcement.
Tony only gave him a half-hearted glare and closed his eyes, rubbing his forehead in the spot between his eyebrows. “JARVIS picked up some sort of interference last night, but it disappeared within an hour. ‘s probably nothing,” Tony paused at Steve’s expression. “Everything’s fine, Steve. I’m not actively avoiding sleep, or anything. I just got caught up with...stuff.”
Steve was kind of confused why everyone was so interested in his opinion.
After not meeting much resistance thus far, a shock of adrenaline shot through Steve when they entered another hallway and it was filled with men, all previously aiming the other direction and now with guns trained on him and Tony.
“You have nothing to make up for, Tony. I’m sure when you find out what went wrong, you’ll realize there was nothing we could’ve done to stop it. And I know you’ll make the Tower’s defenses even stronger after this because that’s what you do,” Steve said. “The team somehow breaks your incredible inventions all the time, and you find a way to make it so they can never break it the same way twice.”
“Yes, right this way.”
Peter’s little face turned red with his cries as he flailed his fists and kicked his legs in an outright tantrum. Tony tried to shush him and settled the baby on his chest, laying back down on the bed so Steve could snuggle up to them both.
“No, no, it’s okay, you did so good, you did really
and finish this damn thing, or I’m divorcing you.”
The last month had been rough; HYDRA was no fool when it came to protecting secrets, and this one had been particularly tough to crack. T’Challa’s contact had been a lifesaver when it came to finding the hidden entrance, but that had been their only stroke of luck the entire mission. That, and leaving with the same number of limbs that they had arrived with, unless he counted Bucky’s metal arm getting partially blown off again. Sure, he’d expected HYDRA to be vigilant, but he’d never seen so many people be willing to use themselves as weapons, some with live bombs strapped to their chests to prevent the team from getting close.
“He’s—yeah, he’s mine, technically,” Tony answered uncomfortably, “Anyway, I’ll get to that. So. The experiment. They collected our DNA profiles to then use with—with a synthesized egg to create zygotes. Some of them came to term, but most of them did not. Those that came to term were then watched for signs of its—of superpowers or whatever. Those that didn’t show fast enough were terminated.”
It was quiet until Bucky cleared his throat, pretending that he didn’t see Steve’s shoulders tighten.
Rhodey grimaced, eyeing Steve and Natasha over Tony’s shoulder.
"Sweetheart! We need to get going or we’re going to be late!” Tony called up the stairs, fumbling with his jacket zipper for a moment before finally getting it hooked and zipping up the stupid jacket.
“We shall see, Mister Stark. Until then, enjoy your stay. Oh, and don’t get too comfortable—I have a few instructions of my own that I would like to give you with the subject present.”
“Coming,” he called, finishing up his hair.
“Let me go find Thor and Bruce to help with translation, and we can move upstairs for food and talk,” Natasha said, “I think the boys will enjoy having a new person around to annoy.”
Steve’s red, blotchy, tear-stained and oddly bruised face.
“I think you fucked my brains out,” Tony answered, grinning at Steve’s laugh, “Gods, you were wonderful--you
Once he held his hand out, PJ griped but slid his tiny hand into Tony’s palm, slipping his other hand’s thumb into his mouth. With Steve trailing behind them, the trio slowly made their way to the elevator down to the medbay. Thankfully, once the doors opened to the familiar hallway, there was already a nurse waiting with a bed, to which Tony sent off a silent thank you to JARVIS for thinking ahead. Carefully, and with Steve’s help, he got up onto the bed, not realizing how terrible he actually felt until he was laying down.
want to know. What happens to Peter if you get hurt?” Rhodey asked.
, he thought distantly, feeling the warm liquid run over his fingers.
from one box, “How ‘bout this one, kiddo? My mama used to read this to me all the time.”
“I do not understand,” he said, failing to not flinch under the Warlord’s surprisingly gentle hand, “I am not from these lands—”
Steve’s voice startled him out of his thoughts, so he pasted on a smile, putting his arms back up to wrap around Peter despite his new apparatus.
Oddly silent, Steve merely stared at Tony and PJ, his fist curled under his chin. After a beat, he rose from his chair, taking the few short strides across the room to stand next to them. Feeling Steve’s hot gaze just above him, Tony nearly bolted, ignoring every fiber in his body as he forced himself to look up at the Captain.
Steve’s voice sounded very far away despite Tony knowing that he was standing right next to him. He tried to talk, but his tongue was heavy, and his knees gave when he tried to move closer to whisper. If it were not for Thor and Steve’s quick movements, he surely would have dropped Peter. Rather, Thor took the babe as Steve helped lower Tony to the ground, keeping his head elevated in his lap.
to you?”
“He and Sam will get along well,” Tony mused, “Why not take him with you? I am sure Clint’s translations will suffice for the moment.”
“Go, my love. I will find you. I promise,” He vowed.
Steve snarled and tried to lurch at Tony, but the shackles held tight and kept him from doing anything more than leaning forward. It was terrifying, to say the least; he had never seen a feral Alpha, let alone a
Steve huffed and leaned down to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead, then moved down to kiss Peter. He smiled and tugged Tony up, placing a hand on his lower back to guide him toward the door. Stunned, Tony slightly dragged his feet, forcing Steve to nearly push him down the hallway. He reached up to touch the place on his forehead where Steve had kissed him, only to bring his hand down and look at his fingers.
Tony couldn’t help but smile again, happiness swelling in his heart and making him feel warm and fuzzy. Steve must have noticed, because he bumped their shoulders together and pushed the cup back, making Tony eat his own share as well.
matter, at least, in terms of needing it to live. I, ah, I just notice the others, that is all. And the way they look at you. I know they would never touch you, but the hunger in their eyes can be… concerning.”
Steve growled lowly, only able to get his hand through the bars due to his size. He touched Tony’s knee with his fingertips, then let out a pathetic whine when he realized he could not touch him more.
,” Tony hissed through gritted teeth despite every cell in his body wanting to tell Steve the truth in a desperate plea for comfort.
need to bathe,” he murmured, gently patting Peter’s back as he stood to pad over to the big bed, “How does that sound, hm? A long, hot bath should be good for both of us. Then we can put on new clothes and have a little nap.”
“Silly boy. Have we not been feeding you?” Tony teased as he cleaned off his and Peter’s hands with a rag.
“Babe?” Tony mumbled against his lips, nudging Steve back a little, “What? Did I say something?”
“I mean, during the war, I knew I wasn’t possible. Being on the front lines…I knew that to have any semblance of normalcy it would have to wait for the fight to be over. And when I had Peggy—”
“Only one more of those left, then in middle school we don’t gotta do that anymore,” Bucky was saying in the boys’ locker room, shucking off his shepherd costume to put on day clothes.
Tony thought, forcing his feet to move faster so Steve would not become suspicious of his tarrying.
“Fear not, friend. Our Prime is quite kind and does not expect any sort of customary proceedings from you,” Thor said as he nodded in understanding, “The Southern cities are well known for their harsh customs, yes? Especially of royal Omegas. We have no such customs here. You have the same freedoms as everyone else in the castle. Though, when the time comes, you may be asked to mother the Prime’s child, but that would be long down the road. Other than that, you are as free as you—Tony?”
“Shh, my love, I did not mean to upset you, I am alright, shhh,” he soothed, going out to the hallway to cool off, “Everything is okay. No need to cry, darling.”
She nodded and led the way, keeping a hand on the hilt of her sword as they trooped down to the dungeons. Thankfully, it was empty save for the two new prisoners. Rhodey was in the closest cell on the right, curled up in the corner with his shackled leg stuck out.  Steve had been placed in the farthest cell and was chained to the wall by his wrists and middle, as he was still struggling and snarling despite clearly not being able to break free.
kids. And maybe I want to give him a good life away from SHIELD’s eyes and treat him the way Howard never treated me, and show him kindness for once in his small and already miserable life.”
“Of course, Sir. Approximately two hours until landing.”
With PJ clutching around his neck and the elephant dangling over his back, Tony padded down to his personal elevator, taking the lift to his garage. He carefully smoothed circles over the boy’s back as he exited the Tower into the night, starting his usual walk around the block when he himself could not sleep.
“You miss him already, my love?” He murmured, “He will come back. I know he will.”
“Fuck,” Steve cursed under his breath, immediately covering his mouth with his hand.
As if he heard her, PJ made a soft noise before curling in toward Tony’s stomach. Blinking in surprise, Tony sucked in a breath, hastily looking between Pepper and the babe.
could prepare him for the sight the greeted him when the elevator doors dinged open. Calling it a temper-tantrum was the understatement of the century, considering PJ had literally flung himself to the ground, screaming and crying and causing his face to become blotchy and red from the lack of oxygen. Really, Tony would have laughed at how ridiculous he looked, but seeing Steve curled up in the corner with his hands over his ears, he did the only thing he could think of.
Rhodey interrupted him with a startled laugh, making Bucky turn around to see Tony flipping him off from the couch. Bucky simply flipped it back despite knowing that Tony couldn’t see him.
“Make yourself at home,” Tony grumbled, pretending that the Alpha’s scent was not even more pleasing up close, “Would you like me to lay on you as well?”
“Sorry. What’s up?” He tried again.
Tony carefully shifted Peter from his chest to his arm, slowly sitting up to make sure that he would not suddenly become nauseous. Surprised that he could actually stand, he carefully trudged over from his bed to where the medicinal jar still sat and single-handedly unscrewed it to drink another dosage.  He gagged less this time around but still made a pitiful noise, not at all enjoying the taste of the sludge.
, Tony.”
“My father would find me. He has eyes and ears everywhere, so nowhere except these lands are safe. He is too… frugal to put men at risk by tracking me up this way. If all goes as planned, he will announce my death in a fortnight’s time and I will be able to live freely,” Tony explained softly, gently easing Peter out of his bundle so he could hold the baby up against his chest, tucking his head into his neck, “I have friends who still live there so if I ever return, I could stay safe, but…”
“If it helps, I’ll be there to back you up,” Bruce said, rolling back over to them to put a hand on Tony’s arm, “You wanted the responsibility. The kid isn’t going to go anywhere, regardless if Steve decides to be a part of his life or not.”
Turning back to the kid, Tony tucked the elephant in with PJ before settling the covers around them and sitting on the edge of the bed.
Tony followed Bruce out of the armory and down the hallway until they hit the last doorway, from which they could see a golden glow. As they got closer, it began to warm, and Tony felt himself easily relax into the familiar heat.
“It could be much worse, Mister Stark,” a voice with a heavy German accent called out.
“God, honey, I’m so sorry,” he whispered, reaching down to cup Tony’s cheek and brush his thumb over his scraped cheekbone, “Look at you—I should have been there to protect you, this is all my fault, if I’d told you sooner you wouldn’t be in this mess—”
“I regret this so much,” Tony said mournfully as Steve giggled and continued:
Steve hummed and rested a hand over the small of Tony’s back, occasionally letting it slip down to grope the man’s ass. Tony squeaked each time but he kept moving forward, ducking past tree branches and brush until they came upon the lake. He stopped and gasped as he looked around, taking in the tall waterfall that cascaded into the shimmering body of water and the dense foliage that seemed to encapsulate them in their own little paradise.
“Should I ask about the fire?”
He watched her stand and leave, keeping his arms wrapped around PJ. He huffed softly when the elevator doors closed behind her, turning his attention back to the boy in his lap.
“You alright?” He asked, “Do you want to go beat people up to feel manly?”
Carefully, he picked Peter up to hand to Steve, feeling a tug on his heart once he saw his baby happily nestled in Steve’s arms. Peter appeared to be quite small compared to the Warlord, but Steve looked at him with such fondness that it was clear that the babe was safe with him. The tableau vanished as quickly as it came; Steve gently laid Peter down in his crib before going to the bathroom, presumably to find whatever he needed to fix Tony up. He still felt awkward about the whole thing, and by the time Steve came back he had the furs pulled up to his nose in an attempt to hide.
He knew Steve could not have understood what Thor had said, but he nodded anyway, gently tugging on Tony’s hair. Tony melted under the gesture, subconsciously tilting his head back into Steve’s palm. The comforting, possessive touch of an Alpha usually rendered any Omega a puddle of feelings and slick, but his body took the affection as a steadying gesture, easing his nerves and giving him the strength to stand up from the bed. As he did, the nursing bra he had rejected fell to the floor; Steve bent down to pick it up and offered it to Thor, talking rapidly while motioning to Tony and Peter.
“Papa’s not blue. Sorry, honey. I’m one of a kind,” he tried, figuring he was asking if Steve had a hidden light.
He did not like using his Omega tone very often, but the emphasis did the trick and Steve looked shocked. He recovered quickly and nodded, mumbling something that Tony figured was an apology before settling on the pillows without trying to communicate more. Silence stretched on between them with the only sounds being Peter’s quiet snuffles and Tony’s occasional cough and sniffle. The room felt awkward until Steve sighed and slid out of the bed, shaking his hair out and stretching his muscles. Tony tilted his head over to watch him, pretending that he was not already missing the Alpha’s scent.
“Yeah. That’s to turn the shower on, and it’ll have varying pressures as you move it up. The one next to it is water temperature. I was going to get you a fancy label-maker so you could label it yourself, but now I’m not so sure,” Tony grumbled, ignoring the squelch noise his shoes made as he started to gather up his tools and pack them away into his toolbox, “If you want more shit, you know where to find me. And if you do that again, I’m letting Barton into your art supplies again.”
Letting Steve have his moment, Tony pulled away, resting against PJ’s bed. He carefully observed the two, noting how the tension in the Captain’s shoulders dissipated the longer PJ hugged him. Eventually, they pulled apart, both seeming a little perkier and a lot less upset.
“As far as we can tell, the serum has been healing him and will continue to do so,” the nurse—Shelly—replied softly, “He just needs to take it easy until he can build up more bone mass and some muscular strength. Regular physical therapy should help, as well as a good diet. If anything comes up or seems irregular, bring him right back down. We can have a bed open for him at all times for a few months, just in case.”
“Why? Even Bruce could sit on him,” Tony snorted, “Why does he even care? And wh—wait. Holy shit, Bucky, what
With two quick strides across the room, Tony was up against the bed, watching Steve pick at the bed furs, his eyebrows drawn together and his mouth pulled into a frown. He did not want to interrupt whatever deep thought the Prime was having, but calming intimacy demanded it of him. So, against his better judgment, Tony climbed up onto the bed and squirreled his way under Steve’s arms to sit in his lap, kneeling on either side of his hips instead of wrapping his legs around him completely. Steve’s hands immediately settled on his back, pulling him in so he could rest his forehead against Tony’s sternum. They stayed like that for a long while, until Tony could feel through their bond that Steve had settled down.
,” Steve growled, his good hand forming a fist at his side.
,” he demanded, grinning at Steve’s hearty laughter, “C’mon, pedal to the metal, chop chop—”
Tony froze. Had Howard sent men to find him? Had he miscalculated his father’s negligence toward him? The thought of having to return home and face his father with Peter nauseated him to the point that he shuddered and hunched over, expecting himself to vomit out of fear.
“He—ah, yes, he believes you,” Thor said, eyebrows furrowed as the Prime continued to talk, “He wants to know why the son of a rich man who has decimated thousands—”
“Hey! I was
Careful to not scare Steve off, Tony held out his hand, waiting until the Warlord was close enough to gently touch his hip. He held him steady and, upon seeing that Steve was not going to cart him off and ravish him, peeled off his ruined bandage to reveal the red wound underneath.
Thor’s brows scrunched and he quickly said something to Steve, who turned and gave Tony an equally quizzical look.
Jarvis shrugged and winked before leaving, closing the door behind him with a soft
“Oh gods, what were you doing on the
Clint set his jaw and led them through a series of twists and turns in the castle, undoubtedly taking them to a secret exit meant for this kind of escape. He and Rhodey readied the horses while Bruce held Peter so Tony could clamber on and then take the babe in his arms. Bruce swung himself up in front, leaving a horse for Rhodey and Clint on either side. It was not ideal, but Bruce did not smell of an Alpha and it allowed Tony a moment of rest as he clung to him and Peter for dear life.
“And what of mama?” Tony interrupted, shoving down the pain at hearing Mary’s name, “Does she know?”
. No way.”
Tony shook his head. “I feel thirsty and sore, and maybe a little overheated, but I am okay.”
Steve’s laughter filled his ear and Tony smiled, silently thanking whoever was out there for giving him the best husband in the world.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve answered softly, a fond smile twitching up his lips, “Sweetheart, you know I love you for all of you, yeah? Even the parts I don’t know yet. You don’t have to look like you’re about to give me your third testicle in a box. I promise that I’ll love you just as much, if not more, after looking at whatever it is.”
“I would if I could, and you know it.”
“Bruce! My favorite!” The god laughed, going over to drag the scientist up into a hug.
what he meant.”
“Dammit!” He shouted, wishing he could kick something without seriously injuring himself.
. I thought I’d lost you
, I’ve never even been around breastfeeding
Embarrassment spotted his cheeks when he thought back to their anniversary, to his gift, to what Steve had read—
“Oh, I have doe eyes?”
Steve snorted at the nickname, shouldering his assault rifle as he followed Bucky to their jeep, taking the passenger side as Bucky roared out of the compound, their team members not far behind. They sped off into the desert, joking to each other on the way as they skimmed up and down dunes. As they started to converge on the location, a large explosion rocked the car, making Steve shout a curse as they all watched smoke and fire billow up out of the horizon. Bucky put the pedal to the metal and shifted into the top gear, pushing the car as fast as it could go toward the site. They’d barely skimmed 100 miles per hour when he slammed on the brakes.
Immediately, Steve’s hand latched onto his hip and dug in, conveying his pain despite not making a sound. Tony shushed him as best as he could and tried to focus on the stitches, despite having to smell Steve’s pain and agony. He finished the last stitch and carefully covered the whole wound with bandaging, wrapping it around Steve’s waist to help keep it in place.
Tony frowned as he put down his book for the second time, wanting to just get through the chapter. But, after seeing that the redhead girl had bothered to put down her dolls to talk to him, he figured he better go. With a nod, Tony slid off his chair and put his book away before letting her take his hand, dragging him over to a box in the back of the room. The talkative blond was still there, talking as if the girl had never left.
The Captain paused, his hands stilling in the bag as Tony’s words washed over him. He looked up, painfully obvious hope spreading over his features.
“James, take Tony, Clint, Bruce, and three of the horses and run,” Sam instructed, eyeing the small family as they met in the center of the room, “You need to keep him and the baby safe, as far away from here as possible.”
“You poor thing. You look like you were run over by multiple carriages,” he said to change the subject, smiling at Steve’s laugh.
Steve paused, flicking his tongue out to wet his lips before biting his bottom lip, the crease between he brows deepening as he thought.
“Hey, honey bear, good of you to drop in,” he slurred, reaching over to put a hand on Rhodey’s knee, “How’d ya get here?”
. Trembling, Steve reached into his shirt to dig out his dog tags; he pulled them off to hold in his hands and thumbed between them to get to his wedding ring. With a quiet sniffle, he took the ring off the chain and slipped it onto his hand, flexing his fingers as they adjusted to the familiar weight. Just as he replaced his tags around his neck, one of the nurses quietly approached with a clipboard.
The choked-off sob from Steve was telling. Not wanting to delay any longer, Tony took hold of himself and canted his hips to slide his cock between Steve’s cheeks a few times before pushing in. He gently smoothed a hand down the Alpha’s back to help him relax, letting out a quiet little sigh once his head popped past the rim.
“I think you being scared will scare him more,” the Captain said calmly, attempting to be a solid presence, “Think you can keep it in just a little more? We can go…talk, once he’s asleep.”
Steve nearly bent Tony in half in order to lean down, but Tony did not care as he could finally nibble at Steve’s scent glands. All it took was for Steve to nudge his sweet spot and stars exploded in Tony’s eyes as he came and bit into Steve’s glands, immediately tasting blood. Steve cried out in pain and bit Tony back, feeling his knot begin to swell. He heard Tony gasp, but he pushed in as deep as he could, locking them together. He shuddered and collapsed down onto his forearms, twitching as he came over and over again.
“Yeah, you’re a good guy, honeybear,” he mumbled, “Should’a been stealing hugs from you sooner.”
“They wanted to know if we had killed you and the child,” Steve answered with a frown, “However, they did not ask it in a way that was… angry? It was more of a cordial question than a demand.”
The horror that dawned on Steve’s face was too much for Tony to bear. He looked down at the floor and closed his eyes against the tears that threatened to fall.
“I think we should leave Stark be. The child is content with him, so as am I,” Thor mentioned with a shrug, leaning one arm on Clint.
a funny situation, I do
“Yeah, me too,” Tony agreed, reaching over to put his hand on PJ’s back to help the boy settle on Steve’s chest, “Me too.”
“Yeah, sure. You and your super soldier metabolism are going to take all my crumbs,” Tony grunted, licking his fingers free of jelly before moving to wash his hands and carefully clean the reactor, “How did he go down? Fussy?”
Tony thought, awarding himself a point.
. Realizing that he was almost invisible for the first time in his life, Tony teared up, a pained giggle escaping his lips. Steve immediately looked over at him, causing Tony to clear his throat and school his features.
“No,” Steve shook his head, turning to move toward Tony like a cat on the prowl as the other backed up, “You love
Tony set PJ down on his feet, both men following after the tot as he raced toward his bedroom. They made sure he got into the bathroom okay before relaxing, with Steve wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist.
“Tony. It’s okay,” Bruce said gently, putting a hand on Tony’s arm, “We recovered the elephant. He’s in PJ’s room, all nice and cleaned. I’ll go get stuff put in motion, then be down later to help with PJ, okay? Now you, young man, you be good for your Daddy, okay?”
Darkness.
“So…I’m not defense?” Tony asked, feeling his heartbeat quicken.
Bucky left and shut the door behind himself, leaving Steve and Tony to stare at each other while Peter slept. Steve stepped forward and Tony immediately flinched, making the Warlord pause and fill the bond with hurt again.
“Yeah. Thank you,” he mumbled, a bit embarrassed.
“Dude, I have no idea,” Scott answered, relieved to toss his packet onto the floor, “You’d think the bad guys would have
As realization slapped him across the face, Steve’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline and his eyes bugged as he stared at the floor.
“There you are, my love. Nice and safe,” he whispered.
That thing which he still hasn’t told Tony about. That huge secret that Steve had been hiding and instead covered up because Bucky had told Tony they’d beefed up at boot camp. Technically, it was true, but Tony had just been in the hospital, and he hadn’t been sure how Tony would have taken the news. Past that, there was always another reason to delay it, especially when he was busy in the field, taking more bullets than humanly possible and still coming out on the other side.
Before he could apologize, Tony watched Steve walk out of the hospital room, leaving Bruce to glare down at the engineer. He tried to say something in his defense, but Bruce shook his head, taking
“Not for now, point break. Go to the compound. You’ve already been and know your way around,” Tony decided, scratching at his goatee, “Is that everyone? Yes? Okay. Natty, dear, please tell good ol’ Cyclops what’s been going on. As much as I loathe to admit it, SHIELD may have some men on the ground that know things that we should know. But only divulge on a need to know.”
“I’m here to talk to you all about the Avengers Initiative.”
Having been fairly mute for the whole ordeal, Steve made a gruff noise and let go of Tony’s arms, watching as the engineer crept to the edge of the bed. He picked up the elephant, shushing the child as he slowly offered the toy as a sign of peace. Despite the boy’s continued wails, he seemed to allow Tony to pick him up, elephant and all, holding him close to his chest.
Bucky walked out through the thicket with a grunt, shaking burrs off of his legs before going over to join the men, shield in hand.
“Steve,” Sam said slowly, looking up from his last hotcake, “What…what did you use?”
Tony tensed under Steve’s hand, still unsure of the Captain’s intentions. He shrugged it off as he stood, attempting to play it off coolly.
. I love you, darling.”
“You stay here with St—
“I was able to recover some files on the specific torture methodology used on PJ,” Natasha started, her eyes glancing over to Tony, “You may want to sit for this. Even I felt uncomfortable reading it.”
“Like a bitch, but I’ll live,” Tony laughed softly, only to grunt as he tried to move, “What happened? Where the
“No. No, I cannot. I love you too much,” Steve said honestly.
, “What are you doing here?”
“Steve?”
With a tiny nod, the boy slipped his tiny hand into Tony’s palm, squeezing his hand tightly. Offering back a weak smile, Tony helped PJ to shed his Captain America pajamas, setting them outside of the shower.
“Want you,” he admitted quietly, turning his puppy dog eyes up to meet Tony’s concerned ones.
Grinning at Steve’s frown, Tony settled down in his bed, holding PJ close until Steve could crawl in and settle. Carefully, he moved the boy to be cradled between them, smiling once PJ’s sniffles started to subside.
Steve tried to pull Tony into his lap, but Tony lightly smacked his hands, keeping the Alpha in check while he bustled around the bathroom. He ran the bathwater after cleaning up the mess from the haircut, then found a cloth to use, only to turn around and see Steve sliding down into the water with a groan.
Oblivious, Steve merely smiled down at Tony, reaching up to cup his cheek until Tony moved away. They walked down to the dining room and Tony sat in the same chair that he had been proffered the night prior while Steve headed off toward the kitchen. He adjusted Peter to be up against his shoulder, patting his back as he suddenly remembered the after-feeding ritual. Pleased to hear the baby burp, he rubbed soothing circles, only to pause when his shoulder began to feel damp. He pulled Pete back, and seeing spit on his lips, sighed.
“Tony, you’re not even forty,” Steve answered patiently, an amused smile on his face, “Everyone’s knees crack. You just looked less…graceful, than usual.”
“Steve?” Bucky asked softly.
you knew.”
“Steve?”
“You may have it once your groin and backside are covered properly,” Tony answered, crossing his legs, “Otherwise, you can sit at my feet like a
“Yeah, she sure is, isn’t she?” Tony answered quietly, crouching down next to the boy in the hopes of keeping him from going into another fit, “That’s Natasha. She’s Russian. That means she’s from a really,
“Uh, yeah. Ma’s not happy I picked that up from camp. She’s not happy that you haven’t been coming around, either. Every time I brought—uh, not you, home, she’d get on my case. Said I needed to keep an eye on you, said it’s not fair that she doesn’t get to see the baby of the family anymore. I told her you were busy with college, but she said that wasn’t like you. Said you didn’t get busy with school, just with Howard.”
Oh no.
“Beautiful, love,” he whispered, bending down to kiss the baby’s forehead, “Be good, yeah? We need to take care of your nice things now.”
“Yelena,” Tony whispered, ducking his head, “I am sorry. There was nothing I could do.”
you are ready,” Steve said again, turning his head to kiss Tony and nip at his bottom lip, “You beg so well, but I am not budging on that.”
“Would he even let you? He seems like the kind of Alpha with a stick so far up his ass that there’s no room for yours,” Rhodey said, putting Peter to his chest and covering his small ear with his hand, “I doubt that he would willingly present for you.”
Feeling Steve’s eyes on him, Tony couldn’t help but close his eyes, wishing the floor would swallow him whole.
Steve clicked his tongue, making Tony laugh and lean up on his toes for another kiss. He was happy to stand there and make out with his momentary-fiancé, but Steve’s embarrassment from the public show kept him in check, merely peppering the man’s face with small, thankful kisses.
“I told you, I don’t do that anymore,” Steve said from down the hallway, padding into the bedroom with Bucky in tow, “It’s good that he’s eating, though. Is something wrong?”
Tony stared at Steve, fiddling with the straps of his backpack awkwardly. He shifted his gaze to his feet, shuffling a bit; he’d never been to a school like this before, and he wasn’t even sure what a cubby
“He’s right,” Thor nodded from his place on the couch, “We are at your call, Captain.”
that he was hiding and using crafting weaponry as an excuse for his absence. No, he was only pulling his weight in the kingdom, and if that meant he missed a dinner here or there, then so be it. Steve was capable enough of taking care of Peter for a night.
Taking the hint, the intern nodded and rifled through a few folders before pulling out the certificate, shakily handing it over with two pens. Tony flashed his trademark smile as he and Steve filled it out together, unable to help giggling like they were about to get caught. Once they pushed it back to the intern, she stumbled off, presumably to go have it approved.
“Oh, right. Sorry, peanut. Let’s get you back upstairs.”
“You are alright,” he heard Steve say, “The slick helps, I promise. It means you are nice and loose, and that helps with the, uh, healing process.”
“Let us take a walk first, while the day is new,” Steve suggested, “I want to show you the gardens before the townsfolk are up and about, yeah? Then we can take our time.”
Steve let out a dry laugh that turned into a cough. He winced when he turned onto his side, but it melted into a lazy smile and put Tony’s fears at ease.
He tried to shake him, but no response came from the oddly still body. Tony tried calling his name a few more times, but no response came from PJ. Terror rippling through his muscles, he quickly reached out to check the boy’s pulse, weak but fluttering under his fingertips.
Tony carefully restacked the drawings and put them away before turning to the composition book, unpeeling its sticky note to toss in the trash and miss. He pulled it out and stared at it for a moment, wondering what Steve could have possibly put in it; he’d already touched on the big stuff, now what? Curiosity got the better of him, and he opened it, only to burst out laughing.
“I thought you liked my camo best,” Steve teased, looking at Tony through the mirror.
Sure, not the best pep talk to give when completely naked, but it hurried Tony along, right up until he needed to get under the spray.
“You really gotta stop talking like a weirdo, Thor,” Clint sighed, “We get the whole Norse thing, but really?”
flying across the field—
Carefully, Tony sat up, ignoring the black spots in his vision as he shifted PJ to his right hip. With a little difficulty, he managed to get to his feet and walk them over to the door, ignoring how the lackey poked his back with the muzzle of the weapon.
The jet was silent again, all heads turned to look at the Captain.
Steve faltered, face morphing into a multitude of emotions, but not offering any verbal response. Instead, he pulled PJ away from his chest and handed him off to Tony, attempting not to look at either of them. From the jolted move, PJ woke up startled, looking up at Tony wide-eyed before screaming, ripping himself away from the brunet’s hold. He fell onto the floor and scrabbled backward, bumping against the bed frame with a soft cry. Tony quickly stood and held fast to Steve’s arm, wrenching him back with a snarl.
“Juice, a few crackers, and then Clint gave him sweet potatoes,” Steve ticked off, “They’re all acceptable for kids.”
Surprise and barely-contained excitement washed over Steve’s face, setting his blue eyes alight. Tony could feel the happiness spread through the bond, causing him to shake his head fondly.
“And I?” Thor said next, leaning up from the wall he’d propped himself against, “I’m not certain that any Asgardian intel will be helpful.”
“Unless I get out of my leg shackles, no, it’s just me,” he said, rolling his eyes.
“Steve, that’s great! We never thought you would grow out of it, that’s amazing—what,” Tony said, arms up as Steve’s hulking figure wrapped him up in a hug, “Steve? Alright, big guy, it’s alright, you’re alright—”
“Work in my laboratory. Keep house with the others. If you would like, I can show you the rest of the castle. I heard through the vine that you might like to see our forge and armory--and, if you are interested, I thought we could start language lessons?” Bruce said, “Perhaps some basics to practice so you and the Prime can communicate outside of gesturing.”
Tony snorted and sat down at his desk, pulling out the first drawing. A smile stretched across his lips, recognizing Steve in uniform, a child with a teddy bear hugging his knee as he protected both of them with his shield raised high. Something looked familiar about the scene, and as looked over it, he physically leaned back in his chair in surprise when he realized what it was.
“Eat and drink, then get Peter ready for the journey.”
Steve nodded, staring blankly back at Bucky’s concerned look. After a second, Bucky sighed and nodded, moving and sitting down. The three men sat together in the silent room, each in their own state of misery as the minutes ticked by in agony. Now, he wasn’t as religious as he once was, but as the waiting period hit the five-hour mark, Steve was starting to consider praying when the back doors flew open and various doctors streamed out, causing all three of them to fly up out of their seats.
PJ gave him a suspicious look, but he obeyed, leaving Tony’s lap to crawl into Steve’s arms. Relieved of the pressure, Tony opened his mouth to let out a silent scream, turning his chair back around so the others couldn’t see how pained he actually was.
He grunted as he grabbed a clean towel, wrapping PJ up tightly to help with his shivers.
“Noise,” the tiny voice grumbled.
Tony raised an eyebrow at Bruce, who clearly looked annoyed.
Tony sighed loudly, but Steve already had his baby blues ready, poking out his bottom lip as he fluttered his eyelashes. He watched Tony cave, making a tiny smirk curl up his lips when he sighed again.
“What the actual fuck?” Bucky exclaimed, leaping off the couch to run over to Tony, “Are you okay? Lemme see—oh jeez, Tony, at least it didn’t get your eye, but that’s gonna be red—”
Tears clouded his eyes, so he reached up to rub them away. It was not fair to not be able to share this precious thing with his Alpha-- something else Howard took from him. Responsibility for the baby came first, and he knew it would be foolish to have another target that could be exploited. They already had to worry about Peter; he was not sure that Steve could survive having two children be put in danger, and he told him as such.
“Uh…you’ve done a good job with him?”
“No? No sad?” Steve answered with a wet laugh, delicately putting a hand on the boy’s back, “Okay. No sad for Papa.”
Before Steve could complete the kiss, PJ shuddered in Tony’s arms, promptly leaning up to throw up over Tony’s shoulder, the back of his hoodie, and onto the floor. There was a pause and Steve promptly burst into laughter again, clutching at his chest and throwing his head back as he cackled. Tony scrunched his eyes shut, feeling the liquid start to seep into his clothes with a heavy sigh.
“Nat might let you on the cheerleading team?” Tony suggested, grinning when Steve pulled back to glare at him, “You think I’m kidding? You could do it. Just need to get you a brace, y’know?”
, m’so close,” He begged.
PJ gave Steve a suspicious look, but chose to drink from his cup and lean back against Steve’s chest. Tony watched them with his jaw unhinged, shaking his head when Steve raised an eyebrow.
“I can’t wait to get home?”
“I know that an apology won’t cover the shit that’s happened to you in the last year, but I’m sorry. And I also know that’s not good enough, and never will be good enough. I’m sorry that I let you down, as both a person and my best friend. I should have—it doesn’t matter what I should’ve done, I guess. I didn’t do it, and you got hurt again, and I told you I’d never let that happen again. I fucked up, Tony.”
Watching the other three go, Tony turned around to face the Widow, nodding toward the coffee pot. She took the hint and poured herself a cup, only to take a flask out from between her breasts and pour half of it into the cup.
“PJ’s alright. He had a fit since Steve pawned him onto me while
Rhodey put a hand up to placate him, shifting uncomfortably before speaking again.
, Tony thought, a tiny smile tugging on his lips.
Tony’s first recovery had been a walk in the park compared to this.
Bruce whined and Tony laughed more, only to quiet down when Peter began to whimper. He shushed the babe and moved him up to his chest, gently leaning their heads together as he rubbed Pete’s back.
“He’s trying to ask you if you’re coming home to me,” Tony said, “I’ve been assigned a color, due to it being emanating from my chest.”
Relax
Tony leaned forward as he watched Steve bustle about, subconsciously focusing on the other’s broad shoulders and the muscles moving under the thin tank top. He nearly got lost in thought before two hands were tugging on his pant leg, dragging him back to reality. Looking down, he smiled at PJ, sitting back in his chair.
. Barton? Let’s move.”
. He hates that I make fun of him for it.”
“Holy. Shit.”
“Finish that sentence very carefully.”
He shook PJ’s shoulder lightly, but at the motion, he jerked away from Tony’s hold, thrashing in his sleep as the nightmare held onto him. Just as suddenly, he sat straight up and screamed; Tony had to throw an arm over Steve’s chest to keep the blond from surging forward. In front of them, PJ panted for a moment before bursting into tears, wailing as he drew his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around himself.
Babbling on with his soothing phrases, Tony made his way over to PJ’s dresser, carefully opening one of the drawers to pull out a new Avengers’ diaper. Realizing what Tony was doing, Steve became more perplexed, standing awkwardly in the middle of the room.
He sniffled and smiled wide, uncaring that Tony’s jaw dropped as he stared.
So, he closed his eyes, and fell asleep.
So, when pterodactyls attacked the quinjet and downed them in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by dinosaurs and other hazards, the thought occurred to Tony that he’d never packed food and water, considering it was supposed to be a one-day outing.
Tony snapped his head up and growled back, baring his teeth as he stepped into Steve’s space to let the Alpha know who
“Tony? Did I upset ya?”
“You just suck up to her and bat your doe eyes at her, you gremlin, you can’t fool me,” Steve tried to scold, giggling back.
Of course, Steve pushed the plate back and talked, motioning to Peter and then to Tony. Seeing that he was not understanding, Tony frowned, trying to think up a way to communicate. After a moment, he picked up one of the pieces of meat, holding it out to Steve. The Alpha looked at the offering and then at Tony, and after Tony opened his mouth a little, Steve got the hint and carefully wrapped his lips around Tony’s fingers, pulling back to chew and swallow.
“You know I do not enjoy doing that. At all. People are not killed on these grounds, if I can help it,” Steve said, “I swear, whatever you have heard about me and my family is not true. We fight to stay free, but nothing more than that. Not ever. I would not allow it.”
Tony smiled and nodded, shifting a bit awkwardly under the weight of the compliment. He found it hard to look at his reflection these days; the glow of their shared eyes had dimmed for his mother in the past years as Howard’s true nature revealed itself. Thinking of his wilting mother being left with him brought tears to Tony’s eyes and he ducked his head, only to feel a weight settle on his crown. Confused, he looked back up, eyes crossed to try and see what had been placed on his head.
One of the most difficult aspects of the 21st century that he had to get used to was probably the showers.
is luxury,” Sam sighed, leaning back and closing his eyes, “We don’t even have to watch a movie. I’m cool with just laying here.”
In the faint glow of candlelight, the young Omega prince hurriedly packed his knapsack with shaking hands, double and triple-checking it to confirm that he had remembered all the necessities for the long trip ahead. He cinched the bag shut and tied a rolled-up winter blanket on top, then donned it and a wineskin full of goat’s milk. Sweat had accumulated on his palms so he wiped them off on his pants, clenching and unclenching the fabric in an effort to still his nerves. With one final glance around the room, he grabbed his family crest and slipped it over his neck, tucking the expensively jeweled pendant under his shirt to hide it. Silent, he blew out the candle and headed for the window, expertly climbing out and closing it behind himself before beginning the three-story descent to the ground. The height of the castle was making him more nauseous than he already was, and the cool wind blowing on his face did nothing to alleviate his fear. Rather, sweat had slicked up his palms once more, and in the effort to scale down quickly, he slipped twice, seizing his heart and bringing up bile to his throat.
He could not help but smile at Steve’s beaming grin, picking up another piece of meat to feed him. Together, they went through the rest of the plate, leaving Tony feeling warm and dizzy from Steve’s tongue gently cleaning his fingers. The moment was broken by Peter whimpering on his shoulder, using his little feet to kick at Tony’s stomach to convey his displeasure. Tony laughed softly and carefully moved the baby back down to nestle in his arms, brushing his nose over Peter’s face to try and calm him down.
“Alright, you’re going to make me cry, I’m turning around now,” he said, making Steve laugh and return to the story:
“Right,” Tony bit out, still clawing at the guard’s arm around his neck, “That
Steve’s eyes widened and filled with tears as Thor translated; he began to openly cry and nodded, clutching at Tony’s bare legs as he buried his face in his inner knee. Tony shook his head fondly and sunk his hand into Steve’s braid, tugging strands of hair loose.
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony croaked, a tear of his own falling down his cheek.
“Great,” Steve sighed, not offering anything else.
“You should play with dinosaurs with me sometime,” He said, scooting his chair over so he was pressed up against Tony’s side, “Building with Tasha an’ Clint is fun, but I’m funner.”

, and you had no one, no one was there for you, you had to write a
“Tony?”
“So it was Howard’s men?” He finally asked, “They were looking for me?”
He folded it into quarters and wrote ‘Natasha’ on it, then flicked it over to Bruce’s desk when Coulson’s back was turned. Bruce glanced at it, and slowly, the note got passed over without getting noticed. Natasha opened the slip, looked over at Tony and nodded, a frown twitching her lips. He merely shrugged and returned to his sketch, detailing what he wanted the brace to look like. Now, he wasn’t skilled in any sort of chiropracticy, but Howard sometimes wore a brace when he worked too long in the lab, so he figured he could nab it when he was passed out drunk and use it as a base model. Plus, he’d already hacked into the Library of Congress earlier that year, so he could look up medical reference books, if need be.
. In his pajamas.”
Hearing Steve shift, Tony blanched, recovering quickly as he shook his head.
“Try to relax,” he said quietly.
what the Alpha was attempting to do. He tried to complain, but a sharp pain on his left nipple snapped him out of it and caused him to yelp, then sigh as his aching chest began to lessen in pain. Steve’s innocent smile melted into a knowing look, which Tony was

“I’ll break the news since I need to call Pep about a few things anyway,” Rhodey said, standing and brushing off his uniform, “Once you’re stateside, she’ll hopefully have some projections. You know this won’t end well company-wise, right?”
“Oh, Tony…”
turn on my knees, and I plan on bedding him someplace where I can chain him up so he cannot turn it back onto me.”
“What the hell are you doing?” Steve asked, not at all apologetic that Tony was startled, yelping as he dropped his screwdriver on his foot.
your best friend! Not him!” Bucky growled, trying to reach over Steve’s shoulders to get at Tony, “He’s a little—”
PJ whimpered at his tone, causing Tony to turn back, concerned.
Tony nearly spit out his coffee, leveling Clint with a glare.
He hurried to put on his nursing bra and a new shirt, scooping Peter back into his arms as soon as possible to comfort the clearly hurting babe. It took a second to wrestle with his clothes to get them into position, as he was still getting used to nursing. Once Peter finally latched again, Tony sat on the bed with a deep sigh, already exhausted just from getting ready for the day. He wanted to lay back down and rest, but the bathroom door creaked and caused him to immediately sit up straight, adrenaline shooting through him. Technically, he knew Steve was not angry with him, but old habits die hard and he curled his arms around Peter a little tighter. He dared not turn around and waited for Steve to approach, relaxing when he saw his smile.
Thor looked bewildered but he relayed the information, at which the Prime sat up straight, narrowing his eyes at Tony. He snapped out a sentence, clearly angered by the admittance.
Steve finally looked at him then, hurt and pain flashing in his eyes.
Bruce nodded and headed on down the corridor while Tony went back into the bedroom, smiling fondly once he saw Steve curled up in the nest of pillows.
“-ny! Tony!”
Steve spent the rest of the day finishing the report for SHIELD and training in the gym. He hadn’t heard anything from SHIELD or seen anything on the news, but they were the best at keeping things under wraps. Steve wasn’t even sure there would be a SHIELD after the weekend was over, but he’d know more when he heard back from Fury.
Steve didn’t know how Tony could look back at all his past accomplishments and everything he’d done for the Avengers and not realize how much they needed him. He’d just have to keep reminding Tony.
“Nat, the more time I have to convince Tony that we’re better together, the less likely that anything will be able to break us apart,” Steve said, earnestly. “Tony’s already self-conscious enough as it is about all of this. He’s reluctant to let himself have something good, afraid he’ll mess it up somehow and drive me away.” Nat didn’t react, but Steve could see it was a reflection of some of her own thoughts.
“Have either of you seen Tony?” Steve asked.
“That’s...good,” Bruce said, suspiciously. Steve could feel Tony’s smirk. “Are you guys...oka-”
The nurse at the counter recognized who Steve was, and simply said, “Room 708,” letting him stride through the door leading to the hallway he wanted without another comment.  Steve was pretty sure he’d said thank you...but he didn’t really have time to dwell on it.
Kray and his men had stormed out afterward, with one last warning to Tony that speculated as to whether Steve’s serum ‘would save him from a bullet between the eyes.’
The man smirked, “No, I’m not.”
Once they’d done all they could at SHIELD and retrieved Bruce, the Avengers reunited officially on the quinjet. There was a lot of hugging and suppressed tears, but it already felt like the way it should be. None of the team had asked Tony or Steve what had happened in the nine days that they were prisoners. And he knew they wouldn’t push either of them to talk if they didn’t want to.
If Tony was up this early, it likely meant he had never gone to sleep in the first place.  Staying up all night working on new tech was hardly a strange occurrence for Tony, at least from what Steve had observed since the team had moved into the tower.
Steve pondered what Tony had said moments ago, and wondered if he should say the words that were on the tip of his tongue. He thought it would come out sooner or later, so now was as good a time as any. “You’re my first, you know.” Tony’s eyes snapped to his, but they weren’t judging him, only considering. “I mean, I’d never...had sex with anyone else before,” Steve finished.
Steve glanced up at Tony across the island, who was already looking at him. Steve shared a small, encouraging smile with him.
“Yeah, well,” Steve sat up a little in his chair, scooting closer toward Tony and grabbing his hand.
Steve considered him for a moment. He had an accent, but Steve couldn’t detect what. Maybe that was the point. He was a big guy, but not as big as Steve. His nose was crooked, like he’d broken it many times and never had surgery- a guy who wanted to look tough, then. None of the men wore armor or covered their faces, so they must’ve been confident that either Steve and Tony weren’t getting out alive to identify them or a record of them didn’t exist for detection.
“I wasn’t driving one of my cars.  I mean...” Tony faltered.  “It is mine, technically.  It’s just...”
"You, Tony, are incapable of sitting on the sidelines. No matter how many mistakes you think you've made, you keep fighting because you can't stand the idea of watching the world lose when you could've done something to help. I know you, Tony Stark. And you might've even gone through with whatever plan you have, and resigned as an Avenger for a month or a year. Who knows? But as soon as anything happened to Natasha or to Bruce or to me or to any of us, yourself would be the first person you would blame, no matter how illogical."
Steve was finishing up the steaks when he heard the elevator doors slide open. He checked the time on the stove- 7:01 pm. He smiled and wiped his hands off, turning in time to see Tony round the corner.
--------------------------------------------
Steve sighed, resignedly. “This isn’t your fault, Tony, but I trust you.”
“You mean morning? Yeah, it’s that time,” Steve said, and Tony smiled. He held out the cup of coffee and Tony grabbed it without even taking his eyes off the screen.
“Uh, yeah,” Steve guessed now was as good a time as any. “Nat, I actually wanted to tell you- well, we’ve just told Bruce, and you’re welcome to tell Clint- Tony and I have decided to...”
“And this isn’t your fault, by the way,” Steve said. “Since I know that’s what you’re thinking.” This did get a reaction out of Tony.
Steve felt a jolt in the pit of his stomach.  He knew Tony hadn’t been getting much sleep, a more obvious fact since they’d started sleeping in the same bed years ago.  But it had never affected Tony this way during the day.  Steve remembered when it had been an issue at the beginning of their relationship, how he’d had to trick Tony into sleep in any way he could think up.  It had slowly stopped being a problem over the years, and Steve had almost forgotten about it.  But Tony had begun staying up late hours in the past couple weeks, with seemingly no explanation.  Steve felt a little ashamed that he hadn’t thought to really confront Tony about it.  He needed to work harder to force Tony to rest.  But it still didn’t make sense.
Tony blew out a breath and collapsed onto a nearby stool, running his hands down his face. There was a reason he wasn’t sleeping, but it was easier to drown himself in work and suit upgrades than it was to address the real problem. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw that giant wormhole into space, felt it closing around him, watched as aliens- aliens- invaded New York. It was so beyond everything he’d understood about the world, and he felt like it was only just catching up with him.
“I’m beginning to think I have my hands full with you,” Tony teased, and backed it up by grabbing a handful of Steve’s ass. Steve bucked toward Tony, but tapped him on the back in pretend protest. Tony leaned forward and kissed Steve gently, contrasting the previous mood with soft lips.
Tony’s eyes were full of desperation, but Steve’s gaze made him nod in grudging understanding.
Bruce nodded. “Sure, Tony. I’ll take a look. Thought the lab was in bad shape, though.”
“Couldn’t make you too comfortable or you wouldn’t have any motivation to get the job done. Speaking of which,” at that, the boss did look over at Steve. Steve sneered back at him, but the boss only smiled again. He didn’t have to say anything for Tony to get the idea.
“Well, I’ve got some work in the lab,” Tony said when he’d finished his coffee. “Later, Bruce, Steve...” Tony brushed his hand across Steve’s shoulders as he walked past him toward the elevator. “I’ll be downstairs if you need me.”
They wanted Tony to build some type of large-scale sonic taser that would incapacitate anyone within a 5-mile radius. Apparently, it was based off of a design that Stark Industries had never approved for mass production many years ago. It had clearly affected Tony when Kray had told him, so Steve guessed he had some sort of history with the device.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve forced the words out. “You don’t have to...justify yourself to me.” He knew a rejection when he heard one.
Steve sat there for a beat, waiting for Tony to say anything else, but he was done. Steve’s blood was boiling.
Tony eventually had to pull away to breathe, but he didn’t let that stop him from rucking up Steve’s shirt and sliding his hand underneath. Steve inhaled sharply at the feeling of Tony’s nails scraping down his back. He ducked down to graze first his lips along Tony’s neck and then his teeth, which received a moan from Tony that Steve couldn’t help himself from echoing. The sound caused both of their hips to stutter toward each other, and Steve bit his lip on a gasp.
Fury didn’t respond right away, but eventually he nodded. “I can respect that, Captain.”
Steve watched him go, wondering how he could even find Tony’s walk attractive. He glanced at Bruce when Tony had disappeared around the corner. He probably would’ve kissed Tony if Bruce hadn’t been here. Part of him wanted to be able to do those things in front of the team, but he also wanted to keep certain things private. Maybe over time, Steve wouldn’t have to overthink everything so much. He would just do what came naturally.
“Alright, Tony,” Steve said gently. He looked at Steve in surprise, and Steve nodded. “I understand.”
--------------------------------------------
He couldn’t really comprehend how big the news of Iron Man and Captain America dating would be to the world. It was so much bigger than just him and Steve, even if Tony wished it wasn’t. They were just two men, after all. But that’s not what it would be for a lot of people. For some, it would be news that would give them hope, maybe even save their life. But for some, it would be unthinkable, disgusting, wrong. Tony was afraid the public reaction might even ruin him and Steve if they let it.
“Together?” Steve finished for him. “Yeah, I’d- I’d say so.” Steve smiled at Tony, and tried not to ogle too much at his forearms in front of Bruce.
When the time did come, Steve was way past ready to get out of his small cell. It started like every other morning, except that after a few hours of Tony’s absence, an alarm rang out throughout the facility and Steve could’ve sworn the walls were shaking slightly. He could also swear there was gunfire.
“‘Charged atoms,’ four across?” Steve asked.
“I haven’t told him that yet,” Steve admitted. It had felt good to say out loud, but it would feel even better to tell Tony.
“...But I ask that you respect me the same way, and trust that I know what it means to feel...attracted to you...to want to touch you all the time,” Steve moved closer to Tony, his eyes catching on Tony’s throat as he swallowed. “To be aware of you constantly, and crave your voice and your smell.”
Tony let Steve continue to explore his ‘handsome but few’ wrinkles, amused. “Steve Rogers, do you have an age kink? I think I’m scandalised. But also, not complaining.”
“Sir, may I suggest you conduct this test flight tomorrow.”
“Uh, good,” Steve said. “Really good.” He couldn’t help the way his eyes strayed to Tony, before averting back down to the newspaper.
“But I want to,” Steve insisted, making Tony sigh. “You listed all those things about yourself like they should scare me away, but you do realize that I deal with those parts of you already just being your friend, right?” Tony kind of scowled at him, but Steve could tell he wanted to smile. “And there’s no need to get a ‘complex about your age.’ Technically, I’m ninety-four years old.”
“I don’t really know.  I thought I’d gotten over all of this.  I mean, this guy just won’t go away,” Tony let out a humorless laugh, shaking his head.
Tony returned the smile, but it quickly faded as he seemed to make up his mind about something. “I’ve never-” Tony cut himself off, but when he looked at Steve again, his eyes were determined. “I’ve never told anyone about Afghanistan.”
He followed Tony through several doorways that seemed like they would usually be locked, especially with the alarm that likely signalled a security breach. When Steve gave Tony a look, Tony shrugged. “I might’ve installed a virus in the security system. Just to make things a little easier.”
“I like it,” Steve said, after he’d swallowed his bite. The wind was gently ruffling his hair, still wet from the quick shower he’d had after his run. “Much warmer here than in DC. Or New York, for that matter.”
Steve adjusted slightly so his face wasn’t quite so smushed into the pillow, and he could respond to Tony. “Hm? ‘This’?”
It felt better to actually be touching him, and Tony gladly curled his hand around Steve’s.
“What?  What aren’t you telling me?”  Steve squeezed Tony’s hand in reassurance.
Steve laughed and curled up in his chair as best as he could, cradling his headset between his hands.
want to have a conversation about his pain, but he knew they needed to talk about it, even if Steve tried to force him to have an examination. Embarrassment flared in his face at the thought, so Tony ducked his head and forced himself to think on other things, like how he was going to explain his bond to Rhodey.
“And yet you decided to act upon that feeling anyway?”
is a perfluorocarbon liquid. But, he does have a mask on, so maybe that can pump the liquid from his lungs, or it’s prevented liquid from getting in there in the first place.”
“...No…” Steve admitted with a grumble.
Tony laughed at that, only to groan at the pain in his neck. He looked up at PJ, the boy’s worry showing in the scrunch of his brows.
Bruce laughed at that, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
“Mm.”
“You still hold that against him?” He asked carefully.
Thankfully, PJ’s arms and legs looked fairly normal: no signs of old or new breaks, but perhaps the bones were a bit on the thin side. However, when focusing on the boy’s ribcage, Tony felt each old break in his own chest.
“Team building exercise, courtesy of Nick Fury,” Natasha answered, shaking the hat between her hands as she gave Tony a look, “You can blame Clint for picking what it is.”
“Are you alright, my love? You smell scared again,” Steve said softly, reaching up to cup Tony’s face, “Did… did I do something wrong?”
“Steve, you had scoliosis and partial deafness from that time you got fucking scarlet fever. Then, magically, you grow over a foot and have no health problems? On top of it, you never let Tony attend any of your camp graduations or see your stripes. You should have seen his face when he realized he had actually managed to hack into the
“Tony, be nice. At least it isn’t Rum Raisin.”
“This doesn’t count as working?” Steve commented smugly, unable to hide his smirk when Tony turned to pout at him.
Tony sighed deeply, sinking back into the couch with a pout. It wasn’t that he hated team building exercises, but he
“You’re okay, you’re okay, the chair’s just going backward. You won’t fall,” Tony quickly soothed, “The chair just lets you lay down instead of sit. I thought we could lay down while we read, yeah? In case you get tired and want to take a nap.”
“That sounds like trauma, Tony,” Bruce said carefully, “I am sure it was very stressful to experience, but also, I would guess that the Prime did not mean to purposefully set it into motion. It sounds like he was worried someone had come along and taken you, as—”
“We knew he’d gone missing about three months ago when he had traveled to the area to show off one of his newest missile designs. We got the ransom video not long after,” Rhodey explained, pulling away from Steve to wipe at his face, “I did everything I could, pulled all my strings—Pepper’s been manning the fort, trying to keep the company afloat while we looked for him. We didn’t have anything to go on and had nearly given up when we got a call from SHIELD asking for me to ride on an evac mission. I knew as soon as I stepped on this rig that I was going to get Tony, either dead or alive.”
With a happy hum, he laid back down with the elephant, picking at its fur as he drifted off back to sleep. Once he was sure PJ was out again, Tony sighed, his shoulders drooping.
“Let him do it. He needs it,” Rhodey murmured.
Steve’s concerned face looked quite sickly in the light of a single candle, so Tony carefully placed a hand on the side of his neck. He stroked his thumb across Steve’s jawline and frowned at the Prime’s lack of response.
“I’ll go get you food and a drink, and send it in with Steve and the kid. Which, by the way, you still need to explain his existence to me. I wasn’t exactly expecting to wake up the other day with a godson,” Rhodey grunted, flicking Tony’s ear, “Not only that, but I heard it through
“I’m here, I’m here! Thor can you—oh. Uh—Clint, go get me a piece of the quinjet wing. Something flat to put over the fire.”
Exiting the bathroom in a cloud of steam, he found Steve sitting on the edge of his bed, changed out of his day clothes into what looked like comfortable lounge pants and a tank top. Tony had to pause for a moment, inwardly chastising himself for being so thirsty over Steve’s arms.
“Alright, husbands,” the redhead in question called, clapping her hands together, “The question I asked your wives was, what is your spouse’s most irritating habit? Clint, we’ll start with you.”
“You still do, sometimes. It’s cute to see Tony pout at clearly being Mom and then relax when he sees how proud Steve looks,” Rhodey laughed.
“Promise,” Steve whispered back.
Pulling his phone from his pocket, Tony opened the camera application and turned it to the front camera, holding it in front of PJ. Slowly, the boy peeked out of the shirt and at the phone, gasping softly. He rubbed his eyes, blinking at the phone before leaning in more, examining each of his eyes with vigor.
“My fault,” Steve said quietly, bringing his arms up to wrap around Tony, “Had a nightmare. Think I scared him.”
“Poor thing’s exhausted,” Tony murmured, standing in the doorway, “I wish we could just
“You scent of distress,” Bruce said quietly, “Are you alright?”
He scooped the baby up and glared at Steve again, keeping his chin up as he walked past the Alpha. It was slightly difficult to ignore Steve’s increasing growls of annoyance behind him, but Tony continued to walk, taking them to the throne room where some of the other Warlords had gathered for their meeting with the Prime. They barely registered Tony entering the room, but Steve’s pungent scent had them all turning in surprise. Tony made eye contact with Sam and gave him a slight nod of acknowledgment, then proceeded to sit himself down on Steve’s throne with Peter cradled in his lap.
“We have already been through a lot,” Tony said, smiling down at Pete despite the baby’s continued cries, “I think without his mother here he has imprinted onto me.”
“Alright, last one before we call your husbands back in. What would your spouse request as a last meal? James?”
Tony felt like crying at that. He threw himself over into Rhodey’s arms and clawed at his back, sinking into his best friend’s warm hug.
“You really shouldn’t.”
“I brought you something else, too,” Steve interrupted softly, a small smile on his face, “I thought you might like one. I had one when I was around your age, so—”
He slipped his hands up Tony’s thighs and lightly pushed them farther apart.
“Okay, so this is a washcloth,” he explained, showing the small rag to the boy, “I’m going to put it in the water and get it soapy, then clean you off. You might get a little cold, but it’ll go away once we’re done. Alright?”
“Peter—ah, PJ, seems to be in better health than what’s described in his file,” She began, flicking through her own pages on a clipboard, “Albeit, he’s extremely malnourished and underweight for his age, but he’s been responsive and open to you. We believe that he may have passed out because, for one, he’s very weak and should not be doing any sort of strenuous activity, and two, his mind may have recognized that he’s in a safe place and allowed his body to go into a sort of mini coma to allow him to heal. For whatever blessed reason, he either trusts you or recognizes that he can trust you. It’s a very good first step.”
Finding an empty bench near a streetlight in view of the Tower, Tony sat with the boy, cradling him close. With a raw ache of what could only be described as paternal protectiveness in his chest, Tony pressed his lips to PJ’s forehead, letting his eyes close as he rocked them.
“I honestly expected to have to convince you,” Natasha murmured, “You’re a better man than you think, Tony.”
“Buck?” he croaked, relaxing once he realized who it was, “Wha—What?”
“Don’t give him the satisfaction of calling him that.”
, he thought to himself,
Steve hummed and beckoned him over, ducking into his closet to pull out a large wooden trunk. He propped open the lid and dug around before coming up with an armful of items. First, he settled a pair of leather moccasins by Tony’s feet, and upon deciding that they would fit, helped Tony slide into them and tied them around his ankles.
particular statement.”
The Warlord removed his hand and tilted his head, turning to the people behind him to speak to them in what Tony assumed was the Warlord language. After a second, he turned back, motioning to Tony with his hand.
Tony looked over his shoulder to raise an eyebrow at the annoyed Alpha.
“Love, please eat,” Tony almost begged, “You will feel much better and then we can sleep the day away, I just need you to drink, yeah? Usually, you do not fuss so much—perhaps you are ill too? Maybe Banner was—”
“There’s a temperature flux in the far wall,” he noted, going over to feel on the concrete, “And since they’re really cliché villains—”
If Steve had any complaints, he did not voice them; instead, he grabbed their cloaks from the closet and upon noticing the dreaded garment that Tony had purposefully left, picked it up and held it out to him.
From behind Steve, Thor spoke, having been hovering over them the entire time. Steve turned and nodded, motioning back to Tony to move with him toward the head of the table. He pulled out the large chair and sat, only to grab onto Tony and pull him down onto his lap. Tony squeaked and glared at him, but Steve merely smiled and pulled a plate of food on the table closer to them. He picked up a piece of fruit and offered it up, apparently not concerned about the group of people staring at them.
“Can I go in? I do not think he would hurt me, and he definitely would not hurt Peter…. plus, the babe has not let out a peep since we have been down here. He is good about knowing when there is danger.”
Blinking through his haze, Tony leaned over to look over the edge, seeing Clint and Bucky on the ground, the former waving what looked like a frisbee at him.
“Right. Sorry. C’mon, kiddo.”
Steve stared at the bullets, blinking through the hot water before sighing loudly, thunking his head against the wall and dropping the bullets into the pile. He rinsed the conditioner out of his hair and quickly soaped himself up, glad to be rid of the grime of the battle. Once he was cleaned off and his bruising had been checked out, Steve shut the water off and grabbed one of the towels to wrap around his waist, scooping up the bullets to dump into the trash. He returned to the main area to find that they were already in the air, with everyone in various states of pain or disarray.
“Once its cool, you can try some, okay kiddo?” he said, starting to clean up the mess.
“You’re okay,
‘Tony!’ me,” he said, grabbing a cloth to dry off with, “I am
“There is cake and other goodies in the kitchen. Tony, why don’t you show them where it is?” Mother said overtop of the arguing, taking her knitting back up, “Your Father should be home soon. If he’s in a good mood, he might let you all look into the lab.”
“He had us
“Okay, sweetheart,” Tony mumbled as he pushed his shirt up and turned slightly onto his side, “Have as much as you want, baby. I think we are going to stay here for a while this morning.”
Perking up at his name, Tony trotted to the front of the class with his backpack on his small shoulders, smiling up at his Mother as she held out her hand for him to take.
“Pinky?”
, you gotta breathe, sweetie. I don’t want you to end up in one of these beds too.”
“Right. We need to be diligent. I’m going to upload FRIDAY and JOCASTA into the mainframe to add another two layers of security, just in case,” Tony said, nodding, “I’ll have Pepper run more thorough background checks and have my current employees go through re-checks.”
“Before that.”
That.
He fisted his hands into Steve’s shirt to yank him down to his height, feverishly kissing him over and over again, unable to help the happy purr in his throat once Steve relaxed into it. There was a laugh, so Tony grunted, gently nipping Steve’s bottom lip and swiping his tongue over the point to ease the pain.
“I’m calling Maria,” Sarah’s voice butted in, and a warm hand took his own, “Steve and I will come to the hospital with you, okay, love? Don’t worry, everything will be okay, I promise.”
Counting the seconds, Tony tried to ignore the pounding in his head as he regulated his breathing, all too aware of how close he was to hyperventilating. The anxiety from the past twenty-four hours was starting to catch up to him, tightening his heart and shortening his already quick breaths. He sunk his hands into his own hair, scraping blunt nails against his scalp as he fisted his hair in both hands, distantly aware that he was starting to rock back and forth.
He nibbled on his bottom lip, then shook his head, looking back up at Tony.
Watching Steve interact with PJ, Tony felt a warmth blossom through his chest, reaching so that the tips of his fingers tingled with electricity. The fire behind the ice blue stare caught him off guard enough that it took a few snaps for Tony to realize that Steve was attempting to get his attention.
Tony froze, then nodded, forcing himself to remain calm.
Steve sighed and ran a hand through his hair, eventually offering the men a resigned smile.
“You two really need to communicate better,” Pepper hummed, picking up one of Tony’s hands to start massaging his palm, “Plus, I don’t think Steve would actually get up and leave if you made a simple joke. It’s probably more than that.”
“I heard Buck talk like that b’fore, behind doors I was not s’posed to be listening to,” he admitted, panting a little, “Did...did you like it? Was it okay? I never--you were my first, little rabbit. I want to make sure it was good for you.”
His voice broke and Natasha’s hand was in his hair again, giving him the strength to take a breath and collect himself. He stayed quiet as she worked, except for his sneezing when she liberally applied the setting powder.
“Do you want me to get him?”
Once he stopped talking, Bucky and Clint stared at him and then Tony, about to give out cheers at not finishing, when Steve held up his hand.
“Tony! What the hell are you doing up there!”
“M’comin’,” he tried to say, but his throat was swollen and rough, causing him to cough as he stumbled over to the crib.
smart mouth your teacher. Miss Hill is very nice,” she said with a smile, standing and carding her manicured fingers through his hair, “Bye, love.”
Thor stopped mid-sentence and stood once Steve approached the table, quickly switching into the Northern language. As he talked, his voice grew more hurried and frantic, as if he was not sure he had enough time to relay his message. Steve barely set their breakfast on the table before nodding and gesturing toward the door, following Thor as they talked amongst themselves. Within an instant, they were gone, leaving Tony and Peter alone in the dining hall. Tony sat there for a moment, blinking at the empty spot where Thor and Steve had just been.
it was that was in charge. The Prime Alpha may have superior leadership of the colony, but Tony was not going to allow him to attempt to force him into submission since his Omega biology reacted to an Alpha command. The crowd around them gasped at the defiance; at the noise, Steve suddenly seemed to remember himself. He turned red, crossed his arms and ducked his head, outwardly yielding to Tony’s display.
“And what about PJ?” Bucky asked, motioning with his head toward the child, “You already got grabbed once, just outside the Tower.”
“Shh, darling, we were not fighting over you, I promise,” he whispered, turning his back on the crowd in a last-ditch effort for privacy, “Do not be scared, my love. Daddy is here to protect you, even from the big scary Alphas. Shh,
“Yeah, fuck, Tony, s’good,” Steve pulled back to pant, ducking his face into Tony’s neck, “Tha’s so good honey, love y’hands, perfect, perfect hands—”
“I feel wonderful. Thank you,” he said, his voice slightly raspy from the screaming, “You… you need to teach me how to talk like that. I tried it before, but you sound so much better. I have never felt so hot before.”
“No, no, it is okay,” Tony said quickly as he reached up to pat Steve’s back in comfort, “That… That is good. I am just not used to seeing you so sweet with him, is all. You should hold him more often, you know. He likes to be held and kissed.”
“Yeah, yeah, I got it,” Bucky snorted, “Just hold on for a moment, Clint will go get the others and we will keep your pretty pants intact.”
“You scared me,” he said, fully aware he could not understand him.
“Yeah. I guess. We, ah, our conversation never—before you left,” Steve tried, fumbling for words, “When I made PJ upset on accident. We—I didn’t—”
Tony realized as she let go of him.
, but he shouldn’t be judging the flavors of the differently colored mold on his pizza.”
“There has been a battalion sighted on our southern border,” Thor explained after translating to Steve, “Almost a hundred men on horseback. It is nothing serious; we have attacks like this often. However, with your status, the Prime wants to go to the field. If the battalion is of Howard’s men, it would be wisest for him to be leading us in. The Prime’s presence tends to put fear into men.”
“Good job, buddy. You’re already ahead of the curve,” Tony praised, kneeling back down, “I have to touch again just to make sure you’re all cleaned up, okay? Then we have to wash hands and we’re done. Can you do that for me?”
. That’s cheating, you know. I can’t put up a fight when you act like a big soft teddy bear,” he grumbled back, cupping Steve’s chin to run his thumb over his lips, “It’s quite rude, you know.”
“Oh, way ahead of you, baby. Already have the matching Christmas stockings ordered.”
“Good job, kiddo,” Tony praised, ruffling PJ’s hair and making the boy giggle, “You’re getting the hang of it, yeah? Now let’s go make Papa his drink.”
eat it.”
“I’d hope not, Mr. Stark-Rogers,” she sniffled, moving out of the way to let the others in.
“Right,” Steve answered dryly.
He repeated himself to Steve, then bowed before leaving the two men. Steve turned to Tony and gestured toward the door, only to flinch as if he had remembered something. He quickly untied his cloak and tossed it onto his bed, then hefted a shield up onto his back from seemingly out of nowhere. Tony paled slightly, as horror stories of the Prime Alpha and his shield filtered into his head. Steve did not notice, or he did not let his acknowledgment show, for he merely took up his gesturing position again, waiting for Tony to walk out first.
“Good. Smart boy. He deserves an upgrade when we get back. Alright, keys.”
“What?” he choked.
He gave Tony a quirked smile, clasping his forearm and squeezing slightly.
“About as well as you’d expect.”
baby, his only son, not even weaned, and Steve wanted to kick him out? The thought brought tears to his eyes, and he must have started to sour, as Peter’s wails quieted to whimpers and Steve reeled back to cough.
“Thanks, Ava,” He said nervously, suddenly realizing that those who had not visited his house before were very quiet.
, never you, darling—”
“That’s why I’m here,” Bucky said through a mouthful of red jello, “It’s better than RTE’s.”
The thought of Steve tearing someone to shreds to protect his honor
“I don’t—I don’t want to be what we were, either,” he said, rubbing the rest of the tears off of his face, “If we’re getting it all out there. I don’t. Peggy—I realized—fuck, Tony. I was attracted to her because she was you with curves and when I realized she just wasn’t you I—”
Tony quickly clacked his mouth shut, standing up from the floor as embarrassment coiled in his gut. He turned to try and escape down to the lab since PJ was in semi-reliable hands, figuring he could work on new stretchable Kevlar for Bruce, and maybe start the updates that Pep had requested for the latest Starkpad—
Not wanting to accidentally wake Steve with his prodding, Tony opened his eyes and finished his bath, silently screaming in his head as he climbed out and slid his underwear back on. His limp would no doubt be noticeable, and
PJ peeked up from Tony’s shoulder to look at the book, a quizzical expression on his face. Eventually, he nodded, but once he saw the other Avengers watching, he ducked his head back into Tony’s neck. Wrapping his arm around the boy with the book in his hand, Tony turned, hyperaware of the eyes on him. Amidst them, he found Pepper’s gaze, a bit comforted by her encouraging grin.
“I won’t,” Clint moaned pitifully, at which Sam laughed and Bucky sympathetically patted his head.
resounded in the room, and the room burst into laughter, as a big spitball was now stuck on Fury’s face, in-between his brows. Clint reached his hand back under his desk so Tony fist-bumped him, hiding their smirks in their other hands.
“What? J? What does that mean?” He asked, more confused than he was at the beginning of the conversation, “J?”
Tony waved a hand in the direction of the gruff voice, trying his best to ward Steve off. He was fine, thank you very much, he could get up and take care of his baby all by himself. Slowly, he tried to get up again and promptly ignored the throbbing in his knees, his chest, and behind his eyes. He shuffled over to the crib one step at a time, making sure he was properly balanced before hefting Peter up.
PJ nodded absentmindedly, not even bothering to hide his staring at Pepper. She merely smiled back at him, happy to have his attention for a few moments.
The boy glanced at Tony and then back to the chair, idly picking at the soft leather. Tony merely watched, not wanting to push him, lest he have an episode. PJ spent a minute or two just touching and poking the chair before finally turning to Tony, eyeing him carefully. Slowly, he reached down, resting a finger on the edge of the arc reactor before looking up at Tony expectantly.
“--I am quite sensitive,” he finally squeaked out.
“I guess I have to tell Steve,” Tony finally said, feeling as though a gnarled hand had wrapped itself around his heart and squeezed.
, he groaned inwardly, deciding to plop them down on Steve’s bed.
Tony cursed under his breath and slammed on the accelerator, shifting into fourth then fifth gear as he sped along.
“Tony?”
PJ burrowed down into his blankets with his elephant, offering up a hint of a smile when Tony tucked the sheets down around him. Steve reentered the room, sidling up next to Tony to wrap an arm around his waist and kiss his forehead, smiling against it.
“Okay boys, give Mom and Dad their turn to answer,” Natasha interrupted, waving her face with her cards, “Steve, what’s your favorite ice cream flavor?”
“Tony, yes,” Steve murmured, immediately taking his hand into both of his own.
ago.”
“Tony? How are you feeling?” Rhodey asked as he coaxed up a small fire, “Are you hurting?”
Startled, Tony turned it over just to make sure nothing was on the back. It wasn’t their anniversary and no holidays were coming up…what was he up to? Concerned, he opened the folder: on the left were a few slips of drawing paper, and on the right, a composition notebook was tucked in the pocket with a sticky note of its own on it.
“Okay, Anthony, it’s time to go. Your Father and I have a gala to attend,” his Mother said gently, taking Tony’s hand to pull them apart, “Say goodbye to Steve.”
“Good morning, sweetheart,” he murmured, nosing at Tony’s hair, “Ready to face the day?”
“Rest?” Steve said.
He knew that Rhodey would give him shit later, but he ignored it in favor of scooping up Peter into his arms and kissing his head.
“Okay, so the first step to making hot cocoa is to check and make sure you have milk. Some people make it with water, but then its hot
“Anthony. You’re my
“Wow,” Steve said, blinking in shock, “That…was easy. How did you know to do that?”
“Shh, Tones, you can have all the hugs you want in a minute, okay?” Rhodey mumbled back, stroking a hand down his back, “Let me get—oh, jeez, the ginger took her heel off and has it against Steve’s neck, man. For real, who
“That’s it. I got you,” Tony soothed, ignoring every screaming instinct to scoop the boy up and hold him close, “You feeling better, huh? Maybe Natasha—”
, he thought as he helped gather kindling and twigs for Natasha.
“You could just ask, you know,” he said, picking up another piece of potato and holding it out to Steve.
Bruce’s lips turned up into a small smile as he nodded, knocking his head against Thor’s shoulder as a sign of thanks. With that, Natasha turned to Tony and Steve, having to clear her throat to wake up the former.
Unable to do much else, Tony let out a growl deep in his register, momentarily loosening all the Alphas around him. An Omega parent could easily render an Alpha stunned with a protective growl, so Tony used it to his advantage, ducking under the spears and dashing out from the circle, feet pounding on the grass to get to safety. He’d nearly made it into the forest on the other side of the clearing when a hand came down on his head and stopped him, easily picking him up completely off the ground and turning him around. Tony’s mouth fell open in awe and fear as he stared up at the blond giant in front of him, clad in leather armor and face paint.
Tony laughed and sighed warmly, turning to kiss the top of Peter’s head and rub the baby’s back. He whimpered and clutched at Tony’s shirt, tucking his head into his father’s neck.
Tony nodded, scooting over slightly so Steve could sit next to him and also lean up against the tree. Steve eagerly pulled out his own cheese sandwich and started to eat, talking excitedly about recess.
“Ah ba oo,” Peter answered in turn.
“So, where is this safe house?” Clint asked, sitting down in front of the fire.
“Be nice,” Steve scolded, “Maybe I said it was my favorite. I have it often enough that it could be….”
them. He’s just awkward. I’m more afraid of him not wanting to be a part of his life when
“Anything else happen? With Steve?” Bruce prompted, giving Tony a knowing look.
Steve smiled and nibbled on Tony’s bottom lip, teasing the edge of his pinky against Tony’s rim.
“Fine. But you’re still not allowed to say anything about it, understand?” he said seriously, pinching Steve’s nipple.
is my fucking
“Is he seriously doing that right now?” Rhodey grunted, earning another elbow to the gut, “What, are you buddy-buddy now?”
Steve accepted the knife and moved back into the shower area, closing the curtain before stripping off his nearly ruined suit and tossing it over top of the bar. He heard Sam grunt and swear, making him laugh as he turned the shower on.
. Your obsession with me caused you to lose your damn mind, almost kill my closest friend, and nearly take me on the floor of the dungeon. Then, when I
“Steve,” he tried to say, but his voice failed him.
Tony turned to look at Steve, who had finally picked up his head, staring off into the distance as he talked.
Tony grunted at the weight, but at least Steve was still conscious, which was better than some of his previous partners. He could feel their bond buzzing in his core, and when he mentally poked at it, he choked on the searing pleasure that roared into his body. Instinctively, he writhed and clenched down, his cock twitching in interest. He felt Steve’s cock pulse again inside of him, but Steve barely reacted as he was too busy catching his breath.
“Just waiting on you, Cap.”
Steve let his head flop back and he whined louder, causing Tony to giggle even more. Gods, it was like they were children sneaking into the house long after they were supposed to be asleep. How they made it to their room unseen was a miracle, and Tony wasted no time in using his momentary good fortune to push Steve into the bathroom.
the ones that cry a lot.”
Tony sighed and nodded, then grimaced at the lingering taste in his mouth. Sam motioned to Clint and caught a waterskin thrown at them, offering it to him for a drink. He eagerly swallowed down the water, mumbling a thank you when he handed it back.
“Banner is very unsure of accepting his green half. Which, of course, is understandable, but the constant whining instead of letting go and pummeling his enemies can become tiresome. Not to mention it can get us killed.”
“Okay, okay, yeah, someone’s hyperactive today,” he snorted, keeping a tight hold on the boy as he took him into the bathroom, “We gotta get you cleaned up and into some clothes, okay? Then we can go run around. Can you be still for me? Just for a bit?”
Tony happily skipped back to the changing room to strip, tossing his clothes on top of Steve’s neatly folded pile before shimmying into his suit. He’d gone with a wine-colored tux, accented in the buttons and peak lapels with black silk. Originally a modern fit, he’d asked it to be brought in as much as possible, to the point where the material hugged him like a plastic bag that had all the air sucked out of it. He looked
At Bruce’s unimpressed look, Tony merely sighed and rolled his eyes, standing anyway with PJ in his arms.
As a team, they spent hours together hashing and re-hashing out their plan of attack, balancing out variables and methods, attempting to decide what their best approach would be. However, since they did not have enough information about the actual complex yet to decide the initial infiltration, Tony called it a night, waving everyone away.
“You are not mad, are you?” He asked.
“Not okay,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s chest, “It sucks, it
“I believe I said I liked you in only your dog-tags.”
“Uh. Steve would want shepherd’s pie, but with colcannon instead of regular mashed potatoes on top,” he said, writing it down as he spoke, “He’d also want it with half lamb and half beef, and a Sam Adams. Preferably Octoberfest.”
“I only meant that he is of your flesh and blood and not of mine,” he explained, “You have a bond with him that I do not, and losing
“Jay said you, ah, decided that the water was a bit forceful, so you broke my house,” He continued, screwing the headpiece back on, “So I did some research, found an old forties showerhead, and refitted it with better metal so it can actually withstand full pressure in case you ever want to try it. Until then—”
Steve did as instructed, and slowly, PJ stood and crept back toward him, hesitating slightly before placing his small hand in the middle of Steve’s large palm. There were a few seconds before the boy finally relaxed, returning to being distracted by the room around him while keeping his hand in Steve’s own.
“Thank you,” Tony said meekly, avoiding eye contact while Steve went to wash his hands.
“Ah! I see you have met Lieutenant Barnes.”
“What if I promise to give it over
try to let you near me again, you pout like a child and refuse to let me take care of you.”
“Thank you,” Tony murmured, wrapping an arm around her back as he rested his head on top of her own, “I considered asking Sam, but I don’t want the kid coming back asking to fly every ten seconds. I’d rather he know how to kill a man with his thumbnail.”
Before he could finish the suggestion, Steve had unbuckled him and tugged him into his arms, holding Tony up by his thighs as he stumbled them both into the elevator. They both had a thought about the potential repercussions about getting down and dirty right away, but addiction has a habit of pushing away rational thought, which meant that Tony was too busy sucking on Steve’s tongue for him to hold back. The elevator took too damn long to get up to the penthouse, but eventually the doors opened, and they managed to force themselves out, both already untucked from their pants to provide a little relief.
“I’m—I’m not really sure—”
He did not know why, but the Alpha’s correction had him seeing red. Bucky was yelling for a clean fight again somewhere in the background, but all he cared about was wiping the seemingly smug look off of the Warlord’s face. He would have been able to, had Steve been anyone else. As it were, Steve had incredible reflexes, allowing him to catch Tony’s heated punches in both hands. He took them down to the ground and straddled Tony across his chest, then pinned him to the floor by his wrists.
“Taking Matters into His Own Hands. 1987. He’d have been…seventeen. MIT,” Steve said to himself, wincing when he had to peel the pages apart, “I wonder if James knows about these…”
“My apologies. I did not mean to scare either of you—you both left in a hurry. Is everything alright?” Thor asked in both languages.
“Rightfully so,” He said, grinning when Steve purposefully sat down in the chair next to his bed.
,” Tony cried, “And, and Mary--”
Tony swore again and dropped the soap into the water, freezing when the Prime quietly reached in to retrieve it, then handed it back to him. Stunned, he watched the man for a second and noticed the tension in his shoulders as he knelt next to the tub. He quickly realized that the Prime was just as awkward about the situation as he was.
“Yes, darling, I am right here. You are drunk on an unbonded Omega’s pheromones, sweetheart,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hand to squeeze, “It will take a bit for the Alpha reaction to leave your system--let us get that sponge bath done, yes? Then you can see Peter and Bruce, I promise.”
“Hey, it’s okay, I know you’re really scared,” He murmured, sitting down fully to stretch out his legs, “It’s okay to cry. No one’s going to hurt you. Not ever again. I promise. I’ll do my best to protect you, even if you don’t really get what that means right now. I’m not really sure what I’m doing, so… I guess we’ll figure this out.”
“What about men in leather with swords?” Thor translated.
“You are adorable, my love,” Tony murmured, tickling the bottom of Peter’s feet, “We need to thank whoever donated these clothes for you, yeah? You are so cute.”
“Hey,” Steve murmured, kissing Tony’s cheek and jaw, “I missed you. Wish you’d stayed with me.”
“Papa?” he asked, his eyes already starting to fill with tears.
,” Tony groaned when Steve placed the plate in front of him.
“He does not appreciate that we are talking in front of him without my translations,” Thor explained, grinning while Steve pouted.
The elevator began to move, leaving Tony with his thoughts: earlier, the team had agreed that the best plan forward would be to divide the team into two groups. One would stay at home with Tony as a protectorate for PJ and JARVIS, and the other would infiltrate the Sahara base. The problem was no one could decide who was best suited for each task, as there was no good information about the Sahara base.
“Oh, honey, no,” Tony sighed softly, inwardly wondering why he hadn’t punched Steve yet and kicked him out, “C’mere. None of that. Come on.”
“SHIELD will know we’re missing in a few days and will send for us,” Natasha had said once they crawled out of the wreckage, brushing dust off of her catsuit, “We’ll need to survive until then.”
it out of him--”
“Shhh, sweetheart. Almost done,” Steve said quietly, smoothing his hand over Tony’s thigh.
“If I go out first, you know that I would be the first to run into an enemy, right?” Tony asked as he walked, shifting Peter to his other shoulder.
“Clearly, that’s why you’re looking at me like I suddenly morphed into Barton.”
“…I should probably help him, then,” he sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “Maybe PJ would like to help, too. We can try to find some real clothes for him and maybe a toy or two. Oh, and he needs to be fed, that’s what I was
PJ looked up at Tony with red-rimmed eyes, and after a second, shook his head.
Tony stumbled into the elevator and called out to JARVIS to take him to the penthouse without stopping, slumping against the back wall with a soft groan. He needed his MIT hoodie that he’d stolen from Rhodey, an Irish coffee, and a nice few days of nonstop working to soothe his already heavily damaged self-worth.
Tony stepped back out into the main room and paused, noticing a distinct lack of boyfriend in the room. He went over to peek into the main store and found him animatedly talking on the phone, his voice too quiet to hear. Rolling his eyes, Tony skipped over to the mirror to look himself over, turning on his heels to check out his ass from three different angles. He waited another fifteen minutes before going to check on Steve again, becoming concerned when he saw that he was still on the phone, pacing the front of the store. Making an executive decision, Tony gathered up their clothes and stuffed them in one of the store’s purchases bags, scurrying out to the register to hand over his card to pay. The woman working the counter gave him a tight smile as he nearly swiped his card back once the transaction was done, immediately hurrying to Steve’s side to see what was wrong.
Tony felt his heart break a little. Even if he could not feel Steve’s shame through the bond, the poor man soured the whole room with his scent, clearly in distress. He wanted to get up and throw himself at Steve to comfort him, but Peter beat him to it and began to cry, no doubt upset by the Prime’s scent.
“Where are we going in such a hurry?” Tony grumbled, nuzzling Peter’s head while he stayed in line with Steve.
“That’s it. I’m so,
“Captain?”
“No, no. I would help you pump every day and make sure you are as comfortable as you could be, given the circumstances. Induced motherhood is not easy, Tony. Your body’s natural response to Peter is to take care of him the best way it can, which includes producing for him. There…There are some upsides to it, if that helps. Your pheromones become stronger and help strengthen his resistance to illness.”
He tired of the position and pulled out, ignoring Steve’s whines as he pushed the man onto his back. He took Steve’s hands and placed them behind his knees, forcing him to hold his legs up and apart. Tony quickly realigned himself and sunk back into the warm heat of Steve’s channel. With both hands on Steve’s waist, Tony resumed his pace, eagerly watching Steve’s cock bounce on his belly.
The boy looked warily between the three who remained in the room, eventually settling on Tony again. Seeming to realize they were not going to hurt him, he removed his thumb from his mouth, wiping it on the floor.
The helicopter couldn’t get there fast enough. It was all Steve could do to not throw up everywhere as he carefully peeled his husband out of the smoldering wreckage, careful of the machinery lodged in his chest. He had to call Bucky over to have him help lift Tony up out of the sand, trying to prevent him from getting any more hurt than he already was. Of course, Bucky was talking at a mile a minute, angrily ranting while Steve cradled Tony in his arms, silently praying that the chopper moved faster.
“Considering we decided to babysit you, and it's going to be with my super hearing, you’re not going anywhere.”
“I will go first. I want to stalk the perimeter anyway in case there are stragglers looking for us,” Clint sighed as he stood up and stretched, “Try to sleep. I will wake one of you up when I need to switch out.”
“Hey, robots, too. Robots are cool,” He grinned, showing it to PJ, “What d’ya think? Yes?”
. The jam, sure. It's yours, so you’d know. Maybe the ice cream. But definitely not Sarah’s shepherd’s pie—especially not those details. Steve is only that detailed during pillow-talk.”
“You’re a national treasure, God bless America,” Tony called back, snickering at Steve’s groan, “Make sure to feed him something bland. Eggs and toast.”
Tony rolled his eyes fondly and tugged the furs up, careful to cover Steve as much as possible to keep him warm. He kissed his head one more time before settling down, letting Steve’s scent lull him to sleep. They dozed the afternoon away, ending up tangled together in the furs when the supper bell rang. Tony picked his head up with a groan, laughing sleepily when he saw Steve’s sleeping face smushed into a pillow.
“I can get SHIELD to do the same,” Natasha agreed, looking over at Clint, “We’ll keep Fury in the loop, but only need-to-know.”
Wonderful.
“Penny for your thoughts, Captain.”
“Italian. Don’t even notice that I inhale it,” Tony snickered, setting his empty tub aside as he swiped the Moose Tracks from Steve’s hands, “Plus, I work it off. It’s fine.”
Scooping PJ up into his arms, Tony grumbled as he slipped on his moccasin slippers, raising an eyebrow at Steve still in his bed.
“Shh, Steve, I am all here, try to relax,” Tony tried again.
“Recalculating,” JARVIS said.
“I knew something was wrong,” He accused, “Tell me what hurts,
what you get from that?” Tony said, biting back a laugh, “Smooth, Rogers.”
“—who told me that a devil in hell had accidentally sent me upstairs and that he had a particularly nice torturer for me.”
“Good job, little one, telling me when you needed something,” Tony said quietly, gently stroking Peter’s fine hair, “Perhaps I should take you back to our room, hm? Today has been so stressful for you, I am sure of it…I should put you down for a rest.”
“That just seems like basic genetics. If the serum overwrote Steve’s DNA and then combined with mine, PJ would have half of the serum-coated DNA and then half regular,” Tony replied, scratching his chin as he finally looked over at Bruce, “So then, in theory, he’ll be affected half as much as Steve was by the serum. He won’t be normal, but he won’t be a super soldier. He’ll just be—”
“Eventually. He kept pulling himself to his feet using the bars of his crib as if he was going to get out of it and come look for you. I told him you would come up faster if he laid down and he fell asleep waiting for you.”
He lingered at the door, unsurprised that Steve had stayed behind.
“--and apparently the one dude who can get a good jump on Steve since I have known the damn man,” Clint finished with a sigh.
“But that’s the best
know you hurt when you bend wrong. You should be wearing a brace.”
Steve plucked the drawing from Bucky’s hands, pouting as he gave it back to Tony.
“Cute, Tasha,” Bucky said, making himself comfortable on Steve’s lap despite the Captain’s grunt, “You’d look good with kids.”
“Steve is going feral,” Natasha said quietly, drawing Tony into her body to keep him from watching what was happening, “James was fine until Steve came into the dining room. We could all smell you on him and I think James had the wrong impression of what had happened. They started off with quips and snide comments, but their natures could not handle two Alphas wanting to protect the same person.”
word, squashing out his last joint and stashing the weed bag underneath the lip of the roof. Carefully, he made his way over to the drainpipe, intent on shimmying down the three flights to the ground. Right before he could swing his legs over, he made a quick calculation, decided he had about a 43% chance of dying if he landed just the right way. The odds really weren’t that good, but the THC in his system wasn’t exactly helping his decision making, and he had a few minutes until the bell rang, so if he went now—
“Yep. But I told him pet names can only be for one person, so now I’m Daddy, and Steve’s Papa,” He continued, watching a myriad of expressions cross Bruce’s face, “You
“Tony!” Steve screamed, just as the engineer was tugged back by the now conscious HYDRA guard.
Before Peter could screech--or get out of the tub-- Tony cupped water up and washed down his hair, tilting him back so the water would not fall down his face. As soon as he finished, Peter made a disgruntled noise and attempted to escape, only to be grabbed around the waist and plunked back down into the water.
With a nod, Tony gently let go of PJ and stood, letting the orderlies take the rolling bed as he trailed behind. Somewhere, a small thought in his head reminded him that
After numerous twisting hallways, they ended up in front of two large, oak doors. Two of the lackeys swung them both open, while the other two jabbed their weapons into Tony’s back to get him to stumble forward into the opulent study. Even Tony was impressed: more by the massive amount of scientific equipment in the room, rather than the sheer wealth and power that the room radiated.
It was quiet for a moment, then the bed creaked as Steve shifted and got up, not even bothering with a goodbye as he left the room. The bond strained and protested, but Tony had plenty of experience with tamping down his feelings, so he ignored it in favor of rocking Peter in his arms.
“Fair,” Tony sighed as he set his fork down and leaned back in his chair.
“Did they leave?” He asked, shaking Steve’s head with his shoulder to force him to sit up, “Where did they go?”
Tony let Clint’s babbling turn into white noise, investigating the box of wood blocks in front of him. With his tongue poking out of his mouth, he carefully started to construct a building, using the round pieces as columns for structural integrity and curb appeal. It took a while, but soon Tony had a decent building, resembling something designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
“What did you give me? What did you do?” Tony asked sharply, “Why do I feel better?”
“Shh, love,” Tony whispered, hefting Pete up to rest against his chest, “Let me see, small one.”
. It’s a universal variable. Every problem always equals cuddles.”
“No more leaving your ass and prick out on display. Put on something that covers you, or I will gouge out the eyes of anyone who looks at you,” Tony said firmly.
The missing wind in his face wasn’t what bothered Tony most, it was the silence. They would drive for at least another hour before arriving back at the house and now that the car wasn’t flying over the road, it’d most definitely take
If only he would have gotten what he’d been promised - a troublemaker. Steve had spent the majority of his life dealing with people who were out looking for a fight. Most of the time, he’d been on the shorter end of the stick and forced to take whatever those idiots had in store for him. More often than not, that had been a broken nose or something similar.
Steve took a deep breath, one of his hands smoothing back a few of the curls that had fallen in his face. “What was that about you being an impeccable driver again?” Whether it was meant as a joke to lighten the situation or an angry off-hand comment, Tony didn’t know. It felt like a punch in the gut regardless.
The world needed Captain America - and they needed him fully functioning, ready to throw himself back on the battlefield with his mind on nothing but keeping his team safe and defeating the enemy.
His Dodge Viper GTS was parked just in front of the house, its red colour catching the rays of the midday sun, making it impossible to miss. Steve was standing at the back of it, wide-eyed and open-mouthed.
“It matters to the old man,” Tony remarked, lips curling into a vicious snarl. “Or didn’t you hear him just now? Wait, maybe you didn’t. I guess he didn’t yell at you the way he yelled at me. Thank god he wasn’t here in person, or else—”
Steve was more than happy to have been proven wrong.
That was exactly the reason for Tony’s next words. “You know, it’s okay now.” He regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth. It broke the trance Steve was in, his eyes snapping open as he turned his head to look at Tony questioningly. “Alright, not
The man’s eyes caught his own, capturing Tony’s undivided attention in an instant. Steve wasn’t smiling but he wasn’t frowning either and with the conversation they just had, Tony counted that as a win. The smile he flashed Steve was an immediate reaction to that.
What hurts more, however, is watching the person he loves flinch back upon hearing them. “I didn’t think that.”, Steve whispers. Tony’s heart beats once inside his chest. “Not really. Maybe. I-- I’m sorry, Tony.” Another beat, this one louder to his own ears. “I’m sorry.”
Sighing, he turned his head to look at the panicking man in the passenger seat clinging to the console as if his life depended on it. “Dude, didn’t you like fly planes or something? Surely that must have been faster than my darling can go.”
Fantastic.
“Captain Rogers.” The man’s voice was as friendly as it could get, whatever scolding tone he had used with Tony just moments before completely gone. “I take it that Tony isn’t with you anymore?”
Well, and Steve had owed him a little compensation after that, hadn’t he? A quick meal and some rest - that was more than acceptable.
That realization didn’t make the drive home any less awkward. Tony actually made sure not to break the speed limit, something that hadn’t happened for a long time. It was too slow for him, way too slow, but Steve seemed to relax a little upon noticing so he kept it up.
There was a large window that allowed him to look directly into the living room and although he was a good distance away from it, the distinct movement of a silhouette pacing up and down behind the glass was unmistakable.
Steve frowned. He wasn’t a fan of the cold, sure, but being trapped inside a burning house was the other kind of extreme. His eyes met Tony’s and he was taken aback. There was pure excitement blazing inside the hazelnut orbs, like the fire Tony had been teasing him about. It was the first time since the young man’s arrival that they showed something besides boredom and borderline resentment.
His head dropped back down, eyes focusing on the peaceful water. In contrast to Tony (who had swan dived in there during his very first day staying there), Steve had yet to actually touch it. He knew that the water wouldn’t be freezingly cold. He knew even without Tony telling him so.
Tony smirked at his very fitting comparison.
Pouting, Tony looked at him once again, completely ignoring his order. “Why do you still doubt my amazing driving skills? Surely, by now, you should know better.” Maybe he had occupied two lanes a few minutes ago but that was on Steve and Steve alone. It had nothing to do with his driving.
The wind rustling through the leaves above him brought Steve back to the present. He blinked slowly, raising his head to watch the twigs shake under the force of the breeze they were exposed to.
.” Even if the comment was meant as a joke (which he somehow doubted), Steve wasn’t about to laugh. He wasn’t about to listen to him speaking like that at all. “That isn’t funny. I know your sense of humour differs from mine and I have mostly accepted that yours is a tad bit more… crude.” That was still an understatement. “But I won’t stand here and listen to you talking about yourself in such an awful way.”
Another minute passed without him building up the courage to say anything - right until he told himself to stop being a big baby. He had been the one to bring this up in the first place, hadn’t he? The least he could do now was respond.
“Oh, didn’t you?” Now, Steve did sound angry. Rightfully so, he guessed. He had nearly caused a car crash after all. But beneath the anger, Tony heard a good amount of fear as well and that was worse than any hatred. “That was close.”
“Slow the damn car down, Tony!”
It gave Tony the chance to bask in the glory of the man’s side profile. That jawline could cut through anything, including him. He honestly wouldn’t complain. Tony hummed at the image that was created in his mind, the sound catching Steve’s attention in a matter of heartbeats.
but it doesn’t matter. Anyways.” Tony cleared his throat, his voice had gotten a little rough. “I should just drive into a fucking tree. Get it over and done with so the bastard will stop bothering me."
It only confused Steve all the more.
Rogers was silent for a moment before replying. “That sounds like a good idea. The books, that is.” Tony couldn’t say that he was surprised about hearing that. Rogers, inside a public place and surrounded by dozens of people, didn’t strike him as likely, not this early in his stay at least.
Steve looked like he was going to blame him for it. He whirled around to face Tony, hands balling into fists at his side. “I don’t care what you think you saw. It’s not true.” He’d never seen Steve this defensive before, blue eyes blazing with a kind of passion Tony hadn’t seen until now. He’d struck a nerve then.
Steve chuckled where he sat on the couch. “So, up until now, you have been a pleasant companion?”
He had asked his father about it once. That had been a big mistake. Tony was used to getting yelled at for any matter whatsoever - but he had been utterly freaked out by the quiet and tense voice the old man had used to explain to him that homosexuality wasn’t something you should be proud of, much less talk about.
Tony and Rhodey stared at him but Bruce shrugged off their curiosity.
you?”
“Sit, tall person, you’re making me uneasy,” he grumbled, opting to sit on PJ’s bed instead.
Of course, being the insomniac that he was, Tony stayed awake for another hour or so, allowing himself to enjoy Steve’s familiar weight curled up next to him, listening to the man breathe as he slept on. It was one of those moments where he realized that, despite the shit that was collapsing around him, despite the mountains he knew he’d have to climb in both his new relationship with Steve and with fatherhood, and despite the oncoming dread of having to face his fears, Tony decided that for right then, he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world.
Not even Steve’s exclaimed “Tony!” could keep Bucky from cackling in laughter, standing up to drag Rhodey out with a yelled “Have fun!” before the door swung shut.
troublemaker. You know full well I’d never pick Bucky over you. He’s not even my type,” he said dismissively, waving his hand.
“The Prime… can be strange about these things,” Bruce said, “Deaths weigh heavy on him. He feels responsible for the safety of the entire army, even though it is impossible for him to protect everyone at once. I have also never seen them come back this beaten up. Something must have gone wrong. Come, let us go meet them.”
He shook the thought from his head and turned to look at a small boy tucked away in a beanbag chair in the corner, large circular glasses almost dwarfing his face. He was quietly reading a book that Tony couldn’t quite make out the name of, but since the print was small, he figured that the boy was pretty smart since he could read lots of small letters. Tony wanted to go over and join him, since he, too, could read lots of small letters, but one of the larger boys with long, blond hair tied back into a ponytail went over first, so Tony stopped his feet and stood still.
Feeling awkward, Tony slipped off his chair and went over to his and Steve’s cubby, taping the robot up onto his side. He affectionately ran his fingers over the waxy crayon before heading over to Miss Hill. Quietly, he tugged on her pants, and when she looked down at him, he handed up the tape roll. Before she could ask any questions, he scooted off back to Steve, only to realize the boy had been drawn into playing with the dinosaurs and the dollhouse. He pretended that he didn’t feel a bit disappointed, so he slid back into his seat and picked up his book, getting lost in the story.
Thankfully, the guard hadn’t seemed to notice that PJ had scooted around the two of them, standing behind them both as he cowered. However, once Tony’s neck had been sliced open, a deep anger welled up in the boy’s body, to the point where he reached out, and with one good yank, pulled the guard away and hurtled him into the back of the truck. The guard smacked against the divide with a sharp crack, slumping down into the bed of the truck. Able to gulp down breaths, Tony turned to look at PJ, but decided that addressing the sudden strength could wait.
Steve nodded and they pulled apart; Tony gave PJ one last kiss before heading out the door, hurrying down to his own room to nearly throw himself into the shower. He wasn’t expecting anything, and wasn’t really sure if he wanted to start something like that this soon with Steve, but he absolutely wanted Steve to stay the night, so he took the time to make sure his face was cleaned up and his beard was trimmed. Looking into the mirror, Tony winced at the bruising on his naked form, turning around to check out the damage on his back and legs.
“Alright. The last thing is your face, sweet cheeks. If you have an attack, it’s okay, I’m right here and Papa’s right outside,” Tony said calmly, re-soaking the cloth and twisting out as much water as possible, “I’m going to make this as quick as possible, then you’ll be ready for bed.”
Beyond freaked out at this point, Steve only nodded, an aura of smallness and inferiority radiating off of him. Tony shoved the Captain down to sit on the ottoman, glaring at him before turning a gentle face to PJ.
“Shh, darling, my love, everything is alright,” he soothed, lifting up the baby’s dress to check his undergarment, “You are clean, you have been fed—is it just attention you need, little one? Have I not given you enough? Tsk, how awful of me, hm?”
Tony barely held back his eye roll. He pointed at Steve, then at the bed, reaching out to gently touch his arm to try and guide him. Surprisingly, the Alpha went and laid down, turning to his side so he could look up at Tony. After a second, Steve scooted back and patted the bed, looking confused that Tony had not moved with him.
A voice drew his attention and he turned his head toward Steve, scrunching his brows in confusion. The Alpha motioned at him to wait before jogging off, returning moments later with Thor in tow.
“Didn’t ask you, peanut gallery.”
“Tony?”
time, please don’t cry—”
“Can we get settled for lunch first? I think he is hungry.”
Tony grunted, but scooped PJ back up anyway, feeling a twinge of guilt at constantly shifting the boy around. He followed Natasha back to the common room, watching Bruce attempt to field questions from the Avengers.
PJ nodded, happily taking the sippy cup from Steve. He put it up to his lips and took a long swig as the trio made their way back to the bedroom, now vacant of any Avengers. Wriggling in Tony’s arms, PJ bounced down onto his bed, only to stare at the new decorations covering his room: twinkling lights hung on the ceiling with a large net full of stuffed animals, various Avengers posters littered the walls, and even a framed photo of Steve and Tony from the Holiday party of the year after the Battle of New York rested on the nightstand. Taking note of the boy’s staring, Tony sat down next to him on the bed, slowly waving a hand in front of his face to get his attention without frightening him.
Bucky’s voice filtered through the door before it was rudely kicked open and both men trudged in, taking their places in the chairs by the bed. Bucky snorted at the sight of them curled up together, but Rhodey paid it no mind, collapsing into the chair with a wheeze.
Bruce nodded, holding his hand out as PJ reached out to try and grab at his coat. He couldn’t help but smile fondly at the child, letting him play with the cuff.
“Hey!” Clint yelled, grinning like an idiot as he continued to shoot despite not even turning his head, “We heard you got into some trouble!”
, Tony found himself thinking, before shaking himself out of his thoughts. He pointed at himself, and Steve nodded, not at all ashamed.
“I… look forward to it,” Steve said, placing a hand on top of Tony’s, “All of it.”
“Everything okay? Tony?” Steve asked, searching his eyes.
“No brace,” He answered immediately, not meeting Tony’s gaze, “I don’t need it.”
“We are half-naked, Steve!” He exclaimed, smacking his back playfully, “The others will see!”
The animalistic feelings were too thick to pry open. In an attempt to soothe them, Tony tried to picture calming things, like summer walks on the beach and laying in bed long after the sunrise. Peter’s weight on his chest brought forth vivid images of the babe sleeping on him and cuddling up to him, so Tony concentrated on those and hoped that Steve could feel him.
Steve turned and stuffed the compass into his utility belt, nodding at his Lieutenant who had poked his head into his tent.
“Affirmative. Shall I take you there?”
“Then you should be very careful. If you have not been exposed to heavy spices for a long time, you may not have enough bodily resistance to their… unpleasant effects,” Bruce said, “I will try to see if our chef has other dishes that can expand your horizons without destroying your bowels. Fair?”
-dest things!” Rhodey cooed right back, also pitching his voice up as he attempted to not laugh, “I can’t be-
They have to grow up sometime.
“No, its butter pecan,” Steve said, raising an eyebrow as he leaned forward to look over at Bucky, “I mean, strawberry is good, but butter pecan will
tired of Fury using us like marionettes, damn the consequences,” Steve growled, bringing Tony’s hand up to his lips to kiss gently.
,” Steve snapped, “Why would you ask that?”
Tony sucked in a breath at that, inwardly scolding himself for letting his brain go to that place for a second. He sighed and shook his head, taking his hand from PJ’s hair to rub his temples.
The room shook as a loud explosion went off outside. Shouting and the clanging of swords froze them in place until a loud trumpet broke the stupor. Natasha moved first, pocketing her knife as she ran to look through the doorway.
“Shh! Someone will hear and you know we will never hear the end of it.”
“Yeah, kiddo. Papa’s taking some of the family out for a trip. They won’t be back for a bit, so we say bye-bye when they leave.”
He stopped when Steve reemerged, flushing brightly at the garments in his hands. One held a plain shirt, but the other held the dreaded nursing bra. Tony looked at it, then looked back to Steve, frowning when the Alpha shook it at him.
“Good evening, my love,” Tony breathed, yawning and moving to sit up and cradle the baby in his arms, “We should find you some food—I have ruined your night’s sleep, have I not? Ah, well. Perhaps after a full meal you will be willing to go back to sleep.”
The room fell into dead silence, save for Tony’s muffled sobs into Rhodey’s shoulder.
“Alright, alright, enough,” Bruce sighed, “Let's get on with this. I want to go back to my lab.”
It was supposed to be one of his best years: he and Steve were closer than ever, Howard had been distracted with the newly minted
