“Give me a second,” he mutters, sensing Sherlock’s impending questions. His head is spinning between his daughter –
The artist is a pretentious twat, but John admires his work. They’re mostly of the same woman, red hair, and big blue eyes.
John presses his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder and lets Sherlock’s warm laughter swallow him whole. It’s nice. Not unlike what kissing Mary had been like, in their cold kitchen whilst she made hot chocolate, Rosie sleeping in her cot. But there’s something else there. More history, more contentment. Because as much as John loved – and still does love – Mary…
“Beautiful, isn’t she?” John turns to find the artist – Franklin, he reminds himself – standing behind him. “Your boyfriend’s in the bathroom.”
“Right.” Sherlock had given him an odd look then scooped Rosie out of her chair, brushing crumbs off her dungarees. “Come on, little Watson, you’ll be late for nursery.” John had watched, the calm of the storm in their whirlwind, as they donned boots and raincoats. “I’ll be out most of the day,” Sherlock told him before they left. “Chasing a case.”
that they both occasionally needed days off from detective work. If something happened to Rosie and they were off chasing murderers, neither of them would ever forgive themselves. “I’ll pick up some milk on the way home. And eggs,” he added, glancing at John’s plate.
It’s a sketch of Baker Street’s living room, John’s empty armchair, his slippers by the roaring fire, a half-blurred figure in the kitchen making food. John suspects it’s him by the height. It’s good. Of course. Sherlock Holmes settles for nothing less than perfection and John has no doubt he’s honed the skill for hours upon hours before even letting his hobby become known.
The next few pages are clearly after Mycroft had gifted the watercolours, splashes of colour filling the pages. It’s mostly Rosie, her face captured in every possible angle and moment, but others frequent. Mycroft and Lestrade drinking coffee at their kitchen table, Molly in the lab, Mrs Hudson smiling, a dressing gown wrapped firmly around her. An odd page scribbled out but the lurkings of Irene Adler’s smile underneath the black pen. There are scribblings around the art, mostly indecipherable as Sherlock’s writing often is, but he catches some of it.
The thought seems odd but when John walks around the counter, takes his face in his hands, it comes naturally to both of them. Bumping their noses together, John tilting his head, leaning forward and pressing his lips against Sherlock’s. Sherlock kisses back hesitantly, like John is something delicate, then he touches John’s waist.
In two weeks’ time I had a new pair of trousers to wear with my brown coat again. My “disappeared” trousers laundered nicely, and the seams stayed intact despite Holmes’s pressings, but nevertheless, we decided to keep them.
“In this case I have the advantage of–let’s call it—the clue, which will guide you in the solution of the mystery of your missing trousers.”
I shifted my eyes to his face. “I see you dress to the right,” I said with a smile, to see if he appreciated my tailor joke, but the knot of his eyebrows begged me to be serious.
He wriggled slightly; his hands gripped the arms of his chair. “Yes—good—for I was a gentleman…of…the road…” he murmured. I noticed him roll his tongue back-and-forth in his mouth and wondered how long he had been doing that. Though his face was calm, he appeared to be dreaming with his eyes open, or perhaps fighting an invisible demon. I gently squeezed the lateral side of his calf and for that moment, he was not restless or in a rush; he was grounded in my grip, trusting me and enjoying completely.
Giving a wide smile and a slight snort, he removed his hands from behind his head and reached for my hands. His speech was alert but somewhat strained. “I will show you—if–you forgive me–for making off with your trousers…” His voice cracked, “and if you’ll let me remove them again…”
“Pins and needles, my dear Watson.” As Holmes and I laid on the rug and watched the flames of the fire dwindle, I could feel the tide recede as he showed signs of blood flowing back into his extremities.
I continued nervously where I left off. “Every night I adhere some pieces before laying out my suit for the next day. Last night it was the delicate details of the mast…Holmes—I am missing a pair of linen trousers. No one goes into my bedroom except for you, and Mrs. Hudson, but she would have no reason–”
I gave him a mock-stern look. With some shakiness, I felt my hands around the sides of his knees and snaked up the sides of his thighs, at a faster rate than when I inched up his ankles.
He threw his head to the side. I continued to deduce. “There appear to be traces of some kind of dry grass clinging to the inner seams…the hems have been crudely shortened, with a combination of cutting and rolling.” Holmes, now gnawing on his index finger as if to suppress some excitement, peered down at me, raising his brow as a signal to continue. “The relaxed fit looks comfortable for a tramp to wear, especially if he was a working man.”
“Of course,” I nodded, resigned to accept the forces behind this insignificant folly in which I had been swept up. I opened my mouth to ask how Mrs. Hudson knew my measurements, but stopped before any words could come. For with a blink of his eyes, I remembered.
I, in my usual morning slump, had been waiting for two days to ask Holmes about something pressing on my mind. I thought of it last night at the opera, and earlier in the day when we were in the Yard office, and in the cab ride before that, but I was unable to work up the gumption. You see, Holmes and I are the most intimate of friends, but there are some behaviours we had agreed to forgive, even to the point of silent protest, or loud protest in the case of his addictions. The matter at hand was one unlike any I’d noticed before, and because of the manner of our intimacy, it seemed not a queer enough event to bring up in conversation. Yet it was of a questionable moral slant for a gentleman.
After a minute of nothing from me but light perspiration and timid silence, Holmes reached for my left hand, which I rested in his, and guided it to where his finger paused from tracing his hem up the vase of his ankle. He nodded again, in the direction of the magnifying lens in my hand.
Here my mind recalled last night’s little game, in which he dressed as a tailor complete with measuring tape and yard sticks—in either arm, the option of a measure soft and flexible, or hard and rigid, to suit my whims, he said. I appeared to him as a customer, stripped down to my underclothes, and for nearly two hours his bedroom had been transformed into my own custom tailor shop, in which he, and his lean, exacting arms, were entirely at my service. Little did I know that he would make practical use of the information he gathered when he was measuring me in all manners of torturous ways; his study of me knew no bounds. It seemed whether I was aware or not that he was always measuring some aspect of me. Much about me seems to delight my companion but nothing about me surprises him. He even had a reaction ready for my small outburst that spurred this discourse.
“I say, Holmes,” I looked him in the eye and stroked the back of either leg with my fingertips, “what other…elements of interest…did you say may be in this case, of these trousers that used to be mine?” I eased the tips of my index fingers between his soft skin and the tightly rolled trouser hems, and rolled my tongue against the back of my top teeth, as if to cement my inquiry for a warrant into my former trousers.
Holmes and I had just been seated for breakfast in Baker Street. He was in a cheery mood, on a high from having revealed a hidden murderer in Norwood, thereby saving his client from being wrongfully hanged for the murder, a case on which I am still ordering my notes.
With that, he steadily undid his first trouser button. Though I took much pleasure in watching his long, nimble fingers fiddle a button through a hole, I decided to indulge his request for assistance. I grasped his hands, and with a caress of his palms I placed them on my shoulders, and looked him in the eyes. “I forgive you, dear chap.”
“And you’ve had some difficulty in your sartorial arrangements because of it of late. Oh, Watson, I do hope you’ll forgive me. For I have sent Mrs. Hudson to the tailors to order a pair of trousers to replace the ones that I have necessarily taken for my own disposal.”
I continued to mutter my observations. “My 'mudwater brown’ trousers were made somewhat ashen by the bonfire.” I raised the magnifying lens to them, teasing his knees with my knuckles as I moved the lens over them. I clicked my tongue. “There is a hole beginning in the right knee.” I breathed over it. “Ahhhhh. Do you feel that?”
I lit a match and puffed at my cigar until I was sure it was lit, stealing a look at Holmes all the while. His lips were parted in a half-smile and his hair, still sweaty, clung to his temples. His eyes appeared to move beneath his lids.
I gave a light kiss on the inside of either leg in hopes to relax him and steal another taste of salt before I drew my head back. Curiously, keeping his hem raised with my hands, I flipped the front of the nightgown upward and folded it onto my friend’s chest. I could not tell if Holmes noticed but for a twitch of a smile, for his eyes were closed.
“My only plan for today was to write, Holmes…but if you have a line of investigation to follow, I am your man.”
To my remark, Holmes opened his eyes to glance at the trousers still hanging from the arm of his chair. I followed his gaze. The manner in which the trousers hung so straight and neat was comical, as if they offered a question of their own. I returned my gaze to Holmes. He angled his face to look at me and answered with a smirk, then closed his eyes again.
He knew. He, with eyes closed, simply grinned at my stern tease and threw his head back with a chuckle. He had drifted somewhere beyond his primary domain, to a place where words don’t come easily. He raked his hands through his uncombed fluff of hair and pursed his lips before relaxing again.
Holmes lay on his back with his hands folded over his abdomen. I was on my side, careful not to touch him. He turned his head to face me, his eyes still vulnerable, yet shining with something I read as pride and gratitude.
In my right hand, now absent of a pen, I felt him place the hard handle of something—I could tell it was metal, warm from his hands. I looked down and saw his magnifying lens. I said nothing, but looked back into his eyes. He puffed his cigarette. “You know my methods.”
I took the lens in hand again and buried my face in the drumstick of his inner calf, feeling the rigid knobs on the surface of his tibia against my cheek and brow, and the soft, lightly hairy flesh of his leg to my nose. He responded by pressing back into me, and for a moment we were bonded, face to leg, each drawn into the softness and the scratch of the other. When I pulled away I saw a patch of redness from our friction, and brushed over it with my knuckles, barely, for soothing.
I was missing a pair of trousers–the only pair that match my brown jacket. I thought I’d bring it up lightly, by talking about things physically close to their last seen location: my bedroom, a room I have welcomed my friend into on a number of occasions–and see what clues he might furnish me with as to their disappearance. On this day I took longer than usual to prepare myself for breakfast with my flatmate, as I silently rehearsed the scenario. At the dining table, my first cup of coffee gave me enough nerve to ask.
“My dear Watson,” he said, and picked up the coffee pot to pour me a cup, “I needed them, most urgently. Do you recall the murder that took place in Norwood, how my most vital witness in solving the case was a 'gentleman of the road’? And how not even dear old Lestrade had caught on that tramps had camped there? Well, I found it in the best interest of the case to dress in tramp costume for the interview. And you’ve seen their dress; it was best that I found a garment not tailored to me in order to look the part. You were at your club when I urgently needed to construct this costume, so I helped myself to the mousiest brown pair of linen trousers in your wardrobe–I should call them mudwater-coloured–and altered them with a pair of shears. Don’t worry, for Mrs. Hudson is at the tailor’s with your measurements at this moment.”
So far I trusted him in each encounter; I felt safe and guided by him, and shaped by the use of his methods. He had never hurt me, nor made me uncomfortable; yet, he had a way of elevating me to the thrill of not knowing what is next, nor what mark we may establish in the span of our moving shoreline. With past intimate friends, I had more clearly categorized such encounters, but with Holmes I felt myself cautiously wading into a warm pool. In this moment in front of the fire, his eyes anticipated something.
I then eagerly finished the task of unbuttoning his–or my—fly with zest, then watched the centimeters of skin grow on him, beckoning my hands to move exponentially faster than I did on my journey up his long, supple legs, which now cradled my torso.
Holmes drew in the smoke of his cigarette, then threw it into the fire. He gave a slight nod, and as his expression changed to mischievous, he bent forward just enough to reach the hem of his nightgown with his left fingertips. Slowly he curled back his thumb and all but his long thin forefinger to raise his hem above his feet, then straightened his finger to lower it again. Maintaining contact between his fingertip and the arch of his foot, he began to trace upward, playfully pulling the fabric up to reveal his skin, then uncurling his finger and the fabric down to cover it again, while watching my responses to his mild teasing game.
Holmes writhed in his chair. I blushed at the sight of his arousal pressing at the inside of a pair of my trousers, but I didn’t move the lens over it, for such a joke would be unkind, and anyway it was apparent that I needed no optical assistance in observing that clue. The only sensible way to employ the lens now would be to place the edge of it along his base—which I did–then stroke upward, not too hard, as though with a comb, up and off before reaching the end.
While I did so, I felt a warm rush through the center of me as I was once again overtaken by the vivid memory. Now I had no yardstick, but my hands and the lens were up to the task, as all the while I recalled how he pushed back our shoreline one centimeter at a time with his finger perched over the edge of the yardstick, then rescinded it a half-centimeter, and up again two more centimeters, until the waves grew exponentially and beyond my calculation. Soon all the numbers and straight lines dissolved into grains of sand as I felt each wave lapping up a little higher, until Holmes rushed into me and soon I was enveloped in one steady motion of wet nourishing pressure.
“I’m sure you did, Holmes. And you solved the case and now I’m out a pair of trousers. If I am to wait two weeks for a new pair of trousers from the tailors I’d at least like to see what you put them through in order to obtain your result! Nevertheless I am happy to hear that a pair of shabby trousers helped you in your success.”
As I was caught up in that flashback it must have shown, because Holmes twitched impatiently and let out a slight groan. I reached for the cushion beneath his arm for something to kneel on.“At my own pace, please, Holmes, as I don’t know just what to anticipate here but you have yet to earn my forgiveness for what you’ve done.”
He paused, trying to read the tone of my last statement, then seemed to abandon the thought. “They are to be laundered before I turn them over to the Irregulars but, let me warn you that they are a bit”–he tipped his head down slightly–“short.”
“Despite having taken a bath, your skin smells faintly of smoke from a bonfire.” Feeling overtaken by the scent, I pressed my mouth into his flesh to steal a taste. “And you taste like salt…savory…and sweet tobacco…like licorice…”
“Well, I haven’t fully disposed of them; I figure they can be worn by one of the Irregulars—how they grow so fast, some of them are in men’s clothes already–”
He looked away, then back at me, slightly blushing. “And, my dear, please let me earn your forgiveness by keeping you entertained with the study of your missing trousers, hmm? For there are other…“ he turned his head and shoulders to the side in a slim gesture, leaning away from the dining table, ”…elements that may be of interest to you in this case.” Holmes can be, as observed by my old friend Percy, such an inscrutable fellow.
“One minor accommodation before I go in…” I smoothed my hands along the front flaps of Holmes’s purple dressing gown, then parted it to the sides, first his right, then his left, exposing the emerald-colored silk lining. The flaps of the gown draped over the arms of the chair like the tail of a peacock outstretched, revealing in full his long white nightgown. Holmes shivered slightly, inhaled deeply, then relaxed into a small sigh. With his head thrown back, his eyes appeared to be barely open, but he was watching me; of that I was certain. I returned to the task of inspection at hand.
The pasta bubbles. Silence reigns in the kitchen and when John chances a look at Sherlock’s face, the mask has dropped to show very hesitant consideration.
John clears his throat, glances back out of the window. The sky has turned from pink to a deep blue, the moon hanging up on a silver thread just behind the buildings on the other side of the street. “How would you paint that?” He asks and Sherlock looks surprised.
“Yes.” John tries to decipher Sherlock’s expression but it’s cleared before he can. His eyes are carefully blank, mouth in a firm line. “I shouldn’t have but…I was looking for a missing shoe.” That’s as good of an excuse as any. He doesn’t want Sherlock to know that he had purposefully invaded his privacy, wanted to stir through the intimate settings of Sherlock’s room.
“It’s because you never stay still long enough for me to capture the colours.” Sherlock looks fond, amused, and John’s skin melts off him at the thought of him sitting still for Sherlock to study him, stare at him and capture him in hues of pink, blue and grey. “You’re a very hard man to pin down, John Watson.”
“You shouldn’t pay so much attention to those things.” Sherlock considers him for a moment then retrieves a sketchbook from where it had been tucked under a pile of Rosie’s toys. It’s the leather one, the one dedicated to John. He sits in his own armchair, back to the TV, and grabs a pencil off the side table. “They’ll corrupt your mind.”
, John Watson,” she announces, starting to pile dishes into the sink. Then she seems to see him properly, frowning. “You look pale, dear. Are you alright?”
She returns to Sherlock’s chair, her eyes locked onto the cartoons again, and John sets to making her dinner. Once the pasta’s boiling and he’s slid some garlic bread onto a tray in the oven, he turns back to Sherlock.
That had been a few hours ago and John had milled around for a while, watched television and took the precious alone time for a bath. And then he was faced with Sherlock’s closed bedroom door in his wandering. Neither of them had spoken about it – that Rosie is getting too old to be sharing John’s room but there’s no spare bedroom in Baker Street. The idea of moving is reprehensible to John and he’s sure Sherlock feels the same horror when faced with finding some nice boring suburban house with no Mrs Hudson, no history, no bullet holes in the wall.
When Sherlock started shifting in bed Lestrade thought it would be best to call John, regardless of how much he needed sleep. He would be furious at Lestrade if he'd known Sherlock had been stirring and he hadn't been called, so Lestrade picked up his phone and dialed John's number.
John wasn't sure whether to be worried or relieved at Lestrade's words. He was infinitely grateful that Lestrade found him, but the circumstances weren't the best. Why was Sherlock on the roof? Lestrade said he just wanted some air but surely there were other places he could go. John knew he was probably overthinking and overreacting but after St. Bart's he didn't want to know about Sherlock on another roof again.
Sherlock started exploring John’s mouth with his tongue. He wanted to touch every part of John. He wanted to map it all out with his hands and his tongue and create a room in his mind palace dedicated to John’s body. It seemed John had the same idea as he started undoing Sherlock’s shirt so he could get to the detective’s chest.
His eyes were still closed and John marveled at Sherlock's ability to tell John apart from everyone else without even opening his eyes. John moved closer, his eyes raking over Sherlock's body, taking in all the injuries he could see.
It was then that John reached him and Sherlock immediately removed his coat and thrust it towards the doctor. "Hold that for me, would you?"
Eventually John disengaged himself from Sherlock, who had collapsed back against the headboard. His eyes were shut and his lips were pressed into a thin line.
“Yes,” John replied, “keep doing that.” He held himself over Sherlock with one hand and pushed his own trousers and pants further down his legs, giving Sherlock more room to work with.
He’d told Sherlock about the case and the subsequent fire. About how John had run as soon as he’d received Sherlock’s text.
The words swim in the kitchen between them and John looks out of the window, eyes settling on the pink and orange sunset outside. It’s bright, and beautiful, and he wonders what colours Sherlock would use to paint it. If he’d include John in the painting, the silhouette of his face pained, worrying at his lip.
Then there’s no time to think because Sherlock is home, bearing groceries and a grisly tale about his latest cadaver.
His stomach flips and he feels the urge to shove the sketchbook back into the dark corners of Sherlock’s room, where it can’t get to him. But curiosity wins out and he flips through the pages quickly, like they’ll burn him.
“Dadda,” Rosie says, toddling into the kitchen. John automatically reaches for her, but she goes to Sherlock. “I’m hungry.”
. Because this sketchbook is filled with pictures of John – all charcoal and pencil. There’s no colour but Sherlock clearly doesn’t need colour to decipher every inch of John’s face in picture perfect detail. John crying, John smiling, lying on a picnic blanket, talking to someone, holding a coffee. It’s all just—him.
. But then he thinks of how Sherlock had sat at the café with them afterwards sketching away in that little black book. “What’s that?” John had asked, peering over the table and Sherlock had pulled it to his chest, hiding the pages.
“You want to have a conversation with me,” Sherlock says and John jumps slightly. He turns and finds Sherlock on the other side of the counter, stood like he was being taken to the noose. “I lied to you, John.”
“You go through them at an extortionate rate.” Sherlock sighed and left, Rosie on his hip as usual, chattering away.
The first page is different from the other sketchbook. It only bears a single word, written in neat print.
“Relatively.” John knows what’s coming. He’s known Sherlock long enough to recognise the confession in his eyes, about to spill out of his mouth. He doesn’t know whether to be afraid or not and settles for a blank look. “You are an interesting subject, John, for any artist. You don’t realise how interesting you are to everyone around you. How…captivating. You believe you are ordinary, normal, but you are enough but. Especially…” Sherlock swallows, his jaw tight, and John feels sick with nerves. “Especially to me. You are extraordinary, John.”
“Thought you were just defacing a book.” John had shrugged it off to Sherlock’s odd habits but it had kept re-emerging far past the point where John could ignore it. Mycroft had even gifted Sherlock some expensive watercolour paints and an easel for his birthday. Sherlock had set the easel on fire with his cigarette butt to his mother’s horror, in some show of defiance to Mycroft during another Christmas day tantrum, but John had seen him pocket the watercolours before they set back off home.
The rest of the day passes without time for much introspection. John gets sucked into the alluring world of daytime television, preoccupied with house renovations and cringe-inducing dating shows, until it’s time to pick Rosie up from nursery. John arranges a play-date with one of her friends’ mothers then they splash in puddles on the way home.
“Yes.” He sits on his armchair and turns the television on to some stand-up routine. The comedian is vaguely familiar. “He cheated on his wife, you know,” John says. “I read about it in Mrs Hudson’s gossip rags.”
. It stops me from being consumed by—” Sherlock stops, shakes his head as if to get rid of the thought, but John’s heart has stopped.
After finding Sherlock’s sketchbooks, John had thought about the possibility. Considered what he’d do if the drawings were a confession. And they are. And here they are. Here John is, still considering. “The date – on the cover,” he says and Sherlock laughs. “What?”
“Some tea bags too, please,” John said. He had leaned upwards to kiss Rosie’s cheek then tapped Sherlock’s shoulder, awkward as usual at the domesticity. “The good ones, not the ones you got last week.”
. John swallows. “I liked the ones of Rosie,” he says. “And you capture Mycroft well. But…the drawings of me are…different. A good different.”
The second page is similarly brilliant – Sherlock’s parents sat with Rosie, unwrapped boxes surrounding them. Rosie is drawn with such care, such precious gentleness, that John’s heart warms considerably towards Sherlock sneaking around with the sketchbook and being generally insufferable when interrupted during his drawing.
He hears a door open from down the hall and panics, hides the sketchbooks again, and stumbles out of Sherlock’s room. Mrs Hudson is stood in the kitchen, tutting.
“I’ll put a cuppa on.” She shoos him to his armchair, rattling the biscuit tin in his direction. “I think Grand Designs is on,” she adds, handing him the remote.
exploded,” Sherlock says as John puts the milk in the fridge, both checking to make sure Rosie isn’t listening. “Quite fascinating.”
“Well,” started Ella, “Maybe instead of looking for the similarities between them, look for the differences.”
Then finally he got someone who managed Oliver’s schedule to listen to the idea Oliver had. John explained that he knew Oliver was smart, and the school must know too if they allowed him into a higher grade. They worked out that if Oliver raised his marks and kept them up until after the holidays, Oliver’s advisor would work with his teachers to accommodate the way Oliver learns. Relief washed over him at hearing that, and couldn’t wait to go tell Oliver.
His phone beeped from his room, and he went and picked it up. A message from Caden glowed off the screen. He didn’t want to think about Caden, or anything that happened yesterday. He chewed the inside of his cheek, and opened the message.
As I'm already writing the third fic, hopefully buy the time you guys get there I'll be doing two updates a week. Please stick with me, and I love all your support!!
John walked back into the living room after ending a call from his sister. She just wanted to check in and chat with him for a bit, which he always enjoyed. Sherlock looked up when he stepped into the sitting room, and opened his mouth to say something, but his phone rang and cut him off. John moved to sit on the couch with his laptop while Sherlock checked his phone.
He leaned out the door and watched her brave wind, her scarf wrapped around her mouth and nose. Then he leaned back in and pulled the door shut. Molly and Emily were behind him, pulling on their coats and gloves. Oliver and Mrs Hudson stood at the bottom of the stairs to see them off.
John shifted in his seat, feeling awkward. “Ah, I actually have something rather serious I need to tell you all about.”
“You have to let me help you when this happens,” John said. He gestured to Oliver, “I’m not going to force you to take meds, but you have to tell me when you have an attack, and if they only get increasingly worse, we might have to find another solution than quitting altogether.”
John huffed and turned away from Sherlock, rubbing his palms into his eyes. He hoped their shouting didn’t wake Oliver. He turned back to Sherlock, whose eyebrows were drawn and mouth twisted into a frown.
John nodded. Oliver looked up the steps and nodded too. “I want to punch him,” he said, then started walking.
A week later, John still hadn’t the chance to talk to Oliver about changing schools. Oliver had been busy with schoolwork and his club, and John had to take extra shifts at the surgery after one of the other doctors fell ill. He was always exhausted when he got home late at night, and Oliver usually fled the house too quick to a get a conversation in in the mornings.
Oliver’s door slammed shut and John stood, grabbing his cane. He limped through the kitchen and the hall, then listened to hear Oliver trying to take deep breathes, but it sounded like he was shaking too much. John rapped his knuckles against the door a few times.
John groggily filled the kettle with water and put it on the stove, trying not to fall asleep standing up. Somehow he broke his streak of restless nights and managed to get six or so hours but still felt like walking death. He reached for the tea, then decided he needed something stronger and scooped instant coffee into his cup instead. It tasted like garbage but they didn’t have anything else for coffee at the moment. God, he actually woke up earlier than this for literal
So, not super happy with this chapter. There's probably mistakes because I only had time to skim-edit it. But oh boy. This is where everything really STARTS. Also... yikes. You guys may
Oliver didn’t come out of his room for over an hour, and when he did he slouched on the sofa, the notebook from a few days ago on his lap. He sniffed and tapped his pencil against the cover a few times. His headphones were around his neck, so John took that as a sign that Oliver would listen if he spoke.
“We’ll gladly sign the papers,” Sigar told him. “It will mostly be a private affair, and done quicker than a normal adoption would happen.”
He ran towards the body on the pavement, but everything jolted and he was too far away and his feet wouldn’t move. The pavement turned to tar and he desperately dragged forward as it slowly crept up to his thighs, then waist. John called to the limp body on the pavement, but the tar still crept up his body. Then the form on the pavement moved, and John was there, leaning over the black coat and dark curly hair. His tears fell onto the sidewalk, but they were red and he flipped to body over to look at his face, but it was Oliver’s face that stared lifelessly back at him.
The next day, before Oliver came home from his club, John called Mycroft first. He planned on calling Mr and Mrs Holmes after, because of course the matter needed to be discussed with them, but first he wanted to ask Mycroft how hard it would be.
Oliver’s eyes were wide and red from crying. He sniffed again and nodded, then leaned his forehead back onto John’s shoulder. His voice cracked when he mumbled, “I wanna go home.”
Oliver,” breathed John. He reached out and yanked Oliver forward, crushing him into a hug. Oliver gasped, his body stiff, before relaxing and slowly hugging John back, burying his face in John’s chest.
Oliver slammed the front door shut and yanked his phone out of his pocket, dialing Caden. If he called Emily, she would tell him to go home, but he knew Caden would listen to him and he just needed someone to vent to. John was being unfair, Oliver couldn’t believe he sided with Sherlock.
He was just… tired. But Sherlock sat across from him, fidgeting like he’d never done before, his eyes flicking around the kitchen, looking like he didn’t want to start talking again.
, I know it’s important, but he’s safe here,” Sherlock said. “Don’t you want to find out who did this?”
“Two years now,” John said. He put his elbow back on the table and leaned his cheek into his palm. “He moved in four-ish months after - after you…” He didn’t know what to call it.
Towards nightfall, after John had taken Oliver to the shops to pick of meals for the week, Oliver stepped into the living room, bouncing on the balls of his feet and fidgeting with his curls.
John jolted awake in the middle of the night and whipped around to look at Oliver in the other bed. The boy was sitting upright with his hand twisted in his shirt above his heart and his breathing came hard and fast and his skin glinted with sweat, while he looked around with panicked eyes. John threw off his blanket and stepped over to Oliver’s bed, putting his hand on the boy’s shoulder and shaking him a little.
Sherlock wasn’t back home until late in the evening. John heard his feet heavy on the stairs and when the door opened he looked worn out. He lifted his head to meet John’s eyes and John felt an odd sensation jolt through his heart, so he looked away.
John considered this, but he couldn’t remember if Emily and Oliver had gotten along at the New Years party. Oliver didn’t have any friends, other than the few “acquaintances” he called them, from his astronomy club, so maybe this would be a good chance for him to make a friend? It was worth a shot.
Caden chuckled. “For people who are supposed to be damn smart, I’m surprised they didn’t notice at all before now.”
The ambulance arrived fast, and Oliver was taken by the paramedics. For the second time in two weeks, John had to watch his son, bloody and unconscious, be loaded into the back of an ambulance and driven away.
John shrugged, “Sort of, but nothing has been happening. I do the same thing everyday, it’s driving me insane.”
Molly sighed on the other end of the line. “I am. Really, don’t worry too much. I’ve been back in London for months now, and working is helping keep my mind off things.”
Oliver felt Emily's hand on his, but he didn't turn to look. He opened his palm, letting their fingers fit together, and squeezed. He wanted to cry. Oliver wanted to cry so bad, because everything hurt but the stab wound was the least of it.
John ended up having to go through four different teachers and almost got passed to a fifth when he caved and mentioned Mycroft being Oliver’s uncle. That tidbit felt awkward to slip into the conversation, but he told them Mycroft had been in charge of transferring Oliver into the school. That got him handed off to someone higher up in the chain that would actually help him out.
Oliver’s fingers loosened slightly on his coat, while his sobs slowly turned into hiccuping breaths. He pulled his face away from John’s shoulder and sniffed, bringing his wet sleeve up to rub across his nose. John brushed Oliver’s hair out of his face and lifted his chin up.
, and glanced at Sherlock (who was busy fidgeting with his phone again). He almost pointed out that Oliver had spent most of the day with his friends yesterday, but John knew that being alone in the flat with Sherlock and Oliver all day would be worse. So, feeling a bit like he had just been manipulated into it, said, “All right.”
heavy themes in this chapter. There are some potentially triggering topics, so please read with caution.
Mycroft sat in the desk chair with his phone and Oliver sat on the couch. John brought the three of them hot tea and Oliver’s shivering went down after drinking some of it. He dropped Oliver’s phone, which the boy left in the park, onto the coffee table and sat down next to him on the couch.
John knelt on the floor in front of Oliver, pulling his hands away from the edge of the sofa so he didn’t hurt is casted wrist.
A loud knock on the door sounded and John hustled down the stairs, then pulled the door open. Mycroft stood with a rather neutral face, his hand on Oliver’s shoulder - John had a flashing memory of the first time they met. Oliver’s hair was frizzy and sticking up and he had his head tilted down in embarrassment, his hands in his hoodie pockets.
“I was captured close to the time I was trying to come home,” Sherlock said. “I blocked a hit from a crowbar. It still hurts sometimes.”
John stepped into the large guestroom, which had complete furniture in soothing tans and greens with an ensuite bathroom. John dropped his bag onto the bed and Oliver walked across the room to open the drapes and windows.
“Art heist?” John asks, jogging down the stairs after Sherlock. “That’s not your usual murder, bloody corpses, nightmare stuff.”
The sketchbooks lies half-tucked under Sherlock’s pillow. John doesn’t know if it’s deliberate, half-hiding it, or if it’s accidentally burrowed its way under there but either way, he feels a pang of guilt as he picks it up.
, he reprimands himself now before stepping into Sherlock’s room. The space is familiar – bed unmade but at least it’s been slept in, windows open with the cold April breeze filtering through the long curtains, Sherlock’s robe lying haphazardly on the floor along with a few odd shoes. One of Rosie’s toys – a plush octopus – is abandoned on Sherlock’s dresser alongside the photo of him, Mycroft, John, and Rosie from Christmas. Mrs Holmes had strong-armed them into wearing matching Christmas jumpers with glowing noses. John had found it amusing rather than embarrassing, especially when it had found its way onto the family Christmas thank you cards.
Sherlock laughed, which unfortunately brought on a round of rather painful coughing which literally made him stop in his tracks. John helped by supporting him until the coughing finally subsided. "Take a deep breath," he ordered.
John pushed him carefully towards the bathroom, guiding him with his hands on his hips. "Get your mind out of the gutter, Sherlock Holmes."
A particularly deep thrust that reached Sherlock’s prostate was all it took for him to fall apart in John’s arms. His mouth opened wide and he groaned softly as his body went limp from the release.
This wasn't possible; Sherlock was dead. He couldn't be here. But as John looked up he spotted the detective standing in the middle of their living room. He was wearing his purple shirt underneath his suit jacket and his long Belstaff coat with his blue scarf wrapped around his neck. The familiar sight snapped John into action.
"Is he alright?" Lestrade asked, though it was obvious that Sherlock was most definitely not alright. But John couldn't blame him for the question.
He quickly ate his breakfast and took some Paracetamol for his headache but before he stepped out of the flat he heard his phone go off. He took it out of his pocket and looked down at the screen. Lestrade. He had seen the state John was in last night, no wonder he was calling. He accepted the call and held the phone to his ear as he stepped out of the flat and locked the door behind him.
Before he could move any further John put his hand on his chest, stopping him in his tracks. "Sherlock, tell me you're not going to do anything stupid."
John's resolve wavered slightly at the invitation. He didn't want to leave Sherlock by himself but he really could use a couple of hours to freshen up.
It was thoughts like these that made John realize how special Sherlock was, and how special John must be to him. He had been surprised when Sherlock had first told him he loved him because he never thought Sherlock would admit it to anyone, much less himself, but John had not hesitated to return the sentiment. What was love if not sacrifice, forgiveness and devotion? And hadn't Sherlock sacrificed himself? Hadn't John forgiven him? Hadn't they devoted their lives to one another?
Sherlock only hummed in response, too tired to reply properly. John tried to fight sleep for as long as he could, worried that Sherlock’s migraine would worsen again and he would be left alone to fight through it, but sleep won out in the end.
“Morning,” John mumbled, turning his head to look at Sherlock who was carrying a tray of food. “Two mornings in a row,” he exclaimed, “I must be sick.”
“Well, I have to keep things interesting, don’t I?” John teased. When Sherlock didn’t react he started getting worried. “Is everything alright, Sherlock? You’re asking weird questions and you’re strangely quiet.”
“It’s exactly the same as in my dream.” John closed his eyes and let the sensation of Sherlock all around him wash over him. “How did you know?”
"You saved that boy," John replied, the ghost of a smile on his face. That is until Sherlock tried to sit up and gasped in pain. His hands came up to his chest and his eyes widened in shock. He looked over at John, panic written on his expression, as he tried, and failed, to take in a deep breath. "Sherlock!" John shouted, "Sherlock, what's wrong?"
John snapped his head up instantly and looked up in expectation, hoping to see Sherlock with his eyes finally open, only to realize that the consulting detective was still asleep. John himself had fallen asleep by his bedside, hand gripping Sherlock's, head resting on his arm which was sprawled on Sherlock's bed. He twisted his head around until he saw Lestrade looming over him with a sad look in his eyes.
Sherlock quickly slipped out of them and threw them on the floor. "I don't know what you're talking about, John," he said innocently.
When John had left the flat not half an hour ago Sherlock had been sitting at the kitchen table doing one of his many experiments. Now, however, he was lying down stretched across the sofa with his head buried in a pillow.
He couldn't deny that over the year and a half he had spent living with John they had each come to rely on each other which made him feel even guiltier about his actions, regardless of their necessity. But he was back now and he was going to make amends. No matter how hard he found it was to talk about his feelings he knew he had to. He had to explain to John why he jumped off that rooftop, why he couldn't come until now and why he had finally chosen to return, but that conversation could wait until tomorrow.
“John? John, where are you?” he asked, until his eyes fell on John, still very much on top of him, and with an amused expression on his face. “You’re here, you’re okay. You are okay, aren’t you? How’s your head?”
Sherlock was gasping and writhing beneath him, his breathing was fast, his heartbeat manic and he no longer seemed to have the ability to keep his eyes open. He had his head thrown back on the pillow and was holding onto the headboard, his knuckles whitening under the pressure.
They shared a knowing look across the table, clearly remembering quite a few times when Sherlock was more than happy with John’s surprises.
"But John," Sherlock whined, "I'm bored, and my concussion is fully healed. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to work."
Sherlock took a deep breath, steadying his nerves and telling himself once again that John was fine. “I couldn’t wake you up. You were asleep, and I couldn’t wake you up. I had to wake you up, John. I had to.”
Images of Sherlock on the rooftop surfaced in his mind and he shut his eyes tightly. He ran a hand over his face and opened them again. Finding that the image that greeted him was that of his own opened door and not his friend's pale and lifeless body on the floor he made his way to the kitchen and took out a bottle of whisky he had put away for a special occasion. He didn't relish the idea of drinking alone tonight but Lestrade was busy and no one else would understand what today meant, or what it was doing to him.
"What was that all about, huh?" he asked gently. He knew it would be hard to get Sherlock to talk, but every moment that passed he was more convinced he absolutely had to. "That wasn't a normal nightmare, Sherlock, what's going on with you?"
Though not unheard of the silence in the room was making Sherlock uneasy and he was about to say something before John turned around. His jaw was set and his expression was serious. He looked Sherlock straight in the eye and spoke.
He should do something. He was a doctor, he could help, but his limbs wouldn't obey him. He couldn't move, he couldn't breathe, he couldn't think. All he could see was the image of Sherlock's lifeless body in front of St. Bart's. But this time there was no well thought out plan and no escape, it was all real. Sherlock had raced forwards and John had been unable to do anything but stand back and watch as he risked his own life for a chance to save the boy's, and now he might not make it.
“Heat. I remember heat. And,” he paused for a few seconds, trying to organise his thoughts, “there was something… warm. And soft. I haven’t the faintest idea what it was though. After that I just remember being moved to the ambulance.”
John matched his grin, and instead of replying pushed Sherlock down on the bed and crawled on top of him. He went straight for Sherlock’s trousers, unbuttoning them painfully slowly before sliding them off the detective’s legs.
John placed the mugs on the side and went over to Sherlock. It would probably be a bad idea to touch him, but he had no other choice; John needed to wake him up. He put both his hands on Sherlock's cheeks, trying to be as gentle as possible, and started calling his name out.
When he heard his phone go off he jumped out of the sofa in anticipation, hoping it was Lestrade calling about a case.
But Sherlock didn’t do anything. He simply sat on John’s lap looking down at him. As the moments passed Sherlock’s grin turned into a soft smile that had John wondering what exactly was going on in his husband’s head.
When they finally arrived Sherlock quickly got out of the cab, leaving John to pay, as usual. He walked over to Lestrade who was smiling widely at the oncoming detective, and from behind John smirked. He’d warned Lestrade not to say anything- or at least try to not make it too obvious- but he knew there was no point. If Lestrade wanted to say something he would, and Sherlock probably wouldn’t like it very much, but he’d just have to deal with it.
“Then you can see how worried he's been. You can't just pretend you're okay because you know he can see right through it, and trying to figure out what's wrong without you telling him is going to be exhausting. So for once in your life, Sherlock, swallow your pride and let the people that care about you help."
The petty thief they had been chasing through the backstreets of London for the past ten minutes was finally starting to slow down, leading Sherlock and John to close the distance between them further. John could tell the thief was becoming winded. Even at this distance he could hear the harsh panting and it was clear that, sooner or later, he was going to have to stop.
His instant acceptance of John's departure showed how tired he really was, and John hoped he would be as accepting of his own needs once they were at home, which would hopefully be very soon. He hated seeing Sherlock lying in a hospital bed connected to all these tubes and machines. He just wanted to take him home and drink tea all day whilst lying in bed or watching crap telly. He just wanted to hold Sherlock in his arms.
Lauren nodded towards Matt, and after they had swapped places she printed off a strip of paper from the machine. “His heart is holding up for the moment. What’s his GCS, John?”
The detective laid his head on the pillow and smiled encouragingly at John. It wasn't the first time for either of them, but it was their first time together. It was clear that they were both a little nervous, but what was important was that they both felt comfortable.
"I..." John stuttered, "I missed you so much." He felt himself taking slow steps forward until he reached Sherlock. All the while his mind was shouting at him,
He allowed himself to be comforted by John. His presence. His arms. His strength. He could always count on John to be there when he needed him, whether he knew it himself or not.
John put his medical kit away and went to the kitchen to fetch Sherlock's medication. He put them on the table along with a glass of water and Sherlock gulped both down straight away.
No longer being able to restrain themselves they each wrapped their arms around the other as they progressed to the bathroom. The battle for control was evident in the intensity of their kisses. Their tongues entwined and fighting for dominance until they finally stumbled into the bathroom. They managed to get into the shower and turn the tap on without suffering any major injuries, though a few choice words were uttered as the boiling hot water hit Sherlock's exposed back. After John regulated the temperature the two settled into the pretence of a shower and John concluded, once again, that this was definitely his favourite method of distracting Sherlock.
Sherlock sprawled across John’s body, barely conscious, struggling for breath, clutching at John’s jumper. He tried to forget that the paramedics had to pry Sherlock’s hands off of John so they could treat him. Or how Sherlock had only truly calmed down as John held his hand in the ambulance. Or how relieved John had been that Sherlock had made it through relatively unscathed.
John just continued gaping, he couldn't believe Sherlock had sacrificed himself for them, for his friend. John knew that he cared for them, but he never knew how far he was willing to go to protect them. "So you jumped to protect us." He felt Sherlock nod against him and continued. "But you survived... how did you survive, Sherlock? I saw you jump, I saw your blood on the pavement, I took your pulse. You didn't have one!" he yelled.
There was something soft and warm pressed against him. He held on to it tightly, trying to ground himself, but he couldn’t discern what it was. Everything was fuzzy and the pain in his head only made it all the more difficult to understand what was going on.
Apart from the quiet sounds the detective was emitting a comfortable silence had settled in the room once again, which set Sherlock's mind whirling. If anyone had ever told him that he would be satisfied with spending the day in bed being cuddled by his partner he would have rolled his eyes and stalked off. It seemed many things had changed since John Watson had walked into his life, even more so after they finally admitted their feelings for each other, something Sherlock was still not quite sure how he had managed. He had never been an insecure person, but he always found sentiment extremely tedious to deal with, but John had changed even that.
John rubbed his hand up and down Sherlock's arm carefully so as to not aggravate his injuries. "You really need to get some rest now, Sherlock. The quicker you recover the quicker we can go home. Do you need anything?"
A single word broke through John’s subconscious and his body reacted as it always did, whether he was awake or asleep; he obeyed.
"Because you love it," Sherlock replied as he raised himself up from the bed and stole a kiss from John's lips.
In these small moments Sherlock allowed himself to slip away from his own mind, clearing it of all thoughts and just concentrating on the warmth of John’s hand against his skin. The small contact was enough to propel him to finally answer the question.
The sensation was overwhelming, just on the verge of too much. John had to very vehemently stop himself from coming. “If you want this to last more than a few seconds I would advise you not to do that again,” he warned breathily.
Sherlock cleared his throat. "Yes, it may have taken me a little longer than usual to perfect the dish, but I finally did. Shall we eat?"
"I don't know, but I'm worried he’s still unconscious," John replied, "Be careful, don't move him." He grabbed Sherlock's coat and splayed it across him. "Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?"  John called out. He needed to know Sherlock was going to be okay; he needed to hear his voice. "Sherlock, please, tell me you can hear me!" He sounded desperate even to his own ears, which wouldn’t help Sherlock so he took a moment to take in a lungful of air and try to calm himself down. Sherlock needed him calm and collected.
There was an infinite amount of things he loved doing with John, and there was an infinite amount of things he loved that John did to him, but this had to be one of his absolute favourites. John’s touch always seemed to awaken something within him. Some great urge and need to feel loved and warm and protected, and John always delivered.
“We’ll take it slow,” John assured him as he carefully slipped his finger out for a second and then back in again.
Sherlock set the tablets and a glass of water down on the kitchen table in front of John who took them willingly. “I’m perfectly capable of heating up some food, John.”
It was then that he heard the heart monitor speed up slightly. John's ears caught the miniscule shift in pace straight away and he looked towards Sherlock. He grabbed hold on his hand and softly called out his name.
Eventually Sherlock pulled John away and motioned for him to stand up. “I have something to show you, come on.” He walked them all the way to the bathroom where the tub had been filled with water and even some bubbles.
After that John had become sullen and quiet, sitting motionless by Sherlock's bed day and night, occasionally dozing off, only to wake up in a panic that something had happened to Sherlock while he was asleep.
The detective dropped a quick kiss on top of John’s head and started stroking John’s back slowly. “Get some sleep. I’ll wake you up in a couple of hours.”
“Just hmm, just a little something I bought for you.” John stood up and retrieved a large rectangular box from his chair and handed it over to Sherlock who was standing there looking stunned at the offering. “Sherlock?”
John leaned over Sherlock and kissed him softly on the lips. "It's what I'm here for. Would you like some tea?"
"It's Sherlock," he said, running a hand over his face and taking a deep breath, "we had a bit of an argument and he left. I should go after him."
Everything they fought for, all the time they waited to be reunited was nothing but a distant memory now and all he could think about was the fact that he might never see life in Sherlock's eyes again. Might never feel the warmth of his lips on his, his hand held in his own. He might lose him all over again.
Sherlock shifted under him and John started stroking his fingers softly from his cheekbone down to his jaw, over and over again, trying to sooth him back to sleep before he fully woke up. Even though Sherlock rarely showed it John could tell when he needed sleep, desperately, and today was one of those days. Any other time Sherlock would be up before John, making tea or breakfast or just laying languidly across the sofa. Today, however, Sherlock was still out to the world. John felt himself dozing off again, the quiet and stillness dragging him under and he didn't fight it. He didn't want to move and wake Sherlock up, and there wasn't much else he could do.
“He’s a teenager,” John said, staring out the doorway Oliver had disappeared though. “It’s a striking resemblance.”
A moblie of the solar system hung over the cluttered desk, paper stacks and books and pencils all over it. The bedspread was a dark lavender and neatly made. The wardrobe built into the wall hung open, and a mirror shone from inside the mostly barren area. Near the window a few pictures were hung up and John stepped forward to look closer. Oliver as a tiny baby, his dark hair just starting to curl and his eyes too big. One of Violet holding Oliver as a toddler in a garden - the baby reaching out towards a purple flower. An older Oliver, around ten or eleven, hanging from a tree by his knees, a huge grin on his face.
Oliver lounged on his bed, his door shut. Sherlock was out in the living room and John would be coming home from work soon. He didn’t really like being home with Sherlock all day because it felt so weird, and they didn’t talk, so he stayed in his room.
She set a plastic bag of groceries on the table, and pulled out a carton of eggs and package of bacon. “You’re fridge is empty, and I figured you’d enjoy a good breakfast since you have company now.”
Anxiousness flitted around in his chest the rest of the time, and kept checking the tracker just incase, but it barely moved the whole hour.
Oliver came home a little after eight, his cheeks and nose bright from the cold but a smile graced his face and he walked in already chatting. “One of the boy’s had a really nice, expensive telescope his father bought him so we took turns on that and we could zoom in enough to see details on the moon and it was extraordinarily pretty.”
They weren’t staying the night, because Violet and Sigar had a plane to catch headed for Paris at dawn. After a few minutes of exchanging hushed words, not to wake Oliver, Violet pulled John into a hug and Sigar shook his hand in farewell.
Harry, being his sister, knew it was a lie but also knew it meant he didn’t want to talk about it. She took a sip of her drink and nodded. “Sometimes that’s good, yeah? When does Ollie start school?”
Oliver snorted and shook his head. Caden looked desperate, and sounded sincere. Oliver believed him, and hoped it was the right thing to do. “Okay,” Oliver said. “I forgive you, but I’m done taking those pills.”
okay but seriously I'm going to make an effort to get back into weekly updates, because this story is almost over and it's the longest thing i've ever written. i just have had writer's block with the last couple of chapters (i write ahead by two or three chapters)
Sherlock came home on Wednesday night. Oliver had gone to his guitar lessons, and was going out with his friends after, so John was alone that evening. Oliver was looking a little less tired, and seemed happy to get out of the flat. John checked the tracker on his phone a few times, and it showed Oliver at Molly’s house, where Emily had been staying.
“How do you feel about it?” Caden asked. Oliver looked at him, sitting on the bed with his lip caught between his teeth and a weird jolt of electricity shot through Oliver’s stomach. He looked away.
after every news outlet ever blew up when he commit suicide two years ago. It’s like looking at a ghost.”
The second day Oliver was in the hospital, he decided he hated hospitals. He'd mostly slept through the first day, but was in too much pain to do so today. He'd never really been to a hospital before - that he can remember anyways. When he was younger, all of his doctors had been personally hired to come right to the estate. He'd never really gotten sick and anytime he was hurt it could be taken care of at home or at a private clinic. The smell of bleach, and sickness and the sounds of crying families, babies, and beeping drove him nuts. He hated hospitals.
to update this week. Can you believe that? Whoops. Wow finals are taking a lot out of me... I didn't have time to edit this thoroughly, so if there are any blatant errors PLEASE point them out, and I will fix them.
“Why are you so upset about this?” John argued. “This new school would be safer and you wouldn’t have to worry about those boys!”
Oliver was already dressed by the time John woke up and limped into the living room. The boy had sat in John’s armchair, his legs curled up onto the cushion while he leaned over a notebook in his lap. His dark curls hung past his cheeks, obscuring most of his face and the light that filtered through the curtain shone off the maroon tint to his hair.
John stepped around the table and pressed his wrist to Oliver’s forehead. “You’re warm. Here, drink some water.”
The tip off was a bust, and the lead turned out to be a cold trail that lead to nothing. John and Sherlock are disappointed and on edge, sitting in the back of a cab on the way home after getting into a fight. They had been out the whole day, chasing the lead that turned out to be a dead end, and now the sun was setting and night was drawing in. The day had passed so quickly, John lost track of the time and never even got a chance to call Oliver or check in on him.
John chewed the inside of his cheek. Panic attacks were an absolute bitch to deal with on your own, but if Oliver didn’t want his help he felt like he couldn’t intrude. He waited for a moment to see if Oliver changed his mind, and listened as the boy’s breaths seemed to even out and go quiet.
“All right, just text me when you’re there.” John wrapped an arm around his sister for a hug and led her to the door after she said goodbye to the others.
John made a noise of approval. “Listen, I’m having a few people over for New Year’s Eve, and I’d be overjoyed if you’d come.”
Oliver’s been with John for over a year, and his fifteenth birthday approached faster than John had time to prepare for. He had an idea a while back, to maybe get Oliver guitar lessons. He listened to music so often, he definitely pretended to play an imaginary guitar before and John didn’t think he knew how to play anything. It might be another way for him to make friends, too.
John reached around Mrs Hudson, pulled the kettle off the stove and took three mugs out of the cabinet.
They sat across from each other, in the armchairs. Oliver had his legs crossed and up on the cushion, his rubik’s cube in his lap. “Um…” he looked hesitant, reaching up to twist his hair between two fingers.
He could remember meeting her on New Year's Eve, almost two years ago now. He had hated her instantly. Oliver wished he could go back to those few months before he met Caden, when Emily and him were actually friends - even though they liked to pretend they couldn't stand each other. But it would never go back to that. Too much had changed and everything was ruined, and it was all his fault.
John looked out the window and tapped his lower lip with a finger. He didn’t even know if he’d be allowed back there, after leaving the way he left. “I could… I’ll call and see if they are hiring again.”
Turning his head, he watched Emily walk in and shut his eyes, willing himself not to cry. She was one of the last people he wanted to see. He didn't want her, or her anger, or her pity. He could remember calling her in the middle of all that pain, but not much else. Just sounds, a heavy pressure on his numbing stomach, flashing lights and someone sobbing. A brief moment of wavering consciousness where he could see Emily leaning over him, yelling something while tears dripped off her face.
“They weren’t, though,” Oliver confessed, his voice desperate. “It makes it hard to sleep, and I can’t concentrate after I take them. Sometimes they give me bad headaches, too.”
The rest of the time Mycroft tried to get Oliver to engage in conversation, the boy didn’t care; bouncing his knee and giving short answers instead. Eventually, the men gave up and Mycroft decided they should leave. John offered his hand again, not looking at his face and Oliver shook it, then put his headphones back on and left the flat in a hurry.
“Ah - I can’t say he is,” John said. “I think he’s still having a bit of trouble with making friends.”
“Here,” John stood and walked over to the bookshelf, shuffled some things around until he found what he was looking for. Then he walked back to Oliver, sat down and handed him the object.
John nodded, turned to look at his laptop screen again. “Next time, if - if you need anything? What should I-”
Sherlock put his hand on John's arm “John. I - I have a feeling this… whole thing is related to whoever is spying on us and that organization. They’ve been targeting Oliver from the start, remember?” He paused, looking at the floor. “This is my fault.”
Bad day, then. John gave him some time to cool down and started making dinner. When he did call Oliver out of his room, the boy seemed to have calmed down a bit, and sat at the table with John, pushing his food around on his plate.
he was having issues, then we caught him and,” John’s voice cracked and he looked at the floor. “And we just left him here,
Oliver stayed crouched on the floor, his ears turning red. He turned away and mumbled something, his arms wrapped around his legs again.
