John fits inside Sherlock like he was meant to be there. He sucks on Sherlock’s fingers, laving between them with his tongue, and fucks him slow, their eyes locked together.
like a simple person, and he used that to his advantage, allowed people to believe that about him. Very damn few people ever got a glimpse of the seething, difficult man that lay beneath all that.
John sagged against Sherlock’s side, and allowed Sherlock to stroke his arm, his hair, his face. He didn’t say anything else, and they lay that way for what felt like forever, and not long enough. There didn’t seem to be any urgency on John’s part to hear Sherlock’s explanation, and Sherlock didn’t want to overwhelm him by just spilling out every detail. John sighed occasionally, made quiet humming noises, his fingertips lazily tracing figure eights on Sherlock’s thigh.
At the time, he truly believed there was no choice. Later though... He could have, in some small way, shown him. Given him a a sign that he was alive, before John spiralled down. He didn’t though, he hadn’t, and John's breakdown was all his fault. Now he didn't care about small secret signals. He had to get to John, as quickly as possible. He had to fix this, what was wrong with John, or it would kill them both.
No time for that yet. John pulls back and brushes Sherlock’s hair from his forehead. “Alright, gorgeous. Tell me what we have to do.”
He doesn’t even move from the floor for nearly an hour after Mycroft’s head disappears, leaving behind a cold grate filled with ashes, and an empty ache in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach. After twenty minutes or so, Alchemy comes skittering down the hallway, sensing Sherlock’s distress, and leaps deftly onto his shoulder, curls up, and paws comfortingly at Sherlock’s neck.
"Murder, generally. Or sex. We talk about sex quite a lot." Sherlock grinned at Mrs Hudson's predictably scandalised face.
He climbs through the barrel into the Hufflepuff Common Room and finds it bursting with people, at least two radios blaring music, and suffocatingly hot, with a fire roaring in the fireplace. Mike, Molly, and Rose are draped over squashy chairs in the corner by the doorway to the girls’ dormitory. Unable to deal with his questioning friends or the voices of fifty people talking, laughing, playing Gobstones and Exploding Snap, he sneaks along the far wall and escapes into the boys’ dorm hallway, and finally is able to shut himself in the silence of his bed.
He reaches between them and strokes Sherlock's throat with one finger for a moment, tugs at the top button of his shirt. Sherlock nods, without taking his tongue out of John's mouth. One button at a time, slow and fumbling because he's not looking, John gets Sherlock's entire shirt undone and begins to tug it off his shoulders. Sherlock sits up to help him, and their teeth clang together. Sherlock laughs around John's tongue, and there's no reason in the world that should make John want to cry, but it does. Tears well up and John lets them, laughing back, and kisses Sherlock's bottom lip, and pushes his shirt off.
John pushes up on one elbow and leans over Sherlock, presses his mouth to Sherlock's hard and chaste at the same time, like the way John had kissed his first girlfriend, like the way Sherlock had kissed him in the hospital in Bemidji. Leaving no room for interpretation of what it meant.
Sure enough, a small WSSH is etched lightly into the surface. A thrill races down Sherlock’s spine, overcome with a scent memory of vanilla tobacco and old leather. He hears John’s voice in his mind, rough and dusky - intimate -
The text came through, and John choked and swayed, his head going so light he almost passed out. He gripped the edges of Lester’s kitchen table until his knuckles were white, blood beginning to drip from his arm onto the floor.
“Oh. Um. My Potions essay.” Sherlock knows she won’t believe him, but it’s the first thing that comes to his mind.
"No but. I just want to make sure I address everything you said. I don't want to skip over anything." Sherlock reaches over to the side table and sets the little red notebook in his lap. "You said a lot of important things and..."
A shaft of lazy summer sunlight cutting a swath across a cluttered kitchen, Sherlock’s curls framing his face like a halo. The dust sifting through the light. A woman’s voice, familiar and comforting.
John laughs with his mouth open, blue eyes twinkling, and yanks the sheet down off Sherlock's arse. "Look at this perfect thing." He runs his hands over the rise of his cheeks, kneading a little, and then smacks the left one lightly. "Ooh, I like that. Got a nice resonance. Like a bongo."
This is the closest they’ll ever be, and it will be over before they’ve even had a moment to understand it. All those wasted years have never felt more oppressively idiotic. All those nights wondering what would happen if he just told him, rolling over in his cold bed holding a pillow to his chest and trying to pretend it was Sherlock. The eye contact that went on far longer than could be easily explained, the accidental touches that sent electricity singing through his nerve endings, the body language that was always
“We are idiots. Full stop.” John shakes his head and wipes at Sherlock’s tear stained cheeks with his fingertips.
“After you.” John gestured for Sherlock to go ahead of him, as was their custom on cases. Sherlock took front and centre, and John stood behind him, steadying and dependable and generally quiet.
“Fine.” He handed John the bowl of water and the shaving soap. John held them steady as Sherlock gently placed a knee on either side of John’s thighs and slowly lowered his weight onto his legs.
Sherlock strides away. Something hurts, something...about leaving this innocent little creature in the alley by himself.
Sherlock can feel each of John’s fingers individually, where the knuckles dig into his wrist bones, where the pads of his thumbs are soft and gently stroking the heels of Sherlock’s hands. It’s been a long time since his senses were this attuned. He’s been too frightened and exhausted and cold, too alone. Now they’re home, together, and John isn’t so broken anymore, and John is on top of him and breathing his toothpaste scented breath hot over Sherlock’s jaw,
“I don’t believe that for a minute.” She smiled again, and shut her notebook with a snap. “As far as I’m concerned, you lads are free to go. Go enjoy the rest of your holiday.”
“John.” He spins around, looking much more himself than he’s been in days, no longer bedraggled and exhausted, and emerging from his subspace as well.
"Sherlock, oh god," John's done this to himself, to other people, but seeing Sherlock, red faced and open mouthed, watching as one long finger slides inside his body and then another, watching his skin stretch around his fingers, it's profanely beautiful. "Look at you, you're so - Christ I don't even have words."
"We are, I just." Sherlock's eyes are all over him, but slow and purposeful, inquisitive in that way that only Sherlock's eyes get.
Lester described him perfectly, down to woolen trousers and leather gloves. Down to the colour of his indescribable eyes. John had never mentioned a single word about Sherlock to Lester. He supposed Malvo probably knew about Sherlock, though he’d acted as if he hadn’t, but John was sure he’d not said anything to Lester.
“S’real nice car, mister. Kind of old, yeah, but runs good, not much mileage. Belonged to an old lady.” The salesman was as beige as the car lot he ran. Everything was beige here. The piles of half melted snow slipping lazily off of awnings and down gutters, the cracked sidewalks clotted with detritus, the people. The people were the most beige of all, no life in them at all.
“No. No. It’s alright. I can’t expect you to be positive all the time, too. One of us has to be the cynical disbelieving git. Keeps us grounded.” John smiles, and it reaches up into his eyes, creasing across his forehead. “Just. Promise me that we’re really in this together. Whatever happens.”
.” I hoped the invitation in my voice was obvious. To be certain, I allowed my dressing gown to slip slightly off my shoulder, knowing Watson’s affection for the paleness of my skin.
John doesn’t respond to that, but exhales in a relieved rush, looking at the screen. “My card worked. It’s all still there. Should I get it all out? While I still can?”
He realises with a start that he’s imagining a life. A future. He hasn’t thought about that in over a year, that he could have a long life. Him and John, grey bearded, sitting in matching armchairs, reading books and looking at each other affectionately over the tops of their half moon glasses.
John didn't reply; he'd already fallen back asleep. Sherlock ambled into the kitchen, trying to ignore the tent in his pyjama bottoms, and put on a pot of coffee, unable to think about anything but the sweet scrape of that beard on the tender inside of his thighs.
Sherlock finally pulls off, licking at John with a flat tongue until he quivers and pushes at Sherlock’s head. Too much. Over sensitive. He presses a kiss to his softening cock, to the swell of his perfect hipbone, to his belly, and slides up to kiss his lips. John isn’t hesitant at all, sucks Sherlock’s lower lip into his mouth, swirling his tongue around Sherlock’s, licking at him hungrily. He breathes out, "I’ve never tasted myself in anyone’s mouth.”
“I’m saying. I’m saying - I think I’ve changed, John. I think I no longer require the same things I once did to keep my mind occupied.”
“Would you like your gun, dear?” Sherlock grins, sly and proud, and slips something from his coat, slides it carefully across the red vinyl seat.
Sherlock comes in hours later, long after John's put the notebook aside.  He walks into the sitting room and takes a long look at John, chair turned to face the dying fire, then crosses the room and silently sets John's dog tags on the side table, the ball chain trickling through his fingers like beads of water.
"Oh god, this is -- oh." John breathes out, and comes, his stomach clenching, arse muscles spasming as he loses his rhythm and shakes and shakes. The tension of his arousal uncoiling and spiraling through him electric and fever hot. Sherlock's leg drops off his shoulder and Sherlock pulls him closer, bellies slick against each other.
John laughs, and it feel so good to laugh, because Christ the last half hour has been intense, and he kisses the side of Sherlock’s neck, and says, “Why would you think I do?”
He shouldn't be angry. He shouldn't feel rejected and unsure, not after all they've been through, after two weeks of hospital food and catheters and Sherlock helping him shower, for fucks sake. Sherlock hasn't done anything - anything - to deserve this anger. And yet. He can't make himself think of what was before the last two weeks.
“I’ve never been more so, John.” Which is the truth. He’s never wanted this with anyone but John, and he’s
John interrupts, "You were bashing your head against a fucking wall, Sherlock. You hadn't slept in two days. I was trying to protect you from yourself, for fuck's sake."
“I - I remember breakfast,” Sherlock says haltingly, trying to gather himself enough to come up with something convincing.
do not want to hurt you or take advantage or do something that makes you uncomfortable that I can’t take back. And, uh, I don’t think we’ve really even, um, scratched the surface of the whole - I never really explained to you about the prost -- well, you know.”
John laughs that beautiful full chuckle that he has, the deep laugh lines around his eyes crinkling. "No. Because Mrs Hudson loved us. And we loved her. But she's gone, and her niece didn't owe us anything. We were just tenants to her. Tenants who paid a quarter of what the flat is worth."
"Home." John's eyes fluttered closed, he rolled his bottom lip into his mouth and bit it. Like he was tasting the word. "I have no idea what that would feel like."
Lestrade’s eyes flick up from his phone, wide and thoughtful. Worried. He squints at John and then focuses on Sherlock. “It’s risky. If he’s as unpredictable as you say he is, Sherlock...we could be putting you in an incredible amount of danger very quickly. And you won’t have much backup. I need to think about this.”
John with the beard became almost a different person in Sherlock's mind than John without the beard. It seemed to Sherlock that he was more clever, funnier,
John chokes out a little sob that hits Sherlock hard, somewhere in the middle of his chest. John's eyes tight shut, one hand in his mouth, one fisted in the sheets next to his head, he looks on the verge of tears. His hand lands heavy on Sherlock’s head, smoothing over his hair, fingertips brushing the top of his ear. He can barely speak, whispers in a low husky voice, “
But they’re seventeen. Seventeen year olds don’t spy on their family and friends for Dark Wizards. They don’t do that. They’re thinking about what to do after graduation, about essays and memorising spells and Apparating without leaving a chunk of themselves behind. They’re worried about Quidditch and N.E.W.T’s, and finding places on the grounds to kiss where they won’t get caught. Sherlock’s cheeks redden at the memory of last night, John’s face so close, his eyes dark… No. No, he can’t think about that right now. It’s distracting.
There’s a flurry of movement, and the group of Americans is suddenly getting up, pushing back chairs and picking up bags. John freezes, and Sherlock kicks him lightly under the table, reminding him.
John laughed out loud, his eyes glittering deep ocean blue in the candlelight, his teeth glowing white against the ruddy beard. “You are so transparent, love. Well, that seals it. If joining a rugby league is going to get me shagged while you’re wearing my jersey, I’m in.”
“We will.” He almost believes it. He presses tiny apologies to John’s bare skin with his mouth, and John’s arms go so tight around his neck that he lifts himself up off the floor until he's on his tiptoes.
They stumble into the shower together and wash quickly, efficiently, drag themselves over to the sink and brush their teeth next to each other, all elbows and hips, grinning giddily at each other in the mirror with foam all over their chins. Sherlock can’t believe that six hours before, he was standing in Jim’s flat, terrified out of his mind and wondering if he’d ever see John again. It seems unreal.
Sherlock's relatively certain John doesn't give toss about bees, and just likes to hear the sound of Sherlock's voice, but that's okay, too, so he takes a deep breath and tells John a very little bit of what he actually knows about bees. Because the considerable depth and breadth of his interest in bees is rather staggering, even to himself.
"You have a place to sleep tonight, John?" It’s out of his mouth before he even realises what he’s saying, before he can think himself out of it.
Sherlock knows what John’s trying to say, knew in fact before he even began talking, but he wanted to give him the space to say it. Now he’s struggling, because he thinks Sherlock doesn’t feel the same way, because he’s worried this will ruin them. But Sherlock’s not afraid anymore. He knows what he wants, what he’s always wanted, and it’s right here in front of him.
“Couldn’t sleep last night.” Sherlock says dismissively, waving a hand in John’s direction and clearly wishing he’d said nothing.
well, John.” Sherlock grinned and slammed the car door shut, drew John close as they huddled under a shared umbrella and splashed across the lot to the restaurant.
The endearment is what pushes Sherlock over the precipice, as John knew it would. His thighs go rigid as he thrusts forward into John's fist and chokes out a ragged groan, pulsing out hot and perfect, spurting onto his own stomach, dripping down off John's still tensed fingers onto the sheets.
, I am,” Sherlock gasps, desperate for John to resume his explorations. Desperate for every inch of their skin to be touching. He tangles his fingers in John’s hair and drags him down, close enough to whisper hoarsely against his mouth, “I don’t want you to stop.”
It comes out harsher than he intended, and Sherlock’s mouth claps shut abruptly, a wounded look in his beautiful eyes. God, he is so beautiful. The number of nights John has lain awake thinking about those eyes, that little freckle in the right iris, the shape of Sherlock’s mouth, how one smooth cheekbone would feel sliding against his face, is innumerable. It’s been every night since the first one.
Sherlock knew John's relationship with his father had been fraught with tension, before John had cut him off. A childhood of incessant judgment and harsh discipline, often meted out with a belt or an unforgiving hand, made for an adversarial adult relationship. After John's mother had passed away, John and Harry had become completely estranged from him. Sherlock had only met him once, at a wedding for a distant cousin whom John had a particular affection for. He hadn't expected his father to be there. When he'd spotted him striding towards them, John had reached automatically for Sherlock's hand and gripped it tight. Anchoring himself.
John covers his own surging emotions by closing his mouth over the head of Sherlock's cock and shutting his eyes. He can feel Sherlock's back arching, feel his hip flexors tensing, as John takes more of him in.
Sherlock opens his mouth again, tongue poking into the corner, and the bridge of his nose wrinkles in thought. "Something is troubling you."
“You are.” John rubs his face back and forth against Sherlock’s belly, the ghost of soft morning stubble scratching pleasantly. He begins to kiss down lower, runs his hands flat against the outside of Sherlock’s thighs. “You’re mine. I’m yours. Start acting like it. You’re not alone, Sherlock, goddammit.”
This is the calmest he's ever felt in his life. Nothing before has ever felt so inevitable. So right.
He lifts his hips again, purposefully this time, and watches John watching him, his mouth still hovering hot over the crease of Sherlock’s thigh, his eyes round and dark with desire. The head of his cock smears wet across John’s cheek, and he groans, heart pounding, stomach clenching, his whole body thudding hot with need. John huffs a breath that ends in a moan, rubs a hand up the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, presses his leg down into the mattress, holding him there.
“Mmm.” John grunted, rolled to his side. “Sherlock, it’s 5:00 in the morning. Be a good boy and shut up.”
They lie there in silence, John’s mouth resting against Sherlock’s sweaty skin, Sherlock’s arm curled against John’s face. The sun warms the bottom of the bed, where their feet are twisted together.
Sherlock thought about it, what John would look like, and feel like, with a beard. How found, to his utter consternation, that he couldn't. "I don't know yet. Need data."
into the darkness of a candle lit room. He remembers soft skin and wet mouths, the thump of John’s heartbeat against his ear.
That first year, Sherlock tiny and thin, smaller than any other first years, pathetically clinging to Mycroft’s hand, had felt suddenly at ease, for the first time in his life. He still remembers the feeling of being surrounded by people that were
John enveloped Sherlock’s cock in the sweet intense heat of his mouth, licking hard at the vein on the underside and stroking him relentlessly slowly, keeping Sherlock hovering on the knife’s edge of the orgasm that was sitting tremulous and hot between his legs. Just as Sherlock was sure he couldn’t bear another second of this exquisite torture, John let Sherlock’s prick out of his mouth with a final dirty swipe of his tongue into the slit, and slipped his fingers out, gently caressing his perineum as he did so. Sherlock whined and pressed down into John’s touch, wanting so much more than this deliberate gentle pace. He wanted John to
"You're allowed to smile, Sherlock." John sips his coffee, feeling more at ease than he has in a very long time. He excels at this, clearing the Great Brain of clutter, focusing it on himself, on the transport, on being a good boy. It's focus for John, too, the world outside themselves falling away so easily. Nothing exists right now except Sherlock and John, in this moment together. There could be an apocalypse, and as long as Baker Street was still standing, John wouldn't notice.
"I'm sorry, John, I just - " Sherlock sucks in a breath as his knees go weak, his head spinning. John sucks bruisingly at his collarbone, and it hurts, hurts so badly that he moans and pulls at John's shirt, "That hurts. John, that hurts!"
I could keep going. I could write a book about you. An anthology. Dedicated to all the wondrous and strange things about you that make me go funny in the knees. Maybe I will one day. Maybe I will.
"Mmm hmm." John plants a firm kiss in the center of Sherlock's shoulder blades and rubs his nose up and down. "I really do."
against Sherlock’s stomach and rubs his fingertips slick against the stretched rim of Sherlock’s hole.
“Male.” John was clearly struggling to talk at this point, his voice muffled completely in Sherlock’s skin, his face pressed so hard into Sherlock’s throat that he was having trouble swallowing.
Sherlock shakes at the filthy pleasure that rolls down his spine. He’s never particularly liked dirty talk, or feeling submissive, used. But he realises as he kneels at John’s feet, inhaling the musky scent of his prick through the thin fabric, that he would supplicate himself to this man every day for the rest of his life if allowed to. There's a gentle affection lurking behind every word, making Sherlock feel dangerously vulnerable. He doesn't even know John's last name, and he's already ruined. He'll never not need this.
"So am I. It was a rough conversation. Might take him out tomorrow night again, if it's alright with you."
“Motherfucker.” He sprawled on his chest on the freezing ground and felt under the car for the keys. His hand brushed something that felt out of place, and he tilted his head to try and get a look at it. A small black box. A GPS trace. Someone was tracking him.
“Ah, no, we’re way past that part.” John’s stance relaxed, his shoulders loosening, the tension in his neck easing. “We’re already to the ignore-each-other-and-watch-telly-all-night part.”
Sherlock allows himself to be helped up, and John’s hand resettles in his, fitting their palms together. He looks up at Sherlock, wide-eyed. “This okay?"
“Yeah,” Sherlock gasps, and reaches down, pushes his fingers into John’s hair. He rubs his thumb along the outer curve of John’s ear - burning hot - and touches the square edge of his jaw. “Yeah, I want -”
By the time they gather their quills and parchments and head down to dinner, the sky is growing dark, the ragged black outline of the Forbidden Forest illuminated by the setting sun. They drop books and bags in the dormitory and then thunder into the Great Hall with the rest of the school. The cavernous room echoes with laughter and chatter, with the clinking of silverware against pottery.
John sucked his teeth, rubbed the knuckles of his right hand as he looked out into the morning fog laying thick over the cab stand. Fucking guy’s jaw was hard as concrete, for as pussy as he looked. Well. He’d definitely come off the worse, even though John’s hand would be sore for a day or so. Flabby would certainly think twice before provoking any short Englishmen again.
” Sherlock’s grip on his thigh tightens, the pressure of his fingers becoming almost painful as he writhes in John’s arms like a wild animal.
"Sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...No one's ever -- no one's ever let me do that before. I just..." John fades out as Sherlock's lips close over the head of his cock, tongue pressing into his frenulum. "Oh fuck, Sherlock, fuck oh god."
They lapse into silence, Sherlock’s arm going numb under the weight of John’s back, his neck stiff. Harry throws her legs up on the end of the bed, and hunches down in the chair, murmuring a little
Their eyes meet, and Sherlock breaks into a ragged laugh. He folds his arms behind his head, as if he’s about to take a nap, and shifts his hips under John’s chest. “Sorry. I just. This is - I haven’t really - much - and I never thought it would be you and me and I just - sometimes I forget how to breathe when I get - “
." John raised his head and smirked, his blue eyes twinkling affectionately, surrounded by laugh lines etched deep in his desire-blushed skin. His perfect pink lips twitched to the side in a crooked grin, and Sherlock was so seized by tenderness, by absolutely blinding love and fondness, his lungs felt too small to take in oxygen.
Sherlock sighed and breathed out through his mouth like he was exhaling smoke. He came into the kitchen, unhesitatingly reached for John's hand and pressed his thumb into the hollow of John's wrist. "That's
The elemental in John awakens when they're in the sub/dom space together. He is nothing but sensation, want, hunger. All he craves is the satisfaction of making Sherlock whine and plead, thrash and moan and
Sherlock drops his right arm down along John’s back and clasps one arse cheek, encouraging John to thrust against him. John buries his face in the sweat damp curve of Sherlock’s shoulder and shifts his hips in gloriously slow circles, the tension growing and spreading through his belly until he’s heavy with it, until his bones feel as though they’re liquefying.
My fault that happened. Jesus. Did anyone else..." It's gutting. He feels sick. The question he really wants to ask, if anyone else died because of his idiotic behaviour, he can't. Sherlock knows.
John falls silent and Sherlock slowly eats his toast. Just as Sherlock’s setting the plate aside and moving to get out of bed, they both hear footfalls on the steps.
“It’s just,” she murmurs, taking one long braid into her hands and smoothing it nervously over her shoulder, “You’re always alone, I mean, except for us, and. Well. I think he could be good for you, you know. Just, promise me you’ll think about it.”
Sherlock spins them so John’s the one against the wall, grasps his hips to steady him. “Then lets make the most of it, shall we?”
“Yeah.” John swallows, the bitter aftertaste of the whiskey on the back of his tongue. Malvo’s face flashes in front of him, that smug dirty smile, his overlarge teeth. “
Summoning all his internal control, he inhales deeply and tries to quell the rising panic in his stomach.
“Not really.” Sherlock can’t help a smile - Mike’s got the kind of laughter that’s contagious, and Sherlock
I turned blindly, feverishly seeking his mouth with mine, and felt our noses collide. His tongue slid hot between my arousal swollen lips as he finally took his fingers out of me and repositioned himself. I heard to clink of the petroleum tin again, and the sound of John slicking his cock. He gasped and jerked, biting into my lip.
That first text from Sherlock had very nearly been the last. It was mortifying enough that a third year medical student needed a tutor for sodding
. A shudder runs through him, looking at their reflections; Sherlock naked and collared, writhing in John's arms, John fully clothed and in control, his gaze steady as he looks back at himself. Sherlock's cock dark and primal, rutting against John's pale fingers. It's the most deliciously filthy thing he's ever seen.
Sherlock's smile turned tender and reached into his eyes. He set a hand on John's knee and squeezed. "Let's get you into some warm clothes and put on some tea."
John whimpered and returned the kiss fiercely, hands twining up into Sherlock’s hair. They licked and bit at each other, loss and grief and relief and frustration cresting between them. Like breaking the water’s surface after nearly drowning. Still kissing, tongues lapping at each other, Sherlock whispered
He very much wanted to open it. He was, in fact, directly on the verge of opening it, John's ridiculous sonic screwdriver letter opener poised at the junction of tape and brown paper, when John's startlingly angry voice sounded in his head.
"So you've told me many times. Yet you keep doing things like asking my opinions about cases," John slaps his other arse cheek, now in rhythm with the music, "And letting me handle all our money." Slap. "And allowing me to have my way with you on just about every surface in this flat." Slap. "And do whatever I want to this absolutely magnificent arse of yours." Slap. "So either I can't be too much of an idiot, or you're just as big of one as I am."
There’s a chord in his voice that is definitely an invitation. Sherlock turns and shimmies, tucks himself into John’s waiting arms. John’s fingertips stroke leisurely up and down his spine, pausing to trace over bumps of scar tissue. Whenever John reaches a scar, he makes an unhappy noise, inhales deeply. He keeps moving closer, closer, until their legs are completely entangled and Sherlock’s face is pressed tight against John’s scruffy warm throat. John’s thigh is hot between both of Sherlock’s. He flexes it, pushing up against Sherlock’s bollocks. Sherlock thinks it was maybe incidental, until he does it again.
An exuberant ferocity surges up in him, something he hasn't felt in a long time. A connection visceral and throbbing. A connection to himself, to the John Watson that was a good soldier, and a bloody brilliant doctor, and kept pace beside Sherlock Holmes in the London night, proud and fierce. It's tremulous, shivering, curling around his nerve endings and somersaulting through his chest.
They don’t say anything else the rest of the ride to Baker Street. Their bodies fit together like they were made to be this way, the curve of John’s hip nestling against the long line of Sherlock’s thigh, his hand cupped around Sherlock’s knee. Sherlock strokes up and down John’s bicep, absorbing the sound of John’s contented little sighs like he’s been a drowning man who’s just broken the surface into fresh air.
"Not very well, actually. Getting divorced. Nasty business. Let's not ever do that, m'kay?" John touched Sherlock's left hand, which was currently engaged untying John's right boot, and smiled, a touch of sadness marring his bright blue eyes.
The knowledge of this was making him completely insane. He obsessively glanced at the door every time someone walked down the hallway. He had no way to get in contact with the texter, no way to trace those numbers. He’d called Sherlock’s old mobile number, and of course it was disconnected. He’d called Mycroft, who didn’t answer. He didn’t dare call Greg or Molly or Mrs Hudson, they’d be too upset if he casually asked, “So, heard from Sherlock lately?”
“John - “ Sherlock gasps, reaching up to curl a hand round the back of John’s neck and pull him down. His entire body is pulsating, quivering. He wants John flat against him, smotheringly close, their bodies grinding together, sharing the same air.
“Why shouldn’t I be?” John spat out. Then he breathed in deeply, and chewed at his lip. His eyes drifted away from Sherlock and fixed on the whiteboard of scheduled medications on the wall opposite. He pulled his hand away from Sherlock’s and rested it on his stomach. “Actually, we need to have a conversation, before I lose my nerve. And I need a cigarette for it. Open the windows?”
John's shoulders are heaving. There's a pain in his ribs and his head is pounding. This is terrifying. It's like jumping out of a helicopter at the end of a frayed rope, with no parachute and nothing to land on except sand and fragile feet with lots of breakable little bones, which is something he's actually done and right now it seems like the significantly less intimidating option.
By the time the cab pulls up in front of Baker Street, John’s nearly asleep, breathing humid against Sherlock’s throat.
John shakes his head and surges up against Sherlock, grabbing his face between his hands and kissing him, their teeth clanging, and it isn't even a pleasant kiss. Instead it's exuberant and deep, and heartfelt, and it makes Sherlock's throat sore. John pulls back to pepper kisses down across Sherlock’s jaw, into the hollows of his neck, whispering, “I don’t, I don’t want it.”
Something heavy and warm leans against his back, and he nestles into it instinctively as he tugs the covers up round his shoulders.
“Well. Yeah.” John suddenly feels unaccountably defensive. Of course it’s bothering him. It would bother anyone who’s been in a relationship with someone for six months and been in love with them since the moment they met and has never
Sherlock laughed softly, closed his eyes and opened them again, looking up at John with the beginnings of a dark heat. He turned his face into John’s leg, in the hollow of tendon inside John’s knee, and rubbed his lips over the denim. “I am sorry I kept you waiting. I should have texted. It’s not too late, John? To do what we'd planned?”
case.” Sherlock spits at him, grinding his teeth, as coffee runs in dark rivulets down the wallpaper.
“That sounds terribly tragic, John.” Sherlock smirks, leans against the counter and sips his coffee.
“Cut it out, Sherlock. I’m not up for it right now. I’ve had barely five hours of sleep, and it’s Saturday. I want to sleep in a bit. Leave off.” John flipped on his stomach, doubtless trying to restrict access to all the parts Sherlock wanted to get at most, and gathered his pillow to his face.
without it anymore, that his love is written in his chromosomes, embedded in his cell structure. Sherlock would like that, probably. Instead he runs his hands hard over his own face, digs into his scalp with his fingernails. "All you've done for me over the last few years...how could I? I think you've got a free pass to be a complete dick for quite a long time before I'm permitted to get angry with you again."
Sherlock lights another cigarette, though he's running low and they're desperately expensive - almost £10 a pack now. He has to process, to divide and sort all that's happened in the last few days in his mind, parse it out so he can analyse it. He has to tell himself it's alright to be here, to watch the sun rising over the river, to breathe air that isn't stale and full of hospital smells. That it's alright to not be physically watching over John's tiny perfect beautiful miraculous body every single second. John is safe. John is with Harry. Sherlock needs a moment to sit and think. Needs to plan.
“You are positively edible.” Sherlock purrs, resting a hand over the swell of one perfectly muscled hip, pulling him closer. He feels like they’ll never be close enough, and he realises he’s already thinking beyond tonight, hoping this isn’t the first and last time.
“Mmm. Was. Not now.” Sherlock squirms closer, his nose pushing into the hollows of John’s throat, fingers exploring up under the ragged hem of John’s well worn tee shirt.
John laughs loud and long, and Sherlock joins in after a moment, and it feels so good to laugh together that soon tears are rolling down John's cheeks and Sherlock can't catch his breath. John wipes his eyes, still sputtering a little bit, and asks, "Did I deduce you correctly?"
“I'm not a little boy, I'm nineteen, you fucker. No, you said blow job. That’s what we agreed on. No!
“You like me with a gun.” John murmurs, rough, his belly fluttering at the memory of how that tongue felt on his overheated skin.
“Okay, okay --” He scrambles into the front seat without bothering to pull his trousers up, fumbles to put the keys in the ignition.
He whines, not meaning to, and John pulls off, nuzzles at Sherlock’s sweat damp skin, drags his moustache along the insides of his thighs.
The Buick was fast. John nearly drove it straight across the median strip pulling it out of the lot, as quickly as it responded when he depressed the gas pedal. Driving didn’t come naturally to him. He had to concentrate.
"Well," John murmurs, curving forward and tucking his nose into the juncture of bone and tender skin below Sherlock's jaw, "We can, um,
heard that sentiment returned. Any ordinary person, anyway. Of course, Sherlock’s never been ordinary. “It just seems like you go out of your way to not say it.”
John watched him with unrestrained affection, nodding and humming in agreement when Sherlock looked to him for a reaction, twirling a soft lock of Sherlock’s hair around his index finger. Underneath the exhilaration from a solved case was something else, a simmering nervousness, a jittery excitement, that John thought probably had something to do with the plan for tonight. He waited patiently for Sherlock to finish. John wasn’t the kind of man who rushed things.
“We have time.” If he leaves tomorrow, if this is the last night he has with John for who knows how long,
“You’re so good looking, and sexy, and...ENGLISH. You’re amazing in bed...I mean, you could get anybody. You don’t have to pay for it.” Embarrassment crept up on his face. He turned red and shifted his eyes away. Ridiculous, considering what they’d just done, to be embarrassed now.
around me, oh god." Sherlock sucks messily at John's earlobe, trailing spit that chills his neck in the moist cool night.
"Drink your tea, there you are." She nudges the cup at his mouth, and he automatically takes a sip, lukewarm and bitter, too much sugar in it. All the same, it's comforting. Familiar. Washes the bitter sourness out of his mouth.
Maddeningly slowly, John begins to move again, his back muscles undulating beautifully under Sherlock’s splayed out fingers. He kisses Sherlock’s throat, and mouth, and earlobes, rubs the welcome roughness of his moustache against Sherlock’s cheeks and nipples, and doesn’t speed up. Sherlock’s heels bounce loosely against John’s lower back as he stretches and writhes, exhaling slow and deep, allowing his entire body to flood with molten pleasure. His thighs are beginning to tremble.
Finally Harry stretched and yawned, and with reluctant sighs they moved apart, the intimacy interrupted. Harry gave them a knowing smirk, her eyes raccooned by smeared mascara, and patted John's leg.
Despite himself, he feels a surge of deepest fondness for all of this, for the chaos and the noise, for the familiar sight of the Hogwarts Express gleaming scarlet against the blackened brick. Everyone’s shouting at old friends, jostling each other as they say goodbye to their parents and siblings. It smells like clean laundry and coal smoke, pumpkin pasties and machine oil. A peculiar and singular mixture of scents that stir within him the memory of every September the first since he was eleven years old.
"I want to." Sherlock whispered, becoming more inarticulate as his primal needs superseded his intellect. He pushed John back gently by the shoulders until he was laying on the comforter, propped up on his elbows. Sherlock shimmied down until he was flat on his stomach, and then he reached out and parted the fabric at John's pelvis. His cock stood up crudely between the folds of tartan, hard and blood red, foreskin stretched back and glans shining wet. It was the most obscenely gorgeous thing Sherlock had ever seen. Sherlock rocked up on his knees, encircled the base with his hand, fingers drifting though cinnamon coloured curls and his thumb rubbing at the soft wrinkled skin under John's cock. John moaned and lifted his hips off the floor entreatingly, and Sherlock sank forward and swallowed him to the root.
Sherlock obediently holds his hands together at his navel, and John finds the cuffs where they've fallen next to the bed. He buckles them around Sherlock's wrists, tighter than before, and pushes his hands above his head. John’s own head is buzzing, very much like what he remembers getting stoned feels like. The longer they're in this scene, the more altered his state of consciousness becomes. Every skin cell on his body is tingling.
"If we're going to have sex, you're going to have to touch me, you know. You still okay with this, Sherlock?" John tries to sound gentle, though the heat is rising in him, with Sherlock's muscles jumping between his legs, his own bare skin laid out in front of Sherlock's inquisitive gaze.
"No. Well, maybe a little. But in a good way." John smirks a little, and Sherlock grins back, his tongue darting out between his teeth.
“Yes, John, of course. I apologise.” Sherlock drops a hand to John’s thigh, and John immediately slides a hand under and laces their fingers together. It feels like he’s holding on for dear life.
All the same, it stings. This boy who's got no idea what it's really like out here, whose clothes are still vaguely clean, who's never had to suck off some gross old skeever for ten quid and a cup of tea; questioning him, judging. It goes down like cheap whiskey, scalding and bitter. Burns all the way down.
“Absence, my dear Watson, makes the heart grow fonder.” I pressed my mouth to his, and held him, pulling him up until he was nearly on tiptoes. As we broke apart, I whispered against his lips, “And I like my present.”
“John, look!” He points to the bowl of brown and tan blossoming across the surface of the warm water, and grins at John broadly.
Sherlock swallows hard and when he looks up at John again, his cheeks are flushed and his eyes are black, round and wide. Just the way John likes him, his wide eyed pet. John’s sweet boy, eager to please. Compliant. John’s breath immediately quickens.
Sherlock moaned quietly, curled his shoulders up into the rough sweep of John's beard against his skin. It was both arousing and soothing, his body divided on how to react. Something so deeply comforting and steadying about that beard, about the man sporting it, something that said
“I have to tell you about Mrs Hudson. And we’re going to have to talk to the police again.” Don’t tell him about Jim. That’s for you to do, Sherlock. Don’t worry him with that.
The car peels away with a screech, careening onto the cross street into a bevy of horns and shouting. John’s shoulders are heaving, his hands clenching into fists over and over, watching the intersection.
Ella sat back and pursed her mouth. "Another two years, John. We seem to have a pattern going here."
“Of course I did,” Sherlock yawns, his ears popping. “What’s so important that you needed to drag me out of bed in the middle of the night?”
“Yes, you have. You’re mine.” John drops a hand to Sherlock’s hip, the muscles undulating under his palm as Sherlock rolls up to meet him.
"John, good grief, that was awful. You sound like one of those romance novels Mrs Hudson reads." Sherlock skimmed his hands down John's warm and flushed back, pulled him close enough to take John's lower lip gently in his teeth.
"I would know." He's already deduced John's most recent shag was about four days previous, judging from the fading scratch marks across his shoulders, the faintly visible love bite under his ear. "You want me to tell you how? Or shall we just get on with the more private part of this conversation?"
Sherlock stretches and sighs, one hand falling naturally to the back of John’s head. He can’t see John under the covers, can’t anticipate his movements, but can only allow sensation to wash over him as John nuzzles his way across Sherlock’s chest. It sends his whole body shivering, the soft hot press of John’s mouth, the way he draws little circles on Sherlock’s skin with the point of his tongue.
Before John could find his voice to ask what he could be offended about, Sherlock was slipping an arm behind his knees and hoisting him up so he was laying in the cradle of Sherlock's arms. He leaned backward so John's weight was centered, and turned sideways to walk up the steps to 221B.
His head fell back away from Sherlock’s bleeding arm and Sherlock grabbed him roughly by the hair as the aftershocks coursed through him, squeezing his muscles around Sherlock’s pulsing cock. The guttural moan that escaped him seemed to spur Sherlock on, and he yanked John’s head back, thrust up again and went completely stiff, the fingers of his other hand stabbing so sharply into John’s hip he knew he’d have bruising tomorrow. The thought of which cut rather pleasantly through his post-orgasm haze, and the pain of Sherlock pulling his hair nearly out of his head.
Sherlock’s groan as John swallows him down for the first time is bone shakingly loud, resonating through Sherlock into John, spreading goosebumps across his skin as Sherlock’s skin slides velvet hot against his tongue.
Mycroft sighs, long-suffering and resigned. “No need for that, John. It’s on top of the wardrobe. On the left hand side.”
. They've waited seven years. People aren't supposed to wait seven years to kiss the person they're in love with, because its overwhelming, because its incomprehensible once it happens.
Sherlock's arms slot tighter against John's thighs, and he rubs his head up into John's chest like a cat. "I
“You interrupted me. Rude.” John arches an eyebrow, looking mischievous. He shifts, leaning over Sherlock and staring into his eyes with an intensity that makes Sherlock’s stomach flutter. He doesn’t blink. “Sherlock Holmes. I love you. I’ve
There's always been such an emptiness, such a hollow inside him, an ache. An ache for something intangible, undefinable. Something missing. He always felt like there was something wrong with him. He's tried ignoring it, tried filling it with danger and drugs, with cynicism, with science. Nothing ever helped close this wound inside him that made just living, just the dailies - getting up, going to school, going to parties and talking to people; things that seemed easy for everyone else - so goddamned hard for him.
. Open your eyes for me.” John says his name reverently, as though it’s a rare thing, a locked away treasure in a secret cupboard. His moustache tickles at Sherlock’s earlobe.
John cups his hand around Sherlock’s angular jaw, rubs his thumb against his chin. Sherlock’s mouth drops open into a little
He’d just put out his cigarette when he sensed movement in the loo. In less than a second, he’d dropped into defensive crouch beside the bed. Eyes fixed on the thin wood veneer of the bathroom door, he saw a shadow move silently in the crack of light underneath. Shit.
When he rips his belt off, and opens his eyes, John’s watching him. His head starts to float a little. John leans forward and brushes his fringe away from his forehead so tenderly, his fingertips hot against Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock smiles sleepily and John grabs his hand, weaves their fingers together. John raises their hands and kisses Sherlock's knuckles, thinking of the night they met, and their first night as couple, and the first night after they were married, and how this one falls in with those. This is the first night they don't have to wake up to the alarm, or worry about a phone going off, or check the blog for leads. The first night when it's just them, the rest of the world be damned.
I missed you." John says into Sherlock's mouth, because that's where his tongue is, and pulls him down closer.
“Just. Shut up.” Sherlock rolls his eyes and pokes his finger between her shoulder blades to make her move.
And now, nearly sixteen months after that first text, here he sits, dressed in his best fitting jeans and a brand new button down, in an uncomfortable chair in this overheated coffee shop, waiting. Impatiently waiting, his skin feeling stretched thin, his head beginning to throb. Digging his knuckles into his eyes, he opens them to a long shadow falling across the table.
going to, after all this time, it's happening, and Sherlock’s mind surges white with million little anxieties, questions, memories, fears, wants, half-remembered dreams, and then goes completely blank, the constant noise of his brain drowned out by John’s lips gently brushing over his jaw.
"John, I'm reading." Sherlock pushes half heartedly at John's head, which is now buried in the curve of Sherlock's spine. He's trying for exasperation, but he thinks maybe he's not getting it right, because all he can feel is blindingly strong affection as John's warm lips press all over his back.
for Christssake. His head is floating, dizzy and shivering, as Sherlock's tongue delves deeper into his mouth and Sherlock's arms are suddenly closing around him, warm and real and heavy, and Sherlock's murmuring against his mouth.
you whispered, and all I could do in response was breathe in and out. I almost shut my eyes when I felt you leaning in, but I made myself keep them open. Your thumb on my mouth.
The only relationship Sherlock’s ever had is with Jim. That was all sex and submission, mind games and trying to one up each other. Barely a week in with John and he’s completely cocked it up. He has no idea how to
“Have you been with him this whole time? Since he ran off?” She’s accusatory, angry. She blames him.
“Making bread.” John smiles and turns his head so their noses bump. He smiles warmly, kisses Sherlock’s lips, and turns back to the bread bowl.
"Okay." One long leg tossed over the rail and then he's flopped next to John, who props himself up on his elbow and just looks at him. There's heat behind the blue eyes, his pulse beating steady in his muscular neck; Sherlock's heart starts to thump faster.
“So what’s the job? What changed?” John had no patience for niceties. He was aching with exhaustion, with sadness, he was homesick. As much as he hated London, it was the only city he’d ever lived in, discounting his time in the Army. He missed the smells, the street signs, the blue plaques. He missed the queues, he missed crowded tube trains, he missed tourists clogging up the crosswalks. He missed the horrible fishy smell coming off the river on humid days. He missed Baker Street. He felt like a refugee, as much as he’d wanted to leave London.
"Well. I might have access to some money. If my dad hasn't...I have a bank account. That's mine. Money from working and birthdays and stuff. It's where my money came from yesterday. I...when I left, I took out a couple hundred quid, but I was afraid to take out more, to have all that cash on me. Except now I'm not alone, and..."
John shuffled into the bedroom and kicked off his pyjama bottoms, pulled his tee shirt over his head and considered himself in the mirror. He was covered in scars, missing a few fingernails, bruises still fading across his chest and arms. He was thinner than he'd ever been in his life, the ever present pudge around his face gone, his collarbones prominent and his belly nearly concave. His old gunshot scar stretched tight over a newly angular shoulder. His eyes met his reflection's, and they looked surprisingly content, calmer than he felt. He blinked, watched his lashes brush against his eyebrows.
“I have no idea how to say this. I’m so ashamed, Sherlock.” John tried to drop his chin, but Sherlock’s large hands cradled his head, holding it up.
John’s mouth ripples, like it did yesterday when he was talking about his sister on Tower Bridge. “Alright. We’ll...we’ll talk about that later. Right now, let’s go get our free breakfast and then check on the money, yeah?”
There’s a few full skips sitting out, it’s hot again, flies everywhere. Southwark is quiet, not many tourists this time of day across the river. There’s a few Americans taking pictures of Tower Bridge from this side. They look lost and nervous, shy away whispering to each other when John and Sherlock pass. They’re both dirty and sweaty, Sherlock’s suddenly painfully cognisant of how dirty they are, how much they both must smell. Like the mildewy tube station, like unwashed hair and cigarettes. They’re clearly street kids, there’s no way round it. No way to hide. Sherlock’s not embarrassed for himself, never is, about hardly anything. But he
Sherlock’s tongue flicks into the corner of his mouth as the skin around his eyes crinkles up amusedly. “Oh certainly. You could slip.”
John laughed into his neck, his breath catching moist and hot in the collar of Sherlock's shirt, then sat up and ran a hand from Sherlock's shoulder to his arse, and gave him an affectionate swat there. "Cocktease."
He kneels up and kisses the inside of Sherlock's knee because its there and because it's one of the few places he's actually touched him before today, and Sherlock pants out, "You don't mind?"
“No, I wouldn’t let him - “ Sherlock cuts himself off, mindful of his promise of the morning, not to lie to John anymore. “Well. I would if I had to, but I don’t think I’ll have to.”
Sherlock kisses him through it, until the twitching and shivering fades into a heavy sigh and John sinks bonelessly against him. They stay that way, Sherlock watching the rain against the window as John breathes humidly against the curve of his neck and strokes Sherlock's thigh with his fingertips. Eventually John stretches, and Sherlock feels him tilting his head down.
The smoke's not really going out the window, more blowing into a cloud round his head, but it doesn't matter as it once would have done. John used to get furious - affectionately furious, but furious nonetheless - at even a whiff of cigarette smoke in the flat. He probably wouldn't even notice now.
"You have some explaining to do, son. Shall we do it here, or am I going to have to take you to the station?"
"I agree." John's breath is coming in hard little gasps. He breathes out through his nose, trying to calm down.
“I do this. if you’re going to stay here with me, you have to know...I’m...this is what I do. You can watch it if you want, but I’m going to do this whether you’re standing there looking at me or not.” Terrifying to say. Is this the moment? The breaking point? John throwing his torch down in disgust and disappearing into the night?
For tonight, however...John was alive, laying against Sherlock’s chest, and he’d kissed him. Kissed him. Remarkable.
Channeling Sherlock. That’s what it felt like sometimes, when he started digging for answers, really listening to what people said, their specific choice of words. Sherlock had taught him that. That semantics mattered, that observing rather than just watching, was critical.
He steps into the bedroom and sees his favourite jeans and his old red button down laid out on the bed. The one he was wearing when they had the fight. Sherlock's put them there, these specific clothes, to remind him. Of all the years they've been together, of what they've been through. The gesture is so profoundly thoughtful after the week they've had, that it nearly reduces him to weeping already. He pulls the jeans on, supple and well worn, and slides his arms into the slightly too loose arms of the button down - he weighed at least a stone more when they met. Running round with Sherlock all these years has worn away those soft lines, turned his stomach flat and his arms wiry and muscled.
Eventually Sherlock realises John’s breathing is slowing and his arms have gone slack. He's got to be exhausted. Barely any sleep for night after night, still recuperating from his injuries, he must be worn to the bone. Sherlock turns so they can walk side by side, one arm still securely around John's waist.
, John. Fifteen months of this shit, this misery. How can you possibly know we’ll be alright? Stop saying that. It’s absurd.” Sherlock’s irrationally annoyed with John’s platitudes suddenly. With his assurances that everything will be fine. It doesn’t
"I can't read when you're --" John took a deep breath in through his nose and exhaled the same way. He folded his paper and turned to Sherlock with a furrowed brow. "Is this about the beard again?"
“You got me there. Still. I’d like to perhaps revisit this tomorrow. And the day after that. And pretty much every day for the rest of my life.” John brushes his mouth over the end of Sherlock’s nose. “So, let’s try to live through tonight, yeah?”
They’re both still wracked with tremors when John pulls out gently and collapses beside Sherlock with a sigh. Sherlock wordlessly rolls, tucking himself into John’s waiting arms and burrowing his face into John’s neck. John’s fingers drift idly up and down Sherlock’s back, and eventually Sherlock realises they’re both falling asleep. He fumbles for the blankets, pulling them haphazardly over their naked bodies. John grumbles contentedly and mouths a messy kiss at Sherlock’s hairline.
“Fine then.” Sherlock doesn’t say thank you. God, it smells amazing. Some kind of thing with mozzarella cheese and pesto, oily and fragrant. Sherlock licks delicately at the edge of it, wanting to savour it.
“What do you want, love? What do you want? I’ll give it to you, whatever it is. Tell me." John grabs Sherlock by the forearms and pulls him down so he can kiss him again, and Sherlock moans against his lips, and John wants to feel him moaning, so he puts his hand against Sherlock’s throat to feel the rumble of his vocal chords as they kiss and kiss and then Sherlock is reaching down and wrapping his hand around John and -- “Oh Christ, Jesus Christ, god Sherlock, yes, god, just there, oh --”
“Hey, Rose.” Sherlock finds himself naturally falling into step behind her, following her up to the entrance of the nearest car.
John laughs, which feels amazingly good, laughing with Sherlock in their bed. It feels like the world reordering itself the way it’s supposed to be. Sherlock laughs too, breathless and deep, and tugs at the jumper again.
“Let’s just watch the match, then, yeah?” She laughs at their obvious discomfort with each other and pulls the chair round so she can see the telly. “Manchester fan? Johnny always liked Cardiff City. I dunno. He likes Welsh stuff.”
John can hear the low rumble of Sherlock on the phone ordering takeaway, as he’s knotting the cotton ties of a pair of Sherlock’s soft pyjama bottoms around his waist. They’re far too long. John doesn’t care. He yanks the tee shirt Sherlock gave him over his wet hair, and pads out to the sitting room. Sherlock’s curled on the couch with his dressing gown wrapped around his legs, long feet crossed over each other. He tosses his phone on the side table.
In the loo, steam billowing out of the shower around him, he squints at himself in the mirror. He looks like he was in a pub brawl. There’s a bruise under his eye where he supposes his face must have bashed into the wall, though he doesn’t remember it. The rough pebbled texture of the brick left scratches and welts all down the right side of his face. His bottom lip is swollen.
“God, you’re so good. Oh fuck, fuck, you’re so - “ John’s hips were moving on their own, rolling against the mattress, pressing up into wet heat of Sherlock’s mouth. “Harder, harder, please. God, your
Greg nods again and flashes a quick grin at them before jogging the rest of the way down the stairs.
with you??” Sherlock clamps his hand over his mouth, horrified at himself, shame seeping through him.
John waited until he was out of sight, and moved around the other side of the table. The vinyl seat was still warm where Lorne had been sitting. He took in his companion, his charge. The person who’s mess he apparently had to clean up.
He hasn’t been high since the night before. His temper is deadly short. He snaps his head up so hard it stings down his neck.
“About seven hours, I think.” Sherlock trails one fingertip over the muscular thigh pressed against him, and nuzzles against John’s sleep-sweaty temple.
John kisses his hips, his navel, licks at the head of his cock. He strokes him slow and deliberate, strokes him until both of them are panting with want, strokes him until Sherlock has to reach down and wrap his hand around his prick while John’s licking at his bollocks. John raises his head, puts his mouth against the wet tip, and Sherlock brushes it against John’s waiting lips, smearing them shiny with precome.
"I don't need time. I'm fine." John's eyes snap open and he levels a steady glare at Mycroft. "Let's get this over and done, yeah?"
Sherlock closed his eyes, listening to soft rhythm of John’s breathing. No one but John had ever engendered this kind of calm in him, just by being alive and being themselves. John was his centre, had been since the day they met, their connection immediate and immutable. Even when the world around them fell to pieces, John always shone like a beacon in the midst of the wreckage, calling Sherlock to safety. Calling him home.
.” John murmurs, and crawls forward, puts his knees on either side of Sherlock’s thighs. Strong arms around his back, pulling him close. John’s mouth in his hair. “Sherlock Sherlock…” He whispers over and over, rocking back and forth a little bit.
"Well, that's that, I guess." Sherlock flips around for a moment, seeing if any stations work, and then turns it off. "No telly. Sorry."
Anger and possessiveness surge up in him, arms instinctively tightening around the rise and fall of John’s sleeping body. “I’m his boyfriend, who the hell are you?”
"Yes, love. Whatever you say." John tucks his glasses on the top of his head and rolls up his sleeves. "Hives."
"I know, I'm sorry. I thought I could trap Jim into  - " John bites into his lip again, eliciting a raw mewl of pain and want from Sherlock. A pleased little shiver crawls down his scalp and over his shoulders as John's mouth moves down over his jaw. He bites him there too, hot and hungry.
“Is John dead?” There he goes again, saying the first harsh unfiltered thing that pops in his mind. It makes him sick to say it, his stomach lurches and he's afraid he's going to throw up again.
Sherlock smiles sadly, smoothes John's short fringe back from his face, "Yes, I think possibly no two people have ever been as good at not understanding each other as we are."
Sherlock’s still standing in the doorway, and feeling horribly out of place. Rose is one thing. She’s in Sherlock’s house, for starters, and she’s usually not surrounded by half her - very Gryffindor - family and a handsome Quidditch star whose presence is currently making Sherlock’s palms sweaty. Weasleys and Potters tend to stick together, and rarely do other people manage to get inside their tight knit ranks. Watson obviously has. The easy camaraderie between everyone here - and Sherlock’s complete inability to function in groups - is making his anxiety spiral.
“Hello, you,” Sherlock says softly, ridiculously glad to see his stalwart little friend. They’re not usually apart from each other at all during holidays, and it always takes Sherlock a few weeks to adjust to Alchemy spending time away from him at school.
By the time he gets to Hackney Central station, his heart has stopped hammering in his chest. The number 30 bus is there, filled with the first commuters of the day. He fumbles an old Oyster card out of his wallet and prays there's enough left on it for the fare. The driver watches him with suspicious eyes as Sherlock presses the card against the reader and waits for the beep. The light goes green and Sherlock sighs in relief, flops down at the back of the bus next to a woman in a leather jacket and a teal green mohawk.
“John Watson?” Inexplicably nervous, his stomach roiling. All he wants is John, he’s tired of talking to everyone but John.
. You belong to me. You can stick your dick in every shining little choirboy that comes along, but you will
Inside was a neatly laid out woolen kilt. The tartan was primarily blue and black, crossed with thick bands of translucent green and shot through with thin golden yellow stripes in rows of three. There was a double buckle at the hip, leather and brass, and a thick brown leather belt at the waist. It reminded Sherlock of something ancient and primal, even though it was probably a mass made thing from a shop in Edinburgh. The smell of it alone was intoxicating - a heady mix of wool and buttery leather, mingled with something spicier, almost like clove or allspice.
Waking up next to John was always perfect, no matter which part of him it was. After so many years of separation, waking up together still came as somewhat of a happy surprise to Sherlock. He would often wake hours before the alarm and just watch John sleeping, memorising every flutter of his honey blonde lashes, mentally recording every mutter and grumble and sigh. It didn’t make up for all the hours of John sleeping that he’d missed out on before they were together, but it was deeply satisfying nonetheless.
“Sherlock. Whatever’s going on in that genius brain of yours, turn it off. I can practically see your fucking gears turning behind your eyes.” John shuffles his hips to the side, makes room. “Please just come and sit with me.”
John. Solid, dependable John. Laying in hospital bed after being nearly beaten to death by mob hitmen. He was working for a hitman. He was helping that squirrelly fellow Lester who'd been here the day before, who’d done god knows what. There was so much else Sherlock couldn’t begin to know. John had always been a man with demons, his basic decency and kindness pushing them back, keeping the monsters caged.
"I know." Sherlock's hand pressed between his shoulder blades, in the dip of his spine, against his hip. They stayed that way for many minutes, Sherlock stroking John's back, John trying to get
He slowed the car to a crawl, looking for Lou’s Diner. He spotted it, and pulled into the first parking place he saw. He stepped out of the Buick and lit a cigarette, shook the pack. Almost out again. He was well over a pack a day now. At some point it was going to kill him.
Soldier Boy’s perfectly shaped little mouth crooks up at one corner, his eyes dancing with mirth. He takes a step toward Sherlock, wriggles his hips suggestively and juts his lower lip out. Sherlock wants to sink his teeth into it.
John reddened and held up his hands in defeat. "Yeah, yeah, alright. I get it. I get it. Fine. But can we skip the pipe at least? You know how I feel about smoking."
“I love you.” John nods, and squeezes his hands at the sides of Sherlock’s head and kisses him so fiercely that it hurts. “I should have said it before, and I’m sorry about that, but now I’m going to say it all the time. Alright?”
It had been a glorious way in which to spend the week before they got married, which was now in just two days. The tuxedos were hanging in black vinyl bags on the wardrobe, their shoes lined up underneath, polished and glossy. There had been a slight hiccup with the catering, which Sherlock had been in a plain strop about for about eight hours yesterday before John smoothed it over. Now everything was set and in place, and they would be exchanging wedding vows on Saturday afternoon. If they were going to go through with this plan prior to the wedding, it needed to be tonight. It was nearly ten. Where in the bloody hell was Sherlock?
Sherlock slowly slowly insinuates his middle finger beside the first, and spreads them, crooks them, wriggles them inside of John until the noises escaping him have grown urgent and raw, his mouth open and gasping against the sheets. Sherlock’s face is burning hot, his body shivering, as he moves up John’s back, mouthing messily at every inch of bare skin, the heat between them electrifying, John moving and rolling ceaselessly underneath him.
John’s warm hands slide up over his biceps and the sides of his neck, feather light touches over his ears, and then strong fingers are twining in his hair and pulling lightly. Sherlock can't quite hold down a breathy shaking moan.
"Jesus you're fucking daft sometimes. It's not about Mary." John swallows very hard; he seems to have no saliva left. "It's
There would be time later. I ran my fingers over the back of the chair as I crossed the room to sit at our small breakfast table. There would be time.
"I'm sorry, love. I wasn't thinking. I shouldn't have said that." John gets up, leans against Sherlock's side and bumps him with his hip. "Hey. Aren't you going to call me a git or an unfeeling bastard or something?"
Sherlock finally gets all John’s buttons undone, spreads his shirt with flattened hands. Pearly pink nipples, not round, but oval. Sherlock teases a fingertip over one, hardening under his touch, John’s head rolling on his neck, sighing. Satisfying.
Nothing is as darkly, dangerously beautiful as Hogwarts and the grounds at night, thinks Sherlock as he heaves his bag over his shoulder and begins trudging up the steep slope to the entrance hall. Rose comes up beside him and threads her arm through his.
. He shuts his eyes again and trails his fingers up John’s bare back, hard enough that he can feel the skin wrinkling under his touch.
Now he realises it wasn't a wound, or a hollow. Or something wrong. It was just John's place to occupy, and John wasn't there yet.
John smiles, turns his face into the coolness of his pillow. That first day was beginning of the rest of his life, and inexplicably, he had
“Just, like...really glad I decided to eat that sandwich in that alley yesterday. For a lot of reasons.”
John sucks at Sherlock’s skin and tongues at his throat, and he can’t help his hips rolling against Sherlock’s hip, his foreskin sliding over the head and back. He’s immediately shivering, electricity spiraling down his limbs, making his fingers twitch and his toes curl. Sherlock turns and puts his hand on John’s hip and then his thigh, and then pushes him flat on his back with purpose. John’s cock is red and wet, laying heavy against the paleness of his belly, and Sherlock kneels over him, rubs his hands over his thighs and his chest, skimming over his cock just enough to make John rock his hips up in response and sob when there’s nothing there to push against.
“Yes, fuck, oh god, I’m perfect, I’m fucking perfect, don’t stop,”John clenches his thighs, running his hands nearly frantically over Sherlock’s neck and up into his hair, then back down, over and over.
“You haven’t kissed me like that - in ages -” John’s shoulders heave up and down while he tries to get air.
The boot popped open and he threw his bags in. He slid across the torn vinyl seat as his mobile pinged.
“You always do.” Sherlock grinned and lay back propped on his elbows, watching John pull his shirt over his head and toss it across the room. He reached out and traced the edge of John’s jeans at his belly. “We never fuck in the dark.”
John's eyes snapped open. He didn't even remember closing them. He looked at Sherlock, who was looking at back at him steadily and gently rubbing his thigh. "Be afraid of what?"
"Yes, I'm just...I need a minute." He breathed deep and regular, trying to push out of his mind the visions of Sherlock underneath him, twisting and weeping and covered in blood.
"Why not? It's beautiful." Sherlock put his hand beside John's and stroked down the front of the wool, which was surprisingly soft and not scratchy as Sherlock had anticipated. "I think you'd look devastatingly handsome."
you to.” Sherlock mouthed at the inside of John’s thigh, tonguing into the soft flesh. He scraped lightly with his teeth and John panted harshly, his leg muscles contracting. Sherlock nuzzled along his flank, John’s fingers massaging the base of his skull, pressing into his cervical vertebrae. He found the spot he wanted, the musky damp skin at the juxtaposition of arse and thigh, and pulled it into his mouth, between his teeth, sucking lightly at first.
. Beautiful boy, look at you,” John loosens his grip as Sherlock just keeps coming, thrashing and moaning in his arms like he’s drowning. He spurts again, and again, his release splashing in warm streaks across his belly and the sheets.
You’ll incriminate the hell out of yourself. You talking to the police here is not a possibility right now.”
Sherlock gives John a curious smile, eyes full of mirth. He doesn’t let go of John’s hand. “Everything alright?”
John groans in response, his voice two octaves deeper than Sherlock has ever heard it. “Oh, god, how I want you. You’re so -”
After he left Lester’s, feeling dirty and sick, he needed to beat someone or fuck someone. Since there was no place in Bemidji to do either one without being noticed, he settled for punching the wall of the hotel he was staying in until his knuckles were bleeding, and then wanking off in the shower so hard that it hurt, blood and come swirling together down the drain as he shook and panted, tears streaming down his face.
He worked his way down Sherlock’s neck, swiveling his chin in gentle circles, the roughness of the beard scraping just lightly over Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock stretched and rumbled a low purr, arched his hips up just enough. John gasped as Sherlock’s arse pressed his cock into his belly, raked his teeth tenderly over Sherlock’s shoulder. With teeth and lips and beard, he scratched and licked and kissed every centimeter of Sherlock’s back. Sherlock tried to open his eyes, tried to make a noise, but he was weak with the pleasure of it. It was far beyond arousal, it was bone deep comfort, pleasure seeping into his pores, through his neurons.
Warmth flared inside John’s belly, so powerfully it knocked the breath from his lungs. The thought of him on his knees in front of Sherlock, arse in the air, Sherlock seeing him plugged open, stretched wide for him, it made his mouth go dry. He licked his lips and tried to formulate words. “Patience, love. You’ll get a good look when it’s time. Now go in the bedroom and wait for me, yeah? I’m going to get us some water, and I’ll be right in.”
“Ah, well then. I suppose I’ll have to scold him properly tomorrow.” Mrs Hudson ushers John inside. “Cuppa tea with your pasty?”
“It’s fine. I’m leaving now. I’ll be in touch.” He nodded at John and without another glance at either of them, slipped out of the booth and out the front door.
"Very well. When we get home, I would very much like it if you would dismantle and scrub out my chem set. I haven't done it in ages, and it's just gasping for it." Sherlock tried to keep a straight face, but wasn't sure he completely succeeded.
"Yes, you're very clever," I replied, brushing my thumb sweetly over his mouth, the mouth which gave me such endless and varied pleasure, and dipped down to kiss him again.
"John, no. Yes, you did mean to. Don't stand there and blatently lie to me. You meant to interfere. You meant to assert your authority over me -"
Sherlock barely registers the comment. John can see the gears still turning in his mind. “Our sex though...is relatively vanilla, comparatively, to much of what I read. I wouldn't mind - going a bit - farther in that area.”
Sherlock blinked innocently as John descended on him, rubbing his face into his neck and pushing him flat on the his back. “Turn over, you gorgeous creature. You want this beard all over you, you’re going to get just that.”
“In your mouth? You like that?” Sherlock’s shoulders are heaving, curled forward as he shivers, face red and tiny perfect beads of sweat at his temples and above his lip.
"You can’t make a mistake, Sherlock. Okay?” John’s voice is tender as he thumps the loaf of raw dough into a ceramic pan, another one Sherlock didn’t even know they had, and tilts his head at Sherlock as he pats the dough down to fit the contours of the pan. “Have you never baked anything before?”
"No." John felt guilty saying it, rubbed his lips over Sherlock’s chest and squeezed him close in apology.
John laughs, too, easily and genuinely, and everything feels so breakable. Sherlock shuts his eyes against it, refusing to allow what’s coming later to intrude upon this.
There are a hundred things John wants to tell him, sappy sentimental things about soul mates and broken people who fit together to make a whole, he wants to tell him how waking up next to him every morning still feels like a minor miracle, that the thought of them ever being parted is anathema, that all John needs to be happy is Sherlock’s heavy warmth wrapped round his chest. Sherlock surely knows these things, after half a lifetime together, but John finds himself more and more wanting to give voice to them. Maybe it’s mortality creeping cold fingers into his consciousness as they inch toward seventy. Maybe it’s just that he’s never outright said those things, and he feels like he should have, every day. He wants to
Sherlock can’t help the smile that sneaks onto his face as John looks up at him from under his lashes, his eyes shimmering again with mirth. The lovely feel of John’s fingers on his arm disappears as John steps away and begins slowly walking backward up the hill. He beckons Sherlock to follow.
to?" His voice is quiet, hesitant. He's not trying to claim Sherlock, not trying to command him. He’s pleading.
They moved unhurriedly, not possessed this morning by the frantic hunger that sometimes still overtook them. John tilted his head back and kissed at the side of Sherlock’s jaw as Sherlock slipped John’s pyjama bottoms off with lingering touches over his hips and belly. John kicked them off once they were at his feet and wriggled his now half nude body against Sherlock with a quiet hum. Sherlock canted his hips gently, listening to their syncopated breathing, spreading his long fingers over John’s hipbone and easing him back.
Sherlock nods, his eyes screwed shut, his body twisting and arching, pushing into John's hand. "And then - you'd touch me, like you are now - and more - "
.” Sherlock turns his face into John’s hair and kisses him, lays one long hand possessively against his hip. “Not again.”
Unable to fight sleep any longer, and soothed by John’s strong arms around him, he allows himself to sink, his dreams a confused jumble of the sitting room at home and Jim’s flat and 221b, everything that’s familiar and comforting somehow ominous in his fear darkened mind - his mother offering John and Sherlock a plate of scones and jam while a thunderstorm roils and lashes against the windows - Sherlock crawling into bed with John only to have him roll over and smile at him with Jim’s sharp white teeth - Mycroft doing lines sitting cross legged on Jim’s floor.
Only once before had Mycroft contacted him this way, a cryptic message followed by his strangely disembodied head floating in the fireplace grate, looking as though the flames were licking right into his skin. The common room had been filled with people, being about two in the afternoon on a Sunday. When Mycroft’s head appeared, casually asking round for Sherlock, several people had screamed and run away, which Sherlock had thought pretty good fun, until Mycroft had told Sherlock that their Muggle grandad had just died and that Sherlock needed to catch the next train from Hogsmeade immediately.
John’s eyelashes flutter as he cocks a crooked smile. “Wait for me after? We can walk back to the castle together, and you can give me your uncensored opinion.”
“Hm-mmm.” Sherlock nods again, seeming to shrink into John with each passing moment, his voice getting smaller, body heavier. He’s hit that edge of exhaustion John’s become so familiar with, where once he comes down, he crashes hard and stays in a deep sleep for hours.
“No, I’m not. I’ve, Jesus, Sherlock...I’ve done absolutely wretched things. I’ve hurt a lot of people. I don’t even know who I am anymore.” John still hadn’t moved his hand. His palm was wet with Sherlock’s tears, his thumb still rubbing over Sherlock’s lip.
The station's dim. Sherlock brought the torches, reaches into his pocket and hands John one. As they flick them on, Sherlock catches movement in his peripheral vision about fifteen feet in front of him, dread immediately pooling in his belly.
They watch each other a long moment. Sherlock used to get lost in those chocolate brown eyes, laying on expensive hotel sheets in rooms Sherlock’s mother had paid for.
. And I can’t keep going through this without - I mean, look. I understand what our lives are and I understand that we’re going to get hurt sometimes, it’s just the nature of what we do, but Jesus, Sherlock. I don’t know how many fucking buildings one person can fall off of and still survive, you know?”
Criminals in London operated at night. Not noon, not in the grotesque glare of the day. Americans did everything wrong.
He’d never see this man again in his life. However long his life was going to be. John didn’t even know his name. He could use his mind the way he used his body, pour himself into him without remorse or pity. Get it all out. Say it. With no repercussions, no pity in the eyes of people who still somehow managed to care about him.
“Boys!” Mrs Hudson’s voice is nervous on the other side of the door. “Boys, I hope you’re dressed. There’s a policeman at the front door.”
“Too long.” John kisses Sherlock’s shoulder, curls closer, and pulls Sherlock against him. “He’s not going to call tonight.”
Finally, when he’s fairly confident he’s not going to topple over under the weight of the truths that are now colliding against each other in his mind, he croaks out, “You’re right.”
. Look at me.” John shakes Sherlock’s head a very little bit, and Sherlock’s eyes snap up to meet his. “There’s my boy. Listen to me very carefully. You’re worth more to me than any case in the fucking world, and you need to understand that your worth isn’t tied to solving cases. I wouldn’t give a fuck if you never solved a case again in our lives. You understand that?”
“What do you make of them, Alchemy, hmm?” Sherlock follows the rat’s line of sight, watches a group of obvious first years dragging heavy trunks over the pavement and looking terrified, a gaggle of parents in poorly put together Muggle outfits trailing after them. “Another bunch of useless future Ministry drones, or does anyone look promising?”
Sherlock's flushed all the way down his chest when John moves back around to face him, his lip caught in his teeth and his eyes shut. His eyes struggle open to focus on John. They're black with desire, translucent golden green rims of iris around his enlarged pupils. "You. That was making me mad. Your tongue - "
“You have me, god, Sherlock, you have every part of me. Whatever you want,” John grabs his hands from under his shirt, kisses at bony wrists, at the drying come on his knuckles, feeling like he could pass out in the hallway, every limb weak and wobbling even as his belly floods with a new wave of arousal. “I want you underneath me. Please, please, god, so long - waited - so long - ”
Lester’s eyes went soft and sympathetic. “They beat you bad, John. Real bad. Got a few cracked ribs, I heard the doctor sayin.”
John exhaled with a soft whimper, his cock stiffening against Sherlock’s mouth. “Sherlock. You don’t have to.”
They throw the shots back, John choking a bit on the strong drink, and Sherlock yanks John out into the throng of the dance floor. Sweaty bodies, moving in time with each other, always that one outlier who’s doing whatever the hell he wants to do, stoned off his nut. John just stands there, looking amused and a bit uncomfortable.
His eyelids are so heavy. John's so warm. He wraps a hand around the back of John's head, fingers in feathery soft hair, and pulls him forward. Traces the outline of John’s mouth with his tongue, and John moans, momentarily giving in and leaning into Sherlock's touch; then pushes up to standing so abruptly that Sherlock feels dizzy watching him. “Come on. We’re getting out of here. We have a clean place to be tonight, with air conditioning and sheets and a fucking full breakfast tomorrow morning. I don't want to -- do it -- on this dirty sleeping bag. Let’s go. I want to go.”
“I had no idea. John. Apologies are so inadequate, but...I will offer them over and over again. I am so sorry for all the pain I’ve caused you.” Sherlock pressed his mouth against John’s hair and held them both there. “I will never lie to you again, I swear it.”
“I just. I just saw.” John shakes his head, lost for a way to explain it without sounding like a complete nutter. He exhales slowly through his nose and squeezes Sherlock’s fingers. “Nevermind. I’ll - I’ll tell you some other time.”
. Mum and Dad’ll be so pleased when we can just Apparate places instead of fussing with Floo Powder and Portkeys and all that. Aren’t you excited?” Molly pauses to catch a breath, looking at Sherlock expectantly.
It's savage and filthy and wet and when Sherlock wraps a hand around them both, the angle is awkward, nearly on the edge of painful, but it's not about feeling good, not like that. It's need, aching, repressed, searingly desperate possessive need. John wants his come and his saliva and his skin cells all over Sherlock, Sherlock’s all over him - their DNA mingling, becoming each other. He wants Sherlock under his skin and in his bloodstream. It’s hunger like he’s never felt before.
The domesticity of the message is soothing to his still slightly jangled nerves, and he reads it over several times before crawling out of bed to get a shower.
John swiveled his hips marginally, his stomach muscles undulating under Sherlock's exploring hands. He slid a hand around the back of Sherlock's neck and pulled him down so John's lips were at his ear.  "Shall you be my bonny lassie?"
John kissed the soft flesh of Sherlock's flank, and abruptly stood up. "Sorry, sweetheart. Forgot something rather important. Don't move. I'll be back in a tick."
John hummed and it vibrated through Sherlock’s lips, electric down his throat and through his belly. Between his legs was growing hotter, his cock pulling his pyjama bottoms taut. There was nothing more devastatingly sexy than John half asleep, warm and soft in all the right places. Sherlock breathed in the smell of his sleep-damp skin and exhaled against his throat. Many were the mornings a bleary eyed John was pulled roughly back into bed, protesting about being late for work as Sherlock straddled his hips and dared him to refuse. He never had.
There's a phone number at the bottom. Sherlock knows John won't want to call his sister for help, but he tucks the note in the back pocket of his jeans, anyway. Harry loves John. She bought him ice creams, took him for outings, tried to make their terrible lives a little better, and the moment he needed her, she was here. She's devoted to him, as much as he'll allow her to be.
Time slows. They’re completely lost in each other, Sherlock sinking down into the mattress with John’s weight on top of him, the fire crackling and spitting, rain skidding down the wavering window panes. It’s
John had always tried to do the right thing by Sherlock, even when it was tearing him apart inside. He’s played the role of the assistant, taken Sherlock’s searing criticism with a smile and an eye roll. He’s played the sidekick, even when it interfered with his own life, when it kept him from getting a job, or sleeping properly. He’s played the best friend to the hilt, resisting his own impulses nearly constantly, gritting his teeth and telling himself that Sherlock just didn’t feel things that way and it wouldn’t be fair of him to press the issue.
John stared at him a long moment. Talking about Sherlock was impossible. He couldn’t say his name, and wouldn’t ever dare to utter it in front of a man like this. Sherlock’s name was a benediction. Only worthy people deserved to hear it, and John wasn’t even one of the worthy any more.
“I was attempting to, yes.” Sherlock forces a smile, the kind that usually scares people. It’s not that he doesn’t want to see Molly, except that he really
John took the hint, wrestled it up over his head without dislodging himself from Sherlock's arms, and tossed it to the floor. "There. All yours, love."
John shook his head, gnawing on the inside of his cheek. “I don’t know, Sherlock. I don’t think it’s going to be that simple.”
“Of course.” Sherlock shimmies out of the booth, unfolding his long legs somewhat clumsily, and affection swells warm through John, making him sigh as he smiles up at Sherlock looking down at him. Sherlock’s nose crinkles up and he pauses mid-step. “What?”
“Nothing. Just my brother wondering how the first week of school went.” Sherlock throws her a smile and yawns exaggeratedly. “I think I’m for bed, Molly. Shall we finish up the game in the morning?”
John closed his eyes, let his naked body sink into the mattress, exhausted in every way. He needed the work.
Sherlock’s ever felt before. The pleasure of it courses through him so fast his head goes light. He can actually
John kisses his way across Sherlock’s chest and laps at his other nipple, relishing how Sherlock can’t be still, his entire body jumping and twitching under John’s ministrations, animalistic grunts and whines spilling helplessly from his throat.
He’d stood there with black curls drifting around his feet, listening to the clack of the scissors, and pretended it was Sherlock.
They don’t move, leaning all their weight against the other, holding one another upright. As they’ve done since the second their eyes met in that darkened alley.
“Well, as I said,” I panted, barely able to control the shaking of my voice, “I missed you rather terribly.”
The words shimmered through Sherlock’s nervous system as soft and electric as John’s warm lips against his skin. He whimpered out a soft
You bent down and kissed me so gently, the rain slipping down the window behind you. That image has it’s own room in my mind, just your sleep spiked hair outlined against the white sky between the curtains, the tips of your ears crimson with arousal.
“Well. We’re working up to it.” Sherlock smiled, held out a towel. “Come on and let’s get you dried off.”
He can hear Jim's voice in his ear, feel it against his temple. Jim is a spectre, always at the periphery, but dangerous and real in his retribution.
"That's how you ask, slut." John has to hold back his own thrill as the sound of the word reverberates through his entire body, the power of using it making his head light. He swallows and tries to focus his own desire on what he's going to give to Sherlock, not just the ache of desire in his own belly.
“I have to tell you something.” Sherlock nips at John’s chin and pulls back, his eyes roiling with worry.
John’s hand moves from the back of his head to brush his hair from his forehead, with such tenderness that Sherlock's breath catches. He dares a glance up at John’s face, and nearly sobs from the look of pure wonder beaming from his half closed eyes. John smiles, his tongue squeezed between his teeth, and rubs a thumb against the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock must have had more wine at dinner than he’d thought. He was feeling pleasantly drowsy, the kind of sleepy contentedness that was an unfamiliar state for him. John often said Sherlock had two speeds, full throttle and dead stop, with nothing in between. Now he felt perfectly in between; every touch, every rumble of John’s voice a hypnotic drum beat thumping through him, holding him in this place.
“None of that was your fault. Alright?” John says again, his voice no more than a whisper of wind between tree branches. His thumb rubs a line down to Sherlock’s wrist. “He’s just a wanker. Let’s forget it happened, yeah? We were having a nice walk before that, weren’t we?”
John looked skyward, jutted out his lower lip as though he were thinking hard. “We’ve never tried it in a police car. I’m up for a go if you are.”
Sherlock’s forehead rolls against his, their noses collide, and then Sherlock’s leaning into him, backing them up against the glass and metal partition at the end of the row of seats. Their knees and shoes bump, John trips and grabs at Sherlock’s arm to catch himself, while Sherlock continues to crowd unapologetically into his space.
that Sherlock can see the pores on his nose...to bend his head and put his mouth on John’s. They’re kissing before Sherlock even registers that they are, John humming against Sherlock’s lips and nudging their noses together. John’s mouth is warm and dry, the only wetness between them a gentle flicker of his tongue against Sherlock’s bottom lip. He tastes of apple pasties and bergamot, and he kisses with quiet passion, slow but purposeful.
“Hufflepuffs allowed in this compartment, or shall we piss off down the train car?” Rose purses her lips and cocks an eyebrow at John.
“We done?” John’s back teeth ground together. It was important not to lose his temper in front of this man. If he did, the whole job could be blown.
"I don't know. I just. When I saw you, I just..." John’s too close. John’s breath is on his face, tobacco-y and sour from sleep. Sherlock can see every spot on his face, every hair. He’s got stubble, silvery blonde in the grey light. “I don’t know. You looked so alone. I just didn’t want you to be alone.”
“I assure you, this time it was entirely unintentional.” Sherlock tries for the haughtiest tone he can muster, and is rewarded by the rich warm sound of John’s laughter.
“You’re so sad, John. Why are you so sad?” Sherlock can hear he’s a bit off, his voice sounds different. “Don’t be sad. We’re going to go have fun tonight, just like -- we’re gonna go on a date.”
The sunlight behind the other boy blots out all his features. He’s a black silhouette. Compact, muscular, tight fitted clothes accentuating slightly bowed legs, the curve of biceps, strong neck. Paper bag dangling at the end of a small square hand. He turns his head, to look at Sherlock, presumably, and his eyelashes catch the light, blonde, absurdly long and curved gracefully upward. Elfin nose, square jaw.
“I haven’t had you in twelve days.” Sherlock scraped his fingernails lightly up John’s shin, over his knee, making him jerk and giggle reflexively.
By the time John finally stirs, purplish evening light has infiltrated every corner of the bedroom. It’s cosy, reminding Sherlock of long autumn days spent in front of the fireplace at home. Books and Tinker Toys and his mother bringing him tiny china cups of overly sweet tea. His throat closes.
John has to bite into his upper arm to keep from shouting out as the thick head of Sherlock's cock presses inexorably into him. "You can take it, I know you can." Sherlock breathes out, and then thrusts home with such force that John loses his footing and skids sideways, before Sherlock's hand closes around his hip and holds him up. John's so full, so suddenly, that it's not quite comfortable. He can't help the hoarse whimper that escapes him, and before he can even question why he's saying it, he chokes out "I'm sorry," but Sherlock kisses his neck and his hair, rolling his hips in sinful little circles that make John's entire lower body buzz with pleasure "It's okay. It's fine. You're perfect. I want you to come for me now."
“Well, I was going to…” John’s tongue slid slow and wet down his arse, his hands spreading Sherlock’s thighs. He nudged his face into the heat between Sherlock’s legs, nipped with gentle teeth at the indentation where arse met thigh. The beard felt rougher here, on tender skin, which John seemed to instinctively know, and gentled his ministrations. “If you want me to.”
John ruffled Sherlock’s hair as he passed, easy and affectionate. Sherlock watched him as he set off, silhouetted against the low mountains rising purple across the loch.
That's not how life works. That's not how the world works. It's pain and loss and and they're teenagers, they're kids, John can't possibly know how he'll feel in ten years, in twenty. One of them could get cancer, get hit by a bus. They could just fall out of love, the way people do. He wants to say all these things, because that's the kind of person he is, thinking of every eventuality, not having faith in anything. Those indigo eyes bore into him, the black streaks like bolts of electricity, and instead of all those things, he says, "Amazing. You're amazing. I love you."
"No." Sherlock realises John isn't making fun of him. Sherlock's lack of any working knowledge of popular culture has become a running joke between them, with John on a fairly lighthearted mission to educate him, and Sherlock just as lightheartedly resisting him at every turn.
, about what happened in those months after she shot you. Or the aftermath of it, that lingered and reverberated, and changed everything for us. That ultimately brought me back home, and into your life again the way I should have always been.
He swallowed hard, and looked around, more than half expecting to see someone lurking round the corner of a building, watching him. A deep unsettled feeling washed over him. This wasn’t Mycroft. His blood ran cold.
John squints at him, holding the lamp close enough that Sherlock nearly flinches from the heat. “Well, your pupils are of normal and regular size, you don’t seem concussed. You don’t seem feverish,” he murmurs, almost to himself. “Tell me what’s the matter, darling, talk to me.”
He’s going to come all over the sheets, just rutting like an animal while Sherlock’s fucking him. The visual of that, of John’s wet flushed cock trapped between his belly and the bed, makes everything in Sherlock’s body go tight and stretched. He slams his eyes shut and forces himself not to come yet.
Cursing Mike for talking him into this in the first place, Sherlock bites his lip hard enough to sting, and looks down at the toes of his trainers. “Just, um, thought I would see what all the fuss was about.”
“No, no. I need to - um, I’ll just get you a blanket and put on the kettle. It’s freezing in here, I swear. We really must look into getting a new furnace -”
“No,” Sherlock grabs the sides of John's head and lifts it up, kisses him bruisingly hard on the mouth. “No, please, I don't want it to be over yet.”
“Of course I was, baby. Every word. You’re very clever.” John rubbed a thumb down the side of Sherlock’s face. “And very lovely. I always listen to you, Sherlock. Even when you’re making me mental and I want to fling myself into the Thames just so I can have
He dreamt of John. In the disjointed way of dreams, John was both at Baker Street and in America. Sherlock met him in a hotel, John staring at him with teardrops suspended in his eyelashes. Sherlock slid his arms around his waist in the kitchen at Baker Street, rested his forehead against John’s wool clad shoulder. They drank tea in their chairs, John’s eyes so cerulean blue they couldn’t possibly be real. John’s lips against Sherlock’s, his hand cradling his jaw. John striding across that bleak parking lot, anger vibrating off his frame like heat. John laughing against the wall in the entry hall, hand pressed against his stomach. John crouched by a body, thighs tight and muscular in his jeans, his eyes beaming warmth and pride up at Sherlock.
"I would love to, but my neck isn't supposed to bend at his angle, I don't think. I need to just..." John trailed his hand over the back of Sherlock’s leg, tracing each tendon, swirling his fingertips in the hollow behind his knee, laughing low when it made Sherlock jump and curl his leg up. He squeezed Sherlock’s calf, massaging it gently. “Come to bed, love. I’ll give you lots more. Of whatever you want.”
John reaches into the bedside drawer for the lube and another new toy he's been keeping for today. He sets them next to him, and slaps over where he just pinched. "Up on your knees. That's it, my sweet little whore. Look how well you obey me."
"Coming, John!" He grinned and grabbed the bags quickly, throwing them onto the front steps before jogging around to extricate John from whatever he'd gotten himself into now.
person, this one right here, he’s my concern at the moment. He needs a night off. We’ll be in touch.”
“Mmmm,” comes a deep rumble behind him, and then a chilly nose presses between his shoulder blades. “Morning.”
." Sherlock can hardly breathe, a confused ache spreading through his chest. He truly doesn't want to stop him, but he should.
She waves him off with her other hand and shakes her head. "Nonsense. I have an empty flat, you have a lack of steady housing. Just practical. Now, let's get you upstairs out of this chill weather. You need a nice cuppa and something to eat."
“Oh my god, I’m so - “ Sherlock runs his hands furiously over John’s bare thighs, kisses his throat and his collarbone, “I need you now, or I’ll just - “
Sherlock clears his throat nervously, fingers frozen on John's knee. "I propose a solution. A balance, if you will. While you are unquestionably the dominant partner in our private life, I propose myself as the dominant partner in our professional life. We both function better within the confines of structure and pre-negotiated boundaries. If we both agree I am the dom at work, then you must respect those limits. Or there will be consequences for you at work just as there are for me at home."
"Oh, how mature, Sherlock. We making height jokes now? Yeah, I'm fucking short. Four stars, mate. What an insult. You're acting a right bloody fool." John can't stand looking at the derisive curve of Sherlock's lip for one more second. His entire body is quivering. He stomps into the sitting room and snatches his keys off the key rack, scraping his knuckle across the hook in the process. Great. Now he’s bleeding. He sucks the blood off and wrenches the door open. "I need some air."
Sherlock allows himself to pretend. To pretend that it’s alright, that everything will work out. He wraps one long spindly arm around John’s broad shoulders, brushes his knuckles slowly up and down John’s bicep. John sinks closer, relaxes into Sherlock’s chest, his knee hooks over Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock feels his breath growing even under his arm, his head getting heavier.
hate you." John can't stop touching Sherlock. Face, neck, belly. Warm and whole and strong. "You have to tell me everything. I have to know."
“John, are you alright? Why are you rubbing your head? Are you dizzy?” Sherlock’s voice is tinged with worry, almost panicky, as he kneels on the floor and leans up to look into John’s face. His sea glass green eyes are roiling with concern, his eyebrows drawn in a sharp v, making that adorable crinkle at the bridge of his nose that just begs for kissing.
John watched him until the door of the trailer swung closed, and then shut the door of the Buick, rolled the window down, and took out his cigarettes. He pulled one out with his lips and lit it with the cigarette lighter from the dash, the smell of burning electrical coil reminding him powerfully of the consistently strange smells emanating from the kitchen of 221B.
, fuck,” John thrust forward hard, so hard it was on the edge of painful. He stilled for a long moment, his hips kicked forward once more, and Sherlock felt the swell of his cock inside him, the hot wet rush of come filling him up, and then John was whimpering and trembling in the cradle of Sherlock’s legs. He shook and sobbed, fingers clutching at Sherlock's hipbones so hard it hurt.
A calm washed over him like a wave breaking on the sand. Tension he hadn’t even known was there evaporated, and he felt almost weak with relief. He pushed up on his knees and pressed his lips to John’s. John's hand cupped around the nape of his neck, thumb rubbing slowly.
“No.” Sherlock whispers, looking over at John and begging him silently to stop. No good can come of provoking him.
Sherlock tears his eyes away from John’s face and follows his line of sight. James Moriarty is standing barely two metres away, twirling his wand between his fingers, head tipped innocently to the side like a curious puppy. Sherlock knows better. There’s nothing innocent about James.
John found he didn't so much care that Sherlock had just carried him up the steps like a child, not now, when he was sitting here, dripping rainwater all over the sofa in 221B, the flat looking exactly as it had the day he'd left. Sherlock's chemistry set still on the table, Sherlock's dirty coffee mug from that last morning before it all went to shit sitting mouldy and ruined on the desk next to John's laptop. He'd never been able to move a thing. It had felt too much like he was erasing Sherlock.
“Hey.” John’s voice soft, lilting, it wraps around Sherlock’s throat like a warm scarf. “Don’t be upset, okay. We’re gonna have some fun after this. I promise.”
“That’s unusual. Suits you. I’m Martha Hudson. You can call me Mrs Hudson, almost everyone does, even my friends. Now, let’s go check on John.” She pats him arm again, in such a motherly way that his stomach churns, and he suddenly desperately wants his own mother, her grey bun and sensible shoes, her ruddy round cheeks. He wants to smell her lavender soap on her skin. She wouldn’t hold him, wouldn’t hug him, because that wasn’t her way...but she would be there. She would sit, and read, and when Sherlock started to fall apart, she wouldn’t allow it.
Sherlock’s answer is immediate and unwavering. “Since the beginning. Since I saw you for the first time.”
"Oh god, yes, please. I've been waiting all night." John straightened up, barely able to breathe looking at Sherlock's sweet swollen lips, red with John's blood. "Christ, you are so beautiful like this."
John sweeps the pieces into his cupped hand, and dumps them into the bin. Now in a thumpingly bad mood after his discussion with Mycroft, he bends down to dig round in what used to be his makeshift liquor cabinet, and is in actuality, the dank space underneath the sink. Mrs Hudson must have gotten rid of most of it, because the space is much emptier than he remembers leaving it, but he locates a dusty half full bottle of Tesco’s Special Reserve scotch - he hadn’t been picky back then - and pours two fingers of it into a smudged mug.
“John.” Sherlock breathes out, and twists, turns so he can brush his fingers against John’s renewed erection.
"You're being way too fucking understanding. Stop it. It's not like you, and you're freaking me out." John cracks one eye open at him and tries to smile. Sherlock closes a hand over his knee leans forward and kisses John's leg through his jeans. "What was that for?"
"You crossed a line. I won't let you do that again. The Work comes first. Always. You've always said we do this our way, that we're not bound by arbitrary rules, that we make our own. Well, I'm making a rule. You're never allowed to interfere with The Work. Not as my husband, not as my dom. The Work is mine. Mine, and you'll defer to me in that or you won't be a part of it anymore, understand?"
Sherlock hums and nods again, allows himself to collapse back against the bed with a whine as John licks slow and purposeful at the base of his cock. He rocks up to get a better angle, and pulls his hand from Sherlock’s grip so he can put one hand on each of Sherlock’s hips and hold him relatively still. He doesn’t take him back in his mouth, but instead does what Sherlock asked, licking and lapping at him unhurriedly. He closes his eyes and concentrates on enjoying every second of this - the solid press of bone against his palms, the taste of Sherlock on his tongue, the tickle of his pubic hair on the end of his nose. John licks at his bollocks, circling his tongue into that soft pulsing point behind them until Sherlock’s tensing again, straining against John’s hands holding him down.
“That’s fine, okay. I can handle it. Get dressed.” John sets his mug on the windowsill and shuts the door firmly behind him.
John shifts his weight, brings his knees up against Sherlock's arse and leans forward so  they can kiss, bending him nearly half and their kissing is sloppy and uncoordinated and John can feel Sherlock's heart beating against his own chest.
John's grip is firm, secure, as he pulls Sherlock up. He’s short, tiny. He seemed so huge a few moments ago, his presence filling up the space his body doesn’t occupy. They haven't stood next to each other before now, and Sherlock looms over him, a full head taller. "Thank you."
Jim’s mood turns on a dime, as it so often does. A vicious sneer crosses his face as his looks from John to Sherlock. “I
“Oh.” Sherlock can’t seem to manage more than that, so John just takes him back in his mouth, and sucks and sucks and licks and thinks how many times he wanted to take Sherlock apart like this and now that he is, it’s overwhelming and familiar all at the same time because it’s Sherlock, and nothing about Sherlock could ever be unfamiliar. Sherlock is
. He shut his eyes and stuffed his fingers in his ears, let the sound of rushing blood sweep these ugly thoughts away. He exhaled smoke and sorrow and fear, resolved to go back to John and not burden him with this shit.
Sherlock strokes him, widening his fingers into a V, almost pulling all the way out and then slipping back in up to the knuckle. Within minutes, John's half hard again, his cock jerking and swelling against his belly. John reaches down between them, closes his hand around Sherlock's cock and pulls gently. Sherlock immediately loses his rhythm, head falling forward into John's collarbone, awash in endorphins, his whole body reeling.
Sherlock was evaporating before, dissolving. Now he’s on fire, burning away from the inside out and turning to ash. He’s writhing and groaning so loudly he knows he should try to quiet down, but he can’t, not with those blue black eyes staring into his and John’s hands hungrily caressing every part of him.
John rolls his eyes and shakes his head, lets go of Sherlock’s chin and leans into his side. “I have this feeling you’ve almost never said that to anyone else.”
"Was? Not over yet, my little honey bee." John slides his hands around Sherlock's hips, and then down over his thighs, his touch definitely becoming more hungry.
“Of course I am - you just fingered me for ten minutes and had your tongue up my arse. If I wasn’t hard again, I’d be a bit concerned, frankly,” John snickers as he pulls Sherlock’s jeans down to his mid thigh and leans back, bending his legs up to hook the heels of his boots on the edge of the counter, spreading himself out for Sherlock. He picks the lip gloss up from the counter with a wink and squeezes a generous amount into his palm, then reaches between them and gives Sherlock’s cock a long wet pull, twisting his wrist at the tip in a way that makes Sherlock’s entire body convulse.
them, see the colours of John touching him; red and burnt orange and honey yellow dripping heat all over his body.
John shrank into the hallway. He tried to breathe more shallowly, quivering with the need to hear what Sherlock and Mycroft were discussing. Mycroft knew about Malvo. There had to be a reason he was asking Sherlock about it.
, and it's going to be alright." John strokes him harder, inches forward so they're pressed together from shoulder to hip, and buries his face in Sherlock's neck. He opens his mouth and licks, pulls skin between his teeth and sucks. "
John smelt the tea before Sherlock set the cup on the side table. He opened his eyes, watched as Sherlock lowered himself into his own chair. A warm happiness rose in his chest and he didn't fight it, letting it expand through his ribcage and his throat; sunshine on the first day of spring. He stretched out his legs, covered Sherlock's socked feet with his bare ones.
“Yeah?” John straightens, gives Sherlock those huge round flirty eyes, from up under his lashes. Moves forward and brushes his lips over Sherlock’s shoulder, nuzzles his nose against it. Sinks his teeth into it.
They skirt round the western corner of the castle, taking a winding path down to the lake, where the giant squid is lazily breaking a log apart with its tentacles, and then back around the main building to trace the shadowed edge of the Forbidden Forest. The conversation flows more easily as they meander the grounds, talking about the friends and acquaintances they have in common, about school.
Years of war and injury and death prepared him for a lot of variables in life, but nothing could have prepared him for the maelstrom that was Sherlock. Sherlock came into his life at a time when John didn't even know who he was, when he was so lost and alone he couldn’t see a way forward. Sherlock had wiped away that lost, miserable person like tsunami waves wiping the landscape clean. The nightmares had stopped, the depression abated. He’d had a purpose again, and that purpose was Sherlock.
"If my dad hasn't shut off my card, I could..." John turns to Sherlock, baleful eyes stormy with emotion. "Sherlock I don't want you to have to do
John took his hand off Sherlock’s cock and put it on his other hip. He shifted his knees so they were flush against Sherlock’s arse and canted them forward, dragging Sherlock’s body up to meet his. Sherlock gasped and rolled his head, his hips, his whole body twisting with pleasure as John abandoned all restraint and pounded into him with pure carnal need.
Sherlock laughs. He’s laughed more in the last day and half than he has in five months. Maybe more than he ever has. John’s made a light inside him that seems to flare brighter with every hour they spend in each other’s company. "You just ate."
“Well. Yes.” John couldn't help his apologetic smile as she bent over to cradle his face between her hands and plant a kiss right in the center of his forehead. They had taken care of each other, after Sherlock died. They’d eaten together, crammed side by side at her tiny kitchen table, or knee to knee with plates balanced on their laps as they watched the evening news. As John just disintegrated, she’d tried so hard to keep him together, bringing him food and doing his laundry and cleaning the flat for him, as much as he’d let her.
Sherlock bites into his own lip, mirroring John, “Alright,” he says, low and rough, his eyes shimmering.
All the air had gone from the room. John could hear his own blood thudding in his ears, smell the blood on Sherlock's mouth, could taste it on his tongue. He wound his fingers up into Sherlock's hair and crushed their mouths together, licked and bit desperately at Sherlock's lips. He couldn't get enough of him. Sherlock whined, looped his uncut arm around John’s shoulder and dug his fingers into his skin.
“I know. I did too for a minute.” John’s hand strokes down his back once, his voice softer than it was. “I’m so tired.”
“Well get the fuck in, don’t just stand there like a twat.” John had no patience for sitting here being gawked at by these chavvy hookers.
Mike knows Sherlock doesn’t give a single shit about Quidditch. He’s never attended a match, not in five years at school. He shakes his head, half amused and half annoyed. “So you’ve figured it out, then.”
It's freezing in the flat. The Belstaff is still crumpled on the floor where John had pushed it off of him the afternoon previous. He grabs it and slides its familiar weight over his shoulders, cracks open the window behind the desk, perches on the edge of the windowsill with his leg propped across it, and lights a cigarette.
"Oh shut up." Sherlock grinned, and took John's warm hands, pulling them both down the short hallway and into bed.
Sherlock tucks his hands behind his head and stares up at the canopy, mentally running through the possibilities.
Sherlock lets out a howl of frustration, and whirls away from John, banging on the sides of his head with his palms. "But you keep acting like its just me! Pretending you get nothing out of this, and that's so goddamned untrue! You love this. You
John's deeply asleep, sprawled on his back, mouth hanging open. Sherlock slinks out of the bed, trying not to let it creak and groan. He pads softly into the darkened kitchen  and opens drawers until he finds a stubby pencil and half a pack of envelopes. He scrawls
"Oh." Sherlock stares forward, eyes fixed on the fireplace. "I had no idea that would still upset you after all these months."
“I’ve got you,” John breathes out into Sherlock’s hair, so comforting and tender that it aches.That whispered endearment, the unaffected fondness in those words, is what pushes Sherlock over the edge. Pleasure washes over him, hot and cold and shivering, and he comes with a sob, face buried in John’s neck, as his hips continue to pump gently against the soft swell of John’s arse.
Nondescript accent. Could be from almost anywhere in the states. No one sounds like that naturally, everyone has a telling accent if you know how to listen. This man’s had been trained away. Interesting.
Sherlock shuts his eyes against the truth of John's words, against the pain of knowing he's going to be walking away from this in a few hours. To try and preserve it, to make sure they're safe. To make sure
Of course, pipes up the other side of Sherlock’s brain, that’s not entirely true. A laundry list of names runs through his mind, people that worked for Voldemort, for his followers. Voldemort himself, whose destructive and narcissistic nature had already emerged before he even got to Hogwarts. It’s entirely possible that a seventeen year old could be working toward some sinister purpose, of course it is.
"Yes. It's lovely." Sherlock swallows down all those words, his throat sore, and wraps his arms around John's shoulders. "You okay like this? Doesn't hurt your incision?
had a belly full of Korean takeaway and a glass of red wine in one hand. Your knee brushed mine as you leaned back into the sofa and you didn’t move it away. Your eyes were so dark. Something hot and shivering spread through me and I knew tonight was The Night.
All John can see in the bare flickering light of this dingy alleyway are the whites of Sherlock’s eyes as he nods. John puts his mouth against Sherlock’s ear and mouths
Sherlock's legs fall open, and John rocks back to kneel between them. "God, look at you. You need to come so badly, don't you?" Sherlock's cock is so hard and aching it's nearly purple, his testicles hanging heavy between his sweaty thighs, his entire body shivering with need - he looks stunning and profane.
Epiphany. He realises - with the kinetic force of a freight train - in this moment, with John looking down at him as though he’s the sun and the moon, smoothing a sweat soaked lock of hair behind his ear, that he hasn’t been ready to see what’s always been right in front of him. John’s been there, all these years,
. We cannot possibly pass up this opportunity." Sherlock looked meaningfully at John, and John laughed a deep rumbling chuckle, shaking his head.
Mrs Hudson pushes open the heavy metal door and holds it as Sherlock shuffles through. John would have held the door for her, not the other way round, you rude obnoxious… He can’t stop. Can’t stop these thoughts that were incessant before John, even before Jim. Consuming him. He needs to fly. The sweet hard snap of his skin under a needle, the oblivion that comes right after. He’s shaking again.
John turns and curls against Sherlock’s side, kissing at his shoulder. “I’ve never - not like that.”
"I thought about you that night too," Sherlock whispers, pulling John's bottom lip between his teeth. He pushes at John's boxers with his toes, managing to pull the elastic down under one arse cheek. "I wanted this. I wanted you to come home to me and just - like this - with you on top of me - "
"Delicious." Winking, he takes Sherlock by the hand and twines their fingers together, “Come on, we can clean up in the staff washroom.”
He ignores it. “Okay, well, then get yourself in the shower and brush your teeth and I’ll have some breakfast ready when you come out.”
“What do you want, darling? You know how I love to hear you ask for it.” John’s voice was thick with lust, his throat flushing a deep crimson as he pushed my dressing gown further down my arms, leaving it dangling open from my elbows and pooling on the hearth rug. He bit into his bottom lip and exhaled, tilting his head to the side and allowing his eyes to drift along my torso searchingly. He then smoothed his left hand in circles across my abdomen, gently rubbing at my nipples and dipping his fingertips into the valleys of my rib cage. His right hand fell to my thigh, exerting gentle pressure against the muscle. “
"The beard. It's a different colour than your hair. Your hair is blonde. Your stubble is blonde and grey, but when it gets longer, it's ginger." Sherlock sounded distinctly accusatory.
Sherlock nodded, beyond speech. He ran his hands down John’s back, sweaty and hot from the fire, and over the smooth wool until he found the hem and tucked his fingers up inside. He smoothed his hands up the backs up John’s thighs, and up to the firm muscles of his arse, which tensed under his hands. John tipped his head down and kissed Sherlock’s mouth tenderly, parting his lips achingly gently with his tongue. Sherlock kneaded his arse, running his thumbs over the muscled dimples at the small of his back, dipping his fingertips exploringly between his cheeks, and kissed him back with both fond familiarity and throbbing lust.
"It wouldn't have changed anything. I would still have had to go." Sherlock's breath is coming faster, his face and his neck are hot, so hot. He arches, neck bending back, hips slipping up against John's.
Sherlock can't answer that. It's too sentimental. It's too hopeful. His chest is bursting under the weight of all John's expectations, all of John's faith in him. He doesn't deserve any of it.
John swallowed, and plastered a smile on his face. Maybe if he just -- pretended. He breathed deep through his nose and looked up, met Sherlock's worried expression with his own false smile. "I'm okay. I'm fine."
Sherlock's eyes never leave him as he takes the bills out of his shorts and smoothes them, laying them carefully on the bar in a neat pile and counting them twice before he folds them and hands them to the bartender. The bartender claps a hand down on his shoulder with a grin and wink. The sight of the other man’s large hand on that delicious curve of bare skin awakens in Sherlock an unexpected and ferocious surge of possessiveness.
God, this is intoxicating, and they haven't even really started yet. Sherlock entirely compliant, more than he's ever been before, desperate for John's touch, for his approval, his soft words. Because they have boundaries now, and within those boundaries they can truly let go, as they've never done before. John shivers, his jeans increasingly constricting. He breathes slow and deep, Sherlock's eyes on him the entire time.
“Jim, whatever you want, I’ll do it.” He’s never felt so desperate. He knows what Jim is capable of, knows how he toys with people.
“Okay.” They stare at each other, John’s sweaty fingers wrapped around Sherlock’s thin wrist. Sherlock shakes his arm. “Well, go, for fuck’s sake. Go get the money.”
what I meant. You heard less than half the conversation, John. Don't - don't think I'm pitying you. I am not."
” Sherlock interjects indignantly, though he still somehow can’t seem to wipe the ridiculous smile off his face.
“Yeah?” John smiles at him, that big, close-mouthed smile, and his eyes crinkle up at the corners, and Sherlock wants to bottle that expression, carry it around in his pocket for whenever he needs a reminder that the world isn’t awful.
“Tell me if you don’t like it, and I'll stop." John passes a hand soothingly over Sherlock’s hip and over his thigh, kisses his belly. Sherlock’s hand presses into John’s hair, assenting, encouraging. That seems enough permission, since Sherlock’s voice is apparently lost somewhere in the scant space between them.
much." John sauntered across the room, hips rolling, and slipped his arms around Sherlock's waist. He put his mouth to his jaw, his chin, and then buried his face against Sherlock's neck, breathing deeply. "No distractions."
much inside. John shifts and pushes back against him, lets out a shuddering whimper, and Sherlock answers him, indecipherable and unbound, noises tearing out of his throat as he sinks down and
Sherlock quickly averts his gaze. Doesn't want John to think he was watching him sleep for almost two hours, even though that was, in fact, precisely what he's been doing. "Oh. Awake again, I see."
"That's it, Sherlock. Just stop worrying. Look around. Look at us. It's going to be alright. We're together, in
, and watched the firelight flickering silver in your eyes while you told me two years worth of stories. I should have shut you up with a kiss at three in the morning, and lain down with you and kissed your hair and your nose and all the parts of you I never thought I’d see again.
“We’ve already discussed this, John. No. Never.” Sherlock played with John’s hand, massaging the knuckles, tracing the lines in his palm.
Mopping up the spilt coffee with a napkin, he shifts his eyes away from Mike’s, down the mostly empty Hufflepuff table, and sees someone’s left their Daily Prophet. The headline reads
“This is bothering you.” John’s mouth ticked up. He walked into the sitting room and put his hands on the back of his chair. “You’ve been thinking about this constantly, haven’t you?”
“I need you to erase him. He was never here. Hotel receipts, GPS, bank transactions, whatever. Whatever evidence there is of John being in this country, make it disappear.”
When John walked in - slightly off balance and red in the face - a few hours later, Sherlock was still curled in his chair, contemplating. He had moved enough to fix himself a cup of tea, which was now steaming on the floor beside him.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m not…” Sherlock was always too apologetic when allowed to be, sorry about everything he was and all his uniqueness that made John love him so ferociously. For all the love that John lavished on him, he was still deeply insecure in so many ways.
He reached up wonderingly, ran his thumb over Sherlock's lower lip, wiping some of the blood away, and put his thumb in his own mouth. Sherlock drew a ragged breath, and John smiled crookedly, knowing they were in the same space together. A drop of blood dripped off his elbow, splashed onto Sherlock’s thigh. John massaged it into Sherlock’s skin with his thumb.
The Great Hall is bustling with noise, louder and more chaotic than it would be on a weeknight. As the four of them weave their way to the Hufflepuff table, they pass by the Gryffindor table, and Sherlock’s gaze is drawn like a magnet to where John Watson is sitting with his two best mates, Greg Lestrade and Paul Dimmock. Sherlock hasn’t talked to him at all since the train ride to school, he has no reason to. But it’s like a physical ache, watching him laughing with his friends, obviously not bothered about Sherlock the way Sherlock’s helplessly bothered about him.
Sherlock wraps his arms around his knees and cranes his neck up to look at the starless London sky. Harry and John’s murmured goodbyes float out through the open window, and then the sound of the flat door shutting soundly. John’s small frame appears backlit from the yellow light of the sitting room, the kitchen dark.
"Come on then, beautiful." John says it because it's true, and because he can, because he's held back from saying things like that to Sherlock for too long. He says it for himself, and is entirely unprepared for the effect it has on Sherlock.
John leaned forward, looked round as though to make sure no one could hear him, and whispered, “Can you tell us what happened? Just before we go? I’m just, you know...curious.”
"Who in uni?" John clears his throat. That came out wrong. "I don't mean names - I just. You've, with men before, right?"
“John.” His voice sounds agonised, and John suddenly worries - because he can’t help it, because worrying about Sherlock is as natural as eating or sleeping - even here, right at the end.
Watson. You love having me at your whim. You love having someone to command and domineer, and you love that it's me. Don't try to tell me you don't."
Sherlock’s basically unconscious when he returns, so John just rolls him on his back and wipes the drying come from his stomach and thighs, runs the flannel gently over his cock and bollocks. Sherlock sighs and stretches, his eyes fluttering open just a crack.
