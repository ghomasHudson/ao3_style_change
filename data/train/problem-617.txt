‘Case my homework. We can work at the Costa if you want. Lead the way.’ They left through the fire escape and the neighbour’s front door to avoid attention. It was always easy to get caught in the hurricane of energy that was Sherlock.
I planned on going out through the same room I got in, but with Sherlock it would be twice as hard. Thinking strategically, and with what I heard, only 2 had made it down the stairs and were now registering the rooms. Someone had to be guarding the stairs, but shooting that person would alert the others and I’d be trapped. So I decided to knock out the two who were inspecting the rooms.
‘Can I see him?’ The doctor turned to face him sceptically, it was unlikely that they shared any kinship, and due to the extent of the wounds only direct family would be able to follow. There was no way Mycroft could beg the doctor not to voice this, as it was probably part of the rules they had to follow.
‘I love you.’ Both were frozen for a moment as John processed Sherlock’s words, he couldn’t take the silence and broke it going thought all his thoughts and insecurities. ‘I know it’s not the most conventional way to say it, I mean, we’re not even dating or anything… well yes, we are friends, have been for a while, but you immediately took a more permanent and important role in my life. I will totally understand if you don’t want to ever see me again, I mean, you date women and while you have been respectful to me I don’t think I have ever seen you…’
‘I’ll call Mary, I think we could do with a night in and some Chinese. Cheer up mate! I’m sure that at some point they’ll come crawling for your expertise. After all, who better than you to notice everything they miss?’ John was smiling at him and Sherlock could feel his heart beating so fast that for a moment he thought it was about to burst out of his chest.
‘Oi! Mate! You mute or something?’ Asked the guy to his left patting his back with such strength he was certain his lungs would collapse.
‘Yes her! The thing is. The police is assuming that the murderer was a man because of how gruesome they are, and the man in custody just falls perfectly into the entire scheme. Well, the woman told me that she would take me to the actual murderer. She told me that she wanted out from the whole business and that for her to be able to find an exit, the police must take the murderer out.
‘Most definitely no.’ He smiled to her and she just rolled her eyes. Leave it to Sherlock to be cryptic and secretive about a coffee shop.
‘That’s an awful lot of questions you’ve got there. I’m just doing what I think will ultimately protect you from harm.’ Tried to dismiss Sherlock the topic as something inconsequential.
The cab stopped a few blocks before. I couldn’t be seen, although it was a possibility that they were expecting me. My first thought had been to check their main meeting point, but halfway there, Mycroft sent me to an abandoned building. Experience told me that if he were being kept captive, he would be in the basement.
‘What are you trying to get to? It’s not like everyday a woman approaches you with all the missing pieces and demonstrates that you are right in everything you had expected things to follow. Now, had I not decided to follow her and gather the data, right now Lestrade’s team and Mycroft’s career would be on the line because people is just blind and unreliable seeing but unobservant. The woman decided that she wanted out so she tried to reach the only subject that was out of the grid. As of now I’m the wild card that moves unnoticed and observes from behind. At least that was how things were until the woman screwed the meeting with the assassin, I don’t expect to ever see her alive again. Best case scenario, we find her body, or pieces of it.’
Mycroft was grinning like a mischievous cat, Sherlock could see him even when he was staring straight ahead. Not like he needed to see him, he knew him enough to know he would grin. Their parents had asked him to take Sherlock to school and make sure that he actually went in. This was the first time he was on his own since rehab, he had to check in with the staff, and attend to all of his classes. Every one of them, no matter how boring or useless the deemed them. And so, here he was, sitting at the very back of the room in a desk by himself. he could see them all pointing at him and talking in hushed voices, all of them drawing conclusions even though they had less than scraps of information. Asymmetric information should never be trusted when drawing conclusions and taking decisions. He knew how the rest of the year would go from there, he'd be alone, as always, and excluded by his fellow peers even though he was the smartest student in the whole room.
‘The name’s Sherlock Holmes. See you on Thursday’ He announced, almost whispered, to John for him and no one else to know. He smiled and left.
“You must understand that under no circumstance the devices will stop working and sending a live feed of everything you say.” I came to Baker Street to find Sherlock and Lestrade in a heated discussion. I couldn’t understand what Lestrade had previously said, but apparently the topic was Wiggins and his safety while they disregarded him. He just sat by the hearth with a bored expression. Even I could deduce that he had given up trying to give any sort of input to the discussion.
‘Sherlock. I think that’s precisely what she’s about to do.’ Interceded John as he saw Irene’s face. Sherlock felt as if a cold bucket was thrown his way. A strange feeling filled him as he saw the expression on both, John and Irene. She was a beautiful and remarkable woman after all, and John was straight. It was only natural. A nervous laughter escaped his lips, it took him a moment to realise it was him who was making the noise.
As Sherlock went out of focus, and he realised that his mind was slipping from his grasp, his last thought was none other than a prayer to be able to survive. Just for Sherlock because he needed him.
“If you really don’t want the case to be published, just say it. I know you did it on purpose.” Said John as calm and sincere as he could for Sherlock to realise that he wouldn’t do something against his will. It took him a moment to answer.
‘Not at all.’ Everyone turned their attention to the front. The professor was about to resume his class when he interrupted him. ‘Except that…’ To Sherlock’s amusement John grinned, and the whole class groaned as he went into an hour-long debate with the professor.
He lowered his sight to his books and pretended to read whatever was written. John wasn’t fooled, he had seen the way in which his mind found the connections, and Sherlock had been writing to the man for a while. There was no way he wouldn’t allow Sherlock to continue after seeing him.
Sherlock doesn’t have to be asked twice to go deep into the details of the case. He did, however, told him of Morstan’s involvement rather than hiding it as he had initially thought.
They both looked exasperated by the other. Sherlock regarding Lestrade too stupid to be a DI, and Lestrade by the fact that he was dealing with a 5-year-old-man.
Lestrade was the one to quicken the developments. After a month of having practically nothing to go by, and Sherlock not sharing the information regarding the case, he had NSY on his back demanding for results and a full description on the case before it went cold. We needed to finish things as soon as possible. Not only for our sake and safety, but because Lestrade threatened Sherlock on pulling him off the case if things weren’t solved.
‘Yes, but it wasn’t far enough for him not to recognise your mole within the enemy front.’ She shakes her head as if getting rid of something. ‘He’s got amnesia. Fuck! This is just going from bad to worse. Are you alright? Seriously. Both of you. I know you were a bit over a month at the hospital.’
‘Silly me. I’m Mary Morstan. We never got to our Valentine’s dinner because Sherlock, our dashing detective and dear friend here, got himself admitted to a hospital.’ She dropped the bomb he was trying to avoid. ‘Doctors said it was a suicide attempt. Dreadful that, so young and yet so troubled. You and Mycroft had to take turns.’
‘How come I can’t go through?’ Sherlock froze, a contingency plan took form in the few seconds he had before she opened the door and walked into the room as if she owned the place. ‘Oh darling! You finally woke up!’
‘I wasn’t about to leave all the fun to you. To be quite honest I’m tired of having them trying to bite my ankle.’
‘Please. Don’t be an idiot.’ John furrowed his brow bothered by Sherlock’s comment, he immediately tried to fix his mistake by adding ‘no, don’t look like that. Practically everyone is.’
‘I do beg to differ. We are merely acquaintances with a common friend between us.’ He was staring directly at her, defying her. There was little that she could say back if he played his cards properly. She noticed.
‘I met a woman, and before you say anything, she is involved in all of this. The police have the wrong guy because they need him inside. I don’t know why, but he is needed in prison for everything to work.’ He could see that this had gotten Mycroft’s attention, with him and the government things would move smoothly.
His mind was reeling as she spoke. Reality downed on him, he needed time to properly file that information. Harsh times, harsh decisions or something.
It was that very night that Sherlock began to move. He called the remaining 4 members of his network that were in, and sold the information as crucial. As expected, they had someone stalk Wiggins’ every move. Everything was going as planned. Or so we thought.
Second: Sorry for the late update, I'm drowning in schoolwork. I'll try to get a second update this Friday to get back on track with my scheduled updates supposedly to be every Monday, yes today I'm on time although I'm a week behind. it happens.
Hiding a shy smile behind his hand, Sherlock sat straight in his chair before announcing the words he had dreaded for a long time.
‘Well of course he had it already planned! Mycroft never does anything without a purpose. Perhaps he wanted to know if I had indeed stopped completely and could be left alone, but I can’t do anything until I turn 18… John! We have to live together!’
‘Well, it is certainly not my fault that he couldn’t notice that she had just had sex with another man. I saved him the pain of going through the whole ordeal of planning a wedding and then filing a divorce just because your wife decided that she’d rather have him all day home. He still can get the money he spent back.’
'I know that you're on an scholarship and still aren't able to pay for the complete workload. Also that things aren't going well at home, don't worry, sometimes addicts can't be helped. I also know that you are likely to join the RMC just to be able to finish paying and be able to take all your missing subjects. Did I miss anything?'
John couldn’t help but suppress a smirk at that. ‘And how do you propose that happens? What if I have already planned who I wanted to work with?’
How come someone be so oblivious to other’s affection? Molly had been observant, and smart, enough to notice and piece together the puzzle that was unknown and foreign to him. He had John, but to him he was nothing more but a “mate” which apparently, it meant friend to him. In fact, he was his best mate, cursed to stand at the back and observe how he smiled and laughed with her. Women loved John, and now one had been enough something to catch his attention and ask her to be his. John who was unaware that by now he was an extension of Sherlock, just as he saw his family members even though he dreaded to admit it. He was Sherlock’s and he was lenient to share him of let him go.
And it's a wrap! Thank you all for reading it even though it was a bit boring at the beginning. Cheers!
Unable to answer back, his mind made the connection that those were his screams. Everything happened through a haze. Sherlock was pressing down on his shoulder with his whole weight, in his panic he was hurting him without realising that he was doing it. People began gathering, he could barely make out the distressed screams from the neighbours and bystanders who stopped either when the window broke or when he screamed.
‘I wait for the police to leave and break in or cross the line. People don’t notice people if they look like they belong. It’s the best disguise you can ever do. Trust yourself.’
‘He’s just certain that someone will be daft enough to try to kill me before all this mess ends and took matters into his own hands for once. See it this way: we are practically all the time together except for when you have practice and the lessons we don’t have together. Your girlfriend decided to go MIA and hasn’t given any clue as to what is going on, the series of murders stopped, and all of this doesn’t add up to something good. We are either sitting ducks waiting for something bad to happen, or the whole circle of operation decided to move somewhere else. I doubt the latter as we have seen things moving pushing Irene out of the country. No, there’s definitely something going on here.’
Never had he felt so impotent to protect his baby brother. Having him in his arms wailing out in pain made his whole world crumble. He had no power to help him other than holding him in the middle of a dingy waiting room as Sherlock pours his heart to him as they waited news from the surgeons. He had been ready to call out John H. Watson on playing with his brother’s fragile sentiments, but he had never pictured that he’d had to hold Sherlock were he to lose the battle on the table.
Suddenly reality was more of a burden than simple existence and the pass of time. John looked troubled and Sherlock was uncertain of what to do to make it better, it was just a matter of time before the thought strikes him that maybe Sherlock needed him in the dark so that he could gather enough information. He couldn’t expose him like that, it was immediately ruled out.
‘Well, I’d certainly be surprised to know someone with that shade of blonde. I really thought it was from a Labrador or something.’ Laughter filled the room as they kept on joking on the subject. John commenting on the way Sherlock’s brain was wired and Sherlock arguing back on John’s intellectual capacity.
‘John?’ He turned to Irene when he heard her calling his name, her face was somewhat unreadable as she carefully thought her words. ‘Has something happened? You are always right behind Sherlock but never breathless. What happened? You know me. Don’t you? You can trust me.’
‘I knew I’d see you again. You turned on Irene, didn’t you? You’re the whistle-blower so to say. What a surprise to see you Miss Morstan, or should I call you Moran?’ Her smile turned dangerous at the mention of her name. She stood from where she was sitting by the corner and prowled to him as the fearless warrior that she was. No wonder she was so good as a sniper, she sure had a lot of patience.
‘And live somewhere surrounded by idiots? No, thank you, I’d rather have a flat. Come with me to see flats on Friday!’
‘I’m not deaf! Stop talking about me and get her to read the article. It should take her a couple of minutes.’ Came the reply from the kitchen. When John turned around to face him, Sherlock was coming back with a couple of fizzy drinks and a pack of Mycroft’s biscuits.
It was most definitely one of our hardest cases. Sherlock had hit a dead end, Lestrade was getting anxious, NSY was demanding the case to be done, and I was in the middle of everything trying not to go mad.
‘Well yes, are you deaf? I just said I do.’ He was back to exasperated, John considered it a win. He was still moving around adding things to a brew he was doing.
‘She’s been sleeping with someone else. A man going by the number of male products she used for today’s morning routine. She has also been avoiding the dorms. What, if I may ask, is it that you are hiding Miss Morstan?’
The vitals had been spiking announcing activity and doctors and nurses had been taking more rounds as to keep an eye on anything going on. Every time that the nurses got into the room to check after one of the machines beeped, his sister would practically hold her breath until the doctors announced what they saw. It was obvious to Sherlock that Harriet was suspicious about what where his intentions with her brother. Their conversations always turned to John no matter how gruesome was the initial topic, he was constantly on edge trying not to reveal his true feeling to his sister.
‘It’s nothing John. Don’t pay attention to the phone.’ As he said this a second message came through. If a single ping could show urgency, John would say that the message was heavy with it. Dread filled him in an instant as Sherlock looked down and curiosity was evident in his face.
‘Sorry.’ She replied sheepishly after realising that she had zoned out. ‘I don’t think you should keep being my tutor I’ll ask for a change.’
‘No wonder you decided not to show up at school after such an awful weekend. After knowing you both, there’s no question in that Mycroft did it on purpose.’ Said John as soon as Sherlock told him about his weekend. There was a moment when he regretted asking, as he’d rather keep the distance between both brothers and their ongoing war, but knew that Sherlock needed someone to rant his problems.
‘And from what I have seen you will never be. Just trust me when I say that he was planning on waging a war bigger than the world wars. I saw him growing more unstable with every idea and every move, but he totally lost it when Sherlock began to get involved. He was going to use it to manipulate Mycroft in the government. His personal pawn. Didn’t go far there. Adler did an amazing job with giving him tips.’
‘You wouldn’t do that statement unless you were about to disappear.’ He laughed at the idea that she was about to leave the country and all the commodities that she had as of now. He couldn’t picture her in the wild running away from whoever was chasing her.
‘Damn, you sure are smart.’ Said John with an amused grin. ‘How about you hang with me and a couple of friends by lunchtime? We’re not many.’
‘Oh, don’t play coy on me Sherlock Holmes, it’s not a game you’d like to play against me. I could also ask you if you have spoken with John about your sexuality.’
“John. Please! Get some sense into his great, thick skull, because he might be a genius, but this plan is far too much. I really have no wish to explain why there’s now a dead civilian involved.” I could see he was almost defeated. I had no input. As far as I knew, this was the best alternative. Sherlock and I were only commodities; he gave them relevant information, and I was a doctor willing to treat them outside a hospital.
‘Mycroft!’ Screamed he with a broken voice as he saw his brother approach him running down the hall. He had been kept out of the loop on what was going on in the surgery, and the hours ticked by only adding to his distress. ‘Mycroft! Please! Do something!’
‘Be relieved that I’ll take that into consideration brother dear, but do consider that I did promised both our parents that I’d keep you safe and away from danger. I think this qualifies within that scope so I will keep you away from the whole investigation.’ John turned to Sherlock and placed a hand in his shoulder as if to anchor him in the moment, and avoid him jumping into Mycroft and punching him in the face. ‘However,’ added Mycroft immediately sensing what his brother was about to do, ‘I will keep you informed of what is going on through the investigation, and will bring you pieces of information at least once every week. I will talk to Lestrade about this, and you are not to investigate without someone of the police force by your side. Am I clear?’
‘He’s a sergeant at the Met. I send him the answer to his messages when he’s out of depth in a case. I’m sure he’ll be the head of homicides one day. What did the message said? He never writes first. Must be interesting.’
‘So, after you left he wrote a quick message asking if you had a new number, I didn’t know what to say so didn’t reply. Just yesterday he wrote back saying that he needed your help and that he’d be glad to see you at NSY. I think this might be just up your expertise.’
‘It’s the Woman!’ Said Sherlock as an answer to Mycroft’s silent question. It was a text message and it only read: “Don’t listen to anything they say.” Even Mycroft was confused and he was an expert at being cryptic.
Sherlock crawled from under Moriarty’s corpse heaving and with a sick look in his face. John was helping him the moment he got over his shock of Mary shooting someone on the head. It shouldn’t be that much of a surprise as she did try and failed to bring them down.
‘Sherlock? What is it? Are you o.k.? Please tell me you didn’t go chasing down the diamonds burglar.’
‘So, it is true. You and our dear soon to be doctor.’ His smug smile told Sherlock that he had been baited. He fell into his brother’s trap.
‘Sorry, I’ve got a date.’ John was nervous about Sherlock’s reaction to him having a night out with someone that wasn’t him. He was so possessive sometimes, that he wasn’t sure what his reactions would be.
Moriarty’s grin changed from amusement to cruel. Sherlock began wondering if this was his plan all along. ‘Moran, kill John.’
We were allowed into the last crime scene, and later on to the bodies at the morgue. They were all murdered in the same way, and all targets were the lower ranks. All young and naïve individuals who were, perhaps, looking for something exciting to do, or a fast way to make money. I could practically see the connections being made within Sherlock's brain.
‘We met a couple of times, I wanted to make sure that what she was about to tell me was real, and I needed time to study her.’
‘Lestrade, Watson and Holmes, pleasure to finally meet you in person.’ Said Sherlock as a greeting. He left John’s name first for him to ponder on who was who, and perhaps correct him later. It was the evident confusion in Lestrade’s face that made him wonder if the whole situation was all right.
We placed all our bets on Wiggins. He was the only one Sherlock had ever given something akin to a basic training on self-defence. It would be easy to put them on his trail if Sherlock just called him out on his drug usage.
Sherlock decided to end the conversation by paying attention to what was being said by the lecturer. It was a sight John hoped to never see again.
‘Did you go out on your own even when they told you to be escorted at all times?’ he gave Sherlock a suspicious side-glance and fidgeted with his mobile. Sherlock could do little more than return it even though it looked more of a pained grimace. He had just stated that he understood that John had now a girlfriend and that his time was no longer entirely dedicated to Sherlock.
We agreed to meet at the station, as it is somewhat easy to get out of track in within the underground network at rush hours, and from there we walked to the bridge she going out from the BFI exit, and I took the National Theatre one. There was a slight difference, I was a bit behind. She met with a blond in a red coat, even from the distance her frame was familiar. I jumped because she was about to turn because Irene threw me a side glance when she noticed my distress. Any trained killer would know that meant something, I think we’ll find her corpse in a few days.’
‘Come on Sherlock, don’t take it off on her. I know you’re angry at me for not being there when you want me for whatever it is you planned to do after tutoring.’
‘I have terrible taste? It was you who ended almost drowned and with hypothermia from jumping off a bridge.’
This alarmed Lestrade, he immediately tried to make him reconsider. “I think you should really leave it to NSY.”
‘So! First class and you look upset. Everything alright?’ The amount of energy and cheerfulness that John Watson had every morning was sometimes unsettling. In the short time Sherlock had known him, he had never looked upset or down about anything. Perhaps that was about to change.
‘I’m truly sorry John. I know that you wanted to go to the army and be a doctor saving lives even in one of the most impossible scenarios. I took it from you. It was my fault. I got too deep into a case and all of a sudden people were chasing me. I wanted to keep you safe. Maybe if I listened to what you told me…’
‘Why is Mycroft so keen on having me learn how to use firearms?’ They had been sitting at Gordon Square as John felt it necessary to take advantage of the sunny day that are often cherished and treasured in London. Sherlock turns to face him with uncertainty clear on his face, he’s not certain of how to tell him the things that cross his mind, the universes and things that he’s able to see, hear, smell and feel all the time. He’s uncertain on how to tell him that Mycroft sees John just as Sherlock does: an extension of himself.
‘Yes, well. Please, could you text him? Tell him we are out and about just to gather some data. You could add that he shouldn’t stay as late at the office as, apparently, there’s someone out there who’s mildly aware of his schedule.’
'First of all, it's the first day, they'll likely just give us an overview of the program. You missed nothing and, had you completely skipped, are likely to be good as nothing will be covered today. Second, I'm not your "mate", so don't call me "mate." We don't even know each other. Lastly, what was on your mind when you decided to gather your team in the morning if you wanted to make it on time to class?'
‘Inconsequential, I told you everything you need to know regarding the case. I didn’t die so it’s something inconsequential.’ As shock didn’t left John’s face, Sherlock knew that they would be addressing the topic as soon as they were back inside.
‘I just got here! Was it something I said?’ She smiled at John and upon seeing Sherlock’s panic she decided to give them a nudge.
The doctor turned to Sherlock expecting to see a sign that it was true. Harry had to answer instead as Sherlock was somewhat stunned to answer. The doctor eyed him warily as Sherlock sent Mycroft a message with the update on John. He wasn’t sure if this was a good thing or a bad one. John wouldn’t remember Mary and thus putting him out of danger, but he was unaware of other things and that it was his fault for being involved in a case.
‘No, I just thought… well Sherlock and I were talking about a few things and, well, it made me realise that you two have a couple of things to clear between you. Sherlock will know what I’m talking about.’ Having said this, she gathered her things and left wishing them luck and winking at Sherlock.
‘Allow me to clear all the misunderstandings. It never occurred to me that you would ask a proper meeting, so I sent you all the messages through my brother’s phone rather than using mine. Last Friday I asked my friend John Watson to lend me his phone to send you the message. I suppose you didn’t ran the number through the system because it followed the same structure and pattern as the past messages.’ He had his hands behind his back to avoid showing how nervous he was. It didn’t escape John’s notice.
‘The fact that he might not listen to me the moment he sees me!’ came Sherlock’s answer. He was almost screaming. ‘Sorry.’
‘No! Wait!’ He called out and grabbed him by the wrist to halt his frantic movements. It was most certainly not his intention to upset the teen. ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you in any way.’
As things progress, Mycroft allows Sherlock to drop out of the group therapies with the condition that he should enroll into the tutoring programmes.
He turned his whole attention to John. He was still fuming but had somewhat relaxed. Sherlock sat straight and looked him directly in the eye. ‘There are more important matters to be addressed.’
“No, it’s fine. People should know that while I can help them solve their problems, it is you who they need to save their lives.” He gave John a small, fleeting smile, and left the kitchen. “It’ll be back up by tomorrow morning!”
The professor tried to do it quickly, it was obvious to everyone in the room that she preferred not to go through this. ‘I’m truly sorry about the intrusion.’ She said with a sense of finality. He could see it on her actions that she’d rather never do this at all. Go through a student’s bag at the beginning of the session right in the prejudicial sight of everyone attending. Silence was ominous, he sat on his stool rather embarrassed of the whole affair.
John’s expression turned into one of curiosity, he began to wonder what had he endure to be like that. ‘I just… you’re not even 20. How old are you?’
‘Sherlock?’ John noticed Sherlock giving a sideways glance to his mobile without answering back. He got suspicious as to who was contacting him as he always replies even if it is just to tell Mycroft to “kindly piss off.”
A blast from his right gave her enough cover for her to retreat. He was on his own against whoever came his way.
‘Yes, thank you for your input. So, I was thinking on getting a head start and begin an experiment or two.’ By the time he turned to John, John was eyeing warily the assortment of different chemicals, reactants, pipettes, two Bunsen burners, several flasks and 4 Petri dishes. Everything was cluttered around the table, a messy display of glass that was warily balanced on the edges.
‘I’m afraid I don’t know. She must know someone as she was the one to warn us and to stay away. She left on her own the next morning.’
John was rendered silent and his books were forgotten at his side. They had been keeping up with school work, but he had to agree that it was one thing to relax for a moment and have some peace, and another thing to be unaware of what was going on. After being so in contact with Sherlock he began seeing for himself how things were constantly on the move and people were either too daft to notice or involved. According to Mycroft “the universe is ever so lazy” when things come down to coincidences. Mary had appeared in his life after they were brought into the investigations, and Adler only decided to flee after the whole drama at the hospital and Mary’s disappearance. Sherlock was right, something was undoubtedly going on without them being aware of it.
‘So, it was you who was murdering the PA’s.’ John stated in a silent tone which spoke tonnes to Sherlock, he just hoped they would take it as someone naïve discovering the “dark side” of a beloved one. After all, they did date for a while, and Sherlock never mentioned that she was the murderer.
‘Well, there’s a clear message to you. You have to see it and call your brother as soon as possible.’ Resignation and a plea to hurry. The call was cut then and he got the address almost instantly, she had already written the message, she wanted to make sure that she had his number rather than his brother’s. That was the logical reason for the call. He was already picturing the situation. Indeed Mycroft would get involved either they wanted him to or not.
Long chapter! I was going to add more things but thought this was enough. I also needed some things left unsaid.
‘I’m telling you that you have a terrible taste in woman and that miss Morstan will have to be dismissed from your life.’ He tried to remain cold and calculated even though it felt like swallowing lead.
“One day I’ll just punch you in the face.” Said John as he retrieved his charger and came back to sit at his desk. He wanted to wrap the case as soon as possible.
'That was brilliant! I had never seen someone draw information in such a way. How did you do it? Oh, sorry, I don't even know if you have other classes. Nice to meet you...'
By the end, Sherlock was on his feet and walking towards Mary as a feline stalking its prey. She gave him a scowl and left almost as a wounded animal. Sherlock was preening before he turned to see John’s expression.
John’s statement made them both giggle. They remained in silence for a moment basking in each other’s company. No words were needed between them, they just had to be in the presence of the other to feel safe and complete. Because all the time Sherlock spoke to John, he was missing something to make him alive. Without the other they just existed, they drifted through the world without a care of what happened around. Pointless.
“Be nice, things are about to go bonkers.” He could only roll his eyes at the message before all hell broke loose.
John couldn’t avoid but smile at him. ‘Come on, you’re brilliant. It’s amazing being so close to you… there’s always something to do or see. If people could just see the world as you do.’
I was certain that Lestrade was trying to get some other plan that didn’t involved placing someone on the line. Everything could go wrong.
‘He sent me to a counselling group session.’ This surprised John, but he was also aware that it was a sore topic.
Hello, sorry that this chapter is a bit confusing. I tried to summarise the whole term in a couple of lines. I also wanted soome information to come through. It's kind of my holidays special. I hope you enjoy it.
‘Well just lend me your name and I’ll pay the rent.’ Said Sherlock while sitting down. John could see a sulk coming but decided to ignore it for a moment.
‘I think he just wanted you to deal with me. Before you arrived, he was a bit more than exasperated and left me here to read.’
‘Sorry. Sorry, it’s just a bit not good. How did you managed to get that glove?’ Sherlock smiled at this.
‘How do you know all that?’ Panic rising, and Sherlock about to describe his deductions couldn’t possibly end well. As soon as Sherlock smirked, John knew he had to keep him from talking.
Saturday couldn’t come fast enough, but when it did Sherlock was perched in his room window waiting for John. He couldn’t care less about things needing to be ready or food. Even his parents had tried to encourage him to play the violin instead of just sitting by his room’s window with the lights off. That is until he saw John walking down the street, he opened the door before he could ring the bell.
John has been a constant in Sherlock’s life like only his parents have been. He’s glad that even after a couple of months, he was still with him even in his crazy ideas. Mycroft had been sceptical at the beginning, so much he had warned John after he had screamed ’10 Temple street!’ to the taxi driver. He was excited to finally have someone to present as his friend.
‘And WHAT is so funny that you are trying so hard not to laugh?’ It was that statement and Sherlock’s look that did him. He was laughing so hard that it took him a moment to notice that Sherlock was stuffing what reactants he could into his bag.
“Piss off Sherlock. It's none of your business.” Said John while looking for his charger within the cluster Sherlock had dropped on his desk.
‘Bloody hell mate! I’d thought you’d be a squeaking tadpole!’ Sherlock couldn’t help but blush at the comment.
‘Sherlock?’ Molly’s voice brought him back from his reverie once again. He smiled at her before signalling that they should keep on moving.
By the end of the month Sherlock had enough information on the main 5 suspects and was beginning to develop a plan to uncover the true culprit. It is just as Sherlock to leave us in the darkness while he’s plotting and on the move.
He turned to look straight forward and didn't dare to turn back to "John" rugby captain. The class couldn't end fast enough. He just wanted to be out of there. Away from everything. But time decided to take it slow, and his mind decided to go over the whole conversation. Never had someone reached to him, and now that someone did his first reaction had been to hiss at him.
‘If you know what’s best for you, you will let the kids leave Professor.’ They all turned to see Mycroft entering the room through the same path taken by Mary. Sherlock had never been so happy to see his brother and, to both his delight and chagrin, Lestrade following right behind. ‘Did you really thought I’d leave my brother unprotected?’
Not pretty words to hear about yourself all the time, or to have yourself rejected over and over without an explanation other than a few insults.
Then there was a silence, and Mycroft rubbed circles on Sherlock's back, something he had read, was useful to calm people down.
', "and post it. It will be an excellent way to tell your story to the public without having to expose you at all." Mycroft hummed, expressing his approval and satisfaction.
"She's my sister too," You continue. "We cannot just abandon her like that. And it's not her fault that she's like that."
He couldn't go inside, so he went to an alleyway near it, which was narrow and deserted, sitting on the ground and leaning against the building of Baker Street.
You say it so softly, I am not sure if You actually said it, and so I turn to look at you, to make sure I am not imagining things.
John sighed audibly, thinking that he should have known that this was coming and then, ruefully thought to himself, that didn't know a lot of things regarding the people around him these days.
“Very well. Now I suppose you would like to do a waltz. Now of course, there are many styles, some are more complicated, but with enough practice--” “Sherlock,” John cut him off, “We’re doing the final dance rehearsal tomorrow. I was hoping you would teach me something simple.”
John had never admitted it out loud. Never even fully thought about it in his head, it was too painful to think about. He remembered Mycroft asking Sherlock a similar question. "So who loves you? Assuming it's not a long list." And John had frozen then, afraid that his wildly beating heart would have given away the answer.
"Sherlock, the media, once you face it, will bombard you with questions that neither of you are ready to answer, and I do not intend on our cover blowing so quickly. We are trying to publicise a romance and not a scandalous affair." John was surprised he didn't hear retching noises from the other end-- Mycroft had enough acid in his voice when he'd said 'romance'.
Hated that while Sherlock had saved his life the day he met him, John had only given him pain since then. He wished that they wouldn't have had to face such pain, he wished Sherlock wouldn't have had to feel it, he wished--
Finally, they reached a room, and after a retinal scan, a voice issued from the panel next to the door, "Enter voice key."
John had half a mind to rouse him from his sleep and demand answers, but realised that Sherlock was in deep sleep and the bastard never got much rest anyway.
Was it all that bad? Perhaps he could let himself have this, just this once. After all, when it would end, they would go their own separate ways, and he would never have the opportunity, so it would be safe.
I knoooooow it's been long I'm so sorry, but here are two chapters to compensate, and stuff will be moving a lot quicker now,, I solemnly promise! So they kissed, it was nice. Anyways the Woman is here, is that not nice?
"Oh," Sherlock said, hurt, not having expected his perfectly good intentions to backfire so hard. "I will refrain from interfering again."
Cameras went off at a wild rate as they pushed their way through the crowd to a car parked not a metre away from them. People shouted their names, shouted questions to grab their attention. Someone shouted homophobic slurs from behind them, but there was no time to react to any of it.
"Does it make you uncomfortable John?" He asked, earnest, as he cocked his head to the side. "Mary had called earlier, asking if we were still practicing. Was horrified to know we'd been 'apart a whole night," Sherlock rolled his eyes, still very much cornering John. "She sent me a few websites to look at for a study in intimacy, I found this pose quite frequent and recognised as a form of intimacy. Mary said I should give them all a try. So, going back to the original question, does this make you uncomfortable?"
Sherlock Holmes was a very complex man. He had many antiques and just as many redeeming qualities, though situations often turned out to be such that one forgot all his plus points in the face of the one atrocious thing he would do.
Both men instinctively reached out for her, but John checked Sherlock in his tracks with an outstretched arm signalling him to stop and went to attend to Rosie. Sherlock's lower lip quivered but he said nothing. Then, silently, he moved to his bedroom door and John knew why.
I suppose that is our bond. We understand each other like no one else does. We see the weakness, the pain, when it's hidden.
The harsh illumination of the tube light flooded the small room, and in it, stood John-- frozen, with his hair not a warm golden under the light, but a sickly bright white.
His fingers clicked away at the keyboard for an hour, partly because there was so much to write about, and partly because John was a slow typist: he pressed one key at a time with his index finger, and anyone who thought that was comical could go fuck themselves.
“John,” Mrs Hudson said softly, immediately sensing something wrong, “Is everything okay between you two? Was it something I said?”
“Any time. Okay then, let us begin. Now John, we’ll first practice without music, then with. Even by your intelligence we should be fine in a few attempts.” He stood up, and moved the chairs out of the way, and made enough space for them to waltz, provided that they didn’t move around very much. John, who was only too familiar with the insults that Sherlock made in passing, brushed off the attack on ‘his intelligence’ easily.
Because sometimes I see you clearly. Without all the walls, all the facades, or tricks. That is what I love the most about you. It's easy to overlook your moments of arrogance, rudeness or eccentricity when you think about these. Eccentric you still are, but the arrogance and rudeness has mellowed down. You started to show people you care about them. You thank me often, smile at me, and you look at me like you understand me.
And this shouldn't be enough for anyone to forgive the other, it shouldn't be an adequate apology. But it's you Sherlock. With you everything is different. And so I do, Sherlock. I forgive you. Just like that.
He continued. "And until it is absolutely necessary, do not attempt to talk to your own past self. And if the need arises-I do not think that I should have to tell you- but do not tell him anything about the future that's important. Am I understood?"
John himself was leaning against the kitchen counter, and Sherlock with his arms around John's waist and face merely inches above his own. Had John ever mentioned the sheer amount of colours in Sherlock's irises?
And suddenly, as if a thought had pushed him off the edge, he began sobbing, tears silently streaming down his face. Mycroft walked closer and put his hand on Sherlock's shoulders, because they weren't the type of siblings to indulge in intimate contact, such as embracing, were they?
He remembered the blood pouring from Sherlock's chest, not more than a few years later, those few seconds in the hospital where John thought he would lose him again. Mary had shot Sherlock so that John wouldn't know.
Before he could say anything further though, Sherlock budged in, now eyeing her with some suspicion and, much to John's irritation, said somewhat bluntly, "Why are you here?"
"Oh John," she spoke in the way of explaining a simple thing to a child, "you loved him the day we met. You loved him when we were together. You loved him when he came back. You loved him when we married. And you love him even now John. You always have." She chuckled sadly, as if at her own fate.
Mycroft led him down many corridors and doors, so that John stopped keeping track of the way back, and left his safety in the hands of fate. Plus, he was pretty sure he could overpower Mycroft easily if he wanted to.
I know I've come outta hiding after a long time. But recently I had a lot of projects piling up and I now that I had time, well, I wrote up two chapters and intend to write it all the way to the end, YAY
John finally comes to Sherlock with his case, all the while trying to hide the thoughts stirring up within his brain. And heart.
After five long seconds, they drew back from each other, softer than before. Slowly, John opened his eyes, noticing they hadn't moved much further apart, drinking in how Sherlock looked up close after being kissed.
For a moment, you are silent, and I know you're thinking of those dark days. And then you look at me and smile, the corners of your eyes crinkling.
Sherlock still refused to meet John's eyes. "Sherlock, look at me." At this, Sherlock slowly looked at John, and John could see the fear in his eyes. "Sherlock, it's okay," his voice was soothing. "You can be Rosie's dad. I don't mind. The only thing that matters is, do you want it? Do you want to be Rosie's dad?"
And so John talked and talked and talked, not stopping even after he was out of breath and his mouth dry from use and tears streaming down his cheeks.
The incriminating bottle and the documents that many labours had been undertaken for were left behind, Sherlock reasoned, due to the horror of having taken his father-in-law’s life, and appropriately Mr McArthy left in a haze of panic.
His eyes flew open, a moan escaping out of his mouth that sounded so surprised that it came out as a yelp.
But isn't that how you're wired Sherlock? Whomever you meet is destined yo fall in love with you. It's inevitable. Like death, perhaps. Perhaps it's not you, it's us who is wired that way. Because you never loved me Sherlock. Not like that. Not the way I loved you. But that's okay, Sherlock. I understand. You love John. And I , Tom, I suppose. But did I tell you that one other thing?
It was, in fact, the things they hadn’t said that had angered them, and they knew that, but neither could summon their courage to speak about it.
Mary handed them a few sheets that they were supposed to fill out later, along with a non-disclosure contract stating the terms John had already agreed to with Mycroft. Frankly, John was surprised it had taken the older Holmes so long.
Do all that, and if Sherlock ever looked up from whatever he was doing to analyse his movements, John Watson would put up a breezy, casual look on his face, pretending his heart wasn't slipping further and further into something very dangerous.
His eyes flitted to Sherlock's hair, dark brown curls, and he remembered them matted with blood, his porcelain skin tarnished with the dark red. He knew it wasn't real, but the image haunted him all the same.
“Do you think the son-in-law tried to drug him with these?” John asked Sherlock, as they surveyed the reports.
My boys are doing famously, those idiots. And John did try to hide his confession, but was he successful?
The next morning, they woke up a little later than usual-- Harry feeling drained yet a lot better; and John with an aching back from the couch. He had not slept too well, as he stayed up quite a bit after the phone call with Sherlock.
As Rosie looked on at him silently, with a toothless smile that said that she knew what was in his mind, he said to himself, albeit not without some fear: He wanted to marry John Watson.
"That's good." Sherlock's hands were getting fidgety, and Mary looked at them, her expression softening and then said gently, "Hey there's no need to worry. It will be quite natural. Look--You know what, let's do one right now. John, scoot closer to him."
John snorted at this, and settling a hand on his waist, pulled him gently saying, "Well, you don't really need them, though I daresay you could use some practice."
And so they fought over who had to pick up Rosie from daycare when they were on a case, or why Sherlock couldn’t take Rosie along for cases.
His eyes were both energetic due to the cocaine, and tired, a slight stubble had grown on his cheeks, there were lines beginning to develop under his eyes, they were getting heavier.
She interrupted him, "No John, I never meant that you didn't love me. You did. You were faithful to me that way, if not in the others," she spoke with full awareness of the sting in her statement. In this one, John deserved it, " You still love me. That is why I am here today. But the greatest tragedy remains John, that you always loved him a little more."
"To err-- check on you."' John fumbled a bit before solidifying his certainty. "I'm here to check on you." It wasn't much, but he hoped it was enough.
Do you remember Sherlock, when you said I was the one that mattered the most. That Moriarty had gotten it wrong. I was the one who had made it all possible. Your eyes looked so soft Sherlock, I thought you might have kissed me then and there, right on the lips. I would have let you Sherlock. Let you kiss me, just that once, maybe more than once if you would have wanted it. I loved you then. I still love you. I think I have always loved you.
John took in a sharp breath at this, his eyebrows rising rapidly in a split second, before knitting together angrily.
Sherlock and John go on the date,  have a quick detour and just pine after each other the whole time.
“Oh, so now Rosie isn’t ideal for your lifestyle. Maybe one day I won’t be ideal for your lifestyle as well. Want to get rid of me too?”
"I don't know, Mycroft. I don't know why I am sad. It's John's wedding, and he has a wife, and I should be happy, play the role of a best friend."
I settle down in one of the chairs. But for anyone who sees it, it will be empty. Even John. He's stopped seeing me. They're just shadows of me in his mind. Right now, I am a shadow of myself. But I came back today, John. You brought me back. You wanted me here. I feel a little happy. You remembered me. Anyway, John, this is a wonderful place. A wonderful place to get married. Better than ours, I seem to think. But that's just me being jealous. I don't really know why I am jealous. I made a choice when I jumped in front of Sherlock, that day. When I took the bullet for him, quite literally. I knew it then, too. That this was bound to happen. That you two were bound to happen.
With slow, deliberate motions, John stroked circles on Sherlock's head, taking his time to feel the soft texture of the hair.
His eyes were still closed, a faint pink tinging his cheekbones and ears, lips parted-- beautiful as always, like all things unearthly and divine. John clenched his other hand, curbing the bizarre urge to kiss the man again. Of course, this was just a normal reaction to kissing someone, he wasn’t gay or anything. After all, he’d kissed so many women, and this was the only man he’d kissed. What about Adam? echoed in his mind, and with a shake of his head he sent it away.
Sherlock interlocked their fingers, and tried to calm down his firing neurons. Holding their hands up, he stood a little straighter, as did John, and they both stood a little uncomfortably, not used to this position or proximity.
He looked down, half in a daze, at the halo that his hair had made as the dim lights fell upon it, his hands clutching, desperate, at the taller man's robe.
A savage thought had entered his brain, that Sherlock might now feel a fraction of the pain he had given John when he jumped off the roof and the wave of self hatred that followed engulfed John and rendered him mute.
Anyway, John and Sarah are slowly coming to terms with their sort of failed marriage. In a way, I believe that there was a chance they could have somehow salvaged their marriage, but with Sherlock there ,even that chance will be gone.
They were very beautiful, the pupils large, dilating almost hungrily as they consumed the turquoise irises. Sherlock was studying his reaction intently. In fact, this seemed the general mood he had today: dissecting John Watson with large cat-like eyes.
"No dear. She's someone else." Mrs Hudson replied and, turning to the staircase, called the said Agent upstairs.
By the time he was finished he was actually quite drowsy, as if all the pouring out had left him empty and tired. And therefore it was not with all the awareness that should have been there, that he clicked on the "Publish" button.
He once again adjusted his glasses and cap, a disguise he hadn't removed simply because it felt wrong, somehow, that Sherlock should see his face properly, that he'd know that it was John here, despite the fact that Sherlock did not know who he was yet.
Mary. A nice name for what sounded like a nice girl. "That will do just fine, thanks Mary." John said with a small laugh.
"It's not an addiction!" Sherlock growled, his nostrils flared, " I only use it for intellectual stimulation and I can stop
He had had experiences with de-addiction before, like he had for Harry, his sister. It suddenly struck him he hadn't told her about this whole fiasco and that she'd find out from the papers. He felt bad about it, but then the feeling subsided when he remembered that
A yearning would spread through his chest, as he suddenly caught sight of the detective, and his fingers would twitch-- wanting, inexplicably to draw the man in front of him closer, to touch him. The feeling would sway in him, though not very potent, and John would be left distracted, not meeting Sherlock's eyes, his voice straining to appear normal as he tried to banish the thoughts from his brain. Trying to pretend they'd never crossed his mind.
John was taken aback by the bitter misery in Sherlock's eyes. But before anything else, John looked at Sherlock for signs of drugs. Sherlock had promised that he wouldn't use anymore. For John. For Rosie. He felt extremely relieved at not finding any, but was still startled by the helplessness and melancholy in Sherlock's eyes. He could think of no reason for it, but it diminished his anger a little, and he asked gently, "Are you okay? Look, I already told you that you can be Rosie's father too, if you want. And it's okay if you don't want to. I understand that--"
Just as John and Sherlock were feeling the relief of having crossed the bridge without burning it, Mary stepped forward and patted their shoulders. "Round two please. And this time don't jerk away like you've been electrocuted when you do it. Ta mates."
At ten thirty, when John had just finished taking a bath and was about to continue his part of the research on Moriarty, and Sherlock still in his t-shirt and dressing-gown, Mrs Hudson came up to announce that another one of Mycroft's agents had arrived.
"The thing you said, at the end of the second recording?" John asked, puzzled, "You said you loved him."
But he seemed to understand, when he looked at her, as if he knew what was going on in her mind, and wanted to tell her it was okay.
Yesss I added a lot of fluff because they were having a rough time before, and things are just gonna get better for like a chapter more!!!
Then, John stroked Sherlock's hair softly as he laid his head onto the headrest of the couch, and let sleep lull him into safety.
John was confused, because he could not find anything to say to her. Was it true? He questioned himself.
Rosie walked daintily down the aisle with a little basket of light yellow rose petals, that did brilliant job of going along with the light blue of her gown, which she took care didn't make her stumble. After all, this was the wedding of the best dads in the world. Behind her, supervising the child was Molly, who affectionately looked on as Rosie excitedly threw rose petals around, leading up to the end where John and Sherlock stood waiting. This elicited a lot of 'oohs' and 'aahs' as Rosie charmed her way down the aisle, stealing the hearts of everyone in the room.
And yet John Watson, among his many qualities, was a man who could be relied upon in times of stress. He was calm, reassuring to those patients whom he treated and dangerous to those who threatened to harm.
And then, once he had read the shock on Mycroft's face, and the little tinge of disapproval, he turned once again, to the windows, and resumed playing.
The statement was meant to comfort him, persuade himself to take up this one opportunity, but instead it hit him like a blow to the stomach.
John tried to imagine leaping forward and taking her lips in his, but inevitably, no matter how many times he tried, as soon as he reached her lips they became cupid bow shaped, and when he closed his eyes all he could see was a certain consulting detective lying with his head on John's lap, hair fanned out, eyelashes fluttering gently.
Sherlock struggled to free himself from John's grip, but abandoned it soon, knowing that it was useless. Instead, he stared firmly into John's eyes. How longer would the ruse work? How long until John would know the truth?
Also, yup, Sherlock is having a blast, John is beginning to be slightly jealous of the other John. And HELL. That's a fucking dangerous combination.
He walked to the outside of the hall, all the while wondering how he had become so lucky? Lucky enough to be able to look into the beautiful eyes of Sherlock Holmes, and see the love that he held for him reflected back. Lucky enough to meet a man who could read his mind and heart. A man with whom he'd gone through hell, a man who'd shown him heaven.
The car sped off, and John didn't even bother to see where, knowing it was another secluded basement or parking lot.
Tears run down my face. I sob. I don't know what to do. I want to thank you, John, for everything that you said. But I don't know what my parents think now. In times like these I hate myself. Hate myself, for being. This. What I am. A failure.
He took in a deep breath, his knees folding up and his arms wrapped around them, his body exhausted, even scared, wanting protection and release from all the pressure.
Warmth floods my chest. Even though I know that it was your fever talking, for a split second I savour the feeling of what it means. It feels wonderful, and I turn to look at you in the dim light of the room. It glows a little as the golden light falls on your face. There is an innocence to your face, one that you always had. It's not the innocence of the naive, but of the powerful, the untouchable. And yet the calmness on your face as you sleep is childlike. For a moment, I am taken aback. Your face has no trace of the cold, calculating mind that you like to show everyone, for now it looks tired, vulnerable. I smile because it is then that I realize who you truly are.
They came with all their usual might, overwhelming and fast and dark and all consuming, and he woke up panting, hand already searching for a gun, then took a few deep breaths, and sobbed for all it was worth. He was glad Sherlock wasn't around to witness the spectacle. He couldn't sleep properly that night afterwards.
, that you might employ to get the information you want, but sometimes, they're, um, a bit…" John looked about for words that were softer than "traumatising" and "terrorising".
Not the best words of encouragement one could give, but Sherlock nodded, looking slightly more relaxed. John smiled at him, they nodded at each other, and then John opened the door.
No, he decided, this was one thing that would remain. He didn't know why. But it was imperative to some part of his consciousness.
There were times when they, leaning against he headboard of John's bed, tried to get Rosie to sleep, the three of them ending up sleeping together, curled up around each other.
This time however, I have to thank my newly found beta Vanshikakumar for making my work so much more easier with her help and awesome suggestions!!!!! You can find her on the link below >>>
Far in front of her stood Sherlock and John, both of whom where grinning madly, and as their eyes alternated between resting on Rosie and each other, everyone could see two things quite clearly: one, that they were immensely proud of their daughter, and two, that they were deeply, passionately in love with each other. As Rosie finished her detour, she was met with hugs from both her parent.
"Nothing, it's just that I am happy for you." I take a deep breath, and see Mrs Hudson step back, out of the corner of the eye. "And I wanted to thank you-- for believing in me."
His face contorted into disgust. "Mycroft. Talk about the devil." He said to John accusingly, as if John was to blame for this.
All the reasons he had to separate them both were slowly disintegrating to irrelevance, and John was beginning to want to fuck all of it and this brought on an onslaught of emotions.
He probably doesn't even know it yet, or else he's too good at hiding it. My money is on the former.
What they feared, was the possibility of the other apologizing to them. Even so, it would have been an acknowledgement- acceptance of the fact that it had occurred. But it would be brushing it off, as though what had happened was a mistake- what had happened was far from being a mistake, both knew- and they wouldn’t bear it to be so. Sherlock, in his newly found state, was blank, and stood looking at John stupidly- if the word could ever have been used as an attribute for him.
Utterly devoid of energy, determination, or any form of willpower, he lay there a few more minutes before it occurred to him that his phone should carry no mark of his having used it.
, as your name is now becoming publicly known. If you were to check your blog now there is a steady torrent of people commenting how
Before you leave, I see your eyes for a moment, glistening in a stray ray of light. They're angry and hurt. And not looking at me, as if you were unable to.
Sherlock was sitting on his arm chair, with Rosie in his hands,.playing with her. He tickled her chin, and grinned as she giggled. John had kneeled near them both, and grabbing Sherlock's head, placed a kiss on his forehead. All of them were happy. They were a family.
"Do we need to have this conversation?" Sherlock's voice was bored, deliberately so, like a rebellious teenager not wanting a telling off from his parents.
I haven't stopped loving you Sherlock. I never will. It's just that it doesn't sting anymore. Not even today, seeing you with John, happier than you were ever before. I don't feel jealous anymore.
"Or perhaps," Mycroft said, surprised that his brother was so oblivious, "He heard you. It was just too late."
You look, lighter. As if you have been freed, like a load was lifted off your back. You seem more carefree, not like someone who is sure of not getting hurt, but of someone who is brave enough to take the risk of getting hurt. You seem younger, and stronger than before. Sherlock Holmes has changed you for the better, then. He is a strange man, that fellow. But in a nice way. He has eyes that look like they can see though everything. But somehow, they're reassuring too, like your secret is safe with him. He smells like danger, and adventure. I can see why you like him.
Sherlock meets the Doctor and Detective from the other universe, as does Rosie, and finally, the decision is taken.
“If I could teach you how to.” Completed Sherlock. He smiled indulgently, “Yes, with your gait and manner of holding yourself, I did deduce you had two left feet.”
You pout at this, as if being subjected to some great injustice. Ah, you always have a flair for the dramatic, don't you? I put my hand on the doorknob, and am about to turn it, when you quitely say to me,
"Well, if we have to maintain the ruse, I have to be updated with it as well. And your comments about me being 'charming' are rather interesting."
"Umm, okay, I'll sleep on a mattress on the floor then." John said, and really, Sherlock couldn't object. They were practically strangers last night and this was too much to ask of either of them.
There was a fear in his eyes that made John want to take his face in his hands, and rub the lines of worry away.
John couldn't help it. He burst into a fit of giggles, making it last longer than was strictly necessary, just to make Mycroft's scowl even deeper.
"Else," his voice was grave, like a judge declaring a death sentence, "If you love him enough, Sherlock, ensure that he and Mary lead a happily married life. It is the greatest, and perhaps, the last chance to express your love for him."
"Here," Harry handed it back to him with annoyance all over her features, "and tell your boyfriend to quit nosing around in others' business."
Sherlock and John watched quietly as the Sherlock holding Rosie disappeared behind the door with the child, and then reluctantly turned to each other. They weren't ready for this. For being wiped out of existence. Not yet.
Irritation clouded Mycroft's features as he said, "Get yourself together Sherlock! It's a choice you've made, and you have to face its consequences."
Like the time when John found Sherlock and Rosie in the bathroom, in an extremely adorable position. Sherlock was giving a bath to Rosie, and squatting down near the bathtub, his shirt, which was a beautiful aubergine, whose sleeves were rolled up to show his shapely arms. Rosie was in the tub with foam all around her, playing gleefully, while and exasperated Sherlock tried to bathe her. Then, with a joyous squeal, she started splashing around in the water, foam flying everywhere, and by a fortunate coincidence, a little bit fell squarely on Sherlock's nose.
Sherlock cocked his head to one side, not as much quizzically as it was scrutinizing and John shifted a bit, uncomfortable, but making a pretty good show of being, largely, at ease.
At this Sherlock took a step back. John's arms fell limply to his sides, and Sherlock said. "John, I--I. I am going out." His voice was apologetic and urgent. Grabbing his coat and scarf, he dashed out of the flat. Rosie began crying. Trying to pacify her, John rocked her back and forth, thinking about what had just happened. Through all of this, he had not properly registered what had happened. All be knew was that when Rosie had called Sherlock dada, a warm glow had spread all over John's body. John wondered what it would be like if Sherlock became Rosie's dad. What would they be then, a family? A vision swam into John's head.
He took a deep breath, his eyes shut for a moment, and then said, “If Rosie and I are a burden to you, if we have reduced you to this state, then I think we should leave.”
It was a perfect metaphor. A man on trial, waiting for death or life. Death, it seemed, was the final verdict, beyond negotiation.
"What is the matter, John? Does this," his hands gestured to them both, "bother you? I'm so sorry, John. I have offended you by this, haven't I? I shouldn't have tried to-do forgive me, John."
"Please don't use, Sherlock. Try, at least, to let go of it." There was a pleading edge to his tone though he'd not surrendered the calm in his voice. He walked closer to Sherlock, only a few steps, to emphasize his point. There was now a distance of one feet separating them.
The chaos that he'd awoken to in the morning had completely put out of his mind the blog entry he'd made. Oh god,
The latter held on, fingers deliberately brushing John's neck in a gentle caress, playing with his collar indecisively, reaching beneath it,  and then retreating in a flash, leaving John wanting for more.
John didn't want him to persist with his bad mood, so he tried to change the topic. "Sherlock, you were saying something about the man with the binoculars?"
Then, once he saw the accident occur in front of him. Satisfied, he waved a taxi and went to St Bart's.
"Mary, I--" John couldn't explain why he'd done what he did, embarrassed at having recoiled like this. And yet, he realised, if they were to try again he would still behave the same way.
And yet, a voice in his head said, you and Sherlock met each other even when there was no Mike, even when you tried to prevent it.
He hadn't been expecting going to Mycroft's office, but it wasn't too surprising. It was perhaps, John thought, a measure of the seriousness of the situation, that he was brought here.
, John thought and remembered just how long it had been since they'd last talked besides empty 'How are you's and 'Fines'.
Looks like you've been on a date for the first time in a long time, John, I think. Obviously I don't say it out loud. But it's easy to tell, really. You have dressed up a little more than people usually do, and you seem nervous. I feel a twinge of pride knowing that I am your first in some time. You sit down, and try to give me a confident smile. I wonder what is it that's kept you out of all this. I think it must be a breakup. She must have been someone very special, I guess. It's a nice little cafe, I observe, with low voices talking to each other in the early evening. Sunlight filters through the windows, and it hits your hair, making it glow with a golden colour. I want to run my fingers through them. As you get settled in, you give me an apologetic smile. "Sorry I am late."
‘So, was this because a case?’ Sherlock turned completely to see him. For the first time John could see the scars left from when they jumped.
‘Not a problem, I had the same problems. Let me take a look at it, for all the things Sherlock knows social skills are most definitely not his strong suit.’
‘John! I’m thrilled to see you so early in the morning when the room is still empty and the rest of the idiotic simpletons that share this space with us haven’t arrived.’ His excitement could be felt from the hallway.
‘Yes, her height fits. The only reason why someone would like to get everyone’s attention to someone else is because there’s a bigger target. I think they were all targets and someone knows the pattern’s there. The next target is likely relieved that the murderer was caught. Everything is made as to throw everyone out of the trail. We’re being lured into looking the other way. Don’t you see? This is likely of national security, and no one knows about it because no one’s really looking.’
“Let’s just say something didn’t went as expected.” Came the answer from the kitchen. He was holding a cable and had a guilty smile. It wasn’t often that John saw such expression, so he tried to calm down before asking what was going on.
Perhaps John was just like him, not a proper genius considering that he was still doing his undergraduate programme to become a doctor. Although not everyone was well off economically as his family was.
‘You know it will take him a while to let you back on the cases, don’t you? Especially after you chased away his girlfriend.’ Said John as an explanation to his current situation.
As it turned out, in the month we had been working as a branch to the gang, the flow of corpses decreased considerably. Even those with low ranks began to relax, and attributed the attacks to rivals and street fights gone wrong. We gathered that the victims were constantly starting fights, and either drunk or high.
‘Who are you?’ The question felt alien in his lips. It was so easy to see through everyone and when he needed it the most, he felt barren. Finding the words turned into a chore, but keeping whoever was talking to John had to feel in control of the situation. John always said there was a way out, he just had to find it.
Molly could see the tension coming from Sherlock. It was obviously not his strong topic, and being unable to work around the task was causing him anxiety. Being unable to predict how society worked instantly ruled out Sherlock as a tutor for social sciences that were analysing the impacts and causes of situations. She understood that in his mind wars were nothing but a nuisance, and a problem that could be avoided if people “just observe what is so obvious as to avoid situations.”
‘Hey! How was your weekend? Why the long face?’ Asked John as a greeting the moment he saw Sherlock from his own desk.
‘Fine, you go out with her. I still must see Molly in the afternoon as she keeps having issues. I don’t know why she even enrolled in the course if she can’t do the things that are asked, or understand what is being said.’
That’s when he saw it. His name had been carved on the man’s chest before he died. He could see the rough patterns that signalled a struggle, the man was conscious and alive when the wounds were inflicted. He could only suppose that in the end he blacked-out because of the pain he had to endure to get such ragged lacerations. The knot on the rope and his grin indicated that he tried to warn about something to his murderers, because there was no way this had been a one-man job.
‘No I can’t,’ she lowered her gun and took a step back, ‘I don’t have another choice. I need your help.’
As he sent the message, they were rushing out the door into the street. John could just try to catch up with Sherlock even in his somewhat weakened state and badly tied trainers. Something important was happening and it was up to him to catch up to them rather than fall behind. They arrived at the temple at the corner, and John finally could place a face to The Woman.
John was fidgeting awkwardly in his chair. Sherlock could do nothing but laugh at this and decided to put him out of his misery. ‘You don’t have to give me explanations. I understand people don’t belong to me contrary to whatever Mycroft told you about me. You have a girlfriend, and I wanted to keep on with the investigation. I found a lead and now all I have to do is piece it all together.’
‘I have no reason to disclose my name to someone who may or may not decide to do a living hell out of my existence.’ This was it. This was his whole problem, now everything made sense in John’s mind. If he was this smart, a proper genius if he was honest, there was no way others wouldn’t pester him.
John stared at the black monitor. He had been working hours on writing down all his notes for the case and start writing something akin to a structured story.
When the professor announced the end of the lesson, he couldn't dash fast enough out the door. In fact, with everyone standing and moving things or asking to their peers about their schedules, he was again approached by John. 'Hey!' called out John from somewhere behind him, 'wait up, please!'
‘I wouldn’t expect the universe to give us just about enough time to gather our wits. I’ve been rereading the notes you gave me on the things that have happened since the last thing I remember, and thought that whoever is behind feels like a Bond villain.’
The first one was easy. He went straight into the room, and I hit him on the back of the head with the gun. The other one was alerted of my presence by the sound, to be honest, he did give a fight. It was until he was on the ground that I noticed I was bleeding, Sherlock was just waking up, and the one on the top of the stairs decided to barge into the room.
John spends New Year's Eve with the Holmes in London. Yes Mycroft is still young and inexperienced yet to become the British Government so he must do the office guard as I did. That means no leaving the city and being at the office early on the 02/01/2017 first thing to answer the phone calls and emails that will never arrive because everyone important is on holidays. Sorry Mycroft.
As John jumped and grabbed Moriarty, Sherlock heard the distinct “click” of a gun ready to fire. John immediately turned to his left and released Moriarty as Mary was aiming at Sherlock. He felt his blood run cold as she made her way to him without lowering her weapon.
‘Nothing! I hadn’t even realised it was late. Was it Mycroft who let you in?’ She turned to see the door before turning back to Sherlock in mild confusion. That alone was the answer he needed.
‘A date? Since when do you have a date?’ His nose was scrunched in his obvious distaste. How could John manage to get someone without him knowing about it? How did he missed it?
‘So, I take it that your training finished. How does it feel? Are you alright? I feel like I should help you somehow but I just don’t know how. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable. Will you come with Mycroft and me? He’s going to pick me up today, perhaps my experiment will have to wait until I get home.’
‘No, you always have an ulterior motive to do or say things. You always look so close into details that it’s impossible for you to get this wrong. You are leaving me out on purpose! You know the murderer, don’t you? The woman had an appointment with the murderer. Whoever you saw at the bridge was able to recognise you and you jumped as it was the fastest way out. They know you.’
‘Not at all. That would be just cruel without mentioning the obvious. You’re not the best actor and your moral compass is far too good. I’m afraid this peculiar trait of yours would lead to our demise. There’s also the fact that I’d never put you in that position. It’s too close and too dangerous.’
‘You should’ve seen him when you were in the hospital being held after you took a dive to the Thames. When you were kidnapped he called me to ask if you were with me, he remained calmed albeit he has a tell or two. I see how he looks at you when we are all studying in your room. It’s just when he knows you won’t see him.’
‘Of all the things she told us, that’s what worries you? I’m afraid you need to rearrange your priorities mate.’
‘And yet, they kept you until they were certain that you wouldn’t try it again.’ Her eyes were damning, her expression spoke of someone so certain that they were close to their objective that Sherlock decided he wouldn’t give her the victory.
‘You’re texting Mycroft? Are you sure that doesn’t mean that I have to text him from your phone as you often seem to just forget to contact anyone?’
‘I don’t think you know what “being fine” means after being so close to someone. I’m sorry it took me a couple of days before you could be allowed into the room without being family.’
Sherlock saw red. Apparently so did John but he kept himself levelled and tried to move the conversation away from Sherlock. ‘That’s not a very nice thing to say. By the by, am I to call you Miss Morstan or do you have a name?’
‘Are you alright? If this is too much we can get you in a protection programme or something. You’re still too young to deal with all of what’s going on.’ Her voice sounded uncertain and insecure to his ears, she was warily observing them as to assess their reactions. Sherlock could feel John’s apprehension and took a step back to see the whole body.
When Mycroft agreed to talk with her the specifics of her release, Lestrade called a unit to the building. As the place got flooded with cops and cleaned they all agreed to say that Lestrade had taken the shot when Moriarty was about to kill Sherlock. It was big news that a professor kidnapped a student and tried to murder him when the police found where he was being held hostage. News are like fairy tales after all.
“And yet you are still living here with me. So either you’re as mad as me, or I’m a delight to live with.”
Sherlock pointed this out to Lestrade. The victims were targeted because they were weak points. If they had a background of being either heavy drinkers or frequent junkies, it was likely that they were an easy point to get crucial information. They were liabilities, and they couldn’t afford to lose money over something as stupid as a drunk man talking a bit too much. They had to be taken out in the most efficient way possible.
‘Well isn’t this a turnout?’ Sherlock’s heart stopped as he saw John in a suit coming into the room, his face a blank mask and his stride sure and full of purpose. ‘Evening.’ He felt like dying. It was like drowning in the deepest and darkest place at the bottom of the Thames the day he jumped except that he wasn’t about to die because of it. Then he noticed John signalling S.O.S.
‘Well if you’re not giving me a name I’ll just have to give you one.’ He smirked when Sherlock turned with an appalled expression, which slowly turned into something akin to murderous.
‘I never thought you would walk the long way following streets. I sent him a message before we left.’
It took practically his entire willpower not to roll his eyes at her expression. She was so fake that it sometimes baffled him how no-one could perceive her true intentions as they were. Although, perhaps that was the whole point, to see if John was unaware of what was going on around him and make the decision if he could be spared or not. They couldn’t keep the number of bodies growing outside of the PA’s that had been found.
The second was from Sherlock’s network, and it was the most worrying thing I read that day. “They know, and are after you.”
‘Yeah, but it’s different.’ He knew he was practically pouring his heart at John, this was the closest he had ever been to admitting sentiments to someone else that was outside of his family. After all, perhaps Mycroft was right and he needed this, be capable to confide to John Watson. If things were to work in the next couple of months, he would need to set aside everything that was a barrier between them and work as one. They’d no longer be two separate individuals but “Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.”
Up to this point, Sherlock had regarded John as a fixed point in his life. Yes, he was planning on being deployed, but he still had a couple of months left. He had even planned for the time he was away, he was going to stay sober for him. This was unexpected and hit Sherlock with the realisation that people were not an extension of him. He could predict movements but not completely as human nature tends to be somewhat erratic, and this most certainly classifies as human nature.
“Publish it? Just like your blog? Why would you do that? And that case non the less!” John turned to Sherlock exasperated.
‘It wasn’t a nice thing to do. You sent her away crying and broke his illusions of a life with her.’ Sherlock could practically see John rolling his eyes. He was just so clueless to social cues and so straightforward in the way he delivered his deductions, that people thought him heartless. If only they knew.
‘It began a few days after the police took Moran under custody. She was waiting for me by the school. She’s been spying for a while, or knows someone within the rugby team, because John had a date so he wasn’t with me as I left. She approached me casually, her name’s Irene Adler and let me tell you that I hadn’t met a woman as cleaver as she is. Her cunning is not just at par with ours, but she has this way to weave her way through things.’ He turned to Mycroft and his expression could only be described as “exasperated,” he could practically listen him urging him to get to the point of the whole conversation.
‘If this is your way to do friends, let me tell you that it’s most certainly not working.’ Said John smiling. He could see that he was trying, and failing, to connect. To reach someone that was apparently so far from his grasp, he was stranded in an island on his own. John couldn’t avoid finding him as mysterious and fascinating as the previous day. He might be just a kid, a spoiled brat at that, but his sole problem was that he was unable to make connections.
‘No Sherlock, you are to remain quiet or I’ll call Mycroft. You might not be missing classes but the school needs to know why we had 4 different professors the first 2 weeks of the term.’
John could only roll his eyes at Sherlock’s shenanigans. From the very moment Mycroft stood before Lestrade to be briefed about what was going on, to the exact moment when the both of them decided that Sherlock shouldn’t be involved, John knew he was going to throw a tantrum. He was that transparent when Mycroft was involved.
‘Oi! Don’t take all the credit. I know how you feel about John and I can tell that he’s the same.’ She hid her smile and Sherlock sent her a suspicious glance.
I made my way through a broken window, and treaded lightly through the corridor looking into the other rooms. I could hear voices coming from upstairs, and tried to do my inspection as swift and efficient as possible.
They sat after a while. Sherlock taking up four sits just to have enough space to lay down using Mycroft’s legs as makeshift pillows. It was after another 3 hours that a doctor approached them.
‘Moriaty! No-one has to die tonight. We could get to an agreement of sorts or see that a ransom is payed. Let Sherlock and John out of this, it was me who got them involved in the first place.’ Sherlock could do little else than see his brother bargain with Moriarty as if he could nudge the spider sitting in a web while avoiding its bite. Moriarty’s dead eyes shined with his intellect and madness, he knew what he was doing and that Mycroft was about to sell his position pushed him to act on impulse.
‘Shut up Sherlock. It’s just for a moment.’ He stared pointedly at him daring him to say something else. When Sherlock just crossed his arms, and scowled at the ground John knew he had won. ‘So, how long is the article?’
It took us 2 days to be able to return to Baker Street. Mycroft had ordered the doctors not to let Sherlock on the loose until they were sure no infection would come to his gunshot wound in the leg. It is hard to keep Sherlock in a single place without breaking havoc on a regular day, now imagine how things went with him on light pain meds just because they couldn’t give thing anything stronger. It was hellish, and I wasn’t cleared to live the hospital just to be by his side.
‘Calm down brother mine. Remember that anxiety leads to irrationality. That’s beneath us.’ Hi eyes were once more on Sherlock as he tried to convey the message even though he knew his brother would not look at anything but John. He was constantly gathering information, from his hand, the monitors and whatever expression might cross his face. He had never seen Sherlock connect in such a deep level with someone else, not even their relationship had been as deep as it was with John. He felt like intruding the moment.
Once again, John could do nothing more than nod and wait to be given orders. Sherlock gave him a reassuring smile before going into detail of what happened to him.
‘Freak!’ Sherlock flinched at the nickname, he was glad that John couldn’t hear it. He composed himself almost immediately.
John sighed, it was going to be a long night trying to explain him how times worked, and tact. ‘Sherlock, you know I’m going tomorrow to see my family.’
For the first time, he thought that maybe Mycroft could see something else in both. But it was just, perhaps, wishful thinking on his side.
‘Sherlock? Are you alright?’ He was sitting in Sherlock’s bed while he was staring outside contemplating the street. Weeks had gone by and the case had resumed its previous status as “ongoing with nothing happening.” Whoever was planning the whole ordeal had stopped when sensing the police and the government this close. What worried John was that they could have noticed Sherlock making him a target. Of course, Mycroft had discarded the idea as something akin to an action film or so.
First thing first: I have a purpose with this, I feel like the past chapter and this one might feel a bit stand alone but they do serve a purpose that is about to be made obvious.
‘Do you intend to keep me out of the loop? I can’t allow you to go on your own.’ He was looking down at his hands when Sherlock turned back to him. He couldn’t stand to see him so troubled.
At his bashful expression, John could no nothing more but smile. Everyone has their own reasons to do things.
John just laughed at his excitement, that’s when the class began. ‘Meet me at lunch’, added John before turning his attention to the front.
Sighing, John looked down to his phone when he got a reply. Sherlock had sent a simple message stating that they should “Look though the neighbour’s trash, you should find a black glove. Test it for gunpowder, she’s the murderer.” And the reply that followed “Did you changed your phone number mr. Holmes?”
Needless to say that he actually managed a break through. It was at this point that he decided to bring us into what was going on in his mind.
‘Not too much, I imagine that it was just about enough to send the picture to Mycroft. They actually told me, and I quote them, that they’d “rather get caught by the government than by the man in the shadows.” Whatever that means.’ She paled for a moment, the expression obvious to Sherlock as he was observing her closely.
This was the second time he was at the cafeteria. So much people milling about, talking, playing games. It was just a tad too noisy, too much everything. His mind trying to sort through all the incoming information, the secret life of people. It was overwhelming how much could be seen, heard, smelled and touch, because people still stumbled against him as if he were a ghost.
Sherlock was crying. John couldn’t stop thinking that “it was worth a wound, it was worth many wounds, to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask.”
‘No. Believe me when I say that it would be impossible to go on without you.’ He avoided expressing that part of him wanted to be alone, but the most rebellious part of his mind wanted to keep John close and never let him go. It has been so long, that he no longer remembers what it was like to be on his own. Being alone now made him feel empty, as if part of him was missing.
‘What did you just say?’ His voice so deep and cold that made Molly shiver in fear as his expression turned into something collected and cold. She had never seen him like that, all his barriers and defences were up.
Sherlock could only stare at the phone for a moment. This was what he had always wanted, to be taken seriously by the police. The thing was that now that they were summoning at NSY, he couldn’t help it but feel terrified at the idea of going there. He turned to see John smiling and encouraging him to write a quick replay and go to said meeting.
“Yes, you do.” Remarked him with a grin. “So, I know that you have some plan being formed in that big brain of yours. Care to share? I've given you enough time.”
‘Welcome back to the land of the living. How are you feeling? Listen, I know yesterday, and quite possibly the past days as well, I’ve been letting you behind, but it’s not because I don’t enjoy your company. Quite contrary, I do miss it and your witty comments and remarks upon anything we come across.’
‘Oh darling! Why didn’t you told me so before, we could have changed the way in which I was introduced to him and make things easier. Is it because of a mental disorder or are you just shy?’
And yet, he stood bravely by him when he properly introduced him to Mary, because for Sherlock it was the other way but his mind revelled when forced to meet people. He also sat beside him and listened him talk endlessly about her and what they did at a date, or what they said through messages. He hated his situation, but he’d rather have a part of John’s affections than lose him completely.
‘You know you can leave, right? It’s not mandatory for you to stay when there’s nothing to stay for. I know about your date tonight, you are constantly checking your phone. You should just leave.’ He was closing himself to the rest of the world. It wasn’t the first time, and he was certain that it wouldn’t be the last time. ‘I mean, it’s Saturday, after all. Everyone likes to go out and have some fun. You should, rather than stick with me babysitting.’
‘I was on a case. I have never tried to commit suicide and John is aware of the problems I had. Now, you come here and make accusations when I can could just ask: where were you last night? Because you sure never made it to your house.’
‘Let him be. He’s just 16.’ Everyone cheered at that. Social conventions were something Sherlock had never understood, but this was way out of his grasp on cues. John took pity on him and sat at his side. After all, he had to show him the messages.
“There are no apparent signs of a fight or struggle.” I said more to myself, although by now I should know better. He heard me and made the face that said that
‘Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you I guess.’ He recognised Moriarty as one of the main academics in political science, lowering his stance a bit, he noticed John shifting his weight about to attack him. It was clear that he was creating an open for Sherlock to escape. That was not going to happen.
‘But I did.’ They all turned to him half expecting an explanation and half hoping it wasn’t as he said. ‘She came to me before Moriarty and had a lovely little chat. As our dear professor began to lose his grasp on reality, she began to fear what he could do.’
By now their conversation had turned into whispers, and Sherlock noticed that there were a couple of minutes left. He hadn’t even noticed the lecturer get into the room or the topic that had been discussed. Almost at the back of his mind, in a dream like haze, he could hear the professor thanking them for their attention, and thus marking the end of the class. He was glad that he was finally free, and noticed John beside him picking up his things with an amused grin.
’35 pages long. And I don’t understand the analysis question regarding the topic.’ She was sitting a bit more confident without Sherlock’s comments, John could see the words about to spill from his awkward position.
‘No. No! I don’t know how many times I’ll have to repeat myself but no! Are you even aware of the brain that’s supposed to sit within your skull? How were you even able to pass primary school, when I understand that history is a main subject you must take. What are you even doing?’ It was a relieve when John arrived and entered the room confused as to why was there a woman in the house? Relief was immediately obvious in his features and just as fast he went into one of his rants ‘John! Thank you for coming, I hope you weren’t busy. I need your social skills. Make her understand! You read slow and yet read faster than her!’
At this Sherlock hesitated. Things always tended to go wrong when he met more people. He was fine with one person at a time, but sitting with a bunch of strangers? Given, he knew John, but would the rest like him? He was saved by the professor entering the room. Sighing, he turned to John and tried to convey the unspoken message that he would answer at the end of the class.
‘Well aren’t you happy today? Good thing you sent me a message stating that you were expecting me half an hour earlier than usual. There’s a reason why there aren’t more students running about.’ Said John as a reply while he made his way to the lab station at the end of the room.
‘As expected she has. I was unaware that she knew about your involvement with the Met, but the situation has been corrected. She’s under almost constant surveillance now. I get updates of her every move. We don’t know who she works for, but the corpses have been identified. Let’s just say that the situation is taking a rather ghastly direction.’ He was inspecting his nails as he said this, Sherlock recognised his nervousness from the action. Things where worse than what he thought.
Sherlock hadn’t really counted John into his schemes, but what he just said saved him a whole lot of trouble. She looked between them, seizing them for a moment deciding what would be her best option while John tensed as he understood what was going on. They were in danger and this woman was the source of it.
In the end, he messaged John and asked him to stay with Sherlock. His parents would be there in the morning to take him to Sussex.
I ran up to my room to grab my gun while calling Sherlock’s mobile. It was obvious he had gotten the same messages, but I still needed to know where he was. It is after all part of his nature to get in trouble and go head first into it rather than wait for someone. He always has a plan; I’m just not fond of being left in the dark for long.
‘Don’t worry, it’s not noticeable, I’m just used to be unseen. It helps to see what no one else can. It helped me understand why we could never be together.’
‘I never agreed for dinner. I barely eat.’ John couldn’t believe he hadn’t understood Irene’s innuendo. Relief filled him in that moment when realisation hit him that Sherlock was not invested nor interested.
‘Are you in for John Hamish Watson?’ They were the only ones remaining in the small room, and even then, Sherlock jumped to his feet and was listening intently to anything the doctor had so say. ‘I am to inform you that he is now stable and well.’ Sherlock’s grip on his jacket’s sleeve went from slack to steel strong. ‘However, he went down into a coma. It’s likely he’ll wake up in the next couple of days, we suspect it was due to the closeness to his heart and major arteries. We can’t be completely sure until he wakes.’
‘Come on darling, surely you know that I hold nothing against you. It’s you who has been avoiding going out with John.’ Her smirk looked innocent for a moment before she turned to Sherlock. He understood then why everyone believed her lies as her expression changed so fast to noticed.
‘Sound deduction John. Now if you could be so nice and leave me be for a moment. That would be great, thank you.’
‘Whatever are you doing now?’ He asked barely above a whisper, panic was seen through Sherlock’s eyes. For him it was a countdown for something, so much was obvious form the pleading glance he shot his way. It was more than enough to put him into action and try to help the mad genius into whatever had already been schemed in his mind.
‘I will, he requested me to look for him after classes, not that it’s a hard task when you know how to find him.’
He went silence, John stared wide eyed looking for all the small information Sherlock was unaware he gave with small movements. He was trying to discern if what he was saying was true of if there were fabricated or modified realities, as he often liked to stretch information in order to get answers or reactions. It was sometimes impossible to keep up with everything that was constantly going on in his mind. The moment people were just about getting and understanding an idea or concept he had already devised at least one plan of action. He found it hard to keep himself away from him, it was exciting and intriguing to see his mind move.
We were at a Mexican standoff. I was ready to engage them all if needed. I had never been so happy to hear the words “Police! Don’t move!” They tried to run but were immediately intercepted. I saw Lestrade’s worried expression while he approached us and asked for an ambulance.
As if on cue, his mobile pinged with an incoming text. John laughed at the speed in which Sherlock asked him, and was marvelled by how his brain could link so many thoughts to a single strand. He was enraptured by his intelligence. To John, Sherlock shone bright above everyone else, he didn’t realise that to Sherlock he was the sun.
‘Addressing different points that must be addressed as soon as possible, I’ll have you know that I’m gay.’ John’s expression softened at the declaration. He couldn’t stand pity no matter from who he was getting it. ‘Second of all, what are you still doing here when I know that you have a date with Mary, I won’t die in the next couple of hours just because there was no one in my room. In fact, I don’t need you at all.’
John was speechless, the person right before him knew things that he hadn't discussed yet, but had been on his mind. 'That, was amazing.'
Molly just smiled, she already knew him so well even though their friendship was a couple of months old. He couldn’t understand what was it that made him trust her, maybe he would never really know. She was still here, and she was mildly able to do stuff and keep up with his brain. This could work.
‘Ah! Moran, it was high time that you showed up rather than leaving me to deal with these two on my own. Have you met her already?’ Sherlock could see John was angry for not noticing her earlier. They were locked in a hopeless situation where Moriarty had the upper hand.
To say that I disliked the plan is an understatement. I wholeheartedly could see a thousand things going wrong, but Sherlock being himself disregarded them all.
‘That’s because I didn’t give it to you.’ The words were out in the open so fast, that he couldn’t avoid feeling bad for mustering them that fast. ‘Sorry. Old habits.’
‘Yes, it’s part of my agreement with my brother.’ He childishly stuck out his tongue, and John couldn’t avoid giggling as he passed Sherlock the phone for him to see the message.
‘I was thinking that you wouldn’t allow them to see. I think that they have the right to know what’s going on. They are involved whether they like it or not. And the same goes to you, we can’t protect them if they go on their own investigating. Think of what happened to John.’ She was serious, they could see it in her voice and her stance. Lestrade’s expression calmed and he sighed in defeat. She was right.
John couldn’t avoid seeing the sorrow within his words. He could’ve just delivered a monotone speech that hold no meaning, but deep in his eyes John could see how faithful were his words to his mind. He was speaking out his thoughts freely without sparing him triggers, and John appreciated that.
‘What happened? Who did this to you?’ His expression was angered, and now Sherlock could see why he was the rugby captain.
Receiving no response from the detective, he emitted an even more awkward "Right." And set to go work in the kitchen.
"Oh. I'm sorry." I take your hand in mine in a comforting gesture. At first you pull back a little to withdraw your hand, but then seem to admit defeat and let it stay there. I hold it tighter, as if to say, I am there for you John. You smile at me gratefully, and then firmly withdrawing your hand, say, "Enough about me, let's talk about you." I laugh lightly, and smile at you. "Alright."
He repeated it like a prayer in his mind, as their lips met. Initially their lips were still, savoring the moment, the feeling of their own lips pressed against the other's. Then John used Sherlock's shoulder to steady himself, and kissed him, a little roughly, but then, slowed down to let Sherlock pick up the pace. They grabbed at each others lips, and John traced the lower lip with his tongue. Thrilled, Sherlock parted his lips, perhaps to let in some air, and John dove in.
It was all quite innocent really, as they sat curled up watching crap telly-- well John watched crap telly while Sherlock was deep in thought about something--John’s arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, his hand resting at the nape of the detective’s neck.
When Mycroft called again in the evening, John and Sherlock were at the window, keeping watch from behind the closed curtains. They took turns at the windowsill, observing the only man with the binoculars in all the crowd.
Almost involuntarily, John’s hands began to stroke the dark curls on the nape, and Sherlock, too distracted by his thoughts to pay attention to his own impulses, leaned into the touch.
On gaining realisation of what he was doing, John stopped, for a split second, and was about to remove his hand, when the sly, smug voice in his head whispered,
On the other side of the room, unaware to John, between the chattering crowds, stood a lady in a black dress.
"Very well, thank you for your cooperation. When all of this is over, we could offer you some," Mycroft made what John supposed was called a 'delicate pause', "monetary compensation."
“But there were signs of struggle on the victim. If he’d been drugged, the old man wouldn’t have put up much of a struggle. Besides,” John fiddled with a photo of the crime scene, “it wouldn’t have been so messy if he hadn’t put up a fight.”
He was right, the crime scene was gory, with an overturned table, blood splatters on the walls, and an absolute miracle that more DNA evidence hadn’t been left behind by the murderer.
"Do still believe he's not better off without you?" Mycroft asked. When John gave no answer, Mycroft slumped his shoulders in resignation.
"Indeed." Thank the gods, Mycroft seemed a bit calmer, though just as irritated, "I had not placed a full time surveillance on you because I thought you wouldn't be as
That was something that John didn't know the answer to, all he knew was that he'd made a mistake when he hadn't had the conversation about Sherlock's "methods" with him.
It was a lazy afternoon, when the domesticity was at its highest, and the living room of the flat emanated a soft aura, that a harsh crashing sound disrupted the peace.
His eyebrows where scrunched up with worry, and John smiled between the tears because it looked endearing.
So he stepped into the car, finding Anthea next to him, once again on her phone. She didn't pay attention to him as continued texting. John remembered briefly his first meeting with Anthea, and almost smiled at his foolish flirting. She was far from the man he had fallen for that night.
Sherlock of course, had noticed him already, though he made a show of adjustiting a thing or two before replying, “No, no, of course not.”
Mary looked at John, and how he stood, fidgeting, and laughed, placing her hand on his shoulder, "It's okay, John. It was going to happen sooner or later, anyway. One way or another."
He kept repeating the question, because it was not possible. It seemed to Sherlock, for a person to care so much about his well being or his drug abuse, even more confusing by the fact that he'd never met the man.
The past catches up, some long due apologies, and some much needed apologies are made, and a wistful conversation across the phone.
All in all, it took Sherlock twenty minutes to come to the correct conclusion, an additional stifling thirty minutes to work with the Yard to build up evidence.
So it hadn't gone as unnoticed as John had thought. He was about to not reply when he looked at Sherlock and remembered the detective's expression the previous day, eyes soft, mouth's edges lifting to form a small smile.
There are moments, that I will never stop loving. Like that Christmas, do you remember it? I always come back to it, Sherlock. Always.
Yes they had known that this was coming, it had to sooner or later, but they never thought it would come in such a fashion, and so directly and headfirst, that they couldn't skirt around it a bit, as was the British thing to do.
At this both John and Sherlock looked at each other instinctively, and then looked away just as quickly at being caught, as Mary continued.
"Touching, is it not, the fan-base we have already acquired?" Sherlock had a sneer on his face that John supposed had more to do with
But John hadn't realised, at least not yet, that the connection that they'd shared was not present now, at least it wasn't mutual.
He played a broken, sad tune, which occasionally bordered on noise as he clumsily played it, making a bad show of hiding his state. The room was dark, to say the very least, with only one lamp that provided any light, so that most of the room was illuminated only because of the moon.
He stood for a second on the footpath he was walking on and shut his eyes tightly. He took a deep breath, trying to just... Live.
He would play the CD whenever he felt low, along with the other things: the sound of John saying his name- John would always say it with a distinct warmth, making it seem like an endearment-, the recording of everything that had occurred on the day they met.
As soon as he saw John, though, he froze, as if a deer in headlights. He quickly handed over Rosie to John. Rosie, sensing a change of hands, and the absence of Sherlock's singing, looked up to find her father. Though she loved him, she also loved Sherlock's lullabies, and therefore turned to where Sherlock was standing, struggling in John's arms.
"And I know, you're only doing this because you think it's kinder, but. It's not Sherlock. These people have often witnessed traumatic events very recently, and. Being harsh on them does not help at all.
He despised these emotions: unwanted, uncalled for, and unforgiving by nature. They mercilessly tormented him, and brought him the greatest of joys all at once, and be wept because he could neither dare to hold onto them, not let go.
That night Sherlock ate nothing, and John didn't insist on him eating either. And when they went to bed, the room was painfully quiet.
"How did my phone end up here?" John said with a confused look. He saw the expression on Sherlock's face turn slightly guilty, before the detective tried to deflect it by finding out who'd called John.
Grumbling, they stood in front of each other, calmer this time, though not happy with the second trial. John took a deep breath.
He'd grown so used to Sherlock in the short span of time they'd lived together. To the tantrums, the eccentricities, to his brilliance, and the way he spoke, and his violin, and--
When Sherlock spoke, though, John's quickening heart-pace stopped for a second, and then resumed beating wildly. His voice had seemed low, husky even, and John found he liked it more than he should have. But as Sherlock said the last sentence, John stopped.
The man on the other end spoke some more, and she hummed, a smirk forming on her features. "Of course, why not. This will be fun."
John, waiting outside, was not sure what to make of the previous moment. For a minute he thought Sherlock was going to kiss him. then he realized that it was well- Sherlock. It was probably just him being weird. Even so, he could not help but think, what if Sherlock had closed the distance?
John hadn't thought of that, but this time a ready excuse came to his mind, maybe because it wasn't that much of a lie. "Not much longer actually, I'm going to be sent on a mission far away, for a long time."
“John, you can’t leave. This,” he pointed to the laptop screen where john had been writing his blog, “is what you do, John. This is what
"Yes, obviously, because I'm a five year old child, who needs constant inspection." Sherlock replied, not bothering to hide his exasperation.
"Oh," he smiled at John, "Right. Yes, I do remember who she is. My cousin twice removed on my father's side, Mrs Norton."
The trio go from Baker Street to the scene of John's crime, with the John Watson of the other dimension as their tour guide
Instantly both men stopped whatever they were doing to gape, as if they weren't aware of the possibility of this happening for a few weeks now. John, who had just started to stand up from the couch, paused midway.
Sherlock curiously abandoned his laptop-- for once it thankfully wasn't John's-- in the interest of trying to figure out just
And yes I copy pasted the deductions from the show, simply because I feel he would have said them the EXACT same way???
Once again, it occurred to him that once all of this was over he'd be alone again; but it was too far into the future to not wave away for now.
Then his lips curved into a soft "oh" as his brows, which had progressively knit closer, now unfurled a little.
. They were tracking down their spy's routine to see if there was a shift, and another person came to fill in his place, or when he left, to follow him and confirm he was one of Moriarty's.
Your eyes are filled with gratitude, and love, your lips in a small, uncertain smile. Not my imagination, then.
Aaaannd here's another one!!! Yes, I just recently read The Song Of Achilles, and I am in LOVE with it. So yeah, I had to put in some references.
Molly caught herself staring at Sherlock in time, and looked away. She felt happier somehow. Better.
He went back to the crowd, and found Sherlock talking to a guest. When the guest had moved away, Sherlock asked, "So, how was it?"
Instead, when John walked out of the bedroom into the living room, he found Sherlock curled up on his chair, fast asleep. He was lying in what seemed
Mrs Hudson smiled fondly at him, and it momentarily filled her with a warmth and pride like that of a mother’s. he had always been the son she never had, but always wanted. A memory came to her mind, and she could not help but smile wider as she recollected it.
bedroom now, and asked in a quiet voice that John could pretend he hadn't heard if he didn't want to answer. "You have nightmares, about Afghanistan?"
Plus, he'd not mentioned Sherlock's name or his or anyone's name in the whole of it, talking about Sherlock only as 'He' and the rest of it in terms only someone who knew them already would understand.
Is it not a few days ago that I had first seen you Sherlock? So young and clever and bored. You had spewed something horrible about my husband. And then I smiled. I laughed and I ruffled your hair and asked you if you wanted a cuppa. You looked so surprised Sherlock, and it was then that I was sure that you needed a lot of love.
"Mom, it's not like that. She's just under peer pressure. And this is just temporary, she will stop drinking."
Sherlock scanned the room, his eyes resting on Molly's, who had been looking back at him. He smiled.
And then he suggested, in a low voice, "We can began our attempts for salvaging John's domesticity from tomorrow, can we not? Tonight, I think, we can reserve to mourn."
"Sherlock? What are you thinking about? ” the question shook him from his unhappy thoughts, and he focused onto the situation at hand.
Rosie simply watched them for a while, at peace, and then went to sleep quitely, somehow knowing better than to disturb her parents in a moment like that.
For Sherlock, it would be a memory preserved inside a CD of the song in a drawer in his mind palace, in the wing that was John’s. Where one could find everything about him, from the feel of his ridiculous jumpers, to the different colours his hair turned to in bright sunlight (light golden strands that seemed to be emitting a light of their own), the dimmer afternoon sunlight ( a brownish golden), and the darkness of the night( an ocher). There was, of course, another colour, labelled ‘the colour on that day.’ (the most beautiful golden he had ever seen).
