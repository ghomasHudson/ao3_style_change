He whispers it repeatedly, even as Blaine bucks and shoves his body against Sherlock, but Sherlock is stronger and heavier than he appears and Sherlock’s knees are dug into the insides of his elbow so he’s already lost feeling in his hands.
Sherlock back. His Sherlock had been a combination of student, sidekick and youthful best friend—a harmless, sexless creature who provided comfort and purpose for John and for whom John provided—what exactly
Chatsworth shook his head with a smile. "You know that whole thing about dragons hoarding treasure?"
is a therapist because, other than the day after he came home, he refuses to talk to John about what happened in Serbia, and John knows for a fact that Mycroft has repeatedly broached the subject.
There's trees in the distance, scrubby ones he can't identify and then bigger ones with tiny leaves that he also can't identify. Everything is a shade of brown and olive green, from the faintest golden beige to dark, succulent green.
Every morning he wakes up in a cage of Sherlock's limbs, as though Sherlock is protecting him. Given what John has heard Sherlock scream during a flashback or shout out during a nightmare, it's clear that Sherlock's persecution at the hands of the guard, Danilo, weighs heavier in Sherlock's psyche than the other torture. He often has nightmares where Danilo rapes John, or forces Sherlock to.
John stops writing after that. There's only one page left anyway. John likes the symbolism. One page on which to write the rest of his life.
"I can pick up the prescriptions tomorrow morning and I'll pick up what you need from the shops, too. Write a list for me. I'll grab it when I get there. Okay?"
"Breaking up is always awkward when the two of you share the same friends, but you two will get over it. After all, Cyril has finally professed his love, and I'm quite sure he's been keeping Gerald busy. The two of them haven't even been showing their ugly faces they're so busy shagging—"
Then John settled on his pallet and slipped his hand through the crate and the careful cuts he'd made in the silk and wool batting and laid his hand on the beautiful egg where Him—
and took all his medicine. (John frowns at Sherlock's word choice. Lately, it seems like everything Sherlock says is cloaked in sexual innuendo.)
, considering Sherlock could already talk. Much like a baby, though, caring for him was going to be an enormous task.
Around one in the afternoon, Sherlock's temperature had risen to 103.1° and with alarm, John realized he had nothing in the house to feed his imminent hatchling.
"God, no," Gerald says, sounding irritated. "My job isn't to fix anyone. I get clients who get angry at me because they're still having issues after months of therapy and I'm like, look, you're the one who refuses to accept any responsibility. 'Well, but my wife left me. I didn't do anything wrong.'" Gerald is getting agitated, his voice louder. This is a sore subject, one he very clearly needs to vent about. "They don't get that it's not accepting responsibility for other people's decisions. It's accepting responsibility for their
"What—now?" John says, voice smoky and dark, like a man who's just smoked a cigarette and debauched someone.
"Why not?" Sherlock asks, genuinely confused. Then he realizes what John's talking about, and scrubs his face with his hands. "Right."
, breath coming rapid, forced out of him. "Christ, when I look at you, I can't believe you just—you fucking gorgeous creature, you're like drugs used to be, I can't get enough."
Sherlock pulled his face out of John's neck, staring up at him wide-eyed. All his limbs tightened around John, his tail squeezing John's middle with surprising strength. "Oh
It’s a Wednesday night and, according to the chalk sign over the bar, drinks are half off. Sherlock sits down on a bar stool close enough to Blaine that he’ll be able to lean over to talk to Sherlock but not so close as to make Blaine nervous. When the bartender comes over, Sherlock orders Hennessy. Aside from the fact that Sherlock likes cognac, it’s the kind of classy drink that makes a statement.
Sherlock's eyes fly open and he lifts his head. He's lying on his side, his hands balled into a fist. He lets out a tremulous sigh that turns into a sob when he sees that he really
As he told Sherlock the day before, John's responsibility extends beyond just treating his injuries—John has taken on the responsibility for Sherlock's health. There are many things John has thought of that he needs to restore Sherlock to health, including helping him gain weight. John starts writing things down.
Another memory—grinding up chicken livers in the food processor while talking to someone who wasn't there. Or maybe someone who he just couldn't picture. John managed to write:
"Oh, shut up," she says, and pushes him aside with good-natured roughness as she gets off her stool.
On the other side of the skip, a man (the suspect?) has Sherlock's back against the soot stained limestone wall, both palms flat on either side of Sherlock's head, caging him in. Sherlock looks scared, and while the thinking part of John's brain knows this is just an act, his heart is pumping adrenaline through his body and he isn't thinking right now, he's just
He's in his t-shirt and pants. He looks at Sherlock's bed. He walks over to it and sits down. He doesn't know how long he sits there. Finally he lies down. He puts his face into the pillow and takes a deep breath. It smells a little like Sherlock but the truth is he doesn't really know what Sherlock smells like up close. For now it's enough just to lay his head where Sherlock's head has been. He lies there and he pretends that Sherlock lies there with him and wonders why he waited until Sherlock was dead to have a fantasy about going to bed with him. He's an idiot. He could've been having all kinds of sex with Sherlock in his fantasies. Why did he wait?
"Well, within the next two months," John says, his lips tipping up on one side. Sherlock can see him holding in his amusement.
Yes, home. Sherlock's home was with John, here on Baker Street, not that—that ostentatious manor house in the countryside with its live-in cook and handy young dragons named
John takes his tea and sits down at the kitchen table to drink it, staring off into space. He has yesterday's paper spread out before him, but he's not reading it. He's remembering every detail of last night (and trying not to get hard while he's at it.)
His hands slide up John's thighs and then up his arms and down his chest. He murmurs wordless encouragement and John begins to move. He puts his hands back on the headboard. It's more of a rocking motion than an in and out motion. He rocks forward and out, then back and in. The drag of Gerald's cock in and out of his body is possibly the most erotic sensation he's ever experienced. The psychological effect it has on him isn't a surprise, but the intensity of it is. One can argue that Gerald's penis is no different than his fingers, which have also been inside John's body.
Sherlock’s shaking fingers don’t find a pulse. He lays his head on Blaine’s chest and waits. His heart is pounding so hard he can’t tell if Blaine’s heart is beating. He hears nothing.
Zivko, though, is just a boy. He wasn't here in the nineties. He doesn't seem older than sixteen to Sherlock. He's got the usual high cheekbones and almond shaped eyes of ethnic Serbs but his skin is pale. Sherlock can see Russian ancestry in Zivko's blushing cheeks and startlingly green eyes.
door open and then close, hears the muted rustling of John getting dressed, then the whisper of John's duvet being pulled back. John's mattress is memory foam and makes no noise
Sherlock goes into the kitchen to help John lay out the food. They work together in silence, their bodies comfortable in close quarter even if their hearts are divided. When they sit down at the table, they eat in silence for several long moments. Sherlock surreptitiously watches John, whose eyes never rise above the level of his plate. Sherlock endures the weighted atmosphere until he feels sick with uncertainty, and can't stand the silence any longer.
Another complication was keeping Sherlock busy or entertained. He'd been content for the first few weeks, but in the fourth week, he became increasingly restless and irritable. Strangely, though, he was more clingy with John—he followed John throughout the flat, even into the bathroom (though John nipped that habit in the bud from the get go); his tail was constantly twining around and through John's legs or around his waist or arms, and he couldn't go more than an hour without rubbing his cheek or chin on John.
"Not yet," he says absently, his trousers momentarily forgotten as his eyes roam over John's body before lifting them back to John's face. Sherlock takes off his own clothes with quick efficiency. He leaves his pants on, and climbs onto the bed next to John.
Sherlock, feeling lighter, but still deeply touched, ducks his head and swallows back the emotion that threatens to overwhelm him. It was illogical to assume John felt otherwise, and yet Sherlock had, spending the last month feeling like a cold, distant moon orbiting a bright star, never getting closer, just spinning uselessly around.
Sherlock reminds himself of the other things Blaine won’t need once he’s dead. He’ll never need to kidnap women. He’ll never need to turn them into prostitutes. He’ll never need to pull another lover in the pub three streets down.
He stands up. He knows where he's going but he's not going to think about why just yet. He walks through the kitchen and into the little hallway and then into Sherlock's bedroom. The bed is unmade. There's a small red rubber ball in the middle of the bed. He laughs but it's just a whisper, one puff of breath. He picks it up and sits on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock looks up in surprise at John's retreating back. He didn't think John would want to help him get dressed (
"Yeah, well, you're a troublesome patient. Speaking of which, have you seen the medical brief you brought with you? I thought I'd left it on the table, but it's not there. Did you move it?"
"Yes, Mycroft. I'm a doctor, not an idiot. I wrote a prescription for a mild benzodiazepine to help with anxiety attacks and melatonin to help him sleep. Why don't you get to your point?"
Everyone else is here already. As John goes around handing out hugs and kissing cheeks, nobody mentions that John is the only one who didn't bring his significant other.
"I suppose," John said grudgingly because although he hated to admit it, Sherlock was right—dragons were pretty fucking awesome.
By the time Sherlock has undressed Blaine down to his pants, Blaine is breathing hard and his pupils have almost blotted out his irises. His lids are at half-mast because his pupils are so large that the light is too bright. Sherlock is still dressed and Blaine’s hands are reaching for his buttons with clumsy intent and Sherlock takes that opportunity to slip his fingers into Blaine’s pants. He takes a few steps away, his fingers tugging from inside the waistband of Blaine's pants. He follows obediently and Sherlock almost laughs. Blaine's pants have turned into a leash.
"What are you, fourteen years old?" John laughs. He's grateful for the laughter and he knows that's why Gerald has done it.
Finally, Sherlock pulls back to look at John. "You have no idea how fantastic your legs and arse would look in stilettos."
Inside was shredded cardboard that had the appearance of straw. On top of it was a large beige envelope, bulky with something. There was no address or name written on the front. John turned the envelope over. It wasn't sealed, which made him feel less guilty when he opened it and slipped his finger inside. He drew out a single sheet of paper, written in an elegant cursive. He set the note down on top of the fake straw and turned the bulky object out into his hand. It was a temporal thermometer, the kind that doctors sometimes used with infants. John dropped it into his pocket and picked up the note.
John tugs the waistband of Gerald's pants down just enough to release his erection, which bobs enthusiastically, his foreskin almost entirely retracted behind his glans, and already beading heavily with fluid. John reaches out and holds it loosely between his thumb and first two fingers, examining it intently. As far as penises go, John has to admit it's pretty fucking beautiful. It's dark with engorged blood, the rosy head flushed and slick. Gerald is panting and lifts his hips desperately but John doesn't give him what he wants. Not yet. When he reaches for his dick, John smacks his hand away with a playfully stern look.
, we're each taking a shower and then you are buggering me senseless," Sherlock says, pushing down his trousers and pants. When John fails to move, he asks impatiently, "Did you miss the part where I said senseless. No? Good," before closing the bathroom door.
Sherlock hurries after John and finds him in Sherlock's bedroom, but the room has changed. Sherlock doesn't bother to catalogue the changes. His eyes are only for John, who's yanking open a drawer and pulling on a t-shirt.
. The army paid for medical school and I did my training at Sandhurst like all the rest, and then my CO said
Like his wings it was jointed, but without the cruel claw at the end of each joint. It was almost purely white so that when it was down, he looked like he was wearing a pearl necklace or collar. When he snapped it taut, it flashed with the same opalescent sheen as the other white markings on Sherlock's body. It felt dry and papery to the touch and it took John several days to get used to the feel of it on Sherlock's throat.
to tell Sherlock he's sorry. He doesn't think he can bear another day like yesterday, choking on his clumsy attempts to analyze his reactions to Sherlock's kink.
The door is unlocked; inside he sets his bag down so that he can hang up his coat. Inside the bag is the file from the embassy infirmary detailing his injuries and giving instructions for their care and a few pairs of pajama bottoms, t-shirts, and socks—brand new but washed—that Mycroft had the foresight to bring to the embassy infirmary with him.
"The thought of coming home to you kept me going—that, and the small bit of hope I carried with me that, if I were just brave enough to tell you, brave enough to push past your
attracted to you. But I'm not comfortable having sex with you right now or, indeed, any time soon. We need to move slowly—
Sherlock blanches and Olivia holds out her hand for him to shake and says, "Ignore her. We try not to encourage her behavior."
Thirty minutes later, Sherlock has three stitches, a prescription for a stool softener, and a list of instructions (to add to his growing list of instructions) on what he can and cannot eat so that his bowel movements won't irritate the wound.
, Sherlock tries to say, but it's lost in a groan as John pulls the waistband of his pants under his balls, and then sucks each testicle into his mouth, poking his tongue at them, a vulgar bulge in his cheek.
Twenty-four minutes later, John came into the flat and greeted Sherlock with, "I had to buy a mincer for you, I'll have you know." Sherlock's relief was palpable and John stroked the egg reassuringly as he passed it on the way to the kitchen. "You have such a lovely egg. It'll almost be a shame when you break out of it."
"Arrived where? And what would I be role playing? I mean, is it that you—" John stops, and then takes a deep breath and tries to look confident rather than what he's feeling because he feels about fourteen years old. "I don't—I'm not sure I get why you want me to wear high heels. Is it a—" John stops, and then lowers his voice, making it sound calm and not at all judgmental, before saying, "Do you have a thing for crossdressing or—"
I admit I was irritated that anyone would dare to suggest I'd written anything other than a perfect story because I'm a writer and we have big egos. I may have found myself muttering under my breath things about "uppity betas," but when this chapter finally reached the demanded angst-level, and Katie was happy with it, I felt relieved that I'd listened, even if I was sullen during my initial rewrites. My measurement for the quality of my angst was whether or not Jenn and Katie cried, and bless them, but I made them cry far too much than is proper. Thank you Katie for not being afraid to tell me I did it wrong because that takes so much courage, and think how wimpy that scene would've been without you! Thank you for your honesty and taking time from your life to work with me on this behemoth.

"No, not at all. It's what we're taught living in a heteronormative society, which is why I emphasized the difference. If you want to fully integrate yourself into the LGBQT community, these are things you need to know. Secret handshakes and stuff. And the answer to your question is two."
These guards are old enough to have been young men during the civil wars of the 1990s. They are old enough to have lost brothers, fathers, and friends to Croatia's brutal ethnic cleansings. They are old enough to have mothers, sisters, girlfriends, and friends who were raped and brutalized by Croat soldiers. These men have lived through the worst atrocities humans can effect upon another.
John laughs, "You weren't a prickly, mad bastard who has the communication skills of a twelve year old boy."
. Oh, and let's not forget the Romanian orphans back when the Romanian government declared birth control illegal. Most of those children were permanently damaged, unable to interact socially or learn to care for themselves, despite not being born with any mental disabilities. It was sheer
It takes a surprisingly long time for John's body to relax enough for Sherlock to move again. "Will you—can I keep going or do you get too sensitive?" Sherlock asks. John just waves a hand limply above his head, and Sherlock doesn't wait for further clarification, but picks up a quicker pace designed to bring him to orgasm as quickly as possible, which works perfectly. He comes less than a half minute later, and in the same sudden manner as John's, without warning, and Sherlock feels triumphant, because he knows that John has
"What's wrong? Are you sick?" John asks, even as he's climbing onto the bed, one hand trapping Sherlock's wrist to check his pulse, the other hand slipping inside Sherlock's shirt to feel the temperature of his skin.
"If giving him head only earns me a piece of toast and an egg, what on earth do you think would earn me an entire evening socializing with people, one of whom is my ex-boyfriend? On, and a baby!"
John walks to his bedroom and shuts the door. The water starts up immediately (John's letting it warm up before getting in), then the opening and (slamming) shut of various drawers as he pulls out night clothes, the

"Well, to me, if I touch someone's genitals with any part of my body and it leads to an orgasm for him or myself or both, then we've had sex."
"Why do you call it that?" Gerald says, laughing despite his irritation. "They don't go in there to be
and he's wanted to wash this mad bastard's hair for about a million years, and he's damn well going to take advantage. A humming rumble starts in Sherlock's chest and vibrates against John's skin like pebbles falling against glass, and John thinks of a wiry, tetchy tomcat that comes around for five years, spitting and hissing every time you try to show it any affection before it lets you domesticate it, and then takes all of five minutes to become a lazy, fat housecat that sits in your lap and demands your attention every time you dare to look busy with something else.
"No!" Gerald says, almost spilling John's wine when he grabs John's arm. "No, I'm not knackered like
Gerald and John are sitting on the sofa in Gerald's sitting room watching the telly. Gerald has curled himself up into an approximation of a very large cat and is using John's lap in which to do it. Gerald has no shirt on and John's fingers are sliding absentmindedly through the dark hair on his chest before they find the hair on his head again. John doesn't realize he's doing it until Gerald brings up the hair kink question again.

After the fight, Sherlock is exhausted, weary in a way he hasn't been since he first came back from Serbia. He feels shattered and too vulnerable, inhabiting a body that isn't his. He can't bear to look at John, to see the confusion and wariness in his eyes.
Gerald surges up but John puts him back down with a firm hand on his sternum and then kneels between Gerald's legs.
"Yes, well, so were you," Sherlock says with a raised, ironic eyebrow. Before John can open his mouth, Sherlock adds, "Besides, Greg is actually bisexual."
John laughs at his confusion and Sherlock shovels the last of the mashed potatoes into his mouth and gets up. He makes his way into the sitting room, while John follows, grabs John's laptop and then puts it down and grabs his own before stretching out on the couch. He looks up as he opens the lid on his computer.
The driver glanced up at him, still frowning but John could see the beginning of panic in his eyes. When John lurched towards him, he fled, leaving the door open.
John relaxes his posture so he doesn't give himself away. "Yeah, I can check up there in a bit. Oh, your brother called me this morning."
John wants to defend Sherlock and say he couldn't help the timing of the case, but the truth is Mycroft had probably been trying to get him to take it for a long time, and Sherlock finally agreed just to get away from John. So John says nothing.
"You would be wearing the shoes while we had sex," Sherlock says, and then flushes splotchy red, eyes sliding away from John. "You would take the coat off when you arrived. It's, well—like role play."
Sherlock shakes Greg's hand when he offers it. Greg holds on a bit too long, and then clasps his other hand so that he's gripping Sherlock's hand in both of his, and says, "God, it's good to see you, you fucking bastard. When Mycroft told me you were still alive, I admit, I was
Despite Sherlock's request, John runs up the stairs to the second floor bedroom, and opens it without even bothering to knock. He finds Sherlock huddled in the corner of the bed, against the wall, with his knees drawn up, and looking miserable. He looks like he's been hit with the flu, and John is immediately on alert.
Sherlock nods, and John sets the Transition Time countdown to twenty minus zero minutes and counting.
He checks it before bed to find he has five missed calls. He listens to his voicemail, tempted to leave it, but knowing if Rebecca and Bernie aren't given some incentive to leave off, they'll show up at the flat.
"I'm not bloody rehashing this again," John snapped. "If we're going to have a romantic relationship, we either do it my way or not at all."
The other two guards stationed in Sherlock's block of cells laugh and jeer. Sherlock can see the horror in Zivko's eyes but Sherlock's position doesn’t allow him to help anyone, including himself. At least they're giving him a bath, Sherlock thinks.

Sherlock's shivering so bad that when he shakes his head it isn't immediately evident, but when it is, John says, "Well, then. I'll just have to carry you downstairs."
"Here we go," John says, coming back into the room with a glass of water and two of the pain pills. These are the ones John has from his med kit and not the ones from the doctors at the British embassy.
From then until five o'clock Friday morning, John and Chatsworth worked together to ease poor Sherlock's suffering. For the pain and fever, John ground up ibuprofen and mixed it with sugar and water, a concoction that Sherlock greedily swallowed. When Sherlock asked for
Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. It occurs to him that this isn't just important to John. This is important to Sherlock himself. Maybe he won't like any of John's friends. Maybe they won't like him—probably won't like him. But he owes it to himself to
Sherlock allows himself to be led back in the bedroom where John sits him on the bed and then rummages in Sherlock's duffel bag for another t-shirt. Sherlock spreads his legs and John steps in between them without even thinking. He pulls the shirt over Sherlock's head first and then guides Sherlock's arms gently through the sleeves.
about my fucking reputation? If it were just me, as much as I love London, there are other cities in the world who could use my particular talents."
!" John says in mimicry of Mrs. Hudson. He purses his lips like she does, and manages to puff himself up to look highly indignant. He walks out of the flat with a hand pressed to his breast in almost perfect imitation of a disapproving Mrs. Hudson but not before tossing a grin over his shoulder that Sherlock finds devastatingly sexy.
Finally, Sherlock looks up at him, his eyes burning like coals in his face, and even though John isn't sure what they're talking about anymore, he's sure that Sherlock's fever-bright eyes and cheeks make him want to do all kinds of kinky things with Sherlock, anything he wants as a matter of fact because he would do

Right as John reaches into his locker in the doctor's lounge to grab his bag and jacket, he gets a text from Sherlock that leaves him staring at his phone, his mouth hanging slightly open in a way Sherlock would have pointed out with blistering disdain if he'd been there.
—it seems as though Sherlock has thought of nothing else for days, that maybe if he added up all the time over the last three years he looked at or remembered John's thin, quick to grin lips, he would discover that weeks of his life have been devoted to nothing else.
. I'm still a fully functioning man with the same brilliant mind I've always had. I know you and you would handle me with delicacy, like I might break. I don't want that."
"Oh, I don't know, Greg. He seemed awfully keen before I told him I was only paying five quid for what he had in mind."
with Elspeth because she was a bad mother and lost her child, then worked in a rehab clinic, learning to be a good mother before becoming a woman who hunts people down. He's probably giving Mycroft too much credit. He certainly couldn't have predicted Sherlock would sleep with her.
Sherlock's mood turned dark. John could feel the frightening chill of the void Sherlock had existed in before John had come along.
"John," Mycroft says that evening, surprising John, who's not used to being addressed directly by Mycroft when Sherlock is in the room. (Unless Sherlock refuses to do what Mycroft wants, in which case Mycroft fobs it off onto John.)
"That's fine, sweetheart. I'll drop it all off around noon. So have it to me by say, ten tomorrow morning? Good. Love you!"
John, is worried that John won't have time for him any more, maybe that John will move out. So he does the only thing he can think of. He tries to seduce John to make him stay.
He leans in to kiss Gerald whose stitches have only been out a day and whose lips John has been aching for. They've avoided sex since Gerald got his stitches. The first time John tried to give him head afterwards, Gerald almost tore his stitches crying out when he came and after John had stopped laughing, they decided to wait.
In this life, though, the concern breaks through some of the wall Sherlock is trying to erect to keep John from seeing him cry. It's bad enough that Sherlock spilled all that shit out last night. John already thinks he's broken. He doesn't need any more proof.
too! John, I'm not seeing the issue here. Does your age make it difficult for you to achieve an erection?"
"Agh!" John shouted, reaching up to rub it off his face. "You've wiped your nasty food all over my face! Sherlock, look, you can't just wind your tail around me like this. It makes me feel like I'm being restrained."
She's unusually kind. For a bounty hunter. For anyone, really, that Sherlock has encountered since he fell off the roof of St. Bart's. She holds him while he vomits so that he doesn't pitch forward into the scrub (
A sound, more gasp than hiss, escaped Sherlock and then, with astonishing speed, John was released. There was a quiet thud as Sherlock jumped off the back of the chair onto the floor. John watched him walk across the sitting room, jump nimbly up on the couch, and then curl up, wrapping his tail around himself, looking more and more like a ball than a dragon, until even his face was covered.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, looking disturbingly like Sherlock, and said, "You're supposed to put the milk in before you pour the tea to prevent the heat from cracking the china."
"And you know that for a fact, do you?" she asks in her irritatingly know-it-all voice that reminds him of Harry when they were kids, back when they fought over couch space, and who got to sit in the front seat, and who got to shower first (and whoever went first got screamed at for using all the hot water), as opposed to now when they don't fight at all because at some point between Harry's drinking problem and John off at war in Afghanistan, they turned into strangers who were too busy falling apart to bother fighting with each other.
"No, no, you're fine. I was only sixteen and I didn't—I wasn't a very good mother. She was taken away."
He hunted for tape, trying to keep his mind expressionless in order to complete his mission before being hit with more memories.
Sherlock knows he's lying. Not about them not having time—it must be close to the time John normally gets up, or he wouldn't have been rocking his hardon against Sherlock's arse—but Sherlock knows John still would've said no, even if they had all the time in the world. His jaw works as he tries to control the urge to slap John, but he rolls off as requested, and stares at the ceiling, trying to put a lid on his anger.
, Sherlock tries to say, but it's lost in a groan as John pulls the waistband of his pants under his balls, and then sucks each testicle into his mouth, poking his tongue at them, a vulgar bulge in his cheek.
"Chair?" John asks breathlessly. Sherlock lifts his chin towards the straight back wood chair that has been relocated from the living room desk to the bedroom. Sherlock's vivid imagination has no problem calling up an image of how it would have looked—John seated in the chair, his arse perched on the very edge, his feet propped up on the bed, finger fucking himself while watching Sherlock sleep, innocent of John's salacious plans.
"You fucking wanker, stop being all seductive with your voice, and your—cheekbones, and that fucking
John looks at her in surprise, and says, "Oh, were you talking? I'm sorry. I thought I'd made it clear we were moving on from that subject." John fiddles with his glass. Shakes his head. Tries to speak. Doesn't.
"I love you, too," Gerald says. "You don't think he'd be pleased you were happy? I mean, you are, right? Happy, that is?"
Sherlock attempts to rearrange his clothes into a semblance of decency while ignoring Blaine’s grin. He’s also stalling for time while he thinks.
"Oh, no, I learned about a lot of things. In fact, I want to play the violin so you'll need to buy me one. And I want a chemistry set. Not like for little kids, but a grown up one with a microscope. Aiden and I watched a show called
Understanding dawns on Sherlock's face, along with an eye roll. "I'm wearing a condom, it's not as though—" then stops at the look on John's face. He sighs with exasperation, and disappointment, and then says, flatly, "You're so
John suddenly appears between the kitchen and sitting room. Sherlock rushes him and pushes him down to the ground and hisses at him to be quiet. Doesn't John know how precious he is? How eagerly Sherlock's enemies would be to hurt John in retaliation, maybe even kill him? The very thought leaves him gasping for breath. His vision winnows down to John, black edging his face, like a vignette. John grips the nape of Sherlock's neck and pushes his head down between his legs. His other hand clasps Sherlock's wrist, two fingers taking his pulse.
"I, on the other hand, am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant, and all around obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. And, yet, the bravest, and kindest, and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing, has redeemed me by the warmth and constancy of his friendship.
Sherlock just nods, his body heavy with exhaustion. He lets himself be led into the room and gently guided into the bed and then John is covering him with the duvet and about to leave and Sherlock panics.
John nods, his mouth turned up a little at the corner. When Gerald is sitting next to him, John feels a shiver of excitement travel up and down his spine.
John can't hide from the truth that he stashed inside his heart before he glued it back together the first time, a million years ago, watching a gorgeous, brilliant, mad bastard throw himself off the roof of the hospital where John learned how to save people's lives. It's the same  truth that he felt a million years ago lying on Sherlock's grave (when he thought it was
"If you tell me which flat is yours, sir, I'll begin unloading the van and carrying everything up so you can see to your hatchling."
surprised to want a man. The desire has been there all along, hidden in his psyche, but now it’s forefront in his mind and it’s begging John to act.
his friends. John doesn't like lying, but he does exactly as Mycroft says if only because he wants to protect Sherlock from the press, after how Sherlock was treated before he faked his death. John still remembers those hateful months after, mourning his best friend and holding onto his belief in the face of such ugly and biased publicity. It's not that John doesn't trust Rebecca or his supervisor, but the more people who know, the more likely the secret will get out.
Sherlock waits, but nothing else is forthcoming and he feels himself wilting in embarrassment underneath John's stare.
arse. Aren't you?" She sounds scandalized, as if she hadn't just admitted to admiring Sherlock's arse, too.
Suddenly, everything comes crashing back and he looks around the room for Gerald, but all he sees are boxes of Sherlock's stuff. He grabs his pants off the floor and tugs them on while racing down the old servant's staircase tucked between the bathroom and kitchen. He calls out Gerald's name and finds him in the bathroom, bent over the sink, his hands covering his mouth and nose, blood dripping into the sink. Gerald looks at him guiltily.
are—you gave me my life back, Sherlock. I was broken until you found me. But I can't—I can't make decisions that will affect three people so much, when you've been home less than twenty-four hours, you know? I need time."
"John, do you think my teeth are handsome? I didn't get to see them in the mirror yet. Do you think they're more handsome when compared to other dragons' teeth?"
John holds onto the moment a little longer than he knows he should because this will probably be the only chance in his lifetime that he can
Sherlock's tail was easily twice the length of his body, which explained why his egg was so big. From the tip of his nose to his rump, Sherlock was roughly two feet long. His tail tripled that length. John estimated Sherlock as six feet long, but his willowy body made him seem more snake than lizard. At least until he stood up on his long legs.
Mycroft held up his hand. "Once he's taken his human form, his body will naturally produce what he needs to maintain his health. Dragons are made differently than humans, obviously. Proportionate to their size, dragons have far more muscle mass than humans. Their hearts needs to function at top performance to pump oxygen to those muscles, which means—"
His symptoms were the same as thousands of other soldiers who came home from war, but the therapists he saw
He finds Gerald in his office, leaning up against his filing cabinet and staring at his hands. John knocks on the doorframe.
John favors Sherlock with his full wattage grin, the one that shows all his teeth and Sherlock feels the weight of the last eighteen months drop away. It's not so much that it
"Twenty years," John whispers in awe. "They loved each other for twenty years and never said a thing."
John takes his tea and sits down at the kitchen table to drink it, staring off into space. He has yesterday's paper spread out before him, but he's not reading it. He's remembering every detail of last night (and trying not to get hard while he's at it.)
Sherlock's eyes flickered once in that alarming way, but it was gone too fast to make John nervous. Sherlock took a step back, turning his head slightly, breaking eye contact. "Then I choose not at all. I cannot be
"Oh, believe me—Mr. Holmes is footing the bill for this and I'm also getting paid. Which reminds me—I'll be living here until Sherlock has settled comfortably into human form. I've taken the upstairs bedroom, which Mr. Holmes leased from your landlady—Mrs. Hudson if I recall? Come knock on my door at any time. Oh, and let me give you my mobile number just in case."
Sherlock says, "I can't help it if my imagination is creative and vivid," in a wounded voice, "but I can stop if you—" and John reaches his hand back, and Sherlock grasps it, and John says, low and solemn, "No, I don't want you to stop. I don't want you to hold back with me in any way. This is us, yeah?" and Sherlock breathes, "Yeah. All right, I just get—you know me, I get carried away." John whispers, "Yeah, I do know you," and squeezes his hand once before letting go.
The blurred memory of after the flashback, though he doesn't tell Dr. Reed that, not yet. Not when all his guts feel like they're spilling out, and anything other than
"I missed you so much," John whispers brokenly and then gathers himself and smiles. "Let's get you some tea before you have to submit to me poking around your body and griping about the inferior quality of doctors found in Belgrade."
"John, I know you're capable of observing carefully and inferring conclusions from what you have observed. If I'm not mistaken, you did a full physical exam last night, is that right?"
trying to keep you safe and I'll probably die from the stress before my fiftieth birthday, and you'll live to be
Sherlock knelt on the seat next to John and reached for John's tea. John smacked his hand. The hurt in Sherlock's eyes gave John a pang of guilt.
children, but his parents were dead, his sister was an alcoholic and he was too broken to drag anyone into his life.
"Anyway, I'm sick of being stuck with Bernie—who, need I remind you, I've known my whole life—and Olivia, especially now they've got bloody Milton to pay attention to."
Sherlock is sitting in his chair, the ankle of one leg over the knee of the other, his fingers pressed together just under his lips. He's removed his suit jacket, and John is again reminded how strikingly handsome Sherlock is. He's gained weight and healed quickly, and in less than a month he looks almost like his old self, except his hair is shorter than John's ever seen it although it's finally grown out enough to curl. It feels like he's looking down his nose at John, even though Sherlock is the one sitting down.
so John opens his eyes. Sherlock watches John with his wicked eyes while he gets John off with his hand. When John comes, Sherlock's eyes open up wide, pretending to be scandalized. John laughs, his body limp and relaxed.
With that, he gave John the bag. John looked inside and found two teething toys—the kind made of soft rubber with a liquid inside that froze quickly—a tube of oral numbing ointment in strawberry flavor, and a bottle of liquid children's paracetamol.
He pours a little gel into his palm, rubs it between both hands to warm up and then wraps a hand around John's half-erect penis and strokes a couple of times. He wraps the other hand around John's penis and strokes. John's cock loves Gerald's hands and wants to make sure he knows that, so it stiffens and purrs against his hand as he strokes it.
John, of course, asks, "Tea anyone?" already walking into the kitchen to turn the kettle on without waiting for an answer.
gesture, Holmes, with obvious reluctance, said, "We're magical creatures. We can change between the two forms."
"I know you think I have magical powers to connect clues to form a picture, but I must admit I'm stumped on this one."
"As far as pain management goes, every six hours I'll give you two dihydrocodeineone. Three hours after each dose of the codeine, I'll give you four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen. That way you're getting pain medication every three hours. The ibuprofen will help with your wrist, elbow, and shoulder as well. Right now, though, it's your ribs that are hindering your movement so much. I hate to wake you up at night to give you pain medicine, so I'll skip the ibuprofen at night, but I
Instantly, John's healing instinct kicked in and he began barking questions as his hands pressed and searched, looking for the problem. Not being a dragon doctor, of course he couldn't determine what was wrong so he looked to Chatsworth. "What's wrong? Is this normal?"
"Oh, there's the real Sherlock," John says ruefully and shakes his head. At least he's meeting Sherlock's eyes now. "You know, the next time you want comfort, you could just ask for a hug."
John carried a drooling but affectionate Sherlock into the flat and through the kitchen to the bedroom where he lowered him onto the bed. John sat down beside him.
"You'd shower and shave, just like you would if you were going on a date. It's supposed to feel like a
. John's Captain Watson persona shouldn't be arousing to Sherlock—someone who never follows orders as a matter of principle, even if said order is to his benefit—but it is. Sherlock remembers Baskerville and John pulling rank on the young soldier.
necessarily, but he's in hiding. I'd never expected to see him again, and then he showed up. Gerald and I can't tell anyone, we made a sort of nondisclosure agreement, and that's why we've been shifty about it. His location has to remain secret."
Inside the door, John takes in Gerald's flat. It's done up in warm but light colors. There's a staircase directly ahead of the front door. The risers and walls are the color of sand and the steps and trim a muted terracotta.
"No. You do nothing unless I tell you. Go to my room, take your clothes off, sit on the edge of the bed and wait for me, eyes on the floor."
John handed her the two teething rags he'd made. Sherlock was limp in her arms, drool soaking his homemade bib. Of course, Sherlock immediately turned and rubbed his mouth against her robe, smearing it with drool. Mrs. Hudson grimaced and John made a face in sympathy.
"You're a terror, all right," John said and kissed the top of his head. "All thirty pounds of you a right proper menace."
John walks to his bedroom and shuts the door. The water starts up immediately (John's letting it warm up before getting in), then the opening and (slamming) shut of various drawers as he pulls out night clothes, the

would have time to figure it out. How could he have predicted that Sherlock would jump off of the roof of St. fucking Bart's?
To Mycroft, John said, "Did you catch all that? So should I give you my bank info or is there paperwork for me to sign?"
The minute the back doors were opened, Sherlock hopped out, flexed his wings, and with one leap of his powerful back legs, he was up in the air, flapping his great black wings.
John gets off the phone feeling a lot less overwhelmed until, with a pulse of guilt, he realizes that he'll have to call Gerald, explain the cover story to him, and ask him to lie to their friends.
Sherlock knows John got off his shift at six and will only have enough time to run home, shower, and change before he has to be at the party. So Sherlock times his arrival home so that he just misses John. That gives him several hours to get settled back home and find something
As soon as Sherlock has fallen asleep, John eases himself out of bed. He picks his phone up where he left it on the table beside his chair and dials Gerald's number.
John opens the sliding glass door and steps back out into the muggy night air. Olivia and Bernie have set up a large galvanized steel bucket filled with ice and bottles of beer on the patio. A fat citronella candle rests on the garden table.
John wraps his hands around Sherlock's biceps and squeezes hard enough that it should hurt, and tries to push Sherlock away, but Sherlock doesn't budge. He doesn't want to
"Second rule. If you feel pain somewhere you didn't before, if there's inflammation or swelling somewhere new, if something isn't starting to feel better when you know it should, tell me.
and, like a phantom, slips into bed behind John. Before John can react, Sherlock has wrapped John up, his longer body and limbs moving over and around John and then drawing him back, back against Sherlock's chest.
never good enough. There's always something I'm doing wrong. While I was still in my dragon skin, I was totally dependent on you, but I'm
Chatsworth's laughter was so robust and lasted so long that John stomped off to his room, thoroughly embarrassed.
"Yeah, pretty sure," John says, his voice gone soft and quiet, thinking about Harry more than babies, and feeling that familiar stab of regret for not realizing she mattered until she was lost to him.
"Theth thomthing wong with my mouth." Sherlock rubbed his face against his paw as though trying to wipe something off. "It huth and I keep dwoling."
"None of us would want to stand in the way of that—not even Gerald. We're all sentimental fools who never quite grew up, and we all believe in true love. It'll take a while, but you and Gerald will be friends again, because there's too much love and affection there. Plus, it won't be fun getting together with everyone if you and Gerald glare at each other the whole time."
"The second time I was raped was by a young guard. He didn't want to do it, but the other guards had locked us in a room and said we couldn't leave until he fucked me. He was a virgin and he wasn't gay—he wasn't even—" Sherlock stops before he starts crying.
John keeps his eyes locked on Sherlock and gradually leans forward, letting his tongue slip out of his mouth incrementally, wetting his lips, reminding Sherlock of a slow motion film. Sherlock's hips strain upward even though he's gripping the mattress and imagining his arse sinking into it, in order to avoid smacking John in the face with his clothed erection.
These are the things that break Sherlock down. The beatings are a gift in comparison. This is how psychological torture works – you become grateful for the things that most people would contemplate with horror. At least when they're beating him, the pain gives him the opportunity to disconnect from his body. It's during these beatings that he has enough presence of mind to create a cupola at the top of his mind palace where he sits with John, who begins to take on the mythos of a god to Sherlock. The source of all good things is John. He is a deity. He is Sherlock's higher power.
comments. She told me my writing was her everything and I told her I was going to make a screenshot of that and turn it into the wallpaper for my laptop so I could look at it whenever I got discouraged. Also, she always addresses me as "dearest" in emails, and I had hearts for eyes the first time she did it. Thank you, Tia, for being my sweetest and letting me be your dearest. She always signs her emails with lots of little "x" kisses, so Tia, here's some for you. xxxxxxxxxxx (We're like making out with that many kisses!)
"I woke you," Sherlock says hoarsely. They're still holding onto each other, heads pressed together.
John settles his hand on Sherlock's knee, and Sherlock's heart cracks open. The blackness seeps out, every dark bit of it. He closes his eyes against the rush of emotions.
"Can we talk?" John asks, collapsing on the bed, the wall at his back, and Sherlock to his left. He draws his knees up and rests his arms on them, his hands hanging loosely.
"Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock, just get in here," John said and then slapped the bag down on the kitchen table.
"Are you asking if I want to go because, personally, I'll enjoy myself? Or are you asking if I want to go because
"You can't help me with everything," Sherlock says. His heart is racing. He rubs his hand over his mouth and wipes sweat off his upper lip. Now that he’s noticed it, he feels the dampness of perspiration everywhere.
But what if John does this for Sherlock—puts on a pair of women's high heels—and Sherlock finds it to be ridiculous after all. What if it puts a crack in the foundation of their relationship? Who, then, will be to blame? Sherlock, for asking him to do it, or John for agreeing to go along?
"It still hurts a little," Gerald says, and John sucks in a heavy breath and admits, "I expected to feel awkward. I didn't expect to—" but Gerald just says, "Yeah," and that's where they leave it.
he said quickly before anyone could correct him. "I need to go back to work. I really should drive back to town tomorrow afternoon at the latest."
Chatsworth's laughter reverberated through John's bones. He'd quite forgotten about Chatsworth and why they were here in the first place.
As they lie there, catching their breaths, John says hoarsely, "My arse is off-limits for at least three days. I wasn't sure I was going to make it through for a bit there. Good thing we came quickly," and Sherlock chuckles, his voice rough, and rearranges them so that John is spooning him. Sherlock holds their linked left hands over his heart, and it's not long before John's body goes limp, and his breathing evens out.
Abruptly, John's brain turned sideways and attempted to slither out his ear. He found himself on his hands and knees, gasping for breath. Sherlock crouched next to him, his hand wrapped around John's arm. He seemed to be dressing down Chatsworth, but their words were muffled. The world shimmered around John, making it hard for him to see anything.
"You wanted me to find a therapist? Well, I did—Mycroft did." Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. "I spent hours on the phone today with my new therapist
Gerald doesn't answer. He just opens the door and waits, head lowered, the topknot John has found so charming falling forward.
John waits, but that seems to be the end of the conversation. Of course, now he's curious. He heats the last of Mrs. Hudson's shepherd's pie in the microwave and sits in his chair with his tablet. There's a good book one of his colleagues suggested called
For one shivering moment, Sherlock holds onto reality by trying to tip his consciousness over and into the warmth of John's eyes, whose eyebrows have just drawn together in confusion before he and everything around him blinks out of existence to be replaced with cold concrete, a sinister voice, and terror made all the more razor sharp by the joy and love that went before it.
, John—the thing I care about most in the world. Not my reputation—I don't care what people think unless it keeps me from solving interesting puzzles. No, you see,
Mycroft looks down at his notes and turns one of the pages over, but Sherlock is surprised to see it's a stalling tactic. Mycroft needs to say something he thinks will distress one of them.
In the quietest voice he was capable of (which was not at all quiet), Sherlock said, "You know, John, so much of your daily life involves your penis."
"—I wasn't finished! The point I'm trying to make is that we all need time! You need time to heal and I need time to work out how I feel and help you heal."
Mycroft leaves John to his tears after that, for which John is grateful. He's also grateful, though, for what Mycroft is really saying – Sherlock didn't die because John didn't confess his love. Sherlock didn't die because of anything John did or didn't say or do.
"Oh, yeah, I did, didn't I?" Rebecca says, scrunching her nose up before pushing her bottom lip out slightly, the picture of haughty petulance. "Well, I take it back, because Gerald got to keep you, and then you went off with that man of yours—I mean,
"I'll just stay right inside the door. Go on, then, the meter's ticking," Gerald says and gives him a pointed look before playfully smacking John's rear.
be a time where we'll be having sex," Sherlock points out, wrapping his dressing gown around himself and tying the sash as he follows John into the kitchen. “No sex with Gerald either, though.”
, as you put it, brought on by your PTSD; or that you've been in love with him all along, but you're terrified he won't love you back, so now you're trying to build a defense against what you perceive as rejection on his part.
"It's just that I watched you fall. I thought that was your broken body on the pavement. I thought, all that precious mind of yours, cracked open on the pavement. It was an absolute waste. So, even though I didn't think you'd hurt yourself, the thing is—I didn't think it then, either. And I thought I was wrong, and it—now I don't know that I can trust myself."
Sherlock lifts his own lofty brow, and says, "Lead the way, darling brother," gesturing grandly, though vaguely, in the direction of the sitting room. Mycroft sniffs, and walks back to the sitting room. Greg sits in John's chair, his eyebrows raised as well, but more out of humor than arrogance, and Mycroft steals Sherlock's chair. He and Sherlock glare at each other, but Sherlock capitulates after only a few seconds, and throws himself down on the couch, pulling his dressing gown tightly around himself.
John pushes himself up slowly from his kneeling position and the feeling of Gerald's cock dragging out of him makes his spine shiver. Gerald's hand darts in and squeezes the base of his cock. He takes several deep breaths in and out through his nose. After about a minute, he lets go of his cock and then he nods. He opens his eyes and looks at John and his face breaks into a lazy grin.
When John gets home that night, the flat feels empty the way it used to after Sherlock died, and John experiences a flash of vertigo trying to collate what John knows intellectually—
Thank you for loving Gerald, too! In the chapters I cut, we got to see more of the gang than just the peek here at the end, and they were fun to dream up. Poor babies, their scenes kept getting cut so y'all don't know them like I do, but maybe one of these days you will. I'm not making any more promises, though!! I'm not even sure I'll keep writing fanfic. This was the story I wanted to tell all along and there's a peace that I feel in bringing it to a close that I'm loathe to disturb.
John has moved beyond alarmed and into a sort of horrified arousal. Sherlock suffered sexual assault, and John doesn't want to give Sherlock the impression that he himself feels assaulted, but it's beginning to feel
Gerald disappears through a door to the immediate left of the front door but leaves it open a crack. John peeks in and sees a small office and Gerald sorting through his mail. A narrow hallway along the left side of the stairs leads to a living room. Two leather armchairs sit on an oriental rug in front of a clean fireplace. The fireplace is functional, though – the hint of swept ashes are visible on the brick hearth. Another sideboard holds more pictures, a crystal decanter set (empty) and a reproduction of a Degas sculpture – one of the ballerinas. John knows nothing about art but this he recognizes.
"As we all do, sir," the driver said, his Scottish accent giving the comment more of a humorous tone than it warranted; it made John smile.
Friday morning, Sherlock stays in bed until John leaves for work. John texts him an hour later and asks
—whatever your name is," Sherlock says, gritting his teeth, and then turns to John. He lowers his voice so only John can hear, and says, "I don't care what they think about me. But when they find out there's an
Even Mycroft visits occasionally (or kidnaps John), making the effort to maintain a relationship with John even though they have never seen eye to eye. John begins to enjoy Mycroft's sly humor and arrogant disdain when it's turned on everyone else. One day Mycroft quietly admits to John that he knows John was in love with Sherlock.
"Sherlock," John says softly, shaking his head slightly as he sits on the bed next to him. He takes the box of condoms out of Sherlock's unresisting hands, and takes both of his hands so all four are wrapped up together. "I've never stopped wanting you, no more than I stopped loving you. In fact, I've had to remind myself many times of your injuries so that I could maintain the proper distance, not just as your doctor, but because you're always so deceptively self-assured. And then, also, like I said—breaking up with Gerald was hard, but it's not stopped me wanting you."
"Yes," John says, and they lie quietly together for a time, enjoying only this—the two of them, well-fucked, and nobody else, nothing else, nothing between them.
"Oh, I can form plenty of opinions. But I can't let it stop me from doing my job as best I can. That's where ethics or morality comes in. Life is valuable, ergo all life should be considered valuable, not just the ones I think deserve it. I'd really like to wrap my hands around the neck of MH for denying you the company of people who can understand you, but killing is against my ethics."
In the middle of the night, John wakes from a nightmare. The bedside lamp is already on and his foggy, nightmare-addled brain can't comprehend why he would be in his own bed, rather than downstairs in Sherlock's bed. He has less nightmares in Sherlock's bed, which is part of the reason he started sleeping there.
and sets a fire in John's gut that he doesn't worry about tamping down. With women, John always has to moderate his passion, worried about being too rough, careful not to let passion overrule sense, always aware of the fact that he can physically overpower her.
John's gonna take these words that he clings to out of dread and break them down to their literal parts. He's gonna examine each one, throw out any emotional attachment. He's gonna go at these like Sherlock.
John reaches up, grinning with pride, semen sliding down his cheek to meet up with the bit on his chin, and puts his hand on the back of Sherlock's neck. He pulls, guiding Sherlock down into the kiss, but when Sherlock feels the pressure on the back of his head, he stiffens abruptly, every muscle seizing, fear rocketing along his nerves and obliterating the warm pleasure that came before it.
"Ah. Well." There's another pause. "As a sufferer of post-traumatic stress disorder, I'm sure you realize my brother will likely experience many of the same symptoms you had."
John lowers the paper into the folder and looks at Gerald, who's watching him with an uncertain look on his face.
Sherlock's face does this thing that reminds John of the night he had the flashback, when his head was ducked down low and he was ashamed and John swore he would never make him feel ashamed, not about sex, but that's what he's done. The light has gone out of Sherlock's face, and his body is stiff and he's turned back to the computer, his shoulders hunched up over it as his fingers hover over the keys and John is mad,
"You think breaking up with Gerald was easy?" John says, his voice rising towards a shout. "Now the obstacle has been overcome and we can fall in bed together,
Four months after faking his death, Sherlock is on a plane bound for New Orleans, Louisiana where he will work with the FBI to begin dismantling the human trafficking ring that spans two continents and is spearheaded by four of Moriarty's lieutenants. These are the men who answered to nobody but Moriarty.
The black dragon was the key. Obviously, it was what the magic was trying to make him forget. He only had to keep ahold of the knowledge that the dragon was real, ergo the man was real. He might not be able to report a missing dragon, but he could certainly report a missing
Gerald doesn't warn him, but John hears the whistling of the cane through the air and then a bright hot line of pain erupts across both his butt cheeks. He shouts into the bed.
Sherlock turned around several times in John's lap, his long tail coiling around, before finding the position he wanted. "They go away when I don't want them and then come back when I do." Sherlock gave him a demonstration, and John bit back the yell when Sherlock's claws caught in the meat of his thigh. Sherlock immediately retracted his claws and ducked his head, covering his face with his tail. In a small voice he said, "Sorry."
John crouches in front of Sherlock and his hand strokes up and down Sherlock's thigh in a soothing motion. He doesn't realize he's doing it. "All right?" John asks.
John stares at her incredulously over his clipboard while the nurse hovers around waiting for instructions. "Tell me which pain started first."
The allure of having Chatsworth around to clean out the litter box, and remove all the blood and assorted viscera from the feeding pen, and watch Sherlock so John could leave the house for more than five minutes without Sherlock freaking out was just too strong to waste on avoiding a few uncomfortable conversations.
you be back?" she asks, distracted, and John knows she's probably pulled up the schedule on her computer and is trying to shuffle people around to cover for him.
As soon as John gets home, he jumps in the shower and then gets dressed for the party. Unlike their usual get-togethers, his group of friends are having an early night now that Bernie and Olivia are mothers of a newborn. Rebecca said anytime between seven and eight, but right before he walks into the Baker Street station, he says
"What do you mean what do I want to do? I want to do whatever I need to do to make him stop wanting to have sex with me!"
"Oh, and don't you know, all those pictures of ugly babies people have shown me over the years and I thought,
"Yes," John says and automatically lifts his head to look at Gerald the way he would in any other conversation, but Gerald's fingers move from trailing gently through John's hair to gripping the back of his neck and keeping his head down.
"Yes. Madly in love, it turns out. I wouldn't have started anything with Gerald otherwise. It's not a matter of using Gerald as a replacement for this man. He was never coming back, and I had no idea where to find him even if that had been an option. So, I moved on and fell in love with Gerald, and I would've spent the rest of my life with him. I know this sounds hokey, but Sh—I mean this other man, well—he’s the love of my life, you know?"
For another thirty seconds, Mycroft continued to stare at him while his face grew increasingly hot. Finally John shrugged and shook his head; Mycroft went back to his newspaper.
John sees the hope blossom in Sherlock's eyes before he squashes it down with another furrow of his brow. "Well, of course, you're
Finally Chatsworth's face changed—just a twitch of his lips, but John would count it as a smile. "Of course, sir."
Gerald nods and then turns into a statue. It's a struggle, John can see. He's pushing a needle into the meat of Gerald's bottom lip and, like John said, the face (especially the lips) and the hands are some of the most sensitive places on the human body. Everyone knows a papercut hurts more than cuts three times as big on other parts of the body.
that nobody good could ever love you. You've been through an experience probably nobody else you know will ever understand. You've been violated physically and emotionally. Being a genius doesn't preclude you from the negative results of that.
But anyone looking at John and Sherlock would assume Sherlock held the power in the relationship. John imagines that people look at the two of them and wonder why a man like Sherlock—brilliant, gorgeous, sharply dressed—would be with a man like John. Sometimes, when he's particularly afraid, John wonders the same thing. Because Sherlock does hold a little more power in their relationship. Here's a truth John's mind shies away from—when Sherlock confessed his kink, the look John's rejection put on Sherlock's face made him feel—however momentarily—illicitly powerful.
"I want to work lube into your hole, opening it up for me so that when I breach your body, you can hear the slick squelch as my cock stretches the walls of your rectum, making way for me. I love a slow, filthy fuck, to make it last long enough that we need another round of lube. I want to bend you in half, and fuck you so hard that a grunt is forced out of you every time I drive my hips forward and split your body with my cock."
James Bond-esque adventures because you want to blame PTSD for wanting to get a leg over your flatmate, you are taking the piss—the very
anymore. One day, Mrs. Hudson breaks down in tears and tells him she wishes she had done for Sherlock what she now does for John.
Occasionally, Sherlock would fall asleep without warning, right in the middle of whatever he was saying or doing. It was frightening the first time, but every time after that, John couldn't help but laugh when it happened.
door opening and closing and then, finally, the scraping metal sound of the shower curtain rings as the curtain is drawn open and then closed. Then silence for seven seconds (other than the ambient sounds) and then—there it is—weeping.
Gerald cups John's neck with his hands, his thumbs brushing along John's jaw. He can't really smile, but Gerald's mouth doesn't have to work for John to know how he feels. Gerald's eyes are versatile in their expressiveness.
Sherlock smiles slowly, a dangerous, soft smile. He pulls out of Blaine, ties off the condom and drops it on Blaine’s stomach. Then he tucks himself away and walks out of the bedroom.
At that moment, there was a grunt from the living room, the sound of someone setting down a large burden.
John is holding a sleeping Milton when the doorbell rings. Rebecca asks Bernie, "Are you expecting anyone else?" and Bernie says, "No," then turns to Olivia and says, "You Olivia?" Olivia shakes her head.
He has Lestrade, who meets him for a pint every Friday night if he can get out. He's suspended so there's not much else for him to do, he says. His marriage has fallen right apart. John listens to his woes, glad to have the focus off of himself. A month after Sherlock's death, Lestrade confides that Anderson has left, gone right off his rocker, and Lestrade confesses he's glad. It's bad enough having to see Donovan at work. He admits he can't even look at her;
door open and then close, hears the muted rustling of John getting dressed, then the whisper of John's duvet being pulled back. John's mattress is memory foam and makes no noise
John takes a deep breath and then begins ticking off Sherlock’s injuries. "So, lacerations on your back due to beating with a belt. Bruised kidney. Internal abdominal bruising. Broken and cracked ribs. Hairline fracture to the left elbow. Sprained right wrist. Dislocated left shoulder. Fungal skin infection."
Rebecca smirks. "They just never talked about it again and they were too blinded by how they felt to see that the other felt it, too."
"Really?" Mycroft asks, the word full of surprise. "All of it? Including what happened with the young guard?"
It's half eight before Sherlock hears the front door shut and John's tread on the stairs. It's slow and plodding. Sherlock has been pacing, phone gripped in his hand, for almost two hours. Six milligrams of clonazepam have kept him from a full-blown panic attack, but it hasn't quenched the urge to leave the flat and find John.
—" The word is spit out of his mouth, a bad taste he can never really rinse away. "Having my psyche picked apart. I assure you, Dr. Reed is not that same gentle breed of therapist as yours. He's ruthless. I've been splayed open. I'm
"Oh, yeah, I did, didn't I?" Rebecca says, scrunching her nose up before pushing her bottom lip out slightly, the picture of haughty petulance. "Well, I take it back, because Gerald got to keep you, and then you went off with that man of yours—I mean,
John licks his lips and nods. Sherlock sucks on John's throat and continues to lightly tease John's cock with his fingers as he speaks.
He sits down in his chair and stares at Sherlock's chair but he's not really looking at the chair. He's looking at Sherlock on the roof of St. Bart's. He watches Sherlock fall and then he watches him fall again. His mind starts adding in extra details – the fear Sherlock must've felt as he fell. The sound his body would have made when it hit the ground.
When John finally makes his way home, exhausted, sweaty, and smelling like ashes, he finds Mycroft in his chair and Sherlock in a suit for the first time since his return home. (And
"I told you they decided to have a private ceremony, just the two of them, and then host a weekend wedding reception."
"Johnjohnjohnjohnjohn!" He grabbed John around the knees, his tail winding tightly around John's ankles. "I'm never letting you leave the house without me again! It was
“I have passports and cash. I can get you what you need, too. We can get into Mexico and then you can disappear,” Blaine says.
"I apologize for my tardiness," is the first thing Sherlock says as he edges his way towards John like a skittish lamb seeking shelter behind its mother.
John finds Sherlock upstairs in the second-floor bedroom sitting motionless on the edge of the bed. He's pulled on pajama bottoms, but his back is bare, and the raised pink lines of his still healing scars remind John of his dream, and he shudders. He stands in front of Sherlock who's staring at the floor, holding his hands limply in his lap, and waits without speaking, keeping his distance.
John frowns at the digital words crawling along the small screen of the pager. "It says fire—primary school—"
"Do you know how much I love you?" Sherlock asks, softly and with a scratch in his throat, he doesn't wait for John to answer him. "'The truth is that I didn't work right until I met you, and maybe that's not what other people think about when they think of love, but I only work right when I'm with you, even when I want to throw you off a roof myself, and I couldn't possibly in a million years
John helps Sherlock stand. "I'll go get your pain pills. You're soaked in sweat. Do you want to change your clothes?"
them," Sherlock says, irritated that John's missing the whole point when it was John who's worried about triggering a flashback or panic attack, but then his spine stiffens, and he purrs, "Unless you want me to."
Sherlock sits silently, his mind sifting through examples of grief that don't involve the death of a loved one, so he can determine how long he should wait before cornering John and kissing him. Obviously, he can't ask John—even Sherlock knows that's beyond the pale. He watches John, who is also sitting silently, who, in fact, is beginning to look like a John-shaped thing in which John no longer resides. Suddenly, John seems far too still to be alive.
"Make him as comfortable as possible, which means—sorry, Sherlock, but needs must—getting him to take some pain medicine. Other than that, make him drink as much water as he will. Like I said, I think this is all going to be over by tomorrow morning so until then, we don't need to worry about him not eating. After that point, though, the focus needs to be back on eating and resting as much as possible."
"What's his name?" she asks, but when John opens his mouth and starts shaking his head, she interrupts him. "Never mind, forget I asked. Look—do you love this man?"
Speaking of last night, what did it mean? John has a tendency to treat uncomfortable situations in which he is involved as though they didn't happen. When it involves other people, though, he can gossip like a little old lady.
Sherlock, of course, can't stand to not be involved so he puts his strop on hold temporarily when Lestrade shows up and begins to explain, with much gesturing of hands and extrapolation of evidence, how he managed to nab the suspect.
Sherlock and Chatsworth were sitting next to each other on the couch while Chatsworth read out loud from
John goes ahead and toes off his shoes and then pulls off his socks, tucking them into one of his shoes. He pushes himself upright again and then looks around the dining room table and sees the wine rack. It's a proper one, too, holding at least a dozen different bottles from dark red to barest champagne color. John knows nothing about wines, either, but he knows what he likes so he picks a Merlot. The tools of wine-drinking are displayed in a box, nestled in velvet. Clearly Gerald entertains often. The dining room table only seats four but there's a line in the middle indicating a drop leaf.
that nobody good could ever love you. You've been through an experience probably nobody else you know will ever understand. You've been violated physically and emotionally. Being a genius doesn't preclude you from the negative results of that.
There will never be enough words to express my gratitude towards the women who supported me through this whole process. I've thanked them over and over again, but I'm pretty sure there aren't enough thanks in the world to do them justice. I thought there would be a point past which they would just not put up with me another second, but that point would come and go and, miraculously, they didn't abandon me. They've enriched my life and helped me become a better fan by drawing me even deeper into the rabbit warren that is the Sherlock fandom, a place I never thought I would be. Ever. Like, the forever never ever type of "never." Before March of 2017, I didn't even realize there was a difference between a "fan" and a "fandom fan" because I didn't even know there was something called "fandom." (There are many, many terms I didn't know before I got sucked into this fandom, including a plethora of acronyms. Thank god for the fanlore wiki.)
"You needed comfort? Maybe intimacy with someone you knew as a, uh, to re-establish control over your own sexuality after being—violated?"
In walked a tall man with auburn hair dressed in a three piece suit and carrying a rolled up umbrella. He tapped it onto the floor as he stopped just inside the door.
“I can’t. I’ve just arrived from London today and the airline lost my luggage,” Sherlock says, the lie fabricated on the spot in case he decides not to go home with Blaine tonight. “I don’t even have a toothbrush.”
Sherlock finds himself completely unprepared as to what to say or do. When he imagined John breaking up with Gerald, his imagination skipped over the part where John was sad over his breakup
"I'm asking because there are nursing services that can help with the burden of aftercare for his wounds."
Sherlock was hovering in the air behind Mrs. Hudson when she opened the door. She said, "See, Sherlock! You worried for nothing. There's John—I'm sure it's going to be fine."
. Sherlock had looked askance at him, and experienced one of the first moments of desire that left him breathless.
When John and Gerald stood side by side, nobody would look at them and be able to say one was more dominant than the other, not without getting to know them. Even then, outside of the bedroom there was very little power differential.
, I can do." He gestures towards Sherlock. "I can make you healthy, keep you that way, but I can't do it if you won't let me."
"I bet you were every woman's wet dream," Gerald says and strokes his hand up and down John's stomach. "Now you're every man's wet dream."
"I know you think I have magical powers to connect clues to form a picture, but I must admit I'm stumped on this one."
. He was still on his hands and knees, but Sherlock was urging him up, both hands gripping John's arms now. John stood, dusted his hands and knees off and tried to look at Chatsworth without his brain overreacting.
"John!" Sherlock cried. He opened his mouth as though he would say more, but nothing came out. He blinked a couple of times, his brow furrowing.
Sherlock is in Serbia to wrap up the last of the human trafficking ring that Moriarty's people were responsible for. At this point, Sherlock's vision has narrowed to one thing. John. Every time Sherlock gets the shit beaten out of him, barely escapes getting shot, lives rough, goes a day without food – he pictures John sitting in his chair at the Baker Street flat drinking a cup of tea and waiting for Sherlock to come home.
When John feels Sherlock's fingers trail up and down his burgeoning erection, and one long, slick finger begins to slide down the cleft of his arse, John pulls back suddenly, and, face flushed, says, "I didn't, um—" He jerks his head towards the loo, and Sherlock frowns with impatience, and says, "You didn't what?" and John sighs, and rubs his hand over his forehead, and finally says, "Clean up. I, uh, I didn't—I have to
emails were sent back and forth between me and Jenn and Katie. That comes out to 1,505 words per email.
Gerald pauses and John knows he's trying to think of how to phrase whatever he's about to say next. John braces himself for a lecture about letting go and moving on, like he's not aware that's the accepted route grief should take, so he's surprised by what Gerald actually says.
John gaped at Chatsworth, feeling utterly betrayed. Chatsworth at least managed to look slightly chagrined.
John looks up at him with a pained expression. Sherlock smiles grimly. "That's pretty much exactly why."
Sherlock looks at the pills and then down at his body where he's clutching the blue silk tightly around his waist. His erection hasn't gone down yet and Sherlock hastily covers it with one hand and uses the other to keep his dressing gown around his waist. He looks helplessly at John.
, who he's been fucking for three months and anyway, it's not like he's asking for something gross like pissing on him or pretending to be an infant.
"Oh, I totally am, of course I am!" Rebecca says, grinning. "I didn't know being an aunt made one so impractical. I'm an absolute cooing puddle the minute I see him. It's absolutely disgusting. When you think about it, he's basically a two and a half kilo blob with roughly human features, no personality, and who communicates by shrieking."
"What was the fight about? Or is it too personal." Gerald slips one hand into a pocket of his shorts and swallows a drink of his beer.
"No, no! You don't have to apologize. That's why I'm here—to let you know these things. But I don't want you feeling discouraged when I correct you because, to be honest, bonds like yours and Sherlock's are quite rare and I'd hate to put you off dragons."
Sherlock shook his head. "They're thtupid rulth. No wonder thith country ith falling apart." With that, he picked his chicken bone back up and gave it a good gumming.
John pauses, completely taken off guard, as she finishes sliding into the cab. "You frighten me sometimes, you know," he says finally.
"That sounds ominous!" John said. Yelled, really, as they were trying to hear each other from across the field.
"Hm," John murmurs thoughtfully. "Not a large enough pool of subjects to extrapolate data from," he answers, sounding exactly like Sherlock, reminding him of the two hours he's just spent talking about him. He tells Gerald, "You're so easy to talk to."
"Except for—?" John prompts, turning his finger over a few times to encourage Sherlock to speak. (Even though he really doesn't want him to speak—that's perfectly clear to Sherlock.)
love you, of course I do, Sherlock, you know that, and yes, I want—I mean you, you're beautiful, you're gorgeous, it's just, this isn't how we should—
John can't get his thoughts together—between the dream and his encounter with Sherlock, it feels like he's woken up to a different reality. His broken open heart wants to erect a barrier around itself, but one of them has to stay open, so he goes downstairs into his bedroom, and grabs some pajama bottoms and a t-shirt out of his dresser, and pulls them on. In the kitchen, he fills the kettle, settles it back into the heating coil, and flicks it on. He gets out two mugs, and two tea bags (Twinings, because Sherlock's a snob, and the Tetley John drank for eighteen months no longer passes muster). While the kettle heats up, he pulls eggs, tomatoes, Gruyère, and spring onions out of the fridge. He leans out to catch a glimpse of Sherlock on the couch.
Holmes ducked his head. Nostrils flaring, he looked up and grumbled, "You must keep secret what I'm about to tell you or I will find a more permanent way to remove you from my path." When John made a
After everyone settles down with their tea, Mycroft begins explaining how the press conference is going to go—what time it'll start, when they need to be there, who will participate in the press conference, who will speak, and who will be there just for show. There will be a pre-approved list of questions for the journalists to ask Sherlock, and Mycroft has already found Sherlock a publicist to help him navigate the tricky timing of the press conference.
"You know," John says conversationally. "I can't remember the last time I told you that you were wrong. Can you?"
"I just want you to know that the only thing more disgusting than the thought of eating raw chicken livers is the thought of eating raw
After John explained how many minutes were in an hour and how many hours since John had first touched Sherlock's egg, Sherlock relaxed marginally. He still said

broken. And damaged. And fragile." John walks closer until he's standing right over Sherlock. "Physically and emotionally you are damaged and fragile. That's
"We don't have any secrets," Rebecca says, and laughs deeply. "We're all a bunch of nosy, gossiping busybodies, and he knows
"There's still much to go over, Sherlock," Mycroft says, standing and taking up his umbrella. "I know this is overwhelming, but the press conference is less than two weeks from now, and we have to get it right. Your reputation—"
Another furious twist of his wrist and another drop of pre-ejaculate plops on top of the puddle of existing fluid on Blaine’s belly.
John's gonna take these words that he clings to out of dread and break them down to their literal parts. He's gonna examine each one, throw out any emotional attachment. He's gonna go at these like Sherlock.
"Okay, back up, because I'm confused," Dr. Reed says in his no-nonsense voice that grates on Sherlock's nerves even as he's grateful for it. "Are you saying that's all you have to
"Are you fucking kidding me?" John shouted, looking at Sherlock's egg with a face creased with incredulity. Then he looked up at Holmes. "This—this—smarmy bastard is your
"Only for you, sweetheart," John says with a wink. Sherlock can hear him whistling all the way down the stairs.
. John sighs against Gerald's neck. Gerald's cheek brushes John's temple. The way Gerald smells is familiar—the fit of his body against John's is comfortable. There's nothing sexual in this hug, though. There's a wistful, bittersweet nature to their embrace—it's apology and forgiveness in one gesture.
The party winds down much earlier than most of them are used to. Eventually, it's time for Milton's bottle and bed. Bernie and Olivia are beginning to look a little ragged as well.
"The truth is that I didn't work right until I met you, and maybe that's not what other people think about when they think of love, but I only work right when I'm with you, even when I want to throw you off a roof myself, and I couldn't possibly in a million years
Gerald's eyes widen in surprise, though he does his best to cover it. They've had lots of anal play, but never sex. They've only discussed it a few times, and each time agreed it was a topic for the future. Gerald's sexual history is tame. He's only had six lovers and one was the six-month fling with his best friend, Cyril. Of those six, Gerald's only had anal sex with two of them. John's had far too many lovers to count, but they were all women.
sorry," and kisses him a third time, pulls away, and says, "I'm—" but John interrupts him, and says, smiling, "Sorry, yes, I get it. But we're all right, yeah?" He brings his hand up and cups Sherlock's cheek, and then John kisses Sherlock, his hands resting lightly on Sherlock's waist, but the kiss—like all their kisses the last two days—quickly becomes heated, and soft moans and gasps fill the air. One of John's hands tighten on Sherlock's waist, and the other moves down to cup his arse, giving it a squeeze. John pulls back, nipping along Sherlock's jaw to his ear, and says, "That thing you did yesterday morning?" and Sherlock says, breathlessly, "Yeah?" even though it was a rhetorical question. John says, "I'm gonna do that to you. After they leave."
—amount of drool Sherlock was producing, John made a bib of sorts out of an old t-shirt, sliding Sherlock's head through the neck and then folding the rest of the t-shirt up and tucking it inside the arm holes. Sherlock ended up looking like one of those rescue Saint Bernard's with the cylindrical attachment to their collars.
and disposes of the condom. He comes back to bed with a glass of water half full which he hands to John. John downs it all then flops back on the bed on his stomach.
eyes…looking like you wanted to kill him," Sherlock mutters while simultaneously trying to use his mouth to kiss John who says
"Okay," Gerald says a little dazedly, which makes John grin, showing all his teeth, which makes Gerald groan and remark on the arousing effect of John's high watt smile.
"That's what people say when there's something important to discuss, usually something the other person isn't aware of. It's an announcement of sorts, so that the other person knows they need to be serious and listen."
"Because Gerald himself was in love with his best friend. And he was always going to be a tiny bit in love with someone else, and a tiny bit emotionally unavailable."
"Nonsense! You're breathing just fine." Sherlock's head came to rest on John's shoulder, and he rubbed his cheek on John's.
we can!" John said, exploding out of bed. His eyes kept straying over Sherlock's naked body so he rushed to his suitcase and pulled out a t-shirt and boxers. He handed them to Sherlock. "Put these on. I'll be waiting in the kitchen so you can have some privacy."
Rebecca, unrepentant, grins and continues. "Speaking of not showing up, you and Sherlock haven't left the flat much, either, have you? With all
bit impatient with the glacial progression of time during that part of the flashback recovery process.
John ate, called into work claiming a family emergency (which it was, in a way) and then made himself a pallet next to the egg. He was frustrated that he couldn't reach over the top to touch the egg so he levered out two of the slats in the side and stuck his hand through. Once he'd gotten that situated, he took the temperature of the egg again.
"At the time, I was just getting into the dom/sub lifestyle and one day a female client of mine – a very beautiful and successful woman – said she wished someone would just
"Well," Chatsworth said slowly, "it's what they call the rules of Succession. It's both law and a matter of tradition. In other words, it's always been done that way, so…" Chatsworth shrugged.
not a dragon. What if he doesn't—" John began, but realized that he didn't know how to articulate his fear.
. I never know if I'm coming or going! I'm forthright, and honest, and, yet, he seems to think I need to be handled like—like—
"Danilo raped me again two weeks after Zivko and that's when he—he caused the anal fissure. A week later I found out Zivko had committed suicide. Four days after that, Mycroft was able to pull me out of Serbia. Zivko was only sixteen, John."
Sherlock throws himself out of the bed, and grabs his tartan dressing gown (rescued from the boxes upstairs), and pulls it around himself, before saying, his voice deep and dangerous, every word bitten off, "I know what you said. But I also know that even if we had the time, you'd still say no. You seem to forget that I can read you—hell,
His symptoms were the same as thousands of other soldiers who came home from war, but the therapists he saw
Sherlock's eyes go wide, and he starts to smile, but John says, "Uhn uh—you're not going to kick them out just so we can have sex," and Sherlock's face falls into a pout right as there's a light knock on the door. They both startle, looking towards the door like two schoolboys caught doing something they shouldn't.
need to move slowly, even if you do not. Let's start with holding hands and not jump straight to penetrative sex."
But he also reads about high heels being a signifier of power in women and that the same could be true for men.
The SUV slows down and then pulls over to the side of the road. Elspeth comes around the passenger side of the back seat and helps him out. She pulls a key out and unlocks his handcuffs and keeps a firm hand wrapped around his upper arm, steadying him.
"I'm a doctor, Mycroft. I don't know how I could've missed the signs of depression. I should've known something was wrong – his obsession with Moriarty was eating him up. I felt him drawing away but Sherlock was the least likely person I've ever met to commit suicide."
Because I'm desperate for attention, this chapter has been snuck in under the beta radar, which means Jenn and Katie, betas extraordinaire, haven't read it first. All mistakes are mine.
John makes for the shower while Sherlock's distracted by brotherly staring contest between himself and Mycroft.
hygiene habits, and when he's finished, he throws everything that needs to be washed into the tub, washes his hands, brushes his teeth, and stares at his face in the mirror, until Sherlock opens the door and grabs John's arm, and says, "Get in here," and drags him in before depositing him on the bed. "Hands and knees," he snaps. John crawls to the head of the bed, while Sherlock climbs over to the other side, and says, "No, put your knees on the edge of the bed—here," so John does.
"Okay, but what's the big secret? Why won't you and Gerald say anything? I mean, who is this bloke, that you would break up with Gerald the minute he comes back to London?"
or a doula on the side birthing a baby? It has been awesome to watch it all come together and be a part of it.
John gets them clean and dries them off. Looks at the inside of Sherlock's lips, and makes him brush his teeth even though Sherlock bitches and moans about it, which John pretends is all exaggerated, even though John knows it stings like hell. When John gives him a glass of water, Sherlock drinks it, but by the time they make it to the bedroom, both of them still naked, Sherlock collapses on the bed, and almost slides off before John catches him, his lower back straining with the effort to push Sherlock back off the edge. When John pushes himself to his feet, the muscles of his lower back feel like they're trying to strain the
"Well, we'll cross that road when we come to it. For now, pain management and nutrition are my priorities. I'm afraid it's porridge again this morning."
Chatsworth chuckled wearily when he heard. "No, we only get the one set of teeth. If we lose one, another one grows in its place, but tell him it's a completely painless process."
Sherlock nods. "The head guard, Danilo, was behind it all. He hated Zivko, was jealous of him because he had a famous father—his famous father who, incidentally, ran a human trafficking ring--who had given Zivko the guard duty in that hellhole
