“Oh,” Tony says, and he looks relieved. “Hey, do you want to help me? We still need to paint the far wall.”
“I’m not sure, but it might start to burn in an hour or so. As in, second-degree burns or worse. I can’t quite tell how corrosive it’ll be to skin but I don’t think we should find out, Steve.”
But, like all the other times, he just keeps pushing despite his best judgment.
anymore, and it’s killing him slowly.
Dr Matty won’t stop shaking her head and marveling at the efficiency of the serum, and Steve would have laughed with her, if it wasn’t currently complicating his life.
Bucky looks lost, and confused, and
He doesn’t comment, however, and Bucky is grateful.
He swears colorfully and curses his job but is already reaching out his arms, ready for the titanium parts to fit smoothly around his body. He races outside as fast as he can, already spying Steve and the others jumping into the quinjet, which is already slightly off the ground.
Bucky rolls his eyes to cover the shiver of want that rattles his very bones, replying with a vague: “Oh, is that so?”
Tony nods, wondering why Steve specifically but telling himself to stay quiet because
last thing: the body pillow thing was just me giggling about how justin bieber body pilows used to be all the rage lol
“Take your shirt off, it’ll feel better,” he says gruffly, but makes no move to remove his own.
It’s dirty and grimy and bits of chewed up gum are stuck to the walls and cobble-stoned floor, discolored wads that are hard to the touch and probably harder still to chew. There’s a greasy puddle next to a rubbish bin, the unidentifiable liquid creased by swirls of colorful… oil? Bucky doesn’t know.
Bucky stretches his other arm over himself awkwardly and feels around where his shoulder and the metal connect, trying to find the little tiny button. The pad of his first finger catches on something so he presses desperately in that area, screwing his eyes shut as he is forced to twist even more on himself, his other shoulder
Tony takes a deep breath and looks down at the glowing blue tablet in his hands. “I think I was a little hasty in agreeing,” he admits, and Bucky cocks his eyebrows, as if saying,
“Yeah, I didn’t think so either,” Tony mumbles. “Would probably fall and crack my head open, or something.”
Bucky pushes him back gently into the rocking chair. He clears his throat and nudges Tony’s chin up with the knuckles of his hand. “Nightmares?” he rasps.
Bucky clenches his jaw, looks away, and reminds himself that it isn’t Tony’s fault. None of this is. He just wants the truth, he wants to hear his boyfriend’s side of the story. Still, it’s in a carefully measured tone of voice that he answers. It’s the knowledge that this might be the end of them that keeps him from going over and shaking the man upfront.
“Do you want that?” Steve asks, his voice low, unhurried. His eyes, though. His
except...
“Steve, look at me,” Bucky says, and grabs Steve’s jaw firmly, turning his face until his exhausted eyes meet Bucky’s. “I’m sorry,” he says firmly, and ignores how his voice cracks a little.
...but then his vision blinks and grays, his head starts to swim, his legs buckle, and his fatigue finally claims him, rushing forward with welcoming darkness.
Tony holds his gaze. He believes him. Once, Steve’s word wasn’t enough. But now? After all that’s happened? It’s everything.
That had really been the stopping point, Steve thought. Where he’d drawn at least thrice a week before Tony had told him the Winter Soldier was Bucky and Bucky was the Winter Soldier, there’d suddenly been no time to draw while looking for him, and he’d never quite picked it up again.
The Soldier snorts at that, and comes a little closer, before his eyes narrow and he holds up his metal hand, still clenched around the mystery object. “This cannot happen again,” he growls and throws the contents of his palm at Tony.
It was just so… complicated, at the moment, and to add Steve like that, add him to a scene where he was Tony’s family, it seems almost unfair to him.
Bruce smiles faintly at him and pulls a face when Clint drops his towel right in front of him, grabbing the clothes from his grasp and pulling them on.
He can’t sleep at night from nervousness, and when he does manage to close his eyes, he sleeps restlessly, tossing and turning. He’s also taken to rubbing his baby bump which now shows through most t-shirts, so he’s started wearing his baggiest ones, but even then it’s a little visible.
He turned in Bucky’s arms to hug him properly. “I’m not going to say I’m sorry,” he mutters, “but for what it’s worth, I’m glad you know.”
Tony valiantly grasps at his usual charm. “‘Course I am, sugarplum. I’m with you, aren’t I?”
“Safe to blast?”
Steve comes to a halt barely half a foot away from Tony, and Tony opens his mouth to say something, anything, to get out of this uncomfortable situation because Steve is too close,
Steve isn’t naive enough to think that meant he had any sort of chance, and besides, Tony and Bucky are together, but maybe the opportunity for a tentative friendship’s on the line?
“Because I think it does matter,” Bucky answers. “See that door over there? You
Directly in front of his nose, several feet away on a drafting table, is his metal arm. It glints a little in the blue lighting of the workshop, and it takes a minute for him to realize the edge of it is shiny with blood. There’s also a pool of yellowish liquid surrounding the stump, flowing sluggishly from the arm.
“I’m going to go check on Tony,” he says, and stands. “Barnes, don’t let him fall asleep.”
Tony smiles a little. “Yeah, I put that one in. I hope that’s okay?” He turns faintly worried eyes on Bucky. “We can take it out if it makes you uncomfortable or whatever,” he mumbles.
Bucky makes his way to the refrigerator and peeks inside, looking for the cheerful yellow color of a ripe lemon peel. Tony had started craving various things about two weeks ago, a fortnight after Bucky had Opened the Sketchbook, and extremely late for a normal pregnancy. The doctor had assured them in their panicked states, however, that everything was alright with her and Tony, and every person was different. He’d even gotten another ultrasound, and there was a small line up of them taped to one of the walls in the workshop.
, that will soften the blow Bucky’s dealt him, but one look at his best friend erases the thought entirely.
Gottoomanyships - speedy the sloth
It makes his heart hurt to think about it. It hurts more to think about than Tony or Bucky, because she’s
, Steve sits back, panting a little. Helpless laughter breaks through his lips as Bucky glares at him in between wheezes, gaze promising murder.
“Fuck you, Bucky,” Tony snarks back lightly. “I’ve fucked girls.”
Bucky is suddenly pulled away from the warmth of Steve’s chest and set down on an unrelentingly hard surface, and he very nearly whines, wanting the comfort of Steve back.
Growing up, Howard had often told him stories of Bucky, referring to him as “one of the best goddamned snipers the army had ever seen”. Ten-year-old Tony had, of course, thought that quality particularly admirable, and had often asked what the extent of Captain America’s best friend’s abilities were.
“Fuckin’ hot in there,” Tony hears Clint complain while he undresses, completely shameless in front of his teammates. Tony notices that Steve has his head turned firmly away, a light blush sweeping the back of his neck, and smiles a little to himself. No matter how comfortable the rest of the team gets around their Captain, it’s never quite returned.
Bucky’s eyes, the color of a storm and normally containing the energy of one, are almost flat. He looks like he hasn’t slept in the entire week they’ve all been split apart, and his pose, although casual-looking, is anything but. His shoulders are hunched in a bit, his jaw set, his hands a little too still. His hair looks like it hasn’t really been washed,
“You said I was different, you said I changed, but even so,
Tony raises his eyebrows. “I give you a shiny new bike and you’re not even going to steal out into the night with it?”
keep breaking down like this.
“I, uh, also shouldn't have kissed you that second time? That was a pretty dick move.”
Tony by himself has to take breaks throughout the day, to stretch his aching his back, and the whole team watches in amusement when he forgets where he put his paintbrush after setting it down to talk to Bruce. He stumbles around looking for it as they laugh, cursing his pregnancy and “unreliable brain”.
” Tony gasps. “What do you take me for? A rich egomaniac?”
“Sarah was a nurse. Sometimes people’d come up to her door ‘bout ready to pop,” he tells Tony.
No amount of pleading or force from the others would probably ever be able to drag him up from the bottom of a bottle, that’s for sure.
“Yes it is,” Steve says firmly. “I’m the same I always was.”
Initially, Rhodey freezes, but it doesn’t last. Rhodey straightens his back almost unconsciously, standing as straight as possible. The other man takes no notice and continues smiling as he approaches him, a smile on his face.
Bruce also kept his thoughts to himself, privately thinking that he isn’t sure whether that particular bit of partial amnesia was due to the concussion, or the event that led to Steve’s apparent breakdown, but either way, it’d get fixed soon enough.
“Hey, are you okay?” Tony asks, and Steve swallows heavily, but doesn’t say anything, doesn't look up. Belatedly, Tony realizes Steve’s breathing is slightly ragged, and when he approaches the bed to take a closer look, the light filtering through the window glitters on two silver tear tracks running in straight lines down his face.
Bucky sucks in deep breaths, trying to stave off nausea rising in his gut. It would not be a good idea to throw up on Tony.
When Tony makes no move to grab them Steve sighs and accepts both sets, tucking them securely under his arm. “C’mon,” he says quietly to Tony, who ignores him in favor of glaring at Clint, who is leering at him while walking with the rest of the team out of the quinjet.
It’s been two weeks now, and Tony has been staying almost exclusively in his workshop. Nausea follows him through the day now, but he only really throws up in the morning. He’s taken to just eating really bland things throughout the day, as anything more flavorful makes his stomach immediately protest.
He turns around quickly and arranges some of the boxes in front of the window so they can’t see directly inside, knowing that it wouldn’t fool a fly into thinking the window was still there, but feeling the need to try anyway.
The worst part is that Tony doesn’t even know the whole story. He knows Bucky said some things he probably shouldn’t have, and he knows he and Steve aren’t talking, but he doesn’t know how Bucky had aimed straight for Steve’s jugular, how he’d purposely said the most harmful thing he possibly could because he felt...
“How do you feel about attaching a new arm, Barnes?”
“No,” Tony tells him, the confidence in his voice wavering. “No, I’m not.”
“Truthfully? I’m not sure,” Tony says, settling his hands in his lap like an overgrown schoolgirl. “I’m sorry for being an ass earlier,” he offers.
Steve scrubs a hand over his face. “I know you’ve been throwing up every morning for two weeks, Tony.”
The Soldier shudders suddenly, a whole spasm that shakes his entire body. His eyes flicker with something, relief, maybe, but they soon close off as his normal expression takes over his face. The only thing there now is a grim, haunted look in his eyes, one that makes him look ages older.
“Hey, nice aim!”
Tony thinks. He wonders, then, why he can practically feel the worry and kindness pouring out of him in waves, if it’s absent from his features.
It’s quiet. Too quiet. The only sounds are of rustling fabric against skin, and the low hiss of the showers in the next room.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Barnes. Was that too much for you? I’ll try to be more PG next time, scout’s honor.”
They’re having a nice time, working quietly together in the bowels of the Cadillac, before JARVIS gently reminds him of his dinner with Steve.
Bucky glares at him, but the corner of his mouth twitches, as if he’s very used to that sort of behavior. Tony thinks that he must have been quite the charmer back in the day.
Bucky thinks this situation qualifies.
He looks away, stomach rolling, and notes absently that he’s lying on a soft surface; probably Tony’s couch. He’s on his side, his flesh arm tucked underneath him, numb with the weight.
“Don’t you–” Steve clears his throat, tries again. “Don’t you think we need a little space?”
“What do you mean they need me here? For what?”
“Is out of the picture,” Tony says firmly. “He… hasn’t really said anything, and I think that’s confirmation enough.” He looks away.
He has a hunch, but he doesn’t want to pry. He tries another question. “Do you think we should try to talk to him again?”
Bucky tugs his bottom lip in between his teeth before he sighs. “We’re both going to therapy, Tony, and Steve’s on medication and a temporary break from the Avengers. We’re doing all we can, and while I can promise you if something does arise where we’re unhealthy to ourselves or each other, we’ll take a step back, but I really don’t think we need to.”
The worst part is, they live
The call is in some city half an hour away by suit, and the antagonist is on the outskirts of the city, looking like they’re going to stay there for a while. Here there’s more greenery and highway than actual buildings, and Tony breathes a sigh of private relief, glad there aren’t too many civilians.
im going to update every two weeks, cannot keep up.
“Aw, no,” Clint whines. “Come on, can’t we just take regular showers?”
“I’m gonna check for chemicals, okay?” He hears Tony ask. Before he can muster up the strength to nod, the sharp jab of a needle is pierced into his bicep and left in for a few seconds before it’s pulled out.
“A red panda, sir,” Jarvis corrects, and Tony thanks him, turning the animal in his hands. His mouth drops into a straight line and he dangles the animal in front of Bucky’s face.
“Why? Why, Steve? Why couldn’t you have just left me? I’d still be there after you and Tony sorted your shit out.” It’s a lie, of course. Bucky wouldn’t have been there. But of course, Steve doesn’t need to know that.
He lost him in a fit of cowardice, when he just couldn’t take it anymore. It was an act of desperation, of wanting to crawl out of his own skin, and the consequences of said action were far greater than he could have ever imagined.
“Yeah, sure, Robocop. Now kiss me,” he demands, and Bucky complies.
“Sorry,” Bucky responds in his low husk of a voice. “Sniper,” he says as a way of explaining.
“Sarah Rogers.”
“Jerk,” Tony shoots back.
Steve forced himself to believe it, to shut out the Tony he saw in his peripheral vision, only see the one he was forcing himself to see. He’d thought he had it, he’d thought he’d finally done it and reduced Tony to an ugly person in his mind, but obviously not, because the next thing Steve knew, he was pounding Tony into the wall.
Thor nods, and this time Tony can’t help the bubble of laughter. “Thank you, they’re wonderful. I’m sure she’ll enjoy them.”
Tony has a new goal, and he’s already diving in. He doesn’t have much choice, after all. Yesterday, they got a message from Sam, who sounded exhausted, saying that they had found the Winter Soldier and were going to bring him back to the Tower in three weeks. Three weeks meant Tony would be more visible, and it would be more difficult to conceal the bump. Three weeks meant he would know the gender, and the thought that there was a tiny human in him would be more tangible than ever.
“Yeah, okay. Thanks, Jarvis.”
“Yes.”
“I mean, why not?” Bucky breathes.
Since then, Steve had looked forward to their sleepovers for a different reason.
“Measurements? For what?”
Lastly, thank you to these wonderful people:
They stop for gas. It’s about twenty minutes from when Bucky’d taken off his arm, and he’s spent his time going through the boxes quietly and foraging for anything useful. Most of the boxes do, in fact, have shoes in them, but Bucky needs something preferably sharp… he can barely contain his smile when he sees one full of stilettos, all colors.
It might be because she was so skinny, almost as thin as he was before he had the serum. She could have had a whole life ahead of her. If only he has done his job properly, hunting all those scumbags, this wouldn't have had happened to her.
Her clothes was torn as if it was clawed into shreds, yet Steve could not discern a single wound. If the symbiote did manage to slash Ruby and she healed perfectly in the matter of minutes that it took them to get here, then her abilities might have been more advanced than they thought. Even with the serum, Steve and Bucky couldn't heal as fast as this.
Someone shouted again. But this time, it was clearer. It had more conviction and authority.
Tony clicked his tongue in irritation. How the hell was he supposed to help the girl if he couldn’t even identify the source of the problem? Steve must have noticed his apprehension because he lightly clapped Tony’s shoulder to get his attention and smiled, “Let’s take her home, okay?”  Tony nodded and positioned Ruby in a comfortable position in his arms to fly home.
Once Natasha decoded the encrypted protection, she found a daunting folder screaming the words "PROJECT: INFINITY" in red bold letters. Windows and windows of dated journals popped out of the screen.
"As much as I like these cheesy atmosphere going on, I'd like to inform everybody that I'm awake now. Thank you for your concern."
Stephen was torn between feeling angered by the fact that Mordo gave Eternity the leeway he needed to effectively destroy this dimension, and feeling thankful that his consciousness was forever lost, because the doctor was still unsure if he would be able to kill his previous ally when it comes down to it, despite of his betrayal. Nonetheless, none of this could change the fact that two cosmic entities, who he knew had bad history between them, were residing here on earth.
Sensing the brooding silence that was sure to follow, Tony hastily made a suggestion. "Hey kid, you wanna go outside? There's this theme park in Brooklyn we could spend the day in if you want to?"
Tony struggled to support Peter’s dead weight upright so Steve led them to the couch to sit down. They allowed the boy to bow his head down in between his legs to calm himself and ride out his panic attack. After some time, Peter took a deep breath in and exhaled out loudly. He tried to clear his head but he was still overwhelmed by the sheer amount of anxiety he could feel about Ruby’s disappearance.
With no more words exchanged between them, all the three of them continued with their work. Once all of the cupcakes had been iced, Spidey placed the 3 main ones with their designs on a separate tray and shouted for Clint to come in the kitchen.
Steve smiled and took a sip from his water bottle. Tony patted her shoulder before hopping down to the chair she was previously sitting at.
Steve rolled his eyes at both Tony and Ruby who chuckled and high-fived each other. Actually, why the hell did Steve not take a cab? He mentally smacked himself silly at the thought. No doubt he wouldn't hear the end of it from Bucky once these two have told the rest of the team.
"Natasha! Save me!" Peter jumped over the counter and hid behind Natasha, which looked absolutely ridiculous considering she was so much shorter and was holding a piping bag.
Raising his hand, he took hold of Ruby’s cheeks and pinched them between his thumb and forefinger, forcing her to look up. Mordo’s eyes glinted azure and Ruby felt the beginnings of scorching heat from her stomach. Soon, it spread on onto her whole body.
She tried to get up; twisting on her side to use her elbow to pull herself up. When she noticed that she couldn't support her own weight, she leaned against the metal support of the stretcher. Her eyes drifted to Steve sitting opposite to her where her stretcher was, assessing him up and down as if to identify whether he was a threat or not.
"How about we agree you never talk to me? Dear." Ruby replied sarcastically, knowing full well that she was speaking out loud. Nobody's here so she's not at risk of being called deranged, insane and mentally unstable.
They were eating comfortably and were chatting about the things they do in their spare time. Ruby found both the boys so endearing. Ned was just a cute meatball and Parker was a huge ball of energy, always talking with passion and dedication about the things he love. All of a sudden, Parker scrambled to stuff the rest of his food in his mouth and snatched his bag.
Ruby had never felt this kind of power.
"How about Gaylord?" Ruby said with a dramatic hair flick but Spidey just gave her an unamused stare. This is probably what Tony felt when he himself asked him stupid questions like this.
"Just make sure that everything's cleaned before we get home if you decide to host a party in here." Ruby chuckled at Tony's joke while shaking her head.
To take his mind off the distraction, Tony decided to make use of his hands. He opened all the drawers visible from his position.
"I'll go if Steve goes." Ruby negotiated.
Hurriedly, Tony pulled out an AI that was still in the making. It wasn’t advanced enough and fully developed yet but he was confident that it could track where this feed was filming. Right at the start, Tony knew that this was being filmed live and thanked whoever was there above that this man was stupid enough to send them a live camera feed. It gave them more than enough of a lead to track Ruby down.
As the training continued, not only did Steve found out that Ruby possessed increased strength and stamina but enhanced speed and endurance as well. It was with the little things did her ability slipped out. Like when she managed to block Steve's punch with her arm, despite of deliberately landing a faster blow, and actually making him stumble a little bit backwards.
"Let me take you home." Peter insisted after Ned took a left towards his street.
Ruby’s breathing began to get shallower and shallower by every second. Once Steve managed to reassure Tony that he wasn't suffering from any serious injuries from Ruby's attack, both men gathered themselves and approached the teenager.
"Good Afternoon, Sir." The Captain greeted him.
"Stop laughing and don't call me Princess." She warned one more time but soon regretted it because the next thing she knew, Tony loosened her grip and she was falling.
“That’s Ruby’s soul.” Stephen pointed at the glowing orb in the entity’s hand when he saw Steve and Tony’s confused expressions.
"He's on his way."
“Hey, Mr Stark! What’s up?” Peter happily greeted on the other line.
When Peter said that he knew the perfect place, Ruby assumed they will be sitting at the top of one of the highest buildings in New York, not the freaking Statue of Liberty.
"Are you lost? We could help you out if you want to." Ned offered but Parker, that's what Ruby decided to call Peter Number 2, looked like he was ready to bolt with the way he was tapping the strap of his backpack with his forefinger and looking at the end of the hallway.
"No! Please don't!" Ruby shouted, then instantly closed her mouth when she realised how loud that was. "I don't want to bother Tony any much more than I'm bothering him now. So please, Friday. Don't tell him. I know he's a very busy man and he can't afford to worry about some teenager who can't even go to sleep."
"I told Friday not to bother anyone. I'm sorry." She muttered guiltily before taking a sip of her coffee.
Not in a million years would he have expected that Mordo had been possessed by Eternity himself. Stephen didn’t know about it until he sensed a strong pull of mystic energy from a spell being incanted involving the demon dimension and immediately transported himself to the Avengers Tower to warn his fellow heroes.
Her panic lessened when she heard the Voice again. She didn't even think twice to gather her energy. She could feel her power surging through her veins, quickly travelling down her calves and arms. Soon she felt it surround her. Almost like an invisible veil of energy wrapped tight to her body like a second skin. And it helped her find her balance.
"You insolent brat!" With her senses still not in array, Ruby wasn't able to keep herself from crying out when the vile principal smashed a hammer down her forearm. A sickening crack of bones echoed in the room along with the sound of the door being opened.
"Then you should understand, Tony. The girl could be enhanced and with Hydra out there, we might as well give her gift wrapped to them if you're going to let her go to college." Steve argued. Ruby would be vulnerable outside there and not to offend anyone, but the girl could actually be pretty reckless sometimes considering how she thought smacking an eight feet tall symbiote with a pipe would work out in her favour. It's only been a month since they've rescued her and everybody knew that Hydra doesn't give up that easily.
Jumping as high as she could, Ruby slammed the pipe down hard onto the creature's shoulder. It looked like the monster took a moment to register that something tickled him because it paused, then slowly turned around and looked at Ruby. It stared at her for a couple of seconds, its long tongue dripping with saliva swung menacingly in a low warning.
It took quite a while of murmured soothing before Ruby finally got her proper state of mind back.
"I'm going to be fine here alone. I don't want to be the reason why the Avengers were lacking man power for a mission just to take care of a teenager. And just like you said, I got Friday."
"Nah, I've read it somewhere before. I didn't really understand the whole thing but now that you've explained it, I think I get the gist of it." He gave her a small smile before continuing on with his facts.
"Yeah, you do that."
Huh, would that mean he'll be called the Winter Chipmunk?
“After my brother and I began our quarrel, the purpose of my existence had been solely reduced to one thing: to find that one unique person to bond my soul with in order to stop my brother.” Infinity reached out a hand and cupped her right cheek.
The next thing Tony knew, he heard a series of consecutive grunts of pain accompanied by a familiar reverberating clang of a metal shield. Cap caught his shield back with his left hand. Looks like the west wing would be rapidly clearing.
Barely managing to stabilise his mystic energy, Stephen focused until his consciousness was face to face to Infinity. The entity’s appearance surpassed his wildest imagination. Her eyes burned with the rage of fire and he could feel the power surging off from the cosmic being, overwhelming his own consciousness. Infinity smiled at the doctor, but he couldn’t decide whether that smile was laced with kindness or a hidden motive.
“Steven Grant, if I have to tell you one more time to pick up that sketchbook, I would burn your paintings.” The captain just raised an eyebrow at Tony’s threat. It wasn’t like the sketchbook was disturbing his work. Plus, it wasn’t even big enough to occupy a sixth of Tony’s desk. He could live having that around for at least an hour. When Tony noticed that Steve wasn’t reacting, he raised his head at gave him a narrowed look.
Out of sympathy for their friend, both Steve and Natasha decided not to call him out about it. At least not in front of everyone.
Mordo was burning her.
"Bye, Peter! Next time, we should totally watch Lord of the Rings together." Ruby said as he hopped in the elevator.
"Sorry about the uh, you know, uh, yeah. Sorry."
"If you're gonna stay in my Tower, might as well call me Tony, kid." Mr Stark, uh, Tony, said when Ruby expressed her gratitude.
"Likewise."
Plus, who was she to reject an offer coming from
"Uhm, yeah sure. That'll be nice, Ruby." He replied just in time before the elevator doors closed.
"That's enough. Thank you." She smiled and kissed him on the cheek before turning back her focus on mixing the sauce.
"Hello, Young Sir. Ruby." The AI replied back. "Glad you've decided to join us tonight."
Fury noticed the way Captain Rogers was scrutinising the photos one by one.
Ruby resisted the urge to slap the waitress and forced a smile instead, "Fuck off." With a fake laugh, she patted the waitress’ shoulders and dusted away imaginary dirt at her clothes. “I’m just joking.” She said. “But seriously, mind your own business and do your fucking job.”
“Hey kid, how was the movie?”
“Infinity.” Stephen told his companions. He immediately recognised her because her eyes glowed with the burning rage of fire as he saw a moment ago. “This must be her vessel before she bonded with Ruby.”
"Make sure to go down the communal floor for lunch at noon."
That would be so cool, though.
Even then, Ruby swallowed the lump in her throat and lied, "It was nice meeting you as well, Mr O'malley."
People were already gathering around them, trying to gossip about what happened, which really annoyed Steve who was so ready to tell them off in a not very nice way. As if sensing his irritation, Tony proceeded to dismiss the crowd away,"Alright, show's over people! Skittle along! Off you go."
of doctor, right?" He asked.
“We’re on an alternate dimensional reality. This is earth 3490. Infinity wanted us to see this, though I’ve no idea why.” Stephen explained.
as Princess Shuri liked to call it. She had been kind enough to drop by the Tower two days after Bucky just settled in to his new home together with Steve, to explain the mechanics of his new arm and give instructions on how to handle adjustments and whatnot.
When Peter had enough, he decided to resort to more drastic measures. He took his glove off and raised his dominant hand as high up as he could. “I am
“Alright, first things first, son. This is not your fault.” Steve clarified as he placed a comforting hand on the boy’s shoulder. “You couldn’t have known. She decided to go back home by herself and something happened. It was no one’s fault. alright?” Peter nodded at the Captain’s words even though he didn’t believe them. However, now is not the time to play the blaming game.
Thank you for still reading on this far and I hope to see you guys on my next chapter!
Ruby watched in amazement as the creation of the universe flashed before her eyes. She couldn’t believe and comprehend even the slightest complexity of what she was seeing but there was two things that she understood. First, was that all that’s created were good and second, the life of the universe fuelled both the cosmic entities’ hearts. Ruby didn’t even know whether she was worthy enough to know all these things.
He froze in place, not wanting to cause the girl to freak out.
The cosmic entity expected Ruby to accept the situation and move on. She hoped for the young girl’s safe and joyous journey to the afterlife where she would spend the last of her time before being reborn to a new life. Hence, Infinity was completely taken aback when Ruby took hold of her hand and faced her with determined eyes.
As soon as the doors closed, a feminine voice greeted them. "Hello Boss. Captain Rogers. I see that Miss Reid is with you. Would you like me to direct you to the penthouse or the communal floor?"
God, even herself thought she sounded crazy.
Ruby was actually hoping that Dr Banner would take so much time creating her medical profile because once he's finished, that's it. Mr Stark and Steve would leave her here and Dr Banner would probably pass her onto the next doctor.
"I'm so sorry." She apologised as she threw her arms around Bucky. She didn't know why she felt so emotional but all she knew was that she was back with the people she felt safe with who she was starting to think of her own family somehow. But she wouldn't ever tell them that. The Avengers had all other better things to do, like save the world twice all over again. They didn't need a clingy teenager asking for their attention like she had the right to.
But damn it if she wasn't competitive. No way in hell is she just going to stand here gaping like a dying fish. With a hard steel motivation, she pushed herself up and gave it her best to pursue Bucky.
"At least I didn't have to walk."
Ruby wondered if he would drop by the tower today.
Not even a second after, Ruby felt the most excruciating pain she ever experienced in her life. It was like her temples got impaled straight through. Then a sharp, burning hot twinge started at the middle of her chest, running down her arms, until it spread all over her body. Her fists were clenched in agony, fingers curled up tightly, as power surged through her veins making them glow a fiery bright orange.
Peter finished frying just as Tony and Bucky sauntered their way into the kitchen. He quickly plated them and placed it in front of the three men they were trying to make up to. Well, just two, since Bucky wasn't technically counted. Ruby gave them waffles identical to what Steve had and the two just stood in front of the three superheroes, apron and all.
She heard the Voice say. She smiled, hoping that the Voice could see it, before she closed her eyes.
She wanted to have some oranges but she can't find any? She just opened her palm and look, a basket of assorted fruits formed out of thin air.
“You all headed home?” Steve’s head snapped up at Tony’s question.
Both Steve and Peter galloped to where Tony was kneeling beside the unconscious teenager. Tony turned her over, just to check to for any injuries, but there was really no wound at all that could indicate where all this blood came from. Not even a scratch. In fact, Ruby’s whole body was slightly glimmering, still enveloped in that amber glow.
was a success.
"Shut up."
He looked down and frowned. Fury doesn't usually call them on a Sunday unless there's an emergency.
Cap said once they've landed the quinjet in a secure landing site.
"Ned and I we're just going to go grab lunch. You want to come with us?"
"Up to your rooms, kiddos." Steve ordered and the two proceeded to the elevator with both their heads hung down in defeat. Peter only gave a small sad smile before getting off his floor which Ruby returned with one of her own. Once inside her bedroom, she quickly changed into pyjamas and turned her lamp on before turning off the main switches of her lights. She just tucked herself in to try get some sleep when she heard a soft knock against the glass of her window.
"Ruby, you will be training with me starting tomorrow."
building down. Perhaps even the next three next to it.
"You're going to Brooklyn. Think again if you think I'm gonna miss that for the world."
"Okay! Go get 'em!" Ned, on the other hand, seemed completely used to at his friend's behaviour and just went back on chewing his burger. Although Ruby's not quite sure who was Parker's supposed to get. Weird.
Ruby listened to the sound of her breathing. She inhaled, feeling her lungs expand as she sucked air in, and exhaled slowly. She continued to listen to her herself, inhale and exhale, until it lulled her to her sleep.
It was too late. The demon was already within attacking distance when she turned her back so Ruby had no choice but to close her eyes and prepare for impact.
Ruby had been so focused at looking down her schedule that she didn't notice there were two guys approaching her way. Said guys weren't paying attention to where they were walking either since they were so busy chatting about what they would build next in the Star Wars Lego collection.
* * *
Tony commented about getting to know each other more to which Ruby protested that Vision must be left with them too but the android insisted that he wanted to synchronise himself with the surroundings again. Something about being nostalgic with all these familiar places that he hadn't seen for quite a considerable amount of time. Vision, Steve and Tony all scrambled out of the communal floor a while ago to do their own things so it was just Ruby and Wanda left.
normal.
Ruby sighed. "Of course, I'm scared." She admitted. "I've got no one left in the world."
The kid clearly sounded in distress and the team wasted no time to suit up. With the incident's location not too far away from the Tower, the Avengers were confident that they would be able to get in time without the boy being seriously injured. Steve, who was as equally worried that the Spider kid was fighting against the symbiote again, asked Friday to pull up a visual of the fight.
"Go get them yourself." Bucky replied with a huff then proceeded to step over Clint to sit himself beside Natasha.
They all cackled in laughter as they watched the sunset. Technically, they shouldn't be on school grounds anymore since they ditched and all but Ned couldn't really argue with his friends' logic about being in unexpected places in unexpected times. Which sounded a bit dumb, now that he has thought about it. Not that it really mattered.
"Rogers." Steve answered as soon as he was in the kitchen, the sounds coming from the movie faint and unclear.
"I gotta go help save some people." That was all the explanation Ruby got before Peter webbed away, leaving her here with her mouth gaped open in disbelief as she clutched at the backpack in her hand. Not that she hated him for trying to help people but it was just so sudden. Some sort of explanation about what kind of trouble he was going to poke his nose in would have been nice so she wouldn't be dying in worried speculation over here.
“Boss... seems... virus... down...”
What could go wrong?
"I know, I know." Tony cut Steve off. "I also know you're concerned about her abilities." Steve crunched his eyebrows in confusion. How did Tony know about that?
Just like what he told her before, Bucky wanted to tell Ruby that the Avengers themselves were all mentally unstable in their own way if one thought about it. But right now, that's not what Ruby needed. She needed reassurance. Full reassurance that all of her worries would not come into light.
"Where's Steve?" She asked, craning her head left and right, when she realised that only Tony was following her. Said man was found standing in front of an ice cream stand, then came back to them holding out three different flavours of ice cream cones. Ruby chose strawberry and Steve automatically handed Tony the mint chocolate chip one.
"I'll be back next week to work my new suit adjustments with you, Mr Stark." Peter said as he gathered his things and took a few more cupcakes in his bags. Tony nodded his head to acknowledge him and Peter said his goodbyes to everyone.
"Look, you could never hurt me, alright?" Steve said in a gentle voice as she tilted Ruby's chin with his fingers. She held his gaze for a second longer before she dove hastily in Steve's arms and hugged him tight.
"Boss, Captain Rogers is asking for access to the workshop." Friday informed Tony.
Looking down on the floor, Ruby collected her thoughts and raised her chin up once she managed to figure out how to say her apology.
"Then help me understand!" Ruby shouted, extremely close to being in tears.
Peter had had enough so he sucker punched Flash on the stomach. Conveniently, that was when Principal O’Malley arrived at the scene and saw Flash lying on the ground with all the three of them looming over him and the whole class watching. They got automatic detention while Flash got sent to the nurse office, thanks to their useless PE teacher who didn't bother to explain that it was Flash who threw the first punch.
"So what I want you to do is to find out how exactly Hydra is hiding itself from plain view. Gather as much information as you get. Remember that this will be a recon mission. If you encounter hydra agents, do not initiate contact. We will formulate a plan upon your arrival with the intel. You will leave this afternoon. Am I being clear?"
O'Malley entered the room with a medium sized suitcase which he placed on the table beside Ruby's bed.
Of course, this was the time fate chose to give her a panic attack. Ruby was sure that the sight of the Ferris wheel, combined with the presence of two large men dressed in a black soldier outfits was what triggered it to happen.
Suddenly, Ruby was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of an explosion. Her eyes were narrowed as she shielded them from its blinding brightness. Soon, the blast settled and she heard Infinity’s voice again.
Vision said something back to the man but Wanda didn't hear what it was because her attention had been snatched away by the girl who looked exactly like the Captain, and by the overwhelming force was coming from her. Did Steve had a secret family, like Clint? Wanda could see the girl's aura. It was embracing her like a fiery cocoon, an enormous glow of orange, captivating and daunting at the same time.
"Ooooh, Spidey! Can you smell that from the air? It smells like failure." Ruby teased and shared a high five with Natasha who patted Spidey's back in consolation.
"It has begun, Master." Unbeknownst to the two teenagers, a man clad in a long black trench coat was following them from the shadows throughout the day, observing what Ruby has managed to discover from her ability.
Ruby grimaced when she heard Wanda's request. What could she say? It wasn't like she was the most interesting person to know about. Wanda could have asked a normal 10 year old kid and they probably would have had more things to say than her.
After Ruby introduced herself to both of the men, Steve went back sitting on that corner a few metres away from the door, his eyes not leaving whatever Dr Banner was doing with her who was actually going on about how the mitochondria found in eukaryotes use to be independent organisms.
"Didn't she tell you that the bond between a cosmic being and its vessel depend upon the trust you've built with each other? Now that you've openly rejected Infinity, your soul bond had been weakened even more. Poor thing. She was already weak anyway. I could see the thread of your bond barely hanging onto your soul. Now, it just vanished. "
Hydra was keeping someone in captive. More specifically, a girl. Probably not older than 18 the most. This recon task had just turned to a rescue mission whether Fury liked it or not.
Deciding that she would just walk home by herself, Ruby started walking towards the direction of the Tower. As she jogged, Ruby sensed that there were something wrong around her. Everyone was scrambling to the opposite way she was going. Most of them looked panicked while some looked astonished, claiming what they saw was so
Unlike this one who could make everything she has always wanted to come true. Once they've joined, nothing could stop them anymore. They would be the greatest of all the greatest, the god of all gods.
With her forefinger tucked readily against the trigger of a glock 26, she crept forward to the room where she thought she heard noise and pushed the door open. Inside, there were bunk beds covered in what supposed to be white but were now dusty grey plain linen.
Its shine blazed with magnificence and underlying mystery. The closer Ruby went, the louder and higher its hum played. Then the melody all but stopped once she was just a mere foot away from it.
If one inspected more closely, you would notice the slightest hint of bloodstain in some of the beds, blurry and almost pink which resulted from a poor attempt of washing the evidence off. It could have been mistaken for some kind of discoloration.
Nonetheless, Ruby hopped out of her bed and made her way through Peter's bedside. Both the guy's legs were in casts but the doctor have already informed them that Peter's healing factor was kicking in and that his bones would be fully reformed in a matter of hours. But why would Ruby make her friend suffer in bed when she knew herself that she could help him with her abilities?
"It's all good, man. Don't shit yourself over there."
Tony’s hand abruptly stopped from whatever it was he was tinkering with and looked Steve straight in the eyes.
Over time, Peter and Ned became her confidantes. There were no secrets between them so Ruby really felt bad about hiding what she felt about Tony and Steve. The three of them, seated cross-legged at the rooftop, continued to eat with talks of TV serious they could totally binge watch filling the silence. As it was, Peter was still being a baby about inviting MJ over to come hang out with them. When Ruby tried to hassle him about talking to her, Peter dismissed her with a wave of his hand. Apparently, he
She could feel the sharp bite of the cold, prickling her skin like tiny needles, which made the hair at the back of her neck to stand up.
What was even worse is that he knew that having a cosmic entity completely destroy a soul bond without destroying a vessel, would mean that Mordo himself willingly agreed to give up his physical body and consciousness to provide Eternity a powerful, permanent corporeal form.
Ruby didn't have time to talk to the Voice because she could already see Bucky coming towards her with a concerned face.
"I detect radio and microwaves originating underground. Looks like it's blocked by a strong electromagnetic shielding too. Other than that, Nothing else Boss."
"Steve?" Ruby asked in a small voice, still looking up as she mapped the different constellations she could find in the night sky.
She shook her head.
“Sure thing, Princess. And oh, did you take the lunch our metallic friend fixed up for you? It was on the kitchen counter.” Steve and Tony were actually jealous. Bucky didn’t allow them to taste even a tiny piece of those California maki rolls he made.
"That came out wrong, didn't it?"
Then Infinity whispered in the lady’s ear,
“Hold up there, Doctor. What is this about Infinity and Eternity? What are they?” Steve asked, which was reinforced by Tony’s nod as well. They were so tired about going with the flow with Ruby’s situation and they just wanted some real answers now.
Stephen stared at Infinity, who just continued to grin at him with humour, just to look for any hidden dishonesty. Contented to know that the being was telling the truth, he could have left, placed his consciousness back to the reality, and deliver the news to the three superheroes waiting for an update about Ruby’s condition. However, he couldn’t really help but wonder about what he just observed earlier.
With a final warning to hold on tight, Peter ran swiftly towards the edge of the roof top and dived down into the city. He screamed in glee at the rush of adrenaline that he felt which was soon followed by Ruby's own once she got her heart and mind settling down at the notion of free falling from a thousand feet tower.
“Whatever you saw with Ruby and Ned?”
Damn it.
"When do I start?"
Ruby knew that they would be out of her life sooner rather than later and she couldn't go through that all over again. She couldn't handle any more losses at all, and at the kindness that Steve and Tony was showing her, she has no doubt that she would easily get attached.
"If you tell them about the Voice just like you've told me, they will not judge you. If I didn't, then I'm sure as hell that Steve won't. Or Tony. Or Clint. Or anybody else you're worried about. Isn't that right, guys?"
"First you web me then you slap me when I'm sleeping! So not cool. I'm starting to think you have an issue with me."
"Just your protégé being himself." Natasha explained. Steve and Tony didn't even bother to clarify what it meant.
"Hello? Earth to Ruby." Bucky snapped his fingers in front of her. It had been a few minutes since he released her from his embrace and the girl just stared in space. Probably overthinking about things again.
Each intake of her breath was controlled. So far, there doesn't seem to be anyone within this side of the facility but that didn't mean anything. In fact, it made the black widow even more alert. No place could be utterly quiet as a grave.
It had been quite easy for Natasha to clear out the area she was in. As soon as the alarm system roared through the facility, she hacked through their systems to gather any intel she could find. Hydra officers were galloping outside but they were stupid enough not to actually check the inside of the surveillance room.
With a sigh, O’Malley pulled his collar up and clicked his tongue. It was such a shame that his master would rather prolong this than take her. The sooner they get her back, the sooner they could seal
“Ruby’s not home and she isn’t answering her phone.”
The wind outside here was chilling, but she was content enough to have her comforter enveloped around her body like a cocoon, her mug placed on top of the table to her left. She looked at the stars that illuminated the night sky.
"V? Are you there?" Ruby asked out loud. She looked up at the ceiling lamp as she rubbed her calf against her comforter, sighing at its softness. She wondered whether the Voice would tell her what her name was anytime sooner. Ruby thought it was only fair. The Voice seemed to know everything there was to know about her yet Ruby was still completely baffled by just her mere existence.
"Okay, but on one condition." Tony tilted his head to the side in question, urging Steve to voice it out. "One of us drops and fetches Ruby from college. At least just for a couple of weeks."
"Nah bruh, you should. You know Tony and Steve more than I do. They'll listen more to you."
"Hello, Wanda. Vision." Tony greeted.
Tony decided to wait before trying the lock. He wanted to be well underway before taking any chances, especially with how close they’d come to being caught not even an hour ago. It would also get him used to being in there if he were unlucky enough to have his trunk under another. He squirmed around to pull his pillow further away from the air holes so he could get some more fresh air, then carefully peeled open the waxed cheesecloth the sandwich was packed in.
forever. But that would simply had to wait. For now, he had to go back to
* * *
Immediately, the production logos started rolling and they all settled in. But Halfway through the movie, just when the dwarves and company was about to enter Rivendell, Steve's phone rang.
What the heck? All those time, the Voice was with her.
. Steve couldn’t help the thought from popping in his mind but he would have to talk about this with Tony later on.
"Know what?"
"This will be yours Ruby. The penthouse is my designated area. Steve is just one floor below us. Do you wanna see the communal floor?"
Infinity crouched down next to Ruby’s body. She placed her hand in the middle of her chest and for a moment, Ruby’s body arched up, as if the cosmic being was sucking something out of her body.
"Anyway, I'm going to go wake Ruby up now." Steve hurriedly said and walked out of Tony's lab. He'll deal with him later on.
Then it growled.
Steve found Bucky in the shooting range and dragged him up to dinner while Bruce finally pulled himself out his room, claiming that his bones could only handle as much yoga. He told Ruby he could join him sometimes.
"Oops."
Ruby suddenly felt a deep remorse for this. If only she has told them about her history with theme parks, then they wouldn't have to deal with taking her sorry ass back here in the med bay. God, just a day being in their custody and she's caused trouble for them already.
There was a fleeting moment when the thoughts of her mum and dad played in her memory, but she quickly pushed them back at the back of her mind.
But Wanda was right. As much as Ruby wanted to deny it, she was, in fact, scared of her own self. No matter how much she convinced herself, she still knew that she knew nothing about the Voice inside her head. Nor where her powers came from. Or why she has them. Heck, she didn't even know what she was anymore. Yes, she use them but she would be lying if she said that she use her ability without the thought of a negative consequence happening, running at the back of her mind. Ruby gave out a silent laugh. Here she was, creating walls to block and deny her own emotions for months and it only took a few sentences from one woman to knock them all down.
“All of them.” He threatened. “Don’t think I’m joking.”
“Ruby, holy shit. You look so damn badass like this.” Peter exclaimed excitedly before he all but dove and wrapped Ruby in her arms. He tucked his face on the crook of her shoulder, and despite the mask, Ruby could feel his breath against her neck.
"This is training."
From the information he had seen from the file, psychological recovery would be a little rough her.
Suddenly, a portrait of a man with silvery blonde hair smiled down at Ruby in her mind. She blinked and her gaze focused back onto Wanda's eyes. Did she just telepathically sent Ruby an image of her brother?
Steve just smirked.
Oh God, their faces were probably all over the news. Tony and Steve would have definitely seen it. Ruby looked at her watch to check the time. It was 10:15 in the evening and Peter was too knackered from the fight to web sling himself home, let alone carry her.
It didn’t take long for the rest of the Avengers to arrive as well. Bucky came in first. He looked murderous in his black tactical vest with wild alert eyes as he walked in into the communal area. The sudden call for assemble had put his mind in a disarray especially since he was already in a mission, and he rarely receives a distress call in the middle of it as it was normal protocol for stationed Avengers not to be disturbed unless it was an emergency or a matter of national security.
Mordo’s eyes widened in shock when he saw Ruby’s eyes open just as he was going to burn her into ashes.
“Fuck you, motherfucker.”
"You know, normal people use the main entrance when entering the tower." Ruby commented once she has finished sewing the wound up. She quickly gathered the equipment she used and dropped them to the basin. She'll sterilise them later on once she's gotten rid of the blood stain of the carpet and the sofa.
Nobody was prepared though when he pulled out a cleaver underneath the bed and slashed it down Ruby’s stomach. Her scream echoed in the room along with Peter’s worried shouts and Tony’s sharp curses. On the screen, Mordo chuckled as Ruby’s scream was reduced to whimpers of agony.
"But how are you gonna explain why you're already home?" Ruby asked.
"Don't worry yourself over that, Ruby. It's alright." Steve replied with a comforting smile.
satisfied. How in the world could she possibly do that?
Her veins were lined with a fiery incandescence and her eyes were ablaze. Like they were looking at two bottomless pits of raging fire. The girl was just standing on the sidewalk, close enough to see the fight but was still far away to get physically hurt. With a wave of her hand, the truck that the symbiote was holding split in half.
." Ruby winced at the way he said her alias but tried her best to hide it. She didn't know why his tone of voice came across as mocking and it was really making her feel uneasy.
If one listened closely, they would hear the slightest tremor in Tony’s voice so with a firm nod, Stephen took a step forward and began to chant a spell that will probe into her mind. If he could manage to access her memories, perhaps, he could pinpoint the exact moment and detail that caused her lack of physical response. Without even digging in too deep, Stephen instantly perceived something different about Ruby.
"Look Steve, okay, the girl might be enhanced and it might be the reason why Hydra had her. But you know what I think? She's either having an inner conflict about her abilities or just doesn't know what's happening to her." Tony acknowledged his concern. "Don't you think she needs some sort of normalcy from all of this? Or do you want her to be imprisoned in this tower? With the same people who claimed that she could trust, which obviously she doesn't, considering that she felt the need to hide her abilities."
“The tower’s under attack. We already cleared from Level 13 down but the floors above that have too many hostiles for us to handle. No one has come to our private floors yet so that gives us time to formulate a plan. Anything on your mind, Cap?” Natasha asked in between puffs of air as she tried to catch her breath.
After months of having Infinity as her constant companion, she knew deep in her heart that she could trust her. However, she wanted some answers. She wanted to understand what Infinity and Eternity's feud was all about. All she knew right now is that Eternity is using Mordo for whatever vile reason it was. As young as she maybe, she wanted to help Infinity no matter how small it could be. If it meant using her body as a vessel and honing her abilities, then she would do it. But first, she needs to hear Infinity's story.
"Thank you." Ruby said softly as she accepted the socks from its claws. It was only when she put them on did the robot happily wheeled away from her and started sweeping the floor.
What if something went wrong with them?
"That's right. Could you tell us what your name is?" He asked, as gentle as possible so that it didn't feel like he was interrogating her. He saw her mouth open then close for a second.
"Uh... I'm Ruby? I'm a Tolkien fan too." Ruby said as she nodded towards the hoodie he was wearing. The guy just looked at her, unimpressed.
"Go kick some ass."
Never would she ever take for granted the value of finer things in life.
“Hey, Princess. We’re glad that you’re alive and all but there are literally hundreds of demons here.” Tony gestured to the battlefield.
Who was going to take care of her now?
"We are so screwed."
"I see you've met Natasha and Clint." Steve commented and Ruby couldn't help to snort. "Yeah, they're quite a pair."
Peter was just about to make a turn on the left when his senses blared in alarm. The hair at the back of his neck stood in apparent danger. Karen, his AI, informed him that there was a hostage situation happening at a nearby bank just five minutes away from them.
“See you around, Ruby.” Eternity jumped in and the portal closed.
Swallowing the chicken in her mouth and clearing her throat, Ruby straightened her posture in attempt of showing that she was still very much stable before answering his question.
“Yes, and I remember strict orders about not letting both of you lay a finger on them.”
Ruby couldn't stop the tears that ran down her cheeks.
"Please don't kill me." She pleaded with faux innocence, deliberately making her eyes pop out, to which Bucky just snorted as he flicked Ruby's forehead. Hard.
"You're more hurt than me, you oaf." Ruby argued, noticing that Peter's healing ability was working more slowly than usual. "I need to call the Avengers."
"Sorry about Peter. He's so forgetful, sometimes he remembers stuff he needs to do at the most inconvenient time and just leaves." Ned explained once he swallowed his food.
"No one will fight you fair out there, sweetheart." Steve lectured, still with that stupid grin on his face. Frustrated that she felt so helpless against Steve despite all the combat and skill training she had with Wanda and Natasha, Ruby figured she used her powers. She's more in control now, so no harm done, right? Plus, Steve had his super strength. She doubted that he was holding back on her.
About 2 minutes later, the medical team arrived. Tony and Steve loaded Ruby on the stretcher and the staff hurriedly assessed her condition even before they had the chance to close the door. Ruby's left temple was bleeding which was immediately disinfected and dressed with gauze. Apart from that, Ruby appeared to be fine.
Vision smiled at the thought.
"So you're a Peter, huh? I would have thought you're more like a Tom, or maybe Andrew." Spidey, or shall Ruby say, Peter, looked at her like she's grown two heads and then stared at Tony accusingly but softened his gaze a minute later.
Having enough experience in combat, Steve was able to predict Ruby's move and was able to block it with his forearm. He took the chance to grab her leg and twist it, rendering Ruby out of balance and making her fall to the ground. Again.
“Then I found you.”
Steve found her unconscious in the vault room. Her hands were shackled with thick heavy chains that it made it impossible for her to move without bruising her wrists. There was nothing but the dark and cold to accompany her in that prison.
"Chicken sandwich sounds good to you?"
The Voice murmured after pondering underneath her thoughts.
“Good morning. I, uh, just wanted to say goodbye before I go to Uni.” She shyly stated. “Also...  could I please come home late? Because, uh,  Ned and Peter wanted to go to the cinema tonight. I promise I won’t be no later than 10pm.”  Ruby wasn’t looking at either men while she spoke. Yesterday, she accidentally sent Steve flying across the gym room while they were sparring. She was still feeling a bit guilty even though she knew that his healing factor took care of the bruises and they were literally gone within an hour.
Ruby found Natasha's voice quite familiar. Perhaps, she was there as well when the Avengers rescued her. She wondered if these two are part of the Avengers too.
Mordo chuckled in glee. “Actually, it’s more fun if I don’t give you a choice.”
"Ugh. Didn't we establish earlier this afternoon that we're ditching?" Ruby reminded him.
"I'm not the only one seeing this, right?" Tony asked the team. He was right. Ever since that incident from the theme park in Brooklyn, he has suspected that Ruby had some sort of ability. Why she decided to keep it hidden from them, Tony didn't know. His heart, although he wouldn't really admit it, clenched at the thought that the girl was probably still wary of them. Trust was a hard thing to gain, after all.
The Voice reminded her.
Entranced, Ruby reached out a hand.
"Why are you so quiet?" Ruby asked again.
Ruby sighed and scratched her head in frustration.
Ruby asked, surprised and awed at the same time.
She didn't notice that it was already half past nine until the dim lights startled her when they automatically lit up. Yawning, she stretched her arms and proceeded to place the book back to its shelf.  She just turned the lights off and was in the middle of getting another book to keep in her bedroom when she heard a loud thump and what sounded like a hurt grunt coming from the balcony.
Of what? When he was fucking me? Because I can tell you about that if you want to hear. The wall was fucking cold, you know, but the water was scalding.” He laughs derisively, and Bucky winces at the harshness of it, the self-deprecation embedded within.
Bucky raises his eyebrows at the other man. “Well, sure, but jackin’ off, can’t you go a couple of times?”
“Yeah, of course, although you’ve already been there…” Tony trails off and decides not to look a gift horse in the mouth. He shuts up and leads the way to his workshop, ignoring the stunned faces around him.
“What did you want to apologize for?” Steve asks, breaking the silence with his curiosity. They come out muffled from behind the napkin he’s using to wipe his mouth with, but his words are still quite clear.
Thor glares at the little cloth tag in distaste, before sighing and reaching for the bright orange animal itself, pulling it from between the cushions of the couch he’d been working on. He stubbornly ties the offending name tag around one foot and holds it up for Marire’s speculation.
“Tony,” Steve says, and he smiles a little. “You don’t have to explain to me how easy it is to fall for Bucky Barnes.” His grin slips a little, and he clears his throat. “You’re right, however, that I can’t just sweep everything I did under the rug because I had a mental illness. So, I would like it to be said: I’m sorry. I’m not going to fucking say it again and I know you won’t either, but I am. I really am. I shouldn’t have left you pregnant. Even though I was feeling betrayed, I should have at least stayed for her, because you’re right. She is precious, and very much worth living for.
organized. It looks more like a guest’s room than the owner’s. There is no personalization anywhere, and at the present moment, Tony can’t find it within him to speculate about what this means about their current resident super soldier’s state of mind.
Tony does his best to kiss back, but mostly his head is just tilted against the wall, powerless under the unrelenting ravishing of his mouth. One huge hand comes away from the wall to grasp Tony’s jaw, forcing it upwards and changing the angle of the kiss, and Tony moans.
He wants to pull away, wants to go hide in a corner, but can’t quite make himself escape the warmth that is Bucky.
Sadly, sleeping with a concussion is probably not a good idea, especially if it’s so severe that a man with the healing factor of Steve’s still has dilated pupils and can’t walk properly.
“Bucky, I’m sorry!” Steve pants, regret clear in his eyes. “I’m sorry!”
Bucky, in spite of himself, smiles. Then he bites the inside of his cheek nervously, trying to think how to phrase his next question. There are butterflies in his stomach, actual butterflies, and the last time he remembers being this nervous is… actually, scratch that. He can’t remember.
Tony blinks once, twice. “You seem different,” he says at last. “Where’s the gun?”
“In case you decide to shoot me, asshole.”
Tony nods happily and leans back against the couch. “Twenty-five weeks along,” he says, happy the conversation has changed subjects. He’s done talking about Steve, thank you very much.
“Tony,” Bucky says more urgently, and Tony finally looks up.
Tony nods solemnly. “I guess we’ll just have to see.”
He doesn’t, of course, because Steve needs his rest.
,” he begs.
“Tony?” he asks again, confusion clouding bright blue eyes.
“I’m not sure what there is to say,” he admits. “I owe you a thousand and one apologies, Steve, and Tony… I don’t know where to start.”
that was going to have a life he would
damnit. Tony is so
“Focus, you two,” Steve barks, and Tony lets a grin stretch fully across his face this time.
“It’s not actually that bad, you know. You’re just insatiable.”
“Not important,” he says, waving a hand, but Bucky’s firm on this.
The familiar crackling of the comm starting in his ear is comforting, as much as Tony is loath to admit it.
"No need. I called them before you came. I was stalling Carnage, waiting for them."
The only thing that would be limitless at the end of the day would be how many times the Avengers would think she's gone mentally deranged if she tells them any of this.
"Sure! I'd be glad to." Ruby actually just had one lecture and she was done for the day so it wouldn't hurt to hang out with them. Plus, she thought that it would be cool to start getting to know them as well. They seem like they would be good friends.
What is a cosmic energy? And what the hell did her soul got to do with it?
"Hey, kid." Mr Stark greeted her while walking towards her.
Stephen explained the best he could. Clearly, he could see that both men were disturbed by this fact. Steve wondered about how this feud was affecting not only Ruby but a whole lot of civilians too, whereas Tony took offence at the fact that Infinity was using Ruby’s body.
This time, Ruby's eyes slowly pried open and she barely managed to contain her surprise. "What the hell do you want from me, Mr O'malley?" She slurred, as she struggled against the ropes restraining her hands and feet against a chair.
Ruby’s stomach twisted in knots. What kind of sadistic question was that?
"You go in first."
And obviously, she was married to Steve freaking Rogers because said man came out of a door that looked like his office when Ruby called for him. Both female stark and Rogers number 2 had a ring on their finger.
To be honest, they were just waiting on how their co-leaders would approach the subject.
Up in Tony's penthouse, Steve swung Ruby's door open only to find the two teenagers nowhere to be seen.
Bucky can’t breathe, and Steve probably can’t either, but dammit, oxygen is overrated anyway. They gasp into each other’s mouths until Steve suddenly rolls his hips, nearly bucking James off with the force of the motion. Bucky just moans and grinds down even further before leaning down to continue making out with Steve.
He gasps into the shirt and slowly, bit by bit, sucks in deep breaths and calms himself down. The other hand slowly rubs his back, and when Tony pulls away to look at him, the comforting weight of the hand doesn’t leave, like it didn’t in the alley.
Bucky’s heart sinks and he turns the page, hoping for something different on the next one, maybe a harmless drawing that would not point to
“You two sorted your shit out, then?”
He remembers all those double dates Bucky used to drag him on, the two pretty girls he’d try to set him and Steve up with, but who’d only end up hanging off Bucky’s arm by the end of the night. Steve was too sickly to do more than talk anyway, so it wasn’t like he didn’t understand why they were so attracted to Bucky. Plus, Bucky acted like he owned the world at fifteen, because he was young and handsome and had a crooked smile that made girls weak at the knees.
“You want to explain yourself?” Rhodey asks, and there’s barely controlled anger behind his words, anger that is kept in check only by the respect he has for Tony.
” he had rasped, begging himself silently to understand what Bucky was trying to tell him.
You just stood there, expected me to remember things you fucking know I couldn’t, Rogers,” he spits, and Steve flinches at the use of his last name.
, he sounds disappointed.
“Yes, but maybe don’t give him anything. He doesn’t seem to appreciate it very much.”
“Yeah, no.” Bucky laughs nervously. “I found out from Steve.”
“Did you fall in?” Tony asks, his tone amused, from the doorway.
He also thinks it’s another gap in his memory, something else he should know about but just can’t remember, and after the whole thing in the shower, he decides to not pursue that train of thought and chooses instead to follow Steve silently, obediently.
Bucky goes and sits on the couch, grateful that his boyfriend is letting him off the hook. Tony’ll probably want to talk about it later, but sitting down makes him realize how exhausted he was, and he falls asleep almost immediately.
There’s a Stevie-shaped lump under the bed covers, and Bucky can see blond hair poking out of the top.
It’s empty, because Steve was too narrow minded to begin even a friendship, one he had desperately needed.
“Fair enough,” Bucky says, and goes around the bike to hug Tony as tightly as he can from behind, because the baby bump is comfortable for exactly no one.
From the end of a long tunnel, he hears that the test is positive. He finds himself nodding, and lets the doctor direct him through new tests, this time to make sure he and his baby are healthy.
“Why?” Steve asks dully, but he leans forwards obediently and sniffs the hot tea, some of the steam wafting from the cup scattering when he breathes out harshly afterwards.
“Couldn’t take what?” Tony asks gently, understanding that while the information has to be out there, he has to be careful about how he gets it, lest he spook Steve and send him into a panic attack or something.
He remembers all those nights he and Bucky would sleep over in each other’s rooms while their mothers and Bucky’s sister would talk and play cards in the empty apartment. When they were younger it was an excuse to talk about Eloise’s skirt being above her
“Woah,” Bucky breathes.
The answering silence is enough.
“I’d like to take credit for that glow,” he drawls, and Bucky smirks, “but I’m guessing you got the first time out of your systems?”
He does need fresh air.
“I know–” Steve tries to say, but Bucky interrupts him.
“Thor’s not like that. If he says a cat’s a flerken and a red panda fairy’s named Napoleon, then that’s what they are.”
“Oh. Can you track it?”
I’m just going to cut straight to the chase:
Clint had asked him, somewhat shyly, if he’d like to run a training simulation with him and Bucky, heart leaping at the request, had said yes, excited for an opportunity to connect with someone on the team that wasn’t his best friend or his boyfriend. Also, Clint seemed like the best option. Becoming friends with a scary russian spy who gave him the jeepers and was entirely too dangerous for his liking and a man with the potential to become a giant green rage monster was simply a little too much for him.
Gasps and shudders are torn out of Tony as Steve works the hand between his legs, and soon they turn into breathless curses spilling from his lips as he gets closer to the edge. Steve releases him then, dragging a heady whine from Tony as he does so, and grips his thighs, lifting him up and shoving him against the wall. Tony gasps at that, because
Bucky sags a little, releasing a ton of tension he didn’t know he had. He picks up his mug, the teabag is done steeping. He delicately takes it out and puts it on the little plate where Steve’s already is, grabbing a spoon and stirring the steaming liquid.
“You don’t see it, do you?” Steve asks helplessly. Everything he’s been bottling up for the last two months is starting to boil up again, and Steve struggles to keep a lid on it.
“If you’re sure,”
The first week since finding out is hell. Ordinarily, when something like this would happen he would drink himself to the point of unconsciousness, uncaring about the hangover he would likely have the next morning. This time, however, he can do no such thing without risking the health and safety of his baby.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. God, you’re gonna love this. I added a tiny gun, okay, and I put your star because I couldn’t remember if you asked or not but it’s there now and it looks
“Not those, then,” Tony says gently, soothingly. “Alright, then, if that’s a yes, can you sit back down for me? This should only take twenty minutes or so.”
Bucky carefully raises one eyebrow, his eyes all heat and fire. “I’m ambidextrous, Stark. Have to be,” he says, and oh, is that a mental picture. Tony goes slightly cross-eyed trying to imagine it and see the scene in his head.
Almost on cue, Tony breaks his silence. “It won’t take long,” he says. “Give me a few weeks to make your arm, and then we can talk about how to attach it so the whole strain-on-the-shoulder thing doesn’t happen again.” He suddenly grins maniacally. “Then we can start making it look sick.”
“I don’t like motorcycles nowadays,” Tony admits. “They’re too big, and I figured you’d be a little more comfortable with this.”
There’s silence, then Steve rears back and punches him in the face, screaming “
Rhodey chuckles and wraps his arms around Tony tighter. “I missed you too.”
. But sometimes… sometimes he wonders.
and fell for him so easily...”
Bucky rolls the words over in his mouth before he spits them out. “We were pretty close,” he finally says. What he actually meant to say was “I was in love with you”, but luckily, he managed to squash it before it came out.
Bucky shakes his head and smiles. “I haven’t gotten laid in seventy years, Stark, speak for yourself.”
Tony does want one. He shares a mutual love of buttery pastries with Clint, and it’s with a warm kind of happiness that he accepts it and flips his faceplate down.
“Not your–” Bucky sputters, “you’re the one who’s fucking pregnant! If it should be anyone’s information, it’s yours!”
He has no fucking idea what to do with the pile of ripped page, but after some deliberation just decides to sweep the lot into the drawer in his bedside table to deal with another day when he’s not drowning in his own thoughts.
Tony gets up, everything numb. “I’ll be right back,” he rasps.
The journey from the car to the inside of Stark Tower is one that Bucky makes, but just barely, and only because Clint’s holding his elbow on one side, Natasha the other. He makes it inside, however, and slumps inside the elevator once they enter.
It’s not until Bucky gently puts a hand on Tony’s bicep that Tony realizes he’s trembling. “Jesus, Stark,” he rasps, and there’s a note of controlled anger in his voice.
“But… you like girls,” Steve had said helplessly, leaning back in his chair.
“Captain,” Rhodey seethes.
He pours every last bottle down the drain, watching as it swirls and sloshes, the amber and clear liquids disappearing. He clenches his jaw and forces himself to watch, hating that it’s affecting him this way.
He wants to look away, he knows he should, but he
too short (this is getting ridiculous, really, he should just go out naked and see how people react then), he goes to the bathroom to take a piss and brush his teeth, before taking a swig of water from the tap in his cupped palm and leaving the room.
“You looked like you needed a break there,” Bucky says quietly, his eyes are full of light in comparison to the rest of his face, steely blues that pierce Tony’s, but not in a bad way. More like he’s trying to figure him out, like he’s curious. It’s not unlike the look Steve gave him before kissing him.
“He is.”
would know how to call someone on that blasted device.
But Tony doesn’t hear Bucky. His eyes locked onto Steve’s, which have darkened considerably with emotion, maybe… sadness? Frustration? Fear?
Tony’s fingers worked feverishly across the keyboard, flying across the keys as fast as he could possibly make them go. Steve, behind him, is wearing a groove into the floor of the workshop, running fingers through his hair and breathing harshly.
Thor’s next, and he seems quite excited by the prospect despite Tony and Clint’s reservations. Like the man before him, he strips outside of the door, his muscles rippling and flexing as he steps into the chamber. He comes out ten minutes later in a rush of steam, skin pink from all the scrubbing to ensure he was clean as a jellybean.
“I cannot determine your own emotions, sir,” JARVIS reminds him.
were Tony’s words.
I NEED YOUR HELP: we're all aware that Thor got Tony seven stuffed animals, and with the exception of the purple stuffed platypus, we don't know the other six. I have ideas, but if yall want to recommend some cute animal that could be one of the stuffed animals in the comments, I might add yours in! Feel free to name it, and I'll give credit in the next chapter :)
“Is there anything I can do to help?” he asks finally. Tony freezes, as if that was the last thing he was expecting out of Bucky’s mouth.
Steve snorts. “I wouldn’t know,” he says, and Bucky frowns.
But he thought he could take it. He did. He distanced himself from everyone else, went to the gym to work out his frustrations, locked the drawer with his sketchbooks firmly, and tried his damndest to sleep.
“Yes, please,” he grunts and Tony swats his hand away from his fly and opens it himself, pulling out Bucky’s cock and giving it a few strokes. He stands up with a grunt and directs Bucky with gentle pressure on his hips until he’s leaning against the table’s edge, his hands braced behind him.
Tony gasps, swears a blue streak, and finishes, his eyes shutting tightly as his back arches and he empties his load into Bucky’s sweet sweet mouth, shuddering in pleasure as Bucky just keeps sucking him off through it.
Not even Clint complains about the plain sandwiches they have for lunch. Tony’s morning sickness is mostly over, but the horror of it is still fresh in their minds.
She nods and disappears, presumably to take off her clothes in the shower. It’s probably for the best, Tony thinks. She reappears wrapped in a towel barely five minutes later, hair wrapped neatly in another twisty square of cloth. She accepts the clothes from Bruce, who’d given her a hoodie and sweatpants instead of just a thin shirt to preserve her modesty better, and goes to the small bathroom to change.
There’s one with the two of them standing in front of a lamppost for seemingly no reason at all, Rhodey’s arm thrown over Tony’s smaller figure, that’s being absolutely
“What was that, Iron Man?” Steve barks.
He thinks the sadness he feels for both of them is the strongest emotion he’s felt yet.
With that, he sweeps out of the workshop, off to find his best friend.
The point at which their hands were in contact began to glow that reminds Ruby of a star. Both women gave each other a small smile as they felt their soul bond reform and rekindle. But it wasn’t the same one, no. This one was new and stronger.
Their conversation was cut short when the doctor examining Ruby walked out of the room, "You can go see her now." Both men thanked the man and wasted no time before entering the room.
“Only if I want to give you a heart attack.” Ruby felt Peter smile and she raised her arms to embrace him back tightly. Unfortunately, the moment had to be cut short because Tony came flying in his Iron Man suit along with Captain America in his mission mode face. Tony procured a make shift nano-shelter from his suit for temporary regroup.
What the hell.
Ruby's eyes snapped to Bucky who was already sitting up and testing his mobility around his wound. The torn flesh was slowly healing itself up and the pain just felt like a dull throb now.
"Ow."
She convinced herself before going back to the med bay.
"But you aren't getting off your punishments." Tony reprimanded. "You're still restricted in the lab, and you Princess, are still going to do some training." Ruby thought that wasn't too bad. At least Tony and Steve didn't seem too mad at them anymore.
Tony gave out a small laugh at her antics. Poor man.
With a blink of an eye, Stephen found himself in front of Steve and Tony in an unfamiliar living room of what seemed to be a family house.
“Ruby’s missing and we got no leads at all except for a CCTV camera feed.”
"Excellent!" He clapped his hands once before pushing his chair back and standing up.
she was supposed to learn how to control would all be according to her terms. The Voice, on the other hand, only had one thing to ask of her: that she trust the Voice, and therefore, follow her guidance because, Ruby quotes,
He noticed that her soul does not belong to this dimensional reality.
"Easy, Nat. It's just me." Natasha lowered her weapon once she realised that she was about to cut Cap.
"Natasha."
He couldn’t stop having a nervous breakdown knowing the fact that the girl he liked was missing due to his own incompetence.
Ruby was pretty sure she felt her ankle crack in a sudden attempt of supporting her weight but her scream of pain was muffled when her face hit the mattress she fell into.
Steve's statement had the boy looking up with disappointment and dejection. "But my new suit adjustments…" He tried to say that he had to work on those but he stopped himself, knowing that it would be futile to bargain with the Captain.
She was so pale even snow white would be ashamed. Her cheekbones were sticking out which emphasised how sunken her eyes even more.
"Could you pass me that pan, please?" Ruby asked and took the pan from the man with her free hand. After carefully setting the tarantula on the floor, Ruby immediately slammed the pan onto the spider to prevent it from crawling away.
Natasha didn’t shed a tear though. Because tears are useless and won’t do anything good to help the situation. Instead, she dragged her arms across Clint’s back and pulled him closer for a moment before she looked back at her family with a blank expression. Now was not the time to be emotional. They had someone precious to save.
"Please, call me Luke. We're all friends here."
Infinity was amazed at how sharp Stephen was. The entity did all she could do to mask her soul with spells. Not because she knew what she did was wrong, but because she knew that knowing about what she had done could cause anguish to some of the people involved. And yet, the sorcerer managed to see through her spells.
He let out a fake cough to let the lovebirds know that they could have their moment after they rescue the two dumbasses who were supposed to be in school. Sure enough, he received a glare from Steve who knew him inside and out including his antics. Tony, on the other hand, didn't take the cough for anything else but as it is. Instead, he just headed out to go save the day. Naturally, the rest of the team followed.
So imagine her surprise when Mr Stark told her that they were taking her
With its constant harmonious humming as her guide, Ruby wove through the maze of rocks. The atmosphere was so thin that she needed to force her rib cage outwards just to get enough air through her lungs.
"Which one has the best design?" Natasha asked and Clint looked at each one as if it was a life or death situation and one wrong decision could result to hell all over. With one final look, Clint reached for the cupcake with a tree and leaf design.
Ruby resisted the urge to smack her friend, mainly because he had enough broken bones to compensate for that comment. "That fact is all hush hush. Only you know about it." Peter smiled at the thought of being the first one to ever discover, but then frowned when he reached for Ruby's shoulder, his fingers feeling warm blood oozing out of her skin.
"That's for me to know and for you not to find out." He winked and then proceeded to open up all the cupboards he could place his hands on to find whatever ingredients he could have in this kitchen.
A small whirring noise made her look to the side and was surprised to see a robot, almost as tall as she was in her sitting position, holding out a pair of... socks?
To defeat Eternity.
"Can I show you something?" Wanda asked when she noticed Ruby falling into some kind of trance.
Clint, who was very much afraid of spiders as well, was already pointing a frying pan towards the girl he wasn't yet introduced. He thought that it was probably rude, but she's holding out a spider!
This wouldn't do at all.
So with the intent of apologising to Steve and Tony for her behaviour for the previous days, she forced herself up from her bed to grab a yellow orange hoodie from the humungous set of clothes that Tony had delivered in her room. Once she put her hair in a messy bun, she jogged down the stairs toward the elevator.
Hold on, he has a metal arm?
Ruby slowly shut her eyes just as the Voice had instructed, her heart was full of reluctance in doing so yet it possessed an inclined obedience. As soon as she was swallowed in darkness, everything that her senses could pick up had been amplified two times over.
She found herself lying on the ground a few metres away from the symbiote she was fighting. Just like the Voice told her a minute ago, she was able to render it unconscious. Its slimy tendril-like limbs were slowly dissolving, revealing the man she saw in her vision. Horrified at the thought that she just killed someone, Ruby's heart started to palpitate and she began to breathe heavily, her hands clawing at her chest, desperate to get enough air in her lungs.
"Oh my God!" A waitress squealed as she ran out of the coffee shop and headed towards Ruby. "That was Spider Man, Right? Right? He was so hot! Did he save you? Did you get to ride in his arms like a damsel in distress? Was it good? I bet it was! You're so lucky! What's your name anyway?"
they did to her parents.
Kid, come on breathe." She heard someone say.
It was actually quite surprising to see now that she was holding out a tarantula by one of its legs and taunting poor Peter that she would not hesitate to fling it to him.
Ruby sighed. At least it seemed that she was alone for now.
All their heads snapped up in attention when Natasha and Clint came in, armed and rushed. Natasha was clutching a glock 26 in her hands and Clint had an arrow ready to set loose any time. When they both saw that the communal floor had no one but the Avengers, they lowered their weapons down. Low enough to hold a conversation but high enough to fire in case a hostile came galloping in.
"Oh hi, I'm Peter Parker." The brunette guy finally said and Ruby couldn't help but feel like his voice was familiar.
"Ground your feet when you punch." Steve advised as he placed a new bag for her. "It keeps you more balanced."
"You better hurry up, boys. You gotta see something quick. It's not pretty." Tony heard Natasha mutter through the earpiece. With his back turned away from where Cap was, Tony threw his mini missiles, the impact of the boom resonating through the hallways.
"Hi?"
Just like that, the moment was broken.
Ruby slowly turned her head towards Bucky and gave him an overdramatic smile. When she noticed that her charm did not work against him and he just stared at her deadpanned, she coughed once to clear her throat and swallowed.
The Voice continued.
As long as she kept her shoulders squeezed forward, she would be able to navigate easily with no problems. The inner structure of the building was thin enough that it allowed her to hear the people talking. Without further stalling, Natasha followed where the direction of the voices lead.
"It was my mum first. Knife to the hollow of her throat. But my dad was a fierce thing. Managed to take down quite a few, but as strong as he may be, he was still human. There was no way out of a bullet in his head." Tony and Steve felt a great sympathy for having Ruby witness her parents' death. They couldn't believe that behind those eyes was a tormented past no one at such a young age should have gone through.
What the‒? Is this some kind of a new monster suit invention? Because if it was, she’d like to ask the inventor what the fuck inspired them to create it.
"But I was called Ruby before."
Ruby didn't mean all of that. She just said that in spur of the moment. Ruby have trusted Infinity. And, she still will. If they could just talk to clear everything up.
Ruby ignored the Voice.
"I'm sorry, what was that?" Did Tony just hear the girl tell him to shut up? Even though it was barely a whisper, Steve and everyone else in the room clearly heard what she just said.
Ruby swiftly replaced her frown with a smile, hoping that the two men did not notice it. So what if she goes back to a place similar where all the bad things started? That was over now. A theme park is just a theme park. No need to get paranoid now. Besides, she thought it was a good thing to do, right? Face your fears and all that shit.
Someone tried to shout at her, but it was so faint. So… dull.
Steve quickly made his way to the boy.
She could smell the tangy scent of chamomile and lavender that filled the air.
"I didn't even get to say goodbye."
Out of curiosity, Ruby stared at her hands. She wanted to test whether she could actually duplicate what she saw herself do in her vision. Well, that was what she decided to call whatever she saw a few moments ago. In her vision, she saw herself do basically whatever she wanted.
Suffice to say that she didn't try to train with him again.
"Spidey, you alright?" She asked while slapping his cheek. "Hey, Spidey!"
Everybody turned to Peter and Ruby laughed her ass off, lips turned upwards into a wide smile as she wiped her tears away.
It was as if time has slowed down.
“Rude.”
The facility had some sort of a crucifix layout with other rooms branching out from the main wings but what putting Tony off was that none of the rooms contained evidence that screamed HYDRA. Maybe he was just not observant enough but from a civilian's perspective, this would definitely look like a normal office building.
"You little punk."
“As I’ve said, it’s complicated. I’ll explain properly later so for now, please help me get rid of these demons.”
She could feel herself submitting, soul slowly surrendering and succumbing down to this higher power.
And the feed ended with Ruby’s scream yet again.
Both men didn’t really know what to feel about knowing this and the fact that despite being given a second chance, the cosmic being clearly needed her for something.
"Nope! Nuh, uh." Ruby was cut off by Tony's sharp dismissal and immediately closed her mouth. "You don't get to explain either." He accused. "You should have called us! Not pretending to be a knight in shining armour with a damned steel pipe!" The next few sentences that came out of Tony's mouth were accusations and complaints about children and how they were making him grow grey hair way earlier than he was supposed to.
"Oh, I thought maybe I'd do Applied Mathematics." Ruby answered after a moment of thinking about her future career. Everybody gave her a nod of approval at her choice. "You're fine with attending the Empire State University?" Ruby said yes immediately. To be honest, she didn't really care whatever college Tony sends her to. She wasn't going to be picky.
“Tsk. Tsk. You aren’t healing as quick as I thought. I guess this is what happens when Infinity decides to diminish a soul bond. Shall we test how long you’ll be completely healed if I dive this even deeper?” Mordo applied more pressure onto the cleaver and Ruby’s whimpers yet again turned into a scream as the sharp knife prodded into her already gushing wound.
"Just do what you have to do."
He touched Ruby's shoulder as he went past her, climbing the same obstacle she was at, faster than she could register it. "You're it!" Ruby's mouth gaped open in disbelief as she watched Bucky run ahead of her.
"Oh my God, Bucky." She gasped.
“We will have a discussion about this later on, young man. Capisce?” Tony sternly exclaimed.
Peter pursed his lips in thought. Maybe they could manage to avoid running into them if they convince Friday not to announce their arrival. Peter nodded his approval to Ruby and told her to climb onto his back. She looked at him warily, a bit scared to damage his body even further but Peter reassured her that most of the injuries he acquired from the fight have already healed. Once he turned on the last corner, he sped up his walking and proceeded to climb up the tower.
Could it be possible that they were finding a way for Ruby to control her abilities? And they always make her forget how so she couldn't retaliate back afterwards and that they had full control of when she could use them.
Overwhelmed with joy, she pulled herself up from the grass where she was lying down and frantically hoped that Infinity would call out again. Her prayers were answered when she heard her silky voice softly whispering her name.
She didn't know how long she was unconscious because after having herself hauled inside of what she was sure of was a van, she knew that the damn drug they injected her with had already taken effect. She wasn't able to keep track of where they were heading. Ruby remembered that she tried to pick out the auras of her captors but it seemed like her abilities were nullified as well.
Good heavens. Who knew enhanced speed was going to be one of her ability’s perks too?
As if hearing Bucky utter the word, Ruby's eyes slowly slipped open and began to take in her surroundings. She was quite disoriented at first but once she saw Bucky's face slightly hovering to her left side, everything came back to her. People running. The symbiote. The fight. Peter. Not calling Bucky.
Lying down on one of its roots, was a woman.
“Oh that. We didn’t actually go tonight. All the three of us got detention, which we skipped, and our mood for watching a movie  got ruined so we just stayed at the school rooftop before we all headed home.”
"Gentlemen. Romanoff." Fury nodded his head as acknowledgement.
Steve saw Tony process these thoughts and nodded in agreement. He was glad that they both have the same perspective towards this situation.
“Okay, sweetheart. We trust you.”
In the middle of the field was a formless mist.
"Thank you, that's very nice of you. Sit down." Wanda tapped the space next to her before she took a sip of her coffee. "Tell me something about yourself, Ruby."
"How are you feeling, sweetheart?" He asked, which made Ruby's heart swell from the concern that could be heard from his voice.
So, she closed her eyes with the hope that the softness of the comforter hugged against her body would lull her to sleep, but when the dark filled her vision, she was back there.
She was now floating upright, able to see the skyscrapers of New York from such a wonderful angle. Ruby smiled when he saw Tony approaching. Instinct told her to push herself forward and even with his suit on, Ruby could tell that the man was surprised that she could manoeuvre herself around in the air.
Then everything turned black and the three superheroes found themselves in a grass field, standing underneath an angel oak tree. Tony and Steve couldn’t believe what they just saw. Ruby was actually their counterparts’ daughter in earth 3490 who died and was given another chance at life by Infinity.
Yeah, that was what she thought. So much for having
It was the faint sound of lead scratching against paper and the soft clang of metal that Ruby woke up to. Steve's eyebrows were furrowed in concentration as he drew a stroke in his page whereas Tony was hunched over some kind of bar with a screwdriver in his left hand.
She watched herself as she reached for her reflection, placing her hand flat against the mirror as if trying to find a form of connection with whoever – whatever the Voice was.
The trip down to the cafeteria didn't take too long. Probably because both guys seemed to never run out of things to talk about. Ruby found out that Parker was majoring in electrical engineering and shared the particle mechanics module with her. Ned, bless the guy, offered to lend Ruby his notes for her to catch up since they both major in the same field and literally have identical schedules.
Not even a single slow beat.
"What?"
Bucky has the tendency to ignore his own pain which had been an issue ever since he decided to serve SHIELD under Fury's command as a high profile agent. He wouldn't admit it but Steve and Natasha both knew that Bucky believes that it is the only way to punish himself and repent for the
"He could rip your intestines out while eating a lasagne and do it five times over!" He taunted, making Peter bow down in shame. The use of his full name didn't exactly help to soften the blow either.
"You have money for a cab home?" Ruby asked Peter.
Tony and Steve decided to set aside their questions first and nodded for Ruby to continue as if they knew that she had a plan in her head already.
"Ruby couldn't sleep last night either." Tony raised his eyebrows to urge Steve to continue.
"Ruby, this is Wanda and Vision." He introduced. Ruby smiled at both their guests, despite her initial uneasiness, and held out her hand to give them a handshake. "I'm Ruby." Wanda returned her smile but tilted her head, examining the girl. Ruby didn't seem evil, but Wanda could not help but be wary. She didn't like not understanding things, and the girl right in front of her, was the epitome of inapprehensible.
Now, here she was on a Monday morning, riding on a motorbike with Bucky driving, on the way to College. Tony insisted that they take one of his cars but Steve managed to convince him that taking the bike was completely alright.
Finally, it decided that taking food from a human stranger didn't seem very harmless and hurriedly bit into the apple.
Both men were alert to their bones. Tony was already beckoning for his suit while Steve ran his eyes through the room, assessing for possible threat.
The tears that were threatening to fall finally rolled down Ruby's cheek. But they were not of sadness, or despair. They were of relief. With the way Steve spoke with finality, Ruby felt as if there was a big thorn that was plucked out of her chest, allowing her to breathe freely again.
"And if I said I did, what will you do to Clint's ass?" Ruby teased while wiggling her right eyebrow.
"You aren't with those people. Who are you? And where am I?" She murmured in a croaky voice. Bruce was thankful that she seemed to be in a fine condition considering that she could form normal sentences, despite clearly how sore her throat was.
He should really focus at the task at hand.
“Nothing seems to be wrong with her, Boss.” Friday started.
They were all quiet, waiting for Peter to move, and when he did, everyone was flabbergasted with the fact that Peter's broken bones healed as if he didn't get the injury at all. They vocalised their astonishments, making Ruby blush before all their praises like she had done something so world-changing. She didn't know that the Avengers would have been so understanding of her abilities.
and that she was under foster care. Ruby understood that the Avengers had to keep her real identity out of the public database because of Hydra but it was still unnerving to have another persona thrown at her when she felt like she was just starting to get herself back.
Just like a movie, Ruby saw through her own naked eyes how the cosmic beings’ creations developed into more advanced life form.
"Peter's going to be fine. And we'll take care of Ruby, I promise." Steve whispered in his ear before looking down at his eyes with pure determination. He didn’t know why but every time Steve uses his voice like that, it always left him breathless. Tony nodded and pulled his face plate up just as the Captain released him from his embrace.
The girl was kneeling on the floor now, hands still clutched tightly on top of her chest. Her eyes were wide, instinctively looking for something that could help her. But it was no use. Tony could tell the exact moment when she breathed her last breath.
"Save what for me?" Bucky grumbled; still drowsy from sleep and yawning his way to the open kitchen.
didn't whine on the loss of contact.
"What the hell were those things?" Ruby asked. "There were even two of them."
"Good night." She murmured.
Natasha was in the middle of squeezing the mix into the next batch of the cupcakes when Clint tried to sneak one into his mouth. Without even looking away from her work, Natasha slapped Clint's hand away before twisting it at an angle.
"He was only trying to‒
"My parents and I were queuing for the Ferris wheel. I was eating my cotton candy while my mum and dad were talking about how amazing I did in my science project the other day ago." Ruby's lip curled up in a bitter smile at the thought.
