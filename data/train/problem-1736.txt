BLOCKED!!
1/10/2017 by Kitty Riley
"Sherlock, hey, I'm here, stay with me ok." Quickly John catalogued his condition: pallor, fever, tachypnea, elevated pulse, vomiting. He'd seen this collection of symptoms many times during his emergency medicine rotation and knew it was an overdose, cocaine being the most likely culprit. "Stay with me, I'm calling for help."
"Shit. I don't know what to say."
"Carrying a tune is all I'm good at anymore it seems. I'm.... blocked."
Sherlock blew out a puff of smoke into a perfectly shaped O. "You can't smoke anywhere in L.A. John. I have to take it where I can." He smirked.
"This is exactly why I want to quit!" Sherlock exploded, his voice taking on that needy, desperate quality it did right before he took a nosedive and deigned not to speak to anyone for a day or two. "The label doesn't care what I want. Greg doesn't care what I want, and you certainly don't care what I want! All I am is a product! A commodity to be bought and traded and I've had enough!'
"I will quit then. I mean it. Give it all up."
If it was even possible, John could feel the chill coming off him.
"He's not a brute Sherlock. I would think you know me better than that. He's an intelligent man--quite fascinating really. Ex-military, and a doctor as well. A surgeon."
"Well don't you look like something the cat drug in, dear." She tutted at him, over a sip of her tea. "You and Sherlock were making quite the racket last night. Woke me up from a dead sleep with some rather interesting singing."
another random guy and looking verrrrry friendly?!?
Thankfully he didn't need to think too hard about it as Mrs. Hudson chose that moment to poke her head through the door with a "Woohoo!" and announce that it was time for dinner.
"And so humble too."
Tonight, had found him in a relatively new club on the strip, one whose name he didn't even recall, but it was Moroccan themed and exclusive as hell. Sherlock lounged in a circular cabana on a raised platform in the VIP section; it was full of brightly patterned cushions and partially obscured by gauzy curtains, and he was surrounded by his core group of back up dancers, otherwise known as the only people he could tolerate socially. Sally, Rebecca, Henry, Grayson, and Brett were spread out around him, chatting amicably, and playing with the gold hookah in the middle of the cabana.
Sherlock frowned slightly and blinked, he was still angry with John, but the question confused him. “How long what?” He huffed. Because really if John was going to be vague he could just turn around and walk right out that door.
"Are you in any danger, Sir?"
As soon as John walked through the door, Claire ran over and wrapped her arms around him tightly. She sobbed into his neck and apologised over and over again. John assured her it was okay, but his voice was numb and filled with pain. It was clear he was going to need some time to recover and get over this, but Claire had no doubt in her mind that they would figure it out together. She pulled away from John and smiled tightly, “I’ll leave you two alone... I’ll come collect my stuff tomorrow.” She said quietly.
John glared at him, “He’s a genius. He doesn’t need to plan! If he wanted something to happen, it would have happened already! Just leave him alone.” He growled slightly, letting the emotion ooze out, but only a little bit.
“Sister! There’s always something!” he groaned and then had a moment of sulking before smiling at John. They continued walking for a while, it was already getting dark and Sherlock really didn’t want to walk home, but he was the one that insisted he came along.
John heard a thud and winced. “Babe! Are you alright?” He looked up and saw Sherlock pop his head out of the window and he smiled in relief.
Mycroft appeared in the door and swallowed hard, “Sherlock...” Cautiously, he made his way closer towards Sherlock.
He let out a bark of laughter, like Sherlock could fix any of this. He reached into the back of his trouser and pulled out a gun, “It’s too late.” He said gravely, he knew that one way or another one of the options was going to happen. He had faith in his people and he didn’t need to be around for it to be executed. It would be a shame that he wouldn’t get to see what outcome Sherlock would choose, but then again he knew. There was only one outcome he wanted, he wanted Sherlock to die. If he was still alive, he knew there was a chance Sherlock could trick him into calling off the whole thing. No, he had to go first for his plan to work. He brought the gun up to his temple and then pulled the trigger. Moriarty collapsed to the ground, blood seeping out from his head.
if my mother were to read this right now she would be like 'whitney language!'
Zack opened the door and frowned when he saw John. He tilted his head and was about to say something because honestly John looked like shit, but before he could even get anything out John had cut him off.
“Nope. No. You – nope. I’m coming up there.” John stumbled with his words and then started to walk inside again.
John smirked into the kiss as his hands found a place in Sherlock’s hair. “Tosser.” He whispered, lovingly.
In a way John was like a little kid who has been spoiled their whole life... he always got what he wanted, no matter what that was, and if he didn’t there would be hell to pay. Another thing about John is that he was broken... Blake meant that in the kindest way possible, but really there was no kind way of putting that. John Watson was a broken man because instead of picking people off by a sniper he went into their houses or lured them into an alleyway and tortured them... It wasn’t like John couldn’t pick them off with a gun because he could. John was probably the best shot out there and was even better with a sniper. It was just that he physically enjoyed hearing people scream and watching them bleed. It would have made Blake sick, but he learned to get over it a long time ago. Without thinking he dipped his head down and took John in his mouth. He was completely lost in thought and that’s what made this bearable. You learned to develop a technique when working with John because he made you do a lot of things you didn't want to do... Things went by a lot quicker and smoother when you got lost in thought and just sucked it up.
The door opened and the woman blinked rapidly when her eyes fell on her son, “John…?” She swallowed slightly and wrapped her cardigan tighter around her body.
anyway i'm back bitches and i'm super sick. ughhhhhh someone save me! bah bah bah.
Lily rolled her eyes, “He always was so dramatic at board games. You should see him and Mycroft play operation.” She snickered and Sherlock choked.
The man on the other end blinked and was silent for a moment, before continuing slowly, “what in heavens are you talking about? With all due respect John Watson is currently in our infirmary dying, so I would like to have an answer on the helicopter ASAP, sir!”
hurt you again. I’m a stupid, stupid man. I know I am. I’m selfish and rude and dismissive, but you being away… I can’t handle that. Please… Just give me one more chance to make this right. I swear to god that if I don’t and fuck it up again I’ll let you go and I’ll never contact you again, but please just give me one last chance.” By the end of that he was frantic and practically pleading and, in the end, that’s what got John. He could hear the sincerity in Sherlock’s voice, the regret of all that he had done, the heartbreak. He could do one more chance.
Irene smirked and took it. She slowly brought it up to her lips and kissed his hand before dropping it. “Oh, I can most certainly see that,” she hummed and then gave Sherlock a disapproving look.
make me say it again.” He snapped back, yes, anger was good. Anger was something he could work with. It was better than feeling nothing.
PLEASE KUDOS AND COMMENT!!! mostly just comment because i love reading them XD
John groaned and banged his head down on the desk. “Yes…” he woefully moaned into the hard surface.
jOkE oF tHe ChApTeR:
“No! It really isn’t. Herding cats, Sherlock! They will be there for us and guide us and just accept it! Just- we are almost there! Please… stay with me.” He swallowed and kissed Sherlock's head.
Sherlock screamed and hid under the covers as fast as he could, “WHERE!!!!!”
John’s lips twitched slightly and he swallowed back his emotions. He nodded slowly and grabbed his hand, “Of course I’ll marry you, you git.” He said fondly, “And of course out of all the ways to propose you do it in the back of a cab on a whim.” He chuckled softly.
“Nothing! I just didn’t want to read them out of respect to you, plus the fact that I didn’t really care about you. None of this was about
John smirked and stepped forward, “See the thing is... you people like to be dramatic. You like to stick your nose where it doesn’t belong and you like to mess with other people’s business when really you should have stayed out of it.” He growled.
Sherlock just laid there because he hated talking and he rarely ever talked lately. Only when he really needed to and that was very seldom. Mycroft worried and so did his mother, but he couldn’t help feel this way... Brian worried too, but in his own way… Sherlock thought it was more of a worry to losing Sherlock and not being able to have him, rather than a worry about Sherlock's actual life. He closed his eyes and Brian finally injected the fluid into his arm. It took long enough for him to find it, but Sherlock just assumed that it was because he didn’t want it to burn or something or another. The liquid filled his vein and Sherlock gasped and arched his back. It was like a rush he had never experienced and colour was brought to life – still not what it would look like if John were here, but there was colour instead of gray!
John and Sherlock got all dressed up and ready to go. John smiled at Sherlock and kissed his cheek softly. “You look so handsome,” He smirked.
HAHAHAHA I AM SO FUNNY SOMEONE MARRY ME
"Except for I do...." He swallowed and slowly looked at Mike, but Mike wasn't looking at him.
Sherlock nodded and they kept walking in silence. Occasionally asking a question here or there, but now that they weren’t in the safety of the classroom neither one of them really knew what to say. Soon, they were nearing Sherlock’s house, but Sherlock didn’t stop. “See that house there?” Sherlock pointed.
Anyway its Feb 19, 2018. I wrote this chapter five years ago and am editing it now. so thats nice. hello from the future past me was clearly going through some tough shit.
“WHAT FUCKING BULLET!! IT WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH YOU PILLOCK!” John screamed in pain and whimpered.
Regan stuck out her hand and shook it firmly, “Nice to meet you, John.” She grinned and sipped at her beer.
Sherlock stood in the middle of his living room completely at a loss of words. He was expecting John to fight back more and when he didn’t, when he pulled away and laughed with resignation, Sherlock knew he messed up. He sat back on the couch next to Aidan and put his head in his hands, how had he fucked things up so drastically? He honestly thought John had left him for good, okay… no, he didn’t. But he knew it was coming, he was hoping that by getting a boyfriend John would become incredibly jealous and realize that they needed to work harder to solve the tension surrounding them. But John had just given up… Looking back now he supposed it did make complete sense, Sherlock basically cheated on John. Again. Christ, he was so stupid sometimes.
"Because it's time for school." He smirked and ran a hand down John’s naked back.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but was smiling and together they walked out of the doctor’s office and went home.
Sherlock slowly walked over to where John was laying on the floor and dropped down. He held John close to him and breathed in his scent for a long moment. “Okay… Okay. I’m okay now. How are you?” He asked softly as he kissed the top of John’s head.
She wanted to scream and punch him again, but refrained, “John! That’s because you haven’t gotten to re-know each other. It’s like when you’re just starting a relationship you get to know that person. And when you’ve been in a long term relationship you get to watch them change slowly so you barely even notice... and even if you do you don't care because it was gradual and they are still them. Because people do change, everyone does, but you haven’t spoken to him in three years! You’re basically living with a stranger! The Sherlock you knew is dead, he’s gone. And the John he knew is also gone. You guys are trying to pick up where you left off and it won’t ever work. Maybe it would have worked if you guys constantly wrote to each other for those four and a half years, but you didn’t. So now you have to start all over.” She huffed.
John's face softened, “No, you aren’t alright. It’s not about how far he got… It’s about the fact that he touched you inappropriately without consent… I can't exactly move, but I want you to come here.” He whispered softly.
Sherlock choked on a sob and tried to stop the tears, but they kept pouring out of his eyes, “Good...” He whispered. “You don’t have to be sad about this, John... I’m ready... Just – remember that you were loved by me and that you made my life a happy one. And there’s no tragedy in that.”
Don't be silly-
Mycroft cleared his throat and looked down at John, “Can I help you?”
DEUCES BITCHES!
John stared at Sherlock and just blinked for a good thirty seconds. His boyfriend?? What the fuck. Clearly he hadn’t heard Sherlock correctly. He jutted his jaw forward and tilted his head a bit, “I’m sorry?” He said in a clipped tone.
Mycroft frowned, “Not even going to deduce them? Pitiful.” He sighed and stepped forward, “Well, the one I thought wouldn’t happen is I would come up here and you wouldn’t have cared what you had just done. In that case I would have shot you and we would have moved on with our lives. However, you
Broken pencil.
“Yes, of course,“ he took a breath and nodded, “Now, I have to go. It isn’t safe to speak for long periods of time.”
John's brain was just spinning because Sherlock was standing right in front of him, in the flesh! It was ridiculous yet brilliant at the same time.
John blinked rapidly, this had to be a trap… Mycroft was the one who got him into this mess. “He’s the one who tipped you, and now he’s letting me go?” He raised an eyebrow slightly.
He realised now that he wasn’t the only one who suffered and he had no idea why he didn’t realise that until now... He supposed he was just being selfish, or maybe he supposed it had been easier for Sherlock because he knew the outcome of John, but that wasn’t right. If John had gotten news that Sherlock had died he would have acted the same way, perhaps not knowing was better… Perhaps, John was the one who got off easily.
Claire ran to her phone and dialled the number she had memorised that night she had ran into Sherlock outside of the pub, keeping it in her phone – even under an alias – was too risky. Tears streamed down her face and she tried to control herself, but when Sherlock answered on the fourth ring she lost all control of staying calm.
Sherlock nodded slowly. “Yes, you gave me something so amazing words can’t describe what it meant to me… so now I’m giving you this. I want to give you this… John, I need you.”
Mycroft sighed loudly, “Fine, but do not make this a regular occurrence, baby brother.”
“But it wasn’t his fault! He was just a baby! And last time I checked it wasn’t her fault for breaking the fucking rubber! That just happens sometimes!” He snapped.
After the funeral Sherlock kept getting texts. At first they were just empty threats, but then they started to get more in depth and that honestly terrified him.
OH HEY IT'S ME AGAIN!
After what felt like hours, but was probably only forty-five seconds, he reached the shore and pulled them both out of the water. He made sure John was lying flat on his back and got to work immediately. He removed the bag from John’s head and checked his vitals for life. John wasn’t breathing...
also also i tend not to read the informational bit... i doubt any of you read my notes anyway, but hey!! i enjoy writing them! And holy fuck my laptop was unplugged for who knows how long and i had no idea! I could have lost everything....
Answer:
Punchline:
Okay. First things first im a realist. nahhhhh im just playing. However let me please explain to you what a john is... a john is a Bill. Now you're probably thinking to yourself... "Dafuq whitney... a Bill makes less sense than a john...."
John scoffed and laughed in Sherlock's face as he stepped closer to it. "Oh, so now you care? What happened to all those nights when I was drunk and wanted you with me? All those nights where you told me that I didn't matter. That Sherlock killed himself because he didn't know how to tell me that he didn't want to be with me anymore? What about all those nights where I
John rolled his eyes and went back to what he was doing previously. Brian and John were the captains of the rugby team, but sometimes John just wanted to punch him. Brian was tall – very tall, lean, extremely fit, and had short, blond hair on top of his head. Brian was considered attractive by many of the girls at their school, but John was a guy so he couldn’t know something like that.
Garrett followed him.
“I- I would have nothing left, but John... I don’t- he’s gone... I think... I don’t think he will hurt you! He’s all talk!!” Sherlock said firmly, pointedly ignoring the first part.
John meant to drive home... he really did, but he ended up in front of a tall building that had probably been there since the dinosaurs. John paused for a split second before slowly getting out of the car and knocking on the door.
Also I highly suggest that you read my notes because I'm a fucking funny person! ha ha. That was a joke! I laugh! But for seriousness I don't do informational shit... I just type whats on my mind...
“Why none other than our head captain!!” Brian sung happily.
What did the ocean say to the shore?
DEUCES BITCHES
Brian was wearing a light pink button down shirt, with a white skinny tie. He had skinny white trousers on that were rolled up a bit and he had tan vans on his feet. His hair was spiked up in the front in a bit of a fauxhawk, Sherlock thought he looked gorgeous… all considering. One breath, and then two, Sherlock slowly brought his hand up to grab Brian's tie, tugging him slightly. He watched as Brian frowned a bit, but Sherlock just kept tugging on it until Brian finally moved and then guided him up the stairs to his room. His room was a right mess, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to stomach going in John’s room. Not John's – never John's...
“YOU’RE BEING MEAN! AND NOW IT’S GONE AND YOU WONT DO THE SAME AND I– oh...” He blinked and groaned as he felt John’s mouth around his prick. He sniffled and opened his eyes to look at John, “You lied. Meanie.”
Mycroft’s eyes widened. “John… Did you have a drink with your flowers and grass?”
“You don’t know shit!” He screamed and kicked him again.  “Let’s just say I owed myself a personal favour.” He growled. He turned towards Mike and then stormed out of the room. He was pissed and he just wanted to go back home to Sherlock.
Sherlock immediately pressed into the hug and nuzzled his face into John’s chest, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, I’m sorry I put you through so much hell after you came back. I’m sorry for everything. I love you so much. Please don’t leave me. I can live with a lot of things, John, but I can’t live with that. Please stay.
“I know, but I just love it so much! Now! I already made a reservation three nights ago. I have been planning this and…” He paused for a slight moment as he looked at his watch, “we have to go now actually.” He smiled sheepishly.
what do you care? You don't you're just here for the story.
“Because what you said was true… it also happened to be extraordinary, completely and utterly extraordinary…” John was a bit breathless to be honest, but the fact that Sherlock could even do something like that amazed him. Why the hell did he sit in silence for so long while his friends bullied him?
Husband: "How would you describe me?"
“John!” He snapped, “You have to!” He said firmly, and if there was a bit of franticness in his voice, neither one of them pointed it out.
In case any of you were wondering the flavour that I picked at random it was Apple.
So innocent I (R)sked a thousand questions
Sherlock smiled and kissed his forehead, “Always.”
Mycroft sighed, “you should just be lucky I didn’t do what I originally planned to do. Pretty sure if I had you would have killed me.”
“I know. I loved it, my love. Thank you,” He looked up just as it started raining and John just started laughing. Sherlock blinked slightly because he didn’t really think his comment warranted laughing. “What..?”
Like he said before, this time he really was done with Sherlock. If Sherlock decided to call him, he would listen, but it would take a lot for him to go back. It was Sherlock's move now and John was certain he wasn’t going to try and mend this. In a way, John was rather hoping he didn’t try.
Sigar groaned out in pain and closed his eyes a bit, “You say that now, but I don’t believe that at all and I don’t think that you do either.”
John started to calm down, everything felt so real... every touch, every word, even the way Sherlock smelled. He whimpered and just nodded against him. Everything would be okay now because Sherlock was here, he was back. “Don’t... don’t leave me.” John managed to get out before falling asleep almost immediately, the medicine too strong to fight now.
And if you cry it will be (W)
Sherlock closed his eyes and then stood up, “I’ll call you back before the day is over, he will retract his confession.” Before the DI could say anything he stood up and went to go pay his brother a visit.
John blinked rapidly and frowned, “Did you honestly think you were getting out alive? I mean... really?”
John swallowed dryly and his face hardened, “What.” It wasn’t a question, it was a statement. John didn’t like Jim... He didn't like Jim at all... in fact he hated the little worm! He always tried to outsmart him and to be the best at everything! He tried to steal all of John's boyfriends and beat him at the science fair and even steal some of his clients. He hated Jim more than he hated anyone in his whole entire life, but Sebby had been a good friend to him and his heart broke for the man. Well, as much as it can when you don’t actually have a heart.
Mike blinked rapidly, “umm why have you thrown this at me...?” He frowned as he watched John shred off his Westwood jacket, take off his button down shirt, and then walked over to the tile. He didn’t understand why John was getting half naked, but Mike didn’t understand a lot of things John did so he never questioned anything.
felt when all those girls were around him!
Eventually, he stood up and gave Sherlock one last look and a kiss on his cold lips before walking out of the room. That was their first kiss... and Sherlock wasn’t even around to share it with him. He walked to his parked car and got inside and then dialled a number he was hoping he would have been able to avoid.
John worried dissolved into nothing but happiness. He felt his stomach jump and twist with excitement thinking about what was to come, even if it meant just being friends. John was happy with whatever Sherlock was willing to give him. He smiled as they continued walking the rest of the way to Sherlock's house.
“John! No! This is why I didn’t want to tell you! I knew you would overreact.” Sherlock huffed, he didn’t even care that John had thrown his bag everywhere, he had more where that came from anyway, and he certainly wasn’t going to show John his arm.
**future me here. that's not even my handle anymore. bwahha and if you wanted to find the bracelet it would be so far down. anywayyyy catch me at omfgjohnlock boiiiiii
JoKe Of ThE cHaPtEr:
“You do not talk to me like that! You hear?” he screamed, walking over to John and yanking him up by his hair. “You can no longer be a
“You did so good... I am so proud of you.” He whispered quietly and just held Sherlock and that was really nice Sherlock thought because he really needed that comfort. He hadn’t had comfort in a over a month and it had been so hard to get through.
Brian groaned because really John was an idiot sometimes. “You punch him in the stomach… I already said that.” He said flatly.
John laughed, but then winced because that actually hurt a lot. “God, I love you.”
It was always over the strangest things too. Sherlock would do something that he wouldn’t even think twice about and John would go into a screaming fit before storming to the bedroom and slamming the door. He usually calmed down pretty quickly, and Sherlock would just sift the event away in his mind so that there wasn’t a repeat. He was really trying this time, and he briefly wondered if this was how John felt when he came back from the war. Sherlock's constant abuse at him for just existing. To be fair, John was never really outright rude to him, or verbally abusive, so he supposed that John had felt different all those years ago, even still, he couldn’t help but feel even more guilty at how he treated John back then.
This couldn’t be happening to him!! John was going to die thinking that Sherlock hated him and it was all his fault! This whole thing was his fault! He crawled over to John and placed his mouth over John's and pinched his nose and he breathed...
Doctor who.
“Sherlock!” John snapped into the phone when he didn’t answer, the realisation of what was actually happening crushing down on him like a brick, “This isn’t funny! Get down from there...” He said firmly, using his Captain Watson voice. Oh, John. That’s not going to work this time…
“Yes! We’ve discussed this already! She’ll get over it! Heaven knows how many people she accidently married…” The Doctor let a smile tug at his lips as he looked at Donna.
*Sings* I've been neglecting this one forever okay!!!!
They all sat on the grass and John was lost in thought. A week... only a week and then the life he thought he knew would be gone. He would have a different schedule and he would live in a different place... he would have to make new friends, he would have to learn new things, and he would have to work his arse off. He would have to follow orders and he would be so alone, but it would make him better and in the end John was sure it would be worth it. He was snapped out of his thoughts by one of his friends poking his shoe.
“It may have been just a guess, but my hell you were right,” John looked over at Sherlock and grinned. “I’m just… confused right now… but what about you?”
jOkE oF tHe ChApTeR:
John shrugged slightly, “More or less, I’m sure it’s fine though.” He said softly and sipped at it. It was an extremely satisfying cup of tea. He couldn’t place it, but it just made him feel warm and loose. Not to mention that it tasted so good to him, he figured it was probably because this was the end of all the pain and anguish – or he hoped it was anyway. Sherlock was back and they were going to get through this, they were going to get through anything the world threw at them, his body was finally letting him relax and enjoy the simple things in life.

DEUCES BITCHES.
Do you know what Mary had when she went to dinner? ((OMFG THIS IS PERFECT BECAUSE MARY MORSTAN MWAHAH?? OH YOU LAFFY TAFFY WRAPPER YOU!! I havent looked at the answer yet, but i'm going to say lamb because you know "Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb... blah blah blah"))
John stood there, glaring at Sherlock for a few seconds before turning around and storming out of the flat. He couldn’t stand to be with that
“What do you prefer?” John rolled his eyes, but was smiling at Sherlock.
“And I promise that I will live forever and ever, unless, it means that dying is going to save your life…” He paused and took a deep breath. He watched as John’s hands were playing with his fingers and he added very quietly, so quietly he wasn’t sure if John even heard it. “Wanna know why…”
GUESS WHAT!!!! IT'S THURSDAY!!! But seriously guys.... I upload on Thursdays because they are literally my favourite days of the week!!!
Sherlock pursed his lips and shrugged, “Too late now.” He hummed and went to go take a shower.
Mycroft grinned slightly, "I told you he was fine."
“So! How do you do it? How does it work!! How can you make it disappear! It is so intriguing! You must, must, must tell me, Doctor!” Sherlock bounced eagerly on the balls of his feet.
Mike smiled brightly, “practically unrecognisable...” He hummed. “It’s rather amazing actually... so you ready to go?”
He nodded slowly and then sighed, “if he hasn’t already left me behind yet.” He grumbled, but then kissed her head before running out of the room. He would go back and get monopoly later, but for right now he needed to find Sherlock because Lily was right this was never going to work if they didn’t talk. And right now John already knew too much to let it sit for any longer.
“Sherlock, he does not hate you. I know because if he did he wouldn’t be living with you,” She smirked.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, but it wasn't very effective because he was grinning from ear to ear and it just made him look creepy. "Shut up." He hummed.
i did manage to get a little chuckle out of that one.
*EDIT*
Sherlock knew he wouldn’t be able to last for long. He pulled away from John’s lips and buried his face into his neck while they moved. Seconds later, he moaned softly and then came all over John's stomach and his own.
“His name is Squirrely and he was my childhood pet, I never really did get over him. He comforts me sometimes, especially when things are hard.” John shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal.
A week passed and it was time for the funeral. John didn't want to go, but Claire and Garrett made him. He didn't go to the viewing so he figured he could at least go to this. Plus, Mycroft had put him down to speak and he hated the man for that. But also he thought that if he didn’t speak, or go for that matter, Sherlock would haunt him for all of eternity and as pleasing of a thought that was, he knew that Sherlock could be very cruel in his hauntings.
Sherlock's eyes widened in shock before he collapsed to the ground. He felt like he couldn't breathe and it was the worst pain he had ever felt in his life. He watched as the blood seeped out of him and onto the pool deck.
Mycroft opened the door and blinked a bit, “John..? You– You’re in your pants...” Thank god it was still Mycroft who lived here. A random stranger answering the door to a John in his pants would most not be good. He would probably end up in jail for the night for sexual harassment or some shite.
Sherlock swallowed hard and looked away as he remembered saying something vaguely similar to John when they first met. “Don’t talk like that...”
Sherlock choked on air and narrowed his eyes at him, "John! We have a case to solve! Maybe later... But I don't see why... We have a good life here..."
“Come pick me up.” He said with no emotion whatsoever, “I’m at St. Barts.”
Sherlock gave a small smile and nodded. “Yeah, I’m fine, but also stop blaming yourself. My father is just a bully,” He whispered. “And how the bloody hell could you forget?” He flailed slightly, not enough to cause him more pain than what he was already in. “Did you think I was just in here because I love getting random emergency surgeries!” He smirked back at him.
A: He was afraid of the bark! AHAHAHAHAH SO FUCKING FUNNY!!!! not.
John blinked a bit and then started to zone out again. He thought about everything that was going on in his life and wanted to scream because why was everything so fucking challenging? He really needed to get out of his head and focus on other things, it was unhealthy how much he thought about everything.
could she sound like that when this was the worst day of his life. “I thought you were on holiday? Are you back already?”
John ran out of the pool and went to a paying phone so they couldn't track him. He dialled 999 and waited for somebody to answer.
hated sleeping in clothes and wearing them the next day, but he didn’t have a choice. He sighed and just waited for Sherlock to get up, trying not to let it show on his face that he was uncomfortable in the clothing he was wearing. Going by his luck Sherlock would probably think he was uncomfortable being with him, which wasn’t the case. However, if Sherlock did notice, he didn’t say anything.
John’s mother looked at him like he had lost his marbles. “Picklewickle…?”
“I just...” He stopped himself and swallowed hard. He couldn’t tell Sherlock about who he really was, “I don’t want you to get hurt on a case....” He whispered.
Claire’s shift ended twenty minutes after John had left with that woman. She knew she hurt him and she wanted to apologise, but he was probably naked and fucking her right now so she decided to wait until the morning. She started walking in the direction of her flat, which also happened to be the opposite direction of John's flat. When she got halfway home she turned around and started walking to John’s place.
John gave a tight smile and nodded, “Okay...” Though he knew that wasn’t true at all.
“Well, of course I did. Now, eat and take your meds and then let’s get you in bed... you look completely exhausted.” She said softly and sat across from him.
Sherlock mumbles something under his breath, but John just pushes on.
“Oh, please.” He smiled brightly as his hand slid into John's, “Call me Sherlock and its rather night than afternoon, isn’t it?” he hummed and smirked as he pulled away and went to go knock on the door.
Question one:
“Sherlock, I don’t care… I want to do this.” He looked up at Sherlock and gave him big, watery eyes, “please.” He smiled a bit as he watched Sherlock sigh.
John?” He said a bit too bitterly for John's liking.
John tried to nod, but gave up. “Yes! I had pond water!” He hummed. “But halfway through the bunny spilled my pond water and so he had to go up and get me a new one… but he was just so nice! He kept saying how sorry he was and—Cakeman… I’m sleepy. Can I go to sleep?” John yawned and closed his eyes. “Night.” He whispered.
John's heart dropped. He had no idea how Brian knew… maybe he was just guessing… He had to be because if he wasn’t guessing John wouldn’t have heard the end up it. He honestly didn’t know though, but he wasn’t about to agree with the low life worm that was Brian. “Umm. You’re mistaken. I’m not gay.”
John didn’t answer him. He just looked at Zack like he had been kicked in the stomach and then cried harder. “I- I went to Brian, but he said I couldn’t stay because- because he had family over and now I’m here and I don’t- I don’t know what to do!” He sobbed harder and then ran into Zack’s arms. “Can I just come inside...?” he whispered in a small voice. In truth, Zack was another one of his best friends. They didn’t talk a lot ever since Sherlock, and Brian sort of took up a lot of space with his big personality, but John was also really close to Zack. They had known each other since they were four and they used to hang out all the time.
Sherlock just glared at him and didn’t say a single thing. He had no idea what was wrong with John, but he didn’t question it. John was just stressed.
Sherlock was a bit antsy today though because he hadn’t received a letter for two weeks... well one week and three days. It was just odd because he usually got his letters on Monday’s and it was already Thursday! He sat on the couch and paced as dread flooded through him. What if John had died! He talked about getting deployed in his last letter and that terrified Sherlock, but he managed to be strong on his side of the letter. Besides, he didn’t actually think John would get deployed that fast, and if he did the letter was probably late because he was getting set up with everything. Plus, now he would be farther away so it most likely took longer to mail.
Sherlock smiled softly. “I’m just saying it’s fine…” He slowly grabbed John's hand and entwined their fingers together once again. “It’s all fine.”
“John, you really need to shower. You haven’t showered in a week and you haven’t changed your clothes either. Your smell is giving me a migraine, I love you, but I can only handle so much.” He drawled with a sigh.
“What if the roles were reversed, Sherlock...? They
“God! You can't even flirt with me without becoming a sad little thing.” She joked with him and then smiled sadly, “Might help if you talk about it.” She said softly and then started to wipe down the counter.
Mike glanced at John who shook his head once. He looked back at Sherlock and shook his head, “Sorry, mate. I left it in my office...”
Sherlock swallowed and looked down. “My father is coming and if he sees you, he will want to meet you.” He whispered.
John's eyes widened and he shook his head, he knew what was happening, but without Sherlock explicitly saying so there was still hope, hope that maybe he was up there for a different reason – there was no hope now though. “No. I won’t keep it. I’ll promise you that, so don’t you fucking
“Hi...” He whispered quietly, “I know I never talk to you... or I never really come visit you, but... it’s just because it hurts too much. I hope you can understand that and don’t hate me for it… I like to think that if the roles were reversed you would do the same and that way I don’t feel as guilty.” He slowly took his fingers away from the lettering and sat back into the grass.
The voice over started up again, and the show cut back to yet more mobile footage, obviously taken a few minutes earlier, as the brawler in question, barely visible in the crowd of late night revelers who were spilled out in front of what looked like a night club, waved his arms wildly at someone off camera.
"I think you'll find that I never joke John."
John grinned slyly. Success. "I'm actually surprised they followed through with it to be honest. You can be very.... persuasive I imagine."
John burst out into drunken giggles and Sherlock fixed him with a look. "I'm being serious John."
"No need for a psych referral Doctor Watson. I'm just being colorful here. Since I was a kid I've had a hard time with many..." He trailed off, unsure of what to say. He sighed dramatically. "You don't know what it's like to possess a great mind."
"The label wants to solve this Sherlock. You know they just want what's best for your career and they've assured me they support you one hundred percent in getting past all of this and moving forward."
Today had been a bad day; it started at a label meeting in which a table full off suits shouted at him about "planning the launch strategy for an album that's not even half done yet" and progressed to someone slapping down a copy of the L.A Times, where an interview he had done months ago had been turned into some sort of 'should we have seen this coming?' hack job suitable for lining litter boxes everywhere, and had completely twisted his words.
Exhausted, he retired to the room that was to be his quarters--down the hall opposite the direction of Sherlock's--and flopped onto the bed. The room was spacious and comfortable, much nicer than his bedsit had been, and had a lovely view of the backyard and pool, as well as his own private bath.
"John, is there anything you're not telling me?"
I am sitting here in a quaint little coffee shop in Brooklyn, NY, the kind of place that hipsters flock to by the dozens, with its kitsch and it's ecofriendly free trade coffee and random boxes of obscure vinyl records placed here and there for the caffeine addicts to flip through at their leisure, waiting for Greg Lestrade, CEO of Capitol Records to breeze through the door at any moment. He's running a bit behind schedule, but such is the life when one is as incredibly busy as he is, and word from the label is he's out meeting with a perspective new artist in the area, hence our unusual meeting location. Whoever he's meeting must be incredibly lucky, as it takes almost an act of God himself to move this very important man from his vaulted tower, and into the world of us plebeians. Rumor has it, the last time he went in person to check out a potential artist signing was for the British boyband Deduction, and we all know how that turned out.
"Yep. Sherlock loves making people wait. He's the ultimate drama queen." She sighed and craned her neck to look over the crowd. The bathroom door was still shit but now there was a line of disgruntled looking men swarmed around it, and someone from security was pounding on the door, scowling.
The bar was packed, and he was accosted by several people who wanted to chat, take selfies, or buy him a shot. He didn't refuse the shots, for that would be poor form indeed, and after slamming back a Jaeger Bomb or two (absolutely vile) he stumbled his way back to John, pleasantly buzzed.
The weeks dragged on and while there wasn't much movement on the Sherlock front--he was still incredibly closed off and barely said a handful of words in John's presence--he at least had stopped slinking off to God knows where, leaving John in the lurch. There were a series of heated phone calls between Sherlock and Mycroft that John overheard, and a day later Mycroft informed him that he would be spending the next few weeks, or longer, accompanying Sherlock to the studio where he had scheduled time with various producers lined up. Mycroft warned him that this could be a "danger" time, and to keep a trained eye and a tight rein on him.
"Look Sherlock," John dropped his voice, and took a step closer, ignoring the way it made Sherlock flinch. "If we could just, I don't know, go somewhere quieter and talk? I think that would be good."
"It's... complicated."

"Danger time? Hmm, and why would you think that? My brother has been exceptionally well behaved lately."
"Blocked? Like...you're constipated?"
#breaking is
If you are on twitter and/or follow celebs on there then this makes perfect sense to you. If not then you are probably hella confused and I'm sorry LOL
"Ah. Well welcome John. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of each other."
John wasn't sure how to respond to that. If he didn't know any better, he would say Sherlock almost sounded jealous. But that was insane, wasn't it? They barely knew each other. Sherlock barely wanted to spend time in his presence. The moment had grown awkward, like so many moments between them, so John backpedaled.
Everyone in the biz did cocaine recreationally. It wasn't a big deal. It was only a big deal if you didn't know how to handle it and let it get out of control.
Well, Moriarty was never one to mince words, was he? Still though, ouch. Cold. Guess the rumors are true, and the bad blood from the band's tumultuous break up still exists.
Oh. Oh, well yes. Mycroft knew very well indeed what they weren't supportive of; he knew the industry by now and he knew it well. It had never been mentioned, and frankly Mycroft didn't think that Sherlock ever would, but he had suspected it for years. It was clear that Sherlock wasn't going to give voice to it specifically, that was perhaps a bit too much to expect at this point, but just the implication of it was enough.
"I, uh, feel like we should hug or something. Should we hug?" John looked awkward now, and it was adorable. He sat up and scratched at the back of his neck. Apparently, they were both drunk enough for not only heartfelt late-night chats but physical affection.
It was a shame then that he was out of his stash, and his go to guy was being heavily monitored by his bastard of a brother. This would have to take the edge off instead.
'Surveilling!?"
"If the music isn't speaking to you, if you feel it isn't what you want, well there are things we can do to change that without throwing in the towel. The label has expressed no issue with exploring different producers and the A&R guys are more than willing to..."
Sherlock had been quiet and standoffish the rest of the night, which John pinned down to his incredibly stupid 'foot in mouth' moment. Idiot, he scolded himself, to say something so blunt like that (did he expect Sherlock to bare his soul in the middle of his living room?) just as they'd been getting to know each other. John had felt as if they had been clicking; there had been an instant chemistry between them, but whatever tentative something had been happening, it was replaced by a cold, business like atmosphere. Perhaps it was for the best, considering how Sherlock was even more gorgeous in person, and how utterly drawn to him John found himself.
"Go right ahead. It's not like anyone here has cared about what I want." John shot an accusatory look over his shoulder, back at the woman who had more or less forced him here, lingering in the doorway. The man across from him raised his eyebrows in surprise--perhaps he'd been expecting someone more compliant--and inclined his head toward his assistant, lackey, or whoever she was, signaling that her presence was no longer needed.
Yes, this was much, much better.
"Well, no. I mean, it's not exactly surprising that someone in the entertainment industry is gay. Its more surprising if they're not I suppose." John remembered his sister saying that line in the past, when she'd gotten into a heated row with someone at the pub over whether or not an actor from their favorite television show was gay or not. It seemed an appropriate deflection.
And then John saw something that really caught his eye.
"I'm impressed you even know what the Met Gala is."
Without a warning, she flooded the gas and John felt his stomach lurch. He'd heard a bit about L.A traffic, but this was insane. The freeway stretched across multiple lanes, and each one was almost bumper to bumper with cars. They weren't moving very fast, and Mrs. Hudson said to be thankful they were moving at all, before she pulled a complicated set of maneuvers that had John gripping the door handle so tight his knuckles were white.
"Best new artist Grammy." Sherlock cut the silence, affecting an air of boredom. He felt a small bit of satisfaction at how it made John jump and continued on. "Do you know how many winners of that award go on to linger in obscurity? It's more of a curse to win it than an honor really."
She simply quirked her brow and pursed her lips.
For seconds, or minutes, he wasn't sure, it was pure bliss. John's lips were soft and pliant, and Sherlock wasn't sure if he was kissing back or not, but he was too far gone to care. Like someone had flipped off a switch, all the noise in his mind was silenced. All that was left was the gentle thud of his heart and the clarity he'd been longing for.
"Hello there, and you must be John." She exclaimed, her accent saying born and bred in London. Did the Holmes brothers associate exclusively with Brits? "Oh, well of course you're John. It's not like I go around letting strange men into my car willy nilly." She looked thoughtful for a second. "At least not anymore. But the seventies were a different time, you know? People were much freer about such things then. Well, you understand." She patted his shoulder in a motherly way, leaving him a bit at a loss for words.
said: What do you think of the rumors going around that Sherlock
Yes, Sherlock was attracted to John Watson, and every day it got a little worse, just like his music block. Great. Wonderful.
At the end of a long hallway, Anthea opened a door and led him into a room that looked like a study; wing back chairs framed a beautiful fireplace, while heavy draperies blocked out any light from the windows, and the carved, floor to ceiling shelves were packed with books calling out to be touched. He could lose himself in here for good day or so, curled up by the fire with a good book and an even better drink.
When John had been discharged, his inappropriate (and secret) relationship with his CO Major James Sholto had come to an abrupt and painful ending. "It could never work. It would be better for both of us to part as friends." he had said, as John had held back desperate tears. He had loved James more than anyone before; he was the first man he had ever had more than an idle sexual attraction to, and the loss of it, on top of everything else, was a knife twist to the gut. When he'd returned to London he hadn't had the energy to try dating again, and besides a few one-night stands (each with varying degrees of satisfaction), he was living quite the celibate existence. However, tonight his libido had awoken from the dead, and he cupped himself, giving himself a few experimental tugs.
omg plz collab with
John" she whispered as if there was someone else nearby to overhear them) the boys had set her up with a cushy gig. Her official title was housekeeper, but since Sherlock was rarely home, it didn't leave her with much to do, but there's a Mrs. Turner who is the housekeeper next door for two married "homosexual actors" that she's friendly with, and she spends an uncomfortable amount of time waxing poetic about how it's so wonderful that the world is changing and how the neighborhood has "all kinds" of people like them.
"I won't say anything. Besides we're not exactly on speaking terms anyways."
Sherlock's house was situated off a particularly winding road in the Hollywood hills, a street name that he instantly forgot, and John suspected that when he finally ventured out on his own he would be lucky to find it again. Perhaps that was the point; as a celebrity, Sherlock must value his privacy, so having a hard to find place, nestled in a nook somewhere in the hills, was probably for the best. According to Mrs. Hudson most of his neighbors were in the entertainment business and from the glimpses of the houses he saw as they drove past, they did pretty well for themselves indeed.
"If controlling you means you don't flame out too early like so many before you, then I'm all for it." John snapped, surprised by the passion in his voice. Sherlock seemed a bit taken aback too, as he fixed John with a scrutinizing look and said nothing.
"Sherlock..."
John rolled his eyes. He felt a bit like a scolding Mum. "You're a singer. You should know better."
Sherlock Holmes. The dude is a mess now and he's always pinged my
Sally gave him a scrutinizing look, like she was trying to read all his secrets. He'd been told all his life that everything was readable on his face, so he looked away, pretending to watch the crowd. He debated telling her what happened, that Sherlock had kissed him and it ended badly, but decided she didn't really need to know.
"Afghanistan." Sherlock said quietly. It wasn't a question. He looked up and resumed watching John; his jaw was set and his eyes had a sadness around them. He simply nodded.
Sherlock's voice was bitter as he interrupted. "You know that's not true though. There are other things they aren't exactly supportive of." There was an audible gulp.
"He'll be in shortly." Anthea said, somewhat ominously, before directing all her attention back to texting, and John was left to wonder... who?
'Is he the British Justin Bieber?" John giggled, feeling proud that he at least had one current reference in his pocket. The nurses at work were seemingly obsessed with the American singer and his "antics". John didn't know him or his music from Adam, but he sounded like a prat. If this Sherlock was anything like Bieber--and John could read between the lines--then he probably was just as much trouble.
"No." Was all Sherlock said, all the reply he would dignify Mycroft with. The nerve of his brother and his schemes. This was not about protecting him, no matter how strongly he defended himself, it was about control, plain and simple. "Absolutely not."
They headed out one evening, a car paid for by the label had been sent for them, and John was surprised they were getting such a late start. Sherlock informed him that he did all his sessions in the evening, as it was the best time for him to be in the mood to work. They ended up at a recording studio off Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, called Sunset Sounds, and while the outside of the building was hardly impressive, it was the history of the premises that grabbed John's attention. Led Zeppelin, The Stones and The Doors all had recorded there, and when one of the music engineers told him Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys was recorded there, well John just about lost his mind.
If you would be so kind as to tell me the reason for your little disappearing act today? John didn't go into it but I was not born yesterday brother mine. I know when something else is going on.
(See the end of the chapter for
hey are we invited?
But John couldn't get lost down that road, not now, nor could he afford to hide out in his bed forever, no matter how tempting it was to burrow back into the warm sheets. He had to get out and confront this. He had to apologize and he wasn't sure. He just knew he had to talk to him.
"Your musical frame of reference stops at 1985. What would you know?"
"You're doing that thing again you know."
"You're a wounded war veteran with a penchant for danger and a severe lack of excitement in your life is currently sucking your soul dry, would you say that's accurate?" He didn't leave time to respond before he plowed on. "You need more in your life. More, so that the firearm that you aren't supposed to have and no one knows about, doesn't find its way into your mouth some night. No, you need a challenge in life, and Sherlock is the biggest challenge of them all."

She seemed to consider this for a moment, before nodding in assent. She smiled, amused, and pocketed her phone, standing up with purpose. "My name is Anthea."
"This is designer. Designer, John. A gift from a designer, made especially for me for last year's Met Gala. Hardly comparable."
"You could, but you know no other manager will have you."
your Twitter handle is a lie then?
"Let me fill you in then."
"Uh, I'm John. John Watson."
"Oh really? And what was the theme of the gala? Poncy twats?"
"So, I was talking to McMillian at your party..." Henry trailed off, stiffening slightly against him as if he was nervous.
"Yea you know, a man or woman you date to hide the fact you're not straight? It's been around since the beginning of time. Nasty business."

"You sure aren't." John smiled at him, and Sherlock wondered if he was aware of just how much he was giving away on that damn expressive face of his. For the first time in years, Sherlock was acutely aware someone's eyes on him; he was used to the world watching him, judging him, so why was being the sole center of John's attention so unnerving?
Sherlock flopped down on the sofa and stretched out languorously until his shirt rode up, giving a nice view of his belly button. "Stress reliever John. You should try it sometime. The guns here are cheap and plentiful and so easy to get you have no idea."
Sherlock snorted. "Here in L.A. John, appearances are everything. What you wear tells the world what they should know about you. And what you're wearing is saying 'grandpa up past his bedtime'".
don't be mad at all these ~haters all your true fans believe in you and love you!!!
"Yes. Just noticed, that did you?"
Mycroft grimaced. "One of my brothers many awards. He shipped it to me with a special message. Thought he was so clever with that."
"And what does he sing?"
"I see." Mycroft fixed him with another unnerving stare (it was seriously impossible to decipher anything the man was thinking), before getting up and crossing the room, stopping at the far corner, and pressing his palms firmly into a section of the paneled wall that looked different from the rest. A few gentle pushes sent the section of wall swinging outwards, revealing a hidden cubby hole of sorts that housed a gorgeous bar, stacked with crystal tumblers, and bottles of liquor that probably belonged to Napoleon or something.
I work at a hospital. It's such a chore to get doctors to close their encounters!! I feel ya John.

"They're cozy!"
There was even a web of twinkling string lights crisscrossing the whole of the yard, casting it in a magical party glow, making it obvious this wasn't the first shindig held here. If John hadn't been so utterly furious, he would have been more than ready to enjoy what looked like an amazing party, but instead he searched through the crowd for a tangle of black curls, his whole body tense.
"Let me. It's my job." It was more than a job though, and John knew it. Sherlock, despite everything, was a friend and right now John was genuinely worried, especially since Sherlock had looked seriously out of it there.
Yeah, just to say don't always believe what you read in the gossip rags, and keep an eye out for some new music, which is really what we're all here for, no? Trust me you will not be disappointed.
Gosh, we don't think we've ever written something so complimentary about Sherlock Holmes. The fan girls in the comments won't know what to do with themselves! Congrats darling! You've arrived!

The man didn't seem to care much who John was and continued blustering on; he spoke at length about his duties at the label and all the hits he had been responsible for. John tuned him out after a few minutes, and when Sherlock made eye contact with him again, his brow furrowing, John subtly tilted his head in Anderson's direction and made a big show of rolling his eyes, which seemed to amuse Sherlock, and he cracked a beautiful smile.
Sherlock said nothing.
Shortly after the group disbanded, Sherlock, only 19 at the time, changed management (keeping it all in the family he hired his elder brother Mycroft Holmes) and launched a massively successful solo career, with a debut album spawning several top ten hits, two number ones, and a slew of Grammy nominations, with two wins for Song of The Year and Pop Vocal of The Year. There was no question that Sherlock Holmes was riding high and poised to go even higher. The sky was the limit for this talented young man, however the incidents of the last few months--drinking, fighting and other shockingly bad behavior--have many in the industry wondering if Sherlock is nothing but a shooting star, flaming out at only 22 years old.
"You're a mad man."
"Where are we going?"
The dramatic coat, the windswept hair, the collar turned up to highlight his cheekbones just so?
Mycroft took a deep breath; the last bit of that outburst had stung--if anyone, anyone on this godforsaken planet cared what Sherlock Holmes wanted, it was Mycroft, and he had spent the last few months worrying himself into a state over it. However, he was also keenly aware that they lived in a world that existed beyond what Sherlock wanted, and that compromises needed to be made.
All John had been able to pry from the woman named Anthea, was that he was here to meet someone for "career advancement", but unless he had somehow fumbled his way into the plot of a Bond film, and they needed a general practitioner with a slight tremor for a top-secret mission, he wasn't sure what kind of legitimate employer would conduct business like this.
"My Dad loved this album. Played it to death every time he got into one of those moods. You know, one of those 'my life didn't work out exactly the way I planned and now it's time to escape' moods." John looked wistfully upwards, as a hand scratched at his stomach. "So basically, every bloody day."
Henry's face was so stricken with hurt, with betrayal, that Sherlock felt physically ill. Sherlock had snapped at him before, they'd had had plenty of rows through the years, but this was beyond any of them.
Just a heads up here that the site will be experiencing some downtime tomorrow afternoon for general maintenance so if you can't log in please don't freak out.
I also wanted to pop in and address the situation going on in the forums right now. Yes, we all KNOW that Sherlock has been the recipient of some bad press lately but that does not excuse the members of this forum from the nasty fighting and downright trolling going on. THIS WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED. Any posts that violate the rules of this community, which is to celebrate our mutual love of all things Sherlock, will be edited by our moderators, or deleted completely. Failure to comply will end in a banishment from this site.
omggggggg I think he needs to come out already
"It's possible. I honestly wouldn't know."
It looked as if it pained Sherlock to acknowledge him, but he replied. "Out. I had pressing engagements."
"How is it possible to be this out of touch?" Sherlock bit his lip to hold back a laugh. "It's an English band. Indie rock, electropop sort of stuff."
"Have you checked his regular bolt holes?"
Sherlock sneered. "Oh, John. A person in my line of work doesn't have friends. We have acquaintances, colleagues, frenemies, PR squad friends," he made a pair of air quotes and rolled his eyes. "Assistants, assistants to assistants, backup dancers, choreographers, stylists, miscellaneous people on the payroll, and assorted wannabes, hangers on and sycophants."
The man did not look amused. "No one forced you to do anything Dr. Watson. She did not threaten you nor did she hold a gun to your back--"
"Is that a Brit award? Damn, you were not joking were you."
Sherlock groaned. "When I told you that I was... Really drunk. I mean yeah it would be great to come out but..."
"I'm... sorry?"
This was a lot to take in. "So, you want me to babysit your spoiled brat of a famous baby brother?"
He drained the last of his tea, slamming the cup down into the saucer with a bit more force than necessary, and was fully prepared to gather his coat and leave, glancing out the window towards the gray storm clouds headed their way (of course it would be threatening to rain when he hadn't brought an umbrella with him. Of course.) when he heard a soft clearing of the throat behind him.
On top of an overturned wooden crate sat a record player, and there were at least four crates surrounding that one, each overflowing with vinyl. Anything that couldn't fit into the crates was piled into stacks that leaned up against the wall or the leg of the piano. It was a beautiful sight. Even though vinyl records had made somewhat of a resurgence in the past few years, especially among music purists and so-called hipsters, it was still a rare sight to see, especially in the house of someone so young.
Mycroft hung up without so much as a farewell, and John tossed his phone onto the passenger seat, slamming on the gas and headed for location number one on a long, long list of places Sherlock could possibly be.
"I apologize John. I wasn't thinking. It won't happen again."
t's totally Harry Styles. Larry is real. We all know
"It's just this is the first time we've ever spoken is all."
?" He read out loud, fingertips tracing over the inscription.
"Talk to me when you're ready to stop lying to the world." Was all he said, before gathering up his things and leaving. His abrupt exit made the rest of them fall silent and look at each other, wondering what in the hell they had missed.
It better be.
"Mrs. Hudson dear." She said, pulling the car out of the congested arrivals area and moving into traffic. All around them L.A beckoned to be taken in, but John couldn't stop staring at the strange woman across from him. "And you can call me Mrs. Hudson, if you don't mind. It may be old fashioned but I feel I've earned at least a little formality. I've waited all these years for the so called respect that comes with a life long lived, but all I've gotten for my trouble is a bum hip, so they can sod right off with that nonsense!" She tittered, eyes glued to the road. "Thank God California is a medical marijuana state."
no Sherlock is not gay stop leave him alone ugh you fangirls need2 stop
Sally threw her head back and laughed so hard her curls bounced. "No. I don't go for that shit, and even if he asked me to I would say no. Got too much self-respect for that. Not that I think he would. Sherlock doesn't seem to care much what others think."
So, they were finally going to talk about this then? Fine. Good. John sat up straighter in his chair and fixed him with a stern look. "I am here because your brother thinks you need help. He's concerned about you, that's all. There's no grand conspiracy to cramp your style."
#sherlockholmesisoverparty
Sherlock looked aghast and John stifled back a laugh. Everything about Sherlock screamed that he wasn't the outdoorsy type, and he expected him to decline, but surprisingly he said "Fine."
"And you would be?" John asked, and her eyes narrowed before flicking down to a Blackberry in her hand, and she began quietly typing away. Ok this was getting weird now.
It wasn't as awkward as he thought it would be, having John inside his orbit like this. Being in his home, involved in other aspects of his life, well that was one thing, but bringing him to the place where he let loose--sometimes a bit too loose--was another. To let John see him like this, using the lights and the noise (and ok, a few shots) and the energy of the crowd to drown out his mind, was a huge step. Not that John knew what was happening, of course, but Sherlock felt it just the same. Overall it was a tamer version of his usual outings; there were none of the usual suspects pushing various mind-altering substances at him, and none of the sheltered privacy of the VIP area where anything went, but it was nice. Wholesome almost. And it was working; his head was momentarily clear and that's all that mattered.
The noise grew again and he shook his head, holding back the tears that threatened to fall. How could he be so stupid? He had to get out of there, so he turned on his heel and fled to the sound of John calling after him.
"It's not that simple Henry and you know that. Despite your overall charming country bumpkin persona, you didn't just fall off the so-called turnip truck. You know more than anyone how hard it is to be out in the biz."
"Charming."
IDK why but I feel like John would be really into classic rock
"Sherlock... stop."
"Is that a Grammy!?" John choked out, astonished. He got up to take a closer look, and sure enough, the gold gramophone sat there, as if this was all totally normal. "Song of the Year....
What had been so easy, so taken for granted, was gone, and Sherlock had nothing left but the buzzing of a million thoughts and emotions, battling for dominance, and an angry label who wanted their next hit album and wanted it now. He was also left to think about.... other things. Things that had taken him by surprise.
'BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!'
go away you ruined Deduction by leaving
Probably Sherlock. But YAWN. I don't like him.
"Oh, shit. I probably shouldn't have said anything then." Her bright fuscia lips pulled into a grimace. "You don't seem surprised though."
Sherlock let out a noise that sounded like a toddler throwing a tantrum and pulled at the sides of his hair. "Argh! I knew this would happen! I knew you were here to ruin my life and make me look like a fool!"
The others, sensing this was coming, had all skittered away, fiddling with this and that and trying to stay out of the blast radius.
I know we are all HEARTBROKEN over Sherlock's flounce from social media but that just means it's time for all of us to stay strong and band together. Also, our lovely moderator HolmesIsWhereTheHeartIs has an extensive archive of ALL of Sherlock's now deleted Instagram posts(as well as an archive of his tweets) and is in the process of putting those up shortly. YAY!
Sherlock watched from the doorway; he was quiet as a mouse when he needed to be, and the man currently invading his home and rifling through his personal possessions was unaware of his presence. So this was John Watson, the man sent all the way from back home to hold his hand and make sure he was a good boy. He felt the corner of his lip start to curl into a snarl and did his best to tamp that bitter feeling down. It wouldn't do any good to start off with a fight and perhaps if he played along, was civil enough, he could convince this John that he didn't really need to much of his minding, and could be somewhat left alone.
“It was in code.”
John raced down to the main floor, his heart pounding in his chest. “Someone's taken Rosie. She's not there!” he panted as he burst into the kitchen, only find Sherlock calmly sitting on a chair, feeding Rosie her mushed baby food. “Oh.” False alarm. John's face with a bit red with embarrassment. “Sorry, I...”
John crossed the room to the sofa and hovered over Sherlock. “Be good,” he said as he leaned over to give him a kiss. Then he leaned even further down to kiss Rosie on the top of her head. She seemed more interested in devouring her toy.
John pulled the phone from Sherlock's hands, trying to gain his attention. "Because you were so intent on marrying me." The phone was placed on the bedside table. "And now I'm starting to think you don't want to anymore."
Sherlock nodded though he wasn't listening. Her words slurred into one sound in his mind.
“It's fine.”
“Did the victims know each other? Did they all die at the same time by the same cause? Why are they connected?”
“That's not the point,” Mycroft huffed. “You're frankly quite lucky to have a second chance to ask him. What if the bullet had killed him?”
“I'm heading to work,” John said as he grabbed his coat off the hanger. John couldn't help but smile when he took in the sight of Sherlock and Rosie curled up together on the sofa. It looked so natural. “What are you reading?”
Sherlock smiled as he sipped his tea. Their relationship still went without a title, but it was nice to see John worrying about the kind of impressions they'd give. Some days he couldn't believe they were an actual couple and when he realised that, his stomach felt nervous but in a good way.
John took Eleanor from her carrier and gently placed her in Sherlock's arms, making sure he was supporting her head properly. It took him a moment to figure out how to hold her, how to make her feel safe and secure in his arms without holding her too tight.
“I want to hold her.”
John pulled back the blankets and coated his fingers with the lube and glanced at Sherlock's hard cock. Sherlock felt sudden embarrassment as John stared at him and he just wanted to hide under the blankets again. No one ever saw him this vulnerable or this exposed and he was nearly afraid John would say something hurtful.
“Why are you here?”
“I've been thinking,” John said after a long pause, his cheeks red.
Sherlock gave up. The button was impossible. How John managed to button it this morning was beyond him. It refused to cooperate and Sherlock's cheeks flushed with embarrassment. A single button was keeping him from John. With an annoyed grunt, he tugged at the shirt and the button (along with a few others) ripped off.
“Yeah, fine.” John didn't have the heart to tell Sherlock to take a different train or stay in a different hotel. The fact that the conference and case were at the same place was just a coincidence. But Sherlock was one of the things John wanted to think about. Just over a month ago, John had gotten drunk and kissed Sherlock. Since then, John had acted as if he couldn't remember that event to save himself and Sherlock the embarrassment of talking about it. But as much as he said he couldn't remember that night, he certainly could, and in great detail. “Just tired. Eleanor's been keeping me up.”
Mycroft smiled. This case was an easy one. Even Sherlock could figure it out on his own. No, he didn't come here for help with a case, he came for another reason. “Isn't it obvious? It was a secret twin.”
Sherlock scowled.
“No, it was selfish of me to expect you to drop everything for Rosie.” John got in bed next to him and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder. “We should have worked out a plan. What to do when I'm at work and you get a case.” Sherlock was about to reply, but John interrupted him. “It's not fair to rely on Mrs Hudson to always look after her either.” It was obvious Mrs Hudson adored the child and found any excuse to visit her. At times she'd even urge Sherlock and John to go out for the night so she could keep Rosie all to herself. But it wasn't right to expect her to drop everything to look after Rosie on a whim. “I was thinking about hiring a babysitter.”
What just happened?
Soon enough John realised what the problem was.
“No.”
John's hotel room was basic. It had a bed, desk, television, radiator and attached bathroom, but none of it was overly thrilling. Beige carpet, beige walls, beige bedsheets. John placed his suitcase on the bed and frowned as it sunk into the mattress.
John's heart skipped a beat when he heard the offer. He had sworn off case work with Sherlock when Eleanor was born. It was too dangerous for him and he wanted his child to grow up with normal parents. As normal as a former army doctor and ex-assassin could be as parents. John and Mary had promised each other to change their ways, to put raising Eleanor first on their list of priorities.
Lestrade tried to hide his smile. “'Course. In fact I'm a bit surprised he never asked you first.”
“What's wrong?” Sherlock looked concerned when he felt John pull away. “Did I do something wrong? Did I – ”
Sherlock started to undo John's belt with shaking hands. It was easier than the button at least. When that was undone, he slid John's jeans down to his thighs and stared at the bulge concealed by his underwear. Sherlock shoved his hand past the elastic waistband and John arched his back in surprise when he felt a hand press against his cock.
John pulled a face. “You don't know anything about cardiology.”
“I just want the flat to look nice, that's all,” John replied.
Remember our deal.
“You didn't even let me finish.” John kissed Sherlock's cheek as he ran his fingers through his dark hair. “I only want someone perfect looking after Rosie, too. But if I'm going to work and you're going to go on cases, we need someone to look after Rosie.”
With a swift movement, John had Sherlock pinned to the bed. The unused bedsprings creaked at the sudden weight of them. John's fingers felt their way through Sherlock's hair and Sherlock tried to stop himself from trembling. This was so much easier to do when drunk.
John shrugged. “Cramps or something. Something's a bit off with her womb, but it'll sort itself out in time.”
“Who was it from?”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock was about ready to leave the room to search elsewhere for weapons, but his gaze stayed on the bed. Or rather, the space under the bed where the laptop was.
(See the end of the chapter for
With the button out of the way, Sherlock closed the distance between himself and John and started to kiss down John's bare neck. John closed his eyes and allowed Sherlock to do what he wanted: kiss, bite, nibble. It had been ages since he was kissed like that and he wasn't about to let it stop. In fact, he wanted more.
Sherlock sat on a plastic chair in the hospital's waiting room. A wall clock obnoxiously ticked away and the water cooler hummed as it tried to get the water to a lukewarm temperature.
John glanced down at his ring finger. “Yeah. I should probably take it off. Not like Mary's coming back.”
“But you found something that wasn't so normal.”
“The next time we both get time off, we'll take a look at some people. How's that sound?”
Quadruple murder it looks like. G.
“Don't you get lonely? Want someone to talk to? A friend, maybe?” he went on. “A ... a good friend? A girlfriend, maybe? Or ... or a--”
Sherlock went silent.
Sherlock watched from the window as John went into the cab and saw it drive off. “I'm afraid of losing you.”
“H-how's that?” John asked.
"No."
Molly bit her lip. “So why is it you've come here?” She couldn't stay angry with Sherlock, she knew that. And if he needed help, she'd give it to him. But she wished she could be seen as his equal instead of something he could use.
John grabbed the mat, nappy, and a few baby wipes from the carrier and took Eleanor to the bathroom. And just like that, Sherlock was alone again. The baby still fussed and Sherlock could hear her whines from the bathroom and John's gentle voice still trying to comfort her.
“That's actually not a children's book.”
Red and blue lit up the street as the police cars neared. A few people in pyjamas and housecoats had left their houses to see what the noise was about. It was obvious this tiny neighbourhood never saw much action and a few of the spectators pulled their phones out to catch some of the action.
“Fine. She's fine.”
“No really,” John continued. “I'm happy with you.”
“We haven't seen what's in the envelope. For all we know it's a cheque with a very large sum of money from a family member. Maybe a belated birthday card from a friend. We can't form conclusions when we ignore the--”
“I don't want a
Rosie tugged on Marcella's red hair again. “No, Rosie's always been good.”
What they had didn't need a name. It didn't need to be in a category of “boyfriends” or “partners” or “lovers.” They were happy together and that was the only thing that mattered.
John picked up the envelope before he sat down in its spot and placed it on his lap. A mix of emotions were expressed on his face. Anger, betrayal, sadness, and a certain look of hurt Sherlock had never seen before.
“John...” Sherlock replied. Hearing his name send shivers down his spine.
The two locked eyes while the hall was emptying. There was noise and chatter around them and a few people nudged into John on their way out. The pause between them was growing awkward and John wanted to just talk. Ask if he wanted to get some dinner. Invite him to his room and get overpriced room service. Do something that would have felt natural before he kissed Sherlock. But things were ruined, weren't they? John's stupid drunken self ruined everything.
“What's wrong with her?”
“What's this?”
“Good plan.” Lestrade crossed one leg over the other. “So when's the wedding going to be? Spring weddings are always nice. I got married in the spring, right when the flowers were blooming. But I think you'd get married in the colder months like November. It'd be an indoor wedding, of course.”
There was something about the man in the back of the police cruiser and Lestrade couldn't figure out what. There was a certain charm about him he found irresistible and he wanted more of it. “Listen... if you sober up, get your shit together, I think you'd be a pretty great asset to the Yard.”
Sherlock leaned against the kitchen counter, keeping space between himself and John. Silence fell between them. Before, when John still lived with him, there was silence. But that silence filled the room and made the flat feel warm. No one felt obligated to make conversation, or break the quiet.
“How about David?”
Sherlock dropped the teabags into two separate mugs and stood by the kettle, waiting for it to boil. “Planning on having more children?” There was a certain edge to his voice as he stared intently at the kettle, refusing to look at John.
“Oh! For--!” A sudden rage took over and Sherlock smacked the wall as he turned to face John. “Why? Why is it so important I meet anyone? Why do I need someone else? I don't. I work alone. I'm happy alone. I'm my best self. Alone.” Everyone asked him that question. Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, even Mycroft. It wasn't as if he could just go into the street and find himself a replacement John. Couldn't fall in love with just any old idiot. People were stupid, boring, predictable. And John was all of that and more.
“There we are!” John said as he brought Eleanor back into the living room, resuming his chair. The changing mat was folded up again and tucked back into the carrier. Eleanor sucked on a patch of her blanket that neared her mouth. She was probably getting hungry and John didn't have extra bottles with him. If she didn't get fed soon, she'd start to fuss again.
“What difference does his life make?” she asked. “If he lives or dies, what does it matter? If I live or die, what does that matter? So many people here to protect a single life. It's silly, isn't it? We go to such lengths for one person. But what does one person matter?”
“Right.” John pulled the blanket back to reveal one of her tiny, delicate hands. All the bones were there, all tendons and veins where they needed to be. Sherlock took a moment to appreciate just how perfectly made she was. Just how two cells coming together to create something as complicated as her. John pressed his index finger to her palm and she instinctively held onto it. She whined and shrugged her shoulders before settling herself into her blankets again. “This is Eleanor. Eleanor Elizabeth Watson.”
“Your shoe.” Sherlock pointed to his left foot. John looked down.
The conference was boring. The man suspected for cheating on his wife – Dr Richardson – droned on and on from behind a podium. The hall was full of nearly one hundred people, both young and old. Some were jotting down notes and nodding their heads as they listened, while others (like John) were ready to fall asleep. John found his bed too lumpy and didn't sleep as well as he would have liked and found it difficult to keep his eyes open.
“Where?”
John hadn't visited Sherlock or even texted him. In a short week, it seemed John had completely forgot about Sherlock. But maybe that's all Sherlock was to John: some sort of diversion of his own sadness. Perhaps John just needed someone to replace Mary and now that she was back, he didn't need Sherlock anymore.
“Then why not arrest her anyway?” Sherlock snapped the night before as he tried to get himself comfortable on the old sofa. It was the very same sofa he slept on years before when he had first met Lestrade. “While you question her, I'll talk to John. Get him and Rosie somewhere safe.”
Without warning the pain came. John fell to his knees, then to the ground, settling himself in a forming puddle. The army of officers charged at the suspect, but they ignored John, left him lying on the pavement.
“Oh.”
John shrugged. “Well if we're going to...” he cleared his throat, “I'd at least want to do it...right, I guess.”
Sherlock smiled. “Not afraid of you. I was never afraid of you. I –” The headlights from the cab could be seen from the flat window. John stepped back from Sherlock and wiped his lips with the back of his sleeve. Even though he was still drunk, he seemed to realize what was happening: that their moment was over and he had to return to being a husband. John gave a nod as he stepped out of the flat.
The man didn't pull a diamond from his pocket. Instead he revealed the pistol he had been hiding and pointed it directly at the officer. The officer mirrored the movement, pulling his own gun out. Sherlock took a step back, now deciding this was a matter for the police.
“What about--”
“Hmm.” To Sherlock, their relationship felt forced. Something had wedged between them, but he wasn't entirely sure what.
I apologise for my sudden absence. I've been suddenly busy (I'm currently abroad now) but this fic hasn't been forgotten and I still have plans for it.
“Can I see it?”
The next day John took a later train back to London.
When the conference was over, John stood up and stretched his back. “How's the case coming?” he muttered to Sherlock.
“He's making a funny face. I think I'll put a hole through it.”
“You won't believe this, but I locked my own keys
The officers lunged at her while she fired a bullet.
John shook his head. “Still don't know where the gun is. I went about her things, trying to find it when I found the envelope.”
John couldn't hide his disappointment. He was so excited to have Eleanor in his life and he had hoped Sherlock would have shared that excitement. Or at least tried to. It wouldn't be that hard to fake a smile and hold the baby for a few minutes at least.
“John thinks I don't like weddings.”
A woman patted his face. “Come on John, stay awake with me,” she said. “We're gonna get you looked after, don't you worry.”
John had sat straight up in bed when he heard his phone vibrate against the bedside table. That night, he had trouble sleeping. Most nights he had trouble sleeping and the phone was a welcome distraction.
“Hmm?” Sherlock didn't look up from the book.
“Because he wasn't put off by your line of work,” Mycroft began. “Because he actually likes following you around on cases. Because he likes the danger you put him in. Because John can't stand to live a boring life.” That was reason enough, but Mycroft felt it necessary to continue. “When you faked your death he forgave you. He came back to you.” Still, there was more evidence that needed to be presented. “Have you never seen the way he looks at you? He never even looked at Mary that way. All he wanted was you. All he's ever wanted was you.”
“I uh..” he trailed off, fidgeting with the tablecloth. “John. John Watson. John Hamish Watson--”
“When I was... you know... out. Sometimes I could hear things. At least I think I could hear things. Might have been dreaming,” John replied.
Sherlock sat in his chair, fingers steepled beneath his chin. He was nervous. Very nervous. At any moment, John Watson would arrive with something life-changing. Each time the floor creaked, or a branch tapped the window, his eyes would dart to the doorway only to find it empty.
“I love you. Very much. Very, very much. So much so that I'd want to.. if you wanted to.. I'd like to--” Sherlock cut himself off and took in a deep breath. “Will you--”
Sherlock stared at the child, taking in what he could. Blonde scratches of hair covered her head, and although he couldn't see her eyes, he knew they were blue. Her delicate nose was John's and her lips were Mary's.
“You've had time to mourn, now it's time to move on. Leave him be. It's not as though he'll get better.”
Sherlock went from the bathroom to the bedroom.
“John.”
“In a way.” Sherlock had crashed through a window, keeping up with typical theatrics while on a case, chasing down the suspect. Luckily for him, the window wasn't overly high off the ground, so he didn't suffer a big fall. Most of the damage came from the shards of glass that were still left in the windowsill.
John tried to move, but it felt like his blanket was made of lead. Even moving his fingers took effort and keeping his eyes opened started to feel impossible. So he closed his eyes, just for a second.
“Fine.”
Sherlock started to struggle against her, tossing his head from side to side, trying to loosen her grip. But she held on, intent on finishing what she had started.
Sherlock adjusted his wig. “Fine. It's solved.”
Sherlock nodded. Just the way they did it in the movies. “And he will say yes?”
“Where did you find it?”
“Do you think Mary is up to something?”
“I got a text from John,” he explained, pulling out his phone and looking at the message. “I think he's in trouble.”
When the show was over, Lestrade turned the television off. “Goodnight,” he muttered as he made his way to his own room. Sherlock stretched himself out on the sofa, tucking himself in. Lestrade took a final glance at the figure on his sofa before closing the door to his bedroom.
“I don't really think a crime scene's a good place for a baby.”
Sherlock dismissively waved his hand. “A few. Nothing too interesting, but they keep me busy. Keep me out of trouble.”
Okay now I'm officially done school for the year.
“Detective Inspector,” he elder Holmes said as he passed.
“You clench your jaw when you're stressed out.”
John made himself comfortable in his old chair, and Sherlock sat across from him. Sherlock kept his eyes on John, taking in every detail he could. Obviously his marriage wasn't working out – why else would be spend his Friday night drinking? There was tension in his shoulders and he clenched his jaw – something important was on his mind, though Sherlock would have been more open to listening if John wasn't intoxicated.
“I'm here now.”
But it was hard to think when he wasn't in his own flat. Instead of residing in 221b, Sherlock found himself in Lestrade's flat. The DI thought it too dangerous to leave Sherlock alone in his flat and offered him the sofa. But that was as far as Lestrade's use went – he was unable to charge Mary with attempted murder, not when he wasn't there to witness it. And not when any evidence was left over. Of course, he could arrest her on suspicion, but the trail would ultimately set her free.
“Yeah.” John nodded, deciding he'd have to sneak out. One case wouldn't hurt and Mary didn't have to know. “Yeah. I'd love to.”
Edit: I changed the title from Resolution to Bittersweet and Strange. Because I like the song reference and I never liked Resolution as a title but I was too eager to post.
I'm in. SH
“Goodnight.”
John felt suddenly embarrassed to be partially naked and pulled the bedsheets over himself. Sherlock backed away.
“Watson, I need you to focus.” Sherlock stared at the dinner table-turned-lab. Among the mess were a few test tubes and beakers filled with various liquids and a microscope with a burnt out bulb. Papers were scattered dangerously close to the Bunsen burner that glowed a dim flame. Sherlock dramatically whipped around, his dressing gown flowing with his movement as faced his devoted helper.
But Sherlock refused to leave and before he knew it, he was in handcuffs and thrown into the back of the police cruiser. Lestrade had gotten into the driver's seat to drive him off to the station when Sherlock muttered who was responsible for the crime. At first Lestrade thought he was just saying things, but the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. As he drove off, he radioed the other officers and the case was solved by the time he made it to the station. Sherlock had a smug grin on his face and Lestrade stated, “You'd make a good cop.”
John threw himself against Sherlock and knocked him over. Before Sherlock could realize what happened, John had his damp lips against him, kissing every bit of bare skin he could find. Kisses trailed form his lips, cheeks, and neck and that wasn't enough. John started to tug at Sherlock's pajama shirt, trying to pull it over his head while not letting it get tangled in the dressing gown.
A knock at the door interrupted John's viewing experience.
A strange man with thick glasses and auburn hair stood behind the door. “Room service,” he stated. In both hands were plastic bags.
Sherlock eyed the parcel with such apprehension as if scared what was inside would attack him. The parcel in question was a carrier. A baby carrier with a blanket draped over it, allowing the infant to think it was night, and keeping Sherlock from seeing it. Her. It was a her.
She knew to Sherlock, she was background noise to him. And he always spoke kindly to her when he needed to use the lab or her advice, but when she wasn't needed, she went ignored. She never felt she was a friend of Sherlock's, more like a colleague. And now that John was spending his time with Mary, it looked as though Sherlock was asking Molly to be his John for the time being.
John realised that was as much agreement he'd ever get out of Sherlock. “I'll call her tomorrow to see when she can come in.” Sherlock went about pushing the papers off the bed and turned out the light. They were put into complete darkness and only the sound of them moving to find a comfortable position to sleep in was heard. They couldn't see each other, but they had a routine. They were facing each other and Sherlock would always have his hand out on his pillow and John would take it.
Sherlock's glare intensified.
“We're gonna need another dresser for her,” John commented.
Joining Greg for coffee had become a habit. Every Monday they went to the same place and ordered the same drinks: for Greg a black coffee and for John, tea with two sugars.
“What?”
“You sure?” Greg frowned. “Why spend thirty quid on a cab when I can drive you for free?”
Sherlock pulled back for a moment and stared at John. Stared at his red cheeks and lips that had turned pink from kissing them. Stared at his expression of both confusion and surprise. John stared back at him, looked at how messy his curly hair had become. Saw the lopsided smile that was always a treat to see.
John nodded. “She already does. We love her to bits.”
John fell to his knees, then fell forward, collapsing on the damp ground. Sherlock struggled to make his legs move, to rush to John's side. Only a few metres stood between them, but it felt like it took hours to reach him.
“I'm here.”
“Why not have your brother watch your flat? See if anyone comes back?” Lestrade asked as he sat on the sofa with Sherlock, watching television. Sherlock stayed curled up against the arm of the sofa, wrapped in his blanket.
“I just do.”
Over the past few weeks Sherlock had many opportunities to propose. In fact, those opportunities seemed to throw themselves at him. But he never took a single one. At this rate, he'd never propose. "I need to do this. Because, well.. I'm a bit scared. Nervous. Everyone said you'd say yes and marry me. But I need a real answer from you. I need to hear it from you.”
Sherlock watched a thin line of steam emerge from the kettle's spout. Gynaecologist or not, John still had available access to Google.
Sherlock gave a small nod as he closed the door and went back to his seat. Back to his seat in his lonely, empty flat.
“Because you don't have to be.”
“I'm quite fine on my own,” Sherlock said, raising his hand to get John to stop talking. “I can take care of myself, and I don't need anyone. I work best alone.”
“It's not fine, is it?” John sat on the toilet (lid down, of course) while Sherlock sat on the edge of the bathtub, elbows resting on his knees. John had suggested Sherlock remove his shirt but the detective simply rolled up the bloodied and tattered sleeve to better reveal the wound. A long gash trailed down his left arm that was still oozing blood, the skin red and irritated.
John didn't look convinced but he didn't voice his opinions. Instead, he gave Rosie a kiss on the cheek and grabbed her diaper bag. The toys that littered the living room floor went ignored – John didn't bother cleaning them up when he'd only be back later to drop Rosie off again. The flat had become her second home while John was at work. John offered to hire a nanny but Sherlock insisted on looking after Rosie during the week.
It was just like old times: the two of them on an adventure for a case. Only, it wouldn't be much of an adventure. A boring adventure if anything. But Sherlock found in the past months he had been growing apart from John. They both led different lives and finding time to spend together was getting more and more difficult. A boring adventure would do.
Both Sherlock and John were in bed, surrounded by a number of papers. They were carefully going through each babysitter that showed some potential.
“I can't,” John said, pulling away from Sherlock, moving to the other side of the bed. “I'm sorry, but I can't.” Drunk or not, he couldn't do that to his wife. They had pledged themselves to each other and the thought of breaking that just didn't sit right with him. She'd find out, no doubt. She was smart like that. Cheating would ruin their relationship. Probably cause a divorce. And what would that do for poor Eleanor? Eleanor needed her parents together, didn't she?
“Have you considered that John won't wake up?”
“Hmm.”
“Take it easy. No heavy lifting. Try to change the bandages every day. And don't pick at it once it starts to scab over.” John washed his hands, finished with his work.
John began to pack up the first aid kit and stored it under the bathroom sink as Sherlock left the bathroom, hand on his bandages.
Molly invited herself in. In her arms was a bouquet of flowers and a helium balloon with “get well soon” written in bright colours. The hospital room was a bit stuffy and she wondered if opening a window would help. “How's he doing?” she asked as he placed the flowers at John's bedside. The balloon bobbed up against the ceiling.
the bed instead of on a counter in fear he'd knock it over during the night. It was a stupid precaution in Sherlock's mind. Why not just leave it in another room? Why waste time bending over awkwardly to get it?
Sherlock remained silent, but that didn't matter – Greg knew exactly what was bothering Sherlock. A few years ago, he had seen the same thing at John and Mary's wedding. Sherlock was lonely and he was too proud to admit it. And certainly everyone got lonely from time to time, but lonesomeness could mean a relapse with Sherlock. One that he might not recover from without John.
“Why not?”
“So why get married in the first place if it's so pointless?”
John took a few steps into the flat and frowned when he saw the state of the table. It was one accidental bump away from causing an explosion bigger than any grenade could. “You know I don't like you doing those tests when Rosie's here.”
“I'll ask him when he wakes up.”
“Can you... I like it when...” he muttered awkwardly. “Bite harder. Please.”
When the wound was as closed as it could be, John to spiral bandages around Sherlock's arm.
pad thai I've ever had in my life.” The bag with the takeaway boxes were placed on the coffee table.
“So are you gonna ask him when he wakes up?”
Time passed. Sherlock spent ages on Lestrade's sofa and John remained silent. Lestrade seemed more than content to stay idle and “just see where things go” with John, as if expecting John would somehow show up on the doorstep to the flat acting as though he hadn't been missing for the past few weeks.
to be alone!”
“How's the missus?” Greg asked as the previous conversation came to an end. “And little Eleanor?”
Sherlock offered his hand and John awkwardly shook it. “I'll see you around then,” John said with a nod as he gingerly walked down the stairs. Eleanor slept soundly.
Sherlock stood over John's sleeping form. What was taking him so long? Was he thinking about something important? The wait was becoming tedious and as he waited, he began to realise the very real possibility that John would not wake up.
When the two arrived back at the flat, they struggled up the stairs while trying to carry the bags. A few plastic coat hangers started to stick out from the flimsy plastic and one bag ripped open just as they stepped inside.
“John.”
“I need to be with him!”
*classes at least.
“What's this?” John began to sound frustrated, as if he couldn't figure out why Sherlock couldn't magically see the contents of the envelope.
“Yeah?”
Mary wasn't the only thing on John's mind, Sherlock found. John's posture wasn't relaxed – shoulders raised, holding a high amount of tension. John impatiently cleared his throat, waiting for Sherlock to reveal the contents of the envelope and that put the final piece into the puzzle. John hadn't had sex since the conference. Had been avoiding sex, keeping it away from Mary. Their relationship was on the rocks and John had left his home at midnight to seek the detective's help, leaving Mary and Eleanor oblivious and asleep.
Molly sat across from him, curling up in a cat-hair-covered armchair, her legs tucked beneath her. She stared at Sherlock, unsure why he decided to invite himself in. Ever since that phone call, Molly had been distant toward Sherlock and the two had never spent time alone together. John was always there to break the ice or ease tensions.
“I like to think so,” John said with a proud grin.
“I studied childcare in university. I was actually going to start my own daycare, but my mum fell ill and now I don't have the time for it.” That got a sympathetic look from John. Sherlock seemed indifferent about her ill mother. “I'm the only one who can look after my mum, but I still need some sort of a job. And you said looking after little Rosie would be part-time, so I think I can work that into my messy life.”
No. But it's interesting. I promise it's interesting. G.
“Hmm.”
“Like shit,” John replied.
“Meet anyone?”
“I am careful.”
“Yeah,” was Lestrade's response.
“John?”
Sherlock looked up from his book to take in the tired sight of John. Bags under his eyes, a tired frown on his face, messed hair and dishevelled pajamas. Sherlock was tempted to remind John he was perfectly capable to help with Rosie's care, but he knew that'd be turned down.
John's expression had seared itself into Sherlock's memory. The look of confusion, wide eyes, mouth open. And then John's eyes locked onto Sherlock. A pleading look took over. One that was sorry and scared. John's lips moved as he tried to speak, but no sound came out.
John placed his hand over Sherlock's. “Something wrong?” he asked. For the entire ride back from the store, Sherlock seemed a bit distant, just as he did when they were leaving the flat.
John shrugged. “I found it.”
“I'm trying.”
“Is my deduction correct, Mr Holmes?” he asked with a smirk.
“It's obvious.”
“I should get going. Mary's gonna worry,” John said, putting his mug down on the table. The hot liquid sloshed inside, not even half-finished.
“What's this?” John held up a closed envelope. There wasn't a name or address written on it. It was just blank.
“I was going to ask him to marry me.”
“I'll uh... see you tomorrow,” Sherlock said quietly.
“What?”
“I'm sure Marcella's not had many couples in our...situation. Two blokes raising a baby together right after the mother and wife died, and then got together. I...I want her to think we're capable.”
“Sherlock--”
“Hmm.” Sherlock stared out the window.
As he became more alert, he started to take more of the room in: small with two worn chairs at the foot of his bed. The bed was hard and his blankets were scratchy. And in his left hand was an IV line. When John tried to follow the line his eyes stung when he began to look up. So he squeezed his eyes shut, then decided to look at different things. To his other side was a tray holding a plastic cup filled with water. Water? Was he thirsty? No, nauseous if anything. John clenched his jaw, refusing to let himself be sick. Was he going to be sick? The thought of vomiting made his body ache. Then again, the thought of just about anything made his body ache, like he was recovering from some kind of illness and --
Small cut indeed. The thing was a proper gash and John had lectured Sherlock about being careful while on cases and urged him to go to the hospital. But Sherlock refused. Of course he refused. Stubborn thing.
“Come on,” he said, already standing and collecting his coat.
John grabbed onto his cock and began stroking it as he rode Sherlock. The poor detective was all but squirming beneath John and that was a sight John promised himself he'd never forget.
“Stop her!” Mycroft barked. Trying to reason with her wasn't going to work. Obvious.
“Mary? Yeah, she's fine,” John replied as he fished his phone from his pocket and placed it on the table. On display were a number of pictures of Eleanor. In some she was sound asleep, in others she was wide awake, her bright blue eyes shimmering in the light.
The man looked over his shoulder to see his pursuers had caught up to him. In the cold air their breath could be seen in the glow of a streetlight. The taller man took a few tentative steps forward, holding his hand out.
“Us?”
“Yes. Of course. Thank you.” The consulting detective stood to collect the tossed papers that were now scattered on the floor. Sherlock moved absently as he awkwardly stacked the papers on the nearby desk, not even bothering to check if they were in order. “Thank you,” he said again, this time with a nod as he went for the door, the papers forgotten.
John leaned over and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock froze from the sudden contact. “It was weird. Really strange, but...” John drifted off to sleep for a few moments before waking himself again. “It...it was the best night of my life.”
“Please.”
“So how've you been? Apart from getting your arm torn open,” John asked, leaning his elbows against the table.
Sherlock sat on the bed and reached down to pull the laptop out of hiding, then opened its lid. After turning it on, it asked for the password. Sherlock paused. Abigail was the name Lestrade's of his oldest child, but it wasn't accepted as the password. Second child was Daniel, but again, that wasn't accepted.
The next text was the address. Sherlock smiled as he went over the texts, but frowned when he realised Rosie was in his care. Mrs Hudson was out at some hot yoga class. Lestrade was obviously off the table for being a babysitter as he was at the case. Sherlock's thumb hovered over Molly's name in his contacts list, but he didn't select her. Molly was angry with him, and why wouldn't she be? After saying he loved her for a case, she had reason to be angry. Sherlock had of course told her the reasoning for that strange phone call, but every time he had seen her since, she seemed...off in a way. Distant, maybe. She would talk and laugh with John just fine, but whenever Sherlock entered the room, she'd go quiet. It probably wasn't the best to ask her to babysit.
“I need to!”
After a brief explanation of how she died and why she died, John and Mary went to live together with Rosie back in their old flat. John sold the flat when he left it, but Mary was the secret buyer, knowing she'd be able to return soon. The reason for her death was to tie loose ends of her past and faking her death consisted of a rehearsed scene with Vivian using a fake gun and some fake blood.
“She's beautiful, John,” Sherlock said quietly.
Greg sighed. “You can't be serious.”
Sherlock had enough and motioned for John to take the baby. With slow and gentle care, John took her from Sherlock's arms and placed her back into her carrier without waking her. A line of drool was dripping from her open mouth and John wiped it away with her blanket.
John pulled back the slightest. “You don't have to be afraid of me.”
“Come on,” he urged.
“John. John, can you hear me?” Sherlock turned John over to his back, patting his face. “John?”
“Who are you, again?” John asked as he leaned back in his seat, glancing out the large window to see countryside zoom by in a blur.
The monitor was steady. Nurses would come in each day and look at it and take notes. They'd give Sherlock a reassuring smile. Some commented on how lucky John was to have someone who was willing to spend days on end sitting in an uncomfortable chair and living off of the cafeteria food. Sherlock always said nothing to them in return.
Sherlock coughed as he struggled for more air, but it didn't come to him. “Thought an assassin would have a better way at doing it.”
“You do?”
, do you understand? Because a lot of us out there care for you, more than you'd care to realise. I'm here for you.”
John adjusted Rosie in his arms. “I have tomorrow off. How does that sound?”
“I don't know. I haven't asked him yet.” There was an edge to Sherlock's voice but Lestrade ignored it; Sherlock had plenty reason to be upset right now. Then his voice softened: “Do you think he would have said yes?”
“I understand,” Sherlock replied.
“I don't like limiting myself with rules and procedures,” he replied.
Molly's eyes met Sherlock's and she smiled. “It sounds exciting."
“Hm?” John looked up from his tea. The teabag bobbed at the surface and John scooped it out with his spoon.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully.
Sherlock gave a gentle nod.
Lestrade thought he couldn't be more helpful when he offered Sherlock a safe place to stay for the time being. But to him it was hard to believe Mary was up to something. John regularly sent Lestrade texts as he did before and noticed no change when Mary returned. Lestrade wasn't doing to say it to Sherlock's face, but he was fairly certain Sherlock was exaggerating the whole thing. After all, Sherlock had a tenancy to be dramatic and while the attack in his room wasn't an exaggeration (he had marks left on his face from the attacker) Lestrade wasn't entirely sure it was Mary herself. It was dark in the room and Sherlock did have a number of enemies and how would Mary be able to sneak out of her house so early in the morning without rousing suspicion? It didn't add up.
Sherlock squeezed out of his pants, but felt suddenly self-conscious to be dressed in only his underwear in front of John. Sherlock pulled himself under the covers for some shred of privacy. Soon enough he was cocooned under the blankets, stuck between John and the old mattress. When he struggled out of his underwear, he slowly stretched his legs out. It had been ages since he had sex and he wasn't particularly looking forward the to uncomfortable stretch John's cock would give him.
Sherlock kept his scowl focused on the monitor.
