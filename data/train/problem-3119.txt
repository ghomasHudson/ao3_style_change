Cas kissed him once more.  “Good night, Dean.”
Dean nodded.  He felt a tear slip from the corner of his eye.  He turned from Cas, wiping his cheek on his shoulder.  Cas dropped his hand.
Cas watched him with one eye open and the sheet half-wrapped around him. Dean pulled his jeans up, buttoning the fly. “Don’t you have to get back to school?” he asked.
Dean swallowed, hard.
Dean leaned back and looked at Sam, considering his words.  He was ready to argue; he knew how private Cas could be - had been.  But then again, he was also desperate enough to try it.
Out in the crisp night air, Dean paced back and forth, trying to remind himself to breathe.  He didn’t know why he was so goddamn pissed but he almost wished for a fight to break out so that he could hit someone.  He kicked at an empty bottle on the ground and it hit the brick back of the building and shattered.  He turned back to pace away from the glass and nearly ran into Cas.
He stood back for minute so that he could toe off his boots and shake his legs out of the jeans and boxers.  Dean wasted no time in pulling those damn shorts off of Cas, chest heaving at the sight of him fully naked.  He reached into his nightstand, pulling out a half empty bottle of lube and - thank God - one single condom he’d had for he didn’t know how long.  Dean tossed the items next to Cas on the bed and then leaned down to kiss him, lining their cocks up and rutting against Cas.  Both men moaned at that and Cas threaded one hand through Dean’s hair at the back of his neck and the other gripped his hip.
Castiel settled back down next to Dean.  He felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment when he recalled his behavior the previous evening.  He wasn’t sure why Dean had curled up with him last night, but he was not in a mood to question it at that moment.  It had been a long day of rounds and house visits and near the end of the day, he was called in to doctor those hurt in a bar fight.  Castiel sucked in a breath, remembering.  The youth, no more than seventeen, was dead by the time he arrived.  Gut shot, he’d bled out waiting for Castiel.  Not that Castiel could have saved him had he been faster.  But looking at the dead boy’s face and vacant eyes brought up ghosts Castiel thought he’d buried.
Chapter 1: Meet Ugly
“How did Alistair get away?” Cas asked.
“Oops, I did it again?” He said.
“Scoot up and lie down, Dean,” Cas said.
“No,” Dean said, “don’t give me that look.”
The song ended, and Dean immediately recognized the next one. Thank God someone had broken out of the late 90s playlist and put on Sexy Back. He sprang into action, striding toward Cas. He turned toward the girl Cas had been dancing with. Leaning in he said “Mind if I cut in?” gesturing toward Cas. She just shrugged and backed away.
*****
Cas looked up from tying the ends of his dress shirt back into a bow.
Dean made plans with Sam to pick Ben up from the school Halloween party and for him to spend the night with Sam and Jess. Dean would be shot after the 10 hour shift the bar wanted him to put in and it was far enough away from home he thought he’d most likely crash in Baby before driving back to pick Ben up the next day.
“Good, me too,” Dean hissed back and felt his chest heaving like he was gearing up for a fight. “Why are we yelling?” he demanded.
“Fuck, yes,” Dean said and grabbed Cas’s hand, dragging him in the direction of the back door. He thought he saw Gabriel smirk at him on his way out, but he wasn’t sure.
“Alright, alright,” Gabriel choked out. “Ease up there, hoss,” he said, as Dean loosened his arms.
Dean looked at Cas, noticing more about him including the weird black hat he wore and the pie in both of his hands.  “Are you wearing a Pilgrim hat?” he asked.
Dean moaned and didn’t let up the pace. He knew Cas was close when he started swearing.
“But, Sam, maybe you didn’t hear me - I.  Have.  Dynamite,” he reiterated, smiling and wiggling his eyebrows.
“My leg?” Dean asked as the sedative flooded his system.
The Angel turned and showing off delicate gossamer bee wings sewn onto the back of his halter top, he bent completely over, touching his toes. Dean felt his dick stir at the sight. Damn, the guy wasn’t even dancing yet but there was something about the way he moved - like liquid silk. He swooped up into a standing position and removed his beekeeper hat to reveal a black mask and shiny black and gold antenna that caught the light. He peeked over his shoulder and dropped the hat to the ground.
Castiel swung his leg over Dean’s right leg.  He sat back on his heels and stared down at Dean’s cock.  His mouth watered.  He looked back at Dean who was watching him with hooded eyes, his chest heaving.  Castiel reached down and gripped Dean loosely, stroking him from root to tip.  Dean gasped and arched his back, pushing himself further into Castiel’s palm.  Dean grabbed his bicep with his right hand and pulled Castiel down so that he could kiss him.  Castiel released his hold on Dean to catch himself with his hand on Dean’s chest.  Castiel shuddered and gasped as their cocks brushed against one another.  Castiel felt Dean wrap his arm around his hip and squeeze his ass.  He moaned into Dean’s mouth and Dean pumped himself faster against Castiel.  Castiel covered Dean’s mouth with his hand.  “Lick,” he said.  Dean took Castiel’s thumb in his mouth, nipping at the pad before sucking, hollowing his cheeks around it.  Castiel threw his head back, his mind thinking of the other things Dean could do with his sinful mouth.  He released Castiel’s thumb with a pop and began licking broad stripes across his palm.  Castiel gripped them together in his wet palm, squeezing and pulling.
“Ben - I didn’t mean for this to happen,” Dean started.  Ben scoffed. “I don’t know - it was like fate or something kept making our paths cross.  And, and I really, really like Cas, Ben.  And after he moved in with us, well, yeah, I was a goner,” he finished.
“No,” Dean said.
“You’re a good brother, Dean,” Cas said.
And that was it, Dean came like freight train, his vision whiting out.
Dean pulled him back into his arms and shoved his head into the top of Cas’s head, smelling his hair rubbing circles across his back.
“I may have had too much to drink last night,” Cas said.
Dean begins his recovery and vows revenge on Alistair and his crew.
Mr. Novak had added a black windbreaker to his running ensemble, covering up the black and yellow striped tank top, but Dean could still see mud splattered on his track pants.
He leaned in and rubbed his face over Cas’s cock. Cas gasped. Dean mouthed over Cas, tasting and smelling how turned on he was. He gripped Cas’s thigh and moved over to nip and suck a mark there just above one of the thigh highs.
“How can you possibly be hungry?” Castiel asked.  “We ate lunch two hours ago.”
Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law.
Tee hee.
He turned to face Cas and put one booted foot up on the coffee table, hooking his thumbs in the waistband of his pants and thrusting in Cas’s general direction.  Just as the vocalist got to the refrain, Dean unbuckled his shiny rodeo-style buckle and in one smooth motion he’d been practicing, he pulled the belt all the way through the loops and flourished it like a bull whip before tossing it to the side.  Cas sat up straighter and gripped his own knees, knuckles white.
Dean thought.
“You won’t hurt me, Cas.  You saved me.  You saved me twice and a million times over, Cas.  You’re not a monster, Cas - you’re my angel.  I trust you and I forgive you, Cas.  Alan would forgive you too,” Dean answered.  He leaned forward and brushed a hand over Cas’s cheek.  He kissed him, gently.
Castiel flinched at the deadly promise in Sam’s voice.  He knew the Winchester family had history with Alistair’s gang that went beyond Dean’s injuries.  Even though he’d hinted he’d like to hear the full story, however, Dean had not been forthcoming on the details.
“Damn it, Cas, you will listen to me,” he growled.
Gabriel’s voice changed instantly.  “Great!  I’ll tell Cas the good news.  He’ll be over tonight!”
Dean shoved the meat over to the side of his mouth.  “I’m tellin’ ya, Doc - you got a way with cookin.’”
*****
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose...”
, he thought. “It’s good to see you again. You look -” his eyes scanned up and down Dean’s frame “- well.”
Cat Dude rolled his eyes. “Only the most amazing pole dancer you’ve ever seen,” he answered sighing.
“Tonight?” Dean asked but Gabriel had already hung up.
“No,” Cas breathed against his throat.
“Doc Novak saved it.” Sam said.
Cas just stared at him.  Dean sighed.  There really was no reasoning with him when he did that.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck and looked down and did NOT blush like a schoolgirl with a stupid crush.
“What the fuck?” Cas demanded, glaring at him.
Dean looked up and poked Sam in the chest with the business card.
Castiel stiffened and did not return the hug.  The tall man stuck out his hand.
“That obvious?” Dean asked.  He knew Sam knew he liked both men and women, but he still cared about his brother’s opinion.
That's it for this one! I had a great time writing this, thank you all for reading. I think Knight-in-Assless-Chaps! Gabriel will be back in another story.  In the mean time, I'm writing a college AU one-shot where Cas & Dean go to a short skirt party.  *devious laughter*
“I do appreciate what you have done for Ben, but that’s not what Halloween was about, okay?”  Dean cringed inwardly at the pleading note in his voice.  Well shit, all or nothing, he thought.
Jess looked at Dean and Cas, her facial expression an apology. She turned her head back toward them and away from Chelsea and mouthed ‘high school friends.’ “Sorry, guys - um, Cas you can go ahead and fill Dean in.”
“Did I read that wrong?” Dean asked quietly.
Dean plays his hand.  Castiel calls his bluff.
Dean nodded.  “Thanks, Cas.  I’d better get back before I pass out.”
Dean had tried reasoning with Cas.  He tried yelling.  He tried bribing him with unspeakable favors.  When none of that worked, he tried begging.  No matter how much Dean insisted, Castiel refused to carry a gun.
Chapter 1
Castiel prodded the bullet wound and seemed satisfied with what he saw.  He replaced the bloody bandage with a fresh one.  “It’s healing well,” he commented as he wrapped Dean’s shoulder.  “You’re moving it, right?  Every hour or so, you do an arm circle?”
*****
*****
“Fine,” Dean said back and stole the blanket, smirking.
Cas leaned forward and grabbed Dean’s hands, pulling them back to his hips. Dean gripped him so tight he thought he might leave bruises, but then Cas was leaning back, using Dean’s grip as counterbalance. And fuck that angle must have done it for him because now he was howling. Dean’s blood pounded in his ears; he was not going to last.
“He let Sam go,” Dean continued.  “But the minute he had me tied up, he sent one of his goons after Sam to kill him.  Thank God Sam outran him and then managed to get the jump on him.  I almost got my brother killed, Cas.  I swore to protect that kid and I didn’t Cas.  I didn’t.”  Dean didn’t realize he was crying until he felt wetness on his cheeks.
Cas shook his head. “Unfortunately, whoever is helping the judge cover his tracks is doing an excellent job.”
Cas moaned around his tongue and Dean found himself backing Cas into the kitchen counter.  He pulled away from Cas’s mouth to suck and bite at the column of his neck.  Dean bit down gently on a mark he’d made last night and Cas sucked in a gasped breath.  Dean soothed the bite with his lips and tongue and he felt Cas melt against him.
I didn’t know.  Oh God, I didn’t know it was him.  God forgive me.  Alan - forgive me.
“You need to eat, Dean,” Doc said simply, handing over a plate and sitting in the chair next to the cot.  Dean took a fork from him after balancing the plate in his lap, away from his bandaged left arm.
Castiel pushed his shoulder more firmly under Dean’s, helping him take the weight off of his still healing left leg.  He steered him toward the first step.  He locked eyes with Dean.
Dean shook his head. “Nothing, nothing, baby. Just, Goddamn Cas.”
He shifted his weight to his right arm so that he could grip Cas in his left hand.
Cas collapsed with all the grace of a marionette who’s strings had been cut directly onto Dean’s chest.
“So, the case?” Dean asked.
Castiel thrust himself through their joined hands two maybe three more times, arched his back, cried out “Dean” and came, spilling himself over Dean and their hands.
“This,” Dean said, and leaned forward sealing his lips to Castiel’s.
“Thanks Doc.  You saved his life, I know it.”
Castiel rolled his eyes.  He released his hold on Dean’s head and gripped the front of his shirt, pulling him in.  “Are you sure you’re ready for this Dean?” he asked, his voice dropping to its lowest register.  He pushed his hips against Dean’s.  Dean threw back his head and moaned.  Castiel took the opportunity to mouth and suck at the long column of Dean’s neck while he rubbed himself against Dean’s hip.
“Gotta clock out early, man,” Dean said. “Ben’s got into somethin’ at school and I gotta go down for some kinda ‘behavioral check in’ or whatever they’re calling it these days.”
“Cas - Cas!!” Dean called from the examination room he had transformed into his bedroom. “Did you get the pie?” he asked the second Castiel passed through the doorway.
Dean knew he was glaring at Cas but he couldn’t help it.  Why didn’t Cas tell her to stop, he thought.
Three days after their dinner with Sheriff Singer and Sam, Castiel was cleaning his tools and restocking his kit when he heard an unholy crash from the back of the examination room.  Panic rose in his chest when he heard Dean shout.  He rushed from his front office to the back room to find Dean sprawled, face down at the foot of the stairs that led to his apartment. Castiel crouched down and helped Dean roll over.  He didn’t appear to be injured.  Dean sat up quickly and smirked at Castiel.  He held one of Castiel’s journals in his hand.
“Dean.”
Screw it, he thought and got out of bed as quietly as possible.  Wearing only his shirt, Dean snuck out of his room toward Cas’s.  Thank God his room was at the end of the hall across from Dean’s.  Despite his still healing leg, Dean was quiet when he wanted to be.  Years of hunting to help feed himself and Sam and years of tracking down outlaws had taught him that.
Cas blushed.  “Gabriel loves Christmas.”  He lowered his voice and moved closer to Dean.  “I’m working on a new routine.  Although I’m unsure I can pull of the ‘Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer’ costume that Gabriel suggested.”
“I’m going with you,” he said.
“I didn’t say that,” he growled and attacked Cas’s neck.
Dean stood in the open motel doorway in the middle of their last really-I-gotta-go-Cas-goodbye-for-now kiss when an annoying voice interrupted them.
Castiel dropped his hands to let Dean finish unbuttoning his own shirt.  Dean shrugged out of his suspenders and Castiel helped him get out of the sleeves.  Castiel stood before Dean, his heart pounding as the other man drank in the sight of him bared to the waist.
Cas just nodded and drank his coffee.
Castiel stopped the bleeding in the man’s shoulder so he could work on the leg and hopefully save it.  It was a compound fracture - a jagged white fragment of tibia protruded through his calf just below the knee.  Even if he lost the leg this man was lucky, Castiel reasoned.  A few inches higher and he’d have severed the femoral artery and he’d be dead where he fell.
“Mmm?” was all Cas could manage between biting and sucking on Dean’s neck.
“Oh do you?!” Dean demanded, leaning closer, his voice still loud.
“I’m sorry I hurt you, and I know it can never happen,” he offered, quietly, “but I just wanted to tell you that I like you.  You’re smart and stubborn and hot and annoying as hell.”
Gabriel swaggered up to the bar. There was no other the word for the way that guy moved, really, thought Dean.
Dean just looked at Sam.  He felt the blush creep up his cheeks and knew he was making an ‘I’m guilty-as-hell face.’
Cas nodded and pulled the blanket over his lap.  He rubbed a hand over his face and cleared his throat.
Dean glanced at the digital clock on the nightstand. “Shit,” he swore sitting up and jostling Cas in the process. “I gotta get back, babe.”
Dean had no idea what they were talking about, but he watched Jess’s face fall.
“Dean,” Cas said and smiled the tiniest bit.
“That bad, Doc?” Bobby asked during Castiel’s assessment.  Castiel took a deep breath, looked Bobby in the eye and nodded once.
Dean covered his hand with his own.  “I can be quiet,” he said.
“I’d like to see them try,” Dean said flatly.  “C’mon, Cas, for all we know this could be our last night on this earth.”
“What -” Dean said.
Dean didn’t notice the second dancer until she was right up in Cas’s face.  She wore a skin tight bodysuit and thigh-high stiletto boots, both blood red.  Dean had no idea how she could walk let alone dance in those things.  She slid a hand down Cas’s chest and around his back.  As she turned away from the audience to face Cas, Dean noticed the barbed tail hanging from her backside and the red horns sticking out of her long, dark hair.  She moved and it looked like she was pulling Cas up with her hand, his back arched but Dean realized it was really Cas and his incredible, fluid core strength that supported the position.
“Telegram came in for you last night,” he said.  He reached down for an envelope he had set aside.
“Fuck - Cas-” Dean started. He was going to say,
“I’m worried about you, Dean,”  Sam said.  “You seem really distracted lately.  Is everything okay?”
Dean swallowed as Cas just eyed him. He nodded.
*****
“Ah, it was nothing. Oh yeah..that reminds me, we’re already booked at Bottom’s Up! For spring break. I’m thinking cute little lambs, bunnies, chicks, with giant eggs you can pop out of!” He winked.
Earlier that night...
Dean cleared his throat.  “Cas ‘dances’ with Gabriel’s show on the weekends,” he explained putting air quotes around ‘dances.’  “I met him on Halloween at the bar.  Well - I knew him before that, but yeah, um, Cas is ah,” he smiled, “...FLEXIBLE,” he finished.
The man holding Dean grabbed him roughly by the back of his neck, lifting him closer to the house.  He set Dean down and then forcibly turned his head toward his house.
“Cas! Let me go, man,” Dean hissed.  Cas complied, dropping his hand holding the knife and releasing his arms.  “What the hell, Cas?” Dean whispered.
P.S.  There's an epilogue coming that should make you smile.  I feel like the guys deserve it.
The End
Cas smirked at him.  He took a step closer into Dean’s space and lifted his chin to meet Dean’s gaze.  “Anything.”
Castiel opened his mouth to protest.  The man - Dean - was his charge now, his patient, and he would watch over him.  But his hands had started shaking and he knew he needed an hour or two of rest or at least to flee to the privacy of his rooms upstairs before the panic gripped him.  He nodded to Bobby.  “Wake me in three hours,” he said and left the clinic for the stairway at the back of the building.
Dean smiled and let him get a head start before chasing him up the stairs.
“I did it,” Ben said quietly. Dean and Principal Milton both stopped and looked at him.
“Sam!” Dean said.  Or rather, he tried to say.  It came out more like a rasp.  Dean opened his eyes and blinked.  Two concerned faces looked down at him.  He relaxed when he saw Sam’s worried puppy expression but the other face he didn’t know.
Cas closed the journal.  “After that, well - I ran, Dean.  I tried to outrun his ghost and I tried to drown it in whiskey.  I am a Goddamned coward, Dean,” he finished.
Dean sighed. “Sadly, no.”
“Your arm’s getting stronger,” Castiel said.
O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!
Chapter 10:  Busted
Castiel continued the timbre of his voice rising and falling with the verses of the poem until Dean felt as though he were in a hypnotic trance.
Dean sighed. Fourteen was a tough age. Sammy had been pretty awful at that age too, he thought, but Dean had been 18 and too busy chasing girls to dwell on it.
The crowd roared and everyone at the bar turned toward the stage. The stage lights went out and when the spotlight came back up, a figure in full beekeeper gear stood next to the pole. Dean recognized the opening riff from Tom Petty’s ‘Honey bee.’ The figure removed its pants by tearing them off to reveal muscular, shapely legs sticking out of tiny black booty shorts. The man didn’t move to the music, Dean noted. He simply continued to tear off parts of the beekeeper costume - the sleeves, the jacket, the collar, until finally he stood in a black and yellow sequined halter top and the booty shorts with only the beekeeper mask hat and hood on. Somehow it was mesmerizing.
“I hear you, man.” Dean said.
Dean rubbed a hand over his face.  “My Ma and Pa were homesteaders,” he began.  “They moved to Kansas when I was a kid to stake their claim.  Sam was born the next spring.”  Dean met Cas’s eyes and then looked down.  He swallowed past a lump in his throat.  “Everything was fine until the same railroad company that tried to get the homesteaders to the west in the first place decided they wanted our land.”
Dean nodded, his brain finally catching up.
The minute the door was shut and locked, Cas shoved Dean up against the wall of the second-floor bathroom they’d ducked into. He ran his eyes up and down. Dean felt Cas’s gaze like his hands were running over his body. He shivered under the intensity.
Dean turned away from Cas and bent over completely, trying to channel some of the grace Cas employed in his routines.  After shaking his ass, he straightened up quickly, and turning back around pulled at his chaps, tearing them off (thank you Gabriel for the velcro advice) to reveal embarrassingly tiny denim cut-off shorts.  They were ridiculous, he thought; so short the pockets stuck out below the new hemline.  He usually wore them to wash the car, but he be damned if he’d put on a g-string.  He had to draw the line somewhere.
Dean, Cas, Sam and Jess celebrate Christmas. Dean decides to share that he and Cas are seeing each other only to find out the news is less surprising than he expected. Later, he inadvertently helps Cas crack the case against Judge Roman. (Note - I'm taking liberties with how legal things work and with the length of VIN (vehicle identification numbers) but I think Dean, as a mechanic and person who works on cars would recognize the pattern quickly.)
The lobby was warm and inviting, with a couple of comfortable-looking leather couches placed outside of what looked to be the manager’s office. Dean grabbed a handful of hard candy from the bowl by the door, stuffing it into the pocket of his leather jacket.
“Dean-Dean,” Cas was panting while Dean extracted him from the tangled cotton.  “Do you want to do this here?” he asked and then keened when Dean sealed his lips over a nipple, sucking hard and worrying it between his teeth.
“Best idea you ever had, Cas,” he said.
Cas sucked in a breath and his eyes went wide.
A corner of Cas’s lip twitched up in a ghost of a smile. The air was suddenly charged between them, as it had been back at the dance lesson. Dean wet his lips and watched as Cas’s eyes dropped to track the movement.
“That’s not what I said Dean,” his voice was whisper quiet, but his eyes threw daggers.  Dean had a flashback to the first time he saw him.  “I like you, you big, dumb idiot,” he continued, raising his chin.
“Ben, I know you want to help but I got this,” he said. “Your job is to do the best you can at school so you can go to college like your Uncle Sam.”
Dean turned to look at Cas. “What the hell, man?” he asked. Cas just tilted his head and looked at him. “Where did you even come from?”
Two nights later, Dean readied himself for the difficult task of trying to break through to Cas.  When Cas screamed during his nightmares, Dean gently shook him awake.  Their eyes met and Dean said simply, “I know, Cas.”  Cas recoiled in shock, his eyes wide, his mouth gaping.
“No,” Dean said, and it came out harsher than he meant it to. “You are a good man, Cas, anyone who can’t see that is an idiot.”
Sam peered even closer at his face.  “Oh damn, did I break your nose?”
Dean shook his head. “No, no, of course not.”
“Yes,” Gabriel said.  “For my buns.  I do so enjoy sticky buns, and so does my brother, right Cas? You’re a big fan of bees too, aren’t you?”  Dean choked on his beer.  Ben smacked him on the back and Cas looked at him with a mixture of concern and wide-eyed panic.
The lights went down and then the spotlight illuminated Cas who stood with his back to the crowd, displaying the enormous white and gold wings that graced his costume.  Dean sucked in a breath.  They were huge and beautiful, at least six feet long from arc to tip - and as Dean watched they flexed and extended to the side.  Cas turned his head to the side, showing off his profile.  The opening lyrics of Bryce Fox’s “Horns” blasted out of the speakers as Cas wrapped the wings around himself and turned, prancing toward the pole in the center of the stage.  Dean swallowed, hard.
Cas stood and glared at Dean.
“Doc?” called Sheriff Singer, “you here?”
“Dean - DEAN!” Bobby was saying.
“Dean-” Cas said.
“Goddamn,” Dean swore.
Cas looked at Dean.  “I had no idea you were so...resourceful.”
Cas just stared at him, head tilted to the side.
Warning for smut and mention of violent injury.  These two jerks were supposed to wait to do this, but they just couldn't.  Seriously, they are very naughty.
“Goddammit, Cas,” Dean swore and thrust harder and faster into Castiel.  He felt his cock valiantly try to rise when Dean nudged his prostate.  He flexed his legs and dug his nails into Dean’s back.  Dean rode him hard, his rhythm shot to hell.  Castiel watched his face as Dean held his breath and screwed his eyes shut.  He concentrated on squeezing Dean’s cock.  That was all it took and Dean was coming, swearing and cursing in his bliss.
He hesitated, breathing through his mouth again and squeezing his eyes shut.  Cas felt so goddamn good.
“Durango?!” Dean yelled.  He started to stand up and dust the pie crumbs off his chest.  Dean hoisted himself onto his crutches.  “I’m ready.  Let’s go.”
*****
“What did you say, Cas?” Dean asked, nose buried in his hair.
“Dean - you eyeballed him all through dinner and he blushed every time you looked at him,” Sam said, smiling.
“I had a bad dream,” Dean said.
Dean smiled and slapped Cas roughly on the back.  “Good thing we have this brilliant strategic mind on our side!” He watched a blush creep up Cas’s cheeks and he knew from experience that same blush ran down his chest.  Dean shifted in his seat, now was not the time, Winchester, he chided himself.
“You should show me some respect,” he said.
Cas moaned as Dean thrust in and pulled out, varying his depth and speed until he found Cas’s prostate.
Dean swallowed, hard.
“Okay, fine.” Dean said quickly.  This was a terrible idea.  “Fine.”
“Go on then.”
“That - that could work,” Sam said, looking up from the map.
“If you two are done,” he glowered at Dean,”we’ll get this thing started.”
“Thanks,” Dean mentioned to Novak’s back.
She disappeared back behind the corner and Dean smiled to himself as he turned and walked over to the door. Still got it, he thought.
A week later they returned to Dodge City.  Sam and Bobby had brought Alistair and his men - both living and dead, in for their bounties.  Dean took over caring for Cas full-time.  It was exhausting.  The doctor he’d sought out at Fort Garland pronounced Cas ‘catatonic’ but otherwise in good health.  Dean snorted at the memory.  ‘Otherwise in good health,’ so that’s how you describe a man who’s a former shell of himself, a man whose mind has vacated the premises but his body refuses to die, Dean thought.
Cas pushed his ass back more firmly against Dean and tilted his head back to say, “You love it.”
God it felt good.  Cas shaking and gasping in his arms, grinding against him.
“Sam.  We talked about this.  I got it,” Dean said.

“Really, Dean?” Cas said.  It was amazing he could work a deadpan into a whispered sentence.  “The ‘last night on earth’ line?  Besides, that’s true of every night.”
Of course, Castiel thought.  They’d gotten so lost in each other he’d forgotten Dean’s leg was still healing and he couldn’t bear weight on it for long.
He couldn’t sleep without Cas by his side, he realized.  Dean had grown used to the way Cas wrapped himself around him, burrowing into his chest so that Dean could fall asleep to the sound of his breathing evening out, Cas’s scent thick in his nostrils.  They’d been so tired on the road they hadn’t managed more than a touch here and there, falling asleep the instant their heads hit the bedroll.
Nodding, Castiel tugs at a loose thread on the cuff of his hooded maroon sweatshirt. He’s been thinking as much since they climbed into the car, because as close as he and Dean were, as important as Dean is to him, and as much as Dean may have asked the police about him, he’s not family. Not in the way that counts to any kind of authority.
“I looked it up after we got back. That’s how close you were. Three hundred seventy-nine miles,” Dean sighs again. Castiel can picture how he must look. The minute shake of his head. The stubborn crease between his eyebrows. “I’ve driven further for a football game, and I really don’t care that much about football.”
Glancing around the foyer, he notices a table along the front wall that holds a hot water urn and an assortment of instant coffee and creamer cups. He gestures toward it as he hands over a credit card. “May I?”
“I could watch over you,” he offers eventually, hating himself for taking the easy way out even as he says it, and waiting for the inevitable refusal. Dean exhales as he slowly pulls his hand away and shifts his gaze back to the glowing embers.
“We’ll figure it out,” she tells him, then pulls back a little to catch his eye. “Can you give me five minutes?”
“Nowhere. Just outside. I didn’t want to…” Castiel trails off, the end of the sentence doomed to drag them into the woods no matter how he tries to rearrange it.
Castiel taps the screen a couple of times, and after a few awkward moments of asking back-and-forth whether they can be heard, Mary gets to the reason for her call.
Frowning at him, she takes a step forward and pulls out a record. Glenn Miller.
“So, when you— you meant that—”
“Yeah.”
Reaching out, Castiel fixes his hand to Dean’s shoulder, relieved when Dean leans into the touch.
Running his fingers down the collar, he comes to the unfinished red circle on the breast and chews his lip. The long, loose thread tickles at his thumb.
“You seriously think you mean so little to me? Didn’t I tell you I needed you? That we’re family?”
. Knowing doesn’t help.
“We would’ve figured it out, Cas.”
There’s a hawk perched on the sign. As they draw closer, a peal of thunder rolls over them, and the hawk leaps into the air, wings spread wide. John swerves onto the median as though he’s under attack, the truck fishtailing wildly as he veers onto a nameless side road. South. They’re headed south, now. Dean repeats the direction in his head a few times in the hope that holding on to this one thing, the direction in which they’re driving, will keep him sane until he can find some way to save himself.
Dean visibly bites back the questions about what happened to him, and Castiel doesn’t offer the details — there’s a limit to how many traumatic events a person can deal with mentally at once, after all.
—at a moment when nothing could be done with them. He imagines it with startling clarity, and feels a pang in his chest, aching deep.
Kelly must be terrified.
Castiel gives him a flat look, and Dean shakes his head, swimming close enough to touch.
“Yes,” he says.
He feels the phantom touch of Cas’ fingers inside him, the warmth of his mouth, as though Cas is still touching him everywhere at once.
“What are you doing?”
Dean’s voice rips out of him like thunder, and in one movement he slaps the tumbler out of Sam’s grip and scrambles away, the monitor clip attached to his finger pulling free and pinging back against its metal pole.
Then, it all comes back. Castiel is leaving. Castiel wants to leave.
“It’s been a year, two weeks and three days since I arrived back in Normal,” Castiel says.
“Of course,” Sam shoots him another apologetic look and reaches across the console to pat him on the shoulder. It’s infuriatingly patronizing, and Castiel uses every ounce of his self control to refrain from reminding Sam that he’s a celestial being. “I
Five cars ago, there had been a handgun in the glove compartment. John kept it. They dumped the Malibu in the middle of the night, in a field scattered with white flowers. They stole their next car just after dawn from a trailhead parking lot several miles away, the owners setting off in the opposite direction with hiking packs strapped to their backs.
he wonders. But then his phone buzzes against his hip, and he digs it out to see a message from Rowena.
“Okay,” he says, and presses his lips together, averting his gaze. “Alright. I’ll just—“
Parker swallows, wrapping his arms around his own stomach.
“It’s not a big deal. I just… I’ve been thinking about what I’m gonna do next year, y’know? After graduation.”
“Billie summoned it?”
“Yep. Looks legit.”
“Holy shit, Cas!”
Something that isn’t what he desperately wants it to mean.
“Come here,” Castiel tells him, tugging him up, and Dean does, crawling over him and pressing an open-mouthed kiss to his throat before Castiel redirects him to his lips. Dean’s hips press into him as he shifts his weight, and when Castiel feels his denim-clad erection press against his thigh, he doesn’t hesitate to slide his hand down over Dean’s stomach.
“You said you wanted to be good for me, Dean. Are you going to be good, or will I need to make you work harder for it?”
As they cut through the flat stretch of farmland with the windows down, Dean sings along quietly, and Castiel watches him from the passenger seat.
Outside, the rain gets heavier, and the air is electric with the storm. Dean feels the tremors in his chest again, spreading out to his hands and making his legs feel weak and rubbery. The bones in his wrist that never quite healed right ache and twinge with every erratic pulse of his heart. He looks at the faucet again, and listens to the pouring rain, and tries to convince himself that it’s okay. That maybe if he doesn’t
,” Dean gasps out as Cas slows his movements even more, mouth tilting to one side in an artful smirk that reminds Dean vividly of a night years past, back when Dean had still been able to pass off the low swoop in his stomach whenever Cas was around as a combination of lust and fear in the presence of something powerful and otherworldly. A night outside a cheap motel in Ohio, streetlight glinting in Cas’ eyes as he’d said,
“You know… for millennia, I prayed to God for help and guidance, because it was what I was supposed to do. But he never answered. Not even once. But you—“
Since they’d shipped out, Castiel had opened up to very few of his fellow troops, but Daniel had been good. Kind. A man who simply wanted to help, to be done with this godawful war so he could return home to his twin sister, Adina. When Daniel had learned of some of Castiel’s less commonly accepted qualities, he had promised not to breathe a word. Just clapped him on the shoulder and smiled with warmth.
“I’m glad to be here,” he says.
With a sigh, Castiel signs his name at the bottom of the note and leaves it to rest on top of Sam’s closed laptop so he won’t miss it when he gets home.
“What--” he begins to ask, still tapping an index finger against the screen, and the phone starts blaring music, loud. He drops it on the floor with a clatter.
Nothing.  The screen goes dark.
They’ve been playing some kind of twisted game of cat-and-mouse for months. Every time Castiel has come close enough to catch him, Dean has slipped through the cracks; every time Castiel has let his guard down, Dean has been there, waiting to slash at him with claws that know exactly where to make it hurt.
Cas pressed the keys into his hand.  Dean took the hint and unlocked Baby’s door.  He ushered Cas into the backseat.
“Yes, Dean. I remembered the pie,” Castiel answered, as though Dean would have let him forget it.
“I have money from tutoring,” Ben said. “And Mr. Novak says I can probably raise my rates next quarter.”
“Hey there handsome,” he drawled, smirking at Dean. “Can I get an appletini and honey whiskey? And while you’re at it - add one for yourself - whatever you like. You been bustin’ ass all night, my friend.”
Dean saw Cas’s outline shrug.  “I couldn’t sleep.  I heard someone in the hall.  I assumed someone was coming to rob me.”
“Well the contractor says there’s asbestos in the original material and we’ll have to vacate while they’re removing the stuff.”
Here's what happened after the wedding folks. ;)
“Perhaps it’s best if we don’t say anything,” he said, his voice trailing off at the end of the sentence.
The song ended and Dean and the crowd stood transfixed. The bar was quieter than it had been all night - for three long seconds. Then the crowd burst into uproarious applause. Dean found himself clapping enthusiastically and - damn it - completely tenting his pants.
Before he could decide what to do with that realization, Sam and Jess came back to join them.
“And you’re Cas, Jess’s-”
“Am I - am I fired?” he asked.
“Oh shoot, that’s right.  Sorry Jess, I know - no business on holidays but our court date was moved up to Monday at 9am.”
Cas moaned and squirmed as Dean bypassed his cock to suck and nip at his other thigh. He pulled back and met Cas’s eyes again.
“‘S’okay, man,” Dean said.  “I’ll grab you some sweats.”
“God, you’re beautiful,” he said.
“Hey, I’m just trying to keep you warm, man,” Dean said.  “You got less on than I do.”
Chapter 4:
“March 30, 1863.
“Ugh,” Cas said. “It’s too sweet, but Gabriel insisted, given the costume.”
Cas gasped, the tears spilling from his eyes as he returned the kiss.
Dean was up to three fingers, pumping and scissoring them into Cas, stretching him, when he must have brushed his prostate.  The noise Cas let out was the hottest thing Dean had ever heard and he had to close his eyes and breathe through his mouth to avoid coming.
“I’d be fine with a half bottle of whiskey and some chow,” Dean said.  Sam smiled down at him, tears filling his eyes.
Cas looked down at himself.  “Yes,” he answered.  “Is that not normal?” He made air quotes around the word ‘normal.’
“What is it now, Gabriel?  Something wrong with the Christmas lights?”  Dean had just been over the day before helping string outdoor lights because Gabriel claimed his bursitis was flaring up.
“Oh my God, Dean, no underwear? Fuck.”
“‘C’mere,” he said, beckoning Castiel to join him.  Castiel stood back from Dean and slowly unbuttoned the top of his trousers.  Dean licked his lips as Castiel slid the trousers and shorts from his body, pushing them down over one hip at a time until he stepped out of the material pooled at his feet.
“Kiss me.”
Milton shut his mouth and nodded. He didn’t look happy. “No, of course, Mr. Novak. I’m sure we can work something out,” he said spreading his hands and looking at Dean and Ben.
“Dean?” Cas asked.
Dean heard Sam crying behind him.
Dean closed the book and hung his head.  Alistair was dead, his gang busted up.  Sam was safe.  He had everything he thought he wanted.  Everything except Cas.
“I’m fine, Gabriel, just tired,” Dean lied.
“Did you beat Ash?” Sam asked.
“Fuck,” Dean swore and ran a hand through his hair.
“Try what?” Dean asked, breathless.  How long was Cas going to hold him here?
“We rendezvous with Sam and Bobby at Fort Garland in three days.”
“Cas - let go,” Dean said.  “You can let go; I got you.”
Cas glared back at him.  “Selfish?” he asked, his voice a whisper.
“Staying at a friend’s.” Dean answered.
No sooner had he sat down and shut the door when Cas was on him, in his lap, grinding against him and devouring his mouth.  Fuck, he was gonna cum in his pants if Cas kept this up, he thought.  Cas pulled at his shirt and sucked at his neck.  Dean lifted his arms and let Cas strip the shirt off of him.  Cas ran his hands over Dean’s bare chest, stopping to tease at a nipple.  Dean stifled a gasp.
He gripped Cas’s hip tighter and turned so that his lips were next to Cas’s ear. “Britney? Really, Cas? That outfit is ridiculous,” he growled.
Milton was trying to force Cas to resign rather than fire him. Somehow that would attract less attention and save the school’s reputation from being besmirched by having to fire a teacher; at least that seemed to be Milton’s reasoning. Dean hadn’t known what to do after Milton caught them, but he’d had a moment of insight and called Sam. Sam had picked up Ben and told Dean to look after Cas. He’d talked to Ben briefly this morning, filling him in. They’d decided it was best if Ben stayed home with Sam and Jess.
“Man of Honor,” Cas said, hanging his coat on the hook, and unbuttoning and rolling up the cuffs his white dress shirt. “Nice to meet you.” He extended his hand, and Dean shook it without thinking. Cas’s grip was warm with just the right amount of pressure. He had some nice hands, hands that would look great wrapped around -
Time seemed to slow down.  Castiel felt the man’s pulse.  It was weak and he was cold from blood loss.  He checked the bullet wound.  It had passed straight through, thank God, but needed cleaning and stitches.  Castiel, turned, collected his instruments, a syringe, and started barking orders:  “You-” he said to the tall man, “get his clothes off.  Sheriff - get some water boiling.”  Both men looked at him.  “NOW!” he roared.  Bobby and the tall man bolted into action.
“That sucks,” Dean said, shaking his head.
Dean swallowed.  “Yeah, after supper.”  He paused.  “And after I talk to Sam.”
“Dean,” Cas started, his voice quiet.  “You are a very bad patient,” Dean smirked and Sam and Bobby laughed softly.  “You didn’t follow your doctor’s orders, you challenged everything I did, and worst of all, you did what patients are not supposed to do - YOU healed me.  You loved me when I thought myself unloveable.  You pulled me from the dark depths of my worst nightmare and you stood by me through it all.  You aren’t just a part of my soul, Dean, you are my soul.  I love you.”
Disappointment stabbed through him as the beautiful backside started to turn away from him. But then he looked up to see a bare midriff and a chest wrapped in a cropped white dress shirt, the ends tied in a bow. Dean swallowed. Hard. He knew the owner of that ass. He met Cas’s eyes. For one long second, Dean held his breath as Cas backed it up against one of the sorority girls who was having the time of her life. Goddamn it, thought Dean. Cas knew he had a thing for Britney Spears. A thing he would never, never admit to anyone else. Stupid Cas had got him tipsy and tickled him until he admitted it. And admiring Cas in that get up was leading to a situation that did not go well with wearing a kilt.
“Taking a break,” he yelled in Chuck’s general direction and high-tailed it for the back door.
“Fuck, Dean, if you don’t - unngggh,” Cas’s threat ended in a moan as Dean finally took him into his mouth, sucking down his length slowly and pulling back.  It had been a while since he’d done this, but he’d worked Cas up so much he didn’t seem to notice Dean’s sloppy technique.
“Stop fidgeting,” Sam admonished.
O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!
A familiar beat blared out from the loudspeaker and the crowd let out a united cheer. Ugh, Dean thought to himself, why did it have to be a 90s-themed party? He could deal with the flannel and even the skirts, but he drew the line at ‘The Bomb’ by The Bucketheads.
He’d been a single dad for the better part of ten years, but it still hurt. It still hurt when Ben’s teachers looked at him with a mixture of pity and judgement. He could see the unspoken words in their minds - ‘Poor kid, too bad he lost his mom so young. She’d never let him get away with this/never let this happen.’
*Four Months Later*
“What do you mean?”
“Sam - keep him still.  I’ll prepare the medication,” Whiskey Voice said.  A doctor maybe?  That would explain why he was in so much pain.  He swallowed and tried to speak again.
Warning for violence, language, and what I'll call "diet" smut or "smut light."
“It’s okay.  We’ll just start the year’s most epic game of Charades without you two,” Jess teased.
*****
“Yes,” Dean answered simply.  He pulled Castiel to him with his good arm and steadied himself by holding onto Castiel’s hip with his bad one.  Castiel leaned forward and captured Dean’s lips in a gentle kiss.  They traded kisses and pawed at each others’ clothing.  Dean pulled the tie from around his neck and let it fall to the floor.  Castiel looked down at Dean’s perfect fingers unbuttoning his shirt.  He reached out to start on Dean’s buttons.  He felt more vulnerable now in this room.  He didn’t realize his hands were shaking until he felt Dean pause in kissing him, his hands gentling Castiel’s.  Dean murmured “Shh, shh, Cas, it’s okay.  Let me.”
Cas let out a breath and Dean could feel its warmth on his lips as they leaned toward one another.
Epilogue: January 1st
*****
Sam stepped through the doorway and closed it behind him.
Dean and Cas get (unofficially) married.
Alistair laughed.  “Bring the boy in for a closer view, Hannity.”
Dean felt him start to tighten up around him.
Bobby cleared his throat again.  “Well,” he said, “I reckon that about wraps things up.  By the power vested in me as sheriff of this town - even though it ain’t official, you know, for some bassackwards reason,” he grumbled, “I now pronounce you ‘idjit’ and ‘idjit.’  You may kiss the ‘idjit.’” he concluded.
Dean sighed.  “Alright, fine, but you owe me one.”
“Yes.  For the Union,” Castiel replied daring him to stay something.  There were plenty of ex-confederate soldiers still spoiling for a fight on the frontier.
“Always knew you were a fag, Novak, but I didn’t know you were this stupid,” he spat.
“Alright then,” Bobby replied, got up, handed his mug back to the barkeep, and left.
“It’s okay, son,” Dean said, trying unsuccessfully to keep the tears from spilling down his face.
He checked his reflection in the mirror. He looked tired. He was tired, he thought. Well, that was as good as it was gonna get, he supposed. Dean grabbed his keys from the kitchen table and headed out.
*****
“That long, huh,” Sam’s face was sly as a fox.  “Maybe that’s what’s got you so wound up.”
Dean’s chest heaved and he gasped for breath.  “I’m awake, Cas.  I’m awake.”  Dean grasped Cas’s forearms.  “I’m alright, Cas.”
“Took advantage of the confusion while Sam and Bobby were trying to get to me, I guess.” Dean yawned.  He’d calmed down and was glad he’d finally been able to tell Cas what happened.
“No worries, man,” Dean said, shifting in his seat and draining his whiskey. “Castiel, right?” Dean asked. If he was gonna drink next to the man in his ridiculous bee costume he thought he should know his first name.
Dean nodded.  “And...the other thing - ‘Us’...?” Castiel asked.
“Yeah,” Dean managed.  “Just went down the wrong pipe.”
“Nope got the room for the rest of the night. Took some ‘personal time.’ Gonna enjoy that hot tub and wish my boyfriend was with me.”
“Not my fault your brother weighs as much as an elephant,” said a voice Castiel recognized as Bobby Singer’s.  “Novak?! Doc Novak - you here Doc?” Bobby called.
He lost track of time for a minute. He was vaguely aware of someone pounding on the door and Cas trying to get his attention.
Dean deals with the aftermath of Halloween and ends up attending an awkward family gathering.
“Cas, my leg -” Dean started.  “I think I need to lie down,” he finished, glancing in the direction of Castiel’s bed.
Dean felt his eyes roll up in his head. Dammit, two could play at the ‘I know exactly where to touch you to make you lose your mind game,’ he supposed. Dean leaned in and said “If we don’t get out of here soon, I’m going to fuck you right here.”
“I reset your leg and closed your wounds.  But there’s still a risk of infection,” Novak stated.  “For now, you need rest.  And water.”
"I am right where I am supposed to be," the stranger said. And holy crap, what a voice - it sounded like gravel soaked in whisky.
Dean picks up another shift at Bottoms Up! Cas and Meg perform a dual routine and Dean goes a little crazy with jealousy.
Dean kissed him gently.  “I...might be into that,” he said.
“I’m sorry, Dad,” Ben said between sobs.
Dean shifted slightly and Cas drug his nails down Dean’s back before grabbing his ass in both hands.  Dean hissed at the pleasure-pain.
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas asked, pushing himself up on his elbow.
Then Cas was sinking down onto him, and despite whatever preparation he’d done in the bathroom, he was so goddamn tight. Dean had to grit his teeth to keep himself still. It took all of his willpower and last remaining brain cell not to thrust up into Cas. Cas sighed and planted his hands on Dean’s chest as he sunk down until Dean was fully inside of him. Dean stared at him - his flushed cheeks, long lashes over closed eyes, mouth open and panting and that fucking bowtie - Jesus. Just when Dean thought he couldn’t take it anymore, Cas began to move, slowly working up a rhythm. Cas moaned as he moved over Dean, and opened his eyes to stare directly into Dean’s. He was the sexiest damn thing Dean had ever seen.
Dean shook his head.  “You don’t understand,” he said.  “Alistair is a sadistic bastard.  He finds someone’s weakness and he exploits it.”  He rolled back to look at the ceiling.
“Mr. Novak,” Principal Milton said, “I was just trying to explain to Mr. Winchester what happened with Ben today.”
Two weeks before Christmas Dean found himself back behind the bar at Bottoms Up!, slinging drinks.  Gabriel and Cas were preparing for their holiday burlesque show and he got roped into picking up a shift and giving Cas a ride in the process.  What the hell, he thought.  Gabriel had made a very convincing argument about using the opportunity to save up for Ben’s future.  Dean shook his head and smiled to himself.  He really had no idea how, but it seemed like Gabriel could charm the knickers off a nun.
Dean just nodded and put in their order. He handed one of the whiskey glasses to Cas and motioned for him to follow Dean back to where Sam, Jess, and the rest of the group were sitting. Jess noticed Cas as they got closer, and jumped up.
“We trade sections at semester break when Ben’s elective history class is over.  I won’t be his teacher after Christmas.”
“Looks like I get to use that dynamite after all,” he said, smirking.
“Oh fuck,” he swore when Cas took him fully into his mouth and began sucking, slowly moving his head up and down, alternating between sucking and trailing his tongue around the tip, his eyes locked on Dean’s.  He forced himself to lay there and take it even though his body screamed at him to shove more of his cock into Cas’s mouth.  Cas seemed to sense Dean’s frustration and placed his hands on Dean’s hips, holding him down.  He pulled off and smirked at Dean and then without missing a beat he sucked him down hard and fast.  Dean moaned as he felt himself hit the back of Cas’s throat.
“Ah, Mr. Winchester,” Principal Milton said, eyeballing Dean’s dirty coveralls. “So good of you to join us.” Dean detected more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. He turned from the man to Ben who was slumped over in the chair, not meeting his eyes.
Cas’s entire back arched back and he groaned, muscles seizing up and coming all over Dean’s chest. And that was it, Dean thrust once, twice into Cas’s body and came buried deep.
“For what?” Dean asked.
Dean’s eyes went wide and his nostrils flared, but he didn’t move back from Castiel.
“Ah, I think you might have the wrong room, pal,” he said.
Cas’s eyes widened when he saw the shirt, slashed just enough to reveal a bit of Dean’s collarbone in one spot and the top of his hip in another. Dean felt himself smirk at Cas’s reaction.
“Yes, I’m fine. I’ll just call a cab.”
Dean cleared his throat. “No man - it’s -” he started.
“That song was terrible, but I’d like to try it,” Cas growled.
“What if they heard us just now?” Cas asked.  “You know what they’d do to us.”
Castiel stood and titled his head to the side in an expression Dean was coming to know as the doctor’s ‘considering expression.’  “We need to start your rehabilitation and you need to heal enough to use the crutches; you know that,” he added.
“I could -” Castiel started.  Dean watched him swallow and shuffle his weight from foot to foot.  “I could read to you.  After therapy.  If you like.”  He looked down as if afraid of Dean’s rejection.
“Cas - need you to come, baby,” he moaned.  “Not gonna last, Cas - fuck -”
“That’s right!” Ben said.  “He’s taught me more history in two months than most teachers cover in a year.”
Dean inhaled.  “I’m scared, Cas,” he said quietly.
“Yeah, Cas - ‘us.’  This means more to me than just healin’, if you know what I mean.”
Dean tossed and turned in his small bed.  He should be sleeping.  They had a few more long days of riding before they were ready to enact Cas’s plan.  Plus they had to recruit a few deputies or bounty hunters tomorrow.  He didn’t anticipate that would be a problem, though.  Sam and Bobby had been scouting while waiting for them.
“What?”
Closing the door behind him, Dean crosses the room to stand by Jack and look at the desk. Up close, he sees that what he’d thought was just a rock is actually a fossil; the kind they sell at gift shops outside museums.
me? Fuck you.”
“Is this--” Dean starts. Castiel nods before he can get any further, mirroring Dean’s hand with his own. Dean’s side is firm beneath his palm. His breath tickles over Castiel’s lips.
“They’re here,” he says, voice raw and thick as he peers over the steering wheel toward the dark clouds rolling above them, and Dean’s stomach lurches.
thing. All that bullshit.” He looks up at Castiel. “Can we just skip it?”
The rain on the windshield distorts the road outside, making the headlights of oncoming traffic bend and warp, and John doesn’t slow down or stop ranting until the rain starts to ease. When it does, he pulls into a multi-story parking garage in downtown San Angelo.
“Do you know what this tree provides?” she asks, and he inclines his head.
For a moment, the sight of Dean shirtless and flushed beneath him as he says those words is enough to keep him from figuring out what’s happened. But then he really takes in the sight. Dean. Shirtless.
“I didn’t think about
Even if Castiel does want to spend a little more time out here in the peaceful morning haze, rain or not, he knows Dean is right. If they wait too long, Sam will catch them walking back inside together, and though Dean is an adult and Castiel is several million years beyond even that, he can’t help but feel apprehensive at the notion of being judged. Once the brothers have spoken, Castiel will gladly deal with whatever consequences arise. Until then, he’d rather steer clear of any further confrontations with Sam.
“Hey,” Dean says. His voice reverberates against Castiel’s chest, and Castiel feels himself slipping, all that resolve he had to keep himself separate from the dream just falling away. Because nothing has ever felt as good as this. Nothing has ever felt as safe. “How was the hunt?”
“Not exactly sure where back is, but yeah. Hi.”
Beside him, Sam has his cell phone on speaker, keeping Jerry and Hank in the loop, while Rowena sits primly on the edge of a picnic table, looking for all the world like someone who made a drastically wrong turn on her way to some red carpet event.
“Thank you, Henry,” he says.
“Is that a good idea?”
“All the—“ there’s another pause, and Castiel imagines that Sam is gesturing, searching for words. “Y’know. How you were acting out in the library. Whatever that was with the coffee.”
is—somehow—even worse than the fifth installment in the franchise. He spends the entire hour and a half so bored that he can hardly even enjoy the occasional accidental brush of Dean’s fingers on his as they share snacks between them.
“Awesome,” Dean says again, and with a wink, he grins and slips the jacket off.
“It was entirely for selfish reasons,” Castiel tells him, hoping it will diffuse whatever discomfort Dean is feeling. “I just wanted someone to help carry my things from the car to the campsite.”
“Why not?”
Near Sweetwater, they come across a nasty car accident with a handful of cops directing traffic around the debris. When he sees the flashing lights on their cruisers, Dean feels a bubble of hope forming in his chest, but John doesn’t even flinch at the sight of them. He drives right by, as though he hasn’t done a single thing to warrant police interest.
“Sorry,” Dean says, embarrassed as he lowers the phone. “Just... I want some proof that this is real, y’know? Picture seemed like a good idea.”
“In that case, you should know that I, y’know, want you here,” he says, a little awkward in his admission. “That hasn’t stopped since yesterday. Hell, if anything—”
“You can. I’m yours.”
“That all?”
Years ago, he feared he was losing his capacity for faith, but now he feels certain that it was simply shifting into this. Growing. Blooming. Becoming.
“Let me,” he says.
But then he remembers the way Dean’s been smiling at Benny, and that this downward spiraling mood had only seemed to start after Benny declined to hang out later tonight, and his heart sinks again.
Dean knows, without a doubt, that he’s not going to be as lucky as Garth. His wrist has already been broken for hours, but he’ll be lucky if he can convince John to stop driving for long enough for Dean to make a splint for himself. Again, he tries to wriggle his fingers, and manages to shift his thumb a few millimetres. It’s all he can manage, now. A part of him thinks that it might be all he’s ever going to manage.
Not a pawn, or a tool, or a weapon in some Heavenly arsenal, but just himself. Just Castiel. An angel of the earth, on wheels instead of wings. An angel who stopped seeking revelation in God when he found it in the man to his right. An angel who has fallen in every way but the proverbial, because he didn’t so much fall in love as grow into it.
“Did you know about me?”
“Oh. Um. Okay. What’s up?”
When he gets back to the car, Dean is sitting in the passenger seat, feet resting on the asphalt. Castiel lifts his brow as he comes to a stop in front of him.
Sam calls him, but he’s distracted, and he ends the call without really saying anything at all. Crouching behind a headstone at the edge of Hell, Dean stares down at the crumbling earth and tries to keep it together.
“Bartłomiej,” the man says, and looks at Castiel in question.
“You have any other siblings?”
“Are you ready to go?” he asks, crossing his arms tightly over his chest, and Dean looks back at him with a hunted look on his face.
The lions are all dozing when they get there, sprawled on their backs and sides like oversized house cats.
“Just checking in.”
“Aren’t you coming in?”
And then it’s all over. Just like that, Dean is back on the floor, on his hands and knees, helpless.
“Are you coming?” he asks.
A cracked porcelain sink lays in the dirt to one side of the building, along with some rusted out paint cans and a few weathered two-by-fours pinning down a dusty plastic sheet, and—there—sticking out of the weeds, a wooden ladder with a few missing rungs.
Glass shatters, loud, and then fire bursts outward. Flickering orange.
“No,” he lies, and frowns harder when several amused responses come through in rapid succession.
It’s tempting, but Dean shakes his head on principle.
This time, he was standing right in front of him, and Castiel wasn’t prepared for the viscerally wrong feeling that swept over him. For a moment, he stands frozen. Stares at the empty air that Dean left behind.
“That’s a third of a year,” Dean says. Castiel is oddly gratified to hear that he seems disappointed by the thought.
When Dean sees him looking, Castiel just grins and spreads his hands wide as though he was checking for fish.
Benny clears his throat and points toward a door to his right.
Castiel sighs and rubs at his eyes.
“Damn thing didn’t look so mossy from the end,” he mutters.
Their room key is a thin plastic card—weird for one of these tiny, middle-of-nowhere places, Dean remarks—and Castiel watches him flip it between his fingers as they approach the far end of the building. It’s a noticeably nervous gesture, and he fumbles it at the door. Castiel picks it up and opens their room easily, holding the keycard out for Dean when they step inside.
That, and he just plain enjoys dressing up from time to time. Sue him. He looks good.
“Of course.”
He pushes twigs and dirt and half-rotten leaves out through the hole, and the motion pulls at the cuts on his arm. Everything hurts.
Silently, Dean follows John down the ladder into the mildewy laundry of the empty house, then out into the overgrown backyard. It’s still early afternoon, and it’s not until he steps into the sun that Dean realizes how long it’s been since he last spent any time outdoors before nightfall. It’s been a month, he thinks. Maybe a little more. Last time, there had still been Halloween decorations in people’s front yards, and he knows it’s getting close to Christmas by now—he’s seen a few cars go by with trees strapped to their roofs, and the weather has been getting more frigid with every passing day.
That night, as he undresses for bed, he pulls open the less-used side of his closet, just to check. His flight jacket is there where it should be, hanging just as he left it.
is the locker room before every wrestling meet, where he’d tunelessly shout the lyrics with Benny and Cesar and the rest of the guys from the team as they psyched each other up for their fights.
Mostly, they’re too jagged to skim, but a few skip across the surface several times before sinking. By the time he’s thrown them all, the drizzle has eased off, and the clouds have dispersed, giving way to a star-filled sky. Behind him, Dean has switched to playing
He’d said it again, and again, and again as time slipped around them like smoke.
Dressed in nothing but a pair of pajama pants, he looks soft and sleep-warm. Dean is powerless to stop himself from going to him. His hands find Castiel’s hips, sliding his palms up his sides as he pulls him close and presses his face against his throat.
“Chutes ready,” he shouts over the interphone. “We’re bailing out!”
Ruqayya looks down at him with genuine pity.
“How’s your stomach?” he asks, and Castiel frowns, unsure what he’s even talking about until Dean lifts his brow, and—of course. His wound. The lance. He’d completely forgotten about it.
“Say it again.”
“You came back,” Castiel says when his voice starts working, and Dean squeezes him a little tighter.
Dean winks, clearly making some joke, and Castiel squints until he figures out what he’s implying. He raises his brow.
” Jo’s saying now, the line crackling a little as she speaks.
Dean flicks on the gas stove, igniting one of the burners, and his voice shifts again—definitely turning away, now.
“Tell me what you want,” Dean says, and Cas just runs his hands up and down his back.
“I prefer to take my time,” Castiel yells back, and shuffles half a step forward, trying to ignore the slimy sensation of underwater leaves dragging against his ankles.
“I’d like to try something,” Cas says.
“Don’t be. You were a beacon for me, too,” he smiles, and kisses Dean when he shakily returns it.
He’s about Dean’s height, and his dark hair looks damp where it meets his neck, curled slightly from a recent shower. Something is boiling on the stove. As Dean looks at him in confusion, the guy pulls open the pale green door of what looks like a mint condition vintage fridge and slaps a thin steak down into a waiting skillet. It sizzles.
Eileen shrugged her shoulders and said, “I had a bowl of cornflakes this morning.”
She tapped her on the forehead and Meg sighed as the pain alleviated and the swelling on her nose disappeared. “You’re lucky you’re cute.”
Charlie radiated an eagerness to help, which endeared Missouri to her. Given what Gabriel, Castiel, and Meg had told her about angels, it was hard to believe that the girl actually was one.
“Cas, man, I’m really sorry.”
“Really?” he deadpanned. “I feel sorry for her.”
Meg tapped her foot impatiently and stared down at the ground. Part of her wanted to flip Charlie off and stomp away, but a greater part of her wanted to believe her. Every word she said thawed some of the ice around her heart and she sounded so sincere that it made Meg become undone. And she did like Charlie. She liked her weird nerdy ways and the way she could righteously kick ass. But sharing her heart with somebody was a lot more intimate than just sleeping with them and she couldn’t do that just yet.
Instead, she unfolded her arms and held a finger. “One date.”
In response, Castiel leaned forward and kissed him.
Suddenly bashful, Castiel looked down and smiled. “All right.”
“What the hell’s going on in here?” Dean asked as he and Castiel came running into the kitchen.
“Is he still hungry?” Castiel asked.
“I just thought they hadn’t brushed their teeth!”
Gabriel snapped his fingers. “Yes, that. Thanks, Meg.”
Charlie avoided her eyes and opened the silverware drawer. She took the remaining forks and knives and put them away. “Maybe.”
“Yeah you do,” Dean replied with a smile and motioned for Sam to add a little more. “Hey, Charlie, can you pass the mac and cheese?”
A deep red flush spread across Dean’s cheeks and he gulped audibly. “What, uh, what brought this on?”
Castiel felt a touch of annoyance, but then everybody did start to clap and they all sounded sincere in their praises that he smiled and chuckled softly. “Well, you’re all welcome.”
“You’re one weird angel, you know that?” Meg said as Charlie heaved the contents of the trash can into one of the bins.
“Hey, boy!” Dean exclaimed happily and bent down to give the dog a hug. “You’re still looking for food?”
“What are you all doing?” he asked and set the beer on the floor. “I thought I was late but the turkey’s still in the pan and there’s a big gravy stain on the floor and you three—” He gestured at the disheveled looking Sam, Gabriel, and Charlie. “—look like you’ve been caught in a hurricane.”
“Hey, going somewhere?” he asked.
Charlie closed the drawer and turned to Meg. “I like you because you’re funny.”
“He knows how to google. He could’ve figured out. Now go!” Charlie grabbed Dean by the shoulders and pushed him in Castiel’s direction. Though perhaps she used a little too much force because he ended bumping into Castiel’s back, which caused Castiel to drop the saucepan he’d been scouring. It landed with a big splash in the soapy water, drenching the front of Castiel’s shirt, and the kitchen fell silent.
Charlie nearly dropped the plates and choked on her spit. Cursing the stupid human functions of the vessel she was in, she pressed her arm to her mouth and coughed. Then she took a deep breath and calmly put the dishes away.
“Pie time!” Dean exclaimed suddenly and stood up to cut the pies. “Which one did you make, Cas?”
“No, I mean . . .” He trailed off, wracking his brain for the best way to bring up a sensitive topic, but it seemed best to be as clear and direct as possible. So he held Dean’s gaze steadily and asked, “Do you want a sexual relationship with me?”
“Yes,” Castiel said just as Miracle let out a happy bark.
Charlie’s mouth dropped open, but before she could say anything, Gabriel passed by and playfully mussed up her hair.
“A little bit,” Sam admitted as he slowly slipped his hands around her waist.
“Eileen, honey, take a dish to the dining room and leave the mess to me.”
Dean sounded confused, as he should be since their business was all done in his room. There was no need for them to be there anymore, especially since he still hadn’t finished washing the dishes and there was still a lot that needed to be done to prepare for Thanksgiving dinner. But there was something he’d had on his mind for a very long time and Meg’s comments had brought those thoughts to the forefront of his mind.
“I don’t remember ever getting drunk enough to blab stuff to Charlie.”
So instead, she just shook her head and said, “Nah, it’s nothing.”
“Good for you, Charlie!” he said cheerfully and picked up a large casserole dish. “See, I told you she’d like you back. Just be good to my honorary little sis, okay?”
“Sam, I swear, if you don’t—Oh.” Dean looked up, his expression going from irritated to confused before settling on friendly and welcoming. “Hey, welcome to turkey at the bunker! Why don’t you guys go, uh, have a seat somewhere and we’ll start serving stuff as soon as it’s ready.”
The angel held out her hand for Missouri to take and the old psychic clasped it warmly between two hands. “Missouri Mosley. Thank you for watching out for my girl and my boys.”
Dean smiled. “You always look all right, Cas.”
“That was weird,” Eileen said with a quizzically frown. “Did you know?”
Gabriel looked down at the garbage bin, placed it outside the room, and took the beer. “I was taking it to the kitchen, but Meg and Charlie looked a little . . . Busy, if you know what mean.” He popped open the tab and took a long drink, then settled down in the chair. “So what are we watching?”
Castiel dutifully rolled up his sleeves and started washing the dishes while Missouri joined Eileen and Sam in placing the finished food in some nice dishes Eileen had brought for the occasion. Meanwhile, Charlie sidled up to Dean and playfully bumped his hip with hers.
“And now Dean’s got Cas,” Charlie continued, her voice wistful. “And I like Cas too, but I just can’t help feeling a little left out. Of course, Dean isn’t as proactive around Cas as Sam is with Eileen. He’s almost shy, which is freaking hilarious because he was such a flirt around him before things started getting too serious. But it makes me wonder how long they’ll need me and will they reach a point where they don’t want me around.”
“No, I don’t have anything else that I need cleared up.”
Missouri touched her arm and, after a few moments, said, “Not unless you were thinking about rainbows. Go on and take that gravy to the dining room now.”
“Usually ‘cause they think they’re hot and wanna bang.”
Charlie laughed softly. “Not sure about everyone else, but I do. I’ve known Sam and Dean for a really long time now. They’re more like my brothers than all the angels in heaven, which is kind of a problem. We’re not supposed to get too attached to our charges, but I can’t help it. It was just us three for the longest time and then came Eileen. Don’t get me wrong, I really like her and Sam definitely likes her. He’s trying to learn sign language for her and gets super flustered when Eileen tells him he’s making good progress Doesn’t that sound sweet?”
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. And if you feel like I’m pushing you to do something that you’re uncomfortable with, tell me and I’ll stop.” He rubbed the back of his neck nervously and briefly looked down, then back up. “Did I do something to make you think that sex is all I want from you?”
“You need vegetables,” Castiel said as he took Dean’s plate and served him a heaping portion of green beans.
“Uh, those pies you brought?” Dean offered with a low chuckle.
“You need to poke it,” Eileen explained and pulled her phone out of her back pocket. She pulled up the turkey recipe and bent down to show Sam the directions.
Sam handed her the salad bowl and Eileen helped herself to more salad. Castiel, noticing the lack of greens on Dean’s plate, motioned for Charlie to pass him the green beans.
“I’ll go on one date with you,” she repeated and her heart warmed at the sight of Charlie grinning like all her Christmases had come at once. “A normal date. Just you and me and a movie. Okay?”
Dean exhaled and clapped his hands. “Okay. Anything else you wanna clear up or do you wanna go see if everything’s ready to eat?”
Once they were in Lebanon and out of heavy traffic, Meg’s mood vastly improved. She was actually looking forward to this visit since she’d only ever been to the bunker to look through dusty old books. Plus, she was genuinely happy for Castiel to have an opportunity to hang out with Dean the way a normal couple would. Okay, so the fact that they were going to be hanging out with four hunters and an angel in an underground bunker built by a secret society back in the fifties wasn’t so normal, but it was definitely normal for them.
Charlie smiled. “Yeah? Why do you say that?”
“Real mature, Meg,” Gabriel retorted and flicked a pea back at her.
“I know perfectly well what it means, but I’m not having casual sex with Dean, so he isn’t my booty call.”
Confused, Gabriel stared down at the empty garbage bin in his hands. “Cas, I really don’t want to carry this around all day.”
Once everyone had been served and the pie dishes were empty, Dean took his own plate back to his seat and started eating. “Hey, these are great!”
“So what do you want from me?” Meg asked and leaned closer to Charlie. “You wanna see how humans get down and dirty? ’Cause I can show you that, but if you’re looking for somebody to hold your hand and drink milkshakes with you, you’ve got the wrong girl.”
Gabriel shrugged and decided there were worse things than watching a boring reality show with Missouri and Bobby. A night with no hunting weird monsters and eating a normal Thanksgiving dinner was a true miracle. He didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but that didn’t matter. For tonight, for this moment, his family was safe and content and the thought made him so happy that he offered a prayer of thanks to whatever god had allowed them to enjoy a peaceful Thanksgiving.
Gabriel grabbed his heart as though he’d been mortally wounded and gasped dramatically “Missouri, did you hear what he said about me?”
“Oh, you’re Missouri! It’s nice to finally meet you. Meg talks about you a lot. All good things, I swear.”
“But you’re an angel. Dean can’t actually do anything to you.”
Charlie had, in fact, forgotten that and whirled around to find Meg glaring at her with a hand over her nose. “Uh, oops? Wait, I can fix that!”
“Yeah, I know, but I still don’t want him mad at me. And I really didn’t mean to push him so hard.” Sighing, she leaned against the concrete wall and stared up at the gray sky. The forecast had predicted rain, but Charlie knew that the weatherman had been wrong again. Judging by the amount of precipitation and the shape of the clouds, it wouldn’t rain until tomorrow evening. “I just wanted him to talk to Cas. I think he’s been feeling a little left out since Eileen moved in. That’s the real reason he interfered with the turkey instead of, you know, doing something normal like calling you guys up and telling you to come sooner. He’s so used to having Sam to himself that he’s having trouble sharing him. And . . . I’m a little jealous too.”
Gabriel whistled and cupped his hands around his mouth. “Thanks, Cas! Thanks, Meg! Can we get a round of applause for their hard work?”
Dean opened the door and held it open for Castiel. Castiel stepped out, then quickly poked his head back in and said, “Gabriel, stay out of the kitchen.”
Frustrated, Sam ran a hand through his hair, took a deep breath, and tried again.
“Ow! Damn it, Charlie,“ Meg cursed. “You know running into you is like running into a stone wall, right?”
“Give me some of that pumpkin pie,” Bobby added.
“Oh, right.” Gabriel turned around, saw that the car in front of him had moved exactly one inch, and turned back around to stare at Meg with his best “concerned big brother” face. “Hey, you know Cas just worries about you, right?”
“Wait, did you make out with them before or after you found out they were ghouls?” Dean asked through a mouthful of turkey.
Bobby nodded at a free chair and held out a beer for him to take. “Do I want to know why you’re carrying around a garbage can?”
Miracle saw that they were leaving with dishes of food and followed them out of the kitchen. Missouri stared meaningfully at Meg and said, “Whatever you do, however you feel, you be nice to that girl, you hear me?”
Charlie walked over to the stove and turned down the heat on one of the burners. “And that’ll be in another half hour. Maybe.”
Out of all the things she expected Charlie to say, “funny” would have never crossed her mind. Meg half-expected her to laugh and say she was joking, but Charlie was gazing at her so intently and without a shred of humor that Meg found her face growing warm.
Gabriel turned around again and drove forward a foot before hitting a standstill again. This time, he glanced at Castiel and asked, “Do we need to stop at a drug store?”
Sam rubbed his full belly and laughed. “I have some ideas, but uh . . . Maybe a little later we can . . . You know . . .?”
“I really don’t need more,” Castiel protested.
“Oh, so that’s why I haven’t heard about your sex life,” Meg said with a wicked grin. “You don’t have one.”
