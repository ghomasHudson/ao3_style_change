Next to Tony, Iron Man lost some of his tension at the arrival of the man, but went taut again when Mr. Patriot exclaimed “What are you—Mr.
Stark was glowing now, his hair rising up in a threatening halo, his eyes icy blue. He was floating a few centimetres above the floor.
“Today the Witch’s curse will be fulfilled,” Steve answered. It was only one of the things that was wrong, but undoubtedly the most pressing one.
“This isn't Mr. Stark, he came out of nowhere, I don’t know who he is or why he says he’s Mr. Stark.”
A woman opened after a while. She was stunning: cascading silver hair, eyes the colour of rainy clouds, skin pale, almost pearly. She was maybe a little younger than Steve, her clothes simple yet elegant. She smiled at them curiously.
it had to be a magic scarecrow. Apparently, Steve couldn’t catch a break. Ever since he’d met the Witch, it had been one thing after the other. What next, was the grey dog secretly a bloodthirsty werewolf?
Steve did. After staring fixedly at the flower for several minutes, Jarvis paled considerably, his flames almost white before he was back to not quite his usual red. His voice was hushed as he said:
Staying in his current state was utterly unviable. Thus, he should try to undo the curse, preferably as soon as possible. The problem was, the Witch had told him he wouldn’t be able to talk about it to anyone. He’d have to test that particular assertion at one point, but it was safe to assume that no one save magic users would realise he’d been cursed. So he needed to find one, and hope that they could help him. Unfortunately, there weren’t any licensed magicians or wizards in Brooklyne, he’d have to travel to Ma’Hattan to find any with the ability to undo such a curse. The Witch was powerful, and he’d need someone at least as capable as her to help him.
No, Tony makes sure to have better company. A brainless hot piece of meat or two in his bed, and he's happy. Oh, does he love to be rich and famous. People will literally fall over themselves to get a chance of being his stress-relief for one night. Or morning, he isn't picky.
chance that Tony might be interested in Steve as well. Steve wouldn’t let this opportunity slip through his fingers. He’d lived such an uneventful life, waiting for something to happen, waiting to find someone, and now that that someone was within his grasp, he wouldn’t let go, not without a fight.
Was that a part of his curse, maybe? That he hadn’t just lost his body, but his mind as well? Maybe he was in his bed, and this all was just a dream. It would surely make his life easier.
At first, he thought he was at O’Casta’s place, because all he saw before him was a field of flowers. But after a more thorough look he realised they were somewhere else entirely. There wasn’t any visible water, for one, and no mountains in the distance. Instead, the flower field stretched on indefinitely in one direction, while a sand desert took up the other horizon. They were near the edge of the field, where the flowers were fighting to grow through the grains of sand.
Steve decided that if Stark didn’t want him here, he would have thrown Steve out already, so he could just as well make himself comfortable while he waited for the master of the house to greet him or kill him.
A flash outside of the door illuminated the whole room, waking the dog, reflecting in Tony’s wide eyes.
That was a very cryptic answer. Would it work if Steve thought very hard about it? Did he have to walk somewhere and wait for the stars to come to him? Or would he be transported to the place if he desired it? And what did “in his heart” mean, really? Was it enough to think about it, or did it have to be an unconscious desire as well?
The admission made Steve’s breath short. He had guessed correctly, and he had been almost sure that he’d been right when he’d asked Jarvis but hearing it from the fire demon made it undeniably real.
He’s striding forward and grabbing Steve’s wrist before he knows what he’s doing. There’s a small line of blood that has travelled down Steve’s arm, dividing into rivulets and patterns on Steve’s hand, pooling on the fine membrane between Steve’s thumb and index. As Tony picks the wrist up, the blood drips onto the gauntlet of his armour, crimson blending with crimson. He’s touching Steve, is touching Steve’s blood. The smell is cloying, so close to his nostrils. He wants to drown in it.
“The mermaids, the mandrake, and the wind that would make me honest. I’m a bit unsure about what exactly must happen, but I think that if something close to what is written in the poem happens, the condition will be fulfilled. I’ve already caught a star, so the next one in line is the mermaids. I hope that I need to teach someone to hear the mermaids singing to fulfil the condition, but I think that if I just hear mermaids at all it’ll count, because hearing mermaids is already very rare.”
"I'm not asking you. I brought you here, and whether I let you go back or not is dependent on your collaboration."
Tony just needs to make up his mind about when and how it will happen. He won’t ask Steve out, because there’s still a distant part of him that’s trying to stop this from happening. Steve will have to take the leap, then. But when, and how? He’s most likely thought about it a lot. Is Steve the kind of man who takes people on dates before he kisses them for the first time? Is he the kind of man to buy flowers and ask politely for dinner? Or is he prone to acts of passion? Will he stride into Tony’s workshop (the place where Tony’s at his most powerful), grab his face, and kiss him? Or will he declare his undying love after a close call on a mission?
It didn’t take long before a man entered the garden. He was tall, clad in shining black leather, an impressive cape billowing behind him as he walked. He had a scowl on his face, the lines etched deep in his dark skin. He wore an eyepatch covering a sizable scar.
Jarvis sighed and closed his eyes. He wouldn’t say more, Steve accepted. This was the most he’d ever said in front of Steve, and it must have taken a toll on him, to recount his past.
He shouldn’t be surprised, really. He was a first-born; it was only natural that this series of misfortunes had fallen upon him.
Jarvis’s words only half-appeased Steve. It was good that Tony wasn’t hurt, and that James was rid of the curse, but he didn’t like that Tony had put his health in second place. He shouldn’t be so careless with his body.
His intention was to reach the nearest town on the way to Ma’Hattan before the night, but he noticed his mistake halfway up the hills. He would have made it had he been his normal self, but like this, he walked maybe three times slower. He had to stop regularly to get his breath back, and his legs simply didn’t have the strength to go faster. He sat down, looking over the now distant town and the setting sun. Soon it would be night, and he needed to find wood to make a fire. He’d sleep on the most comfortable rocks he could find. His back ached at the mere thought of it.
Tony and Jarvis fell unconscious at the exact same time, and Steve saw the last piece of the puzzle.
This was our garden, and to honour her memory, I’ve continued to sow flowers every year. She, on the other hand, has claimed this desert as hers, transforming it into the Waste we see now. There aren’t any living creatures in the Waste save for her. She reigns over a dead country, and extends it bit by bit. I’ve tried to warn people about her, I’ve told them to plant flowers and trees and anything that can stop the sand’s progress. Only a few have listened, even fewer have succeeded in growing life.
The guards were obviously no match for the magic users, but Steve had to commend their bravery, even if it was foolish.
He’s right. Where else? He’s right there with Tony, and he’s not leaving anytime soon. Tony’s stuck with him, now.
He hoped it wouldn’t be too big of a problem for Tony. Steve would help him, anyhow, if Tony needed him to. It was the least he could do.
The marks had grown again. The highest one had reached his Adam’s apple, moving in time with Tony’s swallowing. The lowest ones disappeared under the line of the cloth that had pooled around Tony’s hips.
“I mean. You’re obviously great at painting, look at the shield, and I’ve seen some of your drawings lying around, so maybe you could sell some of your artworks next to the supplies, and I could, I don’t know, sell cheap charms on the side, have a little business running?”
you not to clean the bathroom! But you did it, you stubborn man, and you mixed up the jars. I can’t believe it. I worked so hard on this, and now it’s all gone to waste.”
What does he think Tony would even try? Steve has assumed control, and Tony doesn’t want it back. Not that he has ever really been in control since the start of the incursions.
Steve felt that he had uncovered an important part of Tony’s past, and of the contract that bound him to Jarvis. He was one step closer to understanding their bond.
Two weeks later, Steve was comfortable in his role as shop assistant, and people came to him if Stark wasn’t there, assuming that Steve was an apprentice. Steve never corrected them. In a way, it was fun, casting little spells, helping people, playing with magic.
Steve racked his brain, trying to remember what they’d been talking about before they found themselves snuggling on the couch. James had turned back into a man, he’d talked about Natasha, and—
Steve, not even sexually (this is a lie), he needs to get his fangs on Steve, he can’t control himself. He gravitates toward Steve, circling and circling like a shark smelling blood in the water. Because that is precisely what he is. He’s looking, waiting for the smallest opening. At the tiniest hint of a weakness, he’ll be all over Steve. He knows it. He can feel it in his bones, in the stolen blood flowing through his veins.
The shadow is there again, black on black, a glint of yellow in the streetlights. It doesn’t move from where it’s immobile on the other side of the street. There’s nothing to see here, Tony thinks. Just an empty street and a wino on a bench.
The Illuminati are the only ones that even remotely qualify to be part of that exclusive little group. But, well, Tony doesn't want to spend more time than strictly necessary with those gloomy heralds of doom. He can't stand them. Why don't they live a little, instead of agonising over blowing up one planet or two?
Tony and the Witch were fighting in the air, both injured, although Tony was in a far worse state than her. She was in her wasp-like form again, this time as big as Tony. He was mostly human, but his arms had turned into wings, and he had more feathers than bare skin.
He had to contact her in some way and tell her about the situation, before some of the regulars at the shop sent her a concerned telegram or letter that would only serve to worry her. On the other side, she couldn’t know about the curse, because she would surely want to help him, and he didn’t want her to jeopardise her education just for him. Maybe if he told her he’d finally decided to travel the kingdom a little bit, since she always went on about how he needed to see something else than the same three streets.
. It made Steve want to pick one up and look at it, look at the small arms and claws and how they were moving and how they worked. But most of all, he wanted to sit down in the middle of the bric-a-brac and paint it.
A small voice teased at the back of Steve’s mind. It sounded disturbingly like Natasha’s voice. And what was that supposed to mean? Of course Steve would be alright with whoever Stark wanted to bring home. It wasn’t illegal to have some fun.
Steve barely spared a thought for James, who was lying half on top of the table—he would survive, his situation wasn’t urgent—before he ran up the stairs to retrieve his shield. He put on sturdy pants and a leather jacket, both marine blue, before putting on his shoes. He didn’t have the time to help James, he would have to make do on his own.
Stark pulled Steve along, and the black peeled away, revealing gentle hills covered with waist-high grass and wildflowers under a blue sky. The change of scenery was so sudden that it left Steve slightly nauseous. He had to let go of Stark’s hand, putting his hands on his knees and taking deep breaths.
The next day, Steve woke up early, opened the shop, and had the satisfaction of removing the sign about him closing the shop down, and replacing it with one that proudly displayed “OPEN”. He hummed to himself as he went back to the kitchen, confident that it would take some time before any customers came. He had time to eat with Tony.
He’s tasted blood since, stolen from hospitals, bought on the black market. Sucked from a one-night stand’s neck. Licked from an victim’s corpse.
Steve had to visit someone else as well? Stark was lucky that his reason made sense, and that Steve actually was nervous about meeting the King. Maybe this old friend of Stark could tell Steve something about the pact. Or Steve’s curse.
He was right, Steve noticed. Stark would recognise Jarvis’ magic, since it was tied to his own, so Jarvis decided to leave the armour instead of alerting Stark. It made Steve feel warm, that the fire demon went to such lengths to help him. He would have to thank Jarvis thoroughly. And leave before Stark saw him.
Steve couldn’t imagine Jarvis willingly turning Tony evil. But could an external source change that?
It would be bad for business to only have one of them in the shop on their first day open. Steve walked back to the shop, flipped the sign so that it said “CLOSED” and locked the door. The shop wouldn’t disappear, he could always open it tomorrow.
Stark had also refused to give Steve any indication of the prices he made his clients pay, saying that he knew all his clients anyway and that he trusted them to pay him honestly. That had made Steve even more suspicious. He had his own shop, and things just didn’t work like that.
. He couldn’t even stand up, much less leave the castle in this state. Maybe he should take a nap. He could sleep, just for a little while, and then he would travel to Natasha. Just twenty minutes, to get his energy back.
She radiated competence and confidence that slightly intimidated Steve, in that he couldn’t dream of being that confident, especially not in his current state. She had power; it was undeniable. The question was what she would do with it, and if she would hold it over Steve, who was laughably out of his depth.
Tony told Steve to dress in the best clothes he had, which were naturally the clothes that the man himself had given him. Steve ended up picking a light blue shirt and white pants. It was unpretentious and stylish; the blue made the colour of his eyes stand out. When he walked to the kitchen, Stark was waiting for him, looking intently at him.
“Don’t you ever think about others? Don’t you care about the families your conquests leave behind? Or do you just sell them a spell to help with their mourning? How does it feel, to dupe everyone around you? I bet you laugh at them, at the poor people thinking they’re dealing with a respectable magician instead of a vile murderer?”
It couldn’t be—no one knew where fire demons came from, no one had seen any fire demon that wasn’t already bonded to a human. Was it because—
Steve is always so neat. Orderly. Tony thinks it’s the military background. Then again, Tony has rigid routines himself, and he’s never served.
The armour is whole, perfect, strong. A bullet would never pierce it. It’s the pinnacle of human technology, so cutting-edge that it really belongs in the future. It wasn’t fully assembled when the gun was fired.
He's perfectly fine with pretending he knows even more than he does. It's so fun to destabilise his opponents. Show them just how outclassed they are. Really, he doesn't understand why his pathetic former self never did that. Wasn't it boring, to talk to all the passably intelligent people he called his friends?
They followed her inside, Stark complimenting the décor and colours, Steve frowning to himself. Stark had eyes only for Miss O’Casta. Had he forgotten about Natasha already? Maybe it was for the best, because at least then Natasha wouldn’t have to pretend to be interested anymore. But that meant that if Miss O’Casta liked Stark, they would end up together—at least for a short while. And Steve didn’t want to have her in the castle, getting in the way and taking up space. Why, oh why did Stark need to flirt all the time? He was asking her to dinner, Steve noticed, and was glad to hear her reject his offer, albeit politely. It looked like she wasn’t interested after all.
He can’t mean physical distance; they’re practically on top of one another. They’re thousands of miles away. Steve’s on the bottom of the ocean, and Tony is hanging in the sky. It all depends on how you look at things.
“She wanted—she needed someone close to Steve Rogers. But. But she couldn’t get to Natasha, because Shield’s wards protect her. But I wasn’t a part of Shield. I was just a soldier that’d met Natasha and fall—fallen in love with her. When I left again to fight against the Latverians, the Witch caught me and c—cursed me. She has control of my arm. I can’t—if I tried anything, she would—I couldn’t
He shook his head, trying to focus, but the man interpreted the movement as a rejection, and his smile dimmed. “Well then. Until we meet again!” and with those words, he walked away, but instead of touching the cobblestones with his feet, a blue glow formed under them, and with each step, he rose further from the ground, until he disappeared over the roofs into the night, leaving a stunned Steve behind.
, Natasha-voice reminded him. He hadn’t told Tony about his curse, first of all, and even if Tony had known, Steve had still been convinced that it was a secret. He had also kept to himself the fact that he was trying to break the contract between Jarvis and Tony. Not to mention that he hadn’t told Tony that he’d seen him as a child. Or that he’d tried to sneak behind his back in one of his own armours.
What would happen when the contract broke? Jarvis had told Steve that it would free him, but in what sense? Would he be a star again, or would he die? He’d said he would help Steve break his own curse, so he should stay alive, right?
This spell was so different from the ones that Steve had seen before that he was starting to wonder if this wasn’t a joke. Would Stark make that kind of joke? He liked teasing Steve, sure, but this was so different from their usual bickering. Jarvis would know if it was a spell, or something else. Steve showed it to the fire demon, who flickered briefly, turning from blue to an angry red and blue again before Steve could ask what it was about.
He wondered how much time had passed already. His mind wasn’t…it wasn’t working very well. He knew he should be afraid, should be terrified, should be out of his mind with dread. Should try to fight this. There was something, no, someone he needed to get to.
He lived in the small but lively town of Brooklyne with his sister Natasha. They’d never known their father, and their mother had passed away recently, leaving two orphans to tend after themselves and their small shop. After months of grief and trying to make ends meet, they came to the conclusion that one of them had to move out. Naturally, Natasha was the one who would go and take the opportunity to study and become a master in the trade she would choose. Following careful deliberations, they agreed to send Natasha to the prestigious Shield guild to learn witchcraft and martial arts. It was with a heavy heart that Steve bid farewell to his sister, knowing it would be a long time before they saw each other again.
Not twenty metres ahead of him, the Witch of the Waste was speaking with a man, both looking at a map in her hands. She was wearing a black dress this time, but her shape, and the aura that flowed around her were unmistakably those of the Witch.
“You don’t deserve a good life. A first-born should be happy their life isn’t worse. You’re a good for nothing. Can’t even defend yourself. Don’t know anything about magic. Need someone to protect you. Why would you think you deserve Tony? He doesn’t care about you. He’s too good for you. He deserves someone like O’Casta, or Potts.”
Steve understood. It wasn’t as if Tony’s name or address were a secret. Which meant that—Tony had been muttering about wards, hadn’t he? He must have hidden his castle from the Witch somehow, and it had worked, until very recently. What could have—the curse. Now that the curse had caught up with him, his own warding spells were weaker against the Witch. She had to know that her curse had touched Tony, and she was trying to kill him now that she had the advantage.
He suppresses a shiver. He shouldn’t even need to shiver. The room is at an optimal temperature. The sheets are warm enough. His body isn’t cold. He still hasn’t opened his eyes.
He’s not here for that, however. He forces his gaze away from the sex dream in front of him and changes quickly. When he looks up again, he catches Steve staring at his back. Tony smirks to himself. Good to know the attraction isn’t entirely one-sided. He might have some fun with Steve after all.
They resume the sparring without a word. Tony keeps himself in check this time, tries to never exceed the power and speed he used during the first round. Steve is agile and fast, and has a few tricks up his sleeve that allow him to throw Tony down on the mat several times. Each time, Tony has to grit his teeth to stave off the bloodcurdling anger, the enraged voice inside of his head that howls at him to make Steve pay, to show him who’s most powerful, most dangerous, most lethal.
When the castle stopped moving and rumbling, Jarvis died down to his original size, his glow turning a dark marine blue. He closed his eyes and fell asleep. Tony looked exhausted as well, the cut on his temple opened again. As he staggered past Steve to put Jarvis in the fireplace again, he noticed that there was a lump of dark matter inside of Jarvis. What was it? Was it his physical form? His body? His heart? Was this why Jarvis was so afraid to leave the fireplace, because he had a vulnerable centre? Could this thing be what Tony had given Jarvis?
He busied himself with cleaning Tony up, then bandaging his arm and his temple, all the while pretending not to hear Tony’s quiet whimpers every time he brushed his chest.
The desert was relatively flat, a few sand dunes and boulders disturbing the horizon. Steve could see terrible winds lifting up clouds of sand. Where he stood, in the field, there was only a gentle breeze.
The anathema sits perfectly in his hands, lightweight and almost possessed of a will of its own, his arm swinging unconsciously in a striking arc.
, and Tony feels for him. It’s been a very strange few days. Tony ignores the argument erupting between Jan and Clint and gestures toward door.
Steve waved a hand around, gesturing at the area in general. “My home turf disappeared when I went down in the ice. Look at this place, Tony."
who let out a gleeful chirp and tackled the smaller tsum, who was holding a micro sd card in its mouth. The microSD card slid across the floor, but the tsum didn’t seem to care at all, eagerly nuzzling against Steve’s tsum in return.
for the outrage he felt, couldn’t figure out how to express it, and all he knew was that he felt some kind of awful about it all. And also maybe he wanted to put his fist through a wall.
“You sit back and relax, and i’m going to ride you until your brain dribbles right out of your ears.”
Steve shifted his shield, gauging the angle of his throw so that it would take down the first guard, and knock over Rumlow without immediately killing him. He wanted a few words with the bastard. “You’re just pissy because you have to stay with the jet and can’t take him down yourself.”
His erection, which hadn’t really faded but wasn’t fully demanding his attention in the wake of his climax, was back with a vengeance and the desperate moan that was pulled out of his throat was loud in what had been a peaceful silence.
“Milo, how are you? Let’s start up a tab, my usual please, and I’ll leave my friend here to your tender mercies.” Tony placed a black American Express onto the countertop and slid a fifty towards the bartender. The fifty disappeared into Milo’s pocket, the card went into the till, and two napkins were placed onto the bartop in a matter of seconds.
“And yet, here I am. What does that tell you?” Maria tucks her finger under Tony’s chin, turning his head this way and that as she studies him with a proprietary gaze.
The middle of the battlefield was no place to discover that shrapnel in skin felt like being ripped open on barb wire and stung like a swarm of enraged wasps. The Italian front taught him that bullets--which normally weren’t initially painful for others until the aching kicked in upon realization that they had actually been shot--felt like being stabbed with jagged knives instead of the usual reports of dull bee stings or hard punches, immediately followed by sticky wetness and then the burning kicked in.
He wants Tony to stop looking at him in disbelief, as if he can’t wrap that genius brain of his around the fact that Steve kissed him and enjoyed it. There can’t be any doubt--he’s really hard right now, and Tony’s raggedly dazed expression is pretty damn inspirational.
Tony lets his emotions swirl across the connection between himself and Steve, not fighting the rising demand for more and more of his affections, until it feels like he is surrendering every iota of what he is to the pull, flooding the bond with his love and affection and desire to have Steve safe and whole. The thin tendril now feels like a heavy rope, sturdy and woven tightly so that nothing could easily break it.
while armored and shielded in it. Tony’s love had been made tangible for him, and he had taken it and used it for himself, reveling in the glorious strength and glutting himself on the seemingly endless wellspring of affection that Tony funneled relentlessly into him. He’d felt it,
Tony’s kiss was soft but insistent, and Steve gratefully fell into it, let Tony take control for the moment. Normally Tony kissed with intent, quickly turning the most chaste of kisses into something wet and dirty and
It was a long moment before the blood stopped rushing in Steve’s ears, before he could finally focus on Tony, trapped snug against him and breathing heavily.
I could get down on my knees and properly respect your authority so much.” Stark’s wicked smile was powerful enough to lead a saint astray. “Do you want me to call you ‘
issue with the morning gets flung in his face. Steve’s supposed to be in there, dammit, but all he can feel is an unsettling
The expression on Stark’s face when he turned to look at him over his shoulder was just this side of hopeful, and honestly the whole situation was just so ridiculous now that Steve couldn’t help the tiny huff of laughter that escaped him. He
” Tony’s near scream was muffled as his black and pearl gray Christian Lacroix tie--long undone--was yanked unceremoniously out from around his collar and shoved right into his mouth. Steve, in an utterly unfair turn of events, was still managing to remain mostly in control, the only hint of his pleasure the rough thrusting behind him and the thudding beat of his racing heart.
His breathing is ragged as he lets himself bask in the afterglow, too sated to do much more than lazily trace a finger along Tony’s face, over the finely sculpted angles of his cheekbones.
Tony finally coated him enough that he must have been satisfied, since he carelessly tossed the bottle back into the confines of the hollowed out shelving and didn’t bother to look as it rebounded off the wall and skittered across the shower floor.
what to say. His mother is dead, and has been for some time. If she were to return as a ghost, it would have happened decades ago, with near immediacy. Maria had made peace with her death, had been at rest.
“God, they’d be so pissed. Half of them paid that ridiculous amount of money just for the chance to be in the same room with you, hoping to touch you, have a minute of your time, maybe even have you for themselves. The great Tony Stark, Iron Man himself, and here you are, stolen out from under their greedy noses and getting fucked to within an inch of your life.”
Steve sighed and rolled his eyes as he adjusted the harness on his uniform. Natasha had been like a dog with a bone the last two weeks, trotting out candidate after candidate for Steve to make time with. Logically, he could see the point--he
them. Blood was thicker than whiskey, Tony had said once. He would have the Soldier’s head on a platter, if Mab herself didn’t beat him to it.
“I love you.” The words leave Tony’s mouth on a gasp as he thrusts up into him, and Steve mentally seizes at the burst of emotion from his lover (Tony’s his now, he gets to have this and he’s never letting go) and envisions himself pushing his own steady love and awe along that same path.
Steve wasn’t quite able to muffle his yell as the vibration suddenly ramped up to what must have been its highest setting, arching and writhing and desperately seeking out any position that could get him away, get him closer, make it hit just right so that he could--oh, there, there there
a collar to use originally, until he and Tony had gotten into an epic row that had spilled over into a mission. Tony had been in a foul and petty mood the whole time they were in transit because Steve had had the high ground on the argument and it
Tony’s expression shifted into one of delight--rare, when Howard brought up--and leaned into Steve’s space, giving him a whiff of woodsy cologne that was filled with hints of spice and tobacco. Steve took a moment to revel in the scent while Tony nudged him frantically. “
It had taken him a while to remove the mental hurdle of “Howard’s Son”, but once he had, he’d been perpetually in awe of Tony Stark. He’d thought he’d seen genius in his own time, but Tony burned with it, and the contradicting bits and pieces of his personality made him a fascinating enigma that Steve wasn’t quite sure what to do with.
Poor Tony. He’d actually managed to carve out a short vacation for himself and had been very enthusiastic about the special taping of the Mythbusters season finale that the producers had requested Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor to guest star on.  He, Thor, and Tony had actually been on their way to the taping site when their alerts had gone off, and instead of the superhero obstacle course they were going to participate in, they’d had to double back around to Sotheby’s because Amora had attacked the auction house in search of an amulet.
“Well...we could flirt over a pretentious dinner--I saw a place with spaghetti donuts that serves their drinks in light bulbs,” Steve started, and Tony groaned and swore under his breath about hipsters. “Or…”
ended up claiming his mother instead. The instances where he was relatively fine were so incredibly outnumbered by the constant deluge of physical miseries that each one stood out as a particularly shiny jewel of a memory.
They remained curled around each other, the wall their only support--and barely so--before Tony began to shift around for better purchase in order to help Steve regain his footing, then pushed him towards the shower door. “Head for the bathtub, Brooklyn. We’re not done yet.”
Tony grinned as Steve took his hand, and Steve was certain that he’d never felt as giddy in his life as when Tony’s lips quirked up into a grin. “I’m glad, too. It means I got to meet you.”
Shunted out of his state of intense arousal by the sight of the collar, Tony frantically recalled all the recent events he could. There was nothing, though. He and Steve had been
Steve had never seen his tsum so excited. It chittered urgently at him, and Steve was honestly surprised the tsum hadn’t up and started shoving him along. The tsum’s urgency was starting to affect him, and an odd mix of trepidation and anticipatory glee began to churn in his gut as his gait lengthened from a stride to a jog and then finally an all-out run.
Tony shuddered theatrically. “God, you’re right. So. This date thing. How serious are we doing this? There’s supposed to be a decent restaurant around here that’s got some great reviews on Yelp--fancy a bite to eat?”
Steve, who’d been utterly shit for words ever since Tony got a hold of him when he got back to their room, just mumbled what he hoped was a “please hurry up”, already letting himself sink back into his blissed out headspace, and bucked his hips impatiently.
Tony’s eyes snap open as he lets out a startled cry, full of disbelief and hope and encompassing need, and Steve thrills with satisfaction at the response.
, sending a sharp burst of aching pleasure down Tony’s spine, pulled so that he scarce had to move his head in order to whisper in Tony’s ear.
Hopefully it would lead to more than that, but that was something to contemplate later, when he wasn’t so
Tony knows he should be concerned that he can’t decide which order that’s going in, but he’s more fixated on the fact that Steve is lowering his head to Tony’s waist, letting his tongue trace up the ridge of his abdomen to dip into the muscles of his six-pack.
... Steve wound the length of chain in his hand tighter and tighter, drawing Tony in closer, like he was an unruly pet. He could already feel his face starting to warm up as he flushed.
“You smell so good, Steve, taste so nice...” Tony licked up the side of Steve’s neck, which earned him a rough groan that trailed off into a gasp as Tony’s wicked hand slid all the way down his length to carefully massage his balls, and Steve cried out as Tony suddenly pressed into his perineum, and it was like being lit up from the inside out. Steve let out a guttural moan, snapping his hips back and forth in Tony’s reformed grip as dark encouragement and lewd praise was whispered in his ear--a sweet torment all on its own.
“The trip went fine. How were things here?” Tony asked carefully. No, really, what the hell had crawled up Steve’s ass this time? This was so unfair, dammit. Steve didn’t get to break out the collar while looking life a manifestation of his more advanced wet dreams. Bullshit!
in the serum? You don’t see this shit outside of pornos, babe, and I’m really, really, glad to be part of this endeavor right now. You’re going to let me on that right now,
The lesson he somehow missed, though, was that when Steve Rogers wanted something, he damn well got it. Sometimes that meant doggedly pursuing his traumatized and amnesia riddled best friend across the globe, sometimes that meant feeling a bit frisky and yanking his lover into a side room and ripping his clothes off at a $5,000 a plate charity dinner for a children’s research hospital...or STEM funding, he actually wasn’t sure which.
"No, but I have an idea how fast you might be able to get me off." Tony was entirely unrepentant and offered up his best smirk--the one that had landed him in the middle of a frisky pile of cheerleaders the last time he was at a Super Bowl after-party.
Mae. He was going to name her Mae, in honor of Mae Jemison, who rocketed into space, and Mae West and Mae Questal, respectively the original bad-girl starlet and voice of Betty Boop, the original bad-girl cartoon. Triple-layered pun. Inordinately pleased with himself, Tony stroked a hand over the gearshift, caressing the custom silver head lovingly as his demon-girl purred for him. Yeah, baby. Yeah.
It’s been so long since that was the case--after the serum, he’d been too large, too bulky for any of his preferred positions when it came to this, and it had all been a moot point anyway because it had been the army, and that meant women for him because he couldn’t afford the risk.
“Pat, this isn’t going to be like the Boeing thing. I’m just wondering if you’d be interested in overseeing our Sub-Saharan operations. I’ve got some interested parties in my oil alternatives.”
He tries to wriggle free, writhing in Steve’s grasp as he deepens the kiss, rebelling even as he kisses him back, greedily stealing bits of a moment he can’t keep as he fights a losing battle to keep his wits about him—he lost this battle a long time ago he thinks—and his lungs are burning and his pulse is racing and he feels like he’s falling, floating, slipping away,
from it. And of course, “That One Weekend Back In ‘28 Where Bucky Caught A Cold And I Didn’t Get It.” Steve hadn’t meant to be smug about it, but Bucky had been so
A person didn’t just wake up one morning and decide to literally hate something out of existence—an Anathema was forged of deliberate intent, an irritant shaped and honed and refined over time into something exquisite, much like a pearl.
“Charmer. Let me finish getting some proof my dad’s will was altered, then we rob this dirtbag blind, and then...talk? Kiss. Both?”
“How in the everloving hell did you end up out here?” Tony demanded, resting his forehead against Steve’s collarbone while the man made impressively short work of undoing his belt buckle.
Steve trailed off in and let out a long groan as Tony bore down into his muscles. It hurt at first, but the gel Tony was was working into his back chilled his ache, and as he continued to work the knots out of Steve’s muscles, the initial cooling disappeared in a rush of comforting warmth, and soon Steve felt himself going limp, falling into a haze of relief and sheer bliss as Tony began to work what felt like decades of tension out of his sorely abused muscles.
” Steve paused, thinking about sleek black hair, dark eyes, and a kind-hearted soul that refused to be diminished, even in the midst of the war. “But he

Steve plows straight into Wrecker, knocking him off of his feet, and before the villain can stand up, a hammer smashes into Piledriver. Piledriver can sometimes hold against Mjolnir, but caught off guard? The point goes to Thor, and Piledriver goes flying backwards to land on top of Wrecker. Steve lets a surprisingly horrifying bleat and menaces the pair of them with his horns while the rest of the Avengers come running towards them.
” Tony struggles in Bulldozer’s grasp while Piledriver and Thunderball continue to menace the police. Wrecker looks entirely too gleeful about the prospect of hitting the goat coming at him, hitting
“Do you think dabbling in mediocrity will make you loved? That your subservience to people who both envy and hate you for daring to be better than them makes you
The car purred to life, and then Tony was off, driving too fast and leaving him in the proverbial dust.
Horror surges through Tony at Steve’s reaction, and he instantly reaches into the bond to hurl reassurance and every positive thing he is capable of feeling across it. Normally it feels like he’s reaching out to a vague nothingness, but this time there is a demanding
Steve Rogers. Captain America. You’ve got everything going for you. You don’t need me dragging you down.”
That one...that one had broken him a bit more than anything else, and confessing to Tony about Howard and Bucky and what Hydra had warped his closest friend into--it had shattered him. It had shattered Tony, too, but somehow they’d managed to pick each other up and piece themselves back together and somewhere during the process they’d become...integral to each other. Peggy had been his past, but Tony was the future, and he’d drawn him into something that felt a little like home.
Steve yanks his arm free and darts past him in an instant. He’s a goat by the time he’s out the Quinjet ramp, free falling.
The air is thick with the scent of sweat and lust and blood, and Tony’s been reduced to breathy gasps and hitching moans that rapidly morph into broken, softly desperate noises as Steve takes, and takes, and
"I appreciate the thought, but this isn't working for me. If you want a date or a night out somewhere, I'm your guy, but you can't try to give me back my past like this. This...isn’t it. It's gone."
to do something, or otherwise he’ll probably go insane. Really, it’s kind of a miracle that he’s as sane as he is at this age with all the shit he’s gone through, so he shouldn’t be pushing it.
Something dislodged itself from his throat, and it reverberated inside his head—maybe a groan, maybe a cry, maybe a scream—and it didn’t bring relief like he hoped it would. An ache inside his skull throbbed.
His mind came back to him then, and he had enough clues to put together that he was in Tony’s workshop, on his couch. The workshop had no windows, but he would wager it was either very late at night or very early morning.
Steve laid there silently for a few seconds, trying to get himself under control. Finally, he simply muttered, “Cold.” He almost hoped that Tony wouldn’t hear him.
Something shifted against his back, the movement enough to startle him so much that his entire body tensed until he felt his shoulders twinge. Even still, the shivers didn’t stop.
a pretty intense game. Air hockey is a very serious deal at the Avenger’s compound, and Tony loves the way his heart is racing, blood singing in his veins. He loves the chaos around him, nothing overtly dangerous, just a group of people—a group of friends—enjoying each other’s company very loudly and very enthusiastically.
“We’re gonna fix you up, Cap.” Sam. That was Sam’s voice. It must’ve been him doing all the hovering. “You’re gonna be just fine. Stay with us, buddy.”
Tony likes the way the guy’s cheeks turn pink, so obvious in contrast to his pale skin. “Oh, yeah. It’s—”
The use of his name shocks Tony for a split second, renders him speechless for the whole three seconds it takes for the guy to be out the door again. It’s only then that it occurs to him that he has a name tag. That he had actually bothered to wear it today.
Tony watches him through the window, watches him approaching the door of the cafe and then stopping to bend down and—Tony tilts his head to get a better look, and yes, the guy is petting a fucking dog.
He calls Thor honey bun and gets a satisfying grin for his efforts, calls Clint a Casanova and is rewarded by a delightful split-second of incredulity followed by a pleased sniff, and calls Rhodey buttercup and gets… absolutely nothing—of course, Tony expected this; by now, nothing he does could ever faze one Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.
He can’t bring himself to acknowledge the muttered, “Thank you,” and feels a bit guilty about it for the one hundred eight seconds it takes for Clint to come back.
.” Tony loosened his hold on Steve’s waist and demanded, “JARVIS, turn up the heat.” And then he stood up.
Steve had only a moment to wonder at the real worry in Sam’s voice before he had to defy that last order and nod off into oblivion.
Tony kept his promise every night after that, too, with his lips at the back of Steve’s neck, his arm around him like an anchor, his presence a buffer to the cold. Every time Tony smiled at him, something inside Steve chipped away and left him thinking that maybe he wasn’t a burden at all. That maybe Tony cared about him and wanted to look after him like Steve wanted to look after Tony.
A rough piece of cloth was gently nudged into his mouth. Steve bit down on it obediently, even though he wasn’t totally sure what it was there for.
thank you for reading! if you get a chance, please leave a comment to let me know what you thought! :)
The silence that met this question stretched over an uncomfortably long minute; long enough for Steve to wonder if he was, in fact, talking to himself.
“Shh, shh.” Someone ran their fingers through the long strands of his sweat-drenched hair. It could only do so much to soothe him, but nonetheless Steve tried his best to focus on it above anything else. “It’s okay, Steve. You’re going to be okay.”
—flashed through his mind like he was watching a film of the worst moments of his life, of a train, an unforgiving, icy ravine, and Bucky
“Oh,” is the only thing Tony can think to say as his stomach drops, and he wishes he hadn’t said anything at all.
So he’s not in a great mood when he—after discreetly glaring daggers at Clint while the guy saunters off with that damned innocuous grin—rattles off his usual greeting for the next customer in line and asks for his order.
“All right, Steve, just hold onto my hand.” Something hard and cool slipped into his fingers. “Feel free to squeeze as tight as you want. I’m gonna be honest— this next bit is going to suck. A lot.” The hand in his own briefly squeezed his fingers. “You ready?”
Steve’s smile has turned awkward and while he’s looking in Tony’s general vicinity, he doesn’t quite meet his eyes. He says, “Thank you, Tony.”
It took several minutes of Steve counting Tony’s breaths, every soft inhale and exhale, for him to work up the courage to ask, “What am I doing here, Tony?”
Steve tried to open his eyes, ignoring the pain and the ringing in his ears—still there, if a little quieter—focusing only on getting his eyelids to move. After an infinite second, he managed to pry his eyes open and immediately wished he hadn’t bothered. Bright light seared his retinas, compounding the already unbearable pulsating in his head.
He has his order ready by the time the guy reaches the register. Tony knows the guy has noticed by the way he smiles sweetly at him. There’s a voice of warning inside Tony’s head—one screaming
He got in bed at 23:00 exactly, and lay there for hours, just staring up into the darkness. He fought off the drowsiness even as he knew he should welcome it. It was the same as always, ever since he’d awoken from the ice.
And that’s more to Tony’s style. See, he’s a pretty persistent guy. Annoying, obnoxious, irritating—he’s been called all these things—and worse—all his life. Hell, he doesn’t even see them as insults anymore.
Something warm and heavy was wrapped around his chest, and his back was pressed up against something—some
He curled up into himself, trying to stave off the unabating cold. He rocked back into the spot Tony had just vacated in a futile attempt to soak up the leftover heat. And he listened carefully for Tony’s return, refusing to close his eyes.
“No problem.” And Tony walks away, gets some breakfast for himself even though he suddenly doesn’t have much of an appetite, and goes to sit next to Wanda. She gives him a look Tony can only describe as
Tony is silent in his judgement, however, too busy and in too sour a mood to impart his unquestionably enlightened wisdom. He rings the order up, reluctantly adds a shot of blueberry to the cup he’s just filled, and all-too-happily sends the guy on his way.
Steve’s screams were muffled only barely by the cloth. Blinding pain seared his abdomen, as if someone actually was cutting it from his body, and his vision whited out. The metal in his fingers didn’t so much as creak as he bore down, and when darkness came, he welcomed it with open arms.
Steve hummed in response, pressing further back into Tony’s chest, wanting to feel enveloped by him no matter how ridiculous that sounded. No matter that Steve was
The guy smiles, and it looks a bit painful, and then he turns around and leaves just as he always does.
He twisted where he lay, feeling trapped by an unknown weight across his middle, and blinked against the darkness of the night. His vision blurred before sharpening into a clarity he was sure no other non-superhuman had ever possessed. The sight before him confused him for only a few seconds before he realized that he was tucked into a couch and was staring at the back of a leather cushion.
Except whenever they crossed paths that day (which was a lot more often than usual), Tony always smiled at him, a knowing gleam in his eyes. He’d touch Steve more—a brush across his shoulders, a squeeze of his arm, a gentle nudge, a playful poke—and his teasing would hold none of its usual bite.
And then Natasha has beaten him before he even realizes what’s happening, and the room might literally be shaking with Thor’s victorious booming, but that might also be Tony’s imagination.
He’s hardly even paying attention, working on autopilot while equations sketch themselves on the scrap paper in his brain, but then, abruptly, what he’s just tapped into the computer catches his notice, and he just. Can’t.
“Everyone else is fine, Steve.” Natasha’s soft voice was right next to his ear, her breath caressing the skin there. “Just focus on yourself, for once. Think you can do that for me?”
The audacity of this guy, to order something so simple in its ridiculousness, so nonsensical and possibly even more offensive than those sickeningly sugary drinks teenage girls like to take selfies with. What gives him the
he wanted to sob. But he couldn’t because even though he might not have been Captain America anymore, he was still the captain of this little ragtag group of fugitives and he’d be damned before he broke down in front of them.
Steve felt his head loll to the side, and his stomach still burned. His eyes opened, just to slits, but it was enough to see his feet dragging in the snow. He tried to move his legs, tried to put some weight on them, to carry himself, but all that resulted in was more pain—fierce and powerful and agonizing—and his eyes slipped shut once more.
Something cold and damp was placed on his forehead, and the brief relief it brought could have brought Steve to tears at another time. As it was, it felt like all the blood in his veins was on fire, and the searing pain in his stomach was now impossible to ignore and didn’t allow him to think or even feel anything else.
“Hi,” the guy greets before Tony can say anything. “Can I have a small black coffee with a shot of blueberry, please?” He speaks louder than he did the first time he’d come in, and Tony’s surprised by how deep his voice actually is. He notes that the guy’s hair doesn't look quite as lifeless as it had the first time he saw it, and maybe—although Tony might just be imagining it—maybe the guy’s shoulders don’t look as slumped.
The guy looks surprised, like he’s only just realized he has never told Tony, and then says, “I’m Steve.”
Tony doesn’t always know what he’s doing, but then, who does? Well, maybe Steve does, or at least he always seems to have an opinion on everything except for the fun things like—who would look better in a tiara, Thor or Fury? And then he just rolls his eyes, but actually, Tony’s pretty certain he has an opinion on that too, and he’s just holding out on him because he has a stick up his ass that’s ever so slowly—so fucking slowly—sliding out. And Tony could make a joke about that probably—
And Steve does something funny in response. He flinches, body going rigid. Tony has to physically force a frown from his face before it can properly settle, but the damage is done.
But Steve was admittedly clueless at interacting with people when he’d ordinarily tried to keep them at arm's length. So Steve couldn’t bring himself to start treating Tony any differently than he had before, and he didn’t seek him out that night when he was supposed to go to sleep, even though he wanted to.
For a moment, Steve struggled to breathe. At that same moment, the arm over his chest adjusted its position, allowing air to pass more easily into his lungs.
When he next gained consciousness, he could distinctly feel beads of sweat dotting his brow and above his upper lip, starkly contrasting the shivers that streaked through his limbs and down his spine.
“You’re more comfortable than you look, actually.” Tony’s voice held a teasing lilt, the same one he’d been using more and more around Steve lately. It made him feel warm inside, enough to actually start fighting back against the smothering chill. There was a lengthy pause, and then Tony said meaningfully, “Go to sleep, Steve.”
Steve swallowed, didn’t close his eyes. “Can’t,” he breathed, not at all surprised at the way his throat was closing up. “Tony, I—”
To Tony’s ears, it sounds like a challenge. “Sweetheart, I can kick my leg higher than a cheerleader. Come a little closer, and I’ll show you.”
He’s playing in his workshop like he’s wont to do when Bruce barges in—well, Bruce doesn’t really barge, but he doesn’t even knock this time, so for him, it’s close enough—and asks Tony if he’s read the paper he had sent him.
The drink is in his hands before the guy even has the door completely open, and Tony none-too-gently pushes Clint aside so he can ring him up. Clint shrugs, and if he says anything, Tony doesn’t hear him and, more importantly, doesn’t care.
He remembered coming down here last night to ask Tony for assistance with a broken strap on his shield. Tony had been busy, had waved him to the couch with a “Just a minute,” and Steve had been content to wait. His eyes shut in embarrassment when he realized he must have fallen asleep on the couch, apparently much more ‘content’ than he would’ve thought. That didn’t really explain why Tony hadn’t just woken him up, though, or why Tony was laying there with him.
Five years later, Tony no longer works at the coffee shop. He does, however, still drink a whole lot of coffee. And he sees Steve everyday—in fact, he wakes up to him.
Dedicated, relentless, whatever, it’s how he’s got to where he is in his life. It’s how he became Iron Man. It’s how he saved the world a couple or more times.
He’s starting to think Aunt Pegs recruited him just for shits and giggles, and not because she could genuinely use the help. He wouldn’t have even agreed to it if his mother hadn’t insisted, and now he’s beginning to wonder if being paraded around all those stupid parties and galas and what-the-fuck-ever wouldn’t have been the lesser burden.
It doesn’t just slip out, it’s deliberate, but Tony doesn’t think Bruce notices. In fact, Bruce doesn’t even twitch, reaching out to hand him the wrench like he’s asked before heading back to the door, throwing over his shoulder, “Read it, okay, and get back to me when you have a chance.”
Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday the team trains together before they go to have lunch. It’s Wednesday, and Tony is already in the compound’s massive gym, stretching and expertly not thinking about what he’s going to do that he doesn't know he’s gonna do.
“Here you go.” He hands off the cup before he says, “I added a bit of vanilla. I’m not sure that makes it any less offensive, but maybe it’ll taste a little better?” Tony’s voice goes up at the end in a question, like he’s unsure of himself. Which is blatantly ridiculous, so he clears his throat and adds, “No extra charge, of course.”
“Shh,” Tony breathed, shifting again, his grip on Steve’s middle becoming more secure as he buried his head against the nape of Steve’s neck. “‘M sleeping.”
So Steve closed his eyes, focused on Tony’s steady breathing, and went back to sleep, trusting that Tony would still be there come morning.
His vision was blurred, but he thought he could make out a silhouette of a person hovering in front of him. Where was he? And
Tony’s grin drops in confusion, and the guy justifies, “My ma, uh… she liked them. They were her favorite.” He shrugs, like that’s the only way he can explain it, and Tony thinks he understands.
a brilliant idea to call Wilson a sweet pea—he isn’t one, anyway, so Tony doesn’t know what he was trying to prove there—and determines never to do so again.
Bruce is surprisingly swept up in the excitement of the competition, because he has a keen eye set on the action and keeps leaning over to whisper tips in Tony’s ear. Behind him, Rhodey is for whatever reason giving him a pep talk that Tony is mostly ignoring in favor of grinning smugly at Natasha, whose eyes are gleaming even as she narrows them at him, a smirk quirking the corner of her lips up.
He quickly turns away before Steve notices the way he’s caught Tony’s attention, loading up a new plate with a bit of everything. When everyone is settled in a chair somewhere around the kitchen, he goes over and places the plate in front of Steve.
Something cold was pressed to the seam of his lips, which opened automatically. Drops of liquid dribbled past his lips, chilling and revitalizing him all at once.
He saves the best for last without really meaning to. Okay, so he’s hesitating a little, sue him. It doesn’t mean anything. None of this really means anything—it’s just for fun. Just an experiment to see what his teammates do.
The hushed voices came from somewhere on Steve’s left. The second was familiar, but the first… well, the first was also somehow familiar, but it put his body on high alert. Enough so that he tried to wrench his eyes open to
He doesn’t crush Tony, but it’s a near thing, his forearms bracing on either side of Tony’s head before they can collide. Steve’s eyes are wide as they stare down into Tony’s, and he’s breathing hard. Way harder than their little tussle really warranted.
Steve was grateful that Tony didn’t push him to talk about it, at least not yet, and when he’d left the workshop with his shield intact—strap brand new—it was almost as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened at all.
Next came a sound like an object being scraped across the floor. Steve weakly turned his head in the direction of the noise. Most any type of movement he tried usually shot a spike of pain through his temples, and this time was no different. He winced.
but she doesn’t say anything. And he’s more grateful to her for that than she will probably ever know.
He kicks and Steve just barely jerks out of the way, chuckling as he says, “That the best you can do?”
And Steve… well, Steve is already sweeping his leg out from underneath him. Tony tries to sidestep, but he’s too late, he’s going down. And that should be that, but it isn’t because Steve’s too slow to pull away, so when Tony’s foot accidentally hooks around his ankle he can’t counterbalance, and then he’s going down too.
Steve shuddered as another gust of air hit the back of his neck. He was laying rigid, and he was freezing in a way that wasn’t at all reasonable, as if the chill from his dreams had followed him into the waking world. He seemed to only be in his undershirt. Where had his flannel gone? His belt? His shoes?
He wasn’t about to have Tony think he was relying on him, didn’t want to put that burden on anyone. He knew first-hand how it felt to have someone depend on you, and while he wouldn’t change that for anything, he didn’t want to trouble Tony.
He catches Nat’s eye and she gives him a crooked smile, her version of a shit-eating grin. “Better luck next time.”
With tremendous effort, Steve pried his eyes open. Even with his vision severely blurred, Steve recognized the brown eyes staring directly back at him.
—soft and cozy. Even breaths skimmed over the skin on the back of his neck, soothing in their consistency.
Steve shifted beneath the arm holding him in place but stopped almost immediately when his stomach twinged uncomfortably.
“Don’t be such a baby,” continued the voice his mind had decided was Tony’s. “It was barely a scratch. You’ve taken worse hits.”
“You can.” Tony’s voice was soft but firm, and Steve froze when he felt Tony’s lips brush over the back of his neck, pressing against his skin in a gentle kiss. “I’m right here, Steve.”
There was shuffling to his left, and then… “Hey, big guy. Heard you took a bit of a bad fall. FRIDAY?”
Steve bit down on a strangled cry and tried not to thrash out. Even so, his distress garnered Tony’s attention, and he felt Tony sit up a bit.
Steve was cruelly wrenched from the woolly distortion of his thoughts by his body seizing. For many seconds that felt like an eternal, relentless age, his brain completely blanked.
Thor’s booming voice is the loudest, as it always is, as he animatedly cheers Natasha on, pumping his drink into the air, seemingly uncaring about the way some of his beer splashes out and slides down his fingers.
The words sounded heavy, like an oath, and they made Steve shudder. He couldn’t even pretend that it was because of the cold, because the cold had started to melt right off his skin the moment Tony’s arm went around him.
, you redo the experiment. Change the question. Manipulate your variables, and do it again and again and
Even Banner is grumbling under his breath—“Told him he should’ve taken the bank shot”—as he passes a bill to Wanda who deftly stuffs it in her pocket and goes back to whatever she was doing on her Starkpad.
A heavy silence rang out at those four words. Steve didn’t even have the wherewithal to understand what they meant, but fortunately nobody was asking him.
Actually, he’s having a good week. A genuinely good week. No bad guys to take down, no stress, more sleep than he’s gotten in ages. Life’s good all around.
and his stomach… He cut off that thought before his brain could latch back on to the burning pain in his gut. Debris from the explosion must’ve followed him off the edge.
Tony’s bogged down with orders, sweating, and swearing for the tenth time that day that he’d quit this shit job when Clint pleads with him to take over as cashier so he can take a call in the back. At his wit’s end, Tony seriously contemplates strangling him, but figures that would just land him with more work to do.
Tony is treated to a suspicious glare when he calls Wanda pumpkin and a lecture where “fascinating” is used at least five times when he calls Vision
They didn’t discuss it in the morning, not the sleeping in the same space thing, nor the nightmares thing.
Steve snorts and shakes his head, but he doesn’t say anything. Just walks out onto the mat and positions his feet, falling into his habitual warm-up routine. He knows that pads would only be for Tony’s benefit, anyway, and when they first started training together maybe Tony would’ve gotten offended, would’ve thought he was being condescending for even asking, but now he knows that Steve just cares.
Tony facepalms—like, physically facepalms—when he’s sure the guy won’t be able to see it, and woefully thinks this was the last time he’d ever see him.
Steve let out a choked sob, and his eyes flew open. Shivers wracked his body and for a few moments he couldn’t make sense of his surroundings. Images of his nightmare—his
His stomach was on fire. Agony rippled through his body in torturous spurts, and it was almost all he could think about. His thoughts were muddled—
He could hear the faint explosion, the distant gunshot echoed through his body, mixed with strange sound, like churning, gurgling and dropping. Water? Blood? Either? Neither? He couldn’t understand, but he wanted, he wanted so bad.
A scream. Hot sun burning his skin. Growing pain in his chest, and a constant mumbling in distance. A name… his name, repeated and repeated over and over again, and then his eyes snapped open.
It was strangely peaceful, for the day. Nothing out of the ordinary at the Academy… nothing, but Tony flipping lazily through the page of one of his art book. One that he used to study with. Thick, heavy and well used for his study, and like Tony loved to remind him about his ‘
All my idea on the whole matter, all my will to never look at this” Tony moved a little the hand in Steve grip “but here i am, with you, your name, and all this. Incredible.” The man tuned out, still mumbling incoherent word, at last for Steve, that with a little kiss stopped the blabbing, and a little thug, forced the other man to raise from his spot.
“I… mh…” started Tony, hissing at the pulling, but moving his eyes from the book to Steve face and vice versa. “Sorry? But you didn’t talk to me, and i wanted your attention?” continued the boy, blinding going to catch Steve hand in his hair, just to make the other boy stop his pulling. “And if you are are worried about the damage, i can always buy you a new book ok? Anyway that was all ruined, you needed a new book and…” and an hand covered his mouth shutting Tony and his rumbling.
It was an honest-to-God speakeasy, cozily lit with red curtains as the backdrop to a small stage, and clusters of tables across the floor. Tony bypassed all the tables and headed towards the bar. “This is the best place for a drink in the whole city. I usually roll through here after I close a business deal.”
Jan always did end up on the optimistic side of the scale. Tony’s a realist, though, and he knows how this goes for him. He’ll be lucky if he even has a friendship to salvage with Steve after this all dies down.
“They had all sorts of folk during my era, Tony, and Brooklyn Heights in particular was a hub for the LGBT community--is that still the term, or did that change?--anyway, it’s hardly a shocker. I’ve been informed that more than a few academics had their speculations about me.
to the universe, and magic implies that those rules can be broken. Magic is reckless and unpredictable, and cannot be accurately accounted for. Tony has no qualms with what he likes to categorize as “sufficiently advanced science”, but
, Tony smelled good. Steve basked in the woodsy tobacco, vanilla, and sandalwood base notes of Tony’s cologne, and the faint tang of metal hidden beneath that, all mingled in with the lighter musk of Tony’s own scent, staring into Tony’s blue eyes.
Steve licks at Tony’s throat, staunching the flow of blood. His tongue is dark red with blood when it darts out to lick clean the messy smear of blood, and Tony convulses with the sudden, visceral need to
Steve’s lips quirked up into a wry grin. It had been pretty damn inspiring thinking about the plug, too. He traced a finger around the head of the plug, delighting in the way it made Tony shiver and tremble against him, and tugged at it gently, easing it out in steady, measured increments. Tony had planned every single part of this late afternoon venture, including prepping himself for Steve--and good lord, what a mental image that had made.
There’s no stopping the quaking moans and shudders as Steve drinks deeply, guzzling more and more of his blood, velvet curls of poisonous delight and liquid heat winding slowly through his veins from the mess of endorphins and venom playing havoc with his overwhelmed senses. Steve’s equally gone on it all, slurping and sucking and lapping at the wound he’s created, slaking his thirst with fixed determination.
Tony hummed lowly, a pleased sound in his ear that sent electricity down his spine. “Like that idea? You know, I was probably going to pull over and take care of myself before you caught me, Steve. Just unzip, run my hand down into my pants and get myself off real quick.”
,If ever there was a moment he could have vented out all his pain--emotional and physical--it was after he lost Bucky. He could have yelled, could have wept, could have smashed things, just...put a hole through the wall and had a raging fit. He could have done all that, unloaded decades of pain and a war’s worth of horror and trauma underneath the guise of lashing out over Bucky’s loss--but everyone expected him to be in control. Somewhere along the way, people had forgotten there was a simple man behind Captain America, and they expected him to constantly be some kind of paragon of virtue and strength. Everyone had their damn eyes on him, watching to see how he handled this personal disaster, waiting for the
The no-nonsense method Tony used was a complete contrast to the earlier teasing, and Steve supposed that Tony was feeling pretty worked up himself--certainly the dazed expression on his face after Steve had finished kissing him was telling.
Steve kisses the sigil again, swipes it with the tip of his tongue, and has to bite back his own moan as Tony shivers and rolls his hips. Steve wants him, wants him so badly right now. He wants Tony to undress him, to strip him down until it’s just him in his skin and let him open him up and sink in deep. He shudders, lets his head drop so that his forehead is resting against Tony’s own heated flesh.
it is really, but his hand started burning almost immediately after he jumped in to shield Steve from the arcane blast, and when he finally got his gauntlets off, he’d picked up an interesting body modification. He honestly doesn’t know what to make of the pale silver filigree covering the inside of his palm, or the (actually quite beautiful) stylized shield in the center of it all, that is quite obviously a combination of Steve’s rather iconic shield, and his old arc reactor.
Tony’s hand twitches in his, and Steve grasps it tighter. Tony might not be ready to run off and leave him as a goat to stave off the discussion that Steve has just decided they’re having, but why take any chances? Tony is not a quiet man, but this whole journey through the mansion and towards his room has been
anymore, and his tie was still shoved in his mouth, a thick wad of silk that he could make out in his reflection between his reddened and slick lips. His white dress shirt had been ripped open to expose his chest and the arc reactor shone brilliantly in his chest, his tanned skin flushed dark rose around it, the hard-earned ridges of his abs well-defined as he strained in Steve’s hold.
Realization and horror arrive, moments too late. Steve grabs his wrists in his larger hands, forcing his arms down as he pins Tony in place with his weight.
Steve stroked him through it until Tony was left a wrung-out and whimpering mess of a man, then collapsed on his side, flushed and sweaty and panting for breath. He closed his eyes, suddenly too tired to keep them open, and there was a bit of shifting around, and then Tony was wiping him off with a warm, moist towel, his torso and groin and thighs, and
Tony met him thrust for thrust, automatically curving his arms over his shoulders as Steve continued to move inside of him and grew almost impossibly harder, and it was too much and not enough and Tony quivered and writhed beneath him, completely at his mercy.
wailing, he can hear it, and as he focuses in on the soul-wrenching cries they morph into raucous laughter—
not the wet sciences, and the shareholders were too conservative to accept the sort of fiduciary impact wading in fresh to the pharmaceutical industry would have caused. Not fresh on the heels of the upheaval Howard’s death caused.
It wasn’t a steady climb, no, but a methodical overwhelming that never quite followed any set pattern and it was too much and too good and he’d not seen this side of his own desire since before the serum, and it was barrelling over him too fast for him to even keep up with now and Steve sobbed brokenly under Tony’s urging, feeling himself flush and the hot spray of the water on his skin wasn’t soothing anymore, it was registering even more intensely on his senses, pattering over his shoulders and back in heated little staccatos of pressure and...and...and…
Steve hitched his mirrored shades down to pin Stark with a sharp look. "Try fast enough to get you directly to jail, if you don't respect an officer of the law, Mr. Stark.”
Ty. Tony couldn’t understand it and had eventually decided it was because Ty held so much significance for him that Steve felt like he couldn’t compete. Ty had been his first, after all. His first crush, his first love, his first
Steve had abandoned the teasing caresses in order to clamp his hand directly over Tony’s mouth and muffle the sharp cries and moans that had been pouring forth as that other wicked hand stroked him through every blissful moment until he was left over-sensitized and half-dazed.
“Only blue balls by now, but I can take care of myself, and honestly, I’m just glad I got to see that, do you know how fucking
, lightly pinched his right nipple, and Steve’s hips snapped up as Tony drove himself back down on his dick, pulling another one of those wonderful low moans out.
Steve paused for a moment, but no one was approaching, and he dropped a mild look down at Tony, who was making soft demanding noises and attempting to rut against him with absolutely no success, trying to urge him into resuming.
Steve was fucking into him so hard now, pistoning in and out and bouncing Tony on his lap with unchecked fervor and he had moved past teasing now and was urging Tony on, telling him to come, to let go, to feel it, demanding more and more of him.
and when his eyes slip closed and his mind reaches out there is nothing but a thick blanket of warmth and comfort and serenity and joy. It’s like nothing he’s ever experienced but everything he’s wanted, and it’s all because of
They kissed a while longer as they got themselves back into some semblance of order, and once finished collecting themselves, Tony gave Steve one last kiss and stepped away. “You think you can handle that bike so soon, or should I give you a lift somewhere?”
Tony scoffed, and Steve trembled as his warm brown eyes went dark and intense with carnal promise. “I’ve got you figured out now, Rogers. By the time I’m done with you, you won’t be able to form
The lights were dimmed almost to the point of being entirely turned off, but that didn’t matter because almost twelve candles were spread across the room, the pockets of soft light amplified in the mirrors reflection so that the room fairly glowed. The candles were tall and olive green affairs that filled the entire bathroom with a surprisingly nice blend of eucalyptus, sandalwood, and vanilla that didn’t irritate his nostrils.
Tony looked over at their tsums, who were still cuddling obliviously, and back at Steve. “Steve Rogers. Captain America. My soulmate is
The reassurance helped a bit, and Steve closed his eyes, reveling in the soft massaging wash. “Alright, Tony.”
This though...this was thick and slick enough that it offset the natural roughness of Tony’s palm, and Steve found himself rolling his hips, chasing more and more of the frissons of pleasure that traveled through him as he thrust into Tony’s loose hold. Tony’s fingers would occasionally drop out of their loose fist and take on a life of their own, each one moving in their own little sphere of influence. Tony’s thumb would unerringly find its way to the head of his erection, spreading the thick precome there around the sensitive flesh, nothing rushed or hurried in his movements, just slowly indulging Steve’s whims as he picked up on them.
“Oh fuck, listen to you, darling, howling my name and begging for it, fucking hell, come on, Sergeant, come on, Steve, I want to feel you break around me, you’re so fucking hot like this, what the hell even are you
Tony shrugged, and ran a hand over the hood of his car. “My demon-girl here will take good--” Tony trailed off and looked at his hand in vague horror, casting about for something to use. Finding none, he sighed and then wiped it off on the grass. “My very next stop is a car wash.”
Steve didn’t know what kind of lube Tony had gotten a hold of in his persistent quest for products that wouldn’t put a damper on their love life, but it was perfect. For all Tony rigorously maintained his hands and nails, he was unable to escape the myriad nicks, scrapes, and calluses that were the badge of his career, and even a gentle touch that would have felt perfectly fine to anyone else felt abrasive on his more sensitive parts.
Tony freezes under him, and Steve isn’t sure if it’s rejection or surprise or what, but Tony relaxes suddenly, lips parting beneath his, and
There’s a lot of gossip about Tony, about how indulgent he can be, how insanely talented he is in bed. One of his flings had claimed on live national television that Tony was a genius with both brains, and Cosmopolitan magazine had dedicated a special two-page spread to his sexcapades in their “Best Sex Ever Had” article. A skeptic might think it was all exaggeration, but, no.
Steve straightened, suddenly self-conscious about his outfit. Tony was wearing a pair of nice gray slacks and a black shirt with a thin silver tie, the gray suit jacket slung over his shoulder in a pose that looked like he’d prowled off the cover of a fashion magazine.
His craft room, accessible only through his personal living space, is where the magic literally happens, insofar as he is willing to call it that. Applied metaphysics is much more palatable—and accurate. Tony hates magic—there is technology and physics and
Instead, Steve ate the curtains, a magazine, most of a boot, and had started in on part of the bedsheets by the time Tony showed up to collect him. The leftovers were gone, as was the water, and an utterly foul stench was emanating from the corner that he honestly didn’t want to contemplate but would have to deal with eventually because Jarvis would snap and murder them all if confronted with it.
Tony needs to get free, he needs to save Steve, he wishes he had something, anything, to help him. The urge to protect Steve hammers in his chest, in his heart, and pulses along the bond, a desperate, consuming desire to thwart what is sure to be a fatal encounter. He wishes with all of his being that Steve would be protected. Anything, he would give anything to somehow encase Steve in his own Iron Man armor.
He can almost taste the whiskey on the back of his tongue, swears he can hear the low whistle Howard only ever gave when he was impressed.
Maybe it’s the lack of serum? It hurts, to think that Tony could be so shallow, but he’d be lying if he didn’t admit that he’s no great prize like this.
They were still a few hours away from last call, but Steve had no interest in closing the bar down; Tony was brilliant, and charming, and an incorrigible flirt, and as much as he hated to admit it, Natasha was right--he needed a good time, even if it was just for one night.
Steve grinned, charmed at the courtesy. “I’ll be fine, Tony. You drive safe and stop that ridiculous speeding. I don’t want to get called out here to find a crew scraping you off the road.”
There’s a soft mutter from Tony about how Steve had literally climbed him like a tree half an hour ago but
Tony eventually reached out to another pump bottle, and then vanilla and apples blended in with the scent of the tea tree oil and teakwood and hot dampness of the shower, creating a fragrant woodsy scent that reminded him of the custom creams and lotions Tony and Natasha returned with from those indulgent day spas they liked to sneak off too.
It was far too late for this, if he was going to be a responsible adult. Responsible adults didn’t buy million-dollar super-cars and race them along the Pacific coast, though, so Tony figured he was off the hook for feeling bad about it. Yeah, it was late, but it was a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo Le Mans and if you have a car with 1,500 horsepower on your hands that could go 0-60 in 2.9 seconds, you’re meant to go jetting off into the horizon with the pedal to the metal. Besides, he’d been plenty damn responsible already, given that he’d actually attended all the meetings he’d scheduled with various Silicon Valley think tanks and walked away with two very lucrative partnerships. If that didn’t legitimize his trip, nothing would.
Tony worked over him, moving in him again and again, ruthlessly targeting the bundle of nerves that sent lightning through his veins and behind his eyes as he rubbed himself off against the supercar, lost between the sensation of warm metal and the heavy weight of Tony’s dick plunging deep inside him. It became all too much for him and he peaked and shattered, yelling his pleasure into the darkness. He couldn’t move, braced as he was against the Saleen; all he could do was shudder and gasp through his orgasm as his cock spasmed, leaking a steady stream of come onto the hood.
The plates are trendy squares of delicate porcelain, muted gold in shade and chilled to the touch, a decadent scarlet feast painstakingly laid out before him. He’s always been a steak man, and it’s a cut any connoisseur would’ve happily murdered for—planked Châteaubriand, shaped in a heart because even undead abominations could be romantic. Bleu-rare, the meat obviously
felt tension ease up his spine and tingle in his knuckles and he drew himself up, prepared to launch into a confrontation over--what, really? Natasha prying? Natasha trying to give a damn despite his weird determination to thwart that? Was that honestly worth a fight, and why did he even
The world screeches to a halt in horror, and it’s only because of Thor frantically hauling him away and back towards Hulk that he isn’t still standing there
Tony was methodical about it too--he let Steve watch, sometimes, let Steve direct him, but left to his own devices, Tony had a pattern. He always started at the head of his dick, always used the flat of his thumb to slowly circle it, dragging precome across the slit and then down and around in longer and longer winding strokes, always went top to bottom, in a spiral until he was twisting his hand down and around until he reached the base, squeezing once, and then sliding his hand back up to the tip and repeating it all again. When it got
and there’s no choking back the sob as cool hands rest daintily on his cheeks and soft lips press a kiss to his forehead.
Steve’s tongue traced the inner whorl of his ear and chucked at Tony’s soft gasp. “Oh, I would, Stark, I would, I really want to fuck you right through the hood of this insanely expensive mid-life crisis and to the ground, but I would break you in half if I tried it right now. We don’t have the time or space or near enough lube for me to get you ready, so this is
Someone swears quietly in the background but quickly falls silent. The quickest way to set Steve off is to underestimate him, especially by insinuating he’s physically useless in a situation, and he can feel his back stiffening as his ire is raised. He’s not bulked up, but he’s got skills, and training, and experience on his side. He should be out there, and instead he has to deal with Tony trying to mollycoddle him, as if he isn’t capable of taking care of himself!
“Goddammit Tony, I don’t know what’s worse; your guilt complex or the frankly terrifying pedestal you place me on.” Tony starts to pull away again, and Steve simply crawls into his lap, ignoring the panicked gasp Tony releases. He’s staying put, and Tony’s not going to bail out on this badly needed conversation. They’re hashing this out
Steve let his hands slide down the hood of the car until he could brace his weight against the heightened ridges that housed the headlights of the car, and began to thrust back against Tony, throwing his head back as deep,
The Hydra agents they’d encountered were fast—fast enough that they seemed to blur. They were resilient and strong enough to knock Steve and Thor around like they were mere toys. The
Steve strolls into the common room’s kitchen Sunday morning like nothing is wrong, and makes himself comfortable at the table.
Tony was there in a flash, flicking the tube open with his free hand and using the glowing blue led light of his watch to provide some extra light as he sought out Steve’s hole. Once located, Tony didn’t waste time with theatrics or teasing and set about stretching Steve as much as he could. Steve was just as eager as Tony was, urging him onward as he managed to work in one finger, then another. He had to make this good for Steve.
. You and the serum? That’s just the frosting on the cake. Nice, but entirely unnecessary. The truest parts of yourself--your nobility, your kindness, your
Tony continued to urge him out of the tub, and when Steve finally worked up the will to get out, Tony was waiting for him with an extremely soft towel that he used to pat him dry before leading him back into their bedroom.
He’s leaking precome, can smell it, feel the glide of it as Tony’s movements become slicker. It’s a lot--he always had been a leaker, even before the serum--and Tony’s appreciative moans as he continues to blow him are sending frissons of pleasure all through his body, radiating out from his groin and making him leak more and more in appreciation, in anticipation.
This one has more of an edge to it, an intent that wasn’t there before. Tony steers this time, nibbling at Steve’s bottom lip, coaxing his mouth open with deeper and deeper kisses. Steve lets out a pleased hum that shifts into a gasp as cool air moves across his flushed skin. The kiss is
as Tony put just enough pressure on his prostate to send him spiraling over the edge into an orgasm.
because he’d just had his car detailed and now he had All-American jizz all over that once-pristine finish and he was going to take it out of Steve’s ass, he hadn’t come yet and Steve had better hold on because he was
silent, and Steve isn’t quite sure what’s stewing in that overactive brain of Tony’s. Judging from the shuttered expression and increasingly withdrawn body language, though, he’s got a few suspicions.
Steve jolts, loosens his grasp, and it’s enough, just enough for Tony to seize the advantage and he darts away, slips around the table and flips it over, the cacophony of breaking dishes and clattering serving trays and shattering crystal shocking him to awareness.
It didn’t take long at all, as worked up as they both were, and Steve savored a primal curl of satisfaction as Tony let out a wrecked noise and stiffened, coming in hot pulses over his hand, his cock. Steve didn’t release Tony, instead continued to twist and pump, working Tony all the way through his orgasm until he twitched and fell limp against Steve’s chest, gasping wetly.
A low growl of frustration crawls its way past his vocal cords, and Tony looks even guiltier. Thor shakes his head sadly, and Jan glares irritably at Tony. It’s maddening. Everyone knows how Tony feels, why this deliberate hedging? Does Tony think he won't reciprocate?
Tony’s eyes flickered over Steve’s posed form, taking in the various bits and pieces, namely the lack thereof. Steve had on a pair of broken-in jeans that fit him snugly in all the right places and had a ragged hole worn into one knee, to say nothing of the various rips and tears. Steve hadn’t bothered to button or zip up the jeans, leaving them hanging open low around his hips to reveal a tantalizing bulge and a thatch of coarse pale blonde hair. Steve wore absolutely nothing else except his dog tags, which were resting on the hard planes of his chest, and a towel, which was slung over his shoulder.
“It wasn’t” Tony only words, while his hand reached behind his back tracing slowly the scar, of his long lost wings.
Because he tried and tried really hard, but after more then twenty minute, of insufferable sighing and seeing that Steve didn’t turned to him, Tony just threw the book he was flipping through away, hitting the cabinet on the other side of the couch, and making the object on it fall on the floor with loud thud. Catching like that Steve attention.
The dream, the vision melted one into another, until he couldn't distinguish between them anymore. Dream vs vision, reality vs delirium.
“Mh?” mumbled Tony raising his eyes from the tablet in his hand, blinking and raising an eyebrow questioning.
“I’m not interested in the book condition Tony, but could you… mh.. please move away from me?” asked Steve, face red and moving his eyes on the other side of the room, focusing his attention back on the book, letting finally Tonys hair go.
Steve still smiling happy moved away, murmured a soft “Thank You.” and left the kitchen with an astonished Tony behind, him with his mouth open still working on what just happened.
did it for the featheruary, and i don't know, i'm just trying to write something and coming out of this huge writers block
“Also, why did you throw my book in that way Tony?” asked after another minute of complete silence looking at the the hard cover half ripped from the book itself, in a strange and detached voice.
Around fifteen minute later and a finger poking at his side, a whine and the most suffering series of sigh a human could hold, Steve turned around looking finally in Tony’s eyes, that after a little smile averted his gaze turning back to the book like nothing happened.
But that was only a dream, a beautiful dream, because Steve wasn’t there anymore. And nothing was worth anymore.
“Breath with me, slowly…” Steve soothing voice said. “It was just a dream, a bad dream.” Continued stroking Tony’s back.
“You are not me.” Tony whispered looking at the open bottle in front of him, and the full glass near.
“What?” demand the blond raising his hand in a desperate gesture, just few second before that Tony flopped on his lap burying his face in his stomach.
Steve isn’t sure how Tony ended in his room, or even in his bed, but here he is, curled on the other side of the bed snoring, on top of the bed sheet.
It’s not that he doesn’t believe in those shit about soul mates, it’s just that he believe in science. And soul mates are anything science related, but… here he was, stroking that name emended on his wrist, smiling, and looking outside at the night light.
He huffed at himself and pushed the silly thoughts from his head, turning over. It was a considerable mental struggle to turn down his brain enough for him to finally fall asleep, but eventually he managed it.
It’s two-to-two, and whoever scores next wins the game. Bets are being declared, and Tony’s locked eyes with Natasha until something else catches his attention, something just in the corner of his eye, and he looks away.
i'm so sorry this has taken so long, ishipallthings. i've been feeling pretty dissociated from this fandom for a while now, and it has been very hard to get back into the feel of it enough to write anything decent. anyway, i hope to get this finished as soon as possible, and i hope you all enjoy it :)
Tony doesn’t know what he finds surprising about this reaction, precisely, but surprising it is. Because otherwise he’d have to call it something else—like
The guy is smiling, which Tony determines to be a good sign, and he takes a small sip of the coffee. When he doesn’t say anything for a few seconds, Tony starts to panic.
After a moment the cup was taken away, and then a wet cloth was being settled over his brow. He grimaced, teeth grinding, unsure if the damp cold made him feel better or worse.
“Don’t move,” someone said, rather unnecessarily. Steve had no intention of doing anything more to upset the wound on his stomach.
Tony hums and haws—“I’m a very busy man, Bruce”—pretending to pay attention even as he knows Bruce can see right through him.
He came to with a throbbing head and a half-genuine wish that someone would just remove his entire abdomen so he wouldn’t have to
Like always, his dreams bled into nightmares, of the war, of Bucky, Peggy, the Howling Commandos, sometimes memories and sometimes occurrences that never really happened, the brutal spawnings of his overactive imagination.
—but he’s had plenty of practice in ignoring it, so Tony simply grins back and hands the guy the cup.
“Good fight,” he finishes, awkwardly, before turning and leaving. Not just the mat, but the whole damn gym. Here one second and gone the next.
Steve could practically feel the racing of his heart relax inside his chest, his muscles unclenching with hardly a conscious thought.
Frigid air nipped at his fingertips, his toes. Iciness licked at his skin, a shocking contrast to the warmth of Tony’s body pressed against his, and his teeth chattered, his limbs going numb. He was imagining it, he had to be imagining it. He hadn’t been this cold since—since…
Relief surged through Steve, knowing Tony was there and had kept his promise, even though Steve had run away from it, hadn’t wanted to burden him.
He decides to take a risk the next time the guy shows up—one, because he really likes the guy, and two, because he’s nervous that he’s on borrowed time with him, and Tony needs a bit more security than that.
The next however many hours passed Steve by in a blur. He could only remember snatches of time and conversations, while the rest was a hazy period of endless pain.
He grabs a sharpie lying next to the register and then the cup—small black, shot of blueberry, dash of vanilla—and spells out
. But he knows a thing or two about how it works, okay, the hypotheses and the experiments. He knows that sometimes you don’t get the results that you were expecting—sometimes you don’t get the results that you were
Tony doesn’t mean to stare at him. Steve’s shirt is tight, okay. Really tight. It hugs his sculpted torso, flaunting all that muscle and raw strength. He isn’t smiling, but his blue eyes are dancing, because he
“Bit unusual,” Tony mutters while he’s passing the cup to the guy. It’s a much milder judgement than he could’ve passed, certainly.
Tony places the order and tells him the price, and then there’s an awkward moment when their eyes meet while Tony slides the cup along the counter until it’s right in front of him. The guy pauses in slipping his card back in his wallet, glancing down and then back up again. His eyes are wide and—Tony can’t pinpoint why he this catches his attention, but—they’re also incredibly
So when the guy reaches the register, and greets him sweetly as he always does—although now (correctly) assuming Tony already knows his order—Tony asks for his name.
He doesn’t always know what he’s doing, and right now he’s not exactly sure what he even wants, so he’s not exactly sure what he’s going to
this. He likes a good fight, likes to expend all that pent up energy, likes how his own body can twist and turn into physically improbable shapes, can be used exactly how he needs it to be used. Tony thinks something like that will probably never not be thrilling. And he doesn’t blame him, not when he knows how Steve grew up. What his body used to be like.
Steve is standing front row next to the table and has been carefully watching the proceedings this entire time. But now he’s looking at Tony, a small smile gracing his lips, and Tony loses whatever concentration he had.
—and that’s a bit of a bummer. And then you have the option of accepting those results—maybe that even means accepting you were
Maybe it was an unfair request, and when Tony didn’t immediately respond, Steve thought that he wouldn’t say anything at all. That he wouldn’t want to make a promise he couldn’t keep.
To Tony’s surprise—and no small amount of relief—the guy comes back a couple days later. Tony whips up his usual, and this time boldly adds a little something extra.
When Thor comes in, Tony takes great pleasure in teaching him how to know when the pancake is ready to be flipped. When Nat comes in, he’s ready for her with a glass of orange juice because he knows she likes it but doesn’t usually let herself indulge. She glares disapprovingly but takes the glass nonetheless, and Tony takes it as a win.
Steve wished his head would stop pounding for long enough for him to think and be able to offer his own input. He wanted to help, but at the moment he barely understood what was going on.
“Hey, Cap.” Someone grabbed hold of his right hand. “Took a hell of a tumble, there. Scared the shit out of Barnes.”
Steve blinked, and blinked some more, but the indistinct form in front of him never changed. He could almost smile, because if his scrambled brain had to choose anyone to dream up, he was glad it was Tony.
Anyway, where was he going with this? Right, he doesn’t always know what he’s doing. And sure, you could make the argument that that’s put him in some fairly sticky situations in the past, but he’s still alive, isn’t he? Some close calls, but hey, he’s still breathing.
A month later, Tony can’t believe he still works here. It’s a slow morning, he’s bored to tears, and he sees
The last thing he could remember was the explosion. The blast had thrown him off a cliffside, sent him tumbling to a mound of snow below. His head felt like he’d knocked it into something
They fall into a fighting stance across from each other, circle for a few moments until Tony grows bored of that and strikes first, right fist flying forward. And Steve’s ready, of course, parries easily with a block and a kick, and after that it’s a dance. Tony and Steve spar like it’s a choreographed performance. Like they’ve been doing it a hundred years.
