"Four," Cas said patiently. Dean nodded. He got up, Cas silently watched him go to the loo, come back and get into bed again.
Dean pulled the Impala by the bridge. The sun was about to set, coloring everything in its golden red, the river catching its light and reflecting it back. The car was silent in anticipation, it was almost time. He was almost here. Nobody uttered a word as Dean stepped out of the car, leaning on the railing. Jack said today was the day. When they would reunite once more.
He died. He died like he always thought he would, he died hunting, he died where he began: with his brother, with Sammy, traumatising him for life, leaving him alone. He felt cold, freezing ice circulating inside his bloodstream. He started shaking and opened his eyes. Cas wasn't there. He was alone. How fitting... Was he even really here or was he just a wishful hallucination?
Their forms pressed together and Cas could feel Dean's slow heartbeat and it startled him. It actually sounded tired, slow and heavy beats and his breathing was a little off too. Cas sent off a bit of healing energy Dean's way, a sort of a soothing glow around them, but it did not seem to take.
They've never talked about this. Sam knew but he never would have thought his brother would ever admit it, not to himself and especially not to the world. Dean glanced at him and it pricked Sam's heart, the knowing that Dean was a bit wary of his reaction. "He wouldn't stop nagging," Dean said jokingly into the mirror.
After lying together for a while, the shadows got longer until the room was dunked in darkness and Dean's breathing evened out. He was asleep.
back. Was this their twisted sense of a fix? Was it really Cas at the end of the road? His heart felt constricted and it made it a little bit too hard to breathe despite the lovely air. He had no earthly idea what he would say should he really see him. The days after he was gone, they all brought him things he should have said, was supposed to say, the normal reactions, but none of it felt possible, he couldn't even utter those words to himself. He shook his head. What mattered was that he was here and the angel was somewhere close.
"So, is this heaven, 'cause-" Cas attempted to crack a joke in a hoarse voice just as Dean closed the distance again and captured his lips with a grin on his face. His mouth glided against the angel's soft lips, a familiar ache in his belly  when Cas buried his fingers in his scalp and pulled him closer. It took them a moment to find the right angle but then they did and Dean's knees almost gave out. There was some part of him whispering: it's only so good because it took you so long to get here, it's only perfect because it was inevitable. But then Castiel started to open his mouth in return, and a soft sob escaped from his throat which Dean promptly swallowed in a burning kiss. And maybe, he thought, as they started to kiss properly, kiss deeply, melting into each other, there was the simple fact that it was just that good. Because it
A few minutes in, the road began to open up, revealing a clearing with a perfect pier, as if made for peaceful fishing. A small house guarded the entrance to the forrest at the end of the clearing with a couple of bee houses on the side. The corners of Dean's lips turned upward. In front of the house, there was a pile of freshly cut lumber, a blue and green flannel shirt slung over the axe handle that was sticking in the log. The door was wide open and as if on cue, Cas walked out, his own cold beer in one hand, wiping his mouth with the other.
"Just follow that road. He's there," Bobby nodded to the other side of the lake, his eyes twinkling with softness. Dean glanced at the road. His baby was sitting in all its glory next to the lake. He smiled.
"So... where is he..." he asked matter of factly, but he could see it on Bobby's face: he understood.
He kept clinging to Dean even as they came up for air and Dean kept pressing soft kisses in his mouth. Cas felt drunk, his lips and lungs burning. They parted for a few seconds again and Cas cupped Dean's jaw before he could kiss him again and just held him in place. He wanted to just look at him, it felt like he had to make sure. That he could see the change, the newly acquired feelings on his face. They were both breathing pretty hard, Dean's lips wet and plump from kisses: a vision Cas had never seen before and had to hold himself not to devour him right this moment- so he just kept devouring him with his eyes until Dean's ears and neck turned a lovely shade of pink.
"Can't wait to hear it all, but I would really like to get to my wife now," Sam said almost longingly. It's been a while too. He hadn't realized how much he had actually missed her after that time, until he was actually on the same plane of existence as her.
Whatever was wrong with Dean it was not physical. There seemed to be something heavy on Dean's mind that was just out of reach for him.
Beer still in hand, he headed along the lake. The air was buzzing around him, in sync with his own head. Every day since the Empty took him away, he prayed to Cas, to Jack, to anything really, to help him make it right, to get
And Cas let him, he let him cry for what seemed like forever, he was crying too, tears dripping down his chin and his neck pooling on Dean's shirt and hair. He understood now. Dean was grieving. He was grieving the life he could've had. The life he allowed himself to wish for for a fleeting moment. And Cas mourned too, he mourned for the man he was holding in his arms, who he pulled out of the Hell broken at a time he was lost himself. They pieced themselves together and somewhere in between they fell in love with each other. And in some way or the other, it was over now. Cas understood. Dean needed to grieve before he could move on.
He finally pulled away, roughly taking Cas's face into his hands. The angel's eyes were watery again. His own were starting to sting too. Dean realized that this was it, his selfish moment, where he gets to have something for himself. Looking into those blue eyes he realized he needs to claim some happiness for himself too. "Let's make one thing clear, out of the two dumbasses between the two of us, you have always been the oblivious one-" a wet chuckle escaped from Cas.
Upon realizing it, he felt his heart start hammering in his chest, he was sure Cas must feel it too.
"Bobby volunteered as the flower girl," John joined shaking his head. "It was horrendous," he added with a thundering laughter.
"I have to..." He took a deep breath. "...you..." Cas started to pull away but Dean fisted the back of his t-shirt and held him in place, still unable to look him in the face. "I... I couldn't say it. Dammit I still can't say it... I am not good at..."
And while they all understandingly granted them this private reunion, as soon as it was obvious the conversation turned to them, they began to promptly spill out of the car with a loud commentary. Sam half expected them to start pushing each other like little siblings do.
"No, Sam, Dean is exaggerating as always," Cas said in his typical 'it's just Dean being silly' deep voice.
Cas was standing by the open door smiling at them softly, when Sam finally got out of the tooth-achingly sweet family reunion.
"Sammy," Mary got out first with Dean's help, placed a hand on Sam's cheek and smiled. "Welcome home." He hugged her first, then his father, who joined their foreheads and smiled. "Son," he got out emotionally.
"You're burning," Cas whispered and Dean felt himself being pulled into the angel's arms. He tried to protest but all his strenght was gone. "You're making yourself sick. Just... let me take care of you." A familiar warm energy embalmed him again, and his body stopped shaking. Cas was still here with him.
He remarked on the quality of the shitty beer but his heart wasn't in it. His whole body was waiting for the next chance to speak.
"Cas?" Bobby stopped him. "Just don't let him drive you away. It's his defense mechanism. He needs you now."
Dean's stare fell on him, he grimaced. "What time is it?" Weird, the normal Dean's reaction should be something along the lines of: "Cas, you are staring. Cut it out."
"Must have been amazing," Sam said wiping the tears that appeared from laughing as the car sped on the road to their destination. His heart was overflowing with happiness for this family he had here. They could rest now, all was well.
"Hello," he smiled and melted. This was Dean when no one was around, his affection was shy but passionate at once. He was quite physical and sexual but any sign of intimate affection and suddenly it was an unknown and scary territory for Dean.
Maybe he was not cut out for this. What if he couldn't do this? He wasn't good at this. At feelings, at communicating his desires. For too long his world turned around saving his father, his brother, the world. His mind oscilating between where is my gun and which way is the monster under the bed. His heart being constantly crushed, his mind in shambles, everyone he's ever touched kept dying on him.
He got up and turned back to Bobby. He raised the beer and nodded back to him. He'll catch up later.
Sam nodded. "Dean," he sniffed. "He has green eyes like you, he looks like dad, but is more like his mum."
time. They all knew there was a lot left unsaid between them, even some bad blood, but what they knew was that there was finally time for them to maybe try and fix it, to be a family, with nothing hanging over their heads.
Set before the Winchester brothers reunite in my last scene. Filling some necessary development before we can move to the domestic bliss and the exploration of feelings.
Castiel opened his mouth again, just as Dean finally closed the distance and crashed into him, hugging him tightly. "It's so good to see you, man." There were wood shavings in his hair and on his shirt, and he was warm and smelled of wood and of Cas and... it felt like home. Dean knew he was crushing him, but that didn't stop him from pulling him in even tighter. Castiel's hands tentatively circled his back and he began leaning into him. Head on his shoulder, chest slowly rising and falling. Dean knew the hug lasted long enough for a greeting, but he was not ready to let go. That would mean he would have to speak. He would have to address the angel's last confession.
That's when Sam finally noticed that while the shotgun seat remained empty, the backseat was pretty crowded. In this order, Mary, Cas and John were sitting crammed there, none of them exactly rejoicing over the seating arrangement. Dad was looking the other way with mock grumpiness, mum was rolling her eyes with a fond smirk, Cas was the one awkwardly sitting there with hands in his lap looking out of the car.
"After you," Dean grabbed him by the shoulders and pushed towards the Impala as the group started to squeeze into the car again. "Cas, personal space! We've talked about this," John complained with a slight shove and exasperated sigh. Dean was smiling as he started the car and Mary caressed Sam's hair again from the back seat with affection.
Dean glanced into the back mirror and Sam watched his eyes meet Castiel's in a tender and warm stare. Dean's eyes returned to the road, but Sam's fell on the ring on his finger. He looked between Dean and Cas with a corresponding one on his hand. "You didn't!" he exclaimed.
The sun was starting to set again. How long was it since he came here? Two days? Three? He pulled the blanket tightly around his shoulders but it was of no help. The chill was coming from inside him. He firmly shut his eyes and tried to imagine what warmth looked like: Sun flickering across closed eyelids. Cas. Warm hood of the Imapala. Cas. A cup of coffee. And Cas. His icy blues kept invading his thoughts, but instead of cold they made him hot all over, Castiel's soft but warm body a distant memory (or was it a memory?) Cas's hands burning a path along his jaw, whispering: "Dean, Dean." He shuddered.
He caressed the black hood and a sigh escaped his lips. Not a scratch. But there's time for that later too. His eyes were already leading him to the road curving around the lake. He felt at peace somehow. Suddenly it occurred to him: he's got nothing but time.
. he smiled. The heavy feeling in his chest, the chill of dying that has settled in his bones, the bitternes on his tongue from checking out because of a bloody nail just when he finally got his life for himself, they all subsided a bit.
He saw Dean grip the steering wheel tighter, the ends of his ears turning pink. Cas on the other hand beamed like Father Christmas, happy he finally noticed: "Ten years ago."
"It's selfish and greedy. How can I ask for anything more than this? I should be happy. You and my friends and heaven, right? You built it for me. Why am I not happy, Cas? What's wrong with me?!"
"Yeah, Eileen joined us earlier, she graciously agreed to wait for you at home, because as you can see," Dean smirked pointing to the Impala, "we were full."
I know this is not everything they deserve, they deserve an ending which does not forget the journey they went through, an ending where the universe gives them something back, an ending where Dean does not die a pointless death and gets to figure out what to do with his life on his own terms. An ending where Castiel is part of this found family they have built for themselves. And I might write it one of these days, Jack knows we all need another fix (it) to get through it.
But then Dean confessed his feelings, well in a way, in his own "Dean" way, but Cas did not care for the form. He was overjoyed. After believing for so long that his feelings were unrequited, after unsucessfully hiding them for almost a decade, it turned out Dean didn't consider him only a brother or a best friend. It was strange, trying to convince yourself that your instincts were not that far off, that the affection radiating from Dean's eyes was not a figment of your imagination after all, that those were genuine romantic feelings. It felt surreal even to Cas and surreal was his second nature.
. Sure, Cas was human now, freshly yanked from the Empty and still getting his proverbial sea legs, but he was
Dean gets the tire changed and then stands up, knees creaking, to discover that Cas isn’t standing by the Impala anymore. He scans the horizon and eventually identifies Cas’ familiar form walking towards him from the field they pulled over next to.
Because while Dean felt a bit of disappointment when he saw their new house, Cas looks…peaceful. Full of joy. He looks
They lay in silence for a little bit, until Cas finally said, “You know, this isn’t very sanitary. I’m not sure Jack has quite gotten the hang of mopping the floor.”
Cas had told him not to move the mattress without him, but once Dean managed most of the furniture without Cas’s help (and only a few scratches), he decided the mattress would be a piece of cake.
“No, it’s still crooked.” Dean fiddled with his not-so-little brother’s boutonniere. “You can’t go out there looking like a fool. It’s your wedding day.”
It’s not their first kiss, not by a long shot, but it feels new, like there’s something different here.
Sure, he grew up in tornado country, where the wailing of sirens and the uneasy calmness of the air right before one hits were all too common, and he spent his nights on the road, rain or clear skies, but that didn’t take away the fear. He only learned to push it down–
Dean’s heart rate picks up. He had been so careful, he thought, when he’d wanted to get a glimpse at Cas’s latest creative writing assignment, but clearly not, because Cas turns his laptop and the screen has a keysmash on the next line.
“Well, it’s wonderful. We can hang it up this afternoon.” Cas sets the birdhouse down on the porch and pulls Jack into his arms. “Thank you, Jack.”
“Charlie!” Kevin suddenly careens into Charlie’s office, which is in somewhat of a state of disarray thanks to packing. “Dean’s going to be on NPR.”
Jack and Dean are shoulder-to-shoulder on one of the blankets, watching the sunset, and the world around them is so quiet, the two-lane road beside them nearly deserted, that it feels a little bit like Cas has been put into a snow globe, but instead of snow there’s a riot of color and a final burst of sunshine as the sun finally dips below the horizon.
Sam’s off on a different hunt in Colorado, so it’s just Dean and Cas, which is no problem. Dean trusts Cas to watch his six, to watch everything.
“Why am I here, sir?” she asked. “I have papers to grade and lecture I’m supposed to attend tonight.”
to go, which is how he’s found himself standing awkwardly in the hallway of a random fraternity, nursing a potentially hazardous red Solo cup of jungle juice.
kissing Cas, finds that he doesn’t really want to, finds that Cas doesn’t stop him, finds himself fisting a hand in Cas’s undershirt.
“Humans.” Cas takes a long swig of beer. “This is the sort of thing that the other angels and I ignored.”
Dr. Moseley cranes her head around Cas. “And how are you, Dean? I noticed that you turned in your most recent problem set two minutes before the deadline.”
The colors are riotous, bright, happy, a cacophony of yellows and blues and whites and purples. Castiel can feel his happiness brimming over--he no longer regrets being able to feel too much.
“It’s not… Wow, Cas, thanks a lot. Didn’t realize you thought so little of me.” Dean’s voice sounds hurt, and that’s what finally makes Cas look at him again.
clever and maybe a bit forgetful and often stays up too late reading and is late to everything and incredibly empathetic and—
A few weeks later, on a Friday night, Castiel and Dean are reading in bed. They both stay in Dean’s room now (which Castiel supposes makes it
playing and a pile of tissues next to him, and Dean decides to carry him to bed and tell him about Gloria tomorrow.
Not just a drizzling rain, but a downpour, soaking them as they rush inside their apartment building with their bags, leaving wet footprints on the stairs up to the apartment.
Realizations that were about to be sleeping in the same bed as him, inches away, close enough to touch (or maybe actually touching, like last night).
Breakfast was sparse, mostly because Cas felt like if he ate too much he’d launch it all over the conference room during a presentation—theirs or someone else’s.
It takes no more convincing. Cas’s shirt slips to the ground, forgotten, as Cas’s hands find the sides of Dean’s face and pull him in. Gentle. Warm. A hand slides down to Dean’s neck instead--Dean remembers that he has arms, that he can pull Cas in even more. It’s like a fucking kiss from a movie, in his mind’s eye Dean can see the overhead shot pulling away until the happy couple is just a speck. That’s a nice way to leave it, isn’t it? They kissed, they’re happy.
Dean liked driving, liked the feeling of the road beneath him. The higher your RPMs, the higher your speed, meaning you had to switch gears, first to second and second to third and so on, and Dean loved waiting for the edge of the speed to hit, the time to change coming forward. Baby was a car he knew and she always responded.
Google helpfully informs him that the two cough medicines will work the same, so Dean goes for cherry store brand, which he thinks Cas will like better than grape, and then moves on to tissues (apparently some have lotion in them?) and cough drops (lemon and honey seem best).
alone. He’s an angel of the lord. A baby shouldn’t make him feel helpless. But it does, Jack does. Castiel is acutely aware of the way he’s not Dean.
Cas knows he should roll over, make some noise, or something to alert Dean to his wakefulness, but he likes the quiet. And he likes looking.
“So your boss really thinks Daphne did it?” Dean asked Abby. While everyone else was crowded in interrogation, he and Tim were still down in the lab, going over the footage from the convenience store again, this time with Dean watching to see if he recognized anyone else.
Dean takes Castiel to the grocery, to the hardware store, thrifting for “new” flannels, or just on a drive. He lets Castiel choose the music and leaves fruity-smelling body wash in the shower and one day Castiel finds a pair of fuzzy socks on his bedside table.
Dean zeroes in on Lorraine. He always listens with rapt attention when Cas brings up his therapist, like whatever Cas has to say about his mental health is of vital importance. It makes Cas feel...significant.
But Cas is Cas, and that’s how Dean is here now, holding his husband’s ball of yarn while Cas works on a sweater he’s making for Eileen’s birthday.
It doesn’t take long after that for things to devolve into chaos, like things always do when they all get together. Dean and Charlie get into an epic fight over the rules of Monopoly until Sam accidentally-on-purpose upends the board, Meg pays marginal attention to the game of Sorry, instead inventing a drinking game while Cas and Benny duke it out, and Charlie hopes that Cas’s spirits are at least a little higher.
Sometimes this feeling goes away when the sun fully comes up, when light floods the kitchen (painted yellow, per Cas’ request) and the rest of the house. One of their first post-Chuck priorities (minus pulling Cas topside) was moving out of the bunker.
Charlie tries to figure out what to say, and then she decides to go with honest and genuine. “It sucks,” she starts, “That your parents won’t accept you. But you’ve got another family right here. And we’re with you every step of the way.”
He looks different here, Dean’s pretty sure it’s the clothes. Pants that actually fit, Vans (does Cas skate? Dean wants to know everything about him), and a blue, short-sleeved button down, untucked, which Cas is now unbuttoning to reveal a grey undershirt. It’s also slightly beer-soaked, and it clings to his sides. Dean tries not to look.
“Sam! The book!” Dean shouted, still struggling with the witch. Sam looked down and saw it still partially wrapped in Dean’s jacket. He reached out to pick it up, getting the same shock as Dean when his hand came in contact with it.
Rowena raised an eyebrow, looking between Dean and Sam. “Not so fast. I seem to recall a book I sent you two out to retrieve for me. Did you get it?” She smiled a little, amused at their predicament.
She thrust out her hands and a burst of light came shooting towards Dean and Sam. Dean pushed Sam out of the way and took the brunt of whatever spell she cast.
“You know Cas is important to me and I care about him, but it’s different to how I care about you, right?” Dean paused to see Sam’s reaction, nervous about beginning this conversation he never thought he would have. Sam nodded, encouraging Dean to continue.
“Dammit, Sam! Stop asking me questions! You know I can’t stop.” Dean was very annoyed. Ever since calling Rowena on their way home to meet them at the bunker, Sam had asked question after question to no end. Dean had had enough. He figured out that he doesn’t just blurt out anything without prompting. If he’s being asked a question, the spell forces an answer out of him, even if he tries not to speak.
“Well, I—uh—don’t,” Dean stopped and took a deep breath, “why is this so hard?” Sam stayed silent, knowing Dean needed to get this out without interruption.
Sam looked over, just as shocked that Dean didn’t try to gloss over how he felt. Dean reached a hand up to his head and rubbed his forehead. Shaking off his surprise, he asked, “What happened with the witch? Did you grab the book?”
“Okay, okay, we get it. Now go away.” Without letting go of Cas’ hand, Dean grabbed a pillow off his bed and chucked it at Sam’s head. He disappeared from the door, and they could hear his laugh echo down the hallway.
“I know, Dean. Working helps to keep my mind off of things. Nothing to worry about.” Cas stared up at Dean still standing in front of him. A thoughtful look came over his face and he tilted his head a fraction, barely noticeable.
He’d always been good at avoiding things, but this spell was making that difficult. Dean knew that things don’t usually turn out well for them. Something always finds a way to bite them in the ass in the end, but for once there isn’t an apocalypse banging at their door. Certain things should be kept to himself. The secrets he keeps are his and his alone. He should be able to share them if he wants to, not because some spell is forcing them out of him.
Dean’s eyes darted around the garage for a moment before moving to Sam’s face. They stayed there, searching for something. Seemingly finding what he was looking for, Dean looked away once more, nodding slowly.
Dean didn’t know what was happening. He’d only just gotten the courage to confess and here Cas was beating him to the punch. He never expected Cas to have this whole big speech for him. What could he say to that? How could he possibly follow it up?
“Why don’t you want Cas to be here?” Sam asked, trying to think of where he should take this. He really wanted him to finally talk about his feelings, for Cas or otherwise.
“Are you okay? Sam called me but didn’t explain anything. What happened?” Cas had no problem getting right to the point. The candor was nice. It was a trait of his he never lost over the years, not that Dean would ever want him to.
“Yes. I think I’m getting better at making pancakes, I didn’t set anything on fire this time.” Dean laughed, feeling warm affection for the angel bubble up in his chest. “Thanks, Sunshine.” Dean leaned forward and kissed Cas softly before sitting up to eat. Cas snuggled deeper into his pillow, a small smile upon his face as he looked at Dean.
Dean springs up from the bench seat, pushing past the other partygoers (he says a little hope for Rebecca’s plants), and heads through the house. All it takes is one glance around the living room and kitchen to see that Cas is gone (Dean doubts he went into one of the bedrooms to do a little horizontal cuddling).
Dean picks Cas up behind the student union a little after noon, like they’d planned, and as far as Cas can tell, nothing is different.
Instead of an annoyed customer in front of Bobby’s auto shop, Cas is standing outside, scrolling through something on his phone. When he hears Dean’s footsteps, he looks up, his face brightening.
He turns to the dresser and pulls out the second drawer, where Dean keeps his t-shirts and flannels, rummaging through until he finds a red-and-brown one, one of Dean’s favorites. Castiel slips it over his pajama shirt and buttons it up before turning to the crib again.
“Why did you agree to visit him?” Cas finally asks Dean, who rolls over and turns out the light. “Dean.” Cas tries again.
Dean smiled wide and pulled Cas in by his trench coat for a kiss. Their lips met and they melted into each other, all the tension leaving their bodies. After what felt like hours, but could only have been a minute or two, they broke apart. Smiling, they leaned their foreheads together and laughed slightly.
Dean laughed, reaching for the book. As soon as he touched it, a sharp zap ran up his arm and he jerked his hand away.
“I always believed that the one thing I want, was something I could never have. And I was okay with that. For a long time, I was perfectly content with the way things were. But now, I can’t let you go on thinking you can’t be loved. You’ve never seen yourself clearly Dean. You are filled with so much love for the people around you. Everyone around you can see it. And ever since I pulled you from Hell, I could see it too. I’ve been changed irrevocably, never the same as I was.”
“Then why didn’t you wake up and get out of here?” Dean looked at him incredulously, “Why do you think? We are finally free from Chuck, our lives are our own, but Cas is still gone. Jack brought everyone back, everyone but Cas and I, I can’t do it anymore man.” Dean’s voice breaks at the end. He looks down, he can’t bear to look his brother in the eye.
Dean saw the look on his brother’s face and rolled his eyes. He punched Sam on the arm and started back towards the car. Calling over his shoulder, “C’mon, let’s get home. I’ve got a hot date I need to get ready for!” Dean smiled as he said it, genuinely happy for the first time in a long time. Maybe getting hit with a witch’s spell wasn’t so bad after all.
Dean slammed the door of the bunker open, rushing down the stairs to the library where he could see Rowena waiting for them. He could hear Sam laughing, following behind him.
“Dean you can’t stay here.” He whispered. Dean’s eyes turned sad and he covered Cas’ hands with his own. “I can’t Cas, I can’t lose you again. If I wake up, you’ll be gone, and I can’t live like that. If its not this hunt, it’ll just be some other one.” His voice was thick with tears. Dean looked into Cas’ blue eyes and wanted to stay here forever. Cas smiled at him, holding back tears of his own.
“I think the spell is making me tell the truth. I tried to say one thing, but something else came out.” Dean finally answered.
“Oh, the man has jokes now, does he? Well, you’re crazy if you think I have any intention of letting you go now that I’ve got you. Seeing you go before was hard enough, it’s not happening again.” Dean’s tone was teasing, but Cas could see his eyes were serious.
Dean looked away from the angel, unable to speak. He was still feeling vulnerable from his interrupted talk with Sam and didn’t know what to say.
Sam reached into the bag he had slung over his shoulder, pulling out the book. It was still wrapped in Dean’s jacket so as not to zap them. Rowena took the bundle and uncovered the book, leaving the coat still in between it and herself. Hovering her hand over the book, she spoke something too quiet for Sam and Dean to hear. The book glowed faintly, and a shimmer came over it for a moment before dissipating. Rowena dropped Dean’s jacket onto the library table and stowed the book away in her own bag.
“Hey,” Sam leaned against the car next to Dean, “I’m sorry about this morning, I didn’t mean to catch you off guard.” He hadn’t given much thought to how this had affected Dean, but knew some things need to be talked about.
“No.” Cas slowly got up, his angel blade sliding into his hand and walked towards the door. Dean followed close behind grabbing the knife he was using to cook. Though they had been retired for a few years and had not been constantly in danger, some things never change. Cas unlocked the door and opened it carefully, revealing a familiar face. “Sam?” Dean wasn’t expecting to see his brother standing at his door in the middle of the night. “What are you doing here?”
Sam walked into the kitchen looking for Dean. He found him sitting on the counter finishing up whatever he had made for himself.
They both laughed, the tension leaving the room. In sync, they leaned in for another kiss, smiling and softly laughing into each other’s mouths. Happily basking in the presence of one another. They broke apart, whispered ‘I love you’s passed between them, unable to stop saying it once the fear surrounding it was gone.
The third time they hold hands, it’s because they’re out at a bar after a long day of research and there’s this guy who keeps hitting on Cas and he’s being way too pushy. Cas glances at Dean, uncomfortable, and Dean swoops in, grabbing Cas and pulling him away. So what if they stay pressed up close together in a corner booth for longer than’s strictly necessary afterwards?
After not having to work for over a decade thanks to his grace, Cas’ immune system had fallen behind, and it didn’t occur to any of the bunker’s residents that the former angel might need a flu vaccine until Cas was curled up pitifully on the couch, his nose streaming and a fever raging.
“How about we go make some hot chocolate?” Cas bends down to scoop Jack up into his arms, noting with a creak of his knees that he’s not as young as he used to be. He also knows that he’ll probably regret sugary two-in-the-morning hot chocolate later, but right now, he just wants Jack to feel safe.
If there were truly a barrier between the heavens and the earth, if it were impossible for fallen angels to return, if the stars were truly fixed
“Typically?” Dean’s hunting for some cups. “Bunch of Hawaiian Punch. Sprite. Fruit pieces. Shit-ton of alcohol.” There are the cups. “Everclear, vodka, rum, gin, whatever. But here? Who knows.” He turns and takes a look over the tub. “Surprised no one’s dropped underwear in it yet.”
Chris apparently got into grief counseling because his brother died in a playground accident when they were children, and then as an adult he realized that he never got over it. Cas has heard this story about Chris’s brother Michael every year that he’s been in grief group, but it never fails to make his chest feel tight.
was his angelic nature, his powers, his vastness. Now, he’s just as big as you can see him. Now he’s not really Castiel, not anymore, not ever. Now the feeble remainder of his grace lives in a squat mason jar, pint-sized, tucked into his and Dean’s sock drawer.
Cas is trying to adjust to being human-ish, but it hasn’t been easy. It takes forever to get anywhere and he’s always so
“I brought a little something when we did the final walk-through,” Cas replies, pulling a bottle and a bag out of the cabinet. From this far, Dean can’t see what it is, but as Cas walks closer, he gets an idea.
There’s a tiny maple sapling here that Cas found on a walk a month ago. He’s been watching it weather the changes in seasons and temperature, hoping it would survive the unexpected frost last week.
“Lorraine says that I have to find ways to not always blame myself. I mean...this is an extreme example, saying that I shouldn’t worry about hurting him, I should feel justified because he hurt me.”
(New people. Plus the whole gay thing. Cas knows that if he tugged on Dean’s hand right now and said he wanted to leave, they’d go, but Dean is having a good time.)
The spell takes ashes (Cas’s, and Dean’s chest aches as he pours them into the dinged-up metal bowl Claire brought, because what if this doesn’t work and all he’ll have left is a bloody handprint?) and blood (Dean’s) and some ingredients Sam supplied from the bunker’s stores.
(For instance, Cas lost his toothbrush every single night of the first hunt they had gone on post-him returning topside, and Dean decided it was probably best to just bring some extras. Or that one time they tried to have some fun in backseat of the Impala, only to discover that Cas had somehow lost the condoms. They still haven’t found them.)
Dean had written, angling his paper towards Cas, and then Cas had drawn a truly horrible milk carton underneath it, and Dean nearly had to stuff his fist in his mouth to keep from laughing. From then on, they always passed notes.
The next morning, Castiel awakens alone in his chambers and dresses slowly. He has no idea what he’s going to do today--will Elder come to see him? Will he while the hours away into quiet oblivion?
Maybe it’s weird that Dean is at his happiest buying eggs and milk and that one kind of cheese Sam is really into right now with a former wavelength of celestial intent who also happens to be his boyfriend, but if it is, then Dean doesn’t care.
He likes to be transparent with Lorraine so that she can really help him, but speaking aloud about this seems like a new kind of terrifying. Sure, he had a brief conversation with Meg about it, but Meg knows Cas well enough that she doesn’t prod, even if she’s been giving them meaningful looks, and she’s also not a therapist, so she doesn’t ask questions that completely unzip Cas.
Castiel laughs. “I don’t know how to tie a tie, Charlie. Dean usually does it for me but, in case you forgot, he was in space for the past six months.”
“Okay,” Dean sits back on his heels but doesn’t take his hand off Cas’s shoulder. “Why won’t he wake up?”
Now Cas was alone, in his room in the bunker. It was empty, save the furniture, and he was lying under the blankets Dean had offered after a rousing evening with him, Sam, Eileen, and Jack. It was good to be here, especially after dying for what he thought was one last time.
Dean nods. He’s sure that he’ll say something stupid if he opens his mouth, and since it’s pouring down rain there’s nowhere to escape to but his room, which definitely won’t be far enough away.
(To be fair, neither of them anticipated what it would be like to have a toddler, a petulant eleven-year-old, and a moody high schooler all at the same time.)
Dean sits up with a jolt, though, when he hears keys in the front door, and then quiet footsteps. There’s the rustling of a plastic bag–presumably whatever Cas got at the craft fair (the last time he and Charlie went to one, Cas got a giant crocheted cow for Jack), and then the feeling of a kiss on the top of his head. Dean leans his head up to see his husband standing over him.
The service isn’t so bad–the flower arrangements and stained glass in the church are pretty, and Cas gets really into the organ and hymns, which is nice to watch. Dean fully zones out during the sermon, although he briefly wonders what the priest would think if he knew that a member of his congregation used to be an angel.
This time around, Cas has noticed, Dean is really gung-ho about giving him the “true human experience.” Maybe it’s to make up for the last time he was human, but Cas would argue that Dean going to the Empty (where no human has gone before) and dragging him out (which no anything, human or otherwise, has done before) and then kissing him silly (Cas has been kissed, but never the way Dean kisses him, like Cas is one of the seven wonders of the world) (that list of wonders is wrong anyways, because there are no animals on it) is repayment enough.
“I’m not giving up,” he practically growls at her when she enters lab 32A, Kevin’s personal favorite. “I’m going to figure it out.”
“Good.” Dean wants to push Cas’s mouth open with his own, but he’s pretty sure neither of them will make it home if that happens.
to be asleep right now (long weeks at the auto shop always knock him out), he pulls himself out of bed and pads around to the other side of his bed, where Jack is standing, poking Cas’ face.
Dean’s bad Valentine’s-themed mood had only worsened as the week leading up to it had progressed, Cas had noted. It didn’t help that Sam had snagged a date for tonight.
), Jack begged for hot chocolate and Dean was, as usual when it came to their son, powerless to say no. While Dean started heating up milk on the stove, Cas went into their living room and turned on the fireplace. Their house was getting on in years, and it could be quite drafty and cold in the winter, especially on a snow day.
“Fuck,” Dean muttered to himself. He couldn’t see Chuck’s police car in his rearview mirror, but if he could hear it, then it wasn’t far behind them, and
“Dumb sonofabitch,” Dean watches a phantom version of himself say–an echo. “I carried that around for a year,” he adds, in his own voice, and then the scene changes to Dean, lying in bed and jolting up at the sight of Cas’s face in a window.
“Nah.” Dean stepped into his room, shutting the door with a soft click. “Just couldn’t sleep and wanted to check on you, first night of being human and all.” Dean sat on the edge of his bed, and Cas felt the mattress sink. “You okay?”
And Dean? He’s happy to just walk up to the beekeeper’s tent and sling an arm around Cas’s waist and watch.
Eventually, they’ll make some breakfast and figure out what to do today–another hike, maybe some fishing if it doesn’t rain. They need to find a spot of cell service, too, to let Sam and Eileen know they’re fine. Maybe they’ll move their tent. Or not.
He owed a lot to the first place that had felt like home in a long time, but it was nice to look out his back window and see storm clouds gathering and barbecue on the back deck and pile his family onto their squashy couches and watch movies with the fireplace roaring.
movies and made Dean watch them–and they weren’t actually that bad. Of course, Dean doesn’t think that all the exhibits will
Because right now, it’s Cas in the passenger’s seat, reading a book he found at a yard sale (Dean’s pretty sure it’s an old Hardy Boys novel, based on the cracked blue spine), the late afternoon sunlight casting a pleasant glow over his features.
Dean’s voice is a low whisper. “I don’t wanna put words in your mouth, Cas. You gotta tell me what you want.”
“You can’t drown the other kids,” Bobby says sternly in the truck, a dripping-wet Dean in the passengers seat.
and that’s Cas’ tongue, tentatively exploring, and then not-so-tentatively exploring, and Dean’s pretty sure he might explode.
Cas had wandered back to bed after that, face wet with tears, and had found when he returned that Dean had taken his pillow and was holding onto it for dear life.
Charlie hears Dean’s laugh, familiar thanks to all the time she’d spent hovering outside Castiel’s office in the past six months. “I’m good. It’s nice to be back on the ground again.”
The next morning, Sam pulls himself out of bed so that he can have breakfast before his nine am class--psychology--and notices that the TV in the living room is still on.
here, in his car, eyes shining at a dilapidated lake house, like he somehow won the fucking lottery by getting to hold Dean’s hand across the bench seat and drive to this place.
Cas can feel two things--he can feel Dean, always the center of his universe, even when they’re not touching like this (Cas would be happy if they were still kissing next to the fridge, if they were still squished together on the couch, but now that he’s had this, he wants
“Jesus.” Claire laughs. “This is why I never call you, Dean. Nothing’s wrong. Cas just won’t answer his phone and I wanted to know if you guys wanted to visit us this weekend.”
After that, Dean starts to find things for Castiel to do constantly. He needs help folding laundry or doing the dishes at least once a day. Or he’s dragging Castiel into the kitchen to help him make lunch for everyone. Or he “needs” Castiel’s help in the garage with something on the Impala.
“Get out of the truck,” Bobby says after skidding into the drive, and then he gestures for Dean to follow him into the house.
Castiel whipped around, before seeing that the voice came from a young man with an NCIS badge clipped to his belt. He recognized him as the agent who had brought Sam in.
Normally Dean would tell anyone who said they “understood” him to shove it, but this is Cas, and Cas has literally held his soul, so he does know everything. Dean doesn’t have to tell him this shit–Cas
Dean deftly rolls the condom down, and then he’s back on Cas, and the heat slows down while Dean kisses him.
“S’my parents.” Dean normally doesn’t say this kinda stuff to someone he doesn’t know that well, but he
“Then it’s a date,” Dean says, taking the book being offered to him and walking down the hall to his classroom.
Not the normal things, no. It would make sense if Cas left his toothbrush or a pair of boxers or half of a set of gloves, but if it made sense, it wouldn’t be Cas. Instead, Cas leaves half-finished sketches of flowers (always on pieces of Dean’s graph paper that Cas stole), origami animals that he’s made out of gum wrappers and other small trash, and, once, a DVD of Alfred Hitchcock’s
Soon they’ll have to go inside–the bugs are out, and Dean has been waging an ongoing war with the chiggers that has insofar been unsuccessful. But for now, Dean is content to finish his beer with Cas by his side and the recent memories of a day with family close at hand.
“I…” Cas swallowed. He couldn’t admit to Dean how he was feeling, especially when Dean hadn’t mentioned the confession at all–a clear rejection, the Dean version of a nice let-down. And it was fine.
“Like a brother. Yeah, I get it.” Cas’ shoulders sag and he turns into their apartment. “Have a good time at the store.”
“You’re no fun,” Dean says. “I did the interview in the parking lot and came to help pack, unless you want to finish up this whole office by yourself.”
“You can just call me Castiel.” Elder already strikes Castiel as the sort of person who is used to getting what he wants through a clever combination of flirting and being generally insufferable.
“Yeah, Cas. You’ve…you’ve got all the symptoms. And apparently I’m not doing so hot, either.” Dean swallows audibly. “You deserve to be happy, Cas. And if living down here is just making things worse, we should move.”
“Oh, a lot of herbs, small vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers…” Castiel takes a sip of his beer, wipes away the foam mustache from the head on the back of his hand. “And lettuce.
Of course, they’d still be going on hunts and getting covered in graveyard dirt or ghoul guts or other shit, but they’d also grill out and work in their garden and go on dates to the crappy movie theater in Lebanon and do a hell of a lot of this–just being close to each other. And happy.
“You don’t know what it means? Really?” Meg shakes her head. “He likes you, Cas. In fact, if Dean isn’t actively in love with you, I’ll proposition Ruby.”
“Is that seat next to you open, Castiel?” she asks, and Cas nods. He and Dean both stand up to let Dr. Moseley through, and she settles herself into her seat before pointing at Cas’ nametag. “Or should I say...Mr. Novak from Washington University?”
Eileen is holding a bottle of wine, and everyone exchanges hugs before Dean looks at Cas and says, “Why don’t we put that in the kitchen?”
“Hey, buddy,” Dean says, smoothing back Jack’s hair, “Do you want to help Daddy crack some eggs?” If Jack’s not going to go back to sleep, Dean may as well distract him.
“What, in the car?” Dean shifts the Impala into park and cranes his head to look at Jack in the backseat.
“Cas, c’mere!” Dean shouts from up ahead, and Cas lets out a sigh, catching up with him. He’s about to make a snarky joke (Dean tells him he’s been getting funnier) when the view makes him stop short.
Dean looks, so before he can fully think out what he’s doing, he’s standing up and then leaning over Dean’s chair, his face inches from Dean’s.
“Or somewhere in the middle.” Dean shrugs. “I like happy endings, though. Movies where I know the bad guy’s gonna lose.”
Ash’s parties are usually a little much for Dean, so he’s spent a fair amount of time scoping out the best places to get some quiet, and one of them is the sunroom. As far as Dean can guess, Ash himself doesn’t spend much time in the sunroom, but his hippie roommate, Rebecca (Dean can never tell if they’re dating or not), loves plants, so the place is chock-full. When Dean pushes the door open with a creak, it smells distinctly of sage.
He raises his hand to show Dean, and that’s all the indication Dean needs. “Cas, really? What if it runs out?”
And maybe it’s a good thing he didn’t realize it until now, because otherwise he wouldn’t have gotten a first kiss in the rain, car horns honking, other pedestrians pushing past, lips chilled but quickly turning warm.
Castiel may not sleep, but he does sink into a fairly deep meditative state in the quiet darkness of Dean’s room. He “comes to” an indeterminate amount of time later to see that the room is empty, save him, and that all the bottles and trash are gone.
“Don’t ever change,” Dean says, and Cas kisses him back, and he’s pretty sure that whatever Danny and Sandy felt for each other in
Dean sighs and reaches around to unclip it. “Alright. But you have to put it back on again when we’re outside. I’ll loosen the strap, okay?”
The taller one, in the shorter dress, smiles at them and then gives Dean a one-over. The other woman just looks away shyly, which is sort of what Cas feels like doing.
“I’ve tried to grow that,” Castiel says, shaking his head, “But my dog, Miracle, just keeps digging it up. I’m trying to get her to be better about digging, but it’s a process.”
“You can hand me that, though,” Dean says, pointing to the new oil filter next to Cas. “Gotta replace the old one.”
“Is there anything else,” Gibbs asked, “That we might need to know about your brother? Anything could be the key to uncovering who did this.”
So quiet that Cas can register the footsteps behind him, the ever-so-slight sound of feet sinking into the sand. He doesn’t bother to look over as Dean sits down next to him on the ground–because of course it’s Dean.
Cas greets him with a kiss at the porch–he still has to skip one of the steps up because it’s rotted out, Dean really needs to fix that–and then protests at a need for shoes–
Cas takes a handful of Dean’s t-shirt and is about to lean in when Dean stops him with a hand to his chest.
“Another day gone,” Dean starts. “Sam and I did some research for a case today–vampires or something. He’s really keen on going, it’s in Ohio, but I think I’m gonna sit this one out. I’m–Cas, I’m tired.”
Now, they’re standing outside the room, waiting for the projector to be set up, and Cas is all kinds of jittery.
Cas remembers being scared out of his mind--a group of new people and personal conversations all at once kind of seemed like his worst nightmare at the time.
“Maybe whatever the witch hit you with affected you more than we realized? What do both times have in common? We can figure out what it does and try to reverse it.” Sam asked, already in research mode. Whatever spell the witch cast should have ended when she died, so why is it still working?
Weeks went by before anything strange happened once more. A knock at the door just before dinner surprised both Dean and Cas. Dean looked over at Cas “Were you expecting anyone?”
They ate in silence after that, both seemingly lost in thought. When he was done, Sam left to call Eileen since Dean wasn’t exactly in the mood to talk anymore. Dean rolled his eyes seeing his brother leave, knowing he was calling his girlfriend to gossip all about him. At least that way, Sam’s talking to her and not asking Dean anymore questions he’d have to answer. Dean, on the other hand, decided it was a good time to work on Baby. It had been awhile and he didn’t want to have any problems while out on a hunt. He smiled to himself and left the kitchen, heading towards the garage.
Jack smiled once more, not answering Dean’s questions. He simply snapped his fingers and a figure in an oh so familiar trench coat appeared in front of them. Not noticing his surroundings at first, Cas spoke. “Jack, I’ve told you not to just summon someone without warning again. What do you need?”
“I don’t know how long I was in the Empty, but eventually Jack arrived. He told me what finally happened with Chuck and said he needed my help rebuilding heaven.” Cas was nervous, unsure of Dean’s reaction.
“Ok, I’ll be honest—” Dean broke off seeing Sam trying to hold back a laugh, “Haha, alright, laugh it up. Anyway, I’m fine. I wouldn’t talk about some things and the spell forced it out of me. I let you ask me those questions. Maybe it was the only way. It might have been a different story if I decided to tell you on my own at some point, but it’s good that you know.”
“Stay. Don’t leave. I—We want you to stay.” Dean could feel Sam’s eyes on him, burning a hole in the back of his head. He ignored his brother, keeping his gaze locked with Cas, trying to convey his seriousness without saying anything more that could embarrass him.
“Okay. I’m going to say something you might not like. I need you to not interrupt until I’m done. Can you do that?” Cas’ tone completely shifted, becoming very serious. Dean nodded, rendered speechless but curious about what Cas was about to say. His heartbeat faster, a steady roar making him almost uncomfortably aware of every part of his body. Maybe… No, Dean brushed that hope away before it could even take form. Lest it consume his every thought.
“Yes, desperately.” Dean’s eyes widened, surprised. He paused, stunned for a moment before coming back to himself. Sam made a motion for him to continue, not asking anything. Allowing Dean the option to refuse if he really didn’t want to, no matter what the spell thought. Dean took a deep breath in and out before he continued.
“Why are you in my home?” The witch was too focused on Sam to see Dean come in. He rushed over and tackled her, taking her attention away from Sam and dropping the book in the process. With her focus on Dean, Sam could now move. He stumbled away from the wall and scrambled to find his gun.
Dean pulled away and cleared his throat, “Okay, what’s your last question?” he spoke quickly, still a bit embarrassed from the last one. He was nervous, what would Sam ask now?
“Oh, well, I…” Cas didn’t know what to do. Sam wanted him to stay, to help if something happened or even research more about the spell. The bunker was full of books, maybe there’s something they missed. It would be good to have another person looking through everything. On the other hand, Dean didn’t seem comfortable with him here. Maybe it would be better if he just left. After all, there wasn’t anything else he could really do that Sam and Dean couldn’t do themselves.
“I didn’t say anything before because I didn’t think it mattered. I’m still not sure if it does, but Sam convinced me that not knowing would be worse.” Cas’ eyes were unfocused, mind presumably on his conversation with Sam. The mention of Sam made Dean’s breath catch in his throat. Did Sam tell Cas how he felt? What was he about to say? Was everything about to be ruined? It felt like a weight was sitting on Dean’s chest, crushing his lungs making it hard to breathe.
Dean paused in what he was doing, grabbing the rag over his shoulder to wipe off his hands. He saw Sam’s face and sighed, turning to him fully, “I’m fine. It just surprised me is all. Sometimes I’m not even sure what the truth is, so it’s a little jarring to hear it. I’m glad it only reacts to direct questions and things can mostly stay the same. I just need to stay here until it wears off and don’t interact with anyone else.” Dean moved back around, leaning back under the hood of the car and returned to working on the engine.
She raised an eyebrow unimpressed, “You wanted the bad news first, didn’t you? I’m a little insulted. Did you really think I wouldn’t know about it? I mean, the witch you two dealt with was weak to say the least. I could have gotten the book myself no problem, but I didn’t want to get my hands dirty.” She winked and started to head for the door, her bag slung over her shoulder, “Have fun spilling a few secrets for the next couple days, Dean. Wish I could stay, would love to pick your brain, but I’ve got to run. People to see, spells to cast, work never ends. Goodbye boys.” And with one last smile, she walked out the door.
“What? No. Sam’s talking nonsense, everything’s fine.” Dean tried to reassure him, but Cas knew him too well to be fooled so easily. Cas looks over to Sam for an answer. “Look Cas, none of this is real, Dean got caught by a djinn we were hunting, I came into the dream to convince him to wake up. If he doesn’t leave, he will die.” Cas’ quick breath in was only caught because Dean was already standing so close to him.” Dean?” Cas looked back at Dean and saw the resigned look on his face. Knowing then that Sam was telling the truth. Cas put his hands on both sides of Dean’s face, making him look at him.
“I still like women, okay? That never changed, don’t get me wrong. I just might also like guys?” Dean blurted out, his heartbeat loud in his head.
Cas let out a startled laugh. It was a bit shaky at first, still recovering from his tears earlier, but steadily grew stronger as he processed that Dean did in fact reciprocate his feelings. Ending his laughter, Cas surprised him by drawing Dean into a hug. He pressed his face into Dean’s neck, reveling in the feeling of Dean’s arms embracing him in return.
Cas, still sitting on the bed, reached up and grabbed Dean’s hand, lacing their fingers together. Dean squeezed his hand without looking over, embarrassment colored his cheeks a light pink.
“I didn’t tell him about the spell. I figured it would be better explained in person.” Sam quietly took note of Dean’s reaction.
Sam came following behind, still chuckling. Dean glared at him, walking over to stand in front of Rowena. “Please tell me you can reverse this. Sam’s been unbearable, I can’t stand it anymore.” He pleaded.
Cas took a few steps toward Dean until he was standing right in front of him. He squinted his eyes for a moment and raised a hand up to Dean’s face.
“Dean, when I first got out, the first thing I wanted to do was see you. But I was worried about your reaction. The last time I was here I told you I love you, and I didn’t think you’d want to see me.” Cas looked away from Dean, unable to look in his eyes and see rejection. Hearing it would be bad enough.
Cas appeared stunned, a glimmer of hope on his face. He exhaled deeply, a smile steadily growing as he waited for Dean to continue.
“Hey, are you okay?” Cas quickly sat up and put a hand on his shoulder. Dean looked up at Cas and a wave of calm settled over him and he smiled, forgetting all about his dream and the strange feelings that came with it.
Hours later, Sam wandered into the garage looking for Dean. He found him leaning over the impala’s engine, grease on his hands and a towel thrown over his shoulder.
“Yeah, right. Do you think I don’t know who you two are? The famous Winchesters. Now, tell me, how did you find me and what do you want with my book?” She paused and when neither Sam nor Dean replied, shouted, “
“Why didn’t you come see us after you got out? We thought you were dead and never coming back! Don’t you think we should have known you were alive?” Dean was hurt. Why would Cas let everyone think he was dead?
Sam’s eyes darted between the two. They were still staring and even Sam was a little shocked Dean had spoken up. He thought it would take more convincing on his part to get Cas to stick around. Maybe this time he could convince Dean to talk to Cas about his feelings.
“Not long,” Sam said, amusement clear on his face, “but long enough to know Jody and Donna owe me money. Thanks lovebirds.”
“Man, you sure know how to make a heartfelt speech,” Dean took an unsteady breath. “God, I wish I was better at this stuff.”
Dean didn’t get much sleep that night. Granted, he doesn’t get a lot of sleep most nights, but it was different now. An almost sort of unease sat in his chest, making sleep an elusive dream. Any rest he did managed to get was interrupted by nightmares. The spell was a non-issue for him so early in the morning. Sam and Rowena were the only ones to know about the spell, so avoiding questions shouldn’t be too difficult. Dean even forgot about it for the first few hours of the day. He was in the kitchen, finishing up a cup of coffee while making breakfast when Sam came walking in. He poured himself a coffee, sat down at the kitchen table, and nonchalantly asked Dean how he slept. Dean winced for a moment, the compulsory nature of the spell forcing an answer he didn’t want to give.
Dean waited a moment to see if an answer would be forced out of him. When nothing happened, he let out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding. “No.”
“Can I speak now?” Dean cleared his throat, wiping away the tear from his cheek. Cas nodded slowly, not saying anything.
Dean swallowed nervously, once more caught in Cas’ intense stare. It had been a while since they had been this close. Close enough that Dean could see all the different shades of blue in Cas’ eyes. His own eyes roamed the angel’s face, committing every detail to memory. He did this whenever he could, realizing it wouldn’t be long before Cas took off again and Dean didn’t know when he’d see him next. Still looking at Dean, Cas’ eyes were a little hazy, seeing something neither Dean nor Sam could see. After a moment, Cas tilted his head and his eyes cleared, refocusing on Dean’s face. Dean took a shuddering breath, immediately forgetting what he was thinking. He didn't know how long they stood there staring at each other before Sam spoke up.
“What are you talking about? What are you returning?” Dean was very confused. What could Jack have taken that needed to be returned? He looked over at Sam, only to see him already watching him, wide-eyed having figured out what Jack is talking about.
“We already had Rowena look at it, but she said she couldn’t remove it before it wears off on its own. Maybe you know something she didn’t?” Dean looked at Cas, his eyes full of hope, pleading for Cas to have an answer.
It was Dean who looked away this time. The tips of his ears turning pink. Cas thought it was adorable.
“No,” Dean interrupted “let me say this before I lose my nerve. Please.” His voice broke slightly at the plea. He cleared his throat before continuing.
Sam reached over and pulled Dean into a hug, “Thank you for telling me, I know it had to have been difficult, even with the spell.”
If anything, Sam appeared to deflate and look even more sad. He grabbed Dean by the shoulders and made him look him in the eyes.
They had tracked the witch to this house, Dean going off to search for the book while Sam was lookout in case the witch came back before they left. He came to the last drawer in the desk, pulling on it only to find it locked. He easily broke the lock and pulled the drawer open to reveal the book they were looking for.
Dean and Sam looked at each other in worry. If one of the most powerful witches says she can’t remove this spell, is there anything they could do?
“Shit. I was hoping you forgot.” Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. It didn’t help to settle the sudden anxiety he felt at the thought of Sam’s last question.
Dean looked down at the table, avoiding Sam’s eyes. Sam stared at him incredulously. Did he really just say that?
“Oh, thank god. I don’t know how many more questions I can handle.” Dean was relieved. Maybe he could get through today without anymore secrets being spilled.
His memory of the fight was a bit fuzzy after he took that blast of magic. He was just glad that it was him hurt and not his brother. Even though he’s all grown up, Sam is still his little brother and he’ll make sure he’s safe.
They both stopped and looked at each other. Neither spoke again, still in shock. Dean never thought he’d see Cas again. His heart beat loudly in his chest, his hand shook slightly against Cas’ face. Cas reached up and took Dean’s hand and held it in between both of his.
“I’ll ask you tomorrow. Goodnight Dean.” He swiftly got up, grabbed the book he was reading and headed toward his room. Dean watched him go, unsure of what had just happened. What was bothering Cas? And why couldn’t he tell him now? What’s so special about tomorrow?
“Sam we weren’t expecting you until tomorrow. Is Eileen with you?” Cas asked, looking around Sam for the other hunter. He put his blade away and stepped to the side to let Sam inside. “What? Eileen? No, I need to talk to Dean.” Sam looked surprise at the mention of Eileen, but quickly shook it off. He looked a bit rattled even just standing here in their living room.
Dean smiled, rubbing his thumbs over the back of Cas’ hands. “I’d be surprised if he hadn’t called Eileen immediately. Besides, I wouldn’t be able to hide this even if I wanted to. It would save us from having to do it at least.”
Cas’ shoulders dropped from their tense position and almost collapsed onto the bed next to Dean. He all but looked like a marionette that had its strings cut. He sat there for a moment before letting out a breath and getting back up.
“Well then, now that that’s taken care of, let’s see what I can do for you boys. Dean, you seem to have found yourself in a bit of a predicament, haven’t you?” She turned to face the boys, a smile on her lips. It wasn’t often that they called her for non-apocalyptic emergencies. This was an entertaining change of pace for her. “So, good news and bad news, which would you like first?”
He turned back to Dean, watching his face intensely. He couldn’t sense anything different with Dean when he walked in. However, now that he’s looking for something, a faint glow was emanating from him, centering around his head. Cas had missed it initially due to the fact that Dean always had a glow to him. His soul was still the brightest Cas had ever seen. Over the years, things in their lives had worked hard to diminish and tarnish that light. And yet, every time Cas sees him it’s just as bright as the first. Ever since he pulled Dean from Hell, Cas has admired how brightly Dean’s soul radiated.
Dean raised an eyebrow at him and smirked. He looked away from Cas for a moment and laughed before returning his attention to the angel.
“Please, listen to me. I’m not making this up, this is a dream, you’re dying, and I need you to wake up.” Dean closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath before opening them again and giving Sam a long look. “You… you already know, don’t you?” It was quiet for a moment, just the sounds of Cas in the kitchen. Den looked towards the kitchen where Cas was and felt his heart break all over again. Every time he lost Cas hurt more and more each time. The Empty taking Cas was his final straw. He couldn’t lose him again, even if it was a dream.
“You’re my best friend, Cas. We’ve known each other for so long that I feel you know me better than anyone, even Sam sometimes. And for a long time that scared me. That one person could mean so much to you that losing them felt like dying. So, I pushed it away and ignored it all. Anything to make that inevitable loss easier. But it didn’t work, every time you were gone hurt more than the last.”
. You know, better than anyone else, that he wouldn’t take advantage of this situation.” Sam felt a little bad for doing just that, but quickly moved past it knowing he would’ve gotten no reprieve if the roles were reversed. After all, it’s his job to be a pain in the neck for Dean.
Sam got up and left the kitchen, leaving Dean to think about his words. What if Sam was wrong? He wouldn’t be able to handle it if lost Cas over something as stupid as his feelings. But then again, what if he was right? Could Dean actually have something he wanted for once in his life? He got up and headed to the garage to work on Baby and do some thinking of his own.
“We should probably thank Sam at some point. If he didn’t say something, I think we would have gone on forever without talking about how we feel.” Cas felt affection burn bright in his chest for the younger Winchester. While he may not be the one he shared a bond with, Sam truly is a good friend, a brother even. They had been laying comfortably in Dean’s bed for the last couple of hours, enjoying being together without any pretense, before the topic of Sam came up.
“Man, isn’t she just the best?” Dean picked up his head and rolled his eyes. He was glad the spell wasn’t permanent, but she could have said that first. Now, all he has to do is avoid everyone until it wears off. That shouldn’t be too hard. Right?
Sam stared at him, a soft look on his face, proud of Dean for finally telling him. A small part of him wished Dean had told him without prompting from the spell, but the rest of him was just glad it happened at all. He thought it might never come up with the way things were going.
He was more than a little worried. They lied all the time to get information from people. He’d never be able to effectively continue hunting if this is permanent.
Neither notice Sam and Jack leaving the room, too engrossed in their staring to pay attention to anything but each other. Dean walked closer to Cas, needing to make sure he wasn’t going to vanish. He reached out, putting a hand on Cas’ shoulder before pulling him into a hug. Cas melts into Dean’s arms, and all the tension leaves his body. They pull apart slightly and Dean reaches a hand out and places a hand against Cas’ face.
“What?” A voice came from across the room. Sam and Dean stepped back and saw Dream-Cas standing in the doorway. Dean rushed over and put a hand on Cas’ shoulder “Hey, sorry we were getting loud. Is dinner finished?” Cas looked between Dean and Sam before focusing back on Dean. “What did he mean? You’re dying?”
Are we talking about the same person? Our best friend for years, the one you have a ‘more profound bond’ with? That guy? Everyone knows he cares about you Dean.”
“I’m afraid of what will happen if he is around. I don’t want to say something and regret it. Cas is my best friend, and I don’t want to lose him.” Dean looked away from Sam. He could feel his ears getting warm and knew he was probably turning red. He cleared his throat and looked back at Sam.
Cas saw Dean’s face shift through many emotions as he spoke. Disbelief and awe were prominent emotions and Cas could see Dean’s eyes start to glisten with tears. He took a deep breath in order to continue. Saying the words he never thought he’d ever get to say. Until now, too scared to risk losing Dean over them.
Cas made a surprised noise before leaning somehow even closer to Dean. Warmth bloomed in Dean’s chest at Cas’ response, sparks darting across his skin wherever they touched. His lips were softer than Dean had imagined. Softer than anything else, but maybe that was his own sappy imagination to blame. Their lips parted with a sigh, soft breaths ghosting across each others faces.
Sam looked between the two of them. Dean, face still a bit red, was pointedly not looking at Cas. On the other hand, Cas had his eyes trained on Dean, an intense look on his face. He frowned and squinted his eyes. An emotion flickered across his face, too fast for Sam to catch it, before relaxing and he nodded to himself, finally looking away from Dean. Cas turned to Sam, a light blush dusting over his cheeks.
Dean stared at the angel disbelievingly. How could he believe Dean would rather think he was dead than acknowledge his best friend was in love with him? That all these years someone finally thought he was worth more than he was taught to think of himself. Cas saw him for everything he was, his good and his bad, and loved him anyway. How could that ever be a bad thing? Dean knows people in his life care about and love him. He has heard it when he needed to and felt it in the little things done every day. With all the people they have lost along the way, and everyone who is still here today. With a jolt, Dean realizes no one had ever told Cas they loved him.
“Because…” Dean took a moment to gather his thoughts. “What’s the point? I know it won’t make a difference. Cas doesn’t—he can’t feel that way for me. I mean, why would he?”
He stood up when he heard Sam and Cas come in, turning to face them, his eyes immediately focused on Cas’ face. Cas looked the same as he always did, suit slightly disheveled with his signature trench coat. Just seeing him made Dean feel better, his shoulders relaxed and his breathing slowed to a normal rate. Cas seemed to always have that effect on him, but Dean wasn’t complaining. Cas’ eyes darted across his face, his expression tense for a moment before relaxing at seeing Dean in no physical harm.
Dean groaned, “Of course there’s a catch. What is it?” He’d had enough, he wasn’t sure he could handle much more of this and it had just started. Sam wasn’t any help on the ride home and Dean didn’t want to think of how much worse it could be if anyone else got wind of this before it could be removed. They would all be in danger if any enemy got a hold of Dean. And Cas… Dean’s eyes widened at the thought.
“Well, buddy. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I only know if someone asks a question. And you didn’t ask me one. Go ahead, ask away, it will be good to know anyway.”
“Oh, c’mon man. I thought we were done with this.” Dean rolled his eyes and go up, walking over to the sink across the room.
“That’s actually why I called you.” Sam answered, bringing Cas’ attention away from Dean. “I wanted to know if you knew anything about it. It’s a truth spell. When you ask Dean a question, he’s forced to answer it honestly.”
Grabbing a couple beers, they headed to the library and sat down across from each other at the table. Dean cracked open his before taking a sip, anxiety making him want to down the whole bottle at once.
“Freakin’ witches man. Why’s it got to be witches?” Dean mumbled to himself. Rifling through the desk in the room, he searched for the book Rowena needed them to get. He made a mental note to never owe her a favor again.  “Why can’t it be a ghost or a vampire? Those I get, witches are crazy.”
“Everything ok, Cas?” Dean was worried. Cas looked like something was bothering him, but he couldn’t figure out what it was. He looked the same as last night. Whatever it was, Cas seemed to be thinking about, it sure was occupying his mind.
Cas paced back and forth in front of Dean. Nerves making him unable to stay still. Cas seemed very in his own head, mumbling to himself having some sort of inner conflict. Dean caught the words ‘listened to Sam’ and ‘tell him’, but the context was lost on him. Before he could try to work out a meaning, Cas stopped his pacing and spun around. He crossed the room and stood directly in front of Dean; his face determined.
“What are—” He cut himself off “Yes, I’m fine. I was just lost in thought. I was researching a new case Sam came across. Figured I’d make myself useful since I couldn’t do anything about the spell. I hadn’t realized how late it had gotten.” Cas closed the book in front of him, reaching for another on the pile stacked on the table.
Cas looked between the brothers for a moment. Dean still had his face turned away and Sam had his puppy dog eyes trained on Cas, pleading with him to stay.
“I realized I have enough people to help me out rebuilding things and saw that you were needed elsewhere.” Jack replied looking around the room, his eyes landing on the Winchesters.
“Yeah. I just wanted to come see how you were doing. Maybe ask if the spell had worn off yet.” He paused, waiting for an answer.
“I killed the witch after she attacked you. The book is in the trunk still wrapped in your jacket, after it stung me too. She must have put a spell on it to prevent people from opening it. Rowena will probably know more about it; I’ll call her when we get back to the bunker.” Sam hated seeing Dean in pain. He didn’t usually believe Dean when he would say he was fine. Although, admitting it was new. He must have really been out of it.
“Not well, nightmares kept me up.” Dean turned around, already expecting the wide-eyed look on Sam’s face. He raised the spatula in his hand to point at Sam. “Not a word. I don’t want to talk about it.” Sam raised his hands, wearing an apologetic expression.
“You know Sam’s probably calling everyone we know to tell them the news.’ Cas raised an eyebrow at Dean, unbothered by the thought.
“What are you—” Dean broke off, remembering that Cas didn’t want him to interrupt. Cas’ eyes flashed up to meet Dean’s for the briefest of moments before darting away. He returned to Dean’s face after a few seconds, but his focus shifted to everything but his eyes.
“I love you too, Cas. I don’t know when my feelings for you changed. Gotta admit we were kind of dicks to each other when we first met. But along the way you managed to make me rethink everything I thought I knew. You’ve made yourself a place in my heart and that will never change. You’re stuck with me now. No returns or exchanges allowed, sorry.” Dean had a smile on his face now, tone unapologetic despite his words.
“I’m sorry about the last couple days,” he offered Dean a small smile, hoping to be forgiven, “I just wanted you to be honest with yourself about Cas and how you felt.”
“These last couple days, the spell and talking to Sam made me realize a few things. I shouldn’t live my life afraid. Afraid of myself and the things I want. The people I want.” His eyes met Cas’, trying to convey his meaning.
“I’m not aware of anything that could help. Rowena was correct, the spell wears off in a day or two. I’d estimate that it should be gone come morning.”
Rowena paused, enjoying seeing the boys’ squirm for a moment. She looked away from them, trying to contain a smile. “Right, I can’t remove the spell. However, it should wear off on its own in a couple days. It was created to quickly get answers without needing a lot of power to make it permanent.”
“Oh, you didn’t hear? You’re not the first witch we’ve killed.” Sam pulled the trigger, hitting the witch in the forehead, killing her. He dropped the gun and took a deep breath. He always felt badly when they had to kill someone. Could they have done things differently? He shook off the thought, knowing he couldn’t change things and rushed over to his brother. Dean was just getting up when he reached him.
Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. Dropping down into one of the library chairs, he put his head into his hands. Sam looked at Rowena, exasperated, “Why didn’t you just say that? We were worried for nothing.”
Cas turned his head toward Dean. He was still focused away from Cas, but he took a deep breath and spun around. Facing Cas, Dean looked him in the eyes and repeated himself.
Cas’ whole body relaxed, his face softening. A smile appeared and Dean stared. He cleared his throat and looked away before Cas noticed.
Dean breathed out deeply, feeling just a smidge better having said something. Even though he knew it wouldn’t go any further than this.
Sam seemed relieved to see them but appeared surprised to see Cas when he opened the door. He quickly shook off his surprise when Cas spoke.
Dean felt all the air leave his lungs the second Cas arrived. His heart pounded in his chest and he felt as if he had swallowed a rock. “Cas?” he whispered, unable to speak any louder in fear of Cas disappearing.
“You said the one thing you want is something you know you can’t have. But Cas, you can have it, of course you can have it.” Cas stared in disbelief as Dean went on, “Knowing me has changed you? Knowing you, believing in you when I had no one else, that has changed me for the better. We changed each other. I love you too, Cas.”
Dean thought over both interactions. What did they have in common? The first time he tried to downplay how he was feeling. And just now he wanted to deny his enjoyment of something. Then it hit him, he couldn’t lie. Even when he tried, the truth came out anyway.
Dean fidgeted, uneasy with the idea of Cas knowing about the spell. He already said more than he wanted to and there was no telling what Cas might ask. Who wouldn’t use this opportunity to ask him something and get an honest answer? Dean knows he certainly would if given the chance.
Dean jumped, pulling away from Cas. He cleared his throat and looked away, his face burning. Cas lowered his hand and turned to Sam, ignoring his question.
A grin, just as bright as Cas’, stretched across his own face. He glanced down at Cas’ mouth before darting back up to his eyes. Instead of giving it anymore thought and chickening out, Dean tilted his head closer and kissed Cas.
Cas’ eyes widened and he looked away. Just as quickly, he looked back towards Dean, a small smirk on his face.
Sam took in Dean’s rigid form, looking as if whatever he was about to ask just might kill him. He had a moment where he wondered if he should just let it go. Let his brother continue to ignore what was right in front of him. Then he thought about Cas, about all the years he and Dean have played their ‘will they, won’t they’ game. How many times has he been temped to just lock the pair in a closet to finally talk to each other? Sam knew if he didn’t make Dean talk about it, he would ignore it forever. He had let it go before because they were usually in some kind of world ending situation. Now, for once it had been relatively quiet and he couldn’t let this continue any longer.
“N-- Of course I do.” Dean stuttered, trying to deny it but failing to. “Okay, seriously. What is going on? I didn’t mean to say that.” He was getting concerned now and a little freaked out.
“Did you have a good sleep?” Cas asked Dean when he finished eating. “Yeah, just had a weird dream.”
“Maybe—there’s a word for that? I mean nowadays it’s just Cas, but yeah, I think so.” Dean was relieved Sam was taking this well, he’s not sure what he’d do if he didn’t.
Cas is still covered in some oil and grease from helping Bobby in the garage, so after dinner he excuses himself to go take a shower, which seems like a great idea, except--
“We’ll clean up,” Dean says abruptly, standing up and starting to clear plates. He glares meaningfully at his brother. “Right, Sam?”
Cas nods in agreement, sipping his own glass. They moved here during the winter because Dean said he was “too old to live underground anymore,” and since then Dean’s talked about getting outside and doing yard work or tinkering with the Impala.
Cas pulls out the top drawer of Bobby’s tall, red Craftsman tool box and stares at the tools. “Uh...which one is that?”
be annoyed that this random civil engineering major found his way into an upper-level creative writing class, because everyone else is. Behind Dean’s back, they grumble about him “taking spots from other students” and writing pieces that are “too coarse and experimental.”
Dean knows that he’s stuck with Cas, too, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. If Dean had to design a perfect Sunday morning, this definitely wouldn’t be it, but it makes Cas happy, and he couldn’t ask for anything better than that.
packed them, so it’s prolly carrots and vegan jerky and shit.” Even so, Dean twists around to the backseat to grab the bag of snacks.
As soon as they got back to the bunker, Dean went to put Jack to bed, leaving Castiel in the kitchen with Sam. That’s where Castiel is now, watching Sam putter around, cleaning up things that don’t need to be cleaned. There’s clearly something on his mind.
Aristotle said the firmament was a fixed sphere of stars. In the scripture, God (a better one than Castiel’s own heavenly father) declares,
Dean doesn’t get mad, as the weeks drag on and Cas gets out less and less. Instead, he does everything he can to help, and Cas is grateful, even if the words to express that are stuck in his chest.
When there’s a pause in traffic, Cas wipes his forehead with the corner of his apron and wonders why he decided to use his English degree like this instead of as a teacher or something, and then he sees a familiar face that reminds him of one of the main reasons he chose this job.
Cas scrubs at his face furiously and leaves the bathroom. Sure enough, Dean is sitting on their bed, fully unaware of Cas’ mental breakdown in the bathroom moments before.
Later, once all the kids are at least in bed (although there’s no guarantee that Emma isn’t reading under her covers and Claire’s not watching something on her phone), and Cas has showered, Dean finally gets a chance to lay down and take a deep breath.
“No,” the woman says. Castiel supposes she’s a guard. “You were awoken early. We don’t know what by.”
“Dull.” Cas lets out a sigh and...loosens his tie, which never happens, and runs a hand through his hair. “I haven’t felt this defeated since I was helping Puccini write
he notices that Cas is curled up on top of Dean on the couch, both of them fast asleep, with Dean’s arms wrapped around Cas.
Dean sighed and dragged himself out of bed thirty minutes earlier than usual the next morning and set about making breakfast. Cas typically had a bowl of cereal, but he appreciated it when Dean made breakfast, and, well, what was it that his mom always said?
They take the champagne out to the back deck to pop it open (Dean doesn’t want to clean the floors the first night they own the house) and then stay out, watching the sunset and passing the bottle back and forth. The champagne tingles on the way down, and Dean can't help but stare at his fiancé (
“Of course I still want to come.” Cas has been secretly looking forward to the trip--partially because he doesn’t go a lot of places, and because he’s never really been to Kansas, but mostly because he wants to meet Dean’s family.
of fun), that he doesn’t notice the other person walking down the hall until they run directly into each other and Dean sloshes his beer all down their front.
Just as Castiel's eyes landed on him, the beer collided with the wooden floor of the porch spilling over his shoes, but he seemed to pay no attention to it.
The cursed image unwillingly slipped into the minds of all the car's passengers and they all began to laugh uncontrollably.
"- if you thought..." Dean gulped, gripped Castiel's hand in his and brought it to his own heart. "If you don't know that you CAN have this... have me," his voice broke. There, his heart on his sleeve while also hammering almost painfully against his ribcage, hoping Cas can read everything unsaid in his eyes.
Something is wrong with his human. Heaven or not, Dean hasn't gotten out of bed for the past twenty-five hours and it wasn't Cas keeping him there.
"Hello," Dean said, the sentence so familiar, yet belonging to the lips of the other man. His footsteps heavy, he walked the short distance to the porch, attempting to set his own beer on the steps, but audibly failing as the bottle toppled and landed in the grass with a soft 'clink'. He was however already on the porch, eyes locked on the unmoving man before him.
Cas got out of bed before noon and made some coffee and toast to maybe get him out by the smell of it. Nothing. He even brought it to the room but without a reaction. Dean woke up later in the afternoon, sleep heavy in his eyes, Cas was sitting in the armchair with a small frown. He has been watching him for hours, pondering about what was happening.
Cas's heart was breaking. Breaking over this man who had so much life in him but now lied in his arms, small and too broken, all will to live stomped and shattered. His cheeks were wet too and he kept pressing small kisses into Dean's hair.
Dean snorted. "You'll have to wait for Bobby, he has proclaimed himself the official 'Gatekeeper to the Heavenly Bliss'. Got brochures and everything."
Cas made a few attempts catching his stare and his attention, but when Dean's shoulders sagged even further, he just got up and took Dean's hand to get him to follow him. They ascended the stairs in a complete silence and when they reached the bedroom under the roof with a massive bed under a big window, Dean just dropped his hand and headed for the bed. He sat on it heavily, bones cracking.
Dean kept sleeping for the whole afternoon, then Dean just resigned and let Cas get a piece of toast into him. He slept the whole night. It really seemed like he was dead tired. Done, lifeless, dead.
