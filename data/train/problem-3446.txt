“Cas isn’t a danger to anyone; he’s just losing it because he needs me.  Don’t be an idiot, Talbot, this is basic omega/alpha biology.”  She’s a fucking beta, but one would think a medical degree would have you read about such things.  How in the hell is Kevin fond of this woman?
Chuckling, Cas’s hand simply chases Dean’s groin, his alpha nibbling at the mating mark.  Then nothing. He can hear his Dom walking around the room, the squeak of the cart, but no one touches him.
The man in his bed pulls away just enough so they can be eye to eye.  “I would enjoy kissing you, right now.  A moment shared before we are both astray in naked delights.”
Somehow, by the grace of God, Dean is able to ramble through the lecture. Now the class has moved to the backyard to work on steering and parking an actual car.
The hunter is no longer capable of coherent thoughts.  He is lost to everyone, everything, except the man grinding above him.  Moans, groans, growls, lips smacking, and water splashing are like music to his ears.  The mixing scents of Dean’s shampoo and Cas’s beach drenched body arouse them both.
“Yes, my aroma expert was able to determine a specific combination that might belong to our culprit, but until we have a suspect, it’s of no use.”  The interesting thing about an individual’s scent is that other people can share the same smell; however, when the aroma is broken down to its molecular level, it becomes a second fingerprint every alpha, omega, and even beta can leave behind.  There are scientists who believe that when two people mate, they learn their lover’s fragrance on a molecular level.  Others theorize that this can include any strong bonds like Omega and child.
Dean winks, in the same moment the whip goes up ripping against Ishim’s cheek and over his top lip.  “You are fucking insane if you think I believe anything about your Alpha God.  My deity comes to me in the stillness after I’ve killed an Alpha.  She kisses my wounds, lapping at the drying blood.”
“We in the melanoma field use it to evaluate possible lymph nodes that could be infiltrated by the cancer.   One to two hours before surgery we’ll inject you with a kind of tracker which I can follow to any affected sentinel nodes. Basically, a guide from the primary tumor in your butt to where it’s drained.  I’ll do a biopsy of any abnormal-looking lymph nodes during surgery, sending them up to path with a stat turnaround.  If they come back as melanoma, then we’ll remove them before closing you up.”
However, a desire to snoop wins out as Dean searches for the small set of stairs to the third floor.  In his bare feet he tiptoes up to peek in on Novak’s work room.  The door at the top is open wide, but Dean ducks down praying he doesn’t disturb the other man, who must be deep in thought.
“Until after my first heat?”  Castiel places his hand over the alpha’s, but instead of making Dean happy the man pulls back his hand as though burned.
Castiel places his hand on Dean’s shoulder, “Maybe we should g—”.  Dean doesn’t let him finish, snatching his alpha’s lips with his hands.  This just got interesting.
“What?  No!  I’m going to …” His voice falls quiet as he recalls why his hand is perched on his stomach.
“She’s a lonely omega, Cas.  I don’t want her to lose a good-paying job because she has a crush.”  Dean shrugs, dragging his fingers over his alpha’s strong jaw.  “Did she kiss you?”
“Dinner out, great idea.”  Dean’s energy tank is teetering on empty, yet a change of scenery might help.
He gestures his hand towards the side alley, and Castiel moves ahead of him.  Dean is extremely grateful for this because it allows him to glare at the dancer’s ass.  There is a graceful sway to his hips that makes Dean’s brain shriek in delight, but also retreat with fear.  Cas glances back over his shoulder, triggering Dean to freeze like a kid caught with their hand in the cookie jar.  But the dancer continues without comment, although Dean swears the swagger in his step becomes more pronounced.  “There’s a door just ahead marked deliveries, that’s what we want.”
Dean jerks his head in agreement, a little speechless. Wow, Cas doesn’t fuck around, like, in any regard.
Rowena points her manicured finger over Dean’s shoulder.  First, he spots Henriksen and gives the alpha a little wave.  The dude is an ally.  Next, his expression blossoms into excited bliss as he shouts, “HOLY SHIT!”
“I can have a visit on the docket for this week, and then it usually takes another week for shipping and handling.  Will that be alright?”
Their lips crash together in a blend of desperate yearning and release.  His body responds to the building pheromones as his jeans become damp with slick.  Between each deep tangle of tongues, Dean exclaims, “Bed, Cas.  We need room to stretch.”
“Thank you.”  The alpha’s voice has so many dark layers the sound rushes over Dean like a harsh wave.  “You are here to work with Claire.”
“If Dean were your true mate, you wouldn’t be able to fight the desire to claim him.  Wanting Dean as a mate and him actually being right for you are two different things.  There are arrangements where you could have a more suitable omega and keep Dean as Claire’s tutor.  I, in fact, would be willing to look the other way from the occasional indiscretion.”  Her hand slides down his arm.
“Did you want to have sex with this woman, or did you feel obligated because your father commanded it?”
“True.” He yanks Dean up to standing so they are breathing in each other’s exhale. Cas’s voice is heavy with need, “So what do you want my little boss?”
“For such a large man, your brother is quite spry.” Castiel exclaims turning to Dean with a weary grin.
“How old is Castiel?”  Dean wishes the inquiry comes off as sly, but images of a puppy jumping up and down is probably more accurate.
The man doesn’t waste time as he slips his mouth around Dean’s dick, bouncing up and down with a serious focus. One of Castiel’s hands pumps the base of his erection as the other fondles his balls.  Dean’s eyes roll into the back of his head with the overstimulation of pleasure.  Dean’s entire focus is blown as he melts in to a puddle of lust at the ministrations of his extremely talented husband.  Then the hand stroking his cock vanishes with the swift sound of a cap opening.  A slick finger slithers into his ass, and Dean is 100% sure that he’s not going to last if his husband keeps this up for long.  Dean becomes a writhing mess as Cas gradually works his way up to three fingers, his mouth bobbing wildly and the free hand still playing badminton with his testicles.
“Hey, I’m not dying over this. Castiel, all you gotta do is call your precious alpha over and the adults can take care it.”
“Dean adores every inch of you. It’s not that your alpha prefers dick, he just wants everything Castiel, which happens to include a joystick.”
Max quietly enters from the kitchen munching on an apple.  “I was thinking of going with them.  You know I could help with the classes and stuff.”
Cas’s body steps closer to the door.  “Never say never.  Hope is fun to play with because watching you try can bring us entertainment for a very long time.”
The itch under his skin builds with a fury.  Between Castiel’s mental health concerns and dealing with Dean’s family it’s been too long since he’s felt the relief that comes from the sting of pain.  Maybe that’s why he had the wicked nightmare of Dick Roman, his mind recalling an alpha that fed him well on agony and anguish.  Cas uses a different approach; well, he did at least.
Life royally sucks when Dean wakes up and his tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth. The delightful flavor of upchuck lingering on his breath.  Nasty. He sits up relieved to feel his memory foam mattress under his ass.  God, it soothes everything.
“Is the rainbow room done?” He’s expecting a no, but the grin on Cas’s mouth gives a different interpretation.
When the woman is facing him again, she frowns.  “Oh, Dean.  Your turn will come soon.  Some of us just need a little more time to meet our true alpha.”
“I do.”  It makes sense that Castiel would make sure Hannah was in the dark.  Dean’s had enough medical professionals betraying him.  Having one in the same boat as him will help Dean to continue to trust Hannah and the care she gives him and the twins.
The cab makes it to the bridge when his phone rings.  It’s like one in the morning, so Dean knows for sure it’s not Sam.  His little brother tucks into bed every night by midnight and hates to be bothered until well after seven.  A grin smacks his face when he spots the caller ID: Gadreel.  Dean has exactly two friends in the world.  Sam takes the first slot, but right behind his brother would be his buddy, Gadreel.  They met in a bar on Dean’s 21
“Are you sure you want this?” His angel is the pinnacle of purity, nothing this perfect should mingle with his lowly soul; however, Dean won’t deny Castiel anything.
Castiel plops down by the grave, folding his hands over the dirt that holds Anna tight. “Hi, mother.”
Dean rests silently in his bed, staring at the ceiling. Sam is long gone and Castiel had his session with Shurely, so here he lies trapped in his worst nightmare, all alone. Ruby 1.0 came in right as Sam was leaving, handing Dean a little white cup with two pills inside. Dean didn’t ask and Sam stood watching until his older brother swallowed them properly. It didn’t seem to matter; Sam had given consent so there was no choice to be made.
When Cas enters the shop, Dean is standing with three boxes and two drinks precariously balanced on top.
Around 3:00pm, Balthazar returns fiddling with the bags on Dean’s IV.  “Once I change this to a basic saline drip, Dean will no longer be under sedation; however, it might take some time for him to regain consciousness.”
Weighing significantly more than Hannah gives him an advantage.  Although, passing her left a string of curse words in Dean’s wake.  This lady has a mean competitive streak.  For a few minutes the omega forgets the anxiety and simply enjoys the childish feeling of racing with a friend.  It reminds Dean of the hill behind the pond at the orphanage.  Every year when the snow was deep enough, all the omegas would take turns riding down on anything they could find: trays, cardboard, baking sheets.  Pretty sure Harry used an upside-down table once.  Dean misses them.
The young doctor barely gives Castiel a passing glance, “Dean, it’s okay. Can you put your head down between your legs?”
“Deception and double crosses were always Amara’s talent.”  Naomi inhales deeply, releasing her hold on both Alphas.  His mother pulls out her purse, collecting makeup to hide the tracks of her tears.  Slowly, cautiously, the omega slips into becoming the powerful woman directing a coup to overthrow a system rooted deeply into the American way of life.  “However, I’ve been with my Alpha long enough to learn a few things.  We have until the opening of the sixth trial to pull off a miracle.”
“Do you want to come for dinner? I’m making Mexican Casserole; it’s a Winchester favorite.” Castiel loves the pride in the sub’s voice.
Han Solo, otherwise known as the sexiest husband in the galaxy, plops down next to him with a kiss to Dean’s cheek.  “Are we still going to allow her to eat as much candy as she wishes tonight then starting tomorrow there will be rules about consumption of sugar?  I’m wondering if we should rethink the plan.  Emma’s practically vibrating.”
Please be BDSM.  For all that is holy, let Castiel be belting out Rihanna’s S&M dressed in leather studded chaps.  The visual isn’t half bad.  He needs to update his iTunes.
Dr. Novak literally gasps when he crosses the threshold.  “Dean.”  A sadness to his tone breaks Dean’s heart a bit.  “I smell mold.”
A green flannel joins the jeans.  Dean blinks, fighting back the moisture.  The words beginning to sink under his flesh and make a home.
Castiel hits end on the Satellite phone, a huge smile plastered to his face.  It was nice to take an hour to discuss the trip with Dr. Shurley.  He and Dean are making such amazing strides in their relationship, that it helps to review things with his therapist.  Today marks the sixth day of the safari.  The scenery is gorgeous, a picture perfect moment at every turn.  Their first stop was a small ranch house set in the southern part of the Bushveld Region of South Africa.  A dry, open savanna rolling around them made getting up in the morning a pleasure.  Now, the group has settled into their second location near Limpopo in a massive hunting lodge that could easily house twenty or more people.  The lodge sits close to a mountain range, so the landscape is green and lush.  The dancer adores the wraparound porch with several rocking chairs.
Tears begin streaming down her chubby, baby cheeks, breaking Cas in two. Novak stands, taking the tiny girl into his arms, lifting her off the island. “Oh Meg, it’s okay to love your mother. I never met her, but she couldn’t be horrible because she made you.”
The tight, irritated, expression loosens into something almost loving as Gadreel speaks about his husband. Castiel wonders if Dean will look like that one day when talking about him. He cringes at the thought because this relationship with his boyfriend is too new to think about something long term, but he can’t help it. Novak wants forever with Dean, and nothing less will do.
“What the hell, Gabriel?  A little privacy.”  Dean’s not one for modesty, but he was enjoying the silent reverie.
“Joshua spoke with me at the ceremony last night.  He warned me of your impending heat and how this one would be particularly brutal as the second seal was broken.”  Cas drags his nose up Dean’s ear.
“Awesome.”  He sighs, stumbling back to his room to grab his own iPhone.  Dean’s uncomfortable, and his equilibrium has become crap.
The air is heavy with emotion and their swirling scents.  Dean’s excited to have his mated odor revealed and soon.
“I didn’t kill her.”  His fingers squeeze the small satchel in his hand as a stress ball, the tingle morphing into an itch.  “There is no reason to share your opinions with Dean.  He’s barely begun to trust me.”
“Fuck, Dean!”  Cas shrieks as his fingernails rip into Dean’s shoulders, leaving angry, long red lines.  The younger man is ecstatic that he slept last night sans collar.  A nice morning romp as boyfriends is perfect.
“Emma will be okay, I assure you.”  The pediatrician comments crossing his arms.  “I was informed you recently adopted her?”
Hannah joins them a few moments later. It seems the sweltering heat of Texas is easier to deal with than a talking Gabriel. “I consider myself a forward-thinking omega, but I refuse to watch porn with my brother.”
Bang!  Bang!  The sound of a fist pummeling their door startles Dean.  A dark voice yells through the steel, “Castiel, we must speak at once!”
Dragging a hand over his face, Dean sighs.  The light from outside is annoying the omega because it’s just not a sunshine kind of day. He didn’t sleep a wink last night, his brain overcharged on all the information floating through his thoughts.  Doctor Gabriel sits on the floor, silent.  The therapist arrived early, storming into his room so they could speak privately.  Fuck, it’s barely past 9 a.m.
“Wow, you said the word marriage license without a hint of impending cold feet,” the tattoo artist chuckles at her own joke.
Clearly the mental image is enough to help Castiel’s erection harden in his sleep pants. Cas adjusts his cock while his eyes ghost over Dean’s naked body, glaring at Dean’s hardon.  Cas nods, dropping his own clothing to the floor.  The stunning view makes the game so much more fun.
Crowley sighs with annoyance, “You three were the only people here when the Calvary arrived.” MacLeod tosses his hands into the air. “Fuck this, I’m tired of hunting anyways. Let’s go to Port Elizabeth. The beaches are gorgeous. Benny, tell Bobby about the change in location. I want options brought to me after lunch.” With that, the Scottish man storms off towards the main house.
“Here, my son.  I have stayed up the night to prepare for our mission.”  Joshua leads him to the sitting area where the sofa has been pushed aside, making room for two sleeping bags on the floor.  The older man hands him a mug of hot liquid.  “The brew will help us to unite and claim our powers in your Omega’s dreamscape.  Meg has promised me Dean will be asleep by 10 a.m., resting for the trial tonight.”
The naked omega crawls up the bed, placing his hands on the headboard. Glancing back over his shoulder, he announces, “How do you want me, Alpha?”
The next twenty four hours become a blur of visitors.  Castiel is amazed at how many people have entered his life and consider Dean to be an important part of theirs.  It helps to keep the alpha functioning, even though there is no world beyond this hospital room.  He hasn’t left once, and no one has been stupid enough to ask him to leave.  Cas will depart holding Dean’s hand not a moment before.
Pausing, Dean rewinds his thoughts, checking for any signs of not wanting the infant in his arms.  Instead of fear or questions, he finds only one emotion …joy.  “I want her, Cas.  Sometimes the best things get drop-kicked into our lives without warning.  Emma was a surprise both times.”
Deep low omega giggles fill the cabin of the suburban.  Suddenly Dean’s eyes darken as he kisses Castiel’s ear.  “Deal, you just lie there while I ride you hard, cowboy style.”
A heavy weight sits on Castiel’s shoulders.  He’s torn between staying so Gabriel won’t be alone and going to meet Dean’s family.  “Maybe I should stay; we could watch a Christmas movie?”
“I thought,” Cas croaks out, “having our first real time up here would be romantic.” The omega saunters over to the low hanging roof, tracing one of the omega/alpha markings.
Turning back to face him, Tasha adds, “The Angel we have been worried about, the one who is diligently working against you, Max dreamt last night that they were in league with the Leviathan.”
“Yes, to the Charlotte/ Douglas International Airport.  Crowley has chartered a jet,” she replies, oblivious to Dean’s rising terror.
“I need you.” He chuckles as a sob breaks through. Castiel ends the call, looking up at his beta’s concerned expression, “Where is my cat?”
“Blowjob and done.”  She nods in agreement, waving her hand towards the bed.  One of their many rules to making this work is no kissing.  He and Lisa decided that this was about need, not emotions, so Dean’s lips have remained celibate for eight years.
Turning his head to look over, he watches Uriel standing perfectly alert as Icarus yelps and nips at the angel's pant legs.  The scene almost makes Dean smile. Almost.
“Truer words have never been spoken, dear mate; however, I desire pie right now.  If you are done working yourself into a tizzy, I can’t get out of this fucking deathtrap without a shove.”
“In that park the future of Nashville laughs and plays on broken things. Sometimes it’s not about being broken, but how it can be re-used to make something amazing.”
“If you guys bust into Kumbaya I’m out of here.” Dean huffs but still takes Castiel and Krissy’s hands. The action is innocent and, of course, the instructor should not be taking a moment to memorize the softness of Novak’s hands. Jesus H. Christ the older man’s hands are smooth like the skin version of handspun silk.
Castiel immediately puts the vehicle in park, dashing around to check on Sam. Dean is right on his heels. They reach the younger Winchester simultaneously as the two men yell in unison, “Are you okay?”
Idiot.  Amara would die for her son’s happiness, of that Dean’s a 100% sure.  Yes, Cas would mourn, but it would only put a death warrant on Ishim’s head.  The jerk has no clue about love.
“Ah, in my line of business one never takes the obvious approach.  The point is to incarcerate Adler.  I don’t need your involvement to reach our mutual goal.  Remember, there are people out there with zero connection to you who owe me favors.  I simply have to find the right people to fit the puzzle.”
“Or what?  Dean’s a terrible poker player.  I’m getting out of here and heading off to finish my semester at school.”
“See, I told you. Dean’s never gonna ask about that gift again.”  Kevin announces through fits of laughter.
She thanks him, using it to cushion her ass.  Claire’s unusually quiet, holding her hands tightly in her lap.  Dean tilts over to whisper, “You seem more nervous than Cas.”
A tender hum of his friend, “I did.  Dean, you haven’t needed a red flag listing on a target in years?”
Bela and her gang are hovering around a gold sofa in the corner as Ruby sits on a high-back, extravagant cerulean chair, her eyes shooting daggers at his obvious disturbance of her interview.  Two cameras are pointed towards the blonde dressed to impress in an ankle-length, black silk ballgown.  She’s cute.
“And you must be Dean.”  The alpha is shorter, dressed in a black suit with a black wool trench coat.  His British accent appears oddly out of place next to the woman’s.  MacLeod’s potent alpha bouquet dominates Dean’s senses with the scent of a high-quality scotch.
A single finger sneaks between his cheeks, collecting the slick.  The sound of Castiel humming as he licks his moist digit forces a moan from Dean’s throat.  “Please, sir, please make it hurt.”
Castiel perches on one, keeping Dean tucked in his embrace.  The heat from his skin soothes a worry within Dean.  His alpha is the key.
Standing, the woman cleans her face up with make-up from her locker.  Finally crossing the room, she tosses over her shoulder, “My true mate is dead.  Might as well find a living knothead who can pay well.  Isn’t that what this is all about?  Something pretty for an alpha to play with.  If I have to be a doll, it’s better with diamonds dripping from my neck.”
Her dark demanding eyes slide over to Jack, “The activity will play to your gifts, Dean.  You are a good father according to Crowley I won’t fuck things up for you.”
“When Gabriel gets better, I want him to move in with us.”  Cas watches his sleeping brother, a hand placed on the blanket-covered chest.
His partner kisses him tenderly, “I would give every penny I have to keep you safe. Unfortunately, nothing can regulate what’s to come with any of us. But, marrying you gives me a minute sensation of power in a powerless situation. Please, Dean, marry me. I love you.”
“The federal government is so damn picky about who gets into their databases.  You move a few key things around as a joke and the next thing a girl knows, she’s doing a six-month stint in a low-security prison.  Don’t stress, think Orange is the New Black but even nicer.  I got the one they sent Martha Stewart to.”
“Dean, this is really simple. You produce Megan to the courts, prove that she’s healthy and well cared for, and the child endangerment charges can be dropped. Now, as you have stated, Megan was in the custody of her biological father, so I have a feeling that the DA might be willing to hand the whole issue over to Family Court and file no criminal charges if you are willing to work with us.”
His alpha kisses him.  Cas’s mouth is soft and pliant, a pacifying sense of love floods Dean’s body.  “I’m here, my Dean.  Take what you need.”
Immediately Emma shakes her head giving Sam the stink eye, which is hilarious on her. Dean decides to give his brother a break, “Cas is Emma’s Papa. Gabriel is her Papa’s brother.”
Pulling his phone from his back-pocket Dean exclaims, “Shit!  It’s 7:40, run upstairs and into the attic, I’ll open a few windows and fix the table.”
Shrugging, Dean plops down on the black leather sofa facing the big-screen TV.  “This isn’t about looks Meg and you know it.  So share with me these demands from …Castiel.”
“Well, now we have a conundrum because this here truck was reported stolen thirty minutes ago.”  The sheriff just stands, obviously waiting for another bout of bullshit.
His head spins with the spontaneous flip of their positions, Dean landing on Castiel’s belly.  Reaching behind him, Dean removes the plug before working open the zipper and button of Castiel’s pants with one hand. The free hand then roams up the divine expanse of skin.
“I think the fourth-years are serving steak and potatoes.”  He remembers Gordon going on and on about the juice levels of his meat.  The conversation was more uncomfortable than appetizing.
Warm supple fingers slide over his belly; Dean’s imagining a blue glow surrounding his baby bump.  Their bond is igniting a blaze within him.  Suddenly the pressure on his neck vanishes as he exclaims, “Eight, you son of a bitch!  I get eight of these!”
She is literally pushing Dean off the couch.  Doesn’t do much.  The woman has the upper body strength of a Muppet.  “Meet me here.  We can take my car and you can use it for any errands I need done.”
“Is he?”  The question said without a single emotion on the psychiatrist’s face.  “Technically Castiel is the Alpha Father to your triplets with no connection to you.”
“Makes sense actually,” Dean concurs, not to mention he still needs to warm up to the idea of stuffing Cas in a box. All the boxes are the same size but not that big, like it’s going to take some weird pretzel thing to get a grown ass man inside.  “While we have the time tell me what’s best to do.”
A wicked cramp wracks his stomach. Dean curls in to fight off the worst of it, whining loudly.  He knows that Cas is speaking to him, but the ache is so vicious Dean can’t focus beyond the throbbing.  Castiel adjusts Dean’s body, and then Dean feels something WAY bigger than a finger penetrate his hole.  At first the burn causes him to stop breathing, but eventually Cas pauses fully inside of Dean.
“Eat your breakfast and take your prenatal vitamin with the juice.  Folic acid is important,”  Crowley grumbles as he takes a sip of his steaming hot beverage.
“Your Alphesterone levels are through the roof. It’s not healthy, but won’t kill you. Crowley said if we wait it out, the hormone will dissipate over time, but we are looking at 6 to 8 months.”
“I’m good, for now.”  Oddly the statement rings true.  The omega does a quick check, verifying the heat is a mild simmer.  Dean’s got no doubt the horrendous blaze of need will return.  “Stay close though, Alpha, I’m going to need a hit of your flavor soon.”
“There are four, small, two person tents hidden over the property.  Each one of us will take a separate tent, hiding inside, waiting for our mate to find us.”
“Dad, it’s not like buying another pair of jeans.  We are talking about a child, and let me remind you my husband and I can’t just pop one out on our own.”
Separation from Castiel leaves Dean motionless.  His alpha would never be able to visit him.  If the MacLeods kick him out their time together in the attic would end.  The fear transforms into rage at the life he loves being ripped from his hands.
“They are very faint, Dean, and will be completely gone in less than a month. They were not deep, and you took excellent care of cleaning them.  Why?”
Even with the threat of a freezing breeze, Dean tosses the window up and leans out.  The melody of a familiar song drifts into his bedroom.
“Wake up, Dean-o, it’s first shower day.”  Meg yanks the blankets from his grasp.  “Your stench has begun to bother the neighbors.”
“I recall your mother sharing that it's Fergus on your passport, not Crowley,”  Bartholomew counters, crossing his arms over his chest calmly.  “I do so enjoy her company.”
A grin builds on Cas’s face, “Oh, I’m not going anywhere. I get to meet Sam and the nieces.  This should be delightful.”
“I mentioned to my uncle one time that it was my favorite, and he went completely overboard.  Can’t change it now, might hurt his feelings,” Claire answers with a half shrug.  “You’re the new tutor with some weird mutation in your designation?”
A feral growl erupts from Dean’s throat as he surges forward, slamming their mouths together. Cas inhales as both men freeze from the abrupt change, then throwing caution to the wind, the omega licks in between the alpha’s lips. The sigh leaving the older man’s mouth sends a shiver down Castiel. Their mouths fall open, allowing their tongues entrance, freely exploring the warmth of each other’s mouth. The taste of his alpha is unique and intoxicating.
She’s typing his blood pressure into her laptop, “I’ll email the staff giving you the entire day off which includes no Hunter practice today either.”
The pause and her careful use of words makes the alpha’s head spin.  Castiel roars, “Where is Dean?”
“Harry’s a dumbass.  Sometimes shit happens, and no one can stop it.”  Ash does the same as they stand quietly brushing.  After a quick spit, his roommate continues, “Are you really taking on hunter?”
Immediately Cas groans as his own orgasm takes him into wild bliss, yet his teeth remain deep in Dean’s flesh.
He’s nearing the bottom when a single name pops out; Winchester.  Odd.  Dean doesn’t have a number other than the main switchboard for the Center.  His only form of communication directed at him is an email address.  Yet, here it lies in the list, lacking a first name.  Huh?
Castiel’s expression explodes with joy at the idea, bobbing his head in delighted glee. Then he pulls out the other half of Dean’s gift.  It’s a small black velvet box.  All in all Dean’s kind of glad Cas’s present was such a big deal because now he doesn’t feel like an idiot giving this to him.  Slowly Cas cracks open the top, holding up a long silver chain with a simple silver band hanging from it.
Such a beautiful way to see the importance of family.  Not defined by blood but choice.  Dean ponders the make-shift family he’s plastered together over the past few months.  Will they step up and care for his child if the prophecy comes true?  Yes.  His baby will know love from so many people, yet there is nothing as powerful as the connection of infant and birth omega.  Dean has seen the devastation of losing that relationship at an early age first hand.  He's seen his brother being raised with no knowledge of its blessings.  Their omega baby will know him.
Seconds pass, Dean wails louder in a mix of ecstasy and misery.  Tremors rock his body with exhaustion yet the climax persists.  Cas’s lips vanish.  Without the plug the omega’s shrieks slice through the constant darkness.
That was the second day of Dean’s rut. Why would that specific date and time be important for Castiel to see? His throat goes dry when the realization hits him like a truck. “Dean, I don’t want to see it.”
The aroma of chai tea soothes his frayed nerves.  After a few minutes Dean can finally speak.  “He’s worried about the legal what-not if you mate me during the pregnancy.  I said I trust you to keep those chompers off my neck. Sam is less convinced.”
Dean raps his knuckles on the handcrafted, dark cherry wood bar.  Scanning the room the hunter grins, surprised at the amazing turn out for Gabriel’s grand opening.  The dorky pastry chef talked Crowley into backing his idea for a dessert bar in the heart of Manhattan.  It had taken years of work, but the results were miraculous.  The hunter and his angel were ecstatic to have a reason to come to New York for a week to help support the new business owner.
Dean glances up, staring into perfect blue eyes.  He’d always had a fear of flying into the deep blue sky; the CIA erased the fear along with so much more.
His mind wanders back to his continuing tiff with Ms. Braeden. He gets the fact that school should have rules and be taken seriously, but the children are five. Dean knows that he spoils Meg, but her few short years on this planet have not always been easy.
“I have an old banker’s box that I just cleaned out. Will that work?” Oh my God, how in the hell did he get roped into this?
Turning away from the majority, the omega sprints in the opposite direction.  A little space between him and the mob might help his survival odds.  Mumbling to himself, “Cas is coming.”
The room is quiet, save the heavy breathing emanating from both men. Winchester glimpses up into the cerulean beauties for an instance, noticing how the pupils are blown wide with a wicked hunger. His lover is in full dominant persona, and Dean bathes in its glory. This is what he desires above all else, to be at the mercy of his master. There are no other words to describe it. Castiel Novak owns everything that is Dean.
Pure devotion bleeds from both alpha and omega.  Dean’s swept up in the sensation; he can’t help but throw his leg over Castiel, straddling the man.
Cas appears slightly embarrassed as he tugs off the condom muttering, “Dean, you will need to clean yourself up.  We don’t want me smelling of you.”
A local news anchor woman with one of those plastic smiles begins, “Lawrence Assisted Living Facility has been aiding in the care of our elderly and those with special needs for 63 years.  However, even with its long history of excellent care the facility was the center of a fraud ring lasting over five years.  The recently terminated director, Zachariah Adler, has hidden the death of 13 residents in order to continue cashing government checks for their care.  Adler was taken into custody late last night.”
The older man shifts in his seat so his mouth is closer to Castiel. “Can I give you a word of advice?”
The two mates are in Castiel’s white SUV, driving home.  Just the idea of his nesting bed makes Dean sigh, but then Balthazar’s advice bubbles up from his subconscious.  “Who is at the house?”
Wrapping his arms around Cas’s waist, Dean fiercely wants to protect the precarious world they’ve built together.  The time may be short, but it’s all he has of bliss.  “After what, Cas?”
He’s lost in thought when Cas claps his hands commanding attention, “Okay, time to work with a partner.  Please decide what style you would like to dance, the feminine, or masculine, and choose a partner with the opposing choice.”  He waves his hand.  “Dean, please be my partner.”
A lump grows in Dean’s throat, making it hard to swallow.  His eyes swim in unshed tears as the Omega croaks, “I’m terrified he will flat out want me to stop.”
“Let me tell you something about your little brother Castiel. One, he’s stronger than any of you give him credit for.  Two, he’s a stubborn son of a bitch who isn’t going to back down when his mind is made up.  And finally, he’s consciously made the choice to invite me to touch him.  That’s a whole different ballgame than Ed ripping open the door and scaring the crap out of him.”
Dean stands. “Don’t say anything, Cas.  I don’t have it in me for another battle over this; the decision has been made.”
“Yes, but first a little business,” he slaps Sam’s leg.  The younger Winchester is on the lounge chair next to them with Meg.  “Wake up, Moose!”
As the meal winds down Sam excuses himself yet returns with full arms.  Dean’s eyes double in size at the sight of five pies.
This time Cas chooses a hand towards the back an older gentleman with thick black glasses.  “Thank you, Mr. Novak, Frank Devereaux, Wired Magazine.  Do you have a name for this new flagship?
The older alpha pats Castiel’s shoulder, “Meg has a mouth on her that could make a two dollar whore blush, but she is the air I breathe. I never regret a single inhale.”
A crimson sparkle catches his attention, Dean’s eyes plummeting to a necklace hanging around the alpha's neck.  A sizable red ruby in the shape of a heart hangs from a thin gold chain.  The charm bounces with each jerk of her arms.  He chuckles through gasps of air, the queen of hearts is going to take off his head.  It shouldn’t be funny, but right now the thought is goddamn hilarious.  Oddly shaped bursts of light dance in his vision. Suddenly, like he simply popped into the hallway, a khaki trench coat flies past Dean.  The dark-haired alpha body-checks his assailant and wrestles her to the ground.
“Yes, Gabriel, I left orange juice and donuts.”  Cas bounces his head as he sips his drink.  “Take a shower and go back to bed; I’ll be home in a few hours.”
The hubby stands there watching him laugh, Cas choosing to remain quiet but a faint smile is there. Then the professor snaps his fingers. “Oh! Your swimsuit for the trip came in today.”
“Yes.”  Hannah sips her ice water.  “Don’t park the car on the road.  If you go into the glovebox there is a stack of key cards.  Find the one labeled Thursday.  It’s for Castiel’s building and will let you into the parking deck.  The first few spots are for visitors.  This early in the day there should plenty.”
It’s at the second verse as he slides his fingertips up and down his chest, flicking at his nipples as they pass, that he takes in the words.
Making sure to not overly rock the boat, Dean and Inias push Cas off the course to wait until the final round. Dean’s trying to figure out how to let Cas out for a break when Inias slaps his hand.
After Cas cleans up their meal trash and Dean finds two burp clothes that are long enough to tie around their heads, they strip down naked to begin the game.
Crowley’s teeth grinding brings his mind back to the phone, “Which is why I didn’t do anything, but the poor man has a team sitting on the road outside of his home.  Also, might I suggest purchasing blinds.”
Inside is a file folder with a stack of paperwork.  Sam reads the first page his expression morphing into shock, “You bought me land in Endville!”
The young omega halts, grabbing Dean’s wrist to stop him.  “You have a herd of omegas and alphas who give quite a few fucks.  This part is hard; you are making an amazing sacrifice, but then Castiel will set you free.  What about those left behind?”
“Get me a boat, Benny!”  His hands are shaking with rage, fear, betrayal, you name it, Dean’s feeling it in this moment.  “You work for me. Get me a God damn boat.”
That simple thought causes him to snap, losing Meg will never happen. The dancer pumps his legs harder, speeding up his pace. Theo’s escape is slowed by the tiny woman’s thrashing. He can do this, there is no other choice. Meg entered the home of a mad man to save him from torture and possibly death. Now it’s time for Cas to repay the courage that she showed him. In seconds, he closes the gap, his mind releasing a mantra, ‘take the bastard down’. Castiel doesn’t have to subdue him totally, just stall the kidnappers until help arrives. Surely he’s strong enough to accomplish that task.
The butler swings his arms around wildly, yelling, “Absolutely not! I have been properly trained for such an event.  Did you know that most alphas aren’t even accepted into the program because they can’t pass the heat test?  I did!  I stood in a small room while several raw heat scents were pumped in to see if I’d go bonkers.  You know what?  I didn’t crack.”  To prove a point Crowley steps forward, inhaling deeply. “See, you little nimrod nothing!”
Lilith snatches the erect cock hanging between Dean’s thighs. The beast does not care for that action, smacking her across the face so harshly she flies back several feet. She never has a chance to get up as he pounces on her, sinking his fangs into her skin and ripping her throat out. The beast is so fast in his movements, Lilith never even had the chance to scream. One second she was alive, the next Dean’s alter ego is severing her head from her body and tossing it across the cement chamber. Blood sprays everywhere because the monster continues to hack, bite, and rip until the yoga instructor is nothing but bits and pieces splattered throughout the cell. Dean’s naked skin drips in crimson as he howls to the ceiling.
A gentle tapping to his cheek brings Dean out of his dark thoughts.  Cas halts his movements entirely as his cock settles flawlessly inside the omega.  They were made for each other.  Tilting up, Dean shyly swipes his lips over Castiel’s mouth, winding his fingers into soft, dark hair.  His mate mirrors the omega’s touch, only moving his hips in a slow, circular pattern.  Until the younger man can’t take it and deepens the kiss, tugging on his alpha’s hair, signaling Cas to thrust harder, deeper, longer.  Give him everything that glorious dick can make happen.
Finally. Their gazes lock. Dean’s overwhelmed with a rich shade of the Caribbean Sea, brimming with an intense desire.  Castiel’s cinnamon aroma grows denser, the bouquet weighing heavily in the omega’s nose.  Fresh oranges leave serenity in its wake.
“How does this work?”  Dean stares at a single chair dead center of the room.  The supple tan leather chair has a high back but no arms.  “Are there rules?”
He scans the open arena when he notices one of the lights in the sequence of colors is white, which means he should be able to find the yellow.  Slinking on his belly, Dean elbow walks himself farther inside, checking each pattern.  Closest mat is white, next one is blue, and then he has to hold his mouth to stay quiet.
“No, I don’t think you understand, like he’s fine in the building, but oh my god, being trapped in a small car with him almost killed us.”
Dean rolls his eyes deeply.  He is so over alpha’s interfering in his life with Cas, but the guy does seem pretty cool.  “Shoot.”
On Wednesdays, Dean likes to spoil himself with caffeine and pie at Blackbeard’s Coffee and Treats. He turns onto Main, jogging directly into the center of town, occasionally nodding or waving to the locals who are enjoying the lovely fall morning.
A flicker of heat ignites, dancing across his chest and burning away the pain, leaving anger in its wake.  “Drop the act, Sammy.  We all know you’ve been,” his voice cracks, “lying to me.”
“Damn it.  She shouldn’t be talking to you about business.”  Gabe only knows the broader strokes of what he does, enough to help but never enough to be in danger.
“A spell of this magnitude requires all our combined forces.”  Naomi reaches out to squeeze Dean’s wrist.  “I’m trying to make it right, Dean.”
“Can we worry later? I want to get a glimpse of the Hell ships.”  Dean has been itching to see them.  Uriel has been reluctant to even go down there.
“Oh no worries, Grasshopper, I can totally hack it.”  She grimaces, “Well, eventually.  This is going to take a few days.”
“Because you have no other family, your guardianship falls to your alpha. Missouri contacted him an hour ago before calling me.  We will wait to see his decision.”
“Well, I’m not.  What if I get sick during the night and have to be rushed to the hospital?  Who will take care of the girls?”
Today is the day!  Their post claiming party is happening for better or worse.  Dean grumbles at the kitchen table, glaring into a bowl of cheerios.  The Omega has yet to suffer from morning sickness, but he also is repulsed by food first thing in he morning.  He glances over at his sweet girl gnawing away at a heap of cheerios on her high chair table.  “Do you want mine, princess?”
Dean positions himself behind the chair, leading the puppy along as the train heads back to the station.  A small touch of hope rises in Dean’s chest.  He can do this.
Grinding his teeth Dean responds, “Hell no, I will never be someone’s property.  A nice masking incantation is all I need to visit Sam.  They let you in as a widow.”
“Of course.”  Castiel’s clear sapphire gems blink at him.  “I must warn you, while I am here I will not be able to join you in the dreamscape.  However, I have a friend watching over you.”
Okay, Cas wasn’t kidding.  Dean was shocked at the abrupt transition.  For the entire trek they have been among trees, grass, and sky. Maybe the occasional woodland creature. Dean is refusing to notice the squirrels.
The door opposite to his room is open.  Gabriel's snores could actually wake the dead; in fact, Cas has commented on hearing the chainsaw sound through the floor.  His shrink will be staying with them until the dust settles with Cas. Probably to either celebrate with the family or pick up the pieces of Dean’s heart.
Dean bends over lining up his shot when strong arms wrap around his middle.  A soft voice whispers in his ear, “Do you require help?”
“Dean, do it now!”  The fear seeping from his alpha’s words put a shiver up the Omega’s spine.  He keeps his ear next to the phone, listening to Cas while he gets the sleeping princess from her crib.  “That signal means there is an unauthorized alpha on the property.  It could be nothing; a guard stepping over the invisible marker, but just to be safe.  Take Claire up to the sealed room, and bolt both locks on the door.  Bobby has the only key, and he will head straight there once its clear.”
“You can always say no.” She speaks softly as if Dean is a wild animal likely to break for it, or bite.  “Even if he’s sitting in the commons waiting, you have the right to refuse him.  Everyone will support your decision.”
The omega scoots forward to start the tasty kissing again when Dean sits back, raising his finger in warning. “Don’t you have something to tell me Cas.”
“I don’t think you understand.  Sponsoring an alpha can form a remarkable bond between the two of you and each time is different.  I’ve seen couples who could read the other’s thoughts and one pair who literally felt the pain of the other.  Such an intense link can affect you mentally and physically.  Are you sure?”
His brother lifts his lover into the air, smacking her lips with his own.  “I have a surprise for you.”
His friend takes the seat next to him, “Look, Dr. Turner has some valid concerns about leaving a pregnant Alpha Recessive Omega on an island that’s an hour away from any hospital, thirty if we can fly you in a chopper.  He suggested to Castiel that hiring a nurse who has some experience in childbirth, and even better yet Alpha Recessive Omega health care, would be best.”
“Of course, one of your pups has to pop a knot, and I hear your refusing to take the enhancement drugs.  Bold move?”
“Jesus, you're like the professional model who can eat three Big Macs and never gain a pound.  Oblivious to the plight of those around you.”
Suddenly Dean’s reminded of the three black socks under Cas’s bed, which he would swear don’t belong to his alpha.  “You wouldn’t happen to know why there are odd socks under our bed?”
“Normally, law enforcement interviews all betas and alphas in an incident, and a doctor sees to the needs of any omegas.  We are a small community.  Most people you see in town are visitors or winter folk here for the skiing.  So, I do both jobs.  If you need me to call Gabriel to be here with you I can; if I know my little omega he’s itching to have a reason to get past the gate.”
Turning to the next page, Dean nuzzles his nose into the chaotic mess of hair tickling his chin. They are passing the lazy afternoon snuggled up together on Dean’s bed; well, lately it’s become
The two men are glaring at each other.  Sheriff Mills grabs her partner’s elbow, steering him to the front door.  “Oh, I think a formal reprimand is in order, again, I am so sorry.”
Beautiful brown eyes watch Dean with curiosity.  Emma’s standoffish.  He’d be terrified if he was taken from the only home he remembers to some strange house full of odd people.  The kitchen is empty save them.  Dean wanted privacy for his first conversation with his daughter.  Although, now he’s questioning his sanity because he’s doesn’t know where to begin.
The hunter’s face snaps up to meet Castiel’s.  “I am.  There’s nobody in the world for me but you.  The rest will fall into place eventually.”  Dean bites his thumb timidly.  “Are you happy?”
A short walk down a paved trail leads Dean to the long, gorgeous beach of Angel Cay.  He’s regretting going barefoot because the sand is fucking hot, nearly burning his feet as he does the hot potato dance down closer to the water.  He keeps searching the area for anyone because he must look ridiculous.
Dean’s fingers dig into Castiel’s thigh.  The omega remains still, waiting for the scene to play out.
Mesmerized by the massive flames, Dean ponders whether to approach Cas.  Does he even need to?  Snooping could do more harm than good in this situation.  There is always the option of asking Sam, Dean has little doubt that those two were together when the blood poured.  Again would stirring the pot be wise? Whether Dick Roman currently breathes doesn’t affect his relationship with Castiel.  That is solid.  Dean would die for his alpha; eradicating some evidence, well, that’s child’s play in his world. Although he would be lying to himself if he didn’t admit how curious he is about what happened.
The voice is familiar and, against Dean’s better judgement, so damn comforting.  He hears a deep sigh, Cas taking a moment to collect his thoughts before explaining why he did this.  Dean side glances to Charlie, who just taps her ears with a kind smile.  Her loyalty to Cas is undying; Charlie clearly knew of the deception.  He’s about to ask her about it when Castiel on the iPod continues.  The stair digs into Dean’s lower back, but he doesn’t move much less breathe.
“You pick,” Cas answers, bringing Dean to the center of the large living space and helping the man to sit down on a soft pillow.
Cas is strolling towards the hotel, when Dean glances over at Sam still panting on the sand.  The elder Winchester calls over to his brother, “Oh she can’t carry you back?  Bummer.”
“Nothing too grand,” Sinclair flippantly replies, patting Cas’s shoulder, “I had a wonderful phone call from your Aunt Naomi last week.  She informed me that my unique collection was missing something.”
“Shut up, Clarence.”  His friend bangs on the table harshly, which shocks him back into his chair.  “This means I don’t have to do the yucky stuff for a fucking year.”  She hisses the next part in his ear.  “I don’t ask much of you, but this, whatever it is, we will take, do you understand?”
“Hell yes!”  Harry dances around.  “Donna can suck it!  Spending the night watching a burnt house was an awesome idea.”
To any other person in the world, Cas remains stoic; to Dean, his face lights up with a hint of a genuine smile.  “One should never be judged on what we did yesterday, one should be heralded for what we wish to accomplish tomorrow.”
The statement makes him think of his own love bug. Meg would be up by now, munching on her Lucky Charms. Dean’s heart aches to hold his niece. The last few days have been such a blur, but God, he just needs Meg to ground him. He heads back into the master bedroom, noticing how quiet it is with Castiel gone. The Novak brothers are meeting for breakfast at the butt crack of dawn to discuss family business. Cas should be back to the condo by 9:30am at the latest. Dean grabs his cell phone, stepping into the living room and out onto the veranda, the New York sky line glimmering in the morning sun.
“Thank you, Gabriel.” He hangs up before he hears his brother’s reply. It was time to get ready for his afternoon with Claire.
Dr. Shurley strolls over to his desk to sit down, gesturing for Dean to sit on the couch. Typically Dean prefers to pace and stand during a session, but this isn’t about him.  “Yesterday Inias and I spoke in detail about this option, and he gave me full written permission to openly discuss any concerns or health questions you might have.”  The doctor flips open a file, placing his reading glasses on the tip of his nose.  “Inias has bouts of depression that have reacted well to medication; his biggest hurdle has been suicidal tendencies through starvation.”
“Fine.”  His father lifts Dick to his feet, strangling him until he realizes it's useless.  Clay creatures can’t die from mortal methods.
The words come out of the man’s mouth, but the omega is finding it difficult to process the meaning.  “I’m sorry, what?”
Encroaching into his baby brother’s space Dean whispers, “I took cash from a sleezy business man to rough up people who couldn’t pay their debts.  Damn it, Sam.  I broke three fingers on a guy while his son watched for three hundred bucks.  The whole time I told myself it was for you, to give you a chance I never had, but it was just a big lie.  I destroyed lives for money so you could shove shit up your nose.”
“I’ve been around Heaven since I was a kid.  Heard the stories about an omega who would bring the life bearers back to the angels.  Pretty sure you're it, buddy.”
He places the clean dishes in the drying rack as the buzzer for the cupcakes goes off.  Pulling them from the oven, he responds, “Not really sure.  Don’t you want to work on your numbers?”
The dom doesn’t even pause in his ministrations. Just keeps sucking like a vacuum, and fuck he’s added a fourth digit. Dean is violently trembling as his body fights against the onslaught of arousal rocking though his veins. He begins thrashing at his shackles trying to pull away from Cas, but the dom has him from the front and behind, there is nowhere to hide.
“On your feet, Winchester. Put your wrists out in front.” Two officers enter his cell, one with handcuffs.
The fog clears and Dean can see how royally fucked this Castiel will be if his dead mate’s family finds him.  “They think he’s harboring a true mate somewhere.  A hussy on the side who kept the claim bond from fully taking.”
Castiel can’t recall the last time he wore flip-flops. Still better than barefoot.  With a whiff of his person, he deems himself lacking in Eau de Toilette of Alpha bits.  He knocks on the door calling out, “I want to see Dean.”
God, Dean really wants Castiel’s hands, lips, knot like yesterday, but they need to have everything in order before they reveal their hand.  “Get me a fake knot.  I’ll do it here.”
Next, he traverses the tables to Hannah in the corner.  She’s sitting in a wheelchair with Jack in her lap.  “How are you?”
They both stroll into his new abode as she answers. “Castiel hates leaving the island, so sometimes business associates will have to come here.  Unfortunately they can’t all be winners.”
Compassion spreads across Dr. Tran’s eyes his lips pulling into a tight line.  “Dean, the anniversary of James’s death is three days away.  Absolutely no one can fix that regardless of their designation.  Castiel mourns the loss of his twin brother. You don’t repair grief.”
“I think it’s time to go in, Castiel.” Charlie pulls her pink raincoat tighter on her shoulders. The hood hiding her beautiful red locks, “You’ve been out here for over an hour.”
“AGAIN!”  Hannah yells louder, “we will abide by your wishes Dean.  You are under no obligation to meet or date or even acknowledge anyone.  Do you understand?”
The alpha can’t help his crush.  Dean’s sympathetic, yet he often feels as if he’s cheating on the alpha in the attic.  Castiel is his true mate.  No dinner or afternoon getting pie will alter his decision.  After a few more uncomfortable moments, Victor walks out the front door.
A grin plays against his lips. This is now Dean’s family, and MacLeod is giving him the option to be on the guard to protect the children of the brotherhood who never stood a chance.  There is no other choice, “Yes, and then we will make some plans.”
“What?”  Claire huffs. “Neither of us have any experience with knots.  I thought we might get some info from a person who has.  Aren’t you nervous?”  The last question is said directly to Dean.
“No, because it would mean leaving you with Lucifer.  I’d never wish that pain on you.”  Sam scoots closer.  “I love you.   Why would I want to cause you pain?  Dean, I have never blamed you for what happened.  Those responsible for my torture are dead.”
The shower appears spectacular.  Three sides of glass walls enclose the stone tiled space.  A large overhead rain shower and a hand-held sprayer with a nice, long, bendable tubing.  Castiel takes his personal hygiene seriously.  Dean sniffs.  He could do with a shower.
The hips on Castiel take the hint, shaking like he was born for it.  Dean shouts incoherent sounds at the sexy motherfucker.
“No, it’s not, you big moron.” This time her grasp is tighter and her voice rises.  “I will not have my patients spending the night on the damn linoleum.”
Castiel responds, “I’m sure Sam can have something together given he has weeks to prepare, but mated?  Gabriel, that is extremely dangerous.  Everyone will know?  You can’t hide that scent.”
“So damn poetic.”  The omega laces his fingers with his mate’s, pulling them so he can lace kisses over Castiel’s knuckles. A hard kick has Dean letting out a harsh exhale. The alpha places his free hand over the spot, and of course their son and his amazing aim hits Cas’s palm dead on. “Kid's going to be a good shot.”
“My name…” Dear Lord, what has happened to his throat? It’s dry and scratchy, giving it a low, gravelly sound that is much deeper and rougher than normal, which is saying something. He looks at the nurse in navy blue scrubs, with dark brown hair pulled into a loose ponytail and whiskey eyes, but still no aroma, which confuses him.
Rubbing his eyes harshly, Dean takes a moment to really ponder how his alpha can make things better.  Dean’s day has no breaks.  He wakes up, gets Cas, Gabe and Portia ready.  Then, while the nurses are present, Dean works in The Shed or runs errands for Meg. His assistant’s ankles are swollen, and shopping has become a hazard.  By 6 p.m. everyone leaves, and Dean has to cook dinner and care for Gabriel.
His scent expert goes motionless, Meg’s hand frozen over her belly bump.  The woman’s voice is quiet, a sense of dread in her tone, “murder is legal in a mate chase.”
“Chuck and I are cut from the same cloth.  We do what is best for Heaven regardless of our own desires.”
Finally, at 4:15 p.m., the two names from the lottery for Dean’s bracket are posted.  To ensure no duplicates, the first and last names are displayed along with an eight-digit code.  His name is missing. Castiel yanks out the leather satchel to snatch the green lottery slip.  Instead of finding the necessary emerald paper, he discovers a letter in Crowley’s handwriting.
Touching their noses together, Dean smiles softly.  “You didn’t know.  No one blames you, because I wouldn’t be setting my home on fire if I didn’t store 222 body parts in my basement for Daphne’s pissed off ghost to play with.”
When he enters the main room, he spots Hannah sitting near the dining room table at the far end of the space. She’s sipping a bottle of water while typing on her phone. She puts it away when the bodyguard notices her charge. “Oh good, you finally sobered up enough to join the living.”
“Your behavior in the trials will reflect on me once we have mated.  I will not allow such degrading actions.  Do you understand me?”  Ishim shouts, his voice rising in anger.
His baby brother bounces his head squirming a bit in his spot.  “Okay, that’s fair.  Umm, last time you were hear you mentioned something about cancer.  I was hoping you might tell me what’s going with your health …please.”
The omega waves off his brother’s assertion.  “Yeah, yeah, since the last time Dad locked me in the scent-proof closet for my heat.  Man, good times, being in the throes of heat with nothing but your hand and a bottle of gin to take off the edge.” Dean hisses, his eyes narrowing, “No of course you don’t, Sammy; I’m not playing around.  Soon I’ll be drinking for two, but until then I can make my own damn decisions.”
“Max came by to visit while I was in the hospital.  He mentioned there was an open townhouse in their complex.  Three bedrooms, lots of windows and an easy drive to the rest of the family.”
He’s expecting Sam to immediately head out, but instead his baby brother strolls over to Cas, holding out his hand.
Having not seen Cas all day is only revving up his anxiousness at the impending lunch date. What the hell is wrong with him?  This should be easy.  They even have an actual God damn chaperone.  A rap at the door startles him as blonde hair peeks around the doorframe.
He’s biting back the need to laugh. Claire and Meg, in just a week, have fallen into a sister-like relationship that makes Castiel so happy. It’s the best birthday gift ever.
Her eyes narrow in disappointment.  “Dean Winchester your heat will be here,” she sniffs the air near his neck, “by noon tomorrow if I had to guess.  Don’t you track your cycles?”
Shoving and yelling of where to stand in relation to the damn red mark hits ear piercing levels until Asmodeus whistles over the commotion.  Once they settle, he sighs, “No one leaves the chute unless an alpha snags your flag, which should have been sewn to the back of your shirt.  You may exit from one of the dozen black, translucent tube doors with the specific alpha or wait until after the trial to discuss the suitor.  Otherwise, keep those legs running.  If you aren’t lucky enough to be chosen, eventually the barricade will slide open for you to depart alone.”  He raises a pocket watch from his jacket. “Getting close, my dears.  Now, I do love a good show, so once inside the trial omega-on-omega combat is highly encouraged.  Bear in mind alphas who observe or join the Hunter Challenges are hoping for a brilliant, strong, and cunning omega.”
“Listen to me.  Most of my life could be described as a whirlwind of darkness.  I had no focus, no joy, but it was not Naomi Novak that brought light and love to my life.  She may be from the Novak family tree, but the sunshine that pushed away the grey clouds was not her.  It was you.”  A faint tear catches in his mom’s eyelashes.  “You are my light, the only thing I have ever truly loved.  I believe your world will be rocked in ways you can’t even imagine the second you scent your true mate, because it happened for me the first time I held you in my arms.  Be ready, and know I’m on your side.”
He simply must touch his mate.  Every instinct in his mind and soul are screaming to caress the motionless alpha in the snow.  Never has Dean wished for his voice more than watching people save Cas without him.  His touch will help.  Castiel has stated time and time again the value of being near his omega.  Yet, for every inch Dean moves forward Sam drags him back two.  Max isn’t doing any better.  The man’s face is wracked with tears, his screeching fear turning the broken sound hoarse.  Victor won’t stop vomiting.
His lovely toasty warm blankets are violently ripped from his body as Pamela shouts, “What did your Alpha say?”
The throbbing from his injury takes a backseat as this will require laser focus.  Dean jumps up, kicking his feet against the silver wall of the elevator.  He uses the momentum to push with all his might backwards.  Luck is on his side as he crashes into Lucifer, ramming the guy’s body into the opposing wall of the box.  Yanking with all his might the chain gives enough for Dean to slide his face under, falling to the floor.  Dean stands up, turning to face Lucifer.  He punches the guy hard in the nose, mostly because it felt good.  With the other man disoriented, Dean snatches the orange-covered shoulders, twirling Lucifer so his back is to Dean’s chest.  Instantly he throws his arm around Lucifer’s throat squeezing with all his might.
A touch of drool drips to the corner of his mouth, making Dean swipe it with his tongue. Cas tracks the movement of his mouth with intense cerulean eyes.
Castiel’s mind chews on his mother’s question. If the curse damns Dean’s soul, he would be condemned to hell upon death. Who would benefit from that?
Opening the door just a smidge, Dean takes the bag, filling it with everything.  He prays they burn the offensive fabric stained with vile fluids.  The omega passes it back to Hannah then locks the door.
He runs his tongue down Castiel’s neck, nipping at his claiming mark.  He samples the essence of fresh water, the salt of sweat and cinnamon with hazelnut coffee while roaming his hands all over the glorious flesh laid out before him.
Following the instructions Dean discovers a plastic Target bag holding a huge pile of cash.  As he counts it, “You put ten Gs in a bag people use to clean up dog poop?”
After several minutes of arousing pleasure, Dean lifts up to his hands and knees, flipping their position again.  Lowering his face to Castiel’s, he kisses the man with everything he has, letting all the desire drive his mouth and enthralled by lapping at the slick smeared over Cas’s chin.  While their tongues are playing happily together, Dean guides his hand back, stroking his alpha’s cock and settling it under his hole.  Gradually as he pulls away from the kiss Dean sits back, sliding down Castiel’s cock and groaning with the intense sensation of fullness.  Placing his hands on Cas’s abs, he uses the leverage to grind his hips up and down in a seductive roll.
“Do not tell another living soul about your telepathic connection with Castiel.  It must remain a secret.”  The angel pauses until Dean nods before continuing, “Also, do not trust every angel you meet.  We were once angels of the sky, pure and good.  However, we are now a fallen race, some of us more so than others.”
While they wait out the knot, Castiel covers them with an old blue and green quilt that is tattered from years of love.  Whispering into Dean’s ear, Cas answers the unspoken query, “My mother made this quilt by hand when she was pregnant with James and I.  She would have loved you, Dean.”
“I have no idea.”  His brother raises his hands in a placating gesture.  “It’s a lot easier to say and spell.”
Thank the heavens Dean thinks its nerves about boudoir activities, actually that’s not wrong. His freak out may be about both that and mating the beast. Holy Shit, this happening, and soon!
In the corner of the dance space, Missouri is standing next to a rather impressive sound system. She gives Castiel a knowing glance before starting the music.
A strike of a whip across his left butt cheek has Dean howling.  His fists tighten with sheer determination to not move.  Another hit across his right cheek.  Dean scarcely has time to inhale before a third smack lands on his left shoulder.  Swat after swat in rapid succession rains down Dean’s shoulder, back, ass, and thighs.  Cas trails his previous track with the soft hands.  The relaxed skin burns with rage from shock.
Dean rumbles loudly, the sound bouncing off the tiles. “Fuck, Angel, this is better than any dream.”
Slipping back through those double doors, Dean doesn’t even care that he can’t go too because everything he’s ever wanted is right here.
Dean covers his palm over his boyfriends, “Claire wants to see you, Sir. Gabriel made it very clear that she is the reason the trip is happening. Have faith in her.”
The beta claps her hands, smiling. “Excellent, I’ll go grab the paperwork and add it to Jack’s file.  Two of my boys finding a home, simply thrilling.”  She vanishes into her office.
“I was thinking maybe we do a compromise,” Dean offers, squeezing Cas’s hand. The tiny houses vanish as Hannah takes the last turn down the long drive towards home.  “We sleep in the same room like we always do, but in our own beds.  That way we can see but not touch until after the wedding.  I want our first night as husbands to be special, yet the thought of not listening to you sleep kills me a little.”
“Omegas, the local time is 11:40.”  The red gates slide closed, a loud clang marking the end of the choice.  Anyone here will remain until a drone carries them out or sunrays liberate them.
Leaving only one choice, he has to accept the gorgeous sensual Omega sitting next to him.   All of him.  The good, the beautiful, the bad, the Alpha killing, and the ugly.  Dean won’t ever stop. To properly embrace Dean’s darker side Castiel must understand it better.  Education breeds acceptance.
“Dean, I’m not supposed to tell you the details.”  Sam shakes his head, making his dark floppy hair bounce.  “You went into shock.  Scared the hell out of everyone, especially Castiel.  They had to spray him three times with heavy duty alpha spray to drop his ass.”
Hands cup his chin as Castiel brings his mouth in for a scalding, passionate kiss.  When their lips separate, the Alpha’s eyes are sizzling with power. “Do you trust me?”
Following the insurance debacle, Castiel forgot to ask Dean about setting up a face time.  Suddenly it’s Thursday morning, and he still hasn’t done his assignment.  He has his next therapy session that afternoon at 4pm, so it’s now or never.  Cas is kicking himself for doing this last minute, but maybe the lack of build up could be useful.  He decides to send a text requesting a moment with the hunter.
“Can we stop at Arby’s? I would kill for a Beef-n-Cheddar with curly fries.” He keeps his volume low because maybe stopping at a fast food joint is a no-no or something.
“You vile piece of poo.  A note?  I woke to a note saying that you were leaving for a week. Am I nothing to you?”  The anger in her eyes is fueled more by concern and pain than hatred.
“No, yet this needed to be done.  We have responsibilities to Claire and everyone else on Angel Cay.  I don’t like thinking about your death.”  The normal stern strong voice of his alpha trembles as he speaks.  “In a blink of an eye … poof, all gone.”
A dark smirk grows on the other man’s face.  The appearance is frightening and out of character.  “It’s my last trial …ever.  No prospects in my future, so I’m going to leave a mark.”  His eyes sparkling, Gadreel adds, “I’m planning on leaving a lot of marks.”
Holding his pointer finger out, Gabriel yanks a piece of paper from his back pocket.  He flashes what appears to be a legal document at Dean.  “You can read the boring lawyer talk, but basically in all the blah blah blah Castiel wants you to have full access to what I know with one caveat.  No questions about what happened before he landed in the attic.”
“I said you could stay if you behaved. I promised Winchester senior and his newly mated omega dinner. There is no way I can finish unless you keep those roaming hands over on that side of the kitchen.”
“Can I ask you something?”  This whole night has been some marvelously weird dream; shit, Puck could pop up at any minute.
“Romantic relationships are highly discouraged in a person’s first year of sobriety.  Did you know that?”
“I was waiting for 12:01 a.m.”  She lifts her hand to show an iPhone counting down and a cupcake in the other. “Happy Birthday.”
The Omega settles into his seat, biting into his PB&J when he notices the other pregnant Omega across from him.  She is female and very young.  Dean guesses maybe 18 at best, probably younger though.  She’s glaring at his sandwich with envy, so he tears it in half asking, “Do you want some? my brother made it.”
“You have me.”  Castiel growls chucking the supplies to the bed.  His angel makes quick work, stripping off his clothes while Dean gingerly drops his boxer briefs to the carpet.  The hunter is edgy, maybe a little skittish in his movements at first, but he takes a deep breath.  He trusts Cas.
He is alone with a mentally unstable person and two freshly deceased bodies.  Speaking of, the headshots are bleeding heavily, creating nasty crimson halos.  “Umm, lovely story, but what do we do about them?”  He gestures down to the dripping dead.
“Good.”  The hunter would have preferred to take the sadistic bastard’s life himself, but dead is still dead.  “Don’t ever call him boy again.”
His Alpha tips forward, the wickedly sharp teeth extremely close to the shell of Castiel’s ear. Dean whispers, “Hurry, little omega.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean heads downstairs to help put dinner together.  His entourage of merry MacLeod strays trails behind him.  The group enters the main floor as someone knocks on the front door.  Dean spins around with a confused look.  No one visits unannounced, yet everyone else stands with matching smirks on their faces.
Donna tosses her card as her eyes glare at the young omega, “Claire, wasn’t there something you wanted to talk with Dean and Castiel about?”
Suddenly the coldness rips across him, causing Dean to lean hard against the wall to catch his breath. He just needs Cas. This will all get better when Cas touches him and makes him whole again. The sub eventually makes it to the elevator noticing that the two guards just stand there and don’t get on with them, something is really off.
Surprisingly the huge steel door that leads to Cas’s lab is cracked open.  Dean grins, because Cas hasn’t put it in the doorbell yet and wanted to be completely available to his pregnant omega.  God, Castiel is perfect.  Well, okay he’s got a few shortcomings, yet to Dean that just adds to the pro list.  Stepping over to the sliver of light from the lab, Dean’s about to call out to his alpha when he hears an unfamiliar male voice.
Dean spins taking in the circular space with its stone walls and floors with four windows.  “It’s changed over the years.  There used to be two smaller beds in front of those windows instead of the one large one between them.  Many years ago, the tall set of shelves held children’s toys, slowly evolving into volumes and volumes of books.”  Bending over, Dean’s fingers ghost over the soft mahogany rug. “Until recently there was a blue rug.  This one is new.”
“It was pretty obvious when my alpha asked why I was such a pathetic breeder.  Crowley stabbed him in the heart with a syringe full of adrenaline, shouting, “Because you beat her, moron.”
“You will not be safe, Dean Winchester, until an alpha takes you as a mate. There are twelve of the most prominent and powerful alphas in Heaven waiting in a back room.”  She gestures to the quaint sunshine-yellow bedroom with multiple shelves of books. “Sam may wait here.  A fresh tub with bathwater can be arranged for him along with clean clothes. He might also enjoy reading here or the library on the first floor.”
Walking into the unknown gives Dean a natural high.  Cas might do terrible, delicious things to him, which would be amazing.  The scent of his alpha floats over and through him.  Another mysterious odor flits over his senses; Dean would hazard to guess a flame of some kind.
Embracing his lover the angel weeps, his heart shattering into thousands of pieces.  Castiel spins the sleeping man so his head rests on the dancer’s chest.  Taking his pointer finger, he discovers every freckle on Dean’s glorious face.  With each lift of his digit he reiterates his promise to the hunter, “I will be back.”
Nothing.  Her heart-shaped face, deep whiskey eyes and curly brown hair are familiar, friendly, yet he can’t think of her name.  Dean simply stares.
His dom crawls over his naked body, wearing nothing but a sultry smirk.  “Yes, but I take no chances with you, Princess.”
“Garth called me this morning.” Sam attempts to sit on the edge of Dean’s mattress, but Cas is having none of that.  The blue-eyed angel actually steps forward, blocking Sam’s attempt to get closer.
“May I say one thing on the matter?” April’s eyelids flutter in such a way Castiel worries she’s having a spasm.
Castiel pulls on his only button-up shirt.  A blue one Daphne bought years ago, in another life.  “What does Sam whisper in your …delusions?”
His mate catches him, responding, “They’ve been a couple for a month now, Dean.  How can Cain and Rowena dancing surprise you?”
“Absolutely NOT!”  Alicia screams, a touch of terror in her words.  “We can get you in easy enough, but at what cost?  Dean, the hard part will be getting out with your own mind intact.  I don’t think Max and I have the talent for an extraction.”
Castiel smiles at the compliment, blushing. His eyes take in the stunning Alpha before him. Dean is dressed in a tux as well, his alpha’s taut muscles rippling under the fine fabric, “You are quite handsome too.”
“There will still be,” Dean inhales, trying to pick just the right word, “issues for them because of who I am.”
The music is loud and eclectic, there is no rhyme or reason as to what type will be playing. Dean’s a little disappointed that there’s no band tonight, just a DJ. Ash is awesome, but sometimes his song choices are bizarre. Currently a slow song with that country twang plays as lovers shuffle around the dance floor.
As Dean is raising his hand to point at Cas, Meg grabs it, exclaiming, “Remember, we will all be there.”  She holds his hand still, giving her head a slight shake.  “You just have to finish the trials, and you will fulfill your role with the league.  Right, Naomi?”
He enters their temporary bedroom, deciding if a shower will help warm him up.  Cas is reading on the bed, shirtless.  A yummy sight.  The Alpha’s gaze catches his, “Did Charlie find him?”
“Are you fucking kidding me? What do you think happens to Castiel if you go to prison, Dean? PRISON! A place where it is extremely likely, that several large men will want to violate those girly lips.”
“Anything else?”  His alpha is clearly at his wits end over the heat situation.  When Crowley shakes his head Dean adds, “Just make sure he’s comfortable…well, as much as can be expected.”
There is one main road to town from Dean’s house, Cas has driven the route himself.  Nevertheless, he’s only been to Jody’s home a few times.  The Alpha should have paid attention.  He is now wandering through what he believes to be her neighborhood hoping to stumble across the correct house.  It had white pillars.  Nothing he’s seen so far has any damn pillars.
“Turn me around,” Dean demands, swinging his hand behind himself.  “I can’t do it myself, and I want to see your face.”
“Okay, so you left Jess’s parents' holiday party early, catching a ride with her cousin, and several hours later was arrested for attempted murder.”
With a grunt Cas shoves Dean upward until he can get his feet under him.  Once he’s done his business in the privy, Dean’s making his way down the hall.  When more kids come they will need more than one washroom on the second floor.  The omega is outlining a new floor plan when a figure at the end of the hall scares the shit out of him. “What the fuck?”
Castiel asks the taxi driver to drop him a block away from his intended location.  The dancer wants to walk up to the building, giving himself the chance to adjust at a slower pace.  He hasn’t been on this street since the ambulance took him away.  Gradually, Cas approaches the address; the sky has just a sliver of pink to the horizon.  He realizes he doesn’t have a watch, but waiting outside is a horrible idea.  It will just give his mind time to think of all the outcomes in the next hour.
“Idiot never learned where we keep the fire extinguisher.”  Meg waves off his concern. “Our youngest has a budding career in either pyrotechnics or arson.  Time will tell.”
Dean can sense the bond growing between them, unlike with alpha's its not a scent bond.  Instead omegas connect on an emotional level.  As the link intensifies, he and Claire will be able to feel the other's emotions even from a distance.  Eventually, the connection will be so powerful the two omegas will have the ability to take on pieces of the other's pain, permitting Dean to shield Claire from the worst aspects of heat. Some bonds last through childbirth, sharing the labor pains between them.
“Babe. You seem to be adding some endearments for me.” Castiel smiles, turning to face his alpha so the older man can view it. “I like it.”
Glancing down, Cas twists the ring on his finger while both his knees bounce wildly.  Whatever happens, he made this choice on his own to save Dean.  His hunter matters, the love he shares with that amazing man in the end, that’s what matters.  Nick can go to hell.  A smirk spreads across the angel’s lips because the gun pressing against his spine can help accomplish that task.
“First let me apologize for my Aunt Naomi’s behavior.  I am so sorry this happened; this should have been avoided.  There was a specific reason Jody assigned a guard to you.  Naomi refused to acclimate to your scent nor listen to any explanations about your specific designation.”
Cas nods, turning off the TV and following his alpha up to their room.  Holy crap, he now gets to say ‘their room’ or ‘our room’.  He’s grinning from ear to ear when he stops cold by the king size bed.  Usually he sleeps in his boxers or less, but maybe Dean won’t like that.  His query is answered before he speaks as his alpha strips down to his forest green boxer briefs and heads to the bathroom.
“Really?” Doug scrunches his nose questioningly, “Haven’t you even heard of the CW?  iZombie…the drink that makes people rage out like zombies…”
