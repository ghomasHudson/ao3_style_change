"I'll die!"
Sherlock was tired. His body ached and his head felt like it was being hit with a sledgehammer. His thoughts were more coherent than before but it was still a struggle to put a proper sentence together beyond a jumble of words. Every slight sound around him echoed in his head and bounced around his skull, picking out individual sounds proved to be complicated. The objects around him were in twos. Okay, double vision, check. At first, he was in the hospital having fluids pumped through him but between then and now, there was a blur and undiscernable voices.
"But wait, how will I know you'll stay true to me?" Jim asked, pointing a gun at John's skull. He had to be sure.
She waited patiently for him to continue and explain the matter of his visit, but she could guess it was a result of Sherlock’s behavior earlier that day.
He would have to start from the beginning. One simple question of how Moriarty rose from the dead. Of course, that was impossible and he couldn't obviously have done it alone. Sherlock pondered if he could even go to the bathroom by himself. He chuckled to himself as he opened a blank document and started to type furiously. John always used this computer for his blog, Sherlock realized and paused in his typing for a moment, wiping his hand over his face. The man was just everywhere. Just out of childish spite, he shut the laptop and replaced it on top of another and started over. It was all childish, how John was acting, it was his fault, of course, that they were in this position in the first place. If John wasn't everywhere in Sherlock's life, infiltrating his thoughts every few seconds, the smell of him lingering in the stuffy air of the flat, clinging to the furniture. It was his fault, like a drug, he concluded. It was like an addiction he couldn't shake, not that he wasn't used to that. John's fault that Moriarty had leverage against him.
“Eluka. Eluka!” he said frantically, his voice nothing above a whisper from lack of use.
Normally, Sherlock would try to make another break for it, but for once he thought about someone else’s needs and looked at John. Molly was right, he didn’t deserve any of this. He also realized that no matter where Sherlock ran, John would follow and he would never be alone again.
“Very vague John. I’m not surprised, however, she was acting very odd and I cannot figure out... Why,” He said, trailing off in puzzled thoughts. He could not wrap his mind around Molly being able to suddenly hide telling signs from him, almost like the-
"I'll stop solving!" he rushed forward as he spoke, but he knew the man before him was untouchable
"If you betray me, I kill both of you," He grinned, satisfied with his solution and looking back and forth between the men. Sherlock was an amazing treasure but what is the point if he couldn't be his.
After a painful amount of time, the cabbie screeched to a halt in front of the accused woman’s house. John told the cab to wait for him just by the off chance she was at work and they would have to double back before he walked up the walkway to her home. She lived a little ways from the city in a nice suburban area where you can imagine a doctor, although a mortician, living with her house squished, sharing a wall with one of the adjacent houses. The concrete leading up to her humble home felt longer than it actually was, each step echoing off the walls of the surrounding houses to John’s ears. He had made this walk many times, whether it be a friendly visit or a holiday or two, however, most of the time Sherlock was present. This was different. His guts squeezed and fell done to his toes like they were lead, making him nauseous and filled with anxiety like he has never felt before. Anger fueled his steps, his shoes hitting the stone harder the closer he got to the door.
"No! Leave him alone! What do you want!" Sherlock demanded, frantic.
"Figure it out Holmes," He challenged, his palms facing the ceiling. It was fascinating to watch his face as it goes completely blank with thought for a second, which probably felt more like a few minutes in Sherlock's little "mind palace". He had learned about Sherlock's memory technique from some of John's articles on his blog. The man did have a talent with the written word, but he mostly just read them to get into Sherlock's head and also look for little bits of him in the cases.
"Have I said that I enjoy seeing you desperate? I didn't even know you had feelings, dear Holmes," Moriarty marveld and stood, walking over to the pair.
“No clue, why is it familiar? What does that mean?” he hated to take wild guesses of the Indian doctor, he did not want to seem pretentious to assume she knows every one of the many dialects in India.
"Tell me they don't show how you think? How much you enjoy the mystery! The game in on! The race against time! You love to be smarter than everyone else. Makes you king. You love the power. Though, you like to be alone. 'You walk a lonely road' as they say. But John changed that, didn't he?" Moriarty purred teasingly.
"But wait, how will I know you'll stay true to me?" Jim asked, and points a gun at John's skull.
"No, no, no, Sherlock," He recovered, getting quite close. He was close enough to Sherlock that he could smell his breath. It smelled like gum and cigarettes. He noted the interesting combination for a later date. He didn't back away and stood his ground before the deplorable man.
“Yeah, yeah. Blah, Blah, I’m back from the grave and all of that jazz. You guys act like I’m Jesus, it’s getting old, honestly. I’ve only died twice! Really, Sherlock, you need to catch up,” he gaze flitting in Sherlock’s direction before back at John. Without being told, Molly again pointed the gun in the consulting detective’s direction, stepping forward and jabbing the barrel to his sweating temple.
Now in the center of the room, Moriarty was completely paralyzed from the next down, his head was being supported by a neck brace of sorts that was attached to his chair. That sickening grin which still held life that was taken from his limbs was clear through the haziness that hindered Sherlock’s field of vision. Searing hot anger pulsed through Sherlock, giving him enough strength to fight against his weak restraints. Molly immediately shrank and cowered away from the man’s very presence, it was obvious he had done something horrible to her, she just kept her eyes fixed on Sherlock in fear. Pain will drive someone to do anything.
"That isn't enough. How about a deal?" He proposed.
"What do you want from me?" Sherlock growled, his voice dangerously deep and infuriated. It was sexy, he should speak like that more. He shook himself from the thoughts that could wait until later and settled for an amused look on his pale features.
He didn't fear for his life but, he didn't want this game to end either. He knew he was only temporary, ever since Moriarty had shot himself the first time. He was specifically trained to deal with many situations; how to escape, how to maneuver and how to die. He breathed in one deep breath, one of his last, and exhaled, relaxing his tense body.
He sat down in thought, going to his mind palace in an act of desperate frustration and away from John. Ideas ran rapidly through Sherlock's mind, names of places, what he knew or Moriarty, what he knew of himself. He looks through the texts between Moriarty and himself again and again, trying to analyze it for clues but, sadly coming up with nothing. He groaned
“That is odd, Mr. Holmes is suffering from Lithium Toxicity, I’m sure you’re familiar. If he is not bipolar, I am unsure why he would be taking as much Lithium as he is. It’s not addictive so it is strange,” The doctor explained, looking over his charts again with a perplexed look, however, John was the most confused in the room.
“Leave her alone Sherlock, let’s go, you’re being an ass,” John said, nudging Sherlock and started heading towards the door. Sherlock was reluctant to go, what was wrong with Molly? He could always read Molly, she was the easiest person to read besides John. Also, she was being very abrasive and cold towards the pair, especially Sherlock.
Hours later, the sun dipped behind the horizon as he searched buildings himself while he sent some civilians from his homeless network to search as well. He had searched three warehouses at this point and his feet ached in his shoes. A light drizzle fell from the darkening sky, leaving Sherlock's coat damp and a chill that seeped into his bones. His phone was silent and he was surprised that John had not blown up his phone in the meantime, no matter how mad he was at him. Once the first few hours passed, he knew John would start to worry and he was growing concerned. This was very un-John like. Before he could continue to give the idea more thought, he approached the last building he needed to search. This building looked like all of the others, dark, grey, and lifeless. The cracked, crimson, brick glowed with the dying sun. It was odd, the lowering sun was still visible through the sparse ominous clouds that trickled their rain down. He walked passed the broken and rotten metal from the barbed wire fence to get to the equally deplorable door.
"I put you there," Sherlock answered, his tone obvious. John stared at the back of Sherlock's head for a bit over a minute. The man was impossible to figure out. He was such a git the day before, and now… it just made no sense. Without really thinking, he walked forward and placed a kiss on Sherlock's cheek before walking into the kitchen, leaving Sherlock completely frozen.
“I don’t believe that is any of your business,” she responded stuffily, putting her tools away and zipping up the body for the night. Sherlock examined her from across the room, looking for any telling signs but there were none. That was a first.
"I choose John," He finally said, his mind finally halting from its dizzying spin. He really didn't have a choice. Selfishness consumed him like a disease and controlled all of his thought processes. Moriarty smiled and backed into the darkness, not saying a word. He completely vanishes. Sherlock tried to follow quickly, but it is no use. The air vibrated where the man once stood and a sickening feeling built up in his gut as he frantically swiped at the air.
Metacarpals*: Bones within the fingers and hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
This was John’s view as he sat in his armchair, his new cane by his side. The stench that rotted the room was invisible to John now while resentment grew in his heart like a fungus. Sherlock had not spoken in a week now, a rattle settled in his lungs as he breathed. John was about to move from his spot to take a walk just so he didn’t have to look at the man when a surprising, rasping sound sliced through the room.
Aw don't ignore me Sherlock
"I can't see why not," Jim shrugged and motioned for the thug to let John go. He ran quickly over to Sherlock, catching him in a tight embrace, being careful of his broken fingers. They had already started to discolour.
“I have never seen our Sherlock like this before and neither have you, I take it? Have him take this. It’s in a way like a Xanax and is he doesn’t take it just sneak it in his tea,” she winked, “Before he hurts someone or God forbid himself by relapsing.” she finished and the way she said “Our Sherlock,” sent an odd chill down his spine. The tone was very off, however, he concluded it as lingering admiration for the man.
Once out in the living room, all of the curtains were drawn shut and the room was dark, much to John's delight. Sherlock sat in front of one of his laptops, typing away, in different clothes he wore yesterday. If Sherlock had changed, how did he not know John was in his room? Unless…
He let his mind wander when he finally hailed a cab and let himself be driven to his flat. Thinking John might be there but he knew better when the man was angry with him. He rolled his eyes at his temper and moved his mind to more prying situations. He saw Moriarty blow his head to bits inches from his own, how he managed that still baffled him. The main question in his mind was if he could do it again. Perhaps not come back from the dead, of course not, that was impossible. People didn't come back from the dead. There was an explanation, he just had to find it.
John paused in his train of deprecating thought on his obvious hangover to take a moment and process where he was. He forced his eyelids open and regretted it immediately. Once his eyes came into focus, he was instantly confused. This was Sherlock's room. How did he manage to get himself in there? And moreover, how did Sherlock not know? Surely he would've kicked him out by now to his own fold out bed in the living room. Deciding it was better to weather the storm now, he made his way slowly out of the room, the bedroom door opening with a creek that seemed louder than anything John had heard in his entire life. He hoped that Mrs. Hudson had already made him a cup of tea, she was such a thoughtful woman.
No, why would Sherlock break a habit? It was very unlike him, even with John. But there was no other reasoning his slow mind could come up with.
"Sherlock. Will you pull your head out of your ass for once and listen?" the inspector demanded, bringing Sherlock once again out of his thoughts. He sighed in annoyance and regarded him with a bored look.
"What did you do!" Sherlock yelled, recovering from his previous surprise and grabbed John's wrist, ignoring the pain in his fingers, John followed without question, and runs as fast as they could away from the building and down the street. Their feet pounded against the sidewalk, curious glances and horrified stares followed them along the way. A huge bang shook the floor of Bakers Street as the building they were just in not moments ago, blew sky high, debris scattering the street, smashing windows in its path. They eventually stop running, never looking back and Sherlock turned to John, halting their footfalls.
“They had to, you always run away at hospitals, or kidnapped,” John explained, his hand staying firm on his boney shoulder. Sherlock had been asleep for three days but it didn’t look like his partner had any rest in those two days. Just like himself, he was on guard, making sure to not let Sherlock out of his sight, fearful he would disappear again. Three days he was alone in his mourning for Molly, only to be visited by a handful of friends to share their condolences, many of them no doubt thinking that it should not have been Molly, no matter what happened. She no longer had many family members after Moriarty got to them so it was painfully lonely.
“He wants to see you suffer, Sherlock,” The statement could barely register through his foggy mind but as each minute went by things began to become clearer. He was thankful there was only one of Molly now at least, her figure still and statuesque near the single table.
"Hm, sounds nice," Moriarty smiled finally, the suggestion peaking his interest.
"Nope, no fun," he shrugged, hiding his emotions well.
"I can't! Tell me and I'll do it!" Sherlock yelled, his mind spinning panicky for answers. If it was anyone else, he'd be able to think. He would let the thug break a few fingers. But this was John.
“Not at all, why do you ask?” she inquired, but John didn’t answer. That could only mean that the Lithium came from Molly and he was slipping it into his tea, doing this to him. A wave of guilt washed over him, threatening to drown him with the realization that this was his fault but then a second blow hit them. The pills originally came from Molly. There was no possible way as a doctor she would mix up medications, coupled with the question as to why she had the medication lying around her house in the first place. His guilt fueled anger now filled his veins, infecting him like a disease, releasing all of the pent up anxiety, sadness, and frustration from the past few weeks.
"She's clueless, if you asked her she'd be more surprised that I had feelings for anyone," Sherlock answered and resumed playing.
"Oopsie! Better hurry Sherlock, poor John only has ten fingers," Moriarty cackled as Hans began to take hold of John's next fingers, the doctor whimpering in Moriarty would imagine as immense pain.
“I’m not saying you didn’t. It is just impossible,” she said as she rose from her seat and headed to the kitchen for a quick moment, breaking John out of his thoughts. When she returned, in her grasp was a small white medicine bottle that was unlabeled.
Snapped out of his daze once more when he realized John had been having a fit for the last five minutes. He seemed very irate about what Sherlock said seemingly indifferent. Sherlock rolled his eyes, he had always found that John would overreact to anything he said at the moment.
“The acid in pineapples? Why would there be-” Sherlock started before Molly cut him off in a proud voice.
The elevator seemed to be moving at the pace of molasses up to the ICU where Sherlock was being held. The lift would stop at every floor to pick up people from all over creation, separating John from his partner and the potential danger. The doors finally opened, revealing the hallway crawling with nurses, doctors, and residents, but John paid none of them mind and beelined to Sherlock’s bed which was obstructed by the medical curtain. Ripping the curtain to the side, his mouth open to explain everything to Sherlock, warn him about Molly but his words died on his lips. The bed lay empty, sheets tossed aside, the wires without a patient to attach to. John’s heart plummeted through into the center of the Earth with all the possibilities of what could have happened.
"We are being watched," Sherlock said, advancing towards the open window to look out. His phone rang again.
"Nope, no fun."
“Sorry? Lithium? Where would he have gotten Lithium? What else was on his tox screen?” he demanded. He racked his brain to try and figure out why he would take Lithium especially when Sherlock had a list of recreational drugs of his choice. This was new, but he could not understand what he would get out of taking Lithium on a case like this.
"Whatever do you mean Sherlock? I think I have won! Once and for all, the Mighty Sherlock is stuck with no way of escaping. You can't think your way out of this one," Moriarty leaned forward with an evil smirk planted on his pale lips. Sherlock said nothing, but wasn't about to give in, wasn't about to give up. Holmes forced himself to relax, taking a small breathe to calm himself. Obviously he wasn't thinking hard enough. What was wrong with him?
"Oh Sherlock, I heard what happened! Are you and John alright?" Mrs. Hudson's voice sounded from around the corner before emerging from her flat to greet him with worried eyes.
Redbeard. Sherlock's body jolted as the name rushed into his memory. Yes, just like that pain.
"Sherlock! No!" John spoke up, stepping out from behind Sherlock.
"People died, Sherlock," John said blankly, restraining to keep his voice under control. Sure, he was glad Sherlock and himself were still breathing, but at the cost of many more lives. Lives with families and lovers and he couldn't help but blame himself, scolding his relief that he was still alive and not blown to smithereens. It was all his fault.
"Tick Tock," Jim sang.
Suddenly, John busted out of his grip and swung around with a gun in his hand. Where the hell did he get that from? Sherlock thought, reaching out to grab it from his hands, but it was too late. The metal exploded in the doctor's hand, but he didn't flinch as a bullet splattered Moriarty's brain against the wall behind him. Another shot and another angry blank look from John, the thug fell to the floor with a heavy thud, the blood pooling around his body like a grotesque pond. Silence overtook the abandoned warehouse and Sherlock looked at his companion with complete shock and worry before a loud click resonated throughout the room.
“SHUT UP! Why couldn’t you just do your bloody job, you were supposed to figure everything out, how could you not notice what was HAPPENING TO ME!” She screamed, shaking more violently than before, “You never noticed when I disappeared for weeks on end!”
“I wonder how poor John thought of all that, hm? Too bad I wasn’t there to see it, I had to let my little birdy out of her nest, you see? I LOVE to see your face Sherlock when you realized it was her NO ONE believed you!” He began to yell, the veins in his neck protruding but the rest of his body limb and dead. So much animation in the limited facial muscles while the rest of him slowly seemed to be rotting away from lack of use.
"Be quiet John." he reprimanded him
"Not thirty," he clarified before continuing, "And you are sure he is dead this time?"
"Just tell me the deal," Sherlock said, looking calm and collected.
"The only thing I had going was that I also liked women," he continued, picking up the daily paper, "How'd your mother react, she seems very loving and kind."
“You know what I did? I had some friends from meet her poor wittle famiwy,” he spoke in a baby voice while Molly’s face twisted in pain. It was unknown how long this had been going on under Sherlock’s nose. He needed to win, there was no doubt about it, his drive to beat Sherlock at his own game drove him mad to a point past murder but now to torture. Molly trembled behind the broken man, the only thing keeping her from falling to her knees was the gun being held to the back of her head. While Sherlock was focused on Moriarty, his inhuman underling had seized Molly and held her at gunpoint..
Sherlock did not retort at his previous comment so he risked going down the stairs without a word. The gentle woman was busying herself away with simple household work of vacuuming her small flat when John entered. Noting his entrance, she cut the power to her Hoover and smiled calmly at the Doctor.
"Morning," he said, his voice gruff and heavy with sleep. Without turning his head to look back, Sherlock murmured a greeting in return.
"I'll stop solving!" Holmes said quickly, but he could tell how desperate the man in front of him was getting.
----------------------------------------------------
"Remember that you just thought your son was dead. I tell you he is alive and well and I suggest you keep that in mind before you no longer have a son. Have a nice day and best of luck," John said quickly as he started to guide her to the door, "Mrs. Hudson will show you out."
“Are you attempting to date again?” Sherlock demanded, getting annoyed at her change in her demeanor. He was not a fan of change and she was really starting to agitate him.
“That bodyguard I requested from Lestrade has yet to make an appearance,” he added with annoyance, he should have guessed as much knowing the man’s incompetence.
He couldn't help but feel disappointed when Sherlock's eyes flitted away from him, looking for an escape. He fought the urge to roll his eyes or yell for him to take those gorgeous eyes and train them back on him.
He kept his face straight and unreadable. Emotionless. Like always.
Moriarty
“Ah,” Moriarty started, “Nice of you to finally join us, you’re running a few minutes behind,” he said nonchalantly ignoring the dead elephant in the room. With sheer reflexes, his aim immediately went to the villain but he wavered, the shock of Sherlock being right hitting him like a ton of bricks.
"Your son is not dead, and I'm sure if you paid any attention to the boy then you would already know where he is," he said as he picked up his violin and began to play, tuning the woman out again. She was about to explode at the man, John distracted her war path with a piece of paper in front of her face.
"Tell me the truth Sherlock, you love how I can make you dance like you do? You thrive off of the mystery of me? Don't you," He asked, his voice holding no question.
At this moment, what John would give to have his own car and speed to the vile woman’s house. If he had told Mrs. Hudson, she would happily go along with him in her car and he would not have minded her dangerous driving as long as he got there with a swiftness. He hailed a cab and off he went, demanding that he would pay the cabbie extra if he would step on the gas and get there as quickly as possible through London traffic.
"I'll die!"
“You need to go to the hospital,” John said in rushed tones, yelling downstairs for Mrs. Hudson to call an ambulance. Sherlock looked close to fainting and John was afraid that if he did, he wouldn’t wake up again. He was frantically trying to grab for John, nearly falling to the carpeted floor before John attempted to catch him. His leg failed him and he crashed down with the weightless Sherlock, nearly crushing him. He was a paperman, two-dimensional and inhuman. The fall should have hurt, especially with the added weight of another human, but Sherlock was far from human anymore. It looked like he was in pain as his eyes got foggy and glossed over, darting all over the room but remained unseeing. He could not seem to find John's face but he had lost the little voice he had in him and mouthed the single word, almost in a warning.
"I can't see why not," Jim shrugged and motioned for the thug to let John go. He ran quickly over to Sherlock, catching him in a tight embrace. Moriarty grimaced at the sight but was comforted when he saw John's disfigured fingers, they had already started to discolour.
“Of course dear, you know I am worried about poor Sherlock. All he does is sit there in his chair in front of the computer. I haven’t seen him move! The dust builds up around him!” she chatted on while her hands busily worked on making the two teas. John nodded and grunted when it was called for in appropriate conversation while the gears in his head turned. He would take the tray with him back upstairs and slip the dissolvable pill in the drink. It is easy in theory but in practice, it would be a lot more nerve-wracking. He was banking on Sherlock’s compromised state of mind, it would go unnoticed.
Thank you for joining me on this near decade long journey, starting in 2013 on FFN. Thanks to those who were so patient with me and my slow uploads and the amazing support I have received. This is the first big work that I have completed and I could not be more proud of what I have accomplished. Because of readers like you and your kudos, it gave me the strength to continue this story and always adapt it for the better.
Without warning to explanation, the gun that was pressed to the back of Molly’s skull, her body wracked with sobs, was thrust into her hands. While this was a surprise to Sherlock, Molly held it tightly in her fists, her knuckles turning white. She was trained for this moment, told countless times she would be free if she did not comply.
"Moriarty is back," he said simply, wanting to just cut to the chase. There really wasn't anything else he needed to know, it was irrelevant.
Sherlock burned with frustration and anger. He wanted to shoot him right there, and end all this madness. But it wouldn't. He knew that. He knew Moriarty had eyes and especially guns on John and himself if he did so. What was he going to do? Think. Think.
Sherlock crinkled his brow in confusion and placed his phone back down on the desk, not hearing John's words. Before he could bring the bow back to the strings, his phone went off again.
Sherlock blacked out. Regaining his consciousness, he heard John’s voice in the background, like it was being spoken over the radio with a bad connection. His vision began to come into focus when he realized he was on his knees on the rough concrete, unsure how he got there from the toppled chair that laid halfway across the room. A soft gurgle brought his hazy mind back down to what he was on top of.
The sun shone harshly and John's eyes, his head pounding as if the rays slammed a sledgehammer against his temple. With a groan, he attempted to cover his eyes from the unwelcome light but with no success, everything was too loud. He could swear he heard Sherlock typing all the way through the closed door and out in the sitting room. He mused that Sherlock must be frustrated with something if he was typing that furiously on the poor, helpless, keyboard.
With the sound of the door shutting with a quiet click and John's sigh, Sherlock lowered his violin. It was obvious that this client had some sort of effect on John and he looked up to meet John's gaze.
He had to think of a way to get his partner to even take the prescribed medication. He preferred to keep poor Mrs. Hudson away from the fiasco, but she’s the only one Sherlock would take food and drink from without a second thought. If John tried to give him tea, it would be very out of the ordinary and superbly suspicious. Even Sherlock in his crazed haze would notice.
“That is a point of interest. I could be wrong but has Sherlock ever been to South India?” She asked him, not looking at him but at her paper.
“Is Mr. Holmes bipolar?” the attending physician asked, getting a thorough history on her newest patient. Sherlock was no stranger to this hospital, having situations with drug abuse in the past. Tubes were flowing in and out of the sleuth, frantically trying to pump what was left of him full of fluids. The nurses had to sedate the man, although they were afraid of the lack of proper sleep, he might not wake up again. His condition had quickly become critical and he now laid in the ICU with twenty-four-hour nurse staff watching his vitals and checking his heart. Whatever he was taking, it was a very high dosage which was quickly posed to start damaging his liver and possibly cause brain damage. Never before has the beat of a heart monitor sound so precious to John, it was a sign that Sherlock was breathing and very much alive. He was hooked to many wires, monitoring and checking to make sure that his brain waves were normal. John saw his boyfriend was like a sort of Frankenstein if the green monster was completely white and nothing but bones.
"What? Are you sure?" came his brother's response and Sherlock instinctively rolled his eyes. His shoes walked the rain soaked asphalt of the street as he spoke before stepping back onto the concrete from the sidewalk. The grey overcast was ominous and it was as if people knew. The streets of London were completely empty as he stomped through the dwellings of a local neighborhood.
"May I remind you, Dr. Watson, you were the one that pulled the trigger, not me," Holmes dead-panned, seeing John bristle with anger and hurt in stages. Disbelief flashed his companions features first, quickly covered by hurt and regret and even quicker, blanketed with anger and dare he say hate.
“Dr. Watson?” the doctor asked in a rush, believing that something was happening to his patient, unbeknownst to him, said the patient was missing. John quickly explained to him the briefest explanation of what was happening, trying to ensure that Molly Hooper did not getaway. Somewhere deep within him still didn’t believe that she could have done something like this and it was all a misunderstanding. She had a hand in saving their lives before and solving cases, she did not have the air of a murderer. John forced himself to think like Sherlock, attempting to deduce a reason why Molly could have snapped. It was a possibility that Moriarty was truly back, threatening her with her family or other civilians, knowing she was one few people close enough to Sherlock to get his attention or take him out altogether.
“I doubt even you, Sherlock, could survive an explosion of that magnitude,” Molly added. Usually, she would agree with everything Holmes said, but something had changed in her recently.
"Like that woman?" John deadpanned which caused Sherlock's hands to stop dead in their tracks. "She's dead, I don't know what you're-"
“I haven’t a clue. Maybe because he knows I won’t take him throwing a tantrum my way,” he shrugged, seemingly easily but Molly only continued to smile.
“Pectin,” she answered absent-mindedly, drawing her eye back down to her microscope.
"What did you do to me…?" he asked firmly but his voice only comes out in a hoarse whisper. Jim didn't answer, he just smiled, sitting in a metal chair not too far away.
Again, he could not form words for there were too many questions to be asked, but one thought was persistent in his mind and growing stronger. Where was John?
“You and Molly,” he responded coolly, looking through a bit of newspaper in his hands, thinking that he could maybe find a clue to a crime that Moriarty was attached to. Without looking up, he could nearly feel Sherlock roll his eyes.
“I’m going home, that is what is going on Sherlock,” she replied blandly, not meeting his irritated gaze. John once again nudged him, this time harder, feeling his own irritation growing. Sherlock had been so paranoid as of late and he wasn’t going to let him torment the poor Molly tonight.

"I will! I swear!" Sherlock said definitely, putting John behind him protectively. Jim sat for a moment to think, Sherlock would never stay if he could just run off with his precious doctor. The doctor and the consulting detective, he sneered in his head. What a sick kink. The consulting detective and the consulting criminal sounds much more appealing
"We tried that," Moriarty frowned, getting bored.
Before he could give it further thought, the wooden door in front of him opened to reveal the surprised look on the mousy woman’s face. John could not tell before, but she looked older, significantly older, and haggard. He felt a rush of guilt wash over him when he realized that they had been friends for a year yet he had no clue what went on in her daily life outside the mortuary.
"That isn't enough. How about a deal?" He proposed, an idea blooming in his brilliantly evil cranium.
“John? What are you doing here? Is there something wrong?” she asked, opening the door fully and gesturing him to come in. John nodded in thanks and stepped past her into her home. Her walls where cyan and her decorations are white, very well put together and sophisticated. He was not surprised by this discovery, it made sense by the way she kept the mortuary, everything had its place.
"Are you Mental!" He demanded at John. His John that he could have lost that day.
“You’ve been asleep for three days,” John said softly, nothing short of reading Sherlock’s mind and the only question he did not know. So that was it. Moriarty finally dead for the third time and hopefully staying that way and day three of Molly being gone to, which he couldn’t bring his mind to fully understand that fact. It was needless, but probably the only reason why him and John were alive right now. It was a distraction that no one expected, causing Sherlock to leap into a fury of action and murderous rage. Her death saved them both but he still felt that it was in vain. If Moriarty could live twice, why couldn’t she just once? He didn’t have time for these thoughts, he had to make sure he was really dead.
"Don't move Sherly," he snickered, slightly embarrassed it sounded more like an amused giggle. It was then that his henchman Hans came from the shadows with John, holding the man's arms painfully behind him. John was a little damaged, so to speak. His skin speckled with bruises and a few cuts on his face which Moriarty blamed him for when he had fallen. The bruises, well, John had woken up not too long ago and was not happy about the circumstances he was in and needed to be knocked out. That's what Moriarty told Hans to do, but it must have really been a struggle if John was that badly bruised. Not that he cared, but it seemed to work in his favor to see Sherlock as worked up as he was.
"So you enjoyed my little show for you?" he smiled smugly at him from across the vast room. Sherlock took the moment to survey the room and measure the amount of danger he was in.
Sherlock needn't clarify, Lestrade knew exactly who he was talking about. The man in front of him sighed once more, slightly annoying the consulting detective with the loudness of his breathing which he found completely unnecessary.
"Sherlock!" John's voice reached his ears from the static darkness. He thought that all of this must have been a dream. Wherever he was, it was oddly calm. If that was so, why was John so panicked? Why was John there? He started dabbling in the idea that he was dead for a few moments. He tried to speak, but nothing came out, his voice barely a whisper. He opened his eyes slowly but everything remained blurry like before. No, he was not dead. Is that really John he saw? He couldn't be sure. It sounded like John.
“If inserted in one's fingertips, it will permanently rid someone of their fingerprints,” she informed quickly. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel slightly taken aback for being shown up in terms of knowledge. However, before he could utter another word, he was hit hard by a fact he should have seen all along. Of course, he had seen them, very small ticks, a missing mole under his eye. He Should have known.
"Miss Hudson made tea already," Sherlock added, turning back to the screen, not looking forward to dealing with a hungover partner the next morning. John was a pain enough as it was.
He knew he should get to sleep soon as well, but he never liked to sleep in the first place and at the current moment, he wouldn’t be able to sleep when he was troubled about Moriarty and more trivial issues like John vomiting profusely. Also, apart from him knew that he wasn't sure about sleeping in the same room and bed as his possible boyfriend, but he shook it off, going back to typing rapidly on the computer. Tomorrow was going to be fun, he thought sardonically.
“Now I am not making excuses for his dastardly behavior, but, I must explain that is it not out of thin air. He’s become completely unhinged, Molly, as you understand. Sure there have been cases he hasn’t been able to solve before but this is different. None of the villains have ever mocked him and personally endangered him. I told him he was tossing mad for the things he said to you earlier,” John explained to her, hoping she would understand given she understood him, and much to his delight, she laughed lightly.
"Be quiet John," Holmes reprimanded him.
“Molly!” he roared, marching over the door but was met with nothing but silence. The rat was either hiding or had made her escape to the hospital. Everything was so tidy inside, very unbefitting of this traitor. The enraged doctor cursed loudly and turned tail back to the cab, slamming the car door behind him, directing the cabbie back to the hospital. The driver was visibly afraid and uncertain if he would get in trouble for driving a man who just committed breaking and entering. Normally, John would apologize and offer to pay him for the man’s bravery for driving this deranged with hatred around London, but this deranged man was too distracted. He demanded the cab driver to step on it and get to the hospital as soon as humanly possible, tacking on a “a man’s life is in danger!” at the end of his instructions. If the poor man was not afraid before, he was now but he was dedicated to being apart of saving this mystery man’s life.
By this time, it had been weeks and Sherlock spoke less and less, and if he did, it was in some different tongue that John could not place. John’s fingers finally healed, although they were stiff, however, not enough for him to lose his medical practice and at this point, that was their only income. There were days that John wanted to leave, knowing Sherlock wouldn’t notice but would then realize he would die of starvation or dehydration, whichever came first. Mrs. Hudson seldom came upstairs to them anymore, she couldn’t stand to see Sherlock the way he was nor the smell coming from him. His body was in a vegetative state, all but his fingers which moved like lighting. Bone-white skeletal fingers danced over the keys in thousands of pages long google docs and hundreds of internet tabs.
“No, it was him. I saw him, Molly,” he told her, leaning forward slightly as the memory of that day ran rampant through his mind. His wrapped broken fingers ached at the memory. Since the incident, John had frequented his old therapist to avoid any post-traumatic stress that could begin to surface. He was told his fingers could possibly not be the same again but, he was going to make sure there was no other damage Moriarty could haunt him with.
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly’s glow, her kindness, and selflessness made her loved by everyone she met. She was a shy mouse, so kind it was so easy to take advantage of her. The old Molly had died somewhere, leaving this rotted, grotesque body behind with demons no person can imagine. She was possessed with such rage and such sadness that it squeezed every inch of life out of her, wracking her husk every moment, with every pound of her heart in her hollow chest. She had to be in there somewhere.
"What do you want from me?" Sherlock growled, his voice dangerously deep and infuriated. The sudden change in tone, Moriarty looked taken aback but mostly amused. This game got more and more entertaining when Sherlock would surprise him. Pity how he gave in to Juvenile frustration.
"Don't move Sherly," Jim giggled as a big bulky man who held John in place walked out of the shadows. The man held John's hands painfully behind his back and a gun to his head. Sherlock's companion looked a little worse for wear, spotting a scratch or a bruise here or there on his body.
Just as he was finishing the list and starting to narrow it down, the door flung open and John stumbled in a little past midnight. His hair was disheveled, his button up was untucked from his trousers. The look was pulled together with his bloodshot eyes and scowl that instantly found Sherlock typing away at the desk, looking back at him. The decision whether to make a smart quip at John's appearance or not was a particularly hard one.
“Oh, no I am not upset! Sherlock has said much meaner things to me, I’ve learned that he is very harmless,” she said sweetly, “However, he seemed as indifferent to you as always. Any reason you think I was specifically targeted in his tantrum?”
"I-I'll-I'll be with you!" Sherlock gasped, his offer surprising him. He wanted to happily accept, letting his demeanor shift. That is what he wanted in the long run but what was the point? Sherlock would never be his, not like this and not like that. He would never stop trying to find a way to get away and even kill him. As much as it hurt him to say, he'd have to go about this a different way.
“You do make sure to look after him?” she asked sweetly and John nodded. He was silent when he left the room with the tray balanced in his broken fingers. Each step he forced himself to become more confident in himself that Sherlock would not notice. He paid no attention to John these days anyway.
"Oopsie! Better hurry Sherlock, poor John only has ten fingers," Moriarty cackled. Sherlock began to panic, not coming up with anything quick enough.
“Besides the Lithium, it was clean,” She answered, double-checking the tox screen report that was attached to her clipboard. He looked at her dumbly, trying to find the words, “There was no Xanax on the report?”
He stood in the middle of his flat, letting the silence engulf him in his partner's absence. The seat where John usually sat, remained empty. However, he had been used to that, John didn't sit there every second of the day but, for once, his partner's absence bothered him.
"Anything."
"Have you gone completely fucking mental?" Lestrade demanded, his fist slamming down on his desk, so much so that Sherlock could hear it echo throughout the office. John and himself had been in that office for hours now, in the same rickety chairs obviously that had been used since the 80s at least. Or that is what Sherlock guessed by the model. But his guesses tended to be right anyways.
“Just fine Mrs. Hudson, Thanks. Mind making Sherlock one as well? I doubt he’s slept in days,” he said casually, sitting at her small kitchen table by the window. The sun came in warmly through the fogged glass, painting the table orange with its rays. It was a scene unfitting for attempting to drug a friend.
"I um, I'll… Commit a crime!"
The world around him started to clear. That wasn't John. He felt his stomach churn and lurk and he was overwhelmed with the need to throw up. Jim was hovering over him, a smile wide on his face.
"Fun little trick, isn't it?" Moriarty questioned, keeping his hands behind his back formally. It was very entertaining to see such a proud man, brought to his knees by a few simple pills of Ayahuasca*.
Moriarty smiled and the thug opened the door, revealing the cool English night outside. The look in John's eyes as the started limping towards the door had the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end in warning. John was going to pull something before Sherlock could stop him.
On first glance, the inside was bare, covered in cobwebs and reeked of mold. Once his eyes adjusted to the darkness, the gears in Sherlock's head began to turn as he tried to spot anything out of the ordinary about the large and unfortunately empty room. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary and Sherlock decided to move on. This was the last building he needed to check, there had to be something there. It took nearly another hour of searching the abandoned building and Sherlock was exhausted. He had restlessly spent his day searching into dead ends and he was getting tired of playing Moriarty's game. With a sigh, he leaned against a door, he previously found as locked and was stunned with the entire door gave way under the pressure of his body. The door slammed against the concrete floor causing rust and dust billow around him in clouds, making him choke on the particles that danced around him. Once the debris settled and bruises began to form under Sherlock's skin, a skin crawling voice emerged from the darkness, allowing the hairs on his arms to stand on end and his heart seize in dread.
Also, you may have noticed this chapter is almost a replica of an earlier chapter “Snap”. However, this is simply the same chapter from “Moriarty’s” point of view to show the reader that this is not him, instead a look-alike named Edward Cooper. I hope this clears up any confusion!
"I'll work with you!" At that, Jim froze. That did sound very intriguing. Once Sherlock and him were close enough, John could take a long walk off a short pier so to speak.
“Tut tut Sherly, that’s no way to speak in front of a woman, it is ungentlemanly,” Moriarty reprimanded, twitching his head to the muscular man who shoved Molly forward, the gun still in her fragile, shaking hands.
“You should have died that day!” Molly screamed, her face flushed with rage and agony. The gun in her hand shook violently but it never once pointed away from her target. Before Molly could continue her tirade with a very please Moriarty watching his plan unfolding before him, the door opened and in burst a gun-wielding Watson, way ahead of the police that was on his tail. In a way, John had become more like Sherlock than he would ever care to admit, busting his way through, guns blazing and without backup. Fueled by body wracking fear and anger, vengeance alone made him feel invincible and more than capable to save Sherlock and bring justice himself. Furthermore, times like these are when his old military training had clicked in his brain, he had a duty and he was going to fulfill that, no matter who was in his way. At the moment, it was Molly who turned the gun towards his direction like some sort of Mexican standoff. The guard who stood firmly behind her, moved to action to charge John, his footsteps echoing loudly off of the concrete flooring but without a second thought and a mere gaze he fired his weapon at the man. Stopped dead in his tracks, the man dropped to his knees before hitting the floor with a meaty thump, blood smoothly flowing out of the hole in his neanderthalian skull.
“What is?” Sherlock snapped up at her from his spot on the linoleum floor, catching a stress ball mid-air as he was fiddling with in the meantime.
“Dr. Watson?”
"Where are you off to?" she asked, "Where is John? Sherlock what's going on?" She demanded, but once again, getting ignored. He continued to sprint down the stairs and out the door into the cold English night. He got tired very quickly of the cab he had called starts to walk down the slightly crowded street. On his way, nearly to his destination, he happens across one of the members of the "Homeless Network". He couldn't help but let a small smile perk the smallest smile on the corners of his lips when the thought of John making fun of him for the name. Lucky for John, they were much more than a name and could be a lot of help to them both. Perhaps all of England. Saved by the homeless. Also irony, it has been quite common lately, Sherlock concluded and then set his mind on his current task
It didn't take long for Sherlock to make it back to his flat, discovering he was right in assuming John was not there. Knowing the doctor, he was at a bar not too far down the street.
“He blames me, doesn’t he?” she deadpanned and John couldn’t help but let the look of surprise wash over his face.
Almost on queue, John tore himself from Sherlock's grip holding the gun with his unbroken fingers with some difficulty. Hans must have forgotten to check him for weapons, what a fucking dolt, he growled to himself. It didn't matter anyway, he was ready by the time the shattering shot tore through the air at him.
“Tea, Sherlock,” he spoke up as he entered the room, placing the cup and saucer next to the closest laptop. The deranged man simply nodded and sipped with the steaming liquid without a second thought. Relief streamed through John’s veins and a mysterious drug rushed through Sherlock’s. He had no idea what he had just done.
"You are quite easy to see. An open book as they say."
“What did you say?” John said, rushing forward to him, thinking he misheard.
"Where did Molly's boyfriend come from? Not aware you two were mates," he pouted, feeling the sting of jealousy in his intoxicated body. Sherlock shut the laptop briskly, not in the mood to have John and his drunken escapades ruin his train of thought any longer. He pushed the chair away from the desk and stood, walking over in front of John who looked like he was having a hard time focusing on his figure. He leaned down, hooking his arms around John's sturdy waist and heaved him up. With a grunt, John leaned heavily against him, struggling to even keep standing as Sherlock maneuvered him to his bed.
If there was any change significant enough to note, Sherlock had begun whispering to himself. There were even times that is was not English but some language that John didn’t understand. From what the doctor could gather was it was an endless string of theories that whistled through his chapped lips. However, John thought nothing of this development and simply chalked it up to further aggravation as more time passed and the issue lay unsolved. Often, John was just a ghost that delivered food and tea, no matter how little Sherlock ate, he always had his tea. There was a small switch where Sherlock had started to drive more and more coffee, which made it slightly more challenging to slip the medicine into whatever he was drinking. It was a good day if Sherlock even addressed John at all, although it was never more than a word or two.
“Eluka*”
For the first time, and fearfully, the last time, Sherlock said something John would have ever imagined come from his mouth.
"Back to business then. How many exactly died?" He asked casually, Lestrade settling in his desk chair with a sigh.
The list was surprisingly extensive, easily reaching over three pages of names. Everyone in the medical and the police department, except for those like Lestrade.
“Not a problem, I wasn’t busy,” she said, taking a seat opposite of him. “Tea?”
"We tried that," Moriarty frowned, getting bored. He knew Sherlock was more creative than that. And really? Would he die for that square? Really pathetic.
"This may be hard to hear, Mrs. Willams, would you like some tea?" he asked as he wrote. The woman looked at him incredulously, "Would I like some tea?! My son could be dead in a ditch somewhere and you ask me if I would like some tea?!" she demanded, standing to her feet, her face turning puse in her agitation. Unable to hold back anymore, Sherlock addressed her for the first time since she came in.
"As sure as we can be," he finally answered after a few moments and Sherlock didn't need to read his demeanor to tell that he was unsure.
John wracked his brain for a quick answer, he would be damned if he hurt her feelings by telling her that she is being blamed by one of their closest friends for the return of one of the most notorious criminals the world has ever known.
"Not in the slightest. Amateur."
The drug must have really done a number on Holmes, the pressure of John's torture as well to not notice the subtle differences. The missing mole under his right eye, barely noticeable to a normal passerby, but it was something Sherlock under normal circumstances would have noticed. Also what was amiss was the lack of small wrinkles on his face. Somethings could not be fixed by simple plastic surgery and again he was lucky Sherlock was too drugged up to even realize. Good thing too, it would give away the whole surprise and he only wished he could see Sherlock's face when he found out the truth. The look of betrayal, dismay, and realization would have been priceless and downright sexy.
"Meredith, was it? Your son is in perfect condition, I am sure. I've written down a few addresses where you can check. What Sherlock is saying is that your son might be gay and dress as a woman in his spare time," John said a bit awkwardly, fearful of the mother's response. He could tell as her face started to contort with rage that she was not fond of his analysis of her precious son.
John agreed and took the bottle, shaking off his troubled and silly second thoughts. He agreed with her, maybe a more relaxed Sherlock would think clearer. He still had second thoughts about substituting his drug addiction with a possible new one but something had to be done. He was losing it. John hated seeing him like this and he knew Molly only had Sherlock’s wellbeing in mind when he took the bottle from her with a nod of thanks. He was thankful that Sherlock had stayed clean for almost two years now, however, with the way he had been acting, he feared for a relapse, he would do what he could to prevent that.
In this case fear, auditory and visual stimulation
“John should be joining us soon, you could have at least spared him, John doesn’t deserve this,” Molly spoke again, anger tinting her voice with a side of frustration. She finally turned to him for the first time and he could see her clearly. He was sitting and a deep pit of fear was forming in the pit of his stomach. There was no way this wasn’t going to end badly and the only thing Sherlock could do was pray to a God he didn’t believe that John would stay away.
"Bloody hell, Sherlock," Lestrade groaned once the door slammed, the glass shaking with the force of the door being shut so violently when John stormed out. He didn't respond and just watched the door that John left so heatedly out of. He may have been a bit too tough on him. He would calm down, Sherlock decided quickly.
“Fuck you,” Sherlock spit, trying to get his nimble fingers to undo the loose knot that bound his wrists. He lacked the function of his fine motor skills in order to complete the task and he shook with frustration.
He stood up in a huff, half past midnight, completely ignoring the table and walks right over it. He grabbed his beloved scarf and walks briskly out of the door, brushing past Mrs. Hudson. He would have to apologize to her later, reading by the bags under her tired eyes, she had gotten as much sleep as he. Probably in worry. The woman worries too much, he decided.
"John?!" Sherlock called back, his head whipping quickly to face the direction the voice came from. Only seeing a slight glimpse in the darkness, but he was sure he'd be able to recognize John's silhouette in a room of shadows. He was sure.
"And another thing! You clearly are ignoring the fact that all of those lives could have been saved! What is two people compared to the around thirty that lost their lives?! How could you-"
He saw Sherlock unsteadily rising to his feet, his own body looking fragile under the pressure of gravity. How cute, he quite liked the vulnerable state the man was in. Jim was even most amused at the thought of how he will be when John is brought out.
“Molly please, think about this!” Sherlock said, the knot so loose now, “Make the right choice Molly,” he pleaded with her, the panic inside of him rising so quickly he could burst from the sheer stress. He continued to beg, one last-ditch effort to stop her finger from pulling the trigger. Her eyes met his blues, they shimmered from fresh tears. His pleas were met with silence, her mind working a million miles an hour, knowing she could not do this.
"Your little 'shows' are childish really," Sherlock rolled his eyes at the pathetic man, still calculating plans for escape.
"What are you going to do Sherlock?" he challenged, his grin widening to almost painful lengths. Realizing he had forgotten the plan, he added, "Better think fast," as he watched Hans grab one of John's hands and took a hold of one of his fingers, bending it backward slowly.
If John could, he would jump into the front seat and take the wheel himself, the cabbie wasn’t driving near fast enough for the doctor’s needs. Added on top of that, the traffic was particularly bad today and they were caught at nearly every stoplight. He was not sure if she would be at home either. John could have kicked himself at that moment; Molly works at the same hospital that they were just at and she most likely worked that day. He would just have to hope that that wasn’t the case.
Maybe it hadn’t kicked in yet. Maybe one pill once a day was not enough to kick in so soon. John was a doctor and he knew medication took to different people at different times. He trusted Molly and her expertise and himself as a doctor. With the years of drugs and Sherlock being eclectic as he was, it would make sense it would take a while to kick in. The stress from trying to frantically find how it was done began to build. The only thing that made sense was to just up the dose a little, Molly even backed his decision. It was hard to look at the ragged, unshaven man, curled over the light of the laptop like a hunchback, and think logically and unbiased. Like a doctor should.
“Isn’t it very like me to be late to my own party? My bad everyone!” Moriarty rang cheerfully, being pushed by a brute of a man that could barely be described as human.
“I’d be late to my own funeral, so I’m told but as far as I have heard, I’ve had two and I haven’t shown up at all! Isn’t that right Sherlock,” he spoke, his voice velvet and triumphant, causing Sherlock to nearly go blind from rage. The excursion he was putting on his frail body cause him to almost pass out as he fought against his restraints to strangle the crippled creature.
"I saved us didn't I?" he shrugged, out of breath. Freigning aloofness to what just transpired, but Sherlock could see the terror in his eyes.
"Whatever do you mean Sherlock? I think I have won! Once and for all, the Mighty Sherlock is stuck with no way of escaping. You can't think your way out of this one," Moriarty leaned forward with a smirk planted on his pale lips. He had Sherlock exactly where he wanted him and Jim couldn't be more pleased. He saw Sherlock take a calming breath and straighten his spine. He was so much taller than himself, admiring how appealing he was. He could literally just eat his heart out. But there was no time for that now, the show was about to begin
From the corner of Sherlock's eye, he could see John in his usual chair, his lips tilted upwards in amusement and trying hard not to laugh at this clueless woman. The story had gone way past it's expiration date to be any kind of entertaining for Sherlock. He wanted to tell the woman to just shut up and get out of his flat, but both John and Mrs. Hudson made him swear to be nicer to his clients, especially those who are distraught. That being said, he sent a pleading look at John to save him from his misery.
He cut off his train of thought and realized that it wasn't productive. He didn't have time for petty thoughts and wanderings. He walked swiftly to one of his many laptops set up and opened it in one movement. John had scolded him before for not having passwords to any of these devices, however, passwords took too much time, there were more vital issues at hand.
All of these thoughts raced rapidly through his mind. But he had been quiet for too long.
Snap.
John sat next to him, one hand completely in a cast while the other just had splints on the broken fingers. It had taken the doctors a few hours to put John’s fingers back together, which involved, realigning the bones and popping the dislocated joints back into place. No significant damage was done to his metacarpals*, which was extremely lucky, but John would still have to go through extensive physical therapy to return his fingers back to normal.
“That is what I am saying, it- this,” he indicated to the body, “isn’t Moriarty.”
“Sherlock’s right, Molly. He disappeared for years, just like Sherlock. One almost has to think of them as the same person,” John reasoned with her, seeing Sherlock’s side even though it was a long shot.
"Of course I'm sure, I'm always sure. Find him," He said quickly, there simply was no time for small talk and useless inquiries. It didn't take him long to be able to give Sherlock some suggestions of places he could be set up. Moriarty was slippery, devious and cunning, but just like any criminal, he was predictable. It was always an abandoned building or warehouse, anywhere that was considered condemned. Sherlock had to think what location would would be more like Moriarty to inhabit for the time being.
“Go on?” she easing herself back into her seat.
“I suppose. Thank you, Molly, so much. I will get out of your hair,” John said as he rose from the seat. Their goodbye was quick with a slightly awkward hug before John was out of the door back to 221B feeling much lighter. His concern for Sherlock, however, worsened and he really hoped the remedy he got from Molly helped. As he thought about it, he really should have asked what the name of the drug was so he could research it himself or at least know exactly what it was. But he trusted her, she was a doctor as much as he was, with a specialty in the dead rather than the living. He did make a note in his mobile to ask her next time he saw her, doctor to doctor.
“Pardon? He isn’t bipolar, he is a high functioning sociopath, however,” he replied, confused by the question that seemingly came out of the blue.
“Oh, I’m sorry, what was the question?” he snapped out of his reverie.
Thank you so much
Miss Me? :)
"By who?" John demanded in confusion as Sherlock slammed the window shut, his stomach sinking to the floor. He didn't answer, he just stood near the window a million thoughts running through his mind. This all seemed oddly signature. But how? There was no way. Sherlock tried uselessly to shove back the absurd notions that were filling his brain. It was simply an exciting new case, one worth pursuing. Yes, that was it, something exciting to finally solve. All of his cases were lackluster as of late and he was itching for his next fix.
Molly barely flinched, but Sherlock could see the terror in her eyes. She saw dead bodies on a daily basis, it came in the job description, but the vision on her own body on a cold metal slab drove a shiver up her spine.
"I don't want bloody tea," John snorted haughtily and flopped ungracefully onto his armchair. Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his boyfriend throw his apparent fit he was having. He also ignored the fact that he had referred to John as his boyfriend in his head.
“Where did you go today, John?” Sherlock’s voice sounded from behind a laptop screen, the fluorescent light illuminating his pale face. He had not moved from that chair all day, he was there the second John left that morning until long after he returned. Actually, he was surprised Sherlock noticed him departing at all that day, let alone returning.
“Dr. Vudatha!” John shouted in his panic, whipping the curtains aside to see if Sherlock was anywhere around. It was not unlike Holmes to wander away on his own accord at hospitals but now was not the time for a game of Where’s Waldo?
“Okay, what is it?” John demanded, once inside their flat at 221B Bakers Street. Sherlock was by his music stand, staring at it, but not seeing it at all. He usually composed his own pieces so for him to be looking at sheet music was odd and very out of character for the detective.
"Then who am I Sherlock."
“Why am I here?” John groaned under his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose with his fingers. He pressed the doorbell with his elbow the best he could manage before he could change his mind. Without much thought, he had gotten into a cab and given the cabbie the address to the flat of Molly Hooper. A strange part of him felt that although Sherlock was a big boy, it was his responsibility to apologize on his behalf. He would just simply explain Sherlock’s irrational behavior, leaving out the part where he is pinning her as an accomplice to Moriarty. What she did not know would not hurt her. That is why he was there. It had been two weeks since the incident and he has yet to get better or get any worse for that matter. He couldn’t handle the manic days Sherlock had, which was then followed by the completely silent ones.
"A boy with a criminal mind. Haunted with knowledge like myself. But don't know what to do with it. So you decide to play games with the big boys out of your league. You throw little fits when you don't win, and you never do, do you? Consulting Criminal? Honestly? Pathetic really. Just like to play games to get your jollies," Sherlock spat simply. Jim laughed, "You have me figured out! Oh no! Sherlock Holmes has caught me!" He skips around in faux fear and nearly falls over laughing, tears tingeing the corners of his eyes. Sherlock remained silent and let Jim have his little "fit".
John knew a rat, alright, and her name was Molly Hooper.
“I was out if you haven’t noticed. You have not been much company,” he said offhandedly, setting down the newspaper he had picked up from Mrs. Hudson upon his arrival to the flat. The bottle of pills weighed down like lead in his pocket as he moved around the room. He made sure to avoid Sherlock’s eyes and to look stern. Normally, he would have been able to pick up John’s anxiety within seconds, but he was not normal anymore. His eyes remained glued to the computer screen and not on John anyway.
What he could gather was that it was dark and abandoned. This was becoming a theme in the past few years and couldn’t believe someone was still feeding into this cliche hostage technique. The next aspect to note was that it was oddly noisy, which was uncommon and whoever kidnapped him this time was inexperienced and not going for the scary criminal vibe he often encounters, this also meant that this was not Moriarty which was disappointing. He tried focusing his eyes on the petite figure that was being illuminated by a dim yellow light of old, buzzing bulbs. In the back of his mind, he knew who it was and he had for a while, it was just that he refused to believe and for the only time in his life, he questioned himself and his intuition. But of course, the answer was obvious, he had figured it out weeks ago before the medication had flowed through his veins, polluting his thoughts. Even though the smoke, which was nothing like the clarity that the heroine had given him, he was busy working out how and why.
“Fine, I’ll make it for you,” she spoke suddenly, pointing the gun away from him, swiveling so fast on her feet she almost fell. “Do one thing right in your miserable life and save John,” she spoke as Sherlock finally broke free of the rope holding him down.
"I require a bodyguard for John for the time being. Make sure he knows his head from his arse and knows how to keep his mouth shut," he said offhandedly before standing up and straightening his coat, picking up his scarf and securing it around his neck. Before Lestrade could even mutter a syllable, he walked out of Lestrade's office and into the throng of reporters outside. They yelled questions at him, much like a firing squad and he pushed passed him, keeping his head hidden from the cameras.
“Oh stop thinking Sherlock, you already know the answer. I can hear you thinking from here,” a sad, soft voice broke through his confused thoughts. Twin Molly’s came into a blurry focus not too far away from the chair that Sherlock was attached to, he could now feel how loosely he was tied and how inexperienced the knot was, but to break out was way beyond the strength he was capable with at the moment. So in the end, it didn’t matter either way.
“One more question Molly?” he asked, pocketing the bottle in his coat before looking back up at her sincerely. This had always been on his mind and he thought it was now or never, the opportunity was perfect.
“I was the one who confirmed the body was Moriarty, John. It’s a logical assumption and I am not a brainiac like he is,” she said like it was the most obvious thing in the world causing John felt like a fool.
“How did-”
"Or me." John finished, his expression hidden by the newspaper. Sherlock chose to simply continue playing and ignore John's words all together. It was when his phone's message notification went off that he felt he was off the hook.
Before he had much time to react, someone grabbed him from behind, their hands under his arms pulling him off of the dead body. Or so he hoped. The further they dragged him away, his eyes did not leave that body, expecting it to move, breathe, anything that could indicate that he could have lived from five shots to the skull he didn’t remember firing. It wasn’t until they nearly tripped over Molly’s lifeless body and shock brought Sherlock back to reality, falling to his knees again, causing the police to stumble. He tried to touch her. Her soft, worn face was now free of pain or her lifeless mousy hair. Now, this he could not believe, but just like Jim, there were no signs of life. They had to pry his skeleton-like hands from her corpse to attempt to get him into the ambulance with the help of a very tearful John. He could not find the words, he needed to get Molly, he needed to get to her so he could save her. He refused to accept that it was too late until there was a slight pinch of a needle and his world faded into darkness again.
Boredom and frustrations coursed through Sherlock's veins that morning as he paced their tiny flat as a client droned endlessly about their missing child. Something along the lines of this woman's son who vanished from their house one day for no reason and was nowhere to be found. What was odd was that his room was riddled with women's lingerie and heels yet he had no girlfriend or female friends. This frantic mother was fixed on the idea that her son was abducted by a woman and could only imagine what she did to him in his own room and then simply cleaned it all up after.
"You know nothing about me," He breathed into Sherlock's face seriously.
"Yes you are."
"Mind telling me how I ended up in your bed?" He asked, unable to keep back the question any longer. He was too hungover and his patience was exceedingly low.
"Hm, no."
With this new information, the Hospital was put on high alert for an escaped patient and John, with a few security guards, marched on the morgue. However, when they got through the double doors into the sanitized room, it was empty. Watson expected this but it still made his stomach drop. One of the security guards phoned Scotland Yard while the doctor wracked his brain for another place she might be with him. Since her house was already thoroughly searched, he began to panic, knowing Sherlock shouldn’t be away from medical attention that long.
“Common Molly, dear, tell him how you really feel. Tell him how we USED you. Show him the scars on your back from how we whipped you until you screamed. It’s all his fault Molly, this is because of him. How could he ever love someone as bland and disgusting as you,” Moriarty laughed, playing his mind games with his conviving, lying tongue to get her to bend to his will, even without the use of the majority of his body. One could hear the rattle of the gears inside the firearm as her hands shook, unable to shoot straight if she tried.
"I-I'll give you money! Anything."
“You took everything from me,” Moriarty began again, his voice low and menacing, “I have died time and time again for you Sherlock, couldn’t you stomach at least a smile, hm? I thought dead was the new sexy?” he demanded, his eyes dancing with a shine you would expect to see from a deviant child that just killed his first innocent animal. “Put on a happy face Sherlock, this is the final show!”
"Help me."
"Drugs," Sherlock finally changed and Moriarty's eyes refocused, shrugging off his thoughts and laughing. It should have been a simple conclusion and taken less time to figure out, but Moriarty figured the drugs slowed the mind. Something Sherlock was well used to. He laughed anyway, finding the situation very ironic, a user not being able to instantly figure out he'd been drugged.
"Anything," Sherlock said, his voice beautifully haunting.
"twenty-seven dead, thirteen injured," the inspector read off of the report given to him by Sally Donovan. He ran a hair through his greasy hair, pulling his hands away in disgust. He would have to eventually get home and take a shower and get a decent night's sleep for the first time since the accident. Maybe a decent meal from his wife while he was at it.
"Childish? Don't you find it… intriguing?" he drawled.
Snap.
“Molly, please listen! This isn’t you Molly, what he did to you, it doesn’t matter,” Sherlock tried to reason but was quickly cut off by a bullet grazing his cheek with a searing speed that caused blood to drop to the floor.
"Sherlock! No!" John spoke up, stepping out from behind Sherlock.
“Sherlock? Hello?” John interrupted his troubled thoughts. Sherlock spaced out often and John was used to being ignored. This was different since the re-emergence of the mass murdering criminal, John ceased to exist and these episodes happened at least three times a week. However, sometimes it got to the point where John had thought of calling Molly to make sure he wasn’t using again.
Within seconds, the floor began to shake and loud booms reached Sherlock's ears, so loud that all that was left was just ringing. He raced outside, jumping over the fallen door to see many buildings aflame. Smoke clouded the sky in a thick layer of ash and embers, te debris slowly floating in the wind around him. Screaming people ran from crumbling homes, pushing past him and was nearly knocked to the floor by the shoulders that slammed into him while they passed. Sherlock looked around in utter fear and confusion. What had he done and how had Moriarty done all of this so quickly. None of what was going on around him made any semblance of sense. The world around him began to blur and he tried to blink his eyes to clear the imperfections away but his vision continued to worsen. He felt woozy and felt his body steadily growing numb. The world tipped before his eyes as he fell to the floor and everything went black.
Sherlock didn't sleep that night, he had tried to track Moriarty by his texts but was coming up short. In anger, Sherlock threw his computer, watching it break in half and the letter keys scatter the floor. The clatter resounded throughout the apartment and left an eerie silence in its wake. He didn't worry too much about the damaged electronic, he had two others, one however was John's. John would of had his head if he touched his laptop. He left the broken laptop stay in pieces on the floor and turned back to the desk, Mrs. Hudson would throw a fit and clean it up or force him to do it anyways. There were more pressing thoughts on his mind at the present time than a mess on the floor. He was lucky that the crash didn't arouse John in his bed he shared with Sherlock. Only for the sole reason that there was not room for another bed, of course. John however, seemed very pleased with the situation.
