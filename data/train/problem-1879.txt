“You incorrigible prat,” John smirked as he grabbed Sherlock’s upper arms and hauled him upwards bringing their bodies flush allowing for some much needed contact until John grinned slyly and rolled them, pinning Sherlock beneath him.  “You do realise I’m going to make you pay for that, yes?”
“I don’t get it” Lestrade questioned annoyed, “if you had already known who had done it why did we make the trip up here?”
“Of course you can,” John chuckles lightly, “go back to sleep, it wasn’t my intention to wake you.” John murmured reaching out and brushing his fingertips across the silver strands.
He didn’t know why he’d foolishly thought that there could be something more between him and Sherlock.  Obviously there would always be something that Sherlock would keep from John and John had had his fair share of secrets.  Secrets had nearly destroyed him after all.”
He leaned forward and slid their lips together avoid bumping into Sherlock’s nose, and making him forget anything but the kiss. He licked those plush lips and wriggled his tongue inside and explored as he lined himself up expertly with Sherlock’s cock and in one go took him in completely.
“Come on, up you get.  I want to see it on.  It’s been killing me having to keep it a secret this long.”
Rosie giggled and Sherlock suggested stir fry and that he cook.  John wasn’t one to argue, he took Rosie from Sherlock and let Sherlock get to work on dinner.  John put Rosie in her highchair and got her cereal and bananas ready.  He put her bib on and started with the cereal.  One small spoonful to start.  She moved it around in her mouth and made a sound which John couldn’t tell if that meant she liked it or not, but she swallowed it and accepted the next bite.  She finished the bowl relatively fast (to be honest it wasn’t a big bowl) and John moved on to the bananas.  With these she immediately took a liking to, opening her mouth for more and humming as she ate them.  In no time they were finished, and John was wiping her up, and Sherlock was making their plates of stir fry up.
John knew it was hard for the detective to express his feelings with words so he kissed him again. Softly at first, his hands finding their way to Sherlock’s waist. John felt Sherlock’s hands wrap around him, one hand resting on the small of his back and the other on the back of his neck. John felt himself being pulled closer, and when the chair impeded that, Sherlock pulled him up so that John was now straddling him.
As much as John tried to ignore Sherlock, Sherlock seemed to be ever present, even more so now than before.  He was always texting or calling.  Yes, calling. Or showing up at his front door unannounced or already sitting in his chair when he arrived home from his shift at the clinic.  John had ignored the texts, declined the calls, slammed the door on his face or thrown him out on said occasions, but the sad truth was, he wanted to go back to Baker Street.  He wanted to go back home.  Only it wasn’t that simple.  He wasn’t sure that he could forgive Sherlock or trust him again.  Even though the man had finally pulled through and did what John had asked many times – to stop being dead – things were more complicated than they had ever been.  In those two years Sherlock had been gone, John had realised something.  One undeniable truth.  He loved Sherlock Holmes.
“Well dear, you look like you have some thinking to do, I’ll leave you to it.”  She stood to take here leave.
He made himself comfortable and Sherlock rolled the sleeves up on his white dress shirt after he removed his dressing gown.  Sherlock draped the extra towel over his waist and down part of his thighs,
“For us,” John said, reaching for his glass and holding it out to toast Sherlock.  Sherlock obliged and held his glass up and tinked the side of John’s glass and then took a sip.
John rubbed the back of his neck and looked at his shoes, then smiled as he looked up meeting Sherlock’s wide eyes.  “I did tell you that I was reserving this for special events and well, I couldn’t think of anything more important than this.”
John had heard enough. He led Sherlock over to his chair and made him sit, so he could not escape the conversation that needed to take place before this went any further. He needed to be sure. He knelt in front of Sherlock whose head was hanging to avoid eye contact at any cost.
“Seems I need to make it a point to find time to take better care of you when I’m on a case.”  Sherlock stated when they finally parted.
“It’s been such a long time for me.” Sherlock bowed his head and said almost too quietly for John to hear.
He spent time licking and swirling his tongue around the head of his cock and savouring the flavor of the precome pooling at the tip.
Twenty minutes later Sherlock was sitting on the couch with plates in front of him when John had returned to the main floor.
“John, focus on the head, short strokes,” Sherlock ordered.  John obeyed, letting his eyes slide shut again, listening to Sherlock’s voice.
John couldn’t lie, it was strange crawling into Sherlock’s bed and settling in for the night.  He wore his boxers and vest and Sherlock wore a pair of boxer briefs.  It was strange because John was positive that Sherlock slept naked, which means he was going to great lengths to accommodate John and to make him feel comfortable.  He crawled in the right side of the bed and slid down under the covers and duvet.  Sherlock joined him moments later and turned the light off after placing the baby monitor on the bedside stand closest to Sherlock.
Sherlock hadn’t even touched a cigarette or eaten much, basically he did nothing.  Not even an 8 could get him out of the house.  The phone rang and his heart jumped a little as he dared to hope when he picked up the phone and saw the screen.
“Oh John, I don’t think it took us that long to figure that out, it took us this long to act on it and you know, I don’t think I would want it any other way.”
“No, you’re not, you’re bisexual and the last time I checked you don’t owe anyone any explanations as far as that’s concerned.”
Now John was placing kisses along Sherlock’s long, pale neck, confessing his desires. ‘I want to be perfect for you.’ His fingers softly skimming down Sherlock’s sides, making him squirm and smile. Sherlock’s long fingers in turn running up John’s back, silently asking, no begging him for more – for everything.
“I’ve known for a while now John, I’ve just been waiting for you to make the first move because I didn’t want to push you or rush you into anything.  I want this to be forever, seeing as how I’ve loved you for quite some time.”
Getting back to the game - seeing who could snag the first kiss of the morning as they still slept in their own bedrooms, seeing who could surprise the other with a kiss, seeing who could sneak a kiss or get caught for that matter at a crime scene, seeing who could embarrass Mrs. Hudson (that apparently was going to take a lot of work) and see who could get the kiss in the quickest when Mycroft showed up causing him to turn and leave post haste.
The look of surprise on Sherlock’s face when John joined him told him he had guessed right.  He would remember that look always, the way Sherlock’s eyes went wide, how his mouth had fallen slightly agape in confusion, then realisation as he smiled as he stood completely at a loss for words.
John dropped back to the mattress, following all of Sherlock’s orders, drawing his knees up, planting his feet against the bed, and letting go.
Mycroft had scooped the wounded dog up in his arms and packed him into the back of the car and took him to the vet in town.  While his injuries weren’t all that dire, the blood work the vet had insisted running showed something unexpected and dire.  Redbeard was suffering from advance stages of canine cancer, and while he may not have been showing symptoms prior to this, the accident would only cause symptoms to manifest now at an alarming rate.  The vet had explained to Mycroft he had two options, take him home and let him die slowly or put him to sleep before it got too bad.  Mycroft opted for the kinder of the two and had Redbeard put to sleep.  He made the decision he knew I would be unable to.
“She’s part of you John and will always have a home at Baker Street.”  Sherlock managed to say as he was trying to memorize how John’s hand felt in his, so warm and real, better than he could have ever imagined.
“It was coincidence really, well maybe a subconscious choice when I ordered them a week ago, but as far as the case goes, it’s simple, the girl, being the only one had the key, removed it and took it with her. I texted Lestrade its most likely whereabouts and thought I’d try these out instead of shooting the wall.”
Meanwhile, John was downstairs shocked at the conversation he had just overheard and quickly settled in his chair again and pretended to be sleeping.  As he sat there with his eyes closed feigning sleep, he couldn’t believe it.  Sherlock wanted them to move in to 221b, he wasn’t put off by the direction in which John’s life had taken with a new baby and he seemed to actually enjoy spending time with Rosie, they were there enough, but living with a baby full time was completely different and he wasn’t sure if Sherlock realised what that entailed.
Seemed easy enough, he took them into the loo for a thorough washing and grabbed a few flannels just in case he made a mess.  He grabbed the lube and returned the bedroom and silently stripped, dropping his clothes to the floor and crawling onto the bed. He cupped the beads in his hands to warm them and placed the tube of lube under his thigh to warm it, body heat always did the trick and he was getting excited.
John sighed, “look this may be a ridiculous idea, but you know how everyone at the Yard thinks we’re an item, well we should give them a show, at least an auditory one, and if they come over to look, we could give them even more of a show, minimal touching, just to make it look real.”
“Sherlock, I think there’s something else we’re overlooking.  The space.  Rosie and I would be sort of cramped in my old room and I’m not sure how…”
“God Sherlock, that mouth,” John moaned, his fingers twisting hair in one hand and the bedsheet in the other, and Sherlock hummed in pleasure as he set up steady rhythm.  This time, John did lose momentary control and thrust upwards as Sherlock hummed, and Sherlock placed a hand on his hip to still him because now was not the time for his captain to come, his captain had made him promises.
"Good then, let's begin," Sherlock licked hips lips then moved over and spoke with heated breath in John's ear, "I'm going to make this so good for you John, you'll be screaming for all of Baker Street to hear, well, at least Mrs. Turner’s married ones." He finished with a smirk before licking up the shell of John's ear and then kissing a trail behind it and down his neck until he ran into his first obstacle, John's jumper.
“John, nothing will happen before the time is right.  If we end up in each other’s arms for comfort so be it, but nothing else will happen until you and I are both ready to take that step.  I give you my word.”
“I hate to be the early bird, but I need sleep after today and I have a shift at the clinic tomorrow.”
“Let’s be fair, that last one, I did to myself.  I was already in a world of hurt from the drugs I was using and while you did hit me a few times, we both know that wasn’t the only reason I ended up in that hospital.  I wanted to catch Smith in his sick demented game and I’m sorry I used you and your grief like that.  I know we can never pretend those things didn’t happen, but I think we both know how truly sorry we are for driving each other to those extremes.  Really, if you look at it now, we’ve been through the utter worst more than several times and survived together, we can get through anything together.  I’m not saying it’s going to be easy but if we start like we should have been all along, I think we can make it.  Just be open and honest with each other.  Also, if you think therapy would help us I would be open to that suggestion as long as it’s with Ella, we all know what happened with the last therapist you picked.”
John turned around and looked up into Sherlock’s clear blue eyes.  I haven’t even gotten rid of Mary’s stuff.  It’s still all in the drawers and closets and...” His voice trailed off.  Tears had started to fall.  “I just never got around to getting rid of her stuff.” he whispered.
“Fucking hell Sherlock…” and then John moaned as Sherlock turned and crooked his fingers and gently began to massage his prostate, Sherlock smirked and leaned in and licked the bead of precome that had formed.
And all the fear and inhibitions start to fade into the background because this is comfortable, it's right – natural. Sherlock becomes bolder with his movements and John’s hands fall to his thin waist and pull him closer until they feel like one. As their bodies merge, Sherlock’s breath hitches and their kiss breaks, the enormity of this closeness hitting Sherlock like a punch to the stomach, he pulls back a little.
Just when he thinks the moment couldn’t be any more perfect as he’s sliding his hands up Sherlock’s thighs, spreading them apart a bit more, Sherlock whispers something. One word.
Once she had left, Sherlock had risen from his chair, sped to his bedroom and changed into some more comfortable clothing, his pyjamas and light blue dressing gown.  John shook his head as he plopped down on the sofa and took up his thinking pose.  John strolled over to the couch and bent forward, leaving a kiss on his forehead and a ruffle to his curls.
John had been watching telly when Sherlock asked him to help him with the experiment he was working on because he couldn’t do everything himself.
Anderson and Lestrade were speechless, until Lestrade finally whispered, “Maybe we should give them some privacy.”
Of course when he told me, I was livid, I hadn’t even had the chance to say goodbye.  To this day I still hate him for it even though I know he was trying to save me from making a painful decision.  He of course had offered buy me another dog, but Redbeard was irreplaceable and I never wanted to go through any of that again, ever.
John rolled off Sherlock and Sherlock took it upon himself to arrange the pillows against the head board so John could sit up, he wanted to be close as possible.  He found the lube and squirted a generous amount on his hands, rubbing them together to warm the liquid up and then he wrapped one hand around the base of John’s cock and began to slowly stroke him as he used his other hand to play with his balls which prompted John to spread his legs.
“I think we both just needed time to get ourselves right, get things in perspective.  I couldn’t exactly move back into Baker Street right away, plus I needed time to deal with things.”
He leaned forward and kissed Sherlock on the lips and then murmured “I could really get used to this.”
It was like nothing either of them had ever experienced before as Sherlock pulled John into him, controlling things now, which John was thankful for because he was fairly certain he wouldn't be able to it if it were left to him.
John continued until his finger was all the way in and then slowly he pulled almost all the way out, not encountering too much resistance and then back in again. After a few more rounds, he added another finger.
John, I ultimately destroy everything I touch and you of all people should know that quite well.  Look at what I did when I thought I was protecting you from Moriarty.  We’ve never addressed it and we should have, but you came back and never demanded any answer or that we talk of it and I was afraid to ask even though I knew I should.  I was just so happy to have you back that I didn’t care why or what repercussions could come later from it.  I promised myself from that point on that I would be a better man and made a vow to myself to strive to be the man you always said I could be.  I tried.  I really did and things were wonderful, more than I could have ever hoped for or imagined they could be and then tonight, reality reared its ugly head reminding me it was all just a pipe dream, something that I could never have.  Happiness is a right reserved for other people, not for an obnoxious, arrogant, freak such as myself.
With that Sherlock rolled John onto his back and began to undo his jeans, he made quick work of removing the offending clothing and got right down to business, after pausing a moment to admire the sight before him. John stretched out before him, never in a million years did he think this would have been possible.
“Want me to do what?” It couldn’t mean what John hoped it meant. He was just deflecting now and trying to change the subject. Obviously this must be some kind of joke. Things like this did not happen where it concerned Sherlock.
“Sherlock,” she put his hand on his arm, “you’ve no reason to butter me up.  Of course, I’ll sit with Rosie so you and John can get things sorted more quickly.  Besides moving and packing is no place for a baby.  It will render one of you useless as you’d have to hold her the entire time.”
About half an hour later as Sherlock was examining a slide, he heard Rosie begin to stir.  He looked up and saw that John was still asleep and hurried quietly up the stairs to get her before she woke John, only he forgot to turn the monitor off.  He found her standing in her cot holding onto the side and her favourite bee blanket, softly babbling to herself.
“Mmm, just like that, That’s exactly how I want you and Sherlock crawled on top of his lap and John’s hands found their way to Sherlock’s waist and helped to slowly guide him onto his cock, carefully pushing gently through the ring of loosened muscles.  They both groaned.
You and I together had been something I had always dreamed of happening and it felt good.  Ever since Christmas, I felt things change, if I am honest, it was before that though I didn’t know that’s what was happening at the time.  It felt right and it felt natural and then you got personal and I was reminded by past events why this could never work and why you are so much better off without me.  I should have never returned or more importantly, I should have respected your first wishes of leaving you alone forever, than to put you in this position where I have once again hurt you.
Sherlock giggled and pushed his thigh against John’s erection, “I have news for you my doctor, I am already well aware of how much it does.”
Sherlock announced he’d have his usual and John optioned for the shrimp alfredo, he felt like a change tonight.”
“I think it’s a bit obvious John.  I love you.  We all make mistakes.  I could ask you how you could forgive me for Mary and Eurus.  It’s the same thing.  You love me and that’s all that matters.”
Sherlock hummed, “both,” he hooked his leg around John’s and flipped them, “you can get me ready like this and then we can switch again.”
Sherlock tried to keep his mouth from gaping and he moved to the bed and covered the bed with two towels and kept the last to put over John’s waist.  John had no qualms about lying down and let Sherlock give him a rub down, in fact he was surprised at Sherlock’s offer but who was he to kick a gift horse in the face.
Sherlock nodded, John tugged again only this time harder.  “I want words Sherlock.  Sentences.  I know you can do it.  That marvellous brain of yours can handle this, it can handle so much more than the little taste I am giving you now.”
At least John could give him a little bit of credit. Sherlock was only ranting and raving. John could tolerate this, well almost. At least things hadn’t devolved to where Sherlock was throwing ceramics at the wall, or worse yet, shooting it. The first and only time that occurred, John had the presence of mind to hide the gun, the clip, and the bullets all in separate places – and those places changed on a weekly basis.
He didn’t wait for Angelo to return with the dessert, instead he dropped a handful bills on the table that more than covered the bill and left a generous tip.  It wasn’t right that Angelo allowed them use of the table so long and turned away paying customers so John made it right.
“Wouldn’t dream of it Sherlock. I am capable of doing more than two things at a time, quite well I should add.” He continued staring at the screen trying to organize his thoughts. "Though maybe you should consider a hobby?"
“I’m impressed,” John grinned, “but we really need to talk.  You know at one point I did blame you for everything but then I realized it was just as much my fault.  I’m not mad at you, you were just doing what you thought would make me happy.”
“I’m sorry.  Please forgive me.  For you I will try.  I can’t promise you much.  I can’t promise you anything really, but I will try.” Sherlock whispered.
After they had said their farewells to everyone John had found Sherlock in the kitchen, humming while making their tea.  It was their own special blend and it had become a ritual for them both before they could turn in for the evening.  When John had returned to Baker Street, it hadn’t even been a full week when he woke to one of Sherlock’s horrific night terrors.  By the time John had made it down the steps and to Sherlock’s side, the man had already come out of it, but he was paler was usual and his pyjamas were stuck to his skin from the night sweats, but the worst, where the tears that streaked those magnificent cheekbones and even more heartbreaking was the way Sherlock had grabbed John and clung to him, sobbing that he was sorry for leaving him and causing him the pain he did.  At first John hadn’t understood, this had to be more than just guilt for leaving, and he soon realised that the answers were probably held in the file that he had burnt, but then as John put his arms around Sherlock and rubbed his back to soothe him, he quickly put it together.  Through the thin fabric, he could feel the raised and gnarled welts that spanned the length of Sherlock’s back.  This man had been extensively beaten and tortured and God only knew what else.  Sherlock froze as it became clear John had discovered the scars, but John never backed away.  John pulled him closer and hushed him, murmuring that he was there now and that everything was ok.  He never asked, it wasn’t important, all that mattered was that they were both where they belonged.  What John couldn’t wrap his head around though was why Sherlock was apologising to John for leaving when the man clearly suffered at great length to ensure John’s safety.  By the time he had hushed Sherlock enough for him to back to sleep though, he realised something, that the answer was staring him right in the face, it had always been staring him right in the face.  Sherlock Holmes loved him.  That was the only possible explanation.  And it didn’t frighten John or freak him out, no – it gave him hope for the first time in so long.  He just needed to approach it with care and thought and maybe just maybe someday they could move beyond what they were, but for now, this was a good start.
“Just in time.” he smiled as he reached over a placed a kissed on her head.  “Was your food good?”  She babbled and Sherlock took that as a yes.  “Good little bee.”  he rustled his fingers through the curls on her head and sat down to join John who had already started eating is stir fry.
“Well I don’t expect our daily routine to change much, and I will respect any boundaries you set regarding cases and such. I don’t expect dates or any such nonsense as you would label it. As far as it goes, anything that happens between us can stay behind closed doors if you wish. Did I miss anything?”
“What?  This tiny bit of silver?  No.  In fact,” John rolled Sherlock to his back and began to nip at his neck, softly at first while moving closer and pushing his erection against Sherlock’s thigh, he licked up the length of Sherlock’s neck and then bit at his lobe and growled.  “It’s sexy as fuck and all I want to do is show you how extremely turned on it makes me.”
John laid the paper back to the top of the pile.  He needn’t read anymore, everything he needed to know had been stated in that first message.
Sherlock placed the order and within half an hour they were seated at the kitchen table eating while Rosie played in her highchair.  Mrs. Hudson had gone home for the evening but not before telling them how delighted she was they were finally getting on with things.
He grinned sheepishly, folding his arms across his chest and barely whispered “I thought this would be easier.”
When he entered her room, she smiled and reached out for him, now babbling.  “Good afternoon little bee, how was your doctor’s appointment?”
Sherlock glanced at the clock, it was half eleven, an hour had already past, no matter, he could finish the other five no problem and be finished and cleaned up before John returned home.
Angelo continued, “It’s always nice to get out every now and then for some alone time, especially in the early stages, get Miss Rosie used to other folks so she’s not fussy when you have to leave for a bit when she’s older.”
With that, John stood and grabbed Sherlock’s hand and headed for the room. Once there, he pushed Sherlock onto the bed and crawled on top of him and began to ravish every part of exposed skin. When he made his way to the waistband of those ridiculously beautifully tailored trousers, he undid the belt and popped the button. He could already see Sherlock’s erection straining under the fabric. Well he was about to fix that. He pulled the zip. Sherlock lifted his hips a bit so John could remove his trousers, socks, and shoes. John’s eyes widened in amazement. Sherlock wasn’t wearing any pants, of course he wasn’t. He heard Sherlock try to stifle a laugh. “You know that really shouldn’t surprise me, in fact it makes things easier.”
Within a couple hours they were all packed and ready to go.  They had two vans, one that would be heading to Baker Street and the other heading to the consignment shop.
Some cases were tough to crack, some required trips into the mind palace. John never questioned Sherlock’s methods usually, that is until they interrupted their regular dynamic.  A blue jewel had been stolen from a private family collection and the entire thing had vexed Sherlock.  The young girl had called the jewel the Blue Carbuncle and it was just absurd as the history she had told about it. Sherlock had almost dismissed the case entirely until he had seen a picture of the jewel and learned it had been stolen from a locked room with only one key and the key had been out of the country when the theft had occurred.  It was barely a four, but the family went way back with the Holmes’ and both mummy and Mycroft insisted.  In fact, it wasn’t until he had seen the picture that he’d become more intrigued, because he remembered actually seeing the jewel in person when he was a teenager when his mother was trying to get him to court the young lady that now sat in front of him.  He hadn’t said much, just nodded and hummed here and there, but John had assured the young lady they would look into the case for her.
He didn’t bother being gentle, he knew exactly what Sherlock wanted.  He started out fast and hard and was pleased at the response of Sherlock’s moans and begs. He pulled his hips up and brushed across his prostate twice and Sherlock’s body was jerking, strings of come pulsing from his untouched cock.
John took a deep breath and walked down the hallway.  He didn’t bother to knock, he just opened the door because he was in no mood for excuses as to why he should just leave.
Sherlock had handed him the vial and took the two he was starting with and started pouring his vials into the beaker simultaneously and everything looked fine.
Little did he know, that’s exactly what was happening.  He had never heard the detective enter the flat nor make his way down the hall. Sherlock was tired and just wanted to crawl into bed next to John and rest so he was as quiet as he could be as he entered the flat since it was still early.  He expected John to be sleeping but was quite shocked (and pleased) to see the spectacle before him as he reached the threshold of their bedroom.
Sherlock could feel his orgasm coiling deep within and he was reduced to only being able to moaning John’s name over and over again.  When John felt the grip in his hair tighten again, he sucked Sherlock all the way down, and swallowed him and Sherlock thrust his hips up twice and then he was coming down John’s throat, screaming John’s name over and over.  John pulled off and worked him through each wave of his orgasm, lightly massaging his prostate until Sherlock became oversensitive.  John gently slid his fingers out of Sherlock and was up on his knees before Sherlock could blink.  He ran his hand over the slit of his cock as he was leaking copiously and used that as he began stroking himself, making a tight fist with his hand that he could fuck into.  It didn’t take long until he was coming over Sherlock’s stomach groaning
This time though Sherlock could see something different as he made his way towards John.  He could see a great deal of tension in John’s neck and shoulders, leading him to conclude that he must have had a near sleepless night and not so good day with the double shift of work he had put in to help out Sarah after one of the other doctors had called in with a family emergency.  This time he was reading the paper but kept sighing and shifting in his chair.  Sherlock silently rose form his chair at the table leaving his experiment behind and padding up quietly behind John.  This would take more than just a kiss.
Sherlock moaned loud and long and Donovan looked at Anderson and whispered “Jesus, no wonder they wanted far away from us.”
“Don’t worry John, just trying to get you more comfortable and my bedroom is closer and besides, I don’t think the steps would be good for your leg anyway. John didn’t really protest Sherlock had a valid point and honestly he didn’t think he could make it up the stairs.
He closed the gap between them, cupped John’s face and kissed him, a chaste kiss as it were. He leaned back and closed his eyes expecting to get slapped. After a few seconds of no movement or sound, he opened his eyes. John sat there just looking at him - lost. Well this could not be good. He blew it. Scrambling, to fix the situation, Sherlock straightened up and brushed the wrinkles out of the front of his shirt.
he thought, now’s a better time than ever, four months had been long enough, in fact way to long.  He wanted to move back the second everything was over but knew that wouldn’t look good after the cover story Mycroft had come up with.  The story was that they were in a fatal car accident and Mary or whatever her real name was, was locked up and awaiting death and then they found out the baby’s father was her handler so Mycroft could not let the baby go to him.  Mycroft knew several couples who were looking to adopt so he paced the child with the best family.  Mycroft also made sure that John got all of Mary’s assets to help him live, he deserved it after all because he couldn’t go back to work for a while and he needed money to live on.  Normally John would have objected but he did deserve it and only spent what was necessary.  He sold the townhouse and rented a small flat and kept the car and he didn’t feel guilty at all.
John put his fingers under Sherlock’s chin and lifted so their eyes met, “It has been for me too, we will just go slowly and let things happen naturally as they should. Once we start I’m sure we won’t have any problems.”
“Really John, no need to become hostile.” Sherlock smirked, resumed pacing and then looked at John and laughed.  "A hobby, REALLY?  Can i count you as my hobby, you do entertain me so."
The words almost didn't register because he had assumed he would be John’s first and John would be his, but now he thought that wasn’t the case and when John’s words finally reached his brain, his lips formed a perfect ‘O’ and John smiled warmly.
John chuckled as Sherlock laced his gloved hand into John’s, “Only the pair of us could take this long to figure out our attraction to each other.”
Sherlock dug in his pocket for the lube he had grabbed when he snuck in the room to undress himself only to return in the dressing gown. He inched down further on John’s cock setting up a teasing rhythm of a slight bob while sucking ever so slightly. This way John wouldn’t notice the bottle being clicked open and Sherlock applying a generous amount of lube to his fingers so he could warm it before teasing his doctor open.
“Yes John, faster.  Come on, show me what you’d do to me if I was on top of you, how you’d make me beg, plead for it.  God John I want it. Come for me.”
This was not the answer John thought he would get back so he decided to be open and honest as well.  “Sherlock, I have a confession to make, for a long time now, so have I.”
“That’s what I’m here to talk to you about.  John and I are going over to his flat to pack and get it ready for sale and we wondered if you could watch Rosie for us.  She won’t be much trouble and she just adores you.”
“Alright, I’m still upset at you, at me, at Mary.  I can’t get around some of the things that have happened or that I’ve done, and I can’t see how you can let things go so simply when they weren’t simple.”
“So, Doctor…” Sherlock paused then grinned, “Mmmm, excuse me, Captain Watson wants to see how filthy my pretty little mouth is, doesn’t he?”
‘Hey,’ John says quietly, pulling Sherlock’s face up with his fingers under his chin so their eyes meet. ‘Sherlock, you don’t have to hide from me, whatever you want, if you want to stop and just lie here together we can…’
Sherlock’s hands clutched at his forearms, pulling him back close.  “Don’t go.” Sherlock all but begged as he wrapped his long, lean legs around John’s waist, locking him there on top of him.  He took and guided John’s right hand back to his hair. “I want you to do whatever you like to me.  I don’t want you to be gentle.  I want you to pull my hair, make me beg, push me to the edge again and again until I
John wove his fingers back into Sherlock’s still slightly slicked hair, grabbing hard and pulling him up as he sat back on his knees.  “The mouth on you.  I wish everyone knew how you talk for me but I like that this is only for me.”  He grinned as he traced the fingertips of his left hand Sherlock’s lips, “but first I think I want you to show me what you can do with that wicked mouth of yours before I do anything to you.”
“Fuck yes, please.” Sherlock begged and John found it highly erotic to hear Sherlock cursed usually due to the fact that he refrained from it.
He rose from the sofa, made sure to look the door to the flat and disappeared down the hallway to their bedroom.  He rummaged in the back of the wardrobe, pulling the nondescript box he had hidden from John when it had shown up last week.  He hadn’t been sure how to approach the topic but he figured if he had firsthand experience with how it worked then maybe it wouldn’t be hard to introduce it into their next session.
Sherlock both smiled and crinkled his nose and tried not to let his displeasure show.  Special occasions meant date and Sherlock couldn’t bear the thought of that, not now.  The mention also made Sherlock realise that John hadn’t been on any dates since Sherlock’s return (and none while Sherlock had been ‘dead’ either according to Mycroft) and Sherlock had been perfectly happy with that.  In fact, it suited John much better.  He was happier than Sherlock had ever seen him before making it quite apparent that John Watson didn’t need a woman for that.  Sherlock was doing fine in that area all on his own.  The only thing John could possibly need a woman for was his sexual needs or desires and if John could just look past his own narrow mindedness when it came to the subject, he would realise Sherlock could fulfill that bit as well, thus entirely removing the need for a woman at all.
Downstairs John himself woke, to find the novel sliding off his chest onto his lap.  He stretched and looked around finding no sign of Sherlock which was odd until he heard the conversation through the baby monitor.
He helped John finish cleaning up after breakfast and looked at his watch. “Just about time.” he announced.  John removed Rosie from her highchair and held her while Mrs. Hudson entered the flat and got herself settled.  John handed her to Mrs. Hudson.  “She just ate at 7, so she probably won’t be hungry till between 11 and noon and then she’ll be ready for a nap and she should sleep a good two to three hours.”
He stood there, silently watching as John stroked himself, breathy gasps leaving him at regular intervals. This had happened once before and John seemed to enjoy it when Sherlock watched and then talked him through it.  It was time for a repeat performance.  He shrugged his coats off and let them drop to the floor silently, crossing the space between them quickly, joining John on the bed.
His phone buzzed and he ignored it.  He really shouldn’t have because it was John informing him he was on his way home, the clinic didn’t need him after all and maybe they could wrap this case up, and then enjoy the rest of their day however they saw fit.  John wasn’t surprised that his text went ignored so he just continued home clueless to what he would find once he arrived.
“I realise that but, it’s not been like that since I came back. Sure sometimes I have to remind you of certain things, but we’ve both changed and I want it this way first. I want to feel you inside me. I want you to have that first.”
Sherlock was finally coming down off his high, and turned to face John. “I’ve had people call me a lot of things, but never beautiful.”
John took him down deeper now, without gagging himself. Given time he was sure he could swallow Sherlock whole, he just needed a some more time to work up to it. It had been a while since he had last done this, in fact the last time he could recall was during the last days of him army deployment.
“And neither did you but you did and I love it.  So go on then.”  John said excitedly.  He was practically vibrating out of his skin.
“John…” he whined, ‘please, no teasing.  I had to endure that dreadful dinner party of Mycroft’s that you refused to accompany me to and I'm wound tighter than a spring because I had to behave knowing that you would be unhappy if my brother texted you at work informing you of any unbecoming behaviour.”
“Oh it’s perfectly safe, I just need help pouring some liquids together and it needs to be all at the same time, but I don’t have enough hands.”
“Well what if I’m ready now for more things, maybe not everything, but more.”  He couldn’t believe he actually worked up the nerve to say it, but he’d been wanting to kiss Sherlock now at night when the go to bed.  He just didn’t know how to ask for it.
He poured some liquid on his hands and warmed it in his fingers and began to earnestly knead his back muscles, staying away for the gunshot wound on his shoulder, he’d always wanted to expect it closer but now was not the time.  He worked slowly on his neck, on each vertebrae and then along each shoulder and down John's back being ever so gentle and reveling in the sighs and the little moans that escaped John’s mouth when he worked through a particularly rough patch of tension.
“John, I have a confession, I did that on purpose.  Nothing bad is going to happen I just wanted to move things along a little faster.”
‘We should have really toweled off first,’ Sherlock giggled, ‘we’re going to make everything wet, my hair alone will soak your pillow through.’
Then he slid all the way down onto John’s cock in one fell swoop while he pushed his first finger into John. John’s hands immediately found purchase in Sherlock’s curls and he tightened and tugged accidentally which made Sherlock moan and John swear in return as the vibrations ran through his groin.
Sherlock of course had welcomed him with open arms, delighted at John’s sudden change of heart.  He never once asked why and John never offered and they started anew, albeit with some changes.  Gone was the Belstaff and John wondered but never asked, maybe he would speak to Mycroft when the time was right.  Also missing was were the cases.  They’d had some here and there, but usually at the behest of Mycroft and never any from the public because they were still hounding him, even after all this time.  He’d become a bit of a recluse and it worried John, but now that he was back, John figured they could work on that.
Sherlock cried as he pulsed down John’s throat, John working him through his orgasm as his eyes slid shut and all he could see was bright light and stars.
Before John could even finish his thought, Sherlock’s face had gone completely blank, the mask back up.  The mask that had John hadn’t seen since he returned to Baker Street all those months ago.  The entire evening had faded, like it hadn’t even taken place.  Sherlock had withdrawn his hands from John’s, stood, put his coat on and left without a single word, leaving John confused, hurt and stunned.
Six, seven and eight took is breath away and required patience and measured amounts of deep breaths.  He had shifted and OH the sparks that flew through him, that was unexpected, but he still had two more.
John leaned back a moment to take stock and begin to divest Sherlock of some of his clothing. As much as he loved the purple shirt, it had to go. He wanted Sherlock naked, and the sooner, the better. He started unbuttoning the shirt. Sherlock grabbed John’s wrists. “Wait, are you sure this is what you want? This will change everything.”
“Shut up Sherlock!” John cut him off before he could finish that thought. What the hell was going on here? Sherlock
“And here I was thinking we could also have Mycroft hire us some movers to help pack up your place and move everything here.  It would be much easier than trying to do it by taxi or renting a van and making a dozen trips.  And whatever you don’t want, you can sell with the flat.”
Sherlock let his head drop to rest on John’s forehead. “This is so much better than I ever dreamed, you’re so big and you fill me up, I’ve never felt anything like this before.”
John’s hands moved from Sherlock’s waist to his cheeks, tilting his head back and invading his mouth. Exploring every corner of his mouth until he was left sucking on Sherlock's bottom lip and releasing it with a soft pop. He licked his way from Sherlock’s neck to his ear, stopping to whisper, “God Sherlock, you have no idea how much I want this. WANT YOU. Every bit of you.” John licked the shell of his ear and started trailing kisses down the detective’s neck. The detective moaned. John smiled against his skin. Obviously he was doing something right.
“You’re scared, I get it.  So am I, but I am more scared of you not being in my life than any danger I could ever face by your side.  And if I have to, I will spend every day showing you how much you mean to me and all the good we can have together, just please don’t throw this away because you think you’re better off alone, because you really aren’t and neither am I.”
“God Sherlock!” he chanted as Sherlock kept inching his way further down and when John hit the back of Sherlock’s soft palate and Sherlock almost swallowed him whole, John tugged on his hair just hard to pull Sherlock out of his focus on giving John the best blow job he’s ever had and Sherlock looked at him confused.
When Sherlock had returned home to Baker Street at the end of October 2015, almost two and a half years after jumping from the roof of St Bart’s, he expected to find John.  Instead what he found was an empty flat, basically the same as they had left it that day minus some of John’s personal belongings – his favourite coffee mug, his clothing and his laptop.  Everything else had remained as it had been that day in June.  At first it had puzzled Sherlock, why would John leave his home?  Perhaps Mycroft had been right all along.  Sherlock had gone too far this time by not trusting John or confiding in him his plans on dealing with Moriarty.
“Good, now all I have to do is find a way to convince your daddy to move back here.” By this time he had finished snapping the last button on her outfit and picked her up.
When they had stopped at a café to warm up and grab a quick bite to eat early the next morning, Lestrade told John he was glad to have him back at Baker Street.  “Quite frankly, I was beginning to worry about Sherlock, thought he’d gone back to drugs.  Couldn’t lure him out with any cases.”
A shaky breath escaped his lips at the first contact of cool hands on his heated skin.  A sigh of relief as he wrapped his hand around the base of his cock and started with several long pulls.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide, concerned, he didn’t want John thinking he didn’t want this, this was everything he wanted, he was just overwhelmed.
“Ok, John add yours slowly and that is where everything went wrong, it bubbled over and then exploded covering them both in goo.”
I walked the entirety of the kennel, there were so many different breeds, in the end, there was one that caught my eye in the very last cage I came upon.  She was an older dog; the most beautiful dog I had ever seen.  She was a beautiful Irish Setter and this was to be her last litter.  It only had three pups to it and of those three, two had been sold.  I was mesmerised by the one that was left, he was just a little thing clearly left behind and neglected as the other two were thriving but I identified with him and told Mummy this was the one I wanted.  Mummy’s friend had tried to talk me out of it and she looked at him disapprovingly, ‘If this is the puppy my son wants, then this is the one he shall have,’ she told him.  ‘Sherlock knows exactly what this pup needs.  Love.  Love that he certainly isn’t getting here.’  The man agreed with her and gave us everything we would need and wished us well.
John pulled himself from his thoughts and looked up at Angelo.  “Yea… fine,” he lied.  “Emergency.  Could you pack this up please and bring me the bill?”
Sherlock had set up an experiment that was harmless, no chance of being hurt but just enough to make John believe that it would be safer to take extra precaution.
John nodded in agreement.   Suddenly there was a knot in his gut.  This was really happening.  There was no turning back after this, but this is what he wanted, what he had dreamed of, but his dreams never came true.  Something was surely bound to happen to ruin all this, make it all come crashing down.
Lestrade looked at Sherlock mouth a gape, “but this was a beer barrel rolling contest for God’s sake.”
Sherlock could barely talk as John’s fingers ran down the entire length of the underside his cock until he reached his balls and he began to roll and massage each one.
John bid Sherlock farewell for the evening even though it was barely half six.  Upon his arrival at his own flat however, he felt empty again.  He started packing boxes and knew he would be home again tomorrow, but that didn’t fill the void in his being.  He set the books on the desk next to the box and retreated into his room.  He reached under his bed for his duffle and began to pack most of his clothes and his bag of toiletries.  He wasn’t going to sleep here tonight.
John’s hands found their way to Sherlock’s arse on their own volition and pulled him closer.  How could he turn down the man above him?  He ran his fingers up Sherlock’s back and wove his fingers into those dark curls and tugged him up for a kiss causing Sherlock to groan.  Their kiss was searing and their tongues battled for dominance until they had to break for air and John panted, “do you want to be on the bottom or do you want to ride me so I can watch your gorgeous body take control?”
Sherlock grinned as he nipped at John’s fingertips and let his legs fall away from his waist.  He backed up and got on his own knees now and faced John, skimming his fingertips from his waist to the slight layer of pudge that covered powerful abdominal muscles.  Sherlock traced circles around his nipples and pinched them slightly before moving his hands upwards and cupping John’s face and pulling him in for a slow luxurious kiss where their lips slid together perfectly, their tongues mingling together, drawing out the softest of moans from John.  Sherlock pulled back and John followed, eyes half lidded, and Sherlock placed a hand on John’s chest and replied, “I believe you wanted me to show you what I can do with my mouth?”  He teased devilishly tilting his head a bit to the side with a wicked grin.
For posterity’s sake though, if I wasn’t already aware of this,” Sherlock swallowed thickly, “how… how would you show me John?”
“That is a solid deduction yes, I give you that, but do you know what it makes me want to do to you though?” John murmured into his ear, voice pitched dangerously low as he began to roll his hips against Sherlock’s body searching out for more friction.  “It makes me want to own you Sherlock, every bit of you.”
“Hello,” he said reaching for her hand and shaking it.  “I’m Sherlock Holmes and this is John Watson.”
“I know.  I’m sorry, it’s just tough to decide where to begin.  First and foremost, I owe you an apology and an explanation and I’m not sure that makes up for all the wrong that me choosing Mary has done to us.  I mean, I know it’s not only that, but the rest of it all had simple explanations in comparison.  I understand why you couldn’t tell me about the fall but if you had, we wouldn’t be here at this point.”
Sherlock said nothing and when the answer didn’t come that John was waiting for, he threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s slicked hair and tugged, “answer me.”
It seemed like all the air in the tent disappeared, making Sherlock suck in a breath, unable to believe the words John Watson had just said into his ear as his fingers still danced on his stomach.
Sherlock reached over and opened his drawer and rustled around until he found the bottle of lube and a condom and John chuckled and took the condom and threw it back in the drawer.
Sherlock handed him the necessities and they switched positions on the bed. Sherlock laid on his back and spread his legs for John. John knelt between those long legs and reached for a pillow to place under his hips.
“Rosie will be taking John’s old room and John will be moving into my room.” Sherlock exclaimed.  It’s the perfect size.”
He of course had it solved before John had even left the flat for work but he had more important things to think about. His mind had travelled back to a conversation he and John had had a few weeks back, about spicing up their sex life with toys.  Sherlock of course had done extensive research on all the different choices there were and decided on a set of anal beads that as fate would have it, were the same colour of the missing jewel.  It also happened that he had ordered a set of said beads and the recommended lube that went with them and since he had several hours to entertain himself, he thought he may as well give the new toy a try.  He was rather curious to see how it worked.
“And I’ll clean up breakfast, which was excellent by the way.  We need you to do more of the cooking around here.”
Sherlock’s fingers scratched his way down the upper half of John’s back as he begged for more and John licked back up and took him in his mouth, this time sliding half way down his length and rubbing his fingers over his perineum before sliding them back to Sherlock’s furled hole and circling gently at first and working his way up to prepare Sherlock for when he pressed forward with one finger.
John reached across the table and took Sherlock’s hand.  “Sherlock, Baker Street is and always will be home for me.  I just didn’t know if a baby figured into the equation.”
“That’s a good idea, then why don’t you go have your shower a while and then I’ll take a quick one.”
John looked at him and chuckled, “well you do look like you’re in dire need of release, I won’t lie, your cock is straining and you are stretched so wide, I think I could pop those from your arse and fuck you something proper, though I don’t know if you really deserve that.  I mean why would you do this without me?”
Sherlock blinked his eyes several times, caught off guard by John’s words and for a moment he wasn’t sure he’d heard them correctly.  He was still trying to reconcile the fact that John was wearing the jumper that he had deemed for special occasions only.
“Indeed not.” He put his hand behind John’s neck and pulled him forward and whispered in his ear with that velvet voice, “I do believe it is time to take proper care of my doctor.”
Sherlock put the spatula down and turned around and hugged John back, “you were supposed to stay in bed so I could serve you breakfast in bed.”
“Christ Sherlock, you will be the death of me,” John panted and Sherlock sat back and increased the pressure on his finger just enough to dip the tip in, the lube helping his fingertip slip right past the tight ring of muscles.
John smiled.  Good, I may still surprise him after all he thought to himself.  He rejoined Sherlock on the sofa and waited.
Sherlock snarked back, “well when you’ve been in the background all your life, sometimes all you want is a chance to shine in the light for once, even if it is short lived.”
They ate breakfast in relative quiet except for Rosie’s babbling.  Sherlock looked up at John, “You know,” he began, “I was thinking we could move some of yours and Rosie’s things in here today.  She’s wearing her last clean outfit.”
"Now if I leave go of your hands, do you promise to be good and leave them here until I tell you that you can move them?”
She had texted him later that afternoon and told him he could take the rest of the week off to get things sorted, but ultimately he decided he didn’t need it.  He had surprised everyone by showing up early the next morning for his shift with a variety of pastries and going on like nothing had happened the previous day.
He continued on, talking to her like they were having a conversation, “Do you like it here Rosie?  What would you think about it becoming your home?”  Rosie gurgled and clapped her hands together.
John could see the variations running through Sherlock’s mind and he’s known Sherlock’s wanted this for quite a while and to be honest, so did he. It was just a matter of getting him to agree.
How about I help you finish this and then we can do this some more, all of the sudden, I’m not in the mood for tea.  I want to explore those plush lips some more.”
..” Sherlock rasps as he sits up and claims John’s mouth, oh just like that you know that’s just how I like it and John readjusted his angle and grip on the back of the couch and rode him in more earnest now.
Sherlock huffed and turned his back to the coffee table now.  Out of sight but not out of mind.  What he read was stuck in his mind and this he could not delete.  No matter how hard he tried, the words were seared in his brain and he could not stop himself from dissecting their meaning.  He tried to think of other things, but he couldn’t, every thought came back to John.  Back to what he had written so long ago and Sherlock could not stop himself from thinking that from these words lie the answer he didn’t want to accept.  That John could not forgive him, that he had crossed one too many lines, told one too many lies and that John would never again be part of his life.  That all Sherlock would have now were memories, memories that he could never escape.
“God yes,” John moaned and Sherlock leaned in and began to push the tip of his cock against John’s loosened hole.
John crossed the bedroom and pulled his jumper off and unbuckled his belt but left his flies intact for now.  “Sounds like a win/win situation for me.”
Sherlock nodded wordlessly and John undid his flies and kicked his jeans off.  He settled between Sherlock’s legs and mouthed at his erection as he began to pull the beads one by one from his body.  “Christ Sherlock, look at you, all ready for me.”  He marveled as he crawled up his body and grabbed the tube of lube and slicked his own erection.
