"Okay. I'll go get Dean, and we'll go see him."
“I’m already open with you. What do y-“
He simply didn’t care about anything, but his lips moving against the most dangerous person everyone knew about.
“Does
“Stay.” Castiel whispered against Dean’s lips.
Jessica let out a sob and covered her mouth as her shoulders shook. Castiel looked down at his feet and blinked couple of times. He tried to keep him composed but he couldn’t. There were hurried footsteps from down the hall and Castiel looked up to see a lady with black hair and a bit tanned skin, come running down the hall. She seemed harried, distressed. Her round eyes and nose, somehow, resembled the person that Castiel knew she belonged to. He clenched his jaw and waited for the weeping mother to learn the truth about what happened to her daughter.
“At the very least, seven thousand a month,” Dean said, and it was an indicator that he came to the right place when Gabriel didn't even bat and eye at the limit. “And additional three, if he wants to go to public places with me.”
Castiel read and re-read the addresses and tried to calm his erratically beating heart. In two and a half months, Alastair was going to bomb the cities. According to Lucifer, these were the locations for the said bombings. He trusted his brother with this information, because Lucifer never lied to him. Castiel had threatened him more than once what would happen if he were to betray Castiel. He went over the list again.
“I could make you come like this, couldn’t I?” Castiel said, the hand that was still in Dean’s hair, started to pet him. “I wouldn’t touch you. I wouldn’t let you touch yourself. Completely hands free.”
With a jolt Castiel woke up. His eyes snapped open and he blinked couple of times, his vision blurry. It took him a moment to realize that he had started silently crying. It was raining out and the sound of it was soothing to his nerves, but at the same time… At the same time Castiel was gasping for breath. His eyes squeezed shut, and his lips pursed, as a sob wrecked his body and he placed a hand over his eyes, trying to rein his feelings in.
“Get. Charlie,” Castiel gritted out through clenched teeth. He ended the call and started to re-dress. Lora and Anna were out for grocery shopping, so he texted them to let them know to be on high alert. He walked to the front door, opened it and found some of his men were there already. They smiled at him for a greeting, but then they froze when they saw his face. “Stay sharp,” he ordered. They nodded and shifted around. At once, some of them got their phones out, and some of them checked their guns. Satisfied by their actions, Castiel snapped the door shut and walked back to the kitchen to check on Dean.
“Dean!” He hugged her tight. She loved his sister-in-law so much. He was amazed how a woman like her could end up with someone like sloppy-Sammy, but here they were.
Dean nodded, without any hesitation. Castiel nodded as well, even though Dean wasn’t looking at him.
Thank you all so much for your comments. They keep me wanting to write more and more every day. Keep it up!
“Miss me already?” Mr. Novak teased him and Dean closed his eyes, biting down on his lower lip.
He looked around the bed and noticed that it was made. Thinking back to last night again, he remembered that Castiel didn’t sleep with him. Not in the bed with him, or with him. Dean didn’t know where Castiel ended up sleeping, and that was not a thought he wanted to have early in the morning anyway. Shaking his head, Dean stood up from the bed, feeling heavy and wanting to get something in his body to be able to face the shitty day he was going to have.
This one, particularly, looked like he wanted to be anywhere but here.
Mr. Novak nodded and said, “Precisely. They know how I am like when I’m with my family. They know what I’m like when they mess with any of my family members…” Mr. Novak licked his lips, took a deep breath and continued, “I haven’t done much… About Samandriel’s death, I mean. I haven’t confronted any of them, personally. I have, of course, sent them a message, but… there’s something big that is going to happen in the near future. And I wouldn’t want for you to be a part of that.”
“She’ll know.”
Dean’s eyes finally rested on the mess on the desk. It seemed like it was a map of some house. He frowned as he tried to make out the words around them, but he came up blank. The books were all in the similar language and it took Dean a second to realize that it was Italian.
Castiel agreed and they walked silently to the small garden house. The path they took there was as beautiful as the rest of this place. The ground was covered by flat rocks, neatly cut green grass was visible in between the cracks. They were surrounded by cherry blossoms and Castiel could hear the sound of a small, fake stream as they approached the designated spot for them to sit. There was a nice wind in the air, which allowed Castiel to take off his suit jacket and stay in his button down. They sat opposite each other and they were soon offered drinks. Castiel took a glass of whiskey, where Kevin got himself a warm tea.
Soon he added another finger. Dean let out a choked off sound. He started to move his hips up, chasing Castiel’s fingers and tongue. Castiel chuckled at Dean’s efforts and started to move faster. Dean was letting out moans by now, and when Castiel inserted his third finger, Dean all, but cried out at the feeling.
Dean blinked at him and hesitated slightly, before giving his keys to him. “Don't scratch her.”
“Don't move. I think if you do any more damage to your shoulder, we are all going to get kicked out of here.”
Castiel heard the last part of their conversation as he stopped by them. “How is he doing, Doc?”
Tomorrow, he was going to be seeing Dean. Castiel had no clue why Dean wanted to see him since he was loyal to that woman. But maybe he wasn’t as loyal as Castiel had thought him to be? Either way, Dean was risking his whole life by wanting to see Castiel like this. And Castiel was selfish enough to humor him like that.
He hadn't even called to see if she was doing okay. Was he allowed to, though? He didn't know how much privilege he had now, but he still would like to be able to call her whenever he wanted. Natalie was basically a godsend to him. Dean didn't know what he was going to do if he didn't have that small miracle in his life. The choices he made for her, right now, weren't appropriate, and he sure as hell was going to make sure that she'd never find out about it, but... He knew that if he didn't have her in his life, he wasn't sure where he'd be right now. Dean had a feeling that Lisa would've still wanted a divorce, either way. No one in their right mind would want to still be connected with a former, professional sub.
,” Dean continued. And then his hands were moving. His hands slowly made their way down Castiel’s arms and they seemed to shake, before Dean looped his fingers underneath the hem of Castiel’s t-shirt and his hands were underneath the shirt.
Dean had agreed. Obviously he had, or he wouldn't have been sitting in here, with the papers in his hand. He had to take this with him to the mansion. Dean was still having a hard time wrapping his head around the fact that Mr. Novak owned a mansion. But then, considering that he was the boss of the Russian mob.
Castiel's lips twitched into an almost smirk but when he turned around his face was passive. He handed one of the glasses back to Dean and indicated him to sit. When they were comfortable, sitting opposite each other, Castiel assessed him with sharp eyes and waited for Dean to relax a bit. Dean, on his part, was taking way too many sips from his glass.
They both sighed as their clothed dicks brushed up against one another and Dean wanted to hurry up. Mr. Novak gave him a hard kiss as his hands started to work on Dean’s buttons. When there was enough skin showing, Mr. Novak licked his way down to his chest. Dean arched his back, just as Mr. Novak nipped at his nipple. Dean could feel Mr. Novak’s hands working on his shirt, and he was just about to take it off when there was a knock on the door. Mr. Novak bit down on Dean’s chest, and growled out a “stay” as he pulled back. Dean didn’t move a muscle, as Mr. Novak left for the door. He didn’t look at the door, nor did he pay attention as to what was being said.
“Hi!”
“That was me!” Jo grinned.
“Wanted to kiss you at midnight,” Dean admitted, his eyes closed as Cas continued kissing his neck, nibbling at his collarbone.
"He has a life outside you, Gabriel," Jo said, sticking her tongue out her friend.
"Been here once before, you?"
“You can stay with me. Do you need me to come get you? I can pick you up,” Dean unsuccessfully tried to hide his excitement.
Benny winced as he started untying his boot, “I think it’s broken.”
Castiel grinned at his friend, the smile faltering when Dean removed his arm from around his shoulders. “If one does, they will go out of business in a month’s time, I guarantee you.”
"Broke down? How?"
“Relax, Cas, she’s probably into you.”
“That, it looks like a scratch. That wasn’t there when we got here, was it?” Dean jogged over to get a better look, dropping to his knees when he reached the gorgeous classic car.
Gabe sighed, hoping that his brother was right. Unfortunately, he wasn't.
“Okay, we are finding a new pretzel stand,” Dean said as he threw his napkin in the trash and caught up to his friend, who was nearly out the door of the mall. Dean threw his arm around Castiel’s shoulder playfully as the two exited the automatic doors. Castiel felt his cheeks burning pink at the contact. He had been physical with other people before, like when Meg Masters tried to give him a blow job at one of Ash’s parties, but he was too drunk to get it up, and the time when the only other openly gay student Balthazar kissed him behind the bleachers during gym class and he forgot to breathe for so long he began to feel a headache come on. But none of these touches compared to how being physical with Dean felt. Dean could pat Cas on the shoulder and he would blush, when their hands would brush when they reached for the same thing Cas would forget how to speak for a solid thirty seconds, the first time they shared a bed together at a sleepover Castiel had his first erection, even this simple gesture made his legs feel weak and he had to refrain from melting into Dean’s warm embrace. Dean never seemed to notice Castiel’s intense reaction to physical contact, which Cas silently thanked God for.
"It was great, we had a good time," Dean nudged Cas with his elbow as they all walked into the Italian restaurant.
“Hello?” Dean called out, expecting one of his friends to jump out of the bushes to scare them. When no one appeared, Dean said, “Cas, let’s get to the house,” hitting him in the arm gently to boost him in the direction of the main house. With the footprints not going any further, Dean figured whoever was out here got spooked by an animal and ran back. The two hurried along, speed walking towards the house that had now come into view.
"They throw really fun parties, you should go to one. If you want I can get you in, I know people," she winked.
“Where’s Benny?”
“Uh, nothing. Margarita time!” He shouted before disappearing.
"What look?"
Jo rolled her eyes, "We've been hanging out, it's nice to hang out with someone who doesn't spend most of their time in burping contests with their roommate."
"Have fun," Dean said with a small smile.
A few groans sounded after Castiel heard an unfamiliar voice suggest a game.
“Jesus, Sammy, no I didn’t leave him behind on purpose.”
“Anna’s gone!”
“I wouldn’t know, but it certainly cures the munchies,” Castiel’s nose wrinkled slightly, smelling a hint of bacon as the grill warmed.
. Castiel was also silent, he was going over what had happened in his head, trying to figure out why that word, of all words to vandalize the car with. He worried it was aimed at him, not Dean, and that John Winchester’s most prized possession was just caught in the crossfire of the bullying Castiel regularly experienced. Castiel had known Dean for nearly their entire lives, and Dean had never done anything that made him think he was gay. Dean was a total ladies man, nearly every girl in school was throwing themselves at him despite him not fitting in with the popular crowd. There was no way this hateful act was geared towards Dean, there was just no way.
Garth said, “Never have I ever gotten tattoo.” Ash put down another finger.
After nearly three more hours on the beach the girls were getting ready to head back to their hotel to meet their other friends. While the girls were discussing potential plans for the evening, Michael suggested they throw a party at the condo, which was met with agreement from his brothers and Dean. The girls agreed to come to the party, and that they would bring their friends. So after they packed up at the beach, the guys split up to prepare for a last minute party. Gabriel and Michael, being over 21 went to the liquor store while Dean and Castiel hurried to the closest grocery store to buy snacks, limes and frozen pizzas. When Dean and Cas got back to the condo Gabriel was on the phone and Michael was busy figuring out the speakers on the deck.
"C'mon, Cas, let's go find Benny," Dean said, sipping his drink.
“I’m an angel.”
Sam shook his head sadly and sat down next to the redhead. Ruby was further behind him, shutting the door loudly behind her. "Hey did you turn the lift off?"
“Charlie knows, she’s pro’ly told Jo by now,” Castiel waved a hand in the air carelessly.
Dean tossed his backpack onto the floor of his room, startling Gabe out of his geology homework. He flipped onto his bed and sighed loudly, running his hands over his face- Dean had just spent the last 3 hours going over the outline on his midterm literature paper and when he shut his eyes he saw lined paper in the darkness.
"What were you thinking? He made Luke an addict, he fucking killed his little sister!" Gabriel said.
Dean lead him through the parking lot until they made it back to Mary’s car, they slipped into the car and locked the doors as Dean slipped the crowbar into his backpack and under the backseat. Dean and Castiel were both panting from the adrenaline, staring into each other’s eyes, able to feel the energy and heat radiating off the other. They continued to stare at each other for a moment, hearing their heavy breathing, the car alarm and crowd cheering in the distance.
“Yup, maybe I'll enroll in UKan next year, I dunno.”
“How ‘bout I make us a real breakfast?” Dean said after he noticed the bowl of heart-healthy cereal.
“Go on,” she urged, making a rolling motion with her hand.
While Gabriel played, Dean, Jo, and Castiel hung back and watched. Jo was chatting with a girl from her old dorm and Dean and Castiel stood inches apart, shouting at each other over the music. Dean locked eyes with Gabriel when he looked up and noticed Gabe’s stare. He brushed it off, assuming he was closely watching his younger brother since this was his first college party. Castiel laughed at something Dean said. He laughed his big, hearty laugh, where he threw his head back and grinned up at Dean, his blue eyes shining with his smile. Dean felt himself enamored by Castiel’s big, bright blue eyes and couldn’t stop staring into them as the younger man spoke. He continued to feel the hair raise on the back of his neck, knowing he was being watched when it wasn’t Gabe’s turn.
Dean laughed, “Yeah pretty much. Why are you interested?”
“Where was I? Oh yeah, let’s go over basic rules. You guys aren’t freshman, you’ve done this before, you know what to do and what to not do. Don’t be stupid. No alcohol, no drugs, smoke outside, don’t be an ass to your roommate. I’m here to help you, I’m not your enemy. If you have a problem you can come to me. Any questions?” There other residents were quiet before Chuck announced they were supposed to do ‘team building’ exercises, however he hates them and they will not be doing them. When the meeting ended and people started filing away Chuck shouted, “Mr. Novak, Mr. Winchester, a word?” A few students made “Oh, you’re in trouble,” comments to the two and some chuckled.
“What’s his car look like?” Castiel asked.
“He’s not that bad, I swear. He’s actually become quite the stoner,” Gabe sounded like a proud parent.
"How did you not? It was so bumpy I got sea sick."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smirked, “Is that so?” He asked, leaning in closer to Castiel, who nodded. “Then I’d like to schedule an appointment.” He leaned in closer, his mouth inches away from Castiel’s ear, breathing hot on his neck. Castiel produced a small groan and felt his pants tighten slightly at the near contact; he hadn’t been intimate with anyone- not even himself- after Meg left him.
“What else is new?” He replied, disinterested, flipping a page.
“You guys hungry?” Ash asked, running his stomach.
“I guess,” Dean shrugged.
“You guys want a beer?” The shorter girl asked Dean and Cas.
“Well, yeah,” he dug the toe of his shoe into the ground.
This unfortunately did not give Castiel any answers, but he said he would try to talk to him again as they approached the fitness center. Gabriel stepped off the sidewalk, wanting to get away from his brother pining for information about Dean again, but also in the direction of an emergency exit that was his shortcut to his health class.
"That's nice," Castiel said, nodding, uninterested in what she was saying. He was trying to turn his attention back to Andy, who was telling a story that had Adam in stitches.
“Cas?” Dean asked, raising an eyebrow. He set the controller down and hopped off the couch.
He thought. Okay, maybe it wasn’t a completely honest answer.
"Because I'm an idiot," Dean took a sip from the bottle again. “I don’t want to fuck things up. I fuck everything up, Cas.”
As it turned out, Castiel’s dessert plan was not dessert at all, but Dean bent over his desk with Castiel between his legs, eagerly lapping at his ass, and a hand wrapped around Dean’s cock.
“They were taking name tags off people's doors. I don't understand why, but they thought it was hilarious.”
“Nice to meet you,” Dean said with a smile of his own. Anna returned his smile with a big one. Her cheeks dimpled as she did so. Her face was round, and it had a motherly look to it.
Dean whistled. “These must've cost him.”
Dean blushed a bit, a warmth that had nothing to do with the lovely weather blooming over his chest, and settling down in a contented hum on his heart. He ignored it as best as he could, as he leaned a bit forward and said to Mr. Novak, “I have no idea who we’re sitting with.”
wake up past midnight and move his ass to bed. Just like last year, and the year before that. He chewed his food and looked at the messages on his screen.
Before Dean could respond, he was being flipped over to his front so fast, he had a head rush from it. Anything after that was a blur of passion and warmth that made Dean tingle in a pleasurable way.
. I mean it,” Castiel told Balthazar, with a firm tone of voice. It took a few seconds, but Balthazar lowered his gun, but didn’t relax his stance.
Dean was still standing there, staring down at his hands. He seemed to be in shock. Castiel clenched his teeth, not knowing what his reaction would be if he were to approach. “Dean,” he called out his name.
Alastair let out a low noise in his throat as he sunk all the way in Dean, and he shuddered as if this was the most beautiful thing in the world. Knowing Alastair, it probably was. His face was still close to Dean’s neck and Dean could feel the hot breath on his skin. It made him want to go and have a long shower. He pulled back and looked into Dean’s eyes. His cold grey eyes stared down into Dean’s, and moments later, he snapped his hips forward. Dean screwed his eyes shut and he cried out in pain.
After some time, a lot of people made their way to say hello to him and to not-so-subtly ask him who his new love interest was. Every time he got asked this, he declined their assumptions, and explained that she was a close and dear friend of his. Some of them outright laughed and made crass comments, some of them accepted this and moved on. The ones who made the comments received a cold smile in return. After a while, they stopped their chortling and apologized for their behavior.
“Of course, I did say I’ll let you go,” Castiel said. “But I didn’t say how.”
Castiel held up his hand to silence Lora; she gritted her teeth together, but stayed silent.
Samandriel nodded, but he asked for some water, before he started talking again. Castiel listened to him closely; no odd sightings, no out of place activities. The shops were clean and very thankful for keeping an eye out on the street for violence and mishaps. Until this happened, of course. Castiel asked Samandriel if he was sure that there wasn’t anything out of place, but Samandriel shook his head.
“Wait a minute. Just hang on a moment,” Balthazar said straightening up. Castiel raised his eyebrows at Balthazar, his lips twitching. Castiel turned to the door, hand resting on the doorknob. “Are you saying… Am I getting this right?”
“I killed the person who introduced me…” Castiel leaned up on his elbow, while his other arm pushed down on Dean’s solar plexus, not too hard, but enough to make a threat. Castiel looked up at Dean’s face, his eyes boring into his eyes. “To you.”
Alastair chuckled, but didn’t say anything to him. He merely continued. “How many men have you lost these past few weeks? Forgive me, but I have lost count.”
Why would anyone want to love him?
“Sam, hello,” Castiel said. “It’s me.”
,” Castiel said, he squeezed Gabriel's shoulder as he passed him and walked to the room. He noted how uncharacteristically silent Gabriel was. He had to check in on that later. Right now, Samandriel was his priority.
“I’m Castiel,” the man, Castiel, said, accepting the hand. “Eileen’s brother.”
Now, enjoy~
“I hope you realize that you have interrupted a very pleasant dinner,” Castiel said as Alice presented him with his suit jacket. He grabbed it with a nod and she shuffled away. Castiel shrugged it on and walked out of the mansion, Crowley right behind him.
Even if the afternoon sky was casting shadows over the trees, and the soft light of it was playing over Mr. Novak’s features making him look angelic, and his intense blue eyes were even bluer in this light… he was not going to be dragged into the forest to be introduced to the wolves.
They had a shed in the garden that had a small room underneath it. The man was tied to a chair, his mouth taped shut. His clothes were covered in splatters of blood, and Castiel was disappointed to see that, since it meant that his shot wasn’t going to be as visible as he wanted it to be. Sick satisfaction for him, he guessed.
Jessica leaned forward a bit, and placed her hand on his arm. “Dean, look at me,” she said in a gentle voice and he reluctantly looked at her. “Nothing you tell me is going to make me think badly about you. Nothing will make me look at you differently than I do now, or ten minutes ago, or after when you tell me. You got that?”
“You’ve the audacity to lie to me?” Castiel snorted angrily and shook his head. “Gabby, Gabby, Gabby…” Castiel had a moment of regret, and it wasn’t about his brother. He was surprised that he realized that he didn’t care about his brother’s life. What he cared about was that his white shirt was getting bloody by the second. He hadn’t realized it; but his hits had brought blood, and it was splattered all over Castiel’s shirt.
First, he noticed her. She was wearing a red dress that hugged her skinny body, making it look more angular and sharp than ever. The neck was low cut, making her pale chest stand out under the light. Her hair was down her body in curls, mostly resting on her back. Her makeup was light. Her jewelries accessorizing her wrists. Her eyes were cold and sharp, looking at every corner of the room, as if waiting for a threat. Amara had always been a beautiful woman, but her heart made her look like the ugliest creature on planet.
They’d been at it for almost three hours and Dean was exhausted. Not to mention how much pain he had to endure holding all his bags. Sam had already found his gift for Jess, which was a record player and a few records. Dean wished he could just see something and know it was perfect for Castiel, but nothing had had that wow factor so far. Shopping for Claire was much easier. Babies always had a lot of adorable stuff for sale. Dean went a bit overboard buying every toy and clothing that caught his eye, but Claire was worth it.
Dean waved, walking into the waiting area. Dean turned to Castiel, tilting his head to the door, and Castiel put down the magazine, following behind him. They walked in comfortable silence until they got into the elevator.
Frowning, Anna nodded. “Yeah, that’s true. But that’s going to change now, right? We’re going to stay in touch? And we’ll visit?”
“He’s in the bouncy castle,” Sam said. “Playing with the other kids.”
“Fine. Keep laughing.” Dean was fighting back a smile.
“Wait, don’t go yet,” Anna said. “Let me go get my brother. I want you to meet him. Well, I want
Once the questions were done, everyone lined up for the book signing. Castiel didn’t move fast enough, and the line was already all the way outside the door by the time he reached it. He was overwhelmed with the amount of people, so he decided to take a break and went to the restroom. When he came back, Castiel got in the back of the line, rounding the corner of the bookstore.
Dean laughed, climbing inside his own car.
Dean led Castiel to the booth and offered him something to drink.
Castiel gaped at Dean, letting go of his hand. “I can’t fucking believe you! I told you when we were at the store to go, but you said you didn’t have to.”
Dean laughed. “Is that a yes?”
In the darkness of the room, he could make out Dean’s silhouette beside him. His husband. His friend. Dean had surprised him tonight. He hadn’t once raised his voice. He hadn’t lost his temper. Instead, he’d been understanding and comforting. Dean was a good man. But there was a distance between them now, one that Castiel didn’t know how to breach. Letting Dean back in meant breaking down the walls he’d worked so hard to build up. Castiel wasn’t ready for that, especially not now.
“In the afternoon?”
Castiel gave him a sympathetic look and a pat on the shoulder. “I’ll give you two a moment.”
Dean snorted. “No, it isn’t.” Then he gulped down half of the water bottle at once.
“That’s not fair,” Castiel whispered.
“It said ‘hard!’” Jo said.
“And I don’t want the world to see me, ‘cause I don’t think that they’d understand,” Dean sang, mockingly dramatic.
“I like having you in here. Feels right.”
“Well, it matters to me.
Despite the terrible day Dean had been having so far, he managed to smile. Maybe, he thought, this wasn’t the end of the world.
Raejean smirked. “So much confidence for someone who can’t shoot straight.”
“Why does everyone keep asking that? Yes, I’m perfectly fine. Actually, I was thinking about going home on my break—my home, not yours. I need to pick up my old uniforms and since Dean is at work right now, it’s the best time to get them. Do you mind covering for me while I go? I talked to Ellen already.”
Anna sighed. “Deal.”
Dean shrugged. “Sure.”
“Sure, he’s handsome and intelligent and interesting, but I don’t think professors are even allowed to date their students. It would be inappropriate for me to hit on him.”
Castiel walked a few feet away to an empty section between two long bookcases and answered the phone. “Hello?”
Charlie and Rosa exchanged a glance.
“Is that why you look like a kicked puppy?”
The living room was seeped in darkness.
Dean bent down to kiss him. “Good morning.”
Anna was driving now. She’d just finished Castiel’s book and she couldn’t shut up about it. Dean was in the backseat listening to her going on and on.
“Let her go,” Castiel repeated, when Natalie started to struggle to break free again. “Let her go. She didn’t do anything.”
“Sir,” said the valet with a slight bow.
He opened the door with a bang and shot whoever was close to him, right through her head. A young girl got on the counter and jumped up at him. He tried to shoot at her, but she threw herself at him. They both went down with a grunt. The girl straddled him quickly and brought her knife down to stab him, but he blocked her by his forearm. It slashed through his shirt and he hissed at the sharp pain. He grabbed her forearm as she tried to stab him again. Castiel held her hand and twisted the knife around and pushed up.
Castiel returned his gaze, coolly, and said, “Because if you won't, some people will suffer in a very... unpleasant way. People who are very important to you.”
“Maybe some other day,” Castiel said, as he sat down on the stool by the counter.
And then, Mr. Novak was pulling out of him and Dean hadn’t realized that Mr. Novak came with him. But did he? Next thing he knew, Mr. Novak was taking off his ball gag. He could hear it being thrown away and there was a body slithering up his chest. Before he could close his mouth, he was presented with Mr. Novak’s dick into his mouth.
“I love it,” he said, staring at his hands as his cheeks flamed up with embarrassment.
Castiel did a quick job of sliding down Dean’s jeans to his knees. He waited for Dean to toe off his boots and Castiel got the jeans all the way out. Dean’s face split into a grin as he sat back up on the desk and spread his legs out again. Castiel stood between them and gave Dean a searing kiss on the lips, before he pulled back again and pushed Dean down on the desk. Dean went willingly and wiggled about to get comfortable there. Castiel smirked at him as he noticed the impressive bulge in between Dean’s legs. He was still wearing his black boxer briefs.
Dean ended the call quickly after that and stared at the coffee table in front of him. Was he crazy? Running back to the man that… what? What did he do exactly?
“What, why are you pushing me away? Don’t tell me it’s your goddamn phone,” Dean said grumpily, and Castiel had to smile because of the adorable pout he was sporting.
Castiel stopped by the stairs and shrugged his suit jacket on. “Tell them I'm not in. The meeting's postponed,” he glanced up at Kayla's face and saw her raised eyebrows and wide eyes. “Or maybe tell Anna to take care of it.” Castiel gave her a gentle smile and quickly walked down the stairs.
“Pants. We need to… pants,” Dean breathed out, but he continued to kiss Mr. Novak. His hands moved down Dean’s body, and he did a quick work on them. He pushed back, and Dean let out a dissatisfied sound; he didn’t want for them to have any sort of distance between them.
Dean looked at him, surprised. “Excuse me?”
Dean had been pretty shaken up by this. They weren’t in a good place in the relationship as it was, and Castiel coming home looking like that didn’t help things at all.
And then Dean’s arms were there again, and this time, Dean didn’t hesitate to pull him close to his chest. This time, Dean’s hand ran through his hair, over and over again. Until Castiel melted against his chest even more, turned his head to the side, and ignored the dampness in his eyes. It didn’t take him long to fall asleep, but before he did, he felt Dean let out a shuddering breath, and then his lips brushed up against Castiel’s forehead in a soft kiss.
“C-Cas… S-Sir, don’t do an-anything,” came the choked out reply from a voice that Castiel would give anything to hear.
“It will be in two months’ time.”
When Mr. Novak stopped Dean let out a shuddering breath. He gasped through number “Nine...” His voice wavered. His skin was red, but there was no blood. Just the sting of the whip being connected with his skin.
Castiel hesitated and looked at Dean, really looked at him. He looked just as exhausted as Castiel felt. There were bags underneath his eyes. There were frown lines on his forehead that Castiel hasn't seen before. "Yeah," he finally replied but didn't elaborate.
” she screamed at his face, and all Castiel could do was stand there and take it. Because she was right. This was his fault. He didn’t do fucking anything. He just… He was just there to watch as that tiny baby girl got shot and died in front of him. There literally was nothing that he could ever do. “I knew the minute I heard he was connected with you something like this was going to happen!” she continued to scream.
You people are amazing for being so patient with me. I'm not gonna go into details as to what's happening (if you're curious, you can ask, don't be shy), so I'm sorry I'm taking so long.
“Dad! Dad, see? This is Captain America, dad. He looks like you and that’s why he is my favorite,” she said, her voice loud, almost close to a screech.
“I can’t… I can’t…”
Mr. Novak frowned at him and tilted his head to the side. “But you already have me…”
)?” She nodded and released him.
He gave her a smile and said, “Yes?”
He closed his eyes and took steadying breaths. He loved feeling that warmth of his doms, the kind of dom that didn't want to see him hurt for real, that is. He loved feeling how much they cared about him after a scene. Looking in their eyes and seeing sincerity in their depths, because it was easy for Dean to read their eyes. They didn't hold back the truth from him.
“You look tired,” Castiel whispered to him, running his hand over his features.
When Mr. Novak kissed, he put his everything to it, it seemed. Mr. Novak grabbed him by his chin and tilted his head up a bit higher, his tongue entering and swirling about in his mouth with renewed passion. He then moved his hands to Dean's cheeks and held him there. Dean's hands were still by his sides. Mr. Novak moved his kisses down to his chin, tilted his head up as he went down. He licked and sucked on his neck, and Dean couldn't help the shudder that went through his body. He tilted his head back easily, giving more access to him. And Mr. Novak took it. He moved his lips towards Dean's earlobe, bit down at it, and then kissed right underneath his ear.
They got to the house in a record time and they were rushed inside by more men. Emilio was in the living room, already talking on the phone with someone. Anna wasn’t around, and it was for the best that she wasn’t. As soon as Emilio saw him, he nodded at him, but didn’t end the call. He was speaking in rapid Spanish, and honestly, Castiel didn’t have enough energy in him to pay attention.
“All of these tattoos… they represent me, as a crime boss. A head of a mafia. The angel wings is our family crest. And the other represent things, such as; freedom, death, peace, chaos,” Castiel said pointing the tattoos in question. Freedom were the swallows on his lower back. Death was the one that took most of his side. It was of a wolf, mouth wide open, with a human skull inside his mouth. The peace sign was of an elephant, but it didn’t look healthy either. Instead, it was filled with thorns, and it was bloodied. Chaos was the one that stood out the most for Dean. It was in a circle, arrows shooting in all directions.
“Maybe someday; after you’ve popped your cherry; you’ll get it,” Michael sipped his coffee and (not so) playfully smacked Castiel on the back.
“Like hell you are. You’re staying here where it’s safe.”
He could hear rustling through the phone before Dean asked in a deep, hushed voice, "What are you wearing?"
“I'm sure he's fine, Castiel's a good kid. He's probably at a cafe hogging up an entire table, drinking all their espresso, and making the waitresses uncomfortable with his creepy stare.”
When Dean returned Benny's pizzas were done and waiting to be eaten, "Thanks," Benny said as Dean handed him the two pies. "When you're out come by to Hope's, her brother is in town for the weekend, it's gonna be wild," he waved to Dean before hurrying out of the store to get the pizzas back while they're still hot.
"Hey we're not messing around, Cas also found this journal," Castiel grabbed the old brown book off the desk where he set it while they continued to look.
“Oh my God, why did you come?”
Dean realized he wanted to tell him family all about Cas, he wanted them to meet him. He wanted Cas to come over for dinner and meet his parents. He wanted to take Cas for a ride in the Impala; maybe out to the campground and they could sit on the hood and look at the stars as he and Sammy did with dad so many times before. Cas could probably point out all the constellations, he would know their origin stories. He wanted so much with Cas. He didn't want that slimy guy Crowley to touch him anymore, he didn't want Cas to go home with random guys at parties. He wanted Cas to himself.
Dean sighed but stood up and pulled on his boxers as Cas retrieved a tissue to wipe his chest off before pulling a towel from his basket of clean laundry to wrap around his waist. “So I won’t see you at dinner tonight, then?”
“We have to take the bus,” Cas said, licking the crumbs off his fingers, sucking gently attempting to remove the stain from the berry off his pointer finger. Dean tried not to stare as Cas sucked on his finger, but he was suddenly very aware that he had stopped chewing, and that Cas was staring back at him, clearly aware of Dean’s gaze.
“Dean, I had a great time. I promise. Now put on some pants before my brother comes back.”
Sam let out a huff of laughter, relieved that something finally got Dean to stop waiting by the phone, but then quickly furrowed his brow and called after Dean, “I wasn’t serious about throwing rocks at birds you know!”
"It's so obvious, Cas. I met him that one time and I could see it."
The two hurried downstairs and found the group huddled around the kitchen table, the journal laying open in front of them.
“Dean, you left your toothbrush on the sink,” Castiel said, nearing the bedroom before stopping just before Michael. Michael moved out of his way so Cas could enter the room and pass the toothbrush off to Dean as if it were a baton in a relay race.
Dean went to open his mouth but Gabriel quickly said, "I'll get her out of your hair," with a wink to his brother.
“Why’s that funny?”
Michael appeared in the doorway as Dean packed his bag. Dean tossed his wine-stained swimsuit into the duffel bag on the bed when he noticed Michael hovering, he nodded in the direction of the oldest Novak as if to ask him what was up.
“Yes, it felt like such a relief," he paused before asking "Why are you so convinced something happened?” as he tossed a few pieces of popcorn in his hand.
After the two left, Ash took a long sip of his soda before he said, “I didn’t want to say anything in front of them, but I got us these,” Ash pulled out his wallet and slid a card across the table to Dean.
Castiel tilted his head innocently, “What else would I have meant?”
"Me neither," Dean said, picking up and inspecting his empty soda can.
The second time she woke up in the mine, Jo was slightly more alert, and realized she was in big trouble if she couldn’t get out of there. She mustered up some strength to rip her shirt to try to create a makeshift sling for her arm. Without food or water, she would surely die before she could even make a serious attempt to dig herself out.
“I thought these two were bad, I don’t know what I would have done with two more!” Mary laughed.
“Yes, yes it is,” he said slowly, his grin spreading wider.
Mary had an amused look on her face and eyed him quietly, allowing him to stew in his own words.
“What took ya so long?” Dean asked, licking his fingers before looking up to meet a pair of bright blue bloodshot eyes, the lids halfway closed. He was smiling a gorgeous half grin at Dean, he couldn’t help but noticed how bright and cheery his smile was. “What? We don’t get an invite to the hotbox?”
"What?" The two looked at each other for a moment with confusion before Dean asked, "Wait, did you think you weren't going to see me until the fall?"
As they opened the door to the stairs Castiel said with a smirk, “And exactly how many times have you been in the library?”
Castiel looked up and squinted his eyes, and slightly tilted his head before saying, “No, I’m a historian.”
Castiel smirked with an “Okay,” as Dean threw the car into reverse and pulled out of the driveway. “Where are we going?” He asked, the car driving away from Dean’s neighborhood, the streetlights becoming more and more sparse.
“Dean!” Jack exclaimed with a smile so exuberant, Dean knew the kid must have missed him while he was away at school. Dean pulled Jack into a hug first, patting him on the back with a “Hey, kid,” that he knew Jack would detest.
“Shut up!” Dean exclaimed, punching his brother in the arm harder than he should have.
When Dean pushed open the door and officer said to him, “Nothing to see here.”
"Dean, are you sure?" Castiel stammered, his heart picking up speed and feeling a sudden lump forming in his throat. Dean nodded yes as Castiel's face broke into a smile, the infectious smile that caused one to spread on Dean's face as well.
“It eats people?” Jack asked, horrified.
Jo shrugged, “Fine, I guess. Her name’s Bela.”
Dean’s eyes followed downward as Castiel’s shirt was lifted up, noticing the dark trail of hair, his eyes couldn’t help but wander a little bit down before he realized he was staring at his best friend’s little brother’s crotch. When Dean’s eyes lifted he noticed Castiel staring at him, and he immediately looked to Gabe who hadn’t noticed any of this as his cheeks started to burn. Castiel did not seem phased by his gaze and slowly smoothed out his shirt.
Cas scoffed at his brother before they made their way to the elevator, and once inside it he turned to Dean and said, “You look very handsome,” he brought a hand up to feel the soft material of Deans’ gray sweater.
“I’m friends with his brother,” Jen said, nodding towards the direction of the house and dropping her discarded cigarette to the ground. "and he totally had it coming."
Soon enough everyone had a mug with a hot beverage warming up their cold hands as they sat in silence around the room. Jack stared into the blazing fire, ignoring the hot cocoa Charlie had made him, no one making an attempt to speak with him about his sister. Dean and Castiel had taken over an oversized chair, barely fitting as they squeezed together. Cas was leaned forward over his knees with his mug in his palms and Dean's free hand was gently rubbing his back. If anyone noticed the closeness between the two it remained unspoken.
“I know. My brother was worried.”
Jo let out a, "Gross, Dean," that went ignored by him.
“Alright.”
“Of course, Charlie will be thrilled.”
"I would enjoy that," Castiel said, "we could use a break from the library."
“And he won’t be corrupted from hanging out with you?” Dean rubbed the back of his head where the pointed end of the pencil hit him.
"You aren't going to murder me are you?" Castiel asked when Garth started walking down the stairs into the library basement, which earned a laugh from his new friend.
"We could take a weekend to visit her, you know. It's a 2 hour plane ride," Gabriel said clapping his brother on the knee when he noticed how sad his brother was thinking about their sister.
"It's not running? Weren't we the last ones here? Only Charlie has the key," Sam trailed off as he stared out over the mountain, the ski lift stopped in its tracks, through the snow he couldn't see past a couple chairs but it looked like they had been stopped a while based on the few inches of snow built up.
“I hope so,” Castiel said, looking down at his coffee cup.
After a few minutes, the joint was finished and Adam and his friends all agreed that it was time for them to go get something to eat. Now that the seat next to him was open, the stranger sat down and flashed his bright smile to Castiel.
“Glad to see you made it home safely,” Castiel said, turning his attention to Gabriel to give Dean a bit of privacy while he dressed.
When the front door closed Dean stiffened, worried how his dad would react to Cas being here. John had been out at the Roadhouse with Bobby; their post-holiday tradition; and he could be in any mood now that he had been drinking.
After class ended and Dean started to pack his notebook back into his backpack he noticed a tan trench coat walking down the steps in the lecture hall, so he shouted, “Hey! Cas!”
“Uh, personal space, Cas,” Dean coughed uncomfortably, nodding to his roommate and raising his eyebrows as if to say
"Yeah, he," Dean sighed loudly and his hands balled up into fists, "he told me I had to fuck him for the grade or he would tell administration I propositioned him."
Dean was livid, their delivery guy called out for the third shift in a row and once again Dean was stuck doing deliveries. On top of already having a shitty week doing piles of homework and worrying like crazy about Cas, now he had to do deliveries. He grabbed the pizza pouch and double checked the order with the receipt before hurrying out the door, knowing the second he got back he would just have to go out again.
“Yeah, beautiful isn’t she?” Dean asked, climbing into the driver's seat.
“A surprise? What is it?”
“I should,” Dean cleared his throat, “I should go,” he turned to begin out the door but Castiel stopped him, grabbing his wrist.
"You were pretty fucked up," Dean took a sip of his own.
“Mom! Dean's boyfriend is coming over?” Sam shouted down the stairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Enough from the peanut gallery. Grab your shit or else you'll have to get there on your own," Dean said with his duffel bag over his shoulder, already halfway to the ski lift, which thankfully seemed to running smoothly. A couple years after the shut down, since the Singer family still needed the lift to work to access their home, they ended up purchasing the resort for a steal. The previous owner refused to keep the lift running after their business went into the ground, so the Singer’s and their guests had to maintain plowing a long, narrow, winding driveway that filled up with snow faster than they could keep up, and when the owner became desperate enough they placed a bid seeing as the price kept dropping each year. Bobby and Ellen described their pipe dreams of reopening down the line, Ellen would open a second Roadhouse and serve her famous BBQ burgers to skiers who worked up an appetite on the slopes. And Bobby would be the head of the rangers, his days spent on the mountain, monitoring to make sure all the ski instructors and park rangers were doing their due diligence.
"She is well, she's enjoying school. She says Chicago is lovely, but she misses us terribly."
“You wanna go too?” Dean asked Castiel, all their friends were leaving and Dean was pretty sure Castiel would prefer to hang out somewhere else a bit more quiet.
Castiel shrugged and averted his eyes to the blank wall, "I don't know."
Gabriel thought.
“Gabe, let’s go sign up for the tournament,” Dean said after chugging the rest of his beer, partly to get away from Michael and also wanting a distraction from wishing Cas was there.
At the library Castiel was about to head towards the first open table as he usually does but Garth had other plans, "If I show you a secret spot will you promise not to spoil it?"
“That doesn’t surprise me, it looks like it could be someone’s home.”
"You sure you've never drank before, you took that like a champ!" Dean leaned in closer to Cas, trying to talk to him over the music.
"You ate sushi?" Sam asked, bewildered.
Three girls approached the guys and the shortest of the group said, “Hi, we’re playing volleyball but we don’t have enough players, do you want to play?” She pointed to a volleyball net behind her, with a few more people standing by it.
“How do you tie this fuckin’ thing?” Dean asked after exiting the restroom.
“Munchies kicking in, Cas?” Dean asked, earning a small smile from his friend.
Castiel showered for much longer than usual, desperately scrubbing himself clean. Nothing like a late night shower to reevaluate your life. He promised himself not to let this happen again, he couldn't spend another dazed weekend in Crowley's apartment. He only realized he had been in the shower for too long when he suddenly realized the water was freezing cold. His sudden shivering snapped him out of his thoughts and he realized he had many assignments he had neglected over the weekend.
“Are you kids okay?” Bobby asked, grabbing the next kid that was closest to him, pulling them into a hug. When he pulled away and saw Jack’s face, his cheeks rosy red from the cold but untouched. “What the hell are you doing?” He angrily asked the group, mostly aimed at his daughter.
"Would you like a drink, Cas?" Dean asked before offering beer or rum.
“Huh, well congrats you two,” he said after a moment.
“What? No!” Castiel got closer and upon further inspection he realized that it did in fact have the word scratched into the drivers side. “Dean, I-” Castiel started speaking but found he was speechless, he really had no idea what to say.
“Yeah?” Sam half asked despite knowing it’s true, wondering what Dean was getting at.
Jen giggled as Jo turned her attention away from Benny, noticing she recognized the newcomer. “Hey, weren’t you in Dr. Alexander’s freshman history last Spring?” Jo asked.
"You too," Benny said in his smooth southern accent before turning to Dean, “I meant to ask you earlier if you wanted to come to a party tonight?"
“Yeah, I know.” Dean said defensively, knowing where this was headed.
“We’ll see about that when I open up the best damn pretzel shack this town has ever seen,” Dean smirked back, then stopping in his tracks when his eyes shifted to the car. “Cas, what is that?” Dean asked, his eyes wide, staring at the driver’s side door.
Ash winced, but didn’t object, he knew he would get berated from his sister as well as their parents for getting kicked out of MIT.
“Right back at ya,” Dean said, using one arm to wrap around Castiel’s back and the other to tip his chin to meet his lips.
“How’s classes?” Dean adjusted the strap on his backpack as they started out the door behind the herd of other students eager to exit the lecture hall.
Castiel yawned and nodded, sitting up, revealing his messier than normal morning hair.
“Yeah, I could have a drink, how ‘bout you, Cas?”
“Cas’ uncle is really weird,” he shook his head and walked away from the phone, following his mom into the kitchen where she was cleaning up from dinner. He picked up a dish towel and began drying the dishes she had just washed.
“I should get to the bookstore before they close,” Castiel said, glancing at his watch before standing up and stretching, exposing a small bit of skin below his belly button.
“It was,” Castiel paused, unsure how to explain the mixed emotions he had experienced over the past month, “strange,” he said with his eyes squinted but with a smile on his face. “How was yours?”
drew Castiel to Dean more than usual, wanting to spend more time with him to try to figure it out. Castiel wanted to know more about Dean, he wanted to know everything about him. But the more time Castiel spent with Dean, the more Gabriel seemed to pry, which led to Castiel backing off a bit mostly because he knew how meddling his brother can be. And the last thing he wanted was Gabriel to get involved in his love life, or lack there of.
“That would ruin the surprise, wouldn’t it?” Cas said as he began to tug at Dean’s pants and pressing desperate kisses to anywhere on Dean’s body that his lips could find. Dean brought his hand to palm Castiel through his boxer briefs, causing Cas’ hips to buck up into his hand. “Take those off,” Cas whined as Dean quickly pulled down his own boxers.
Castiel continued staring at the empty space where Dean was, but felt eyes staring into him. He turned his head and saw his brother staring intently at him, mouth open- shocked. Castiel couldn't believe how blatantly he had just checked out Dean in front of his brother. He jumped off the bed, "I gotta go," he said quickly before Gabe had the chance to speak.
Gabriel closed the mini fridge after passing a beer can each to Benny and Jo.
“Is your friend okay?” Jen asked, looking past Castiel and squinting her eyes.
“You better keep this one around, Cassie,” Michael said, pouring himself a second cup of coffee.
"There's gotta be somewhere on the mountain that gets service, it can't all be a dead zone, right?" Benny suggested.
Gabriel grabbed his pencil and tossed it at Dean, hitting him in the back of the head. “Don’t hang out with him too much, you’ll corrupt him.”
The four made it to the dining hall before it was even open for lunch and had to wait at the entrance behind another eager group. When the kitchen staff finally opened the doors Dean made a beeline for the grilling station, his growling stomach patiently waiting for a cheeseburger. Castiel appeared next to him and lightly drummed his fingers on his plate. “Nothing cures a hangover like a burger, eh Cas?” Dean asked.
The few minutes Castiel was gone felt like an eternity to Dean. He sat on the seat his friend was just in, his leg bounced nervously and he suddenly didn’t know what to do with his hands, so they fumbled in his lap nervously.
as if she didn’t know what was really happening. She was in denial. He began spending time with Meg Masters again. She was no good for him but he didn’t care, she was one of the only people who would even talk to him outside of his small circle. Meg Masters was the kind of girl to skip class to smoke and give handies below the bleachers, so Castiel spent the hour he was supposed to be in home ec chain smoking Parliaments while Meg disappeared with that senior Cowley or whatever his name was- Cas didn’t care to learn it. Whenever him and Meg finished he would come out from behind the shed, zipping his pants up and say
“You just don’t usually drink so much,” Dean said, concern still lingering in his voice.
Quite possibly the most exciting part of the Spring semester is picking room assignments for the following school year. Part of the excitement was the potential that everything-
“That sounds perfect, I’m looking forward to it, Dean.”
“Did your grandparents visit for Christmas?”
“The mine,” Bobby nodded, understanding, not even questioning the monster part. “John, you ready?”
“Why don’t we ever come up in the summer?” Castiel asked quietly.
Benny introduced the two to his friends on the deck, Andy and Adam. Andy waved, exhaling a large cloud of smoke before passing his joint to Adam, who also waved to the new guys. Dean leaned against the exterior of the house, sipping his drink, careful not to drink it too fast; Cas was already fairly intoxicated and Dean knew he had to watch out for him while Gabe was off with Hope. Turns out Adam was in Castiel's intro to psychology class, and now with the liquor flowing, the two were eager to make friends, able to talk at a more reasonable volume outside where the music wasn't blasting.
"Shi-shoot it's almost dinner time, gotta go!" Andy exclaimed, now that Mary was home that meant his mother was also likely home and wondering where he was.
“Want me to threaten to kick his ass too?” Jo grinned and Benny whined a very distinct “No!” in response.
“You'll hear from him soon. It’s summer vacation, he’s probably busy,” she reassured.
“Why are you really calling?”
“I don’t, but we have to try,” Dean squeezed his brother's shoulder reassuringly. “You, Charlie and Jack need to stay here- keep trying the phones, look around the house for anything that could help. I mean really turn this place upside down, got it?” Sam nodded sadly before glancing over to Ruby, who was pulling on a hat with a serious look on her face. “We’ve got this? Don’t we, Cas?” Dean said in attempt to reassure his younger brother.
“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but yes. We’ve gotta find your friends before that thing decides it’s dinner time. And looks like we’ve gotta soon before the sun comes up.”
“Yeah, ditto.” They remained in a pregnant pause, Castiel leaning against the fridge until Dean said, “Charlie says you guys haven’t been in school.”
“Crass and exaggerated?”
Castiel shrugged despite Dean not being able to see the motion. “Spite, I suppose.”
“Oh yeah, uh, I forgot to mention-” Gabriel started before Michael appeared on the patio.
“Delicious, here,” Dean extended the cup and Cas took a quick sip before anyone noticed he didn’t have a 21+ wristband on.
“You wouldn’t want him on your team, trust me, he sucks at sports,” Michael laughed at his brother, who scowled and dug his feet into the hot sand, trying to find cooler sand beneath the surface.
“You’re leaving tonight?” Castiel asked hopefully, stopping to pause before he was about to go down the hall to wake Dean.
"Well, yeah, them's slim pickings in other queer guys." Castiel nodded. "Not in college though, it'll get better when you go to school."
“Pizza here sucks,” Dean said, stuffing the cone into his mouth.
Gabriel apparently wasn’t planning on having dinner with his friends that night, which didn’t entirely surprise Dean. Thanksgiving break officially started tomorrow, there were no classes so everyone on campus was buzzing with excitement, talking about the holiday and happy that midterms were mostly over. Gabe was likely out drinking with Chuck.
Castiel laughed, "Fine, meat lovers it is. I'm too hungry to argue any more."
Castiel stood next to Dean and said, “We don’t need to talk about our feelings,” he bumped his shoulder into Dean with a knowing smirk, causing Dean to glance over at him with a curious look in his eyes. “But I just want us to be on the same page, are you sleeping with anyone else?”
“You shouldn't spend so much time around such children.”
“What’s that?”
Charlie and Castiel barged in a few minutes later, “Who’s ready for a Star Trek marathon?” Charlie exclaimed with a grin on her face.
He took another long sip from his straw and nodded his head towards Gabriel, rubbing up against the back of a petite woman. Castiel shook his head, not even remotely interested in his brother when Dean was swaying beside him, green eyes glimmering from the neon club lights. Dean’s lips remained touching the straw, but not enough that he could be sipping from it. His hand wandered to Cas’ lower back, attempting to get the younger boy dancing with him.
“I don’t know, we’re exclusive,” Jo shrugged and her thought trailed off. “Should’ve given you some warning.”
Lily seemed to get bored when Castiel didn't engage and sauntered back to the party.
Dean averted his eyes, looking at the floor, ashamed. This was something he wanted to keep secret until the day he died, he promised himself we would never tell another soul. But he had to tell Cas- he had to warn him. "Cas, please. I won't let him hurt you."
Dean thought to himself, unconsciously gripping the steering wheel tighter. He didn't know what he was going to tell his mom about Cas. At Thanksgiving dinner he kicked Sammy under the table when he asked Dean if Cas was his boyfriend, with a flash of anger in his eyes and the slightest hint of a blush across his cheeks. He pretty much stopped talking about Cas after that. Dean wondered if he even needed to tell her about Cas- of course he didn't need to. But that didn't mean that he didn't want to tell her about the funny way he tilts his head when he's confused like a puppy learning commands. He knew she would love his laugh, deep and hearty, like everything was the funniest thing he had ever heard. His toothy smile was truly contagious-  he just knew she would love him. Mary would undoubtedly make Cas feel like family; she was the kind of woman who would find out his favorite food and make it for dinner the next night. God, Cas would love mom's brownies. Hell, Dean was sure even John would like Cas. Dad never failed to miss Jeopardy after dinner, and Dean was positive Cas would be great at it, the guy was a freakin’ encyclopedia. And Sammy- those two would be peas in a pod. They'd nerd out over mythology or Shakespeare and make Dean feel like a complete moron.
“Did you wear sunscreen?” John asked with a raised eyebrow.
“This is the famous Ash, huh?” Gabe asked, looking up from his camera.
"Gabe we'll split a Hawaiian, and you two get whatever you want," Jo said, tapping her foot impatiently on the tile floor as she motioned to Dean and Cas. She just wanted to get the decisions over with so they could eat already.
“Not really, just the basics,” Dean shrugged and he flipped a pancake.
Dean groaned, “Mom can’t take us?”
Dean didn’t need the one, he had his son Ben, his brother, his few close friends. He didn’t need anyone else. Dean was content. He worked, brought Ben home from karate or soccer or whatever after school activity the kid was into on that particular day. He had star trek marathons with Charlie, and went out with Benny on the weekends he didn’t have Ben. Dean most certainly didn’t need the one. He occasionally needed someone- in his bed at the end of the night, but definitely not the one.
“Lead the way,” Castiel extended his arm towards the doorway signaling for the older boy to go in that direction.
If it wasn't for the shots of tequila Castiel took beforehand he would have been incredibly anxious and uncomfortable with a crowd this size, but he felt weightless and carefree with a grin plastered to his face. Charlie looked surprised at the crowd, they told her it would be packed there, but none of them could have prepared her for this level of craziness.
The two breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the lights of the house in the distance, but they were unable to feel safe yet as they still were exposed in the woods.
“Wow, Cas, I had no idea you were a philosopher,” Dean said sarcastically as he glanced to the stairs where Sam and Jess appeared, holding hands with shy smiles on their faces. “Hey, look,” he nodded to his brother and smiled.
“That’s great, Cas! Where?” Dean breathed a sigh of relief, a smile on his face.
A shout came from inside, “Where are all the chicks? Man, it’s a sausage fest in here!”
“I uh, well at Hope’s party you left with a guy. Said he was in class with you,” Castiel continued staring at him, “But Hope said he doesn’t go to school.”
Castiel remained silent but gently squeezed Dean’s arm, “Maybe we should turn back and get Charlie to guide again.”
“I have a project on the Industrial revolution I need to finish.”
“You’re still in high school, I’m sure you’ll feel differently after more experience.”
“If this thing took Anna and Benny, maybe it took my brother and sister,” Charlie said solemnly.
“Bela, right?”
Dean sighed and raised his can, “To Ash and Jo. This trip’s for you guys.”
“Is this date as terrible as you imagined?” Castiel asked after he swallowed a bite.
Castiel was silent for a moment, “I don’t know. I’ll have to check my schedule.”
“Any luck?” Gabriel asked his brother, who was roaming around the costume store wide eyed.
“Hiya, Cas,” Dean said as he approached his friend.
He couldn’t muster the words to tell her, so he just let himself cry.
“I can't be around him right now,” his voice cracked, he sounded like he was about to cry. It completely broke Dean's heart to hear him this way. “I didn't know where else to turn to. Michael always takes his side, and Gabriel can't be bothered to get in the middle of it,” he rushed out in a huff.
“Well yes, I hope it will improve our relationship.”
Meanwhile, across campus in another freshman dorm Castiel was standing at the security desk behind a bubbly redheaded sophomore, Charlie. Charlie was instructed to train Castiel for his new job and was animatedly explaining the job to him.
"You know, Dean. I have a spare bed at my apartment. It's warm and comfy, and we have lots of snacks if you wanna eat them. We also have some books, TVs, some board games and all sorts of other cool stuff."
Dean doesn't seem to hear him; he has his earphones in as he wipes down the shelves. Castiel sighs and approaches his mate. He nudges Dean's ass with the toe of his shoe. "Dean." The omega startles and rips his earphones out as he swivels around. When he sees it's Castiel, Dean scowls at him and stands. "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
“So, uh…Dean, what kind of games do you like to play? We have tons of games at home.”
Dean could see the thirst clouding their eyes as Cas bends over to set the tray on the desk. He pulls off his robe and lets it glide down his delicate arms before lowering himself onto the alpha’s lap. He turns his body and leans into his mate’s hard chest. Dean caresses his thigh and then draws it back towards his backside. He continues talking, watching the eyes track his hand as it slips under the chemise, pushing it up to reveal tan and creamy skin, and squeezes Cas’s ass. The omega squirms and moans softly as he starts to dampen Dean’s lap with his slick.
"Are you slicking? I can smell it."
“I’ll have to admit, I wanted rip their throats out for touching what's
"Like I'm floating on a goddamn cloud." His voice was harsh and tight. His throat ached, like there was sandpaper just scratching the muscle raw. A half-empty cup of ice cold water sat at the table next to him. Cas grabbed it and brought it to his mate's lips. Dean took another sip.
The day went on, each minute worse than the last. The kids played in the playroom as Dean scrubbed toothpaste off the bathroom sink and unclogged Jessie's toilet. He tried letting them outside, but then Darren decided to try and climb over the neighbor's fence. The neighbor, a grouchy and distasteful old woman, screeched at Dean about his "damn kids." Dean barely managed through a few pages in the textbook before Darren had dropped Dean's cell phone in the toilet after playing with it (luckily, the bag of rice trick worked). Jessie had a fit and started throwing books around in her room, and Dean had to clean up after her and put her in time out. He locked himself in the bathroom and had a panic attack, hearing his father's words in his head again.
“Yes, baby. Daddy will take care of his pretty little baby. Now go shower.” He slaps his omega’s soaked ass. “Get that alpha stink off of you.”
Six centimeters dilated.
"Daddy?"
Another contraction hit, sharp as a gunshot. The pup was practically crushing his bladder.
“U-um, w-w-well...M-mister W-w-winchester,” he coughs and then says, “We will t-take your project into considerashhhh..” He trails off as he catches a whiff of Cas reentering the room with a glass of scotch. He turns and watches omega handing the drink to the man he was flirting with earlier.
Dean turned away. He loved and hated when Cas made these grand speeches; they never failed to make him blush like a schoolgirl, even now with all the pain he’s in.
Jessie climbed into the bed next to him, Dean hoisting her onto his lap.
Cas stood at the bedside, encouraging Dean to do the breathing exercises again. The contractions were growing closer to each other. The nurses had checked his vitals and temperature before placing the fetal heart rate monitor on his belly. He was six centimeters dilated.
"Dean, she's my agent, okay? You have nothing to worry about!"
"Alright, alright, just relax," he crooned. Dean's knees buckled, but Cas caught him, gripping his hips as he guided Dean onto the toilet seat. Cas held him steady, dabbing the sweat off his forehead with a square of toilet paper. Dean grabbed at Cas and felt himself being tugged to his feet. In any other situation, Dean would feel humiliated having his mate wipe his ass for him, but right now all he could think about is getting the hell out of dodge and going straight to the hospital. He barely heard the toilet flush as he was led over to the claw-foot and sat down.
"Hello," he answered in his best polite voice. The woman started to talk, but Dean could barely hear her over the sound of his son screaming. "Hold on one second." He cupped his hand over the speaker.
He remembered yowling in pain as she struck him over and over until eventually his jaw was too broken and swollen. He laid against the wall in a fetal position for what seemed like several hours, fighting tears, even when he knew it was a losing battle. His face was throbbing, and his tears had stung his wounds as they trailed down to the side of his face. All he could do was lie there quietly, teary-eyed and shaking, swallowing his whimpers.
"I-I-I don't wanna t-trouble you, Mister Cas. Yer nice and all but I'm real bad an' stinky an' loud an' I'on think you'd want me an'—"
Paranoia made him its bitch as it possessed every inch of his body, its thick and boneless body forking out, stretching to the tips of his fingers and toes.
place. He wanted to
Sitting on the couch, watching some B-list horror movie like they'd do every Friday night, laughing at the lazy writing and comically bad acting.
Dean sets the prepped plates on the table. "Yeah, morning sickness, cravings, headaches, the whole she-bang." Cas shuts his laptop and sets it aside. "I'm gonna pour some drinks." Jimmy switches on the TV and leans back, kicking his oxfords off and propping his feet on the coffee table.
Maybe this is peace.
"Baby, I promise you, when this is over, we will bring our beautiful baby girl home." Dean shook his head and sighed.
“I like to play hide and go seek, but I ain’t got friends and my ma and pa ain’t like me much, so I always play by myself. I heard about when I was watching the TV one night while my masters was sleepin' and saw some human kids playin’ it on the TV. It was a funny show.”
"Dean," Cas stands up and wraps his arms around Dean's waist, "look at me!" He tilts his mate's head towards him to force him to look into his eyes. "It doesn't matter how much she flirts with me. I only have eyes to you." He kisses Dean's nose. "Understand?" Dean touches his head to Cas's and then pecks his mate on the lips.
"Watch your step."
“Evening,” the investors mumble back as they leaf through the pages of their notebooks. Studious green eyes fixed on their worn faces, Dean undoes the lower buttons of his jacket and takes his seat.
"Yeah?"
With a sigh, Dean pushed himself off of the couch and went into the bedroom. He shut the door behind him and lumbered to the bed. He squeezed his eyes shut to fight tears. He couldn't let Cas see him like this. He couldn't have Cas having to comfort him again. Cas had enough on his plate between a full-time job and organizing family affairs and dealing with his older brothers. He didn't need Dean burdening him, too.
"Look, baby, I can't keep getting you snacks if you're just gonna dump them all over the floor, okay?" His words were lost on toddler ears as the boy jumped up and down, wailing, then dropped to the floor like a sack of potatoes and started rolling around. Dean wanted to roll around the floor crying, too. He sighed as he stood and then marched back to the pantry. He grabbed another pack of gummy bears, knowing deep down he was gonna regret this.
The men are already sporting hard-ons. Cas starts to pass them around, swaying his hips and lingering by a few of them to allow them a closer view of his panties. Dean starts to explain what Project X is, but his audience is hardly paying attention, instead focusing on the Omega settling himself onto Dean’s lap and crossing one leg over the other. A few alphas take a glimpse at their laps and cover their obvious and rather unimpressive bulges with their binders. Others don’t even bother averting their gaze; they just sit there, staring slack-jawed as they cup themselves through their pants.
The woman spoke again.
"How are you feeling?"
"It's cool, man." He squirmed as the pup continued to play hopscotch on his bladder.
Dean sat down in the nook of another tree he came across. He felt tired at this point. Tired. Weak. Defeated. Useless. Pathetic. After proving to be a disappointment of a pet, he was hoping he could at least still hunt. He wasn't even good at that. He was more useless than ever. Just as he sagged against the trunk and started to cry, he caught a whiff of the sweetest, most mouth-watering smell.
Dean rolled his eyes and scoffed. "Seriously? When I'm crying and panicking and shit, I make you happy?" Cas laughed. "Well, not when you're sad. But seeing you smile. It just makes everything worth it."
"Are your mommy and daddy looking for you? Where are they?"
“I know, baby. I know, but—”
“Evening, gentlemen. Welcome.”
"DAAAAADDDD!!!!!"
"Hannah?!" Dean snarls as he slams his half-eaten box of nuggets and hops off the counter. Cas resists the urge to roll his eyes. Dean has always had a problem with Cas's omega agent, especially since Hannah has made it known that she has a huge crush on him. Hannah's never obnoxious about it by overtly flirting with Cas or making snide comments about his mate, but she tends to be a little too obvious with the googly eyes she makes at him, and she always blushes and touches his arm, giggling a little too much when Cas cracks one of his dry jokes. She doesn't do it in front of Dean, though Dean has caught her a couple of times. "You mean that bitch that's always flirting with you and shit! And you're talking to her?" The kitchen starts to reek of angry, jealous omega. Cas holds back a sneeze.
"Not Jessie." Dean sniffled. "She fucking hates me."
"I heard you and Papa talking, kind of. And...I just want you to know that..." Dean watched as she twisted her mouth, making that face she'd make whenever she's contemplating something. She reminded Dean so much of himself in that sense. Like him, she was emotionally constipated, but Dean guessed that was what ran in the family. Dean had never been good at expressing his emotions, neither was Sam or Dad, even before Mom's death. Dean ran his fingers through her soft blonde hair.
Dean scoffed and fondly rolled his eyes, trying to pretend he wasn't blushing. “Dear God, Cas, you’ve always been one sappy motherfu—” he cut off with a pained cry as he was hit with another contraction. A nurse who was jotting down notes immediately paged the obstetrician, notifying him that he was ready to push again. The obstetrician arrived in record time as the nurse guided Dean back onto the bed. The OB lifted his gown and looked up at Dean.
"Are you hungry?"
"QUIET!"
! In any other situation, I’d have killed ‘em all on the spot.”
slick. Cas scrunched up his nose in disgust.
The omega sighed. He should not have decided to have kids. He knew from the minute he looked at the lines on the pregnancy test that he was setting himself up for failure. He kept picturing Jessie and Darren in the streets, groveling for money, barely clothed, covered in cuts and bruises, having to depend on sleazy alphas and betas to put food on the table. Following the same path as Dean. Even though he knew he had Cas, he knew deep down he would find a way to screw it up.
"D-dean." He finally answered. His voice was rough from both exhaustion and dehydration. The man's eyes surveyed his body, concern, anger and sadness flickering in his eyes. He swallowed hard before speaking again,
"What about your happiness?"
"Come on, you little shit! Get. Out!" he grit out. The contractions stopped. He lied there limply, legs wide open, gasping for air as a beta nurse tried to help him shift into a different position again. At some point, Cas had to help him out of the bed and had guided him to walk around. Dean held his mate's arm in a crushing grip, leaning heavily against his alpha’s side, because his legs still felt wobbly. More liquid started to trickle down the inside of his leg. Cas turned to him.
A few hitched gasps.
His legs carried him towards the source of the smell, up and down the hills, weaving around the trees, dodging the rough dying branches sagging from the trees until he reached the edge of a road. A variety of nice cars sped by. What caught his attention was the man standing at the shoulder of the road. He was built like a god or one of those soldiers—strong legs, broad chest and shoulders, and a defined jaw. Dean watched his profile. The man's face was twisted in anger and disbelief as he stared at his car. The man's handsome face looked worn. Like he had spent several nights crying and panicking. There was a sour tinge in his sweet scent. Dean wanted to go and comfort him.
"Dean, look at me." Dean lifted his eyes. "You are an incredible father and mate. You are the strongest, kindest, most beautiful, and most badass person I've ever met. You've endured things not many people could, and you came out stronger than ever."
"I'm sorry, you were saying?"
Dean's breath started to pick up. He could feel his cheek throbbing, tasting iron against the tip of his tongue. Suddenly, his heart is fucking racing and buzzing. His head spins. Everything around him becomes too dark, too light, to loud! It didn't help when Darren came running to the bathroom to bang on the door because he wanted to play with Dean's phone again. After fifteen minutes, he finally managed to collect himself and head out of the bathroom. He tried to help Jessie with her homework again but then she just tore the worksheets and leaflets up in a fit of frustration and ran out of the room. Dean had to clean up the mess and make a mental note to himself to contact the school.
“I’m not strong enough. It’s just...it’s too much…”
The other men watch the pair with envy, whimpering and rubbing themselves through their slacks. Dean bites down his lip and watches his mate guide the lucky alpha’s hands to the meat near the curve of his ass cheeks. The man gasps and leans in for another taste of the omega pulling away from him. Cas gives his thin wet lips one last nip before licking up the excess spit from his own.
"Yes, sweetheart?" Cas speaks in that annoyingly sweet voice of his (maybe it's just the hormones that make Dean find his voice annoying). Dean sits up.
Dean nodded. "Is'eal guh, Misser Cass-eell."
"Ess-cuse me, sir," the boy said sheepishly. "That's real rude of me..."
"Hello?" The man called again. "I'm not gonna hurt you."
"BUT THAT'S NOT FAIIIIRRRRR!!!!"
A heavy thud sounded from the living room. With an exasperated sigh, Dean plucked the last of the gummy bears off the floor and set them on the counter before stalking into the living room. Darren was standing in the middle of the room, shirt bunched up above his round belly, sucking his hand as the portable radio laid on the floor. Dean closed his eyes and groaned before kneeling to pick it up. He inspected it for any marks or splinters before bunching up the cord and setting it on top of the bookshelf.
Cas glanced down at the pool of amniotic fluid between his legs. Dean was sure he had shat himself a couple of times. It’s a good thing the nurses had put disposable paper sheets under him so he wouldn’t soil the actual mattress.
He pushes himself off the edge of his desk to shake their hands and make some tedious small talk. Cas is tucked away in some corner right outside, ready to execute his portion of the plan. His omega is willing, of course, for more reasons than Dean is comfortable with. He gestures towards their seats politely before going over to lean against his desk, one leg crossed over the other. He watches the other alphas take their seats, drinking in their appearance. All of them were pathetic looking in their late thirties, mid-forties. Three of them were moderately fit and handsome, but the other five were fat in the stomach and balding.
Suddenly, he felt the small of his back crashing into the rocks and ridges on the ground. The pain jerked him back into the real world. The dulling fog around him, the chill, the sounds of all the critters scurrying in the brush, disturbing the leaves. He sat up gingerly, wincing in pain. Once he was on his feet, he limped away from the tree as he heard the squirrel scurry away.
Dean sat back.
he tried to tell himself as his breathing became shallow. The contractions were starting to get sharper, harder. He let out a shaky cry.  Cas came back in with a cup of ice chips. Scenting the stench of a distressed omega, the alpha rushed to his side, taking his hand into his own.
"Jessie, when I ask you a question, you need to answer me. Why did you push him?"
Dean shook his head.
Dean was shocked by the question. He nodded.
As if on auto-pilot, Dean pointed in the direction of the trailer.
“Please and thank you,” he said politely.
“I don’t know, Sam. We just agreed the other day we aren’t seeing other people.”
“You do everything he says, do you ever think for yourself? It’s always Dean this and Dean says that! When are you going to learn that just because he’s your whole world, it doesn’t mean you’re his!” Jack shouted before grabbing a random knitted hat and storming out the door.
“Hell yeah! I’ll show you upstairs. You'll be staying in my room. If that's okay with you I mean,” Dean quickly added the last part.
“Glad you came back!”
“Is that the one about the guys who hunt monsters?” Dean asked, peering over Sam to look at the comic.
“What is this?” Castiel asked, looking around as Dean sat on the cool stone. He noticed some old rusty pieces of rebar sticking out and bent at odd angles.
“What’s wrong? Sad your boyfriend’s gone?” Same quipped after noticing Dean had just passed a channel with a women’s swimwear ad without pausing to check out the models as he usually did.
"We get along very well, if that's what you're trying to say."
“He’s nice enough.”
"Yeah, I'm fine," she waved him off, having coffee and a sandwich helped sober her up a bit, but she bit her lip, "okay I'm not fine, but I know how to get there."
“No.”
A bright light lit up the house, catching the attention of the group, exhausted and trying to pass the time until dawn hit since none of them were willing to try to sleep. The light source grew until it was nearly at the front door of the cabin, when they realized it was headlights to a car. They wondered how briefly until they heard someone calling out their names, Charlie and Sam rushed to the front door and threw it open.
“She punched me,” Dean whined, causing Gabe to laugh as he rolled onto his side to face Dean, then stuck his arms out in front of him.
Cause if you think I was born yesterday you have got me wrong.
“No, not so much, unless it's small. I go along to parties sometimes but I’d rather stay in.”
“It’s a dumb game,” Castiel said as he wiped the table.
“So,” Cas asked, drawing out the ‘o’ and nudging Dean with his elbow.
"Fruit doesn't belong on pizza, it's criminal!" Dean exclaimed.
Castiel sighed and picked up the dessert menu off the table, “It’s required. I can understand why, it’s important to understand how humans develop but I’m just not interested in learning about children and adolescents.” He placed it back on the table, not interested.
Ruby tentatively took a step closer to the edge of the woods before in a dark blur the creature appeared, shrieking as it came towards her with a slight limp. “Now!” She yelled to Dean and Cas, Castiel rushed forward and squeezed the spray bottle as hard as he could, lighter fluid squirting out a few feet ahead, so he got closer until Dean came behind him with the blow torch, the flame had decreased in size as it got hotter, now just a small blue nub on the end almost like an eraser on a pencil. Castiel tossed the container, fluid splashing out as it hit the creature, but as Dean started to toss his blowtorch towards the creature to ignite it, it’s long, gangly arms grabbed Ruby by the arm and yanked her towards it. The blowtorch landed on the creatures lower half and it shrieked as the flame touched it’s dark, decomposing skin, briefly letting go it’s grip on Ruby, it stepped back away from the flame back into the trees. She skid in the snow trying to stand up, and Dean and Cas reached out to help her up as the creature let out another shriek that threatened to blow out their ear drums. When Ruby was back on her feet, the three took off running back down the path towards the house. They knew the creature was right behind them just beyond the edge of the forest as Ruby pushed forward of the two, sprinting her way back before the monster stepped out from the treeline and grabbed Ruby by her hair, her hat falling off, then the creature whipped her over its shoulder before disappearing back into the woods. Dean briefly stopped to try to help Ruby, but it was too late and the monster was already out of sight. Castiel bent down to pick up the flashlight she dropped before tugging on Dean’s sleeve, indicating that they had to go now.
Castiel had to hurry to the dining hall across campus if he wanted to meet Charlie for lunch on time. When he arrived to the dining hall Charlie was reading the flyers tacked to a bulletin board in the lobby.
“You barely know him,” Gabriel scoffed.
Campus Pizza’s delivery driver called out yet again, and Dean complained about it from the second he got off the phone at nine in the morning until he left for work at eleven. Castiel wished him a good day and Dean mumbled something about it being good if he doesn’t kill anyone. Sam laughed and shook his head before eagerly asking Cas, “So what should we do today?”
“What? They didn't feed us all night.”
"So that’s our monster," Dean said with affirmation.
“It’s peaceful isn’t it?”
She sauntered towards him, leaning against the bare wall, "Have a date to the homecoming game next week?"
At the dining hall Jo asked, “So what’s the plan?”
"Hello, Dean. Is Michael ready?" He gestured to Gabriel's empty bed before Dean stopped what he was doing and crossed the room. Dean closed the door behind Castiel and gingerly pulled the backpack straps off his shoulders.
“You’ll be learning how to play the piano?” Mary perked up, clearly interested.
"What?" Castiel asked, shifting on Dean's bed uncomfortably.
“This is crap,” he said to himself, tossing the joint on the ground, feeling fed up with the shitty pot he had been buying from Andy. He had smoked an entire joint and was onto the second when he realized he was nowhere near as high as he should be. Castiel grunted and stood up, kicking at the discarded joint before stuffing his hands in his pockets to leave. He was still as anxious as he was when he arrived, and now he was frustrated that his efforts to calm had failed him. He shook his head as he headed back down the path, wanting to get back to the well lit street before the sun went down. He thought about stopping by to see Dean, but he was really not in the mood to deal with Gabriel. He sighed, knowing Charlie was at work, and Garth had signed up for intramural dodge ball- there wasn’t anyone available he wanted to be around right now.
“Wanna grab lunch?” Dean asked, turning right onto the sidewalk and heading towards the north campus.
After they moved closer to the fire Dean spoke up, “I lead us down the wrong path, Ruby nearly fell off a cliff. She screamed and it must have heard her. We tried to set it on fire like the plan, it hurt it, but it just pissed it off. We were nearly back here when it grabbed her and took off.” Dean stared ahead into the fire, guilt all over his face lit up like the flames in front of him.
"Are you in any shape to go out there?" Benny asked with hesitation.
“So what were you thinking about just now?” Castiel asked, pulling the glass away from his lips.
Dean walked out of the ancient cultures room and wandered to the main lobby, then up the large wooden staircase.
“I don’t think so,” Sam said after a moment of thinking, “I think she said someone’s been out, maternity leave maybe?” He wasn't entirely sure but remembered how nearly half of her coworkers were pregnant when Mary threw the annual Winchester Halloween party.
"But the semester just started!" Castiel exclaimed.
Charlie stammered, "Of course I know how to work it. I don't know how to repair it, though." The changed tone in her voice caused Sam to raise an eyebrow, but before he could respond the sliding back door opened, revealing Dean, Castiel, Benny and Jack.
At that moment the boys approached them and Jo received confused looks from all three of them, making the girls laugh harder
“Well you boneheads are too damn stubborn to admit it yourselves, I was just giving you a push in the right direction.”
"Yes!" She shouted back.
“Uh, huh,” Gabe said, unconvinced. “You skip your 2 two o’clock?”
Dean unlocked the door to his room and let Sam inside, revealing his room to be the cleanest Sam had ever seen. Sam was shocked, he had met Gabe a couple times and he assumed the two living together would be an absolute disaster. Sam commented on the cleanliness of the room, earning a laugh from his older brother. “Cas is a total neat freak, he makes me keep it clean.”
"A little turbulence is all it was," Castiel said before taking another bite.
"Castiel."
Dean shrugged, “Then everyone would know.”
The four left the dining hall together and went back to Dean and Gabriel’s room to start drinking before the left for the frat house. “Will Michael be there?” Castiel asked, shaking his head, refusing a beer from his brother. Castiel was focused on rolling a few joints; one already stuffed in his pocket; and licked the wrap before rolling the paper.
“Your roommate seems weird,” Gabe said, pointing his fork at his brother.
Castiel was sitting in the Winchester’s kitchen the next morning when Dean finally got himself ready for school. “Muffin?” Cas offered Dean through a mouthful, holding out the basket of muffins Mary must have made the night before.
Dean laughed, releasing his arm and ruffling Castiel’s hair. “What fun would this be in the summer?”
Dean turned his head to gaze into Castiel’s eyes, “Just admiring the sunset, but now that you’re here,” he paused to place another soft kiss to his lips, “it looks like crap,” Dean chuckled, causing Castiel to do his hearty laugh, his head thrown back and eyes closed.
“Trust me, she wouldn’t be allowed in church choir.”
“Yes, yes it was,” Castiel said.
“I met its owner,” Castiel said with a goofy smile, knowing Gabriel would appreciate it.
“Actually, yeah. Late night.”
"Come on then," Garth waved Castiel to the left of the library entrance, in the opposite direction of the open desk. Garth led Castiel through what looked like an emergency exit but led to a stairway.
“You planning on having any fun?” Dean snickered with a mouthful and syrup dripping down his chin.
“Cute,” Sam said, “I wish I had my camera.”
“Wait, which one is Anna again?”
Dean groaned but when Sam looked at him with pleading eyes he said, “Okay, art show it is.”
"If Cassie had wanted to tell us something, then he would have. You need to chill out, we're at a party. Untwist your panties and have fun, I know Cas sure is," Gabriel said before hopping off the counter and clapping Dean on the back.
“Later,” Cas winked before wading to the stairs, eager to get food in his stomach.
“I’m proud of it, it’s the best pizza in Lawrence!”
Castiel paused for a minute, thinking. "I think I like green eyes," he said before opening the main doors and waving Dean goodnight before Dean got the chance to respond.
“Alright!” Gabriel exclaimed, “Perfect, we need you for our team!”
“Serendipity- it’s a small antique’s shop in town. Zachariah knows the owner,” he trailed off, unable to help but feel a sense of shame that he had to rely on his uncle to get him a summer job.
“Can I invite friends over too?”
Dean swung open his door, a buzzed smile on his face to greet Cas.
Hope shook her head with a laugh, "He didn’t leave with a friend from class,” before suggestively raising her eyebrows.
“When do you go back?” Ash asked eagerly, sitting at the bar top next to Dean.
“That would be nice,” Castiel’s stomach was already beginning to rumble.
As Castiel and Dean warmed up from the fire, they stripped off their jackets, hats and gloves. Soon their wet boots were kicked off and lined up in front of the fire to dry. They remained in their jeans, still wet from the snow because their bags were still at the guest cabin. At his thought of the guest cabin, Castiel said, “Maybe they were able to get to the guest cabin,” hopefully. Everyone nodded slowly, including Jack, who had a look on his face for the first time in hours that wasn’t purely worry, at least he now had something to look forward to.
“Hey, what the-” Gabriel said from the other side of the door after turning the handle and to his surprise it wouldn't open. He blinked, staring at the door for a second before he patted his pockets to find his keys. “I don’t remember locking the door,” Gabriel mumbled to himself out loud as he opened the door. He waved in the direction of Dean’s side of the room before pulling a candy bar out of his pocket and flopping onto his bed, picking up where he left off in his magazine.
“You wha’?” Benny asked, whipping his head to face Jo.
On room selection day; luckily by the time Chuck- number 94; made it to the function room where dorm sign ups were happening there were still a number of the brand new suites available. He scrawled all of their names on the paper, then scurried out of the room before one of the residents on his floor he has been avoiding could reach him to complain about her roommate.
On Halloween night the five friends made the very cold walk to the frat house, but they were certainly not alone in doing so. When they arrived the front porch was packed full of people drinking and freezing their asses off, and the inside was the same. There was barely any room to move around, this had to easily be one of the biggest parties the house had thrown.
“A friend? Really, since when is Crowley a friend?” Gabe asked.
“Yeah if someone happens to drive by at the right time,” Dean pushed.
“Dean,” she said again, causing him to turn and look at her, “if there's any,” she paused, “funny business-”
Dean stood outside for another minute staring at the parking lot where his friends just were before the silence was interrupted by a waitress assuming he would be paying his friends tabs. He sighed loudly before going back into the bar to pay the tab, unsure what the hell he was going to do next.
"Such a nerd, Castiel," Charlie joked, sticking her tongue out at him.
“I’ve heard it’s very nice, especially in comparison to this building,” Cas laughed, patting the wall.
“Dean,” Castiel said softly.
"So you're coming to the party tonight?" Gabriel interjected, ignoring Dean's constant need for sexual details.
“I didn’t know,” Cas huffed, “didn’t know you’re gay. You’re always with women,” he said.
“I’ll go with you,” Benny walked closer to her to open the coat closet, passing her a coat and then he pulled his own on. As he grabbed extra hats and mittens from a basket on the floor of the closet Dean approached and pulled his own jacket off the hook. "This ain't a 3 person job," Benny said.
Castiel gulped and held the joint out for his partner, “I think we need to talk about that,” he said softly, he felt uneasy. Cas knew Dean was very adverse to speaking about how he felt, and their relationship in general. Dean preferred to show how he felt, and upon hearing Cas said they needed to talk, he instantly went on the defense. An easy conversation never started with
On their way from their architecture class, Benny stopped dead in his tracks. “Did you really just ask me that?”
“Why are you so obsessed with this room?” Charlie asked, she had heard Gabe mention room 210 on a couple of occasions.
"You need to switch. Tell the department secretary you need a new adviser," Dean said in a rushed tone.
Gabriel stood there, arms crossed and huffed loudly. He turned to Dean and just shook his head. Dean didn’t know the whole story, but it definitely seemed like this Crowley was a shady character. Hell, anyone friends with Luke is bad news in Dean’s book.
“You’re buddies?” Gabe asked, eyebrows raised.
Dean laughed, “Man, I missed you Sammy,” he glanced over to his right, Sam’s expression had softened, noticeably happy to be back in his brothers company.
"Jo isn't coming?" Castiel asked when the three men headed towards the elevator.
Dean stopped walking, much to the dismay of the other students who were behind him, to try to identify where that voice came from. He looked around but couldn’t tell who called out, so he continued making his way to class while wondering who on earth knew he didn’t have his car. He was fuming when he made it to his first class, knowing that whoever called out to him must have been the same person who keyed the Impala. He was going to figure out who did it if it was the last thing he did. All throughout European history Dean was brainstorming who could have done this-
Dean heard Mary talking quietly into the phone, then she called from the top of the stairs, “Don't be too long, it's your friend Castiel.”
“I dunno,” he squinted his eyes as he looked up at the arts building, signaling the end to his and Dean’s walk.
“It’s not that bad, it’s been worse,” she forced a small smile. “But we’re here to have fun tonight, we will deal with him tomorrow.”
"Yes, technically-"
After school Dean briefly considered staying after and getting a ride home from mom with Sam and Cas after they finished debate club but when Andy offered him a ride he accepted- if he stayed he was only going to be sitting around for two hours waiting. The two did exactly what Dean expected them to- sit in Andy's van and smoke a joint before deciding they were hungry and making their way back to the Winchester's. Andy and Dean sat in front of the television, an empty bag of potato chips on the coffee table, Dean was half asleep when the front door opened suddenly and Sam hurried past the living room up to his bedroom. Mary and Cas entered the room and Cas sat down on the couch in between Dean and Andy, much closer to Dean than necessary.
"I'm in the GSA," she said as they got in line for sandwiches.
“We had already been fighting when I went home for the weekend so I didn’t want to see her. She was pissed I didn’t stop by,” Dean shrugged.
“No, I’m not, I’m not pretending. I’m interested in your life, in you.”
“Zachariah,” Castiel said quietly, “he and I had a spat.”
The door swung open, revealing not Jo, but a very pissed off Bela. “What the hell do you jackasses want?”
“I mean,” Dean blushed and rubbed the back of his neck, “I think it could be fun.”
“Are you sure?”
"Shit, no. Oh wait," Dean dug through his bag and found a bag of sunflower seeds, squished, clearly been in his bag a while. Castiel finally got the courage to drink the dark liquor, it seemed they would have to drink their dinner tonight unless they got hungry enough to brave the nighttime single digit temperatures. The drink warmed the two boys from inside, but Dean's fingers were starting to go numb since they had yet to start a fire.
Dean just replied with a smile and looked at his mother fondly.
“Feel like going for a walk?” Dean asked, shrugging and pushing his lips together.
“Okay, we are not having this conversation,” Dean sternly put his hands out in front of him and walked away from the car.
“Yeah, I’m starving.”
“I don’t get how people can cheat,” Charlie said, feeling bad for judging Dean for his tough and rugged exterior.
"Not exactly a club, more of a support group I guess," he shrugged.
"Castiel doesn't have his own coffee maker."
After waiting for Dean to go downstairs Cas dug around in his bag and pulled out from underneath a pile of clothes a baggie of pills. He glared at the almost empty bag, only three left, he didn’t know how he was going to make it through his time at the Winchester household, let alone winter break. Castiel gulped down one dry, and started thinking about how he was going to get more, already feeling anxious at the thought of being without something to ease his nerves. He thought maybe Dean had some pot at least, it was worth asking.
“Great, Ash and I saw Next Friday,” Dean laughed and Castiel tilted his head the way he does when he doesn’t understand something.
. Castiel smiled to himself, feeling one step closer to freedom. He couldn’t wait to tell Dean.
Gabriel was disappointed the seat was occupied for a moment before realizing his drink was almost empty and that he would have had to get back up in a few minutes to get a new one. The other seats were occupied by Lily and her friends, who Gabriel hadn't yet met.
“Cool, cool. Antiques, huh?”
TW: drug abuse and overdose
“ But if I hear or see you two in bed, you’re paying for my therapy!” Gabriel waved the joint in his brother’s general direction.
“You don’t like to party?” Sam asked, surprised, he had assumed since he spent so much time with Dean and Gabriel that he would be into the same scene as them.
"Trust me, Cas. There's no way a human could possibly look at another person that way and not be madly in love with them."
. Nope, that wouldn’t cut it. Dean only drove past two customers houses while he was lost in his thoughts, but he figured it wasn’t too bad because suddenly he was standing outside his dorm room wondering how the hell he made it back.
Moments later Dean called out “Sammy!” earning a number of glares from people viewing the art. He trotted over to his brother and boyfriend, “How’s the art?” Sam shushed Dean for talking too loudly.
Benny was either hesitant or excited, but Charlie can’t tell over text.
“Cas,” Jack said quietly, making Castiel pause as he was nearing the door, “bring my sister home.” Castiel nodded solemnly before the trio walked out into the frigid wilderness.
When they got to the elevator Dean let out a loud laugh when Castiel dropped his serious, sober facade. At Dean’s door Castiel leaned against the wall, his goofy drunk smile staring at Dean, who grinned as he unlocked the door. Dean flicked on the lights and let Cas inside, who stood staring at Dean, waiting for him to lead. When Dean kicked his shoes off, Castiel followed. Dean pulled off the plastic abdominal piece and flung it in the direction of his closet, Castiel shimmied out of the suspenders and let them hang at his side.
“Yeah, I think I will,” Dean said as Castiel stood up and brushed his jeans to straighten them out.
"You know I can't stay away long," Castiel smirked, dropping his bag to the floor as Crowley inched closer to him.
“Ash, you could learn somethin’ from him,” Bobby said, getting off a bar stool.
“I just need right now,” Dean smirked before lifting his empty glass, “and a refill.” Dean stood up to head towards the bar, leaving behind his friend. He pretended like he didn’t see her sneak a look at her phone, smiling softly to herself. Dean was truly happy for Charlie and her girlfriend Dorothy. Charlie and Dean had been best friends for decades, and over the years he felt proud to have seen her grow and become the outgoing, hilarious, computer programmer that she was- a massive transformation from the shy girl who only spoke in class when directly spoken to, hiding from everyone behind her book of the week.
