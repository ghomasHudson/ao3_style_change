“You don’t use your real name in fandom, which is completely understandable under the circumstances. I would’ve guessed already if I knew of a writer named Dean.”
Dean didn’t even need to go as far as Cas’s room. He found himself face to face with Cas right outside the kitchen door. They nearly collided, and Dean hissed as a bit of hot coffee sloshed over his knuckles. Cas blinked in shock before snatching the offending mug from Dean’s hand, leaving him free to shake the scalding liquid from his fingers.
Cas levered himself up with a groan and walked toward him. “I’ll meet you in the kitchen after I peel this day off my skin.”
“Wooing us?” Dean replied over lunch on Thursday when Cas had reached the end of his rope with Daphne. “What, are we living in a Jane Austen novel now?”
Cas half expects Dean to ask him to turn over, or to move to a better position when he pulls his fingers out, but he just reaches for the lube again, slicking up his cock before lifting Cas’s legs, pushing them apart, and lining himself up.
“Are you that troubled by a potential schedule change? I know you’re happy with our current routine. I haven’t really known you very long, but from how well you’ve settled in here and what I’ve observed of you at work, you also seem to adapt well to change.”
Cas nods as Gabriel strolls over to his side and examines Sam. Cas takes a look at Gabriel and introduces them to one another.
He’d done it again, he thought to himself with a frustrated sigh as he unwound the towel and got dressed.
“So what do you think Ed’s been up to. We haven’t seen him in at least five or six years now. You think he’s still Ghostfacing?”
“Dude, you still work at a hospital. There’ll be another sanctimonious jackwad waiting to take his place before the big cushy chair in his office has time to cool off.”
After a tense minute or two, when Cas still hadn’t opened his eyes, Dean’s patience finally broke. He very gently lifted his free arm and draped it around Cas’s waist. He figured it was only fair. If Cas could koala hug him in his sleep then he’d at least earned that much in return. Dean sensed the change in Cas instantly, just before he very slowly turned his head and lifted his eyes from Dean’s shoulder, like a character in a horror movie about to discover the monster is right behind them. He tried to maintain a relaxed smile on his face, but Dean feared that his own anxiety might be ruining the comfortable serenity he was hoping to project. Rather than upset or embarrassment, Cas blinked up at him in sleepy confusion.
After a beat, Cas continued answering Ed’s original question. “The only other time we’ve used this spell, Rowena used it to trap damned souls that had escaped from Hell.”
“We went over his stockpile this morning,” Sam replied, “and he’s prepared for just about anything.”
Ed sighed, set his beer down, stood up and took off his jacket. “Look, I get it. I was a douche. I was everything a hunter isn’t. But I’ve had plenty of time to grow up here, and I’m not that guy anymore.”
Sam shrugged and conceded the point. “The real CDC probably wouldn’t be interested since they already ruled out a traditional poison or infection, but we could say we’re researching the unusual phenomenon and see if that stirs anything up. Probably less confrontational than going into a town as FBI when people are already bending over backwards to confess their sins, or whatever.”
“It’s not an intrusion, Cas. Like I said, you’re not the first resident I’ve had this little chat with. After Vince, I got the guest room all set up. I like to think of it as the emergency escape pod from the SS Lucifer. And that ship is about to go down in flames. Might wanna jump while the gettin’s good.”
Wulf patiently finished his examination and carefully set the last stone back in the bowl. He gave Cas a grateful nod and then turned to Lorna, dropping the illusion that he was a mild-mannered guy in a turtleneck with an interest in spooky stuff and proving exactly who and what he was to her.
He froze for a second after the words had escaped into the wild, and then slowly turned to take in the fond look on Cas’s face.
Cas had arrived to work early, knowing he had a lot to do to get the library ready for the school year, but also that the first day back tended to be a social event as much as a work event. He was fully prepared for everyone in the building to pop in at some point to ask how his summer had been, or just to get a change of scenery from the chaos of setting up their classrooms. By lunchtime, he’d labeled and set up several hundred new books in the computer system, and exchanged pleasantries with the majority of the teachers. On the up side, Donna had spent half an hour helping him sort through the new shipment of books while she’d talked his ear off about her summer road trip. It had passed the time in a more pleasant way than he’d expected, and it had also probably been the most productive half hour of his day, thanks to her.
Announcement. He took a deep breath and opened it to see who he’d be paired with, and punched the air in excitement. He knew this artist’s work, their unique and ethereal shadowbox designs perfectly suited to his story, and couldn’t wait to get to work with them. He shot off a quick email to them to introduce himself, thank the artist for choosing his story, and forward a link to his fic for them to begin reading.
It didn’t help his case that the stranger had set off every warning bell Melanie had, from the skeevy air of desperation about him to his refusal to accept a simple
He sends a text to Pamela updating her on Cas’s current location, and she calls back within a minute and asks to speak with him. Dean puts it on speaker and sets the phone on the sofa between them.
“Yeah, mine’s a hard top, four door. And a 67, not a 65. I dig the convertible, but I wouldn’t trade my baby for--”
Dean stared back at him, internalizing the calm certainty Cas seemed to be projecting directly into his soul. Even without his grace, Cas still had the unsettling ability to gaze directly into his core and see him for exactly who he was. He was relieved that it hadn’t been just an angel thing, that it was a Cas thing, and he hoped like hell what he was seeing in Cas was as accurate as what Cas seemed to see in him. Dean shuddered, licked his lips, and watched as Cas’s eyes flicked down to take in the movement. That settled things. He dredged up every last bit of his courage.
When Dean finally gave up on sleep and rolled out of bed, he still had a few hours before he was scheduled to meet up with Feathers on Discord, but that didn’t stop Dean from hauling his laptop to the kitchen while he brewed a pot of coffee. He stood at the counter and reread their entire conversation from the night before, attempting to tease every last drop of nuance from what they’d each written. It left him feeling even more confused and frustrated than he’d been before. He was so focused on reading that he nearly missed the notification when Charlie messaged him.
Cas had refused to let Dean drive back to the bunker with his bruised shoulder, at least not until he got some proper rest. He insisted on driving to the nearest motel, and made Dean wait in the car while he checked them in. He spent the next half hour fully examining Dean’s injuries and worrying over him as if Dean’s life depended on his constant concentration. That’s how they ended up having a very, very long talk in a quiet motel room in the middle of bumfuck nowhere.
He frowned at himself as his knees started hurting from the awkward crouch, and let himself drop to the floor, pushing backward until his back hit the side of his bed. He stretched out his aching knees and rested his head back against the mattress. If he closed his eyes, he didn’t even need to be able to see the photograph to remember every detail of it.
“Yeah, well,” Dean said, shrugging it off. “I’m not. She met a great guy later that year. Dude who’d already graduated from med school and set up private practice.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I — I didn’t want you to feel this way. I didn’t want it to be like this,” said Mary.
The machines were beeping and humming all around them. It was a quiet comfort, being in the room with Naomi had unnerved him. Watching Dean battle Leviathans, seeing him confront his brothers and all matter of supernatural beings taught him a thing or two about courage and the strength it took to face his fears. He could do that.
His voice broke. Crowley, now concerned, stopped pacing entirely, and stared at the angel, waiting for him to finish.
Jimmy had said angelic possession was like being chained to a comet. Dean could only wonder if that meant Castiel was lightning in a bottle. But what if he was the June bug trapped in a jar?
Mary reached for his hand. “I knew, from the moment I saw the two of you hug in the library. And he’s told me all about you on our hunts. You have my blessing,” she said.
He flipped through the journal and read a passage from Dean’s adolescence. Dean had been caught stealing and had been sent to a boys’ home. John hadn’t come for him, and Dean had settled into the place.
“Don’t lecture. Besides, I don’t recommend it. Last time you drank a whole liquor store,” said Dean. There was no need to recount the incident. It played in both their minds.
She put her hands back in her pockets. “I took your father’s journal. I’ve been chasing some loose ends. I prayed to Castiel for assistance and he showed. I asked him to keep it between us, just until I was ready to face you and your brother,” she said.
He sighed, put down the knife he had been using, and wiped the blood from his hands using a dirty rag.
Standing there, with her hair pulled back into a ponytail and swimming in Sam’s zip-up hoodie, she looked so young. She was so young, Castiel corrected. Dean had been older than her when he sacrificed himself for Sam. Castiel had said as much to her the night before, but in the dark, she had looked as world-weary as her eldest son. Then, she had seemed more the age she should be than the one she appeared.
Patience was left without a grandmother. And so, the cycle continued. John had dragged his sons into his war, and Dean had been a soldier a long, long time. He had been daddy’s blunt instrument. He had been Alastair’s star pupil in Hell. He was tired. Tired of losing, tired of forfeiting his dreams, of giving up his soul, of languishing in the dirt.
“I – I don’t remember when I first read it, or where I got this copy, but I’ve read them several times, and I… I think you would enjoy them.”
Dean didn’t mince his words. He read smoothly, and Castiel let the words fill the space between them. Castiel knew Dean had been reading to Sam since they were young. And to this day, he read for fun. And when he read aloud, he was reading for Castiel’s pleasure. And oh, how he loved hearing him, loved seeing him with a book in his hands. He held it tenderly as if it held secrets. And maybe, it did.
Sam was sitting in the corner skimming the document on his phone. They’d been discussing their plan since the nurse left half an hour ago. It was getting late and they would soon be asked to leave.
He didn’t have it in him to cry, but he wanted to, desperately. Dry, heaving sobs that would leave him clutching Baby’s wheel with no direction. He’d lost him, his baby brother, his Sammy. The one he held, all bundled up, when their home — the only one they’d ever known — went up in flames. Sam, who grew up to be smarter and taller than he was, but just as stubborn. And what good had that done?
“Gimme a sec,” said Dean, taking another drag before putting it out with the heel of his boot. He walked over and unlocked the trunk. He caught Dean’s hesitation when he saw Sam’s duffel bag but made no mention of it. Dean tossed his over his shoulder and locked the trunk.
“Thought he showered last night,” said Sam. He placed Dean and Castiel’s coffees on the table, along with the box of donuts, next to the book Castiel had been reading.
“Yeah, but he’s not as strong as he once was, and he can’t fly. He hates — hated — that,” said Dean.
To her, these would be but words on a page. Yet, these were their memories. They weren’t just events recounted for posterity.
Other nights, Castiel would tell him about the world. The first seas, the first mammals, the early cities. He would tell him about heaven. The other angels in his garrison and all the ways in which he had failed. And on those nights, Dean would console him.
“He paid me the most attention, but never the right attention. I did all sorts of things right under his nose and got away with them, and then there were other times... Well, I wasn't so lucky those times."
And in that moment, Dean had felt such unadulterated rage. Who wore white to a death match? A fallen archangel hellbent on destruction, that’s who. And Dean didn’t have the heart to tell his brother he never wanted to see him wear white, not even on his wedding day. Not that he thought he had any say in the matter.
Dean knew these entries by heart, so what would reading them once more accomplish? Castiel voiced his frustrations more than once but was met with resistance. Even though Sam had stopped reading them, Dean would insist. And so late at night, he would read in the car while Sam slept.
When Castiel entered, Dean was cleaning his guns. It was therapeutic. Something he could do and could do well. He didn’t have to think about it, didn’t have to weigh his options.
He moved away before Jody could reach for him. And he didn’t get a good look at Patience’s face, but there was disbelief. Probably didn’t think he could love a man. Dean, certainly, hadn’t thought he could.
He slid into the driver’s seat. She closed the door behind him, and she walked around to the passenger’s side door. He had opened it from the inside, and she slid in.
Dean nodded. There was more he could say, more he should say, but he didn’t want to open that can of worms. Castiel didn’t get the memo and put a hand on his thigh. Dean threw back his head. Angels, his mother always said. The angels were looking out for him, but he knew better than that. He knew it was just the one. Just the one angel with his hand on his thigh, rubbing small circles around his knee. Just the one angel that always managed to leave him open, exposed.
Castiel didn’t speak, just nodded. He caressed Dean’s cheek and as he did, Dean closed his eyes, leaning into the touch. He felt that distant thrumming again. The pulsing light that had been his only source of hope mere moments ago.
“You don’t think I tried that? You don’t — you don’t seriously think I would just leave him in that state?”
. Dean did, of course. But Dean had been looking for a home all his life. Of course, he would latch onto the first permanent home he’d had since his went up in flames.
Dean wouldn’t have wanted Mary to know what their lives had been like. He would’ve said ignorance is bliss.
"Castiel saved me. He saved me from hell, he saved me from myself. I don't think there's anything I could ever do that could even come close to matching what Cas did for me that day.”
That very monster had shattered the driver’s side window. The window was a pain in the ass to replace, so he opted to do that first, but then reconsidered. He had to get his priorities in order. She hadn’t wanted to start, so he decided to pop the hood, and check her out. Even if the engine needed replacing, he had done it a hundred times before. Wasn’t anything he couldn’t do with his eyes closed.
They returned to their room and Dean made Castiel forget the conversation he and Mary had been having. Though her words reverberated.
After some time, he took off his jacket and tossed it onto the back seat. He rolled up the sleeve of his undershirt and placed his other hand on his exposed shoulder.
They let their hands roam, exploring every inch of each other’s bodies. Dean was shy, only taking what was offered, and not asking for anything in return. But Castiel coaxed him into asking for what he wanted. Greedily, he wanted to give him all.
He squeezed the excess soap and water, letting it drip down his fingers, and returned the sponge to its resting place. He put the mug on the dish rack and let it air dry.
Castiel sat next to him. Having been human had made things easier between them. What had once been difficult or impossible to explain had come to make more sense to the angel. He understood the wave of emotions that could wash over you. He understood carnal desires. He understood the simplicity of a good nap. He understood more about Dean than he cared to uncover now.
“Okay, man. Whatever you say,” said Sam, taking back the box and placing it on the empty seat next to him in the back.
Once they were back inside, Mary resumed her conversation with Jody. And when Mary asked Jody if she knew about Dean and the angel, Jody couldn’t help but smile. “I had my suspicions. I mean, we all do. But no, I didn’t know,” she said.
He wasn’t the one who prayed and had faith. He wasn’t the one who read the Bible and knew the names of all the angels.
When Castiel looked over, Dean was eyeing him. He couldn’t read the expression on his face. There was something he wasn’t saying. He would have to read to find out. He could do that. He would finish it by morning.
He reached for Dean’s hand. Sam would be back soon. He was giving them time, that much was clear, but they didn’t have very long. And he needed to say this before he ran out of time.
“If you fucking say you’re sorry, I’ll never forgive you,” said Dean. He was still resting his head on his arm.
In the car, Dean fiddled with the car’s stereo. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want Jody to ask invasive questions.
“We were back in Lebanon. We went back to our house, for a case. The new owner, she told me she had found these pictures of us — all of us. She asked me if I wanted them. Of course, I wanted them, so I took them, and I’ve been — I’ve been holding onto them since.”
Once Lucifer tired of his vessel — and he would, for the angels loathed containment — he would leave. See, angels weren’t made for the flesh. They were ethereal. Existing as they always had, unchanged and unmoved. Time and earth and life changed around them, but not the angels. They observed, interfered when commanded, but otherwise, existed seemingly unperturbed.
And he’d pray — one of the rare times — that when the adrenaline wore off, he’d be able to sleep. For the allure of sleep was that he could wake up at any time and whatever nightmare he was in would come to an end.
Didn’t she understand? No… No, she didn’t. The future is still new to her, this is all still new to her. How do I tell her all that’s happened, all that’s changed, when so much is still the same, and seemingly unchanging?
Soon, Dean found himself in Castiel’s lap. Relishing in the opportunity to do as he wished, Castiel ran his hands up and along Dean’s spine. He was tense. Kneading the muscle, Dean relaxed and melted into his touch. And when he started moaning, Castiel knew he would never tire of hearing Dean make those sounds.
Cas nodded and shut the laptop. As Dean made his way out to the hall, he heard Cas mutter quietly, “Happy Resurrection Day,” as if he was testing out the sentiment. He bit his lip to keep from laughing out loud.
The apartment was technically furnished, but in the same style of hospital waiting room chic that the downstairs lobby had sported. The small kitchen would be serviceable enough when they’d likely be eating most of their meals in the hospital cafeteria anyway. A resident’s schedule didn’t really leave a lot of time for gourmet cooking. Dean still intended to try, at least. Even a rushed homemade meal was better than yet another prepackaged sandwich, if he could swing it.
“I drove out past the the little tourist park they have at the geographical center, and there’s not really a lot out there. It’s a blink and you’ll miss it stone monument out in the middle of a huge field, with a picnic shelter, a flag pole, and a shed.”
Pamela snorts. “I know, grumpy. It’s like destiny keeps trying to bring us all together. Who am I to fight destiny?”
Dean shrugged, letting Cas get comfortable before settling his arm around his waist and pulling him in closer. “I’d be happy just staying here like this.”
Dean cracks open his beer and tosses the cap in the trash, takes a swig and sighs. Sam gives him a nod and a distracted smile, then shuffles his papers around enough to make room for his glass and sets to work on his salad while continuing to pour over his notes. Dean’s natural instincts are screaming at him to help, to be useful, to keep Sam company or take care of him, but Sam clearly doesn’t need his help. He’s just a distraction, so the best way he can take care of Sam is to leave him in peace.
“Do you want to leave?” Jack asked, at Amara’s prodding. “I mean, it still does need to be your choice. But nobody else will have to suffer or die or pay a price for it.”
. It only lasted a few seconds before it was blown away by the return of the angst. At least Sam knew how to bear up under that particular feeling, and used the reprieve to hurry through the bunker to find Dean. He wasn’t sure he’d survive another round through the emotional whiplash machine Dean and Cas were generating.
Impala’s response had rattled him for a moment when Cas had asked what he planned to write next. If Dean hadn’t talked about a story idea set at an airport the day before, Impala’s fic idea would’ve piqued his interest, but Impala described an entirely different fic idea
Jack shrugged. “Rowena, first off. We told her to take a few days adjusting before giving you and Sam a call. And Mary. She asked to be dropped in Wisconsin, and will be driving home tomorrow.” He frowned again, and then gave Dean pleading eyes. “I think she wanted it to be a surprise, so try to act like you didn’t know when she gets here.”
Dean yawned and finally seemed to relax. Cas wondered if Dean took comfort from his presence as well, but this was definitely not the right time to ask. Instead he yawned himself, and then wished Dean good night.
Eventually Dean drags Cas back to the shower in what already feels like a comfortable routine. After insisting that Cas at least put on some pants before wandering out to the kitchen, and kinda hating himself for pushing the issue, they head out to make coffee and breakfast. They’re just finishing up their pancakes when the back door to the shop opens and closes, and Sam loudly announces his imminent entry.
“You know, I think you probably need some tending to, also,” Dean says. When Cas glances up at him with a confused little knit in his brow, he points at Cas’s chest. “Tattoo? You should probably clean and moisturize it. It’s been a while.”
“Let me know when you’re up for breakfast,” Dean said, before reconsidering. “Or lunch, even. I was planning to leave it up to you anyway. Maybe we need to do something a little bit celebratory.”
“Hi, Rowena,” he said, choking out a laugh as he heard Dean finally join Cas at their table. At least Dean wasn’t being a jerk about it. “I, uh, kinda got myself in a bit of trouble, and I think I need you to save me from Dean and Cas.”
After they ate, Dean sat in the kitchen sipping a cup of tea Cas made him while Cas washed the dishes. It had taken a bit of effort, but their conversation eventually found its familiar and comfortable pace again, and Dean’s little breakdown slipped into the back of his mind. By the time they turned in for the night, everything felt at least as back to normal as a friendship of eight days could possibly feel.
He shifted in his seat and looked anywhere but at Dean. “I’m not particularly familiar with vehicle makes and models, outside of 1967 Mustangs.”
Dean made it work with a combination of business sense learned from his Uncle Bobby at his garage and his Aunt Ellen at her bar, on top of everything he’d learned from Mick about tattooing and running his shop, The Men of Letters, and his own natural charm. Almost seven years later, not only is Dean a well respected and well known artist, but business is booming. Which brings him back to the piece currently demanding his attention.
Jack and Amara glanced at one another, and Jack shrugged. “We were hoping we could come inside. It’s been kind of a long day.”
Cas takes a huge breath and blows it out. “I feel exponentially better than I did an hour ago, thanks to your company. I appreciate that, Dean. But you’re right. I came here hoping for shelter and safety, and you provided that admirably, but I think you might be able to help.”
Cas laughed outright at that, until he was finally able to talk again, words coming between gasps of laughter. “That’s exactly what Balthazar called it when he said he couldn’t picture me driving anything else.”
have real, in person relationships with any number of them, too. He just hadn’t worked up the courage to do it yet.
“We should probably give Jody and Donna the heads up, unless you’ve already shared this with them?” Cas asked.
Dean nodded. “We’re gonna do it right this time, though. I’ve been waiting too long to let this go.”
“Well, that’s a good way to wake up,” Dean says eventually, when they’ve begun to catch their breath. “I think I like this list of yours.”
It was Sam who broke up their reunion, but Dean completely understood the moment he managed to get his question out.
When Impala signed off for the night, with no hope of chatting with him again until after claims, Cas shut his laptop. His will and drive to write had evaporated. He sat there, staring at the wall, wondering where he’d gone wrong. He’d been so careful in letting his relationship with Dean grow naturally, and they’d been spending so much time together that Cas had trusted in the solidity of his feelings for him. Neither of them had talked about what the future might hold for them, or mentioned any interest in relabeling their regular outings as dates, or discussed the potential for more than friendship between them. Now Cas had to wonder why that was.
“I mean would I have to spend the rest of the weekend camped out on Jody and Donna’s sofa while I look for a new place to live…”
He delivers instructions to Emma as he wraps her foot in a lime green bandage. “Now you’ll have to be very careful for a couple weeks. No climbing on the dining room table, for starters.”
He turned on the tap and watched the water run for a moment, and then leaned his hands on the sink to examine his tired face in the mirror. Two long days in the car exhausted him now that he was human, and he wasn’t at all sure he’d be able to get a restful night’s sleep sharing a bed with Dean. It didn’t bode well for his ability to focus during this case, when so much of his concentration would necessarily be directed into making sure he wasn’t succumbing to the honesty curse they’d come here to break.
“How the fuck did this many shady fuckers get this much power over the lives and deaths of every patient who walks through our doors?” Dean asked as they sat back to admire their work.
Rowena gave him an inviting and flirtatious smile and shrugged as Dean answered. Sam made a split second decision.
. Dean wondered what it was about casually rumpled librarians that totally did it for him, and accepted the fact he hadn’t even spoken an intelligent word to Cas yet and was already half gone on the guy. He shook his head and remembered where he was and what he’d been doing, reminding himself that randomly hitting on coworkers on his first day was the worst of all possible choices, and settled for attempting a coherent sentence first.
There was another long pause, and Dean began to wonder if Feathers had gone back to writing, if their conversation was over for now. Feathers surprised him again.
Dean stopped at the edge of a stack of moldering crates and peeked around the corner. They had their flashlights at the ready, but so far there’d been just enough sodium orange glow spilling through those broken windows from the nearby streetlights that they hadn’t needed to use them. If they could manage to find the djinn’s pantry before it realized a couple of hunters were closing in on it, they stood a much better chance of saving two missing women. Only they were running out of nooks and crannies in the vast complex where it could still be hiding. Time was not on their side, with the snow picking up and the temperature dropping.
Dean shook his head. “Nah, this is awesome. But the day I met you, I told Charlie about the hot librarian at school, and she might be writing a fanfic about us… or at least based on us. Maybe I need to tell her to stop. I don’t know if I actually want to read fanfic about us now.”
“You know I’ve been worried sick about you all night. You totally ghosted on the server and weren’t even replying to my messages. Before I left this morning, I actually sent you my phone number and asked you to text me to make sure you were okay. I didn’t know if you were pissed at me for going out yesterday, or if you were in the hospital, or worse…”
“You make it sound like a foregone conclusion,” Cas replies, standing up and nudging Dean out of the way at the sink to take over washing the dishes. Dean tries to protest, but Cas levels him with a glare and Dean relents, picking up a dish towel and taking over drying duties. “I’m not sure I can muster that level of confidence. You don’t know Nick. Billie’s been trying to get rid of him for years, but he always manages to slither away unscathed.”
Cas leaned out far enough to check the hallway in the other direction before dropping his voice just above a whisper.
They spent longer shopping than Cas typically would have, but he reminded himself that he didn’t have anywhere else to be, and nothing pressing to attend to. He couldn’t remember having that much fun in a grocery store, either, and by the time they were ready to check out, his cheeks ached from smiling at Dean’s antics and running commentary. Once again, Cas was left with the strange sensation of loss as they wheeled their purchases out to their cars. Dean stopped for just a moment when they’d reached Cas’s truck, as he loaded his bags into the bed.
Dean shrugged. “Sam already said it. We let you in the front door. We were pretty much committed to this the second I texted you our address. So what’s the plan?”
It felt silly to have such strong sentimental feelings for a bunch of old posters. They weren’t the kind of things most adults would consider high art, or the kinds of things people generally aspired to decorate their houses around. Relics of college dorms and first apartments before regular people saved up enough to buy decent art, more like. But to Dean, each of those posters-- like the music they advertised--defined a part of his life. For so many years, living the itinerant lifestyle his father had dragged him through, music became one of the only constants he could rely on. It had grounded him and molded him, defined him and helped him learn to define himself. Even if nobody else ever understood, it was important to Dean.
The pieces began falling into place, even if he still couldn’t see the whole puzzle. “The shock wave. That was you two?”
Dean nods back. “If you don’t need anything else, I’m gonna turn in. Maybe draw for a bit. You’re probably gonna want a ride in the morning, right?”
“Speaking of help, I was wondering about your policy on checking books out to staff. I like to keep a rotating selection of books in my office. Never know when I’ll need to keep a fidgety kid occupied.”
Cas shot her a reply to that effect, and Jody’s texts subsided with a “Well, thank fuck for that, my fingers were starting to cramp from trying to get it all down.”
“To Cas, From Dean,” Cas read off the label. “This one is from you, Dean. I should be the one apologizing. I thought I slept through all your hard work. I appreciate you trying to surprise me, but I would’ve gladly helped.”
Dean huffed out a laugh and stood up, picking up the journal with the list of necessary spell ingredients. “Yeah, you just want to recruit them for your storage room organization project.” Sam tilted his head from side to side in concession as Dean began gathering ingredients and equipment. “But yeah, we’ll issue engraved invitations in the morning. Be nice to have everyone get together for something other than the end of the world for once.”
“What a delightful impression we’ve already managed to make for our new interns,” Dr. Fey said, smiling at the bewildered faces of the four of them standing there.
Lorna gave him a resigned nod and steeled herself for whatever would happen next. Sam went to stand by Dean, hopefully out of the direct line of fire of whatever was about to come pouring out of the soul catcher stones, and the two of them watched as Cas and Wulf began the spell. Cas chanted the incantation and poured the potion over the stones in the bowl, and Wulf watched on with his hands held out to either side of the bowl, as if he were holding a much larger invisible bowl. Or like he could catch all the freed souls in his hands before they could slip away. He was a reaper, so maybe that wasn’t too far fetched a notion.
“Where would you like to go?” he asked, leaving every bit of her decision in her hands. “Sam and Dean are still on the road, and I’m not sure they’re going to be back at the bunker tonight. They’re close, but they’ve been, ah, temporarily diverted to visit a friend…”
“Relax, angel,” Pamela tells him. “One question at a time, and no reason to panic. Billie knows everything that’s going on. She’s taken you off the call rotation until after this is all cleared up. The only thing you have to worry about is showing up for your M&M at eleven. I’ll be at the hospital, too, along with a plainclothes detective just in case there’s any funny business. You won’t need your phone until after that. And Charlie’s working on fixing it so it’ll be perfectly safe again. No more GPS hacks.”
From above the dividing wall between the bedrooms, which Dean only just now realized didn’t go all the way to the high peaked ceiling, Sam called back, “It was either this or all four of us can sleep in the car. That option is still available if you’re gonna complain.”
He added the stack of notes to the pile he’d already collected in his sock drawer. Dean wasn’t entirely sure why he was hanging on to them. They weren’t really anything important or anything he needed to keep for future reference. He still couldn’t bring himself to throw them out.
“I regret that I drank as much as I did, I regret that the closest bathroom to the Dean Cave is annoyingly far away, I regret that I was too drunk to find my way back to you, and I regret that you had to wake up alone and doubted everything about last night yourself.”
“Are you prepared to deliver your speech?” Cas asked, sitting up straighter. “I never did provide a practice audience for you.”
Dean nodded, shifted uneasily in his seat and went back to picking at his beer label. “They had a long damn time to make memories together. Some people don’t get near that long.”
“My last rotation in Baltimore was in pediatrics, and one of the residents there fashioned himself a comedian. I heard that one at least three times a week.” He gave Dean a level look. “The two of you must’ve read the same joke book.”
Dean nodded, grateful that he didn’t have to explain where he was coming from here. “Yeah, but like… living here with you has felt like a weirdly stable situation, you know? When we signed up for this,” he said, holding his hands out and sweeping them around their living room, “We understood we’d sort of be stuck with each other, long before we actually knew each other. That’s a sort of stability all on its own, but then I met you and like… well, I like to think we get along pretty fucking well…” he added, trailing off and hoping he didn’t sound like a complete idiot.
The opposite, actually. I got two tickets to the Brewery Crawl tomorrow afternoon, and I thought you might want an excuse to get out of the house.
“Hi, mom,” Jack said, and Kelly turned to him, the illusion of Heaven shattering even before she fully faced him.
They’ve been texting back and forth for hours, and it’s long after midnight before the pace of their back and forth begins to slow. Dean had shared the broad strokes of his history, how he ended up moving from Kansas and opening a tattoo parlor when Sam was accepted to Stanford. Cas had shared the relatively boring tale of growing up in a large family and escaping to college and the nonstop bustle of working in a hospital. Where Dean and Sam had grown up essentially on their own with the support of an unconventional extended family, Cas had always felt alone surrounded by relatives who preferred their children neither seen nor heard. Their lives had been so vastly different, and yet for all those differences, they seem to get each other on a level Cas has never experienced.
Jody and Donna both smile encouragingly, and Donna makes a shooing motion with her hands. It’s the last thing he really registers until he’s pushing his way through the door of the coffee shop and finally sees Sam. He’s hunched over the table closest to the front door, a plastic bag filled with ice pressed to his shoulder, looking like a slightly drowned and muddy rat. The tiny redhead seated across from him seems to be holding his phone hostage, but she looks both concerned and a little bit guilty.
Dean didn’t answer, just kept focused on finishing with Cas’s wounds. One shoulder ticked up nearly imperceptibly, though, and Cas took it as confirmation. The second Dean was done and had replaced the cap on the ointment, Cas rounded on him with a glare.
“It would seem that way, yes,” Crowley said. “But I’m dying to know how you managed to get your little paws on some of that dirt.”
. It was honestly more than Dean could process, but the one thing he knew for sure was that he would not let this opportunity pass unremarked upon. He grabbed Cas by the waist and pulled him in close. Cas stumbled against him, nearly dislodging his precariously wrapped towel and stiffening  in Dean’s hold.
Dean nods, resisting the urge to rut against Cas’s slick, soapy skin and handing Cas a bottle of shampoo. “Here. Keep your hands busy for a minute before I end up with my face pressed against the tiles begging you to fuck me.”
“You sent us that video,” Sam pointed out. “You suspected they were faking the hauntings with borrowed ghosts or death echoes. Not being legitimately haunted hasn’t stopped them from finding a way to bring in real ghosts.”
“You sure you’re good, Sam? Not about to melt down into a puddle of goo we’re gonna have to scoop into a bucket to carry you home?”
“Hey, hey,” Dean had said, his demeanor shifting instantly into his calmest bedside manner, reaching into the fridge. “You want a beer? Pizza should be here any minute.”
“I had initially intended to call you this evening, but the last twenty four hours have been unexpectedly trying,” Cas says.
“You’re not a demon,” Cas said plainly, picking up on Wulf’s urgency and not beating around the bush. “And I know you’re not human.”
It also felt in his best interest to be awake and rational by a reasonable time to take Cas up on his offer of dinner and conversation later. While he dug through his duffel for some clean sweats to change into, he thought back over his entire morning since he’d met Cas. The hours before that were sort of a blur now, which wasn’t surprising since
And the questions had officially grown harder. “Why does anyone want to work with young children? I’m sure you have your reasons as well.”
“Hey,” Gabriel says with a smirk, “If we play our cards right, it’ll mean we’ve got two spies behind enemy lines. They’re both smart, capable people. Hopefully they won’t let Nick get to them.”
In the end, Sam’s wish to stay on the outskirts of town won out, for several reasons. First off, there wasn’t a motel around for at least fifty miles in any direction. Most of the people who vacationed in that part of the state either owned their own lakefront property, or else stayed at one of the numerous campgrounds that littered the region. And the vast majority of them had been closed up for the season.
Dean could’ve sat anywhere in that auditorium. Or he could’ve just stood along one of the walls like a handful of other residents had chosen to do. He had been sitting for near on twenty four hours at that point, and standing would’ve at least forced him to stay awake through that ordeal, but no. He’d wandered past several dozen available seats before randomly picking the one next to Cas. And then Cas had decided to talk to the exhausted, rumpled and slightly disgruntled dude who’d slumped down in the seat next to him.
“Yeah, you do that,” Dean choked out, fingers finally closing around the towel hanging from the oven door.
“What, really? I… I mean… yeah,” Dean manages to get out as Cas’s arms wind around his waist. “Yeah, I think I might, too. Love you, that is.”
“Well, I think you’ve got three choices, then. Either you’re willing to take a risk with both of them, drop the pretense and just give them both the full Dean Winchester Experience.”
He started with the basics. After running through a general summary of major catastrophes and minor apocalypses, he explained how they’d found the bunker and then segued into the Men of Letters saga, Cliff’s Notes version. He gave a quick primer on Jack, and finally got around to Chuck and Amara and the Empty, and how all that eventually shook out, while Ed nodded along, asking a few questions here and there, but mostly just sitting there blinking and trying to absorb the insanity that had been their lives. Sam eventually glanced at the clock and realized he’d been talking nonstop for nearly an hour.
“Is there anything else you need?” Cas asked, pointing at the trunk. “I’m happy to help carry something.”
, the other man called him-- doesn’t need much help walking. Bending, twisting, and even standing up straight do pose significant challenges, and his steps are careful and measured to minimize his pain, but at least he’s able to remain on his feet as he shuffles through to the reception desk. After a quick visual inspection, noting his soaked clothing and the patch of light mud down the man’s back and side, and the way he’s holding his injured arm, Cas assumes he’s been the victim of a fall.
The only fandom friend he knew was in the area was Charlie. She’d taken him under her wing years ago when he’d first started watching Unnatural. She’d introduced him to fanfiction and the wider community, and had been one of the very few people he’d interacted with in fandom who even knew his real identity, let alone where he lived.
“Claire’s gonna be there, too. She met someone in the psychology class she took last semester, and she’s coming in to get a sigil tattoo Claire designed for her. Supposed to give you pleasant dreams.”
Every time Dean became flustered or ran away, Cas’s heart broke just a little bit more. Short of explaining to Dean why he’d resorted to these measures, he was at a total loss. And explaining the
“Where do you want it?” Dean asks, while he prepares the stencil transfer and sets up his tray of tools and inks.
“You’re not wrong there, buddy,” Gabriel replies, leading them back to his car. “So, last chance, do you need anything from home for tonight? I got a spare toothbrush and a drawer full of scrubs if you need a change of clothes for work tomorrow.”
Dean shakes his head. “Nah, Sam’s out on a date. I don’t know when he’ll be back, but you’re more than welcome to wait down here and keep us company,” he says, hooking a thumb over his shoulder at his client. She seems keen on the idea, anyway. “Or you can go hang out upstairs.”
Dean frowns at him for a second before remembering their brief conversation at the car dealership the day before. He raises one eyebrow and asks, “Oh, is this the thing you were talking with Cas’s buddy about?”
Dean had girded himself against several possible outcomes for when Cas realized he was snuffling against Dean and not into an inanimate pillow. Worst-case scenario, Cas would be mortified and upset with himself, and Dean was ready with assurances that he was fine, no harm done. More than fine, in fact, but he’d wait to see Cas’s reaction before deciding if that was something he’d share with Cas.
“Imagine being married to someone for 67 years,” Dean said, picking at the label of his beer bottle, the contents long since gone warm and flat. He finally looked up at Cas. “67 years, and then not having any idea how to let go of that life, even after the person you loved that much is gone.”
Dean made to toss the ball to Ed and hesitated. As far off down th road as he could see-- which was pretty damn far out on the open prairie-- another vehicle was slowly approaching. He lined up his throw and released the ball, sending it spiraling right into Ed’s outstretched hands, and then gave Sam a significant nod. A big black camper crept its way toward the park, and Dean gave it even odds on being their guys.
Kelly and Mary both stared at him for a moment before exchanging a wary glance with one another. When neither of them replied immediately, Jack pressed on.
An absolutely radiant looking woman with flowing dark brown hair casually curled over her shoulder was ushered in by a tall older gentleman waving her through like some sort of squire making way for his queen. She laughed as she turned back and saw his silly little bow, and shook her head.
Dean sat in the car for another minute until Sam made it inside the diner, and then followed behind them slowly as a waitress led Sam and Cas to a table. He swung by the table, told them to order him a bacon cheeseburger with extra onions, and then headed to the men’s room. Sam assumed he was just going there to sulk in private for a few minutes, and was disappointed that he’d been right.
would know what demon black eyes even were. Dean eventually blew out a breath, shrugged, and then acted as their spokesman.
“It’s like I’m walking around with a piece missing that only he can fill. I kinda think everyone knows people who just drain you, you know? Who make existing more difficult just because they exist. And then there’s people who you can hang out with that are just comfortable. People who don’t make anything harder, maybe even make it all a little better. Companionable, I guess you call them. But Cas…”
“Sometimes I think I’m lucky I don’t really have much family to speak of…” Cas muttered trailing off and staring into the middle distance. “I don’t think I could keep up that sort of commute.”
In all honesty, Cas didn’t want to call out. He’d told Impala that he had an appointment that would keep him from being able to edit on his lunch break. He only felt a little guilty that he’d made it sound like it was a work obligation or a business lunch. For all his instinctive reservations over sharing his life history with people he’d only just met, Cas was looking forward to his promised conversation with Dean. If nothing else, that would be the one guaranteed bright spot in his day.
“I hadn’t been paying enough attention to what had been happening on a cosmic level, or I surely would’ve sensed what Lorna had been doing in the region I’d once overseen. Unfortunately, just after Louis died, Lorna activated a soul-trapping spell somewhere in the vicinity, and I was unable to save him. I was still bound to him, and was pulled along by her spell. I sought her out, learned what she had done and what she intended to do with her collection of trapped souls, and was horrified. She trapped them in crystals, and had been experimenting with attempting to release them strategically for the purposes of filming their anguish as she banished them again for a television show.”
“Heh, good,” Dean says. “Because unless you plan on wearing your ratty jeans and a t-shirt to your thing tomorrow, I think you’re gonna be stuck wearing my clothes.”
They touched down at the top of the road right outside the bunker’s door. Cas wobbled on his feet, and Jack reached out to help him balance himself.
It felt absolutely lavish laying in bed until nearly eleven o’clock, but Dean did nothing to hurry himself along. He spent part of the morning idly planning out what to make for dinner before finally deciding he’d just suggest going out to eat whenever Cas was up and about. With his midday schedule completely cleared in one fell swoop, Dean got up and dressed before moving out to the living room with his laptop and a big mug of coffee.
“Well, technically, Jody and I will be on the same schedule, so we won’t be completely alone in our off hours.”
Cas reached out and laid a hand on Dean’s cheek. “He left the world just as it was. There’s plenty of terrible people in the world without Chuck pushing them toward us.”
On premiere night, Charlie invited them to her annual watch party. Despite Charlie and Alicia’s pleas, they chose to watch together on Cas’s sofa, bundled up in their favorite blanket and liveblogging the episode together online. The avalanche of questions they received on tumblr from everyone they knew was over at Charlie’s house felt more like a punishment for refusing to just come over and sit in the room to engage in a direct commentary on the episode.
Out in the hall, he saw Cas already headed toward the break room. It was Jody who caught up to him first, before he could take off running to catch up with Cas.
Dean turned onto the narrow dirt road to the campground where their cabin was and then slammed on the brakes as a large, fat raccoon ambled across the path in front of them. It stopped in the middle of the road, stood up on its hind legs and stared at them for a second or two before lumbering off into the woods again.
Dean makes a pleasant rumbling sound that Cas feels vibrating through his chest. “When I was planning out my evening this morning, it involved a lot of hoping you might text me again. Otherwise I expected to sit at my desk drawing until I had to hit the hay.”
Cas squinted at him in the bright sunshine. “Are you suggesting there’s nothing sinister lurking in those vast cornfields?”
Dean set his own glass down and tentatively reached for the bag. “You didn’t have to repay me for that.”
wearing pants.” Sam shakes his head, still looking ready to make a comment about Cas’s choice of tattoos, but thankfully he either notices Dean’s rising panic or he’s just too tired to push it right then. “Whatever. I just wanted to make sure I got to see you before you left. We, uh, had kind of a breakthrough last night.”
Cas gently slapped his ass, and Dean smiled at him. “I mean one of the things we never seemed to address during our deeply personal conversations was relationships. And our respective feelings about them. And about each other.”
He let Cas puzzle it out for himself, in the same adorably socially awkward way every last one of his interactions with Cas had gone from the day they’d met, and his heart thudded against his ribs knowing it was Feathers, too. The guy he’d been lowkey flirting with online for years, the guy who always seemed too good for him, too sophisticated with his scholarly takes and carefully empathetic writing. It was a wondrous revelation, watching him make the connection, like the two halves of his life sliding neatly into place. It was so much better than anything Dean had ever allowed himself to imagine.
Jamie had given her the heads up that there wasn’t any new big drama brewing up in the supernatural world, no emergency planet-threatening situation they were tackling at the moment. Their new local contacts in Lebanon also informed them that the Winchesters had been regularly spotted around town over the last few weeks, so it seemed like the perfect time to arrange for them to take a few days off. And Marie, with her newly-minted degree in creative writing, was in the perfect position to lure the Winchesters in. It wasn’t that much different from crafting a good fanfic, after all. It was just the setup for what would hopefully be an excellent story, and maybe even a new chapter in the Winchester Gospel.
Dean practically dives into the back seat and beats him to it, slings the bag over his shoulder and then gives Sam a sarcastic jazz hands, just because he can and Sam can’t. Sam rolls his eyes and shuts the door. He reaches the back door to the shop and turns back to see Dean coming with the key in hand. Sam blocks his way the door for just a moment, and when Dean’s about to tell him to get out of the way, likely with a snappy zinger tacked on for good measure, Sam beats him to it.
“You say there will be no more angels, but there’s still this one right here. And you might be taking him home with you today, but someday, eventually, he will come back to me. And there will be nothing you can do about it when that happens.”
: Pretty sure two of them are actually married to each other. Their last names are both Fitzgerald, anyway.
When they left the hospital on Friday evening, with their first actual weekend off ahead of them, they hardly knew what to do with themselves. On Tuesday, Cas had convinced Dean to let him help bring Dean’s remaining possessions in from his car. Every night that week, they’d stopped by the Impala on their way home from the hospital and each of them had carried a bag or box up to the apartment. By Friday, only Dean’s carefully packed collection of posters remained. For the last twenty four hours, Dean had been debating what exactly to do with them. When Cas detoured toward the Impala on their way home, Dean stopped in the parking lot knowing he needed to make a decision and still having no idea what to choose.
Cas made a considering face, as if he hadn’t already made up his mind. “Happy resurrection day to both of us, then. I suppose we know exactly how to celebrate it now.”
“By the time I got to middle school, I’d started writing them down. Filled up all the notebooks dad bought me for school, and then didn’t have any paper to do my homework on. It, uh, led to some of my trouble in school until Mrs. Cartwright got a hold of me in high school. She was the first adult who was actually impressed with my stories instead of being pissed off that I’d been writing them instead of doing my homework.”
After a quick shower spent visualizing the angel’s perfect form, silhouetted against a yellow moon in an inky sky filled with undiscovered constellations, he is honestly looking forward to the end of the day when he can commit the image to paper. At least he’s got the rest of the day to think over the little details. He makes a short detour to the kitchen for a bowl of cereal and the rest of the coffee, and then collects his notebook and heads downstairs to the shop. At least down there he’s less likely to get stuck on the clouds in his own imagination. From the moment he unlocks the door for Jody and Donna, he’s all business.
“Thank you for lunch, Dean. It was nice to get in one last hurrah before we’re consigned to spend our lunch breaks conversing over chicken nuggets and grilled cheese sandwiches.”
His mind screeched to a halt at the thought of Impala, too. Would he be happy for Cas if he thought he had a shot at a real relationship with Dean, or would he be hurt that Cas had found someone else? And again, Cas had to stop himself from jumping ahead. There was suddenly an overwhelming amount of information to process that hadn’t existed five minutes ago, but for once, taking his time and sorting through it all seemed like the only proper course of action. He scrolled up to Charlie’s next post.
“I know how you feel, buddy,” he told the plant and stood there for a moment frowning at it. Eventually he sighed, giving up and going to the kitchen for another beer before returning to the sofa and glaring at his laptop while he took a few slow sips.
“He sure seems like it.” Dean gives her a genuine smile, assuaging her reservations about his intentions with her friend.
“But you still write, right?” Dean asked, the innocuous question sounding strangely urgent despite his attempt to remain casual. “I mean, even if it’s just for yourself, or for fun, or whatever?”
Cas swiveled in his chair, without nearly toppling out of it thank you very much, and waved his hand at the rolling cart behind him, filled with books. “So many.”
Dean let that sink in, wondering exactly what Cas had seen when he checked up on her that time in Heaven. It must’ve been just another memory, and not actually his father. For some reason, that thought actually comforted him. The only reason his parents had fallen in love was by cupids forcing them together to make Chuck’s story work. It had always been one more reason to carry a grudge against Chuck for making all of their lives into his personal paper doll playhouse. He loved his parents, and he was sure they’d loved each other, but the grand romance of it all had always been a lie, and hearing the truth of Mary’s heaven sort of confirmed it for him. He’d stood quietly for a bit too long, because Jack piped up again.
Yeah, yeah I would. I’d be glad to help any way I can. I’m gonna try to binge the whole series again before the season premiere, but I’m gonna end up skimming a lot. I’ll keep a list of what I remember. You just let me know what you need.
“Are you warm enough, Dean?” Cas eventually asked. “You must’ve been outside for a while. I’ve been up at least ten minutes, and the weather doesn’t seem to have let up any.”
The little smiley face would’ve looked ridiculous in a professional text, but in his other life online, emojis counted as punctuation. It was strangely comforting seeing it there, and made him wonder for just a second if maybe the bridge he was building to Dean didn’t have to go as far as he’d thought.
“Don’t even try to pretend you’re mad about that,” Sam said, standing up to finish doing the dishes.
Dean snorted and shook his head. “Yeah, it’s not exactly a tourist mecca. Guess there’s not a lot of Unnatural Evil groupies in the area, either.”
Her eyes widened at that, and she looked nervously at the man she’d thought of as her associate for the last few months but who clearly now held her fate in his hands. Dean followed behind her as Sam and Ed brought up the rear.
“Remember, I fell from Heaven to be with you, Dean, however you would have me. If that means riding along with you and Sam on hunts, or teaching me about cars, or how to fish, or watching movies, or sharing your bed, I will be happy because I’m with you.”
Dean shoved his duffel off the big bin of household necessities he’d packed for this exact occasion and pried the lid off, enjoying the scent of home that wafted out of it. The new apartment smelled a little plasticy, like new carpet and unfamiliar sterility. Maybe Cas’s room had taken on a bit of the scent of him already, but the rest of the space still just had that new car smell about it, like Cas hadn’t really spent any time settling into the rest of the place yet and had been isolating himself in his own room. It made sense if he’d spent a lot of time unpacking and arranging all his stuff and decorating. Or maybe he’d taken a few days to play tourist around Miami. It had been something Dean had debated with himself about doing, too, and he felt an irrational pang of jealousy that maybe Cas had already had that opportunity he’d denied himself. But no, Dean had made his choice, and he couldn’t really regret spending a few extra days with the family and friends he might not get to see for nearly a year otherwise.
Dean closed his eyes for a moment as Cas’s hand trailed suds down his neck and across his chest. They flew open again when Cas gently brushed a soapy finger over his nipple. His gasp brought Cas’s attention around from his intense focus on getting Dean clean. The moment they locked eyes they crashed right back to where they’d been before they’d hit the roadblock at Dean’s belt. Dean finally took a good long look at Cas, in all his wet, naked, and fully aroused glory. When Dean had drunk him all in, he reached out to Cas, looking right into his eyes, and slowly slid his hand down Cas’s side again. Cas shuddered at the touch and stepped closer. Still holding the soap, he wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist again and pulled him in close. At the first touch of warm, wet skin, the soap slipped out of his hand and landed forgotten on the floor.
Sam nodded his agreement as he sat back down with a stack of Rowena’s journals and got to work trying to find the details of her spell. When Dean’s only response to that was to shake his head and take another sip of his whiskey, Cas held up the letter.
“You do that,” Pamela says seriously, “and I’ll be in touch when I have something to report. You take care of my client, Dean. He’s one of the good ones.”
“You didn’t strike me as the suit wearing type,” Cas says, hanging it back up at the end of the rack beside the shirt and tie Dean picked for him.
Cas endures a pretty routine afternoon in the ER. An emergency appendectomy keeps him after his agreed upon meeting time with Gabriel, but he finds the man once again loitering in the staff lounge with a cup of hot chocolate when he’s finally done for the day.
“That’s easy enough,” Cas replies, his hands already moving toward Dean’s belt buckle. “And after that?”
“What can I say,” Dean replied, hands outstretched in front of him. “I wasn’t about to sacrifice years of work, to put everything at risk because she wasn’t satisfied with how much time I was able to devote to her. She knew going in that I was committed to finishing med school, and what my schedule would likely be, but I guess I cancelled one too many dates.”
Dean wipes his hands off on a paper towel and prepares a bandage, taping it down gently. “You’re gonna wanna leave that on for at least a few hours. You can shower in the morning, but be careful not to soap it up too rough. Don’t soak it in hot water for a few days, at least, and gently pat it dry. No rubbing. Keep it moisturized with something unscented until it starts healing--”
A pained look crossed her face, and she closed the short distance between them and gathered him up in a hug. “Jack, I know it wasn’t really your fault. I know you weren’t yourself.”
Jack protested that assessment. “I have a little bit of power. It’s inherent in my nature, even without a true angelic aspect of my being. Angels were always just pieces of Chuck’s own power. He created them to serve him, and that service isn’t required with the universe restored to itself.”
Dean waited until he’d climbed behind the wheel and then pulled up the front driveway. He shut off the car and was about to get out, but Sam stopped him.
“Shoulders are easy,” Jody assures both the client and Claire. “And he already knows your whole apprentice rigamarole,” she adds, while the man nods at her with a smile.
After the flash of heart-stopping panic at the thought of sending Cas a link to his AO3 account subsided, Dean had done his best to brush off the offer with a joke. Someone like Cas, who’d given up on writing professionally to escape the grind of the publishing industry, wouldn’t be interested in reading his amateur fanfic. Especially not a guy who wanted to write fantasy novels for
Dean read it over, sipping coffee and doing his best not to roll his eyes at the fact she addressed both his dilemmas in her first two sentences. She redeemed herself entirely by the end of the third, though. Charlie was always good for perspective, even if Dean nearly snorted coffee out his nose at her delivery. If anyone could help him figure out the mess of his social life, it would probably be her, though.
“It wasn’t so bad,” Louis replied kindly. “Maybe a little crowded, but it didn’t seem unlike the descriptions of Heaven that Wulf has shared with me.”
With that she gave a little wave and headed for home. Dean locked the door behind her and slumped against it for a moment, feeling the heaviness of his first day without Cas hitting him like a truck. He pulled out his phone, just on the off chance that Cas had texted him during his shift, and it came with the stack of sticky notes he’d shoved in his pocket when Donna had arrived. There weren’t any new texts, but just reading through all of Cas’s notes again made him feel a little less miserable. He headed into the kitchen to start returning the favor.
He heard Cas buzz the driver up, and managed to get himself mostly cleaned up in time to wave to the guy as he handed Cas their food. In the few minutes that had passed, their discomfort had entirely evaporated and Cas walked into the kitchen without any of the hesitation he’d shown before. Dean wondered if that meant he was happy to let their earlier conversation drop altogether, or if he just didn’t care about it either way now. Not that he wanted Cas on edge and uncomfortable, but the reasons for his renewed calm were potentially just as troubling.
Sam rubbed a hand over his eyes, already exhausted from this mental ordeal, and answered when Dean only rolled his eyes at Cas in the rear view mirror. “We passed a diner last night that Dean wants to check out. It’s only a few blocks from here.”
: Wow, Feathers, you were really ready to read my unedited draft with no idea what you were even signing up for?
“I figure neither of us is gonna be using the next four years as some sort of speed dating service,” Dean started off, running a hand through his hair and finally committing to flashing Cas a self-deprecating smile. “Between work and trying my damnedest not to kill anyone by accident, and trying to catch up on years worth of lost sleep while hopefully not doing anything stupid enough to get fired over… yeah I think I got enough stress in my life without throwing random hookups in the mix.”
“What, you and me against Cas and Ed?” Dean asked as they climbed the steps into the garage. “That doesn’t really seem fair. Cas ain’t never played, and Ed doesn’t really strike me as a sports enthusiast.”
He opened the computer and started typing, navigating the hospital’s website to the page featuring the board of trustees and the administrative department.
to make a big deal out of it.” Dean grinned at him. “Guess Cas took care of the heavy lifting on making that clear tonight. Now I gotta think of a creative way to repay him for that.”
He couldn’t bring himself to go hang out with all the celebrating authors. Dean quietly shut his laptop and slumped off to bed.
Dean finally shook himself free of the hallway and carefully stepped out into the living room, looking around with slightly fresher eyes than he’d taken it in with when his arms had been full and his only thought had been putting it all down. Now he could see a few of Cas’s personal items on the shelves flanking the television, where he’d clearly made an effort to make the place feel a little less sterile and devoid of personality. When he stopped to study a framed photo, Cas took the liberty of walking over and peering over his shoulder.
?” Dean asked, and then took a gulp, letting the alcohol warm his tongue before swallowing. “Don’t make it sound like that.”
“Because, you ninny, they didn’t want to tell you any of this. They just wanted to hand you your schedule and leave it to all of us to cope with this mess. I thought you had a right to know. Even if you didn’t hear it from me.”
Jody took pity on Dean as he twisted back around in his seat, likely exposing the slightly dazed look on his face. “Don’t you worry, Dean. It’s a lot to take in all at once like this.”
“Yes, you might say we got bored of playing God. We decided it was too much power for any conscious being to possess, and we freed it to be its own force in the universe.”
Dean leans against the counter, idly staring into the middle distance and sipping his drink. “Pamela not working you too hard, is she?”
His thoughts immediately went to Feathers’ fic. There was no way in hell he could continue reading that at school. The part of the story he’d left off on wasn’t exactly family friendly, but it wasn’t smut. Maybe being up on stage during a question and answer session had just reminded him of the Unnatural convention panel he’d been reading about in the story. Dean spared a thought for Feathers, and wondered if he was experiencing a similar frustration over not being able to keep reading his fic, too.
“You were both willing to lay down your lives for me without hesitation, and without you, none of us would be here right now. The universe would simply be gone. You both had your choices stolen from you when Chuck and Lucifer chose to meddle with creation.”
Dean looked into his face for a beat longer that Cas had been expecting, and he tilted his head to the side trying to understand if Dean was attempting to convey something important. This was not the sort of situation he wanted to misunderstand Dean’s silent communications. Instead of clarifying, Dean gave him a little smile and then glanced back over Cas’s shoulder with a slight nod. He didn’t need the words to understand
Dean wondered for a moment if he’d hallucinated the entire interaction. He shuddered and fumbled his spoon back into his bowl, sneaking a glance over at Cas who gave him what Dean could only see as a reassuring smile, and realized that no, that really had happened. Either Cas was just the most intense motherfucker he’d ever met, or he had a force of will that far exceeded Dean’s in that moment. He watched Cas take another bite of his chili with just as much enthusiasm as he’d ever shown for Dean’s cooking, and blamed his own upended emotional state on his entirely unreciprocated feelings for Cas.
Dean laughed at that as Cas got them moving toward the emergency room doors. “Nah, I’ve been up long enough that I don’t think an adrenalin shot to the heart could keep me from sleeping. All I need is a horizontal surface and like four hours.”
Dean was, for once in his life, grateful his schedule switched on Friday and he wouldn’t have to be at the hospital until the evening shift. He stayed up way too late catching up with Charlie and telling her all about Cas. She’d been more than happy to listen to him ramble for over an hour. The longer Dean talked, the more he realized just how much he felt for Cas, how much he missed him and how desperately he needed Cas back in his life. Charlie was kind enough not to tease him about how ridiculous his crush was after only knowing Cas less than a month, and encouraged him to lay all his feelings out on the line.
Cas nodded. He might not have had a similar experience himself, but he could see where Dean’s story was going, and didn’t want to interrupt.
Cas peeks in the envelope, at the sticker for the windshield and the card printed with his personal access code that will allow him to park in the employee lot closest to the hospital. “You didn’t have to do that, Gabriel. I could’ve picked it up on Monday.”
Cas nodded as he rinsed the last of the shampoo from his hair and then switched places with Dean again to hunt down the soap. “I’m glad you did, for more reasons than just discovering how thin this wall is,” Cas said, giving him a little smirk as he knocked on the wall in question with a sudsy knuckle.
Charlie huffed and frowned. “You’re half in love with the guy and you don’t even know his name. This is definitely a bigger problem than I thought.”
Cas huffed out a laugh and shook his head, but Dean let him lead him up to the wide front porch, complete with an old fashioned porch swing.
“We had some Crunch Cookie Crunch inside. You’re welcome to have some. It’s a very satisfying late night snack food,” Jack assured her.
And there was today’s epic shopping trip. They’d planned to pick up a few things, but it had turned into a day-long marathon that resulted in Cas modeling his new bunny slippers while Dean abandoned all his dinner plans to heat up a couple of frozen pizzas.
Sam laughs at that, grinning at his brother. “Yeah, man, I know. I just figured it was easier to joke about it than to let you make a fool of yourself with the doctor.”
Cas shakes his head, grabbing Dean by the wrist before he can walk out of the bathroom. Dean looks up at him, surprised.
Cas can’t help the laugh that escapes him. It feels like the first time he’s really let go of the weight on his shoulders. Texting Dean had been the best decision he’s made all day. He laughs again when he realizes it’s the thought of tattooing those wings on his overburdened shoulders that’s lightened the rest of his burdens, like some sort of cosmic feather duster sweeping them to the side.
“Of course I was,” Dean replies, heading into the kitchen and getting each of them a beer. “What was I right about this time?”
Cas turned to him, the look of surprise on his face quickly turning to a smile. “It is a bit like a resurrection, isn’t it? We’ve come all the way back around to where it started, and we’re free of it all now.”
or whatever Sam had called it. They’d spent the whole fucking night breathing in a concentrated dose of whatever honesty juice had doped the entire town. Sam gave him a contrite look, but there was nothing they could do about it right that second. Dean was about to press on to their next question when Jack chimed in with some of his practice questions from the car.
“You’re right. I should definitely get them outta the heat.” He reached into the depths of the Impala’s massive trunk and hauled out the bin, balancing it on his hip while he slammed the trunk shut. “Even in LA I kept them hidden at the back of my closet. And my closet here’s practically palatial compared to that place.”
Donna gave him the same face he’d seen her give a ten-year-old student when the boy insisted that a werewolf had broken into his house and eaten his homework. “Well, you go on and have a nice time, then,” she said, turning him around by the shoulders and giving him a gentle push into the hallway as she turned out the rest of the lights and shut the door behind them.
“You can practically feel the honey on your tongue,” Cas added, halfway sticking his tongue out chasing the flavor of it.
Dean laughed at that and pulled Cas into a hug. “Okay then, we’re gonna get outta here. Together. I think that’s the only chance we got.”
“When did you find the time to do all this?” Dean asked, poking at one of the marshmallows in his mug before taking another sip.
Dean sighed, kicking his feet up on the chair opposite him under the table and slouching down in his seat. “Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.”
“Because there’s no way in hell you’d ever consider going on a real date with a pathetic loser like me?” he asked, even though he hadn’t intended it to come out like a question.
“Yes, I’ve been informed that you’ll be receiving correspondence from the Chief of Medicine that the entire department will resume its previous schedule by the end of the weekend. I don’t have the details for you yet, but you should have them before the previously referenced article goes to press. Apparently the hospital is scrambling to do a bit of preemptive housekeeping.”
When they’d finally met face to face two months ago, she’d taken one look at him and gave him an impressed thumbs up. Dean had to ask what the hell she was talking about, but she’d remembered that conversation all those years in careful anticipation of that moment.
“So you mean Sam lost two girlfriends to Hell, and now that they’re both resurrected, neither one will speak to him anymore?”
Inside Jack, she said, “You can’t hide the truth from someone who knows you so well. Omniscience and omnipotence can’t help you when it comes to people who love you.”
Dean knew that. He’d seen it. It was even one of those huge old claw-foot jobs. It would take forever to run enough water to fill it up, and they both really needed to get cleaned up if they were gonna share the bed again. At that thought, a hundred new connections zinged through Dean’s head, giving him ideas he wouldn’t have dared to think before they’d kissed. No, before they’d gotten so distracted making out that their cocoa had congealed. He was tentatively hopeful that he was even allowed to think such things now.
There were two ways Dean could take this, and he was in kind of a fuck it all sort of mood. He didn’t even think twice about taking that risk.
A series of emotions flashed across her face, but she didn’t give voice to any of them. Instead, she stood up and grabbed her backpack, letting it hang off one shoulder.
No, he couldn’t and no, he wouldn’t. But Dean couldn’t think about that right now. Not while his face was swollen from the beating Lucifer had given him. He hated Lucifer. Hated him with every fiber of his being and every ounce of strength he could muster.
Sometime later, as Dean was finishing, Mary came by, with a backpack slung over her shoulder. She stood in the doorway.
Castiel backed down. He would get the story out of him sooner or later, but he wasn’t going to try his luck tonight. He was still holding the keys and started walking towards the door. He stopped before it, not hearing Dean’s footsteps behind him.
Castiel looked away. He was a soldier. He had seen it all before, and yet, this gave him pause. He had led battles; he had slaughtered his own kind. He had witnessed many demons suffer at the hands of angels, demons, and humans alike. And yet, this lowly demon choking back tears gnawed at something within him.
As he moved into the room, Castiel informed Dean that Mary and Sam were packing their bags and would be leaving soon. They’d be gone for a few days, perhaps a week. Two, at most. Dean nodded absentmindedly while he worked.
He didn’t want to explain the exhaustion that washed over him. He didn’t want to explain the state in which he’d been since they had returned from their hunt. He didn’t want to see Castiel eye him quizzically. He wasn’t even sure why he had called.
It had felt good to use some of that pent-up energy, to release some of that frustration. Fucking angels and demons and their damn Apocalypse. Fuck Zachariah and Ruby and all the others.
Dean moved closer and started taking off his jacket and the flannel shirt he was wearing. Mary watched, confused, but didn’t comment. At last, he pulled up the sleeve of his undershirt so she could see the mark there. Once again, he said, “He raised me from perdition.”
Dean's eyes were already wet and so, Castiel wasn’t surprised when he saw him wiping away the tears with the back of his hand. He knew Dean hated to cry, and he hated crying in front of others even more.
Dean pulled away first. He said, “I've held down jobs and been in relationships, but I've never had a home — not since you died, and not until we found this place.”
And so, through the heartbreak, he reached for this unknown and yet familiar thing, strumming along. It was pulsating. And as if on impulse, he reached for it. And as he held on, he felt it grow stronger. Gaining confidence, as it was now in control, it drummed masterfully.
Sam scoffed. “Dean, you can’t be serious? I live with you. I’ve known for years. And I get it, I get why you keep quiet. Cas is my friend, too,” said Sam.
“But you keep doing it. What is this, the third time this week? It’s pathetic. Man up and tell him you need him, or, move on,” said Crowley.
This time, there was no way he could sleep. At least, not tonight. And even if he did, this nightmare wouldn’t end when he opened his eyes.
“I — I get it. I do, I went to hell and back and Sam was running around with a demon. My stint in hell saved his life and I had no fucking clue what was going on. I had no idea what had happened to him in the time I was gone,” said Dean.
Didn’t matter how many years had passed, he would always think back on that day. The silence that stretched between them. Who was he to challenge destiny? He had wondered what it would take to become that version of himself he met in the future, but now he had a better idea.
Castiel couldn’t meet his eyes. Mary had asked him to keep their partnership a secret from her sons. She had said she didn’t want them to think she was unwilling to hunt with them, though that was the truth. She was hoping to spare them.
When he was four, he held his baby brother in his arms, and watched his home go up in flames. Nothing had been right since. Nothing. And he couldn’t help but think of that day. He had been thinking about it since answering Missouri’s call.
Dean started tossing and turning well into the night. Immediately, Castiel was at his side. By this point, the thin sheet was only covering his lower half. And the black t-shirt was riding up, exposing the small of his back.
Dean sighed. He really should’ve seen this coming. They had been driving in silence for some time, but it wasn’t companionable.
After some time, they’d settled in the den. He and Sam stood near the wall, listening to the others recount their hunts with Asa. There was a knock at the door. Asa’s mom answered the door and they made their way to the den.
He needed a drink to calm his nerves. He left the room and made his way back to the kitchen. He knew he was being followed and he knew who was following him, but he didn’t turn around until he had a beer in his hands.
There was so much he wanted to say. So much, but he couldn’t form the words, just errant thoughts. There was intent and feeling and he hoped, for the first time in a long, long time. He had hope.
After their sparring matches (or their fights), when Sam left (and he was always the one to leave), Dean would be left behind, all bloodied and bruised. But he’d clean up their mess, pay for damages, and bandage his own wounds.
Castiel stood and wrapped Dean in his arms, and Dean cried into his shoulder. He took short, uneven breaths. Mary didn’t say a word as they stood there. It was the second such time she was privy to a moment between them in as many days.
He moved towards the desk and reached into the drawer. He held up a drawing for both Castiel and Mary to see.
He was a celestial being. He was light and intent and that luminous explosion was the end. There was blood and viscera scattered through the air, but it wasn’t the end. He was brought back, and this time, he was remade in God’s image and given a body. This was no longer a vessel. It was his body. Though there was no soul, it was his. And he took great pleasure in that. He had been on earth before, and he had been in a human body before, but he had never been in
Dean could sense it though. He had been around the angel long enough. When Castiel first appeared, and when he placed his fingers on Dean’s forehead, and then again when he reached for his hands, Dean felt it. There was an energy emanating from him that hadn’t been there before.
Fuck thought Dean. This never gets any easier. Putting yourself on the line, trusting someone to be who they said they were, and learning the hard way that everyone succumbs to pressure, or temptation, or hell, fucking demons — it never stops hurting.
Dean tested his patience. All lovers do. His resolve, especially in the face of uncertainty, brought him comfort. It eased him. Even if he didn’t know, he wouldn’t let that deter him. He would formulate a plan, and come hell or high water, he would see it through, to the bitter end.
She looked at him then, careful, and considerate. Finally, she started to walk back up the stairs to the seat she had been in only minutes ago.
He was reorganizing his duffle as he did this every night. He had separated what he would wear to sleep: a black undershirt and black boxer briefs. These were new, Castiel noted. And they hugged his hips. Castiel didn’t mind, not one little bit.
“Hello, Dean,” said Castiel. The other hunters turned to face Dean, who made his way to stand beside Castiel, who was still standing next to Mary.
They took their time. There was no need to rush. It was the middle of the night, and they were safe. They were home and no one else was awake.
The skin there was soft and warm. Pulling away, Dean turned to face his mother. She was sitting quietly, silent tears running down her cheeks.
How could the father who let his son bleed in the backseat be the father who took his son to baseball games? How could the father who disappeared for weeks at a time be the father who never missed a birthday? How could the father who never answered a phone call be the one who kept in touch?
“She took it well. I’ve come to understand that parents aren’t always the most forgiving, especially when their children turn out to be markedly different,” said Castiel.
“When Sam died, he was 24. Dean had lost John the year before. He couldn’t go on, and so, he made a deal with a crossroads demon. The demon brought back Sam and gave Dean a year.”
Dean hated thinking of Sam, down there. He had died to save Sam from such a fate, and he had utterly failed.
He would say it all if he felt Dean would hear him, but he was too caught up in tying his own noose to listen.
He turned to face Castiel and pulled him close. “I’ve told you everything there is to know. You’ve seen all of me, and if you want this… If you want this to be real, then it is.”
Besides, it was easy to talk to them and they seemed to have a strong bond, not unlike the one he had with Sam.
Patience was young; she was restless. She was too young to understand the sheer exhaustion Dean felt. And he didn’t want her to ever feel this way. He wanted her to stay far, far away.
He could feel his heartbeat as if it were his own, thumping in his chest. He could feel the blood rushing through the ventricles. This was a new sensation, of course, like so many of his experiences on earth. This didn’t seem daunting, not the way falling and failing had been.
Dean shook his head. “You say, ‘of course,’ as if you don’t leave when I least expect. And I never know, if or when, you’re coming back. And I just…”
They were right about the fire, of course. Everything burned, hotter than lava. And there was Sam, bound to Lucifer for eternity. Forty years had felt like a lifetime. Dean couldn’t fathom an eternity in Hell, bound to the Devil.
Jody, sensing his thoughts, turned, and offered him a quiet smile. She was grateful for their company.
While in the kitchen, Dean had made the mistake of mentioning the wendigo killings. When he said the word, everyone around him took a swig of their drink. He sighed. He hated being caught off guard, and though he knew it was all fun and games, he made a note to tell Sam.
Castiel saw now that they were both wrong. Mary didn’t want Dean to censor their lives and she didn’t want to connect with Sam, the hunter. She wanted the life of which she had been robbed, the children she had left behind, and the husband she desperately missed.
They both should’ve died long ago. Dean got a new lease on life after John sold his sold, and Dean sold his for Sam.
All these emotions washed over him; he could seldom name them. And though Cas had healed his superficial wounds, he had only managed to ease the pain in his chest. He hadn’t been able to heal that wound. It was much too deep.
“This body, it’s mine,” said Castiel when he slid into the passenger’s seat. They had stopped for gas. Dean was still distracted by his thoughts, but he didn’t need to think to pump gas. He’d been pumping gas since he was a child. It was instinctual, as were so many of the other things he had learned in childhood.
“I’m not questioning your bond; I’m questioning your ability. Need I remind you that you came to me for help, meaning you don’t think you can do this yourself, and thus, you need my assistance.”
“A paramedic came up to me and asked me if he had kin or next of kin. I gave her Sam’s number without hesitation. I’m ashamed to admit, but I didn’t have the courage to speak to him, and she wouldn’t have expected me to do so.”
“Here we go again. Haven’t you learned anything? Didn’t your stint in Purgatory teach you a thing? What makes you think you’re uniquely suited for this task when you couldn’t even stop the bleeding?”
Each had a pencil in hand and was circling different phone numbers. Sam was noting the names and addresses into John’s journal.
Dean watched him nervously. He couldn’t help but think of the Castiel he had met in 2014 whose vices outnumbered Dean’s own. Castiel took a drag, and Dean watched, mesmerized. One drag, then another. An angel of the Lord smoking a cigarette in front of a motel, surely that was one for the books.
“Mom, I was 29 when I went to hell. And Castiel was the angel who pulled me out of the pit. I owe him my everything,” said Dean.
Dean would only seek the journal when he felt off-kilter. Perhaps with age, he thought, he’d grow to understand the man his father had been, the man he was raising them to be. John kept his sons at arm’s distance, but he was frank in his accounts.
Dean had showered and was wearing a towel and little else. Dean had wrapped the towel around his hips. His hair was still wet and there were droplets on his shoulder. If Sam were up and moving about the same space, Dean would have dressed in the bathroom before coming out. But tonight, he hadn’t bothered.
Once they were parked on the shoulder, Jody made herself comfortable. She leaned against the window with her feet tucked underneath her. Only then did Dean speak.
Dean turned to look at him. “Fuck, Cas. That was the best sex of my life and it was a dream. It was all a dream.”
“Now if you weren’t strong enough to heal him, why do you think you’ll be strong enough to possess him and heal him by way of possession?”
“Great, just fucking great. Your boyfriend thinks you’re still trapped in Purgatory, and here you are, plotting to possess the poor, comatose son of a bitch!”
Dean had forbidden them from speaking of Lisa and Ben, but that didn’t mean Castiel stopped thinking about the year Dean had lived with them. He couldn’t bear to think about her name on the tip of his tongue, her hands on his waist, and her lips on his. Whenever he did, he felt a darkness claw its way up from the well in which it was hidden.
“He was. He was alone. The car was… I’m sure he’ll — he’ll put her back together. He’s the one I’m worried about,” said Castiel.
Dean had finished cleaning the weapons, he was putting them into the duffel. It was open, on his bed. He looked up; she had sounded concerned.
They both walked out of the car at the same time. While Dean pumped gas, Cas asked the clerk for a pack of menthols and beef jerky. Dean ate the jerky greedily but not before offering Cas a piece.
Lucifer hadn’t held back — not that Dean had thought he would, he was the Devil, after all. Dean had sparred with his brother more times than he could count, and they’d had some nasty fights, but they always held back. And maybe they should’ve used their words instead of pummeling each other into the drywall, but they were young and reckless.
As Mary investigated the room, she took note of Dean’s carefully curated books, sorted by height on the ledge above his bed. Then, she looked over at the desk. There were no take out containers or empty cups. There were no empty plates or beer bottles. Just a few notebooks, stacked neatly one on top of the other. There were a few loose pages sticking out from one of the notebooks, but nothing was awry.
“I — I noticed. When you arrived, I noticed. Things, things changed. They’re softer now,” said Dean.
Sam had offered Castiel the passenger’s seat, and he had accepted. It wasn’t fair to Sam. Dean’s mercurial moods were one thing, but this was something else.
Castiel kept his hands in his lap and took a deep breath. He didn’t need to breathe, but he found that it helped. Then, with two fingers, he touched Dean’s forehead.
There was more, of course. Things weren’t so cut-and-dry. No, John wasn’t concerned with holidays or class trips or school dances, but he didn’t want his sons to be ignorant of the world around them — the dark underbelly.
Castiel nodded. “Mary had her suspicions, I only confirmed them. I asked her to keep it secret. I believe she misunderstood the reason why.”
She looked at Dean — the one in the picture. Her little boy. The one who hugged her whenever she was upset, the one who always reminded her she was loved. Her eyes started to water. And she started to speak but couldn’t bring herself to say anything.
“No, we can deal with damned. We’re all damned. Say it works. You possess him and cure him of his maladies. What next? Without your grace, your vessel would begin to decay. We have no way of knowing how long it would take for an angel to heal a human with these many injuries. He has a concussion, broken ribs, a broken arm, and a ruptured spleen. You’ll have to remove the spleen.”
Dean only knew that which he could observe, what he could see, or hear, or touch, or taste. And he knew, Michael had snapped Castiel. He had watched it happened and had smelled the blood in the air. And the second Michael had snapped his fingers, Castiel had ceased to be.
And he’d had the nerve, the unmitigated gall to tell Dean not to bring him back. As if Dean could ever… As if Dean could ever live without his brother, without his Sammy.
They listened to the cassettes Jody had picked and found themselves singing along. She was in much better spirits when they arrived, for which Dean was pleased.
Some days, he forgot she was a woman. She was a flesh and blood woman who cried and bled. There was something superhuman about Jody. She had lost her husband and her son in the worst of ways, but she persevered. She was still sheriff and had taken up hunting. And she was a damn good hunter. And now, she was raising Alex and Claire.
“If he doesn’t wake up, you can bargain with the reaper who will come to collect him,” said Crowley. “Unless, of course, that reaper is Death himself. Though, knowing his sense of humor, he’d give you an audience anyway.”
For Dean, Castiel was in a different echelon. He was an angel who had fallen from Heaven, and he had done so to stop Heaven from seeing its plan come to fruition. Cas had made his intentions clear long ago when they had tried to prevent Lucifer’s rising.
Mary was still navigating this era. This was clear as day to Castiel. He had been on earth for years. He had been around others. Those who grew up afraid, ashamed. He had seen it in Dean not so long ago.
She smiled at him as she entered, dropping the backpack by the door. Castiel would recognize that smile anywhere. There was so much of her in Dean. She was so generous with her affection — her smiles, her lingering touches — and so was he.
Dean woke up shortly after that. Sam would be back soon. They wouldn’t have much time before the nurses noticed he awoke.
The car creaked in all the places he felt cricks. Add to that the blood in the backseat and on the passenger’s side window and the state of their clothes. They went through more bleach than salt these days. Having the King of Hell on speed dial meant he wasn’t exorcising demons as much anymore. He almost missed it. There was a comfort in routine, in simplicity. Demons were bad, angels didn’t exist. God is a deadbeat dad, the angels are vindictive, and the demons? They’re bureaucrats. It shouldn’t make sense, and yet it did.
He never left the house without his gun and a few knives. He tucked them into his boots, in his jacket, and in his jeans. Was it the paranoia if there was precedent?
“Oh Cassie, you’ve died on this very floor. I know making a deal with you is akin to making a deal with the Devil. You angels are all the same: self-serving. And you have the audacity to say we’re untrustworthy.”
Castiel had taken the empty seat next to Mary. What a pair, thought Dean, when he turned and spied them. A fallen angel and a woman brought back from heaven, sitting here, in an underground bunker. When he thought of it like that, he and Sammy were no better. They’d been to hell and back.
And with Sammy in the backseat it would be worse. He’d see all his expressions in the rear-view mirror. Occasionally, Mary would turn around, and direct her questions at Sam. And he’d stutter through an answer. Mary would turn back to gauge Dean’s reaction, and the disappointment that would cross her face when she’d find resignation on Dean’s face. It would break him; he knew it would.
He felt as if he hadn’t spoken in years. And yet, there was hope in his voice. He was incredulous, of course, but the words were an exaltation.
They were well on their way when he turned on the stereo again. Jody didn’t need to know he had taken the cassette from Castiel’s inner coat pocket. She didn’t need to know he had picked these songs, had arranged them just so.
Castiel’s first words to him echoed his fears. He didn’t think he deserved it, and he hadn’t. Castiel had been acting on orders, and his orders were just a small part of Heaven’s grand plan. He and Sam were caught in the middle. Pawns in a game of chess they couldn’t understand from inside the chessboard.
Dean pulled away and threw his head back. He kept thinking of those last few nights in Purgatory. He thought of the dream — the dock, the fish in the lake, and the water lapping against the shore. He looked over at Castiel.
Maybe he should tell Mary to leave, to come back in a bit. Give Dean some time before taking off, but she spoke before he could say anything.
Even when John had been around, Dean had cleaned up their messes. He’d been cleaning after John for decades, so why would Sam be any different? After all, it was Sam who took after their father. It was Sam who was most like John. Their single-minded determination carried them through life. And John had molded Dean into the perfect soldier, but not the perfect son. The perfect son wouldn’t have needed molding.
He hadn’t given the angels this much thought. But now, he couldn’t stop thinking about them and their vessels. He had been so close to being one himself.
What did it even mean? What did it mean to an angel? Beyond that though, what did he have to lose? He didn’t want to be alone, that much he knew.
“Because I know his soul, more intimately than I know any other thing on this earth. I remade him once, I am certain I could do it again.”
Sam had spent so long running away from hunting, from his destiny. He could relate to Mary as a hunter. Or so, he thought.
Just another reflex, like keeping a .45 under his pillow and reaching for it when someone woke him up.
The line between hunter and hunted blurred. He had Crowley’s number on speed dial, and he had killed that kid in cold blood. Now, he had a connection to the Darkness, and there was seemingly nothing he could do about it. And when he closed his eyes, he saw it all. All the blood. God, there was always so much blood.
Adam, the youngest Winchester, and the only one given a shot at normalcy. His mere existence and the conflicting set of memories he had shared with his brothers unnerved Dean. Cleaved him down the middle.
Affectionately, he named Baby, and treated her as a home. She had been more of a home than any four walls. Castiel felt at peace in the car, with Dean behind the wheel. He was content to ride in the passenger’s seat.
Once he left, Sam would be left staring at the blood on his hands, for they were still his. Despite all the damage Lucifer wrought, they would still be Sam’s hands.
The camaraderie built from surviving the unthinkable helped the brothers form strong bonds. They would turn to their friends, their colleagues. No longer needing to reach for the journal, it spent more and more time in the trunk. Yet another weapon kept within arm’s reach for when he wanted to turn it on himself.
Mary and Sam had combed through phone book after phone book and at long last, found her. Mary told Sam very little about her, but Sam understood this was important, and beyond that, enjoyed spending the time with his mother. And so, he jumped at the opportunity to go with her.
“And this is Mary Winchester, our mother,” said Sam, moving to stand beside her as they moved into the room. At that, there was a sharp intake of breath, and then the silence devolved into susurrations.
“I will be here for as long as you will have me,” said Castiel with all the sincerity he could muster.
But in that moment, he heard what he needed to hear. There was someone willing to pull him out of his nightmares. It was the only thing he had wanted, and he had been wanting it for as long as he could remember.
“Ordinarily, I would raise an objection,” said Castiel as Dean pulled into the gas station. “But given the events of the day—”
They drove around to their room. When he turned off the car, Dean handed Castiel the keys. While getting out of the car, he opened the pack and lit a cigarette. He closed the door behind him and leaned against it. Castiel was still sitting in the passenger seat, watching him.
Dean hated to pack in a rush. He wouldn’t want to forget anything, and they would be leaving this town come morning, so there would be no time. Better to do it now. And so, Castiel watched him work. Noticing the way his fingers rolled the shirts and jeans he was tucking away. Sometimes, Dean would find a book at the bottom of the duffle and flip through it until he found a passage he liked.
“That was more than a second,” said Castiel, opening the door and moving to the side, giving Dean room to walk through.
Dean knew the answer, of course. Dean knew he was the firstborn but never the chosen one, and it pained him. It left him feeling hollow; carved out. For so long he had wanted to understand, to be someone John would be proud of calling
Castiel didn’t seem to mind, had even expected it. Dean pulled over — much as he thought he would — and cried into the steering wheel. The angel reached for his hand and clasped it in his, squeezing softly.
He could feel the tears welling up. He just wanted to get the words out. He wanted to tell someone. And the person he wanted to tell couldn’t hear.
He circled around the King of Hell, who was presently torturing a lesser demon. The demon was writhing in pain and bleeding from deep gashes on his sternum.
“If you summoned me here, then you must know. He’s my charge. We’re bonded, and I’m not going to leave him,” said Castiel. He was resolute.
Castiel didn’t comment. He had only seen a flash of light before their surroundings took shape. This reminded him of that dream. It seemed Dean enjoyed fishing. This pleased him. He rarely took pleasure in small things like this. Sure, there was the booze and the burgers. And before him, there had been more women. But he rarely allowed himself to enjoy life’s little treasures.
“I have found that Dean finds the expectations placed on men to be a burden. It has made things…difficult for him. He desperately wants to be one thing and society — and his father — have told him he needs to be something else. This causes him a great deal of grief,” said Castiel.
“Mary found some sigils and needed help. She’s not familiar with Enochian since there were no angels on earth during her time as a hunter. I offered my assistance, as I’ve offered it to you many a time,” said Castiel.
“No, I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t have said anything not because I don’t want you to know, but because I don’t want to share this. I don’t want to share him. I’ve lost him before, and I don’t think I could handle losing him again.”
Realizing he’s in love with his dead best friend while trying to convince a psychic she shouldn’t follow in her grandmother’s footsteps was hard enough. But her grandmother had been an old friend, and with each passing day, Dean had less and less of those.
“I drew sometimes, too, when I was his age, but dad wasn't paying attention.” He scoffed, “I wasn’t a demon to hunt, you know?”
“I sold my soul to save his life because that’s what dad asked me to do, that was his fucking dying wish. And then, I went to hell and I spent 4 months and 40 years being tortured into torturing souls."
This Mary — who returned to an earth she had left over 30 years ago, who couldn’t look her adult sons in the eye when she spoke — she might as well have been a stranger. He thought he could understand. He had spent four months and 40 years in hell. He knew what it was like to come back, changed, to a place that had also changed.
And now he was sitting in an office. The walls were white and bare; too stark. The fluorescent lights overhead added to the ambience. Though it wasn’t a hospital, there was a sterile, surgical quality to the room that made him uneasy.
He still didn’t know why he mattered so much to him, but nothing else could’ve overwhelmed Dean. He was already so torn and frayed. He was a rocky coast, with wave after wave crashing at the shore.
He didn’t know what it was, and he didn’t know why it felt familiar, just that it did. And he trusted it, implicitly. After all, it was a part of him. And despite what he said, he knew he could only rely on himself were it all to come to an end.
“She died, too. I just — I just keep losing people. And it never gets easier. And it never hurts any less.”
“Mom’s asking about you," said Sam, moving into the room and reaching for a beer next to his brother.
“John wasn’t concerned with Dean’s happiness and so Dean learned he shouldn’t be concerned with his.”
He could live without the late-night drives. He could live without the stolen conversations on deserted highways and near-empty diners. He could live without the closeness. He could live without the smiles. He couldn’t live knowing he hadn’t done all he could. He couldn’t.
No one would disturb him. And so, he’d close his eyes and let the grief swallow him whole. He’d lost his mom and he’d lost his dad and he’d lost his brother. And all he had to show for himself and all he had left of this life was Baby. Sturdy and unyielding.
Jody started rummaging through the tapes until she found a few she liked. She chuckled softly. “I’m surprised, not even the angel?”
They were standing in a park, several yards from the entrance of the hospital. Night had fallen. The sidewalk was illuminated by a dim streetlight. Castiel sat on the bench a few feet away. Crowley sat next to him but kept his distance.
Castiel nodded. This satisfied Dean, who then grabbed his clothes and made his way to the bathroom. Castiel watched him disappear and started reading.
Later, he would give himself time to think about all this. He would give himself time to grieve. Time, he hadn’t had after Mary died, time John hadn’t given him when he passed, but which Sammy had. Sam had told him to take some time for himself, and selfishly, he would.
Once they were on the highway, Castiel opened the glove compartment. Instead of taking out the box of cassettes, he pulled out a cassette that was on the side. Dean smiled. From the rear-view mirror, he could see Sam and his mom resting against each other’s heads. He turned to look at Castiel and said, “Go ahead, angel. They’re asleep.”
“Castiel, don’t you understand? It’s not up to you anymore. You aren’t God anymore. You never were. You were toying with godhood, with kingship. You were never very adept. I’m here to remind you of your true purpose. I’m here to remind you you’re a solider and Heaven needs its soldier boy.”
“I get that it’s a shock to see your kids as we are now. I had to meet a younger version of you who hadn’t met dad yet. So, if there’s anyone in this life who understands you, it’s me. But I can’t do this. I can’t do this, mom. I’ve lost too many people, but you feel further away now than you had ever been before. And it’s killing me.”
When God remade him, He remade him in His image. The humans were made in God’s image — not the angels and not the demons.
Saving the world required sacrifice and he had sacrificed enough. He had sacrificed his youth, his soul, his peace of mind, his chance at happiness. He had tortured people in hell. He had seen the people he loves die time and time again.
He stood then and walked over to the whiskey and served himself three fingers. Castiel didn’t object.
He could hear his breathing, slow and steady. He could feel his breath. Inhale, exhale. It had been a long time since they were this close. And he took great comfort in their closeness. They had been this close once before; before the Fall. The night before it was all to end. It didn’t end, of course, but there was no way they could’ve known. And he wouldn’t trade that night for the world.
“Now? Now, I understand everything. I think you do too. I forgive you for wanting to spare me, to spare me the pain of losing you forever, even though it meant losing you for a time.”
They had shared dreams before. Castiel eased his nightmares, they chatted about things they weren’t comfortable discussing in front of Sam, Mary, or other hunters. Often, they talked about Hell. The years Dean had been tortured and his time as a demon, torturing others.
He was relieved and in disbelief, and finally, he spoke. Words forming slowly, as if testing the waters.
Castiel waited until Sam had stepped out to pump gas before turning to Dean. Dean was looking out the window.
Castiel nodded solemnly. He didn’t need to say anything else. They both knew what Cas would go in to buy.
“Ah, that’s difficult to explain. I know, you’ve been possessed before, but I’m unsure you’ve ever bonded…”
Castiel was different, and things with him were different. Though the angel came and went as he pleased, he would always answer Dean’s call. And that had never been true with John. Besides, Cas wasn’t disappointed in him — not if the fond smile was anything to go by.
By the end of the conversation, they had exchanged numbers with the promise of keeping in contact. Dean never knew when they’d need to call on someone with their expertise, and it never hurt to make friends. Charlie would be proud.
“I didn’t realize it was this tense between them,” said Castiel. He took a seat at the table and Sam followed his lead.
Dean looked over and met Castiel’s gaze then quickly turned away. It felt like a betrayal to see Castiel sitting next to his mother. How was he supposed to win this argument with no back-up?
It was time. They could keep discussing the pros and cons for hours. This was an invasion of privacy, he knew. It was different now. There was no hellfire, just the sound of machines beeping and buzzing. He wasn’t on a mission. This wasn’t an order from up above. This was selfish. The pinnacle of selfishness. He needed Dean, alive and well. He needed him. And he couldn’t let go.
Castiel wasn’t surprised to see him cleaning. Dean did this often: whenever he was feeling unsure, whenever he was weighing his options. It brought him personal satisfaction, it killed time. It made him feel useful.
He titled Dean’s chin and Dean leaned into the touch. He held the mug with both hands and brought it to his lips. He took another sip and closed his eyes.
Jody had been hugging Sam, who came to stand next to Dean. “On the way home, mom and I will sit in the back. Haven’t had a chance to talk to her much,” he said.
Tonight, Dean found a book at the bottom of the duffle and he held it in his hands as he flipped through the pages. Once he reached the end, he turned to face Castiel. The seraph was sitting in the corner. Since they had finished their latest hunt, there was nothing more to investigate. Castiel he hadn’t brought a book, hoping for this exact moment.
John thought he was doing the right thing. He thought he was protecting Sam and Dean. He taught them how to protect themselves, how to put their wellbeing aside for the sake of others. Or maybe, that was just Dean. Maybe his lessons were just for Dean, because Sam could envision a different future for himself.
“Dad says we should just get back to normal,” said Patience. She nodded and then added, “Maybe he’s right.”
John had said he would have to save or kill Sam and God, Dean wished he had been able to save him. He had never wanted to kill his brother. Heaven had its plans and Heaven didn’t give a fuck what Dean wanted.
“I blamed myself, for weeks. Didn’t matter, Heaven had other plans. They got him out, sure, but he was under their control.”
But Dean’s memory was long. He remembered the fear in the voices of those demons in that diner in Illinois. They hadn’t understood, and thus feared, a being who could pull a soul out of Hell. And they were right to fear the angels. They were righteous and powerful.
If the endless staring unnerved him, as it once had, he didn’t say. Castiel would stop if asked, of course, but Dean hadn’t asked.
Dean shook his head. “No, maybe — hell, I don’t know. I had one girlfriend in high school and two more after I got my GED. Dad and I were always on hunts, so I didn’t have time to socialize. And I didn’t go away to college like Sammy.”
“If you fuck with me, you’ll be next. Surely, you know there are consequences to your actions. You can’t keep running around, doing whatever you please. Surely, you get that now?”
They spent the day in companionable silence. Castiel read from the book Dean had left on his desk, facedown. They had an understanding. Dean would read a book, and if he thought Castiel would like it or worth discussing, he would leave it facedown, for Castiel. Once he’d finished reading it, they’d discuss it. Sam wasn’t privy to their book discussions, of course.
They were in a motel. Sam had already showered and fallen asleep. His breathing was deep and slow. Castiel knew he would sleep soundly. Sam wasn’t plagued with nightmares, not the way Dean was.
He hadn’t said all he had in mind. Dean had come to pull him back into their bubble. This wonderful space they occupied when the lights were off, the doors were closed, and they weren’t worried about demons — past, present, and internal — waging war on them.
“Pamela — the psychic — had been touching the scar on my shoulder. It was in the shape of a handprint. I don’t have it anymore, haven’t had it for a long time, but Cas —”
“I see so much of you in Dean. You are his mother, of course, but it’s more than that. You’re kindred spirits. He struggles with the things you struggle,” said Castiel.
He asked, uncertain because all the things he knew had come crashing down on him. He was left in a world populated by unknown, unknowable things, and this was the time to ask questions.
“For the first time, he was happy. Your son was doing well in school. He was on the wrestling team — did you know your son loves wrestling? And he met a boy there, by the name Robin,” said Castiel.
“My mission was to save him. I hadn’t planned on… falling from grace, turning my back on Heaven, or falling in love. But I did, and I would do it over again.”
“What a year of fighting monsters and you’ve gone soft? Or is there another reason you can’t stand to watch?”
