So this is my first ever fanfic. Got an idea and rode with it. No brit picking, no beta, so any mistakes are mine and mine only.
“But if you are here, you must be looking for your brother-in-law then? What did you guys use for the baby, a surrogate? Is your partner injured as well as his brother? I saw you barking orders to the trainee healers, you sure surprised them, you know, dressed like that and all.”
"He gets what he wants. More freedom to do as he pleases with his Unspeakables. He proves his loyalty by standing next to her, and she leaves him to his own devices, which is precisely what my brother wants. That, and his wife as Head of the Auror Office. A black American woman as head of one of the most critical departments in the Ministry, a woman descended from a family of talented witches, some of those dark, well 'greyish', magic practitioners? Never. But it seems he got what he wanted. And Harry backs Alissa as his replacement. He hired her in the Deputy post, with references from MACUSA, and he is impressed by her abilities as a Seer and a fighter. They have great chemistry and respect each other. More than Mycroft and Hermione, at least. Harry can temper his sister-in-law and Alissa can deal with her husband. It's a win-win situation."
“Even so, Camille is dead. And there is no evidence Emilio is going to succeed finding Vittorio before the Fairies mount a full strategy here in London. I would prefer to avoid full Clave involvement on this affair and I really need your support on this.”
“This one, the stitches opened. You can let me redo them. Or something even better. Do you still trust me?”
“So we use transfiguration again. John, you can do it. You can transfigure something into a muggle weapon.”
“Jack, you idiot, I could kill you right now! You know, we all mourned you! Even James felt like shit for days without your unruly self to make his life impossible.”
“No, not anymore. My mother would have me at The Burrow too, she gave me a piece of her mind this morning, but this one is too important. So I evaded her coddling, at least for today.”
Sherlock didn’t seem to register Victor standing next to John, and as the other man cleared his throat, Sherlock saw him and only managed to harden his grip on John’s arms.
He turned to leave the room before Victor placed a hand on his shoulder. He turned around and saw the pleading eyes in the man’s face, begging him silently to stay. John stopped and looked at Sherlock. The detective was still glaring daggers at Victor and John, but after a few minutes, he seemed subdued. Diminished, even.
"I believe you, John. I still want to talk with Mycroft about this whole thing. Especially if you two are back together."
spell to make it look like me. Transfiguration and all the variants of the craft are his forte. He is a Metamorphmagus, and he was the cyclist who confounded you before you checked on me."
“That girl is going to need a good female role model growing around with the likes of you as her parents.”
"Yes, yes, I'm British, even though I finished my Magical education at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. You can guess why?"
John decided he'd rather ask now that they were alone, even if they were using someone else's memory for it.
“Good. If he was going with you, I would have to plead with you for footage of the hex your mum placed on him.”
. Maman is taking care of everything. She will see Madame Delglove’s real body delivered to her family.”
John felt lightheaded. Could he have been so blind after all this time? Did Sherlock love him as much as he loved him? Because he knew now what he felt, now that Mary and his promise to her seemed to be out of the picture, for now at least, because with
“I want to add that he has visitation rights on his own, and in case something happens to me, he is the other legal guardian of our daughter.”
“Your brother loves playing his little games, but I never knew someone outside the Ministry, other than some DA members, who knew the inner room of the Department of Mysteries. This feels wrong.”
"No. Madame Delglove's journal was in the pile of books. I'm going to read it, and I need to think, I'll probably require recalling every information I have about her, so my mind palace needs a proper sorting."
He said it exactly in John’s voice, with the same intonation. If it weren’t for the Johnny boy no one would have noticed it was not Dr John Watson who was speaking.
But after Sherlock finishes destroying the spider's web, he wants to come back. Will he be able to get John back?
Sherlock just glanced his way. He seemed to be thinking, but Victor just walked to him and opened his arms. Sherlock stepped into the embrace and started whispering to Victor’s ear. Victor held him tighter, and then released him and kissed his cheek, smirking. John guessed whatever Sherlock thought before; things were back to normal, whatever normal meant between them.
He felt more than heard Greg standing behind him, and he shrugged his suit jacket off, giving it to Lestrade, who has standing next to him, starkers, as any recently transformed werewolf would be. Greg, bless him, took the jacket and tied it to his front, shielding his nether regions from the cold but still leaving his very wonderful plush arse exposed. He risked a glance to his friend now, his chest with very sparse grey hair, his tattoo with the words and logo of the Praetor Lupus,
“Well, I know my way around weapons. And that is not something we can attempt to fight just with magic. We need weapons of our own. And even if we have them, we need to be able to deflect their power so that it only affects them, so that nothing backfires on us.”
“Ah, what a waste of those skills on muggle crime. I would bet a smart man like Harry Potter would like a man with that brain on his Auror team.”
“But by including you, it was done less suspiciously and the case remained in the Met’s jurisdiction. I thought you hated when I removed cases from your associates and reassigned them to my people.”
“It wasn’t safe to be near you until I was secured a good position, both in this world and in mundane world. I’ve convinced the Clave that my involvement in mundane affairs is a necessary evil, to ensure the protection of this country. Luckily, the Enclave has always supported me. Most of the Shadowhunters in this area are either very young, or old enough that they remember me as a little boy. Some of them I’ve trained myself.”
We are introduced to the London Shadowhunter Institute and their current leader, who recruits them for the case of the murdered Shadowhunter and Fairy. Sherlock's exceptional sight is finally explained as new secrets are revealed. They will try and solve the murders before the Clave gets involved, hopefully with the aid of the London Werewolf Pack.
“Yes, at school. My best friend from Hogwarts was a professional Quidditch player ‘til a few years ago; he is now a coach.”
"I can't promise anything, Tum, you'll have to negotiate with my brother. This, what you are asking, I don't think I can manage this time."
corridor, where, instead of opening the door to the central ward, Roman opened a side door to the left. The room was ample and well lit, but it still had that hospital feel, crisp and impersonal. Mycroft was sitting on the bed, sipping what looked like a very disgusting potion from a glass, at least that was what John could get from the look on his face. His suit looked wrinkled, and his tie was loose around his neck, but he looked otherwise unharmed. Alissa was holding his hand, her face had a couple of bruises, but John couldn’t see much more. She was apparently still angry at her husband.
Sherlock sighed and let John go. John pulled on his pants and trousers, as Sherlock opened the door. Of course, the housekeeper was looking at them with an impatient frown.
John tried to process all the new information he had. They slipped into a comfortable silence for a while. Sherlock drank, making a face each time the whiskey touched his lips.
“It’s dangerous now, darling, with the Cold Peace. You know the new accords basically forbid interaction with the Fae, especially dallying in the courts. You’ll have Shadowhunters breathing on your neck in no time.”
Sherlock placed his hand on top of his childhood's friend one, her face filled with quiet joy and amusement, certainly what you would expect of someone like Luna Lovegood while seeing a long lost friend for the very first time in years.
“God Tiger, YOU ARE BRILLIANT! I could kiss you right now if I didn’t know Miff would curse me on the spot.”
“Mummy dearest. Lovely to see you again. It took a dreadfully long time to reunite all of us again. Daddy inside?”
), they were still dancing around each other and hiding reactions, but right now it seemed that Sherlock didn’t even care if John noticed he was acting a little bit possessive around him. And John couldn’t be happier.
“It was not your fault. We had to catch Moran before he wreaked havoc over the British Magical Community. Our daughter will not resent us days she won’t remember. Now, stop it.”
Victor emerged from his blinking and happily interrupted the discussion. Sherlock obliviated him a second time. Alissa walked to her husband's sleeping form, her face filled with pain as he reached to touch his face.
Oliver just stood in the background, looking around with a bit of discomfort. He was wearing his muggle clothes, and John could say he looked fine in them.
They crossed the door, and Sherlock gathered all the information we could from just a glance. He knew he had to be right. When he read some of the added pages and recognized a name, he was sure about coming here. He needed answers, and this was the place to get them. And, surely, he was positively smug when they opened the door to the studio and sitting in the desk was none other than Mycroft Holmes. John looked like he could use an orange blanket, and the other two were a little alarmed by his face alone.  Mycroft’s eyes left the book he was studying, and a look of annoyance marked his face as Sherlock told the rest of the group.
John laughed, and all eyes turned to him, Mycroft raising his eyebrows and Harry with an alarmed look. Clearly she thought John was going to offend Sally and Molly, so they will try to rip his limbs off. She didn't now they already knew John and his twisted sense of humor. But Greg was smirking, and the women looked as relaxed as they could be with powerful Downworlders invading their territory.
John left the Ministry of Magic quickly, apparating inside a cupboard in the clinic, where he had stashed his muggle clothes. He quickly changes, holding his robes in his hands. The clinic was full of people at that time of the day, so John was extremely careful to fold the clothes in a pair of surgical scrubs. He left the cupboard and saved the bundle in his locker. He walked to the reception and chatted with the receptionist, and was able to give a warm and heartfelt answer when she asked about Mary. It had been months since they both worked together, Mary quitting when all disaster struck.
“All of you must perform latching spells on Gabrielle. Everyone, when I say so, release the handle, but don’t close your door. You might experience some motion sickness but walk to Gabrielle following your bindings to her. When you release the handle, Elle, take a step in.”
Simon Lovelace is a former vampire now turned Shadowhunter who is the current boyfriend of Alec Lightwood's sister Isabelle, both of them are members of the New York Enclave (more about them in chapters to come)
John found himself feeling very sorry for the so-called Iceman, who in the end, cared a lot about his own family. His brothers, his wife, they made John see Mycroft in a different light. He always knew he loved Sherlock, and John couldn't even begin to imagine how much he loved his twin brother.
Sherlock started circling the woman, like a bird of prey, and John could recognize that look anywhere. He was close to a break in the case, as remotely and ridiculous as it could possibly be at this point.
Victor and John get to know each other a little better, and Sherlock doesn't have to like it. John manages to surprise him once again.
John rose from his position on the floor, and pulled Sherlock up, both of them rounding on Alissa, but she gracefully rose, looking just a little dishevelled with all the effort. Her eyes went purple, and she shivered.
“No, I told you Harry was short for Harriet, which is true. That is the name she is currently using.”
"On the same page as always. Anything else we can gather here? Should we send the rest of the team to retrieve the bodies? Do we need to notify any next of kin?"
“Sherlock, yes, well someday you are going to know how to drive this thing. Almost as good as the Doctor, he said it himself.”
John huffed, if he remembered correctly the blood replenishing potion was anything but easy to brew. Victor did it again, and Gabrielle jumped in, and they didn’t even waste time as she started healing him on the spot, so they could finally get Harry in.
“Ahhh, but I did, you see. I’m a married man now! A family man! This strapping young lad who came to get you and your detective is my eldest son, Ianto.”
He was in full doctor mode, and his tone of command was evident when he encountered the lime green robed healers. Two of them approached them, and the youngest one even raised an eyebrow at John, who was still wearing his muggle clothing, as he never bothered to tap his wand to his jacket.
"See? I told you that Watson fellow was tapping into my brain! How can you explain him knowing my imaginary friend? Well, now we can, easily, because Sherlock was real darling! He was hiding among the muggles for some reason. Maybe that is why he never sent an owl."
“Cheers. Well, I don’t want it to disappear, but it’s the only scar I have that’s worth working on, so…”
“You read Dracula? I thought you would have deleted it. Well, artistic liberty from Mr. Stoker, but the name existed. Dracula was a modification of a name. The name of the high priest of the cult who first introduced vampirism into the world. They made a deal with a demon, and got infected with the vampire virus. I was a doctor in the Netherlands at the time, and I was intrigued. Then I got mad. Then I killed a bunch of vampires. Some of them escaped, and their spawn hate me. So I’ve kept my head low for a couple of centuries. The last time a vampire nest got an inkling of my location it was a bit not good. For the vampires, I mean.”
John turned to Sherlock, a surprised look on his face, but Sherlock just caught his gaze, giving him his best ‘you know you trust my judgement’ look. He then sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose once again before addressing his sister.
Harry looked at Sherlock then, trying to grasp what she missed before. She soon had a resigned look.
So John’s life was disappearing before his eyes, when he met an old mate from medical school. He had gone back, as he did many times in his lifetime, to refresh his knowledge and get his title once again. Mike Stamford greeted him. And Mike Stamford introduced him to Sherlock Holmes.
She said it with such a conviction that John wondered what this woman knew or believed about him, then she walked and locked her arm in his.
John just nodded. He was a little overwhelmed by the trust placed in him by both brothers, and Victor, who decided he was better suited to be Sherlock handler.
"Got your message, Lissa, this will be temporary, yes? I have to go through Hermione if you plan on making this one a permanent part of the network. You could also use Mrs Hudson's fireplace, you know, hers has always been properly linked."
“Then you deserve a scolding as well, John Watson, you and Mycroft are supposed to be the reasonable ones here. I guess you are leaving all the thinking for the women in this family then.”
Both men did as she said. John couldn't help to notice Victor's muscular arms as he grabbed him, and could feel his magic passing on to Victor.
“Add a phoenix tail to the mix, and we have the perfect wand for the most unusual man in the world.”
"Since I'm wandless, and Alissa is not going to stop you, I don't see how I have much choice. But I trust you; you know that. If you say I need to forget, I'll even forget my name."
A red headed man, tall and fair skinned with brown eyes appeared from nowhere right then. He had a mischievous look on him and a megawatt smile that he directed to John.
Sherlock was about to tell him the exact number; John saw his scrunched face and predicted this was the case before he stopped him.
They soon reached their destination, and John shadowed Sherlock as he proceeded to exit the TARDIS. They were standing in the foyer of what seemed a very elegant place, the restaurant if he remembered well what Rory said. Surely his mind was running on pure adrenaline,
John found himself holding his wife's arm in the sitting room of 221B. Sherlock was sitting in his chair, back in his muggle clothes, and Alissa Holmes, also in muggle attire, was holding his hand, perched on the arm of it. A mousy looking man with a big grin on his face was standing near the window, and a beautiful woman with platinum blond hair was next to him. Mary looked startled but managed to regain her composure as soon as she saw Sherlock. She stared directly at his hand in Alissa's an looked at John as searching for answers in his face. Alissa was the first to break the silence.
They reached the Institute soon enough, the regal building daring them to go in, right in the middle of Fleet Street. Sherlock had finished the book in less than an hour, and then started pestering Magnus and John with questions about Shadowhunters. John guessed one of the rooms in the Mind Palace just started filling with information about the Shadow World, but he was a little worried about the detective’s interest in Shadowhunters. Because they were secretive, they were stern and took a liking for people with the sight. A liking that could result in Sherlock getting killed serving the Clave. Which was the last thing in the world that John wanted. As soon as they crossed the gates, Sherlock saw a girl and a pretty buff boy talking among themselves in the cemetery, laughing. Pretty sure they were ghosts. He wanted to ask John, because he felt elated being able to finally share the things he saw with someone.
"This, John, is the most valuable book in the magical world. The Book of the Dead, the real thing, filled with ancient Egyptian magic, some of it the darkest magic in magical history. This book can raise the dead John, really recall their souls from beyond the veil. And a lot of other terrible things, some good, some bad, some unmentionable and unthinkable. He wanted to bring Jim back, at any cost. We interrupted him, stopped him. If he gets his hands on this, there is no stopping him."
John started concentrating, the three Ds again in his mind, aiming for the outside of the warehouse. He could feel the tug, so he stopped using his wand, concentrating all of his magic on getting them out of there.
Alissa was panting, fear all over her face as she moved to grab the rock and touch it. Sherlock was angry, started pointing his wand and sending random spells at the boulder, accomplishing nothing. John stepped closer to the rock and began circling it, trying to remember Victor’s wand movements, which were useless without the words, anyway. Sherlock gave up and paced, Harry and Gabrielle were looking at the rest of them with astonished glares, and some reluctance, like the whole situation couldn’t be real. As John relentlessly continued to repeat Victor’s movements, the rock morphed again in his face, and the only thing he heard was Victor calling “Johnny!” from inside as he stepped in, and the foundation closed again.
John was shocked to hear that his friend had been so close, so near from him at that time. He tried to remember every sorting from all his years at Hogwarts, and he couldn't remember a boy who looked even remotely like Sherlock.
“That! That’s the John Watson I know! Captain, nice! A man who fought the Daleks along the Doctor with no fear whatsoever.”
John snickered at this. He could see it now. Probably half of the Yard was composed by werewolves. They soon reached the fifth floor, the lift opened to a well-lit hallway with a good carpet and some tables with ornamental vases and dried flowers. This floor had only three doors in it, and Mycroft and Harry continued walking to the door at the end of the hallway. Mycroft knocked and soon the door opened, revealing a chain lock and the face of a very annoyed Molly Hooper.
"Yes, and you would be in Azkaban for cruelty against muggles or Merlin knows what. So spare me the indignation, however rightful. My little brother puts himself in the line of danger too much these days, and I want to keep you both out of Azkaban or muggle prison for the time being."
He commented as he finally shook the man’s left hand. He didn’t feel any different, and he just barely noticed Victor’s green eye changing into the cat-like orange he had the day before.
“Yes. She is the most ruthless vampire in that nest. It seems there was an internal power struggle and Emilio conveniently decided to bolt to Spain. Rumor has it he is looking for her sire, so that he can make her step down.”
“It doesn’t matter. I was just wondering. When you flirted with Victor, was it only because Victor is what he is?”
Mycroft looked from his chair at the term of endearment and started walking to the other room. Victor motioned for John to follow him, and as John left the room with Victor, he felt Sherlock move and position himself just behind him. Mycroft closed the door behind them, and then he talked directly to Sherlock.
The neonatologist walked out of the room, and Mycroft went to speak to her, sending her to John. She looked very professional, a no-nonsense kind of woman.
And both their guests disappeared into the Police Box that was currently parked in the middle of 221B. How did they fit that in here? John guessed that was a question, among others, that their guests must answer. As soon as possible. Sherlock was already entering that damned contraption and he was damned himself if he was letting his, yes, his, detective go alone.
“When Harry said his name. I simply knew. And I confirmed it when I saw that my mother’s maiden name was a common Shadowhunter family name, originally from France, as my mother’s family.”
John was pretty sure Sherlock was dead. Mycroft never answered his texts back, no doubt still wanting John as far away from Sherlock as possible. Not knowing anything for two years was bad enough for John, but he had stuff to distract him. A string of texts.
“Don’t tell me that was defence, Sherlock. I know defence when I see it. That was one of the darkest spells I’ve ever seen that isn’t an Unforgivable Curse.”
“Really? That is barely a four, Sherlock. The bodies are probably stashed somewhere near the alley.”
“I changed my mind darling; I call dibs on John going with you. Could you join us with Mac for a moment?”
“Victor, if you want me to continue repairing your skin, you will refrain to use innuendo on my partner.”
“The delivery was fast; she is a small baby. She is doing fine, they decided to intubate more as a precaution than anything, and they gave her a dose of surfactant. She had an echocardiogram and a brain ultrasound, and so far everything seems fine. Mary’s blood pressure was dangerously elevated, so they decided to go forward with labour rather than hold it.”
That said with a feral smile and a look that revealed whatever it was that made John Watson one of the scariest supernatural beings alive this day and age. Sherlock looked at him like he couldn’t believe someone like John existed, and everyone was silent for what it seemed ages, until Mycroft cleared his throat.
“It’s like their embassy. They have them everywhere so they can control the demon plague. There is one right here in London.”
So this is my first fanfic, I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, no brit picking or betas so any mistakes are mine and mine only.
Delivered in his best Captain Watson tone, and Sherlock stopped arguing. He opened the door of the room and left, probably to fetch the new dress robes Victor had bought for his birthday. John decided against a shower and decided that Victor’s scarlet robes were the best ones he had, so he was about to put them on when Sherlock came back with a set of dark blue robes on his hands.
Oliver hummed at the confidence, even after all these years, their friendship seemed like it could now go on without suffering. His gaze kept wandering away from the conversation, to the two friends, former lovers really, that seemed to have stopped arguing and kept dancing. John figured out it was time to let that particular cat out of the bag.
So Sherlock was spending a sleepless night in his mind palace, so John couldn't really help much. He dragged himself up the stairs and collapsed on the bed without changing.
"Even though John would've looked dashing with green robes, you only say that because you are still mad Victor made you kiss him."
"My wife is just learning about the magical world right now. Is it indispensable to remove her to Cornwall right now?"
He decided to leave the bed finally, walking the stairs in the same clothes he wore the day before. Sherlock was on the sofa now, quietly brooding, with his hands as in prayer near his chin. John knew saying good morning wouldn’t produce any response now, so he busied himself making tea and getting biscuits out of a tin. John placed a cup near Sherlock, and sat in his chair, drinking his tea quietly. He needed to see his wife in Cornwall. He told Sherlock so, getting no reply again. He sighed, took his wand out and apparated out of the flat.
"Yes, she was here a couple of hours ago. She is at the house for the night, should you care to join us for dinner. It is time Lissa met John, dear brother, now that he will be joining the team."
It was over as soon as it started. They were back outside the warehouse, a little smoked and ashes in their clothes but otherwise unharmed. John began to pant, drained, bending his body to get some air. Sherlock crouched, also exhausted, but as he recovered, he started to walk towards John as if some unknown gravity pulled him. He touched John’s back, and John felt a tingle where the detective made contact.
"I knew it. I knew something was off from the beginning. I knew you both were hiding something. I thought...but anyway, your secret is worse than I imagined."
“Yes, he is useless now. His soul is irreparably fragmented. He is the equivalent of an empty husk, like a man who received a Dementor’s kiss.”
Molly blushed, and cleared her throat, looking at Greg, who made up his mind and started speaking again.
“I’m sorry to interrupt the trip down memory lane again, but we have pressing matters to attend to. As High Warlock of London, it’s my business to involve myself with matters of the Downworld. One of the high ranking knights of the Seelie court was murdered today. The Seelie Queen is still in hiding and the Unseelie King suspects a Shadowhunter murdered the knight. We don’t know if the Shadowhunter had a cause to attack, but the King seems to think the quarrel came unprovoked. Apparently a vampire was witness to the attack, and said the boy leapt at the fairy with for no reason at all.”
“Aliens. Now you are talking about sodding aliens. That’s it, get the fuck out of our flat!!! And take that contraption with you!”
She pressed her phone to Mummy’s hands and started showing her the pictures, while Mummy cooed both a Victoria and at the baby pictures. Sherlock rolled his eyes as Sherry was trying to serve him a full English breakfast and he kept removing things from his plate.
"Other brother? You had another brother? I thought the times Mycroft mentioned something about that he was joking."
“It won’t take us long to get there, don’t worry, but if finding my Grandfather takes more than a day I’m sure you would appreciate a place to sleep in. Agora at the time in history we are visiting is not the most welcoming planet in the universe.”
"She sees memories. Strong ones. Some are strong enough to last a lifetime, and some are there for a little while. She can summon them if they are recent or strong enough. The ones we see right now are not the summoned kind, just powerful ones that lingered. Every place has a few or many of those memories. She sees this all the time, everywhere."
“Task force, government. Mycroft is one of the higher ups, don’t really know their whole scope but I know it’s one of the agencies Mycroft directs from the background.”
"Yes, even though her sacrifice is as enormous as you are becoming. She should start you on a diet. And don't start with the nonsense of cravings, it is your wife the one who is pregnant, and you are going to be bigger than her soon enough."
The women looked disappointed, and John gave them a chastising look. One of them had the decency to look embarrassed. John herded their party to the fireplace and waited until only them remained before telling him.
John had barely managed to finish his breakfast. He stood up from the table, as Victor waved slowly at him, with a grin on his face that should have been illegal. The car was waiting for them at the door as promised, and they rode silently on the back of the vehicle, Sherlock grabbing John’s hand as soon as they sat comfortably in the car. One of the things John loved about being with Sherlock was that silence was rarely uncomfortable between them. They reached the hospital soon enough.
all around them. He found spells in the door handles and motioned both of his partners to stay clear of them. The detective touched the door experimentally, as John’s eyes went wide with apprehension, but nothing happened. He pushed the door, which didn’t budge an inch, before casting
Alissa helped her husband out of bed, and she rearranged his tie for him. The man leaned on her for support, and John started to doubt if leaving St. Mungo’s today was such a good idea after all. To hell with it. They still had a lot of work to do, and Mycroft had proved invaluable to this case, by actually doing the legwork he so utterly despised.
He pulled his wand and pen and paper appeared out of nowhere. He leaned on the table and started rubbing the pencil over the paper, writing showing on the blank page with each pass of it.
Instead of surprising him, it seemed that only made Oliver more interested in Victoria. John tried to lock eyes with her, but his height and her mob of admirers made it an impossible task. Sherlock saw what he was trying to do, and he walked to the group of people and rudely extracted Victoria from her fans, who walked behind her and followed until he gave them another look. They probably thought he was going to curse them because they backed out, but kept observing Victoria from the sidelines, waiting for their next opportunity. The woman in question laughed at Sherlock, who was whispering something apparently funny in her ear.
John was starting to despise that witch. Even Irene Adler naked before Sherlock had been less irritating than his friend admitting to him he ran off after a woman and left him talking to an empty grave. Sherlock was staring at John, with a piercing gaze that dawned on comprehension.
"So are you both back living with each other? Your brother should have told me if that was the case, he needs to increase your surveillance from muggle to magical whenever you are living in close quarters with someone who has a wand, he knows that. I told your sister the same thing when she moved in with you. But I didn't know you knew Dr Watson here is a wizard. I will be having words with your brother, Mr Holmes. Lead the way."
"Oh! So you are a muggle healer too! I've always wanted to know if their muggle animal healing could apply to some magical creatures. Always prepare yourself for the field, in case an emergency finds the wizard and the magical creature in need without a wand."
It was John’s turn to almost fall, and Sherlock was right behind him, holding him steady. Mycroft hung up, as his wife emerged from the fireplace, and his head went into the fire instead. He came out a few minutes after, with a silver spoon in his mouth.
. It will take us there in two hours. Enough for you to decide with Potter which team you want to take.”
“I understand. You respected your partner’s wishes. I’ll send word to my mother immediately. Will I see you tomorrow for dinner? Or you would rather mourn your partner with a clear mind, now that the curse lifted.”
John followed her instructions to the letter, and he went to meet his daughter. She was small, and he could see scarce blond hair, so blond it was almost white. Her skin was pale and wrinkled, and John thought she was the most fragile and most beautiful thing in the whole world. The doctor was standing next to him, and told him,
“Well, you, maybe. But what about Sherlock? You know you are risking him. If the Shadowhunters find him interesting…”
John had missed an entire conversation between Sherlock and the head nurse. Apparently, their little girl was ready to join the rest of their family. John couldn’t help releasing a breath he didn’t know he was holding and kiss his daughter’s forehead. Home, maybe soon they could both be going home to 221B. Back home, with Sherlock. He was waiting for the dream to be over, to wake up again in the suburbs with Mary. But it seemed he finally got some good coming his way.
John had produced a Patronus a couple of times before, while fighting in the Wizarding War, grasping on memories of his time with Oliver and his family. He wasn’t even sure he could produce a corporeal Patronus now even if he tried. Happy memories were hard to come by these days. On a whim, he pulled out his wand, focusing on the memories he just spent arranging together in the scrapbook.
"We can leave now. I don't think the rest of the memory would yield as much information as this bit. The murder was so straightforward that it leaves no place for deduction, no place for further investigation. But it let us have a good look at Moran's new body."
Victor moved, and sat right beside him in the bed, took his hand in his. He wondered why he let this man, who he barely knew, take his hand and comfort him. But it felt safe, human contact, something that everyone secretly craves.
“It’s named after a magical creature, much like a phoenix, that you can see only in America. My father was British, like his father, but his mother was American, and they moved around a lot, so he attended Ilvermony. It was his house too. This ring and this”- he pulled out his wand, jet black with beautiful polished wood -“are my favorite things in the whole world. Both heirlooms, mind you, this wand chose me after choosing my father, his mother before that. It has been in my family since the early 1900’s. This wand is called a Wolfe wand. Wolfe was a Native American wandmaker, and his wands have Thunderbird core. This one is ebony, and one of the last ones that still exist in the magical world.”
“Back home. His home is in London. He was the High Warlock for ages, it’s his city, as well as mine.”
The next time, when he himself was away at public school, they took a trip to London. As they walked through Fleet Street, Sherlock got distracted by a beautiful building that looked just like a castle. Through the gates, he could see two young men, clearly brothers, one with a bookish look in his face and the other with a mischievous grin on his face.
“I think it’s better if it’s us and maybe Harry and one or two of the best aurors in the office. It will be easier to surprise him if fewer people are lurking that he can detect. He doesn’t know we will be coming his way.”
It was John’s turn to speak now, and he was still a little angry at Sherlock. The man was apparently sulking because of what happened before between Victor and him.
His French was terrible, but he understood that. He didn't know why she was saying that then, though.
Victoria kissed her goddaughter on the forehead and John took a picture with his mobile. Finally, things started to look good for him; he had a future and a big extended family for his daughter. He and Sherlock still needed to sort things out, and he still wasn’t sure if he wanted to continue his life as a muggle or join the magical community with his daughter and partner. The nurse told them visiting hours were almost over, and Sherlock used his full charm mode to negotiate twenty more minutes. John practically had to wrestle his daughter out of Victoria’s arms, and the lights flickered as they said their goodbyes, causing Victoria to go back to the cradle and whisper things to the baby, which seemed to work.
"John, we are now going into my sister's memory. Her view of the world can be disturbing to one who is unused to the input. I have perused her memory many times, and so has my brother, and he still finds it somewhat disturbing sometimes. If you need to come out of it, just touch your wand to your temple, and we will come out. If needed I'll go back inside by myself. Don't feel ashamed if you need that. It sometimes works to close your eyes if the flood of information is too much. Also, some places feel charged with more spiritual energy than others. For example, when I saw a memory of our time at Beauxbatons, the whole spiritual energy within the school made me vomit. I can't imagine how she stands to visit the place."
"Witches and wizards are living in hiding all over the world. We have our laws, our governments. High ranking officials in the regular government know about us and keep the secret. We are only allowed to tell our significant other when we marry someone who is not from our world, someone not magical. We call non-magical folks muggles."
“Simon was turned against his will, and he never indulged in drinking from humans, at least not by choice, only by accident. He was a good boy who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
“Blah, blah, blah. I didn’t know Stephen even had a parabatai. I think Jace would like to meet him, he would be curious to know his father’s brother in arms. Tessa says hi by the way, so does Jem, I saw them recently. Why do you carry around so many grudges? Geez, you have to let it go one of these days.”
Sherlock's eyes widened a little, before setting his face back to his unexpressive mask. John tried his best to maintain his composure.
John started to feel angry again. He heard the tone of doubt and betrayal in Sherlock's voice. God knows he was used to his own when speaking to his mad friend.
He wasn’t surprised to see his duffel bag, the one he had brought to 221B, in one of the chairs by the small fireplace. Mycroft’s place was like a mansion. He went into the bathroom and changed into pyjama bottoms and a T-shirt, while he heard Sherlock open the door to the other room. He took his wand out of his robes and brought it with him into the bedroom. He found the lanky wizard on the left side of the bed, with the blue journal on his lap, and his laptop opened and plugged, already in pyjama bottoms with nothing on his top. Sherlock had placed his wand and wand holder on the night table. John could see the pale round scar were Mary had shot him.
Roman looked concerned at this statement, fidgeting with the need of pleasing this particular patient and his knowledge of poison safety.
The man in question had a piercing stare placed on his mother-in-law and boss, and as it seemed that by the pure force of his will, they summoned him to form part of the conversation taking place. He could see both Hermione and Harry following Mycroft's movements with the corner of their eyes. The head of the Auror office, whose dress robes looked a lot like John's, only in a dark shade of green, was talking with a tall blond man with a long pointy face and a ponytail who was wearing dark robes like Sherlock. He looked concerned but was trying, and not succeeding, to keep a nonchalant demeanour. Some political game was currently developing in front of their eyes. Sherlock at least seemed amused by it.
John had vague memories of Percy’s jumpers and Christmas morning, the one time he stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas. Most of the time he spent Christmas at the Wood’s, his family.
Victor was running towards them now, the moment lost. His clothes had rips everywhere, and he was bleeding from multiple puncture wounds. Puncture wounds. Looking at them closer, John realised those were bites.
“A modification from the name both me and Harry chose once, we were called the Sun Twins. She liked Watson, she spent a lot of her time in Scotland, at least a couple of hundred years, as did I. In the Shadow World, the ones who still know me, they know me as John Sun or John Watson. The ones who used to know me and want to kill me still used to know me as Johannes Van Helsing or Johann Sun, the twin.”
John awoke in a sweat, as he took a minute to take in his surroundings. He was in his room at Baker Street, and it was already morning. The doctor took a moment to analyse his dream. Of course, he now knew he remembered Sherringford Holmes. How could a sweet boy like that end up a Death Eater? And the look on Mycroft’s face when he slapped his twin. Of course, he didn’t remember Mycroft from school, the Mycroft he knew had no real friends, was a real loner, before he knew about Alissa, that is. You couldn’t see red-haired Slytherin boy at school anywhere but the Quidditch pitch without his twin brother.
John walked into the room, closing the door behind him. Mary was asleep in her bed, looking peaceful and relaxed. John checked the monitor, her heart rate and blood pressure were back to normal ranges. He felt a pang in his chest. John should have been there for his wife; he should have been by her side as she pushed their baby into the world. The room was big, and he moved a chair to sit by his wife, holding the hand not attached to any monitor.
“You have to. Besides, John is going to work with me on his present for you, and you are not going to ruin his surprise, so William, you will behave for once in your life and do what you are told.”
Sherlock glanced to the kitchen, where Harry Watson, or whatever she called herself was standing. She was wearing a black leather jacket, and matching black leather trousers, with a pink cropped tank top. Clearly John didn’t share his siblings taste for clothes. He glanced back at the baggy oatmeal jumper and plain trousers he was currently wearing. Maybe he wore them to make the impression he was older, he suspected that was the reason for the mustache too. Harry went straight to Magnus and wrapped her arms around the taller man’s neck. She gave him a kiss on every cheek.
"Yes, he is also amazingly skilled at transfigurating anything else. Most of my dresses and Sherlock's Belstaff for example."
“She is doing well. We only intubated her for the dose of surfactant, and now she has a clear halo to aid with her breathing. She is only an hour old, though, so we need to observe her closely for a couple of days. I heard her mother was doing well, and when she wakes she can come and visit the baby. Do you want to go in? There are clean gowns through this door, and a sink for hand washing and gloves.”
"Mycroft is a Wizard?? Well, I shouldn't be surprised, somehow it fits. He knows about me for sure. Works for the Ministry of Magic? Mmm, Mycroft has the Weasley's hair, I should have noticed."
Mycroft reached for his wand again, and waved it up and down, then sent his hand into the nothingness in front of him. His hand disappeared, and out of thin air, he produced a beautiful wand, carved with stars, made of a type of wood John didn't recognise. He gave the wand to Sherlock, who grabbed it and kissed the tip like a little boy holding his most cherished toy.
"I checked, and double checked the body. I swear I didn't found any use of metamorphic magic. Dark Arts are not my area, as you usually say, darling. Maybe if Mac here had a chance reviewing the body, or you. But I didn't think anything like that could be at play. He was supposed to be powerful, yes, but that meant a man that could hold his part in a magic duel, not a dark lord. Skilled in combat magic, that was all the information we had to work with."
“I’m going to try the healing spell on myself before I offer to do it for Sherlock. I want you there in case I do it wrong and end bleeding to death or something like that.”
John laughed, and Oliver pulled into a hug. John breathed him in, still the same familiar smell after all this time. Oliver kissed his hair. John’s eyes felt moist, a single tear running down his cheek. He pulled back from the hug and looked at his long-lost brother’s eyes for the first time in years.
So John paired with Jia, and he had a lot of fun, slicing demons into small pieces with his long sword. He practically fought the whole thing without using magic, but he felt as he loaned his strength and some of his protective magic to Jia. He was a master swordsman, but he also carried a gun, filled with magical bullets that carried ugly curses for demons. But he preferred his sword, because since the gun was his trademark, it was easier for vampires, who decided to join the fight mysteriously late, to identify him. He also had a wonderful crossbow, but that he reserved mostly for vampires who got on his nerves a long time ago. So, not the ideal weapon either.
“Well, I was in the middle of a Dalek attack and stuff happened. Also, Ianto is not my friend, we’ve just met.”
Sebastian Wilkes was looking at him, clearly annoyed, wondering why Sherlock was wasting everybody’s time. So, once again, it was all in his head.
“Shush. You are speaking Gaelic. And not even the one I understand, you are speaking the Scottish Gaelic. Everything will be alright. Glamour yourself to look however you want.”
“All the magic here really messes with my 3DS. I guess I’ll have to finish this one later. It keeps failing to save my progress.”
"Yes. Mycroft was, along with Severus Snape and precious few others, a spy for the Order of the Phoenix. He was never into hiding, keeping his place in the Ministry. But he revealed his cover the day of the Battle of Hogwarts. That was the day my older brother, who was a Death Eater, was sent to kill the Muggle Prime Minister and his twin had to stop him. Both of them were master duelers, and Mycroft managed to subdue him. But when he lost his wand, my brother killed himself with the muggle revolver the Prime Minister had pulled out to defend himself. Mycroft was never the same ever since."
After that, Mary seemed to relax somewhat. John knew he was committing to something that will end life as he knew it. But he was willing to do whatever it took for his daughter, and his daughter's safety and well being will depend on having her mother by her side. A happy mother. A happy mother and father. Well, a happy mother.
Alissa stepped out and started chanting with her wand in hand. Her eyes changed, and the usually violet pupil turned into full violet eyes. She looked fully immersed in a type of trance, walking into the room and standing there silent for a few minutes. Harry observed with interest, staying out of the way as she walked around the room. Suddenly she stopped, and her eyes went back to normal.
"Harry and Alissa can't see or hear us. But we can listen to them, see what they see. This one is from Harry's point of view, so what he saw will be highlighted."
“Well, yes. You become insufferable unless you have eaten first. Probably something to do with old age and blood sugar.”
He touched his robes again, which became longer, and only one of his eyes changed to an eerie green as he towered Sherlock in height, the detective as tall as his nose now. His voice, a cheery tenor, same cadence as the woman John just heard speaking a moment ago, only with more masculine tone and embedded with mischief.
Victor flipped a finger his way, still cleaning his mouth. Harry cleared his throat and continued talking.
“And now I won’t be able to erase this from my mind. Thanks that would be something to remember on my bed during these lonely nights. But I have a solution to your dilemma; I don’t want Miff to lose one of his favourite licking spots. Allow me.”
John was smirking at Mycroft now, and Sherlock was rubbing his finger in small circles against his back. Alissa just rolled her eyes at them.
As they left, Sherlock's gaze followed them. He seemed to be analysing possible scenarios in his mind, deducing, organising his thoughts. John was fascinated at how much he knew the man by his side; he could predict what Sherlock was thinking about right now.
"But she only has one sister, and I thought she only had that niece that usually visits her, not that I've ever seen her."
“I’m going to end up dead, aren’t I? I should have known something like that was up when my Patronus changed. After all, that’s how you call a group of crows. Well, as much as I enjoy present company, I shouldn’t spend my last days on this earth away from other people in my family. It’s time to pay auntie a visit.”
“Of course I mean it. I’ve known you for just a couple of days, and you’ve saved my life more than once, you’ve proven you are a loyal and good friend. I already named her after you. Besides, Sherlock has known you for ages, and he still likes you, and that’s saying a lot coming from him. I let you call me awful nicknames and Johnny without punching your lights out. I think that says enough.”
They both walked to Sherlock, and each of them grabbed one arm. Well, Victor linked his fingers around his left hand, and John grabbed his wand arm just above the elbow. They both repeated the spell, John feeling a little faint as his magic drained into Sherlock as the detective touched his wand to his sister's temple and said, "
"Oh? If you are talking about she being able to be whoever the fuck she likes, Oliver already knows."
“Gregory, it was the only way, someone called the mundane police on this, and instead of rerouting it through the appropriate channels the thing wound up in DI Hopkins’s desk. Surely you can see your involvement was necessary to ensure that he would retire from the crime scene, no questions asked.”
“Sherlock, Victor, this is an old friend of mine, Roman Hudson, who is now the Head Healer here at St. Mungo’s. We were checking on Mycroft before, who, if he gets his way, is getting a discharge to the manor house. Roman, this is my partner, Sherlock Holmes, and my good friend Victor Trevor.”
“He has an interesting rivalry with Ginny and her team. He was a great captain. I never saw you play, mate.”
"You can't change your mind every two or so years, Victor. I have to remind you. You broke up with me. And John, don't shake his left hand, unless you want him to be able to transform into you."
"As fascinating as this discussion about Quidditch is, it seems my brother, now done with his political scheme, requires our presence. John."
“I supposed it’s better if no one opens it, I gather. I won’t ask who is responsible for this, because I know. But as you know, this better remain in this room.”
John was sitting in his chair. This room always looked like 221B. Like home. Redbeard was curled in the rug, and John was petting his head. Oh, Redbeard. Was he dying now?
“Well, she is. She’s a mean killing machine, when she’s not dancing around with fairies. And this is the other half of the fighting duo. This is my brother, John Watson, formerly known as Johannes Sun. And I’m sure you know the other name he once held, and the reason I need to keep him away from the vampires.”
“She is like Maryse in a good way. And no doubt your dealings with her limited to when she was a member of the Circle. Maryse has changed a lot, through the years.”
Alissa said, undoubtedly thinking about what she could give the wall that would let her pass to the other side.
Sherlock was glaring at him now. He was angry, and John could see why, but he was not letting him go against unknown forces of the Shadow World, even if it meant an angry detective sulking around the flat. Even if Sherlock kicked him out. At that precise moment, a portal appeared in their sitting room. Sherlock’s eyes widened, before setting in the usual mask John recognized as disguising his thoughts and feelings.
John was not good at this. He tried to convey his feelings in those few words, looking back at Sherlock, trying to make him fix his gaze on him. Sherlock gave him a sad smile he had only seen a few times before.
John looked back, really looked back at him. His expression was open, hopeful even, nothing like he had even seen before in Sherlock’s face. Maybe once, he caught a glimpse of something, but nothing like this. This was Sherlock being honest about whatever the hell he felt about him, and letting him see it.
They took a cab to the crime scene, and instead of pulling away from him and gaping at the window like he usually did, John remained close to Sherlock.
The mustache he was starting to grow was still light, then. Magnus held a mirror to his face, and John exactly how right he was. He was starting to look early thirties. He panicked and started pleading with Magnus, when his brother raised his hand to him.
"I've heard of him. He was Moriarty's second. But he mostly stood out of the limelight. He was a very skilled killer, sent to eliminate threats on a regular basis."
John touched his shoulder almost as a reflex at that comment, wondering how much this man knew about him.
Ragnor Fell is the former High Warlock of London, now deceased (both canon and this AU), he was Magnus's best friend and in this AU John's former long term partner/romantic interest/friend.
“Just what John? Because today, did I just saw you interacting with your ‘brother’ – he seemed to add derision to that word- in a not gay way?”
Molly was crying as he reached the morgue, leaning next to one of her freezers for bodies. They were rolling Sherlock on the gurney and she leaped and grabbed John’s jacket.
“People value their skills too much, even when some of them can qualify as meaningless. You don’t know when you are going to need a certain skill, so it would be the harder of the three to relinquish. I bet if any of us had offered a skill, even one we thought as menial or useless, the wall would have opened.”
"Yes, yes, the golden trio, I get that now. But then? I was miserable Sherlock, I mourned you, mourned my parents again and the life I lost before. Everything fell apart for the third time in my adult life. I don't know what I might have done without Mary at that time."
“You have always been able to see the Shadow World. The secret world, the world where ghosts, demons, vampires, werewolves and monsters exists. All the stories are real.”
She extended her hand and received the pen. Victor jumped, touched his wand lazily to his robes and they changed to a beautiful yellow sundress, just as he morphed into Victoria Vertro. Her hair was perfectly styled, long, thick curls falling over her shoulders, the colour of sunshine, which matched her hair perfectly. With another touch to her shoes, they changed into a pair of yellow heels. As she touched the pen, the thing starts to glow. Soon enough, Percy, Sherlock, and John are alone in Alissa’s office.
“You’ll have to fight Harry on that too, you know. See you later. I’ll check on your husband first. I need to change my clothes. I smell like dirt and death.”
Mary scoffed at the last comment, and the look on her face said she wasn't impressed with the direction the evening was taking.
“Well, I don’t need to tell you the gravity of this situation. We need to solve this before the Clave starts a war here in London against the fairies. I spoke to the Head of the Shadowhunter Institute. I don’t think you’ve met him. He is the one who took over after Imogen Herondale left to become inquisitor. He was their ward, and also Stephen’s parabatai.”
"As accurate as ever. But our head of the Auror office relies too much on Alissa for the actual gathering of evidence, as he should. Potter is a man of action, Alissa is the brains of the operation. Her memory is the one I'm interested in. The conventional approach didn't yield much information, as you surely know. So we need her intake and her reconstruction of the scene."
“Andrew, we are on a mission. You are going to get us both killed. Gideon and Stephen are going to kill us if we screw this up.”
He grabbed both Victor and Alissa and disapparated on the spot before John had time to reply. Just turning around the corner, entering the closed ward, were Harry Watson and Oliver Wood.
He received a visit from Magnus, and some of his new friends. He really liked the little red haired girl, he couldn’t really believe she was Valentine’s daughter and the sister of the monster who murdered his friend. He also liked the funny vamp who hanged around her, the one they called Daylighter. They wanted advice, he gave it, they left. Just another day in the life of John Watson.
Well, something other than death had separated them in life, but in death he will be buried right beside him.
John almost laughed at the silliness of the conversation, wondering how his partner, with his usual cutting manner and cold exterior, could have befriended one of the purest souls in the magical world, whose innocence and child-like wonder had not changed after a gruelling war and the long years of rebuilding after it.
“You know exactly how old I am, and I know exactly how old you are, and it is time that you start forgiving and forgetting before you wither away. You are 1863 years old, and you still have a lot of life ahead of you. So please, get out of that shell, push your prejudices aside and help your sister with this mess.”
"I was just telling Myc here that I was talking about you the other day. With your sister, nonetheless. There was a friendly game between the Harpies and Puddlemere United the other day, and there she was, decked from head to toe in Puddlemere gear. I recognised her, and when she saw me approaching her, she beamed at me and started talking about you. I believe congratulations are in order. When is your wife due?"
They followed Gabrielle up a beautiful staircase, into another dark hallway. Doors at each side, and at the end of it a big double door, to which Gabrielle decidedly walked. She opened the doors to reveal a beautiful sitting room, darkened by thick velvet drapes over the windows. With a motion of her wand, the curtains moved, letting the light in. Gabrielle gasped as the sun went in, revealing a hand with a wand next to it behind one of the armchairs. She moved closer to it, and the detective followed around the furniture. John manoeuvred to get by her side, finally laying his eyes on the corpse.
“In your own time, Victor, surely you seem to be enjoying this cave so much. Do continue your useless poking. Care to try them all?”
Sherlock moved close to him, and spoke low enough that he was sure only his brother could catch. Well, he didn’t think warlocks had enhanced hearing anyway.
He closed his eyes, remembering his army training. Remembering the feel of a grenade in his hand, picturing a particular brand, the weight, the cold feel of the material. This spellwork would be inventing a form of transfiguring something into a weapon. He grabbed a rock and started moving his wand, muttering words, and soon enough it started changing. Everyone was looking at him now, transfixed, and Victor was beaming. After fifteen minutes of working on it, John was sure he had a fully functional L109A1 grenade in his hand.
"Lissa insisted if you must know. It is the only picture in which you are with both of us at the ceremony. Such a pity Victor is in it too."
John took his lover back home, to his final resting place. He mourned him, and talked to him in his grave. It seemed like days passed, and he still haven’t heard a word from Sherlock. He was starting to feel restless. His phone beeped.
“Shadowhunters are part human and part angel. Basically, the opposites of warlocks. Their purpose is to slay demons and protect the mundanes, the regular human beings. They have laws, which are very complicated. They serve the Clave, that is their high government. They have their own country, but they have Institutes everywhere.”
“I’m not spending the rest of the afternoon letting someone prick and prod me with wands and needles for your amusement Tum, birthday present or party notwithstanding.”
"We'll get them here as soon as possible. I don't think her family will oppose her wishes, even though some of the texts she bestowed upon you are indeed valuable."
"Sebastian Moran. Moriarty's second in command. Who happens to be a rogue wizard, wanted by every Ministry of Magic in Europe and the Magical Congress of the United States."
“Yes, Sherlock, don’t pout, you are a grown man. Your brother and sister are putting this little rendezvous, and you are going to enjoy it, so help me God. Don’t try to get out of it or I’ll resort to a summoning charm so strong that you would have to be out of the country to avoid it. You don’t want to float in unprepared to meet your guests.”
He pointed at Sherlock as he sat in the big sofa, and soon Sally and Molly took each of his sides, the former to his left and the latter to his right. Greg irradiated an aura of authority and command, and John wondered how he missed the supernatural power and his place in the food chain.
“And you are not sober to begin with. Really, Harry, today of all days you had to go party at the Seelie Court? You’ll probably dance in the fairy revels for the rest of your immortal life if you are not careful.”
John's arm stiffed a little, and he sensed Alissa watching his reaction. Great, now two people can stare at him and read his every move. She seemed genuinely interested.
“I’m about to become a widow, aren’t I? You promised, Mycroft Holmes! I’m forced to raise our son alone because you broke that promise.”
“These people, as you call them, are my friends Myc! I thought you, of all people, would be happy of me having friends beside you!”
Sherlock looked at Victor rebelliously, like daring him to make another move. Victor just went and grabbed his arm, which Sherlock released with a sharp movement. Victor sighed.
They all managed to land on their feet, and they appeared into Mary’s empty room, in which a distraught Gabrielle Delacour was sitting on the chair John used just that morning.
"Ah, yes, I hope to put them in shape for the next season, we ended in the top half of the table this year, but I think we finally got the players we need for a championship. I've been the assistant coach these past few years, but the team finally changed owners, and with that, the head coach retired and let me take the reins."
“I think we are in the right spot. Let’s cross our fingers, because I really don’t want to park anywhere else.”
The machine made the same whooshing sound John heard before, and John felt… actually nothing. Was the thing even moving?
“Yes, darling, my wand suffered a little mishap. The damage it sustained is unfortunately beyond repair. Well, I’ve to talk to Miss Ollivander before the day is over. I’m sure she can make a suitable replacement for me.”
“Yes, he already had some lunch I’m afraid, and now he is taking a nap. These trips exhaust him, but I'd rather come here the normal way than use that blasted Floo Network. Lissa, darling, aren’t you tired? All of this running around, and you in such a delicate state.”
They worked on it for a while, until Sherlock barged into the room, talking to himself, or to John, but without looking up.
Her face shadowed at the memories, the last time they saw each other she was burying her future brother-in-law and friend, as he was saying farewell to Luke.
Clearly, it was better that John was away, back home right now. Because it gave him a reason to survive. Two years flew, and then came Serbia. He was really buggered now. Well, it was worth it if he managed to end this. At least John would be safe. As they whipped him and tortured him, he reached for his mind palace. He had a whole wing dedicated to John.
“Don’t mention Stephen Herondale’s name in my presence, Harry. I’m still horrified with the things he did. He stained Tessa’s bloodline.”
He extended his hand, and as Sherlock stood to shake it, he grabbed him into a hug. Molly walked and hugged him too, planting a kiss on his left cheek. Lestrade hugged John after that, and Molly just smiled at him, as she moved to take Greg's hand once again.
"John, tap this circles in the tapestry with your wand, first the one on the left, then the one on the top and in the end tap the second snake in the fourth row. Be careful to tap exactly what I told you to tap. This tapestry has over a thousand combinations and most of them, well, not good."
“Well, well, aren’t you the ickle firstie!! Well, not a firstie anymore? Looking so big now in your Quidditch robes!”
on me as I fell. Victor's abilities came in handy at that moment. Molly provided a corpse, and Victor made a complex
"Oh yes, they were a hoot those boys. Oliver and me, we always complained we got stuck with Percy in our room, but then, at least we managed to get sleep. Those twins were forces of nature, both of them whirlwinds. I could never imagine one without the other. I was shocked to hear Fred was one of the fallen in the Battle of Hogwarts. I can't imagine what George felt. Well, I almost can, but no, different context."
