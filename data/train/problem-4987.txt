It hurts her. Everything hurts her; her skin felt tight and sore like it did before the onset of flu. Pitying look from others felt like knives on her. She was really miserable.
WHY? He remembered the dream after he saw Tony picture in Shield file. How Tony-not this Tony, but he knew it was Tony and how his soul-mate looked at him with such love, affection and reverent.
The billionaire wanted to yell at Rogers but settled for glaring. This wasn’t the time for this. He looked away at the heavy bloodstain on the far, lower wall again before let his mind went into overdrive. Steve was silent, afraid he would rile Tony again. "He made it personal." Tony’s eyes were bright with sudden realization.
Call it escapist, but after shouldering so much on his shoulder, he would like to go home and let his partner dominate him, that was how he and Howard had worked out.
Everyone he had known before being frozen was long gone, and just as he had finally begun to see Tony in a new light, he would lose the other half of his soul. How fair was that?
Steve desperately tried to catch on with Tony’s science talk, wanted to help and showed Tony that he wasn't useless. It was like the Omega was talking in a different language and half what Tony said went over his head. He felt like an idiot and even more 'out of time.' He registered that Loki needed a power source.
He had fought tooth and nail for his country, fully willing to die to protect everything he loves. But it wasn’t he who dies, it was everything else!
"Steve!" Tony screamed. For a moment, he thought for sure he'd be shredded before the rotors slowed down and he got spat out into the air.
Hulk shook his head in grief as he stared at Tony’s lifeless body before he roared so loudly that the ground under them shook. Steve had never heard such a desperate yet angry sound.
Pepper curled her long fingers delicately around both of his hands. They felt cool against his palm and he held on tight. When she spoke, it's with a yearning that he had never really heard before with her. "Bonding hardly ever happen and twin flame bond was even rarer. How I could ever be angry that you got to have something so wonderful?"
"You have no idea of the forces with which you are tangling with!" The blond growled, his temper rose.
When he returned from Afghanistan Tony Stark could have just sat back and lived out his life quietly but no, he made the conscious decision to change his entire life, and sacrificed billions to stop making weapons and pursued what he knew was right… and he kept to it even after Obadiah Stane (one of his closest friends) tried to kill him for it.
‘I had subdued the bond once when I was just a primary school student. I can, I will do it all over again!’ He ignored something inside of him, telling him it would never be like it was before now that Steve was here…
Anthony grabbed Steven’s shoulders and pushed him onto his back. His hands-on each side of Steven’s head while his piercing eyes pinned on the Alpha with predatory intent. He could smelt Steven’s desperate arousal. For a moment he forgot what he needed to do and took a deep intake of his next breath- a breath he held as if savoring a scent so rare and delightful, he refused to exhale. Moments later he remembered and had to stop himself from sighed with contentment and opted to look smug instead.
He was just as dedicated and had laid his life on the line on a nearly daily basis as the heroes did. Outside being Iron Man, he worked hard to make the world a better place a predominating percentage of his time.
Having Rogers so close was like riding a tornado--the wild rush of adrenaline that started in Tony's chest and coiled tightly in his stomach felt the same. The whole Helicarrier seemed to dwindle down to just the two of them, and the space between their bodies. Tony could feel the heat that radiated off of Steve and saw the flecks of green in those brilliant blue eyes. Tony bit his lips, anger suffused in him even as lust curled hotly in his stomach. God, Rogers' scent was so dizzying from this proximity. Like the finest wine and the sweetest cinnamon, with a hint of musk. Why must he felt this terrible attraction for Rogers when the man was being an annoying prick? But damn it, something about him made Tony melt, the heat at the core of his body made his legs weak. He was furious, he needed to fight this!
Tony wasn’t stupid enough to believe that Loki’s staff put the words into their mouths. As someone who created an Artificial Intelligence as advance as JARVIS, he knew enough about psychology to know that one didn’t just come up with hurtful concepts one had never considered before even if they were under some kind of influence. The staff only brought the thought that must have been in his subconscious, or his thought to the forefront only served to take away the preservation instinct that would have kept those thoughts from ever seeing the light of day.
It was an Alpha’s instinct as much as their pride to protect and own their mate. Most Alphas would be angry or/and hurt, even resentful if their mate wasn’t able to trust them as Tony did. Most Alphas would have taken it personally that another Alpha-Rhodey-was the only exception to his didn’t like to be handed things rule. Especially when she knew that he had let Rhodey helped him change his arc reactor during the palladium poisoning debacle. Let his best-friend saw the burnt-out palladium core when he didn’t give a damn clue about his condition to Pepper.
‘THIS GUY...’ Natasha rolled her eyes, Stark hacked the plane just to play an intro? He should install a PA system in his armor.
At 30 years old, Maria Stark was one of the most beautiful, high-level Omega around and the object of envy of other Omegas and Betas. After all, she was the Omega who captured the heart of the great Howard Stark. Captured, past tense because pictures of Howard and his mistress made it to the front page of the news.
Of course, she would, Pepper was like the shadow that was too loyal to abandon anyone. Tony’s lips curled into a genuine smile. “I loved you. Pepper, you were one of the best things ever happened to me.’’ He stroked a thumb across her knuckles.
More than half then richest, most successful men in the world are Alphas. Which why parents and bosses and society respected/prefers Alphas.
“Tony...” When Tony’s side of the comm went dead, Steve screamed internally before shouting into the comm, as if being loud enough would get through to Tony. Still no response. Tears fell from his eyes, he felt like he was suffocating like something had a grip on his lungs and wasn't letting go. He struggled to bear the overwhelming pain and fear he might lose his Twinflame. This feeling of helplessness, it was far worse than when he lost Bucky.
Steve grabbed his arm tight enough to bruise and wheeled him around so they were face to face, hurt palpable on his face.
“No.” A single syllable crusted with ice around the edges. “I don't think so, Captain; you're not getting anything from me." And watched some of the joy in Rogers' face seeped out. “You see, I am not interested in a relic especially if it is my father’s hand me down.”
Thor glared, smirking darkly as he swung his hammer round to gain traction. Before it could build momentum Tony shot a blast into the Asgardian's chest with a relatively weak repulsor blast. He didn’t want to seriously hurt/kill the Alien prince and started an intergalactic war.
“Look to your elder, people.” Loki voiced with amusement as he levelled his staff to the man, "Let him be an example." a low thrum emanating from the core of his staff.
Tony looked over at Bruce at that comment and smiled. "Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us." He said confidently.
Before he met Maria, Howard used to seek up one night stands to numb uncomfortable feeling like when he failed to recreate the super soldier serum. He couldn’t cope with the countless of failure and sex without emotion became an escapade. And now that she had fail him having given birth to an Omega (and not even female one) instead of an Alpha male, he planned to start with his old habit again. After all how else could he get the alpha heir he wanted?
Steve looked between the two scientists, sighed as he tried to wrap his head around all the new information and possibilities that S.H.I.E.L.D was working on dangerous projects and hiding things on purpose.
Did they also gave Rogers the psychoanalysis review about how fuck up Tony must be after his parent’s abuse, Afghanistan, and Obie’s betrayal and told him an untamable Omega like Tony needed a firm hand; someone to make him fall on his knees? FUCKING BASTARDS, let see who got on their knees!!
Steve’s expression was surprisingly soft, tender. His stomach filled with newly awakened butterflies, a strong fluttering that felt so familiar. Just looked at the perfection that was his husband - hell, even thinking the word husband- made his heart fluttered like a hummingbird tried to escape its cage. If he didn’t already know he was dreaming, he would pinch himself.
Note: This chapter and the next one is difficult to me so I had a co-writer to help me with writing them. Kathryn, my best friend is a great writer (she doesn’t have an Ao3 account so I will credit her here
That cheek electrified by contact with Steven was the only one that mattered. The muscle, inside the darkest, the deepest part of the Omega clenched most deliciously. The pain was so sweet and sharp, he wanted to close his eyes, but he was still hypnotized by Steven’s eyes stared fervently into his. It took a moment before Anthony snapped out of it.
A dangerous glint in Bruce’s eyes, his mouth twitched slightly while his right hand’s nails kept scraping the side of his glasses in a relentless pattern. A terrifying humorless laugh escaped his lips. Even Tony had to admit, it scared him a little.
In the Quinjet, Steve kept his eyes on Tony. The blank expression of the suit remained a steadfast annoyance, prevented him from getting a read on his Twin-soul. Steve wished Tony wasn’t in his suit of armor so he could have a good smell of him and felt the full effect of the bond. Now he had Tony, he wouldn’t have to be alone anymore.
Steve watched the man passed by him without a blink. "First time you've lost a comrade?" he asked gently.
Steve could hear the next thing Tony said with his better than most hearing "That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wonder if they should've kept him on ice." The words cut at him like bitter blades. How Tony could say that?!
"It's different.” Bruce insisted, turning back to his work. There was no way to control the Other Guy. That was the whole point. He was and always will be chaos unbound.
The cry that slipped past Steve’s lips so filled with agony, with the overwhelming explosion of pain that stole his breath, his senses and his strength. He sank to the road beneath him, dying inside. He could felt it, like a slow wave of destruction raced through his heart, ripped it apart piece by piece before struck at his very soul.
"Tony, we need a plan of attack!" Steve shouted with a hard edge to it as his soulmate started for the end of the plane.
They said some soulmates were connected to their other half even after their soulmate’s death. Since he woke up in the future, Steve had been having terrible nightmares of being frozen in time, trapped in ice while his home, the city he grew up in, and the world he wouldn't ever know again, moved on without him.
Tony file should be thicker than the one Steve is reading but Tony hack into Shield and make sure erase every evident of Howard’s and Maria’s abuse of him like 2 year ago…and of course Fury couldn’t prove jack squat so he just tighten the security
But Tony being Tony only faltered for about a second before glared daggers and smiled challenging at him. “MAKE ME.”
The blow failed to faze Loki and left Steve wide open. A blow to the back by Loki’s staff sends Steve across the plaza landing un-ceremonially on the ground.
Strong and willful, he rolled over him to exploit and explored until Steve was delirious with pleasure. The savage, transcendent triumph in Steve’s cries.
"We were raised together, played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?" Thor asked a little hurt.
Rogers’ lip curled into a pain, tight smirked; looked at him with a vicious and disgusting glare that cut through him as deeply as his father's. He should be proud that he was able to put such an ugly look on Rogers’ face.
Steve still remembered his vow when Tony’s nearly died. “I understand, Mr. Stark.” he would wait for Tony how long it took even if it took him lifetimes.
Rogers must have a giant star in the middle of his chest caused he was too proud of his serum healing factor or something equally as stupid. Unlike Rhodey many male alphas were too proud for their own good, Rhodey would never paint a giant star in the middle of his armor’s chest no matter how tough Tony made it.
‘NO, you didn’t Steve, you just thought you did cause the bond was fucking with your brain just like it fucking with mine.’ Tony thought. “Well, I didn’t!” Tony retorted, he felt pain with every heartbeat for even uttered this.
“But I suppose you don’t know that. You might have missed a couple of things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.” Tony spat acidly, ignoring the voice of reason in his head telling him to stop, just fucking stop!.
The sound of bullets going over the line to pour straight into the Iron Man’s helmet. Tony’s blood ran cold as panic gripped his heart. ‘Were those bullets in the background? What the hell was going on down there?’
Which meant Steve was fine that Fury intended to blackmail him into submission and endanger everything he worked so hard to achieve. The hurt and anger of being betrayed rose in him. Anger had ridged his cheekbones with a slash of crimson like his flesh was on fire.
There definitely a big misunderstanding between them. Now Steve thought back, it all started when he mentioned about the stupid footage. “Tony, I…”
"Is everything a joke to you?" Steve was working out quite a temper and had to refrain from growling at Tony's attitude. He glared instead. If Tony cared to spare him a second glance, he would notice the scarily calm yet angry expression he wore.
Steve glared harder this time, tired of Tony's blasé attitude to everything, even important and dangerous things.
If Steve wanted to find happiness and peace he should find it within himself first. Then he should be with someone with less baggage and a lot more submissive than Tony Stark, someone who could fit his 1940 archetype and made him happy. He didn’t want to be the happiest person today only to be broken and fade into the background like Maria when Steve decided he wasn’t good enough.
"No." Tony winced, not looking up at him. "He had a lover uh... cellist I think." he tried to keep the tightness out of his voice but fail. Why did he felt the need to share this with Rogers, he would never let himself be vulnerable in front someone he didn’t trust. He could feel the bond restless inside him and he tried to force it down.
Tony asked himself the same question every day. More than anyone, he knew he had a lot of glaring character flaws underneath his armor but he put on airs of arrogance and made everyone believed what he wanted them to believe regarding himself -what the media always thought of him. It was a perfect defence mechanism.
Thor summoned back Mjolnir to his hand. Just as he’s about to smashed Iron man with the hammer, Tony powered up his hand thrusters and SKID across the ground to the air, escaped from the hit and tripping Thor over.
Loki blinked, his eyebrows curled “Well, yes.” he said it like it was obvious and Thor was stupid for even asking.
Thor taken reigned over his temper. “This is beyond you, Metal Man.” Thor said slowly as if talking to a slow child and it grated Tony. “Loki will face Asgardian’s justice.” His voice was hard as iron.
Then Iron Man charged at the Alien. Leaped like a feral cat and kicked him hard through a tree, sending him flying. Thor fell back with a grunt, dropping Mjolnir as he landed.
Steven had Anthony posed naked on the bed, stared shamelessly at him. “So beautiful.” Steven whispered, gazed softly at him. A simple look from him made Anthony felt beautiful in a way he never had before.
It hurts, it hurt real bad to be so close to what he desired more than anything and knew he could never allow himself to have. Because as much as it hurt not having Steve, it would destroy him if he had Steve for a brief period only for Steve to hate him when he saw his real self.
Loki shoved him viciously, strode forward and looking at the dark sky. "I've seen worlds you've never known about, and I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it…”
Tony tried to back away but was prevented by an arm pulled at his hand, pulled him closer. A whiff of Steve’s scent swirled like kisses around Tony’s head, made him light-headed. Steve framed his face with both hands.
"It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word." Tony instructed, using his laser to break apart one of the bigger pieces of metal.
"STARK, SO HELP ME GOD IF YOU MAKE ONE MORE WISE CRACK ABOUT..." Steve’s eyes snapped with imperious blue fire, he was furious that once again his soulmate was being suicidal.
Captain America still looked at him with superior arrogance. The only thing stopped Tony from punching his stupid face was to remind himself that punching Roger’s face without his armor would break his hand. He needed his hand to tinker. He had an armor to fix and another to finish building. His mission as Iron Man came first.
Pepper found the right side of the bed to be empty, a normal occurrence since the battle of New York. The only difference was Tony was here, not in his lab working on his many projects. Pepper watched the other man’s profile. Tony looked more tired and sleep-deprived than she ever saw him. Whatever Tony had been bottled up had been eating him worse than Pepper thought.
Steve didn’t realize how hollow and rehearse the titles sound because he was hurting so much. He had allowed himself to believe that his soul-mate could fill the hole in his heart only to get harshly rejected. He had slammed that hurt down behind the icy walls of contempt.
Tony pointed the bag of blueberries in his hand towards Steve. "Blueberry?" Tony offered. He could felt the disapproval coming from Stars-and-Stripes, the hated stomach-churning occurred again.
Maria was everything Howard needed in a wife. She was young, murderously beautiful, very fertile as she was a high level omega, and had enough wit and raw intelligence to be engaging to someone like him.
Tony wasn’t always a Dominant Omega. He made himself into a Dom after getting free from Howard. Just like Steve prefer to be submissive Alpha in bed to relieve his tension after a day of being Captain America.
Steve’s felt his heartbeat everywhere, even in his toes. The soldier felt like doing something bold like kissing Tony. He was sure that wasn’t a smart option considering Tony’s reaction to the first time. He wasn’t sure he cared.
Steve raised his eyebrows, looked down at Tony, surprised by how devious and underhanded he was being. Hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D computers? That was a risky move. "Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around." He replied with a shake of his head.
Tony looked up at him, empathized. He understood how it felt to have this thing inside you, a thing you never asked for, this thing you couldn't ever get rid of. He wanted to give Banner a different outlook.
‘The Alpha you never fully trusted with your mind. You trusted her with your life, with your company and fortune but not with your innermost thought. In fact, you would sooner trust Rhodey. Now, why is that? Are you that scared of her seeing the true you and hating you? Or are you scared she would have too much power over you as Obie did?’
“It's his M.O., isn't it?” Bruce quietly intimidating voice had drawn the attention of everyone in the room. “I mean, what are we; a TEAM? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes CHAOS." Bruce said gravely, trying to put some distance between him and everyone else. “We were-we were a time-bomb.”
Steve felt jealousy curdling in him as Tony couldn't stop himself from grinning and waltzed towards Doc. Banner.
OH GOD; Tony’s heart beating fast at the fiery intensity he encountered in Roger’s eyes- so strong and bright it resembled a fire burning in a black abyss. And that passion was being directed at him. It was concentrated to fill those eyes when they stared at him, he could felt his face heated up and his heart was thumping distinctly faster.
He closed their distance, his imposing form towered over the woman. “You…” he growled. Her legs felt weak at the growl of the Ultimate Alpha, smelled the agitated alpha’s scent grew stronger.
Few male Alphas would bottom for other Alpha let alone an Omega. He expected Steven to be scandalized, pushed him roughly and stormed out angrily while cursing him.
All his love and his desperation for Howard's approval turned into anger and resentment. It suddenly made perfect sense. Howard would always love Captain America because he was the product and symbol of his genius. He would always hate Tony because his son represented everything he hated, his genius being replaced by better future generation and his gene failure in producing an Alpha and produced an Omega instead.
"Shawarma after, then?" Tony was undeterred, looking around again as he got his breath back. Steve chuckled, offered the man his hand. Tony scowled at his hand but he was too tired to argue so he took Steve’s hand and pulled himself up. His heart didn’t flutter, and he didn’t shiver from the warm tingled along his spine.
He… Anthony looked older and fully dressed in the second painting. Anthony’s eyes shone with great contentment, his face was plump with goodness and the happiness of an Omega who had ended up with everything he wanted. Tony briefly wondered how he looked right now.
They matched each other so perfectly. Whatever he needed, his Alpha needed, whatever his Alpha wanted, he wanted. “Tony.” His name was music, dark voluptuous music the way Steve said it. Before Steve could ask, he was answering. They were making love with all they were. Body, heart, mind, and soul.
Pepper might not be his soul-mate, but he loved her deeply. She was the axis on which everything else in his world turned to. He would not let this ruin what they had the happiness he had gained.
On closer observation, one perceived bits of gold scattered throughout the blue eyes. Like sunlight sparkled on the ocean wave, the gold in his soulmate’s watchful gaze. He felt like he could stare at those eyes forever. His hands, his arms, and his soul-everything wanted to reach out and crush his Omega against him. He wanted to kiss his soul-mate, wanted to touch him. He wanted to worship him. The moment stretched before he realized the Omega’s intelligence eyes were guarded, calculated. Steve couldn’t read anything in his expression.
How could the shy and visibly uncomfortable Doctor Banner seemed perfectly fine and at ease around Tony after the man acted like an asshole by commenting on the 'green beast' problem without caring about Banner's feelings and how much it could hurt him?! It was ridiculous and Steve couldn't understand it.
Barton drew back his bowstring, letting loose the explosive arrow about a hundred feet from the engine. The arrow flew out, but then the wind caused it to sharply head for the engine right off the Helicarrier. It was a timer counting down before it exploded.
"And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark!" He warned, watching Tony moved around the lab with all his confidence.
A hard punch and Tony’s head jerked to the side and throbbing heat exploded across his cheek. Howard had broken his cheekbone.
Steve’s stricken face was the color of mist. He was suddenly aware of his heart beating really fast, and all he could think to say was, “Howard.”
“We are! The model lock and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we got a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.” Bruce said calmed and evenly, pointed to another monitor.
Tony wasn’t a hero, but at least unlike Rogers who had been genetically modified and had been spoon-fed his fame; his armor was an extension of himself, the product of his raw talent, blood and sweat! He built the first miniaturized arc reactor –while carting around a car battery attached to the magnet filled a giant hole in his sternum -and his first suit with scrap and salvage in a fucking cave in just a week!
Is this guy for real? “You would bottom for an Omega.” He blurted out skeptically. “What about Alpha’s pride?”
It deeply saddened him because he empathized but too well. "Bruce. It was Abomination that broke Harlem. I saw the footage. Who knows how many more people would die if you hadn't stopped it? You're a hero, Bruce."
But he was a protector with the capabilities to do much better than Rogers could and as much good as the rest of the team. He had been around as Iron Man for as long as Captain America was around in WW2. He was a show-off, but he also had handled a lot of things and had proven himself more than capable again and again BY THIS POINT.
Tony was with Pepper, had been with Pepper for more than 2 years and would… continue being with Pepper. He needed to remember that. And he had been the one who broke Steve’s heart and fantasy he didn’t have the right to miss him.
Tony’s body half covered by the sheets, hair over his face, eyes closed. Watched the Omega now, he couldn’t imagine being without his husband, he loved him too much.
It was a shame that Tony would get kick out of the Avengers boyband after this all over, but at least he didn’t have to see Rogers’ face again. And maybe, just maybe if Rogers reject the bond too, the bond between them would truly be severed. He ignored the ache he felt at the thought.
Tony tried to overpower Thor's strong punches, only served to get his wrists ensnared in his stronger grip. The blond squeezed hard around Iron Man’s left arm and buckling the shapes and electrics inside.
Tony pulled himself away to look at the empty cell container where Loki had been caged. Looking down at the hole Thor had fallen through, he wondered how the blond Alpha was faring. He didn’t think the big guy would die easily but fall from this height made he wondered if he ended up injured.
Maria was so happy that she pushed into Howard with such force that he had to brace himself. The chemistry was unimaginable. They had forgotten why they were there. The contact between their bodies were the only thing that mattered. He could smell the sweetness of her skin and hair, feel the wetness of her breath against his neck and the warmth of her breasts against his chest.  Her beautiful, body trembled against his. His hand moved exquisite slowly on her back, the tiniest movement sent currents of electricity that sent connections to her throat, nipples and clit. She felt helpless with arousal. If he had strip her bare and fuck her in front of everyone, she would have offered no resistance.
Anthony… Tony… Something about that name rang a chord in him. It was never like this with Howard and that alone gave him such hope that made him even more afraid to have it shatter.
After the palladium poison debacle, not only had he convinced Pepper to continue helming his company, they shared their first make-out session and romance blossomed between them.
This could be channel into good like Steve and Thor channel this for a good cause while Obie was blinded by greed for wealth and power. Steve is one of the rare Alpha who is good Hufflepuff + Griffindor minded.
But somewhere over the span of 3 years, Howard frustration about failing in replicating the super-serum, searching for Captain America and revolutionize the arc reactor triggered it, things changed or rather Howard did and he started to feel dissatisfied.
“JARVIS search for a painter named Steven Thorne. He probably lived during the 18th century. After you find him search for information about his paintings especially nude Omega painting.” It took Tony a moment to realize he used ‘After you find him.’ and not ‘If you find him.’
Abruptly Tony remembered PEPPER. His eyes rocketed open. He remembered that the bond was a prison. Steve could feel his soulmate's fear like cornered animals, the anger, and disgust and not a little rage Tony felt for himself.
“Last year, our earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge mass that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopeless, hilariously, outgunned.” Nick paced the room slowly.
The force of it transfixed Tony, caught and held his senses. It was some part of Steve and Tony that had been asleep for their whole life woke up with a jolt, like it had just been waiting for each other's touch to spring back to life. Both of them whimpered. It felt familiar and so deeply right like he had done this a million times. Fingers tangled in Tony's hair as Steve drank him in, absorbed his scent. A hand moved down his backside, sending electric currents up and down his spine, and pulled him closer. So close, imprinted Tony's body to his --it was as if Steve intended they would never be separated again.
Thor quickly grabbed Loki roughly by his collar, forcing him to stand. His hand grabbed Loki’s neck but as he looked at his brother, his gripped loosen a little. He looked at the stormy sky outside and dragged Loki, jumping out the plane with him.
“Are you really that naive? S.H.I.E.L.D. MONITORS potential THREATS.” Natasha said sternly to everyone arguing in the lab.
"You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart." Tony didn't look up as he was talking, tapped the clothed arc reactor with his fingertips.
Tony's skin warmed and hummed with quickening the blood. His tongue caressed, explored, branded and excited, expressed stark passion and seared desire on his giddy senses, set Steve and his wits spun even faster.
Steve could hear the smile in Tony’s voice as he finished Bruce’s sentence. "Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect."
“Wait! Wait! Hold on!” Tony gestured with his hand for Steve to stop, and Steve’s electric blue eyes leveled on him again, warmed his blood. The tension in the room was electric and left the entire room still. “How was this now about me?” Tony asked, annoyed.
Tony Stark first mistake was to be born an Omega, something that Howard never forgive Tony and his wife for. After all Howard expected everything that related to him especially by blood to be perfect.
Howard being a multimillionaire and a legend in his field, Maria was induct into a life of comfort, fame and luxury of every women dreamt.
Steve saw it coming and tried to shield himself for the impact, but the heaviness of the armor made him crumpled down to the floor anyway.
It took him weeks to finalize the renovation plans. And as much as he hated to admit it he spent longer personalizing Steve’s floor. He chalked it down on pity. After everything Steve had gone through he could at least build a room that could be Captain America’s escapade and comfort from his pain of losing everything (including his soulmate). It was the only thing Tony could do for him since he planned to avoid Steve as much as possible outside of duty.
“Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants.” In one swift movement, he placed his special button-sized section of JARVIS under Fury’s desk, to start hunting the files he needed. He looked back to Bruce “Something to… kick-start the cube.”
Tony quickly blasted him with a relatively weak repulsor blast to his right temple causing Thor to fall back, losing his stance. Then he head-butted Thor with his gold-titanium alloy helmet only to get head-butt back and sent across the forest.
Guilt gnawed at Iron Man but it would do him no good. He forced it behind him, entrailed and twisted like vipers. “I’m sorry, Steve. I have to do this.” Steve heard him as loudly as a ticking bomb.
Tony put on an extra burst of speed and wrapped battered arms around it. He was going to end this. He started flying towards the portal.
When it subsided, he felt as if he swallowed a plum-sized rock. What suitable answer could he possibly give? Regained his composure, he laughed and gave her a chaste kiss, looking at her with all the love he felt in his heart. “If so, it is because you make me want to become a better man.” He murmured softly enough she could take the words for indistinct music if she preferred. His eyes were as dark and as delicious as Turkish coffee.
Before Thor could stand up properly, Tony launched himself toward him and punched his head. Thor stood, facing Iron Man. He snarled into Thor's face, raised his fists and getting in a hit as Thor raised his hammer.
Steve broke into a panic and ran alongside Thor, shouldered past Thor to reach Tony. ‘Is he breathing.’ Steve knelt, turned Tony onto his back, and ripped off the faceplate off Iron Man but Tony didn't even stir.
About the bone breaking, Howard broke Tony’s ribs when he caught him making out with a Beta. Tony was lucky he didn’t catch him with an Omega since Tony was poly-sexual like his dad.
“Excuse me…” Nick Fury fixed Thor with his one-eyed steely gaze, his voice was sharp and angry. “Did we come to your planet and blows stuff up?!”
Tony felt the beat of his heart as it started fading within his chest. ‘… I’m sorry, Steve.’ Then he let go, ready to embrace death. He could feel the second disturbance in the air, the portal was closing.
Then Steve realized child-like excitement at proving that he still knew something about America wasn’t a great facilitator of conversation and was glad he didn't see Tony's reaction to this. “I understood that reference.” He said flatly, wanting to bang his stupid head into the wall.
Howard made him believe that he would never be smart enough, never measure up to his expectation, and never, ever be good enough for his father.
Thor’s jaw twitched. Tony continued “Doth Mother know you weareth her drapes?” he gestured at Thor’s clothes to emphasis.
"Do you think I'm not?" Tony retorted, frowned again, rounded the desk and moved closer to Rogers. "Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us?" Tony asked, moved back to his desk and looked across at Rogers. "I can't solve an equation unless I have all the variables." He said, picked up a bag of blueberries from the desktop and started opening it.
It was so very brief and Tony almost missed the moment where an expression opened and terrible like a fresh wound took its place on Steve’s face before that too vanished.
“You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.” Loki smiled showing his white teeth, very pleased with his speech.
The same cold, all-consuming helplessness he had felt as he saw Yinsen’s life seeped away from underneath his fingertips filled him and crippled him. He could barely draw breath. His torture, his surgery, did Fury show all that to ROGERS… to others, video evidence of Tony screaming, crying and out of his mind with the pain while being tortured? Or worse how Tony caused Yinsen- the best man he had ever known-death?! Selfishly let the man bought him time at the cost of his life. Just HOW MUCH did ROGERS KNEW?!!
Steve pushed the heavy door to the port-side aside. He looked around at the destruction, seeing S.H.I.E.L.D operatives in full oxygen masks shot fire extinguishers and cowered from the shower of sparks, largely unable to do anything.
Tony moved over to Bruce, shrugged. "What he's got is an Acme Dynamite Kit." he smirked at the thought "It's going to blow up in his face. And I'm going to be there when it does." Tony grinned at the idea, stopped at one of his screens and tapped away.
God, Bruce had tried to kill himself. Tony's heart ached for him. He knew how painful life must have been for someone to kill himself. He hadn’t actively been trying to commit suicide after Jarvis and his parent’s death and during the palladium poisoning, but he had gotten damn close.
Power failing, Tony lost his grip on the warhead, his armor chipped away piece by piece as the lights of the suit dimmed to black. He watched as the nuke rocketed off towards the gargantuan ship that hovered above Earth like a malevolent spider and exploded in bright flashes of light and fire that engulfed the ship and its surrounding smaller ships in. The eerie silent explosion that followed painted the destruction in front of him with its magnificent splendid colors and bathed him in its radiation and blew him backward.
Howard could have a secret relationship with Captain America during WWII but he didn’t TRUST Tony to keep his relationship secret from the world.
Steve had lost hope. He had lost everything that matters to him. It was like having his heart dug out of his chest. His lips pulled back from his teeth as his head tipped back and an enraged howl of an animal, demented from complete agony tore from his lips. He was gone, this time, not even his belief could stop for taking his own life. Steve would embrace death and search for Tony in his next life.
Wincing at the impact and the large splintering noise, Tony quickly checked on his status. His sensors had taken quite the beating. Jarvis specs became blurry for a moment before it recovered.
“SHUT IT!” said the genius, slow and clear and so loaded with venom his words positively dripped with it. “I HAD NO TIME FOR YOURS OR FURY’S SHIT!” Not when Coulson was dead remained unspoken. Tony swallowed, composed himself after his outburst. “I'm not marching to the tune of Fury's fife.”
Coulson’s knowing eyes showed that he knew exactly what Tony was doing and the brunet cursed inwardly. Coulson was informed, he was sent to get him after all. He was lucky the guy didn’t say anything to Pepper. The thought of what Fury would ask to keep quiet about this… made him shuddered… he couldn’t see himself having a break in the near future. Damn, that baldy.
Tony’s stomach flipped over like pancake at Steve nearness. He flipped it straight back again. It was bad enough he kept having wet-dream about having sex with Captain America while in bed with Pepper. This whole thing made him felt dirty like he had been cheating on Pepper every single night. He had to get this to stop. He and Pepper had something special together, and he would not let a stupid bond stood in the way!
Steve surged upward, pushed through the battering winds amidst a hail of bullets, and grabbed the edge of the lever and yanked it. The damn thing was stuck at first before he got it to work, opened the air ducts under the engine to drop Tony out.
‘Except for Obie.’ His mind supplied bitterly. ‘Who would have thought a beetle that could tear hardwood was trapped in flower petals that were so soft.’ A voice echoed in his mind. ‘Who was that?’ He shook his head to snap himself out of it.
Tony felt their bond pulsed between them, raw, real, and with roots deep enough to wrap around and penetrate his brain, heart, and some deeper part of him he couldn't name. The force of emotion flowing between them like an impossible two-way river. Warm fluttered and spark spread like wildfire through their body and set off fireworks in their curiously empty skull. Like Ambrosia, it addicted his mind, body, and senses completely.
“NO! God, no!” he sobbed, the explosion of agony that stole his breath, his strength. “Don’t do this to me.” he reached out to Tony with everything inside of him, desperately wished for the sight of a tiny metal man soared from outer space.
"We thought it best to break it to you slowly." The man said, and Steve considered his next move as the man drew closer, shifting his weight.
She crossed her arms in contemplation. “Those cards, they were in Coulson's locker, not his pocket.” she said with a note of disapproval that Fury used Phil’s memory like that.
Her verbal abuse grew more and more frequent as she fell into depression with the passing years. In her drunken ravings, she spewed whatever poison she managed to come up with at Tony from day to day.
How could someone as smart as Tony Stark rejected something so sacred and wonderful… wasn’t soul-bond what everyone wanted
Tony had subdued the bond once, but it would always be there. It just quieted down because Tony emotionally and mentally rejected the bond after he was 8 and came to hate Captain America.
Steve’s face looked like he'd swallowed something unpleasant as Tony shook Bruce's hand vigorously. A glimmered in their eyes shone as the mutual respect shown. “Is that what just happened?”
The sick fucker must love to have seen him bleeding and screaming! Howard must be imbecile for admiring this sadistic, brainless gorilla who couldn’t even see his flaw! Those two should have been soul-mate instead, a match made in HELL.
It was a difficult birth. Very, very difficult. Maria spent 48 hours on a bed, where she endured contractions, screaming. The nurses kept wiping her brow and feeding her ice and telling her to push, push, and push. Maria was scared, the pain kept coming and radiated everywhere. It’s omnipresent and Maria’s panicked over it being the death of her because nobody did anything, there was too much risk, too much risk of the baby’s life. “Oh, god. It feels like I’m being torn apart.”
In 1940 it was an unwritten society law that one had to stay with their soulmate regardless the circumstances ex domestic abuse, cheating. It is consider to be a sin to reject your soulmate.
As the words resonated to the kneeling crowd, an elderly man refused to kneel. His face was defiant as he turned towards Loki and facing him dead on without shaking or bowing. “Not to men like you.”
Bruce chuckled softly at Tony's technological brilliance. Looking around the room in slight awe, Bruce murmured offhandedly "All I packed is a toothbrush."
A beeping alerted him and Bruce to the completion of his download. Tony's monitor showed a collection of secret files. Scanned, his eyes were immediately drawn to one particular deadlocked and coded file.
Steven found Tony’s nipple with his mouth, and he shrieked as he came, trembling around him, forcing Steven’s growling release- his knot pumped out waves of sperm for a long time until he was drained, beaten. Anthony shuddered and moaned. Steven staggered, kept his balance but just barely.
Steve sat in the apartment that SHIELD had set him up with, staring at a manila folder with hope and nervousness. He remembered how fucking painful it felt when he read the file about Howard, Peggy, and his team and found out they all pass away.
After that Howard didn’t even bother keeping his infidelity a secret. He cheated on Maria whenever he needed something to numb his frustration which was at least two or three times a week. Most of his lovers were Omega, after all he still need an heir for his dynasty. But just as he failed to recreate super solder serum, revolutionize the arc reactor and searching for captain America, he failed to get another child which made him even more bitter and mean.
Tony looked over at him again. "He's a spy. Captain, he's THE spy. His secrets have secrets." He said, popped a blueberry into his mouth and chewed it. "It's bugging him too, isn't it?" Tony said, looking at Bruce with expectant eyebrows.
Tony cursed under his breath. He needed to get this insane attraction to Steve under control. This wasn’t him, he learned from his relationship with Maria, Howard, and Obie that seeking to make connections did one thing – broke him. He wasn’t going to be that little Omega again desperate for love and acceptance.
"You mean Rock of Ages giving up so easily?" Tony asked pointedly, his eyes sliding to the quiet villain. As much as he hated to admit it, Rogers was right, it had been too easy. He wasn’t a pessimist but usually, he was never this lucky.
Anthony felt their bond pulsed between them, raw, real, and with roots deep enough to wrap around and penetrate his brain, heart, and some deeper part of him he couldn’t name. The force of emotion flowed between them like an impossible two-way river. Warm fluttered and spark spread like wildfire through their body and set off fireworks in their curiously empty skull. Like Ambrosia, it addicted his mind, body, and senses completely.
Tony Stark is the first Omega who not only becomes a CEO of a multi-billionaire company he is the one who advance the original millionaire company into a multi-billionaire.
Instantly a grin lighted up his face. He finally got to meet his soulmate. Tony definitely knew how to make a first impression.
"Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag…" Tony started. Steve cut him off at that.
Tony’s reaction confirmed Steve’s belief. “The only thing you fight for was yourself,” said Rogers spitefully, felt some perverse satisfaction at the hurt and anger contorted Tony’s features.
To put it simply, both file and video of Tony Stark showed him in a very detail way as, having a god-given genius but he was a self-destructive, self-obsess asshole, who didn’t follow orders and couldn’t work well with others. Tony had defied the government and the army on multiple occasions that he should have been put to jail or charge for treason. ‘Iron Man yes… Tony Stark NO.’
Note: An alpha instinct toward their soulmate is stronger than Omega since their instinct is to protect their mate while an Omega instinct is more toward their children so I can see the bond affected Steve more than Tony…not to mention Tony has been rejecting the bond since he is 8 so it affect it strength
They were missing two members, his armor was damaged and Barton a. k. a Hawkeye was unconscious. Loki escaped and Coulson- Tony cut himself off there, swallowed the lump in his throat. He sighed, Bruce was probably right when he said the team really was more like a time bomb but he still held hope the guy would come through at the end. After all, Bruce saved Harlem.
Cap frowned at that, worried what his companion might say next. “Tony, these things are still coming!” Steve said trying to appeal to Tony any way he could.
Steve took a step closer, his own pulse thundered in his ears, drowning out the sound of the helicopter.
God! This day made a month and three weeks, a month and three weeks since he’d rejected Steve yet he still wasn’t over this. Even when he and Pepper slept on the same bed, it felt like there was an impenetrable wall between them. He knew Pepper was all too aware of it, and that was what he was afraid of.
They spent every Thursday afternoon doing anything she wanted, and he would massage her shoulders after a long day work, which usually got her into a good mood for sex.
‘The golden goose’ he had overheard Howard spoke to Obie about him. For a split second time paused. Until someone pressed play and the impact of Howard’s words hit him with the impact of a bowling ball. And like a dozen of skittles, his life came crashing down on him. He crumpled inside, hot tears streamed down his face as he struggled to bear the sudden overwhelming pain.
“In case you needed to kill me, but you couldn't! I know! I tried...!” Bruce shouted the bitterness in his voice was clear as day.
Tried lightening the mood, he turned to the crew and called “Raise the mizzenmast! Jib the topsails!” It didn’t work as he had thirty pairs of reproachful eyes turned on him. Pointing to the corner he called out, “That man is playing Galaga. Thought we wouldn’t notice. But we did.” Again with the reproachful look, was all Shield agents didn’t have a sense of humor.
Tony wasn’t stupid he knew what Steve expected from him; happiness, and to fill the emptiness in his life. And knowing how huge Steve’s lost was that was an unfair expectation to put on his or anyone’s shoulders. It would be just like his parent relationship. Both Howard and Maria just expected the bond to keep Howard’s interest in her without working on the relationship’s foundation.
“Exactly.” Tony sounded pain. “Look I get it you believe the fairy tale version of soul-mate; that meeting your soul-mate gives one the highest joy and contentment but that isn’t reality.”
He had tried to get over his fear, but every time he thought about exposing himself so completely and intimately with her, something inside him froze up and all he could see was Obie reaching for the Arc Reactor.
“What a waste,” Howard finally sighed reached out to grab the entire decanter of scotch.  “What a goddamn waste.”
The thought of Captain America saw him broken and emotionally raw devastated him more than he would ever admit and made him more furious than he had been in a long time. To top it off, not only did the Captain fine with SHIELD having blackmail material that could ruin all Tony hard work for a better world, he had rubbed it in his face!
The smaller man moved to the desk beside Tony's, tapped on the interactive screen, noted the information about the tesseract. Tony walked past him, eyes trained on Bruce and an idea formed.
Maria found out about the affair from the newspaper headline. For several seconds Maria didn’t comprehend– three long seconds during which Maria just stood there, staring at the picture of her soulmate cheating with his secretary. It propelled her into a world of hurt and pain. The kind of pain that made her wanted to rip her heart out of her chest. An ache that will always be there, no matter what. It's not numbed, and it's omnipresent. The room blurred in front of her eyes as her tears fell unbidden.
Funfact about the movie: Remember the scene in the helicopter with Tony and Steve before Thor come. Movie Tony was clearly trying to impress Steve based on the interview from Joss Whedon and RDJ.
Maria’s slumped back into her pillows, exhausted, tears running down her face. She felt emptiness, utter relief.
[Soulmate:] A person with whom you had an immediate connection the moment you met. The connection was so strong that you were drawn to them in a way you had never experienced before. As this connection developed over time, you experienced a love so deep, strong and complex, that you doubted you had ever truly loved anyone prior.
Fury and Shield doesn’t know about him and Howard because back then Alpha/Alpha and Omega/Omega relationship was treated like gay relationship in 1940.
Below, Steve, two gunmen ran in. The Alpha looked down, wondering if they were helped, they didn't look like shield agents. His suspicions were proved right as upon seeing him, they shot at him and threw grenades.
It was like they had six senses on what each other would do in battle and could work seamlessly with each other during missions. Steve, annoyingly made a habit to check the team for injury after a battle, and thanks to the blasted bond Steve could sense when Tony was lying about being okay.
Tony could see the others didn’t take this particularly well except Thor, Thor’s brow furrowed in confusion at the tension in the room.
Steve needed relief from the urgency that had been building, building, just beneath his skin. Pressed flush against Tony, one leg between the genius' thighs, and yes, Tony was rocking into the heat, that warmth, that hard-
Steve Rogers’ eyelids fluttered as they started to open in an unfamiliar room. He creased his forehead, something wasn’t right, firstly wasn’t he supposed to be frozen in ice. His eyes tracked around the room for a few seconds. Then he slowly lifted himself to sit on the edge of the bed
All of Tony’s hidden hope that his soulmate was a decent Alpha burnt out. ‘How could Captain America did this?! Was it because he saw me as his Omega and thought it was perfectly justified to blackmail me into submission?! BASTARD!’ Tony’s fist clenched and his nails dug into his palm until his hand bleeds.
My friend Kathyn co-write chapter and 11 with me. She doesn't have an AO3 account so I am credit her here
Tony’s happiness had a charge she could feel, as though he was a tree where lightning had struck and stayed to race through the branches. All the years she had known him, she never thought he could look so happy, so content. She vowed she would give her best to keep that bright happiness on his face.
Using the excuse of getting better marketing, he had named Tony creations as his because he didn’t want the world to know that his Omega son’s talent outstripped that of his own. Tony being the foolish, loyal son he was had let him!
The ten rings must have tortured him, Steve knew what happen to hostages during the war. And yet, Tony had flown back to the place that haunted him to rescue a village from the Ten Rings not long after that.
Tony’s answer showed Steve he didn’t have the commitment or conviction of a hero. “Always a way out…” an arrogant sneered that Tony wanted to wipe off his stupid face.
“I could get there faster.” Tony exclaimed, checked the location. Steve felt his protectiveness rose. There’s no way he would let his Omega endangered himself unnecessarily.
He blinked, then broke into a grin as if to hide his pain but failed to prevent a single tear falling from a corner of his eyes “... I don't have it.”
There was definite knife-edge sharpness to Tony's smirk. “Wow, you had a poor observation, Capsicle, this little pep squad was in for a rough ride. To think they planned to make us follow you into battle with that skill. Then again, seventy years in ice must have affected your brain somehow right?” he smiled, a wicked, barbed grin.
Loki turned to confront his brother, his expression as cold as ice. As always Thor had the rose-tinted view, from the top of the hierarchy it all looked glorious. Loki's bitter real view was a little different to that.
Before any more could happen, Tony heard Steve voice and a flat disk of metal ricocheted off both their chests and back to the captain who stood on top of a tree above them.
"Soul-bonding isn’t what you think it is. It is not sacred, it not glorious, and it sure as hell isn’t eternal happiness." Tony managed through what felt like a mouthful of sawdust, of chalk, of razor blades. He hated to destroy Steve’s naïve fantasy but he had to.
At that moment, Thor and Natasha marched into the lab. Bruce’s eyes narrowed angrily at the sight of her while Natasha kept her eyes right on him.
But Steve wasn’t listening anymore. He hastily grabbed his shield and dashed towards the hatch. He leaped out of the Quinjet after his wayward Twin-soul. Now, why did this felt like a dejavu?
He needed to go somewhere and cleared his head so he decided to go on a road trip. Being raised poor, he never had enough money to explore America, when he became Captain America he finally had the means to but he had been too busy fighting the war. Ironically when the America he knew had changed so much that he finally had the chance to explore it.
“I can make you come again in 15 minutes.” Tony's voice was caramel in coffee. With his free hand, he took hold of her waist, pivoting her closer “So can I?”
Thank goodness, Tony thought, he had adapted his suit to absorb electricity after his fight with whiplash.
Roger’s stare was unwavering, and Tony could do nothing but stare back. They stared at each other for what felt like hours. Close to him, Rogers was a sensual force, as if he exuded some elemental alpha temptation that was directed at Tony and Tony alone.
The suit had been heavily damaged and scratched up beneath the rushing spinners. His back flared up with pain. Tony could see the thrusters straining to keep him up, but he could still fly and his weapons still worked for the most part.
Bruce had held himself off from everyone, not wanting to get close, both for the protection of other people and himself. He didn't saw what Tony saw in him, something special and admirable. Tony saw someone who had a powerful, almost uncontrollable, internal drive yet was able to keep it in check. As a recovering alcoholic, Tony knew about learning to control yourself and how hard that could be.
“Goddamn it,” Howard hissed as he leaned back in his desk chair, a glass of scotch in one hand and something a lot like rage and disappointment dancing in his eyes. “You were supposed to be worth something.  You were supposed to GIVE ME my legacy.  Instead you gave me a useless Omega. And now you’re fucking worthless.” Anything related to him, especially by blood had to be perfect, to be an extension of his success not another failure. And that was what Tony was, another failure.
“As long as I can be with you and make you happy.” Steven sound so earnest. “If I can be with you, pride didn’t matter at all.”
Not wanting to hear Fury spewed bullshit, Tony projected his voice over the man’s rants. “I'm sorry, Nick.” Tony moved the monitor towards Fury which showed plans of the weapon, tore apart Fury’s lies. “What were you lying?” Tony asked with mock horror.
"Never do that again." he tried not to sound shaky. Tony's spine was as straight as a ruler. To Steve, it was like watching an actor tried to adjust his mask after an accidental slip on stage.
After failing in replicated the super-serum, searched for Captain America and revolutionized the arc reactor, Howard hated that another thing in his life had failed. He had turned all that hatred and frustration to his only child! Hell, he would never amount to anything to Howard other than a cash cow and his punching bag. And God did it hurt! To Howard, he was just something to be manipulated and gained from.
Maria held her newborn child. Tony was so cute, with big brown eyes that stared at his mother but there was no lightning strike of love when people first see their baby post-delivery that everyone talked about. Instead Maria couldn’t be more unmoved.
Howard was a steady drinker, in the summer of 1961, Howard’s drinking got heavier until he was borderline alcoholic.
“Anyone who thinks Howard Stark was a good man was either didn’t know shit about him, a huge liar or fucking stupid. All Howard ever cared about was himself and his legacy.”
Steve let out a gasp of panic at the sight of a face all too still, pale and silent. "No…" half-formed sobbed in every breath now, Steve bent in to listen for breathing or anything to prove he might just be unconscious and not dead. Tony wasn’t breathing.
He should felt awful for hiding he was bonded to Captain America from Pepper, but he wasn’t. Everyone was so convinced that meeting your soul-mate was the best thing that could ever happen to you that he couldn’t risk Pepper ever knowing about this.
Howard sat on the plush chair, smoking fine cigars in hand and cut crystal glasses of scotch at his elbows, far removed from the bedroom where his wife howled with pain.  He had no interest in the process of his Alpha son’s birth, only in the final product.
Instead of protecting and caring for him as Jarvis had, Obie found and cracked every single one of his issues and manipulated them perfectly. Then he committed the ultimate betrayal, cumulating in attacking Tony in his own home. Worse, his stupidity had put Pepper life on the line. Thank god, Coulson protected her. He owed the man a great debt.
He walked closer to the screens, scrunched his brow before covered one eye for a moment and raised his eyebrows.
It was worth a shot. He started cautiously, walked over to stand opposite Bruce with the screen between them.
“Uh... yep! No! Bad call! He loves his hamme…” Tony was cut off when Thor used his full body swing and thrust his hammer into his chest, slapping him onto his ass.
Steve’s eyes gleamed with guilt. He had walked into it resolved to focus on the mission and failed to realize the rest of the team weren’t soldiers. Sure, Natasha might have been affiliated with Shield long enough she could fall into a military mind-set. But half of the team was used to being a one-man team, with no back-up when things turned sour; the other half had been betrayed by their closest allies. Bruce had been running from the military for so long he knew their ploys better than they did. He should have help the guy like Tony did, instead of walking on eggshells around the man. He barely knew anything about Thor but the guy was a warrior, something Steve could relate to. Being Captain America was the only thing he still had, and he had failed to bring the team together.
“He wasn’t. I know without a doubt that Howard’s soul-mate was his wife, Maria Stark.” the sound of Fury’s heartbeat was steady, a sign he wasn’t lying but that could be trained.
“I know you’re not uncomfortable with technology.” He had seen Steve using the touchscreen on the Hellicarrier. "I thought you'd like an old-fashioned key better than a card. It had a chip planted in it to open the door.”
"I would pull it." Steve kept his voice calm despite the fast pounding of his heart. Anxious to keep his soul-mate safe from the rotors, Steve leaped like a cat across the gap, head to the lever and stand by it.
Loki slowly rose from the ground, his rage turned into mirth as recognition coloring his features, "The soldier." A laugh passed his lips as he used his scepter to stand, "the Man out of time."
A more interesting fact was Tony had donated away many of his valuables and gave more contracts to farmers… during the palladium poisoning debacle…
The final stitches had been sewn shut. After days of angry words bubbled low in his throat like something hot and acidic caught behind his teeth every time he was in the same vicinity with his dad, it gave him the best of feeling to finally gave Howard a piece of his mind before he left the Stark’s mansion for good. Took away any control his dad had over him and ending the little cycle of misery Howard had put him through. He prided himself on not repeating Maria’s mistake of being too dependent on Howard and too pathetic to break free.
