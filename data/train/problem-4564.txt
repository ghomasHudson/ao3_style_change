“Am I that obvious?” She asked with a little huff. Dean smirked all the same though, and he nodded.
Dean shrugged. “I had to get you to open the door, Cas.” He gave Castiel a boyish smile and Castiel growled before turned on his heel and stomping back into the room. He heard Dean close the door behind him. “I don’t apologize very often, so you might want to pay special attention.” Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He exhaled loudly and turned, taking in Dean’s body language. He might be acting cool, but his fists were clinched at his side and his shoulders looked tight. What was he nervous about?
“Fuck,” Castiel muttered under his breath. Missouri had been right. The witch was working with Alistair. That’s how he knew Dean was alive.
The other woman, a redhead, said something, but since her back was to Dean, he didn’t hear. “Fucking cunt,” the man said and leaned over threateningly. Dean grabbed his shoulder and hauled him back.
“That I do.” Then he sighed heavily and nibbled on his lower lip.
“You’d best state your business before I shoot your ass,” came Bobby’s voice from behind the, now open, door.
Dean avoided being alone with Cas that night. He was having thoughts he didn’t need to be having.
“Yes.”
“I’m ready.” Cas’ voice behind him made him turn. Cas was scrolling through his phone.
“Good morning, Mr. Winchester.”
“An engineer,” Castiel repeated softly, still in something of a trance. A lilting laugh came from the back room and broke through. “An engineer... yes, as a matter of fact.” He rose and motioned Dean to follow him. He normally wouldn’t leave a book that valuable alone with a client until the money changed hands, but he wasn’t thinking with his upper brain. “I’m not sure which type of engineer you are, but I have a lithograph dating back to the mid-eighteen hundreds of the mechanism that raised and lowered the Terre Haute Drawbridge in Indiana.”
“She comes first.”
"I'll take you up on that, Dean," Gabriel said, his smile warm. Castiel stayed glued to the spot, Claire busily played with the ribbon. Dean didn't look at Castiel again. He walked out through the swinging kitchen doors. Gabriel waited until the doors stopped moving before rounding on Castiel.
“Really?”
“Hello, Brotha’.” A burly man came out from behind a large stainless-steel vat. “What are you doing here. I thought you had a thing with Claire.”
Sometime later, he woke in the dark room. His phone vibrated again and he hurried to get to it before Dean heard it. Meg’s name was on the screen. He answered with a harsh hiss. “What?”
“Sue, leave it alone. His hair’s great the way it is.” Everyone in the room stared at Dean, including Castiel himself.
“Well, a lot of people don’t want a readymade family. John is part of the package. He wasn’t
Dean’s laugh made Castiel’s smile widen. “Why do I have the feeling most of the trouble in the Novak family ends with ‘it was Gabriel’s idea’?”
“So, get this. I told my station manager that he was in town and he’s going to let me interview him.”
“That metal’s gonna be hot. Want a set of gloves?” Walker called out from his truck.
He felt the steady beat of Cas’ heart under his palm. Cas’ hands rested on Dean’s waist, fingers curling into his skin. Then ever so slowly, they moved to span his lower back before moved down to cup his ass. Cas brought them even closer together, their hips flush against each other. He felt Cas’ thick cock and it sent a shiver up his spine. He’d had men over the years, but those times consisted of fumbled hand jobs and half-hearted blowjobs. Cas had been the only man to ever fuck him. He didn’t know how to ask for that. Back then, he hadn’t needed to ask. Cas just knew him.
“You remembered. I’m impressed. My turn though. Ethnic food?”
“I haven’t decided to take it yet.”
Benny strode over to Cas belt and fished the key out of the snap enclosure. He tossed it in the air, caught it, and grinned before coming to Dean’s side of the bed and setting it on the nightstand. “Y’all have fun.”
“Rowena.” She rolled her eyes and then stared at her fingernails in boredom.
“I wouldn’t date a younger woman either. I want someone in my own generation. And I’m forty-four.” Dean nodded. So, the professor was only three years older than him. “He’s jealous of you.”
There is a brief Ketch/Castiel scene in this chapter, but nothing goes beyond touching/kissing.
“Novak. How did you hear?”
Castiel cracked a small smile at that. “No offense taken. Gabriel can be hard to deal with. People either love him or hate him. There is no in between.” Gabriel must have made an impression to be remembered by someone like Dean Winchester. He wasn’t sure if it was a good one or a bad one though.
“Yeah,” the taller one, Sam, said, his hands coming together in his eagerness. “I’ve been looking online, but I really wanted to see it before I spent that kind of money.”
Dean nibbled on his lower lip for a few seconds and then spoke again. “I have an idea. My brother, Sam, works for a local network. He’s a reporter.”
“Yeah, but that was then. You’re my employer now.”
“Not at all. I just know what I’m doing. This one is done. Shall we move on?”
The porch light was on and he knocked. Mildred’s face lit up when she saw him. She pulled him into her arms and the hug felt like coming home. “I’ve missed you, boy.”
“No one likes a backseat driver.” At the entrance to the shopping center, Dean couldn’t get into the turn lane and had to turn around at the next light. Cas smiled knowingly, but didn’t say anything.
“Is this about Castiel flying in Tuesday?” Dean looked up, shocked.
“If I tell you, it won’t be a secret anymore.” Dean drummed his fingers on the table, watching Castiel as he took another bite.
Cas followed him out of the kitchen and up the familiar staircase. Cas paused at was once Dean’s room and Dean looked over his shoulder. “I moved into the master a couple years ago. Sam said I needed to put the ghosts to rest.”
“I’m Mr. Krushnic,” he said and indicated their bags. “We’re ready.”
“You should,” Cas said softly. Dean turned and put his hand on the doorknob. His eyes caught the leash hanging by the door and the entire afternoon rushed back at him.
He knew better. Then he told himself it was just to see the farm. After John’s death, he’d spent so much time there. It was more of a home than the house he shared with Naomi. At first, he’d sat in the car and looked out over the barns and fields of wheat. Then he saw movement and his breath caught in his throat when Dean stepped onto the porch. He’d know the bowed legs anywhere. His body felt a rush of heat when he remembered how they wrapped around him as he pushed inside of Dean. Dean had been his first.
man. If you want to prove your dick is bigger than mine, I suggest we do it after my work is done.”
“Fifteen minutes.” Dean saw the bottle of whiskey on the table. He poured himself a shot and swallowed it down. The burn took his breath away. Bobby kept rotgut, not the good shit Dean was used to at his own place. They stood in silence until a pair of headlights appeared in the window. Bobby turned. Dean narrowed his eyes. Bobby looked haggard, more so than usual.
“So, what is the problem?” Dean shrugged and pulled open Ellen’s top drawer. He pulled out the bottle of Jameson he knew she kept there and twisted off the cap. She took two shot glasses off the shelf behind her and sat them on the desk. Dean poured the amber liquid. He shot the whiskey and leaned back letting the smooth liquid soothe him. She downed hers in smaller sips. They both sat the glasses back on the desk. When Dean went to pour another round, Ellen put her hand over them. Dean sighed dramatically, but set down the bottle.
“She got into a tussle with another female. It happens sometimes,” Castiel told him, using the pliers to push the needle in again for the last stitch.
The man appeared in the doorway, dressed in his uniform. Dean watched as his expression when from concern to confusion. Cas rattled the cuffs. “It seems my husband was too turned on to think clearly. Ow.” Dean’s elbow to Cas’ ribs had the intended effect.
“I do, but that was only supposed to be temporary. He’s married. They have their own lives. They don’t need me there cramping their style.”
“Damn you,” Castiel hissed. Desire and need pulsed through his veins and he slammed Dean against the wall. His lips crashed down, taking Dean’s mouth in a scorching, brutal kiss. Dean didn’t respond for the first few seconds and then he was giving as good as he got. Fingers dug into Castiel’s waist and he retaliated by yanking on Dean’s hair. God, it was so good to
Cas looked away, his features hard and cold.
way made his stomach roll. He’d barely made it through the
“I’m willing to take that risk. Now, can we go?”
“And your mother and I are proud of the work you do for the company to keep the Gulf safe. What do you need from us?”
Castiel relaxed and resumed his position against the counter. “It makes sense.” All their employees were dedicated to the company, but they should be just as loyal toward their supervisors.
with that mental image.” Castiel’s eyes widened at his own boldness.
Tran let her gaze sweep the room. “Any questions?” Missouri Mosely, the witch who took John Winchester’s seat when he was killed, got to her feet. “Yes, Madam Mosely?”
“Yes, dear.”
“Why are you telling me this?” Castiel’s head was reeling. Was he being fired and pawned off to the FBI?
“No.” Dean blocked the doorway. What was he doing? Wasn’t this what he wanted? Time away from Cas. Cas had donned his coat and was staring at Dean. “I’ll give you a ride... to your hotel.”
It was dry and almost painful, but Cas wasn’t giving in. Dean was fucking into his fist. Needing it… wanting it. Lips crashed onto his, bruising. Dean thought he tasted blood. It wouldn’t be the first time Cas had drawn blood during sex.
Castiel reached for a plate and held it out. Dean gave one more flick of his wrist, folding the omelet and then slid it onto the waiting dish. He used tongs to lift the perfectly rare steak and added it Castiel’s meal. “Voilà.”
“Fuck.” His foot was back, but higher this time, rubbing his inner thigh. “You owe me a blowjob, so I’ll counter with some sixty-nine action if you come with me to the store tonight.”
“Just thought you’d like to see a familiar face before your first day on the job.”
After hanging up, he looked at the closed bathroom door. Dean had carried his bag in there while Castiel made his call.
Dean joined them before he could ponder further. “Sammy, give me my kid.” He grabbed up Claire and tossed her into the air. Her giggles loud and infectious.
“Really. Imagine that...” Dean pulled him close and kissed him. “With tongue,” he murmured against Cas’ mouth.
When the doorbell rang, he frowned and set the basket of clean clothes on the couch. It was probably Sam. Who else would be here before nine o’clock?
“Already?” His tone must have showed his feelings because Dean moved closer to him.
“Wait, you have some of these?” Sam moved closer to Castiel. “John said you had turtles, but I didn’t expect anything like those.”
“Will you be arresting him?” She stood as well and moved closer to him. He could smell her sickening sweet perfume.
Back in the living room, he sat down on the coffee table and took a few more seconds to watch Cas sleep. As if sensing him, Cas blinked sleepily. “You’re home.” It was an innocent way to refer to wherever you were staying, but Dean took it to heart. He smiled softly.
“Dean, Madame Tran wants to talk with us before we leave.”
Dean swallowed. “He’s a single dad, Crowley. Maybe it...”
.” Walker saluted him with his forefinger and rolled up the window before driving off.
He rolled over and got on his hands and knees, crawling toward the edge of the bed and Dean stepped closer. “You look fucking perfect, babe.” Castiel looked up for a brief second and then took Dean into his mouth. Dean’s groan went straight to his own throbbing cock. Hands dug into his scalp and he relished the pain. “Oh, man, that’s it... suck me.”
It took him a week to get his paperwork ready for his transfer. He’d talked to his new superior in Montgomery, a man named Fergus Crowley. He’d been with Interpol before immigrating to the US, marrying an American woman, and going through the ranks of the FBI. His condo was on the market and everything he owned was either in the Corvette’s passenger seat or on a truck headed for Alabama. He wondered if Missus Howell’s house was still available to rent.
Castiel took one more look into the mirror. He was feeling self-conscious in the shirt Jack had bought him to wear. He believed in the message behind it though. Any parent who tossed their kid to the curb because they came out as gay, bi, trans, or any of the other parts of the spectrum were worthless, in his opinion. He straightened his shoulders, nodded to his reflection, and turned. “Good enough?”
Castiel bit his lip to keep from laughing. He folded the note and tucked it into his back pocket before removing the tape from Kojo’s back. The balloons came inside with him.
“Milton?” A look of horror crossed her face. “Is he related to Pastor Milton?” She asked, then answered herself. “No, surely not, he’s one of those Democrats. Or maybe even a Communist.” She said the words with a sneer.
Conversation stayed on the menu for a time and Castiel let his mind wonder. The riverboat filled rather quickly with esteemed guests and he found himself separated from Meg. He knew she’d be fine on her own, so he moved to the upper deck just as the whistle blew announcing they were leaving the dock. He leaned on the railing and watched as the paddlewheel churned the water. The breeze off the Mississippi River dispelled the stagnant humidity of the city.
. The three of them could be a family.
Dean swallowed and sank down in his chair. He closed his eyes and counted to ten. The thought of Alistair’s hands on his body made his blood run cold. “Suck it up, Winchester,” he whispered to himself. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d sold himself.
“No. Trust me, you will be in love with this before the end of the day.”
A full minute ticked by. Cas knew because he counted. It kept him from panicking. If Dean changed his mind...
At the Council doors, he stopped to wait. Dean would sit with him. It was expected. One by one, the members filed into the great room to pay their respects. Dean appeared with the Amazon. Castiel saw him hesitate when their eyes met. “Hello, Dean.” He looked good in the suit and tie. Where had he gotten that?
“You’d know,” mumbled Frank, reaching into the cabinet for mugs. He knew these two were unstoppable, so Castiel got the milk out of the fridge and set it on the small kitchen table. Mildred eventually got the thing working and the rich smell of coffee made his mouth water.
“Mildred can bake bread for sandwiches,” he said, distaste evident as he picked up the jar of peanut butter. We can buy bread flour and yeast and she can make several loaves.”
“You first though?” Castiel tilted his head and waited for Dean’s response.
“None of the other kids’ parents are coming,” she reverted to whining since the yelling wasn’t going to make a difference.
“Do it, Cas.” With a gentle press, the head of Castiel’s cock pushed inside. There was a moment of resistance and then tight heat surrounded him. He groaned and squeezed his fist. It felt do damn good. Dean’s head was hanging down and Castiel used his other hand to smooth over the bunched muscles. He stayed still, waiting for Dean. “Okay... more.”
“Two.” There was silence on Sam’s end. “Bobby has something to say.”
Dean’s mind came into focus fast. “Whoa, lifeboats? I thought this thing was stationary.” He’d taken the emergency course, but seeing them lined up... well, it was kind of scary.
“I’m sorry, Dean. Perhaps if you would wear a robe or wrap your beautiful body in a shroud, I wouldn’t be distracted.”
OIM or Offshore Installation Manager. This is the person who oversees everything on an offshore oil rig.
“I’ll be ready.” He hung up and looked back at Frank and Mildred. “I’m afraid the zoo trip is off. I will need you two to leave the area.”
Dean looked out at the desolate countryside. If he turned around, he knew the palace would have disappeared. “You...” He couldn’t finish. The words scared the fuck out of him.
“No, I meant the chickens.” Castiel’s expression was incredulous and he actually took a step between Dean and the coop.
“We’ll stop by the restaurant and grab your things, and if it is alright with you, we can fix a light meal at my place.”
“You know, when I married you, I didn’t think you were this much of an asshole,” Dean said, shifting his gaze back to the ceiling.
“While bondage is something I personally enjoy, I’d need to get to know you better first, Deputy Winchester.” Then the motherfucker touched his forehead with his forefinger in a brief salute and sauntered down the sidewalk.
money and Sam had a couple of cards that weren’t maxed out yet.
Sam looked up from his laptop clenching his jaw in thought, “All couples?”
Leo’s eyes twinkled with amusement as he sipped his mimosa. It was in a slender flute and was definitely more champagne than juice. “Mikhail and I are professors in New York; he teaches European History and I teach Greco-Roman Art History. We make enough.” He pointed with his drink back at Nicole, the woman blushed, hiding behind a diamond ringed hand. “
“Fuck.”
Heather shrugged, "It's a creature from Germany, don’t know too much about it. I just commissioned the woodworker to make an intricate frame." Dean nodded, someone had to know more about this.
“With consent.” Andrew and Liv echo.
“Okay. Alright. That’s idiotic, Dad.” She emphasized that point by glaring at him before continuing her point. “But this is kinda good. People with common sense won’t commit a hate crime in front of a ton of other people.”
trust this lady. Dean looked around for a way out. A quick glance to her husband confirmed that he hadn’t even noticed how she had leaned in- he was dead to the world, buried in the local newspaper. Ximena was tapping away on a Blackberry that looked like it had seen better days and a dejected Ivy had joined Mikhail and Leo in a conversation about Italian sculptors. “Cas is a, uh,” He needed to think of something quick, something that explained the odd mannerisms and extensive knowledge, “Theologist.” Nicole’s eyebrows climbed into her hair, she leaned forward even more. “He’s freelance at universities, goes from place to place.”
hi! i actually had to break this chapter into two chapters. expect another one to be out today or tomorrow
"Hey Bobby, what do you know about alps?"
A teasing smile crept onto Sam’s face, he raised his voice into a higher pitch. “
“Anyway, it was freaky! I’m like ‘Hey man, I didn’t see anything, Imma just go, Ion want any trouble.” Andrew nods, those are all very sensible things. “And then!” Andrew raises his brows at the exclamation. “And then. The angel turns into a man. He’s, maybe, forty? But he looks really odd with these real bright blue eyes.” Andrew blinks and Liv nods her head fervently. “Yeah. I know. Fucking insane, right?”
Dean looked in the rearview mirror, locking eyes with Castiel. “Cas, don’t encourage this. What if this resort, uh, doesn’t like the taste of the rainbow?” He didn’t want to get run out of town before they could save these people’s lives. Although, he wouldn’t especially care at that point.
“The girl was checking you out?”
, questioning and getting under Dean’s skin.
Dean was in something wet.
The light is back before Andrew can respond and the thing from the back room is hovering in with the- admittedly very attractive older white guy- trailing behind it. They stop at the booth and Andrew spies Liv cringe away from the angel's faces. The white guy recognizes her instantly and gets an alarmed look on his face. “What are you both, huh?” His voice is low, but threatening. He leans down and fixes Andrew with a hard stare. “You want to come in here and ruin my life, is that it? Who sent you?”
“I just want to make sure you are okay, we’ll talk about it some more over some food, is that okay?” Liv was silent and Andrew groaned internally, “Grab your shoes, let’s go.”
Heat creeped up Dean’s neck, traveling up to his ears and over the bridge of his nose, his freckles standing out against the red skin. He smiled, running his tongue over his teeth. How could Dean bullshit this away? “Uh, just getting in character. Y’know, the whole fake married thing.” Dean was a method actor, it didn’t matter that the nickname had been something Dean was itching to call Castiel. Cas stared at him, eyes searching for something and Dean turned away. “I’m going to go do some recon.” All but running to the door, Dean paused. He looked back at Cas, the man barely staying on his feet, and sighed. “And seriously, dude, take a nap.”
“Fucking nerd.”
“There’s only one bed.”
“Ha ha Casper. Very funny.” Dean rolled his eyes as Leo mock bowed.
"So that's it? I tell you I can see angels and you take me to a restaurant?" Liv started to get angry. Andrew thought back to Teenagers and You: The Guide to Single Parenthood; what would they do? Damage control, for one.
“No. I don’t think it is.” Castiel replied. And it was the same gravelly, serious voice- this time with a confused undertone. Castiel ran a hand through Dean’s hair, he sighed at the contact.
To top it all off, vibrant, cherry colored rose petals were strewn on the floor, leading from the door to the plush, cream colored king size bed. The bed and bathroom were on a step across from the lounge area in the middle of the room. Log columns accented the walls and framed the balcony door that led to a firepit and two recliners. Soft looking loveseats sat across from each other with a glass and oak coffee table between them. The entire room had hardwood floors, but ivory rugs sat underneath the lounge and bed. It was admittedly beautiful.
“I got a call from the US Fish and Wildlife Service and they are sending a man here to tag and observe some of our alligator population. Apparently, our numbers are up.”
“Yeah. Most New Yorkers wouldn’t set foot in a club like this before seven. So, where are you from?”
For those out of the US or those that don't follow football, there is a huge revelry between Auburn University and the University of Alabama. Living in Alabama means you have to pick one or the other, thems the rules. I'm an Auburn fan. Any other Auburn or Alabama fans out there?
“Dean, the jealous child act is getting old. What is your real issue with Stephany? She is a civilian, but then, so am I.
“Not a problem, mate. Follow me.” It turned out that his dressing room was only three doors down from Dean’s. There was no nameplate, just the number twelve in brass. Compared to Dean’s, it was small, but enough for Castiel to be comfortable. “You have five minutes before you’re needed in makeup. You remember where it is?” Castiel nodded in the affirmative and Balthazar left him to his own devices. He looked around at the mirror, a wardrobe rack hung with various pairs of slacks and shirts, and a fruit basket left on the small dressing table. He read the card. “
“Can’t a guy come see his favorite brother without an ulterior motive?” Sam even managed to look contrite. It made Dean shake his head in disbelief. “Mandy’s doing great by the way. She even showed up this morning. I’m thinking about letting her do her own column.”
“Cold,” he said dryly. She laughed and gave the driver an address. “Plans?”
“No arguments.” Dean was already walking out the door, and he had no choice but follow. Soon, Castiel found himself in front of wardrobe and Dean opened the door. “Hey, man, Cas needs his clothes back.”
“I just heard. It’s all over town.” His gaze landed on Dean. “What is the point of having a brother who’s in law enforcement if he doesn’t tell me important things.”
Now, in his room, Dean had an epiphany. He’d never stopped loving Cas. And seeing that tattoo spread beautifully over Cas’ back was all the proof he needed that Cas loved him back then. In that moment in time, all the anger and the pain disappeared. He’d have tonight to show Cas he was worth fighting for. That they were worth fighting for.
“You didn’t even call me when Mary... when she got sick,” Cas’ voice was broken. But that wasn’t what happened. He’d called. He’d lost count of how many times he’d called.
“I wanted to check on you.” Her voice changed from teasing to concerned. “I’ve been worried.”
They’d been talking every night. Dean made a special point to call before Claire’s bedtime to talk to her. He was always at the restaurant and it made it all the more special that he was taking time out of his busy schedule to make time for them. All his doubts had faded away. It might be difficult to have a long-distance relationship, but he was willing to try his best.
Snorting at the absurdity of it all, Dean shook his head. “Anything. I used to work in a grocery store bakery, but no one is hiring.” That they weren’t hiring
“We set poisoned meat on hooks and once it took the bait, we followed the buoy attached to the hook.”
Finally, Dean blew out a breath and turned to him. “I don’t know what to say, Cas. Help me out here.” Castiel could only stare. A minute, then two ticked by. “Claire... Cas... Fuck.”
“Let’s get on with it then,” Dean said and waited for his cue. The show was filmed before a live audience so when Dean walked onto the set and took his mark, the crowd roared. Not only was he an award-winning chef, he looked like an underwear model and the women loved him. The cameras loved him as well, which is how the year old show held the best time slot on the Network.
“Yeah, I figured as much. Look, I don’t know how long you plan on being here, but you might want to keep a low profile. People like her...” He rubbed the back of his neck and looked away. “Let’s just say we have some good people here in Coosa Falls and some that... think their beliefs override everyone else’s.”
“Kind of the opposite really,” Dean mumbled, eyes alighting on a black and white photograph of a small waterfall framed on the wall.
He stepped into the kitchen. Bobby stood at the sink, staring at his reflection in the darkened window. “Sam coming?”
Sam was giving him one of those smiles. The ones that basically said, ‘
Alistair stayed away from the restaurant until Tuesday. He showed up mid-service and insisted on talking to Dean. It wasn’t until Dean felt the hand on his ass, that he saw red. Slamming the sauté pan onto the burner, he whirled around. “
“Would you like to call Dean?” He imagined Dean was at the restaurant, so they wouldn’t keep him. Castiel just wanted to tell Dean he got home okay. That was what boyfriends did.
“By who?” Cas’ voice rose several octaves. “By who, Dean?”
Castiel
“Meg, I have to go.”
“Cas? Nah, he’s just a...”
“Ro-wen-a. My God, man, it’s not that difficult.” She eyed his storage room with distaste. “This is a hovel.” She flicked an imaginary bit of lint off her dress. “Would you have spot of tea?”
kind of guy and Cas, well he was smoked salmon on toast points. What the hell was a toast point anyway?
“Yes. Lilith Carrigan,” the deputy said, crossing his arms across his chest. And a nice chest it was. Broad shoulders... narrow waist... all in all, a near perfect package. “Miss Carrigan was killed sometime last night.”
“Why?”
“Don’t care, Cas,” Dean said and then to prove it, he took off his sunglasses and removed his baseball cap, sitting it loosely on Claire’s head. She laughed in delight and reached up to play with it. Dean was aware of a few people pulling out their phones to take pictures. “Cas, listen... being with me means being in the spotlight sometimes. I’ll do my best to keep you and Claire safe from all that, but I’m not ashamed of my feelings for you.”
“I guess. I’m just glad she was picked for this trip. I never thanked you. She was over the moon when she got the email, man.”
Sam managed to look chagrinned. “We don’t really eat in much.”
Gabriel entered the room with a wide smile on his face. "Hey, Lil Bro. Good job with the contest. What did you think of Dean Winchester? I’ve met him before. He's hot...for a guy, and really a great person. He does a lot of shit for charity. I'd love the chance to cook with him myself."
Dean appeared again, dressed in scrubs. He placed a gentle kiss on their daughter’s head, a tricky feat to do without stopping the motion. Then he leaned in to kiss Cas. “Don’t wait up. You have surgery in the morning.”
“Don’t be a dick. Let me in.”
“Rowena, so help me God, I’m going to murder you.”
“You know why I sent you away. I explained…”
No one in the boat was moving and that was a good thing. The alligator needed to take the bait, not come after the threat. “Come on, girl...” Castiel whispered.
“Ten-four, Rufus.” Dean stood and left the office. In the main room of the station, he leaned his hip on Linda’s desk. “Good morning, Beautiful.”
“Dee,” she whimpered and he smiled. She remembered him from the Facetime chats.
“Visiting? So, you got custody?”
Castiel told him what he suspected, pulled the cast out of his messenger back, and showed him the pictures on his camera. “This is a rogue alligator and needs to be found before it kills more livestock or possibly a human.”
The grocery store was almost anti-climactic in comparison. He let Cas pick out the flour and other staples. Hamburger was added, as well as canned tomato products and spaghetti noodles. Dean was great at inexpensive meal planning. He’d grown up feeding Sam on stolen food and cheap ingredients.
“The professor must have sneaked out and got him some last night,” said Ben, leering comically.
Her pain was evident in her written words and Castiel looked at the date again. Had she tried to call him? Had she needed a shoulder to cry on? Would he have even been there for her? At that time, Castiel had been working hard at the bakery in San Francisco and enjoying the freedom of living in a city where being gay was more accepted instead of a social stigma.
Dean walked slowly back to the cabin, watching his feet. One foot in front of another. One step closer to moving on. A bitter laugh escaped.
Seeing him in that alley, beautiful and alive was all Dean needed to make him whole again. Holding him in his arms would have to do for now, but soon, he’d get the courage to tell Cas how he felt.
“No.”
“If you don’t take the position, I’ll type of a reprimand for your file and you’ll be on probation for six months.”
“Dogs,” Dean shouted, then sighed. “Fuck, we are not doing a game show.”
“Yeah, but he doesn’t know that,” Dean said with a sigh.
He wasn’t lying. An airport bus dropped them off in the front of a hotel that reminded Dean of a Motel Six back in the states. There were no fancy doormen and Novak took care of checking them in. They milled around the lobby until he returned.
“Great. Just fucking great,” he mumbled under his breath.
“No,” Dean said peevishly. “Let’s get moving. We have more water to cover.”
Castiel showed them through the medical facility and then led them into the reptile house. They were behind the tanks away from the crowds. This was his world. Sam, once they were properly introduced, asked questions, as did John, but Dean was looking queasy as Castiel pulled yet another animal out of its tank. “And this is Morelia Viridis, better known as the Emerald Tree Boa. This is a beautiful female. They are found in the rain forests of Central and South America.” He held her out for their inspection, but Dean stepped behind his brother.
Dean glanced at his watch. The hour hand was getting close to eleven and they had to shop, drive back to the farm, and fix lunch. He didn’t want this seven day challenge to drag on any longer than it had to. Cas’ cart was filling rapidly with rolls of paper, gaily colored gift bags, and curly bow things. “Cas, come on, man. Time’s a’wastin’.” For his effort, he got a look that told him to fuck off. “Great,” he muttered and headed for the food aisle.
"You've heard of them?" Charlie looked shocked.
Trust me when I say that the collage at the bottom of the chapter is NSFW.
He moved ahead to the day Claire was born. He and Gabriel had flown in because they didn’t want Anna to be alone. Sure, she had friends, but Anna had always been standoffish to other women and never allowed anyone to get too close.
“Meg said yes.”
“Yes.”
“Mister Rolston’s office,” the voice said into Dean’s ear.
“Oh, you know... laundry, hanging out with the family, a road trip to New Iberia.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel scooped her up and swung her skyward. She giggled and clapped her hands. To Jo, he asked, “Was she a good girl today?”
“Nope, but it wouldn’t change my answer.” Then Dean’s brain cells ramped up. This could fix his problem with Alistair. “Hypothetically, what would the fee be?”
“What’s going on?” Castiel asked, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
When the van was loaded, Mildred took Castiel aside. “I have a good feeling about you two. Keep me updated on Facebook.”
The wallet was one Sam had given the angel years ago. The brown leather was worn with age. A twenty was tucked inside. The same bill Dean gave him last week. “
? He may have well said
“It’s not that type of job, Gabriel. Food Network has offered me a position as a guest host on Spice of Life. It would be one or two episodes a month.”
“Yes.” Dean’s hands reached around him, flat against his stomach and belly. His chin rested on Cas’ shoulder. “I’ve never loved anyone else.”
“Sie war unsere Freudin... und im Rat.” = “She was our friend... and on the Council,”
“But you don’t know how a story ends until you turn the page. Life is risky.” She glared up at Dean, standing several inches taller than her five-and-a-half-foot frame. Dean looked from her to Castiel.
“Nope. That’s from my wallet,” he said, holding up his leather trifold.
“She looks like you. I don’t know why I didn’t see it. Anna’s hair was always red, never blonde.”
“Not that I’m aware of.” The slamming of the door was Dean’s response. Castiel raked his fingers through his wet hair. Dean was acting like a petulant child. Was it jealousy? Why? He didn’t want Castiel and Dean knew he was gay. The man was making him crazy.
Castiel checked his boarding pass and huffed. He had to uproot his entire life and they couldn’t even spring for first class. He packed away his laptop and waited for priority seating, then people traveling with young children. Finally, it was his turn and he made his way to his seat. He was stuck in the aisle and tried his best to pull his six-foot frame into the small space provided.
Thursday morning, Dean was practically dancing on his marks. Both Charlie and Benny sent him knowing smiles. Even the lowest of the crew members knew Cas and Claire were coming because Dean had mentioned it to everyone. At least twice.
“Okay,” John said, but didn’t look happy to leave the tortoises. The three of them were all standing close to the boy, obviously waiting for another handout. Food was their biggest motivator.
“But...”
Parking in the loading zone, he turned his hazard lights on and stepped out, daring the rent-a-cop to tell him to move his vehicle. He was on official business... kind of.
“Is it true?”
John’s secretary, Abby, looked up when they entered. “Warden Winchester, Chief Winchester is waiting on you.” Jo shrugged and sat down on one of the chairs to wait. Dean tapped his knuckles on the door once before opening it.
“Yes, ma’am,” he responded loudly because Miss King was hard of hearing. He saw the lights on in the window of the Coosa Falls Gazette and pushed the door open. “Sammy?”
“Huh, weird,” Sam said, his gaze on Claire, who was sitting on the edge of the table swinging a spoon around.
“Mr. Milton. Welcome to Coosa Falls. I am so excited you’re here.” Strangely enough, she did sound a little too enthusiastic. “Did you find the place okay? Of course, you did. A world traveler like yourself. It’s not like you could get lost in our little town.” She snorted when she laughed. “I’m just right around the corner. Hold onto your panties and I’ll be right there.”
“What now?” Dean asked, his hand near the top of the door frame, causing his shirt to ride up, exposing an inch of delicious skin.
“I cared for you, Castiel. I could love you,” she whispered and he was relieved to see the resignation in her gaze. She touched her neck where his hand had held her.
“Now, could you let go of Cas’ hand so he can pour us a grown-up drink?” John frowned, but did as he was told. He stayed in Castiel’s personal space though, leaning slightly against his left leg.
“Claire and I are flying to New York. I’ve got to co-host the show on Friday and Monday. Dean wants me to bring Claire so we can take her to the zoo.”
, Cas made it clear sex wasn’t on the table.
“What’s got you looking so happy?”
With the arrival of the tow truck, traffic was at a complete standstill which made it easier for Dean to pull out onto the road in front of the wrecked car. The Texas Wildlife Rehabilitation Coalition wasn’t far from the accident and they pulled into the parking lot and then through the gate to the back of the building.
been openly hostile yesterday. Then, the enigma that was Dean Winchester had fixed lunch for the two of them, had brought coffee, and as the afternoon had worn on, assisted in tagging the alligators without complaint.
Cas' mouth quirked up at the corners, and he opened his door.
“Hi, it’s happy hour. Can I get you a drink?”
In the truck thirty minutes later, Dean broke the silence. “I’ll need to call this in.”
“Castiel. Dude, you’re just in time. I need a guinea pig.” He took one of the tasting spoons from the bin and dipped it into the sauce.
The first two told him to fill out an application and leave it. He did, knowing he wouldn’t be called back because of the fifteen-year gap in jobs. His third stop was at one of those super stores, he filled out an application in the coffee shop and was told to wait for the manager. The balding man looked it over, made a humming sound, and asked Dean about the gap. “I was sent to prison, but exonerated.”
Cas had a life in Atlanta. Hell, he had a kid.  No room for someone like Dean. It was a pipe dream. Like he and Cas could live happily ever after. Life wasn’t a fuckin’ fairy tale.
“He asked me to share another bottle of strawberry wine with him and you know Benny, he made it sound suggestive. I think he was trying to get a rise out of Dean. Anyway, Dean didn’t seem to like the fact that I might be gay.”
While he was dressing in his second pair of jeans, these too tight, he heard the shower in the master bedroom turn on. Good, he had about thirty minutes to clear his head. Downstairs, he opened the back door and stepped out on a flagstone patio. A wrought iron bistro set sat under a blooming crape myrtle. He stood in the sunlight, listening to the sound of bees buzzing among the flowers. The yard looked professionally landscaped and, knowing Sam, it probably was.
“Everyone, please leave Dean alone. You’ve put him on the spot,” Castiel said quietly.
Castiel flung the door open and pulled up when he saw Dean and an elderly woman in expensive attire standing next to him. She smiled and said, “Forgiveness doesn’t change the past, young man, but it does enlarge the future.” She gave them both a nod and slowly walked toward the elevators.
“Seriously, that’s pretty awesome. I don’t do anything that fascinating. I just build houses.”
“What are you looking to do?”
Castiel rested his arms on his thighs, his hands clasped between his knees. “I’ve had a job offer.”
Cas, for his part, was quiet. He stared at the buildings and people that made up the Big Apple. Dean dared a few quick glances. He caught Ash’s knowing smirk in the rearview mirror and vowed to fire him the next chance he got. He’d be home napping on his memory foam if it wasn’t for his driver. Alone. Missing out on one of the best blowjobs he’d ever had.
The trip was a
He grinned sheepishly. "Yeah."
Sam stopped mid-sentence and glared at Dean. “I’m sorry you had to be paired with my brother, Doctor Novak. Sometimes he’s just... rude.”
“I got your note. Isn’t that what you asked?”
“What is this, an interview? Are you good enough for my dad?” Charlie clapped her hands. “We should do a game show.
.  He would have to put that on his Facebook page.
“This ain’t going to fix itself.”
In lieu of answering, Dean huffed under his breath and began playing with his phone. It was like being in the car with Jack and Claire. He was glad when they reached the farm. He parked in his driveway and the three of them unloaded the groceries they’d bought.
“Sure.” Dean gave him a lopsided smile and a nod of understanding.  Everybody had crap they carried around with them. Dean had lost his mother at four and lost his alcoholic father when he was in his late twenties. Shit happened. And you didn’t talk about it.
Castiel sent him a bashful look. “As my kids would say, ‘hell, no’. I’m a disaster. Jack, my youngest, does most of the cooking. I’m not sure what I will do once he’s off to college next year. I do love to try new restaurants and cuisines. It must be nice being married to a good cook.”
“You can’t wear those cloths anymore, Dean. They make
“More than a few minutes.”
“Night, Cas.”
“She’s definitely smart. Gets it from her mom’s side of the family.”
Castiel lowered his forehead to rest on the steering wheel. He had no idea how long it was until Dean got back into the Jeep. Minutes or hours, he couldn’t have said. He’d spent his time thinking of Claire’s firsts. Her first word. Her first tooth. Her first step. Things that neither of her biological parents had seen. If she was taken from him, at least he’d have those memories.
Castiel frowned. The price on his head was still there and Henriksen was no closer to finding out who the leak was. While he was putting together a sandwich for lunch, he racked his brains, but didn’t have a clue who could be selling information. He trusted the agency, but someone was out to get him.
“And this is why you are sitting behind the desk.” Dean grinned at the woman who was like a mother to him.
“21-19 County. We are taking the fawns to TWRC. We’re 10-7,” Dean said, using the code to tell the dispatcher they’d be out of service until further notice.
, I’m usually working.”
All too soon, Sunday afternoon arrived and Dean was packing his things. Castiel didn’t want him to leave. When would they see each other again? Would Dean get back to New York and decide a ready-made family was too much? They were both quiet while they waited for Dean’s car. Castiel had wanted to drive Dean to the airport, but they both decided it would be a major ordeal with Claire. “Car’s here,” Dean said, pulling Castiel against him. “I’ll call when I get home.”
“Dean’s not big on snakes,” Sam offered with a smirk in his brother’s direction.
Sam straightened up, his eyes wide. “Oh, my God, you think he’s hot.”
Ellen leaned forward and took Dean’s hands. “Ah, Sweetheart, you need to work for this one. It’s something you haven’t had to do in a long time. If he makes you happy, go for it.”
“The man of my dreams accepted my proposal, man. I wanted to splurge.”
Dean’s eyes never left the ceremony below them. Castiel watched him for a moment before shifting his gaze back to the Priestess as she bent to each candle in turn, blew it out, and finished the rite. With little fanfare, the horses and carriage exited the room.
Castiel was aware of a phone ringing and he heard the teenager’s hushed whisper behind him. “Daddy, I can’t talk right now. There’s a fight at the library. That Lilith woman is getting her ass handed to her by some guy.”
The kids seemed to be hitting it off and were talking about six-legged things and Dean was firing off a few texts to friends and family to let them know it was almost wheels up, when one of the girls exclaimed, “Oh, my God, there he is.” Dean glanced up to see three men approaching them. All in cargo shorts. Dean wondered which one was the infamous Professor Novak. He dismissed the younger one and focused on the two remaining men. One was burly and looked like he could take on Mike Tyson, the other was kind of hot in a
“Between the hours of seven and midnight,” Winchester responded, just as Mildred pushed the screen door open. She was balancing three plates on her arms. Castiel rose quickly to help, taking one of the plates.
“Glad you could join us, boys,” Becky said, coming over to hug them both. Her once blond hair was streaked with gray, but she kept her figure and was currently wearing a dark blue dress and matching pumps.
“No need. Good quality meat makes the difference.” Cas began to pull off hunks of the meat mixture and mold into large patties.
“The one about the butterflies?”
“What the hell, Castiel? Yesterday, you told Ruby that you thought you could...” Gabriel yelled and then bit off his words.
Castiel was rewarded with a grin minus two front teeth. He took a seat on the brick wall that made up the side of his enclosure and the boy jumped up next to him. He showed him how his tortoises would take the large pieces of kale directly from his hand. The boy was enraptured with his pets.
Dean kept reading. “Helping with inventory, and register.” Dean looked up questioningly.
Cas pulled himself to his full height and even though he was an inch or so shorter than Dean, at that moment, he seemed to tower over him. “Damn you.”
“Bug spray everyone,” Benny said, tossing out cans of repellent. Dean grinned in acknowledgement and sprayed himself down. Cas seemed to be busy with Audrey and Dimitri setting up a work station. Audrey was smiling and that, in itself, made Dean’s grin widen.
At Cas’ room, he knocked loudly. Then he put his hand over the peep hole. If Cas knew it was him, he probably wouldn’t open the freakin’ door. It opened. “Jesus, Cas, this is New York, you don’t fuckin’ open your door until you know who it is.” Cas blinked and shut the door. What. The. Fuck.
“Kind of,” he said truthfully. It was eleven o’clock on a Friday night. Cas better be home. He pounded again and heard Lola’s deep bark.
Downstairs, Castiel helped Dean with the finishing touches on dinner and was pleased by the jazz music Dean put on the stereo. They ate and Castiel realized this Dean, the Dean sitting across from him who talked with his mouth full, that laughed with abandonment… wasn’t the same Dean he’d first met. All cockiness was gone. When he talked about his brother, his coworkers, or his friends, his face softened and Castiel could see how much he loved them. What would it be like to know that handsome face softened at the mention of his name? Castiel would never know.  He was still torn between needing to walk away and wanting to fall into bed with Dean Winchester. Could he have a night of passion with the man, return to Atlanta, and then go on with his life like it never happened? There wasn’t a future in it.  Atlanta and Claire seemed so far away. He watched Dean drink his beer, his Adam’s apple moving up and down, the scruff along his jaw…
“I betrayed your trust and your friendship. I understand you have better things to do with your time than hanging around someone like me. I’ll only ever hurt you.”
But apparently Castiel was an amazing fucking tease, because when he looked back down the angel was concentrating on the tip of his left wing.
Castiel continued walking away.
“And now a piece of me will reside in you...” Castiel continued as he pressed a soft kiss to Dean’s chest.
He then swallowed Dean’s dick all the way until his nose was nestled in the thick, dark hair.
Castiel tensed up, the ache returning to his back, and his wings breaking loose from their ethereal plain. He stood there, his wings trembling as he lost control of them.
“Where is he?”
Castiel had lost control of his grace.
Dean, when are you going to get it through your thick skull?
Over the last few weeks,
“I’ll be back for you.”
Castiel said, stepping up behind Dean.
Dean felt like he was going to throw up as he watched Castiel turn away.
But the angel would wait too.
“Stay there and don’t do anything stupid.” Sam warned before going to find Cass.
teasing him, tempting him with warm touches and whispers.
Dean felt the vibrations when Castiel spoke. He could feel his angel, the energy buzzing just below the surface. Slowly, he slid the trench coat from Castiel’s shoulders. He stroked gently over Cass’ shoulder blades and smiled devilishly as a pleasured moan escaped the angel’s lips.
The angel’s thick cum filling him as he reached his own climax.
“Shhh...I’ve got you.” The angel whispered against Dean’s neck.
At first he did’t know what had triggered it, but then it became clear.
And yet I will never truly understand you...”
“We’ll be fine, Sam.”
Castiel had obviously interrupted him while he was listening to music.
They lay there in their bliss until Dean sighed contently.
Castiel held Dean firmly in place by his hips as he slipped inside him,
“I know how you feel about Eileen.
Dean swallowed thickly, trying to hold down a whimper before he spoke.
He tried not to let his emotions register. But it was hard to stop the sickly feeling from building in his stomach.
The angel would make Dean wait,
Dean paused at the torn trench coat that was still wrapped around Castiel’s shoulders.
causing Castiel’s erection to press
Suddenly, Sam turned back.
deciding to ignore the ache in his chest. He had a beer and Jack managed to convince him to play a round of connect four before he went to take a shower.
He couldn’t help but whimper as Castiel’s grace worked its way inside him, claiming him.
“Yessss...” The angel moaned.
But his half hearted struggling came to an end as Dean slid his hand under Castiel’s button down shirt, looking for that certain place he had read about.
He hated when Castiel teased him.
But he couldn’t leave.
He did not know what Dean wanted,
“I’m sure we will find a ways of occupying ourselves.”
He’d hoped he wouldn’t have to do this.
Castiel ceased his noises of delight when Dean buried his face in between his wings, the hunter’s hot breath creeping down his spine.
He would wait until Dean was most vulnerable before he took him.
“Dean...” Castiel said hesitantly.
Castiel knew Dean didn’t want him,
He chuckled before he stopped and put the bottle down when he saw Cass. Dean looked down at his shoes before looking back up at the angel with drunk pain in his eyes.
Sam began walking up the stairs, oblivious of what was happening in Dean’s trousers.
He froze, his pupils dilating as the tantalizing substance filled him with lust.
Dean took a step towards Cass, drawn in by the pheromones, and by the pain in his chest that wanted to reach back towards the warmth of Castiel’s touch.
But as he regained authority over his limps, he soon felt the warmth of Dean’s naked thighs slotted against his. He looked down, moving his legs slightly as he was greeted with the sight of Dean’s genitals pressed up against up his own.
“I wanted to say goodbye before I go.”
and nuzzling down his spine.
Dean secretly loved when Castiel did this to him. Taking him apart in front of everyone, so he couldn’t react.
But every now and then, Castiel felt Dean needed to be reminded who his ass belonged to.
But part of him liked that.
However it was effecting Dean,
Castiel knew Dean would be disgusted by the sight of his scarred and ugly wings. He was certain Dean would back away and leave. Which is why he was so surprised when Dean said quietly;
Castiel took a moment to think,
“That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
I wrongly assumed I belonged in your arms, in your bed. And I...
Dean took a moment to stare at Sam, dumbfounded and drunkenly trying to string words together in his head. “You don’t know what I did, Sam.” Dean said quietly.
“Will you let me groom your wings?”
into his crevice and began sucking on the hunter’s needy hole.
He admitted, lying spread out, naked on his bed.
This feeling he had come to know as arousal. And he had often wondered and feared what Dean would think of his desires,
Dean felt the energy buzz inside him, tendrils wrapped around his balls and rubbed, the vibrations plunging deeper until the grace bonded within him.
Dean was begging again, but Castiel had other plans.
Sam rolled his eyes.
“Cass...”Dean started before he was cut off by Castiel grabbing a bottle of liquor from the drinks table and filling two shot glasses between them. He put one in front of Dean before throwing back his own, Dean noticed how his shoulders looked especially stiff.
Dean barely noticed the absence of Cass’ dress pants until he felt the hard cock press into him.
In an instant, the coat was gone and he was greeted with Castiel’s bare back, glistening with oil.
And the worst part, he realized,
And that soon he would have no place in their home.
“Woah, I know the guilt and the drinking is kinda you’re style but Jeez.” Sam said, gesturing to the collection of bottles Dean sat in the middle of.
He knew his place in the hunters life, and he wasn’t going to let himself forget it.
Just remember, you don’t have to make excuses to have fun.”
Castiel stood up and placed a firm hand on Dean’s shoulder, stopping him.
“I hurt him, I took advantage of him and now...I’ve lost him.”
He placed a firm hand between Castiel’s shoulder blades and pressed.
Besides, someone has to stay and keep an eye on Jack while he heals up.” Dean said, gesturing to Jack who was eating cereal.
He marveled at how it puckered, how it begged for him to fill it.
Sam knocked on Castiel’s bedroom door and waited.
Okay, maybe I’m waiting.
“I don’t know what came over me, Cass. It was a terrible mistake.
His face met metal as he was bent over the hood of the car.
The door opened and Cass stepped out, looking a little awkward and uncomfortable, but then again that’s just how he is.
Being pressed to Castiel’s warmth as he was taken apart by gentle kisses, shrouded by Cass’ beautiful wings as they blocked out the light.
He was going to ignore the way he felt about Castiel being so close to his ear like that. “They don’t want anyone crashing the party. What the hell is this, a farm?.”
The Front Desk Lady tapped on her computer some more, “Alrighty! Here is the key and a bellhop will take your bags up momentarily. Enjoy your stay Mister and Mister Beretta.”
“Yeah, genius. Anyway, not only does this monster hate demons but they hate angels too. Enochian is on every out-of-the-way wooden surface you can think of. Cas’ power is on three percent, man.”
Liv’s eyebrow raises. “Angels bodysnatch humans?”
He slid up next to Castiel right as the angel stepped up to the front desk. He stretched an arm around Castiel. Dean was unprepared for the way Cas looked at him, with those blue eyes full of compassion, and ignored the way butterflies fluttered in his stomach. Cas was a good actor, way too good of an actor, this hunt was going to be the death of him.
Sam and Dean shared an exasperated look over Castiel's head. Trust the old man to start a slightly vulnerable moment and dispel it just as quick. It's not like Dean was entirely comfortable either, he didn't do chick flick moments. He preferred to keep his feelings out of the way where they wouldn't fuck up a job or get him too attached. In the corner of his eye, he saw the angel walk past him towards the door. He never wanted to get this attached.
Andrew definitely thought Liv was crazy.
The angel hums, “I am concealing my form currently.”
Cas’ face twisted into confusion, head tilting. “We already share a profound bond.”
okay yeah this is kinda short but the second chapter is almost done and longer so like just bear with this at the moment
“Okay, angel, go lay down.”
, they all reported having crazy, hyper-realistic dreams.”
“So what’s Brad Pitt doing in all this?”
“Yeah.”
Andrew gets it now. The whole begging for your life thing. But he also grew up in West Oakland. “Listen, man,” He stands to his full height- six foot five, since Andrew has a nasty habit of slouching- and enjoys watching the white guy look up. “We just want to know why there are angels and what the fuck ever else in Kansas of all places.” He’s confident, for some wild reason, and lays it on the guy. “I find out that my daughter saw an angel and its boyfriend at a Gas N Sip and she’s, understandably, freaking out. I take her to a new restaurant my brother recommends me and see that she wasn’t wrong and these things are just floating around bringing people burgers and fries. So, actually. Who sent you?”
Dean stepped into the hallway, there weren’t any other doors on the floor- presumably because of it being for suites. The walls were all cream white with oak logs running parallel on the top and bottom. An ornate white and gold runner ran along the dark hardwood. It was a small hallway with one set of elevator doors directly in front of their door and a service elevator at the end of the hallway. He looked up; a camera sat in the corner of the hall, angled at the main elevator’s entrance. He looked to the side- the service one didn’t have a camera. Dean approached the service elevator; two carvings sat mounted on either side of the elevator doors.
Dean looked at Sam, he wore a similar questioning expression- what could be so dangerous in forested Massachusetts? They nodded in tandem, surprised at the sudden shift in tone. "Yessir."
Carefully, oh so carefully, Dean pulled Cas in close, removing each arm from the sleeve but stopping when it seemed like he would wake up. It was tough pulling the garment out from behind him but Dean managed. Finally, the coat was secure in Dean’s hands. He grabbed the knitted throw blanket from the foot of the bed and draped it over the sleeping man. He paused only a little bit to admire how calm the angel looked, hair tousled and splayed against the contrasting white sheets.
“All couples.”
Dean needed to do some research on the creature before he got any more distracted. Starting with Dad's journal. He set up Sam's laptop, the journal, and a variety of different books of lore on the wide coffee table. He made himself comfortable on the floor, hunched over the literature. Dad didn’t have anything on alps, which made sense, they were only really found in Germany. The professor was right; alps were dream monsters. They were nocturnal and had only one weakness- lemons. But even then lemons didn't kill them, it just immobilized them for a bit. If they got enough lemons, they could probably knock the monster out for a while but that wasn't enough. Where would they find enough? Probably the kitchen, but they still couldn’t kill the thing. Dean bit his lip, he had to be missing something.
This was bullshit.
He swallowed his bite, pushing away the empty plate. “Huh. Interesting.” So that's the monster, perfect. Sam could say whatever he wanted, but Dean was one of the best hunters out there. He had cracked the code: schmooze enough people and the case falls in your lap, solved.
“So, the guy you’re in… is cool with it?”
And now they’re in a pub of some sort. It can’t be called a restaurant because it’s nowhere close to that sort of quality. No, this place is a step above a bar. There’s a boombox straight out of the eighties next to a record player, one of them is playing a Zeppelin song and Andrew cringes. What the hell is wrong with Tej? Everyone here is dressed head to toe in flannel and army pants, he can tell they’re armed too. He grew up in West Oakland before all the gentrification, he can see the signs. These signs are blaring red- dangerous- saying that maybe Andrew and Liv aren’t exactly welcome here. He does see a decent amount of non-white people and it eases his concerns somewhat. Liv walks over to a wooden booth and calls him over to sit, Andrew can feel the stares of the patrons and his skin crawls.
come out- but it was just too much. Too close to the truth that he was hiding from Castiel, too close to the fact that Dean did hide being bi because he didn’t know what would happen. Dad was this pillar in his life- he always talked about being a man who can take care of others- and Dean didn’t know what he would do if Dad found out and cut him off.
attractive, he had the whole superman thing going on. Dark hair, blue eyes, square jaw, solid chest; the epitome of a lady-killer.
She waved a hand, “I had a failed marriage because we weren’t truthful with each other. This lodge is to be a place for couples to restart that spark." She clenched her fists, a fervor igniting in her eyes. "This is a place for all your deceptions and lies and secrets to be aired out and like a phoenix, the relationship will come back bigger and brighter and
“No, like straight up dreams, but the kinds that stay with you for a while. See, people usually don’t remember their dreams because they wake slowly and it kinda gets lost to the wind. But
. It would never work. Point blank period. Dean shook himself out of his thoughts before he could truly spiral and made his way over to the bed. Cas was knocked
This was concerning. Was it drugs? Was Liv pregnant? Oh god, her mom had told her all about being a teen mom, he thought she understood. "What's going on, you're worrying me." He stared at her for a second, “You ain’t pregnant, right?”
Andrew ignores the ‘was’ in that sentence. “Okay, and why can’t we see the true form right now?”
“Leo may joke around, but what he is saying is true.” Mikhail finally spoke, a thick Russian accent rumbling out the sentence. “The elephant on that table,” He pointed a long finger at another figurine, “Japanese dream eater. The swan? Celtic goddess of dreams. It could be an omen.”
This was a dream, it had to be. Dean was free to do whatever he wanted, with no real repercussions. No ruined friendships or awkward silence or suffering. “Cas.” He hummed, running a hand over Dean’s tattoo. “Cas, look at me.” He looked up and Dean got an eyeful of those sapphires again, “I want you.” A weight seemed to dissolve itself off of his shoulders, his chest tightened.
- Dean deserved some rest. He settled on the couch and shut his eyes, he needed this.
He noticed Castiel floundered a bit, looking between the brothers and Bobby, not knowing what to say. He finally settled, "I will ensure their safety Bobby, it is my duty after all." Bobby rolled his eyes are the angel's formal tone, side eyeing him and the brothers.
"What have I told you about going into my closet?"
“I told you it was real.”
The group all shook their heads, matching looks of unknowing. All except one, Leo hummed in thought. "Yeah, you're talking about the carvings, right?" Dean nodded, putting a forkful of pie in his mouth. Leo sat back in his chair, sipping his drink, "It's a creature called the Alp, shapeshifting type, I think. It's said to cause nightmares by sitting on a person's chest. They gradually get more and more vivid before finally," He dragged a finger across his Adam's Apple, Dean found it hard to not grimace around the pie in his mouth. "...the weight becomes too much and the person suffocates to death. German folklore, real paranoid sons of bitches."
, go get your lover boy, Dean!”
Dean shook her hand, firm handshake, their rings sliding against each other as they pulled away. “How did you get into the business?”
Okay. Alright. Andrew doesn’t really know what to do now. These dudes don’t seem racist, just like they have poor fashion sense and a weird life. Considering the fact that this is all completely foreign, Andrew is just kind of accepting the information. Angels are real. He can see them. Liv can see them. Oh God, Olivia. He turns to her and she’s deep in thought. Andrew doesn’t really know what to do. There aren’t any parenting books that teach you about how to comfort your child after learning that angels are real.
“I guess a phantom taste is better than the real thing. Health wise,” he said as he let out a slight chuckle, shaking his head as his brother narrowed his eyes. “Come on Sam, if I can never joke about it then I might as well be dead already.” Sam let out a long sigh and Dean smiled, resting back into his seat and trying not to think about the sweat that was starting to layer on his skin.
“No,” he said, trying to control his now small chuckles. “No its not a problem.” He turned it so that the label was facing Castiel and he smirked. “Its just extra virgin.” Blue eyes skimmed down Dean’s broad shoulders and chest, landing on the label of the olive oil. Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Castiel’s lips curled into a grin and his head leaned back, exposing his neck. A laugh vibrated up from his lungs and pushed past his lips. It was loud and he grasped at his chest before it died off because Dean was back on top of him. Castiel moaned and his hands were grasping at Dean, mouth clamping shut.
“Meg I’m sorry,” he said and she tilted her head to the side. “I’m not, I-,” he huffed and finished off his drink. “I’m not interested in girls.” Meg’s eyes grew wide and her mouth cocked open. Castiel looked down and Dean filled his drink before disappearing again, as if knowing about the situation Castiel was in, and avoiding it.
“Wasn’t planning on it.”
“Of course I will,” she said with a giggle. They browsed books for a while longer before Castiel inevitabley checked out more books than necessary. Though, he was going away for the weekend.
“I didn’t stutter Dean, get out of my apartment,” Castiel said as he glared at Dean. With a huff and a slam of the door Dean had left Castiel alone in his apartment. Dean, as Castiel so pleasantly put it, is a terrible idea, but that didn’t mean that the Novak was going to stay away from him. He ran his through his hair and groaned. There was nothing he could do though, he didn’t want to fight with Dean so he just walked back to his room, grabbing his new book of his nightstand and sitting down.
“No we haven’t Cas, not really,” Dean said with a shake of his head. “We’ve talked about school and football, that’s not what we did before.”
He was instantly engrossed into it, happy that he didn’t have to be out in the heat like Gabriel, that he was allowed to sit and relax for his last free summer. Castiel wasn’t a kid, he was considered an adult since he could vote and drink, but he’d just graduated high school so he was still in that in between period. Gabriel and him had both decided that they didn’t want to live with the restrictions of their parents anymore so they found themselves in Kansas. Which is, and always will be a long way away from San Francisco. It was hotter here, which Castiel could never dream off. It was hotter and drier, and people tended to be more stand offish around him because he wasn’t from around Kansas at all. Castiel pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose again and that was when he was interrupted from his book, stopping in between a sentence that said
When he got outside though, he felt as if he was had. Castiel tugged on his Beatles shirt and looked around. “I have no fucking idea what an Impala looks like, let alone a ‘67 one,” he mumbled to himself as his eyes squinted. The time being late and the sun being set didn’t help with his search either. He crossed his arms over his chest and huffed. So much for actually getting something with the hottest piece of meat he had ever seen.
“Really?” He asked and Castiel nodded. “Even if I’m the town whore?” The Novak rolled his eyes and fixed his glasses.
“This fire is too hot,” Castiel grumbled as he tossed his can in it. The world around him was getting slightly dull, well, all of it except Dean, which Castiel found to be rather odd.
“Johnson is in the water sir,” Bartholomew said beside Castiel, letting out a huff as he checked his ammo bag of his M79. Lucifer held up his hand, looking over the rock they had all huddled behind. Castiel just pulled back the firing pin of his M16, making sure he was ready in case they needed to fire. The shooting had subsided, but he knew that it had to be long from over.
“Yes please,” he mumbled and Dean tugged down Castiel’s pants, hand slipping into his boxers and groping the man’s half hard member. Castiel moaned and moved his hands to fist them into Dean’s hair, hips rolling into the touch.
“He sleeps like a bear in hibernation,” Dean whispered and kissed the top of Castiel’s head. “Don’t worry he won’t hear us.” Castiel nodded as he zipped open his suitcase. Sam walked past the both of them with a book in his hand. “You’re going to read? We’re on vacation.” Sam looked over at his brother and rolled his eyes.
“Boring,” he commented as he tangled his fingers with hers. “Although Cas has Biology with me now.” He still couldn’t decide if that was a good thing or a bad thing.
It was several long and horrible moments before Castiel was taking in labored breath after labored breath. He wiped the sleeve of his shirt across his mouth, then down his chin in an attempt to dry his face completely. He stayed there, hunched over the porch, and panting. Not only did he feel like utter shit, he also had the added benefit of Dean Winchester apparently not giving up on him yet.
He stripped himself of his jacket, getting the feeling of the note out of his mind, and decided to break for lunch. Castiel was supposed to be meeting with Charlie today, because she promised him a surprise hang out once he was all settled into his dorm. Of course, he wasn’t really all that settled in, but he had everything unpacked, so there was that. He walked towards the student union. She promised him that she would at least find the student union for him. So he walked into the open area, which was somehow already bustling with students, even though classes started just a few days ago. Castiel folded his jacket over the top of his messenger bag, and sighed a little.
“I didn’t need to know that,” Sam trailed off as he walked into his small room, giving them the essence of privacy, even though they would be able to hear each other very easily. Dean pushed Castiel away slightly so that they could look at each other and smiled down at him.
“Okay,” he said and he scratched the back of his head. “My brother and I only got here a few days ago too.” He looked up at Castiel and smiled. “I’m Sam by the way.” Castiel returned the smile and he held out his hand. They shook and Castiel could already feel himself for making the interaction.
“No,” he whimpered and he moved himself back some, to push Dean to where he was. “I just need it slow, you’re uh.” His cheeks, that were so flushed he should looked like five playing cards, burned to an even new shade of red, almost like tomatoes. “You’re really big.” Castiel could practically feel Dean’s smirk from behind him and he inched a little more into Castiel.
“Its difficult Charles, I mean,” he sighed and shook his head. “I don’t know, things are always just weird with us.” Did Castiel know that. Dean and him had been messing around for practically the entire summer. It was ridiculous how much they had actually done together. They were fucking, but yet they couldn’t go on dates with other people. They claimed not to be in a relationship, but if Dean or Castiel saw the other with another person then they would have green eyes. That was how it was between them. They fucked and they loved each other’s company, but not enough to actually take the time to make it to a bed. “Also its the fourth of July Friday, and I don’t want things to be weird. We haven’t spent a holiday together yet. What if we just can’t stand the four days right next to each other? I don’t want to stop having sex with him yet.”
“Castiel,” he said and Sam smiled widely.
“I uh, I like having two different sources for my writing. I mean, sure, taping it is great, but at the same time I can put some things in my notes that the recording doesn’t get,” she said, which made Dean raise a brow. She knew that meant to continue with her explanation, so she showed him her note pad. Written across it in frantic writing was a few words. ‘Dean Winchester is close with his brother Sam.’ “The recording won’t say that to me when I go back in for review. It won’t tell me if you smile while you talk or if you’re actually answering with some sincerity. So the notes help as well.”
“Meg,” she said with a smile and she moved a little closer to Castiel as the singer started his opening. Castiel nodded and he wrapped his arms around her, bringing her closer. Dean’s eyes were still on him and he just wanted to turn and flick him off. Hell, he could kiss Meg, that would probably get his juice going. If Dean had freaked over Castiel hanging out with Charlie what would he think if he kissed Meg in front of him. They weren’t dating, Dean had made that clear.
“Oh I consider myself very lucky,” Castiel said and he leaned over the counter. “I get to get fucked by you.” Dean chuckled and Castiel finished off his drink. “I’ll see you in the car.” The Winchester modded and Castiel hopped off the bar stool, fixing his shirt before leaving the bar and getting into the Impala with ease.
“Okay, so what do you think I should do coach? Should I continue to throw? Maybe do a fake and run?” Dean asked as he looked towards Bobby. The older man shrugged his shoulders.
“Cause he’s not here, and I can’t just call him whenever I want to. It’s not like he has an actual number that he’ll always be around.” Charlie looked down, but she nodded.
“Bad idea?”
As they approached the laughs got louder, the talking become more audible and Ash noticed their arrival.
When the bodies stopped falling, Castiel let out a long breath, looking to Bartholomew as he inched towards the bushes. Everything seemed to quiet down around them. There was no gun fire, no shouting, and Castiel wasn’t too sure if he liked that. When things were this quiet it tended to go south pretty fast, and just as if the world knew about the silence, a loud shot through the trees, making both Castiel and Bartholomew flinch. He thought the shooting was over for the time being. Castiel didn’t take a moment to think, he just ran to it.
He couldn’t stop his brain. The entire weekend all he could think about was Castiel’s lips and he fucking hated thinking about them. They weren’t even what Dean were used to. The Winchester had been with so many girls over the years, all of their lips pink and full and soft; not thin, small, and chapped like Castiel’s. Dean could suppose that it wasn’t really that he found the lips attractive, rather that he liked what he felt when they were kissing. Pulsating vibrations every time their lips met, little sparks of electricity and strong waves of emotions. It was weird, definitely weird to kiss another man, but it was Castiel and for some reason Dean liked it. He was never interested in guys; never before did he ever think about even experimenting. Dean was always so sure of himself, so sure about every single thing he did and every action he pulled.
“I’m not sure if he’d be good out there. I mean yeah he can run, but this is the first game. I think he should do some more practice first.”
Suddenly, there was a nice Chevy Nova pulling up beside him, the window rolling down and red hair slipping out for some fresh air. Castiel felt the heat hit his skin and he smiled. “Why the hell aren’t you wearing a jacket?” She asked and shivered a little, rubbing her arms. “It’s freezing.” Castiel chuckled and walked over to Charlie, smiling at her.
“Just work me and I’ll feel better,” he murmured and then Dean started to move in and out of him slowly, a slick finger working into him and feeling absolutely amazing after a few thrusts. Castiel moaned softly and under his breath he whispered, “Add another.”
“You do?” He asked and her eyes just went wider. Castiel only tuned to look back at him. “Okay, then who is he?”
Dean pushed Michael off and away from him and suddenly there was another hand in his face. "Benny caught the ball," Castiel said as Dean looked up and took his wrist once again. Dean never really questioned how every single time he was tackled, Castiel was always there to help him up.
He moaned softly, feeling Dean move away, and Castiel let him, he let him because he knew what the other was going to do. “You’ll never guess what I brought,” he said with a warm smile. Dean shuffled on the bed, leaning off of it and digging around in his bag. Castiel huffed after a moment, but smiled brightly when he looked at Dean’s hand.
“Well Castiel Novak, have you ever seen this?” She asked and pulled away The Hobbit to show off her Star Wars shirt. Castiel smiled widely and nodded.
“Yes Dean, believe it or not there are actually people who are better looking than you,” Castiel lied with ease and the Winchester rolled his eyes.
‘Well, are the rumors true? Is the album about your hardships with alcoholism?” She asked, which made Dean take in a big breath. He never liked to admit what he was. He never wanted to say he was an alcoholic, but when you let yourself be in a drunken haze for nearly seven years what are you?
“Well that’s where its from. My parents are religious freaks and named every one of their kids after angels,” he said and he looked around uncomfortably. Maybe seeing Dean was only a night time thing. Maybe they should just stick with the shadows because he felt completely uncomfortable right now. Especially with the other man making fun of his name.
Sam’s smile turned a tad sad, but he still patted his brother’s back. “Of course,” he said, dimples penetrating his cheeks in a happier smile. “We’re family. Always will be.” Dean nodded and took a long drag of his cigarette, feeling the smoke fill his longs. He let out a long breath, seeing the smoke float from his mouth. Just as they were about to leave the concert hall, Dean was suddenly running into someone. He grunted a tad, and looked down at the woman, frowning. Judging by her press badge Dean wasn’t going to want to talk to her.
Castiel was about to say something but Green Eyes was already heading down to the other end of the bar. How hard was it to say a rum and coke? Apparently pretty fucking hard when you had the walking and talking image of sex staring at you with his too fucking perfect face. Castiel clenched his jaw and looked down. He needed to calm himself, he really did because if he didn’t he could vitally ruin his chance with Green Eyes. Of course, he could have absolutely no chance if the man was straight, but no man that beautiful should just be exclusive to girls. Castiel glanced down over the bar and holy shit, how long was he going to use that expression? Holy shit God had given Green Eyes the most beautifully shaped ass in all the world. Castiel thought he had one to be looked at, but no, fuck no did it compare to Green Eyes. The blue eyed man stared longer than should be appropriate and fixed his glasses, pushing them up the bridge of his nose with an intake of breath. “Fuck,” he muttered and then the man was turning back toward him.
“Have I ever told you that I’ve often contemplated if I like you more than my car?” Dean asked as he leaned over and pressed his lips to hers.
Castiel and Dean were crashing against each other the second they had securely shut the door behind them in the Novaks’ apartment. The blue eyed man moaned as his hands slipped under Dean’s shirt and his hips rolled against the others. “Fuck me,” he breathed against the skin of Dean’s neck for what seemed like the millionth time. “Please Dean.” Dean moaned as well and he grasped Castiel’s hips, turning him roughly and pressing him against the kitchen counter.
“I’m going on a walk,” he grumbled as he looked at the three of his friends and walked away from them, stealing Meg’s beer as he did so. He drank it and couldn’t help but like the warm fuzzy feeling it was generating as he walked away from the party, running into a few people as he did so. He wanted to make a dramatic exit, so that his friends could see how pissed he was but being slightly tipsy didn’t help since he just continued to trip until he actually made it to the massive treeline.
“What?” Tessa asked with a wide grin. Dean turned to look at Castiel and he instantly stepped in front of his woman.
“Okay, be out at the car in ten minutes,” Dean said as he left with a small smile, his bag digging into his shoulder slightly. He walked out of the locker room. The night air was somewhat cool and crisp and Dean was thankful for the slight relief from heat. He could hear slight thunder in the distance and for some reason he smiled widely because he always enjoyed the feeling of rain drops speckling his hair and clothes. He looked up into the sky and ran his fingers through his hair and that was when Tessa ran up to him and wrapped her arms around his neck.
“Hey Charlie,” he said as Charlie walked in and he rubbed at his eyes. “What happening?” Charlie smiled and she sat down on his bed.
“Well then I’m added to the list because he actually fucked me today.” Charlie’s eyes grew wide and she let out another loud laugh.
“Lube,” he breathed and he arched his back into Dean’s touches. “We need lube.” He panted slightly because his body was aching for more touches, and his heart was racing at its maximum speed. Dean nodded and he moved away from Castiel slightly, probably to take himself out of his jeans. The blue eyed man bit his bottom lip and he grabbed the olive oil. He’d read in a book somewhere that the Greeks used it for lubricant in Ancient Greece.  He pulled it out and a loud chuckle presented itself from behind Castiel. “What’s so funny?” He turned around to look at Dean and looked down at the other man’s cock, wanting so badly to just press against him, but he also wanted to get fucked more.
Green Eyes’ mouth felt so fucking good and amazing wrapped around Castiel that if he hadn’t been holding back with every inch of his being he would have came the second he felt it. He rolled his hips again and then felt the other man start bobbing his head up and down. Castiel moaned again and his hold on the other’s hair only tightened. He tugged and pulled and his head lolled back. His mouth opened and he moaned again before whimpering because he had lost the touch. Castiel’s eyes finally opened and he looked down at Green Eyes. “Why,” fuck he was so breathless, “why did you stop?” He asked and he felt the other’s lips only moments later. The blue eyed man moved his hands from Green Eyes’ hair to wrap around his neck and felt the calloused hands of him pull down Castiel’s pants even more, till they were just discarded clothing on the bottom of his car. Castiel lunged forward, lips still connected with the other man’s as he straddled his legs on either side of the him. He was so hungry, so hungry for more touching. Castiel had never been like this before, never been so wrapped up in another man. Green Eyes’ broke the kiss for a second, or maybe more, but Castiel couldn’t even comprehend time, and pressed his forehead to Castiel’s. He looked down at his jeans and a second later Castiel felt the other man’s cock against his own.
“Castiel!” He heard Charlie call from behind him and he turned around with a smile. “Where the fuck did you go?”
“Who the fuck is Charlie?” He asked and Castiel looked over at him. Was Dean upset at the fact that Castiel told someone about them. “Who is he?” Castiel’s eyes grew wide as it clicked into his head. He lolled his head back and let out a loud laugh. Dean, he was obviously thinking that Charlie could be someone to Castiel. So Dean was obviously jealous.
“Sure she did. Just like I purposefully trip when I’m drunk.”
“She is,” Tessa said as she ran her fingers across the dash.
“Fuck Dean,” he murmured and he felt his face flush, a layer of sweat already prickling his skin. Dean’s hand had found it’s way to Castiel’s cock and he stroked down on it roughly, causing the other man to arch his back and screw his eyes shut from the absolute pleasure. “Oh fuck.” He trembled and one of his hands moved up to one of the cabinets. He didn’t want to fool around anymore, he wanted to get to it. Dean stroked him again and Castiel sucked his lip into his mouth.Castiel opened the cabinet and he moved back to press against Dean more.
“So what was that book you were reading about?” She asked and Castiel looked at her, fixing his glasses.
“No,” he said and then he shook his head. “I mean, yes I want you to go. I really do.” He slid the glass down the bar and placed his hand on the glossed wood. “But are you sure? This is four days of just you, me, and my brother.” Castiel clenched his jaw and he nodded.
“When’s he leaving for it?” Charlie asked and Castiel shrugged his shoulders.
“Jesus,” Castiel whispered somehow in between breaths and kisses. “Bedroom.” He was positive that he had said that. Or at least positive enough that he had attempted to. It was just so difficult to get anything out when all his brain could think about was how good Dean felt against him. They were practically melting into each other at this point. Castiel could feel the edge of his counter digging into his back from being pressed into it so hard, but the things that Dean could do with his tongue made him numb to the pain. That was so dangerous.
“I wish my parents would have even let me have the Hobbit in the house,” he said as he looked at his drink. “I mean I’ve read them several times, but I had to keep them from my parents. They saw magic or aliens as the work of the devil and banished me from it.” Which was true, Castiel had learned to resent his parents because he had loved everything they didn’t. He sipped at his drink and Charlie stood up.
Castiel and Charlie arrived at the library when it was about full swing. People were coming in and out of it and Castiel was actually surprised by how many there were. He always thought that the town was small and barely had any people in it, but that wasn’t the case now that he saw people actually in one place. He smiled at Charlie when they walked in and she grasped his hand to tug him over to a section of books.
“I don’t know if I could go days without feeling it,” he murmured and he leaned up to smash their lips together, a hand moving to slip behind Dean’s head and play with the small hairs on the back of his neck. Castiel was pushed away from Dean seconds later and he opened his eyes to see the man shaking his head. “What?”
“Grilled cheese,” he said as he reached over to Castiel and handed him a pie iron. Castiel nodded and he looked over at Dean, bumping his shoulder. “If I can ever figure out this fire it will be grilled cheese.” Dean chuckled and he reached down from his chair to grab at the bread and the cheese.
“I’m ready for my date. I was just passing the time. So once I put a load in we can go to wherever you’re taking me.” Balthazar nodded and they headed out, Castiel’s clothes in tow.
“What do you want Cas?” Dean asked, his voice a purr and right next to Castiel’s ear. “Want to be fucked? Right here in the back of my car?” God, Castiel really didn’t, but Dean never waited until they got to either of their houses. He nodded though, and pulled the Winchester closer.
“No, I think you should make up with Cas,” she said with a slight nod of approval. “I may not know that much about football, but I do know that if all of the members of the team aren’t all on the same page or getting along then they won’t win.”
“That,” he could feel his face heating up as he stood up and brushed the dirt off of his pants, his erection deflating itself because they had stopped.
“Shut up and touch me,” he breathed and Green Eyes looked at him with a malicious grin. Castiel shivered again and his hands moved to tangle in the other’s short sandy hair when he pulled at Castiel’s jeans.
After a very long and quiet moment, sans their mutual panting, Dean finally lifted himself up from between Castiel’s legs and rolled over just enough to lay beside him. It took another handful of minutes before the reality of what they had just done settled in Castiel’s gut.
Dean and Castiel, along with the rest of the team crowded about in a giant circle, yelling and cheering. If they could start off with a win against the worst Catholic school, then they were sure to get more. He was pushed about in the circle and that was when Ash’s voice bellowed, quieting the rest of the team.
“It’s the second week of school, shouldn’t you be paying attention in class?”
“You look strange without your glasses,” he said and Castiel grumbled as he reached forward again, but only got a handful of Dean’s shirt.
“Oh well I was just about to head out with Gilda,” she said and Castiel nodded. “I’ll see you tomorrow at the library?” Castiel nodded again and just before Charlie started to walk away he stopped her.
“He’ll stay a mystery until I get his name,” Castiel said and Charlie pouted. “I’m sorry, but he’ll be Green Eyes with the great ass and everything else until I get his name. Then he’ll be insert name here with the great ass and everything else. You can’t meet him because you might know him and tell me he’s a bad idea.”
Castiel rubbed at his eyes a little before folding the shirt up. There was no way he was going to wash that shirt, not when it smelt like the man that he left behind. He slipped it under his mattress, where it would no doubt lose its scent eventually. That was when he would clean it, but not right now. There was knock at his door and Castiel looked towards his alarm clock. That was odd, he wasn’t expecting company till around six. It was only four thirty. So he stood up, swept his hands across his pants, and walked over to the door. The blue eyes of Castiel grew wide as he saw who it was. “Balthazar?” He said with a raised brow. The two had become acquainted over the past few times Castiel had gone to the coffee shop, and he wasn’t expecting Balthazar to pick him up for their date till it was six.
“Probably, Meg wants to see everybody getting drunk,” Castiel said with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “I mean, I don’t really know if I’m necessarily a party person, but she’s being insistent.”
Castiel wiped his face and he looked up at Dean. “How was that?” He asked in a broken voice. Dean smiled down at him and nodded.
Dean stroked down on Castiel’s cock and it caused a ripple effect through Castiel, making him shake with need. He moaned and Dean started to bob his head. He tugged on Dean’s hair and bit the inside of his mouth. “Dean,” he breathed and it took every ounce of his willpower not to buck his hips up into Dean’s mouth. “Dammit.” He groaned and tugged more, causing the man to moan around his cock. “I’m supposed to be mad at you.” Castiel shuddered and he moaned again.
“I pay attention,” Dean retorted and Kevin laughed.
“I don’t mind at all,” he said and Castiel smirked, moving to grab his keys and his wallet.
“Why wouldn’t I be? I mean you’re Dean’s boyfriend.” Castiel blushed deeply and he watched as Dean’s cheeks flushed.
He watched as Dean cracked into that same smile that gritted his own teeth. This was why he was here though. It was the whole reason he came. Castiel had an itch to scratch, and if the guy next to him was the one lighting his fire tonight, then so be it. He could go back to hating Dean afterward, or at least go back to attempting to hate him. “God I wish you’d stop smiling like that.”
“It’s fine I understand,” he said, grabbing a basket full of clothes. “I was just sorting my laundry. Mind accompanying me to the laundry mat?” Castiel looked at Balthazar and the other smirked.
When the moment came, Castiel had never felt anything like it before. It flowed out naturally, and along with his lover. He smiled as their breaths collided, Dean’s lips smashing against his, hands tangling softly in his hair. They broke for air a second later, Castiel panting softly and moving his hands up and down Dean’s side.
The Winchester shook his head and then he ran into Tran. “Kevin.” The small running back looked up at Dean and cocked a brow.
He knew how hard he was, and had no indecision that Dean could feel it. He took in a large breath when he felt cold hands slipping down into his boxers, and practically thrusted into them despite the temperature.
“And what if I am?” He asked and Dean chuckled. They both walked into the camper, Castiel tried to pay no attention to it as it rocked a little from the new weight. The Novak sat his bag down on the countertop of the kitchen and looked around the small establishment. “Smaller than I thought.” But homey at the same time. Castiel liked how it was a sixties camper. Small, mosaic tiles on the floor. There was a curtain that separated the actual bed from the rest of the camper. Castiel looked over at Dean. “I thought you said that there was a room for Sam?” Curtains could easily be drawn back, Sam could accidentally see them, and that made the brown haired man tense.
“You’re at it again aren’t you?” Dean asked and Castiel snapped out of it, looking over at the other boy.
“Yes.”
In all the years that Castiel had been alive, he never thought for one second that he could be so swept up by someone. He’d always seen himself as a man who just wanted a little fun for one night and then it’d all be over. He didn’t expect himself to go to the Roadhouse, which he figured out the name of after asking Charlie, and see Green Eyes over the next few days. He never expected to have sex in a bathroom, sure he’d fantasized about it, but never thought it would happen.
“Well, its very nice to know that he’s switched on to men,” she said with a cross of her arms over her chest.
“Whatever Sammy,” he mumbled and scooted his chair to be a little closer to the other man. Castiel shifted to stand up and he slipped his hand from the other’s.
“Are you?” He asked and Castiel nodded himself. Dean smiled and then walked out with the other, pressing against his shoulder every so often. This weekend was going to great, Castiel could feel it. “How did you sleep?” Castiel looked over at Dean and he adjusted his glasses somewhat.
, and you can't even wait for the cum to cool on your stomach before kicking me out?" Castiel tried not to cringe from the question. He just pressed his palms harder against his eyes.
“I hope I never met your parents. They sound brutal,” Dean chuckled as he shook his head slightly.
A moan rolled past his lips just then, bubbling up from his lungs and pushing up into his dry mouth, making the quiet room fill with noise for only a second. Castiel’s back arched off the bed that was underneath him and his nails dug into the scalp of the other man. “Fuck,” he breathed and he could feel a smile against his skin, making it tingle and vibrate with arousal.
“What? Mullets don’t appeal to you?” She asked and Castiel stuck his tongue out with a small gag.
“Excuse me?” He asked and Castiel shook his head.
“Maybe he will.”
“Game Dean, paying attention,” Castiel hissed and that shut Dean up. He nodded and slipped his mouth guard across his teeth. He licked his tongue across the guard and thought of his next play. His fingers wiggled anxiously and he ran the play through his head.
Go by fast it did. Castiel was slipping from the car and he was stretching his back after a long and very quiet drive. Dean and him barely talked, and he hadn’t the slightest clue why. Every so often while he would be looking out the window he would hear Sam and Dean talking, about small things like the time for lake hours.
When school was over and they were finally out on the practice field Dean was very grateful because Castiel was acting normal. They were throwing passes and practicing runs and Castiel was always on the top of his game. They didn’t talk though, unless they were discussing plays and players. For some reason they were flowing when it came down to the hike of the ball, but when they were just standing there, neither of them saying anything about football they were quiet.
“I know,” Dean said quickly, holding up his hand. “I know, and I’m sorry. I was an idiot. Okay? You do mean something to me Cas. You uh,” Dean trailed off and rubbed the back of his neck. “You mean a lot to me actually.” Castiel watched Dean, watched how his cheeks flushed a little, how he scooted a little closer. He seemed so different. He didn’t look like the strong and confident Dean that Castiel knew. The godly man looked delicate, and fragile. Castiel smiled a little, reaching out and tangling his fingers with Dean.
When he finally met up with Castiel he had moved to bump shoulders with the guy, making him struggle on his legs. “Hey,” Castiel grumbled as he looked over at Dean and pushed at him weakly. “I’m walking here.” Dean barked a laugh and stumbled along with Castiel.
“You’re so whiny when you can’t see.” Dean chuckled again before finally placing the glasses in Castiel’s hand. Castiel rolled his eyes and slipped his glasses back on.
See, Castiel knew that Dean was attractive. A person would have to be blind not to find the man’s bright green eyes or strong jaw appealing. It was annoying because anytime he got a look at the other he felt this twist in his stomach. Unbearable, truly. As Dean stepped up closer to Castiel, closing the distance between them, he found more things to appreciate. His freckles, or his nose, or the way his lips moved as he spoke.
Lube. For once in their actual sexual life Dean had lube. “Oh you shouldn’t have,” Castiel teased and pulled Dean close to him, making the Winchester boy drop the bottle. ‘But thank God. I was tired of using spit.” Dean chuckled and picked up the bottle as Castiel moved to kiss at his neck, at his collarbone, his jaw, his ears, anything he could reach.
“There is,” she said and she giggled at Castiel confused expression. She wrapped her hand around his and tugged him back behind the house that had all of its lights turned off. “Its behind the house, stop freaking out.” Castiel scoffed, he was not freaking out; he was just questioning why there didn’t seem to be anybody at this so called party. Charlie pulled him around the corner of the farmhouse and he instantly knew why everything looked so dead. It was exactly as she had said, it was behind the house.
“Castiel!” Charlie snapped, causing Castiel to push himself out of his flashback state. “Did you hear anything I just said?”
“What the fuck is going on here?” He asked as he looked up at Michael and clenched his jaw. Castiel pushed past Dean and Michael only inched forward. The refs were back on them again and two of them held Michael back.
“I mean, I just didn’t think that the Machinesmith was behind it.”
“That’s because I don’t really go to these,” Castiel grumbled, hoping simultaneously that Dean would both leave, and stay. This wasn’t good, but it could be. No. Dean was probably as straight as an arrow. He was only talking to Castiel now because he wanted to start something. Maybe rag on him. No doubt he would flit off at some point once he found someone more interesting.
“Honestly Charlie, we never discussed last names, we just figured out first ones,” he said as he sat down beside her, handing her a bottle of Coke. “Does Dean Winchester have a younger brother name Sam?” That got Charlie upset, she leaned over to Castiel and her hand was in a tight fist as it came across his arm.
“So back to my freckles,” he whispered and Castiel rolled his eyes, pressing a soft kiss over one of his tattoos. He never talked about it before, but Dean had several tattoos. There was a pentagram surrounded by a sun on his chest. Wrapping letters along the curve of his hip, ‘Hey Jude’, which Dean once explained was for his mother who he didn’t have any more in his life. There was a snake wrapping around his ankle, but that was all Castiel had seen, they were all so simple in the sense, but at the same time they were extremely important to Dean.
"Take it," he stated as he looked up at Dean. 'Take it I don't like it." Dean chuckled and shook his head.
“We talked about your wrist.” Dean hissed as he quickly changed his face to one filled with anger, if Castiel wanted to get pissy Dean would too.
“Of course you’re big time city,” he said and Castiel only then caught the slight accent. He pushed his glasses up his nose again and reset them on his face.
“That’s odd,” she said and Castiel nodded.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled and leaned over to nip at the other’s neck, continuing his movements with his hand. “You’re wearing those tight pants again, all I can think about is your wonderful ass.” Dean chuckled and shifted to wrap arms around Castiel’s waist, bringing him closer.
“Its perfect,” he said and smiled up at Dean. “Absolutely perfect. Although,” he slightly jumped and moved the camper around, feeling it shake underneath him. “I think we’re going to have to go a lot slower tonight. Don’t want to break the camper.” Castiel chuckled and Dean smirked.
A small noise escaped his lips as he tried to get a handle on himself. Castiel felt like absolute gelatin while he panted. “How,” he muttered as he slowly opened his eyes, seeing Dean looking at him lustfully. There wasn’t a doubt in his mind that his own eyes matched. He took in a shaky breath as he tried to string a coherent sentence together. “How do you-”
“There’s no such thing as magic, all magic is just science,” Castiel argued and Dean chuckled.
“What the fuck was that?” He asked and Castiel only shook his head, placing his hands on his hips and walking away from Dean. The quarterback followed behind him and they started to go back into their formations. “Cas, are you going to tell me what that was?” He crouched down into his stance and he could feel the anger emanating off of Castiel.
“Well I’d like a plain black coffee if that’s okay,” he said and finished off with a, “Thanks Balthazar.”
“Why won’t it matter in a few weeks?” He asked again, with more strength behind it and Castiel give up pretending that he couldn’t hear Dean.
“Bullshit,” he stated as he crossed his arms over his chest. “You keep saying that you want to but you still haven’t.” He walked over to the paper towel dispenser and took a few towels before unbuttoning his pants and dropping them down some. Castiel wiped the come off from earlier and looked at Dean. “Will you fuck me? Because Charlie says you’re not that gay and you won’t.” Dean’s head snapped over to Castiel and he clenched his jaw.
“Fuck you because he’s a weak spot right now,” he said with a chuckle. “But no, I wouldn’t fuck Dean if he had a mullet.” Charlie looked over at Castiel.
“The party isn’t necessarily here,” Dean retorted as he looked between the two of them and it clicked in his brain that neither of them had been to a party at Ash’s. He smirked again because he knew that they were going to be in for a treat. He looked back out the window, turned to give Tessa a knowing look then got out of the car. She smiled and looked at the couple before removing herself as well. Dean closed the door and was happy for the slight drizzle that had happened while he was driving, he watched as Castiel got out of the car and stretched his muscles. Dean chuckled slightly when he heard the small squeak emanate from Castiel’s mouth. “You’re a fucking dweeb.” The other boy looked at him and cocked an eyebrow.
“What the hell are you doing here?” He heard a familiar voice hiss as someone grabbed his shoulder and made him turn around. He glared up at Dean and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
“Yeah, see you after class.” They both parted ways, Tessa going to her Physics class and Dean walking back toward his Algebra class.
The quarterback bought the ball close to him and started to push himself through the wall of people. He nudged himself through and grunt as he felt an elbow shove into his side. Dean broke through the barricade and got control of his footing. He could hear the fans cheer and he couldn’t help the smirk that pulled on his face as he ran a few yards. Something had crashed into him though, knocking Dean to the ground with a loud groan. The whistles blew and he could help but squint his eyes as he looked up at the spot lights. He let out a sigh and suddenly there was a hand in his vision. He’d know the hand anywhere, it was always accompanied by the number forty-two. He gripped the center’s wrist and was pulled to his feet, a hand going to pat his back.
“Charlie is just a friend,” Castiel said and Dean stepped closer to him.
“Sorry,” Castiel said as he shook his head. “I’m sorry. Got lost in my thoughts for a moment.” He looked down at Sam and then started to look through some of the books. “Have you read The Hobbit?” He looked over at Sam and watched as the kid shook his head. “That’s a good book, I mean Tolkien can be hard to read, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t good.” He smiled and then pulled a copy of it from the middle of a stack of books.
“Castiel?” A familiar voice rang through his fantasy and he jumped, springing forward in his seat as the entire flashback diminished.
“We got about another hour,” Sam called, obviously engrossed in his book by his tone. Dean nodded, even though his brother couldn’t see him, and he started up again. It was a song, an actual good and emotional song. It was a song with meaning and life, and Dean actually wrote it. He continued to play and write, anxiously waiting for them to arrive at the stadium. Maybe this was the song he was missing. Maybe this was the one piece in his new album that he needed. Dean played his noted, and he sang a little on the bus, smiling. He poked his head out of his room and looked to Sam.
“Oh have you?” Castiel nodded and watched as Charlie brought up a hand to her chin, her eyes looking off to the left as she searched her memory for another movie. Castiel laughed again and she reached across with her free hand, placing her pointer finger on his lips. “Sush my comrade, I am thinking.” Castiel rolled his eyes and then she smirked again. “Westworld?”
“What did he do? You’ve been wanting him to fuck you since you met him,” she said and Castiel sighed. “Was he bad at it?”
Castiel slipped past Dean, and made his way to the kitchen quickly. He didn’t bother with the lights, and ignored the red blinking light of his answering machine that scarcely lit up the room every other second.  When he got into his kitchen though, he did flick on the little light above the sink. There on a shelf above it was mint mouthwash. Castiel grabbed for it, twisted the cap off, and drank a little straight from the bottle. The cool burn of the liquid definitely brought some life into him, and after swishing it around a couple seconds he was spitting it out. He wiped his mouth, turned around, and there Dean was, waiting patiently by the doorframe into the kitchen.
A lot of flash backs. I hope that makes sense. Haha.
“Oh whatever. Have you talked to Dean?” Castiel felt like he was about to throw up. He felt like he was about to just leave every piece of him.
He pouted, but nodded as well.
“When people come into the woods Cas they usually try to get it on,” Dean said as he stopped too and looked down at Castiel. “You know, try to have sex.”
“Sorry Bobby,” he said, and the coach shook his head.
After a few awkward thrusts they finally seemed to find their rhythm. Castiel would roll his hips down while Dean would thrust up. It was hard, deep, and exactly what he needed. It also certainly helped Castiel’s experience when Dean wrapped a hand around his cock, pumping in time with his thrusts up into him.
“Well, first off,” she started, clearing her throat and setting the tape deck on the table. “What made you come back?” Dean clenched his jaw. What did make him come back? He’s been battling the bottle for over four years now, and just as he gets a handle on his life he’s back to the stage. The place that lead him to the bottle in the first place.
“So his blames his manager for the root of all of his problems,” Castiel said, after listening to Beth for what felt like forever. Even though in actuality it was probably more like five minutes. She nodded, but sighed.
“Fine I didn’t but can you blame me when I have that hot chick Cassie in my class?” That was a blatant lie, Dean didn’t have Cassie in his class, and also he wasn’t single so there was no reason for him to look anyway.
“Enjoy your book young sir,” the librarian said somewhat bitterly as she slid it across the desk and over to Castiel. He smiled at her and then went off to the right so he could find a chair to call his home for the next few hours. He found a chair in a sort of circle of chairs, a coffee table sitting in the middle. He smiled and sat down, not even bothering to pay attention to the other people around him. Castiel opened his book and started to read.
“Yeah, ever since I dropped Alistair I’ve been writing my stuff, what I wanted to sing,” Dean said, feeling a little proud in the album that he created. Ever since Sam had taken over Dean had been able to do as he please. As long as it didn’t involve Jack, Jim, or Jose. “So what I’ll be singing on stage tonight will be available in the record stores tomorrow.” Charlie smiled and she looked down, flipping through her pages again.
"So why haven't you gone to the doctor's?" He asked as he cocked an eyebrow and took another drink.
“The tips,” he said and Castiel laughed a little harder. “I’m dead serious, these pants are magical.”
“Enjoying the view?” Dean asked, reaching out and grabbing for Castiel’s hip. He let himself be pulled forward, and experienced a pulse of pleasure from feeling their cocks slide together.
“I don’t know
“No kissing,” he mumbled as he grasped Castiel’s arms and brought them down to just rest on his chest. “Not unless we’re fucking.” Castiel furrowed his brow and he moved his hands to grasp at Dean’s and pull them away from him in general. He pursed his lips and crossed his arms over his chest.
Castiel smirked and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. He licked his lips and watched Green Eyes return the gesture. “See you around.” He climbed out of the car reluctantly and watched as the other man drove off, leaving a trail of exhaust in his wake. Castiel bit his lip then trudged up the stairs to their apartment, not at all surprised that Gabriel was still awake.
“I swear to god Dean, you’re a fucking idiot!” He shook his head and Dean just grabbed his arm, pulling him off into the woods. “Where the hell are you taking mph!-” He was cut off when Dean’s lips crushed against his own. All of Castiel’s anger seemed to dissipate and he quickly shoved himself against Dean.
“Because they’re drunk and horny,” Dean said simply. “I mean I’ve gotten frisky in these woods before.” Castiel groaned and pushed at Dean as he started to walk away again.
“What are you doing?” He asked in a whisper as he bit down on Castiel’s neck.
“They haven’t? I didn’t notice,” Castiel chuckled and Green Eyes leaned away from him. He watched as the other man looked around the bar and then had his eyes land back on Castiel’s. He leaned down to him again and Castiel felt himself swoon when he felt the warm breath against his lips.
“Ash!” Dean growled as he back away from the touch. “God dammit, you know this shit gets everywhere and I can’t have it get in my eyes.” Ash just laughed.
Bobby held up a hand, stopping the trio from exiting the room. The three of them glanced at each other. Cas hadn’t even known Bobby for very long, but he still respected the wise air of the other man. Bobby screwed his face up, scratching at the scruff on his cheek. “This case is fishy, kids. Be careful, call me if you need anything and I will be there.” He sighed, deep and heavy. "I've lost two hunters in that area already. I'm only trusting you because there's three of you, don't let me down and make me drag you idjits out."
“He was, yes.”
Castiel wasn’t even awake when Dean made it back to the room. He was curled up on the bed, shoes still on and trenchcoat crumpled, and Dean felt a pang in his chest. This stupid angel was going to be the death of him. It melted him from the inside out- this idiotic love he felt for him. There was no way they could realistically be together. Dean hunted monsters and Castiel was an angel of the
Liv swatted his arm, “No I’m not pregnant! When could I have even had sex with a man?” Andrew considered that for a moment, touche. "I think I can see angels."
“That’s probably our best bet, thanks Bobby.” Dean hung up, he had his work cut out for him. He was definitely going to do it tomorrow, though. That pie was amazing, he drove for almost two days, and it was
, man. Yawning, stretching, droopy eyes, the whole nine yards.”
Ximena shook her head, “Look Leo! You’re scaring the poor guy off, now who am I going to complain about you too?” Leo just waved away the words and wrapped an arm around Mikhail. They bid Dean their goodbyes as he gathered his things and left for his room. This place was really suspicious, something told Dean there was more than just an obscure German monster here.
“Dude, I’m not sharing a bed with you.”
Dean gritted out a smile, he did
Oh. Okay. That’s better and worse at the same time somehow. "Alright, maybe you should take a nap. Or get some food in you. A place opened up down the road that your Uncle Tej eats at all the time. He swears up and down the burgers are to die for." Liv glares at him and Andrew can only rub her back awkwardly. It's odd, definitely. Liv has never been a religious person, she's actively distrusted organized religion for years now. Andrew isn't going to lie, though. He has some bias- he went to a private Catholic school- but Andrew has never considered himself especially religious. The ones who claimed to talk to God or angels always freaked him out. He still remembers the weird rash of murders in '07 by down-on-their-luck-people who had ‘spoken with an angel’. It was no good. So Liv? The heathen- in her grandmother’s words- was seeing angels? Something was up.
The front desk lady smiled at them- all customer service, nothing real- and held out her hand for a credit card. Dean passed the card over and she typed into her computer. “Do you have a reservation with us?”
." He just needed a nice slice of pie, something nice to take the edge off of today's events. Heather handed him the plate- an obviously expensive porcelain piece, complete with ornate gold designs stretching around the border- and informed him that food expenses were covered by the hotel package they bought. He didn’t even want to think about how expensive the package was, Dean had blocked it out as soon as he signed the name.
Dean furrowed his brows deep in thought. “I’m gonna head up to my room, make sure dream eaters don’t get my husband.” The group chuckled around him.
Bobby tossed a newspaper onto Dean’s lap, ignoring the fact that Dean was holding piping hot coffee. Castiel picked it up and Dean ignored the tingling feeling at the brief contact. “I’ve got a case for you out east in Great Barrington. Six people dead at a couples’ resort in the last three months. Suffocation.”
Nicole leaned in, Dean could smell the nosiness like it was rotten fish. “What about your lover?” She enunciated the ‘l’, eyes glinting with interest.
Okay, that was a lie. The place was nice enough, the resort looked like a luxurious lodge and had the heat to go with it. Dean had never been a fan of wintertime so he
Cas straightened and walked forward, shortening the distance between them. Dean wanted to back away, but he stood his ground. He wasn’t the one that ran away.
Stepping inside Winchester's was exciting. Floor to ceiling custom wine racks covered the wall to his left, to his right was a seating area with a fireplace. The hostess station was teak with a marble top. The place oozed class. “Can I help you?” The pretty blonde was dressed in a red tuxedo shirt, bow tie and black slacks.
“I... things were...”
“Dean…please…” Castiel gripped the short strands of Dean’s hair and tried to pull him off his gloriously sore nipples.
that they’ll be calling tomorrow to deal.”
. He was still in his diving booties, but had stripped off his wetsuit, leaving him in swim shorts. The towel around his shoulders wasn’t covering much. “Cas.”
“Just take me to my hotel. Please.” Cas wasn’t even looking at him. Fuck.
“I can’t turn back the clock. I left you without saying goodbye and I regret that, but at the time, I thought it would be less painful for me.”
Jo sighed and said, “What did you do now?”
“I’m glad to be here. We missed you.” Dean was going to say it. He had to.
“You may leave. Mr. Winchester will be seated with me.” The traitor left him alone with Cas. Dean wasn’t quite ready to think about his feelings for the vampire. “Shall we take our seats?”
A deep growl came from under a mound of pillows. “Times’ it?”
“Hello, Dean. Why are you here?” Cas hefted his carry-on to his other hand and tilted his head to the left, waiting for Dean to answer him.
A bright blue Honda CR-V pulled to a stop in front of them. Meg smiled at them. Since another person was in the passenger seat, Charlie and Dean piled into the back. “Guys, this is Max. He’s going to be our photographer today.”
“Ever the Boy Scout.”
He was out of breath from jumping over the steamer trunk that was on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary. He skidded to a shop and whipped the curtains to the side. The store room was empty. He even peeked under his work table. No witch. The antique tea urn was gone, as were the tray, the creamer, and the sugar bowl. He sat down heavily in his chair. It must have been a dream.
“Morning,” Dean said, his eyes forward. He looked like he didn’t want to talk, so Castiel could work with that. He’d miss the Dean he’d come to know, but he did have a job to do. He settled the bag of snacks on the floorboard between his feet and buckled up. “Where to today?”
“Castiel, good to see you, baby bro.” Hands rested on his shoulders and he spun his head to see his brother and Ruby standing there. Ruby’s pregnant stomach was huge and he knew the twins were due next month. Should she be traveling?
Dean didn’t comment, knowing this was leading somewhere. Somewhere he probably didn’t want to go.
“Don’t be modest, Castiel,” the man’s voice sounded cultured. “He loves our hives and is in the honey shack several times a day helping with bottling, labeling, tasting... mostly tasting.” The man laughed softly, and his expression was fond. Huh, Dean thought. Wonder if they’re a thing?
In the light of the apartment, Castiel looked at the two of them, his daughter and his lover, side by side. How had he not seen the resemblance? Their eyes, the stubborn set of their chins, even their lips were the same. “Dean, did you have blond hair as a child?”
Jack wandered off to see the sights while Castiel helped the women hang up their banners. He introduced himself and found most of them were his age or a bit older. One was paying extra attention to him and he worked the trials of being gay in Texas into the conversation. He was putting more bottled water into the huge cooler when a deep voice made him look up.
He hummed his assent and then reached down to take his own cock in hand. He thrust into his fist as he moved his head faster and faster. Dean was close. His balls were tight against his body and his breaths were coming in harsh gasps for air. “Gonna... fuck...”
He wanted to lie. To keep this between him and Dean for a little while longer. “Yes.”
“I thought you lived with your brother,” Cas said, unwrapping a sandwich made on thick sourdough bread.
Inside Dean’s loft, he pointed toward the bedroom. “Just toss your stuff in there while I make us some lunch.” He didn’t wait to see if Cas did as he asked. He was already mentally going over the ingredients he had on hand to wow his guest. The way to a man’s heart... right? He froze at the thought. Did he really want Cas to fall for him? Would that be fair? Dean wasn’t a happily ever after guy. But... could he be? Then there was the kid to think about. Why was life suddenly so fucking complicated?
“I don’t think that’s the case, Castiel,” Benny was quick to assure him. He patted Castiel on the back and walked off the set. Castiel stood for a few moments longer, looking around at the empty audience seats and the two women loading the dirty cookware onto a cart.
“You asking me to be your roommate, Cas?”
She turned then, seeing him standing there. “Oh, it’s you. Do you have it?” Her sneering face made the decision easier. Her hand reached to cup her breasts. “You had your fun, now you need to pay, Sugar,” she said, laughing up at him.
Castiel stood from his own hiding place. “We do needs you to say yes, Dean.”
“About?” Castiel prompted.
Cas smirked. "You expected them to be bad?"
“I’m sorry, baby girl, but those are my terms. If you want to go to the wilds of Brazil to look at bugs, I’m coming with you.” The mere thought of it sent a shiver down Dean’s spine. He could handle snakes and rodents, but creepy-crawlies freaked him out.
“I have looked over the contract and my attorney seems to think it is fair. It wouldn’t be very often.” Cas’ voice seemed to trail off like he was asking Dean’s permission. Dean’s reaction to Cas’ leaving last week had thrown him for a loop. A night of great sex had suddenly turned to thoughts of fairy tales where Cas was waking in his bed every day.
He followed Cas out into the front again and sat down at a table across from him. “Jack, two coffees, please. And some cookies.” To Dean he said, “I still owe you some cookies.” He smiled and Dean gave him a parody of one. This whole thing seemed so surreal. Jack set two yellow mugs and a plate of cookies down between them.
Leave it to the social awkward guy to find the best gay bar in New York. Dean was glad it was early. After nine, the crowd at Xes would eat Cas alive. Dean responded to Cas’ text. He popped the cap off a beer and was getting ready to take a sip when he got another text.
, you didn’t do that. You kept your head down and minded your own business.
“We let you sleep in,” Mildred said, setting the delicate sugar bowl on the table beside the milk. Castiel rolled his eyes.
. “Can you give me a heads up?”
“My… boyfriend?”
“I’ll eat it on the bus.” She set the empty glass down and gave him a wave. He heard the front door shut and a few minutes later, the chugging sound of the school bus. He finished his coffee and set the cup in the sink.
“I cannot divulge my sources, but let it be known that they are to be believed.”
“I didn’t even know the woman,” Castiel argued. Making him a person of interest because of a public
When the meal was finally served, it was Castiel’s favorite on the Winchester’s menu. His own signature burger that had replaced Dean’s. The champagned flowed late into the night and when Claire began to nod off, Ellen took her out of the high chair and held her close. “I’m taking her to my house. You two have fun.” She winked and walked away.
Once the call ended, Dean rounded on him. “Who the fuck is Stefany?”
“Morning.” Dean set his lunchbox down on a shelving unit near the back door and walked closer. “Do you always leave the back door unlocked?” At five a.m., it could be dangerous and Dean wouldn’t want anything to happen to Cas or the bakery.
Once everything was loaded in the dishwasher, he looked expectantly at Cas. "I don't have to be at the airport for another two hours. We could watch some TV or something. Or if you need me to leave, I can just... go."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Me?  Hel...
Cas took a sip of his drink and Dean steered the conversation to Atlanta’s nightlife versus New York’s. When Cas was done with his beverage, Dean tossed some money on the bar and stood up. “Come on, let’s go.”
He tried not to let his mood get too dark. He should be happy to be a free man once again. Maybe tomorrow. Tonight, he was going to sulk. Maybe Sam had a bottle of whiskey stashed somewhere. Dean stopped that thought as soon as it came. He was not going to end up like his drunken murderer of a father. Dean had been fifteen years without a drink, he damn sure didn’t need one now.
At the pen, Castiel pointed to the center of the pasture where a short stock tank stood. “There’s a faucet out there, just make sure it’s full, but don’t overflow.”
Dean pursed his lips and blew out a breath. He needed a Plan B. He held up a finger to the clerk and pulled out his phone. “Balthazar, please... it’s Winchester.” He leaned against the counter since there wasn’t anyone else waiting. “Hey. I need Novak’s room number... because... because he left something in my car.” Another lie. If there was a God, he’d be ramping up a lightning bolt. “Thanks, dude.”
“Let’s go, Benny,” Dean said behind him and the boat began to move back toward the bait.
“Great. Garth sends his love. He and Bess have got a great place. You have to come with me next year.” Dean had met Garth while in the Marine Corps. After their last mission in Syria, the two decided to get out. Dean put his training to use and became a deputy sheriff and Garth married his high school sweetheart and bought some land in Montana, turning it into a fly-fishing getaway. “Mandy had fun. Bess took her horseback riding and I haven’t heard the end of it. She wants a horse for her birthday.”
“I’m not going to ask if you got closure. So not interested in details. I really called to tell you Gabe got the studio booked and we can start recording Sunday after you’ve rested up from the flight and all this emotional drama.”
means something different to you then,” Dean said, his feelings hurt even though he’d never admit that to anyone. As always, he hid his hurt with anger.
“Cas, let me in.”
. For the first time since Anna died, he didn’t think of Claire as his sister’s child. Claire was his. Would he be able to share her with Dean? As Dean pointed out, that’s what happened in a relationship.
“Now, John,” Castiel whispered.
“Cool. I’ll send a driver over to get you tonight and bring you to Winchester's.”
“You mean we won’t have a masseuse and Jacuzzis?”
“I’m just... Mom and I had an argument.”
“As you should be. I know it is a lot to take in, so we are preparing the contract. It will arrive by courier within the next twenty-four hours. I would suggest having your attorney look over it and we’ll give you a week to make up your mind.” Finally, the man stopped talking and the silence was deafening.
“Yeah, that’s the distance between my house and yours.”
"Claire eat stuff like this?"
She hugged Dean and when he bent his head to listen to something she said, he wondered if she was telling him the same thing.
He felt Cas’ thumb rubbing on the back of his hand. “Dean... I’m a nobody. I’m the one who should be worried about being good enough, but being here, with you, right now...” He inhaled and then exhaled slowly. “I have hope for the future.”
“I don’t want to watch a movie.” Castiel took a deep fortifying breath, his decision made. He took a step forward, then another until he was in Dean’s personal space. Dean’s gaze was glued to his and Castiel saw those magnificent green eyes darken. Dean licked his lips and Castiel’s eyes dropped to watch.
“Our courtship has been unusual from the start.”
Dean sat back stiffly and snatched his hand away. “Jesus, Cas, did you think... You thought I would actually...” It was Castiel’s turn to be shocked. Was Dean trying to tell him that he wouldn’t take his daughter? Dean opened the door and stepped out. The park was deserted and the lights of the downtown skyline would have been stunning on any other night. Castiel was too distraught to notice them. His eyes followed Dean to the front of the Jeep, where he leaned against the hood and stared up at the city. Something told Castiel to leave him alone. As much as the last thirty or so hours had turned his world on its axis, Dean just found out he had a child.
“You are quite welcome. I... I kept it formal because...” Why? What plausible reason could he give. So, Crowley wouldn’t find out that I found you attractive? Or better yet, Crowley wouldn’t find out that I jerked off in the shower and came with an image of you on your knees in my head?
“No, I am just here for…  Dean?” Cas looked up midway through his sentence.
“Oh, my God, you did.” Her voice was shrill and he saw tears gathering and he reached for her. She backed away. “You just ruined my life. Thanks, Dad. Thanks a lot.” She stomped away, but didn’t rejoin the group. She went to the bow of the boat and sat down alone. Dean hung his head. Once again, he’d fucked everything up.
“Your kids are lucky.”
Dean was a celebrity, a chef with his own restaurant, surely his life was more exciting. Maybe he was mocking Castiel.
Green eyes, dancing with humor, stared back at him. “Last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid.”
“Thor or Captain America. Which one would you choose as your freebie?”
“You cheated on him. What did you expect? For him to fucking roll over and take it. Fuck you, Winchester. Now, get out of my place and don’t ever come back.” For a small guy, Gabe could be scary, and honestly, the last thing Dean wanted was a scene. He stood and gave Gabe a salute before leaving.
“First off, I’m not your
“And you came anyway. Why?”
“Now, boys, you will be in a double as well, and the hotel as furnished a cot. It is up to you to decide who sleeps where. Act like adults and please, don’t make me send Benny to referee. He will hurt you.” He handed the one called Jesse the card and they followed the girls toward the elevator. Cas called out to them, “And I suggest you get to sleep. Tomorrow will be a long day.”
“So, on this council then?” Sam asked.
He shut off the television, cleaned up the mess, and crawled into the other bed. The sound of Dean’s steady breathing lulled him into his own fitful sleep.
Dean’s smile made Cas’ heart skip a beat. “Yeah, depends on if you have
“Have a seat,” John said as he scrawled his signature across a document. Dean sat, his Stetson resting on his knee. John pushed the papers aside and looked up. “How’ve you been?” Dean blinked at him, mouth gaping open. “And Jesus, close your mouth, it makes you look simple. Can’t a father ask about his son?”
“Yes... and no. I’m the custodial parent, but she got to see them anytime she wanted. We didn’t have a formal agreement. Until Claire went to college, they spent most of the summers with her and we share birthdays and holidays.”
“Dean, damn it, I
“Yeah,” Dean murmured.
Dean, not one to panic, stared at the ceiling for a few seconds. “Okay, so let’s think this through.” He heard Cas huff beside him and glanced over. His husband was also staring at the ceiling. “You’re... what? Gonna give up and wait until someone discovers our dead bodies?”
Castiel turned around, lowering the plastic cup. “Hello, Dean.”
“Cas, hey, come on...” Castiel remained silent as Dean gave his report to the secretary. “This goes to Garth, and just tell him to call me if he needs any more info.”
“Your wife has her hands full, huh?”
"Everything okay, Dean?" Ash asked, his eyes following an obviously pissed off Cas into his hotel.
Cas shook his head and picked up the knife. A few minutes later, the fish was sizzling in the pan and the aroma of chilies filled the air. In his own kitchen, Dean usually liked to work alone, with his guests seated at the bar to oversee, but with Cas, he found they worked easily in tandem.
“Daddy, Lilith started it. He was minding his own business and she slithered up to him like the skank she is...”
“Yeah. She’s a princess, Sam. She’s so pretty and smart too. She was building this tower of blocks and she knew to put the bigger blocks on the bottom. She’s not even two yet. Isn’t that awesome?”
In lieu of answering, Ketch walked around to the back of the truck and lowered the tailgate. A dead cow, a small cooler, and a cardboard box wrapped in plastic were in the bed. Knowing not to ask questions, Dean tapped the box with his hand.
“I’ve been at this a long time, Castiel. To get to this chair, I had to be damn good at my job. Damn good at reading people. Damn good at telling the truth from lies.” He steepled his hands on top of the file. “In the eighteen years you’ve been at the Agency, you have never even had a reprimand. Not one.”
“Changing the subject, hmm, let’s see...” Castiel tilted his head up to the ceiling and pursed his lips. “I’m pretty fond of the Jurassic movies. The first being my favorite. Jeff Goldblum was amazing.”
“He will grow to trust you, Castiel, but for now, tread lightly. His magic will be strong.”
Luckily for Dean, Meg was gone by lunch and Cas took over the register. He showed Dean how it worked, but he wanted him to shadow Jack for real training.
“Claire...”
When Novak, Castiel, no, Cas, started going on about his tasting menu, it pushed home just how rich and pretentious he was. They were polar opposites. Dean was a
“How’s Cas?”
People had begun to gather including a tall man with a notepad. Through the glass windows at the front of the library, Castiel saw familiar blue and red lights. Fuck. “Why don’t you crawl back under the rock you most obviously live under...” He was interrupted by that same deputy pushing open the door of the library. Dean Winchester. Well, shit.
“How did you come by this information?” Missouri asked, not letting this go for an instant.
“Far from it... hence the title
Benny’s prediction was correct. The stern of the boat was low in the water. “I’ll need everyone up front to balance the weight.” Cas and Jo crawled up to the bow. Ketch set the box of explosives next to Dean and nodded.
