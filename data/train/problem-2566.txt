"So it wouldn't hurt so much? So I don’t have to spend the rest of my life thinking about the fact that I lost you. How many years has it been? And how can it be that it got worse rather than better over time? And then... then Sam was gone and I... I'm not even allowed to feel angry with him anymore? Now I'm supposed to feel guilty when I look at you and think that you used to be mine."
"What?" Cas asks, looking back and forth between them. "Was that supposed to be a secret? How should I have known?"
"He wanted to get home after class to get dinner ready for us -  and you shouldn’t always call him that."
Sam frowned, he could tell Dean was bullshitting him. "I know you and Cas only had each other for a while. I understand if —"
Dean runs a hand down his face. He's barely managed to listen to their conversation. "How about you two super detectives do that. And I stick to the original plan?"
"Why did you pick him?" Dean asks, as they step through the tall grass back to the car, more idle this time. They have no place to get to in a hurry. "Your list of vics was endless, why this one?"
He wants to reply something light-hearted, but instead it’s a curt "Shut up," that leaves Sam blinking at him confusedly.
As they start flirting, Castiel feels the urge to look away. He doesn't really need to be here. He knows now that Dean is safe.
"Is there no angel you can think of that Sam might have spent an exuberant time in close proximity with?" He was still glaring, spitting words at him. "Is there no way for you to consider that maybe it’s got nothing to do with you or the perceived lack of trust Sam has in you that he’s not spoken about these things? That maybe, just maybe, Dean, he finds it unbearable and shameful to speak about? He needs your acceptance, not your judgement."
Castiel’s eyes are blue in a way he’s never seen on a human being. On a dog, maybe. As a description for the color of the sea or the sky or something else that’s actually deep blue. Blue-blue.
"You're right," Sam says. "Sorry. You're totally right." He takes the napkin and the food wrappers off the table, and throws them into the trash. Then he takes the jacket off the back of his chair.
Castiel tells the man why they are here and after a moment of hesitation and some coaxing from Dean, he starts talking. At the end, Castiel hands him a generous 50 bucks and they thank him for his help. He never leaves his sleeping bag the whole time. Dean gets it; it's freezing.
She squints a little and tilts her hand, and something about that sets his insides into a twist. "Okay," she says, eventually, and nods like she's still trying to convince herself this a good idea. "Why not."
There’s a faint smile on Sam’s lips as he settles back into his seat and watches Castiel in the rear mirror.
"If you really think I should go to the morgue instead, I can do that." Castiels’ knuckles brush against the back of Sam’s hand. "But I’d rather not leave you alone right now."
There’s something strange about digging up bones with the sun still shining and birds chirping in the trees.
Unlike him, Sam’s got his sadness and anger all in the open. He's got his nightmares and his panic and all that shit. But he also got Cas now. And Dean can't help but think that these two things are connected somehow. Sam being less repressed, being able to open up and getting rewarded the person he wants in return.
"I needed to check it anyway. And don’t start complaining again." He pauses. "You better spend your time coming up with a good excuse for when your parents show up here and drag you into their car."
The case is really only of peripheral interest to Sam. Instead, Dean’s words about things being too quiet are ringing in his ears, as he walks into the lobby of the motel. He’s probably not being paranoid.
Sam didn't even nod. He glanced over their sleeping daughter's features once more and stood up. "We're gonna leave once she wakes up then, me and her.”
"I'm just heading to the bathroom." Half out of the door, he turned to Castiel once more. "You know what's really idiotic about all of this?" He tried to make his voice as firm as possible. "I can't even continue pretending that there's nothing between us now. That I don't have feelings for you. I can't lie to Dean and I can't lie to myself any longer either.”
"You said that we wanted to move to California to live closer to Charlie and I happened to find this really great, empty house and somehow, that’s not good enough for you?" He couldn’t help his voice from getting louder. "What do you want apart from bringing us all down with your shitty mood?"
When they show affection to each other in Dean's presence it's always soft and gentle. Not exactly passionless, but almost completely devoid of sexual undertones. Dean realizes he hasn't ever even seen them kiss beyond a peck. He doesn't understand it. If Castiel were his boyfriend, if he got to-
"No." She squints. "Well, he had some spells of depression, but doesn't everyone? He wasn't ill! There weren't any signs. He was lovely to me the day before."
He was surprised that she followed him quietly. She didn’t say a word, neither to him nor to the nurses in the ward room. She followed him like a shadow or an invisible friend. Then she opened the passenger door of his car and got in while the rain was still pounding onto the roof.
They weren't equal, and they both wouldn't ever have thought they were, but in this they were in the same boat. Sam had dropped them down here, into this seeming eternity of nothing. He had stolen Lucifer's freedom. (A prisoner goes crazy even in the best conditions.) Lucifer took it out on him, as a form of torture, sure, to get his revenge, too —but he was also just staving of boredom. He had no home down there, either. No home but Sam.
The sound of chopping filled the silence, until Dean spoke again. "Don’t tell Charlie, but I’m honestly dreading the day she’s going to run off to college."
"Is this a new aftershave? I like it." Dean had caught him on the way back from the bathroom to his room. "Go get ‘em, tiger. I mean, seriously, Sammy, when was the last time you scored?"
Sam swallows the half chewed mouthful of cornflakes-milk-mush and shakes his head. "I thought he was just sleeping in."
A strange thought occurred to Dean then. He was surprised that he had never thought to ask it before. “By the way, what
Dean could use some encouragement right now too. He wavers a little. He realizes the tugging feeling he's subconsciously been fighting the past minute is the urge to kiss Castiel. He's gotten so used to this in a way, wanting to touch Castiel and not allowing himself. Apparently it gets stronger when everything feels more urgent. Dean wonders, how it would be in a real life or death situation. If he'd ever just let the emotions sweep him away, if he'd let the urges take control then.
When his eyes slid to the ground because something told him that he was no longer allowed to look at Dean, he noticed the unicorn coloring book lying on the shelf.
She nodded, wiped over her eyes, and then looked at the floor, starting to undress. She showered quickly, and once the blood had all been washed down the drain, there was nothing on her body reminiscent of what had taken place.
A few days later, Cas and Sam are sitting on the couch, watching a documentary about the beginning of World War I. Cas' pick.
Sam looks past Castiel’s head to where the voice comes from. On the other bed, Lucifer sits, his feet dangling in the air.
"Damn it, Cas! It's always the same kind of crap! Over and over! I'm out trying to save the damn world and you're all in here playing at being a happy family." Dean breathed heavily. "Don't you get what that feels like?"
Charlie turned away from Sam, who was holding her waist firmly. She stretched her arm high up into the air and pretended to be picking from a tree. Then she held out her hand to Castiel again.
Outside on the street, Dean pulls his hands over his face as a shield against the drizzle and turns around, looking for a place that doesn't seem too horrible. He doesn't want to get wet again before he gets any food into him.
He should have known better than to ask for a favor. He could drive himself crazy thinking about Castiel in situations like this. He just didn’t get how much his indifference hurt. At least Dean hoped that he didn’t understand, as the alternative —him just not caring enough— was worse.
"Dean Winchester, you're quite a character. You live by your own rules, I like that." He held the laptop under his armpit. "I bet that's a pretty lonely life, only you and your ideals."
He starts the car, happy there’s a case to focus on. It's not the first victim of this kind in the area. Just a few towns over there was a similar ominous “animal attack” that never made it to any papers. He reads through hacked police records —it's a miracle they ever got any work done pre-Internet. Pretty soon, everything points to the same guy. IT dude. Mid-30s, loner type, recently moved here for a job. Dean gets his address from a disgruntled co-worker who's fed up trying to dodge this guy’s advances. Before Dean leaves the car, he checks his phone. No news are good news, but the blank screen still disappoints. He slams the door shut and heads for the trunk of his car to get his weapons.
"Two vampires, a werewolf, over there is a shapeshifter, and those burned remains were probably a witch."
Dean puts his hand on his shoulder. "Let me just go on my own today," he says. "It's probably nothing anyway. Next time you're back on. Alright?"
"I still don't get why you're suddenly starting to celebrate your birthday.” Sam shook his head. "You never did before.”
"I was under the impression that you found it distressing when he and I fought. Most people prefer harmony."
That's pretty much been what the past weeks have been about for Dean. Thinking about Sam's Lucifer thing and trying not to get angry about it. With some well-deserved breaks for the whole gut-punching "still very much in love with my brother's boyfriend" thing. It's even started affecting his sleep. Has been creeping into his dreams with regularity.
The expression on Castiel's face was also unusual. There was so much suppressed anger and unspoken words.
Dean closed his eyes and tried to swallow down the feeling that he was going to shatter in pieces any second now. He wanted to be that someone for Sam. Why had it gotten so complicated?
"Don’t Charlie me! I was looking forward to seeing him so much and then he goes and treats me like this."
The factory is bigger than Sam had imagined. He doesn't remember Sam and Castiel giving any specifics about the victim's whereabouts, so they wander around the whole thing rather aimlessly. Sam looks up at the big old-fashioned machinery, dusted and coated in spiderwebs. He notices their beauty on the periphery of his recognition; the small part of him that is not focused on finding clues. The last door at the back looks so innocuous that they almost don't try it. Inside is a sleeping bag and some bags of food, but no person.
"I appreciate the sentiment, but I wouldn't like to think you keep me around because you think I'm good for Sam's well-being."
His heart seemed to skip a beat. "Just go,” Sam said and then he slammed the door into Dean's face and ran after Charlie.
Once they're in the hallway, Dean nods through the glass door that separates them from the man at the desk.
Sam wants to laugh. There are a lot of words he’d use to describe himself, unafraid is not one of them.
"No, of course not." Castiel shook his head, but his expression remained mystified. "Yes, let us go home then."
»Yeah, I bet if you get to know her she's actually really nice. I'm still glad when we finally get to gank her. Baby needs a new bumper thanks to old Yoko Ono in that medieval dress of hers, so excuse me if I'm not about to shed a tear for her.«
Now that Dean has the chance to talk about whatever he wants, he finds it difficult to do so. It's not that he wants to talk about something other than Sam in general. What would be the point, when Dean's thoughts circle around him most of the time anyway? How to get him better, how to make sure he's safe, how to get him to need Dean again.
The number on the display wasn't Dean's. Maybe he was calling from a phone booth, or someone had dialed the wrong number.
"Maybe you're right." Sam's voice was firm now. Maybe he was just exhausted. "This is a very good hospital and maybe they or we will find a solution and everything will be fine, but maybe not." Sam reached for Dean's hand with an intensity that startled him. "All I want to say is that I might die, whether we like it or not." He swallowed. "I know I have no right to ask anything of you. Not after what I did. But still." He took a deep breath. "Please Dean, take care of them when I can't do it anymore. You have to protect Charlie."
Him. Sam doesn't have to say who he's referring to. He doesn't have to explain the euphemism for his own mental state.
Dean gets drunk enough to the point where he can blame it on the alcohol. But not drunk enough to not know it's a bad idea when a hand lands on his knee and he doesn't shove it off.
Of course, he stills knows their friendship isn't very conventional. Who’s to say he’s doing it wrong, though, when there’s no manual for angel-human relationships. There it is again, that sneaky r-word that makes him feel all weird inside. It's not a relationship, it's not.
Lila cocked her head as if she had to think about his words. He had last seen her almost a decade ago. There was nothing left of the cocky teenager that he’d known; before him stood a grown woman and a mighty werewolf.
"Well," Dean says. "There you go. My spider senses aren’t tingling, what about yours? If you two want to go to Oregon, house-shopping while it’s cheap, I’m fine with that. Knock yourselves out. But I wouldn’t want to drive out there for just that."
Dean felt the strong instinct to ask about all of this. About the hunched up-ness and the staring. The »Everything okay, Sammy?« was on his lips. But Bobby was right there with him, and anyway, it wasn't the right moment to talk.
Whatever reasons there are for his freak outs, overanalyzing them probably won’t help. He’ll just have to get over himself. It’ll be fine. He wants this. And while Castiel is hardly pressuring him, he’s clearly not opposed to the idea either.
"Oops, sorry," Charlie laughed and kissed him on the lips. "We totally forgot the time when we walked across campus. Did you know that my Dad used to go here too?"
"I can’t get through to him anymore, but you can." Dean halts, wavers, before asking: "What happened yesterday?"
"What are you talking about?" Sam asks, irritated at the turn their conversation has taken and the way Castiel’s shoulders sag, as he continues to speak.
Dean was too tired to push him away again. He did not want to either. He just wanted to enjoy the fact that Castiel was really here, right now, with him.
"You haven't had nightmares in the past two weeks," Cas says, cocking his head to the side, exposing the smooth skin emerging from under the collar of his shirt.
There was just a tiny shameful part of him that wouldn’t have minded if Sam had stayed away for another one or two days. He’d been in heaven, he’d been safe and cozy up there.
Castiel looked through the window again. The lights of the night made his face look ghostly. He felt for Sam’s hand and squeezed it. "Did I hurt you today?" he asked, his eyes fixed.
"Does something like this happen around here a lot?" Dean asked. The sheriff looked at him as if he saw him for the first time.
"Oh." Castiel still looked confused, as he glanced between Charlie and Sam. "Yes," he finally said in a serious voice. "I would very much like to have an apple."
Sometimes acting like you’re not bothered by something feels pretty close to actually not being bothered by it.
No, that can't be it. Castiel doesn't heal him, he's almost powerless right now. Still, the simple touch alone feels enormous and meaningful. Dean leans forward, into the touch.
Castiel turns his head into the direction of the kitchen and then back: "I think, ultimately, it is Sam's decision how he wants to proceed."
"You guys want to take your food to your own room?" Dean asks, holding out one of the paper bags. Sam seems to take it as the ridiculous suggestion it is. "Of course not."
She crunches up her face and then straightens it, as if she's trying to figure out the right way to remember. "I went inside and I wanted to get these into the kitchen, but it was kind of occupied."
»Yup.« He grinned at Sam. He hadn't seen an expression this carefree on his brother's face in a long time. »Pretty festive, don't you think?«
He knows that there've been countless times when he wished to step even closer when the angel's forgotten about the importance of personal space. But he hardly ever does.
He didn't have to ask Sam to know where they were heading. He automatically steered the Impala towards the highway.
"What?" Dean's face twitches in irritation. "I thought — I mean, we were told suicide was ruled out early on."
Castiel follows Dean's gaze around the room. "He didn't say much. The girl worked here and we found a flyer among the pensioner's things."
"Because we're all working this case and this is stupid. And you were being an ass to her for no reason."
"You were right from the start." Sam sat down on the bed again. "You knew that I'd love her and that things would turn out okay somehow. I wouldn’t have thought it possible; I was so desperate and depressed back then." He shook his head. "Thank you for talking me out of giving her away. Thank you for being there for me when I didn't know what to do. What am I saying?" He smiled. "Thank you for everything. For all the countless times in my life when you were there for me."
"I thought a lot about the discussion I prompted last night," Castiel eventually says. "I wasn't aware that some topics were so fraught between the two of you."
It was ridiculous. He'd probably imagined the knock. And even if it'd been real, it'd be for someone else.
The woman shook her head again. "Parents shouldn’t project their own wishes and dreams onto their children. They need to be allowed to be just kids."
"I don't know," Sam says. "You can't really know what this world would look like without me. I mean, I saved the Earth, sure, but I also caused the apocalypse. So it's 50/50 at best."
"But we do have a special bond." Now Charlie took a step forward. Her mood had also changed from silly to tense. "Usually an archangel protects the prophet, but since there aren’t any left, it is my job."
Dean felt the helplessness of the last hour give way to anger. He had to make an effort not to get loud.
"That's just the thing. At first, it was great. You know, when Dean told me he’d set up a date for me, it just sounded dreadful, but I figured I'd just get it over with and endure one crappy evening. How bad could it get, right?"
"Maybe it's the ghost of a dead animal?" He laughed but soon became serious again."Can you hand me that wrench over there?"
Sam stretched out his arms and moved them and his legs through the snow. He repeated the labored movement a few times before halting.
Later, Sam wouldn't be able to fully remember at what point they had left the couch and made their way back into the bedroom, where he at least thought to lock the door behind them. How they had managed to come apart for long enough to change rooms, when every second their bodies didn't touch had almost physically hurt.
He decides to lie down on the narrow bed and he's not surprised when Cas follows him, his shoulder pressing into his.
Sam stretches out, takes a disposable napkin in his hands and balls it up in his fist. A nervous gesture. "Some stuff the therapist said, you know, it got me thinking… " He squeezes the poor napkin to death. "About living an authentic life."
In the hallway Sam's eyes were drawn to his brother's bare feet on the floor. It made him look oddly vulnerable. Sam imagined they them to be cold.
"I love you," Sam said suddenly. It sounded strangely weighty and sincere in his ears. As if he hadn't said it countless times before. When they said goodbye. When they had sex. Or after one of their few arguments - they have hardly quarreled since they were together, which was a little surprising, if he thought about it now, and a +1 for Sam on the Dean / Sam list.
His wet hair hung in his face, hiding most of it. All Dean could make out were his blue of his lips.
"It's not hard to understand. I'm not a child. I understand. Dad's in love with you and that's why he broke up with Dean."
He averts his eyes, pushes some buttons, puts in some coins, and buys one can of coke and one soda water.
Sam puts the coke on the table and, for a lack of chair, sits down on the bed. The keys in his back pocket feel heavy. He’s sure Dean will consider it a provocation, instead of an attempt to keep an actual fight out of the way.
Sam thinks. Castiel makes it sound like he's a teenage virgin afraid of deflowering and not... well. Like a grown man having a panic attack the second someone puts a hand down his pants. Well, no, not someone. His partner. Someone he's both attracted to and in love with.
He had not meant to run into Sam again; he had not been hanging around in the hallway, waiting for him to turn up.
Castiel looks down at himself, back at Dean, and then he pulls it over his head. He rolls it up inside his lap before. Dean leans over, picks it up and throws it into the backseat. "It's just been bugging me," he says.
"Hello Dean," Castiel said. At least his voice sounded normal again. "Was there any trouble on the way back?"
"Last night after you fell asleep, I was browsing the news." He turns his head sharply towards Sam. "You remember Portland? You asked me to tell you if I planned on going again."
Sam stops in front of a burger place. The bright lights and bad photography on display suggest overt greasiness, but he thinks they shouldn’t walk much further. He knows how Dean can get when he’s hungry. This should do. Maybe he can just get a packaged salad on their way back. He remembers passing the bright neon sign of an open supermarket.
"I still don't understand," Castiel says like he hasn't heard a word of what Dean has told him. "I will have to ask Sam why he would feel the need to-"
"It's a broad genre," Sam says, and then explains, "It was Cas' choice. I asked him to play something he likes."
Castiel is only startled for a second before he reacts to the kiss. When Sam brackets his legs and leans into him, he inches forward too. His coffee cup drops out of his hand; some of the tepid liquid lands on Sam's jeans, soaking the seams on his left pant leg.
"She sure did. She asked me what kind of pact we made, so we could have a child together. And when I told her the truth, she laughed." He pulled the trigger again but there was nothing to hear except for an empty clicking sound. "'You know Dean, I used to hate you,' she said, 'but now I only feel pity, because you're the one he's fucking over the most.”
Sam walks over to him, sits down on the bed and studies his brother's face. He wears a look of embarrassment. "A guy gave you his number?" he asks. "And you kept it."
Sam knows. So he tells himself he’s fine with it. There’s no point in not being fine with it, when there’s nothing he could do to change it.
"She is not your angel." Dean laughed. It sounded almost aggressive. "And there’s no special bond." He made a dismissive gesture. "That’s all bullshit."
Castiel raises his left eyebrow and looks at Dean like he hasn't even considered this as an option. But knowing Castiel that can't be right.
"You are probably the only person who can still change her mind now," Castiel said. "I'm so very weak right now." He looked directly at Sam. "But if we hurry up and don't stay in the past too long, my powers should be enough."
He wills himself to think about the case instead. It doesn’t help his mood. At least it feels somewhat more productive if not less guilt-ridden. He knows the girl’s death is not on him in any way, but the way her father looked at him. He saw straight through him to his uselessness.
That was also the moment Castiel's legs started to move again. "Charlie!" He paid no attention to the figure on the floor and ran straight for his daughter.
"Yeah, and his general-" With his index finger he draws circles into the air next to his temple. "I mean. What
He shoves the curtain aside to peer into a living room that looks exactly like he thought it would. Clean and spacious, with uncomfortable but expensive chairs, unusable low wooden tables and big paintings on the wall. In the middle of the room, a vase and a flower bouquet that could get you a nice Macallan, at least a 12 year old one.
"Maybe we could go out for lunch? There is an organic bistro that opened where the washer used to be. I know you are interested in a more climate friendly lifestyle.”
She glances inside the room. If she’s surprised to see Castiel there instead of Sam she doesn’t let it on.
"Are you asking me if I want to be with you again? Are you joking? We haven't spoken a word in months and the conversations we had before that -" The drunk calls Dean had made could hardly be called real conversations. “You never got in touch, and now I just happen to be here and you spring something like that on me?"
Castiel walks towards the window and leans back against the sill. "I don't know much about psychology, but I do know it's not good to keep things hidden inside."
"I will distract the angels as much as possible." Castiel said. "You have to go to her school immediately and take her some place safe."
It was much easier to watch Dean laugh than to bear his worried looks all the time. Of course, those were still there too, but Dean obviously tried really hard to treat him as normally as possible. In this case it meant that he was more friendly and relaxed with him than he had been for the last six months.
And what exactly was it that Dean wanted him to do anyway? Maybe all he needed was a promise that they weren’t going to leave him this time. That he wasn’t going to be left alone and just dropped as a family member all over again. Dean knew they would be fine on their own - Cas and Sam, but Charlie too. He felt pathetic but at least he was self-aware enough to recognize the truth now: they all didn’t need him the same way he needed them.
Cas' sits closely to his side and tries a slice of each. Thankfully, he's not being fed by Sam this time —an image Dean's still trying to erase from his mind.
"I think there’s still a box of his stuff. Someone was supposed to pick it up, but they never came."
"It doesn't sound crazy, it sounds absolutely impossible! I'm pretty sure I've just been kidnapped by some kind of religious Mansion Family thing." His laugh rang shrill. "What exactly are you going to do to me? Cut me open and probe me?"
When he hung up, Sam put his cell phone onto the living room table, grabbed one of the glasses that Castiel had put down and emptied it one go.
"No. What are you guys talking about?" He looks at both of them with irritation. "I just felt like… It was me. I just. Did whatever I wanted, you know?"
He towers over Castiel. His posture isn’t intimidating —humans will never not seem tiny— but his anger is.
"Yeah," Dean nods, as he heaves himself into the other armchair. "What happened to the salt circles?"
Sam pushed the blanket aside, got up and went out into the hall. The door to Charlie's room was ajar. Sam leaned against the door frame and peeked inside.
"That makes sense," Castiel says. She turns her attention to him now and offers her hand. He takes it but doesn't say his name.
"There are good reasons why an angel is forbidden to father a nephilim." She looked directly at him. "They are like mythical creatures in your old legends, like the Minotaur or the Harpy - cruel, powerful and difficult to control."
"Really?" She raises an eyebrow at Sam, who shrugs non-committedly. "I’m going to get four plates then."
A milkshake date, Dean thinks and tries to connect the mental image with the two men in front of him. It doesn't really work.
The very next moment, he sat in the middle of nowhere. Wet grass below him, a thousand stars shining above him and next to him loomed Dean, who still held the cell phone in his hand. He lowered it slowly.
On their way back to the bunker, Castiel watched him from the passenger seat. Sam kept his eyes on the road, never looking over.
Dean stares ahead at the front door, trying not to picture the scene too closely and failing. "Did they see you when you ran out?"
Sam shrugs and drinks the last of his beer. "I'm beat," he says, and gets up. "I should probably head to bed."
"Well." Sam shook his head slowly. "I'm surprised that this time you're not accusing me of having another child."
The relief is instant. The feeling of guilt slips away, the thoughts of Lucifer are gone, the memories of Jessica cleared.
Her voice sounded uncertain. Dean gripped the knife with both hands. Now he just had to get closer without getting noticed.
Castiel and Charlie both got up and went into the kitchen. Dean and Sam were putting down a crate of beer. They were surrounded by a lot of shopping bags.
Sam sat down on the couch and rubbed over his forehead. Sometimes he managed to look so fragile, his shoulders slouched forward, his arms braced on his knees. He reminded him of the protagonist in a Greek tragedy, moments before the finale.
Dean leans back against the cool tiles and shrugs. He looks away from Castiel's troubled face again. He doesn't want to think about Castiel's "new experiences".  A look at the door prompts him to wonder what kind of daring person scribbled ACAB with a Sharpie on the frame. Especially considering there are cameras in the bathroom.
'Being with' —now that's a euphemism he needs to erase from his lexicon. When it comes to thinking about the cage there's only ever two options: euphemistic words that make him sound empowered and in control, or the truth. The latter one is not a good idea when you're trying to go on with your life. When you're trying hard to build a barrier between what once was and what is now.
Sam tries to dig beyond the worry and into the rational mind. He's a good hunter, dammit. This is his work. He should be able to treat this like any other case. But the truth is that some hunts can take a really long time and a lot of them aren't solved within a day. Another truth: they don't save everyone. (But why is he already thinking in terms of casualties?)
He wants to ask Castiel what he's even getting out of this. It's on the tip of his tongue, but he's not sure if he wants to hear the answer. He can't bear the thought that Castiel does any of this out of a false sense of sympathy or duty. There is no way to ask this without sounding insane. And he wouldn’t be completely sure if he’s just asking about the sex.
When they catch the creatures in St. Louis, he mostly watches from the sidelines as Dean kills them.
"It's not like getting pizza is difficult for him. He just zaps himself back and forth. I’m not even sure if he’s paying."
"What?" Dean pulls a face. "Of course not." He shakes his head at the very idea. "I don’t think she’s even legal. She kept talking about college applications." He narrows his eyes at Castiel. "Why did you think I was having sex with a teenage girl?" Castiel opens his mouth but Dean interrupts. "On second thought, don’t answer that."
No one can claim that Dean doesn’t try to be fine with all of this. He really is doing his best. But the way Sam smirks at Cas while handing him his coffee, gleeful in this almost conspiratory teasing, it’s just not right.
"You're not useless." Frustration crops up inside of Dean. Hearing Castiel speak like this hurts. Dean should be able to show him it's bullshit. Castiel's the most wondrous being he's ever met. "Dude, you're so not useless. You're an angel," Dean offers lamely, "and a great soldier."
"Hey," Dean says, all hard and like his face isn't carved with worry. "You're up. We've already been waiting for you for a few hours. We took turns on checking up on you." He starts putting the cards into a pile. "How you feeling?"
"No." He leaned against the wall again. "We never fight. For us to fight, he'd have to understand what I'm telling him in the first place.”
Castiel sits in front of the gleaming TV. He watches the commercial for heart medication with great interest, but he turns it off, once Sam steps closer.
Castiel didn't reply, but instead seemed to decide to shelve the provided information somewhere in his  infinite celestial brain.
»I did.« With a groan Bobby lifted his backpack off his shoulders. »We shouldn't run into any problems. But you never know.«
At the other side of the room, Charlie was just holding onto Dean's arm and laughing at something he said. Sam couldn't remember when he had last made her laugh like that.
It’s strange, spending this much time in a high school and not having Dean make one dumb cheerleader comment. It would probably sound hollow even to his own ears right now. Knowing that Sam now knows that his true type is more angel in a trench coat than teenager in a skimpy outfit.
Dean shrugged. He had hoped that Castiel would sit down next to him, but he remained leaning against the house. Dean stood up to embrace him. Castiel studied Dean with interest in his eyes, but he didn’t do anything for or against the touch. He just let it happen.
Sam nodded. He had taken off his shoes in the entrance area, which was strange because Dean was still wearing his. The rustling of the kettle filled the silence between them and from Sam's expression he could see that he was just as grateful for it as he was.
"I guess I should head to the hardware store. I ordered some wood a few days ago and I keep forgetting to go."
"I'm to blame for Sam's death. And I didn't manage to protect my daughter. Tell me how is any of it not my fault? ”
Jody is almost at the door, when Dean jumps up. "Hey. I just remembered I needed to get some stuff myself. For the cooler. As you said, we got a long drive ahead of us. Mind if tag along to the store?"
In the car there's silence for a long while. Dean is fine with not talking. Sam has his eyes closed, leaning his head back against the headrest, but clearly awake. Castiel looks out of the window. Neither of them bat an eyelid when Dean turns the radio louder. He wants to listen to Foreigner sing about hot bloodedness and easy girls, whatever's furthest away from his reality right now.
"Yes." Castiel's nod is barely there. "You were trying to not let these things get between us, and decided to send me away, and thereby risked letting these things get between us."
Bobby looked at him suspiciously. Before he got the chance to express his disbelief about Dean's cooking abilities, they heard the front door open.
"Maybe the guy is just mistaken after all?" Sam asks, untangling the flimsy fork from the sticky plastic. "I mean, you both said he seemed weird to you."
"It was a long day," Dean says and downs the last of his beer, sets it down. His knuckles knock on the table. "Night."
"Oh. Good." There's the smallest hint of a smile on Castiel's lips. "I hope you understand why it was important to me to know? I — I know you used to think I was coming on too strong or that I was too much in your space, and it took me a long while to understand how intrusive that must have been for you. I hate the idea that you found me invasive or that I made you uncomfortable."
"Sam, I have thought about it some more." Castiel sounds serious. The light's been turned off, and they have been lying still beside each other in the bed.
She doesn't ask any more questions, but Sam feels like she's looking at him differently. She knows about the Lucifer vessel thing, she knows about the demon blood and Ruby, but it's being with an angel that weirds her out? Or maybe it's not that. Maybe she just doesn't like being fooled. Thinking things are one way, when they're the other.
Decapitating with a machete is more difficult than it looks. Dean has to go in a second time. By then, the hippie vamp girl’s face is full of blood. She screams, probably mourning the death of her decade-long lover, Dean imagines.
Sam is vaguely aware that he must be imagining the reverence in Castiel’s voice. Or that he's, at the very least, over interpreting it. This is just how he's always said Dean’s name, with gravitas and depth. It's not new or meaningful.
Because there's no way he'd be going to heaven. He’s not sure if that’s even possible, with the demon part that's still running through him, that's always going to be in him.
"You gotta work with me here, Cas," Sam says. "I don't know what you want of me right now." He searches Castiel's eyes. "Are you angry with me?"
"You know," Sam says after an hour of tiresome translations and drifting thoughts. He puts his finger as a bookmark between the pages of angel lore he's trying to decipher, and look up. "If you ever feel like joining him, you could."
Fortunately Sam returned and spared Dean the decision whether he should stuff his niece full of sugar or not.
"Dean is a very good cook too. Maybe you could give him the recipe," Castiel said to Dean’s surprise.
Sam froze in motion and fixed the plates in his hand as intensely as if stacking them together was a task that would overwhelm him both cognitively and emotionally.
Lila was unimpressed. "And you hide who you really are." She took a few steps towards Charlie. "Look at you. You smell of nothing but humanity." She made a derogatory gesture. There was some laughter. "Why are you diminishing yourself? Why do you try to be like them even though you are born to be something much bigger? They will never understand you and they will never accept you as one of their own."
"Just a little tension between Dean and me," Sam says and kicks off his shoes. "Nothing new." He sees Dean's point, now that he wants to recount their fight to Castiel once more. He wouldn't want Castiel to do it if the roles were reversed either.
"I don't know," Castiel shifts his position, moving closer both to the wall and to Dean. He looks uncomfortable. "I don't fully understand the situation myself."
"It was nice," Sam says. "The place was nice. We just realized we prefer watching movies in the bunker," Sam says, his voice soft and carrying something beyond the obvious. Something that Dean can't pinpoint, but that makes him uncomfortable.
"Yeah." It's not like keeping Sam away really helped him much on the not worrying front. Or any other front. "Full disclosure," Dean says. "I talked to some people about your... thing. I read a bunch of books, trying to find something that-" He watches Sam for signs of anger, but there aren't any. "I know I said I wouldn't, but you knew I would."
Adoption wasn’t something you did in a day. There was a whole process to it. They’d spent a lot of time and thought into this without ever telling him.
"Yeah. Maybe," he runs a hand through his hair, "maybe that's a good idea. I just need to get used it."
It was not a lie, he thought. He did feel sorry when he hurt Dean, when he felt he’d disappointed him. If Castiel knew how to curb these moments from occurring, he would.
"People disappearing in LA. Just because they turned up in a dumpster doesn’t make it a case." He laughed. "That’s the problem with big cities. You don’t even need any monsters."
Sam looks around the room until he can make out Castiel against the backdrop of the dark green wallpaper.
When he opens them again, Castiel is still there, holding his hand, looking up, an unsettled look in his eyes.
"I don’t know, Dean. Or rather: I think you should talk about things pertaining to Sam with Sam himself."
So there was a God after all, but he’d turned out to be an egomaniacal idiot, hiding somewhere, Earth his abandoned playground.
"Obviously not." Dean put his arms up in the air, in question. "You wanna let me keep on guessing now or what?"
Something vibrated. How strange that she hadn't thought it was necessary to take his phone from him.
"I know you've made your opinion very clear to me, but I just have to ask once more, face to face: You have no interest in resuming a romantic relationship with me at any point, do you?"
Maybe a neighbour has heard the shots. He listens for a second, but he hears no people, no steps and no sirens. Just his own breathing in an otherwise quiet room.
Dean leans against the trunk of his car. She joins him. Together they face the front door of the house in silence.
"Because I keep imaging facing Dean and the fight that's going to break out, when he hears that you went with me."
Castiel pulls away too soon. "I'm very glad to see you're feeling okay," he says, already facing the door. Sam tails him out of the room.
Sam shook his head wearily. "I left because I couldn't take it anymore. Living like this all the time, always tiptoeing around you. Always being scared I might just use the wrong word, and trying to figure out what's going to set you off again... So you're not happy how things are? Guess what, none of us are! The amount of time and effort we all have to put in keeping your jealous rage in check stands in no proportion to anything. And you, and this – it's not good for Charlie, don't you get it? I can't have her growing up around this kind of toxic crap!” He took a step back again and shook his head and turned to Castiel. "I don't understand how you can stand it, Cas,” he said wearily, before he disappeared down the hall.
"Uh, a little," is what comes out. He looks nothing like Castiel, and now that Dean has caught himself, the blue of his eyes are wrong too. He looks like a regular business guy in his sharp expensive suit. He's fit - like he runs every day. The type of guy that Sam might have turned into if Dean hadn't disturbed his original life plans. Only his brown hair is a little too messy, tousled not as a styling choice but like he's had a rough night himself. And he probably has, if he's spending it out, drinking alone.
Castiel looks him up and down. "Your capability to not shy away from the darker sides of human existence isn't a character flaw," he says, "if that is what you meant."
Castiel cocked his head in question, but before he could ask what was going on, Dean was already out of the room.
In the entrance area of the children’s clinic there was a mood of desolation - exhausted parents, crying toddlers and various building blocks with which nobody played.
"You could still get a second room," Castiel says, sitting down on the other bed. "If you wanted to."
"I stayed with you for most of it." He sounds almost apologetic. "Until two hours ago, when I heard Dean clanking with pots and pans. I got up to tell him to keep it down."
The past weeks have taught him not to turn on the lamp, if he doesn’t want to cause a full-blown fight. Most days he still turns the switch, out of principle. Now he just leaves the door open wide, so the light from the hallway lets him see enough to not run into any furniture again.
Then he poured himself another glass of whiskey. Out of the corner of his, Castiel watched him. If you paid close attention you could see the slight tremor in his hands.
Dean looks straight ahead at the dark street in front of him. He doesn't have to think about this one. "Yeah, of course."
Dean wonders if her total surprise has something to do with her interest in Sam. He decides against it. There's no jealousy written over her face.
"I'll be quick, sweet girl," the man whispered close to her face. "I'll give you a wonderful dream."
The vampire looks puzzled for a moment when Cas stretches out his arm and puts his hand to its forehead in an almost sanctifying motion.
When Sam finally groans and moves his head, it takes Dean all his strength to get a jovial tone in his voice.
"I know." Castiel pinches the bridge of his nose and presses his eyes close. Their rims look red and raw.
Sam manages to pull a face that looks like he's rolling his eyes when he's not. It's that thing Dean remembers teachers doing in grade school. When they think you're too dumb to understand how they really see you, and assume it's okay as long as they don't say it out loud or get too in your face about it.
He parked Baby near the harbor and took one of the tourist boats to Alcatraz. The prison building and the exhibition about the life of the inmates was interesting but he missed being able to talk to someone. Even the ticket seller seemed annoyed by his attempts to chat. Later he sat down in a restaurant, surrounded by tourists and locals, with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge that was slowly sinking into the haze of the city. He didn’t feel any better.
He closes the bag and turns to his brother nursing his beer, slouched over the laptop. The peace between them is always so fragile, that Sam hesitates before he asks. "Who's Superman?"
His phone is heavy in his palm, as he considers texting them. Saying what? That he went to bed? Big fucking news.
"Of course that's not what Cas wanted to say.“ Dean sat next to her on the couch. "You are strong, you are incredibly strong, but you don't have full control over yourself yet. Just think about what happened yesterday."
He feels bad about the things he told his brother. His apology was sincere, but that doesn't mean that he suddenly believes Dean. He is just trying to respect his decision. Which means he needs to act like Dean's jealousy and uneasiness around Cas isn't palpable.
The windshield wipers had been dividing the rain for so long. Sam had been silent in the passenger seat and Dean's thoughts wandered off.
"I can't believe what a smug hypocrite you've become, Sam." At least Dean was no longer trying to shove the door open. "So now I'm the bad influence and you're the amazing dad, huh?" Dean laughed. "You didn't even want her! First you tried to abort her and then you wanted to give her into the hands of strangers. And did you forget about the first weeks and the neglect?" He spit his words into Sam's face with contempt. "You wouldn't even have kept her if it wasn't for me! I was the one who built her bed! I was the one who drove her over the highway for hours at night, when she wouldn't fall asleep. That was all me and now you're trying to keep her from me, just because you and Cas have decided to erase me from this family?!”
The audacity to sit there and look at him with sad puppy eyes. As if that would make anything okay. As if him being sad and remorseful did fuck all for Dean.
"I’m not disinterested in your company! And I’m not angry, Cas. Far from it. I-" He thinks of repeating his lie, but decides against it. "You didn't do anything wrong. I still just need you to go right now. It’s not you, it’s... it's me." He realizes what that sounds like. "Everything’s fine," he hurries to add, aware of what a hollow statement it is. He takes out his phone and texts Dean.
The water pressure isn't the best but at least it's warm. He showers quickly. When he steps outside, Castiel sits on the bed, dripping all over the sheets, with his phone tucked to his ear.
Sorry it took me so long to update. This chapter was a bit of a monster to get through in editing and also I'm not really ready to let go off this story (the next chapter is the last...).
A pull went through his abdomen, as he thought that he hadn't seen any of them since Jessica's funeral. He'd had the feeling at the time, that at least some of her family members had turned sour against him. That they'd suspected him of having something to do with her death. He wondered what they might think of him now. Whether they ever gave a single bitter thought to him at all.
"Because I was clearly into you… Am… Because I am into you. You know that, right?" Castiel still seems a bit lost. Sam wonders if his words are still too ambiguous. "I want us to be more than friends."
Now Sam smiled meekly. He didn't believe him. He pulled his hand out of Castiel's and stood up. "Sorry, it was just a pretty horrible day. I didn't mean to lay this all onto you."
“Nah. Thanks for the offer, but I have to go. I have another-" He hesitated. Just a second, but he hesitated. "I got a date I need to get to."
She turned back to the raclette grill and turned over pieces of meat and vegetables that were roasting on the stone plate. It was amazing how quickly she managed to upset Sam. With short sentences, jabs, with little gestures. At same time he admired her wit and how she wouldn't ever let people fool her, especially not him.
"Let's just get out of here," Sam says and presses past Dean's shoulder and towards his side of the car.
He’d startled Dean, when he’d woken him up five minutes minutes just by looming over his bed and waiting.
Rain drizzles on Dean's shirt, but when he looks up he sees no signs of storm on the horizon. He turns around, when he hears the doors of the car slammed close.
While he didn't fight back before, he's struggling now, trying to shove Dean away and trying to get out words between the blood.
It's not even true: of course, this has to do with Castiel. If it were someone he cared less about, this wouldn't happen. Maybe, he thinks, hating the implication, it wouldn't happen if Castiel wasn't an angel. If there wasn't the silent knowledge of his strength, and the ease with which he would overpower Sam.
"Okay," Dean says, leaning his body completely towards Castiel's now. "What's coffee if not a drink then?"
She laughed again. "You underestimate the capabilities of your brothers and sisters. You cannot hide from us forever."
Charlie was wearing a black pants suit that made her look older and more serious. She smiled when she saw Dean approaching.
"It's the most important thing in the world," Dean says. "It doesn't matter how it comes about. Family is family. The one you're born into or the one you chose yourself. Like us. You, Sam, me? That's family."
"And that’s why you lure hunters into this dump to kill them?" Charlie shook her head. " Really sounds like you’re overthrowing the system. Congrats."
Castiel slowly pulled out of the embrace, his hands paused on Dean's side. His face was so close. Dean touched the side of it.
Castiel stepped closer. He put his arms around him from behind and leant his head against his back. The gesture seemed equally helpless.
He pictured Castiel with Charlie in his arms, saw him running a hand through Sam's hair and asking him not to cut it.
"Now what?" Dean looked at Cas. "Aren't you going to tell him about Charlie's grace and what it's going to mean for her? How it’s going to fuck her up because-"
"What, he heard us talk anyway." Dean shrugged and looked at Sam with a mixture of real pity and anger. "Don’t worry. I know my brother. He may be mad at you for a moment, but he's not gonna dwell on it. He's going to forgive you. He always forgives." He looked around indecisively for a moment. "I'll go look for Charlie. The way I know Sam, he'll probably want to drag her home any second now. As if any of this crap is her fault."
Sam wishes he had something more profound, something about the case and not his mouth hygiene. "You got a spare toothbrush for me?"
"I just don't want you to think-” Sam's fingers clawed their way into the jacket he was holding in his lap.
The thought of anyone holding a magnifier over his inner life terrifies him, but he does want someone to truly see him for what he really is.
Castiel slides a little closer on the desk to Sam. His leg touches Sam's knee now. He bends down a little, frames Sam's face with his hand. Sam closes his eyes without thinking.
The two teenagers are just where they left them. Dean stops next to them, while Sam and Castiel walk out of the basement. Dean and the boy and the girl all watch them leave. Dean is never any good at this. This is Sam's job. What are you even supposed to say to a girl who's just watched her possessed brother die?
He stands up. Castiel goes to move his legs, unsure where to. Like two strangers on a street trying to avoid running into each other they struggle to coordinate their movements, until Sam's legs bracket Castiel, and they're both still.
“Even if I thought that was true, which I don't do - so what? He made the wrong decision once, but he makes the right ones all the other times. He's always there for me. He's promised me that he would always protect me, that he would give his life for me if he needed to. There's not a lot of people who would do something like that for others, right?"
"Nothing, I guess. It was just weird when I woke up and you weren’t there. But you’re here now, so it’s all good."
"Work?" Sam huffs out a laugh. It's a surprise to both of them when Akiko speaks up. "What are you doing to them? And why?"
He tries to not take it out on them. He’ll leave them be and get drunk in his bed room with his headphones on, until he falls asleep. When that doesn’t work, he takes the Impala. He drives to some dive to be reminded that's there's a world out there that's bigger than the three of them.
Her radiant smile makes everything better, as long as he doesn't think about the impossibility of it all.
Of course Dean wants Cas back, too. More than anything really. But he can't say that he necessarily misses them.
"Well, not really. But LA is coming closer all the time and they bring the problems with them too. You can read about it all the time in the papers. The Bloods hate the Crips and all that jazz."
"Promise me you won’t do anything stupid while we’re gone," Sam said in quiet voice. His breath lifted a strand of his hair.
"You misunderstand me, Dean. I share a deep bond with you that gains me an access to your feelings in a way that I lack in regards to Sam."
He had spent so much time saving Sam from others, monsters and humans alike, but he'd neglected saving him from himself.
Charlie didn't want to leave, but she must have sensed the tension, because she only complained half-heartedly, and once they were back in Seattle, she went into her room without having to be asked.
»Me? You think I did this?« Bobby cough-choked on his words. »Do I look like I spent the night dragging a giant tree into the house? Am I the kind of guy to decorate?"
"So what is it - you're worried about me or you're angry that I didn't call you right away? I could handle it and I didn't need your distraction."
Dean nodded. They both didn’t mention that it had been so late, because Sam had planned to give Charlie away after the birth. Sam was probably thinking about it too.
"No, I’m not telling you what I’m thinking right now. I am in a bad mood and irritable. You want to  fight for some reason and I don’t want to. I just want to be happy for my daughter, okay? I really don’t need you trying to guilt trip me right now."
"What's the FBI doing here?" The startled rotund man in his 50s offers them some of his donuts anyway. Dean accepts and tells him why they're there.
"Come on," Sam said to Charlie. "We're going to clean you up, and I think you need a new shirt too."
Under other circumstances, Sam might have worried about his condition. He tried not to. He figured he was allowed to feel off. The wedding of your one and only daughter would be an emotional time for a lot of people, surely. Given their rather special family situation and his history of mental health struggles, it was probably not all that surprising that he felt so strange. He needed to cut himself some slack.
"What do you mean? Of course he left because of the case." Dean gives him a strange look. "Why else would I have suggested a meet-up with his feathery friends?"
Castiel wondered what the woman meant —did she really believe Castiel had the desire to be a dancer? The door opened and the children were spat out like a gush of sea water.
"Is it true that you have a daughter?" She didn't let Sam finish. Her hands were clenched into fists. "A new one, I mean. One you take to ballet classes? "
After the stuffy confinement of the bar, the air outside felt fresh and cool. He felt the oxygen flooding his lungs.
He can still remember a time when his hands didn’t look so weathered and permanently dirty. When they were only ever soiled by dusty textbooks and coffee stains.
He had lived through so much worse. He'd watched the destruction of entire cities, wars, the beginning of the apocalypse. In comparison, this was nothing: he was sitting in the waiting area of a dance study in the company of other parents waiting for a ballet class to end. There had been few other occasions in his life when forty-five minutes had seemed like such an eternity.
"I should have been keeping the greater picture in mind. Instead I was preoccupied with your brother’s well-being."
Dean shrugs. "Let’s go grab something to eat. I can’t hear myself think over the sound over my insides going all topsy-turvy." Before Sam can even open his mouth in protest, he adds: "I know you’re gonna say you’re not hungry. But you could definitely use a coffee. You almost fell asleep back there."
"Yeah, okay, whatever." Sam knits his eyebrows, looking at the table, and then nods. "Yeah. I know it was just that."
"Let us go inside," Castiel says. "It's cold and you should get some sleep. Dean said we'd leave early tomorrow."
"I know.” She tapped her fingers against her bony knees now. “Dad's been writing me all kinds of messages."
Sam takes up the menu and shoves it back towards the window. "Good," Sam says after a moment. "Me too."
"What?" Dean pushes his palm against Castiel's shoulder blade. Castiel doesn't even waver, but he looks annoyed. "You didn't think that was odd?" Dean asks. "You didn't think that was worth mentioning before? You know how absolutely insane that sounds?"
Dean knows he needs to talk to Castiel if he wants to have the least of an inkling of what's really going on in Sam's mind. He despises the fact that he's backed himself into a corner where he's playing second fiddle to both of them.
Charlie released a single sob. The feeling that spread inside him was darker and deeper than the Mariana Trench.
"As a matter of fact, she did." He smiles at Castiel. "If we find the nest tomorrow, you owe me, Cas."
"I’m sorry —my what?" Dean coughed, thinking he’d misheard, knowing he hadn’t. "My increased interest?"
It felt like someone was taking something away from him, pulling the carpet from under his feet. Dean knew that what was being taken from him was something he wasn’t entitled to in the first place. But being alone with Castiel had been... As much as he’d missed Sam, living with Castiel had felt right in its own way. And then, of course, there was the other thing. They had not talked about it properly for a long time, had just slipped into it like an old sweater and found it still fit. Why ruin what little happiness there was with discussions, Dean had figured. Only when Sam’s revival had come closer and closer, had they dared discussing what they were going to do.
"Well." She pulls her mouth downwards into an almost comical frown. "I found nothing. But I saw that three of them have the same address listed. And their cases were all recorded in the same few days."
Sam presses his lips together, just like he'd done last night when Lucifer had tried to kiss him the first time of many. Like he'd always done in hell before he'd eventually stopped fighting altogether.
"I don’t need to know the specifics," he says, a sudden harshness in his voice. It’s a confusing emotional whiplash.
"You knew you were going to practice shooting, when you told us you were going out to eat. You knew Sam wouldn't approve and so you deliberately concealed it. This is the same as a lie.”
"I don't know, man. These people." He waves at the house. "They kind of got to me. I feel like... whatever did this, we need to find it and kill it."
After they'd finished the pizza, Charlie threw a meaningful glance at Dean. "You're really lucky it's a Sunday. It's the only day we get dessert."
Castiel will revert back to being disgusted, to keeping a distance from Sam, as far away as possible as staying close to Dean will allow him.
The therapist starts moving around the room; Sam's hand glides towards the gun without thinking about it. He lets go of it once more when she sits down in her armchair. She stares into the air, and runs a finger over the flower pattern.
Dinner wasn’t any less strained. Dean’s happiness about Sam’s return was overshadowed every time he took a look at Sam and Cas sitting side by side. He couldn’t even say whether it was more jealousy or a guilty conscience.
He can still see Sam’s scrunched up face, when he’d come down from his weird trip and Dean had told him Castiel would be gone for, well, a few days maybe, who knows.
It's difficult to look at Sam when he's like this. The muscles in his face moving uneasily, his mouth twitching. He looks fucking miserable and Dean can't stand it.
Dean skims the sidewalk, considers the logo for a moment. The white letters spelling out "Daily Grind" over the door. The whimsical half-ironic cup of coffee with white lines of steam on the chalkboard.
"We can help you. We would help you, you know that, right? That’s what Dean’s nagging is all about. He’s worried about you and wants to make sure you’re safe."
"Dean, you can get sick from all kinds of things. And I didn't tell Charlie because I didn't want her to worry. I just wanted to spend a few days with her and Cas." He shook his head. "I wanted to make things right between me and her. But well..." He sighed an almost inaudible sigh. "She ran off to you."
"I know that the situation is complicated,” Castiel offered. “And I understand that you don't have very positive feelings towards me, and would rather not spend more time with me than necessary. I won't ask you to reconsider your feelings for me, but for Charlie's sake. Is it not the most important thing that we can brush aside these kinds of self-interests to focus on our daughter's welfare? Don't punish her for the mistakes I have made."
Dean looks happy as a clam as he dips three fries into his milkshake and pushes them into his mouth. He moans so loudly, that Sam takes a look around to figure out how embarrassed he needs to be. "You sure you guys don't want any?"
"I’m sorry I messed up. I don’t understand it myself. It was a measly ghost. It should have been very easy to fight. I was just taken by surprise, and she was just-"
As if to prove his point, Dean had held a handful of snow in front of his own face, sniffed at it and licked it with the tip of his tongue.
The only sound that remains that isn’t him is the soft wind rattling through the surrounding corn fields.
Anger is just no good for him. And anger right now is not justified. Probably not directed at Dean (he can’t expect him to tone down their friendship, can he?), but definitely not directed at Cas. He settles for being angry with himself.
"That she is too young to marry? That she should find herself some more and experiment with other people before settling down with her first boyfriend?" Castiel shrugged, which felt odd when lying down. "In general, in the United States, the marriageable age is eighteen years, Nebraska and Mississippi being the exception. Since we are in California, it is legal for her to wed." He turned his face toward Sam’s. "Statistically speaking, young marriages don’t last as long, but they are supposed to be happier and more stable, and Charlie is not an ordinary woman, so I think —"
It's still true that he would have felt bad either way. A split would have been messy and complicated. And it's not like it would have meant anything for himself and Castiel. It's not like he would have tried to put a move on him. He wouldn't do that to Sam.
It doesn’t feel like it’s working now, Dean concludes. He tries to shift his focus on the task at hand, but the words in the book before him seem like nothing but esoteric-sounding mumbo jumbo. Nothing that will help them with their current case.
Sam and him had agreed that he would bring her back in the morning. It was now three in the afternoon. He knew he was driving slowly on purpose.
"What?" Dean finally took off his jacket completely and put it over his arm. "What was what all about?"
There's white light and when Castiel is finished the thing below him goes limp and then turns into ash. It’s weird and not what he expected, but it beats feeling Castiel's corpse under his body.
Dean felt that even though he was the one who had asked the question in the first place, they’d both forgotten about him. "Have you all had breakfast yet?" he asked.
"Yeah, sure," Dean nods. Of course, she doesn’t understand why Castiel is so eager to get to Sam. "To be honest, I could do with some shut-eye, too."
"And still I’m nicer to you than you are. Let that sink in for a second. I understand you, Sam. I know you. Like none of them ever will. Well." He pauses, as if he’s waiting for Sam to argue back. "You know your brother doesn’t understand you. You know my brother’s not going to be there for you much longer, either. Once the whole bromance thing between him and Dean gets taken up a notch. He pities you, sure, but how long is that going to last? You think you can squeeze a few more months out of this? But me? I’m always here."
"No. His memories were never gone," Castiel says. "Even when I took on Sam's madness, he always remembered what happened. It just didn't affect him in the same way."
"Here you are," he said and looked around. "I know it’s silly that I haven’t let her clear everything away yet. I just needed a little more time."
"So, what’s up?" Sam noticed how rude his urgency must have sounded so he added: "Sure you don't want to come up for a bit?"
"If you think about it," Dean says, throwing his jacket on one of the beds with a flowery throw, "it's absurd that we have to pay for the room ourselves. We should be compensated for that bullshit ghost hunt."
"He said he'd tell me once we're there." She had now turned to Dean. Tears swam in her eyes. "They're at Seattle Grace Hospital."
His eyelids are heavy but he doesn't want to close them. He knows what happens every time he lets himself drift off. He hasn't slept more than 10 hours in total in the past six nights. But that's still plenty of time for dreaming.
For a few seconds it was like the world held its breath. Nothing happened. Dean beside him stood as frozen as him. Both the man in front of Charlie and the werewolf girl screamed. Then Charlie let go and as soon as the light appeared, it was gone again. All that remained was a disoriented teenager who stumbled towards the table with uncertain steps.
He could tell Dean was debating whether to go on or not. "I’d still find it odd if my daughter tried to iron out my own life by re-enacting the perfect version of it."
She pulls back but keeps her hands on his arms. She eyes him suspiciously. "I'll be the judge of that."
Dean's overeagerness to get him out of bed, to cook him food and act like an all-around mother hen suddenly makes a lot more sense.
"We were teenagers," Sam says. He has no reason to be embarrassed, but he is. Even more so because they're doing this with Dean around.
It was late in the evening and Dean had only meant to go to the bathroom. He couldn’t explain to himself why he took the other door instead, the one to the former small guest room. It was probably his typical masochistic behavior. The room looked very different from what he remembered, as if it didn’t belong to the apartment at all. Even though it was already dark, the light falling through the crack of the door was enough to highlight the yellow of the walls and the small cot. He took a step inside and was surprised to see he wasn’t alone.
Just as he was about to turn to the fridge for a beer, he heard the knock again. Maybe the receptionist wanted to ask something, or a drunk had mixed up the rooms.
He held her hand while they waited for Sam, who went to the bookstore. He was glad Sam hadn't mentioned the topic anymore. He'd not mentioned any of the topics that had opened up like a molehill in a garden between them today.
“You know what? I can't stand to watch this any longer." Dean walks over to the counter and opens the bread box. "This is where the bread goes," he tells Castiel. "You know, the letters spelling out 'bread' on there are kind of a giveaway."
"You know I've never actually been with him for any significant amount of time without you around?" Sam looks pensive. "Isn't that weird? You're so integral to us that the thought of being on my own with him is…" He clears his throat.
"Well, I wouldn't know that, would I? Unless you told me what you meant by it." Sam tries to keep his forehead free of lines, and a neutral expression on his face.
Dean drops his gaze. He needs to start avoiding this kind of situations. He can't afford anything else if he wants to keep up this semi-friendly accord with both Sam and Castiel. He's been working so hard to keep his feelings in check. He's doing too well for a nice word and a whiff of Cas' scent to throw him off.
They had anticipated this moment for so long, but the wait today felt different and more acute. What if something had gone wrong after all?
Sam presses Cas' cold hand closer to his cheek, unravels the fingers one by one until they’re starfished over his face.
"I'm sorry about last night," Sam says. The words already feel inadequate. "I didn’t want to fight. But you should have told me you were getting weaker because of me."
"Who?" Castiel asks, frowning. "I am quite certain Dean would react even less enthusiastically than you. Who else would I ask?"
"Whoa," Jody's eyes big, as she puts her hands up. "Easy there. I'll leave you brooding in your man pain, and go get lunch ready, if that's what you want. But it seemed like you needed someone to talk to."
"It's not like that," Sam says defensively, but then his voice drops to barely a whisper. "It's not like that at all."
It does take some courage still, when he can feel Dean’s eyes on them, but he puts his hand on top of Cas’.
He should probably be bothered by the fact that it’s the both of them, and only the both of them, he thinks of, when he tries to fish for happiness in the sea of dreck inside his mind.
"Are you really still pissed that I killed two of your monster girlfriends? Is this it? Are you ever going to let that go?"
Dean’s fingers are nibbling away on the paper label on his bottle, trying not to look up. But eventually he does. Castiel is looking at him intently, clearly weighing his words. He takes everything so damn serious, just like he takes every question literally. Dean has always found it endearing and funny, when he’s not annoyed by it.
Dean watches his brother perform. He knows the telltales by heart, but normally, it doesn't get him so angry.
"They started screaming at each other. They brought up all kinds of stuff, half of which I didn't know shit about, because I wasn't there when they'd taken place. And Dad kept saying how Dean wasn't half a good hunter as he thought he was. Dean, on the other hand, kept telling Dad to stop treating him like a child, when he wasn't. I remember... he said 'If I'm old enough to save your goddamn life, why am I not old enough to-?' And I have no idea what he was going to say next, because that's when John smacked him. It was the first time I ever saw him hit Dean. The way they stared at each other after. Dean was clearly angry but there was no surprise at all. So I figured this wasn't new."
Blue Eyes wants to drive back to his place, but the thought that this might be a trap lurks in the back of Dean's mind. And he's not quite sure what exactly it is he's looking for, but it's not that. He's even less interested in long discussions about logistics, so he simply walks off towards the back of the bar and expects to be followed.
"I don’t think I imagined anything. I don’t know. I was always living from one day to the next, I guess." He laughed. "That sounds like something from a yoga calendar. I don’t mean it in a meditative way. It was more like: I didn’t make any plans because they wouldn’t have worked anyway and then I would have been disappointed."
Castiel waits for him, and Sam leads them into his room. They stand in front of the bed. It is awkward, as these moments still tend to be. It feels more like work than it should. They both know where this is supposed to lead, but the segue seems big and artificial. Sam can't just switch it on and off. It reminds him of how he used to feel as a child about travelling and riding in the car for hours. How much he hated the state in between. He didn't mind changing from place A to B, he minded what happened on the way. Just like then, he just wants to fast forward, to when his mind isn't half on Dean anymore, and police stats and death counts aren't at the back of his head. He knows where he wants to get to but getting there seems an immense task right about now.
Sam feels grateful. Then he thinks of all the unanswered messages Jody's sent him. "Sorry I never got back to you. I was just… busy. I know that's a horrible excuse."
"Daddy!" She let go of Dean's hand and ran towards Sam as if she hadn't seen him for weeks. "I love you so much."
Last night was on him, all on him. Not telling Jody the truth, spiralling, knowing he was spiralling and not stopping it. The way he kept ignoring the sensible part of his brain that told him to just ask Castiel to stay, and once that was too late, to talk with Jody instead. Even the things that happened after the Ambien he could have stopped.
Next to him in the booth Castiel is reading a newspaper. He rustles the paper with a slight frown on his forehead. He has the stern concentration, rigid posture and old-fashionedness of a Victorian gentleman. Sam is only a little surprised that this is doing it for him.
Her eyes grow big in a mixture of surprise and disbelief. She perks up and seems to grow a bit younger. "You’re really FBI? I thought you were joking! I mean, Grohl and Cobain - really?"
A specimen of the sort sits beside his desk. A pencil-pusher who thinks he's God's gift to humanity who keeps Dean from seeing the body. He is half-way tempted to smack the guy and get it over with. Force himself in. Instead he asks to see a supervisor. But of course, no dice.
"They’re not after me, Dean," Castiel snaps. "They weren’t after me in the first place. They just saw an opportunity when I was foolish enough to seek out their help."
Other people confuse him with their intentions and expectations and their contradictions. It's so easy to disappoint people who think you could do better. That you could be a better version of yourself if you only tried hard enough.
"Okay?" She follows him. "That's not the kind of reaction I was expecting. You don't sound surprised."
"What is that supposed to mean?" Castiel's voice is low and strained, as he presses forward into Dean's space. "Dean," he demands. "What is that supposed to mean?"
"Charlie is really talented, and shows a lot of progress, especially considering that she’s only been with us for such a short amount of time."
"No, of course not. It’s rather the way she deals with the other children.” She sighed and her body tension revealed her nervousness. "She's not really a part of the group and it seems like it doesn't even bother her."
Sam's jaw tenses. He knows that Dean is trying to bait him, he just doesn't know why he's doing it. And knowing that he's trying to get a rise out of him doesn't mean it's not working.
"Oh, someone is out looking for danger. Pretty brave words for such an old man." This time she caught him by the shirt. He laughed, but Cas could tell that Dean was irritated that his reflexes had let him down. Dean was still attractive. The aging process had been gentle with him - a miracle considering his lifestyle - but the fact that he was older had become visible. There were silver streaks in his dark blond hair and the lines around his eyes had deepened. Sam’s body had also aged, although much less thanks to the magic involved in his resurrection. Castiel hated to dwell on this topic, so he quickly pushed the thought aside.
"Jesus!" Dean rolled his eyes. "Cas, you don’t have to explain the same shit to him all over again. He’s just not going to get it."
"That’s not saying much." Sam shuts the laptop, visibly flustered. "You don’t really know that many people well."
To his surprise, Castiel's face darkened. He stood up. "No, Dean. That is not enough. I can speak with whoever I want, in whatever language I want. If you can give me a good reason why I shouldn’t, I am always ready to reconsider. But I don't obey your every order.”
"Or that." The smile on her face dies. "God, that's not really half as helpful as I thought it'd be."
Castiel turns the light off and returns to sitting on Dean’s bed, his trench coat still fast around his body.
"I’m not accusing him of anything. But you know what heaven is like! You know how they are. Sam fathered a damn nephilim. Isn't that still a cardinal sin? How should I know if that gets him a place in hell or not?"
Sam knows he’s trying extra hard because of the guilt. He shouldn’t have gone off like this and shouldn’t have accused Dean of lying yet again. Most of all, he shouldn’t still be feeling these twinges of doubt.
Even if Dean wasn't running on adrenaline and urgency, he'd still want to leave this place asap. It just makes him feel bad.
Castiel had been surprised by just how much Sam disapproved of the idea of Dean and Charlie spending a lot more time just the two of them. It had been Charlie's wish and Castiel had quickly seen that it could only be good for the bunker’s household blessing.
"You don't," Dean exhales, "you don't actually miss him or anything like that? Please tell me it's nothing weird like that."
Bobby nursed quite the hangover when they said their goodbyes. As soon as he let go of Dean's shoulder, he put his hand against his own forehead. He tried to massage the headache away.
Sam has no idea what memory he’s referring to, but he clasps his left hand around Castiel’s and puts his right hand on the angel’s shoulder.
"No, you're right. I mean, they are probably fine but still." He rubs his fingers over his eyes, trying to think. "Okay, say you're right, and she gets activated by the therapy somehow. If it's not the therapist, it could be someone near her. Her family, her friends…"
Although his body didn't need to sleep, he liked lying next to Sam and watching his chest rise and fall. He enjoyed the feeling that in those moments nothing but the two of them existed, and that nothing of the outside world – not Charlie, no angels and not even Dean - could interfere in their very own cosmos.
"It's true that the situation makes me feel a bit uncomfortable," Castiel says, as Sam skims the article. "You told me you feel ready to hunt again, and I can sense that you are very eager to."
"You still have a lot to learn about people, I guess. Yeah, it is a foundation and they do accept one social case per year, but ninety percent of the schoolchildren are just smart and coincidentally happen to be rich.”
"How nice to see you again!" Beth hugged them both, a spatula in hand. "I tried my luck with a pasta bake," she explained. "If you have children, the first thing you learn is that you should always have pasta in the house. Come on in." She pointed to the hallway. "Castiel is already here, he's with Garth in the living room."
"My shoulder, I think," Dean admits, because it's pointless to deny it. "I don't think it's a big deal. Just didn't want Sam to worry."
He sighs deeply, wishing he’d have started a conversation about the case instead. Or anything but this. But it’s difficult to ignore what’s at the forefront of your mind.
Sam smiles. "Thanks," he says. When he moves his hand over the table, Castiel understands and does the same.
"I know. There wasn’t. Besides, I thought you guys might appreciate some time alone." He unwraps the burger, then looks up at Cas. "Sorry, man." His eyes go soft. "I’m just tired and frustrated. I hate when things aren’t going as straightforward as I want them to. I thought we’d quickly gank a ghost and get out of here. And now everything we’ve got is vague as hell. I wasn’t even sure what I was supposed to be looking for!"
—You’d think that song was written about us. I mean, it is written about me, I guess. You’re not worth a footnote in music history of course. Hey —you know they’ve written whole rock operas about me? It’s not really my kind of thing, though, human music is so fucking banal. But it’s a nice gesture."
"You looked at me the same way this morning," Castiel admits, almost sheepish, which seems absurd, as he tears his hand away. Sam wishes he wouldn't. Wishes he'd take control instead.
"You know where the bathroom is, right?" She asks, then remembers earlier. "Oh, right, I know you do."
"Yes, it did.” Dean pretended to think hard for a moment. "Okay, riddle me this, Einstein: When you bang your head, how exactly do you end up in bed together? Cause you’ve hurt your head plenty of times when I was around and it sure never lead to us getting this cozy. You wanna tell me you had to put your hand on his knee like that?"
“Garth and Beth are currently mobilizing their werewolf friends to look for possible clues where he might have taken them. A werewolf can follow a trail better than a police dog. It shouldn't take too long."
Sam draws his eyes together and leans back into the seat, the enthusiasm slowly waning from his face.
? It means ‘forever and ever’. It is not an exact translation. You say it when, well- it’s hard to explain."
"You told me I'd ruined your life. You never wanted to see me again and I should never show my face again. You said you hated me." Castiel had stepped up to him. "Is that true?"
"Why are you staring at me like that?" Dean asked. He got up and brushed imaginary dust off his jeans.
"It was Vetalas, nasty almost snake-like suckers. They had Sam and it was kind of touch and go for a while, but once we knew where they had him, I knew we could handle them. It's fine now, Jody, really." He tries for a smile. "We do that kind of thing all the time. We're still here."
"She was just such a wonderful girl", the mother repeats again and again, while she tugs on her white blouse. Everything else she’s wearing is black. She’d probably attractive when she’s not grieving. "Who would do something like that?"
For a moment, they just look at each other, waiting. Castiel's eyes are friendly but with a certain undermined blankness to them, that let Sam know it's true: he would be fine with anything now. He probably wouldn't mind if he suggested a game of chess instead of this.
"Yes, she’s probably just homesick. Apparently she got into a big fight with Lila." He shrugged. "You know how children are."
He couldn’t breathe. Gargling, he spat dark blood onto the floor as the witch repeated the spell, her hands whirling in the air.
"He's just..." Sam pauses and clears his throat. "There's just this strange feeling of familiarity to it, to him. I mean, even on a normal day, sometimes there'll be stuff that reminds me of him, really innocuous things most of the time, or maybe I'll hear a song and I'll get this feeling..."
Charlie’s face slipped for a brief moment. Castiel wondered what the other people around them who witnessed the argument had to think. Then Charlie had caught herself again. He could tell from her eyes that she was now ready to counterattack.
"And nothing." Dean shrugs. "I wanted to wait until I knew for sure you'd be safe, but-" He holds his beer up. "I kind of realized now that's probably just not going to happen." He sighs. "You were right. We're never safe. And I trust you to let us know when something changes. If you see him again, stuff like that."
"Dean and I have been looking for her since heaven took her. But –" He looked even more tired now. "It was like she didn't want to be found and she learned her hiding skills from the best hunter in the world." He smiled briefly and then got serious again. "She was following her own plan all along. Now she has rebelled against heaven and they are all looking for her."
»Nothing. None, I mean.« He straightened up and cleared his throat. »Everything's fine. I'm just a bit tired. Didn't get a lot of sleep last night.«
In short: he gets how Castiel could be his one thing. But this fake Cas today? It wasn’t there for him.
When she's asking for his number, slurring all the words, he's already walking away, not even taking a second look at her.
He breathes a sigh of relief when Jody lets go completely. A moment longer and he might have folded. "Get your ass onto that chair," she orders. "You need to eat something."
»No...« Sam pushed his face closer to the crack between door and doorframe, to hear Dean's soft voice. »No. That's not what I meant. I don't... I don't want you to go...«
The canvas was still black and the small bulbs on the side of the room were still on, its dim light throwing shadows onto Sam's face.
There's a short pause. Sam shuffles his feet. A car passes, the white light blinds him for a moment. "I'll let you know when we know more, all right?" he asks.
He always gets uneasy when Sam’s like this. He’s got that cold and determined look in his eyes that reminds him of soulless Sam.
For a moment, Dean believed Sam would talk back. He opened his lips again, but then he shook his head and pointed to tote back. "I'll leave you the pie."
Dean motions over the table. "All of it. All of my fucking life devoted to you. And you don't even trust me." He exhales sharply. "Hell, sometimes I don't even know if you
Castiel's smile is honest but Sam is pretty sure his words aren't true. He knows Castiel would prefer helping Dean instead of him, but something's holding him back and Sam is not about to mention it now.
He considered what he could say or do. Take her in his arms and tell her time would heal all her wounds.
Sam looked into his glass. He felt far too big and was acutely aware of the how much space he was taking up on the sofa. "He's here with me."
"Dean doesn't live in the bunker anymore. He travels through the country. Hunting monsters and saving people."
"What crawled up your ass and died?" Charlie looked at him disapprovingly. "Okay, so then I decide: We’re going to the police station."
Sam drinks some coffee before he goes on. "We can obviously rule out the Horsemen, seeing as they don't have any powers anymore. Crossroads demons seem unlikely from the way things went down. Same for ghosts. Djinns are out of question. I considered that the vics might be missing their soul - but your barkeeper said he felt completely normal, right?"
The angels had finished their Twinkies and stared first at the wrappers in their hands and then at Charlie, as if they were watching a particularly exciting boxing match on TV.
"Well, that’s a problem," Dean says. "We can’t have you walking around like an easy target. You could have died."
"Maybe we shouldn't have just gone and watched whatever. Normally they show more upbeat stuff. I thought it was always more of a retrospective thing, I didn’t know they did country themes sometimes." Castiel’s face is blank, so Sam continues. "To be honest I’ve only been there a few times before. It’s not like I have time to go to the movies all the time. It’s more of a thing I always think of doing. Like picking up a book to read."
Castiel stretched out his hand and made a move towards him. Then he froze, thinking better of it, and lowered his arm. He stood stiff as a board. "Dean. All I’m asking you is not to make the situation more complicated for all of us than it already is."
"Never met them before." He wets his dry throat with beer. "Anyway, how was your day?" he asks before Sam can question him any further.
"Look, Dean," Sam says quietly. "I know you're angry and you don't trust me right now, but I swear I'll make it up to you. I just don't know how. Just tell me what you want me to do, I'll do it."
Sam doesn't reply. He's not sure what he expected to hear, but not this. Castiel turns onto his side. "Is that not an appropriate destination for a trip?" he asks.
"It doesn’t matter really, but I have only ever danced with women before. So this here feels weird. I’m just not used to it. I don’t even know where to put my hands."
When Charlie walked back into the kitchen, she had exchanged her dress for a pair of jeans and a dark blue sweatshirt.
Not one day passed without Sam wondering how he’d ended up here and if he could have done anything to prevent the deep metaphorical rift that had opened up between himself and Dean. Still, he was relieved he at least didn't have to lie to him anymore. All the words had been said, all the curses cast, only time alone would tell if they would be able to survive this conflict or if they would fall apart.
"What were you thinking?" he asked and loosened the hold on her to look at her face. "If you trigger the alarm then we will... then the whole evening will..."
It had never been a fool-proof system, but it had been working as long as everything stayed the same.
Him falling for Cas is one thing. Unexpected at first, maybe, but the more Sam thinks about it, the more it seems almost inevitable. In fact, he finds it more surprising that it took him this long. He wonders if it’s the physical proximity and the touch that flipped a switch. Or if it was mostly the time Castiel was gone, the fear for his life, that broadened the feelings of companionship and deep gratitude, that muddled up everything, until he eventually found himself undeniably in love.
Sam huffed, and re-folded Charlie’s sweater. "Yeah, that’s why you brought two cases of beer last time, but forgot Charlie’s vitamins."
Sam turns the can in his hands. Then he drags his thumb over the opening, all around the sharp metal.
Dean feels like shit, watching him push the door upon and walk outside, to the car where Castiel is waiting.
"If Sam had left with Charlie back when she was born-” Castiel was still holding onto him. "Would you have stayed here?"
Sam stands up and grabs his bag. He shakes her hand, and tries not to stare at her naked dusty feet, as she tells him to make a second appointment, to be conducted via telephone this time. He says he'll think about it. He ignores the receptionist calling behind him at first and walks faster until her words register. "Sir? Your shoes!"
No. Stop. He wasn't going to go over the whole thing in his head yet again. He wasn't going think about every little thing that had happened, trying to figure out who had fucked up where. There was no use in pondering at what point exactly everything had started going down the drain. And what use was it, even if he did manage to figure out a tipping point.
He's just unscrewed the top, when he hears Sam clearing his throat behind him, and decides to grab a glass after all. He sits down at the kitchen table and motions towards the rum, knowing Sam will shake his head.
He breathed heavily. His heart was racing. The strong pounding in his forehead still kept the repentance at bay, which always followed his emotional outbursts. But it would set in soon.
When Dean opens the door to the basement, he hears voices. Sam has the demon knife, so Dean hopes he's hearing humans. He releases the safety and takes careful sideway steps down the wooden planks. The voices are high-pitched, more than two at least —and they're fighting. The basement's so large they don't notice him even when he's reached the last step, from where he can watch them in relative obscurity.
"Vetalas," Dean explains. Then he remembers how Sam's last encounter with these creatures went. "Shit." He turns around. Castiel doesn't move an inch. Face to face and this close, the fear in Castiel's eyes is hard to miss.
It was probably because the witch had robbed him of his last strength and he felt terribly human, but in this very moment he felt the pain and the lack of his family even more than usual.
Back in the library, Dean was sitting on the couch now, his hand clutching a glass of whisky. The surprising meekness in his eyes made it clear he felt guilty – yet the sight angered Castiel. And now that he knew Charlie was safe and soundly asleep, he let the anger take control.
"That's not how I meant it at all. It’s nothing like that. It’s just… it’s nice to forget how broken I am for a moment, I guess. It’s similar in that respect."
"And what’s that? What is it really like? You think talking about self-loathing is gonna help you out of this?"
He's very aware of his almost nakedness. When he considers Castiel's strangely crouching position over his now wilting erection, he too looks vulnerable. Sam regrets aborting this. If they'd just continued, if he’d not freaked out over nothing, there'd been no need to make a big deal out of it.
He wonders if he's watching the same water trail or if he's seeing something else. If he's admiring the perfect soft curves of statuesque muscles. Or if he's above these mundane physical needs. If he's merely turning all his attention to Sam the person, not Sam the body.
"That’s why you’re so pissed?" He finally asks, in a calm voice. "Well, you got your panties in a twist for nothing. It didn’t appear as Cas to me."
»We need to be standing right under that thing for it to work« Sam heard his brother say. »I am a bit drunk...«
The doorbell caused Castiel to stop. Sam got up automatically. He glanced at the clock. It was almost eleven. Maybe someone had rung by accident.
It was quiet again. This time Dean was the one who stirred his cup, although the coffee powder had long dissolved.
"I know you said you didn’t want to talk about it. But… I think Cas is a bit confused by your behavior, you know." Sam’s voice sounds tight as well. "And to be honest, so am I."
Akiko gives him a look of pity and sympathy. It must be obvious to her that he's not on the top of his game.
"Unless you were hoping for this, of course. You don’t even want to be on your own right now, do you? You prefer my company."
Sam rubs over his forehead. It's a lead so thin it's barely there, but he's grateful for the suggestion. It's somewhere to start. He's thankful for the way she talks to him too, rational and logical and yet understanding the urgency.
It seemed like he wanted to say something more, but then he caught Sam's eye. He took a step back from Castiel. »Sammy, you haven't touched your presents yet.«
"I miss him too. But that doesn't change the fact that it's better if we don't see each other right now. It's just until he's not so angry anymore."
"Okay. So then you didn't tell him, but you knew that I was training her and you knew I hadn't stopped. So what's with all this fake surprise now? I'm sorry that she got hurt. You know I am. But getting hurt is part of learning how to fight.”
"She’s not hitting on me," Sam mumbles and turns on the radio. He immediately wants to turn it off again, but Dean shoves his hand away. You don’t disrespect Nazareth like that.
It’s not like they haven’t met intrusive monsters and demons before who’d flirted and groped and overstepped boundaries. This wasn’t that.
"What did you do to them?" Sam asks, and despite the illogicality of the movement, he steps closer, gun cocked. She smiles at him, a genuine and somewhat pitying smile. "I don't do anything to them. I only let them be themselves."
"Dean wasn’t home most of the time," Sam said. "He was hunting a lot. And later when we lived apart… Well, I was the one who did most of the cooking, either way."
"Feels like crap, doesn't it?" Dean thought, but then he nodded and let Sam step inside. "I saw some instant coffee lying around here somewhere. You want some?"
It would hurt. His body crashing into the pavement, his bones breaking. If he fell just right, with all the pressure on his head maybe, it could be a quick death.
"Is it something I did?" Castiel asks. Sam thinks back to the therapy session. Whatever she is, all the talk of honesty is getting to him. Castiel keeps his eyes on him.
Then, without another word, Castiel is gone and Sam is alone on the sidewalk, staring into thin air.
Besides, Dean had to admit it was a relief to have someone around who didn't look at him with that damned disappointment in his eyes all the time.
Sam felt helpless. He wouldn't be able to fight or protect himself if she attacked him. He was nothing more than a soul, unarmed and naked. But she didn't even move a musclel.
"Right." Sam looked up at the bunker ceiling. "Because not fighting and things being harmonious are the same. Just look at me and Dean.”
Castiel's fingers slipped over the back of his head, almost like a scalp massage. Sam suppressed a sigh, and the need to move closer. He knew how starved he was for touches that weren't hugs from his daughter. He told himself this was normal, and the closeness was fine, after all this was part of the healing process. More or less.
"Yeah, well.” Dean cleared his throat, and nodded at Charlie. "This one didn't really leave me much of a choice. Sorry we're a little later than I said we'd be."
Sam pushed back his chair, got up and disappeared into the kitchen. When he came back he brought out a pie on a porcelain plate. "This is so much better than the crap they sell you at the gas station."
Sam ducks ever so slightly, letting his hair fall over his eyes, while he slurps up the remainder of the coffee, leaving only the ice cubes in the glass. When he sits up and pushes the strands of hair out of his eyes, Dean immediately notices the conspicuous pink blotches on his cheeks.
"I'd just feel a lot better if we knew for sure that he was in heaven living through a Best Of of his memories than, well, burning in hell."
"Hey Sam,” Dean said, his voice rough and his face flushed. He ran a hand through his hair, visibly uncomfortable.
He started to speak, but at that moment the door opened and Charlie came in with a book under her arm.
"She still has afternoon classes today. We can get her on our way back." Sam smiled. "She'll be so thrilled to see you."
Dean grips the steering wheel tightly. The edge in Sam's voice is weird. Why is he so hung up about that woman?
"What?" she asked, probably irritated by the look on Dean's face. “You don't know what he's like! He doesn't respect me, he doesn't accept my opinion. He always wants to boss me around, change me, and - hey, why are you smiling? Do you think that's funny? ”
Castiel put a hand to his shoulder, but he too kept quiet, and eventually he left the kitchen for Sam’s room.
"Well, I didn't really think it would be bleeding. It was more the force of the blow. I think I'll just have to live with a headache for a bit."
How would that work. The thing could have hardly turned into the embodied concept of nothingness for him.
Castiel folds up the paper, expecting something more interesting from the brothers than the grand new opening of a butcher on 5th Street.
"That's just… Life with Dean," Sam says. "When he cares about you, he puts you on a pedestal. He creates this perfect version of you in his head, one that's impossible to actually live up to. So you start feeling bad because you're bound to disappoint."
Okay, so the two of them did get into a fight. But that lasted like, what, 5 minutes tops? And that was it. Now Sam's all smiles again.
Sam checks the time on his laptop, it's not even midnight yet. A little irritated, he looks up at Castiel, who glances back in serenity. Then he strokes his thumb over Sam's hand, gentle but filled with meaning.
When Castiel reached the bottom of the spiral staircase, he noticed the voices. He recognized Dean and Sam, but there was a third, female voice. He opened the door to the meeting room and analyzed the situation. Sam's gaze, which met his in the middle of the room, was soft and apologetic. Dean's unapproachable and distant, as it so often was lately. His silent companion, the glass of whiskey, was already in his hand. What time was it, five in the afternoon?
"Fate has a strange sense of humor. I didn’t want a child at the time and had her and she --" He broke off. "I always thought that at some point I’d have to console her for accidentally triggering an apocalypse or something like that. I have experience with that, I get that kind of thing. But this?" He picked up the toy again. "This overwhelms me."
"Sam has felt stressed and unwell before, many times, without this particular hallucination occurring. At least, not to my knowledge."
"No, I'm not angry." Castiel shakes his head. "At the most, I'm a little frustrated that your mood is so intrinsically linked to your brother. Not that it should come as a surprise to me by now."
"I know that you loved him," Dean repeated. "But you've really gone off the rails if you think you can tell me something about what kind of person Sam was. I know him better than anyone. I know him better than I know myself."
"That's what they say anyway." She pulls her hair into a high ponytail. "You did save the world a bunch of times, didn't you?"
"Yeah, maybe." Sam scraps a piece of blueberry skin of the back of his front tooth with his tongue, its texture almost paper-like. "But you knowing me better than Dean is still a little weird to me, I guess."
"I don’t know about amazing." Sam shrugged. "But I guess on a theoretical level it is quite fascinating."
"That's Sam for you, always one step ahead." He should hold his tongue, but so far Castiel simply ignores the edge to his voice. "Look man, you don't need to prove your usefulness to us."
He doesn’t mean to, but the first thing he’s been doing the past days upon waking, even before opening is eyes, is to extend his arms and feel around for another body. Each time he forgets, and each time anew it feels like something is crushing his lungs.
"Did you knock her out?” Sam asked, not looking up to even make sure who it was. He had no illusions about Dean following him.
Sam looks over at Castiel and then at Dean again. Maybe it's some secret code to Castiel, or he just figures that Sam needs help on his own, because he immediately walks around the bed and comes to stand next to Sam. Right next to him. He's so much in Sam's space that any sane person, relationship or not, would take a step to the side.
"Because I'm not an idiot? I haven't killed any of them yet. The cafeteria guy was a mistake." He shakes his head. "But I don't really want to talk about that. I'm curious about some things myself. The famous Dean Winchester, who would have thought that-"
Castiel stood in the hallway and looked at him, an unreadable expression on his face and with no indication of recognition of the sheer absurdity of the situation. As if they'd only seen each other yesterday. As if he hadn't disappeared without a trace and been gone for months.
Castiel shook his head. "It’s not what you think. I can’t imagine it would suit you or your brother’s interests."
Okay, that’s clearly bullshit. That’s something Dean would hardly allow himself to think, let alone say out loud.
Castiel and Dean both watch him storm out a second time. She picks up the phone after one ring. "Hello?" she asks, sounding small.
I know it's been a while, but I haven't forgotten about this story - I just had massive writer's block. If someone's still reading, be assured, I'm determined to finish this. Comments & thoughts are always greatly appreciated.
For the past two weeks, they've been working a confusing case. Dean's pretty sure they're after a rather clever group of shape shifters, but Cas insists that despite their ability to change their bodies, it’s something else. Whoever is right, they all have no freaking clue how to catch them anyway.
When he came out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist, his skin crimson and raw from the hot water, he heard voices coming from the kitchen.
Charlie had fallen asleep. Her chest rose and fell evenly. Sam wondered if it wasn't enough to just wipe her down with a wet towel. She could take her bath the next day. It didn't really matter.
It's not that he can't be apart from them. It's that they're cutting him out. It's that they don't need him. They, the two of them, are a unit and he's the fifth wheel. Deadweight. When Dean eyes the sign of a burger place, he doesn't hesitate.
“Should we talk about the elephant in the room?" Sam asks, stepping closer. He sounds a lot more self-assured than he is. A big chunk of him just wants to ignore it, the same way Dean has apparently decided to.
It’s got to feel strange to kill your lookalike, but Castiel seems unfazed. After all, Sam figures, he didn’t even see himself lying there on the ground, just a body that looked like his vessel.
"Right." He avoids her eyes, and starts to count all the times in his life he's tried to escape this life.
"No. I have said many times that I am not sure whether it is even possible for you and Sam to stop hunting for good."
"She called us in need. The world of men is not right for an angel. You especially should know that."
Not loving someone. He’s had no time to forget that one. He never stopped feeling the steady, almost unshakable kind of love of family, friendship and past relationships. Lord knows, he often wanted to forget, considering how much Lucifer loved exploiting and manipulating these feelings.
Sam had to laugh again. In retrospect, the story and his misstep seemed so ridiculous, but the rejection had hurt back then.
»The last time we saw him, he said there's lots of stuff going on in heaven that needed taking care of.« The second side started to play. »That was about two months ago, I think.«
"I heard." Sam's voice was monotonous. "You thought it was the right thing to do, not keeping me in the loop."
"I don't think you will get bored with Garth and his family," laughed Dean. "Say hello to the old stinker from me." He tickled her and she giggled. "Enjoy the time away from annoying grownups."
Sam sighed. “It’s really not that big of a deal. That’s why I never told you. I just thought you might read something into it. It was just important to Cas —and it was more of a practical thing. In case anything happens.”
Dean’s juggling the cup of coffee and holding the wheel with one hand, sifting through the tapes with the other. When he finds what he’s looking for, he does a little victory fist pump.
She shakes her head. "I don't remember anyone like that. But that doesn't mean anything. My shift just started."
"Because you always loved doing that. From the first time I was ever interested in anyone… You even did when you met Jess."
"Yeah? So let’s go get something to eat and talk there. I need to get changed and I’m exhausted. Aren’t you exhausted, Sam?"
It’s not an instant 180° turnaround. Still, he surprises himself. Once he's set his mind on it, things change fast.
“It is not a real school. It's a foundation that’s supposed to support gifted children. You should see it. Everyone has their own fancy computer and there are only five children in Charlie's course. They set up individual programs for each child." Again he handed Castiel a plate. "But the fees are pretty hefty."
"Good morning." He eyed Sam's startled expression for a moment, then pushed past him to Castiel. He leaned down towards him, framed his face with his hands and pressed his lips firmly to Castiel’s.
"Well, it got quite heated. In the end she chopped his head off. At the same time, there’s an usually high amount of incoming requests for divorce. There’s quite a few cheap houses on the market now, people seem desperate to sell and move."
"I didn't want that! I never wanted that. And you know that!" Sam shook his head. "Have you ever asked him why he did it? Why he wanted a child from me but not from you? Should I have just known? I know what I did wrong, Dean, I know. I shouldn't ever have gotten so drunk, I should have been able to say no, and I shouldn't have lied to you, but... this all happened a decade ago. There's no way for me to change it now." He breathed out slowly. "What do you expect me to do about it? Do you really not want me to talk with him at all? Do you want me to ignore him completely? Alright, I’ll do it. I’ll move out and I’ll cut off all contact. But if I'm supposed to stay here and be cordial and be a family..."
He didn't know exactly why he didn't enter the hallway, but he suspected it was Dean's tone that made him stay inside his room.
"Oh." Castiel looks disappointed by that simple solution. Although of course he must feel relieved too, knowing that Dean is fine.
Dean knew at once it wasn't one of his own tapes. Pearl Jam's "Alive" started playing in the middle of the song. Dean didn't like the song or band very much. He turned up the volume.
"I told you. I know I messed up and I know you want me to make it right." Sam takes another quick sip of his drink, like he's wetting his tongue in between rounds on his debate team.
If there’s anything worse than talking about his potential sex life with Dean, it’s talking about this.
Dean knows he should be annoyed, but when he looks up at him, he can't help feeling validated by the irritation on Castiel's face.
Castiel reached out and touched his forehead. Bright white burned through his head. He could hear music that seemed strangely familiar to him and the mixture of many people's voices. When he opened his eyes, he looked at the wooden floor of a bar. He felt dizzy.
"You thought we imprisoned her?" Again she looked at him with that intense angelic stare, as if she could look right into him. "That's why you broke out. I underestimated what amazing things a human heart is capable of, but you no longer have to worry about your daughter. She is our guest and not our prisoner."
"I'd like to get a clean shirt but I don't want to jeopardize Sam's sleep by walking into his room and making too much noise."
"I agree with Dean that we should return to the school tomorrow," Castiel continues, "just in case it’s attached itself to the place in some way."
"Yeah." Sam softly shoves against Castiel’s chest, who takes a step back. "We were, actually." He takes up the book closest to him. "I didn’t find the exact signs but I found something that comes pretty close. Maybe it’s some sort of variation or-"
All the things that are primarily Dean’s, that he’s graciously let Sam use or be a part of. And it’s not just leftovers, either. In the times they’ve stuck together, Dean alternating between his roles of mother hen and rival brother, he’s mostly tried to make sure that Sam got his fair share.
It penetrates everything, he feels it sinking into his pores. He thinks he'll taste death for days, but he prefers it this way.
It’s just a five minute walk back to the bed and breakfast, but Sam finds himself purposefully walking a bit slower.
"Before," Sam says. This conversation feels horrible. With each second that Dean looks at him like he’s getting tired of explaining the ABCs to a child, Sam gets more unsure. "Before I was with you. When it bit you."
"Yes. You are much more reserved than usual. And you are avoiding eye contact. Did something happen?"
"No worries. Getting re-born can really drain your batteries." Dean felt stupid the moment the words had left his mouth. He wondered if the others noticed his clumsiness too. How careful he was to sidestep anything that could lead to a fight.
"For him, love is something like quicksand. It’s no wonder that he thinks he needs to protect Charlie from it. At the same time he is just being selfish. He’s scared that everyone will leave and he will be left alone."
He thought of Dean's eyes burning into his just hours ago. He could still feel him, and could smell his musky scent - so different to Sam's.
Back in the motel room, Dean found more messages from Cas on his phone. They had continued their drive up the coast today. Castiel liked the small boarding house by the sea that Sam had picked out, and he reported that a seagull had stolen the bread from the plate on the neighboring table.
Sam shook his head, his hair fell in front of his eyes. "No, I'm not stupid, I know it did mean something. It does. But I didn’t plan it and I wouldn't have let it happen as long as you were together."
"So, I’ll drop you off at the old folks home and I’ll drive over to this other guy’s home," Dean says, wiping his mouth with a paper napkin.
Black eyeliner had drawn patterns under her eyes. Eventually, she nodded and slid off her stool to follow him.
Castiel has his arms crossed in front of his chest. His mouth is one stoic fine line, as he stares into space.
Bobby had brought out eggnog and after his second glass even he seemed to find some pleasure in the evening. Especially since he had just unpacked Dean's gift and was now lovingly caressing the Macallan Single Malt Whisky.
"Weeks, whatever. Is that really it? You think I can't be apart from my baby brother for a hot second without going crazy?"
"Right, and if it does turn out to be something supernatural, I'd drive you guys back to the bunker, before taking it on alone. Yeah that makes perfect sense."
From what he had just seen and heard, it should not have felt as much of a surprise as it did, when Dean Cas pulled close and kissed him.
After a while, he drags himself out his room into the kitchen and puts on a pot of water. He watches it as it slowly starts to boil.
"Yeah. I asked her if she’d heard anything about the deaths. It was a long shot, but you know how vamps are when they’re traveling." He looks up at the ceiling, an almost-eye roll. "Honestly, the poor girl just seemed happy to talk to someone besides creepy salesmen trying to get into her pants. Man, I’d hate working here. I’d probably go crazy from boredom in a week."
Within the last few months a semblance of normalcy had taken over their lives. Since Charlie had moved in with them again, sometimes it felt as if they had all never left the bunker in the first place. Of course some things had changed. Charlie had grown older and, as uncomfortable as admitting it was, had turned into an attractive young woman. If Dean thought about it too long he grew sad, knowing how much of her childhood he had been forced to miss. The biggest give away that Charlie wasn’t a child anymore though was Jason, who never really left her side.
He catches Sam's eyes by accident. Their measuring compassion is the last thing Dean wants to see right now.
. And don't start lecturing me about relationships. Most of what you know about that, you know from me anyways."
He noticed he was trembling when he sat down on his bed. The blanket above him felt uncomfortably warm on his skin. The air was stuffy.
Sam raised his glass to his mouth and took a sip of water. The smile still didn't want to leave his lips.
"I don’t know. Some angel." Now that he said it out loud, he felt ashamed for how incredibly stupid and naive he had been. "Sam always had this incredible talent to get himself in some real deep trouble - just think of the apocalypse."
They didn’t just stop for a few things, like they had planned to. Instead, to Dean it felt like they cleared half the store.
"I love you," he answers belatedly, as he moves upwards, kissing over different skin than before. His hand squeezes one of her breasts, provoking a much lower moan. The pale-white beneath him turns into shimmery olive, as he licks his way over a hip bone and upwards. He's kissing her again, as he moves into her now, but it’s much more forceful and urgent.
"Because you want me to leave again. At least that's what you claim when you’re not, you know, wriggling and moaning under me, but I digress. So here's the deal: You send him away, I'll help you save all these poor souls bla bla bla, and then I'm gone. Until you want me back, of course. Because we both know you will."
"There’s a town in Oregon that has caught my intention. At first I wasn’t sure, it didn’t seem like any supernatural events were taking place, but it’s the amount of occurrences that made me decide to research it further."
"Can we just play for a little while?" She begged without letting go of Dean. "Only for a few hours?"
"I know you love her.” Castiel reached for Dean's elbow. "And your genetics have nothing to do with the fact that I don't think it is right for you to make such big decisions by yourself. Or for you to lie to me about them.”
Sam was surprised by the deep and all-encompassing sadness that suddenly flooded him. It had all been too much for a single day and he felt like his nerves had been rubbed raw. He had to get out of here. He had to calm down and start to think clearly again. He stood up. Castiel's eyes clouded over his fear.
He could no longer tell whether Charlie was running in front of or behind him. He stumbled over something hard and went down onto his knees, only to get right up again.
They stand so close. Castiel's hand lies in the crook of his neck. He pulls Sam's head down to bridge the distance between their faces. Sam closes his eyes and kisses back. Blindly his hands find Castiel's shoulders, move over his chest and then to his tie. He pulls on it little, before he loosens it.
Even though Castiel himself was holding a beer, he envied his daughter for the full sip she took from the bottle. Could she taste more than just molecules?
»A Japanese spirit is a yūrei, right?« Dean wiped his sticky hand on his shirt. »That's what Bobby said when we arrived.«
Sam’s eyes are red and the hands have left their mark on his neck, but it’s the way Dean looks at him, as they leave the not-so-abandoned warehouse and the corpses behind, that gives him pause.
Or maybe Dean does understand. Maybe he’s not trying to punish Sam, and is just trying to get a handle on the disgust and shame he feels towards him.
"I know it’s not perfect now. I know it’s not what either of us truly wanted, but it works, doesn’t it? It does." He paused. "Thank you, Sam. I’m not sure if I would have been able to do it."
Dean huffs. "I'm fine." He bends forward onto his elbows, his legs spread apart like a goalkeeper in crisis.  "It's been a rough year, I'll give you that." He looks up at Sam. "You and your hallucinations. And before that, you were doing so bad for so long. I could hardly get you to take a shower."  He pauses. "I don't know what to do when I can't rely on you, Sammy."
In a groggy voice - he's either just woken up or never went to sleep in the first place - Dean tells him he's fine and that he headed out to do "that spike thingy case" last night on a whim.
He's still in possession of the gun. It hangs loosely in his hand, and he could raise it again and shoot her. At least it would confuse her, and give them more time. It's clear she is who they are looking for. She seems different than she was behind the desk, more confident and calm, like a Buddhist monk, but still distinctly human.
He’s pretty sure this is not going to work. He orders a round of beers and sits down near the pool table.
He walks towards the road. There are no cars anywhere. Nor any human being for as far as his eyes can see.
"Perhaps we shouldn’t have accepted Charlie’s offer to stay with her. Maybe it would have been wiser to look for a hotel room."
Jealousy is not a feeling he’s comfortable with. Not just because it feels awful, but also because it’s much too closely connected to anger.
The room is different to the rancid motel rooms they normally stay in. It's more of a mom-and-pop bed and breakfast, that they chose because it’s conveniently located just down the street.
He looked bad, Sam thought. Old. His face was pale and puffy and the shadow under his eyes was so deep that he wondered when his brother had last slept.
Castiel looked at him with big open eyes, and remained silent. Maybe he was trying to find the right words. But what was Sam trying to gain here? Another love declaration that left him feeling uncomfortable and yet strangely reassured, that at least someone still thought of his as good and worthy of affection.
"Well, I knew it wasn't vampires," Dean says, examining the bite marks, running a thumb over the scars on the flesh.
Sam suddenly becomes aware that he's just possibly shared the most long winding version of "I'll love you forever" and Castiel has in fact, in a way, reciprocated.
Now she hit the table with her fist, only that despite her despair this gesture had nothing human. A blast ran through the room, knocking over glasses and cups. Everything was quiet for a moment, even Charlie before she spoke again.
Sam seems to grow smaller, as his hands dig deeper into his pockets. "I'm not really tired. I just feel like having coffee." He starts walking towards the station's shop, when Dean grips his arm.
She pushed her dark long hair behind her ear. The way she sang along to Led Zeppelin, like it was second nature, made him feel something strange. It was a strong emotional mix of instinctive protectiveness and painful love that he hadn't felt in a long time. The last time he had felt it, Sam had been much younger than he was now. It seemed a lifetime ago, back when it still had felt like he'd had a younger brother. Whenever Dean thought of what had become of them, he felt a little sick and paralyzed – but also still incredulous. Like someone was playing a sick joke on him.
"Look, we said no more unnecessary lying, alright?" Dean steps closer, speaking softly. He can feel Cas' shoulder trembling as he gets ahold of it. "Just tell me what's going on, okay? What do you mean when you say you help him?" He puts the last two words into quotation marks.
He listens to Dean lecturing about music. Castiel asks the right questions to keep Dean going for a while.
Dean huffs and takes a half step back. Then he puts his tongue between his teeth and shakes his head. "Is it the Kitsune thing?"
For all Dean knows, they might have been in that pose for ages, in stillness, just holding each other.
"It's because of the masking spell that protects her." He rose into a sitting position and chased away the dizziness. "It hides her from all the angels, including me."
Sam doesn't want to argue. But it's not just the mistake that worries him. Cas looks different, exhausted and tired and even paler than usual.
"Nothing." Sam shrugged. "It’s fine. But you know I was never in love with it as much as you were. It’s fine. It’s practical. And you really like it."
"I can tell that she’s a gifted child. But it’s still important not to lose sight of the social side of things. It doesn't matter where she’ll end up, at some university or on the big stage, she will always have to find a way to deal with other people.”
"She is very interested in a lot of topics." Castiel nodded and closed the book in which he had just been immersed. A conversation with Sam was always more interesting and important to him.
It was pretty clear that Charlie knew that she somehow was the cause of the tension between all of them, but she didn't seem to know who she should feel sorry towards. Castiel for telling, or Sam for not telling earlier.
"I understand you." Castiel says. His eyes burn into Dean's, who tears them away and back to the road.
“Then you find work someplace else. I always forget what you do anyway." Sam opened his mouth, but Dean shook his head. "And I don't really care to know either. Just come to her birthday, okay?"
But when he gets to save someone, for that moment it seems that there’s still some sense to it all. It’s what keeps him going, when he wavers. An actual human life. Saved. It’s a simple concept to grasp. Easy to imagine he’s doing the right thing then.
He wondered what kind of family issues she'd thought they had. She had been a very rational person, who would have laughed at the thought of the supernatural being real.
Her eyes never left his. “And you'd protect me. And I'd never cry or give you any kind of trouble. I am quiet. I’d shut up when you’re annoyed or tired. I promise. I wouldn't bother you."
Dean had also gotten up and approached his brother. When Charlie let go of him, Dean hugged Sam. He held him with a firm grip and clapped his back before he drew away a little. Dean’s body knew nothing of his mixed emotions. It didn’t want to let go; on a primal level it felt right to be reunited with his brother.
“Earlier today you told me he deserved me." Castiel's voice sounds almost neutral. "Is that what you truly think?"
The police woman —a blonde, busty thing, mid-40s but well-preserved— looks at Dean a little sheepishly. She admits that there might have been some details emitted from the report.
They were all alone in the empty screen room now. A stale and slightly burned smell penetrated the air, where dust particles danced around until they settled on Sam's skin. Castiel envied them, it was easy and consequence-free, while his own touch always seemed to unsettle Sam, even at times when he seemed to welcome it too.
Dean stared at Sam’s hand fiddling with the small knife. He considered mentioning that they had other bigger ones, too.
Castiel stepped up to him, and caught his attention. "Tell Dean I'll come over and look with them." He touched Sam's shoulders. "Everything will be fine. I promise."
There’s many things Dean wants to say, even more things he wants to convey wordlessly. He knows he has messed up; he’ll make it alright again, once he knows how to.
The Djinn pulled his hand back as if he had burned himself. Her gaze was still intimidating. Dean could see the blue light clearly behind her eyes.The Djinn probably saw it too, even if he tried not to show his uncertainty.
"That’s pretty much all the reason people need to spend their time together. Also…" He can’t help but smile a little. "There’s so many shows and movies you still need to catch up on. We haven’t even started on the Sci-Fi. And your perfect coffee’s still out there somewhere, I’m sure of it."
"Jesus, Sammy, don't —" He's right. Dean does not want to hear this. "Of course, you're supposed to be with me." Dean closes his eyes for a moment. He needs a second to let the feeling fade. He's failed if Sam thinks like this.
Lila’s face remained blank. "And if I say you can go, will you use your powers to avenge those scumbag hunters you didn’t even know?"
He missed everything about Sam. The occasional irritated note in his voice. The know-it-all attitude he sometimes had. Even the passive aggressiveness that had sometimes come over Sam when he was stressed.
It was Dean’s. As clear as day, even before it said the things it said. Before Sam had been forced to watch them almost-make out.
Sam reached into the pocket of his jacket with his right hand. He took out something that Dean only recognized as tinsel at the second glance.
"Come on, leave your uncle be, or he'll never be able to get away." Sam grabbed his daughter's hand and for a moment it looked like she was going to follow him without hesitation, then she turned back to Dean.
Sam watched her go, no less irritated than before. "Why does she have to change? I thought you were just going out to eat?”
"You know you can't trust angels." It was Dean who spoke and stood protectively next to his brother. "What if it had been a trap? What if they had tried-"
"Are you back together with Dad?" she asked and twisted one of her long strands of black hair around her finger.
Charlie splashed her hand into one of the puddles. She had a look of pure innocence on her face, one that Dean recognized from Sam. He laughed again. Sam threw him another angry look.
He looked up. He had to look terrible because Dean was visibly startled. Maybe he had never seen him cry like that before. Had he ever seen him cry before?
He feels stupid, as he’s walking along the corridor, looking for his room. He’s not sure why this tinge of disappointment is even there.
Why did this thing show itself to him in the first place, when it could have taken its pick from all of the students and staff instead.
Sam resumes eating. He eats quicker under Castiel's eyes. When he gets up to clean his bowl, he can't shake the feeling that Castiel expects him to do or say something else; be more proactive about Dean missing. So Sam asks: "Is the Impala missing?"
So much for that: Sam's casually conversing with his angel boyfriend after a much too common mid-afternoon near death experience. That's their normal.
She looks at Sam, biting the inside of her cheek. Before she can ask him if he’s fine again, Dean takes the last sip of his coffee and gets up.
Okay, so maybe the shrink would have a point. Maybe he uses food in a similar way to how he uses alcohol, sex, shooting things —as physical vertexes to remind himself that he’s still alive.
"You didn’t miss much." Castiel watches him drink. "I thought you might be ill at first. Generally, you wake up early. And punctual. But you’re fine. I checked."
It was so damn typical of Sam to think he had anything in common with a shit-eating ghost who'd tried to plunge them down a steep cliff just two days ago.
"No. I just went through the list of names that I compiled. I told them some bullshit about them being connected to that missing persons report."
Dean hates Portland. He's not a fan of big cities on principle, what with the horrible traffic and  lack of parking. All that crime and the anonymity that lets monsters and demons blend into the background seamlessly. The way these ever-changing metropolitan areas look different each time you drop by every couple of years. It all sets his teeth on edge. But Dean's hate for Portland is more specific, more personal. He's always had a sense of affinity towards the underdog. He feels most at home among freaks. But he can't stand people play-acting at being different. All the pretentious art and the frou-frou hippy cafés and people who think claiming they're alternative makes them actually special. As if they knew what living on the edge of society actually meant. They all look the same to him and they all make his blood boil.
The situation was bizarre. They looked at each other with pleasant surprise. A little overwhelmed maybe, like old friends who happened to run into each other when they’d least expected it.
Castiel doesn’t reply. But for the rest of the car drive, when Castiel isn’t checking his phone, Dean catches him staring.
If Sam's surprised by the change of topic, he doesn't show it. "Yeah, she said it couldn't have been the therapist anyway, because she wasn't out of the country. So unless she was working with someone in Canada… But gods don't usually gang up like that."
Sam laughed again and bent down to the bed, to put a soft hand onto Castiel's cheek. Then his face grew grim again. "So I guess I'm going to venture into the teenage dragon's den now and try to wake up the sleeping monster."
He had planned to talk to Dean about it as soon as they were alone. He wanted to tell him not to interfere like that. But the way Charlie beamed had stopped Sam. It would only lead to another argument with Dean anyway. This wasn't a hill worth dying on. Chocolate cream wasn't that bad after all. Besides, having a child with his brother's partner brought a life debt that couldn't ever be weighed against Nutella.
She nods again, and leaves. Dean seizes the remaining paper bag off the cargo area of the truck and carries them to the Impala. Up close he notices a splatter of blood on the side of the car. It must be Sam's, from when they pushed him into the backseat last night. It's not much, but the patterned red on the black paint unnerves him. He tries to rub the blood away with his right hand, while balancing the bag with his left. The blood won't budge. He licks his thumb and tries again. Finally, the red starts to smudge.
There’s a small slit between the two parts of the swing door. He leans in as close as possible without touching them.
She gave him a kiss on the cheek as she passed him before pushing him aside again to open the drawer with the beer opener.
Dean watches Castiel reach for the glove compartment in what seems like a really silly way to avoid answering the question. His slender fingers unpack the piece of gum as if it’s a present. He carefully shoves it between his lips and starts chewing slowly.
There's a knock on the door, and another one, more frantic this time. The secretary shouts: "If you don't let me in, I will call the police!"
"Sam's not really big on burgers," Dean says, turning his on his plate until the side with the lettuce faces him. "He's more the kale and carrots kinda guy."
"We can’t." Castiel looked anywhere but at him. "Sam was dead. We were afraid that he wouldn’t ever return and he told us to live our lives the best we could without him. But —"
"Dean?" He opened the door a crack, then - noticing how strange that must have come off - he removed the chain and opened the door completely. "What are you doing here?"
"For you," Dean said, holding a reusable term mug with the logo of the café in front of Charlie. "And for you too."
“Come on." He could hear the whininess in his own voice and he disliked it. "Don’t make me repeat all this crap."
"Yeah," Sam finally answers. "He told me he'd leave me alone if Castiel went away and he did. I did it so I could finish the case."
Dean shrugged. "Back to the hotel, I guess." Just as Sam was about to leave, he said: "Listen… About earlier..."
A weird noise escapes his throat, before the words come tumbling out. "Nothing, I mean, the truth. I told him we weren’t, of course." The cups in his hands start feeling less hot and more lukewarm. "What about you? What did you say?"
Dean bites his lip and looks away. Sam looks over at Castiel. He gets the hint. "I'm going to…" he starts. "I'm going to look at a file in our room," he says with no subtlety and leaves.
Sam turned to him slowly. "I'm not asking you to be someone you're not, Cas. I'm just asking you to be honest with me."
"I know it's not your fault.” Her long fingers traced over her exercise books. It was a beautiful black booklet made from recycled leather that Sam had given her for her last birthday. "I heard you both arguing every time you were visiting. I always knew you didn't want us to leave.”
Castiel's whole body seemed to stretch towards Dean. Dean wouldn't let him continue talking. He already sealed Castiel's mouth with his lips again. A guttural moaning, familiar to Sam from the hookups where the sideline had been in earshot, escaped Dean's lips. »Fuck...«
She looks down at the folder in her lap. "You told my receptionist you were diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression," she says. Well, he did take some of these online tests that one time when he couldn't sleep. It didn't help as much as he'd thought, to be able to put a name to some of the things he was feeling. There was still enough wrong with him that he couldn't find in any psych manual. "Are you feeling suicidal?"
They way Sam is standing next to the projector makes him look like an unruly child getting caught red-handed. The way he’s looking at him too.
Castiel was rarely strict, but he did not like the way she seemed to see through him when it came to Sam.
"Sam." Once again Castiel tried to put a hand on his shoulder. Sam brushed it off. "Yes, you're right about most angels' attitudes towards nephilims. We were taught to consider a nephilim as an unnatural creature that poses a great danger. ”
"No." Castiel's voice softens. "I'm not angry. I'm merely suggesting that I've seen Sam's behaviour mirrored in yours before. It's just..." He hesitates.
