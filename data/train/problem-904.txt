"Oh, but you've got to. I've got your pal." A little giggle punctuated the last word.
? But that was….
Oh, God. He didn't want this anymore. He couldn't sustain this fiction. It was killing him, hard on his body and murderous to his psyche. The responsibility of it all – Christ, he hadn't even owned a dog in years because his life wouldn't allow for it, and now he wasn't even sure he could manage a pet on his own. He hadn't been ready for children. He'd spent the last year in an increasingly thick and pleasant bubble, burdens and duties gently prised from his grip (
He exited the morgue, whistling merrily.
'Sherlock' snorted. "Oh, I see. So it's perfectly ordinary to stand here talking to an
"Safe," Sherlock repeated.
"Well, yes, but that's not the immediate concern. You lie back, we'll be at the hotel in no time."
"Mary – yeah, that's Mr Dedalus." Sebastian seated himself beside his brother. "You can ask him about her yourself, though."
"There's everything to apologise for," John said fiercely. He couldn't quite mention Mary yet. That was still a sore spot. Perhaps it would be a sore spot for some time, but meanwhile he could try to atone for his behaviour, just a little. "Four years. I've regretted every moment of it. I don't want to live like that anymore, Sherlock. I need…I'm begging you to forgive me. Please."
"Right around when Lady Howe died, then," John said.
"Is she coming or going?"
John sighed. "Right, okay…." He began rifling through the desk drawers.
"Not to my knowledge." Mycroft gazed meditatively at the two graves. "She named me her executor."
, whoever you are." Who in God's name used chloroform to render someone unconscious nowadays? It was notoriously inefficient as it took forever to take effect and the possibility of permanent damage was high. However, if the victim was dosed with GHB prior to the inhalant, then it would be easier to take someone down. Much easier.
"It's okay," Sherlock mumbled, and took another drink.
"Hey there, mate – you okay?"
"Fine. See you later." Sherlock marched upstairs to shower.
They didn't speak much as they ate, and Mycroft appeared to ignore Benedict in favour of his food. Maybe that was a carry-over from childhood. In any case, it failed to provide Benedict with added comfort; a silent Mycroft, bolt-upright in his chair and eating methodically, was almost as scary as a verbal Mycroft.
John's hand stroked Sherlock's back and slid beneath his t-shirt to caress the ridged skin. "Tell me about this."
Siger moved close to the glass. “Hello, love. Happy Christmas.”
Sherlock found a t-shirt and pyjama bottoms that replicated his own clothes with a fair degree of comfort, and went downstairs to boot up the laptop. He made a prosciutto and Gruyere sandwich and after some digging, located the teakettle and tea in the pantry and made a pot, taking it to Cumberbatch's library.
"It's all right," the attendant said.
Sherlock led the way upstairs. "Tea?" he inquired, unlocking the door.
John shook his head, still smiling. "It sounds really interesting to me."
"No. And the photos…." He opened the photos:  one of two men holding down a clearly straining third whose face was covered with a dark cloth – but the clothed figure and hands were easily identifiable. There was no question as to the man's identity. The second was appallingly clear:  Sherlock, naked, restrained, and beaten, his body covered in angry red stripes.
Sherlock rolled over with a grunt. "I was sleeping."
"Oh, so I'll call you Sherlock, then," Benedict snapped. Arsehole.
John listened in silence. When Sherlock had stopped speaking, he took one of Sherlock's hands in his and turned it palm-up, pressing his thumb lightly to its centre. "Sherlock, when have you ever seen me unable to take care of myself?" He smiled. "Okay, apart from a few times, I admit it. Seriously, though –"
Without a word, Sherlock sat up, his gaze darting between John and Moriarty. He started to push himself to his feet.
"Right. Right." Sherlock climbed in and gave the driver Moran's address.
Sherlock stayed seated. "It's one person, isn't it?"
"Fuck –" John struggled to his feet, parcel in hand.
"It wasn't bad - I was out for a moment, not long enough to cause concern. As I said, the current wasn't strong enough to do serious damage. They took me to hospital and looked me over."
kept confidential on the Moran-Howe acquisitions. Sounds like a pattern to me." Sherlock gave Guthrie a winning smile.
"What…what do you mean?" Apprehension began to unspool in Tom's stomach.
Well, he’d tried at least. He got to his feet, downed the rest of the whisky, and dashed upstairs.
He didn't want to go to dinner tomorrow night. He didn't want to go
"Oh, God." Sherlock stalked through the maze of tombstones. "Merry Christmas, Mycroft!"
"Yeah. It kind of explains a few things, from what the doctors said." Tom glanced at Sherlock. "No – look, you don't have to say a word. Ben's going to be
"I need your charter service. I've got to get to Derry ASAP."
"Work your magic," Tom murmured, and climbed on the bed. He stretched out his arms and legs, watching Sherlock expectantly.
"Of what?" Sherlock yanked his arm from Mycroft's grasp. "Ghosts?"
"You've got two choices for supper – creamy chicken and veg over rice, or teriyaki chicken and veg over rice."
"My goodness," Tom said. "All that in four days. It's hard to believe."
"Let's leave.
He still couldn't
Greg decided to tease a bit. “When
“No, I’m good, thanks. Anyway, I’d just slow you down – knowing you, you haven’t packed a bag yet. When’s your flight? Eight tomorrow morning?”
"Mm," Sherlock replied, climbing out of the car. He forced himself to return Tom's wave, and watched as the car drove down the road, taillights winking in the darkness.
Good. It was still good, it was brilliant, in fact. John thrust and thrust and finally shuddered and groaned as he came. He held Mary closely, burying his nose in her neck, inhaling her fragrance, always more complex than soap or perfume or food.
It was so difficult to contain her bitterness at the lost years between them. Mycroft had claimed it was for the best; Violet and Sig hadn’t even had an opportunity to discover whether or not it was true. Violet, in her deepest heart, knew it wasn’t. She’d grieved; no matter what Eurus had done, she was still Violet’s little girl, her youngest and most brilliant child. There must have been something Violet could have done to circumvent the problems that made Eurus struggle so. That chance had been stolen from her, though, and it was unlikely that she’d be able to make a difference now.
"You've got a job to do," Sherlock muttered. "Stop dithering and do it."
"You'd better help her pack," Benedict said. "She's going to need some assistance. Apparently her wardrobe's quite extensive."
The phone chirped:  Mycroft. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
A plain white business envelope with his name and the agency's address. No return.
Ah. Physical punishment, not sexual assault, then. It was a tossup as to which was more painful, though the latter wasn't necessarily out of the question yet. Sherlock managed a derisive snort. "He ruined his own life. With some help from you and Jim, obviously."
"Nope, got cancelled. They're doing something to the pool. Do you want me to take the phone to Mum?"
do you think you're doing?"
Anger and frustration and something ineffable he couldn't work out made Sherlock raise his head and meet Tom's eyes at last. He saw Tom's face crumple and immediately knew what the ineffable was. "Tom…."
“Oh, John, no –”
Sherlock scowled ferociously, then sank back against the pillows. "Well. I suppose he's long gone."
"Could I eat in peace, Sherlock?" John set his book face-down on the coarse white linen tablecloth. "I just – just let me eat in peace, all right?"
"Nice, actually," John said, and grinned. "It's been good getting to know you."
It was time to move forward. He didn't want to, he was tired and unhappy and he'd fucked things up irrevocably, but there was no room for retreat. John needed him. Trusted him. Sherlock. And if John trusted Sherlock, then maybe Sherlock was trustworthy. Even if he ignored John's eyes. John Watson, who had Martin Freeman's face – wonderful, foul-mouthed, blunt and grumpy Martin – but whose heart was altogether different.
Was this a long-established tradition of payment? Sorting Mycroft's ties or maybe some childish retribution? He couldn't really see Mycroft sitting on Sherlock and dangling spit over his face, or giving him one of those nasty arm-burns. "Why don't you say it?"
"What happened. I – look, we can talk about it, or not, it's up to – oh, Christ, you don't know how happy I am to see you. Henry's – he's fucking insane, Ben. He killed a girl the other day, or maybe a week ago, I don't know, and he killed my mate Katie at RADA – God knows how many people he's got stashed out in the garden. We've got to get out of here."
Moriarty smiled through a two-week growth of beard, though his suavity was diminished; dark circles marred the skin beneath his eyes, and he'd lost weight. "Thought so. Different cell though, unless you've redecorated. Kind of a Jean Genet vibe you've got going here. Missing a few things, though – like access to a solicitor." Moriarty's smile thinned. "People are going to wonder where I've got to."
Moving only his eyes, he took in the state of his flat. It was pretty terrible, if he were honest with himself. Messy and disorganised even by his reckoning, dusty and damp at the same time (a neat trick, actually), something ponging unpleasantly and unidentifiably in the kitchen. Mrs Hudson had thrown up her hands and written down a list of cleaners, leaving it pointedly over a stain on the fridge, but he hadn’t got round to calling anyone yet. Perhaps in the new year. Possibly.
---It's a bloodbath down in A&E. Five or six of them brought in as well. Three dead I think?
"Oh, fuck's
Oh God. He'd
Sherlock gaped.
“Look at this.” Molly showed Janine the text.
"No, I mean – " John got the joke a moment too late and chortled, feeling no end of a fool. "Oh. Yeah, yeah. I mean the shower, are you –"
"I'll do that." He thought about texting John, but it would be better to find out what he could about Dedalus first. Still, best to feel things out here even before that. "You don't mind if I invite John along, do you? I'm certain he has a few questions of his own to ask Mr Dedalus."
John slipped his phone into his pocket and went off to grab a few more biscuits; he had the feeling that Sherlock was going to sleep for a long time.
Sherlock heard tramping footsteps and voices below stairs. "Damn."
The other man pointed his rifle at Benedict. "You too."
"Lord Stephen Moran."
"I'm not comfortable leaving you alone with both of them, sir," Coddington said. "Slippery, the pair of them."
He did his best not to struggle against the tape binding him to the chair, not that struggling would have done him a bit of good. "I can't say the new look's much of an improvement – Nick."
"I was just a stopgap, is that it?" For the first time there was bitterness in her voice.
He hadn't asked Mycroft how he'd discovered Mary's identity, but that wasn't necessary; it was only surprising that he hadn't discovered it sooner. What disturbed him was Mycroft's question about Mary being
stuck inside some sort of spatial or temporal anomaly (not that Sherlock knew a thing about it – he was a chemist, not a physicist, thank you very much!) how were they supposed to escape it? Benedict thought about being trapped forever, never seeing his parents again, the rest of his family, his friends, his coworkers, Tom –
"College."
Mary and Nora had come home an hour later, as John, having got four hundred decent words down, was rapidly flicking through television channels and finding nothing. "Smells grand," Mary had commented after Nora had kissed John and thundered upstairs.
"She fell on the right side of her face, but she's blind in both eyes."
, Sherlock finally realised a bit hazily. None of the pristine elegance of Cumberbatch's newish digs; if he had a cleaning service he used it irregularly or had them avoid the bedroom.
Unfamiliar church bells pealed in the distance, reminding Benedict that he wasn't home. It was Sunday, and he was in Sussex, in a safe house with guards outside and a very angry John Watson inside.
"All right, look. I was thinking about just keeping shut, but…what
“All of it. Look, you don’t have to do a thing except help me clean up. Go into the kitchen and get to work, it’s disgusting.”
"Yeah, you did, come to think of it." Sherlock's lip started to throb, keeping time with the pounding in his head. "Not sure this is the special occasion you had in mind, though."
"Oh, yeah, it's not really that random. A few, but all of the kind you asked for."
"Oh, I think you know."
Slowly, Ben shook his head. "No."
"Oh, thank
The first one he'd read and no lie, it had worried him, but he chalked it up to random weirdness and had chucked it in the bin. He'd done the same with the second, but when the third one had arrived, he'd saved it. And the fourth, and now this one. And they seemed to get progressively more hostile. He hadn't told Luke, nor anyone at the agency, nor the police.
"So you know who I am." The man preened a bit.
Tom turned to Sherlock, then took a tentative step forward. His nostrils quivered a bit, and as if by some instinct, he glanced at the toilet stall, then back at Sherlock.
Sherlock followed, pretending he had the luxury of time.
Well, evidently they weren't going to let him up until they'd checked him thoroughly. Standard procedure, if completely, utterly boring. Sherlock closed his eyes and retreated to his mind palace. Surely there was a bit more data on doppelgangers and multiverses; he hadn't pulled the information out of nowhere, after all.
"Your attention to this matter is appreciated," Mycroft said stiffly.
Moriarty pouted. "Do I have to?"
John sighed silently.
"I promise you that I will never, ever experiment on your heart." Sherlock reached out and pressed his hand to John's chest. "It's far too valuable for that."
"Maybe he's not willing to invest the capital. Or maybe it's convenient as it is." Sherlock stepped into a room and shone his light inside, playing the beam over furniture covered with sheets.
"Righto." Dr Roche, irrepressibly friendly and disconcertingly young (in the past few years he'd begun to notice that a good number of not totally incompetent professionals were considerably younger than himself. He wasn't sure whether to be amused or irritated by this), slapped a series of X-rays onto the illuminated view box. "As I said, this is just confirmation of what I'd expected to see, given the symptoms you've described, Mr Holmes, but I prefer to be thorough." She pointed at a section of the X-ray. "Have a look at this. Do you see that little protrusion there? That's an osteophyte, otherwise known as a bone spur. Also, if you look here, you can see that you've experienced some diminishment of the cartilage – not unusual for an active, healthy individual, but obviously it's best to nip this sort of problem in the bud to prevent further injury. So, to summarise – the knee's banjaxed, but not irreparably." She gave him a wide smile.
wasn't tedious," Sherlock said. He stretched and yawned. Oh, God, it was good to be back home.
John buttered a piece of toast and set it on Nora's plate. "Strawberry or orange marmalade?"
Blood surged to Sherlock's cheeks. "What – why do you ask that? Just because you're attempting to hide what too many people still think are deviant practices in order to maintain some sort of impossible glossy façade, you believe you can pick me apart? See what makes me tick? Haven't you got autographs to sign or journalists' arses to kiss?"
Sherlock took a deep breath and closed the book, setting it beside him.
I'm worried about. Why would you even say that?"
John picked up his daughter and held her so that she could kiss her mother's cheek for the last time.
"To old friends," Sherlock echoed.
"It's okay," Sherlock said, and hurried to Tom's side. "It's okay. Hang on, hang on." He went for the gag first, pulling the rope down with some effort and easing the cloth from Tom's mouth.
Almost everything was the same. Benedict closed his eyes and massaged his temples.
Irene Adler cocked an eyebrow at him. "How perceptive."
"Uh. Huh."
John had been watching the byplay between Benedict and Irene with fascination. Now he moved reluctantly to stand beside Benedict. "Mind telling me what the hell's going on?" he inquired in a low mutter.
The nurse smiled, her seamed face wrinkling. "You can ask any question you want, love."
"7:35, as far as I can determine."
All the colour had drained from Moriarty's face. He stared at Benedict as if he'd been unceremoniously unplugged.
He pulled on the socks, tied his shoes, and stood up. He was hungry, and even if John was furious, that was no reason for Benedict to stay holed up and starving in his room all day. Even a cup of tea and some toast would tide him over. Resolute, he marched into the kitchen.
"Didn't notice."
The young woman's eyes were enormous. "Oh my God." Her hand went to her throat, and she nodded stupidly. "I…I…."
"Filming. Ben, I think you'd better sit down. You're pacing. I'm keeping you from something, I think."
"I thought about it the whole way back," Mary said, and squeezed his hand. "I know it hasn't sunk in for you. And the will's not been probated yet – there are still some formalities, but her lawyer said everything was aboveboard. He said he'd been working on it with her…before….and that they'd ironed most of the details out. She'd already sold her house and liquidated most of her assets. She wanted to make things as easy as she possibly could, she told him. I can probably expect the transfer within eight to twelve weeks."
"Sherlock saves lives," John said, cutting into the silence. "All you know how to do is take them."
There had been a long, long pause.
Martha exhaled. “Oh, Gautam. It was never love, was it? I never wanted to marry you – I thought we were having a bit of fun. But somehow I doubt either of your wives knew about me.”
John's chest tightened. He glanced down at Nora:  fast asleep. He typed rapidly, and the screen flashed again.
“Sounds grand. It’s cold out there.” Greg smiled. “It’s all right that I’m here, isn’t it? You said the other day that you didn’t have Christmas plans.” He stepped on a sudden desire to flee. He’d felt a bit of…something…when he and Mycroft were in each other’s company, and with a boldness that was uncharacteristic, he’d taken this plunge. A visit. Business only, naturally.
"I'm Lori Finch, the associate service director. Will you follow me, please?"
"Mm. Typical, but not original. Obviously, I'm ignoring it." Sherlock took a deeper drink of the tea.
John nodded. "Yeah. I got Colleen Maddox to fill in for me. You haven't got anything on, have you? You're not headed anywhere?"
"Lord Moran had five siblings. Three sisters, one older, two younger. The oldest is a countess, living in Yorkshire. The middle is married to a builder, pots of money, and the youngest is an administrator for a mental hospital in Enniskillen. Another sister was born dead. A brother, eight years younger than Lord Moran, was killed in a car bombing at the age of seventeen in the late 80s. A Protestant faction claimed responsibility for that one." The lift bell chimed softly, and Sherlock held the door open for John. "Lord Moran must have decided at some point to play both ends against the middle despite that, and in this case it worked out for him, the IRA, and the British government. The terms were negotiated successfully, and the IRA's been reasonably quiet since then."
"What do you care?" Benedict stepped hard on his steadily encroaching fear. It was physically loathsome to be this close to Moriarty. He smelled of a decent men's cologne, starched cotton, and mint gum, but the combination was noxious, stomach-churning.
“Oh, I don’t think so.” Mycroft took another drink.
"Turn that
"It's not actually necessary for you to keep saying my name," Sherlock replied irritably.
"John!" Sherlock shouted. "John!"
There was no sound from John's room, but there was a heavy pounding on the cottage's front door. "Mr Holmes! Open up!"
Stricken, Nora spun in her chair. "Baklava?"
"That's Sir Mycroft to you, little brother." Mycroft patted his mouth with his napkin.
"Congratulations, you idiot!" Molly said, shaking her head. Then she laughed. "Gosh, you know how to make a girl feel good."
He swung back on the motorway to London and drove in silence for a while. Traffic was heavier, and the going was slower, so he eased up on the accelerator accordingly, though the temptation to weave the sleek little car through the mass of machinery was strong. He felt the adrenaline draining from his body and the onset of exhaustion and mild letdown that often followed a case. True, there was nothing much more to investigate, though working out exactly how many people he'd killed and how would have been diverting, but it was the only really interesting thing that had happened in the last few days and he wouldn't have minded sticking with it a bit longer. Inter-universe travel was duller than he'd have guessed, not that he'd given it much thought. If he was stuck here for a while longer, he'd have to find something else to divert him.
Sherlock blew a breath out. The poor sod was certainly trying, he supposed. Now to read up on this Arthur Conan Doyle….
"Dear God," Cumberbatch muttered, and averted his eyes.
"Mm, thought so. How'd you smuggle it in? One of your buddies drop it in the post for you? Or did you bring it in shoved up your bum?"
"Oh, think nothing of it." Sherlock spooned up tomato bisque and sipped daintily. It was delicious. Mycroft had recently acquired a new cook; he must have been doing double duty on the workouts because the amazing food didn't seem to be showing up on his figure.
world, whether they played straight or gay or ambivalent or asexual – in this world, in this time and place, John Watson loved Sherlock Holmes and, God bless him, found the courage to tell him so in his own sort of roundabout way. Even if the result had been a misunderstanding and a punch – Benedict again felt tentatively of the spongy flesh around his eye, and winced – that had taken bravery.
sleeping ensemble with the addition of a slick plastic apron. A pair of goggles sat on the floor beside him. White floor, white walls. Confused, Benedict glanced round. "Where the hell are we? This isn't the set."
It was a good day to be alive.
John sighed. "She was nice."
Did Dr. Hawking even exist in this universe?
"Not at all," Sherlock said. "I'll get to it tomorrow. I've lost my ID but I'm sure Molly will leave word, won't you, Molly?"
John took it and secured the bandage. "There should be just enough room to tuck a finger beneath the bandage. Okay, stand up."
Irene had gone noticeably paler, but tilted a saucy little smile at him all the same. "You'll never crack the code."
"Yeah."
"That's not funny," Benedict said, heaving himself up by the palms of his hands.
"Shit," John breathed. "Georgina, you think?"
"Better. Anyway, as I said, it was very nice. When's your next meet?"
It had been very poorly received by his peers, such as they were – idiots, the lot of them.
"Fifteen." Benedict skirted a stack of sandbags and nodded to a pair of grips. "'Night, guys. Thanks."
Sherlock opened his eyes and scowled at the anxious faces hanging over him. No-one familiar. Hadn't it worked?
"Yeah, but some of them had kids, Sherlock. And maybe most of them were like her, even though she was creepy, admit it – but what if they weren't? What if they got indoctrinated or something?"
"Fine."
Greg laughed. “No, my kids took a snap of one and texted it to me, the scamps. It’s…well, have a look.” He found the picture on his phone and handed it to Mycroft.
"That's about right," Sherlock replied. "And if you did know, why you chose not to give it back."
"Oh."
Sherlock took John's hand and urged him up gently. "Come on."
"Go where?" John scooped rice into his mouth.
. Smelled it on her the night of the murder, but it's…it reminds me of something, I can't think what."
"Listen to me. You've been drugged. I know it's difficult, but you've got to pull yourself together and talk to me. It's the only way I can help you out of this. But we've only got a few moments, so you've got to do it quickly."
Benedict leant forward and gave Tom a little peck on the lips, the sort of kiss one gave to a powdery, perfume-soaked great-aunt. "You said you got another of those letters."
iteration of Sherlock Holmes – coming to independent life was absolutely, no question, beyond fucked up. There was no way that Sherlock had talked to him in a tiny white box of a room, no way that they had somehow traded places.
Moriarty's eyes darkened, and he leant closer. "You remember the last time you and I sat across from each other, Sherlock? Hm? You wanted everything to be clever. You wanted me to be able to control the world with a few lines of computer code, and what do you know – now I do. And I waited; years and years, making everything perfect, so you could appreciate it. And now here you are, duller than ever, but I am not going to be disappointed by this meeting. I refuse." He stood up, pushing his chair back, and went to the staircase. "I'll get you that water."
"Okay." Enright frowned over the paper again. "Is there anything else you need?"
Benedict blinked. "Okay. Hey, what's going on? Where did everyone go?" He rose to his feet, still blinking in the staggering brilliance. "Why's it so bloody bright in here?" He stopped, frowning in consternation. They were in a…a box. Pure white, no doors, no windows, not a single seam to offset the whiteness. He whirled on the man who still sat on the floor. The man's feet were bare. Even his
Henry let Sherlock's hair go and straightened up, folding his arms and grinning. "And did you call the police, Benedict?"
"I don't know." Mary got up and checked the rice, then opened the range to peer at the chicken. "This changes a lot, John."
"Never mind. What are you thinking about?"
Benedict forced himself to meet John's gaze calmly.
Sherlock drained his tea and set the mug onto the night table. It rattled and almost fell over.
"You sure you're okay?"
"Christ," Benedict whispered. "Okay. Okay. I'll be here." He got up. "Are you – are you certain Moriarty's dead?"
"Not late, am I?" He'd delayed hailing a cab, and once in, he'd argued with himself – was this a good idea? No, it probably wasn't – but in the end, he'd urged the driver to step on it, and his heart had thundered in his chest.
Well, if Sherlock were entirely honest with himself, it could be days before John noticed. He wasn't an utter dullard, but his forte wasn't observation, really. And Sherlock was a sphinx when it suited him.
"You feel fine," John mused. He dug his phone out of his pocket, turned on the camera, and reversed the view, handing the phone over to Sherlock. "Look at yourself. Look at your pupils. That's a pretty extreme disparity in size. If you've got a brain bleed, you're going to be sorry you didn't get an MRI."
Sherlock strode down the street. Not a cab in sight, damn it – he wasn't walking to central London, though if he didn't find one, there was always the tube. He stopped and waited. Cars zoomed past, billowing exhaust, noisy and irritating, and not one of them was a taxicab. Sherlock waited two more minutes, then began walking to Hampstead Heath station.
A diffuse, shimmering uncertainty shifted John's insides. "You can stay in here if you want to read."
"Please, just let me finish. Sherlock's such a fucking stubborn arsehole, he'll cheerfully die before he admits to a tender emotion. He'll never say one word – he probably doesn't even understand how because normal human feelings are incomprehensible to him."
"What?" Benedict started forward, but the whiteness around him blazed into a dazzling radiance that blinded him. He cried out and felt himself falling.
"Lestrade's sending a car. Something that can't wait, apparently." Benedict slipped the phone back into his pocket.
"Wow." Tom got up and cleared the plates from the table. "I thought you were meant to be asexual, anyhow."
He couldn't.
They had this conversation every year. Either John's memory was going or Mary's choice of placement was totally arbitrary, because no matter that the mirror got a swag of lights every damned year, it never seemed to be in the same configuration. Swagged, draped, looped – he wished she'd do it herself. "Here?"
It wasn't fair, it wasn't fair, it wasn't fucking
He was no wilting flower.
"Still," the officer said pompously, and marched down the stairs.
"And I've got a boyfriend. It wouldn't be right. Even though –" She coloured more deeply. "Even though you think he's gay."
"Answer a question for me. Please."
was all.
"Erica."
"Yeah, she is. Not much different from what I remember."
As Sherlock slipped out of his coat, John caught a faint whiff of some nice-smelling cologne or aftershave, and saw that Sherlock's hair was just a bit damp. Heartened that Sherlock might have primped a bit himself, John hung the coat on a hook and gestured toward the front room. "Why don't you have a seat? I'll find a vase for these."
Not that he hadn't given it thought. And talked about it with Benedict, and seen the wistful expression in his eyes, but…it just wasn't the right time. Not yet.
"Well, that day –" John stopped and cleared his throat. His face flooded with colour. "A lot of times, especially round Christmas, the club bar and restaurant has dos – a lot of corporate functions, private parties, that sort of thing. And if it was a race meeting day, it might have been a membership-only bash. Lots of posh types abound then."
Then he thought about John Lennon. About that young actress on American television who was murdered by a stalker in the 80s. Other actors who'd got more than their share of threats.
"God," he muttered, and wiped his sweating forehead with his bare hand. If Cumberbatch had to endure that every day, Sherlock could almost feel sorry for him. No wonder he didn't have an Oyster card.
"Possibly. Or fled."
"Right, I'm having a bath." John looked at Benedict closely. "Sherlock…."
"I suppose you're going to tell me that this is your parents' network of SS friends."
"And?"
"A minor accident. I grabbed an exposed cable and got a jolt. It knocked me out for a bit."
He tried to shout for help, but someone planted a thick hand over his mouth and he was dragged into another car. His field of vision narrowed and greyed, and when he tried to fight, he was pinned and held and smothered, and his consciousness dimmed and faded altogether.
iffy. He had no idea of John Watson's true worth.
"It's going to be great," John repeated, and tousled her hair. Nora looked up and smiled at him, and he sat back, reassured, and stretched his legs. It
Not yet, though. Not quite yet.
She frowned at him, and he marvelled at how, when she was puzzled or angry or upset, she resembled him more than when she was smiling. Genetics was a funny lottery. "Nothing." She turned back to her programme and watched in silence.
Nora nodded again. "Yeah."
Molly sighed and looked at herself unhappily in the mirror. It
"Okay. I'm going to take the car."
"Oh, God, no catheters, please." Sherlock opened his eyes wide and gave the trio a beseeching stare. "Please. I can manage."
"Clearly you still haven't sorted out the meaning of diversionary tactics."
?" Sherlock straightened, scowling as his gown threatened to separate in the back. He clutched it closed. "Fictional?"
"Sherlock, are you sure you --
John opened the refrigerator and took out two bottle of Fuller's, handing one to Sherlock. "There you go."
Sherlock refrained from rolling his eyes – it was shockingly tiresome to have to play Benedict Cumberbatch, Glad-Hander and Public Arse-Kisser at all times. He swung himself up and offered the man a grin. His head swam. "Terribly sorry about that. I was feeling a bit faint and had to have a lie-down. It's not really on to fall asleep in the…."
The police officer was visibly annoyed. "There doesn't seem to be any foul play in evidence here. You can't just terminate a 999 call like that, Dr. Watson. Besides being cause for alarm and a clear sign of danger, it's a waste of resources. We're obliged to respond to hang-up calls, and that's time that could have been spent on actual emergencies." He gave both Benedict and John a look of withering scorn.
He sat and clicked on the telly.
He wasn't certain how he'd come to this. Every morning he awoke with a heart filled with anticipation, as if his sea of dreams and fancies had borne him closer to the horizon of some genuine excitement, but seconds after awakening, the truth dawned, and he realised where he was:  in bed, in a house, his wife and child nearby, an ordinary day ahead, a corridor of days behind closed doors that proved identical no matter which door he opened. And though he loved Mary and Nora fiercely (even though his fights with Mary made him furious) and he told himself he was content, his heart knew the truth.
"Give Ben my love, would you?"
John set Sherlock's tea on the table next to him. "I'd bet a hundred quid that you're overcompensating for your trick knee. Once you get that sorted you'll be back to normal."
"What do you – I mean, why are you doing this?" She gestured at the bag in his arms. "This, coming to my flat. You've never done that before."
Birdsong and a gentle, steady rainfall awakened him; he rolled over in the bed and saw grey light filtering through the curtains. The placid normality of the sounds and the dim, soothing illumination of morning lulled him for a moment. He might have been in his own bed, window open, a canopy of lush green surrounding him, luxuriating in softness and comfort for a few moments before jumping out of bed to begin a new day. It was amazing how much pleasure he derived from a few stolen minutes lately. There wasn't much time for being a slugabed.
"Who's there?" Sherlock called, startled by the crack in his voice. Christ, they'd drugged him with elephant sedatives or something. "Moran?" Probably Sebastian; likely Steenie was sleeping off his drug and drink cocktail.
"In the stories? The movies?"
The cabbie gazed at him with patient curiosity, waiting for him to speak. "Where to, sir?" she asked politely. Her accent was West African, Cote d'Ivoire if Sherlock wasn't mistaken.
Henry caught part of the tea towel and tugged, and it slithered out of Tom's mouth bit by bit around the rope keeping it in. Tom tried to push it out but realised it wasn't helping. He attempted to relax his throat and jaw and let Henry work it out of his mouth.
In a chilled, white room, a body bag lay on a table, smooth, black, ordinary bulges here and there. An attendant unzipped it briskly, revealing the body of Jim Moriarty, pale as milk, utterly still.
"Oh, for
"Think you might know this one," Lestrade said, and drew the blanket back.
Benedict had a reputation, one he wanted to keep, of being easy to work with, gracious, accommodating. He had a healthy respect for Steven and Mark's vision, and his questions and issues were usually resolved pleasantly. But there were times – now and then, just now and then – when something niggled. The problem of Irene Adler had niggled in a way he couldn't quite articulate, and to his frustration, he hadn't been able to make anyone really understand him, though he'd poured out an impassioned stream of words on the subject of Irene's morality.
"The guarantors earn fees whether or not the painting sells, correct?" Sherlock inquired.
Mycroft shook his head briefly and closed his eyes as if he were in pain. "Mr Cumberbatch, where is my brother?"
. I'll just start tidying up." He marched into the kitchen and bent to pick up the hot plate.
At that last, raw panic flooded Benedict's throat. It was too early, it was all wrong….
(See the end of the chapter for
“They have different lives, darling. They’re not two doddering oldies like we are.” Violet’s selective perception didn’t extend to her sons; she pushed past their patience and pressed her luck at all times, sometimes causing explosions. Thank God that Mycroft and Sherlock (Myc and Wills; to him they’d always be Myc and Wills in his heart if not on his lips) were essentially forgiving souls, though they’d both have denied it stoutly if confronted on the matter.
"Ah. Certainly. As I said, I'm glad to see you back." Mycroft twirled his umbrella in one hand, then nodded abruptly. "I'll be in touch. Good night, brother." He climbed into the rear seat of the car and closed the door.
Sherlock watched Moriarty ascend the staircase. He glanced round quickly, seeing the dull gleam of metal in one corner, an aluminium pipe. It would have to do. He torqued his arms in opposite directions, bearing down with all his strength, and strained his legs against the tape. For an instant it occurred to him that Moriarty might have a camera watching him even now, but he didn't care; surely it was a reasonable expectation that he might try to escape. "God, come on," he muttered, twisting harder.
John came up for air, red-faced and sweating. "Sherlock, I want…." He paused, clearing his throat. "I want to fuck you."
"Mm." Donovan blew a curl away from her face. "'Course you are."
"Now I've got a question for you. Where's that adorable moppet of yours?"
He attempted motion again, but the stabbing agony in his head forced him to stay still. Another inarticulate noise, this time of mingled pain and confusion, escaped him. Henry had attacked him in his own home, and now…now the rushing noise and the perception of movement made sense. He was in a car, on the floor, his face pressed against a scratchy carpet. Henry wasn't one for pranks, and if he had been, drugging was beyond the pale even for an extreme prank, so what the hell was going on?
"Yes?"
Sherlock sat up a bit. "Really?"
"A great deal of that art found its way back to its rightful owners," Moran said. "The violin was one of those pieces that unfortunately had no surviving owners to whom it might have been restored. Meredith Howe was instrumental in finding those families." He took a deeper drink. "She did important work."
---Benedict Cumberbatch, Sunday Times, The Fabulous Baker Street Boy. Oh, for
"Was it?" Maisie offered him a cool, prim smile and took one graceful step backward.
Mary set her fork down and stared. "You are?"
Henry's smile widened. "I'm sorry I wasn't there to hear that conversation. I've known those chaps all my life. They won't send anybody, you know. The police are our friends. Public servants. Reading about you, I'd have thought that you'd understand. Our sort flies beneath the radar. Hatch, match, and despatch, and God willing that's the only mention you'll ever see of me in the papers – and we've got our local police force to thank for that, in part." He bit his lip thoughtfully. "Well, I don't think 'match' is quite in the picture, but the single life has its compensations."
Sherlock grinned. "Good old Mycroft."
okay, though?"
"Sherlock."
Numb and sick at once, Benedict licked parched lips and slid his hands into his coat pockets.
God, it was Rupert's voice, yes, but a bit wearier, rougher, the accent a bit thicker than the one Rupert used. "Why?"
Too easy.
The sky was lilac, with grey drifting plumes of cloud, and John zipped up his cardigan against the cool air as he trotted toward home. He ascended the stairs and came into the flat to see Sherlock lying on the sofa, one arm crooked over his eyes, his jacket off and half-covering him. "Sherlock? You okay?"
"Like murdering people." Sherlock shrank further back in his chair. Slowly, he fumbled beneath his jacket and into his trousers, and with his fingertips located the edge of the knife and began to ease it upward. "Tom –" He winced and screwed his eyes shut again. "Tom said you'd killed his friend. And a fan."
Sherlock stared after her for a moment, then got to work, sifting through his prepped material and readying it for the spectrograph. He'd planned to spend the entire day in the lab, but as John was headed to Bart's, he'd have to change his plans, a not unpleasant prospect. He could organise and do some data collating while he waited. He picked up a plate with green silk fibres and contemplated it.
He wrenched his gaze from Sherlock's face and drummed his fingers on the table, then picked up the paper, only slightly spattered with cetacean moisture. He feigned interest in the Life section; he'd been gawping at Sherlock far too much lately, and the only reason Sherlock hadn't noticed was because he seemed totally immune to personal intimacy of any kind. "So why the lining in the syringe?"
"We'll have a word with him." Henry looked at his watch. "We'd better dash. His Nibs here is going to be late. Look here, tell Benedict we're sorry, would you? If we get to see him again, we'll tell him as well."
Kerstin Tresler moved to a pink slipper chair and sank into it. She tapped her ashes onto a chipped china plate. "You know I was born the year the war ended."
John gestured to a door. "In here." They went into a butler's pantry, denuded of its silver and serving implements and account books. A new-looking chest freezer sat against one wall, plugged into an elderly die-cast electrical outlet and humming quietly. John went to the freezer and lifted the lid. "Look."
"Penfield, sir. Phillip Penfield, manager of the clubroom." He shook Sherlock's hand vigorously. "A real honour to meet you. I'm a great fan of your work."
Deep inside, he felt a dry crack in his heart begin to mend.
"Sherlock, drop the case. I insist." Mycroft walked to the door. "I'll have the car brought round. Good night, little brother." He closed the door.
and to turn to see the object running to catch up, to learn more about the intriguing soul who'd suddenly and most unexpectedly captivated them.
---Still. Nasty.
"Not soon enough," Sherlock retorted. "And what about Nick Dedalus? Don't you think attention will turn your way?"
Sherlock ripped the last of the tape from his upper torso and spun the chair round, lifting it in his hands and bringing it crashing down on Henry's head. Henry slumped to the floor, unconscious. In a flash Sherlock grabbed for the tape and securely bound Henry's wrists and ankles, then put him in the same tight hogtie he'd endured. He shoved the wet, dirty cloth that had gagged TWH in Henry's mouth, then wound tape several times round his head. Satisfied, but already experiencing a pang of anticlimax, he leant back on his heels and regarded TWH's would-be murderer. "Incompetent arsehole," he muttered, and got to his feet. He turned to Tom. "Are you okay?"
"It was around noon," John said. "We were there for all of fifteen minutes." He looked at Benedict again and pressed his lips together.
Mycroft caught Sherlock's arm and pulled him up short. "Sherlock –"
Sherlock's eyes widened. "You killed him?"
"It doesn't add up," Sherlock said. "Why would she have that at the ready unless she knew about the aconitine? Then why poison her at all? And then she ran – no, John, I don't think it was Georgina."
Sherlock grasped the side rail of the bed and struggled up again. "You
"Actually, they closed the set down to investigate the electrical issue," Ben said, then his face puckered as if he'd bitten into a rotten piece of fruit.
." He stumbled backward and hit the opposite wall, his back scraping against a sharp picture-frame. His phone, where was his phone? He had to call the police.
"This should be adequate."
A metallic click sounded from near the front window. Sherlock froze.
"Pulmonary," John said, and took a sheaf of papers from her outstretched hand. "Thanks very much." He gave the paperwork a cursory glance and sighed. "That'll do, I suppose. I'm sorry to hear it. Sweet man, you know."
The coffee table in front of the sofa held the contents of Sherlock's text and their assorted methods of delivery. Mycroft eyed them with distaste and then examined Sherlock, who was insouciantly turning pages in his book –
“Bah humbug, eh?”
"I guess we've got a standoff," Moriarty said pleasantly.
"Kiss me?" TWH moved forward and kissed Sherlock on the lips, tracing his tongue round the inside of Sherlock's mouth. He pulled back and cupped the back of Sherlock's clay-ridden head. "See you tomorrow?"
" Moriarty shrieked. "Huh?" He jammed the weapon against John's temple. "What'd you do with him, you brainless little –" Abruptly, a white light illuminated them, and Moriarty stepped away, yanking John backward, his gun still propped against John's head.
"Like brother, like brother," John said. "He'd never manage with your homeless network, though. They'd probably jam that brolly up his arse."
Mary took the Smith and Wesson out of her jacket and set it on the table. "Take that." She turned and ran lightly down the cellar stairs once more and had a look at the C4. There was no telling if she had enough time to set up discreetly placed detonation points, and the stuff was stable enough that shots fired into it wouldn't set it off – besides, she didn't want to trap herself and Sherlock, either. She threw aside a canvas tarp and found the crate with disassembled Kalashnikovs, untouched since her last visit. That wouldn't bring the entire Derry police force screaming down on their heads, would it?
What melodrama. Benedict opened his eyes again and saw Sherlock crouching over him, wearing his favourite grey t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. There was a huge bruise on his cheek, spreading up toward his eye. Benedict frowned. "Uh."
Sherlock stopped.
Sherlock drew a shuddering breath. "It's at my flat."
"Where do you want this?" Benedict indicated the bag in his arms.
"Where's the PA? Georgina?"
As instructed, John stood close to Sherlock as Sherlock swiped the purloined card over the digital reader. The light blinked green, and the glass door unlocked with a click and a hiss. They strode through, John almost tripping on Sherlock's heels, and made for the lift, getting in with a bevy of laughing young men and women. "What do you know about him?" John murmured. "Dedalus?"
"Well, you're no fun." Moriarty said with a pout, and took another hobnob. "But okay. Thing is, Sherlock, I'm not best pleased with you."
Then there was the problem of Tom, rather more pressing than Sherlock had originally thought. He had to admit that though he hadn't done badly – at least Tom hadn't seemed unduly suspicious, being of ordinary, that was to say,
"Goodbye," he said softly, and then added, "my love."
He gazed at the latest text again.
"Good. It's good." Molly averted her eyes and touched the edge of a pale-purple agapanthus. "Jim, I'm actually sort of glad that you stopped by. I need to talk with you."
"You fool," Moran murmured.
"She was always sweet. She never asked many questions." Again, that hitching, quivery laugh. "Oh, fuck." Mary wrapped her arms around John and rested her head on his shoulder. John held her close and kissed her hair. She squeezed him tighter; he took it as an invitation and kissed her again. Mary raised a tear-streaked face to his. "John, this is…awful, but would you…would you…." She kissed his mouth, first tentatively, then fiercely. Her hands fumbled at the buttons of his cardigan.
"Yeah, last one was a no-show."
"Violence committed by family, friends, or acquaintances isn't at all uncommon," Sherlock said. The first time he'd been kidnapped (he had, by his own count, been abducted or taken hostage sixteen times) the perpetrators had been one of Mycroft's colleagues, hoping to glean information entrusted to Mycroft, specifically locations of missile sites in Pakistan to sell to interested and remunerative parties. Aged fifteen, snatched away from his room at college whilst revising for a chemistry exam and bundled into an ancient Volvo, he'd languished in a tiny room in Sheffield for almost four days before he'd been rescued. He recalled being frightened, but after the initial fear, he'd begun to catalogue facts, and during the phone call they'd allowed him, he'd managed to surreptitiously deliver enough clues to Mycroft for rescue to come a day and a half later. The colleague had been rounded up, drugged, and quietly and summarily dispatched to Pakistan with the information sewn into the lining of his jacket where, acting upon an anyonymous tip, the authorities discovered him trying to re-cross the border. What happened afterward was, Mycroft told Sherlock, simply the appropriate punishment for a kidnapper and a traitor. It just proved that one really couldn't trust anybody. "At least you managed to escape."
"Not staying for dessert? It's lemon chiffon cake with Chantilly crème."
Like a magician performing a particularly clever trick, Benedict brought his hands from behind his back with a flourish.
"John, you've got to say something to him."
Sherlock tossed off a graceful, indifferent shrug. "No bother. I'll manage." He clasped his hands behind his back and squeezed them together, tightly enough to hurt. "Got your Christmas card. Thanks for that."
rub your eyes."
He’d been so cold and cerebral when they’d met. It was the allure of the unattainable, wasn’t it? He hadn’t shown interest in anyone in a personal way. But then John had come, and the pair of them were thick as thieves, instant flatmates and constant companions. Had they ever…?
, did he? He didn't know her at all.
it was the homeless network. Who better than invisible citizenry to watch the comings and goings of the great and would-be great? Addresses given at docking bays, loose talk in back alleys, illicit tips – you never have given them enough credit."
"Yeah, I'm fine. You?"
plot had become a complete wash, he was still protesting too much.
John leant over. "How much petrol have we got left?"
A bit of digging revealed that his iteration of Sherlock Holmes was the most popular one on the archive – and rightly so, obviously – but he spent a few minutes marvelling over the differences of the different men who'd played Sherlock Holmes. The very lean and severe man from the black-and-white films with the ridiculous coat and hat – honestly, could one be more obvious and melodramatic? And that Watson was terribly bumbling and stupid; he wouldn't have lasted a day in the real world. Then there was the television version with the rather good-looking older fellow and a Watson who was marginally brighter. Then there was the scruffy Holmes with the large dark eyes and the handsome and sharp-tongued Watson – now there was a Watson to reckon with, though not a patch on
"Mum said he didn't mean to kill Sherlock anyway, just scare him."
"Yeah, I'm pretty good at diagnosing by smell," John said. "What's that?"
16 December 2019
"That's my boy." The arms unwound themselves from his upper body, and there was the brief shriek of wood against concrete, a chair. A hand brushed up his face, then tugged the blindfold down.
"He's pretty methodical, actually. He pays the bills, does all the budgeting. I mostly just give him cash for the rent and utilities and tax and stuff. It's worked so far."
"Until someone removed her from the equation. You? Your brother? What did she do that was so threatening, Lord Moran?"
far off. "It was an accident." Sherlock did his best not to glare, but for one of the first times in his life, he was flummoxed, and the sight of this fraud in his poncy clothes and shoulder bag, wearing John Watson's face and talking in John Watson's voice was nigh on unbearable.
"Yes?"
"I thought it'd work faster," Henry said.
"Yes." Mycroft leant back in his chair, folding his hands and crossing one leg over the other. He gazed at John. "Very distinct."
"You always seem out of sorts," John said. He stared at Benedict, and let out a derisive little laugh. "Christ, I'm so fucking stupid. Let's just forget about it, yeah? Let go." He struggled to break Benedict's grip.
"Yes, I am. Get out of the way, I'll do it. Switch places with me." She held up the boxwood garland.
Martin sighed. "Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing, is having you on. Off with the apron and sit on the sofa before you fall down. Can't think why you'd do an arse-ended – never mind, scratch that. Come on, you're staring and it's starting to get weird."
Mycroft scowled. "I hardly think I need to."
The production assistant, fresh out of film school and still very much beglamoured, sidled up to Benedict and cleared her throat. "Mr. Cumberbatch, they said you're all through. Can you sign off on this?"
"An hour, no more."
Tom had made the leap; no point in going back now.
Not entirely inconvenient, come to think of it.
"No, I…I think I'll just meet you at the train, or the airfield, or whatever. Erm, text me the details."
Sherlock smiled. "I don't recall many extravagances on your part. And you did always worry about money. Perhaps 'miserly' is a better word."
"They'll evacuate," Sherlock said. "The news will spread fast. It'll be viral within ten minutes."
"I think it suits you," Sherlock said, and let her hand go. He returned to the task of getting the cork out of the bottle, succeeding just as Mary emerged from the kitchen with a plate of warmed bread. "Nicked this from Mycroft's cellar. He'll never miss it." He poured wine into glasses and handed them to Mary and John.
"But not broken," Jim murmured.
She turned even whiter, but said nothing.
"I reckon it could." Benedict started to walk again. "So was she arrested, the Clarence House Cannibal?"
"You made this bed," Tom said sharply. "You deserve to lie in it."
"Sherlock, you going to solve this one?"
Mycroft refrained from a sigh of impatience. They knew each other well enough to dispense with prevarication. "He's got a soft spot for you. Find him."
"That's –" John shook his head and smiled. "No, I didn't."
Research, for one thing. He'd never delved into temporal/spatial anomalies, but there had to be some evidence out there, somewhere, something he could put to practical use. If he couldn't work it out immediately, he could at least gather data.
The man stretched his arm out. The star-shaped bore of the suppressor yawned, waiting to discharge. "Don't dawdle. Right now."
to address him so familiarly."
Order something."
“Sod it,” he muttered, and picked up the phone.
"Now, everything's changed."
"You're interested in someone else."
"You fucked Mark in the loo." Tom let a little animosity pour out.
"No, I'm fine." Sherlock's eyes were already closed.
Henry stared awhile more, then moved forward, scraped at the edge of the tape covering Sherlock's mouth, and ripped it off.
"Where have you been, incidentally?"
"How is Mary? And Nora?"
"I know. That's why I'm waking you up. Come on, sit up, would you?" John laid out his impromptu kit – thermometer, stethoscope, and blood pressure cuff, all generously lent by Dr Majumdar. "It won't take a minute – then you can go back to sleep," he coaxed, hooking the scope round his neck.
"No, let's eat." Benedict shucked his jacket and tossed it over the back of a chair, then dropped onto the sofa.
"He said your responses were a bit on the slow side."
As if he'd expected Sherlock to come dashing after him – well, it wasn't entirely out of character. But too much time had elapsed, too much had happened.
," Mark said. "And he doesn't show any signs of slowing down. I don't know where you get your energy."
"Oh, they're a fantastic team," Sherlock said, sitting back and crossing his legs. "I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I've just got a few items here, and it would really add incredible texture to my work to know that I was getting the process exactly right." Sherlock lifted the bin bag into his lap and patted it gently.
"No problem." He went to replace the lid and noticed something crushed at the bottom of the box. Frowning, he pulled it out. "The hell…?" He recognised it all at once, and couldn't quite get his breath to say anything else.
"Well, that's pretty. Wait." John thumbed beneath the dress. "How much – how many dresses did she buy?"
Only a few moments ago, he'd just seen his exact double wearing what looked like one of his suits and having a panic attack. At first he'd thought he was having some sort of momentary reaction, a neurological response to electric shock, complete with tactile hallucination. Then he'd thought perhaps it was hallucinogen persisting perception disorder – he'd consumed enough MDMA, mescaline, and psilocybin over the years to make it at least a remote possibility.
Sherlock had carefully folded up the letter and tucked it behind the cover of his battered copy of
Evidently this woman and Cumberbatch were acquainted, if her excessive familiarity was any indication of acquaintance. "I was busy last night."
"Ha," John said sourly. "I had a footballer for a patient, solid, muscular bloke, who had one of those injections, insisted on walking home and did just that. Vasovagal syncope – it happens. He went arse over tit and broke his arm and dislocated his shoulder. If Mycroft's not planning to be there, I am. The last thing you need is a broken wing. You're already a grouchy bastard, can't imagine you with two debilitating but non-life-threatening injuries at the same time."
And he would be. Of course he would be. Sherlock might joke about being indestructible, but John couldn't envisage a world in which Sherlock was permanently sidelined by an injury. Funny though – more than a few times over the past four years he'd come across some exploit of Sherlock's in the tabloids and muttered darkly to himself, or to Mary. "Surprised he hasn't had his head bashed in yet." "Probably end up with a broken neck carrying on like that, silly nutter." Et cetera, et cetera. It wasn't that he'd really wanted Sherlock hurt – it was his own bruised ego talking, indignant that Sherlock had seemed to get on just fine without him.
off guard, if that day ever happened. And he might tell him about Mark Gatiss as well. He'd see about that. "Thanks. For this."
. "Arsehole."
A sudden hot, irrational burst of red-tinged anger flared in Benedict's vision. He could take a joke – Martin had pranked him often enough that he'd become accustomed to it, and accepted it with relative grace, but he'd just had enough for now. He tried to struggle to his feet. "It's
Nora's eyes watched him intently. "Are you in trouble too?"
John's eyes narrowed, and his posture suddenly went ramrod straight. "What do you mean,
"If that sort of thing matters to you."
One day last autumn, he and Tom had gone out for lunch, just a casual, relaxed sort of thing with no handlers, no entourage, and no expectations. Tom had kept his knee pressed to Benedict's the entire time, and while it hadn't been candlelight and violins, it had been lovely, an exploration from the warm and slightly shy camaraderie they'd shared filming
"Sherlock –"
"Among other politically inclined organisations."
asexual, anyhow? The real question was:  how did Sherlock feel about John? Benedict found himself intensely curious about this, and pondered it, taking out bits of evidence from the programme and examining them.
“Are you back in therapy?”
Benedict grinned. "Cluedo?"
Sherlock's peripheral vision caught Graham's furious stare. "No. I'm famished. I really think I need to eat."
John glanced up. "Say again?"
He couldn't say that. He didn't want to make John angry, not for the short duration of time that they had together. And considering the past few days, he didn't want to take any action that might result in a horrible ripple effect. If he pushed, who knew but that John might decide that moving out was the best thing to do?
"Yeah." John turned to glare at Moriarty's grinning mug. "Last time we met, you strapped me into five kilos of Semtex. Sorry if your feelings are hurt." He turned back to offer the beaker to Sherlock. "How's your head?"
"Ew," Nora said.
was doing wonderfully well, he was pleased with their scenes, and both his and Tom's dockets were bursting at the seams. They were hot, and getting hotter, and they intended to ride the wave as long as possible, to spend sensibly, and to choose their projects with care. They weren't out; there were still too many complications for that. But it was okay. Maybe someday. Maybe.
"This way." Sherlock moved down the damp stone corridor with its rows of identical doors.
"I'm not fucking listening to his shite," Moran said. He plucked a white silicone gag from the wall and strode to Sherlock. "Open your fucking mouth."
"No."
From what seemed very far above Benedict's head, there was a hissing sigh, and the fingers twined in his hair pulled even tighter, eliciting a stifled cry. "Don't waste my time with the obvious."
No, it wasn't the ground. It was grey stone, or tile of some kind. A floor. And he was leaning against a wall. But there was a breeze, and above them, a darkening sky. His head swimming, Benedict blinked hard and looked around. He saw the Old Bailey. The Barbican. Smithfield Market. Familiar rooftops all. The sound of distant traffic drifted upward, seeming to coil lazily around his head and then disappearing.
Guthrie dialled up his smile. "That's correct. It's common practice, as you say."
"Depends on the person. Usually anywhere from three to six months. If it's not effective, I'll consider surgery, but let's try some non-invasive treatments first." She went to her tablet and made some notations. "Setting up the scrips now, and we can likely get you in for the injection in a few weeks. Have you got someone who can escort you home that day, stay with you for a few hours afterward?"
He went upstairs, shed his clothes, and stepped into the shower, luxuriating under the powerful spray. He shampooed his hair, digging his fingertips into his scalp – even the air felt dirtier here – and took up one of those puffy net things to scrub his body with some bright, peppery-smelling body wash.
"I heard a bit," Benedict said. "Your stalker."
"Drop it –" Not good. Had Mycroft decided to pursue the matter on his own – Christ, did he know about Mary after all? What had he meant by Mary being set up to meet John? He'd ask, but he didn't want to alert Mycroft to any other statistical anomalies – maybe he'd unearthed another Magnussen connection Sherlock had missed the first go-round. No, he couldn't allow that to happen. "I can't drop it, Mycroft. I'm too close. I can have all this sorted within the week."
"Sherlock."
Reaching into his pocket, he found his phone and pulled it out.
"Oh, you'll tell him, but you won't tell me. I see."
Molly stepped in, dragging the rolling case behind her. "Hm."
The answer to that came in a wonderful, familiar voice.
They nodded their concurrence and left.
"Wait!"
"What about stuff hanging on the walls already?"
," Benedict snarled. He felt like crying. He and Martin had always got along like a house on fire, but this was…cruel, on top of his hallucination. Multiverse, his arse. Too much, even for a prank. "It's not funny anymore."
Benedict nodded. "That's right."
"I might have done," John said, and shook his head again. "I can't – this is just too weird, I'm sorry."
"I was going to go back to Cardiff."
"Seven." John hitched Nora's bag over his shoulder.
"Shut your fucking mouth, Tom." Henry knelt beside Tom and pushed him onto his stomach. He grabbed Tom's arms, pulled his wrists together, and wound the rope round them, then tied them off in the middle.
John, his arm round Nora's shoulders, looked up. "Thought you'd gone."
Sherlock could scarcely summon a coherent thought.
and managed another groan.
Gosh.
Benedict shook his head. "Cleverness only gets you so far." He had to raise his voice above the sound of an approaching helicopter.
"Look, I admit it – I'm…puzzled about this as well." The man took out a cigarette of his own and lit it. He smoked in silence for a moment, and exhaled through his nostrils. "There's no data –" He glanced at the white walls, the pristine floor. "Nothing that indicates what might have happened. Except that you got an electrical shock as well."
“Oh, what’s wrong, love? Wet bottom?” John lifted her out of the crib. “Christ, you’re warm.” He felt her forehead and her cheeks. Decidedly warm, like far too many of the babies he’d seen at the surgery just lately. “Right, okay. Calpol.” He took her into the loo and fished the bottle and thermometer out of the cabinet, then prepared the syringe as quickly as he could, trying to balance Rosie in one arm and soothe her feeble cries. “It’s okay, baby, it’s okay.” He sat on the edge of the tub and supported Rosie on his lap. “Open wide. Ahhh….” He demonstrated, managing to capture Rosie’s attention. “Come on. Ahhh….”
"'Night, Ben."
All the colour had gone out of Moriarty's face. He got to his feet. "I'm going to fuck the entire
"Half seven-ish."
The man rose heavily to his feet. "All you have to do is drop the case, Mr Holmes, and I won't bother you again. But if I have to, I don't mind telling you there's a lot of money in it for me." He went to the door. "Give me a head start before you yell for help."
"Well, clearly she's got great taste in men." Sherlock nailed a smile to his face.
"Yeah, it's, er, Ormonde," Sherlock said. He'd picked it out of a collection in Cumberbatch's loo. Not really a fragrance-wearer, he'd still scoffed at the practise of keeping fragrance in a loo – even in a closed cabinet, worst possible place to store it.
"I've got to go to work tomorrow," John said, and saw Sherlock's scowl intensify. "But I've got loads of time stacked up. I can take a short holiday. Fann will be amazed."
"Certainly." Sherlock spread his hands wide. "Who hasn't?"
There was some murmured conversation at the fore, and then the high whine of the entry door. John sighed and took another sip of his water. He'd bet that they'd be on the tarmac for two hours at least. But it was better, he reminded himself, than going through a load of airport nonsense.
Benedict gasped a little as the gates opened, and they drove through silently, past red-coated guardsmen, past black-clad security detail, past stone edifices that he'd only seen distantly or on television.
"They'll be back," Sebastian said, not moving from the window.
"Sherlock. Shut up. Please." John rubbed his eyes.
"Ha. Not a chance."
"I'm trying to read," John snapped.
Greg examined the picture of a young Mycroft, slightly softer around the face and with more hair, but looking essentially the same. His expression was serious, and he wore the academic gown over a suit. “God, do you always wear a suit? Did you wear one as a tot?”
And then, she thought:
John slid into his seat and gave Benedict a little half-smile. "Getting a bit busy."
Drawing a shuddering breath, he turned his head. "Oh my God. Tom."
John was about to ask him if he wanted to bill for his valuable time, but refrained. Just. "That's kind of you. Come on, sweets." Hand in hand, he and Nora headed for the Tube. "You could have phoned, Nora. Borrowed a friend's phone or something." He and Mary had gone back and forth about getting her a mobile. She was nine – all right, almost ten – and it just seemed too early. Mary had contended that it was a necessary thing, and maybe she was right after all.
"Oh. Something in the information Mycroft texted me, some tip from one of his minions. You know Mycroft, leave no stone unturned, no matter what sort of insects are crawling underneath." Benedict sat back, stunned with himself.
"'Night." Tom disappeared down the corridor.
For a moment Sherlock's façade slipped and he couldn't answer for the knot in his throat that constricted his speech. He clasped his hands between his knees. "Well, John's back at 221B working on a really important case right now."
"Mm."
Benedict kept still and silent, not daring to look at John who was by now decidedly stirring to full consciousness. He registered John's sudden thrashing as he realised he was bound, and his angry, muffled grunts, but didn't turn his head. Showing concern could prove John's undoing.
"Yeah, I didn't –" John sighed. "Look, it was an accident. I told them that when they phoned back."
Sherlock blew a breath out and stuck his fingers in his hair, ruffling it vigorously. "God." He pushed Benedict to his stomach and began fiddling with something. "Wire. Good lord, what on earth's wrong with cable ties?"
Sherlock's gaze fell upon a painting over the mantel, a rendering of the old Battersea Bridge. It wasn't extraordinary in any particular detail, but the bluish-yellow colouring of it, the composition, and the mood were vaguely soothing, and its size made it a perfect counterpoint to the heaviness of the carved mantel. Mycroft had chosen and placed it well.
"We're observing her for inconsistencies. Dr Kelly and I agree that five hours will be a sufficient period of observation, but given her injuries, I don't think we're wrong." Her hand was on his arm again, warm and soft. "Her records indicate that she's an organ and tissue donor."
"Fine." Sherlock was peering right at him, his expression only mildly curious.
"More clothes."
"It wasn't good."
He strode to the door and rang the bell.
"Very well," Mycroft replied. "Did you learn anything else at the racecourse?"
Skipping and holding John's hand, Nora considered the options. "Can't we have kebabs?"
"Okay, okay. I can make restitution to John. Jeez. It wasn't as if you were crazy about her, Sherlock." Moriarty uttered another giggle. "Look, you're not still peeved over the beating? God, it couldn't have hurt that much. You look fine."
"Trish's lawyer called me this morning, and said that the transfer of funds should be complete by early next week. Faster than he expected, obviously."
"I said try to call tonight. Nora will want to speak with you."
"Yep."
Sherlock frowned in puzzlement. South Africa? Oh, of course, the carjacking thing. A whole two-hour ordeal. Again, this was probably not the optimal time to remind TWH that he wasn't Benedict Cumberbatch. "Maybe," he said cautiously.
John ducked his head and then grinned at Sherlock again. "Yeah, it is a bit."
"No, but she didn't rush to get rid of the painting, did she? And surely she couldn't have been totally unaware of its provenance." He stopped at a door and knocked loudly. "She's probably deaf."
"Mr. Cumberbatch? Are you all right?"
"I think she's got quite a bit more to tell us." Sherlock drove in silence for some time, then pulled up to the dingy row of flats. He glanced at John. "You've got crumbs on your chin."
"Boring?"
"I can't," Guthrie whispered. "I'd be sacked, or worse."
"No." Mycroft hesitated. "No. All of her transactions involved an exchange of goods for currency."
Sherlock sighed. "I've been meaning to go to Lord Moran's and poke around a bit. Are you game?"
he manage to procure cabs more quickly than other people? Odd.
"Not you. Me."
"It's all right." Sherlock's wounds were beginning to hurt again. They were giving him pain pills every four hours, but they weren't quite as effective as he'd have liked. "John – maybe we should have Mary airlifted back to England. If she –"
Benedict couldn't read her face. She seemed sad, but…was she upset that they hadn't gone further? Regretful that they'd progressed as far as they had? Guilty because of Jim? He hadn't a fucking clue. "You know, in another life, we'd probably be fantastic and smouldery together."
"Now!" Moriarty screamed, and lunged.
"Don't worry about it." He offered Mary a smile. "Want any help with dinner?"
Maybe it was just as well. He really was in pain. He'd go home, put away the plates and cutlery and napkins and all the folderol he'd set out and eat some of the stuff Angelo had sent over, and maybe one of the little patisseries from the French bakery that had delivered an assortment of pretty treats. And then he'd set aside the package he'd wrapped in stiff iridescent purple paper for Nora's birthday, a compound microscope, easy to use, but well-constructed and sturdy enough to stand up to whatever a ten-year-old child could visit upon it. Probably she wouldn't want gifts at the moment anyhow.
1 April 2010; 2:00 a.m.
John was scrutinising him carefully. Benedict arranged a superior smile on his face and reminded himself that he couldn't let his guard down – John Watson was no fool, otherwise Sherlock wouldn't have suffered his presence. "Oh, come on, John. She was obviously smitten with me."
She led Mycroft through the corridor, into a library, mercifully deserted, and from there into a smaller room fitted with a little William and Mary writing cabinet and two leather chairs. She seated herself, her long autumn-green dress rustling as she crossed her legs.  The pointed tip of one green shoe poked out from the hem. "Well?"
"God damn it!" Benedict hammered on the wood until he thought he'd splinter it. "John, open the fucking door!"
"Just a guess."
"John's been arrested for murder, Mrs H."
"I'm not making demands, John." It wasn't a difficult thing to say, even if it wasn’t the truth. Better to enjoy temporary bliss whilst they could. How long could he lie? Months, years? And when would Mary realise what was happening?
"Let me go, for fuck's sake –"
John tamped down a surge of anger at Mycroft's sangfroid. "So you spent ten years sitting on the knowledge that he was alive the whole time? And you didn't do a goddamned thing about it? Did you even bother to tell Sherlock?"
Slowly, cautiously, Benedict took his arm away from his face and sat up, squinting through tears. Christ, the light was almost pure white, like football stadium halogens. There was a mottled blur about two metres away, a vaguely human shape. "Who's that?" No answer came from the figure, so he rubbed his eyes to clear them. God, couldn't they turn the light off? He drew his knees up and stared down at the dark wool of his trousers to soothe his eyes. "It's not funny," he muttered, then looked at the figure, who was also sitting on the floor. "Holy
"I'm sure Mycroft can organise that for you," Sherlock said. "Or maybe straight to Fentanyl, Mycroft?"
"Nothing. Nothing that matters." Irene sighed. "It's a pity, though. We could have been brilliant together, the pair of us." She turned back to Kate. "Take care of the house. And wait for my call." She slid a hand up Kate's thigh until she reached an encumbrance of leather and steel. "Don't you dare take it off, darling. If you do…if you are that naughty…I
It probably should have made him happy.
The proposition was mildly interesting, but that was all. "Oh?"
Eurus had shrugged.
"Well," John said, and smiled. "I saw Sherlock."
"Who?"
Sherlock back-buttoned quickly, but couldn't help the minuscule sensation of triumph that pervaded him.
"It's okay. You'll clear this up." John gave Benedict a warm look, full of affection and trust.
"No, I – I'm sorry. You're right, there
Carefully, Benedict set the phone on the coffee table next to the doctor's bag. "I need the loo," he whispered, and stalked into the hallway. He paused and pushed a door open.
"Fine. Yes, I told some intrusive moron to piss off. It's ridiculous and more than slightly surreal that actors get so much attention. For
," Benedict said. "You've got looks, moderate intelligence, and probably loads of cash socked away. If I were you, I'd gather up as much cash as you can carry and leave while you can. If I'm not very much mistaken, there are going to be a few CIA operatives here in an hour or so, and they'll want this. Fortunately, I'm just patriotic enough to be glad that we got it first."
Mary exhaled loudly. "You be careful."
"Mind palace?"
Sherlock smirked. "Don't let him hear you say that."
"It'll lengthen your lifespan, just a wee bit." Moriarty returned the smile. "Told you I was going to kill you someday, didn't I?"
"I'm sure you didn't. And I'm sure Eamonn didn't use your particular knowledge unless he absolutely had to. You did tell him about it, didn't you? Where was your father's stash?"
Sherlock frowned. "Your house, or –" He stumbled as Melville shoved him out with a great deal of strength for a man his size, and turned his ankle on the stone steps. He felt his knee give way again, but grabbed the short balustrade, just managing to keep from face-planting onto the ground.
John and Nora read from
"He's not in town. She's just come in, and she's staying at the Dorchester – there was a key card from the hotel in her handbag and a train ticket in her pocket next to the keys. The wallet in her bag was thin, so she's not a saver of receipts and tickets and so on, and the ticket itself was relatively unwrinkled, therefore it's likely that it was recent. We can find her later if we need her. She's doing him a favour of some kind, picked up a note or letter from his house. On Lord Moran's stationery. That's what she was stuffing into her bag along with her own notepaper."
"Not at all. Do you remember when I said we'd turn off that machine there?" The nurse pointed to the ventilator.
Then the bitter irony of his concern struck him.
"Not precisely. Those
." Moriarty gestured around the flat. "I don't mean money, really, or material acquisition – I know all that doesn't mean much to you. Can I make a guess? Do you mind?"
No-one else spoke. The only sound was the electronic and digital whirring of multiple pieces of equipment.
"Shut up," the gunman covering John snarled.
The taxi driver got a call on his mobile, and Benedict distracted himself by looking out the window. Mycroft lived very near Hyde Park, and it was comforting to see the familiar sights pass by; it was like his London again, on any fine summer day.
"Yeah." Henry sounded breathless. "Too soon." He walked away.
"Previous experience."
A ragged sigh shuddered out of his throat and he felt the prickle of tears. He couldn't accept it. There had to be a way back.
"Fine." Mycroft rolled his eyes and rose to his feet. "I'll have your things moved at once. I'm going back to London. Going forward, I expect situation reports, Sherlock."
"So what specific places did the money lead to?" Sherlock tensed and relaxed again. Patience; hurrying would get him nowhere fast.
!" Sherlock twisted fruitlessly. The hands held him nearly motionless.
John scouted rapidly for a usable weapon. He saw the creepy Nazi box still on the bed and opened it, wincing as he thrust his hand inside. His hand closed around something smooth and cylindrical – a fountain pen, carved with sort of Art Nouveau swirls and emblazoned with an SS death's head. Charming. He uncapped it, crouched on the floor beside the bed, and yanked up the blue bedskirt.
"Moriarty, yes, we've established that. Is John with you?"
"Well. Apparently she followed the transactions, the different institutions of deposit, and realised that they led to some very specific places. And then she was dumb enough to ask me about them." Moriarty clicked his tongue. "Not very bright."
. Oh, God, poor John! He was probably having Cumberbatch committed at this very moment.
"Don't," Mary said sharply. "I can't stand it when you're self-pitying. You see what you want to see, John – you always have. And don't be a hypocrite. You've been lying to me as long as we've known each other."
This was something else:  a deliberate taunt. Why now, though?
Mycroft didn't deign to respond.
Sherlock's face softened for a moment, then slid back into its cold, impervious mask. "Did Mycroft sort everything out?"
"Will do!" Sherlock rounded the corner, hovering under the awning of a posh-looking flower shop where a fine curtain of mist bedewed a huge bunch of drowsy cream-coloured peonies in the window.
His leg hurting – it had been hurting for a few months now, and he'd decided that it would go away if properly ignored, but it hadn't, not yet at least – John hurried to the main gate. He could all but feel Sherlock's gaze boring into his back, but he wouldn't turn, not for a million quid.
"She didn't pine." Sherlock took in a bracing lungful of smoke. "She went briskly and without a fuss."
Sebastian Moran laughed. "I could have shot you when you opened the door."
– and accepted his food. He'd taken on even more of a ponderous demeanour in the past few years, and the knighthood was likely part of it. Doubtless he'd go on serving in His Majesty's Government until he was kicking up daisies, and he'd grow more pompous and obnoxious with each passing year, and he'd probably be a life peer and holder of some order titles as well at the end of it all. But then Mycroft always had relied on external motivation. A very insecure man, was Mycroft Holmes.
I don’t know if he told you that, Sherlock. But he did, he sat there with me for the next two hours waiting for your operation to be done. We didn’t say much to each other. Mycroft inquired about Kylie and I told him that she was doing fine. He nodded and made some comment about stopping off to see her one day, and you, if he had the time. The conversation ended there.
‘I thought that Lestrade was on vacation. How could he leave you a case?’ I was confused, and a bit angry.
They stared at each other for who knows how long. It seemed like time never passed when they were in the company of each other. Both of the men found each other in their darkest moments, and neither could really explain nor tell the other just how grateful they are for meeting each other all those years ago.
He took a quick look at John and then back at Sherlock.
‘No, Lara told us and we understand. How did it go?’ I asked her, careful to show my eagerness.
John was a bit irritated now. The Doctor had a nasty habit of running off.
"Oi, what number are we at now, mate?"
He led John over to the empty bed and then pulled out his sonic screwdriver.
Sherlock looks angry, but not with John. “Don’t…I hit you. I saw the bruises when we were getting dressed.”
John nodded.
“So, how was your night?”
You wanted to know more about her, you made that face.
Holmes's brain was moving faster than John could handle.
“She was getting older, and her joints…they didn’t work so well. She was cleaning the walls on the top of the steps one day and…as she was making her way back down here, her knee gave out, she fell down and…her neck…it snapped….”
The idea came to his head while he was at work. Sherlock didn’t come by to have lunch with him because Rosie was already down for her afternoon nap, and neither of the men wanted to risk her sleep cycle being interrupted, and in turn ruining theirs at night. Still, John couldn’t help but stare at the door, thinking about eating with Sherlock again. He came with Rosie because she couldn’t be alone, obviously, but he wanted to be greedy with Sherlock, and to take him out properly instead of movie nights in with a crying baby. He knew that Sherlock was being kind, but he was sure that even Sherlock thought about a night for themselves, one that didn’t involve just sex and then sleep. Well, that could be included in the night, but that shouldn’t be the only time they get to be alone together.
“What do I do now?”
“Mine is weak, John won’t let me have a full-fledged chemistry set, but that doesn’t stop me from keeping a few tubes and beakers around, for cases, that is.”
John just smiled and stroked her hair. Maybe he would take her to get a hair-cut, he needed one too. That could probably be their first daddy-daughter outing. He pressed a kiss to her forehead and rested his lips there. She smelt like the vanilla scented body wash she insisted on him buying. He wasn't worthy of being her father. She deserved another family, someone better than himself.
“That’s enough of that.” he croaked. He put her clothes on and then took her to his and John’s room so that he could get dressed. If he wanted to make it on time for lunch, he would have to skip on the shower. Maybe he would have a bath with John today. He changed quickly and gave a brief smile to the baby who was sat on the bed, playing with the string of his robe. He picked her up and tickled her stomach.
“James, who?”
"Thanks."
“Please?”
Just him, Sherlock, and Rosie now. In the comfort of 221B, their home.
“Nothing much, Holmes, but I’m…I’m happy for them.”
"I am thinking about her. This...this helps me calm down, Sherlock, it helps me think better. I...It's my way of coping."
The Doctor thought, and he thought quickly because there wasn't much time to spare. They couldn't keep their eyes open for much longer, and if any of them were to blink, they would be sent to a different time and would never be able to return again.
John was still puzzled and all he could do was nod. Watson smiled.
They both whipped their right hand around to find that they were both pointing a revolver at each other. They tried to hide their face from Moriarty but they both saw the look in each others’ eyes. . Their fingers were being forced by an unknown power to the triggers, no matter how much they fought it. It was inevitable.
"Sherlock, are you alright, answer me!"
You shook your head and the faint smile returned to your soft, pale lips.
His mouth opened up. Good start, he thought. Sherlock uncrossed his arms and pushed himself off of the counter. He was awaiting John's response which was the same thing John was doing too.
The morning after.
“Please, what’s your name?”
He couldn't comfort her like she probably wanted her to. God knows that he wasn't the person for that. He snaked his arm around her waist, just to let her know that he could sympathize with her.
“Have you heard the good news, Watson? About our counter-parts, that is.”
Kylie nodded.
He found himself doing that on most days. Sometimes he even wondered if Watson was doing the same with him. A small part of him, a very small part, secretly wished that he was.
‘What about him? She told me that he was nowhere to be found once he heard news of the pregnancy. But from what I do know, he’s at least twenty-five years of age.’
"Doctor..."
‘Not at all, I’m just…a girl…that’s nice.’
"EXTRA EXTRA, READ ALL ABOUT IT!"
John always felt his ego lift a bit whenever he was called doctor or captain. It made him feel good, just like how Sherlock feels whenever he calls him brilliant or amazing. John responded in a curt nod.
‘J-John?’ You managed to get out. I smiled. You looked so vulnerable and that was a rare sight. Your chest was bare, revealing the dark hairs covering it. You were breathing slowly.
‘Oh so you’re a marriage counselor now?’ I retorted. ‘I’m trying to help you, John, I know that you love him, and you love Kylie, and I hate seeing you angry at him. Trust me when I say that all this anger that you’re feeling towards him right now, is only going to make things worse, and I would prefer if I was the only divorcee in the family.’ She half-joked.
"And what might be your name?"
“What do you mean by that?”
“Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the sign of God – and in the face of this company – to join together these men in holy matrimony, which is commended to be honorable among all men; and therefore – is not by any – to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly – but reverently, discreetly, advisedly and solemnly. Into this holy estate these two persons present now come to be joined. If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together – let them speak now or forever hold their peace.”
There was silence for a long time before Sherlock spoke. John bit his thumbnail.
"This....my word...." Watson breathed.
"You were heavily drunk that night, John. Looking at the sight of you now, I can say that this was not the first time, nor will it be the last. I'm sorry to have to do this, John, but...Kylie will live with me from now on. I had these papers dropped off to me earlier today. I assume you know what these are?"
Sherlock sighed. John let some time pass, he knew that Sherlock wasn’t sleeping.
"Didn't I tell you?"
‘I don’t know if any of you were aware, but Sherlock has been…ill for a while.’ I didn’t sound like myself.
“And you can do that? Are people of the same sex allowed to be together?”
“That is for me to know and for you to find out, Mr. Holmes.”
'You'll...you'll be unhappier than you are now.' That sounded right to me. I saw your face change from a frustrated frown to one of resignment. You knew what I was going to say, and for as much as you complained, I know that you couldn't leave me alone, not when you had the choice to stay, and you did. Slowly, your body sank into the bed, and your eyes had trouble meeting my own.
John was hurt to hear Sherlock say that, but it was true. John wasn’t waiting for his bedroom to be fixed. He wasn’t waiting for the living room to be renovated, his chair replaced. Sherlock was the one that stayed, the one that continued to take cases. The life that John neglected.
They pressed soft kisses to every part of the other’s face and whispered the word “finally” until they fell asleep.
The Doctor froze at Sherlock’s statement. He was his companion, they both were, John and Sherlock. He brought them with him to go on an adventure and to see all the wonderful things that time and space had to offer. Sure he said that this would probably be their first and last adventure together in all the years they’ve been away from one another, but that didn’t matter. In this moment he was The Doctor’s companion and they were supposed to stick together no matter what. But he also had to make sure Sherlock and John survived, he can’t be responsible for their deaths, he won’t be because it won’t happen.  He’ll come back for them; they won’t be apart for long.
Those seem like happier days.
Watson nodded in understanding.
“And what exactly do we have planned for today?”  Holmes said.
‘You’re going to have to ask her.’
"Why is that?"
She hung her head and walked back into her room. She never wanted to see him upset, she tried everything in her power to get him to smile. She felt bad for saying that to him, she knew that he wasn't going to throw them out, not if they belonged to Angel Daddy. She almost wanted to apologize right then and there, but he wouldn't accept it. He had to calm down first. John, on the other hand, let out a sigh. She was only trying to start a conversation with him, and she told him previously that the only way to do so was by bringing up Sherlock. He scrubbed the dish harshly, and for a split second he was worried that he might break it or chip it. Thankfully he wasn't that upset. All he had to do today was see Molly, that's it. He just had to sit on the bench and talk with her while Kylie played until her little heart gave out. This was something normal parents did, right? They hung out with old friends and went to parks with their children, just to feel like they belonged. John could do that. Normal was something he could handle being. If only for a few hours. He washed his hands to remove any extra soap that might've found its way to his hand while he was washing. He went over to his collection and poured himself two glasses of whiskey. He was running low, he would have to buy more soon. Or maybe not at all. He'll figure it out as the day went along.
“Well, I’m off now. Call me if you need anything, yeah?”
"But really, get some sleep, you look like you're about ready to keel over."
John sniffed a couple of times and then walked away from the fridge, allowing the words that he scribbled down to sink in. This time, he would be remember. He shut the telly off and walk back into his room and laid down on his bed. He stared up at the ceiling, and later on, he fell asleep.
"Yeah, they snagged Sherlock and me right in front of the flag, they used poisoned darts."
Sherlock swayed his head back and forth as if he was rethinking it to himself, but then smiled and laughed at John’s face and said, “I will.”
John didn't answer. His hand was brought up to his cheek and his leg was shaking. Mycroft shifted his gaze to Kylie.
The Doctor’s face was grim now and his tone darkened.
Mycroft pocketed his phone and looked over at John. "Apologies, John, I would have called but I had to make a few calls and was distracted."
“She has done the impossible today, Sherlock.” He looked triumphantly at the now excited infant. Sherlock rolled his eyes and got off the floor and walked in the direction of their room. John was still laughing as he called after Sherlock, picking the baby up in the process. “Oh, come off it, Sherlock, I was just kidding!”
“So what does protect you, Sherlock?”
“I wouldn’t have remained with you for this long if you still remained a mystery to me now would I?”
Sherlock and John glanced at each other, thinking. Then, they turned back with wide smiles on their faces. Holmes and Watson were now smiling too.
Sherlock scoffed. “Indulge me, John. Please.”
'Shh...' I whispered. I told you that there could be a chance that you wouldn't go completely bald, that you would still have some of the curls that you held so dear. You didn't believe me. Of course you didn't, you were smarter than that, you were my genius, my darling genius.
The Doctor sighed.
He could barely stand to live without Sherlock, how was he going to function now?
"She's so big now. Kylie, I mean. I almost expected to see you show up with the same baby I used to babysit. Sometimes I hate the fact that time goes on. Some days I wish that I could make things the way they used to be, you know what I mean. I'd wish that I would come down to the morgue and Sherlock would already be down there, fussing about with some piece of evidence. I'd wish that you would be with him, watching him that smile that you used to wear, and I would laugh whenever you two got into it."
"Ah, then you were separated from him as well?"
John had the spoon his mouth when Sherlock said that. He swallowed the ice-cream and grabbed Sherlock’s hand.
“You know, Sherlock. What you’ve said to me that day. About all the things you loved about me. At first, I thought you were taking the piss, or trying to make me feel like something I wasn’t. But I don’t know if you realize it, but, when you’re being sincere there’s this…this glint in your eyes and your face it softens and becomes what I now know as the real you.”
But I didn’t. I trusted you; you knew yourself better than I did; at least that’s what I like to think. I left you alone, that’s how you preferred it sometimes, most of the time.  I didn’t want to make you feel smothered, nor did I want to hound you to tell me what was wrong with you. I found myself wanting to do that often, Sherlock. To just grab you by the shoulders and shake you up a bit and yell at you that it was okay to tell somebody that you aren’t okay, you always thought that alone protected you, but no that’s not true at all,
“That would be well appreciated, thank you.”
"Yes, about that," The Doctor began, “I was going to do that, but then I started craving biscuits you see."
The first thing that popped up was Google. You were probably in the middle of searching for something when you took the break. Inside of the search box, it said, ‘Statistics of cancer-removal surgeries’.
You started interacting more with Kylie, you would ask about her well-being and to my surprise you actually listened. You touched her a lot more than you used to, and started to acknowledge my presence. I think you finally let it set in that you were her father, and that she was our daughter. You still wouldn’t carry her, but it was baby steps, Sherlock. And you ended up holding her…once…just once.
“Ah, so you’re taking on the good Watson name and becoming a failure, just like your father. Nice.” She hummed and smiled at him, like there was nothing wrong with that sentence at all.
“Bit cliché… I like it though.” He smiled and pulled Sherlock into the middle of the street.
that my experiment is over’ did you not understand?”
John looked at him and narrowed his eyes, “Yes... I suppose you do.” He hummed and then smirked as he grabbed Blake’s wrist.
John was hoping that the man would leave, but of course that was an unrealistic hope. He obviously just got in to work. What would make him leave now? The fingers tapped steadily on the keys and before John could stop himself, he sneezed. He mentally cursed himself as he heard the fingers still and watched as the man pushed his feet on the ground so that his chair could roll back a little bit. John was dead. It was as simple as that. He was going to get into so much trouble for breaking into the school and sleeping under the desk and then he was going to die. He sniffled and just stayed under it.
You look like a monkey
He sighed and scrubbed his face as he sat on his bed. God, he needed to shave, he paused his movements when his hand was covering his mouth and frowned. He suddenly remembered the bombardment of calls he had received and pulled his mobile out. They were all from Harry and that worried John a little bit, but surely she was fine. They were sort of close she probably just missed him and wondered where he had gone off too. If he was safe, he really should have told her previously that he was. He had nothing better to do so he called her back. He waited and waited and then it went to her voicemail. He sighed and set his mobile down. John flopped on the bed and stared at the ceiling, he felt like he was going through a midlife crisis and yet he was only seventeen… surely that couldn’t be good. After a few minutes he slowly picked up his mobile and tried again. It still went straight to her voicemail. That wasn’t like Harry… She almost always answered her mobile. He’d give it ten minutes before he called again. He decided to take a shower in the meantime, to try and take his mind off of today’s events. He stripped his clothes away and got in the shower, letting the water wash over him and drain all the emotions from the day away. Showers always seem to have a calming effect on him, and if he could he would stay in the shower forever, but right now he was worried and eager to call Harry again so he reluctantly got out of the shower and dried off. He got dressed and once again called Harry. When Harry didn’t answer he panicked. Something was definitely wrong here. He ran down the stairs and grabbed the first pair of keys he found.He knew there was a chance he was being extremely irrational, but he just had this sinking gut feeling.
“Do what?” Sherlock asked softly as he cuddled to John's side and pulled the blankets around them.
The feeling of fondness didn’t last long though, the nerves settled over John and he swallowed, looking at the back of the chair and at the top of Sherlock’s head. It was still as curly as ever and he managed a small smile at that. The chair looked completely out a place sitting in the middle of the floor like that, but he was the drama queen so he probably moved it from its original spot just to be more dramatic.
Still Sherlock didn’t say anything for a long while and John gave up – for that moment anyway. A couple of minutes later Sherlock's phone vibrated and Sherlock practically jumped out of his skin.
John moved his foot in circles on the ground and looked at Sherlock, “I like Primark and it’s not a lot of money and it’s giant!! So many things to choose from!” he hummed.
Sherlock frowned, “I’m not quite sure...”
John took a deep breath and then stepped out from the shadows. He cocked his gun and pointed it at Sherlock, "No, actually I wanted you." He growled a bit because talking with no emotion just wouldn't happen. He had to settle with anger.
!!!” He screamed and then kicked the bed because he needed to hit something and Sherlock wasn’t an option. He would
John would have laughed if the situation was different, Sherlock trying to be ordinary was always hilarious to him. “Not when I know that’s not actually the reason you called, and the fact you hate small talk.”
“Do you believe that I’m Sherlock now?”
Sherlock pounded on the door to his old house and waited, he tried using his key, but apparently Mycroft had the locks changed. Why he did that, Sherlock had no fucking idea. He tapped his foot angrily until the door opened and Mycroft blinked at him. Before his brother could say anything Sherlock shoved him and walked inside. “Tell the police you were lying. Let John go.” He spat, he had never in his life been this angry at his brother, not even the time he thought that his brother was betraying him to side with his father.
“Show me your fucking arm!!” He snapped and when Sherlock didn’t move he stepped forward and pushed Sherlock's sleeve up. The track marks as plain as day, how the fuck had he missed them?? He clenched his jaw and glared daggers at Sherlock, how the fuck could he do this to him?
Sherlock blinked rapidly and looked at the man, really looked. His eyes widened in shock and his mouth dropped a bit, opening and closing like a fish before he could finally speak. “Jim...”
Mycroft glared at him and then spat in his face, instead of answering him.
jOkE oF tHe ChApTeR:
She stumbled back and hit the counter to the side of her, but nodded slowly, too stunned to even speak at the moment, "I'm sorry..." She tried to say, but by the time she had formed the words, John was already gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
John screamed, ignoring the pain in his stomach and throat, "I DONT WANT YOUR BLOODY HELP!! Jesus! Can you not wrap your thick brain around that?? Do you have any idea how hard it is? What I'm going through? What I see every night? How much I want to die?" He hissed. "No, because you're selfish and all you're trying to do is keep me here! Well fine. Keep your bloody eye on me. Stay at my flat. Put me on a lead and pull me around, but we are
DEUCES!
He swallowed a bit and looked at it, raising an eyebrow slightly. “Really?”
“Oh! Don’t even worry about it! We’ve got all sorts ‘round here and Mrs. Turner next door’s got married ones!” She hummed happily.
The man laughed and smirked some, “You think I’m afraid of you?”
had been through! At least Sherlock thought something! John was left with nothing and he didn’t know if Sherlock had died or if he had just stopped wanting to talk to John. He didn’t know if he was kidnapped or if John had angered him. John literally knew nothing and John thought that that was much worse than thinking your lover was dead.
John nodded as he reached forward and pulled him into the back. He adjusted himself so that he was holding Sherlock up right and proper, but then his eyes widened. “Sherlock!! You’re bleeding!!”
It was much too soon… really very much too soon! “Patience really is a virtue, John!” He gasped and then squeezed his eyes shut. He heard John swear and apologise, but he didn’t take out, which secretly Sherlock was grateful… he just stopped moving and waited for Sherlock to get used to the feeling.
****MAJOR WARNING SPOILERS BELOW****
Sherlock blinked, “why so long?” There was something very fishy about this... Perhaps it was a trap, but if it was that just meant excitement on Sherlock's part.
Sigar laughed and leaned back in his chair. “Oh right. I sort of forgot about you. How are you doing, Sherlock..?” He hummed.
John swallowed and walked over to him. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and kissed his back, letting him know that he was here, but never pulling him away from her.
jOkE oF tHe ChApTeR:
Sherlock swallowed and just laid there as he watched Brian get to work. Brian rolled up his sleeve and with gentle hands put the blue band around his arm and tied it tight. He hadn’t really said yes to them, but he was too weak to turn them down. Anything that could help him get his mind off John was something he would welcome.
*EDIT*
John swallowed hard as he walked into his house. It was quiet, but that was to be expected... It was late... Really late. And since John wasn't there at the moment there was no one to make messes... Basically this was just some long arse holiday that all his servants got to enjoy. He didn't mind though because they never got to take breaks and for some reason he was feeling generous.
Question:
not my type!” Sherlock drawled and looked over to find a very wide eyed John.
Claire smirked and then pretended to gag, “You two are so lovely it hurts!”
“John really. He didn’t get that far… He started to undo my belt when they came…” He whispered. “He didn’t even kiss me. He just brushed his fingers all over me and—“ Sherlock shivered and felt like he was going to throw up so he stopped talking.
....Yeah... I told you it was a doozy... But hey... I never get all choked up when I am writing my own stuff... and I definitely was feeling some major feels writing that last part... So basically not only am I hurting you, but I'm hurting me.... (;
JoKe Of ThE cHaPtEr!!!!!
John cut her off, “I
“Nope,” He shook his head. “Do not go blaming this on me. They told me you died and I was not about to write to someone that couldn’t write back to me!” He stood up and stepped closer to John, looming over him.
“I am not eating that…” He stared at the green jiggly substance suspiciously.
Lily nodded some, “Yes, of course, Dear.” Slipping further down into the bed and wiggling into a comfortable position, she smiled softly and then watched as they left.
“He was rude, arrogant, and cocky! All around he was a bastard and frankly I think the author who wrote about him made him seem more brilliant than he actually was.”
You will be punished so se(V)rely If you step out of line
What do you call a singing computer?
John rolled his eyes, “Maybe we should cut off a piece of your hair and put it in a locket that I can wear around my neck.” He huffed, but had a faint smile playing on his lips.
They got back from a case one night and Sherlock was in a bad mood because he couldn’t solve it. Of course he couldn’t solve it... John was the cause of it and he hated himself for it. That was a first and he didn’t like it. “It’s fine... you’ll catch him eventually...” Of that John was certain, but that was because John would have to reveal himself to Sherlock and it and then Sherlock would understand. He would also hate John, though he supposed that didn’t matter because he was supposed to torture him.
John's brain started to think of a million reasons why they couldn’t. He thought of how nice it would be to fall asleep in Sherlock's arms, but then thought about what would happen if his father were to catch him. His bed was far too small and in order for them to both stay on it they would have to squish together… normal teenage boys didn’t do that! But then again there was a high chance John was gay and Sherlock wasn’t normal at all so did it really matter…? “Ugh! Fine! Get in the stupid bed!” He threw the blankets across the room and walked over to the bed before climbing in. He watched as Sherlock climbed in as well and snuggled against John's chest.
Sherlock smirked lovingly, “Wouldn’t dream of it, Cakeman.” He snickered and fed John a strawberry.
Well fuck.
John was silent for a long time. He didn’t know what to say and those five words cut him so deep. This just confirming what he already knew, this Sherlock was not the Sherlock he loved. He did suppose it was silly to still assume Sherlock was his boyfriend, but he still considered Sherlock his boyfriend despite everything that had happened, so it really wasn’t that silly of an assumption. “Guess I was mistaken then…” He said dryly.
“Haven’t you ever seen The Notebook..?” He asked softly as he raised an eyebrow.
“No, I’m not—” John cut himself off and then smirked. That wasn’t a bad idea actually. If John was next to Sherlock, John’s friends couldn’t bug him. “Alright, fine.”
“I am sick of your abuse! I have been so patient with you and I can’t take it anymore! And enough with the word ‘fag’, it’s disrespectful and I don’t like it! Call us rainbow or queer or gay or I don’t care! Just don’t use that word!” John spat. Ted kicked John off of him and John landed across the room. He clenched his stomach in pain, but he wasn’t going to back down, not this time.
Sherlock just nodded, slowly standing up as John took him to his bed.
you have with me.”
His father laughed while John punched him. “You think a fag like yourself is going to hurt me?! Please you’re as weak as a woman! Actually you’re probably weaker than a woman,” His laughter boomed through the room and Sherlock shivered as he felt his skin crawl. There was something about Ted that was off, aside from the aggression and drunkenness, of course. He just couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
Sherlock just hummed, trying not to sound bitter, and shook his head, “No, nothing is wrong. Why would there be anything
Brian screamed. How dare Sherlock accuse him of being a poof! He ran over to Sherlock and yanked him up by his hair. He snickered when Sherlock yelped. “You know… I originally came over here because Johnny boy said that I couldn’t beat you up in a fight. I wasn’t going to fight you because I’m better than that, but when you sit there and tell lies about me… well, you really should learn your place at this school!” he hissed and shoved Sherlock up against the tree, holding him there.
John felt his heart swell and he nodded, he needed to push his anger aside and just forget about all of this. It was an emotional time for both of them, and Sherlock had been dealing with it the way he saw fit. “Of course.” He breathed. “Now, since we are trying to fix things... anything else you want to tell me about? Because this relationship isn’t going to work if there are lies between us.”
Finally, he could see then car and he whimpered with joy as he swam faster. Really, in all honesty, this was rather stupid because he didn’t even know if John was in the car! He just saw his dad... But if John was in there he would be in the back seat because he didn’t see anyone in the front when his father almost ran him over. Sherlock got to the back door of the car and his lungs were screaming at him... He needed air and he didn’t have much longer, but all he had to do was break the window and they would be fine. They both would. Sherlock tried to open the door so he didn’t have to use his rock, but he knew how idiotic that was because of the pressure underwater. He knew the door wouldn’t budge so he didn’t know why he tried it in the first place.
Sherlock bit his lip and looked around the room for a means to escape. Unfortunately, there wasn’t one in sight.
“No, you don’t... but under the circumstances I really think you should have.” She whispered quietly. She wasn’t angry John had shoved her away, she understood, she really did.
See you at the bottom, bitches!
John sighed and led the crazy Sherlock Holmes imposter back to his flat. He pulled out his key and smirked at Sherlock as he stepped up to the door.
yep... i definitely have that link memorised... ummmmmmmmmmmm
about him. John lowered his eyes to stare at Mycroft for a moment before he slowly spoke, “Is there a reason you drug me, tied me up, and then stripped me of my clothes?”
“You weren’t ready... What is done is done, John. You can’t change what had happened so there is absolutely no point in complaining about it and regretting the moment. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. There are no coincidences, or luck, or anything else of the sort. Whatever happens, happens and they lead us to the path where we are supposed to be... You may think that sounds stupid, I know, but that’s what I think and I don’t think you should dwell on something that you did in the past... You should look forward to the future and savour the present because you never know when your time will be up and regretting something that you can’t fix no matter what it is, is just going to make you miserable.” He said softly, “Now, I think I said I wanted a certain John Watson to be lying next to me.” He smiled.
John smiled and leaned back against the couch.
Mycroft made a face and finally looked up from the newspaper, “Quite the opposite actually. I do not wish to engage in sexual intercourse… therefore I do not seek it.”
She hummed, “Finally! I thought he would never leave.”
They meet again.
The played for hours and eventually Lily lost all of her money – she would never tell her boys this, but it was most definitely deliberate. She much preferred to just watch the two of them play, they got more into it than she ever could. “I’m winning, Sherlock!! There’s no way you can catch up to me.” John laughed manically, “Might as well give up now because you have lost.” He sung as he held the dice in his hand, it wasn’t his turn, but he did love to tease Sherlock.
Mycroft sighed and ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair. “I’m sure he has his reasons little brother.”
“Sherlock,” John giggled, “it won’t, I promise. Just what is it?”
And I wrote the very first fic
“Mmhhmm.” Donna hummed. “Keep telling yourself that.” She smirked and the Doctor rolled his eyes.
But I've done loads of stuff on my own! I've been in a few lifetime movies that haven't aired yet. And I've been on Masterchef twice as a VIP guest! Along with other things. Life is good currently. well.. it could be better, but baby steps.
She smiled sadly, “I know, love. But you need to tell him, if he finds out without you telling him, that’s going to be a whole different story.”
“You already know the answer to that.” He clenched his jaw and forced himself not to look away, he wouldn’t give Moriarty the upper hand.
"Home!" John growled.
Sherlock smiled softly as he shook his head and got to writing. He wrote about how John was a brave man and that even though life sometimes sucks you need to move on. Never look in the past. He knew that that was easier said than done, but he knew John was strong. He also made his promise to John that he would wait for him until the end of time if that’s what it took.
you and you just told me the world would be a better place if I was the one who had jumped instead of you! That I should just kill myself now because I was a waste of oxygen! And now- now that I'm
, but he was getting nowhere and he was about to lose it.
The Doctor smiled as he saw Sherlock running towards the TARDIS. “Oh good!! Right on time! I thought I was going to have to come and find you.”

“Can't buy you a drink unless you tell me what you want, love,” She rolled her eyes a bit and kept smiling at him. Christ, he must have been just staring at her not bothering to even speak. He cleared his throat a few times before sighing again.
Sherlock frowned, “the words of what..?”
John screamed and then lunged for her, taking her hand and then dragging her to the front door, “I DO NOT WANT TO FUCK YOU AND I DON’T WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU NOW GET THE FUCK OUT!” He heaved and tried to unlock the door, but he was shaking so much he couldn’t manage to get it unlocked and that just made him shake even more.
John wanted to throttle the man, “Oh, I already know that.”
“That isn’t a dragon, Sherlock. That’s a bus and those are cars. People use them to get places… They are like carriages only they can move without the horses.” He smiled and Sherlock blinked rapidly.
“Umm. We went to have breakfast!! He just had a drink and I had flowers and grass. It was so yummy Cakeman! You should try the flower and grass special!”
“Sherlock! Claire’s been shot! Of course we’re going!” John whimpered, of course Sherlock wouldn’t agree to leave the safe place of their current home when he didn’t know the reasons.
“I did tell you I was coming back!” he screamed, “You didn’t reply to me! You only ever hear what you want to hear, Sherlock. You’re a selective listener and only care about yourself. I told you that while I was gone you really needed to think about what was more important to you. Keeping this relationship, or keeping your secrets. I see you chose the latter.” He clenched his jaw, his hands balling up into fists at the side of him. “How long, Sherlock?”
“Oh! That? Yes, I escaped a week ago! I would have gotten you sooner, but you’ve been rather pathetic lately and have been inside all the time... I wasn’t about to kidnap you from someone’s home because that is far too risky. Would only lead to my capture again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mike was on the other line and he sounded frantic, “John you need to come back right now...”
Sherlock used his free hand to run it through John's hair softly. He rested it on the back of John's neck and slowly started to pull him in. His heart was pounding, but he knew that this was the right thing. It felt right and that was all that mattered.
Sherlock groaned and batted him away, rolling over and pulling the covers over his head.
“It’s because you feel the same way!” He growled, “You don’t have to do this! We’ll run away! Just like you said...” He whispered quietly and continued to step forward.
Sherlock scoffed, now it was his turn to be the defensive one, “If you are suggesting I date you, while I am flattered by the idea, I will have to de—“
Sherlock pouted and tried to reach the window once again, but wasn’t even coming close, “John!! I need a boost. The window is too high and why someone would make a window this high anyway is beyond me! Plllleeeeeaaassseee!! I’ve never been to a crime scene before! I can solve it! I know I can!” He looked down at John and gave him a sad pout.

(Q-Curious, R-Asked, S-Unless, T-Teach.)
UNTIL NEXT TIME.
“I can’t live with you Sherlock! I don’t know you!” John screamed and then started walking again, away from Sherlock, away from his house. Just away…
John's eyes flicked to Sherlock's and he saw Sherlock give him a subtle nod. Sherlock was terrified, but if he was going to get hurt he would want John to do it. That’s what Sherlock was saying, or that’s what he fucking hoped Sherlock was saying. He really hoped he wasn’t seeing things just because he wanted to see them. John barely registered that the rugby team was calling him a ‘wuss’ and a ‘sissy’. He stepped forward and looked at Brian, then swallowed hard.
John smirked and looked at him, “alright... now shoot me! Left shoulder!” he hummed.
Madame, who?
Broken pencil who?
Eventually, she nudged him and he giggled, “It’s a shame you’re taken because you’re one of a kind.”
UNTIL NEXT TIME BITCHES! DEUCES!
John nodded and together they walked out and went to the park. Sherlock had a blast... John did as well and that was the problem... wasn’t it. He wouldn’t admit to himself that he was falling in love with this man though... he couldn’t because he needed to kill him. He sighed and kept walking, but then Sherlock slowly decided to take his hand. John’s heart lurched up to his throat and he couldn’t speak.
Zack looked at him sadly. “John... It wasn’t a dream...”
Sherlock started grumbling to himself and throwing things around the room. “You’re going to go away for a little while and only come back when I text you! Do you understand, John?”
John pulled away and smiled some, “now, we have two options. Number one would be to go home and number two would be to go to class.” He whispered and brushed his nose against Sherlock's.
Mike knew... Of course he knew! But he was hoping he was wrong. He swallowed thickly, "John you can't-"
Answer:
Irene squealed, she hadn’t even noticed John standing there, “so, what brings you here, Lover boy?”
“When I’m talking to you, you look at me! Do you understand?!” He spat, and kicked at his foot slightly.
John sighed and shook his head. He bent down and started helping Sherlock pick up his things. “You should ignore them. They’re just a couple of idiotic twats who think they are better than everyone just because they can run up and down a field while getting tackled. When the reality is, they are just like everyone else.”
“OH BECAUSE THAT’S SOOOO MUCH BETTER!!!” Sherlock choked as betrayal filled his eyes and he stood in front of John. “In fact I honestly would rather have you be pointing that thing at me instead of John and you know that. I can’t believe you. I- I will
In truth he was excited to go back home just for the sole reason of wearing different clothes. He only had the suitcase he had brought to Scotland and that definitely didn’t have enough clothes, or items, in it for two weeks. A few times he had to go to a launderette and John absolutely hated that.
Sherlock frowned. “John… The room isn’t spinning and that really isn’t possible in my house…” He paused and pursed his lips slightly. He was trying to remain calm about this, and though it was hard, he was successful, “Can I ask you some questions..?” He asked softly as grabbed John's wrist so he could secretly measure John’s pulse.
John swallowed thickly, he knew Sherlock didn’t go into detail about what happened, but he was never going to ask him to. His imagination could supply enough, and he was livid. He hated that someone put Sherlock through this, he hated that it seemed like their lives never worked out for the better. He hated everything. But there was one thing he didn’t hate. He didn’t hate Sherlock, and right now Sherlock needed him. He stood up slowly, as to not startle Sherlock, and walked over to his chair before putting his knees on both sides of Sherlock's thighs and straddling him. “Hey…” he whispered softly, gently, as he took his thumb and wiped Sherlock's tears away, “You don’t have to say anymore, yeah? You’re okay now. You’re here with me.” He breathed against his hair, wrapping his arms around him and holding him close.
This one was set on a bridge. John didn’t know which one at first because it was dark yet again and no one was there except for the dark silhouette walking, swaying slightly. The figure looked extremely small, John assumed that was Sherlock. And then like a brick hitting John right in the face everything rushed into clearness. That wasn’t just some random bridge... that was the bridge his father had drove off of... the place where he had almost drowned. This alone was enough to send John into another round of sobs. His head and heart were aching and it wasn’t fair! None of this was! And he hated Sigar so much! But there was nothing he could do about it now... he was dead. Not even killing him did anything to ease John’s pain.
"No, John, just listen!! I wanted to show you how it felt! I-" Sherlock fumbled for the words, until John cut him off.
“I don't want you to use a rubber. I’m clean and so are you... I want to feel you.” He breathed and looked at him.
John swallowed and closed his eyes, he had more words to say, but he was too exhausted. “It doesn’t have to be like that! I’m here now... it will be okay...” He said softly, reaching out to touch Sherlock's arm.
“So... Last day of school! What are you doing for your summer, John? Shagging Sherlock?” A player by the name of Alex smirked, the day John was able to come back to school he told the players everything that happened between Sherlock and him. They were super understanding and accepting of it and even though John and Sherlock weren’t on speaking terms, John still wanted to tell his friends.
A plain bagel.
John growled and shoved her away, “I’m not five. I don’t need to fucking tell you where I’m going.” He glared at her, he hadn’t tried to off himself in months. Why the fuck was she still so obsessed about it?
That is all Sherlock cared about... His happiness didn’t matter one bit to him because he was happy if John was safe and right now John was in danger and Sherlock was definitely not happy!
“Well, I think we should drink to that.” He hummed sadly and poured two glasses. He handed one to Sherlock and they clanked glasses, Sherlock was honestly so grateful that he understood. He definitely didn’t want to lose Brian as a friend. Sherlock downed his drink as Brian did the same, “Wanna go watch telly on the couch?” Brian asked softly.
*EDIT*
He smirked, “Being in love with me isn’t so bad.” He snickered and hummed slightly, waggling his eyebrows as he did so.
John froze, but then quickly recovered with a small shake of the head. “Oh... just, you know, over there…” He pointed straight in front of them, “You’ll be home before me though.”
John ate the ice cream right out of the tub as he watched The Notebook. He was a sobbing mess because Sherlock had just practically ripped his heart out of his chest and The Notebook was a rather sad movie. John told himself he was crying because of the movie and not because of Sherlock, but he knew it was a mix of both. And that notion about how men didn’t cry unless they were weak was bullshit. John could cry, he could cry and he could feel sorry for himself as long as he was able to pick himself up at the end of the day and move on. Which he would be able to. The Notebook had always been one of his favourites and he hadn’t seen it in four and a half years, probably even longer in all actuality.
Sherlock eventually came out of his bedroom and smiled softly, “Ready?”
Mike swallowed, “John, all I’m—“
“It’s alright, love. I know you’re busy.” She said softly. Sherlock smiled back at her and the three of them kept talking for a while.
John laughed a breathy laugh, “I know... I did date you for a year – two and a half if you count the letters we actually sent.” He smirked slightly.
*Future me* Sort of wish i made john less weak but i came up with this story years ago and i cant change the story line without changing the whole story and ugh. Though to be fair I did take out a lot of his weakness and mellowed it. guysss he was even weaker in my notes. bwhahaah
He started to pull away from John – from everyone in fact. No matter what John did he couldn't do anything to help Sherlock and that killed him. He realised that the loss of his mother was traumatic, but pushing John away was unacceptable.
“Get up!” Brian screamed and then pulled Sherlock up by his shirt and slammed him against the tree.
“Oh, I wouldn’t do that if I were you. I know things that you should probably know before you pull that trigger.” He hummed and sat back, knowing John would take the bait. He watched as John walked closer to him, gun still fixed on his skull.
Oh my gosh guys!! So many people commented and said that they read my notes, but they don't read anyone elses usually and that made me feel like a special son of a bitch and now I'm a cocky bastard so just know that that is all you're doing. (;
A wave of emotions washed over John as he realised he was just at a funeral... Only Sherlock was the one up in front and John was the one in the audience. They were here for Sherlock's mother and now just John was here for Sherlock, who the fuck was going to be here for him when it was his time? He swallowed down the thought and looked at his feet, "Sherlock bloody Holmes was an arsehole. He was rude and arrogant and nobody liked him. I didn't even like him – well, at first anyway, but that's because I hated him before I even got to know him... And I think that that's why everybody hated him actually... Because they didn't get the chance to know him, or maybe, just maybe... It was because he never let them in... Either way nobody liked him.” He said firmly, he had to be firm because he was angry and he needed to get his point across to the stupid man that was currently dead.
“Rugby can go suck a dick,” John huffed, though not really. He loved rugby and hated that he was missing yet another practice, but this was important to both of them. “And you’ll see where we’re going, but for right now it’s a surprise!!” He screeched and then took a blindfold out of his bag because he was prepared! He started tying it on Sherlock's head and was very surprised when Sherlock had let him. He actually thought Sherlock would at least protest and duck his head away a little bit.
“STOP!!!” Sherlock growled and tried to yank it away, instead it sent the thumbs flying everywhere.
Sherlock slowly looked at John and swallowed, “Umm, John... I don't mean to be rude, but I would appreciate it if I had time alone with my mother...” He whispered and looked back at his mum. He lifted his free hand and brushed the hair out of her face.
okayyyyy i'll do one everyone knows..
months.” John took a shaky breath. This couldn’t be real – this
John knew that he needed to tell Sherlock about his mum and he would, but now was not the time. Sherlock was already going through an overwhelming amount of emotions, to toss his mum into the mix would just be cruel. He climbed in next to Sherlock and held him close, eventually both drifting off to sleep curled up in each other’s arms.
“Hello? John?” She frowned and looked down at the phone to see if they were still connected, she almost didn’t answer her phone because she was on shift, but she just felt like she needed to.
“It would appear so, yes… Though to be quite fair, Donna, it was a hell of a night and I’m pretty sure that I was drugged…” The Doctor trailed off.
Also for some reason this chapter was just so hard for me to write and I kept leaving it...But I think it turned out quite nice and I hope you all enjoy it.
ready to be with Sherlock again – the real bloody Sherlock, mind – you show up and tell me not to do it! Like you actually care for me when I know that you don't!! You're not real. The real one died years ago. Now leave me alone and let. Me. Do. This." He hissed, looking at Sherlock with a fire in his eyes that Sherlock was certain he had never seen before.
Mycroft frowned slightly, “Who? Sherlock? He should be back at his flat... where you should also be so that you can get dressed..!” He said firmly.
Mike swallowed hard and aimed the gun, “what happens if I miss...”
John also hadn't tried to off himself again... He figured one person dying wasn't worth it, but he still wanted to. Sherlock did so why couldn't he? But... He was better than that. He was better than Sherlock had ever been and he was going to prove it.
Sherlock growled a bit and rolled his eyes, “oh, not planning on telling them either? Real mature, John.”
“See… You’re doing it all wrong… You have to be rude…” John said with a sigh.
He locked himself in his room and sat down at his desk, once the letters came he would lock himself away because it felt more private. These were precious moments of time and he didn’t want to share them with anyone. Rainbow jumped in his lap and purred happily, he still hated people... everyone actually and the only person he liked or even got close to was Sherlock. In a way that made Sherlock's heart swell, but in a different way than when John made it do that.
Madame.
“Over the course of the next four months River and Bellfire were inseparable. They laughed and played games and did chores together. But one fateful day a storm came. It wasn't anything bad… Just a snow storm. However, it was terribly cold and Bellfire got sick. River cared for her and tried to tend her back to health, but two weeks later Bellfire shook her tiny head. ‘No point, my child.’ She whispered softly. River started crying. ‘No, don't say that... You can't leave me. We're the only two left.’“ Sherlock swallowed hard and closed his eyes. He could feel himself slipping and he wasn’t even done with this story… He was starting to think this story was a bad idea. It was wasting his energy that he needed to stay alive, but he needed to reassure John. He took a shaky breath, opened his eyes, and then continued.
A few days passed and John was trying to move on with the trauma he had endured. Sherlock and him still hadn’t been intimate, but John was slowly coming to terms with everything. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to be intimate with Sherlock, but he just felt so betrayed by him. Sure, he understood now why Sherlock did what he did and although he didn’t like it, he knew he would have done the same exact thing if he was in that situation. Even still, he was just so angry with him, and just as John said in the cab, his anger did come out from time to time.
She hummed and stood up to clean up his plate, “Yes, of course. Goodnight, John.”
Sherlock sniffs, and clutches the wet papers in his grasp with more conviction, still gently enough to not let the flimsy material rip. “I don’t have my license.” He wonders if the pen will smear in his grasp, and holds them even gentler.
Sherlock shakes his head, agonized. If he speaks, it’ll be too quiet. His breath will catch. He’ll say the wrong things, rude things like he always does, and John will retract what he said on the beach. John’s upset, he must be. Stepping around these sore points is like a ballerina spinning in a minefield.
John turns back around to look at the body on the floor. “You might as well have,” he says, which is absolutely infuriating. Mostly because, yes, John’s right, Sherlock doesn’t know all the details about this weapon, which is unfortunate because if he did, he wouldn’t need the advice of a tiny knight.
Perhaps, it is simple luck, or an assumption that John trains on the racing beaches, or, maybe, he was told by someone. The sure-footing of Henry’s feet on the cobblestone, however, tells Sherlock that he has not come from a tavern, doesn’t seek a drink or a cigarette anymore, and he is confident in where he stands. He meant to be here.
From his jacket pocket, Henry Knight produces an envelope. Yellowed, with a distinctively glistening, red wax seal.
“Thank you.” John moves away and is gone in a second.
“This isn’t your property,” Watson says, and he grins. It takes Sherlock a moment to remember that those were the words he spat at Watson, merely days ago. It feels like centuries, time is crawling so slowly. Diffidently, Sherlock casts his eyes downward to hide a smaller smile.
The water sluices at him, this funnel is filled with packages and tin cans, and something oily layering over the surface of the water, rotting pieces of shipwreck wood slung up against the sides of the quay, water lapping at them. Sherlock wades deeper, losing his footing half a dozen times, calling out to John again and again, feeling the cement wall blindly.
He pushes back his chair, and John wearily rubs over his eyes.
But the chestnut horse sidles up alongside Redbeard as the man rounds off, its entire wet body gliding harshly against Sherlock’s leg and shoving Redbeard to the side, making him have to gather his footing again, so precariously balanced on the very edge of the island.
There’s a tin of chocolate biscuits somewhere here, which will work out until Mrs Hudson comes up later in the evening. Sherlock reaches for the cabinet with the tea boxes in them. He should start leaving them out on the counter like he does with his chemistry equipment, having to actually open something is annoying...
The smell hits Sherlock first, something left out to rot in the damp and the cold.
“Ow, John-- John, my hair.”
a castle-in-the-attic-esque AU! short and sweet for the spring/summer as I work on the last chapter of In the Deep!
Cold wood brushes his fingers. Sherlock stops mid-sentence, mouth open, identifying the object within a few moments, but it’s all the time Donovan needs.
John shakes his head. “No, hang on.” The stables are a great hulking shape in the dark down the path. The lights of the manor house shine through the night behind them. “That’s his
This is when the screaming starts.
He wonders what the dagger had meant.
“Genius takes more than a day to cultivate, Lestrade.”
“You’ll get tired of me.”
Gladstone.
“It can’t be.”
She baulks at the two of them, and with some motherly fretting, she lets them inside. It’s warm and smells like orange meringue pie, but the freezing wet clothes muffle away all of Sherlock’s heat. He can hear the buzzing of the mainland radio drifting through all the rooms.
In his anger that night, Sherlock shoves expensive hay into Redbeard’s stall and crossly runs the hose to refill the water bucket without emptying out the stale rest of it from this morning. He also feed Josephine a handful of expensive oats, because she’s old and deserves kindness even when Sherlock is angry.
John sidesteps Sherlock’s thumb, cautious. “What are you doing?”
Lastly, John speaks of the knife.
John crouches by the heater, the hinges squealing as he pulls open the cover to shove in a new log over faintly red coals. He stands, brushing his hands together like a carpenter after a long day’s work. The room grows hotter. Sherlock sticks his fists into the deep pockets of his coat, turning away awkwardly and fiddling with the Ford’s keys.
Besides during the Races, Sherlock has never seen a

The house is so boring.
Anderson's lips thin into a line, his grip on his notepad tightening. The blue of a cruiser's flash bounces off his dark forensics jacket. "You can't be here. It's a crime scene."
